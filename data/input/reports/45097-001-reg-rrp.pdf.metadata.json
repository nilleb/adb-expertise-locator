I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nequity contribution in the ASEAN1 Infrastructure Fund (AIF) of $50,000,000 annually for 3 years, \ncommencing from 2011, and ADB\u2019s administration of the AIF. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n2.        ASEAN\u2019s  infrastructure  deficit.  The  estimated  infrastructure  needs  in  the  Asia  and \nPacific  region  are  large,  about  $750  billion/year  during  2010\u20132020.  Out  of  this,  the  ASEAN \nregion accounts for over $60 billion per year.2 While the ASEAN region has grown rapidly since \nthe 1997/98 Asian financial crisis and withstood the impact of the recent global economic crisis, \nthis  sustained  growth  has  also  created  huge  pressure  on  the  infrastructure  coverage  of  the \nASEAN region. Table 1 compares basic infrastructure data for ASEAN, Asia, and other regions.  \n \nTable 1: Global Comparison in Infrastructure Coverage (2008) \n\nItem \n\nRoads (km) \n\nElectrification \n\nClean Water \n\n \n\nASEAN \n\nAsia \n\nOECD \n\nLatin  America \n\n10.51 \n\n12.83 \n\n211.68 \n\n14.32 \n\nRail  \n(km) \n\n0.27 \n\n0.53 \n\n5.21 \n\n2.48 \n\nPhones \n(number) \n\n3.53 \n\n3.47 \n\n13.87 \n\n6.11 \n\n71.69 \n\n77.71 \n\n99.80 \n\n92.70 \n\n86.39 \n\n87.72 \n\n99.63 \n\n91.37 \n\nPer 1,000 people \n\nPercentage \n\nn.a. \n\nAfrica \nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations, km = kilometer, OECD = Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development.  \nSource: ADB, UNDP, and UNESCAP.2010.

ASEAN  members  have  been  concerned  about  the  critical  need  to  address  the \ninadequacies of its infrastructure based on a clear recognition that infrastructure development is \nessential  to  the  realization  of  ASEAN\u2019s  goal  of  economic  integration  and  indispensable  to \nestablish an ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by 2015.  \n \n4.        As  a  response,  in  2010,  the  ASEAN  leaders  issued  their  Master  Plan  on  ASEAN \nConnectivity (MPAC). This reflected the vision of ASEAN leaders that building an AEC by 2015 \ncalled  for  a  well-connected  ASEAN  that  would  be  more  competitive  and  resilient,  as  it  would \nbring  capital,  peoples,  goods,  and  services  closer.  As  the  priority  projects  of  the  MPAC  will \nrequire a significant level of financing support, a large pool of financing sources is needed.  \n \n5.        ASEAN\u2019s  paradox  on  infrastructure  financing.  The  substantial  resources needed to \nreduce  the  significant  gaps  in  infrastructure  as  shown  above,  and  to  effectively  implement  the \nMPAC,  cannot  be  met  by  the  countries  on  their  own.  At  the  same  time,  both  domestic  and \ninternational  project  financiers  are  constrained  by  the  market  perception  of  the  high  degree  of \nrisk involved in long-tenor infrastructure transactions. While multilateral institutions such as ADB \n\n                                                \n1   ASEAN  has  the  following  members:  Brunei  Darussalam,  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \n\nRepublic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  \n\n2  ADB and ADB Institute. 2009. Infrastructure for a Seamless Asia. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nor  bilateral  institutions  may  meet  a  part  of  the  requirements,  the  resource  requirements  far \nexceed their lending capacity.  \n \n6.        More  importantly,  the  region  continues  to  face  a  paradox:  it  has  large  unfunded \ninfrastructure  requirements  despite  having  significant  regional  private  savings  and  foreign \nexchange reserves. The ASEAN region currently holds more than $700 billion in reserves.3 The \nsolution  to  the  paradox  lies  in  matching  the  resources  with  the  needs  by  (i)  designing funding \nmodalities and establishing their track record to translate regional savings into investments; and \n(ii) structuring viable infrastructure projects\u2013including those involving private sector participation \nand public\u2013private partnership (PPP) modality. \n \n7.        Innovative  financing  initiative.    The  proposed  AIF  represents  an  innovative  regional \ncooperation and integration initiative that seeks to address this paradox. Through this initiative, \nand  with  ADB\u2019s  investment,  technical  and  operational  support,  ASEAN\u2019s  investments  will  be \ncatalyzed,  representing  an  important  effort  at  south-south  cooperation.4 This  initiative  will  start \nproviding effective infrastructure project lending at the country and subregional levels in ASEAN. \nThe  AIF  model  thus  holds  the  promise  of  leveraging  future  potential  equity  contributions  and \ncofinancing,  and  subsequently  demonstrating  a  means  of  unlocking  a  portion  of  the  region\u2019s \nown  resources  (such  as  domestic  savings  and  foreign  reserves)  for  its  needs  through  future \ndebt issuance.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n8.        The AIF\u2019s impact will be enhanced access to key infrastructure services within ASEAN. \nThe outcome will be greater connectivity within ASEAN, including pooling of resources through \nenhanced  infrastructure,  to  support  the  goals  of  the  AEC.  Specifically,  the  AIF  will  promote \nsustainable  and  inclusive  economic  development  by  financing  the  building  of  high-quality \nphysical infrastructure in the region, especially in subregions where development gaps persist. \nWhile the  overall  financing gap remains  huge,  the  AIF  will  play  a critical  role  as  an  innovative \nsource of financing for priority projects, based on a catalytic partnership with ADB. \n \n9. \nFurthermore, during the initial period, the AIF aims to finance the public portion of PPP \nprojects; the AIF can also undertake financing the private portion after it develops a good track \nrecord.  At  the  same  time,  the  AIF  is  financing  infrastructure  hardware  to  help  anchor  and \ncomplement  the  continued  work  by  ASEAN  and  ADB  to  promote  \u2015software\u2016  development  for \nconnectivity  -  including  the  cross-border  transport  agreements,  and  customs  reform,  as \nstipulated in the MPAC.    \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10.      The AIF will have three main development outputs: (i) additional financing for improved \ninfrastructure;  (ii)  enhanced  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  development  through \nPPPs;  and,  (iii)  support  for  MPAC  implementation  for  the  region.  These  outputs  will  lead  to \nincreased  financing  for  priority  ASEAN  infrastructure  projects,  maximized  development  impact \nby combining the resources of ASEAN and ADB, and catalyzed private sector investments via \nthe  AIF's  support  for  the  public  portions  of  PPP  projects  initially,  and  direct  engagement  in \nprivate sector projects after a strong track record has been developed. The primary targets are \noutlined below: \n\n                                                \n3   As of January 2011.  \n4   The AIF further aims to maximize synergy with other ASEAN initiatives, including the Asian Bond Market Initiative. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iv) \n\nAnnual lending. Projected  lending  approval  of  around  $300  million  (starting  2012) \nwith lending approval growth of 10% reaching to $440 million annually by 2016. \n\nNumber of projects (2012\u20132013). About six projects per year. \n\n(iii) \n\nShare of regional projects.5  At least 30%. \n\nLeverage. The AIF\u2019s total lending commitment until 2020 is estimated at about $3.6 \nbillion.  Assuming  70%  cofinancing  by  ADB,  the  AIF,  contributing  around  30%,  can \nlead  to  a  total  commitment  of  more  than  $12  billion  by  2020.  In  addition,  further \ncofinancing can be attained from other development partners, including from private \ninstitutions in case of nonsovereign operations. \n\nProposed AIF Design \n\n \nD. \n \n11.      The AIF business model. The AIF's capital structure will comprise equity by the ASEAN \nshareholders and ADB, and debt which is expected to be held by various investors including the \nASEAN  central  banks.  The  AIF  will  lend  for  long-tenor  sovereign  or  sovereign  guaranteed \ninfrastructure  projects,  including  public  portions  of  PPP  projects,  beginning  in  2012.  Every \nsovereign or sovereign-guaranteed project financed by the AIF will also be cofinanced by ADB. \nThe loan proceeds will be provided through ADB as the lender of record for the AIF.   \n \n12.      The AIF will begin its operations with the equity contributions provided by  nine ASEAN \nshareholders  and  ADB.    This  is  expected  to  be  augmented  by  hybrid  capital,6 which  is  issued \nafter  about  4-5  years  of  operations.  The  ASEAN  shareholders  will  participate  directly  by \nproviding  equity  capital.  The  source  of  equity  contributions  may  vary  across  the  countries, \nsubject to country-specific circumstances. Once the AIF establishes a track record (after about 5 \nyears  of  operations),  it  will  issue  debt.  Debt  issuance  is  an  important  feature  of  the  AIF\u2019s \nbusiness model\u2014since it is designed to target the use of the region\u2019s foreign exchange reserves \n(while  maintaining  their  reserve  eligibility)  based  on  high  investment  grade  credit  rating  and \nsufficient liquidity.7 ADB has sought the advice of rating advisory services to guide the process \nof obtaining a credit rating, which would be required when the AIF issues debt. Specifically, for \ncentral  banks,  the  purchase  is  expected  eventually  to  attain  eligibility  as  foreign  exchange \nreserves  as  the  AIF  securities  issued  in  freely  usable  foreign  currency  attains  a  clear  track \nrecord  and  sufficient  lending  volume  (important  for  liquidity  and/or  marketability  of  the  AIF \nbonds).8 Additional debt investments are also possible through pension funds, sovereign wealth \n\n                                                \n5   The AIF will use ADB\u2019s definition of regional projects  \u2013 including cross-border projects and national projects with \n\nsignificant regional impact.  \n\n6  Hybrid capital refers to a financial instrument that has some characteristics of both debt and shareholder's equity. A \nportion  of  the  proceeds  are  considered  equity  capital  by  regulators  and  rating  agencies.  Hybrid  instruments  are \nincluded  as  eligible  Tier-I  capital  in  the  Basel-III  framework  depending  on  the  design  characteristic  of  the \ninstrument.  Like the regulators, rating agencies view hybrid as a positive factor and are comfortable with providing \nequity credit.  \n\n7   High investment grade long-term credit rating is considered as \u2015A/A2\u2016 to \u2015AA/Aa2\u2016.   \n8  The  International  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  (IMF)  International  Reserves  and  Foreign  Currency  Liquidity-Guidelines  has \nprovided guidance on how national authorities might apply the reserve guidelines to the determination of whether \nparticular assets should be treated  as international reserves. IMF has clarified that: (i) the requirement for reserve \nassets to be external means that they should be claims on non-residents rather than residents;  (ii) to be \u2015readily \navailable\u2016 the assets should be denominated in a convertible or freely usable foreign currency and should also be \nhighly  liquid;  and  (iii)  it  is  desirable  that  reserve  assets  be  of  \u2015high\u2016 credit  quality  (investment  grade  and  above). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nfunds, commercial banks and other forms of the region\u2019s savings.

Equity  structure.  The AIF will be established with a total equity contribution of $485.2 \nmillion.  Nine  ASEAN  members  have  agreed  to  contribute  $335.2  million  in  equity,  while  ADB \nhas been requested to provide $150 million.9 The equity contributions will be divided into three \nannual  tranches.    In  addition,  about  $162  million  will  later  be  added  from  hybrid  capital, \naugmenting the equity resources. Table 3 presents the equity contribution for the AIF.10 \n\n \n14.      Debt.  The  AIF  plans  to  issue  debt  around  5  years  after  it  commences  operations.  To \nensure  that  the  AIF  is  an  effective  financial  intermediary,  the  AIF  should  ensure  its  ability  to \naccess  capital  markets  at  terms  suitable  for  development  purposes.  For  this,  the  stand-alone \nfinancial  strength  of  an  entity  is  extremely  important.  Such  financial  strength,  which  will  be \nassessed  by  rating  agencies,  will  be  based  on  (i)  strong  shareholder  support;  (ii)  prudent \nfinancial policies (including adequacy of capital, credit quality of the loan portfolio, and liquidity \nmanagement);  and  (iii)  ADB\u2019s  operational  experience  (including  project  lending,  cofinancing,  \ncorporate governance and institutionalization of the new entity). Most importantly, with ADB as \ncofinancier and lender of record, the AIF loans will derive comfort from cross-default with ADB \nloans.  These  considerations  and  an  initial  leverage  target  based  on  a  good  track  record  are \nexpected to enable the AIF to achieve in due course a high, investment-grade rating from major \ninternational rating agencies. \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \nADB  and  the  AIF  will continue  to  monitor any  major  changes  in  the  investment  guidelines  of  the  ASEAN  central \nbanks.  \n\n9   ASEAN members recognize the long-term requirements for the AIF to fulfill its development objectives. However, \nthe  shareholders  also  agreed  that  there  should  be  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  AIF  operations  around  2014, \nprior  to  hybrid  capital  and  bond  issuance  and  before  commencement  of  any  nonsovereign  operations.  Another \nsuch  review  is  anticipated  in  2016,  at  which  time  options  on  changes  to  the  capital  structure  of  the  AIF  will  be \nconsidered, in light of the performance of the AIF and the equity investment climate at that time. \n\n10  It  should  be  noted  that  other  sovereigns  (including  those  outside  ASEAN)  may  provide  additional  equity \n\ncontributions to the AIF at a later time. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\n \n \n\nTable 3: Equity Contributions for the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund \n($ million) \n\nTranche 1 \n\nTranche 2 \n\nTranche 3 \n\nSubtotal \n\n- Brunei Darussalam \n\nItem \n\nASEAN \n\n- Cambodia \n\n- Indonesia \n\n- Lao PDR \n- Malaysia \n\n- Philippines \n\n- Singapore \n\n- Thailand \n\n- Viet Nam \nADB \n\nSubtotal \nHybrid Capital \n\nTotal \n\n111.8 \n\n3.4 \n\n111.6 \n\n3.3 \n\n40.0 \n\n40.0 \n\nUnit \n\nUnit \n\n50.0 \n\n5.0 \n\n5.0 \n\n5.0 \n\n3.4 \n\n50.0 \n\n161.8 \n \n161.8 \n\n50.0 \n\n5.0 \n\n5.0 \n\n5.0 \n\n3.3 \n\n50.0 \n\n161.6 \n \n161.6 \n\n111.6 \n\n3.3 \n\n40.0 \n\n50.0 \n\n5.0 \n\n5.0 \n\n5.0 \n\n3.3 \n\n50.0 \n\n161.6 \n \n161.6 \n\n335.2 \n\n10.0 \n\n0.1 \n\n120.0 \n\n0.1 \n150.0 \n\n15.0 \n\n15.0 \n\n15.0 \n\n10.0 \n150.0 \n\n485.2 \n162.0 \n\n647.2 \n\nNote: Cambodia and Lao PDR will purchase a set of equity units for around \n$100,000 each.  \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n   \n15.

Delegation of the AIF administration to \nADB without incurring the AIF staffing costs will help minimize the AIF\u2019s costs for its borrowers. \nIt would be possible for the AIF to increase its returns to make itself more attractive to private \ninvestors,  but  this  would  imply  a  sharp  increase  in  its  pricing.  Table  4 summarizes  the  overall \nfeatures.  \n \n16.      Current  project  pipeline.  ADB  has  prepared  a  preliminary  project  pipeline  for  2012\u2013\n2013,  based  on  initial  country  consultations.  The  pipeline  emphasizes  project  diversification \nthrough 3-year rolling exposure limits for individual countries, sectors, and projects to strengthen \nthe  AIF\u2019s  portfolio  credit  quality.  Accordingly,  the  following  exposure  limits  have  been \nconsidered  for  business  planning:  (i) 30%  per  country,  (ii)  40%  per  sector,  and  (iii)  a  single-\nproject limit of $75 million. The preliminary list of projects requires confirmation from borrowing \ngovernments.  The  AIF  board  will  actively  review  and  approve  the  project  pipeline  prior  to  the \nstart  of  the  AIF\u2019s  operational  lending  program.  Further  adjustments  will  be  needed  to  fully \nadhere to the exposure limits as described above. \n \n17.      Projects will be from the larger pipeline of potential requirements identified by individual \nASEAN  members  jointly  with  ADB  during  regular  country  partnership  strategy  process  and \nconsultations  or  as  part  of  regional  cooperation  initiatives  such  as  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion  program,  the  Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines  East  ASEAN  Growth  Area \nprogram or the Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle program. ADB may examine any \nviable  sovereign  or  sovereign-guaranteed  project  proposal  for  the  AIF  financing  based  on  the \nprinciples endorsed by participating ASEAN members.11 \n\n                                                \n11 In addition, the AIF will support the implementation of the MPAC, which has identified a number of key projects to \n\nfacilitate physical and policy connectivity among the member countries. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n \n \n\nParameters \n\nPricing \n\nReturns \n\nTable 4: Administration and Financing of the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund \n\nKey Features \n\nSovereign and sovereign-guaranteed projects: Cost of borrowing plus the AIF\u2019s \nlending spread (ADB's current lending spread is 40 basis points).  \nNonsovereign projects: market determined \n\nEquity holders: The average return on equity is projected to follow the 6-month \nLIBOR rate. \nDebt holders: Equivalent to the credit spread of high investment-grade bonds \nfrom corporate/quasi-sovereign entity. \nHybrid capital holders: Similar to the bonds, the return for the hybrid capital \nholders will be equivalent to the credit spread of high investment-grade rating.   \n\nAdministrative fee \n\nAn annual fee of 40 basis points on the AIF assets to help cover the costs \nincurred by ADB in administering the AIF.  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n18.      Nonsovereign  projects. While the AIF will engage only in sovereign operations during \nits initial operations, once a strong track record has been developed, the AIF board may decide \nto  expand  to  nonsovereign  (private)  operations.    This  phased  approach  is  considered  to  be  a \nprudent  way  to  ensure  that  the  AIF  receives  a  high  investment-grade  rating,  as  nonsovereign \noperations  without  full  sovereign  guarantees  are  considered  to  be  inherently  more  risky  than \nsovereign operations.   \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n19.      ADB's  role. The participating ASEAN members have requested ADB to provide the full \nrange  of  services  relating  to  project  sourcing,  design,  execution,  implementation,  and \nevaluation,  as well  as the management  of  the AIF funds.12 ADB  has  been requested to  act  as \nthe  lender  of  record  for  all  AIF  loans  to  maximize  benefits  associated  with  processing  and \nadministration by ADB. ADB will provide these services to the AIF under an express delegation \nof powers from and other terms and conditions agreed with the  AIF board. The mobilization of \nresources from within ASEAN will supplement and complement the resource pool of ADB, while \ntapping  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  infrastructure  development.  This  model  of  pooling  resources, \nknowledge,  and  experience  will  significantly  reduce  transaction  cost  and  provide  a  significant \ncomfort level to the credit rating agencies \n \n20.      For ASEAN, ADB will submit a project pipeline and a detailed annual report on the AIF, \nincluding financial statements and relevant financial and operational projections, for discussion \nat the AIF board meetings.13 The specific details of the AIF\u2019s governance structure are provided \nbelow (paras. 23-24).14 ADB's accountability to its Board of Directors will be through the regular \nproject approval and reporting processes. \n\n                                                \n12  The administration of the AIF will be undertaken by an interdepartmental working group. \n13 The  AIF  legal  documents  will  clearly state  the  specific  functions  and  scope  (including  information  sharing, \nindemnification of ADB as administrator, except in case of gross negligence) of each role that ADB will undertake. \nDetailed discussions of this delegation of power have been held among the ASEAN shareholders and ADB. \n\n14 In addition, it should be noted that all ASEAN members are represented on the ADB Board, which will facilitate the \n\ncommunication among ADB and the ASEAN members.     \n\n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\n \n \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n\n21.      Demand  assessment.  Total  infrastructure  investment  requirements  in  ASEAN  are \nformidable,  at  over  $60  billion  per  year  for  the  next  10  years.  On  average,  the  public  sector \n(national and subnational governments, and state-owned enterprises) should meet about 35%\u2013\n40% of these requirements. Multilateral and bilateral institutions may contribute about 10-12%, \nand the rest should be mobilized from the private sector, including national and foreign financial \ninstitutions.  At  present,  the  public  sector  is  unable  to  exceed  about  20%  because  of  fiscal \nconstraints, and the private sector also invests only the same amount or less in the absence of \nrobust  risk-sharing  arrangements.  As  a  result,  a  solid  pipeline  of  projects  will  need  to  be \nfinanced by new mechanisms such as the AIF.  \n \n22.      Financial assessment. The retained earnings operating under a targeted debt-to-equity \nratio of 1.5:1 will result in  an increase of the value of equity; assuming each share has a face \nvalue  of  $10,000,  the  book  value  of  these  equity  shares  is  projected  to  become  $16,642  by \n2026 at a compounded annual growth rate of 3.7%.15 The AIF will begin issuing long-term debt \nin around 2016 with a moving 5-year average funding plan of about $275 million to be raised to \nan average of $450 million to $500 million from 2021.16 The speed of leverage is gradual with \nan incremental increase in the debt\u2013equity ratio.  \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n23.      Board  of  Directors. The AIF\u2019s board of directors is the ultimate decision making body. \nIts main functions include the consideration and approval of the selection criteria for projects to \nbe financed by the AIF and a rolling 3-year project pipeline that will be a part of the overall AIF \nannual  report,  in  a  form  of  project  concept  paper,  to  be  prepared  by  ADB. 17 Each  of  the \nshareholders  will  be  represented  on  the  AIF  board.  It  will  meet  at  least  once  a  year  and  from \ntime to time, as appropriate. All decisions taken at a duly constituted Board meeting, except with \nrespect to the fundamental  issues18 shall  be  decided by  the  shareholders who  hold more  than \n50% of the voting power in the AIF and at least 50% of the number of shareholders.  \n \n24.      AIF  domicile.  As  agreed  among  the  participating  ASEAN  members,  the  AIF  will  be \ndomiciled  in  Malaysia  as  a  limited  liability  company,  and  thus  its  operations  will  be  consistent \nwith Malaysia's legal framework. The Government of Malaysia has indicated that it will seek to \nenact  special  legislation  for  the  AIF\u2019s  benefit  generally,  including  exemption  of  the  AIF  from \nforeign exchange controls and from all Malaysian taxation.  \n \n \n\n                                                \n15  The projections for key financial parameters and operations over the next 15 years, and additional explanation on \nthe AIF cash flow projections are in Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 This is assuming a recapitalization of the AIF by around 2018. For ADB, this is subject to the ADB Board approval; \nthe ASEAN members (or any other future shareholders of the AIF) will also need to support the recapitalization. It \nhas been emphasized that the AIF establishment does not commit any shareholder on recapitalization. \n\n17  If  there  is  a  significant  and  material  change  in  the  scope  of  any  project  or  it  is  not  processed  after  the  pipeline \n\napproval, the administrator (ADB) will report this to the AIF board.  \n\n18 The AIF board\u2019s approval of fundamental issues will require a super-majority of 67% of the votes and 67% of the \n\nnumber of shareholders.  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nC. \n\nPoverty and Social Impacts \n\n25.      Major poverty and social impacts of the AIF will include (i) promotion of economic growth \nand  employment  generation;  (ii)  expansion  of  basic  infrastructure,  especially  for  the  poor;  and \n(iii)  facilitation  of  trade  and  investments  through  more  efficient  infrastructure.    It  will  help  to \nprovide people with greater access to  energy, power, clean water and sanitation, and improve \ntheir  mobility  through  better forms  of transportation.  In  addition,  the  AIF can  also  support rural \ndevelopment and cross-border projects.   \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n26.      ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) will apply to all AIF projects.   \n \nE. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\n27.      ADB\u2019s  proposed  equity  contribution  of  $150  million  in  aggregate  will  exceed  the  single \nexposure  limit  of  $75 million  and  25%  of  the  total  equity.19 The proposed amount  is,  however, \nconsidered  to  be  appropriate  given  the  commitments  of  the  ASEAN  shareholders  and  the \nimportant role that the AIF will play in financing of infrastructure development in ASEAN. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n28.      The main issues related to risks and mitigation measures on the AIF capital structure are \npresented below. The development impact and innovative nature of this project are deemed to \noutweigh the risks.   \n \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \n\nEquity: Delay in \nequity contributions \n\nDebt: Difficulties in \nattaining a high \ninvestment grade \ncredit rating  \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nThe country commitment and payment schedule was confirmed by ASEAN shareholders in \nJuly 2011. The AIF will not start operations unless and until at least 80% of the first tranche \npaid-in capital has been contributed. \n\nA high, investment-grade rating is preferred to ensure that the central banks can invest their \nforeign reserves. If the AIF does not attain such a rating, it will need to adjust its  projected \nlending  rate,  lending  volume,  and  return  on  equity.  However,  credit  rating  agencies  and \nadvisors have indicated that the following are key mitigating factors:  \n(i)  Shareholders\u2019  Support:  The  AIF  is  owned  by  ASEAN  sovereigns  and  ADB  and  will \nlend to the same ASEAN sovereigns on infrastructure \u2013 thus, a perception of default is \nminimized.  The AIF board, representing the ASEAN sovereigns and ADB, will provide \nadditional assurance of strong ownership support. Malaysia will issue special legislation \nfor the AIF\u2019s benefit generally. \n\n(ii)  Sovereign Borrowers\u2019 and ADB\u2019s Role: ADB will provide a cross-default arrangement \nthrough  the  complementary  financing  scheme;  ADB  will  cofinance,  process,  and \nimplement  all  AIF  projects;  ADB  will  administer  the  AIF on  relevant  aspects, including \nfinancial management. A set of exposure limits by sector and country and per project is \nin place to ensure the diversification of the project portfolio.  \n\n(iii)  Region\u2019s  History  and  Dynamics:  While  the  individual  sovereign  ratings  tend  to  be \nlow,  collectively  the  region  has  a  good  history  of  low  defaults.  ASEAN  has  been  an \nestablished group for many years and interacts with partner countries outside ASEAN \n(e.g.,  the  +3  process).  Credit  rating  agencies  have  recognized  this  by  introducing  a \n\n                                                \n19 The maximum amount of ADB\u2019s direct equity contribution shall be the lower of (i) $75 million or (ii) an amount equal \nto 25% of the net worth of the investee (inclusive of ADB\u2019s investment).

For the debt issuance around 2016, the AIF will have a regular \nreview  process  of  the  financial  framework,  further  scrutiny  on  the  AIF  track  record, \nshareholders  support,  credit  quality  of  portfolio \nfinancial \nmanagement  (leverage  ratio,  capital  adequacy,  liquidity),  comparator  institutions  and \nalternatives, to enable a high rating.  \n\n(its  concentration), \n\nThe AIF plans to structure its hybrid capital within the approval norms of rating agencies and \nas  per  the  Basel-III  criteria  requiring  stringent  loss  absorbing  features.  Based  on  the \nexpected  rating  of  the  hybrid  capital,  current  market  size,  and  initial  discussions  with  the \nregion\u2019s  pension  funds  and  sovereign  wealth  funds,  identifying  the  market  for  the  hybrid \ncapital is not deemed to be overly challenging.  \n\nHybrid Capital: \nChallenges in \nattracting buyers \n\nSource: ADB.  \n \n\nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n29.      All AIF shareholders have agreed that  all projects financed by the AIF  shall conform to \nall  of  ADB's  mandatory  policies  on  anticorruption,  procurement,  consulting  services, \ndisbursement,  accountability  mechanism,  and others  as  appropriate.  In addition,  each ASEAN \nshareholder  has  agreed to appoint  ADB  to  administer  the  AIF,  including the management  and \ndisbursement  of  the  AIF  funds  according  to  agreed  terms  and  conditions.  Accordingly,  it  is \nconsidered that a project administration manual would not be needed.  \n \n30.      All the AIF shareholders have agreed that the AIF will commence operations only after at \nleast 80% of the first tranche equity contributions have been contributed. \n \n\nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n31.      I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  equity  contribution  in  the  ASEAN  Infrastructure  Fund \n(AIF) would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nrecommend that the Board approve the following: \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\nthe contribution in the AIF from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources of $50,000,000 \nannually  for  3  years,  commencing  from  2011,  on  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  this  report,  and  as  may  be \nreported to the Board;  \n \nthe administration of the AIF by ADB, as described more fully in paragraphs 19\u2013\n20 of this report; and \n\nthe  waiver  of  the  single  exposure  limit  in  terms  of  contribution  amount  and \npercentage of equity, as described more fully in paragraph 27 of this report. \n\n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n\n25 August 2011 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nDesign Summary \n\nImpact \n\nEnhanced access to \nkey infrastructure \nservices in ASEAN to \npromote inclusive \neconomic growth and \ntrade and investment \nactivities. \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance Targets \nand/or Indicators with \nBaseline \n\nThe effective use of the \ndomestic savings and \nforeign exchange reserves \nfor infrastructure financing \n\nIncreased investments in \ninfrastructure from both \npublic and private sources \n\nReduced costs and \nfinancing gaps associated \nwith infrastructure within \nASEAN  \n\nVarious reports and \nfindings from the AIF \n\nVarious sector reports \nby ADB and other \ndevelopment partners \n\nVarious reports by the \ngovernments and the \nASEAN Secretariat \n\nADB estimates \n\nData Sources and/or \nReporting Mechanisms \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks \n\nAbout $25 billion of \ninvestments generated \nduring 2012\u20132020 in \ninfrastructure within \nASEAN leading to \nincreased trade and \ninvestments   \n\nOutcome \n\nGreater connectivity \nto achieve the \nobjectives of the \nASEAN Economic \nCommunity (2015), \nincluding pooling of \nthe resources through \nenhanced \ninfrastructure. \n\n \n\nAsian Development \nOutlook \n\nVarious reports on \ninfrastructure issued by \ninternational agencies, \nthe governments and the \nASEAN Secretariat \n\nData on private \ninvestments  \n\nADB estimates \n\nOutputs \n\n1.
