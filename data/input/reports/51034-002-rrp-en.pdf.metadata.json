Uzbekistan  is  one  of  the  most  dynamic  economies  in  Central  Asia, \nachieving a consistent annual growth rate of 4%\u20138% during 2005\u20132018.3 Since independence in \n1991, a gradual transition to a market-based economy has characterized growth in Uzbekistan.4 \nSince 2016, the Government of Uzbekistan has intensified structural transformations, with a focus \non increasing industrialization and economic diversification, attracting foreign direct investment, \nand  balancing  urban  and  rural  development.  Strategic  investments  in  infrastructure,  including \nSWM, are therefore an essential part of the government\u2019s economic growth strategy.5 \n \n4. \nSector performance and issues. The Ministry of Communal Services was responsible for \nthe collection, transport, and disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW)6 until its dissolution in 2001. \nSince then, the responsibility for SWM provision has been transferred to departments of municipal \ngovernments  (hokimiyats)  that  were  responsible  for  landscaping  and  territorial  improvements, \nincluding  in  rural  areas.7 However,  these  entities  suffered  from  severe  performance  issues  and \naccountability, cost recovery, low tariff and capacity deficiencies, resulting in widespread systemic \ncollapse of the nation\u2019s SWM system. By 2014, only 20% of MSW was even collected across the \ncountry, with collection largely restricted to in and around Tashkent, the nation\u2019s capital. MSW is \ngenerally disposed of in open dump sites, with virtually no environmental protection measures. There \nis limited recycling, and public awareness is low. As it is estimated that Uzbekistan generated more \nthan  4  million  tons  of  MSW  in  2014,  and  this  is  expected  to  grow  to  6.6  million  tons  by  2035, \ncumulatively generating more than 100 million tons, significant investments are needed in the SWM \nsystem to meet the growing demands. \n \n\n \n\n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2019. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Uzbekistan for Sustainable Solid-\n\nWaste Management Project. Manila.  \n\n3  The growth rate was 6.2% in 2016, 4.5% in 2017, and 5.1% in 2018, with forecasts of 5.8% for 2019 and 6.0% for \n\n2020. ADB. 2019. Uzbekistan: Economy. Tashkent (accessed 17 February 2020). \n\n4  Government of Uzbekistan. 2017. Presidential Decree No. 4947. On Strategy of Actions for Further Development of \n\nUzbekistan. Tashkent. \n\n5  Republic of  Uzbekistan. 2019.  Resolution  No.  PP-4291  About  approval of  Strategy  according to  the  treatment  of \n\nmunicipal solid waste in the Republic of Uzbekistan for 2019\u20122028. Tashkent. \n\n6  Municipal  solid  waste  (MSW)  is  nonhazardous  solid  waste  from  residential,  commercial,  and  institutional \nestablishments. It also includes green waste and street sweeping waste. It does not include industrial, hazardous, \nmedical, or other wastes. \n\n7  Tashkent city was the exception: Tashkent developed its solid-waste management (SWM) system through World Bank \nfunding, later to be rehabilitated through an ADB-funded loan (ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President \nto the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Republic of Uzbekistan for Solid Waste Management Improvement \nProject. Manila (approved October 2013, $69 million)). \n\n \n\n\fSector reforms. Since 2014, the government has responded directly to these challenges \n5. \nby implementing widespread sector reforms, including fostering sector dialogue, reforming policy, \nenacting  legislation,  reorganizing  and  strengthening  sector  institutions,  investing  in  physical \ninfrastructure,  and  promoting  private  sector  intervention.  Initially,  reforms  focused  on  enacting \nregulations  to  enhance  environmental  standards  and  compliance  and  improving  SWM  service \nprovision. The government established 157 district sanitary cleaning units to provide services in \nrural  areas,  procured  more  than  1,400  vehicles  and  equipment  units,  and  constructed  14,000 \nMSW community collection points. Private sector participation also increased, both by outsourcing \nwaste  collection  services  in  41  of  the  nation\u2019s  83  cities  and  towns,  and  subsequently  by \nestablishing  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs)  for  SWM  services  in  nine  large  city  and  urban \ncenter \u2018clusters\u2019.8  \n \nSince 2017, government has accelerated further sector reforms, including the transitioning \n6. \nof  nationwide  responsibility  from  the  hokimiyats  to  the  State  Committee  of  the  Republic  of \nUzbekistan for Ecology and Environmental Protection (SCEEP).9 In parallel, the government also \ncreated Toza hududs (state unitary enterprises) in the Republic of Karakalpakstan and each of the \nnation\u2019s 12 provinces to improve provincial (urban and rural) SWM services in areas not served \nby the private sector,10 and established the Republican Association of Specialized Enterprises for \nSanitary  Cleaning  to  promote,  coordinate,  and  monitor  toza  hudud  institutional  development  and \ncapacity building at the national level. Sector monitoring has also improved.11 As a result of these \nreforms, by March of 2019, MSW collection coverage has reportedly improved nationwide from \nless than 20% to about 48% (15.7 million inhabitants), and about 5,000 jobs have been created.12 \n \n7. \nNational strategy for solid-waste management. Assisted by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), the government also formulated a national strategy for SWM in April 2019 (footnote 5). The \nstrategy\u2019s  overarching  objective  is  to  integrate  all  SWM  activities  to  (i)  minimize  public  health  and \nenvironmental  impacts;  (ii)  create  effective,  reliable,  and  socially  acceptable  SWM  systems;  (iii) \nmaximize  the  reduction,  reuse,  and  recycling  of  waste;  and  (iv)  promote  new  technologies  and \nfinancing mechanism. The strategy includes a detailed action plan with 36 actions to be completed \nin  a  phased  approach  between  2019  and  2028.13 The  actions  aim  to  (i)  update  the  legislative \nframework; (ii) strengthen the asset and technical base; (iii) improve organizational capacity; (iv) \nintroduce waste segregation and promote recycling; (v) mainstream SWM education, awareness, \nand advocacy; (vi) update tariffs and improve cost recovery; and (vii) strengthen environmental \nmonitoring and compliance.  \n\n \n\n \n\n8   These city and urban center \u2018clusters\u2019 are in the autonomous Republic of Karakalpakstan and the provinces of Andijan, \n\nBukhara, Khorezm, Surkhandayra, Kashkadarya, Navoi, Djizzak, and Syrdarya. \n\n9   Republic of Uzbekistan. 2017. Decree of the President of Uzbekistan No. UP-5024. Tashkent. SCEEP is therefore both \nthe regulator in charge of environmental oversight and control, and the nationwide proponent of most SWM services.  \n10   Toza hududs are mandated to serve the most difficult operational areas, where haulage distances, remoteness, limited \n\nMSW quantities, and consumer inability and unwillingness to pay are most prevalent. \n\n11   Entities are assigned to strengthen internal and external control systems within the sector\u2019s institutional framework: (i) the \nProvincial  Center  for  Organizing  Sanitation  Services  controls  the  national  SWM  billing  database,  monitors  the \nperformance of toza hududs and private operators, and handles customer complaints and litigation; and (ii) the Collection \nEnforcement Agency of the Chief Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Uzbekistan collects tariffs. \n\n12   Including coverage for toza hudud (32%), Maxsustrans (4% coverage), Maraqand Obod (1%), and private sector \n\ngroup (11%). Based on SCEEP published report. \n\n13   Including (i) an initial phase to strengthen the  regulatory framework, rationalize and operationalize SWM service \ndelivery institutions, address acute MSW collection deficiencies, and improve dump sites; (ii) a second phase to \nachieve universal SWM collection coverage, and transit from existing dump sites to modern sanitary landfills; and \n(iii) a third phase to accelerate waste reduction and recycling initiatives, and incorporate alternative technologies. \n\n2 \n \n\n \n\n\fPriority  needs.  Key  areas  for  support  are  (i)  developing  the  regulatory  framework,  (ii) \n8. \nmaking  operational  and  improving  the  Republican  Association  of  Specialized  Enterprises  for \nSanitary Cleaning and toza hududs, (iii) enhancing environmental monitoring and compliance, and \n(iv) filling investment gaps for basic SWM collection vehicles and equipment to expand service \ncoverage (currently at 48%). \n \n\n9. \nADB  and  development  partner  support.  ADB  has  been  actively  assisting  the \ngovernment  to  rehabilitate  and  expand  the  Tashkent  city  SWM  system,  and  to  formulate  the \nnational SWM strategy.14 Similarly, the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement is implementing an \nSWM project in Samarkand city, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is \npreparing  an  SWM  project  to  establish sanitary  landfills  in  Karakalpakstan  and  Horezm.  Close \ncoordination is ongoing with the development partners under the guidance of the national SWM \nstrategy. The government has commenced improvement of the MSW disposal systems through \nupgrading of existing dump sites. Waste-to-energy proposals are being explored to minimize the \nwaste to be disposed of.  \n \nProject alignment and lessons learned. The project is consistent with the ADB country \n10. \npartnership strategy, 2019\u20122023 for Uzbekistan,15 and aligns with ADB's Strategy 2030 operational \npriorities of strengthening governance and institutional capacity, addressing remaining poverty, \naccelerating  progress  in  gender  equality,  enhancing  environmental  sustainability,  and  creating \nlivable  cities. 16  It  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2020\u20122022 17  for \nUzbekistan.  The  project  prioritizes  asset  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  performance-based \noperations, and cost recovery to improve sustainability. Lessons incorporated in the project design \ninclude  (i)  an  inclusive  development  approach  through  transparent  mechanisms  that  enable \nstakeholders  to  participate  and  contribute  meaningfully  as  users,  enablers,  and  providers;  (ii)  \nstreamlined  procurement  management  and  additional  procurement  support  to  reduce  project \nimplementation  delays;  (iii)  quality  standards  for  civil  works  structures;  and  (iv)  progressively \ntransforming the toza hududs to asset managers, enabling and encouraging private sector and \ncivil society for asset operation and service delivery. \n \nB. \n \nProposed  project.  The  project  will  assist  the  government  to  (i)  update  the  SWM  legal \n11. \nframework by developing specific regulatory directives; (ii) build institutional capacity in and improve \nthe sustainability of the Republican Association of Specialized Enterprises for Sanitary Cleaning and \ntoza hududs; (iii) develop and mainstream environmental education, awareness, and advocacy; (iv) \nstrengthen toza hudud asset bases and improve collection services through the provision of vehicles, \nequipment, and physical infrastructure; and (v) improve SCEEP\u2019s environmental testing capabilities. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  environment,  health,  and  living  conditions \nimproved. The project will have the following outcome:  reliable and sustainable SWM services \nimproved  and  expanded  in  small  urban  centers  and  peri-urban  and  rural  areas  nationwide, \nbenefiting at least 6 million people (footnote 1). \n \n\nProject Description  \n\n \n\n14   ADB. 2013.

Feasibility assessment has considered a range \nof  SWM  vehicle  and  equipment  alternatives  and  the  selection  of  a  preferred  alternative  that \nmaximizes efficiency while ensuring equitable vehicle and equipment distribution throughout the \nnation\u2019s 13 provinces. The service centers will strengthen long-term system sustainability, and in \nturn build managerial and operational capacity. The project investments have also been designed \nto seamlessly integrate with future SWM system upgrades, notably the establishment of regional \nMSW  collection,  transfer,  treatment,  and  disposal  systems.  The  system  design  prioritizes  the \nintroduction of new technologies, including enhanced GPS tracking features for SWM vehicles, \nvehicles and equipment that  meet  international  emission  standards,  and  the  use of  alternative \nfuels such as compressed natural gas in vehicles. \n \nB. \n \n24. \nEconomic analysis. The project is economically viable with an economic internal rate of \nreturn of 17.3%, which is above ADB\u2019s minimum prescribed discount rate of 9.0%. The project \nremains  economically  robust  under  various  scenarios  including  a  10%  increase  in  investment \ncost,  a  10%  increase  in  O&M  costs,  and  a  10%  decline  in  project  benefits.  The  quantified \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fSustainability \n\neconomic benefits of the project include (i) incremental consumption benefits from the improved \nSWM  for  residents,  and  (ii)  the  incremental  (value  added)  tourism  benefits  accruing  to  the \neconomy as a result of a cleaner and consequently more attractive environment. The project team \ncalculated the incremental consumption benefits of the project based on an estimated willingness \nto pay of SUM2,319 per person per month using a contingent valuation methodology. The project \nteam  estimated  the  tourism  benefits  based  on  about  170,000  international  visitors  visiting  the \nproject towns and cities, as well as their length of stay and average daily spending.22 \n \nFinancial analysis. The financial analysis assesses the 13 toza hududs and their ability \n25. \nto generate sufficient revenues to cover their operating expenses. Although the toza hududs were \nestablished in late 2017, the analysis of their 2018 audited financial statements reveal that 12 out \nof the 13 toza hududs generated sufficient revenues to cover their operating expenses. Only one  \ndid not meet its operating expenses in 2018, however it mitigated this shortfall with a 17% tariff \nincrease in January 2019 and covered its operating expenses in 2019. The projections of the toza \nhududs over the next 10 years, with a 5% profit margin and 20% debt repayment for each required \nby  SCEEP,  indicate  that  all  will  meet  their  operating  expenses  with  an  average  annual  tariff \ncompound growth of 8.6% over a 5-year period (2019\u20132024) when they start to pay their debts in \n2024, and from then annual tariff increases of about 7.7% (same as the inflation rate). The impact \nof tariff increases is about 0.4% of monthly household income, within 1.0% of monthly household \nincome which is considered reasonable and affordable.23  \n \nC. \n \n26. \nThe  project\u2019s  outcome  will  be  sustained  over  the  long  term  through  a  combination  of \nproject  interventions.  Through  the  project,  (i)  the  subsector\u2019s  regulatory  framework  will  be \nenhanced  to  improve  sector  operations;  (ii)  the  capacity  of  the  Republican  Association  of \nSpecialized Enterprises for Sanitary Cleaning and toza hududs will be strengthened; (iii) a public \neducation  and  awareness  program  will  promote  SWM  consumer  awareness  and  improved \ncommunity  SWM  nationwide;  and  (iv)  the  project\u2019s  vehicle  and  equipment  fleets  maximize \nefficiency  and  distribution  equity,  being  sustained  through  the  service  centers.  The  project  is \nfinancially and economically viable and has built-in climate mitigation measures. It will improve \nthe  environment,  reduce  public  health  risks,  support  tourism  and  economic  development,  and \nimprove the quality of life of 6 million people, many of whom live in peri-urban and rural areas. \n \nD. \n \n27. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the  capacity  of  SCEEP  and  its \nPMU is adequate to implement this project.24 The overall risk is considered substantial, because \nthe public financial management risk at the country level is substantial due to weak internal audit \nfunctions  and  international  standards  not  being  followed.  The  project-level  risk  is,  however, \nmoderate, as both SCEEP and the PMU have experience with ADB-financed projects and are \nfamiliar with ADB's financial management requirements and disbursement procedures. Certain \nfinancial management areas will be further strengthened under the project, as detailed in the PAM \n(footnote 19). \n \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\n22  Based on travel statistics published by the State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan for Tourism Development. \n23  Water  Sanitation  Program.  2011.

The  overall  risk  is  considered  moderate. Risks  identified  in  the \ncountry  sector  procurement  risk  assessment  impacting  at  the  project  level  are  moderate. The \ncapacity of SCEEP and its PMU is considered satisfactory. Risks for each of the different project \nphases (i.e. design, tender, contract implementation) were identified, with twelve out of total forty-\neight are considered as high. Details of risks and mitigation measures are described in the project \nprocurement risk assessment and PAM (footnote 19). To achieve the principle of value for money, \nfit-for-purpose  procurement  arrangements  will  be  considered  during  the  implementation  in \naccordance with the procurement strategy prepared in the strategic procurement planning. The \nproject team conducted integrity due diligence. No significant integrity risks were identified.  \n \n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and SCEEP. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nE. \n \nOverall, the national poverty rate is estimated at 11.4%.25 However, using 1.5 times the \n30. \nminimal wage as a poverty threshold, the poverty and social assessment concluded that 23.3% \nof the project area\u2019s households are poor. The project will improve SWM for underserved rural \nareas  and  improve  the  level  of  customer  satisfaction  from  63%  to  80%. Social  infrastructure \nfacilities  also  suffer  from  a  lack  of  SWM  services.  In  the  project  areas,  more  than  40,000 \ninstitutions  and  organizations  located  in  rural  areas  are  functioning  with  irregular  solid-waste \ncollection. The overall project social impacts are expected to be positive, with improvements to \nthe quality of life for people in peri-urban and rural areas. The project will improve solid-waste \ncollection, recovery, and disposal services for the full range of social strata, including the rural \npoor  and  other  vulnerable  groups  in  each  toza  hudud\u2019s  areas.  The  majority  (92.7%)  of  the \nsurveyed households are willing to pay for the improved SWM services.  \n \n31.  Women  are  less  represented  in  the  subsector  (12%),  with  limited  employment \nopportunities. The project will create new managerial and technical jobs and provide professional \nskills improvement for female staff in toza hududs. Women are disproportionately engaged in the \nhandling of household waste and are affected when scavenging in uncontrolled environments. \nThe  project  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  rural  livelihoods  and  women\u2019s  burden.  The  poverty \nreduction  and  social  strategy  includes  measures  to  address  social  impacts  and  enhance \ndistribution of benefits from the project.  Proposed tariffs have been assessed as affordable for \nlow-income groups. Women and children (especially girls) will benefit from the project because of \nsecure and better waste collection and disposal services. The project will be classified as effective \ngender mainstreaming. The gender benefits of the project include (i) gender equity provisions in \nthe  regulatory  framework,  (ii) gender-responsive  measures  in  the  institutional  strengthening \nprogram, (iii) gender-sensitive customer relations and complaints systems, and (iv) female staff\u2019s \nprofessional advancement and equal employment opportunities.  \n \nF. \n \n32. \ncategories are as follows.26 \n \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n25  ADB. 2019.

An initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken, \n33. \nand it includes 13 sites (one in each province of the nation) selected for the construction of service \ncenters. Environmental impacts from the project are expected to be site specific and include dust, \nwaste generation, asbestos, and the transportation of construction materials. These impacts can \nbe mitigated  by  proper  implementation  of mitigation  measures  developed  in  the  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP).  The  IEE  includes  mitigation  measures  for  the  construction  and \noperational phases, as presented in the EMP. For two sites, additional waste management and \ndust  control  measures  are  included  in  the  EMP  for  the  construction  period  because  of  their \nlocations in the vicinity of settlements. PMU will prepare an asbestos management and disposal \nplan as part of the EMP for the sites where asbestos is present. All sites are in compliance with \nrelevant  sanitary  protection  zone  requirements.  Because  of  the  limited  and  specific  types  of \nmaintenance works which will be provided by the service centers, environmental impacts during \nthe operational phase will be limited. The project team conducted public consultation meetings \nwith stakeholders in each project site.  \n \n34. \nThe PMU under SCEEP will be responsible for EMP implementation and compliance with \nADB\u2019s safeguards requirements and national regulations. One environment specialist will oversee \nEMP  implementation.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  mitigate  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard  issues  has  been  confirmed  with  the  executing  agency,  implementing  agency,  and \nstakeholders during public consultations. The grievance redress mechanism will be established \nafter project effectiveness. PMU will prepare the environmental monitoring reports (EMRs)  and \nsubmit to ADB and relevant government agencies. This includes semiannual EMRs and a final \nEMR  that  will  incorporate  post-construction  environmental  audits.  The  EMRs  will  also  be \ndisclosed to the public on the SCEEP and toza hudud websites (in Uzbek or Russian) and the \nADB website (in English). ADB disclosed the draft IEE on its website on 8 October 2019. \n\n \n\n35. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). Due diligence confirmed that the construction of \nthe 13 service centers will not entail involuntary resettlement impacts. Land plots for nine new \nservice  centers  have  been  allocated  from  government  reserve  lands,  and  the  remaining  four \nservice centers will not require additional land provision. The project team prepared a safeguards \ndue diligence report to (i) screen all the project activities and potential involuntary resettlement \nimpacts and risks associated with the project, (ii) confirm there are no outstanding legacy issues \nin the project sites, and (iii) confirm that measures to avoid the adverse impacts are integrated \ninto the project design. The executing agency has sufficient understanding of ADB\u2019s safeguards \npolicy, principles, and requirements, and has committed to mitigation measures as appropriate. \nThe supervision  consultant  will  conduct  periodic  monitoring to  verify  that  there  are  no  adverse \nimpacts during implementation and that public consultation, information disclosure, and grievance \nredress are carried out during the project period. \n \n36. \npresent at or around the project sites.  \n \nG. \n \n37. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.27 \n \n \n\nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).
