Improved access \nto quality higher education at USP will contribute to human resource and skills development in \nthe Pacific and will promote inclusive growth enabled by higher productivity and diversification of \nthe region\u2019s economy.3\n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n     \n\n3. \nThe  Pacific  region  shares  common  challenges  for  sustainable  development  due  to \ngeographic remoteness, small domestic markets, and a narrow industrial base. Building resilient \nand  sustainable  economies  requires  a  strong  workforce  with  required  technical  skills  and \nmanagerial  competencies.  Currently,  many  countries  in  the  region  face  shortages  of  trained \nprofessionals and technical personnel, who can adopt new technologies, drive innovation, and \nmanage  business  and  government  effectively.  Of  the  total  population  of  2.3  million  in  the  12 \nPICs,  more  than  half  are  under  the  age  of  25.  If  adequately  educated  and  trained,  they  can \nbecome critical drivers of sustainable development in the Pacific. Research indicates that higher \neducation  in  developing  countries  not  only  increases  individual  productivity  and  earnings \npotential,  but  it  produces  a  professional  work  force,  creates  entrepreneurial  activities  with  a \ngreater number of jobs, and strengthens governance, thereby leading to poverty reduction and \neconomic development.4\n \n4. \nLimited  higher  education  opportunities.  In the Pacific, the gross enrollment ratio for \nhigher  education  ranges  from  10%  in  Fiji  to  2%\u20135%  in  most  other  PICs. 5\n Low  enrollment  is \nattributable to several factors. Physical capacities and program coverage in higher education in \nthe  region  are  limited.  Many  potential  employers  perceive  that  the  quality  of  higher  education \nprograms  available  in  the  Pacific  is  not  sufficient  to  provide  graduates  with  the  relevant  skills \nand competencies required in the labor market. Therefore, students seek opportunities to attend \nhigher education outside the region, such as in Australia and New Zealand. Such education is \nunaffordable  for  most  students,  especially  those  from  low-income  households;  only  5%  of \nstudents  seeking  an  overseas  education  can  obtain  government  scholarships  or  private \nsponsorship.  \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The 12 USP member countries are the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Samoa, Solomon \nIslands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Of these countries, Niue and Tokelau are not member countries of \nthe Asian Development Bank; these are small island countries with a combined total population of 2,800. Niue had \n57 students and Tokelau had 79 students enrolled at USP in 2011. \n\n3  ADB.  2009.

The  Pacific  Plan\u2014the  region\u2019s  high-level \nstrategy endorsed by Pacific Island Forum leaders in 2005\u2014regards an educated population as \na  prerequisite  to  achieving  the  common  goals  of  economic  growth,  sustainable  development, \ngood  governance,  and  security.  The  plan  emphasizes  strengthening  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration to achieve these common goals and identifies the regional provision of public goods \nand services as an important area of regional cooperation. Services, such as higher education, \nthat are costly and inefficient for small island countries to provide at the national level will benefit \nfrom regional cooperation through economies of scale.  In this regard, USP is expected to play a \nleading  role  in  the  region\u2019s  collective  commitment  to  improve  access  to  quality  higher \neducation.6\n \nUSP\u2019s  regional  leadership.  USP  was  established  in  1968  by  the  governments  of  12 \n6. \nPICs to meet the regional challenges of higher education.7\n USP\u2019s regional role is demonstrated \nby its 14 campuses across the 12 PICs, its student composition, governance, and approaches \nto  education  delivery.  The  USP  council,  currently  chaired  by  Samoa,  is  the  highest  decision-\nmaking  and  governing  body  of  USP  and  comprises  35  members  from  the  12  PICs,  Australia, \nNew Zealand, and the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat. USP\u2019s main campus, located in Suva, \nFiji  (Laucala  campus),  hosts  the  recently  established  Japan\u2013Pacific  ICT  Center,  which  will \ncoordinate and broadcast ICT-based distance and flexible learning (DFL) programs across the \n12 member countries.   \n \nIn  2011,  approximately  22,000  students  were  enrolled  in  USP\u2019s  predegree  or  degree \n7. \nprograms  across  the  member  countries,  which  was  an  increase  of  10%  from  2010.  Total \nenrollment is expected to increase further by 16% in 2012. Although precise estimates are not \navailable,  more  than  three-quarters  of  all  higher  education  students  across  the  12  PICs  are \nenrolled  in  USP.  Students  from  Solomon  Islands  and  Vanuatu  constitute  the  second  largest \nshares of USP enrollment (12% of total each), next to those from Fiji; students from Kiribati and \nTonga make up the next largest groups (4% of total each). Despite increases in enrollment from \nthese  countries,  attendees  still  represent  only  a  small  proportion  of  those  in  the  17\u201322  age \ngroup.  As  secondary  enrollment  has  been  increasing,  there  is  growing  demand  for  higher \neducation, but the USP regional campuses, such as in Kiribati and Solomon Islands, are limited \nin physical capacities and academic programs. ICT-based DFL programs with a high degree of \nflexibility  will  enable  USP  to  reach  out to  remote  parts  of the  Pacific  and  to  those  who  cannot \nafford full-time studies. Currently, about 40% of USP students study through DFL programs. \n \nRegional  road  map  for  higher  education. 8   To  achieve  the  regional  vision  of  the \n8. \nPacific  Plan  and  to  meet  changing  global  and  regional  needs,  USP  has  initiated  a  range  of \nreforms. The  USP  Strategic  Plan  2010\u20132012: Quality,  Relevance,  and  Sustainability  has  been \nimplemented  to  enhance  the  quality  and  relevance  of  learning  and  teaching  programs. 9\n The \nnew  strategic  plan  for  2013\u20132018  aims  to  further  reshape  the  strategic  focus  of  USP,  while \nexpanding  its  provision  of  quality  higher  education  across  the  region.  These  strategic  plans, \ntogether  with  the  Pacific  Plan,  represent  the  regional  road  map  for  higher  education.  The \n\n                                                \n6   USP  is  a member  of  the  Council  of  Regional  Organization of  the  Pacific,  which  is  the  highest  technical  advisory \n\nbody responsible for facilitating the implementation of the Pacific Plan.  \n\n7  USP  is  a  regional  entity  established  by  order  of  the  Queen  of  Great  Britain  and  the  Commonwealth  under  the \nprerogative  powers  of  the  British  Crown.  Amendments  to  the  USP  charter  are  approved  by  the  Privy  Council. \nExpert review of USP\u2019s charter and statues concluded that USP may legally borrow money. Details of USP\u2019s legal \nand  governance  structure  are  provided  in  Summary  Description  of  Legal  Status  of  the  University  of  the  South \nPacific  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  A  legal  opinion  from  USP\u2019s  counsel,  \nsatisfactory to ADB, will be submitted as a condition for loan effectiveness. \n\n8   The regional road map for higher education is included in the Framework Financing Agreement (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9   The  University    of    the    South  Pacific.  2010.  USP  Strategic  Plan  2010\u20132012:    Quality,    Relevance,    and  \n\nSustainability.       \n\n    http://www.usp.ac.fj/fileadmin/files/academic/pdo/Planning/USP_Strategic_Plan_2010_-_2012.pdf \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\ninvestment  program  will  strengthen  USP\u2019s  regional  role  and  support  four  priority  areas  in  the \nroad map: (i) improvement and expansion of the USP regional campuses, (ii) enhancement of \nICT-based  learning  programs  and  curricula,  (iii)  development  of  academic  and  career \ncounseling services, and (iv) improvement of USP governance and management systems. \n \nPolicy  support  at  the  national  level.  National  development  strategies  in  PICs \n9. \nrecognize the importance of education for inclusive and sustainable development. For example, \nthe  draft  Kiribati  Development  Plan  2012\u20132015  identifies  limited  opportunities  for  higher \neducation and training as a major constraint to increasing economic productivity, and prioritizes \nits commitment to enhance the relevance of higher education to local and overseas employment. \nKiribati has been urging USP to expand its local campus and extend undergraduate programs to \npermit  Kiribati  students  to  complete  undergraduate  studies  in-country.  Similarly,  the  National \nDevelopment  Strategy  2011\u20132020  for  Solomon  Islands  emphasizes  improved  access  to \neducation as an essential requirement for reducing poverty and improving the lives of Solomon \nIslanders.  Recognizing  the  high  costs  of  overseas  education,  the  Government  of  Solomon \nIslands  views  the  development  of  in-country  training  as  a  more  cost-effective  option  over  the \nlong  term,  and  has  proposed the  establishment of  a full  USP campus  in  Solomon Islands  that \nwill make an optimal use of technology to facilitate online and DFL programs. \n \nADB\u2019s  strategic  context.  Aligned  with  the  Pacific  Plan  and  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020, 10 \n10. \nADB\u2019s Pacific Approach 2010\u20132014 sets regional cooperation and integration as a priority goal, \nalong with inclusive and sustainable growth and good governance.11 This investment program is \nconsistent  with  the  direction  of  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Approach.  It  represents  ADB\u2019s  first  investment \nsupport for higher education at the regional level in the Pacific, building on past engagements in \nthe  education  and  training  sector  through  regional  technical  assistance  and  capacity \ndevelopment  activities.  ADB  support  will  also  complement  the  activities  of  other  development \npartners  supporting  USP,  such  as  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  the \nEuropean Union, the Government of India, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the \nNew Zealand Aid Programme.12\n  \n \n11. \nBy supporting USP\u2019s regional role in the provision of higher education, ADB will promote \nregional  integration  activities  in  the  Pacific  while  helping  PIC  governments  free  up  limited \nresources  for  investments  in  primary  and  secondary  education.  Enabling  USP  to  expand  the \nhighly skilled work force will contribute to human resource development in the region, which can \nfoster  a  private  sector-driven  economy,  advance  the  business  environment,  and  strengthen \ngovernance.  Supporting  USP\u2019s  ICT-based  DFL  programs  will  also  reinforce  ADB\u2019s  regional \nstrategy of enhancing connectivity and social service delivery through ongoing ICT investments. \n \n12. \nFinancing modality. An MFF is proposed as the financing modality, consisting of three \ntranches to be implemented over 8 years. The MFF modality is proposed, as it (i) provides long-\nterm  support  to  USP  for  the  phased  implementation  of  individual  projects  based  on  project \nreadiness,  (ii)  allows  for  timely  arrangements  of  the  required  sovereign  guarantees  for \nsubsequent  tranches,  and  (iii)  aligns  ADB  support  with  assistance  provided  to  USP  by  other \ndevelopment partners.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe expected impact of the investment program is that USP graduates will contribute to \nthe competitiveness and diversification of PIC economies. The expected outcome is expanded \n\n                                                \n10 ADB.  2008.

The  USP \nKiribati campus will be expanded to accommodate the rapidly increasing number \nof  students  by  constructing  additional  classrooms,  an  ICT  studio,  a  student \ncafeteria,  and  administration  facilities.  New  ICT  equipment  will  be  provided  to \nconnect  to  other  regional  campuses,  and  deliver  faster  and  more  reliable  ICT-\nbased learning courses, especially DFL courses. \n\nStrengthened  USP  governance  and  management.  The  education \nmanagement  information  system  will  be  enhanced  by  collecting,  analyzing,  and \ndisseminating  accurate  and  timely  statistical  data  about  USP\u2019s  activities  and \nhuman  resources  (e.g.,  student,  faculty,  and  alumni  data)  to  support  USP \nmanagement and operations. All data will be disaggregated by sex. \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nStrengthened  project  management  capacity.  Project  management  capacity \nwill be supported by establishing a project implementation unit (PIU) within USP, \nwhich  will  manage  all  project  activities  (e.g.,  procurement,  accounting,  and \nmonitoring). \n\n \nSubsequent tranches will support activities under outputs 1\u20135 with a focus on expanding \n16. \nthe  Solomon  Islands  campus  and  enhancing  student  support  services.  The  USP  Solomon \nIslands  campus  will  be  expanded  and  upgraded  with  additional  classrooms,  an  ICT  studio, \nscience  laboratories,  dormitories,  and  faculty  offices.  The  upgraded  facilities  will  be  provided \nwith ICT equipment allowing students to learn through face-to-face, DFL, or blended methods. \nAdditional e-learning materials will be produced and ICT connectivity improved to make a wide \nrange of courses available for students across USP regional campuses. \n \nTo  improve  student  support  services,  pre-enrollment  services  will  focus  on  providing \n17. \naccurate  information  about  curricular  choice.  Career  counseling  services  will  be  established  to \nfacilitate  skills  assessments,  job  search  processes,  and  links  to  available  employment \nopportunities. A new dormitory will be constructed at the Laucala main campus to accommodate \nregional students at the degree or graduate levels, especially female students with families. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe  investment  program  is  estimated  to  cost  $23  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of \n18. \n$1 million (Table 1).  USP has requested an MFF in an amount up to $19 million equivalent from \nSpecial  Funds  resources  with  a  third  party  sovereign  guarantee  to  help  finance  part  of  the \ninvestment  program.

USP submitted the first PFR14 in line with the FFA. The tranche 1 project is \n19. \nestimated  to  cost  $3.975  million  equivalent,  including  taxes  and  duties  of  $300,000,  physical \nand price contingencies, and interest charges during implementation. The PFR is for a loan in \nvarious  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR  1,692,000  from  ADF  resources  to  finance  65.5%  of  the \ntotal  cost  of  the  project. 15\n USP  will  provide  counterpart  financing  of  $0.375  million  and  the \nGovernment of Kiribati $1 million. \n \n20. \nAs a financing facility to a regional entity comprising ADB\u2019s Pacific developing member \ncountries  (DMCs)  and  other  members,  and  guaranteed  by  ADB  members,  the  proposed \nfinancing  is  classified  as  public  sector  financing.  Direct  lending  to  USP  is  consistent  with  the \nAgreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the  Charter),  which  specifies  that  ADB \nmay \ninternational  or  regional  agencies  or  entities  concerned  with  economic \ndevelopment of the region, as well as with ADF regulations.16 USP is a regional entity that will \ndirectly contribute to the economic development of the Pacific region. The investment program\u2019s \nregional  design  and  impact  aim  to  benefit  students  particularly  from  economically  vulnerable \nADF-eligible DMCs for an education sector intervention with high developmental priority.17\n  \n \nThe  loan  for  the  tranche  1  project  requires  a  sovereign  guarantee;  the  Government  of \n21. \nKiribati has agreed to serve as a guarantor. ADB is in discussion with other Pacific DMCs and \nADB member countries to seek similar guarantee arrangements for subsequent tranches. USP \nwill provide counterpart financing of $2 million equivalent for the entire program. \n \n22. \nFramework  financing  agreement.  USP  and  the  Government  of  Kiribati  (as  sovereign \nguarantor)  have  entered  into  an  FFA  with  ADB  that  includes  comprehensive  assurances, \nwarranties,  and  representations  in  relation  to  safeguards,  governance,  anticorruption,  financial \nmanagement, procurement, and disbursement. As a condition to ADB accepting to act upon any \nPFR  for  tranche  1,  the  Government  of  Kiribati  will  ensure  full  compliance  with  the  terms  and \nconditions of the FFA.  \n \nUSP  has  requested  ADB  to  consider  providing  additional  resources  from  its  ADF \n23. \nresources for subsequent tranches. Any additional ADF allocation will be subject to the general \navailability of ADF resources from time to time. Tranche 2, which will support expansion of the \nUSP campus located in Solomon Islands, along with other project activities, is estimated to cost  \n$15.78 million  with proposed ADF financing of approximately $13.55 million. Tranche 3, which \nwill  support  establishment  of  a  dormitory  for  regional  students  at  the  Laucala  main  campus  of \nUSP, will cost a total of $3.25 million with proposed ADF financing of $2.85 million.18\n \n\n   \n\n                                                \n14 Periodic Financing Request for Tranche 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 ADB financing may cover transportation, insurance, and bank charges under tranche 1 and subsequent tranches. \n16 ADB. 1966. Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank. Manila (Article 11: Recipients and Methods of \nOperation, reprinted with corrections in June 2002); and ADB. 2009. Regulations of the Asian Development Fund. \nManila (Section 3.02: Eligible Recipients). \n\n17  ADB  policies  on  classification  and  graduation  of  developing  member  countries  and  on  performance-based \nallocation of ADF resources provide the eligibility criteria for ADF financing based on country-by-country economic \ndata, which would not be available for a regional entity borrower such as USP. The criteria under the performance-\nbased  allocation  policy  for  allocations  from  the  regional  pool  do  not  address,  but  do  not  explicitly  exclude, \nborrowers  that  are  international  or  regional  entities  rather  than  countries,  while  requiring  a  demonstration  of \n\u201ccountry  ownership.\u201d  In  strong  demonstration  of  country  ownership,  the  governments  of  Kiribati  and  Solomon \nIslands have agreed to contribute $1 million each to cover taxes and duties, together with land contribution for the \nexpansion of USP campuses, although they are not recipients of the loan. USP will contribute $2 million, reflecting \nthe  commitment  of  its  broader  membership  in  the  investment  program.  ADB  has  informally  consulted  with  ADF \ndonor members regarding the use of ADF funding for the proposed financing.  \n\n18 Tranche 3 will be conditional on the consideration of applicable ADB policies on ADF availability and other policies \nat  the  time  of  the  request,  as  well  as  the  availability  of  a  sovereign  guarantee  at  that  time,  and  may  take  into \naccount the possibility of cofinancing or additional financing if suitable. \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \n24. \nUSP  will  be  the  executing  agency.  A  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  provide \noverall  guidance for  project  implementation  and facilitate  cross-agency  dialogue. The  PSC  will \nbe  chaired  by  the  USP  vice-chancellor  and  include  representatives  from  USP  member \ncountries.  A  PIU  will  be  created  within  USP\u2019s  Development,  Marketing,  and  Communications \nDivision  with  responsibility  for  day-to-day  implementation  of  all  project  activities,  including \nprocurement, civil works, finance, and contract management. The implementation arrangements \nare summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the facility administration manual.19\n  \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \n\nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agency \n(iv) Implementation unit \nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \nAdvance contracting and \nretroactive financing \n\nDisbursement \n\nArrangements \nJuly 2012\u2013 December 2019 \nPhysical completion of the multitranche financing facility will be on  \n31 December 2019.

For  tranche  2,  the  Government  of  Solomon  Islands  will  provide \nassurance that the new campus site in Honiara is government-owned land, with valid legal title, \nfree from all encumbrances and controversies. The projects under the investment program will \nseek international firms to manage the design, construction, and equipping of the new facilities. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n26. \nThe  economic  and  financial  analyses  show  that  the  investment  program  will  satisfy \nADB\u2019s economic and financial evaluation criteria, and that the tranche 1 project would have an \neconomic internal rate of return of 15.7% and a financial internal rate of return of 12.3%.20\n  \n \n\n                                                \n19 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n27.  With the 2009 appointment of the current vice-chancellor who put forward the Strategic \nPlan  2010\u20132012,  USP\u2019s  financial  position  has  improved  significantly  in  recent  years.  The \nimprovement  resulted  from  rigorous  restructuring  efforts  that  included  payroll  cuts,  faculty \nconsolidation,  and  expansion  and  enhancement  of  revenue  generating  opportunities  on  USP \ncampuses.  The  stronger  financial  position  and  managerial  capacity  has,  in  turn,  prompted \nincreased  support  from  bilateral  development  partners.  Audited  financial  accounts  show \noperating  surplus  equivalent  to  about  $3.4  million  for  2008,  $8.2  million  for  2009,  and  $2.5 \nmillion for 2010. These surpluses represented 4.0%, 12.4%, and 3.4% of total operating income \nfor  these  3  years,  which  contrasts  with  operating  deficits  earlier  in  the  decade.  The  positive \nfinancial outcomes are expected to continue, with USP\u2019s operating surplus for 2011 estimated at \n$3.5 million. \n \n28. \nEconomic  benefits  of  the  tranche  1  project  derive  mainly  from  increased  employment \nand higher salaries commanded by USP graduates compared with the labor market outcomes \nexpected for Kiribati youths without undergraduate education. Project economic benefits include \nan  estimated  value  of  positive  externalities  to  Kiribati  society  from  having  a  more  educated \npopulation  (e.g., more  entrepreneurial  activity,  improved  civil  engagement,  better  public  health \noutcomes), which is assumed modestly at 5% of the value of higher earnings. Records show a \nhigh  attrition  rate  for  Kiribati  students  at  USP.  This  has  been  improving,  and  the  analysis \nassumes that the  upgrading  of the  USP  Kiribati campus  will reduce  attrition  rates  modestly  by \n4.5%.21\n The  actual  campus  upgrading  is  expected  to  bring  more  significant  improvements  in \nstudent completion rates, and hence the economic internal rate of return would be much higher. \n  \n29. \nAn assessment of USP\u2019s financial management capacity concluded that current financial \ncontrol  mechanisms  are  robust  and  procurement  capacity  is  adequate.  For  the  investment \nprogram,  a  dedicated  PIU,  which  will  include  a  financial  specialist,  will  be  established  within \nUSP\u2019s Development, Marketing, and Communications Division. The PIU will oversee technical, \nprocurement,  and  disbursement  processes.  ADB  will  provide  capacity-building  support  to  the \nPIU  to  ensure  that  all  financial  reporting  and  procurement  procedures  are  in  compliance  with \nADB guidelines and procedures. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nAs  the  only  regional  higher  education  institution  in  the  Pacific,  USP  is  expected  to \n30. \nprovide  a  model  for  good  practice  in  governance  and  to  operate  ethical,  transparent,  and \neffective  systems.  In  2009,  the  USP  council  and  management  decided  that  a  comprehensive \ngovernance and management enhancement strategy was required to position USP to meet the \noverarching goals in the Pacific. This view was translated into the strategic plans for 2010\u20132012 \nand 2013\u20132018, one priority of which is to \u201cincrease effectiveness of governance, administrative, \nand management systems.\u201d The investment program directly supports this priority as indicated \nin the road map. The appointment of a new vice-chancellor in 2009 also saw a marked shift in \nUSP direction and performance. The work of the USP governance committee was accelerated, \nand significant improvements were made in transparency, due diligence, and risk management. \n \n31. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  USP.  An  assessment  of  procurement  capacity  found  that  USP  has  a  robust  procurement \nsystem, knowledgeable staff, and clear guidelines. Additional support for capacity development \nwill ensure compliance with ADB guidelines and procedures. \n \n\n                                                \n21  Assumptions about graduation and employment rates of Kiribati students at USP are based on reported graduation \n\nrates in 2009 and 2010, and the results of the USP graduate destination surveys for 2009\u20132010 and 2011. \n\n\fD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \n\n32. \nThe  expansion  of  USP  campuses  in  Kiribati  and  Solomon  Islands,  together  with \nextensive  outreach  activities,  will  allow  more  equitable  opportunities  for  higher  education, \nespecially  for  young  people  from  poor  and  disadvantaged  backgrounds.  Higher  education  for \nthese  young  people  will,  in  turn,  improve  their  employment  and  earnings  potential,  providing \nthem with a greater ability to enhance economic conditions and social mobility. These individual \nbenefits will cumulate into improved quality of life in the region. The improved quality of the USP \nacademic programs will also increase the pool of qualified individuals who contribute to inclusive \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  the  region.  Recent  evidence  suggests  that \ninvestment  in  higher  education  produces  both  private  and  public  benefits,  such  as  improved \nhealth  status,  reduced  population  growth,  use  of  innovative  technology,  and  strengthened \ngovernance (footnote 4). Improved quality of higher education will also enable Pacific islanders \nto  find  overseas  employment,  and  contribute  to  the  home  economy  with  remittances  or  by \nreturning to home countries with advanced knowledge and better entrepreneurial skills. \n \n33. \nThe  tranche  1  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  To  address \ngender-specific  concerns  in the  project,  a gender  action  plan  was  prepared for  the  investment \nprogram and for tranche 1. The plan for tranche 1 will promote increased enrollment for women \n(as well as men) in the USP Kiribati campus, especially in degree programs and e-learning DFL \nprograms. The target is for at least 30% of all registered female students in the Kiribati campus \nto  be  enrolled  in  degree  programs  by  2018.  The  project  will  also  promote  the  participation  of \nfemale  staff  in  all  USP  management  committees.  During  the  construction  of  new  facilities, \nemployment opportunities will be provided for women as well as men.  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n34. \nEnvironment.  The  tranche  1  project  is  classified  as  category  B  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement (2009).  An  initial  environmental  examination  was  prepared \nto assess and review the process for project implementation.22\n Civil works under tranche 1 may \nhave  minor  adverse  environmental  impacts  such  as  noise  and  traffic  congestion  during \nconstruction.  Measures  to  mitigate  such  impacts  and  monitoring  and  compliance  tasks  are \noutlined  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement and all applicable environmental laws and regulations of Kiribati.  \n \n35. \nSocial safeguards. The tranche 1 project is classified as category C for both involuntary \nresettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement. \nThe project does not involve land acquisition or involuntary resettlement impacts. All civil works \nwill be undertaken on land currently being used by USP or on land provided by the government \nfree  of  any  claims  or  encumbrances.  The  project  is  not  expected  to  affect  any  distinct  and \nvulnerable groups of indigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.23\n \n\n                                                \n22  Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n\nMitigating Measures \n\n10 \n \n\nRisks \nUSP decides not to continue its \nreform efforts outlined in the strategic \nplans for 2010\u20132012 and 2013\u20132018 \n(road map). \n\nWeak coordination and reporting \nacross the USP regional campuses \non procurement and monitoring of \ncivil works delay planned \nconstruction work. \n\nThe proposed tranche projects under the investment program have already \nbeen approved by the USP council. Regular public consultations will be \ncarried out with key stakeholders (e.g., member government officials, \nnongovernment organizations, development partners, and regional agencies) \nto discuss and update the progress of reform efforts to sustain the reform. \nThe PIU will recruit a staff member to be responsible for coordinating and \nsupervising civil works and procurement in regional campuses. ADB will \nprovide capacity-building training on procurement and related ADB guidelines \nand procedures for the PIU. The PIU will hold regular consultations and \nrequire periodic monitoring and reporting for the campuses during project \nimplementation. The director of the USP Properties and Facilities Division will \nundertake regular monitoring and supervision activities during construction. \nUSP has given assurance that it will coordinate closely with its member \ncountries and other clients to process necessary approvals in a timely \nmanner. \n\nDelays are experienced in obtaining \na sovereign guarantee for \nsubsequent tranches. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PIU = project implementation unit, USP = The University of the South Pacific. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n37. \nUSP  has  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  will  conform  to  all  applicable \nADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender, \nprocurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  facility \nadministration manual and the loan documents. USP and the Government of Kiribati have given \nADB  certain  undertakings  for  the  MFF,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  FFA.  Specific  covenants \nagreed  to  by  USP  with  respect  to  individual  tranches  under  the  MFF  are  set  forth  in  the  loan \nagreement  for  the  respective  tranches.  In  addition,  USP  has  agreed  to  the  following  specific \nassurances  with  respect  to  tranche  1,  which  will  be  conditions  for  loan  effectiveness:  \n(i) agreement with the Government of Kiribati on a sovereign guarantee for tranche 1; and (ii) a \nproject  facilitation  letter  from  the  Government  of Kiribati  that  assures  land  lease  rights,  in-kind \ncontributions  for  taxes  and  duties,  and  safeguard  compliance.
