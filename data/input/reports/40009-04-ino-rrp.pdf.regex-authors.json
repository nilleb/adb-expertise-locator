I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 3 of the Infrastructure Reform Sector Development \nProgram (IRSDP). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  Prior to the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Indonesia used infrastructure development to \nsupport poverty reduction and economic development.1 However, the financial shock resulted in \ncancellation or suspension of many public and private infrastructure projects. During 1998\u2013\n2004, the government was burdened with the urgent tasks of financial sector restructuring and \nfiscal consolidation. As a result, infrastructure investments, which accounted for more than 6% \nof gross domestic product (GDP) before 1998, fell to a low of 2% in 2000 and fluctuated around \n3% in 2001\u20132006. While investment in infrastructure has started to increase, expenditures have \nnot reached pre-crisis levels. By 2008, infrastructure investment had risen to 3.95% of GDP, but \nwas still insufficient to meet the country\u2019s growth aspirations and the growing demand from \nexisting infrastructure users, let alone satisfy the large population that is lacking access to basic \ninfrastructure  services.  In  2009,  in  response  to  the  global  financial  crisis,  the  government \nincluded  a  substantial  infrastructure  component  in  the  fiscal  stimulus  package.  Although \ninfrastructure spending is now close to 4% of GDP, it is still insufficient to sustain the country's \naspirations of growth of 6% or higher as well as growing demand from infrastructure users. The \ngovernment projects that an additional annual infrastructure investment of 2% of GDP is needed \nto increase access for the marginalized segments of the population, and satisfy the large \npopulation lacking access to basic infrastructure services. \n   \n3.  The government\u2019s priority assigned to infrastructure, and the role of the private sector in \nproviding it, was first emphasized during the 2005 Infrastructure Summit as the first high profile \npublic\u2013private dialogue. It sent strong messages to global investors about the willingness of the \ngovernment to support the infrastructure agenda. At the time, the government estimated that \nabout $65 billion would be needed in new infrastructure investments, with $25 billion (38%) to \nbe sourced from its budget; $14 billion (22%) from domestic banks, insurance, and pension \nfunds; $10 billion (15%) from multilateral and bilateral development partners; and $16 billion \n(25%) from domestic and foreign private sector investors.  \n \n4.  The government fully recognized that private sector participation could not be taken for \ngranted,  and  that  major  structural  and  institutional  reforms  were  needed.  The  IRSDP, \nformulated  jointly  by  the  government  and  its  principal  development  partners,  supports  a \ncomprehensive medium-term reform agenda in various infrastructure sectors. The program loan \nsupports three key reform components, which are (i) strategic cross-sectoral reforms, (ii) sector-\nspecific  reforms  for  transportation,  power,  oil  and  gas,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  and \ntelecommunications; and (iii) facilitation of the preparation of public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) \nresulting in sound model infrastructure projects that can be replicated. \n \n5.  The IRSDP comprises a cluster of three subprograms, a project development facility \n(PDF) for the preparation and execution of PPP infrastructure projects, and technical assistance \n                                                 \n1  The Sector Assessment (Summary): Infrastructure (linked document accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "2 \n(TA) for enhancing private sector participation in infrastructure provision.2 In November 2006, \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  loan  of  $400  million  for  subprogram \n1(disbursed and closed in November 2006), a loan of $26.5 million equivalent for the project \ndevelopment facility, a grant of $2.0 million for the TA, and administration by ADB of a $7.6 \nmillion grant provided by the Government of the Netherlands for the PDF facility.3 The facility is \ndesigned to help the government (i) prepare feasibility studies for national and decentralized \nregional PPP projects, (ii) adopt open and transparent bidding processes, and (iii) execute \nproject transactions. In December 2008, ADB approved a loan for $280 million for subprogram 2 \n(disbursed and closed in December 2008).4 The current proposal comprises a loan of $200 \nmillion for subprogram 3.   \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The IRSDP, of which subprogram 3 is an integral part, will improve Indonesia\u2019s overall \ninvestment  climate  by  removing  infrastructure  bottlenecks  and  increasing  access  to \ninfrastructure services, and thereby support timely realization of the government\u2019s medium-term \nmacroeconomic goals, in particular average GDP growth of 6%\u20137% per annum during 2010\u2013\n2014. The expected outcome of the IRSDP will be accelerated infrastructure development \nthrough major private sector participation and mobilization of additional public sector resources. \nThe impact of the IRSDP has been positive. GDP growth accelerated from 5.0% in 2004 to \n6.8% in 2009 following the 2008 global economic crisis, and infrastructure investments rose \nfrom 2.9% of GDP in 2005 to about 4% in 2008 with these levels being maintained if not higher \nfor 2009 and 2010. In 2006, the government planned to increase capital spending on national \npublic infrastructure by at least 25% by 2010 but managed an increase of 90%. Similarly \ninvestments for increasing piped water connections rose to $296 million in 2009 from $30 million \nin 2007, the electrification ratio rose to 65% at the beginning of 2009 from 62% in 2004, and \npercentage of national roads in good and/or fair condition increased to 86% in 2010 from 81% in \n2006. These outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of the reforms under the IRSDP program \nand the experience suggests the usefulness of dialogue in advancing new ideas with key policy \nmakers, as well as the importance of regular dialogue to maintain the momentum on the reforms \nbeing undertaken.  \n \n7.  The  PDF  facility  with  a  total  funding  of  $34.1  million  will  help  maintain  the  pace  of \ninfrastructure  reforms  because  it  is  project  based.  Further  ongoing  support  will  also  be \nchanneled through infrastructure finance and the operations of the Indonesia Infrastructure \nFinance Facility (IIFF).  \n \n8.  The IRSDP was designed as a cluster of three single-tranche subprograms, supporting \nthree core areas: (i) cross-sectoral reforms, (ii) sector-specific reforms, and (iii) facilitation of \nPPPs. The design has proved to be resilient, and appropriate. Subprogram 3 initially comprised \n70 policy actions with 75 outputs. Without affecting the overall thrust of the IRSDP, 6 outputs \nwere dropped taking into account changing circumstances without affecting the overall reform \nagenda.5 Delays were incurred on 5 of the 6 outputs because ministerial regulations took longer \nthan expected for the sector operational guidelines manual and implementation of the waste \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2005.

PPP \ntransactions, on the other hand, will take longer than anticipated because of delays in the \nestablishment of IIFF and IIGF which came on line in 2010. As for the deleted output on a \nregulation  governing  regional  water  supply  enterprise  (PDAM)  management  by  local \ngovernments, this action has been superseded by other actions undertaken by the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF).   \n \nC.

Cross-sectoral reforms \n \n10.  The IRSDP has played an important role in creating the enabling environment for PPPs \nby supporting the development of a cross-sectoral policy and legal framework defining PPPs. \nMost recently, the President signed Decree 13/2010 to update Decree 67/2005, clarify issues in \nareas such as providing support to national and subnational projects, and require government \npurchase of project land prior to issuing PPP concessions. MOF has prepared draft regulations \nthat  will  revise  the  PPP  government  support  framework  and  formally  operationalize  the \nIndonesia  Infrastructure  Guarantee  Fund  (IIGF),  which  was  launched  in  May  2010  and  is \ndesigned to be a credible guarantee provider for PPP projects. \n \n11.  Operating guidelines have been prepared for the preparation of PPP projects, and the \ngovernment is presently preparing supporting documents to guide project preparation at the \nsector level. Institutional reforms have led to the separation of policy and regulatory functions in \nsectors such as transport, energy, and water. Regulations now permit line agencies such as the \nMinistry of Transport and the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources to establish PPP nodes \nto develop projects.  \n ", "4 \n \n12.  The government has made progress in establishing financing mechanisms to support \npublic  and  private  sector  portions  of  PPP  projects.  The  public  service  obligation  (PSO) \nframework has been successfully implemented in the energy sector, and payments are being \nmade to the State Electricity Corporation (PLN) every 3 months. The PSO framework provides \nPLN with the necessary liquidity to continue operations. The IIFF6 was established through the \njoint efforts of MOF, ADB, DEG (Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH) and \nthe World Bank, and is now in the process of obtaining a license so that it can commence \noperations. IIFF is expected to be an important source of PPP project preparation advice and \nlong-term local currency finance. \n \n13.  The government has taken steps to resolve land acquisition issues and submitted a draft \nland acquisition law to Parliament to replace a law dating back to 1961 and requiring the \ngovernment to acquire land in the public interest for infrastructure projects. The new law will \nembrace the following five basic principles: (i) land appropriation for public purposes should not \nbe  hampered;  (ii)  landowners  will  not  suffer  losses  if  their  land  is  taken;  (iii)  real  estate \nspeculation will not be allowed; (iv) land appropriation procedures should conform to best \ninternational practices; and (iv) land appropriation should take into account current land disputes \nin Indonesia and, to minimize conflict, be respectful of the history of the people. The new law, \nexpected to be enacted in 2011, will remove one of the most important constraints on PPP \nproject preparation. MOF has announced that it will establish a land fund that will operationalize \nthe requirement for the government to procure land under Perpres 13/2010. \n \n2.  Sector-specific reforms \n \n14.  Transportation  sector  reforms.  Laws  on  railways  (23/2007),  shipping  (17/2008), \naviation (1/2009), and road traffic and transportation (22/2009) were enacted to separate policy \nand regulatory functions from operations. Tariff regulations based on cost recovery principles \nhave been put in place. Most implementing regulations identified in the policy matrix have been \nimplemented or are in the process of being implemented. The outstanding regulations that have \nnot yet been approved primarily relate to issues such as technical and safety standards, which \nwill not act as constraints to private sector participation. Various port and rail projects have \nalready  been  approved  for  development,  and  a  number  of  these  projects  (e.g.,  Central \nKalimantan Railway and Soekarno Hatta\u2013Manggarai Railway Link in Jakarta) are expected to \nbe structured as PPPs. Once the new land law is in place, road projects, such as the Trans-\nJava road projects, will start to move forward.  \n \n15.  Energy  sector  reforms.  New  laws  on  energy  (30/2007)  and  electricity  (30/2009) \nprovide  the  basis  for  permitting  private  sector  participation  in  the  power  subsector  on  a \ncompetitive basis. Implementation of these laws has been delayed and five of six implementing \nregulations are still pending.7 However, this does not appear to be acting as a constraint on \nprivate  sector  investment  in  power  generation;  several  power  purchase  agreements  were \nsigned in 2010, and the concession for the Central Java Power Project is expected to be \ncompetitively tendered as a PPP in 2010. A great deal of private sector interest is apparent in \ngeothermal power projects, and several concessions are expected to be financed as PPPs.  \n                                                 \n6  ADB, through a private sector project, provides $40 million for a 20% equity stake in IIFF and a 25-year loan of up \nto $100 million to the government-owned infrastructure holding company PT Sarana Multi Infrastruktur, which will \nrelend the loan to IIFF as subordinated debt. \n7  The Energy Law includes three regulations: one on energy conservation (GR 70/2009 already completed) and two \non renewable energy and energy supply and utilization (drafted for consultation). The Electricity Law includes three \nregulations: supply, support of business, and cross-border trade; the draft is now complete for consultation. \n ", "5 \n \n16.  Water sector reforms. Funding requirements of the PDAM debt rescheduling program \nhave hindered progress in the water sector; however, the government has made significant \nsteps by launching the restructuring program in 2009. Although a new law on local government \nenterprises that would provide greater autonomy to the PDAMs has yet to be enacted, many \nPDAMs  have  started  preparing  the  business  plans  necessary  for  encouraging  greater \ninvestment  in  their  operations.  Some  examples  include  several  large  bulk  water  PPP \nconcessions being developed by the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID)-\nfunded Indonesia Infrastructure Initiative Program in Java.  \n \n17.  The potential for pursuing PPPs in the solid waste sector is high. Several projects have \nbeen implemented in Jakarta and Bali on a competitive bidding basis instead of a business-to-\nbusiness approach indicating that progress is being made. The government enacted the law on \nenvironment (32/2009), which provides the framework for environment standards. The separate \nwaste  management  law  (18/2008)  requires  all  stakeholders  to  uphold  waste  management \npolicies across the country.  \n \n18.  Telecommunications  sector  reforms.  The  telecommunications  sector  is  fully \ncompetitive with 11 public and private companies offering one of the lowest tariffs in Asia. Fixed-\nline density is about 3.7% and cellular phone density 6.9%. The Ministry of Communication and \nInformation issued Decree 02/2010 on the Strategic Plan for 2010\u20132014. In particular, under the \ngovernment-promoted  universal  service  obligation  scheme,  telephone  services  are  being \nextended to 10,000 remote villages, bringing the number of villages connected to around 32,000 \n(out of approximately 70,000).  \n \n3.  Facilitation of public-private partnerships \n \n19.  Status of PPP transactions. In March 2010, two independent power producers (PT \nPaiton Energy for a 815-megawatt expansion of the East Java Power Plant and Cirebon Electric \nPower for the 660-megawatt Cirebon Power, West Java) were initiated with financing from the \nJapan Finance Corporation. Moreover the specific PPP output under subprogram 3 (financial \nclosure for two PPP projects, prepared and tendered in full compliance with Perpres 13/2010) is \nprogressing although their financial closure is expected in 2011. Tendering has been initiated for \nthree PPP projects: (i) Solo\u2013Kertosono Toll Road, (ii) Central Java Power Plant, and (iii) Central \nKalimantan Coal Railway. BAPPENAS has offered another six projects including (i) Bandung \nWaste-to-Energy Project; (ii) Soekarno Hatta\u2013Manggarai Railway Link; (iii) Tukad Unda Water \nSupply,  Bali;  (iv) Tanah  Ampo  Cruise  Ship  Terminal,  Bali;  (v)  Maros  Water  Supply,  South \nSulawesi; and (vi) Umbulan East Java Water Supply. While some of these projects may face \nissues in terms of investment size (e.g., Tanah Ampo Cruise Ship Terminal and Maros Water \nSupply) or viability (Soekarno Hatta\u2013Manggarai Railway Link), achieving financial closure is \nlikely for at least three projects totaling $3 billion during 2011\u20132012. These are the Central Java \nPower Plant, Central Kalimantan Coal Railway, and Umbulan East Java Water Supply. Aside \nfrom the current BAPPENAS list of projects, a pipeline of other projects are being prepared \ngiven  the  improved  enabling  framework  for  PPP  and  increased  investor  interest  in  the \nIndonesian market. In short, PPP transactions are anticipated to accelerate, particularly with the \nestablishment of IIFF and the IIGF. \n \nD.  Program Costs and Financing  \n \n20.  Based on its financing requirement and planned borrowing from other sources, the \ngovernment has requested a loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help \n ", "6 \nfinance the program. Subprogram 3 is a continuation of subprograms 1 and 2, and the intensity \nand significance of the policy content in terms of actions and outputs is comparable to the \nprevious  subprograms  and  completes  the  three  subprogram  cluster.  The  loan  size  was \ndetermined by the strength of the policy package, its development impact, the importance of the \nsectors covered, and the adjustment costs including land capping ($100 million), revitalization of \nPDAMs ($400 million), support for the Government Investment Unit ($100 million. The IRSDP \nprogram also called for successfully undertaking some key reforms which were politically very \nsensitive such as mandating open and competitive bidding under revised Perpres 13/2010 and \nfacilitating  passage  of  the  Electricity  Law  which  had  been  previously  annulled  by  the \nConstitutional Court in 2004. Furthermore, the proposed subprogram loan will also help to close \nthe  financing  gap  for  2010  to  maintain  a  budget  deficit  of  less  than  2.1%.  \nThe loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an annual interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan agreement. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these  terms  and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n21.  In parallel, the World Bank is also considering a similar loan of $200 million for the fourth \nsubprogram of its Infrastructure Development Policy Loan,8 which is scheduled for consideration \nby the World Bank\u2019s Board on 18 November 2010. \n \n22.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding \nlocal taxes and duties) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding \nineligible items, and imports financed by bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with \nthe provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements \nfor Program Loans, the reimbursement procedure will be used to disburse the loan proceeds \nbased on certification by the borrower.9 Subprogram 3 will provide retroactive financing for \neligible expenditures incurred up to 180 days prior to loan and grant effectiveness. ADB will \nretain the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of withdrawal \napplication certification.  \n \n23.  The Government of Japan will provide a $100 million loan on a parallel cofinancing basis \n(direct value added, collaborative) for subprogram 3 of the IRSDP, as it did for subprograms 1 \nand 2. This is expected to be approved in March 2011 (Table 2).  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n \nSource  Amount ($ million)    Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank   200.00    67.00 \nJapan International Cooperation Agency   100.00    33.00 \n  Total  300.00    100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nE.

The \ngovernment  recently  designated  the  Indonesia  Investment  Coordinating  Board  (BKPM)  to \nfacilitate and expedite PPP transactions, with BAPPENAS to oversee PPP project study and \npreparation, while the MOF will ensure needed government support to PPP projects. A central \nunit  being  established  within  BAPPENAS  is  intended  to  be  a  cross-sectoral  policy-making \nauthority, with a mandate to formulate or propose PPP policies.  \n \n25.  The implementation arrangements are in Table 3.  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2008\u2013September 2010 \n(i)   Executing agency  BAPPENAS \n(ii)  Key implementing agencies  BAPPENAS, BPN, CMEA, MEMR, MOF, MOT, MPW, PLN \nDevelopment coordination  Regular joint meetings between development partners (ADB, the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency, the World Bank) and the \ngovernment to monitor progress \nDisbursement   The $200 million program loan will be disbursed as a single tranche \nupon loan effectiveness. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, BAPPENAS = National Development Planning Agency, BPN = National Land Agency, \nCMEA = Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, MEMR = Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, MOF = \nMinistry of Finance, MOT = Ministry of Transportation MPW = Ministry of Public Works, PLN = State Electricity \nCorporation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  The IRSDP reforms are expected to have short- and long-term net benefits. These \ninclude a reduced fiscal burden from the gradual removal of the fuel subsidy and improved cost \nrecovery in all infrastructure sectors. A road map for fuel subsidy was prepared and is being \ndiscussed  internally.  The  PSO  policy  framework  provides  the  basis  for  better  targeting  of \ninfrastructure service provision, connectivity, and access for low-income groups. The PDAM \ndebt-restructuring  program,  which  commenced  in  2009,  will  reverse  the  decline  in  service \nquality and coverage of water supply and sanitation. PLN\u2019s restructuring in December 2009 and \na tariff hike of 10% for higher income consumers in July 2010 will help lower the government \nsubsidy while improving PLN\u2019s efficiency. Passage of the Electricity Law (30/2009) will provide \nthe foundation for medium- to long-term improvements in electricity supply and efficiency as the \nconditions  for  private  sector  investment  begin  to  improve  and  subsequent  investment  in \ngeneration  increases,  in  turn  improving  the  overall  investment  climate.  The  introduction  of \nindependent  transport  and  utility  regulators  in  the  longer  term  will  remove  government \ninterference  in  utility  operations  and  pricing,  providing  the  basis  for  improved  efficiencies. \nEconomic benefits are expected to accrue from improved quality of existing roads through better \nroad maintenance and vehicle load control, and expanded road networks; improved access to \nmarkets and other forms of connectivity; and lower vehicle operating costs. Major general \neconomic benefits will accrue to the entire Indonesian population through the expanded scope \nand improved quality of infrastructure services. \n ", "8 \n \nB.  Governance \n \n27.  The IRSDP is strengthening the key institutions dealing with infrastructure development \nin Indonesia. At the national level, KKPPI, its secretariat, and MOF\u2019s risk management unit are \nevolving  into  institutions  that  coordinate  central  support  for  private  sector  participation  in \ninfrastructure development. The PPP unit located at the BAPPENAS central office is providing \nsupport  for  the  development  of  infrastructure  projects  covering  all  sectors.  Within  each \ninfrastructure  sector,  the  regulatory  bodies  will  be  strengthened  over  the  medium  term  by \nenhancing their autonomy, clarifying their mandate, and providing adequate resources for their \noperations.  The  newly  established  IIFF  provides  long-term  financing  for  private-sector-led \ninfrastructure  projects and  is  timely  given  the  financing  difficulties for  private  infrastructure \ninvestment as a result of the global financial crisis. The recently launched IIGF provides public \nsector contingent liability support for PPP projects.  \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and BAPPENAS. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  the  government  has  considerably  strengthened  its \nanticorruption efforts under the incumbent President since he first rose to power on an anti-\ncorruption  platform  in  2004.  Similarly  the  Financial  Action  Task  Force  also  pointed  out \ndeficiencies in Indonesia\u2019s efforts in combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism. \nThe government has been reforming procurement for some time, resulting in a competitive and \nrelatively transparent selection of bidders by the public sector. The private sector participation \nregulatory framework, adopted as part of the IRSDP, sets out clear guidelines for the selection \nof private sector sponsors. KKPPI is tasked with ensuring that the tendering processes are fair \nand transparent. Furthermore, the President of Indonesia has considerably enhanced the profile \nand visibility of the Anti-Corruption Commission and other law enforcement agencies to deal \neffectively with corruption. These steps are already having a positive impact. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  The  IRSDP\u2019s  main  contribution  is  to  improve  the  investment  climate  and  thereby \ncontribute directly to poverty reduction through greater access to markets, and economic and \nemployment opportunities. The policy reforms are intended to lead to increased infrastructure \ninvestments by the public and private sectors. On balance, the poverty and social impacts of the \nreforms and ensuing investments will be positive, through the benefits of induced economic \ngrowth and the improved provision of infrastructure services. The increase in domestic oil prices \nby almost 30% in May 2008 also freed up much-needed additional funds for more pro-poor \nspending. The government is constantly reviewing tariff policies in all sectors and attempting to \nadopt tariff regimes that are in line with cost-recovery principles. At the same time, the impact of \ntariff increases on the poor is mitigated through appropriate measures such as conditional cash \ntransfer  programs.  Potential  negative  impacts  include  social  dislocation  and  inadequate \ncompensation for land acquisition. The government established the Land Working Group to deal \nwith  issues  of  land  zoning  and  purchase  of  land  in  anticipation  of  future  infrastructure \ndevelopments; the results will be incorporated in the new land law expected in 2011. Overall, \nthe IRSDP is leading to significant social benefits. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n30.  The IRSDP has been classified under environment category C since its onset as the \nIRSDP measures are unlikely to have any adverse environmental impacts. The involuntary \n ", "9 \nresettlement and indigenous people impacts categories are also C. As for future investments in \ninfrastructure by either the public or private sector or by PPP modality, existing presidential \nregulations 36/2005 and 65/2006 recognize traditional communal land ownership and usufruct \nrights. In line with the regulatory provisions, the rights of indigenous peoples are upheld in case \nof any land acquisition involving them. These provisions are in conformity with requirements \noutlined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Most of the reforms supported by the \nIRSDP help improve environmental outcomes through better sanitation, higher electricity prices \nto promote energy conservation, promotion of recycling, and sanitary landfills. Furthermore, \nwhile the IRSDP facilitates the preparation and tendering of several PPP projects, it does not \nprovide any investment support to such projects and the government ensures that all social and \nenvironmental safeguards are complied with in line with the prevailing laws and regulations. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n31.  Government commitment. The government confirms that it remains strongly committed \nto  the  reform  program  embodied  in  the  IRSDP  and  the  complementing  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Policy Loan program. The 2014 elections pose only a moderate risk of weakened \ncommitment and a loss of the reform momentum, as even with a change of government, the \nnext leaders are expected to continue focusing on economic growth and poverty reduction to \nensure a sound tenure in office and mitigate the risk of social and political unrest.  \n \n32.  Government capacity and coordination. While the government remains committed to \nreform objectives, the ability to translate that commitment into practical reform achievements is \nsubject to available capacity within the different government ministries and agencies. In several \nareas, progress has been slower than anticipated by the government when the IRSDP was \nagreed upon. This has typically been the result of low capacity. Mitigation strategies include \nrealistic outputs and schedules based on likely reform progress, and continued provision of TA \nfor  capacity  building.  The  ongoing  TA,  attached  to  the  first  subprogram  (footnote  3),  is \naddressing capacity constraints at BAPPENAS and MOF. In some instances, the progress of \ninfrastructure reforms has been impeded by poor coordination among government ministries \nand agencies, and competing and conflicting interests of various stakeholders. While full and \neffective coordination and reforms in certain sectors may take time to evolve and need further \nconsensus building, the  essential  steps  taken  thus  far will  have  a  demonstration  effect  in \nsupporting infrastructure development in a coordinated manner in the coming years.  \n \n33.  Governance. With the high stakes involved in large infrastructure projects in several \nsectors, the IRSDP may face significant impediments in the form of weak governance, collusion \nand corruption, or lack of judicial capacity to enforce good governance measures. In particular, \ndespite the commendable rigid stance taken by MOF, risks of misallocation of scarce public \nresources could still be encountered during the transition period, leading to government support \nfor directly negotiated projects or projects that do not meet all relevant criteria for such support. \nHowever, the government has considerably strengthened its anticorruption efforts through the \nestablishment of the Anti-Corruption Commission and other law enforcement agencies, as well \nas tightening national procurement guidelines. \n \n34.  Macroeconomic stability. Domestic macroeconomic volatility, adverse global events \nsuch as high oil and food prices, or natural disasters could impede private sector participation. \nIndonesia has considerable gross financing needs and the cost of meeting these will almost \ncertainly go up if outlays on oil subsidies and budgetary financing needs continue to increase. In \nsuch an environment, a sharp deterioration in global economic conditions could make Indonesia \nparticularly vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment, possibly triggering rapid capital \n ", "10 \noutflows and increasing the risks of broader financial sector disruption. However, since 2006, \nthe Indonesian economy has been quite resilient to domestic and external shocks and the \ngovernment\u2019s macroeconomic policies have been sound. \n \n35.  Social issues. Tariff reforms are sensitive in any environment, and Indonesia is no \nexception. As the country is gradually moving away from administered prices and tariffs for \ninfrastructure products and services, social tensions are inevitable. However, the government \nhas so far been successful in reducing such tensions by use of the two-pronged approach of \n(i) comprehensively socializing any planned price and tariff increases, and (ii) using the savings \nfrom the reduction in inefficient subsidies for direct poverty reduction, employment generation, \nand rural infrastructure development. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n36.  The  government  and  BAPPENAS  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the \nprogram shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed  in  detail  in  the  loan  documents.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the \ngovernment has given the following additional assurances, which are also incorporated in the \nlegal documents:  \n(i)  Counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the subprogram 3 loan will be \nused to finance the development needs as outlined under the subprogram 3 \nimplementation arrangements. \n(ii)  The  policies  and  actions  taken  prior  to  the  date  of  the  subprogram  3  loan \nagreement, as described in the letter of development policy (including the policy \nmatrix), will continue to be in effect after the completion of the IRSDP. \n(iii)  The studies and technical designs prepared for PPP projects will broadly comply \nwith all relevant ADB requirements, policies, and guidelines. \n(iv)  Recommendations resulting from the work done under the technical assistance \n(footnote 2) will be implemented to the fullest extent possible, and within a timely \nmanner. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove  the  loan  of  $200,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  subprogram  3  of  the \nInfrastructure Reform Sector Development Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nC.

As such, we would like to offer some concluding remarks on the general effectiveness of \nthe IDPL1-4 and IRSDPI-3 series. \n    ", "28  Appendix 4 \n \nThe World Bank's Infrastructure Development Policy Loan \n \nNational Infrastructure. A major hurdle for improved infrastructure in Indonesia has been the \nsignificant dip in infrastructure spending following the 1998 financial crisis. Over the course of the \nfour-year IDPL dialogue, infrastructure spending has grown steadily. Beyond the higher levels of \npublic finance, the Government has sought to implement a multi-sector reform program that enables \ngreater access to infrastructure services. Of special note are the policy efforts to maintain public \nallocation for infrastructure at both the national (APBN) and sub-national (APBD) levels, which as of \ntoday are higher than those levels anticipated under the IDPL series. At the national level the \nallocations have been more than three times the targets. In addition, reforms in the power and water \nsectors are beginning to show promising results. \nIn the power sector, a tariff adjustment that has been stipulated through Ministerial Regulation No. \n712010 which regulates the average tariff increase up to 10% is expected to achieve the above targets. \nIt is highlighted that by this regulation, a better pricing policy also signals a better investment climate \nin electricity sector. As a result, we are considering a tariff adjustment mechanism that would place the \nsector on a stronger financial footing thereby encouraging more investments in the electricity sector. \nFor Roads financing, medium-term planning has begun and medium-term budgeting has been initiated \nby the Ministry of Public Works (MoPW) in close consultation with the Ministry of Finance (MoF) \nand the World Bank. For the Road Preservation Fund, presidential decrees are being drafted that will \nestablish management, organization and governance guidelines for the Fund. \nSub-National  Infrastructure.  In the water sector, an increasing number of PDAMs are being \nfinancially restructured, supported by a robust intercept mechanism which will allow the restarting of \npublic support for those utilities. Moreover, public support will be implemented through an output-\nbased Hibah grants mechanism that was recently initiated to increase connections as well as a \nguarantee/subsidy scheme for commercial bank lending to PDAMs. \nPublic-Private  Partnerships.  There  has  been  some  progress  in  the  area  of  Public  Private \nPartnerships (PPP). The financial architecture is almost complete as the Indonesia Infrastructure \nFinancing Facility JIFF) and the Indonesia Guarantee Fund (IGF) are both expected to become \noperational this year. Despite progress in the institutional set-up, the system remains challenged when \nit comes to supporting credible PPP transactions. \nEnvironment and Governance. Beyond hard infrastructure spending, the IDPL series has been \nhelpful in supporting and strengthening the governance of the MoPW in its basic operations and \npolicies. These include the introduction of electronically-based procurement systems as well as  \n \n \n \n ", "                                                                                                                     Appendix 4     29   \n \n \nthe introduction of Risk-Based Internal Audit programs throughout MoPW. The MoPW has initiated \naudit programs for its activities in up to 12 provincial offices. In the area of land acquisition, several \nministries and agencies are drafting a major piece of legislation governing land acquisition that will \nmake the process `faster' and `fairer' for all, particularly the poor. \nADB and JICA's Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program Loan \nThe IRSDP has supported the Government's strategy of accelerating infrastructure development \nthrough large-scale private sector participation. To provide a conducive environment for private \ninvestments, a comprehensive policy, regulatory and institutional framework, which is in line with \ninternational best practices, has been established. The new framework has still to pass the test of \nsuccessful implementation of public-private partnership projects in order to signal Indonesia's readiness \nfor private investment. The Government and development partners should therefore focus their efforts \non the preparation and execution of public private partnership (PPP) projects in the pipeline that could \nbe replicated in the future. \nThe IRSDP has highlighted the importance of having reform champions at the highest levels of the \nGovernment to provide guidance on the direction and pace of reforms, as well as of building up \nownership at the middle government levels and in state-owned enterprises to ensure effective reform \nimplementation. Given the natural inertia of these constituencies and the fact that some infrastructure \nreforms run counter to their interests, this task needs time and perseverance. \nGood governance in both public and private provision of infrastructure is central to ensuring mutual \naccountability.  The  Government  has  implemented  reforms  in  public  procurement  to  enhance \ntransparency and thereby reduce the scope for corruption. The new framework for private sector \nparticipation in infrastructure development has introduced transparency and competition into the \nselection of private sector sponsors, instead of the previous approach of direct negotiations. \nThe key bottleneck has been land acquisition and the prospects for addressing the land acquisition \nchallenge are increasingly positive. First, Perpres 1312010 requires that the central or local government \nhas to acquire land before a PPP project is tendered. Second, the Government is in the process of \ndeveloping a new Land Acquisition Law that is anticipated to be passed in early 2011. The proposed \nLaw will build on the previous reform measures to introduce compensation based on market rather \nthan taxable value, freezing land prices at a specific point in time for negotiation purposes, and setting \nup a predictable and time-bound system for negotiating and resolving the final payment to the \nlandowners. It will be important to continue to track developments related to streamlining land \nacquisition. \n    ", "30  Appendix 4  \n \n \n \nConcluding Remarks \nWe understand that infrastructure investment and maintenance is still too low in order to sustain current and \nobtain  targeted  economic  growth  rates.  The  creation  of  adequate  new  employment  opportunities  and \nexpanding access to basic infrastructure services will require vast improvements in basic transport, energy, \nwater provision and other infrastructure areas. However, we are pleased with the positive policy developments \nprovided by the World Bank, ADB and JICA support over the past four years, and believe that it has provided \na sound platform for further growth and future cooperation. \nYours Sincerely, \nMinister of Finance                            Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs \nRepublic of Indonesia  Republic of Indonesia \nAgus D.W.
