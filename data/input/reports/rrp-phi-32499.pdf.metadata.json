The  Project  will  also  help \nestablish  a  policy, \nregulatory  environment \nconducive  to  meeting  the  housing  needs  of  the  urban  poor  in \ninformal settlements. \n \nPoverty Intervention \nThematic: Human Development \n \nCategory B  \nInitial  environmental  examinations  of \ncore \nsubprojects  indicated  that  the  Project  will  have  mostly  beneficial \neffects, and that adverse effects can be mitigated. \n \nThe  Philippines  continues  to  urbanize  rapidly.  Over  half  of  the \npopulation  is  in  urban  areas,  and  this  proportion  is  expected  to \nreach  60%  by  2010  if  current  trends  continue.  Housing  and  land \nmarkets  have  not  kept  pace  with  rapid  urban  growth  and, \nconsequently, shelter is not affordable for the poor: more than 40% \nof urban families live in makeshift dwellings in informal settlements. \nWhile  official  data  indicate  that  only  about  20%  of  the  7.5  million \nurban  households  fall  below  the  poverty  income  line  (P13,915  per \ncapita per year as of 2001), the poverty income line alone does not \ncapture the dire situation of informal settlers. The urban poor lack of \naccess  to  (i)  affordable,  tenured,  serviced  land;  (ii)  appropriate \nhousing;  (iii)  shelter \ntargeted  and  sustainable \nsubsidies;  and  (v)  means  to  provide  their  own  shelter.  All  of  these \nproblems require sustainable solutions. \n \n\nfinancing;  (iv) \n\nrepresentative \n\n \nObjectives and Scope  The  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  reduce  income  poverty  and  improve \nquality-of-life for the urban poor. The purpose of the Project is to put \nin  place  systems  to  provide  affordable  housing  and  serviced  land \nfor the poor. In order to do this it will (i) improve the access of low-\nincome  urban \nto \nopportunities for upgraded and new housing; (ii) provide appropriate \n\ntenured,  serviced  plots  and \n\nfamilies \n\nto \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n\nExecuting Agencies \n\n \n\nfinance  for  shelter  and  other  services;  (iii)  strengthen  low-income \ncommunities  and  LGU  support  for  such  communities;  and  (iv) \nmobilize  communities  and  LGUs  to  participate  in  the  shelter \nprovision  and  finance  parts  of  the  Project.  This  will  be  achieved \nthrough  three  Project  components.  In  part  A,  DBP  will  relend  to \nqualified LGUs for site development. About 20,000 households will \ngain access to land tenure with basic infrastructure and services. In \npart B, DBP will establish shelter financing and microcredit facilities \nfor  the  potential  beneficiaries,  to  support  financing  for  (i)  serviced \nplots  and  house  improvements,  (ii)  new  housing  loans,  and  (iii) \nmicroenterprise  credit  facilities.  In  part  C,  DBP  and  HUDCC  will \nundertake  capacity  building  and  project  implementation  support \nthe \nprograms \ndecentralized shelter delivery mechanism. \n \nThe Project is expected to cost $48.8 million equivalent, comprising \n$34.3  million  equivalent  (70%)  in  local  currency  and  $14.5  million \n(30%) in foreign currency.  \n \n\nfor  communities  and  LGUs \n\nto  strengthen \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGrant Cofinancing \nConcessional Cofinancing \nNational Government \nDevelopment Bank of the \nPhilippines \nLocal Government Units \nBeneficiaries \nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange\n10.2 \n  0.5 \n3.8 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n20.3 \n0.8 \n1.2 \n3.5 \n1.1 \n\n($ million)\nTotal  Percent\n\n30.5 \n1.3 \n5.0 \n3.5 \n1.1 \n\n62.5\n2.7\n10.3\n7.2\n2.3\n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n  14.5 \n\n6.3 \n1.1 \n  34.3 \n\n6.3 \n1.1 \n  48.8 \n\n12.7\n2.3\n 100.0\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nA  loan  of  \u00a53,318,552,500  (equivalent  to  $30.5  million)  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB), a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee \nof  0.5%,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions set  forth  in  the  loan \nagreement. If ADB\u2019s Board of Directors does not approve the loan \nin  2003,  the  front-end  fee  will  revert  to  1.0%,  or  such  other \npercentage to be determined by the Board. \n \nUntil 31 December 2009 \n \nDBP will be the executing agency (EA) for parts A and B. For part \nC,  HUDCC  will  be  the  EA  for  the  shelter  sector  strengthening \nactivities,  while  DBP  will  be  the  EA  for  activities  related  to  project \nimplementation support.  \n \n \n\n\fImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n  v\n\nThe Project will be implemented over a 6-year period from 2003 to \n2009.  HUDCC  and  DBP  will  form  a  project  steering  committee. \nHUDCC  will  chair  the  committee  and  will  have  prime  responsibility \nfor overall sector policy actions and coordination. Each participating \nLGU  or  other  qualified  proponent  will  organize  a  subproject \nimplementation  unit  (SPIU)  to  ensure  the  project  is  executed \nefficiently  and  that  local  communities\u2019  priorities  are  incorporated  in \ndesign  and  implementation.  The  SPIU  will  include  community \nrepresentatives to ensure the proper implementation of community \naction  plans  and  resettlement  guidelines.  Involuntary  resettlement \nwill  be  minimal  as  existing  sites  will  be  upgraded  or  new  vacant \nsites will be developed.  \n \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  under  ADB  loans  applicable  to \ndevelopment finance institutions will be followed.  \n \nConsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. A \nteam of international and domestic project management consultants \nwill  help  the  project  management  offices  (PMOs)  implement, \nmanage, and monitor project activities. Consultants will help review \ncommunity  action  plans  and  contract  documents,  and  train  LGUs, \nmicrofinance  institutions,  and  the  PMOs  in  project  implementation, \ncommunity \nmonitoring,  evaluation, \nparticipation.  The  consultants  will  also  assist  HUDCC  in  sector \nstrengthening  activities \nthe \ndecentralized shelter delivery framework of the Project. Counterpart \nfunds  of  participating  LGUs  and  other  qualified  proponents  will \nfinance  the  SPIUs.  Domestic  consultants  are  required  for  these \nunits,  and  they  will  be  recruited  through  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB. \n \n30 June 2009 \n\nin  a  manner  consistent  with \n\nfinancial  aspects,  and \n\n \n31 December 2009 \n \nThe Project will support the poverty reduction goals of the Philippine \nGovernment  and  ADB,  and  will  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  urban \ninformal  settlers.  In  the  envisaged  site  and  services  development \nsubprojects,  land  ownership  issues  will  be  resolved  and  individual \ntitles  or  other  forms  of  secure  tenure  will  be  distributed,  directly \nbenefiting  20,000  poor  urban  households.  About  60  poor  urban \ncommunities,  largely  informal  settlement  areas,  are  expected  to \ndirectly  benefit \nthe  sites  and  services  development \nsubprojects,  and  at  least  another  60  nearby  communities  will \nindirectly  benefit \nflood \nprotection, roads, and drainage. Similar cases of site improvement \nhave  increased  land  values  by  200\u2013700%.  Significant  gains  will \naccrue to implementing agencies in the form of increased revenues \n\ninfrastructure, \n\nfrom  offsite \n\nincluding \n\nfrom \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nfrom  property  taxes,  and  to  beneficiaries  through  better  social, \nfinancial, and economic status. \n \nThe  microfinance  shelter  provision  component  will  benefit  over \n20,000  poor  urban  households.  Microfinance  for  small  enterprises \nwill  augment  the  income  of  beneficiaries  who  will  receive  the \nestimated  10,000  loans,  and  will  generate  employment  for  40,000 \nhouseholds and benefit as many as 100,000 poor urban residents. \nOverall,  the  Project  is  expected  to  have  a  poverty  impact  ratio  of \nmore than 0.66. \n \nThe  key  risks  to  the  Project  are  the  possibilities  of  faltering \ncommitment of national and local governments in providing shelter \nfor  the  poor  in  a  sustainable  manner.  In  particular,  at  the  national \nlevel, the key assumption is that the Government will not undercut \nthe provision of market-based finance by subsidizing interest rates. \nAt the local level, the Project assumes that political commitment to \nmarket-based, \nacross \nadministrations.  This  assumption  is  well  justified  in  the  present \ndifficult budgetary assessment, as it is unlikely that the Government \ncan  afford  subsidies  required  for  other  approaches.  A  proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  will  address  risks  associated  with  timely \nimplementation  and  subproject  approval  through  effective  capacity \nbuilding  for  the  PMO.  Risks  associated  with  financial  capacities  of \nLGUs  are  addressed  by  careful  screening  of  applicants  and  by \neliciting  a  pipeline  of  more  subprojects  than  the  Project  is  likely  to \nprocess, allowing for dropouts. The risks associated with subsidies \nand  titling  will  also  be  addressed  by  capacity-building  support  to \nboth HUDCC and DBP.  \n \n\nhousing  will \n\nlow-income \n\ncontinue \n\n \nTechnical Assistance  ADB will provide a $1.5 million TA on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding  program.  The  TA  will  provide  capacity  building  for  DBP, \nHUDCC,  LGUs,  community-based  organizations,  and  microfinance \ninstitutions.  \n \n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), to be guaranteed by the Republic of the \nPhilippines, for the Development of Poor Urban Communities Sector Project; and (ii) proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building for Housing Microfinance. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nIn November 1999, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a project preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  (PPTA)  to  prepare  the  Development  of  Poor  Urban  Communities  Sector \nProject (the Project). The PPTA was carried out from June 2000 to May 2001.1 With the help of \nthe  PPTA,  the  Housing  and  Urban  Development  Coordinating  Council  (HUDCC)  designed  a \ndecentralized investment project in line with the poverty reduction and shelter strategies of the \nPhilippine  Government,  and  prepared  a  feasibility  study  on  shelter  improvement  for  informal \nsettlers  in  urban  areas,  which  was  approved  by  the  Investment  Coordination  Committee \n(Cabinet  Committee)  on  24  February  2003.  The  Project  incorporates  lessons  learned  from \nongoing Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction projects in Payatas and Muntinlupa. The proposed \nProject  was  formulated  using  a  sample  of  eight  pilot  communities.  Its  design  incorporates \nfeedback from consultations with the Government and target beneficiaries. This report is based \non  the  findings  of  the  appraisal  mission  conducted  intermittently  in  March  and  April  2003;  the \nreports of PPTA consultants; and discussions with national and local governments, international \nassistance  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  beneficiaries.  During  the \ndiscussions, the proposed executing agencies (EAs), the Government, DBP, and ADB agreed \non  the  goals,  objectives,  scope,  scale,  cost  estimates,  and  financing  plans.  The  project \nframework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nA.  \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nThe urban population of the Philippines grew from 8 million in 1960 to 39 million in 2000. \nBy 2010, about 54 million\u2014over 60% of the population, from the present 52%\u2014will be living in \nurban areas. Although the official data on poverty indicate that only about 21% of the 7.5 million \nurban households fall below the poverty income line of $265.04 (P13,915) per capita per year, \nat  least  47%  of  urban  households  live  in  informal  settlements2  and  over  60%  of  urban \nhouseholds consider themselves poor, according to an independent survey. \n \nThe housing and land markets have not kept pace with rapid urban growth. Each year in \n4. \nthe  last  decade,  the  private  sector  supplied  only  about  50,000  housing  units\u2014largely  for \nnonpoor  families\u2014while  the  Government-led  shelter  program  provided  only  about  120,000 \n\u201cunits  of  housing  assistance.\u201d3  Unmet  housing  demand  as  of  the  year  2000  was  about  2.4 \nmillion  units.  The  shortfall  is  concentrated  in  low-income  housing  where  (i)  the  population  is \nleast able to match rising land and house construction costs; and (ii) the market has not been \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  1999.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Development  of  Poor  Urban \nCommunities  Project.  Manila.  (TA  3291-PHI,  for  $850,000,  approved  on  10  November  1999,  with  supplementary \nTA, for $150,000 approved on 2 April 2002). \n\n2  Typically, households have built on land they occupy illegally, with minimal access to basic services such as water \n\nsupply and drainage. \n\n3  Housing accomplishment under the National Shelter Program includes, as indicators of performance, the provision \nof housing assistance, i.e., various services performed toward the completion of a housing unit. Hence, a housing \nunit  in  the  process  of  completion  could  receive  several  financing,  loan  guarantee,  and  technical  services,  all \ncounted as different units of housing assistance. These performance indicators, together with a detailed analysis of \nthe sector, are included in ADB. 2001. Philippine Housing Sector Profile. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\nable  to  provide  affordable,  conveniently  located  housing.  As  a  consequence,  informal  housing \nareas and squatter settlements have proliferated in urban areas. \n \n5. \nMore than one third of urban families live in makeshift dwellings. Rental housing markets \nare almost nonexistent because of strict rent-control laws. Access to land is a key constraint on \nhousing for the urban poor. Market-based approaches must be found to close the gap between \ndemand and supply, and to enable the sector to provide low-cost housing, financing, sites, and \nservices. \n \n6. \nAn investment of P432 billion will be required to meet the housing shortage, assuming a \nceiling of P180,000 per unit as defined by Government for housing for low-income families.4 The \nGovernment cannot bear this financial burden alone. Resolution 012 of the HUDCC created the \nmultiwindow lending system in 1996 to (i) improve the efficiency of shelter finance by making it \nmore market-based, (ii) introduce mandatory fund allocation from participating institutions, and \n(iii) transfer the credit risk from the Government to participating financial institutions. However, \nthe housing finance system benefits mostly formal sector employees, especially active members \nof  the  Social  Security  System,  the  Government  Service  Insurance  System,  and  the  Home \nDevelopment Mutual Fund.5 The only program that addresses the need for shelter financing for \nthe poor is the Community Mortgage Program (CMP), which finances the acquisition of lots and \nlow-cost  shelter.  However,  it  suffers  from  several  structural  weaknesses,  such  as  highly \ncentralized management, delays in processing, lack of funds, and lack of trained personnel and \nresources to handle the time-consuming collection of small loans. Only a few local government \nunits  (LGUs)  have  used  the  CMP  to  help  poor  urban  communities,  and  many  others  have \nstopped originating projects altogether. \n \n7. \nExternal  assistance  has  been  provided  to  sector  institutions  (Appendix  2),  but  the \nmajority of recent assistance has supported decentralization by strengthening LGUs, particularly \nthrough citywide infrastructure projects. The Project does not duplicate any ongoing assistance. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n8. \nIn  the  past,  slum-upgrading  projects  tended  to  emphasize  physical  improvement  and \ndirect  provision  of  housing.  The  impact  of  such  approaches  was  usually  limited  to  specific \nlocalities,  which  in  many  cases  reverted  to  slum  conditions  after  the  projects  because  of  poor \nmaintenance  and  lack  of  ownership.  Access  to  affordable  land,  with  title,  remains  essential  to \nmeeting  the  shelter  needs  of  urban  poor  families.  Better  infrastructure  also  needs  to  be \nprovided. Appropriate finance would enable the poor to pay for their land, services, and housing \nimprovements.  The  current  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  projects  in  Payatas  and \nMuntinlupa  are  providing  valuable \nin  shelter  and \ninfrastructure provision and financing, and in livelihood support, which have been applied to the \ndesign of this Project. \n \n9. \n \n(i) \n\nExtend  access  to  shelter  finance  system  and  enhance  sustainability  of  this \nsystem. This requires action with microfinance institutions (MFIs) on interest rates and \non the subsidy mechanism. To institutionalize accessible financing mechanisms through \n\nThe key opportunities for support to the sector are as follows: \n\nin  community  mobilization, \n\nlessons \n\n                                                 \n4  This estimate will increase with upward adjustments in the Government\u2019s ceiling for socialized housing. \n5  The fund is a provident savings system funded by voluntary contributions from Government and private employees, \n\nand mandatory counterpart contributions from employers.  \n\n\f \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n3 \n\nMFIs, better mechanisms are required for the poor to finance their shelter and livelihood \nneeds. Whatever microcredit is available is generally unsuitable for housing finance as it \nis short-term and comes at high interest rates. Policy dialogue has focused on the need \nto develop mechanisms through MFIs to encourage savings and make Government-run \nfunds  more  accessible  to  the  urban  poor.  The  Government  has  been  indirectly \nsubsidizing the socialized housing program through regulated interest rates. This causes \nmarket distortions and discourages the private sector from providing funds for socialized \nhousing.  The  Government  is  committed  to  introducing  market-based  interest  rates  for \nshelter finance in the longer term, but mechanisms must first be found to do this while \nmaintaining  affordability  for  the  poor  and  protecting  the  poorest.  Interest-rate  subsidies \nare  costly  to  the  community,  poorly  targeted,  and  unsustainable  for  subsidizing \nsocialized  housing.  The  Project \nfinance, \nfocused  on \ndecentralizing subsidy programs, and targeting subsidies to the poor. \n\nintroducing  market-rate \n\nFacilitate  land  tenure.  The  provision  of  land  tenure  could  be  facilitated  through  the \nsubdivision  of  surplus  government  land  or  through  the  purchase  of  private  land.  The \nurban  poor  who  purchase  lots  through  the  CMP\u2014the  Government\u2019s  flagship  pro-poor \nhousing program\u2014can take up to 25 years to obtain a clear land title since the process \nentails  168  steps  involving  53  public  and  private  agencies.  For  the  capital  value  of  a \nhouse and lot to be useful to its low-income occupants, there must be some interim form \nof  tenure  that  financial  institutions  would  recognize.  Land  development  regulations, \nincluding land titling, permit issuance, and licensing procedures, need to be streamlined.  \n\nIncrease  private-sector  participation.  The  private  sector  is  not  involved  in  socialized \nhousing, apart from applying 20% of housing development costs to socialized housing, a \npolicy  that  is  poorly  enforced  and  ineffective.  Private  sector  involvement  in  this  market \nsegment  is  constrained  by  low  profits  and  interest-rate  distortions.  The  Government \nagrees  to  review  the  20%  rule  and  explore  alternative,  more  transparent  mechanisms \nsuch as development impact fees. \n\nEnhance the effectiveness of sector institutions. The project design focuses on the \nneed  to  clarify  institutional  responsibilities,  rationalize  the  functions  of  national  sector \ninstitutions,  and  strengthen  their  capacity  to  carry  out  their  mandated  roles  effectively. \nShelter  is  a  mandated  local  government  activity  that  many  LGUs  have  neglected.  The \nstrategic development planning and fiscal and management capacities of LGUs must be \nstrengthened to enable them to tackle this issue effectively.  \n\n \n10. \nThese  challenges  provide  the  basis  for  the  central  objectives  in  the  Government\u2019s \nhousing  policy  and  have  been  key  considerations  in  preparing  the  project  design.  The  project \nframework set out in Appendix 1 shows how the Project will find serviced, tenured plots; provide \nappropriate  shelter  finance;  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  sector  institutions.  Parallel \nGovernment policy action is set out in a time-bound action plan in Appendix 3. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nObjectives \n\n \nA. \n \n11. \nThe  Project  focuses  on  making  a  direct  and  significant  contribution  to  the  overall \nreduction  of  both  income-  and  asset-based  poverty.  The  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i) \nimprove  the  access  of  poor  urban  households  to  secure  land  tenure,  affordable  shelter,  basic \nmunicipal  infrastructure,  services,  and  community  facilities;  (ii)  improve  access  to  financial \n\n\f4 \n\nservices for housing improvement and livelihood; and (iii) help decentralize shelter activities and \nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  LGUs  to  meet  their  sector  mandates  as  set  out  in  the  Local \nGovernment  Code.  The  Project  is  a  sector  project  and  will  be  available  to  all  cities  and  first-\nclass municipalities outside Metro Manila. The Project will address the underlying weaknesses \nin the present subsidy policy and institutional environment that contribute to widespread urban \npoverty, to the vulnerability of the poor, and to their exclusion from mainstream society. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n12. \nThe  proposed  Project  comprises  three  parts.  In  part  A,  new  and  existing  sites  will  be \ndeveloped to provide affordable secure tenure6 and infrastructure services for urban families in \nthe  lowest  five  income  deciles.  The  Project  will  target  poor  communities  where  the  majority  is \nbelow the poverty line. In part B, shelter financing mechanisms will be established, using MFIs \nand  other  qualifying  intermediaries  to  support  (i)  purchase  of  serviced  plot  and  house \nimprovements, and (ii) microenterprise credit facilities. Participating MFIs will be prequalified by \nDBP using agreed criteria and may include thrift banks, rural banks, microfinance NGOs, credit \ncooperatives,  and  savings  and  loan  institutions.  In  part  C,  capacity  building  and  project \nimplementation support programs will be implemented to improve decentralized shelter delivery. \nThe programs will include (i) project implementation support to assist in overall project planning, \ncoordination,  management,  advocacy,  and  subproject  appraisal;  (ii)  support  for  community-\ndriven planning for sustainable development of sites under part A; (ii) capacity building for LGUs \nto enable them to plan,  initiate development of,  and finance their role in appropriate, inclusive \nshelter projects; and (iii) strengthening the capacity of MFIs to provide finance under part B. \n \n \n\nPart A: Site Development and Tenure Distribution  \n\n1. \n\n13. \nIn part A, DBP will relend to qualified LGUs, or other project proponents with the support \nof LGUs, to enable the detailed design and provision of secure, serviced plots in existing low-\nincome  neighborhoods  and  at  new  sites.  Project  proponents  will  include  private  socialized \nhousing developers, NGOs, and cooperatives approved by DBP. About 20,000 households will \ngain  access  to  land  tenure,  basic  infrastructure,  and  services.  Subprojects  will  include \nappropriate and affordable offsite infrastructure. Priority infrastructure and service requirements \nare likely to comprise access roads, alleys, footpaths, water supply and drainage, sanitation and \nsolid  waste  management,  and  basic  community  facilities.  Community  services  important  to  an \nimproved  quality  of  life  in  the  subproject  area  may  also  be  included,  as  agreed  between  the \ncommunity and the LGU. This prioritization and agreement is undertaken through a participatory \nplanning process in the community referred to  as the community action plan (CAP). The sites \nmay  be  (i)  areas  already  occupied  by  informal  settlers,  where  the  agency  responsible  has \nagreed  that  secure  tenure  will  be  provided  and  existing  infrastructure  and  services  upgraded \n(about 30 sites with over 8,000 households); or (ii) vacant lots acquired specifically for poor and \nlow-income housing (about 30 sites for over 10,000 households). LGUs will provide necessary \nonsite and offsite infrastructure and services, according to physical requirements and based on \ncommunity needs and preferences. LGU assistance can expedite the processes of subdividing \na  title  on  a  government-owned  site  and  subdividing  LGU-owned  land.  The  Project  has  also \nidentified  land-lease  forms  that  can  be  used  to  access  shelter  finance  when  freehold  title  is \ninappropriate or impossible. The typical design of the sites is in Appendix 4, and the affordability \nanalysis, taking into account the financing arrangements set out on the following paragraphs, in \nAppendix 5. \n \n\n                                                 \n6  Secure tenure, as defined by  the Project, includes the provision of lots, houses, or house and lot packages.  \n\n\f5 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nPart B: Shelter Finance for Low-Income Communities \n\n14. \nIn  part  B,  DBP  will  relend  to  locally  identified  intermediaries,  which  will  onlend  to  poor \nand  low-income  households.  The  intermediaries  will  mainly  be  qualifying  MFIs,  but  other \nqualified financial institutions with an established track record in mortgage and/or microfinance \nlending may be approved for participation as appropriate. Families in the informal sector often \ndo  not  have  access  to  the  formal  financial  system,  which  requires  borrowers  to  have  regular, \npredictable  incomes  and  collateral.  They  are  thus  denied  the  credit  needed  to  achieve  formal \ntenure  and  upgrade  their  housing.  Government  is  unable  to  provide  the  required  subsidies  to \nencourage  formal  financial  institutions  to  lend  to  this  group,  and  centralized  shelter  agencies \nlack capacity to manage such a program. Shelter finance using microfinance strategies presents \nan alternative for decentralized financing. The proposed loans are described below. \n \n\nB1:  microfinance  for  home  improvement.  About  2,3007  subloans  of  up  to \n$1,430  (P75,000  or  $380  [P20,000]  on  average),  repayable  in  up  to  5  years  by \nthe  beneficiaries,  will  be  made  available  through  accredited  MFIs  for  plot \nimprovements. \n\nB2:  microfinance  for  small  enterprises.  About  10,0008  subloans  of  up  to \n$2,800  (P150,000  or  $475  [P25,000]  on  average),  and  repayable  in  up  to  5 \nyears,  will  be  made  available  to  enterprises  typically  engaged  in  noncrop \nagriculture,  trading,  food  and  agroprocessing,  manufacturing,  transport,  and \nother income-generating enterprises. \n\nB3:  housing  loans.  Loans  will  be  available  for  serviced  lots  and  structures  on \nnew sites being developed under the site development component, or elsewhere, \nprovided  the  prospective  borrower  can  present  legal  proof  of  land  tenure.  The \nloans, of terms up to 15 years long, will range from $380 (P20,000) for a core unit \nto  $4,285  (P225,000)9  for  a  basic  house,  and  will  average  $1,528  (P80,000). \nMFIs  would  onlend  about  12,000  subloans  for  housing.  These  loans  will  be \neligible for guarantee coverage from the Home Guaranty Corporation (HGC). As \npart of their loan repayments, beneficiaries will pay a small fee for the guarantee \nthrough the MFI to the HGC. The guaranty mechanism is financially sustainable. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nPart C: Capacity Building and Implementation Support \n\nIn part C,  HUDCC will take the lead in strengthening the decentralized shelter delivery \n15. \nframework and DBP will lead project implementation support. The capacity-building and project \nimplementation  support  programs, \nthrough  cofinancing  grants  and/or \nconcessional  credit,  will  comprise  two  components.  ADB  will  also  provide  TA  for  capacity \nbuilding described in Section IV. \n \n\nfinanced \n\nto  be \n\n(i) \n\nC1:  sector  strengthening  and  project  implementation  support.  Additional \nconsulting services to those procured under parts A and B will be provided to the \nproject  management  office  (PMO)  at  HUDCC  for  sector  strengthening,  and  the \nPMO  at  DBP  for  project  implementation  support.  Consulting  services  will  (i) \nassist  the  EAs  in  project  planning,  coordination,  management,  evaluation, \n\n                                                 \n7  Based on surveys made in the pilot communities during the PPTA. \n8  Based on the estimates of the PPTA consultants. \n9  This amount may  be revised to conform with the Government\u2019s ceiling for socialized housing.  \n\n\f6 \n\nsupervision, and monitoring; (ii) assist the LGUs and communities in subproject \npreparation,  appraisal,  design,  supervision,  and  monitoring;  and  (iii)  support \ntechnical  tasks.  Specific  technical  tasks  will  include  (i)  establishing  and \nimplementing a transparent and directly targeted subsidy scheme, (ii) supporting \nMFIs  in  enhancing  systems  for  operating  and  monitoring  appropriate  lending \nproducts, (iii) developing a public land inventory for the Project, (iv) promoting the \nProject  among  target  communities,  and  (v)  helping  coordinate  capacity  building \nand  community-driven  planning.  Various  aspects  of  these  services  will  be \nfinanced from Cities Alliance and German grant funds. \n\n(ii) \n\nC2:  LGU  financial  strengthening  for  shelter  provision.  This  component  will \nentail developing capability in geographic information system (GIS)  mapping for \nproperty and other tax enhancement, as well as for use in strategic planning and \npoverty  mapping.  The  component  will  be  funded  by  concessional  finance  from \nthe Government of Finland. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n16. \nThe Project addresses the key constraints to providing affordable shelter to low-income \ngroups.  It  provides  mechanisms  for  enhancing  security  of  tenure  in  a  context  where  previous \ninitiatives  have  had  very  limited  success.  The  CMP  requires  interest  rate  subsidies,  which \ndiscourage  participation  of  private-sector  financial  institutions.  Owing  to  government  fiscal \nconstraints,  topping  up  funds  for  disbursement  under  the  program  is  very  slow.  The  use  of \ngroup  titles  weakens  collateral.  Almost  no  infrastructure  upgrading  is  undertaken  under  the \nCMP, even though this is theoretically possible, as CMP schemes are stalled at land acquisition. \nThe  proposed  Project  addresses  these  structural  difficulties.  Part  A  facilitates  physical \nimprovements in slum areas, and new site development affordable to the poor, where previous \npolicies  have  failed  to  provide  supply  at  pace  with  demand.  Part  B  provides  incremental \nfinancing  for  shelter  on  appropriate  terms  and  through  financing  mechanisms  linked  to  the \nformal financial system, thus bridging the gap between these institutions and the poor. Because \nrepayment  records  for  government  housing  schemes  are  unsatisfactory,  the  Project  uses \ntargeted  subsidies  to  achieve  affordability,  but  retains  an  incentive  for  the  poor  to  pay  and  for \nfinancial institutions to be proactive in ensuring repayment. The Project avoids the past practice \nof distorting interest rates, relying instead on targeted capital subsidies to achieve affordability. \nPart C ensures the sustainability of the Project.  \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n17. \nThe total project cost is estimated at $48.8 million equivalent, comprising $14.5 million in \nforeign exchange costs (including about $1.8 million in interest during construction), and $34.3 \nmillion equivalent in local currency costs.  \n\n18. \nThe total cost is based on estimates prepared for eight pilot subprojects in four LGUs in \nLuzon,  the  Visayas,  and  Mindanao.10  These  estimates  indicate  an  average  base  cost  of \n$191,390  (P10.048  million)  per  site  for  basic  urban  services  and  land  acquisition  costs  at  32 \nexisting sites, and $301,900 (P15.848 million) per site for 34 new sites. Project cost estimates \nare summarized in Table 1 and detailed in Appendix 6. \n\n                                                 \n10 The  LGUs  are  Angeles  City,  Bacolod  City,  Cagayan  de  Oro  City,  and  Talisay  (a  first-class  municipality  recently \n\nreclassified into a city). \n\n\f7 \n\nA summary of the proposed financing plan is shown in Table 2. ADB will finance about \n19. \n$30.5  million  equivalent,  or  62.5%,  of  the  estimated  project  cost.  The  proposed  ADB  loan  will \ncover  $10.2  million  in  foreign  exchange  costs,  including  interest  and  other  charges  during \nconstruction, and $20.3 million equivalent of the local currency costs. The proceeds will be used \nto  finance  parts  A  and  B.  DBP  and  the  lending  intermediaries  will  provide  counterpart \ncontributions of up to $1.1 million equivalent for project management and as equity contributions \nfor  part  B.  The  Government  and  LGUs  will  provide  local  currency  financing  of  $9.8  million \nequivalent, or about 19.9% of the estimated project cost. Cofinancing from bilateral agencies is \nproposed  to  fund  part  C.  Grant  cofinancing  of  about  $1.3  million  equivalent,  or  2.7%  of  the \nestimated  project  cost,  will  be  required.  Concessional  credit  cofinancing  of  about  $5  million \nequivalent, or 10.3% of the estimated Project cost, will also be required.11 The beneficiaries will \ncontribute $1.1 million equivalent in local currency costs in the form of equity participation.  \n\n20. \nDBP  has  requested  a  loan  of  \u00a53,318,552,500  ($30.5  million  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  6 \nyears,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  lending  facility  based  on  the \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR), a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and a front-\nend  fee  of  0.5%.  The  fee  will  be  capitalized  in  the  loan.  If  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  does  not \napprove  the  loan  in  2003,  the  front-end  fee  will  revert  to  1.0%,  or  a  rate  determined  by  the \nBoard of Directors. DBP has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an \nundertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The Government will guaranty the proposed loan to DBP \nfor an annual fee of 1%, and will cover the foreign exchange risk for a fee to be agreed with the \nDepartment of Finance. \n\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nComponent/Subcomponent \n\nA.

The  Government  will  partially  subsidize  land  acquisition \ncosts  for  eligible  beneficiaries.  Once  a  subloan  for  site  development  is  approved,  the \nparticipating  LGU  or  other  proponent  will  first  mobilize  counterpart  contributions  for  activities \nsuch as land acquisition and detailed engineering design. For part B, the financing mix is based \non (i) proceeds of the ADB loan, (ii) contributions from DBP and lending intermediaries, and (iii) \nequity contributions of beneficiaries. Financing-sharing mechanisms are summarized in Table 3. \nThe  ADB  loan  will  fund  about  90%  of  total  relending  for  part  B.  Appendix  7  presents  the \nfinancing arrangements and fund flow for parts A and B. \n\n2.    Relending and Onlending  \n\n22. \nUnder part A, ADB loan proceeds will be re-lent to participating LGUs or private-sector \ngroups in association with LGUs. The subloan to a selected LGU will be for a term of 10 years, \nincluding a 3-year grace period, at a market-determined interest rate currently estimated at 9%.  \n\n23. \nUnder  part  B,  loan  proceeds  will  be  re-lent  to  qualified  financial  intermediaries  through \nsubsidiary loans. For the housing loan component, DBP subloans will have a term of up to 15 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years  and  an  interest  rate  determined  by  the  market \n(currently  approximately  9%).  Beneficiaries  will  contribute  at  least  5%  equity.  Onlending  to \neligible beneficiaries will be at the prevailing market interest rate for  a term of up  to 15 years. \nFor home improvement and microfinance for small enterprises, DBP will also channel the funds \nthrough  financial  intermediaries  at  appropriate  market  interest  rates.  These  intermediaries  will \nonlend at the appropriate market rate for each financial product concerned. DBP subloans to the \nparticipating financial intermediaries will also be repayable in up to 15 years, including a 3-year \ngrace period. For the microenterprise loans, DBP intermediary financial institutions will onlend to \nbeneficiaries  according  to  the  implementing  rules  for  microfinance  of  the  Bangko  Sentral  ng \nPilipinas12 (Circular 272, Series of 2001), and subsequent modifications.  \n\n                                                 \n12 Central Bank of the Philippines. \n\n\f9 \n\n \nTotal \nCost \n(%) \n \n\n100.0 \n\n100.0 \n\n \n\n100.0 \n\n100.0 \n\n \n \n\nComponent/Subcomponent \n\nTable 3: Financing-Sharing Arrangements \n \n\nRelending \n\nADB \n(%) \n\nDBP/MFI \n(%) \n\n \nGov\u2019t \nEquitya \n(%) \n \n\n \nLGU \nEquity a \n(%) \n \n\n \nBeneficiaries\u2019 \nEquity \n(%) \n \n\n1.

The  subsidy  is  in  most  cases  provided  through  a  reduction  in  land  prices.  This \nscheme avoids distorting interest rate subsidies as required under the Medium-Term Philippine \nDevelopment Plan. Subsidies are targeted, as they will be provided to residents in slums. The \nsubsidy is graduated: destitute households will get the full benefit of upgrading investments but \nwill  pay  only  nominal  land  rent.  Other  households  will  obtain  title  and  may  still  receive  a  land \nprice  subsidy,  particularly  in  cases  where  land  costs  have  become  prohibitive  because  of \ninefficiencies in the urban land market. \n\n25. \nHUDCC  has  pledged  to  contribute  at  least  220  hectares  of  public  land  for  the  Project.  \nThe net sales proceeds from national land contribution (estimated at about $2.8 million) will be \ndeposited in a shelter finance trust account (SFTA), to be established and administered by the \nNational Housing Authority (NHA) in accordance with a directive to be issued by HUDCC. At the \nLGU level, a parallel local shelter finance fund (LSFF) for the proceeds of LGU land sold under \nthe Project will be established, as needed, before DBP releases the subloan. The LSFF will be \nestablished in accordance with the Local Government Code to recycle the proceeds of the sale \nof LGU-owned lands. These proceeds will be used in subsequent projects as a mechanism for \nadditional  capital  subsidy.  The  funds  will  enable  a  more  flexible  approach  to  ensuring \naffordability  than  in  previous  projects,  where  participating  landowners  usually  provided  a \nsubstantial price subsidy. The project steering committee or its successor agency will approve \nthe use of an SFTA subsidy for purchase of private land (voluntarily sold at market value) for a \nqualifying project. The local housing board will approve the use of LSFFs for the same purpose \nat the LGU level. \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\n1. \n\nCoordination \n\n DBP will be the EA for parts A and B. For part C, HUDCC will be the EA for the sector \n26. \nstrengthening activities, while DBP will be the EA for activities related to project implementation \nsupport. HUDCC will establish a PMO with a designated full-time project manager to undertake \n\n\f10 \n\nthe  technical  and  administrative  aspects  of  strengthening  the  decentralized  shelter  delivery \nframework.  DBP  will  also  establish  a  PMO  to  (i)  promote  the  Project  to  the  targeted  end-\nbeneficiaries,  (ii)  assist  LGUs,  MFIs,  and  other  proponents  in  subproject  development  and \nimplementation,  (iii)  evaluate  the  technical,  financial  and  economic,  social,  and  environmental \nviability  of  proposed  subprojects,  (iv)  conduct  project  supervision  and  monitoring,  and  (v) \nestablish the project performance monitoring system (PPMS).    \n\n27.      An interagency project steering committee (PSC), chaired by HUDCC, will be formed to \nprovide  policy  guidance,  implement  policy  reforms  (Appendix  3),  and  give  overall  direction.  Its \nmembers will include representatives of DOF, DBP, HGC, National Economic and Development \nAuthority (NEDA),  and other appropriate agencies and stakeholders. The PSC will (i) oversee \nproject implementation in conformity with the Project\u2019s development objectives and scope; and \n(ii)  assist  in  coordination  among  government  agencies  involved  in  project  implementation  and \npolicy reforms. A project management secretariat (PMS), comprising personnel of HUDCC and \nDBP, will constitute the technical working group of the PSC to ensure coordinated and efficient \nproject and project implementation activities. An organization chart for project implementation is \nin Appendix 8. \n\nA  team  of  consultants  will  assist  the  PMO  in  project  implementation  and  capacity \n\n28. \nbuilding. DBP and HUDCC have agreed to provide office space for these consultants. \n\n29. \nEach participating LGU or other project proponents will set up an SPIU. For LGUs, the \nSPIU  will  be  attached  to  the  city  or  municipal  planning  and  development  office,  or  its  housing \nboard,  if  one  exists.  The  SPIU  will  be  headed  by  a  representative  of  the  local  housing  board, \nwho  will  be  supported  by  leaders  of  the  local  community  organizations  or  NGOs.  It  will  be \nresponsible for implementing the subproject components in coordination with DBP\u2019s PMO. The \nSPIU  will  be  assisted  by  a  team  of  local  consultants,  if  necessary,  in  (i)  preparing  community \naction  plans,  detailed  engineering  drawings,  community  contracting  or \nlocal  bidding \narrangements,  and  bid  documents;  (ii)  evaluating  bids;  (iii)  awarding  and  supervising \nconstruction contracts;  and (iv) exercising quality control strategies and schemes. In the case of \nother proponents, the SPIU will be staffed with experienced professionals from its organization. \nDBP\u2019s  PMO  will  approve  the  key  positions  and  staff  to  be  assigned  by  the  proponent  to  the \nSPIU. A qualified representative from a local housing board is eligible to become a member of \nthe  proponent\u2019s  SPIU.  For  its  sector  strengthening  activities,  HUDCC\u2019s  PMO  will  work  and \ncoordinate with the SPIUs.  \n\n2. \n\nDevelopment Bank of the Philippines \n\n30. \nDBP is a wholly Government-owned development finance institution. It was established \nas  the  Rehabilitation  Finance  Corporation  in  1947  and  has  gained  relevant  capacity  for  LGU \nfinancing by implementing four ADB-supported projects. Its mission is to provide medium- and \nlong-term financing to Philippine financial institutions, enterprises, and LGUs. This mandate has \nbeen  broadened  to  include  universal  banking.  DBP  is  exempt  from  the  Government\u2019s  public \nservice compensation system. \n\n31. \nDBP\u2019s total assets grew at an average annual rate of 12.6% from 1995 to 2002. In 2002, \nits  total  assets  reached  $2.95  billion  (P148.64  billion),  up  7.0%  from  the  previous  year.  Total \nliabilities  also  rose  during  1995\u20132002,  growing  by  an  annual  average  of  14.0%  and  outpacing \ntotal asset growth. Total liabilities increased by 6.6% from $2.59 billion (P129.5 billion) in 2002. \nDeposit  mobilization  has  demonstrated  encouraging  results.  Capital  adequacy,  asset  quality, \nmanagement, earnings, and liquidity ratios are all satisfactory. \n\n\f11 \n\nTo ensure the financial viability of the DBP loan and sound financial management, DBP \n32. \nwill  maintain  a  capital  adequacy  ratio  of  at  least  10%\u2014in  keeping  with  the  requirement  of  the \nBangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas\u2014and  provide  solid  provisioning  for  asset  quality.  The  financial \nstatus of DBP is in Appendix 9. \n\n3. \n\nCapacity Building and Project Implementation \n\n33. \nHUDCC  and  DBP  will  be  joint  EAs  for  the  grant-funded  implementation  support  and \ncapacity  building  component  (part  C).  HUDCC  will  have  primary  responsibility  for  capacity \nbuilding of the shelter sector, while DBP will have primary responsibility for components directly \nrelated to implementation support. Both DBP and HUDCC will deal with common issues related \nto  LGUs,  CAP  preparation,  and  strengthening  MFIs  and  community-based  organizations \n(CBOs). These activities must be coordinated between DBP and HUDCC for efficient subproject \nidentification  and  preparation.  Project  implementation  support  consultants  will  ensure  that  this \ncoordination occurs. \n\n4. \n\nSelection and Preparation of Subprojects \n\n34. \nEligibility  criteria,  selection  mechanisms,  subproject  preparation,  and  appraisal \nprocedures have been agreed upon with HUDCC and DBP. The first three subloans for parts A \nand B will be submitted to ADB for review and approval. Subloans for parts A and B submitted \nfor  review,  may  be  from  the  same  subproject.  Subsequent  subprojects  will  not  require  ADB \nreview and approval unless the subloan is more than $2 million. \n\na. \n\nPart A: Eligibility and Selection Criteria for LGUs  \n\n35. \nThe  PMS  will  determine  the  eligibility  of  an  LGU  or  other  project  proponent  in \naccordance with the following criteria: (i) be located, or have a project, in a city or a first-class \nmunicipality  outside  Metro  Manila;  (ii)  demonstrate  financial  capacity  to  borrow,  based  on \nborrowing  capacity  certified  by  DOF,  or  other  collateral  acceptable  to  DBP  and  ADB;  (iii) \ndemonstrate  that  it  can  generate  surplus  income  for  the  next  3  years,  including  project \nexpenses, by providing revenue and expenditure projections endorsed by the LGU treasurer or \na qualified accountant acceptable to DBP; and (iv) have no adverse reports from its banks and \nsuppliers. \n\n36. \nTo  be  selected,  an  eligible  LGU  must  have  (i)  inadequate  housing  and  services,  as \nevidenced  by  the  existence  of  slum  or  squatter  communities  in  its  area  of  jurisdiction  and \nsupported by an endorsement letter from the Regional Development Council and a resolution of \nthe Local Development Council; (ii) nationally- or locally-owned government land with potential \nfor  inclusion  in  the  subproject,  or  privately  owned  land  where  the  proponent  has  confirmed  in \nwriting the intent to provide housing at a price affordable by the fifth income decile or lower; (iii) \ninterest  in  and  commitment  to  the  Project,  expressed  in  a  letter  of  intent  from  the  mayor \nconfirming  that  the  LGU  will  participate,  modify,  and  adjust  its  local  land-use  planning  and \nproperty  tax  management  system,  if  recommended  in  capacity  building;  (iv)  the  technical  and \nadministrative capacity to undertake institutional capacity building and subproject management; \n(v) the capacity and willingness to contribute equity; and (vi) willingness to establish a housing \nboard,  and  an  LSFF  where  local  government  land  is  used,  serviced  by  a  secretariat  that \nspecializes  in  housing  and  the  urban  poor,  or  at  least  a  written  commitment  to  create  such  a \nboard.  Other  project  proponents  must  also  demonstrate  that  they  have  (i)  clear  title  to  the \nproject land, and (ii) the capacity and willingness to manage the subproject. \n\n\f12 \n\nb.  \n\nPart B: Qualification and Selection of MFIs \n\n37. \nThe  PMS  will  determine  the  eligibility  of  participating  MFIs  and  other  lending \nintermediaries based on institutional, financial, and lending performance criteria summarized in \nAppendix  9.  MFIs  with  relevant  capabilities  in  implementing  microcredit  programs  for  the \ninformal  sector  conforming  to  ADB\u2019s  microfinance  development  strategy  will  be  preferred.  The \nDBP project loan officer will assess compliance with DBP accreditation requirements based on \naudited financial statements and other information. \n\n5. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n38. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  from  2003  to  2009.  Each  subproject  will  take  about  2 \nyears to complete.  Parts A and B will be complemented by (i) a nationwide advocacy program, \na component of part C; and (ii) organizational arrangements among the EAs, LGUs, NGOs, and \ncommunities. Part C has two components, the first of which will engage consultants for sector \nstrengthening  and  project  implementation  support.  The  consultants  will  then  assist  the  EAs.  \nCapacity  building  will  be  implemented  throughout  the  Project,  although  most  will  be \nconcentrated in the early stages. The implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 10. \n\n6. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n39. \nFor  parts  A  and  B,  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  consulting  services \nengaged  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  will  be  made  to  engage  domestic  consultants  using  the  quality-  and  cost-\nbased  selection  method.  Domestic  consulting  services  are  estimated  to  require  175  person-\nmonths.  The  consultants  will  be  experts  in  urban  development,  municipal  engineering, \ncommunity  organizing,  environmental  services,  economic  and  financial  analysis,  housing \nmicrofinance,  design  and  supervision  of  the  project  monitoring  systems,  and  microenterprise \ndevelopment.  \n\n40. \nFor  part  C,  consulting  services  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Cities  Alliance \nand the  German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ). GTZ will contribute $0.4 million for \nproject preparation activities under component C1. The Cities Alliance will provide $0.9 million \nto develop pro-poor shelter strategies. In total, approximately 22 person-months of international \nand  108  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  for  shelter  planning  and  community \nmobilization  will  be  financed.  Consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  according  to  the \nprocedures of the relevant agencies. \n\n7. \n\nAdvance Action on Recruitment  \n\nADB  has  approved  advance  action  in  recruiting  consultants  and  preparing  detailed \n41. \nengineering  designs  and  contract  documents,  starting  with  pilot  subprojects  in  Angeles, \nBacolod,  Cagayan  de  Oro,  and  Talisay.  DBP  has  been  advised  that  advance  action  does  not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project.  \n\n8. \n\nProcurement \n\n42. \nDBP  will  require  subborrowers  to  follow  ADB  procurement  guidelines  applicable  to \ndevelopment  finance  institution  loans,  which  include  the  obligation  to  (i)  demonstrate  that \nsubborrowers\u2019 procurement procedures are appropriate; (ii) ensure that goods and services are \npurchased  cheaply,  are  delivered  quickly,  and  are  efficient,  reliable,  and  suitable,  with \n\n\f13 \n\nmaintenance  and  spare  parts  readily  available;  and  (iii)  in  the  case  of  services,  ensure  the \nquality and competence of providers. All goods and services financed under the ADB loan will \nbe  procured  from  ADB  member  countries.  To  promote  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement, DBP, HUDCC, and NHA project managers and staff of other agencies engaged in \nprocurement  will  be  trained  and  briefed  on  procurement  as  appropriate.  International \ncompetitive  bidding  will  be  used  on  all  civil  works  contracts  over  $2  million  and  for  supply \ncontracts  over  $500,000.  In  other  cases,  local  competitive  bidding  will  be  used.  Goods  and \nservices  financed  by  concessional  and  grant  cofinanciers  will  be  procured  according  to  the \ngeneral procurement guidelines of those cofinanciers. \n\n9. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nLoan proceeds will be disbursed according to procedures in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \n43. \nHandbook, January 2001. To facilitate the disbursement of small expenditures under the loan, \nDBP will set up an imprest account exclusively for the Project. The initial payment and ceiling of \nthe imprest account will be equivalent to DBP\u2019s anticipated disbursements of approved subloans \nto subborrowers over a 6-month period, or 10% of the loan proceeds ($3 million). The account \nwill be replenished and liquidated on the basis of the statement of expenditures (SOE) prepared \nby  DBP  lending  centers  and  consolidated  at  the  DBP  head  office.  The  ceiling  on  SOE \nwithdrawals will be $200,000. DBP\u2019s accounting systems and internal control procedures have \nbeen assessed and are adequate for the imprest account and SOE procedures. \n\n10. \n\nProject Supervision and Reporting Requirements \n\nHUDCC and DBP will separately submit to ADB semiannual progress reports on project \n44. \nimplementation.  The  reports  will  cover  physical  performance,  summary  profiles  of  feasibility \nstudies, summary appraisals of applicant NGOs and CAPs, progress made in each component \nof  part  B,  and  progress  made  in  the  HUDCC-  and  NHA-executed  capacity-building  programs. \nWithin 3 months of subproject completion, DBP will prepare and submit a report, summarizing \nsubproject  implementation,  operational  performance,  and  an  overview  of  project  progress. \nHUDCC and DBP will prepare and submit to ADB a completion report 6 months after the Project \nis finished, summarizing the overall status of project implementation, operational performance, \nthe project performance monitoring system (PPMS), and targets achieved. \n\n11. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nDBP,  HUDCC,  NHA,  and  participating  LGUs  and  MFIs  will  maintain  separate  project \n45. \nrecords  and  accounts  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  The  records  and \naccounts must be sufficiently detailed to identify subloans and subprojects financed by the loan \nand  to  disclose  the  sources  and  expenditure  of  funds,  including  counterpart  contributions \nprovided in cash or in kind. DBP will submit the consolidated project accounts provided by LGUs \nand MFIs to ADB within 3 months of the end of the fiscal year. DBP and HUDCC will (i) have the \nproject  accounts  and  their  financial  statements  audited  annually,  according  to  generally \naccepted  auditing  standards,  by  the  Commission  on  Audit;  and  (ii)  submit  to  ADB,  within  9 \nmonths of the end of each fiscal year, a copy of the auditor\u2019s report on the project accounts and \nDBP\u2019s  audited  financial  statements.  The  auditor\u2019s  report  on  project  accounts  should  include  a \nseparate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  the  SOE  procedure.  The \nGovernment and EAs have been informed of ADB\u2019s new policy on submitting audited financial \nstatements and the penalties for noncompliance. \n\n\f14 \n\n12. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n46. \nThe  proposed  Project  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  and  guidelines.  The \nEAs  will  ensure  timely  submission  of  project  accounts.  Subprojects  will  be  selected, \ncomponents  approved,  and  goods  and  services  procured  according  to  the  agreed  guidelines \nand  criteria.  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  the  central  and  local  governments, \nDBP, and participating MFIs during project processing. The anticorruption provisions added to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants were also discussed, and the section on fraud and \ncorruption in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement were emphasized. \n\n13. \n\nProject Reviews \n\nA midterm review will take place about 2 years after the loan takes effect, to enable the \n47. \nGovernment,  DBP,  and  HUDCC  to  make  adjustments  in  project  design  and  implementation. \nThe review will cover the status of subproject preparation and implementation, the performance \nof  consultants,  subprojects  in  the  pipeline,  assistance  to  LGUs  and  their  poor  urban \ncommunities,  microfinance  and  institutional  capacity  building,  and  the  possible  reallocation  of \nloan proceeds. \n\n14. \n\n Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n48. \nThe  PPMS  will  be  established  on  the  basis  of  the  targets  and  measurable  monitoring \nindicators set up in the project framework. The system will enable the Government and the EAs \nto monitor expected objectives and outputs, and will assist them in planning remedial action if \nthey  are  not  achieved.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  carried  out  at  all  levels  of  project \nactivity  and  for  all  subprojects,  and  will  include  participatory  and  community-based  monitoring \ntechniques.  HUDCC\u2014the  agency  responsible  for  the  policy  agenda\u2014and  DBP  will  be \nresponsible for all aspects of project monitoring and evaluation. A PPMS will need to be devised \ninformation  collection  while  complying  with  both  Government  and  ADB \nto  minimize \nrequirements.  It  must  be  established  early  in  the  Project  with  the  assistance  of  the  project \nimplementation  support  consultants,  and  then  used  in  project  monitoring  and  post-project \nevaluation. Each participating SPIU will implement the PPMS for each completed subproject to \nevaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the benefits accrued.  \n\n49.  With the help of consultants, the PMOs will develop comprehensive PPMS procedures \nand plans according to ADB guidelines. The project LGUs will undertake PPMS activities such \nas setting benchmarks, collecting information, monitoring benefits, and evaluating social impact. \nThe PMOs will consolidate data and prepare the PPMS for the overall Project. The first set of \ndata on subprojects will be collected within 3 months of loan effectiveness. The results will be \nincluded  in  the  subproject  completion  report  to  be  prepared  by  LGUs  and  eventually  in  the \nproject completion report to be prepared jointly by the EAs. \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nThe  TA  will  strengthen  systems  within  DBP,  HUDCC,  LGUs,  and  MFIs  to  enable  the \n50. \nformulation of housing projects and financing appropriate to the needs of the poor. The TA will \n(i)  enable  DBP,  HUDCC,  and  LGUs  to  foster  community-based  mechanisms  for  upgrading \nslums and providing low-income housing; and (ii) enable DBP and MFIs to implement financial \nsystems to fund shelter development for the poor and to provide financing for the poor to access \nshelter, neighborhood improvements, and livelihood support. The TA will also provide support to \nthe PMOs in (i) realizing the policy reform agenda; (ii) strengthening LGUs\u2019 shelter planning and \n\n\f15 \n\noutreach  capabilities;  (iii)  strengthening  the  project  evaluation,  appraisal,  approval,  and \nimplementation  capabilities  of  implementing  agencies;  (iv)  effectively  coordinating  with  other \nagencies  involved;  (v)  coordinating  with  other  external  funding  agencies  over  cofinancing;  (vi) \nestablishing  and  making  operational  a  system  to  monitor  and  report  on  project  activities;  and \n(vii) developing procedures for contract tendering, bid evaluation, and award. Details of the TA \nare described in Appendix 11. \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts \n\n1. \n\nOverview \n\n51. \nOnce implemented, the Project will help reduce urban poverty in three ways: (i) in part A, \nabout 20,000 urban informal settlers will gain access to land tenure with basic infrastructure and \nservices;  (ii)  in  part  B,  over  20,000  poor  urban  families  in  the  informal  sector  are  expected  to \ngain access to microcredit facilities and to be absorbed as members of the government social \nsecurity  system  through  savings  mobilization;  and  (iii)  in  part  C,  over  60  communities  and \npartner NGOs will build up their capacity to prepare, develop, and implement community-driven \ndevelopment  projects  in  a  decentralized  environment.  More  than  270,000  people  will  directly \nbenefit  from  better  houses,  communities,  and  improved  access  to  the  formal  financial  system. \nThe  proposed  off-site  infrastructure,  including  flood  protection  facilities,  main  roads,  and \ndrainage,  will  indirectly  benefit  120,000\u2013230,000  others  residing  in  more  than  60  nearby \ncommunities.  Indirect  benefits  from  basic  urban  services  and  improvements  in  the  slum \nenvironment will accrue to the population in project cities, and will have a positive spillover effect \non adjacent communities. \n\nPhysical \n\nimprovements \n\nin  urban  services  and  better  sanitation \n\n52. \nin  participating \ncommunities will help reduce waterborne and water-related diseases, improve health, and thus \nbring additional economic benefits through increased capacity for income generation. Reducing \nthe costs of urban services will also save time for informal settlers, thus helping increase their \neconomic  productivity.  Community  participation  in  development  planning  and  implementation \nwill  reinforce  the  economic  and  health  benefits  associated  with  the  water  supply,  drainage, \nsanitation,  solid  waste,  and  community  improvement  components,  and  ensure  that  the  initial \ngains provided can be sustained and maintained. Access to microcredit will also allow informal \nsettlers  to  engage  in  more  income-generating  activities.  The  community  development  and \nresettlement policy applicable to the Project is set out in Appendix 12. The Project will benefit \nwomen by addressing security of tenure, improving access to basic infrastructure and services, \nand soliciting their full participation in project implementation. \n\nProposed  subprojects  were  subjected  to  economic  and  financial  analyses,  using  2003 \n53. \nprices,  which  included  assessments  of  household  affordability  and  willingness  to  pay  for  land \nand  home  improvements,  the  financial  capability  of  MFIs  and  LGUs,  cost  recovery,  and \nsubproject  sustainability.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  calculated  for  the \nsubprojects exceeds the economic opportunity cost of capital, and the financial internal rate of \nreturn  (FIRR)  of  revenue-generating  components  exceeds  the  real  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital. Land and basic services, as a percentage of the income of each decile of the targeted \nbeneficiaries,  are  deemed  affordable,  given  the  self-targeting  subsidies  available  to  the  LGU \nproponents, and given, in some justifiable cases, a government land subsidy. \n\n\f16 \n\n2. \n\nEconomic and Poverty Analysis \n\n54. \nThe major indicators of the economic viability of the proposed upgrading subprojects are \nsummarized in Appendix 5. Base-case EIRRs for the subprojects ranged from 27.9% to 44.6%, \nexceeding  the  12%  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital,  and  confirming  the  economic \nrobustness  of  the  proposed  subprojects.  Sensitivity  analysis  conducted  on  parameters  that \nincluded  a  10%  increase  in  costs,  a  10%  decrease  in  benefits,  or  both,  and  delays  in  the \nrealization  of  benefits,  showed  that  the  EIRRs  will  be  highly  vulnerable  to  changes  in  the \nanticipated benefits. EIRRs for the microfinance subprojects were robust, ranging from 18.3% to \n54.8% because they are short-term, require little capital, and have a high product turnover. The \npoverty  impact  ratio,  based  on  the  direct  economic  benefits  from  representative  suprojects  in \nParts  A  and  B,  is  66%.  This  ratio  is  significantly  higher  than  ADB\u2019s  estimate  of  9.2%  income \nshare of the urban poor in the Philippines, and confirms the pro-poor impact of the Project. The \npoverty impact analysis is summarized in Appendix 5. \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n55. \nFIRRs and financial sustainability projections were prepared for the revenue-generating \nsubprojects: (i) microfinance for home improvements, (ii) finance for small enterprises, and (iii) \nhousing  loans.  FIRRs  were  not  calculated  for  site  development  subprojects  because  all  eight \nhave  significant  subsidy  elements.  The  local  governments  will  eventually  recover  project \nsubsidies through property taxes. \n\n56. \nAll the microfinance components are viable, with base-case FIRRs of 6.0\u201351.9% above \nthe weighted average costs of capital adjusted for inflation. Major indicators of financial viability \nare  summarized  in  Appendix  5.  The  financial  capability  of  the  LGUs  serving  as  implementing \nagencies for site development were evaluated based on their financial statements and forecasts \nof revenues and expenditures. The cash flow projections indicate that all four pilot LGUs have \nthe  capacity  to  borrow  for  the  proposed  investments.  The  financial  analysis  of  representative \nMFIs  ascertained  their  ability  to  effectively  relend  to  project  beneficiaries  and  to  repay  their \nproposed subloans under part B. \n\n57.  Monthly amortization payments on loans for land and basic services through the MFIs, at \nan indicative interest rate of 12% and a term of 15 years, were compared with the income and \nborrowing capacity of beneficiaries in the pilot subproject areas. Serviced plots will be affordable \nto targeted beneficiaries. Overall, the serviced plots from the pilot subprojects were designed to \nbe  affordable  to  the  bottom  50%  of  urban  households  (Appendix  13).  This  targets  the  urban \npoor,  defined  by  the  National  Census  and  Statistics  Office  as  those  below  regional  poverty \nthresholds. Amortization payments for a serviced plot and housing improvement loan package \nwill generally be affordable to urban households in the second to third deciles, and payments on \na  serviced  plot  and  housing  loan  package  will  be  affordable  to  the  third  to  fifth  deciles.  In \naddition, households in the target sites will earn increased income through the small enterprise \ncomponent, and by renting space created by home improvements and housing loans. \n\n4. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\n58. \nThe  Project  is  in  environmental  category  B.  Initial  environmental  examinations  were \nprepared  for  eight  pilot  communities.  All  pilot  subprojects,  and  the  Project  as  a  whole,  will \ngenerate  little  environmental  impact  during  construction.  The  civil  works  are  not  substantial  in \nscale  or  cost,  and  most  involve  improving  drainage,  roads,  footpaths,  and  water  distribution \nsystems. Mitigation measures will include ensuring construction workers are briefed on how to \n\n\f17 \n\nminimize  nuisance,  and  carefully  planning  excavations  and  other  construction  to  avoid \ndamaging utilities. At most, the negative environmental impact would be interference with other \nutilities,  or  the  temporary  increase  of  solid  waste,  sewage,  dust,  or  noise  during  construction. \nMitigation measures will include documenting the work and utilities undertaken. The community-\nbased organization will undertake this documentation, as input to future construction activities. \nAlso important will be the careful design of septic tanks and drainage, and community education \non appropriate site cleaning and maintenance. Recommended mitigation measures are easy to \nintegrate into project feasibility and detailed engineering studies. The Project will fundamentally \nimprove the urban environment through better access, proper handling and disposal of domestic \nwastewater,  avoidance  of  flood  damage,  and  provision  of  potable  water.  The  summary  initial \nenvironmental examination is in Appendix 13. \n\nFor sector projects, site selection criteria include residential safety, which will have to be \n59. \nsupported  by  adequate  environmental  assessment.  DBP  has  been  certified  as  ISO  14001 \ncompliant13  and  has  the  appropriate  assessment  and  monitoring  arrangements  in  place. \nMitigation  measures  must  be  recommended,  and  the  conditions  set  in  place  for  their \nimplementation  before  any  subproject  is  approved  for  site  development.  Where  a  proposed \nproject has significant environmental impact as defined under ADB guidelines, DBP will provide \ndetails of the proposed subproject, its impact, and proposed mitigation measures for posting on \nthe ADB web site for 120 days prior to DBP approval. \n\n5. \n\nSocial and Gender Assessment \n\n60. \nAccording to socioeconomic surveys in the eight pilot areas, about 40% of the residents, \nor 48,000 potential project beneficiaries, are ultra-poor. These families have incomes below the \nsubsistence level, estimated at $166.08 (P8,304) per capita per year in 1997 and defined by the \nNational  Statistical  Coordination  Board  as  the  annual  per-capita  income  required  to  satisfy \nminimum  basic  nutritional  needs.  Other  target  beneficiaries  have  incomes  below  the  urban \npoverty threshold or have no formal access to basic services, particularly housing and related \ninfrastructure. \n\n61. \nThe  Project  will  generate  significant  benefits  for  the  urban  poor.  First,  it  will  lead  to \nincreased security of tenure and improved living conditions, and thus to economic, health, and \nquality-of-life benefits. Security of tenure will allow the targeted urban poor to realize the value \nof the capital represented by their house and lot. Second, the Project will improve their quality of \nlife and overall well-being by providing microfinance for home improvements and housing loans. \nThird,  the  Project  will  uplift  economic  conditions  by  providing  microfinance  for  growth-oriented \nenterprises.  The  community-driven  approach  to  project  preparation  (Appendix  12)  will  ensure \nfull participation from all community groups. \n\n62.  Women generally bear the brunt of insecurity of tenure and poor access to infrastructure \nand services because they are responsible for their families\u2019 well-being. The Project will benefit \nwomen  by  addressing  security  of  tenure  and  improving  access  to  basic  infrastructure  and \nservices. Women will also be the key beneficiaries of the community development components \nof part C because they are most involved in neighborhood enterprises and community services. \nWomen  will  also  benefit  indirectly  from  education  and  training  in  gender  awareness  for \npolicymakers,  housing  professionals,  national  and \nlocal  housing  officials,  and  NGOs. \nMicrofinance  will  have  a  bias  toward  women,  increasing  their  income-earning  ability  and \ncontributing to their economic independence. This will benefit the entire family, because studies \n\n                                                 \n13 Certifying that its environmental management practices comply with international standards. \n\n\f18 \n\nin  the  Philippines  have  shown  that  women  give  greater  priority  than  men  to  expenses  for \nhousing and basic services. Women will be considered equal partners in establishing CBOs for \nthe Project. They will be consulted and will participate actively in decision-making. The Project \nwill  ensure  that  gender  balance  is  maintained  in  the  representation  and  membership  of  the \nelected officers in community organizations.  \n\n63. \nThe  Project  is  structured  so  that  no  involuntary  resettlement  will  be  involved.  Where \nupgrading  necessitates  adjusting  plot  boundaries  or  moving  structures,  the  CAP  process  will \nensure  consent  by  requiring  the  signature  of  all  household  representatives.  Appropriate \ncompensation will be paid to those who are  voluntarily moving or are inconvenienced in other \nways. None of the pilot subprojects will affect indigenous peoples, nor is this likely to happen in \nsubsequent  batches,  because  the  project  targets  cities.  In  the  extremely  remote  case  that  an \naffected  community  fits  ADB\u2019s  characterization  of  indigenous  peoples,  community-driven \nplanning  mechanisms  will  ensure  the  application  of  the  policy  requirements  in  project \nimplementation.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  assessment  is  shown  in \nAppendix 14. \n\nB. \n\nProject Risks \n\n64. \nThe project risks and safeguards relate primarily to two areas: the amount of interest that \nLGUs and communities show, and the effectiveness of the targeted subsidy scheme. Risks are \nanticipated  and  mitigating  measures  proposed  in  the  key  areas  of  political  and  administrative \nchange,  project  timing,  project  approvals,  adherence  to  the  policy  framework,  and  absorptive \ncapacity and transparency of the targeted subsidy scheme. \n\n 65.  Risks Associated with Political and Administrative Change. The Project will rely on \nthe  continuing  commitment  of  DBP  and  HUDCC  to  the  project  approach,  and  of  the \nimplementing agencies such as LGUs and MFIs, to project implementation. Since some degree \nof administrative change is inevitable, the Project must deal with this change in a way that will \nnot harm progress or results. The Project\u2019s goal of poverty reduction will likely remain a central \npillar of government policy. At the local level, negative effects of administrative change can be \nmitigated  by  (i)  a  continuing  awareness  and  advocacy  program;  and  (ii)  the  sector  loan \napproach,  which  allows  ineligible  and  unqualified  LGUs  and  communities  to  be  dropped  and \nnew ones to join. \n\n66. \nRisks  Associated  with  Timely  Implementation.  The  Project  is  likely  to  include  up  to \n25  LGUs  and  as  many  as  66  communities.  While  the  project  duration  is  set  for  6  years, \nachieving the projected scale and disbursement rate will require (i) qualifying communities and \nLGUs  to  express  true  demand,  and  (ii)  an  efficient  PMO.  Furthermore,  a  lengthy  period  of \nproject  planning  and  design,  resulting  from  the  participatory  nature  of  the  Project,  may  prove \ndifficult  to  reconcile  with  the  need  for  rapid  processing.  Project  design  will  help  mitigate  these \nrisks  in  a  number  of  ways.  First,  the  regional  offices  of  DBP  and  HUDCC  will  support  the \nProject.  Second,  sector  programming  gives  the  Project  the  flexibility  of  replacing  communities \nthat cannot process loans quickly with those that can. Third, the project implementation support \nconsultancy  component  includes  two  elements  that  will  help  mitigate  these  risks:  (i)  a  project \nadvocacy  and  awareness  program  involving  seminars  and  workshops  for  mayors,  information \ncampaigns  at  the  regional  and  LGU  levels,  and  a  public  awareness  campaign  directed  at \npotential  project  communities  and  LGUs;  and  (ii)  a  strong  project  management  support  team \nworking with PMO staff and technical staff seconded from NHA, which will have the full range of \nskills necessary to minimize processing time. \n\n\f19 \n\nRisks Associated with Subproject Approvals. The PSC will meet quarterly, or  more \n67. \noften  if  necessary,  to  review  subprojects\u2019  compliance  with  eligibility  criteria  and  to  assess \nprogress.  This  committee  may  seriously  compromise  timely  implementation  if  it  fails  to  meet \nregularly and make clear, quick decisions. This risk will be mitigated by support from a strong \nPMS and PMOs staffed by competent counterparts and experienced consultants. \n\n68. \nRisks  Associated  with  Policy  Actions.  Efficient  project  implementation  relies  on \nprompt  action  on  the  policies  above.  No  major  legislative  change  is  needed,  but  effective \nimplementation  of  existing  laws  will  require  interventions  within  the  regulatory  and  institutional \nframeworks. While some land management issues will be addressed under a project supported \nby  the  World  Bank  and  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  loan \nconditions will ensure that critical policy actions in support of the Project are taken promptly. The \nPSC must also carefully monitor policy reforms.  \n\n69. \nRisks Associated with Financial Commitments and Absorptive Capacity. The SFTA \nand  LSFF  aim  to  reduce  cost  of  serviced  plots  that  LGUs  develop,  and  to  make  them  more \naffordable. However, the scheme currently relies on the LGUs as the core urban development \nagents. The absorptive capacity of the SFTA and LSFF subsidies will therefore depend on the \nextent of the shelter programs the LGUs develop every year. Onsite infrastructure was seldom \nprovided  in  the  past  because  of  a  limited  budget.  Only  since  the  recent  entry  of  government \nfinancial institutions such as DBP and Land Bank of the Philippines into this market have LGUs \nbegun to consider financing infrastructure through debt. The preparation of shelter development \nplans  will  help  LGUs  make  financial  projections  of  their  resources  and  adopt  a  more  dynamic \npolicy of borrowing from DBP for the purchase of land and the building of secondary or tertiary \ninfrastructure. Such a trend must be encouraged at the subproject level. Every developer of low-\nincome shelter projects can potentially benefit from the increased availability of long-term bank \nfinancing  with  upfront  grants  from  the  SFTA  and  LSFF.  The  sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that \nsome  subprojects  could  be  vulnerable  to  a  lower-than-expected  increase  in  plot  value  after \ninvestment, for example. This could slow loan uptake. The project\u2019s focus on the lowest possible \nthreshold of affordability is designed to address this issue. \n\n70. \nRisks  Associated  with  Transparent  Subsidy  Scheme  and  Titling  Arrangements. \nSFTA  and  LSFF  eligibility  criteria  should  be  well  understood  and  transparent.  They  should  be \ninstitutionalized within the LGUs, LSFFs, NHA, PMO, and SFTA, and the project implementation \nsupport consultancy services early in the Project. These criteria will rely on such parameters as \napplicants\u2019  incomes,  the  costs  of  subprojects,  and  the  financial  condition  of  the  SFTA  and \nLSFFs in a given year. Grant applicants should be screened as suggested in para. 69, starting \nfrom  the  community  level  (NGOs,  LGUs,  and  CBOs),  to  minimize  political  interference  and \nleakage. The information processing and support documents should be designed by corporate \norganization  specialists  to  avoid  excessive  red  tape  and  consequent  delays.  Because  the \ncomplex  interrelations  among  land  management  agencies  could  delay  the  issue  of  final  titles, \nthe Project has developed arrangements for interim titles based on the \u2018lease-to-own\u2019 modality \nbacked by HGC. \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe  Government,  DBP,  and  HUDCC  have  given  the  following  specific  assurances,  in \n\n71. \naddition to the standard assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n\f20 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe Government, through HUDCC, will carry out policy reforms according to the \nagreed policy action plan in Appendix 3. \n\nThe  Government  will  rationalize  the  housing  finance  sector  in  accordance  with \nExecutive Order 138, including market-based lending at all financial institutions. \n\nThe  Government,  through  HUDCC,  and  DBP  will  ensure  that  counterpart \nresources  for  project  implementation  are  provided  on  time.  To  this  end,  the \nGovernment  and  DBP  will  take  all  measures  necessary  or  appropriate  for  the \nprompt disbursement. \n\nHUDCC and DBP will not consider subprojects requiring significant resettlement. \nThe  PMS  will  screen  each  subproject  for  involuntary  resettlement  effects  to \nensure  no  losses  of  land,  income,  housing,  community  facilities,  or  resources. \nAny  involuntary  resettlement  arising  from  land  acquisition  will  conform  to  the \nresettlement  policy  in  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement,  the  CAP,  and \nthe resettlement policy framework. \n\nDBP  will  ensure  that  it  maintains  (a)  a  capital  adequacy  ratio  of  10%  or  above, \n(b) a minimum return on average total assets of 0.5%, and (c) a minimum liquid \nassets ratio14 of 25%. \n\nThe  Government,  through  HUDCC,  and  DBP  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is \ncarried  out  according  to  the  Philippines\u2019  applicable  environmental  rules  and \nregulations, as well as ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines. \n\nExcept as ADB may otherwise agree, the Borrower and the Guarantor will ensure \nthat all land required for a proposed subproject has unencumbered, clear title or \nevidence  of  clear  ownership  is  acquired  no  later  than  the  first  drawdown  of  a \nsubloan. \n\n(viii)  Before a subloan is awarded, DBP and HUDCC will ensure that (a) a local SPIU \nhas been established and appropriately staffed; (b) an adequate CAP has been \nprepared; (c) all beneficiaries have agreed on that plan; and (d) the participating \nLGU  has  agreed  in  writing  that  a  specified  community-based  organization  will \nrepresent the community. \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n72. \n\nThe Loan Agreement will take effect subject to the following conditions: \n\nDBP will submit to ADB an acceptable draft of the subsidiary loan agreement. \n\nThe  guarantee  and  project  implementation  agreement  between  ADB  and  the \nGovernment will have been executed and delivered, and all conditions precedent \nto  its  effectiveness\u2014other  than  a  condition  requiring  the  effectiveness  of  the \nLoan Agreement\u2014will have been fulfilled. \n\n                                                 \n14 Cash  on  hand;  checks  and  other  cash  items  due  from  the  Central  Bank  and  other  banks;  marketable  securities, \ntrading account securities, government securities with maturities of less than 1 year or more than 1 year, which can \nbe traded in the secondary market; interbank loans receivable with a maturity of less than 1 year to total deposits. \n\n\f21 \n\n(iii) \n\nThe PMOs and SPIUs in pilot cities are established and staffed.  \n\n(iv) \n\nThe PSC is established and has held its first meeting. \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n73. \nADB and recommend that the Board approve  \n\n(i) \n\nthe  loan  of  $30,500,000  to  the  Development  Bank  of  the  Philippines,  to  be \nguaranteed  by  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines,  for  the  Development  of  Poor \nUrban  Communities  Sector  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  with \ninterest  determined  according  to  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;

Concrete  footpaths  of  about  1,185  m  with  tertiary  side  drains  will  be \nconstructed  to  improve  plot  access.  Minor  water  supply  and  solid  waste  management \nimprovements will also be made. \n\n22.  Microfinance  for  Incremental  Home  Improvement.  Approximately  150  (30%)  of  the \n480  households  living  in  existing  structures  will  be  eligible  for  home  improvement  loans. \nAverage loan size would be P20,000, with a term of up to 5 years. \n\n23.  Microfinance  for  Small  Enterprises.  Approximately  123  households  will  avail  of \nmicroenterprise loans totaling between P10,000 and P30,000 for a term of up to 1 year. They \nwould support commercial activities such as small retail, metal works, and bicycle repair.   \n\nHousing Loans for Serviced Plots.  An estimated 384 households will avail of project \n24. \nfinancing  to  buy  serviced  plots.  The  average  loan  size  is  about  P22,000,  equivalent  to  the \ncalculated average selling price of serviced plots in Macabalan, net of the beneficiaries\u2019 equity \ncontributions. \n\n7. \n\nTalisay \u2013 Tangke Site Upgrading \n\n25. \nSite Development Civil Works.  About 398 m of footpaths will be concreted and 285 m \nof lined main drains and 138m of lined tertiary drains are proposed. Approximately 250 m worth \nof  water  distribution  line  will  provide  household  water  connections  throughout  the  area.  Five \npublic standpipes will be provided.  \n\n26.  Microfinance  for  Incremental  Home  Improvement.    An  estimated  25  households  in \nTangke, representing 25% of all existing resident settlers, will avail of these loans at an average \nof P30,000 for up to 5 years. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\n27.  Microfinance  for  Small  Enterprises. \n  Community  survey  results  showed  19 \nhouseholds would avail of microenterprise loans. These loans will average P25,000 and would \nlast  for  up  to  a  year.  They  would  help  expand  small  retail  outlets,  backyard  trading, \nmanufacturing and workshops, and off-farm enterprise activities. \n\nHousing  Loans  for  Serviced  Plots.    An  onsite  socioeconomic  survey  showed  79 \n28. \nhouseholds  would  avail  of  project  financing  to  buy  serviced  plots  with  an  average  price  of \nP42,000. \n\n8. \n\nTalisay \u2013 Lagtang Site Upgrading \n\n29. \nSite Development Civil Works.  The project area has sloping terrain, so only concrete \nfootpaths of about 460 m will be provided. About 177 m of interceptor drain would divert runoff \naway  from  the  erosion\u2013prone  project  site,  and  135  m  of  secondary  drain,  372  m  of  water \ndistribution line, and seven public standpipes will be provided. Tertiary drains will be constructed \nalong the footpaths. \n\n  About  14  households, \n30.  Microfinance \nrepresenting 25% of all existing settlers, would use home improvement loans, averaging about \nP20,000 for up to 5 years.   \n\nIncremental  Home \n\nImprovement. \n\nfor \n\n31.  Microfinance  for  Small  Enterprises.    Only  8  households  will  be  eligible  for \nmicroenterprise loans. These loans will average about P25,000, for a term of up to a year.  \n\nHousing Loans for Serviced Plots.  Based on a socioeconomic survey, 70 households \n\n32. \nwill avail of project financing to buy serviced plots averaging P40,000. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nA. \n\nGeneral \n\nIMPACT ANALYSIS \n\n1. \nThe  economic  and  financial  analyses  of  the  nine  subprojects  were  undertaken  in \naccordance with the following Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines: (i) Framework for the \nEconomic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Project, (ii) Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects, (iii) Guidelines for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial \nAnalysis  of  Projects,  and  (iv)  Bank  Criteria  for  Subsidies.  This  appendix  summarizes \nSupplementary Appendix B, which sets out the detailed calculation of economic internal rates of \nreturn (EIRRs), calculated for all subprojects, and the financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) \ncomputed for revenue-generating components.   \n  \nB. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n2. \nThe  proposed  site  development  subprojects  will  resolve  the  land  ownership  issue  and \ndistribute  individualized  titles  or  other  forms  of  secure  tenure  instruments.  It  will  also  provide \nbasic  services  such  as  roads,  footpaths  and  drains  to  (i)  increase  access  to  employment \nopportunities,  (ii)  reduce  damages,  losses,  and  waterborne  diseases  associated  with  flooding, \nand  (iii)  improve  sanitation  by  increasing  the  capacity  of  existing  sewer  drains.  Microfinance \ncomponent benefits were quantified either by imputing the potential increase in property rental \nvalues or by converting the potential stream of net income flows into economic benefits accruing \nto the borrowers. \n \n3. \nThe major indicators of the economic viability of the proposed upgrading subprojects are \nsummarized  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D.  Base-case  EIRRs  ranged  from  21.0%  to  40.5%, \nexceeding  the  ADB\u2019s  12%  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  (EOCC)  and  confirming  the \neconomic  robustness  of  the  proposed  subprojects.  A  sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  on \nparameters  that  included  a  10%  increase  in  costs,  a  10%  increase  in  benefits,  or  both,  and \ndelays in the realization of benefits showed that the EIRRs will be highly vulnerable to changes \nin  anticipated  benefits.  The  short-term  nature,  low  capital  input,  and  high  product  turnover  of \nrepresentative  activities  made  EIRRs  for  microfinance  subprojects  robust,  ranging  from  18.2% \nto 54.8%. \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n4. \nFIRRs  and  financial  sustainability  projections  were  prepared  for  the  revenue-generating \nsubprojects:  (i)  Microfinance  for  Home  Improvements,  (ii)  Microfinance  for  Small  Enterprises, \nand  (iii)  Housing  Loans.  FIRRs  were  not  calculated  for  the  site  development  subprojects. \nBeneficiaries  had  a  limited  ability  to  pay,  and  spillover  benefits  of  offsite  infrastructure  to \nsurrounding  communities  meant  that  some  degree  of  government  subsidy  would  be  justified. \nLocal governments will eventually recover subsidies through property taxes. \n\n5. \nThe major indicators of financial viability are summarized in Supplementary Appendix D. \nAll  the  shelter  finance  subcomponents  are  viable.  Base-case  FIRRs  are  6.0%  to  51.9%,  all \nabove the computed real weighted average cost of capital (WACC). \n\nD. \n\nPoverty Impact \n\n7. \nSupplementary  Appendix  J  sets  out  detailed  poverty  impact  assumptions.  Each  major \nproject  component  is  assessed  for  (i)  direct  impact  on  poverty  groups  based  on  the  income \ndistribution  derived  from  surveys  of  the  pilot  sites,  (ii)  the  percentage  of  direct  government \nbenefit, (iii) the proportion of government benefit which will benefit the poor, (iv) the percentage \nof capital costs which will accrue to poor (unskilled labor), and (v) the percentage of operation \nand  maintenance  costs  which  will  accrue  to  the  poor.  These  figures  are  derived  from  the \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\neconomic analysis and summarize the poverty impact assessment conducted in Supplementary \nAppendix J. \n \n7. \nPilot  project  consumer  benefits  were  calculated  by  deducting  the  financial  payment  of \nbeneficiaries  from  their  calculated  economic  benefit.  Key  to  the  large  poverty  impact  of  the \nproject is the targeted land subsidy applicable to beneficiaries of upgrading sites. The poverty \nimpact  of  benefits  accruing  to  government,  and  the  labor  component  of  the  civil  works  and \nhousing constructed under the pilot project, was then calculated. \n \nTable A5 shows the calculation of the poverty impact ratio derived from the experience \n8. \nin pilot sites. The pilot sites are representative of the size and type of investments and, broadly, \nof  the  communities  to  be  serviced.  Thus  the  benefits  and  costs  associated  with  the  various \ncomponents  have  to  be  increased  to  calculate  the  actual  poverty  impact  of  the  whole  project. \nThese factors are increased in proportion to the relative size of the full project component to the \npilot  component.  The  size  of  a  component  is  measured  in  terms  of  number  of  households \nimpacted or loans as appropriate.  \n \n\n \nBenefit Category \n\n \nProject \nConsumer \nImpact \n\nTable A5:  Summary Project Poverty Impact \n \n\nImpact to Other Stakeholders \n\nGovernment \nCapital  O&M \n\n \n  Capital \n\nLabor \n\nO&M \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\nSite Development \nHome Improvement \nHousing  \nMicrofinance \nTotal \n\n729.77 \n10.81 \n53.07 \n54.44 \n848.09 \n\n5.25 \n0.63 \n14.21 \n0.00 \n20.09 \n\n1.82 \n0.03 \n0.53 \n0.05 \n2.43 \n\nPoverty Impact Ratio \nMicrofinance-Generated Labor \nPoverty Index with Generated Labor \n\nO&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n70.01 \n12.08 \n189.48 \n0.00 \n271.57 \n \n\n24.33 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n24.33 \n\n \n\n101.42 \n12.74 \n204.22 \n0.05 \n318.43 \n \n\nE. \n\nPricing and Affordability to Targeted Beneficiaries \n\n \nBenefits \nto the \nPoor \n\n831.19 \n23.55 \n257.29 \n54.49 \n1,166.52 \n \n\n \nTotal \nProject \nBenefits \n\n1,397.93 \n24.30 \n243.44 \n106.95 \n1,772.62 \n0.66 \n2,597.63 \n2.12 \n\n9. \nOverall,  the  serviced  plots  from  the  pilot  subprojects  were  designed  to  be  affordable  to \nthe bottom 50% of Philippine urban households (see Supplementary Appendix B). For residents \navailing  of  both  the  serviced  plots  and  the  housing  improvement  loan  packages,  the \namortization  payments  will  generally  be  affordable  at  the  second  to  third  deciles  of  the  total \nPhilippine  urban  households.  For  those  purchasing  the  serviced  plots  and  availing  of  the \nhousing  loans,  payments  will  be  affordable  to  those  comprising  the  third  to  fifth  deciles  of  the \ntotal  Philippine  urban  households.  Monthly  amortization  payments  for  purchasing  the  serviced \nplots were calculated at an indicative 12% for 15 years, and compared against the income and \nborrowing capacity of the pilot subprojects beneficiaries. All serviced plots will be affordable to \nthe  targeted  beneficiaries,  with  the  exception  of  Lagtang  and  Riverside,  whose  relatively  high \nland  acquisition  costs,  flood  protection  work,  constrained  ability  of  targeted  beneficiaries,  and \npositive spillover effects justify subsidies. \n\nF. \n\nAffordability to Local Governments \n\nThe  financial  capability  of  the  local  government  units  (LGUs),  who  will  serve  as  the \n10. \nimplementing  agencies  (IAs)  for  the  site  development  component,  were  evaluated  (see \nSupplementary Appendix D) based on their financial statements and forecasts of revenues and \nexpenditures.  Internal  revenue  allotments  (IRAs)  constitute  from  51%  to  60%  of  the  regular \nincomes  of  pilot  LGUs.  Cash  flow  projections  show  all  four  pilot  LGUs  have  the  capacity  to \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nborrow  for  project  investments.  The  Local  Government  Code  requires  LGUs\u2019  annual  debt \nservicing  be  limited  to  20%  of  total  revenues.  Given  the  financing  requirements  of  the  site \ndevelopment component, all pilot LGUs will stay within the debt servicing limit, with the highest \nratio  of  debt  servicing  to  total  income  reaching  only  5%.  Projected  financial  statements  from \n2001 to 2010 suggest that financial performance will improve over the medium term. \n\nG. \n\nAffordability to Participating Financial Institutions \n\n11. \nFor  the  shelter  finance  component,  the  financial  capability  of  eligible,  representative \nmicrofinance institutions (MFIs) and countryside financial institutions (CFIs) were evaluated (see \nSupplementary Appendix D). Financial projections were also conducted to ascertain their ability \nto  pay  the  subprojects\u2019  debt  servicing  requirements.  For  the  Microfinance  for  Home \nImprovements  and  Microfinance  for  Small  Enterprises  subprojects,  the  Negros  Women  of \nTomorrow Foundation (NWTF), which was seen as a representative MFI, was assessed. With a \ncollection  efficiency  of  97%  and  a  3.16%  portfolio  at  risk,  the  NWTF  is  one  of  the  best \nperforming MFIs in the Philippines. Projections of the NWTF\u2019s financial statements indicate that \nit  will  continue  to  operate  profitably  over  the  long-term.  The  MFI  exceeds  minimum  standard \nrequirements  set  by  the  Philippine  Microfinance  Coalition  on  (i)  track  record,  (ii)  outreach,  (iii) \ninternal control, (iv) manual of operations, (v) management information systems, and (vi) policy \non write-offs and loan losses. The NWTF will be capable of repaying debt-service requirements.   \n \nFor the housing loans subproject, the financial capability of Cooperative Bank of Misamis \n8. \nOriental, Inc. (CBMOI), a representative CFI, was examined. CBMOI is among the top ten best \nperforming cooperative banks in the country, with liquidity, profitability, asset quality, and capital \nadequacy  ratios  consistently  above  the  industry  average.  Financial  projections  show  it  will \ncontinue  to  generate  significantly  positive  net  incomes,  with  return  on  assets  (ROAs)  ranging \nfrom  4.3%  to  19.0%  for  the  period  2001-2010.  The  eligibility  criteria  for  CFIs  have  been \nprepared to attract efficient, innovative, and productive local banks such as CBMOI. CBMOI will \ncomfortably meet the project\u2019s debt servicing requirements (Supplementary Appendix D). \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n35 \n\nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A6.1: Project Cost Summary, by Expenditure Accounts \n \n\n(pesos mn) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \n\n \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\n($ million) \nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \nExpenditure Account \n\nA.

\n\nDEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES \u2013  \nPROJECT FINANCIAL IMPACT AND MFI CRITERIA \n\nDevelopment Bank of the Philippines \n\n1. \nThe  Development  Bank  of  the  Philippines  (DBP)  is  a  government  financing  institution \n(GFI) aimed at providing credit facilities to develop and expand the Philippines\u2019 agriculture and \nindustry, and diversify the national economy. Since its establishment in 1947, DBP has played a \nmajor role in the Government\u2019s pump-priming activities by lending facilities to strategic sectors. \nDBP is a conduit for international funds from multilateral sources and bilateral institutions, and \nfor  official  development  assistance  (ODA)  programs  and  grants.  As  a  universal  bank,  it  also \noffers a broad range of investment opportunities, business, financial, and lending products. \n\n2. \nDBP is governed by a board of directors whose chairman is appointed by the president \nof the Philippines. A president and chief executive officer serves as vice-chairman of the bank\u2019s \nboard. For the bank\u2019s day-to-day operations, a senior executive vice president is appointed as \nchief operating officer. In addition, the bank has 3 senior executive vice presidents, 3 executive \nvice presidents, 2 first senior vice presidents, 16 senior vice presidents, 9 first vice presidents, \nand 23 vice presidents. \n \nAs of December 2002, DBP\u2019s total assets stood at P148.64 billion, making it one of the \n3. \nbiggest  banks  in  the  Philippines.  Total  liabilities  and  stockholders\u2019  equity  were  P129.52  billion \nand P19.13 billion, respectively. In 2002, DBP\u2019s reported net income after tax was P1.87 billion, \ncontributing to a return on assets (ROA) of 1.3%, well above the industry average of 0.8% for \nthe same year. Other indicators of DBP\u2019s financial robustness in 2002 include a return on equity \n(ROE) of 10.22%, equity-to-risk-assets ratio of 24.08%, a past-due rate of 12.90%, and a liquid-\nassets-to-deposits ratio of over 300%. All these ratios were better than the calculated banking \nindustry  average  for  earning  performance,  capital  adequacy,  asset  quality,  profitability,  and \nliquidity in 2002.  \n \n4. \nUsing  modest  growth  assumptions,  DBP  plans  to  continue  to  operate  viably  and \nprofitably  in  the  next  5  years  by  (i)  generating  more  low-cost  deposits  as  a  primary  source  of \nfunds for lending and investments; (ii) maintaining sufficient liquid assets to meet withdrawals; \n(iii)  preserving  the  balance  between  operating  expenses,  gross  income,  and  total  assets;  and \n(iv)  ensuring  that  its  capital  adequacy  indicator  meets  the  central  bank  requirement.  DBP \nestimates its total assets will grow from P148.64 billion in 2002 to P182.22 billion in 2007 (Table \nA9.1), an increase of more than 20%. This growth trend is also reflected in its income after tax, \nwhich is expected to increase from P1.87 billion in 2002 to P2.25 billion in 2007 (Table A9.2).   \n \n5. \nA summary of the financial performance indicators of DBP for the next 5 years confirms \nits  continued  commitment  to  preserve  a  capital  adequacy  ratio  that  is  higher  than  the  central \nbank\u2019s  mandated  10%  (TableA9.3).  Asset  quality  will  be  enhanced  by  keeping  past-due  rates \nbelow 12% during this period. DBP will be more than able to respond to its clients\u2019 withdrawals \nas measured by its projected liquid assets to total deposits ratios of 170% to 236% during the \nperiod 2003-2007. Profitability will be better than the estimated average for the banking sector, \nas indicated by a projected ROA of about 1.3%. The proposed ADB loan will account for at most \n1% of DBP\u2019s projected total assets from 2003 to 2007 and will, thus, have a minimal impact on \nits overall financial condition. \n\n \n\n \nA.

\n\nEligibility Criteria of Microfinance Institutions \n\nB. \n \n6. \nEligible MFI applicants with nonbanking functions such as microfinance nongovernment \norganizations  (MFNGOs),  savings  and  loan  associations  (SLAs),  credit  unions  (CUs),  and \ncooperatives  may  apply  for  funding  support.  MFI  with  banking  functions  such  as  rural  banks, \ncooperative banks, thrift banks, development banks, and commercial banks are likewise eligible \napplicants.  MFIs  are  classified  as  banking  and  nonbanking.  Non-banking  MFIs  include \nmicrofinance  NGOs,  savings  and  loans  associations,  cooperatives,  and  credit  unions  while \nbanking MFIs are the rural banks, cooperative banks, thrift banks, and commercial banks with \nMFI windows. For nonbanking MFIs, DBP will adopt the NGO Microfinance Standards released \nby the Coalition for Microfinance Standards. \n \n7. \nMicrofinance Standards for institutional, financial, and lending performance. \n \n\nTo  be  eligible  to  access  project  funds,  nonbanking  MFIs  must  pass  the  NGO \n\nRegistration.  Must  be  duly  registered  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange \nCommission  (SEC),  Cooperative  Development  Authority  (CDA),  or  other \nregistering  and  regulating  entity  such  as  the  Department  of  Labor  and \nEmployment-Bureau of Rural Workers (DOLE-BRW). \n\nTrack record. (a) Minimum of 3 consecutive years\u2019 experience in managing and \nimplementing a microfinance program, (b) a minimum of 500 clients, and (c) no \nadverse borrowing record for the past 3 years based on creditor\u2019s rating. \n\nOutreach.  (a)  Institution  must  clearly  express  in  its  vision  and  mission \nstatements  a  distinct  commitment  to  reach  low-income  clients,  and  (b)  at  least \n75% of active clients have loans of P25,000 and below. \n \nInternal  control.  (a)  Written  internal  control  and/or  audit  manual;  (b)  annual \nexternal  audit  that  would  reveal  enforced  internal  controls,  systems,  and \nprocedures, as well as the absence of fraud from management and/or board for \nthe last 3 years; and (c) regular internal audit. \n\nManual  of  operations.  A  written  operations  manual  shall \nthe \nadministrative  and  credit  program  systems  and  procedures.  Manual  should \nclearly  define  levels  of  authority  and  accountability,  job  descriptions,  and \nmicrofinance program systems and procedures. \n \n\ninclude \n\n(vi)  Management  information  systems  (MIS).  MIS  should  include  regular  and \ntimely  reports  on  (a)  the  loan  portfolio,  including  repayment,  loans  outstanding, \nand  aging  of  loans;  (b)  a  CBU  report,  including  number  of  accounts,  amount \noutstanding, and withdrawals; (c) income statements, balance sheets, and cash \nflow statements; (d) outreach reports, including the number of active clients; and \n(e) at least a 1-year operating plan and budget for microfinance program(s). \n \n\n(vii)  Write-offs and loan losses. Existing and enforced policy on write-offs and loan \n\nloss provision. \n\n \nThe  following  critical  performance  indicators  have  been  selected  for  performance \n8. \nstandards of nonbanking MFIs: (i) number of active clients; (b) repayment rate and portfolio at \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nrisk; (c) sustainability, as expressed in its operating cost ratio, operational self-sufficiency, and \nfinancial self-sufficiency; (d) capital adequacy/leverage; and (e) liquidity ratios. \n\n9. \nThe  eligibility  of  a  nonbanking  MFI  will  be  based  on  the  scoring  system  of  the  NGO \nMicrofinance  Standards,  where  performance  is  given  a  score  for  each  of  several  indicators. \nOnly nonbanking MFIs with a performance level of at least \u201c3\u201d may participate. For the banking \nMFIs,  only  the  rural  banks,  thrift  banks,  cooperative  banks,  and  commercial  banks  with  MFI \nwindows  will  be  allowed  to  participate.  These  banking  MFIs  have  to  be  accredited  under  the \nDBP\u2019s  wholesale  lending  program.  The  guidelines  are  contained  in  the  DBP\u2019s  accreditation \nguidelines and are similar to the NGO standards. \n \n10.   DBP may institute adjustments on the performance indicators as governing bodies such \nas  the  National  Credit  Council  will  recommend.  Seen  as  enhancements  to  the  existing \nstandards,  performance  indicators  such  as  the  COOP-PESOS  (relating  to  the  operations  of \ncooperatives)  and  similar  enhancements  as  approved  by  ADB  will  be  considered  inclusion  in \neligibility criteria. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n\n2003\n \n\n2004\n \n\n2005\n \n\n2006\n \n\n2007\n \n\n2008\n \n\n2009\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nActivity\n \nCommon Preparatory Activities \n1.

The  TA  will  (i) \nenable  DBP,  HUDCC,  and  LGUs  to  foster  community-based  mechanisms  for  slum  upgrading \nand  low-income  housing;  and  (ii)  to  enable  DBP  and  MFIs  to  implement  financial  systems  to \nfinance shelter, neighborhood improvement, and livelihood support for the poor. \n\n2. \nThe  major  project  components  will  be  (i)  support  to  community-based  mechanisms  for \nslum upgrading and low-income housing; and (ii) support to improve financial systems to fund \nsuch shelter development. Project outputs will be: (i) improved capacity of DBP to manage the \nprocess  of  pro-poor  shelter  finance  and  of  HUDCC  to  foster  LGU  planning  for  appropriate \nprojects;  (ii)  improved  capacity  of  LGUs  to  plan  shelter  for  the  poor  and  to  undertake  the \noutreach required to work effectively with MFIs and poor communities; (iii) improved systems for \nMFI  provision  of  housing  microfinance;  and  (iv)  better  participation  of  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) in the process of financing shelter development for the poor. \n\nB. \n\nMethodology and Key Activities \n\n3. \nThe  TA  will  assist  DBP,  HUDCC,  LGUs,  and  MFIs  to  sustain  the  systems  developed \nunder  the  Project.  The  TA  will  be  undertaken  primarily  through  on-the-job  training  and \ndissemination of international and local best practice in the field. It will involve close consultation \nwith  representatives  of  communities  likely  to  benefit  from  the  Project  and  the  NGOs  assisting \nthem,  particularly  in  respect  of  sustainable  mechanisms  for  effective  community  participation. \nThis aspect of the Project is important as a sustainable financing system for low-income people \ndepends on their clear understanding of the Project, their establishing a strong trust and savings \nrelationship with the MFI concerned, and their commitment to service the loan. \n\nTable A11.1: Technical Assistance Framework \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nPerformance \nIndicators/Targets \n\nMonitoring \nMechanisms \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\n \nThe number of:  \n- \n\npoor and near-poor \nhouseholds with \nreduced vulnerability \nto economic, \nenvironmental, and \nother adverse impacts; \nhouseholds benefiting \nfrom improved \nhousing; \nhouseholds benefiting \nfrom improved \nenvironmental \nconditions; \nhouseholds with \naccess to local \nmicrocredit; and \npoor and near-poor \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n \nLocal government and \nnongovernment \norganization (NGO) \nrecords of development \n \nPMOs\u2019 records \n\n \nContinued and \nconsistent commitment \nof Government to \npoverty reduction \n \nStable macroeconomic \nmanagement with \ngrowth rate higher than \nrate of population \nincrease \n \nGood governance and \neffective decentralization \n \nNo financial sector \nmeltdown \n\n \n\nGoal \nThe urban poor and \nvulnerable near-poor \nparticipate in and \nbenefit from shelter \nfinance to increase \ntheir income, assets, \nand well-being. \n \n\n \n\n\fPerformance \nIndicators/Targets \nhouseholds with \nreduced vulnerability \nto economic, \nenvironmental, and \nother adverse impacts \n\n \nThe number of:  \n- \n\ncity participatory \nupgrading and new \nsite projects targeted \nto the poor and near-\npoor; \npoor and near-poor \nbeneficiaries of such \nprojects; and \nlocal parliament \nendorsed pro-poor \nshelter development \nstrategies \n\n- \n\n- \n\n \nNumber of shelter \nstrategies \n \nNumber and size of \nprojects/community action \nplans fully prepared \n \nNumber of microfinance \ninstitutions serviced \n\nMonitoring \nMechanisms \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\n \nAs above \n \nPMOs and consultants \nrecords \n \n \n\n \nAdequate revenue and \nwillingness to borrow on \nthe part of local \ngovernments \n \nAcceptance of targeted \nand market-friendly \nsubsidy mechanisms \n\n \nSuccessful launch of the \nProject  \n\n \nProgress reports and \nreview missions \n \nProject Performance \nMonitoring System \n(PPMS) of the Project  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n46 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nPurpose \nLocal governments and \nother eligible \nproponents regularly \nimplement bankable \nshelter projects for the \npoor in partnership with \npoor communities \n \nFinancial institutions \nwill have and use \nprofitably shelter \nfinance products \nappropriate to the \nneeds of the poor \nOutputs \nCity shelter strategies \n \nUpgrading projects \n \nNew site  \ndevelopment projects \n \nShelter finance \nproducts appropriate to \nthe needs of the poor \nestablished within \nfinancial institutions to \nwhich the poor have \ngood access \nActivities/Inputs \n(to be developed \nthrough the \nimplementation of \ntechnical assistance) \n \nC. \n\nCost and Financing \n\n4. \nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $2.15 million equivalent, comprising $570,000 in \nforeign exchange and $1,580,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $1,500,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign currency cost and $930,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the \nADB-funded  TA  program.  It  is  estimated  that  about  50%  of  the  ADB  grant  will  be  used  for \nshelter  sector  strengthening  activities,  and  the  remaining  50%  for  project  implementation \nactivities.  HUDCC  and  DBP  will  finance  the  remaining  local  currency  costs  amounting  to \nfacilities,  counterpart  staff, \n$650,000  equivalent,  which  cover \nadministrative  support,  part  of  workshop  expenses,  report  production  and  dissemination,  and \nlocal  transportation.

The lead EA for \nshelter sector strengthening activities is HUDCC, and for the capacity building activities related \nto  project  implementation  support,  DBP.  HUDCC  will  establish  its  project  management  office \n(PMO) with a designated full-time project manager to undertake the technical and administrative \naspects  of  strengthening  the  decentralized  shelter  delivery  framework.  DBP  will  also  establish \nits PMO for project implementation. Both EAs will ensure that suitably qualified and experienced \ncounterpart staff in their offices will work alongside the TA consultants. The TA consultants will \nprovide  full  support  to  HUDCC  in  respect  of  sector  strengthening  activities,  and  to  DBP  in \nrespect  of  capacity  building  for  implementation  activities.  They  will  work  in  close  collaboration \nwith  their  counterpart  teams  in  accordance  with  an  agreed  work  plan  to  be  established  in  the \nInception Report. The project steering committee (PSC) will serve as the TA steering committee \nand will be chaired by HUDCC, with members from Department of Finance, DBP, the National \nEconomic  and  Development  Authority  (NEDA),  and  other  concerned  agencies,  and  will  be \nestablished  by  the  end  of  month  one  of  the  TA  project.  A  project  management  secretariat \n(PMS),  comprising  personnel  from  HUDCC  and  DBP,  assisted  by  the  TA  consultants,  will \nconstitute  the  technical  working  group  of  the  PSC  to  ensure  coordinated  and  efficient  project \nimplementation. \n\n6. \nThe  TA  will  require  21  person-months  of  international  and  108  person-months  of \ndomestic consulting with expertise in housing and microfinance, shelter upgrading, development \nand management, municipal finance, sociology and resettlement, environmental sciences, and \nland law. An international consulting firm will be engaged following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nof  Consultants,  using  the  quality  cost-based  selection  method.  Short-form  proposals  will  be \nsought.  Any  procurement  will  be  conducted  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement. \nHUDCC will be responsible for providing the agreed counterpart resources. The consultants will \nbe based in Manila and will be expected to travel as necessary to the regions. \n\nThe TA is expected to commence in December 2003, and will be implemented over 36 \n7. \nmonths  with  the  submission  of  a  final  report  in  December  2006.  The  consultants  will  also \nproduce (i) an inception report at the end of the first month; (ii) capacity building strategies and \nprocedural  manuals  for  DBP,  MFIs,  and  LGUs  in  months  4  and  12;  (iii)  detailed  shelter  plans \nand CAPs for all participating cities by the end of month 21; and (iv) a summary of training and \nworkshops  conducted,  complete  with  training  strategies,  materials  presented  and  attendance \nlists.  Tripartite  reviews  will  be  held  to  evaluate  each  of  the  outputs,  and  seminars  associated \nwith these reviews will present progress to, and obtain input from, central government agencies, \nlocal governments, civil society, and representatives of the communities involved. \n\nOutline Terms of Reference for Consultants \n\nE. \n \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n8. \nThe objectives of the proposed TA are to assist the DBP and HUDCC, in establishing, \ninstalling,  and  initially  supervising  affordable  shelter  finance  systems  for  the  poor  using  a \ncommunity  action  planning  approach  in  the  participating  LGUs,  MFIs,  and  community-based \norganizations  (CBOs).  At  all  levels,  capacities  need  to  be  built  to  manage,  implement,  and \nmonitor the new poverty reduction methodologies. \n\n2. \n\nScope of Work \n\n9. \nThe  consultants  will  prepare  an  overview  of  all  structural  and  procedural  requirements \nfor  project  implementation  and  develop  a  set  of  implementation  guidelines  for  all  project \ncomponents.  These  guidelines  will  clarify  key  policies,  principles,  and  strategies  of  the  project \nand  will  provide  a  detailed  framework  for  project  implementation.  In  consultation  with  all \nstakeholders,  they  will  design  a  comprehensive  training  program  and  train  the  staff  of  DBP, \nHUDCC,  NHA,  HGC,  and  the  selected  LGUs  and  MFIs  to  ensure  the  sustainability  and \nreplicability of the Project approach.  \n\n10. \nIn  participating  communities,  and  in  other  areas  where  resources  are  available, \nconsultants will build the capacity of community organizations that are project finance recipients. \nCommunity  organizations  will  require  strengthening  to  manage  the  process  of  interaction  with \nMFIs, community action planning, savings-and-loan operations, and project activities. They will \nbe  made  familiar  with  project  procedures  and  trained  to  participate  in  all  stages  of \nimplementation. Communities will also be important in verifying project policies and approaches. \nThe  consultants  will  document  a  \u201cgood  practice\u201d  approach  for  DBP,  HUDCC,  LGUs,  other \neligible proponents, and the MFIs. \n\n11. \nConsultants will establish within MFIs the systems for disbursing and monitoring shelter \nand  small-business  loans  based  on  an  analysis  of  the  present  financial  systems,  to  facilitate \ncontrol  and  monitoring  of  loan  funds.  They  will  develop  and  undertake  financial  training \nworkshops for MFI staff, assist in installing the financial systems, and supervise the operations \ninitially. In particular the consultants will: \n\n(i) \n\nexamine  and  analyze  present  financial  operations,  computerization,  and  MIS \nrequirements  of \ntheir \nrepresentative  participating  MFIs  with \nmicrolending and monitoring systems needs; \n\nregard \n\nto \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n49 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\ndetermine, in conjunction with the sample MFIs and DBP, the types of  financial \noutput  and  the  reporting  format  required  for  effective  management  and \nmonitoring  of  shelter  microfinance  as  programmed,  by  MFIs  and  design  an \nappropriate benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME) system incorporating needs \nof DBP, MFIs, and beneficiaries; \n\nestablish  the  minimum  requirements  for  prudent  financial  controls  and  design  a \nrecording and analysis system that (i) can be easily understood and adopted with \nminimum  staff  and  computer  requirements;  and  (ii)  will  ensure  that  all  financial \nintermediation is recorded in an appropriate form, using standard definitions and \nmethodologies to facilitate control and monitoring of funds; \n\nevaluate the hardware and software being used by MFIs for their portfolio, design \nadditional  systems  in  consultation  with  these  organizations,  and  integrate  new \nsystems into their financial controls; \n\nundertake, at selected locations, a series of financial training workshops for MFI \nstaff,  accountants,  and  bookkeepers,  augmented  by  training  at  selected  MFIs \nwhere staff from surrounding organizations would assemble; \n\nafter developing, testing, and supervising the installation of the required financial \nrecording  and  analysis  system  in  the  selected  MFIs,  prepare  an  operations \nmanual  to  provide  step-by-step  instructions  for  other  MFIs  seeking  to  install  an \nappropriate financial control system; \n\nprovide  a  trouble-shooting  service  to  resolve  the  difficulties  of  MFIs  in  installing \nthe new systems and provide refresher training courses; \n\nreview  the  existing  and  proposed  operational  systems;  and  design,  test,  and \ninstall appropriate BME systems to provide an efficient means of monitoring the \noperation and  the impact of the project investment; and \n\n(ix) \n\ndocument a \u201cgood practice\u201d approach to these activities for DBP and HUDCC. \n\nThe  consultants  will  analyze \n\n12. \nthe  capacity  of  participating  LGUs  and  make \nrecommendations for institutional adjustments to ensure that LGUs will be able to undertake the \nshelter-related  poverty  reduction  program.  In  the  decentralized  shelter  and  poverty  reduction \nprogram, LGUs will play a pivotal role for which they need to be prepared institutionally and in \nterms of human resource development. LGUs should become more responsive to the needs of \nthe urban poor and a systematic approach of cooperation between the urban poor, MFIs, and \nLGUs  will  be  developed.  In  each  participating  LGU,  the  consultants  will  produce  sample  city \nshelter plans and community action plans (CAPs). The consultants will undertake technical and \non-the-job training of LGU staff in the new approaches. The consultants will document a \u201cgood \npractice\u201d approach to these activities for DBP, HUDCC, and MFIs. \n\nFor  DBP,  the  consultants  will  (i)  design  systems  for  DBP  appraisal,  support,  and \n13. \nmonitoring of pro-poor housing development, CAPs, and MFI sublending; and (ii) train the staff \ninvolved in implementing these activities. For HUDCC, the consultants will (i) assess the need \nfor  broader  systems  of  support  to  sustain  the  preparation  of  pro-poor  housing  development, \nCAPs, and housing microfinance; (ii) prepare an action plan for putting these into place; and (iii) \ntrain  the  staff  involved  in  implementing  this  plan.  Coordination  between  capacity-building \nelements  is  critical,  and  linkages  with  the  main  project  components  essential.  Consultants  will \nbe  required  to  coordinate  other  capacity  building  activities with  DBP,  HUDCC,  and  the  project \nsteering committee. \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nA. \n\nBackground \n\nSUMMARY COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION AND RESETTLEMENT \n\nThe  Philippines  has  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  $30.5  million \n1. \ndollar  equivalent  loan  for  a  sector  loan  to  undertake  the  Project.  The  Project  will  improve  the \nlivelihood quality of life and reduce poverty in selected mid-size Philippine cities and first-class \nmunicipalities through land titling and other forms of secure tenure for informal settlers, on- and \noffsite  upgrading,  and  microfinance  for  housing,  home  improvements,  and  small  enterprises. \nNine  pilot  subprojects  were  identified  and  are  in  various  preparation  stages.  Discussions  with \nthe  National  Housing  Authority  (NHA),  local  government  units  (LGUs),  and  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs)  in  pilot  subproject  areas,  site  visits,  and  interviews  with  project \nbeneficiaries and community associations constitute the basis for this summary. \n\nB. \n\nLand Acquisition/Resettlement Strategy \n\nGiven  its  subproject  selection  criteria  and  highly  participatory  planning  approach,  the \n2. \nProject  is  not  generally  expected  to  cause  involuntary  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The \nselection  criteria  ensure  that  site  acquisition  will  not  involve  the  exercise  of  the  principle  of \neminent  domain  and  participation  of  project  beneficiaries  to  off-site  schemes  is  voluntary. \nParticipatory  planning  guarantees  that  minor  land  losses  caused  by  reblocking  are  freely \ncontributed  by  affected  informal  settlers  or,  if  needed,  replaced  through  voluntary  land \nredistribution.  To  warrant  the  rehabilitation  of  informal  settler  participants  in  the  upgrading \nschemes,  serviced  plots  will  be  priced  at  rates  affordable  to  them,  house  losses  will  be \ncompensated  at  replacement  cost;  and  relocation  subsidies  provided.  If  in  exceptional  cases \nunexpected involuntary land losses to formal settlers will occur, they will be fully compensated in \naccordance with ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy. \n\nC. \n\nParticipatory Planning and Land Acquisition/Resettlement Guidelines (PPLARG) \n\n3. \nTo guarantee community participation and compliance with ADB's resettlement policy, a \nset of PPLARG was prepared. The PPLARG addresses issues within and beyond the scope of \na  resettlement  plan  detailing  (i)  subproject  selection/processing  criteria;  (ii)  participatory \nplanning tools; and (iii) a resettlement policy framework. \n\n1. \n\nSubproject Selection and Processing Criteria \n\n4. \n\nThe following criteria will regulate subproject selection/preparation: \n\na. \n\nEligibility Criteria \n\n(i) \n\nOff- and onsite scheme areas must have been public for at least 2 years before \nbeing submitted for consideration; or, if still private, their price must have already \nbeen negotiated between relevant community associations and landlords. \n\n(ii) \n\nOffsite scheme areas cannot replace land affected by infrastructure projects. \n\n(iii) \n\nOffsite  development  areas  must  be  tied  to  specific  beneficiary  communities, \nwithin 15 kilometers of their original residence, and supported by an initial social \nassessment.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n51 \n\n(iv) \n\nProof  of  beneficiary  acceptance  of  offsite  subproject  site  must  be  available. \nSettlers  unwilling  to  relocate  will  be  able  to  remain  at  their  premises  without \nsanctions. \n\nb. \n\nAppraisal Criteria (at least 6 months after selection) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nCommunity  associations  must  be  well  established,  operational,  and  fully \nendorsed by project beneficiaries;  \n\nAppraisal  will  be  based  on  a  community  action  plan  (CAP)  prepared  by \nbeneficiaries  with  NGO  assistance  and \nfacilitation.  Community \nassociations will endorse the CAPs. \n\ntechnical \n\n(iii) \n\nIf  after  10  months  the  above  criteria  are  not  satisfied,  a  subproject  will  be \ndropped. \n\n2. \n\nParticipatory Planning and the Community Action Plan (CAP) \n\n5. \nCAPs  will  be  fully  participatory  initiatives  prepared  by  beneficiaries  and  facilitated  by \nNGOs. CAPs will detail (i) community association status and participatory planning history, (ii) \nagreed subproject design and implementation/organization features, (iii) land/house impacts by \nhousehold  and  compensation  agreements,  (v)  agreements  on  land  prices  and  voluntary  land \nlosses, (vi) replacement plots location, (vii) land acquisition and resettlement budgets, and (vii) \neventual involuntary resettlement cases and relative resettlement plan in keeping with the larger \nresettlement policy framework. \n\n3. \n\nResettlement Policy Framework \n\nThe PPLARG will include a resettlement policy framework, which will be prepared based \n6. \non  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Resettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good  Practice.  The  PPLARG  will  establish \ncompensation provisions for land and other losses affecting both informal settlers and eventual \nformal  settlers  and  will  detail  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  implementation/organization \nfeatures,  including  institutional  responsibilities,  disclosure  mechanisms,  grievance  procedures, \nand monitoring/evaluation schemes. \n\n7. \nLand Losses. As for informal settlers, marginal residential land losses (less than 20%) \nwill not be compensated while severe residential land losses (more than 20%) will be replaced \nthrough voluntary land redistribution of their community land. Informal settlers will pay for their \nplots  at  an  agreed  price  and  receive  a  title.  All  land  losses  of  formal  settlers  affected  by \nsubproject developments will be fully compensated in cash at market rates. \n\n8. \nOther Provisions.  All other provisions are the same for informal settlers and eventual \nformal  settlers.  House  impacts  will  be  compensated  in  cash  at  replacement,  cost  free  of \ndemolition and salvaged materials. Crop losses will be compensated at market rates. Business \nlosses  will  be  compensated  through  a  monthly  allowance  equal  to  P1,000  or  to  the  declared \nmonthly  incomes  for  each  month  of  business  interruption.  Settlers  forced  to  relocate  will  also \nreceive a fixed disturbance allowance of P15,000. \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities. DBP, with technical assistance from HUDCC (supported \n9. \nby NHA staff), has overall responsibility for subproject appraisal and resettlement. Liaison with \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\ncommunity  associations  and  NGOs\u2014as  well  as  land  management,  asset  valuation,  and \nentitlement delivery\u2014will be the responsibility of project proponents. \n\n10. \nDisclosure and Grievance Procedures. The resettlement guidelines will be distributed \nin all beneficiary communities and will be disclosed at the ADB country office together with each \napproved CAP. Grievances would be first lodged to a community grievances committee. If the \ncase is not settled within two weeks, the complainant will lodge the grievance to the office of the \nneighborhood  captain.  If  still  unresolved  within  1  month,  the  case  can  be  taken  to  the \nappropriate court. \n\n11.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  The  PMO  will  establish  a  monthly  reporting  system  on \nCAP implementation and resettlement. External monitoring will be assigned to an independent \nagency.  The  PMO  will  report  quarterly  to  ADB  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  External \nmonitoring reports will be submitted to ADB twice a year. \n\nD. \n\nPilot Subprojects \n\n12. \nNine  Pilot  Subprojects  were  Identified.  For  three  of  them,  the  participatory  planning \nprocess  has  been  successfully  concluded  and  CAPs  are  ready  for  appraisal.  One  subproject \nfailed  because  two  community  associations  did  not  agree  on  land  prices  or  the  location  for \ndevelopment.  The  other  four  are  currently  under  preparation  and  will  be  appraised  when  the \nCAPs satisfying the selection criteria are finalized and become available. Details of subprojects \nwith CAPs completed or in the advanced stage of preparation are below. \n\nSapalibutad,  Angeles.  This  subproject  entails  onsite  reblocking,  remains  at  an  initial \n13. \npreparation stage, and is based on a CAP not yet ready for implementation. The target site is a \n2.0 hectare (ha) area inhabited by 300 households represented by the Nagkakaisang Samahan \nng  Sapalibutad  Resettlement.  Subproject  provisions  include  land  security  to  300  local \nhouseholds. A CAP will be available when reblocking impacts have been fully assessed.  \n\n14. \nPulungbulo,  Angeles.  This  offsite  development  subproject  is  fully  prepared  and  is \nbased  on  a  CAP  ready  for  implementation.  The  subproject  site  is  a  0.63  ha  area  to  be \npurchased by Angeles City at P200 per square meter, as set by a deed of sale already issued. \nThe  site  will  be  used  to  resettle  46  informal  households  that  will  be  evicted  from  a  nearby \nproperty, and will also settle additional 21 formal settler households. These 67 households are \nrepresented by the Tinig ng Pagkakaisa ng Pulungbulo Association, which prepared the CAP. \nProvisions include land titling, site preparation, utilities, infrastructure, and livelihood programs. \nThe 41 informal settler households will receive full  compensation at replacement cost for their \nhouses  plus  disturbance  allowances.  House  compensation  will  amount  to  P707,000,  while \nrelocation subsidies will amount to a total of P15,000 for the entire subproject.  \n\n15.  Malabanias, Angeles. This subproject entails onsite reblocking, is fully prepared, and its \nCAP  is  ready  for  implementation.  The  subproject  site  is  a  3,107  ha  area  inhabited  by  253 \nhouseholds  represented  by  the  Acaban  Malabanias  Urban  Poor  Association.  Subproject \nprovisions  include  titled  plots.  Reblocking  will  affect  39  households  to  be  affected  by  fence  or \nhouse damages. Compensation will amount to P231,800 for the entire subproject. \n\n16.            Marisol  BLISS,  Barangay  Ninoy  Aquino,  Angeles.  This  subproject  entails  onsite \nreblocking/upgrading,  is  fully  prepared,  with  CAP  ready  for  implementation.  The  project  is  a \n3,171 ha property. The beneficiary community includes 499 households fully represented by the \nBLISS  Urban  Poor  Association.  Subproject  provisions  include  titled  plots  to  253  households. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n53 \n\nEight  households  are  affected  by  reblocking.  Impacts  consist  in  partial  house  demolition  or \ndamages. Repairs will amount to P154,109.  \n\n17.     Purok Esperanza, Bacolod. This subproject involved onsite upgrading/reblocking, offsite \ndevelopment, and involuntary resettlement for a service road. A CAP has not been successfully \nconcluded  as  beneficiaries  are  split into  two  CAs  with  different  views  on  land  prices  and  CAP \ndetails.  As  a  result,  the  LGU  has  submitted  another  site  to  replace  this  pilot  subproject. \nPreliminary  design  and impact  assessment  indicated  that  400  households  would  participate in \nonsite development and that 20 houses will be relocated in the nearby offsite development area.\n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nA. \n\nEnvironmental Measures \n\n1. \n\nIntroduction \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\n1. \nThis  section  presents  the  summary  of  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE), \nfindings,  and  recommendations  conducted  on  proposed  upgrading  subprojects:  Marisol, \nMalabanias, Sapalibutad, and Pulongbulo in Angeles City; Tangke and Lagtang in Talisay City, \nCebu; Villa Pook Esperanza and Purok Riverside in Bacolod City; and Macabalan in Cagayan \nde Oro. The conduct of the IEEs has allowed timely identification of environmental impacts and \nthe required mitigation measures for the pilot sites. The IEE also led to the revision of one site \ndevelopment  plans  as  proposed  by  the  participating  local  government  units  (LGUs)  and  the \nabandonment of two proposed subprojects. \n\n2. \nThe procedure adopted in identifying all significant environmental impacts from different \nstages of subproject development1 is contained in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) 1993 \nEnvironmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure  Projects  (Checklist  of  Environmental \nParameters  for  Urban  Development  Projects),  and  the  results  were  checked  for  consistency \nagainst  the  new  guidelines,  except  for  the  Sapalibutad  and  Pulongbulo  subprojects  where  the \nADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) were used. A more detailed description of \nenvironmental issues relating to the Project is set out in Supplementary Appendix K. \n\n2. \n\nDescription of the Project and Environment \n\n3. \nAll subprojects involve small-scale civil works such as local roads and drains to improve \nthe environment of poor communities. All subprojects generate small, significant environmental \nimpacts  during  design  and  construction.  The  civil  works  required  in  the  Marisol,  Malaba\u00f1as, \nSapalibutad,  Pulongbulo,  Tangke,  and  Macabalan  subprojects  are  not  substantial  in  terms  of \nscale and cost, and involve mostly onsite improvement of drains, roads, and water distribution. \nThe  proposed  works  by  their  very  nature  mitigate  environmental  impacts  and  reduce  the \ninherent  health  risks  attributable  to  unplanned  development.  However,  the  subproject  areas\u2019 \nhigh  population  density  multiplies  small  environmental  impacts  and  warrants  attention, \nparticularly in the planning stage. \n\n4. \nThe proposed subprojects will upgrade communities with limited available land and plots \nthat  are  still  vacant  are  already  earmarked  for  disposition.  The  constraints  brought  about  by \nunplanned house construction and the complex systems resulting from the contingent layout of \ndrainage  canals  and  water  lines  installed  by  individual  settlers  cause  the  majority  of  identified \nsignificant environmental impacts. Since existing drains and water lines are located in the same \ntrench  and  usually  follow  alleys  and  footpaths,  any  improvement  on  any  of  these  will  interfere \nwith  other  components.  Nonetheless,  the  impacts  on  utilities  are  short-term  and  co-terminus \nwith construction. \n\nThe  environment  of  the  subproject  sites  is  already  urban,  albeit  poorly  serviced.  No \n5. \nsignificant species of flora or fauna were found. Topography varies, but with the exception of the \nTalisay site (see below) is generally flat. Soil conditions also vary from sandy soils to clay. \n\n                                                 \n1  Including location, design, construction, and operation stages. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n55\n\n3. \n\nPotential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n6. \nImpacts  common  to  the  subprojects  and  recommended  mitigation  measures  are \nindicated in Table 1 below. These recommended measures are simple and easy to integrate in \nthe feasibility and detailed engineering studies. \n\nTable A13: DPUCP Subproject Environmental Impacts and \nTypical Recommended Mitigation Measures \n\nImpacts \n\nRecommended Mitigation Measures \n\nEnvironmental problems due to design \n\nInterference with other utilities in same trench \n\nIntensification of water pollution control \n\nCreation of sewage/sanitation problem \n\nEnvironmental problems in construction stage \n\nto  workers  and  nearby \n\nHazards \nto \ncommunicable  diseases  and  from  emissions  of  dust, \nfumes, noise, and vibration \n\nresidents \n\nAccidental damage to utilities in the same trench \n\nWith  residents  and  the  local  water  utility,  prepare  a \ndetailed  map  of  each  residential/subdivision  block \nshowing the alignment of existing water lines. Prepare \nan  excavation  schedule  of  each  section  of \nthe \nproposed  drainage  system  that  avoids  or  minimizes \ninterference with water line. \n\nWith  limited  available  area,  a  combined  sewer  and \ndrainage  canal  is  recommended.  The  prohibitive  cost \nof a centralized sewage treatment plant does not allow \nits  construction.  Ensure  that  all  households  have \nseptic  tanks  that  are  regularly  maintained  for  proper \noperation. \n\nWhen  possible,  re-use  domestic  washwater  coming \nfrom bathrooms and sinks for irrigation. \n\nCover  open  drainage  canals  along  the  major  roads \nwith  concrete  slabs.  Ensure  that  all  households  have \nseptic  tanks  that  are  regularly  maintained.  When \nfeasible,  convert  all  footpaths  and  alleys  as  covered \ndrain  to  ensure  adequate  canal  capacity,  optimize \navailable space, and minimize health risks. \n\nEducate all construction workers on handling sewage. \nEquip  workers  with  proper  protective  gear  such  as \nrubber gloves and boots. To minimize nuisance, heavy \nequipment  operation  should  be  done  during  daytime \n(9-6 pm). Inform affected residents prior to equipment \noperation. \n\nBased  on  the  detailed  map  showing  the  location  of \nwater  pipes  and  excavation  map,  inform  affected \nresidents  on  possible  disturbances  in  water  supply. \nDrainage  canals  to  be  constructed  along/as  footpaths \nthat  will  affect  access  should  be  done  in  phases  and \nimmediately covered by metal sheets or catwalks.  \n\n4. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Management System \n\nBecause subprojects will not have significant environmental impacts, participating LGUs \n7. \nwill  be  required  to  obtain  either  certificates  of  noncoverage  or  environmental  compliance  from \nthe  regional  Environmental  Management  Bureaus  of  the  Department  of  Environment  and \nNatural  Resources  (DENR).  This  will  require  consultant  support  to  the  project  management \noffice (PMO). Part C cofinancing will provide this, while institutionalizing the capacity within the \nDevelopment Bank of the Philippines (DBP). \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nThe  environmental  management  system  is  integrated  into  the  subproject  approval  and \n8. \ncommunity  action  plan  (CAP)  processes.  The  PMO  will  not  approve  subprojects  without  the \nappropriate  environmental  clearance  and  environmental  management  plan.  The  steering \ncommittee  will  monitor  compliance.  The  CAP  process  is  consultative,  and  designs  project \ninterventions with the community concerned and written approval from all community members \nis required (see below).  \n\n5. \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\nAmple opportunities were ensured for the public to participate in the design process of \n\n9. \nall subprojects. These opportunities came in the form of: \n\n(i) \n\nSubproject site walkthroughs with the officers of homeowners associations, local \nhousing  boards,  HUDCC  regional  officers,  bank  officers,  and  jurisdictional  local \ngovernment  officials.  These  walkthroughs,  in  addition  to  a  good  appreciation  of \nthe  subproject  as  platform  for  intervention  where  environmental  impacts  will  be \nidentified  and  evaluated,  allowed  immediate  responses  on  the  subproject \ntopology that maximize positive environmental impacts. During each study team \nvisit, at least three walkthroughs were conducted. \n\n(ii)  Workshops  were  conducted  where  the  subproject  initial  design  was  discussed \nand  ADB\u2019s  environmental  screening  process  is  presented.  The  consultant \nprimarily informed the community of the environmental impacts of the subproject. \nThis workshop also validated the consultant\u2019s assessment of the impacts. During \nthese  workshops,  the  need  to  comply  with  local  environmental  regulations  was \nalso emphasized.  \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nA  one-on-one  discussion  with  the  local  mayor  was  conducted  to  present  in \nsummary  the  findings  and  initial  recommendations  of  the  study  team.  Issues \nraised during the walkthroughs and workshops were revalidated. This discussion \nalso sought to determine the mayor\u2019s priority on subproject implementation. \n\nA  meeting  with  the  regional  HUDCC  and  local  housing  boards,  discussing  the \nissues raised and needed activities for its resolution, were presented by the study \nteam. \n\nA socioeconomic and perception survey was conducted in coordination with local \ncolleges, universities, and institutions, and results were used to assess baseline \nconditions and attitudes on a range of issues including environmental issues. \n\nThe  length  needed  for  the  regional  HUDCC  and  local  housing  board  to  consult  on \n10. \nsubproject design is noteworthy. The communities are asked to prepare a CAP that consisted of \ndocumenting  the  planning  process  and  their  site  development  goals  presented  in  the  form  of \nsubproject proposals. \n\n11. \nThe  CAP  itself  is  a  product  of  an  intensive  consultation  process  as  embodied  by  the \nprinciple  of  participatory  planning  and  community-led  approach  to  development.  This  implies \nthat  interventions  are  conceptualized,  designed,  planned,  and  implemented  by  community \nmembers  themselves  in  close  collaboration  with  the  local  government  and  guided  by  sound \nurban  planning,  social,  and  environmental  principles.  The  CAP  is  the  result  of  consensual \nagreements  that  could  only  be  achieved  through  constant  interaction  among  those  involved. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n57\n\nAside  from  documenting  the  public  consultations  undertaken,  the  CAP  outlines  proposals  and \ndesigns from community members themselves.  \n\n12. \nLGUs  themselves  incorporate  consultation  in  their  activities.  LGUs  have  ensured  that \nthey  properly  consulted  all  affected  persons,  including  owners  of  assets  and  occupants  of \nprivate lands affected by right-of-way acquisition and other subprojects development. Individual \nvisits  and  consultation  meetings  were  conducted.  Minutes  of  the  meetings  and  agreements \nreached were properly documented in the CAP, including the master list of affected persons.  \n\n6. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n13. \n\nAll proposed subprojects were evaluated and the key findings are set out below. \n\na. \n\nRevision of Lagtang Site Development Plan to Avoid Significant \nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nThe  initial  development  plans  for  the  Lagtang  Upgrading  Subproject,  as  submitted  by \n14. \nTalisay  City  to  HUDCC,  were  revised  to  avoid  severe  environmental  impacts  inherent  to  the \nsubproject locations. The Lagtang subproject site has steep slopes and soil highly vulnerable to \nerosion,  necessitating  the  reduction  from  80  to  30  lots.  This  reduction  is  based  solely  on  the \nslope  limitation  that  was  set  for  this  subproject  at  30%.  It  should  be  emphasized  that  this \nthreshold is above the Bureau of Soils and Water Management (BSWM) recommendation. The \nBSWM  classifies \nfor \nhomesite/subdivision  development.  The  higher  slope  threshold  was  set  for  this  subproject \nconsidering  that  there  are  several  existing  houses  that  adopted  practical  erosion  control \ntechniques,  allowing  them  to  adapt  to  the  site.  These  practices  include  limiting  the  height  of \nstructures, minimizing the cut, and avoiding construction of houses between terraces. Reducing \nand  constructing  erosion-control  devices  during  house  construction  will  minimize  the  risk  of \nerosion to an acceptable level and will not require further environmental impact assessment. \n\nthan  15%  slope  as  marginally  suitable \n\nlands  with  greater \n\n15. \nProper  mitigation  measures  to  minimize  erosion  should  be  integrated  in  local  building \nordinances,  particularly  for  this  site.  Simple  construction  procedures,  in  addition  to  preventing \nsettlers  from  residing  in  areas  with  more  than  a  30%  slope,  should  be  adopted.  This  will  (i) \nminimize  the  loss  of  vegetation;  (ii)  decrease  the  slope  and  its  length,  and  (iii)  minimize  soil \ndisturbance such as increased pulverization. \n\nb. \n\nReplacement of the Esperanza Upgrading Subproject  \n\n16. \nVilla Pook Esperanza is a former city dump, and was not properly closed before the site \nwas  settled  by  informal  dwellers.  This  site  poses  serious  environmental  risks.  Although  the \nvolume of waste dumped is relatively small, estimated at 16,188 metric tons, its composition is \nunknown  and  assumed  to  contain  hazardous  waste.  Anecdotal  information  from  the  settlers \nindicated  that  hospitals  waste  was  dumped  there.  The  poor  load-bearing  capacity  of \nuncompacted municipal waste jeopardizes the structural stability of proposed roads. The main \nrecommendation is to scrape all waste dumped on vacant areas and fill the vacant areas with \nsoil  as  part  of  the  proposed  upgrading.  A  vacant  area  within  the  site  will  be  converted  into  a \nsmall sanitary landfill where the scraped waste will be transferred. This landfill will subsequently \nbe  used  as  open  area  consistent  with  Bacolod  City\u2019s  land  use  plan.  An  environmental  impact \nassessment  is  needed  to  determine  solid  waste  impacts  such  as  groundwater  contamination. \nEsperanza  poses  significant  environmental  impacts  and  was  deemed  unsuitable  as  a  pilot \nsubproject. \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nBacolod  Housing  Authority  (BHA)  proposed  Purok  Riverside  as  a  replacement  to  the \n17. \nEsperanza  subproject.  Pook  Riverside  is  located  along  the  Banago  Creek.  An  initial \nenvironmental examination found no significant environmental impacts related to the subproject, \nbut some small impacts were identified due to the site\u2019s location near an ecologically sensitive \nswamp  area.  The  removal  of  some  mangrove  trees  is  unavoidable.  Most  significant  impacts \nwould  occur  only  during  construction:  (i)  hazards  to  workers  through  contact  with  untreated \nsewage during construction and drain improvement; (ii) dust from earthmoving and from heavy \nequipment  exhaust;  and  (iii)  temporary  local  flooding  during  backfilling.  Mitigation  measures \nhave been identified, including (i) education and protective clothing for workers; (ii) operation of \nheavy/noisy equipment only during day time, (iii) informing residents of work schedules; and (iv) \ntemporary bunding of houses and other facilities likely to be inundated. \n\nA review of Bacolod City\u2019s zoning map indicated that Purok Riverside is classified as a \n18. \nresidential area. The DENR-EMB  Regional Office informed BHA that the area is not classified \nas environmentally critical or part of the protected areas system.  \n\nc. \n\nDeferment of the Naga City Triangulo/CBD II Site Development \nSubprojects \n\n19. \nSubprojects in Naga City involve upgrading Triangulo and Central Business District II. It \nhas a similar infrastructure development component requires upgrades footpaths, alleys, roads, \nwater supply, and drains. As previously discussed, these components will have easy-to-manage \nimpacts  common  to  all  subprojects.  Like  Lagtang  and  Villa  Pook  Esperanza,  the  Naga  City2 \nsubproject sites include the major development constraint that they are flood-prone. Triangulo is \nabout 180 meters away from the Bicol River, the main drain of the Bicol Basin with headwaters \nin Lakes Buhi, Bato, and Umbao. The subprojects will be of little value to the community unless \nflooding is addressed. This can only be done at the city level, if not at the basin scale, and these \nsubprojects are therefore recommended for deferral until flooding is addressed. \n\n7.  \n\nConclusions and Recommendations \n\n20. \nThe  nature  of  the  proposed  subprojects,  being  community  upgrading  or  new  site \ndevelopment,  will  fundamentally  improve  the  urban  environment  through  improved  access, \nproper  handling  and  disposal  of  domestic  wastewater,  avoidance  of  flood  damage,  and \nprovision of potable water. Also inherent to upgrading subprojects is the dense population at the \nconstruction site, so even simple excavations will have an impact, however small. \n\n21. \nThis  Project  emphasizes  the  importance  of  conducting  an  early  environmental \nexamination to allow environmental considerations during subproject site identification, design, \nand feasibility analysis. The findings and recommendations enriched the engineering designs to \nincorporate  simple  mitigation  measures  like  dust  suppression,  timing  of  heavy  equipment \noperation to avoid noise disturbances, proper handling of domestic wastewater and its reuse for \nirrigation. The IEE also pointed out the need to revise the engineering designs to avoid erosion \nand groundwater contamination, and other environmental impacts. \n\n22. \nLocal  proponents  of  community  upgrading  subprojects  lack  the  expertise  to  conduct \nenvironmental  examinations.  Although  it  would  be  ideal  to  build  the  communities\u2019  capability  to \nassess  environmental  impacts,  the  cost  and  its  limited  use  at  the  administrative  level  do  not \n\n                                                 \n2  In  fact,  the  entire  Naga  City  is  flood-prone;  based  on  the  Camaligan  Flood  Gauge  Station,  12  serious  floods \n\noccurred in the area during the last 18 years, reaching depths as high as 4.04 meters. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n59\n\nwarrant investment along this line. The capacity-building TA should establish an environmental \nmanagement unit capable of assisting the PMO, LGUs, and communities to undertake IEEs of \nproposed  subprojects  and  to  guide  them  in  complying  with  the  Government\u2019s  environmental \nregulations and funding agencies\u2019 procedural requirements. \n\n23. \nLocal  Governments  will  need  to  ensure  that  all  subprojects  secure  an  environmental \ncompliance  certificate  or  a  certificate  of  noncoverage  from  the  Environmental  Management \nBureau-Department of Environment and Natural Resources (EMB-DENR). Proponents will likely \nbe  able  to  comply  with  the  EMB-DENR  environmental  impact  statement  guidelines  with  few \nchanges to the IEEs. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY (SPRSS) FORM \n\n  \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nYes/No \nYes \n\nSector identified as a National Priority in Country \nPoverty Analysis?   \n\nSector identified as a National Priority in Country \nPoverty Partnership Agreement?   \n\nYes/No \nYes \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the Philippines:  \nThe  project  will  have  direct  poverty  reduction  effects  on  its  beneficiaries.  Slum  upgrading/community  empowerment  will  lead  to  safer, \nhealthier, and better-organized communities where poverty reduction can be systematically pursued. Greater land security will foster social \nresponsibility/ownership  benefits  and,  through  eventual  land  titling,  will  offer  the  beneficiaries  with  formal  lending  options.  The  project  will \nalso  involve  various  community-designed  livelihood  improvement  initiatives,  which  may  include  microfinance  development,  cottage \nindustry/trade development, community services, and construction of light infrastructure. Through these initiatives, project beneficiaries will \nbe  provided  with  untapped  income  sources  and  the  means  to  maximize  their  time  and  existing  resources.  The  project  will  also  directly \naddress the socioeconomic disruption caused by flooding. \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nB. \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nPoverty analysis will be integral to subproject selection/design and will be based on quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Subproject \nselection  will  include  the  combined  analysis  of  sector  poverty  data  with  country,  region,  and  subproject  poverty  data  and  involve  poverty \nassessments and stakeholder consultation in the field. Subproject planning/design will entail intensive qualitative analysis, directly involving \nproject beneficiaries through the extensive use of participatory methods to identify the local poor population and provisions to better fit their \nneeds. The poverty impact analysis based on the analysis of pilot subprojects has yielded a poverty impact ratio of 0.6. \nPoverty Classification                                                                                                                                          Core Poverty Intervention \n\nProposed Classification \n\nParticipation Process \n\nC. \nStakeholder Analysis \u2013 Identify consultations needed at Project Design (see Appendix 4):  \nPublic consultation/participation will be at the core of project design as subprojects will be selected through stakeholder consultation and will \nbe  prepared  through  community-driven  design  mechanisms.  A  condition  for  subproject  approval  will  be  the  preparation  of  a  participatory \ncommunity action plan (CAP) endorsed by the beneficiary communities. \nParticipation strategy required                                                                                                                               Yes/No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nPlan Requiredb \n\nFull/Short/ \nNot Known/ None \n(not applicable) \nRP included in CAP \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nthe  project  preparatory \n\nResettlement needs/significance for the core subprojects has been determined \nby \ntechnical  assistance  after  site  selection. \nResettlement plans (RP) have been incorporated in CAPs prepared through a \nfully  participatory  process  with  project  stakeholders.  During  CAP  preparation, \none  planned  core-subproject  was  removed  from  the  project  scope.  CAPs  for \nthe other 4 core-subprojects are included in Supplementary Appendix L. \nWomen  will  be  fully  represented  in  participatory  design  so  as  to  ensure  that \nshelter/upgrading provisions reflect the women\u2019s role in the domestic economy \nand  that  health/income-generation  benefits  reflect  women\u2019s  needs.  Particular \nattention to women will be also given in the distribution of land-tenure rights.  \nA  Gender  Plan  is  being  prepared  and  will  be  included  in  Supplementary \nAppendix L. \nWhen  land  security  schemes  involve  buying  residential  plots  or  developing \nmicrofinance schemes, land prices and repayment rates  will be fixed so as to \nbe  commensurate  to  beneficiaries\u2019  capacity  to  pay.  The  project  design  has \naddressed this issue (Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix B). \nCAPs for each subproject will consider the distribution of project-derived jobs to \nbeneficiaries. \n\nNone  encountered  in  pilot  sites.
