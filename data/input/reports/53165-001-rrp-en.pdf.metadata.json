Energy SOEs, which comprise roughly 60% of total SOE assets, \nhave been a major driver of these losses (footnote 5). The country\u2019s energy sector circular debt \nis  a  key  constraint  on  reviving  economic  growth. 8 The  World  Bank  estimated  that  Pakistan\u2019s \npower subsector inefficiencies cost the economy $18 billion (6.5% of GDP) in 2015.9 The high \ncost  and  low  quality  of  electricity  supply  have  reduced  the  country\u2019s  trade  and  export \n\n \n\n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Circular debt arises from payables to power generators and fuel suppliers. These are caused by electricity system \nlosses  including  commercial  losses,  non-payment  of  financial  obligations  by  various  types  of  end-users  and \nregulatory deficiencies. Circular debt flow is the increase in payables towards suppliers in a certain period. Circular \ndebt stock is the accumulated liabilities towards suppliers and lenders. \n\n3  ADB. 2019.

Rising  capacity  payments  (fixed \npayments to power plants to remain online and available) from rapid generation investments is \nanother challenge that requires deeper reforms and policy support from development partners. \n \n5. \nEvolution of circular debt. The first major sector reforms, endorsed in 1992 after years \nof severe power shortages, covered four key elements: restructuring, private sector participation, \ncreation of an independent regulator, and competitive power generation. This led to unbundling \nof  the  vertically  integrated  utility,  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  (WAPDA). 12 \nFormulation of the National Power Policy and the announcement of incentives to attract private \ncapital in 1994 led to $5 billion in private investment and 4,500 megawatts (MW) of new capacity, \nmostly  oil-based  because  of  its  short  gestation  period.  However,  furnace  oil  prices  rose  from \nPRs2,800 per ton in 1997 to PRs75,000 per ton in 2019, pushing up electricity generation costs \nsignificantly. To moderate tariff increases, the government provided tariff differential subsidies to \ncover  about two-thirds  of the  population  with  lower  electricity  consumption  level.  However, the \ndeteriorating  economic  situation  made  it  difficult  for  the  government  to  sustain  the  subsidies, \nwhich  combined  with  high  technical  and  commercial  losses,  led  to  liquidity  crises  among \ndistribution companies (DISCOs) that were unable to fully pay for electricity supply to generation \ncompanies,  independent  power  producers,  and  WAPDA, 13  creating  circular  debt.  By  2012, \ncircular debt totaled PRs460 billion. Moreover, the liquidity crisis led to inadequate investment in \ncritical infrastructure to meet growing electricity demand, resulting in capacity shortage of up to \n7,000 MW, or 30% of total capacity, and 12\u201316 hours of daily load shedding across Pakistan.14 \n \nIn 2013, the government paid off PRs480 billion of circular debt liabilities, giving a fresh \n6. \nstart  to  the  power  subsector,  but  was  not  able  to  address  all  the  root  causes.  Circular  debt \ncontinued to increase, although close government monitoring through the IMF\u2019s EFF for 2013\u2013\n201615 and ADB\u2019s SESRP slowed the pace. The sharp decline in international fuel prices in 2015 \nalso  helped  control  new  circular  debt  accumulation.  After  the  IMF  and  ADB  programs  were \ncompleted,  however,  circular  debt  soared  during  the  general  elections  cycle  in  2018,  when \ngeneration facilities operated as much as possible to minimize load shedding regardless of cost \nand  insufficient  tariff  adjustments.  In  parallel,  during  2016\u20132018,  power  generation  capacity \nincreased  by  12,200  MW  through  foreign  direct  investments  and  government\u2013government \ncontracts. Without addressing the underlying liquidity issues in the subsector, circular debt, which \nstood at PRs729 billion in June 2017, had increased to PRs1,600 billion by June 2019. Of this, \n68% was from delayed tariff notifications, nearly 20% from the difference between the allowed \nand actual collections and losses by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), \nand nearly 10% from insufficient subsidies.16 \n\n \n\n10 ADB.  2019.

Washington, DC. \n\n16 Monthly reports of the Ministry of Energy. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nInadequate  tariffs  and  inefficient  subsidies.  Until  2018,  NEPRA  determined  tariffs \n7. \n(NDTs) as the cost of supply based on petitions from DISCOs, and the government notified end \nuser tariffs with a mix of subsidies and NDTs. The gap between the notified tariffs and the NDTs \nwas effectively the subsidy. Through the EFF and SESRP, the government successfully reduced \nsubsidies  from  1.8%  of  GDP  in  2013  to  0.4%  in  2017.  However,  the  balance  of  payment  and \nbudget crises in FY2018 caused the government to fall short in its subsidy payments to DISCOs \nbecause of insufficient budget allocations. The lack of subsidy payments during the record surge \nof generation costs added to the unprecedented level of circular debt. \n \n8. \nA  multiyear  tariff  mechanism  was  implemented  through  SESRP  to  reduce  tariff-setting \ndelays.17 However, lawsuits filed by DISCOs against NEPRA in 2016, claiming that NDTs were \ninadequate and had underestimated system losses and overestimated collections, stalled tariff \nupdates and led to serious cash shortages for DISCOs. FY2015 tariffs were in place until 2018, \nduring which time generation costs continued to increase rapidly. Generation fuel price changes \nare adjusted  automatically  in tariffs,  but  no such mechanism  exists  for  an  increase  in  capacity \npayments,  including  its  foreign  exchange  component,  impact  of  which  became  larger  as  the \nPakistan rupee depreciated by nearly 48% against the United States dollar during 2016\u20132019. \nThe stalled tariff revisions for 3 years led to a large backlog of uncharged system cost, contributing \nsignificantly to the rise of circular debt. \n \nHigh cost of generation. In addition to administrative issues with tariffs and subsidies, \n9. \nthe power generation mix contributed to high supply cost. Traditionally, incentive policies favored \ndevelopment of thermal power plants.18 In 1994, hydro power comprised more than 80% of the  \ngeneration mix, but by 2014, thermal power plants made up 73% of supply, increasing the power \nsubsector\u2019s reliance on imported fuel and vulnerability to balance of payment crises.19 Continuing \nto operate inefficient power plants because of the lack of monitoring of actual capacity (installed \nversus  rated)  and  fuel  availability  exacerbates  the  issue.  This  will  be  partly  addressed  by  the \nplanned  retirement  of  nearly  4,000  MW  of  inefficient  thermal  power  plants  upto  2024  as  their \npower purchase agreements expire. However, new power plants with 8,000 MW of generation \ncapacity will be added during 2019\u20132023, bringing total generation capacity to 35,500 MW that \nwill add to higher capacity payments. Renewable energy development, infrastructure retrofitting, \nand commercially sound operations will be key to reducing costs in the mid to long run.20 \n \n10. \nUnsustainable losses. Electricity network losses and leakages also intensify the liquidity \ncrisis. DISCOs estimate of 18.3% transmission and distribution loss and 10.0% nonrecovery of \nbilled amounts leads to almost 29.0% revenue loss, 4% higher than FY2016 levels.21 This puts \nDISCOs  in  a  negative  spiral  of  limited  investments  and  increasingly  poor  efficiency,  making \nsystem losses a recurring cause of circular debt. \n \n11.  Weak  governance.  Despite  attempts  to  corporatize  power  SOEs,  the  corporate \ngovernance has remained weak and uneven across SOEs, losses have persisted, accumulating \nto over $2 billion in FY2018. The resulting lack of creditworthiness limits financing options and \nhas made power SOEs primarily reliant on sovereign financing for capital projects.22 With limited \n\n17 In this mechanism, the principles of regulating the returns and profits of licensees and the trajectory of the individual \n\ncost and revenue elements of the utilities are determined in advance for multiple years. \n\n18 The major incentive policies were the power policies of 1994, 2002, and 2015. The combined additional capacity \n\n \n\nbased on these policies is 21,500 MW. \n\n19 Of about 18,705 MW generation capacity being added in 2017\u20132022, 21.0% is hydro power, 8.5% is solar, 3.5% is \nlocal coal, 39.0% is imported coal, 11.0% is nuclear, 14.0% is regasified liquefied natural gas, and 3.0% is imported. \n\n20 About $35 billion is being invested in 15 generation and transmission projects with take-or-pay contracts. \n21 DISCOs\u2019 transmission and distribution losses for FY2018 were 18.32%, against the NEPRA target of 15.30%. \n22 Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance. 2018. Annual Budget document FY2018\u2013FY2019. Islamabad. \n\n \n\n\finvestments,  DISCOs  do  not  meet  NDT\u2019s  benchmark  loss  reduction  and  collection  targets. \nReliance on sovereign financing has also led to heavy public sector  influence on their governance \nstructures,  and  board  and  management  positions  at  DISCOs  are  held  mainly  by  government-\naffiliated personnel with inadequate sector experience. Incumbents sitting on multiple boards of \nenergy entities exacerbate this issue. NEPRA publishes performance evaluation reports of key \nsector  entities,  but  it  lacks  resources,  and  enforcing  penalties  and  setting  target  loss  levels  in \nNDTs to encourage improvements remain the only corrective measures. \n \nLack of integrated planning. Since 1985, Pakistan has encountered intermittent energy \n12. \nsupply\u2013demand  imbalances  as  a  result  of  the  absence  of  integrated  planning.  This  has \nmanifested  in  an  uneven  generation  mix,  unbalanced  switching  costs  between  gas  and  power \nsubsectors, and mismatch between idle generation capacity and network availability. Despite rich \nsolar  and  wind  resources  throughout  the  country,  Pakistan  lacks  a  coordinated  policy  to \nincentivize and drive up solar and wind deployment and continues to rely on high cost imported \ngas-based  generation  that  negatively  affects  affordability.  Further,  power  subsector  planning \nneeds to be coordinated with energy security policies, including the development of indigenous \ngas, coal, and hydropower resources. In the gas subsector, the large import of liquefied natural \ngas  (LNG)  since  2016  has  helped  curb  the  gas  shortage,  but  its  high  price  is  posing  a  new \nchallenge.  Without  an  integrated  energy  sector  planning,  Pakistan  has  not  been  able  to  take \nadvantage of its own resources to achieve an optimal mix of indigenous gas and LNG, and an \noptimal power generation mix from imported fuel, indigenous fuel, and renewable energy. \n \n13. \nPrevious reform efforts supported by ADB. The previous governments attempted to \nresolve  such  issues  as  tariff  delays  and  high  generation  costs  with  ADB  support  through  the \nAccelerating Economic Transformation Program (AETP) in 2008\u20132009 and the SESRP in 2014\u2013\n2017. 23 Notable  achievements  of  AETP  include  automatic  fuel  cost  adjustment  in  tariffs  and \ndetailed analysis of causes of circular debt.  Under SESRP, tariff rationalization and debt service \nsurcharges were implemented, which were key in reducing subsidies. Three DISCOs received \nmultiyear tariffs under new tariff guidelines. The single buyer in the power subsector was made \ninto an independent entity and designated as the country\u2019s first market operator. The government \namended  the  1997  NEPRA  Act  substantially  and  clarified  the  government\u2019s  policy-making \nfunctions  and  NEPRA\u2019s  regulatory  functions,  especially  in  tariff  setting.  The  amendments  also \nprovided the foundation for an electricity trading market and an appellate tribunal as a dedicated \ndispute settlement mechanism for NEPRA decisions. \n \n14. \nHowever, the IMF program went off-track in 2010, hampering completion of the energy sector \npolicy actions of AETP such as its circular debt resolution plan.  After SESRP, tariff reforms did not \nyield results as court cases stalled new tariff notifications until 2019. The circular debt management \nplan developed in SESRP did not anticipate the surge of generation costs fully and relied too heavily \non efficiency improvements and sales proceeds from DISCO privatization. Yet privatization proved to \nbe  more  challenging  than  the  government\u2019s  expectation.  NEPRA  Act  amendments  would  have \nprovided new tools to control circular debt, but they were not enacted until April 2018. The combination \nof these factors set the previous reform efforts back, resulting in the current liquidity crisis. \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\nB. \n \n15. \nThe new government has developed reform action plans in its new electricity policy and \nthe concept of integrated energy planning. A large part of these efforts will be on optimizing the \n\n23 ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendations of the President to the Board of Directors.

ADB will support this reform through the \nproposed programmatic approach with three subprograms during 2019\u20132022. In developing the \nprogram,  ADB  has  undertaken  multiple  diagnostic  and  analytical  studies  since  2018. 24  The \nfindings  recommended  prioritizing  the recurring  financial  sustainability  issues  to  streamline  the \ntariff  notification  cycle;  strengthening  energy  accounting;  and  reducing  generation  costs  by \ninducting  solar,  wind,  and  hydropower  without  capacity  charges  as  well  as  by  addressing  the \nsector\u2019s  governance  and  infrastructure  constraints.  The  program\u2019s  three  pillars  are  financial \nsustainability (including actions for climate challenge), governance, and infrastructure.25 \n \n16. \nReform area 1: financial sustainability improved. Through the programmatic approach, \nactions in this pillar will aim to address inefficient tariffs and subsidies, high generation costs, system \nlosses,  and  lack  of  integrated  planning.  While  accumulated  circular  debt  poses  a  threat  to  the \neconomy, the immediate priority is to stop further accumulation, or the flow, of circular debt and \nfocus on the stock reduction through the subsequent subprograms. In subprogram 1, a series of \ntariff notifications in 2019, adjusted a backlog of PRs469 billion. Further, the tariffs are now based \non the new uniform tariff mechanism under NEPRA Act amendments, which incorporate budgeted \nsubsidies and cross-subsidization among DISCOs to help control sector deficits. A new circular debt \nreduction plan based on these tariff mechanisms, a historic level of system efficiency improvements, \nand an antitheft program that has recovered PRs89 billion since November 2018, among others, \nwas  developed  to  monitor  quarterly  targets  and  progress.  These  efforts  and  timely  subsidy \npayments reduced circular debt flow from PRs38 billion per month in August 2018 to PRs21 billion \nper month in August 2019. When fully implemented the flow is expected to be further reduced to \nwithin PRs6 billion per month by 30 June 2021. Under this plan, the government also aims to reduce \nsubsidies from 0.56% of GDP in FY2020 to 0.40% during FY2021\u2013FY2023 through better targeting. \nThe plan also includes indicative priority areas to address stock of circular debt, which is highlighted \nin para. 17 below. The Renewable Energy Policy 2019, assisted by ADB and other partners, targets \n20% (10,000 MW) renewable energy capacity by 2025 and 30% (15,000 MW) by 2030, and aims \nto shift the generation mix to contain only 15% imported fuel by 2030. \n \n17. \nIn subprogram 2, the government plans to further amend the NEPRA Act to introduce an \nautomatic  mechanism  for  updating  power  generation  costs  in  tariffs  each  quarter  without \ngovernment notification and instituting surcharges for balancing cost of supply. Generation costs \ncomprise more than 75% of end user tariffs currently, and the automated mechanism will prevent \nthe backlog of system costs even if tariff notifications are delayed. The government and NEPRA \nalso  aim  to  notify  FY2021  tariffs  before  the  fiscal  year  starts  in  July  2020,  correcting  the  tariff \nnotification schedule for the first time. With such progress, the circular debt reduction plan will be \nexpanded to reduce circular debt stock. This may include (i) using the sales proceeds of some \ngeneration  assets,  (ii)  divesting  power  subsector  transmission  and  distribution  SOEs  through \ninitial public offerings, (iii) rolling tariff subsidies into social assistance program targeting only the \npoorest households, and (iv) converting portions of stock into public debt. The National Electricity \nPolicy and Plan will be approved as the foundation of integrated planning. \n\n18. \nBy  subprogram  3,  in  parallel  with  monitoring  of  circular  debt  reduction  plan  targets, \nmultiyear tariffs are planned to be introduced for all DISCOs to help NEPRA determine tariffs on \ntime.  A  mechanism  to  link  DISCOs\u2019  revenue  margins  with  their  performance  is  expected  to \n\n \n\n24 Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Energy  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  The \nassessment is based on findings from ADB. 2017. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the \nUpdate on Energy Sector Plan. Manila. \n\n25 The sequencing of reforms under each area is in the policy matrix in Appendix 4. Subprogram 1 will contribute $45 \nmillion  to  climate  mitigation  financing  through  declining  carbon  dioxide  emissions  by  implementing  a  renewable \nenergy policy ($15 million) and an unaccounted-for-gas reduction program ($30 million). \n\n \n\n\fReform  area  2: \n\nencourage  efficiency  improvements  and  provide  more  cash  resources  to  control  circular  debt. \nApproval of the integrated energy plan (2020\u20132047) will help the government with energy planning \nand optimize energy systems, even beyond the scope of the programmatic approach. \n \ninstitutional  and  regulatory  governance  strengthened.  For \n19. \nsubprogram  1,  NEPRA  concluded  public  consultations  for  the  market-oriented  electricity \nsubsector financial settlement model, which was developed with ADB support and is a key step \nin this continued effort since SESRP.26 A cabinet committee approved the privatization plan of \ntwo regasified LNG-based power plants whose proceeds can help retire part of the circular debt \nstock. The Ministry of Energy (MOE) approved and initiated the separation of policy and regulatory \nfunctions in the petroleum subsector to streamline the sector\u2019s business processes and promote \nmore investments. The MOE and the Ministry of Law and Justice initiated the establishment of an \nappellate tribunal as a dispute resolution mechanism for NEPRA decisions. The government also \napproved the requirement of female representation on SOE boards. \n \n20. \nSubprograms  2  and  3  will  induce  professional  management to  improve  the  operational \nand  financial  parameters  of  sector  entities,  which  will  also  facilitate  private  investments  and \nownership. Competitive selection of management personnel will raise the chances of appointing \nskilled managers. The separation of the technical and commercial segments in two DISCOs and \nthe completion of the regasified LNG power plant privatization will pave the way for management \ncontracts and other forms of private sector participation. The MOE\u2019s gas sector restructuring plan \nwill be a plan for the unbundling of the gas sector into transmission and distribution companies, \nthird-party access to gas transmission lines, and eventual private ownership in gas companies. \nThe  appellate  tribunal  for  NEPRA  decisions  will  be  made  operational,  and  results  will  be \nmonitored by MOE.  \n \n21. \nReform  area  3:  energy  (power  and  gas)  infrastructure  improved.  Infrastructure \ninvestments  are  urgently  needed  to  improve  system  reliability,  efficiency,  and  access,  and  to \ntackle  circular  debt  technical  issues.  While  the  program  will  be  complemented  by  ADB\u2019s \ninvestment portfolio and pipeline on transmission and distribution expansion,27 it will also promote \nprivate  investments  in  energy  supply  infrastructure.  For  subprogram  1, the  MOE  approved the \ngas loss reduction plan prepared by gas transmission SOEs. It has also revised the 2012 incentive \npolicy  to  streamline  regulatory  approvals  and  encourage more  rigorous oil  and  gas  production \ninvestments to reduce the need for imported fuel for energy and transport. \n \n22. \nSubprograms  2  and  3  will  focus  on  off-grid  and  rural  electrification,  which  constitutes \npower supply to about 30% of the population; continued auction of oil and gas concessions to \nreduce dependency on imported fuel for power generation and energy needs; implementation of \nnet metering in five DISCOs; 28 and modernization of the electricity system operator, the National \nPower Control Center. \n\n23. \nChoice of programmatic approach. The programmatic approach will provide multiyear \npolicy  engagement  aligned  with  the  EFF,  SPBL,  and  other  development  partner  programs. \nContinued  engagement  is  key  as  complex  reforms  take  multiple  years  to  implement  and  yield \nresults.  Subprograms  2  and  3  will  be  designed  as  new  lending  programs  based  on  indicative \n\n26 ADB. 2014.

ADB\u2019s value addition is based on its long-term engagement with \npolicy-based  and  investment  loans  in  Pakistan.  The  program  builds  on  ADB\u2019s  earlier  policy \ninterventions. Actions such as uniform tariffs and the appellate tribunal are based on the NEPRA \nAct amendments supported by SESRP and the circular debt reduction plan incorporates lessons \nfrom  previous  plans  (para.  16).  Sector  assistance  program  evaluation  recommendations  to \nimprove  financial  sustainability,  strengthen  sector  governance  and  integrated  planning,  and \nsupport  physical  and technological  investments  became  the  program\u2019s  reform  areas.  An  ADB-\nassisted study on sector reforms provided the basis for formulating policy actions (footnote 24). \n \nADB can provide comprehensive support, and the government can identify and sequence \n25. \nkey reforms with support from ADB\u2019s policy engagement from the programmatic approach. ADB \nwill support reform implementation through technical assistance (TA) in areas such as developing \nand monitoring the progress of the circular debt reduction plan, implementing the market-based \nfinancial settlement model, and establishing the appellate tribunal.29 ADB\u2019s pipeline loan projects \nare aligned with the identified infrastructure needs and supplement reform actions (footnote 27). \n \n26. \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  ADB  is  taking  the  lead  in  providing  an  energy-\nsector-focused policy program, which has been coordinated with and complements projects and \nprograms of key development partners. The program underpins energy sector reforms in the IMF \nEFF  and  SPBL  by  addressing  structural  constraints  and  their  negative  impact  on  economic \ngrowth.  Policy  actions  on  tariff  notification,  the  circular  debt  reduction  plan,  and  automatic \nquarterly adjustments are in the EFF and SPBL, which support the upstream aspects of these \nactions, while the programmatic approach will further support downstream implementation and \nmonitoring.  All three  reform  areas  are supported  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  projects,  and the  programmatic \napproach allows ADB to provide follow-up support for deepening reform initiatives. The circular \ndebt reduction plan, jointly agreed by ADB, IMF and the World Bank, has been approved by the \nMinistry of Energy. The plan is endorsed by the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet, \nwhich will monitor its implementation. The debt sustainability analysis, program monitoring, and \nthe sequencing of disbursements of the subprograms have been fully coordinated with the IMF. \n30 ADB  has  supported  the  preparation  of  the  National  Electricity  Policy  2019,  the  Renewable \nEnergy Policy 2019, and the 25-year Integrated Energy Plan with inputs from other development \npartners.  The  World  Bank  is  preparing  a  development  policy  credit  for  approval  in  2020  that \nincludes  policy  actions  to  reduce  circular  debt stock  to  complement the ADB  program.  ADB  is \nalso  coordinating  with  the  Export-Import  Bank  of  Korea,  the  German  development  bank,  the \nFrench Development Agency, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency on the design of \ntheir complementary programs and on potential cofinancing plans. \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\nC. \n \n27. \nThe key impact of the program is reduced financial, technical, and governance deficits in \nthe energy sector. By 2024 and with successful program implementation, new accumulation of \ncircular debt per year will be reduced from PRs450 billion in FY2019 to PRs50 billion, accumulated \npayables  will  drop  from  PRs800  billion  in  2018  to  less  than  PRs250  billion,  and  the  weighted \naverage electricity generation cost will fall from $0.097 per kilowatt-hour in 2019 to $0.070 per \n\n29 ADB. 2019.

The appellate tribunal is expected to resolve 60% of cases on NEPRA decisions \nwithin 6 months; such cases are currently taken to court, where decisions may take years. \n \n28. \nUnder the circular debt reduction plan, the government expects improvement in DISCOs\u2019 \ncollections from 94.7% in 2019 to 99.4% in 2022 and in losses in six distribution companies by \n1%  annually,  generating  additional revenues  of PRs118  billion  by  end  FY2023.  Better  subsidy \ntargeting is expected to reduce subsidy (para. 16). \n \nD. \n \n29. \nThe  average  GDP  growth  rate  for  FY2019\u2013FY2024  is  forecast  to  average  3.9%,  with \ninflation  expected  to  rise  to  an  average  of  9.1%,  which  will  continue  to  constrain  government \nfinances.  The  fiscal  deficit  is  estimated  to  be  6.8%  of  GDP  in  FY2020  (about  $16  billion)  and \nexpected to remain high until FY2021. The government\u2019s external financing needs are expected \nto be $29.9 billion in FY2020 and continue to increase through FY2024 (footnote 4). Of this, the \nIMF will provide $2.4 billion and ADB will contribute $2.1 billion in FY2020 (footnote 5). Sector-\nspecific  requirements  constitute  $600  million  per  year  by  implementing  an  energy  (power  and \ngas)  loss  reduction  programs  through  expansion  and  rehabilitation  of  downstream  energy \ninfrastructure. \n \nTo support growing development financing needs, ADB proposes to provide $1 billion of \n30. \npolicy-based  loans  through  a  programmatic  approach  to  be  implemented  through  three \nsubprograms.  For  subprogram  1,  the  government  has  requested  a  concessional  loan  of  $300 \nmillion from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a \n25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2% per year during the grace \nperiod and thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nThe Export-Import Bank of Korea has confirmed $80 million cofinancing for subprogram 1, and \ncofinancing  options  will  be  explored  for  subprograms  2  and  3.  Financing  under  the  proposed \nprogram  is  integrated  into  the  IMF\u2019s  debt  analysis. 31 The  development  policy  letter  from  the \ngovernment is in Appendix 3. \n \nE. \n \n31. \nThe Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency and responsible for overall program \nmonitoring and reporting, and the MOE and NEPRA will be the implementing agencies. Two TA \nprojects will support the policy actions (footnotes 24 and 29). The programmatic approach will be \nimplemented from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2021, with subprogram 1 to be disbursed in \none tranche. Based on ADB\u2019s assessment of documents received, all subprogram 1 policy actions \nhave been completed, including with respect to policy actions 1 and 2 which are a subset of the \nEFF structural benchmarks and SPBL policy actions. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will \nbe  withdrawn following  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook (2017,  as amended from time to \ntime). The loan closing date for subprogram 1 is 30 June 2020. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n31 The IMF program includes general budget support financing plans of the government, including this programmatic \napproach and lending programs of all other development partners for 2019\u20132025. The Fiscal Responsibility and Debt \nLimitation Act 2005 of Pakistan (amended in 2016) allows the government to borrow above the 60% of GDP public \ndebt ceiling by providing the justification for additional borrowing in the annual debt policy statement. \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nGovernance \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n \nA. \n \nADB\u2019s  governance  risk  assessment  found  such  risks  as  (i)  weak  political  support  for  and \n32. \ngovernment  ownership  of  sensitive  reforms  and  (ii)  weak  institutional  capacity. 32  The  fiduciary \nsystems  assessment  found  one  important  area  of  concern:  key  reforms  may  not  be implemented \npromptly  because  of  budget  constraints.  While  no  major  resource  mismanagement  risks  at  the \nimplementing level could be discerned, areas relating to the sector\u2019s institutional capacity and financial \nsustainability  were  targeted  for  capacity  development in  the  TA  projects  and  the  program\u2019s  policy \nactions. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with \nthe government and will be followed by the program. Pakistan is on the Financial Action Task Force \ngray  list  and  will  continue  to  implement  the  anti-money-laundering  and  counterterrorism  reforms \nagreed  in  the  action  plan  with  the  task  force.  The  government  is  acting  against  corruption,  with \nmonitoring and reporting by the Public Accounts Committee of the parliament. \n \nB. \n \n33.  While the consumption poverty rate in Pakistan declined from 50.4% in FY2006 to 24.3% \nin FY2016,33 the multidimensional poverty rate remains high at 38.8% and has stark regional and \nurban\u2013rural  disparities:  54.6%  in  rural  areas  and  9.4%  in  urban  areas.34 Higher  energy  prices \ncoupled  with  subdued  growth  and  increased  inflation  and  unemployment  exacerbate  the \nvulnerabilities of the poor.35 Industrial and commercial sectors are affected by higher tariffs and \nunreliable  power  supply,  and  the  hardest  hit  are  the  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  that \nemploy more than 70% of workforce. Policy reforms will reduce generation costs by promoting \nlow-carbon  solutions,  and  lower  technical  and  commercial  losses.  Encouraging  private  sector \nparticipation  in  sustained  and  reliable  oil  and  gas  production  investments  will  increase  job \nopportunities  in  the  energy  sector  directly  and  indirectly.  Further,  expanded  energy  access  by \ndeveloping a 5-year rural and off-grid electrification plan for underdeveloped districts to reduce \ntime poverty of rural women\u2014who comprise more than 50% of the workforce\u2014will allow longer \nhours for study and skills training programs and generally improved health and quality of life. \n \nPakistan\u2019s female labor force participation rate is among the lowest globally: only 24.6% \n34. \nof women have access to formal labor markets.36 Women\u2019s lack of access to formal labor markets, \nlow  literacy  levels,  limited  mobility,  and  lack  of  land  ownership  and  assets  make  them  more \nvulnerable  to  economic  shocks.  Categorized  as  having  some  gender  elements,  subprogram  1 \nhas two key policy actions with strong gender impacts: the MOE has (i) completed consultations \nand submitted the National Electricity Policy for approval by provinces, with measures to improve \nfemale employment in the sector; and (ii) implemented the policy that requires at least one female \nboard member in public sector enterprises, including DISCOs. \n \nC. \n \n35. \nSubprogram 1 is classified category C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous peoples.
