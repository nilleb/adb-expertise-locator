More  than  75%  of  the \npopulation of 102,000 lives on Tongatapu. Tonga has the second highest risk globally of natural \ndisaster based on exposure, susceptibility, coping capacity, and adaptive capacity.3 From 1991 \nto 2010, the global climate risk index ranked Tonga 19th of 179 countries in terms of observed \naverage  annual  losses  as  a  percentage  of  gross  domestic  product  due  to  climate-related \ndisasters  and  in  terms  of  average  climate-related  deaths  per  100,000  people.4 In  the  last  ten \nyears  Tonga  experienced  higher  variability  of  rainfall  causing  localized  flooding,  and  droughts \nrelated  to  El  Ni\u00f1o  events.  Increased  ocean  temperatures  have  caused  coral  bleaching  and \ndestruction  of  habitats  for  reef  species.  Sea  level  rise,  estimated  at  6  millimeters  per  year,  is \ncontributing  to  coastal  erosion  and  subsequent  damage  to  infrastructure  and  property. 5 Coral \nbleaching destroys natural coastal barriers and together with the increase in sea level rise puts \ncoastal  community  livelihoods  and  infrastructure  at  risk.  The  culmination  of  these  impacts \nacross  sectors  has  increased  exposure  to  climate-induced  natural  disasters  such  as  tropical \ncyclones  and  storm  surges.  These  have  caused  significant  economic  losses  to  Tonga\u2019s \neconomy (e.g., tropical cyclone Waka in 2002 inflicted losses of $60 million6 and Rene in 2010 \n$22 million7). Substantive investment is required to help adapt to and manage these effects.  \n \n4. \nTonga\u2019s  national  strategic framework  and  institutional  coordination mechanism  address \nclimate  change  adaptation  (CCA)  and  disaster  risk  management  (DRM).  The  Tonga  Strategic \nDevelopment  Framework,  2011\u20132014  articulates  the  government\u2019s  development  aims  and \nprogram,  which  target  infrastructure  development  up  to  2020  with  an  explicit  focus  on \nintegrating  environmental  sustainability  and  climate  change  into  all  program  planning  and \n\n                                                \n1   Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience. \n2   The  PPCR  pilots  and  demonstrates  the  mainstreaming  of  climate  resilience  in  development  planning  and \nmanagement.

The  two  ministries  are  at  the  forefront  of  development  and \nimplementation  of  key  CCA  and  DRM  initiatives,  and  are  important  members  of  the  JNAP \nTechnical  Working  Group,  a  new  sector  coordinating  body  drawing  expertise  from  across \nministries responsible for CCA and DRM.11 These national initiatives are supported by ongoing \ndevelopment partner-supported climate resilience projects focusing on risk assessment studies, \nsector  policy  recommendations,  community-based  disaster  risk  and  adaptation  assessments, \nbiodiversity studies, and conservation.12 \n\n5. \nThe  crosscutting  nature  of  CCA  work  in  small  island  states  like  Tonga  implies  the \npossibility  of  the  involvement  of  many  development  partners.13 The  current  institutional  and \ncoordination  framework  is  to  avoid  duplication  and  consolidate  development  partner  efforts. \nWhile government commitment is strong and Tonga has a national strategy to address climate \nand  related  disaster  risk  challenges,  efforts  have  been  limited  by  severe  resource  constraints. \nDuring PPCR design, the government and other stakeholders identified impediments to a more \neffective response: (i) limited pool of qualified and trained experts to mainstream CCA; (ii) lack \nof  information,  tools,  and  legislative  frameworks  to  develop  and  implement  adaptation \nstrategies;  and  (iii)  challenges  in  accessing  adequate  climate  change  financing  for  priority \nadaptation needs. The NIIP identifies similar gaps including limited data on the effects of climate \nchange,  limited  experience  implementing  national  CCA  and  disaster  risk  reduction  (DRR) \nprojects, and limited resources to integrate CCA and DRR into development investments.14 The \nproject will address these constraints and develop institutional capacity to identify, design, and \nimplement climate adaptation practices. It will finance a range of least-cost, locally appropriate \nsolutions  for  climate  resilience.  The  project  features  strongly  in  engaging  civil  society  and \ncommunities  in  identifying  and  implementing  climate  resilient  investments.  It  will  focus  on \ngenerating  valuable  experience  and  lessons  for  knowledge  sharing  in  Tonga  and  by  other \nPacific island countries as they introduce and expand CCA and DRR investment programs. \n \nADB  sector  assistance  program.

ADB\u2019s  current  programming  under  the \nIntegrated  Urban  Development  Sector  Project, 17  Nuku\u2019alofa  Urban  Development  Sector \nProject,18 and technical assistance for implementing strategic economic management,19 provide \nADB with a clear understanding of the challenges Tonga faces in mainstreaming climate change \nconsiderations into government operations. This includes the need for increased technical and \nmanagement  capacity  of  line  agencies,  coordination  and  full  government  involvement, \ndevelopment  partner  coordination,  and  careful  consideration  of  recurrent  costs  for  the \nsustainability  of  investments.  A  sector  financing  modality  is  proposed  to  support  the  relevant \ninstitutions  in  Tonga  in  selecting,  appraising,  and  implementing  subprojects  for  ecosystem \nresilience  and  environment-sensitive  investments  to  climate-proof  infrastructure  that  will \ncontinue  beyond  the  pilot  phase.20 The  JNAP  policies  for  developing  Tonga\u2019s  CCA  and  DRM \ninitiatives are appropriate and supported by infrastructure investment priorities articulated in the \nNIIP. JNAP policies are not yet reflected in existing legislation, which needs to be reviewed and \namended,  particularly  in  relation  to  building  codes  and  natural  resource  management.  The \nJNAP  Secretariat  and  its  Technical  Working  Group  provide  the  institutional  framework  for \ncoordination  and  implementation;  yet  effective  coordination  and  monitoring  is  hindered  by  the \nlack  of  reliable  data  and  weak  national  capacity  to  collect  and  analyze  information  (to  be \naddressed  by  project  outputs  1  and  2).  Through  the  project,  the  government  is  anticipated  to \nlegally establish and operationalize a sustainable financing mechanism to provide communities \nand  nongovernment  organizations  with  access  to  small  grants  to  implement  CCA  and  climate \nDRR projects. The financing mechanism is a first for Tonga and the region, and the project will \nassist in putting in place appropriate, accountable, and transparent fiduciary arrangements. \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\nB. \n\n7. \nThe  project  impact  will  be  increased  resilience  of  vulnerable  communities  to  climate \nvariability  and  change,  and  disaster  risk.  The  outcome  will  be  strengthened  capacity  of \ngovernment  and  communities  to  develop,  finance,  implement,  and  monitor  investments  to \nimprove ecosystem resilience and climate-proof critical infrastructure.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs  \n\n1.  \n\nOutput  1:  Climate  Resilience  Mainstreamed  into  Development  Planning  of \nVulnerable Sectors \n\n8. \nUpgrade  climate  resilience  skills.  The  project  will  (i)  provide  20  Tongan  government \nstaff working in areas related to climate resilience with access to short-term professional training \nor work placements on CCA and DRM; (ii) provide up to 20 scholarships for Tongan citizens to \nundertake academic degrees on CCA and DRM subjects at the University of the South Pacific; \nand  (iii)  deliver  about  35  short  courses  to  Tongan  government  staff  and  private  sector  and \nnongovernment  organizations  on  CCA  of  infrastructure,  climate  change  finance  and  corporate \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \n16  ADB. 2013.

The  project  will  \n15. \n(i) identify potential mangrove planting sites to provide shoreline protection, and (ii) develop best \npractice  guidelines  and  support  field  demonstrations  on  the  use  of  mangroves  as  natural \ninfrastructure  in  areas  identified  for  investment.  The  field  demonstrations  will  raise  community \nawareness,  and  include  training  on  mangrove  planning  and  provision  of  mangrove  seedlings. \nApproximately 126 hectares of mangroves will be rehabilitated. \n\n \n16. \nUpgrade  evacuation  and  postdisaster  access  roads. The project will upgrade  three \nroads  to  improve  evacuation  and  postdisaster  access  in  Navutoka  (2.25  kilometers  [km])  of \nupgraded roads), Talafo\u2019ou (2.1 km), and Tufu (0.85 km).  \n \n17. \nEnhance  coastal  protection. The project will build and monitor coastline protection for \nfive  sections  of  coastline  in  eastern  Tongatapu  using  different  hard  and  soft  engineering  and \nbioengineering techniques24 to (i) control coastline erosion, (ii) reduce the impact of flood surges \nin coastal communities, and (iii) identify best practices for coastline protection for replication.25 \n \nUpgrade  schools.  The  project  will  upgrade  five  schools  by  improving  roofing,  and \n18. \nbuilding structures, road access, and drainage to reduce the number of school days lost during \ncyclone  season;  and  adapt  the  schools  to  withstand  other  effects  of  climate  change  such  as \ndrought.26 \n\n \n\n                                                \n22  Initially, the project will finance the operational account, plus any interest and capital gains earned on funds placed \nin  the  endowment  account  and  any  money  raised  through  other  sources  for  the  specific  purpose  of  providing \nclimate funding by the government. \n\n23 The procurement plan (in the Project Administration Manual) provides for the total value of community projects to \nbe $700,000. The CCTF operational manual will ensure that government-led medium size projects do not \u201ccrowd \nout\u201d community projects. \n\n24 Such as coral rock revetment, rock gavion construction, groyne placement, and mangrove rehabilitation. \n25  Total length of the sections is 2.7 km of a total length of about 6.2 km of coastline. \n26  Kolofo\u2019ou, Kolomotua, Tofoa, and Neiafu schools have been selected because of frequent closure due to effects of \ncyclones; Pangai school was selected because of limited access to potable water and its role as emergency shelter \nfor Hapa\u2019ai. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nCandidate  subprojects \n\nimplemented.  Due  diligence \n\nidentified \n19. \nsubprojects,  which  will  then  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval.  The  subprojects  include  (i) \nrelocating  Ha\u2019apai  Hospital  from  a  vulnerable  area  to  higher  ground,  (ii)  climate-proofing \nadditional  schools  in  outer  islands,  (iii)  constructing  an  evacuation  road  in  Popua,  Tongatapu, \nand  (iv)  climate  proofing  marine  landings  in  outer  islands  to  protect  infrastructure  vital  to  the \nlivelihoods and to ensure access to the islands after a climate change-related disaster.  \n \n\nis  needed \n\nfor \n\n5. \n\nOutput 5: Project Successfully Managed and Implemented   \n\n20. \nThe  project  consulting  services  will  provide  (i)  implementation  support  to  the  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  and  three  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  to  effectively  manage \nand  coordinate  the  project;  (ii)  monitoring,  reporting,  and  evaluation  support  to  the  PMU  and \nPIUs;  (iii)  operational  support  to  the  project  steering  committee,  the  JNAP  Technical  Working \nGroup and CCTF board; and (iv) knowledge management support to the PMU and PIUs. \n \nD. \n \n21. \ncalculated at $1.43 million. \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $23.13  million  (Table  1),  including  taxes  and  duties \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA.    \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nB.  \n\nBase Costb \n1.  \n2.  \n3.  \n4.  \n  \n5. \n\nClimate resilience mainstreamed in planning \nMonitoring of climate data and information improved \nClimate change trust fund established \nEcosystem resilience and climate-resilient investments  \ndeveloped \nProject management \n\n \n\n  Subtotal (A) \n\nContingenciesc \n \n \n\n \n\nTotal (A+B) \n\nAmounta \n\n  \n\n2.69 \n2.29 \n5.37 \n9.34 \n\n2.02 \n21.71 \n  1.42 \n23.13 \n\na  In mid-2013 prices. \nb  Includes taxes and duties of $1.43 million to be financed from government resources through exemption. \nc  Physical  contingencies  computed  at  15%  for  civil  works,  price  contingencies  computed  at  5.7%  on  foreign \nexchange costs and 11% on local currency costs.

MFNP  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  MLECCNR  the  coordinating  implementing \nagency  (Table  3).  A  PMU  will  be  established  under  MLECCNR,  with  the  head  of  the  Climate \nChange  Division  as  project  director,  to  assist  in  coordinating  and  overseeing  project \nimplementation. To mainstream  CCA  and  DRM  into  line  ministries  and  ensure  implementation \ncapacity, MLECCNR, MOI, MAFFF and Ministry of Education and Training will be implementing \nagencies for those activities relevant to their mandates. PIUs will be established in MOI, MAFF, \nand  environment  and  natural  resources  divisions  of  MLECCNR.  A  project  steering  committee \ncomprising the executive of these ministries, a representative from Ministry of Internal Affairs27 \nand  a  representative  of  the  Civil  Society  Forum  of  Tonga  will  provide  policy  guidance.

Initial subproject selection was based \non the JNAP and the NIIP with extensive stakeholder participation. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Analysis  \n\n25. \nThe  project  is  based  on  a  set  of  principles  including  degree  of  vulnerability,  cost \neffectiveness,  and  locally  appropriate  solutions.  While  many  project  benefits  are  not  easily \nquantified, the economic analysis endeavors to identify them for the purpose of benefit and cost \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  during  implementation.  An  economic  analysis  of  three  proposed \nsubprojects  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines. 29  All  economic  costs  and \nbenefits  are  expressed  at  constant  2013  prices.  The  net  present  value  (NPV)  of  the  three \nsubprojects as a whole is estimated at $(0.106) million with an overall economic internal rate of \nreturn  (EIRR)  of  11.7%  and  a  benefit\u2013cost  ratio  of  0.98.30 The  analysis  includes  only  benefits \nthat are quantifiable given the available information31 and as a result it likely underestimates the \ntrue economic benefits of each subproject.  For purpose of the economic analysis, no estimate \nof economic benefits was imputed to the early warning system investments under output two as \nit  was  not  possible  to  provide  reliable  estimates  of  avoided  casualties  (injuries  and  fatalities) \nwhich may result from this system. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n26. \nThe  2010  Public  Expenditure  and  Accountability  Report  concluded  that  the  Tongan \npublic  finance  management  system  is  well  developed,  and  that  the  legal  and  regulatory \nframework for  public finance management  provides  a  solid basis for  budgeting,  spending,  and \naccountability.32 The Government  of  Australia's  assessment  of  national  systems  identified  only \nmoderate fiduciary  and corruption  risk  associated with using  partner government  systems  and \nrecommended  their  use  in  aid  programming. 33  ADB\u2019s  policy  and  institutional  assessment \nindicates  that  Tonga  is  performing  better  than  the  regional  average  under  the  criteria  for \n\u201ceconomic management\u201d and \u201cpublic sector management and institutions,\u201d and better than most \nother  Asian  Development  Fund  Pacific 34  countries  for  \u201cquality  of  budgetary  and  financial \nmanagement.\u201d  Weaknesses  in  areas  related  to  budget  credibility,  external  scrutiny  and  audit, \nand  quality  and  timeliness  of  annual  financial  statements  are  addressed  through  the \ngovernment's  public  financial  management  reform  road  map,  supported  by  ADB  technical \nassistance (footnote 19). Development partners including ADB and the World Bank have been \nproviding  general  and  sector  budget  support  since  2010.  These  factors  all  bode  well  for  the \ngovernment's capacity to establish and prudently manage the CCTF. Overall governance risks \nassociated with project management, including procurement and disbursement, will be mitigated \nby  (i)  providing  consultants to  advise and assist in procuring goods  and services,  (ii)  requiring \ncivil  works  contracts  to  include  a  condition  for  contractors  to  adhere  to  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \n\n                                                \n29 ADB. 1993.

Approximately 2,900 households will \nbe directly impacted by the project and nationwide benefits will accrue from increased capacity \nto monitor climate change, provision of early warning monitoring systems, access to finance by \ncommunities, and development of national databases and knowledge management systems. All \nactivities will promote the inclusion of poor and vulnerable groups through the implementation of \na participation and communication strategy and consultation plan. The project is categorized as \neffective  gender  mainstreaming.  A  gender  action  plan  was  prepared  to  support  gender-equal \nparticipation in decision making for climate change-related resource allocation and community-\nbased project designs. A focal point on gender and development will be established in the PMU. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \nEnvironment. The project is classified as category B for environment. An environmental \nassessment and review framework and initial environmental examinations for core subprojects \nwere  prepared  and disclosed. 35 The  initial  environmental  examinations found  that the  planned \nsubprojects will have only small and localized adverse impacts on the environment, which can \nbe  readily  managed  by  proposed  mitigation  measures  in  the  environmental  assessment  and \nreview  framework  and  initial  environmental  examinations.  The  PMU  includes  a  full-time \nenvironment  specialist  to  oversee  framework  implementation  and  be  supported  by  the \ninternational specialist.36   \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  involuntary \n29. \nresettlement.  Screening  during  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  confirmed  that  core \nsubprojects  under  output  4  do  not  require  involuntary  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The \ngovernment is expected to allocate crown or state land for candidate subprojects prior to project \nimplementation. If any candidate subproject has unanticipated land acquisition and resettlement \nimpacts during implementation, a resettlement plan will be prepared following the resettlement \nframework which was prepared for the project to address unanticipated impacts and disclosed \nto the public (footnote 35).  \n \n30. \nIndigenous peoples. The project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples. It is \nnot expected to impact any distinct or vulnerable group of indigenous peoples as defined under \nthe  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  project  beneficiaries  are  part  of  mainstream \nPolynesian  society  and  are  not  discriminated  upon  due  to  their  language,  skin  color,  or \ntraditional practices.  \n \n\n                                                \n35 The  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Framework  and  the  Resettlement  Framework  were  disclosed  on \nSeptember 2013 in MFNP and ADB web page and are accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n36 The  international  specialist  in  the  design  and  supervision  consultancy  team  is  expected  to  be  engaged  for  41 \n\nperson-months and will provide training to national specialists, PMU and PIU staff, and contractors. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n \n31. \nThe  project  involves  some  risks,  which  are  manageable  and  will  be  largely  mitigated \nduring implementation (Table 4). 37 The benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nImplementation delays \n\nThe CCTF is not \nmanaged consistent with \nfiduciary responsibilities \n\nThe PMU housed in MLECCNR will oversee overall project implementation. Any \npotential delays are to be reported in a timely manner with recommended remedial \nactions. The PMU reports directly to the project director in MLECCNR and each PIU \nwill appoint a senior staff member to be responsible for project management. \nCCTF is managed by MFNP, whose financial management and procurement \ncapacities ADB is supporting. CCTF accounts will be audited and posted, with other \nCCTF information on the project web page to increase transparency and stakeholder \nparticipation.
