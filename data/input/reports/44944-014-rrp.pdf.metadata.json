ING\u2019s objective was to structure \nthe most commercially attractive deal for commercial launch by reaching a negotiated term sheet \nwith  ADB  and  finalizing  the  technical,  commercial,  and  environmental  and  social  due  diligence \npackages  based  on  ADB\u2019s  participation  in  project  appraisal.  Given  the  extensive  Korean \nsponsorship  and  technical  content,  the  Export-Import  Bank  of  Korea  and  the  Korea  Trade \nInsurance  Corporation  have  also  played  key  roles  in  the  term  sheet  negotiations  and  due \ndiligence. Following completion of due diligence and finalizing the term sheet in September 2011, \nING  successfully  launched  the  transaction  to  emerging-market-focused  project  finance  banks, \nsegregated into tranches covered by ADB\u2019s PRG and the untied financing schemes of the Export-\nImport Bank of Korea and the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation. \n \n3. \nThere has been strong support of partners from the Republic of Korea in the development \nof  Uzbek  natural  resources.  In  2005\u20132006,  the  presidents  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  and \nUzbekistan reached a strategic cooperation agreement, which lays the groundwork for a number \nof Uzbek\u2013Korean partnerships in the Uzbek gas and chemical industries. These include the Surgil \nproject\u2014a joint venture between the state-owned oil and gas company National Holding Company \n\u201cUzbekneftegaz\u201d  (UNG)  and  a  Korean  consortium  (Kor-Uz  Gas  Chemical  Investment  Ltd)\u2014to \ndevelop the Surgil\u2013North Aral gas and condensate field and a gas-to-chemical process plant. The \nproject  also  benefits  from  a  pioneering  Investment  Agreement  (IA)  between  the  Government  of \nthe  Republic  of  Uzbekistan,  Kor-Uz  Gas  Chemical  Investment  Ltd,  Uz-Kor  Gas  Chemical  and \nUNG,  which  enables  the  project  to  borrow  on  international  project  finance  terms  and  conduct \nbusiness according to global commercial standards. \n \n4. \nAs the second-largest gas producer in the Commonwealth of Independent States behind \nthe  Russian  Federation,  with  total  reserves  of  59.4  trillion  cubic  feet,2 Uzbekistan  is  also  well-\npositioned  with  its  low-cost  feedstock  supply  to  establish  a  strong  chemical  industry.  Despite \nthis  potential  and  the  rate  of  growth  of  the  commodity  petrochemical  market  in  the  region, \nUzbekistan has made only a limited foray into the market.3 \n \nThe project will be the largest oil and gas project undertaken in Uzbekistan and one of \n5. \nthe  largest  multisource  financing  schemes  in  Central  Asia  to  date.  The  project  will  provide \nsubstantial  benefits  to  Uzbekistan  by  enhancing  its  established gas  extraction  and  processing \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  British Petroleum. 2010. Statistical Review of World Energy 2010. London. \n3  UNG  currently  operates  a  small-capacity  polyethylene  manufacturing  plant,  which,  when  the  Surgil  project  is \n\ncomplete, will be switched to a different polyethylene product for use in the domestic market. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nindustry  with  the  capability  to  convert  a  portion  of  the  gas  into  higher-value  chemical \ncommodities  to  be  sold  into  high-demand  manufacturing  in  the  region.  ADB\u2019s  participation, \nparticularly through leading the due diligence as a direct lender, ensures that the project delivers \non  environmental  performance\u2014a  key  stakeholder  concern  in  all  chemical  industry  projects. \nADB,  through  its  commercial  cofinancing  products,  can  also  help  mobilize  significant  foreign \ndirect  investment  in  Uzbekistan\u2019s  private  sector  and  eventually  ease  the  burden  on  the \nGovernment of Uzbekistan in taking sponsor roles in industrial projects. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\nThe project is located approximately 1,300 kilometers (km) from Tashkent in the Ustyurt \n\n6. \nregion of Karakalpakstan in northwestern Uzbekistan. \n \n7. \n\nThe integrated gas-to-chemical project consists of \n(i) \n\nupstream  development  and  operations  at  the  Surgil  Field  involving  drilling  new \nproduction  wells  and  constructing  upstream  infrastructure  including  expanding \nthe complex gas treatment unit to supply up to 3 billion cubic meters per annum \n(BCMA) of gas and 115 thousand tons per annum (KTPA) of condensate;4 \ndownstream  development  and  operations  at  the  gas  processing  site,  located \napproximately 115 km southwest of the Surgil Field, involving constructing a new \ngas  separation  plant,  an  ethylene  cracker,5 a  high-density  polyethylene  plant,  a \npolypropylene plant, and associated utilities and supporting facilities; and \nassociated gas pipelines, product transportation, and water supply infrastructure; \nthe project also includes three 35-megawatt gas turbine generator sets for power \nsupply independent of the national grid. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n8. \nThe project will source gas from its own Surgil Field and will also purchase gas, through \na gas supply agreement with UNG.  Condensate supply (another raw material required for the \npolymer process) is sourced from the Surgil field and through supply contracts with UNG. \n \n9. \nThe  upstream  and  downstream  components  of  the  project  will  be  connected  by  two \nparallel 115-km pipelines constructed to supply gas and condensate from the Surgil Field to the \ngas  separation  plant.  The  process  technology  will  be  supplied  by  each  of  the  downstream \nengineering,  procurement,  and  construction  (EPC)  contracts  and  will  be  fully  aligned  with \ntechnology  license  arrangements,  providing  the  project  with  process  performance  guarantees \nand ongoing technical support from the process licensors.  \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower and/or Sponsor \n\n10. \nUz-Kor Gas Chemical is a joint-venture company which is 50% owned by Uzbekistan\u2019s \nstate-controlled  UNG  and  50%  by  a  consortium  of  Korean  companies:  Honam  Petrochemical \nCorporation  (45%  of  the  Korean  consortium),  Korea  Gas  Corporation  (45%),  and  STX  Energy \n(10%).  Uz-Kor  Gas  Chemical  was  incorporated  in  Uzbekistan  in  May  2008  as  a  project \ncompany  to  build,  own,  and  operate  the  project.  The  companies  comprising  the  Korean \nconsortium were chosen on a selective basis from companies within the Republic of Korea with \nrelevant  commercial  experience  to  implement  the  project.  UNG  was  founded  in  1992  as  the \n                                                \n4   Condensate  is  a  mixture  of  hydrocarbon  liquids  present  in  the  gaseous  state  as  natural  gas  is  produced.  It  is \n\ncomposed of C5 and heavier hydrocarbons. \n\n5   Cracking  is  a  high-temperature  process  that  splits  ethane  and  propane  (paraffins)  carbon-hydrogen  bonds  into \ndouble-bonded  ethylene  and  propylene  (olefins)  and  aromatics.  Olefins  are  highly  reactive  and  are  suitable  for \nprocessing into higher-value chemical derivatives. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n \n\nwholly state-owned holding company of Uzbekistan\u2019s oil and gas industry. UNG is the second-\nlargest natural gas producer in the Commonwealth of Independent States, after Gazprom. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n11. \nThe project adds incremental economic value to the output of three natural-gas fields by \nprocessing  an  extracted  commodity  to  two  value-added  streams:  purified  methane  for \ncommercial use, and key chemical intermediate polymer products for downstream plastics and \ntextiles manufacturing. The exported chemicals increase the proportion of value-added products \nin Uzbekistan\u2019s total exports, which increases Uzbekistan's economic share in the resource. The \ndemonstration  effect  of  a  large-scale  project,  with  application  of  the  Investment  Agreement, \nincreases  the  opportunities  for  further  foreign  direct  investment  in  Uzbekistan\u2019s  private  sector \nlarge-scale manufacturing industry. This impact will have been largely facilitated by ADB\u2019s early \ninvolvement in structuring the due diligence of the project and in enhancing the attractiveness of \nthe project to commercial financing sources. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\nThe  project's  outcome  is  a  significant  expansion  in  the  value-added  chemical  process \n12. \nindustry  in  Uzbekistan  and  the  increase  in  value  of  a key  natural  resource.  As  a result,  3,373 \nKTPA of natural gas will be processed into 387 KTPA of high-density polyethylene, 83 KTPA of \npolypropylene,  and  2,568  KTPA  of  methane-rich  processed  gas  (footnote  1).  The  project  will \nboost long-term employment by adding approximately 3,500 direct jobs during construction and \n1,090  during  operations,  in  addition  to  indirect  employment  opportunities.  This  outcome  is \nsignificant as the Karakalpakstan region of Uzbekistan is characterized by high unemployment \nand  poverty  and  the  project  will  directly  address  this  through  hiring  programs  that  will  recruit \ndirectly from the Karakalpakstan community. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  project's  output  is  a  facility  constructed  and  commissioned  as  envisaged  in  the \n13. \nproject  documents  and  in  compliance  with  ADB  environmental  and  social  safeguards.  The \noutput is readily verifiable by performance demonstration required under the EPC contracts and \ntechnology licenses and the measurement of EPC contract milestones. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\nADB's  Strategy  2020 6 emphasizes  ADB\u2019s  support  for  efficient  energy  infrastructure, \n14. \nimproving regional cooperation and intraregional supply chains, forging stronger financial links \nwith Asian countries, and bridging the technology gap. The project supports these objectives by \ndeveloping gas fields where the outputs will be separated into fuel and higher-value chemical \ncommodity  products.  The  project\u2014and  its  focus  on  export  to  regional  demand  centers  in \nCentral Asia, the Russian Federation, and Turkey\u2014will demonstrate Uzbekistan\u2019s commitment \n\n                                                \n6  ADB.  2008.

The ADB \nloan will have a maximum tenor of up to 13 years, including a grace period of up to 5.5 years, \nand will be repaid semiannually.  \n \n19. \nThe proposed PRG of up to $275 million of principal, interest and fees will cover certain \nrisks under loans from commercial lenders to Uz-Kor Gas Chemical to finance the project. The \nPRG will have a tenor of up to 13 years and match the original tenor of the commercial loans \ncovered by the PRG. Under the PRG, ADB will cover the risks of currency inconvertibility, non-\ntransferability  of  funds,  war,  terrorism  and  political  violence,  and  breach  of  contract  (for  which \nthere  must  be  default  on  an  arbitral  award  or  denial  of  recourse)  in  respect  of  the  loans  of \ncommercial lenders. The guaranteed lenders must be eligible beneficiaries under ADB's policy \nrelated to credit enhancement.  \n    \nB. \n\nValue-Added by ADB Assistance \n\n20. \nADB is a cornerstone lender to the project and has played a key role in the successful \ncommercial  syndication.  Petrochemical-focused  commercial  banks  may  take  up  to  the  full \namount  of  the  $275  million  PRG-covered  tranche,  introducing  a  level  of  financial  and \ncommercial  value  to  the  project  that  may  otherwise  have  been  unavailable  to  a  large-scale \nfinancing scheme  in  Central  Asia.  Beyond  the  project,  ADB\u2019s  role in this  pioneering financing \nshould have a legacy effect on future foreign direct investment in Uzbekistan\u2019s private sector. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n \n21. \nADB\u2019s  participation  assures  that  environmental  and social  mitigation  and enhancement \nmeasures  will  be  implemented  effectively.  By  following  ADB\u2019s  safeguards  and  social  policies \n(including the  application of World\u2019s  Bank Group environmental,  health,  and safety guidelines) \nwill  demonstrate  the  application  of  international  environmental  and  social  standards  and  best \npractices  to  Uzbekistan\u2019s  manufacturing  sector  and  will  raise  performance  standards  in \noccupational  health  and  safety,  emissions  and  effluent  control  and  measurement,  emergency \nresponse techniques, and community engagement. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\n22. \nThe deal team assessed the following key risk issues during due diligence. Independent \nadvisors have indicated that risks are mitigated to the extent of, and in some cases in excess of, \nindustry best practice. \n \n\nEngineering,  procurement,  and  construction  risk.  Construction  risk  is  mitigated \nby the presence of strong EPC contracts with leading EPC firms.  The sponsors are \nalso providing strong execution support.  \n \nMarket/Offtake  risks.  The  project  is  competitive  with  other  marketers  of  polymers \nbecause of its unique advantage of captive gas supply as a raw material instead of \npurchasing ethylene raw material on the commodities market.  \n\nGas  supply  risk.  Gas  reserves  from  the  Surgil  field  and  UNG  national  supply  are \nconsidered adequate for the project throughout the tenors of the project\u2019s loans.    \n\nLegal and regulatory risk.  The transaction is exposed to legal and regulatory risk, \nwhich  is  perceived  to  be  high  in  Uzbekistan.  Foreign  investment  in  Uzbekistan  is \nrelatively new (as is project financing) with few precedents.  \n \nExtractive  Industries  Transparency  Initiative.  Uzbekistan  has  not  implemented \nthe  Extractive  Industries  Transparency  Initiative  and  therefore  does  not  publish  a \nreport  detailing  revenues  from  extracted  resources  and  discrepancies  in  reported \nvolumes  and  revenues  from  extractive  companies.    The  project,  however,  falls \noutside of the scope of EITI as it does not sell natural resources (unprocessed gas) \nto the export markets. \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards.11 The project is classified as category A in terms of  environmental impacts \n23. \nand  triggers  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  requirements  on  environmental  assessment  and  planning  for \npollution prevention and abatement, biodiversity conservation, and occupational and community \nhealth  and  safety.  An  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment  was  carried  out  and  an \nenvironmental  and  social  management  plan  (ESMP)  has  been  prepared  in  line  with  national \nlaws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  including  International  Finance \nCorporation\u2019s  Environmental,  Health,  and  Safety  Guidelines.  There  are  no  habitats  with  high \n\n                                                \n11  Safeguards and Social Dimensions Summary, and Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible \n\nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\n \n\nbiodiversity value within the project area of influence. Sudoch\u2019ye Lake State Reserve is located \nupstream of the project by a distance of at least 50 km from the Surgil complex gas treatment \nunit  and  30 km from  the  Ustyurt gas  chemical  complex  and therefore the  project  will  not  have \ndirect impacts on this protected site.  \n \n24. \nPotential  indirect  impacts  during  construction  that  may  be  caused  by  the  influx  of \nconstruction workers will be avoided and  minimized through strict implementation of education \nprograms  and  hunting  bans.  Potential  health  impacts  and  pollution  will  be  minimized  and \nmitigated  through  proper  implementation  of  the  ESMP.  Uz-Kor,  as  a  recently  formed \norganization, is committed to sound environment and social management through setting up an \nenvironmental health safety and social management system, including a grievance mechanism, \nto be in place prior to the commencement of construction and operations. Uz-Kor has appointed \nan  environmental  and  social  manager  since  July  2011  at  the  head  office  in  Tashkent  to  be \nsupported  by  a  qualified  and  experienced  team  at  the  head  and  field  offices  to  oversee  the \nESMP  implementation  and  act  as  main  point  of  contact  with  the  EPC  contractor.  The  cost  of \nmitigation measures, monitoring and training activities has been estimated and included in the \nproject  budget.  Consultations  were  conducted  with  local  residents  and  district  government \nofficials  and  information  on  the  project,  ESMP  implementation,  availability  of  jobs,  local \nrecruitment  policy,  HIV/AIDS  awareness  program  was  disclosed  and  discussed  in  Akchalak, \nMuynak,  and  Kungrad  settlements  in  July  2010,  March  2011  and  July  2011.  Issues  and \nconcerns raised and responses made by Uz-Kor during the consultations were documented in \nthe  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment  which  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  in \nAugust 2011. Uz-Kor has appointed a community liaison officer who will be the local contact for \nenquiries and complaints.  \n \n25. \nThe project is classified as C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The \nproject will be constructed in the uninhabited bed of Aral Sea and state-owned semi-arid desert \nlands  in  the  Ustyurt  Plateau.  All  prior  land  allocations  did  not  entail  involuntary  resettlement \nimpacts  nor  affect  any  indigenous  peoples. The  population in the  project  area  is  comprised of \nKarakalpaks,  Uzbeks,  Kazakhs,  Russians,  Tatar,  Koreans,  Turkish,  and  others.  No  adverse \nproject  impacts  on  these  ethnic  groups  are  expected  and  none  of  these  ethnic  groups  are \nconsidered indigenous peoples under the criteria of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.    \n \n26. \nOther social dimensions. The project is expected to provide employment and business \nopportunities  to  the  local  community  and  income  (through  taxes)  to  the  local  governments.  \nWhere it is justified in respect of considerations of cost and quality, Uz-Kor and its contractors \nwill  adopt  a  quota  for  women  and  ensure  that  unskilled  labor  workforce  is  proportionally \ndistributed  based  on  ethnic  distribution  in  the  region/district.  Uz-Kor  and  its  contractors  will \ncomply  with  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy12 including  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards.    The  Project  will  also  address  key  issues  facing  local  women  by  providing \nemployment  and  business  opportunities  and  improving  local  infrastructure  which  will  improve \nthe living conditions of women in Akchalak settlement.     \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n27. \nUz-Kor  has  been  advised  of  standardized  approach  to  anticorruption  and  its  policy  of \nimplementing best international practice relating to the combating of money laundering and the \nfinancing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate \nanticorruption provisions and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance.  \n\n                                                \n12 ADB. 2001.
