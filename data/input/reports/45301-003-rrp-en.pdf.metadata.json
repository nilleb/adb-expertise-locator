Given the current project\u2019s good performance and achievements, the additional financing \nwill continue to strengthen PNPs and expand access to more efficient, and climate- and disaster-\nresilient WSS services for urban residents in small towns.  It will support the implementation of \nsubprojects in six new towns, in addition to those ongoing in nine towns.  \n \n4. \nWith the additional financing, the overall project will (i) expand access to high-quality and \nreliable piped water supply services for the urban population, (ii) strengthen the PNPs\u2019 capacity to \nmanage water supply systems in a resilient manner, and (iii) support government and community \nefforts to deliver urban WSS. The inclusion of women and poor people will remain a priority. The \ncurrent project\u2019s approach and structure will apply under the additional financing. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n5. \nSector  constraints  and  opportunities.  The  population  of  the  Lao  PDR  in  2017  is \nestimated at 6.69 million, of whom a third reside in five large urban centers and 150 small towns \nin  144  districts.  The  gross  domestic  product  was  estimated  at  $2,408  per  capita  in  2016  and \n$2,550  in  2017. 2 The  poverty  rate  declined  to  23.2%  in  2013  and  is  projected  to  fall  by  1 \npercentage point per annum.  \n \n6. \nWSS is a basic urban service which contributes to the economic growth of towns. Access \nto piped water supply is still low in the Lao PDR\u2014only 64% of urban residents  had it in 2015. \nHowever,  access  to  improved  sanitation  is  high,  covering  94%  of  the  population  in  2015. \nIncreasing  water  supply  coverage  and  quantity,  improving  its  quality,  and  ensuring  service \ncontinuity will help improve urban residents\u2019 health condition and accelerate poverty reduction.  \nFurther, the urban WSS systems in the Lao PDR are exposed to disaster and climate change \nrisks that may impact water reservoirs, treatment plant structures, and distribution networks. The \nurban WSS systems in the Lao PDR require careful  designing to incorporate resilient features \nbased on the principles of water safety planning.3 \n \n\n                                                \n1   ADB.  2013.

Water Safety Planning for Urban Water Utilities: Practical Guide for ADB \n\nStaff. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fThe  current  project.  The  current  project  supports  the  government\u2019s  urban  sector \n7. \ntargets\u201490% coverage for piped water supply and 100% coverage for sanitation by 2030\u2014and its \nexpected outcome is stronger performance of participating PNPs in delivering sustainable water \nsupply to 155,500 urban residents and sanitation services to 163,000 urban residents in 11 towns \nin six provinces. The project is being executed by the Department of Water Supply (DWS), which \nwas established in 2015 in the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT). \n \n8. \nImplementation progress. The current project started slowly due to the implementation \nassistance  consultant  late  recruitment  and  subsequent  delays  in  subprojects\u2019  design  and \nprocurement.  It  also  suffered  from  grant  funds  loss  as  Phu  Bia  Mining  Limited  withdrew  in \nDecember 2016; it did so primarily because of the project\u2019s slow start and because its ownership \nchanged and its priorities shifted to dealing with the mining global decline and price erosion.  \n \n9. \nAchievements to date. After the change in financing plan and project scope, the current \nproject\u2019s  implementation  significantly  accelerated.  It  is  rated  on  track,  with cumulative contract \nawards of $22.29 million equivalent (69% of the loan amount) and cumulative disbursement of \n$7.06  million  equivalent  (21%  of  the  loan  amount).  To  date,  the  following  results  have  been \nachieved: \n(i) \n\nInstitutional reform successfully yielded a new and dedicated DWS (also covering \nsanitation), reflecting the growing importance of the sector within the MPWT.4 In \naddition, corporate plans were developed for six subprojects by four PNPs, two of \nwhich have secured approval.  \nThe project (categorized as effective gender mainstreaming) greatly contributed to \nstrengthening  women\u2019s  roles  by  achieving  the  targets  for  the  number  of  female \nstaff in local government and project-related committees.  \nCommunity consultation meetings and workshops were delivered to 7,390 persons, \nof which 45% are women.  \nHaving a dedicated DWS also allowed the staff to focus on project administration \nand improve project performance.5 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n10. \nRationale for additional financing. Phu Bia Mining Limited\u2019s withdrawal resulted in a $6 \nmillion funding shortfall and reduced project benefits, accordingly. Having overcome the slow start \nand having strengthened the sector\u2019s oversight through the DWS, the government was keen to \nramp up its efforts and therefore requested additional financing of $30.50 million to expand WSS \ncoverage and improve PNPs\u2019 performance. Helped by an experienced DWS, project management \nstaff,  and  consultants, the government  is  fitted  to  using funds  successfully  to achieve  its  2030 \nWSS targets. With the additional financing, the current project will be almost doubled. Based on \nthe DWS performance for the last six months,6 the government is confident of implementing the \noverall project successfully.  \n \nStrategic  alignment.  The  current  project  is  on  track,  maintaining  both  a  satisfactory \n11. \nimplementation pace and compliance with ADB policies. It has shown compliance with its loan \ncovenants,  particularly  on  project  implementation,  contract  awards,  safeguards  reporting \nrequirements, updated WSS sector policies, and grievance redress mechanism, and has partially \n\n                                                \n4   Water supply and sanitation were previously the responsibility of the Department of Housing and Urban Planning. \n5   Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  The  EA\u2019s  performance  has  significantly  improved  in  terms  of  overseeing  design  and  procurement.  The  average \nnumber of days from advertisement to final bid evaluation report was 102 days for the bids invited in July\u2013November \n2016 while it was 64 days for the bids invited in October\u2013November 2017.  \n\n2 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\ncomplied  covenants  on  tariff  increases  and  gender.  It  has,  however,  not  complied  with  its \ncovenant on outstanding water bills because the actual institutional setup in the Lao PDR is more \ncomplicated than it was considered during project conceptualization and further work is required \non supporting the reform process. The project meets the eligibility criteria for additional financing, \nsuch  as  overall  development  objectives,  being  consistent  and  being  strategically  aligned  with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Lao PDR, 2017\u20132020, and is included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations  business  plan  for  Lao  PDR,  2018\u20132020. 7  The  additional  financing  modality  is \nappropriate because the current project is performing well and exhibits a high degree of project \nreadiness in design, implementation capacity, and safeguards. It will continue to contribute to the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to achieve its urban sector targets by 2030.   \n \n12. \nDevelopment coordination. Development coordination supports capacity development to \nachieve policy reforms. The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation supported corporate \nplans for those PNPs included in the Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. It \nsupported  5  years  of  capacity  development  technical  assistance  to  improve  PNPs  management \ncapabilities, on which the additional financing will build to deliver a comprehensive corporate plan. \n \n13. \nLessons learned. Lessons learned from the implementation of the current project include \nPNP\u2019s poor capacity on operation and maintenance (O&M) and budget management, poor water \nconservation practices, and lack of disaster risk awareness. To address these issues, the additional \nfinancing  will  (i)  provide  training  for  PNP  staff  on  O&M,  budget  preparation  and  execution, \naccounting, cash planning, and performance measurement; (ii) conduct awareness programs for \nvillage communities on water conservation to cope with urbanization and reduced dry season river \nflows  caused by  deforestation;  (iii)  use  robust  equipment  to  reduce  O&M;  and  (iv)  provide  easy \naccess to units within facilities for easy O&M. \n \n14. \nADB\u2019s value addition. ADB\u2019s value addition lies in supporting the government through a \nsector reform process by providing both lending and non-lending support and helping improve the \nPNPs\u2019  performance  in  the  delivery  of  urban  WSS  services.  Through  the  overall  project  and \nongoing activities under the Greater Mekong Subregion Corridor Towns Development projects, \nADB\u2019s support will allow the government to expand its sanitation mandate and help achieve its \n2030 WSS targets, and address improved health and hygiene conditions in urban areas. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n15. \nThe impact of the overall project remains unchanged: urban access to quality and reliable \npiped water supply and sanitation services in the Lao PDR improved. The outcome of the overall \nproject also remains unchanged: performance of the participating PNPs in delivering sustainable \nWSS improved. In terms of beneficiaries, the number of urban residents with access to safe piped \nwater  supply  will  increase  from  100,000  to  200,000  while  the  number  of  urban  residents  with \naccess to improved sanitation facilities will increase from 170,000 to 210,000. The overall project \nis expected to cover eight PNPs and improve WSS in 15 towns. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n16. \nOutput  1:  Sector  coordination  and  policy  implementation  improved.  Output  1  will \ncontinue the reforms introduced under previous projects and implement additional policy reforms, \n\n                                                \n7   ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fimproving the performance in six PNPs under the current project to eight PNPs under the overall \nproject. These activities entail (i) service agreements between PNPs and provincial governments; \nPNPs  training  on  corporate  planning  and  financial  management,  tariff  adjustments,  issuance  of \ndistrict  sanitation  regulations,  use  of  simplified  corporate  plans,  and  integration  of  disaster \npreparedness  measures  in  the  corporate  planning  process;  (ii)  expanded  policy  implementation, \nincluding  nationalizing  a  policy  for  sanitation  regulations  and  inclusive  connection  fees,  wider \ncoordination of nonrevenue water (NRW) management, asset management, and water safety plans; \nand (iii) capacity development, including safeguards training and the introduction of O&M service \ncontracts for participating PNPs (e.g., administration support, PNP leak-detection equipment) for \ntwo additional PNPs under the additional financing. \n \n17. \nOutput  2:  NRW  management  and  water  supply  development  improved.  Output  2  will \nintegrate a comprehensive program to reduce NRW in the existing system and expand water supply \nto areas not yet covered, lowering average NRW levels to 20%. The current project covers three \ntowns, and the additional financing will cover three towns thereby covering six towns in total. The \noverall  project  will  expand  water  supply  distribution  pipelines  to  250  kilometers  (km):  150  km \nunder the current project and 100 km under the additional financing. \n \n18. \nOutput 3: New water supply systems in small towns developed. PNPs participating in \noutputs 1 and 2 will be eligible for financing to build a new water system in a small district town in the \nsame province, acquire related O&M equipment, and offer free metered connections to households \n(HHs), provided they have sanitation facilities installed. Special attention will be paid to ensure that \nthe infrastructure is in the least-risk area and the proposed structures are built to withstand floods \nand geophysical hazards. The current project covers six towns, and the additional financing will \nadd three towns. The overall project will construct 150 km of new water distribution systems: 100 \nkm under the current project and 50 km under the additional financing. \n \n19. \nOutput 4: Community action in water supply and sanitation enhanced. It will widen the \nbenefits from investing in water supply systems to 15 small towns (nine towns under the current \nproject and six under the additional financing) through sanitation and awareness activities. These \ninvolve (i) VEI grants8, such as drainage improvements and village access roads for core villages \naccording  to  agreed  eligibility  criteria;  (ii)  HH  sanitation  grants  for  the  poor9 without  a  sanitary \nprivate  latrine  (construct  a  new  or  upgrade  existing)  to  improve  HH  sanitation;  (iii)  new  or \nrehabilitated public sanitation facilities, for which O&M can be contracted to a business or social \nentity, and septage disposal facilities where they are unavailable in the subproject area; and (iv) \nincreased  project  and  hygiene  awareness  through  stakeholder  consultations  and  community \nparticipation  aiming at  improved sanitation  and hygiene  behavior  change.  Access to  sanitation \nwill be expanded in participating towns, whereby beneficiaries finance their own units to become \neligible  for  water  supply  connections.  Output  4  will  also  strengthen  communities  capacity  to \nunderstand  the  factors  contributing  to  disaster  and  climate  risks  through  improvements  on \ncommunity-level infrastructure.10 The community engagement process will allow identifying and \n\n                                                \n8  The project will contribute up to 80% of the cost of improvements ($10\u2013$25 per capita), local governments at least 10%, \n\nand the village at least 10% in cash. Percentages exclude taxes and duties, which the government will finance. \n\n9   The poor households will be identified in accordance with the criteria set forth in the Prime Minister\u2019s Decree No. \n285, dated October 2009, or otherwise agreed to in advance with  ADB. Each eligible will receive materials for the \nconstruction  of  durable  water  seal pit  latrine  amounting  to  $140.  Construction  materials  will  be procured  through \nshopping and handed to the poor.   \n\n10  The  project  will  contribute  up  to  80%  of  the  cost  of  improvement  (from  $10  per  capita  to  $25  per  capita),  local \ngovernment at least 10%, and the village at least 10% in cash.

It  is  expected  that  contracts  amounting  to  50%  of  the  additional  financing \namount  will  be  awarded  by  end  Q1  2019.  The  market  assessment  of  construction  contractors \nindicates availability of a small pool of firms eligible to undertake WSS works. Consequently, bid \nevaluations  will  carefully  consider  bidders\u2019 personnel  and financial  capacity  to undertake  more \nworks of similar nature and size before awarding contracts.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\n25. \nLocation and design features of water treatment plant facilities will factor in disaster and \nclimate risk considerations and, where relevant to the lifespan of the infrastructure, future changes \nin  the  frequency  and/or  intensity  of  extreme  events  as  well  as  long-term  changes  in  average \ndisaster,  climate,  and  geophysical  risks.  These  designs  have  proven  to  be  robust,  durable, \ntechnically  viable,  and  disaster  risk  measures  were  well  received  by  the  PNPs.  Subproject \nselection  will  be  based  on  criteria  such  as  population  density,  poverty  incidence,  and  existing \nWSS coverage. Feasibility studies and DEDs for the sample subprojects in Sopbao and Xam-\nNua  towns,  which  are  representative  of  subprojects  under  the  additional  financing,  have  all \nfactored in lessons from the current project. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n26. \nEconomic analysis. It was conducted for two water-supply sample subprojects, Sopbao \nand  Xam-Nua,  following  ADB  guidelines.  Benefits  considered  are  (i)  resource  cost  savings \nassociated  with  the  replacement  of  non-incremental  water  consumed  and  previously  obtained \nfrom alternative sources; and (ii) consumer surplus, reflected in the incremental water consumed. \nThe  estimated  economic  internal rates  of return are  16.03% for  Sopbao and  18.63% for Xam-\nNua, higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital assumed at 9.00%, indicating significant \neconomic  returns.  Sensitivity  analysis  for  various  scenarios  revealed  that  the  proposed \ncomponents are most sensitive to a project delay and a decrease in subproject benefits but remain \nabove the economic opportunity cost of capital.12 \n \n27. \nFinancial analysis. It was assumed that the government would extend subloans to the \nHouaphan PNP for implementing the Sopbao and Xam-Nua subprojects (and all those considered \nfor additional financing) on the same terms as for the subprojects under the current project (i.e., \nof the total subproject cost, 70% will be granted and 30% will be on-lent at 6.40% per annum with \na 6-year grace period). The financial internal rate of return is 12.43% for Xam-Nua and 8.63% for \nSopbao,  exceeding  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  7.18%.  The  sensitivity  analysis \nindicates that the subprojects are most sensitive to a project delay and a decrease in revenues \nbut remain well above the weighted average cost of capital. The PNPs\u2019 sustainability depends \nheavily on the implementation of tariff revisions, and participating PNPs will conduct a tariff review \nevery  3  years  and  adjust  levels  to  meet  the  government\u2019s  cost-recovery  objectives  on \nsustainability as well as ADB\u2019s loan and grant covenants. \n \n\n                                                \n12 Economic Analysis (available from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n28. \nThe  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  moderate.  Project  fund  utilization  is  in \naccordance with the original expenditure category, but funds needed to be reallocated to align \nthe financing plan with actual conditions. Procurement oversight by the government has improved \nsince  the  establishment  of  the  DWS  under  the  MPWT  in  2015.  To  ensure  good  governance, \nconditions  precedent  for  contract  award  include  (i)  submission  of  corporate  plans,  and  (ii) \nsubsidiary  loan  agreements  executed.  The  institutional  capacity  of  the  State  Audit  Office  has \nimproved  with  support  from  ADB  and  other  development  partners.  Financial  management \nsolutions  such  as  building  the  accounting  capacity  of  PNP  staff  are  being  considered,  and  an \nindependent auditing company, complying with international standards, is  also being recruited. \nAdditional  measures  will  be  taken  to  enhance  financial  management,  such  as  (i)  updating  the \nPNPs financial reporting systems to comply with international accounting standards, and (ii) PNPs \ncapacity building. No complaints were recorded, nor any incidence of corruption; and compliance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  has  been  satisfactory.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual.13 \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nPoverty reduction and social impacts. The additional financing will directly benefit about \n29. \n19,760  HHs  in the six  towns  with access  to reliable piped water  supply, and  491  of  them  with \naccess  to  improved  sanitation facilities. It  eliminates  barriers  to  access for the  urban  poor  and \nprioritizes poor districts. Health benefits will be derived through access to improved drinking water; \ngreater  water  availability  for  sanitation  and  personal  hygiene;  and  better  access  to  improved \nsanitation. The additional financing will provide VEI grants to enhance community involvement in \nsanitation  and  environmental  improvements,  targeted  latrine  subsidies  for  poor  HHs,  and  free \nwater connections for poor HHs. \n \n30. \nGender.  The  current  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  and  the \nadditional  financing  will  align  with  this.  The  gender  action  plan  builds  on  current  project \nimplementation  experiences.  Gender  benefits  for  women  will  result  from  greater  convenience, \nless physical strain, and time savings in water collection; stronger family health; more privacy and \ndignity when tending to sanitation needs; and improved facilities specific to women\u2019s health and \nmenstrual  hygiene.  It  supports  gender  equity  in  decision-making  on,  and  water  and  sanitation \nissues  management.  Strategic  measures  include  (i)  gender-sensitive  targets  in  the  PNPs\u2019 \ncorporate action plans, (ii) targets for female PNP staff members in the asset management task \nforces,  (ii)  a  target  of  20%\u201330%  of  village  development  committee  subcommittee  members \n(depending upon VEI size) responsible for planning and managing VEIs being women; and (iii) a \nminimum of 30% women staff in the project coordination unit and project implementation units. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n31. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \ncategories are detailed below.14 Any subprojects classified as category A will be excluded from \nthe  overall  project.  Public  consultations  were  carried  out  to  inform  stakeholders  and  affected \npersons  about  the  overall  project  design  and  will  continue  during  implementation.  A  project \nsafeguard grievance redress mechanism will facilitate the resolution of complaints. \n\n                                                \n13 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\n \n32. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  Two  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  reports  and \nenvironmental  management  plans  were  prepared  for  representative  subprojects,  Sopbao  and \nXam-Nua,  in  Houaphan province.  Environmental  management  plans  include  identified  impacts \nmitigation and monitoring measures, enforced by grant covenants, with adequate implementation \nbudget.  The  updated  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  provides  subprojects \nguidance on the selection, screening, assessment, and implementation that will be prepared after \ngrant approval. Draft IEEs, environmental assessment and review framework were disclosed on \nADB website on 13 April 2018.15 Final IEEs will be updated once DEDs are completed.  \n \n33. \nThe subprojects in Sopbao and Xam-Nua will provide safer, cleaner, and more reliable \nwater supply to beneficiaries in 17 villages within the two towns. Identified subprojects will have \nlocalized,  short-term  impacts  during  construction.  Further  studies  are  proposed  during  DED \npreparation in respect of raw water quality and downstream fish conservation zones. Construction \nand  operational  environmental  impacts  can  be  prevented  or  minimized  to  an  acceptable  level \nthrough  effective  implementation  of  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures  specified  in  the \nenvironmental management plans. The proposed capacity building for O&M will include raw water \nquality monitoring, treatment process, management and risks associated with sludge disposal. \n \n34. \nResettlement (category B). Due diligence conducted on four subprojects implemented \nunder  the  current  project  indicates  that  impacts  during  construction  are  temporary  in  nature. \nSafeguard monitoring reports were submitted regularly and disclosed on the ADB website. It also \nconfirms  that  HHs  were  compensated  as  prescribed  in  the  land  acquisition  and  compensation \nplan of each subproject and that no voluntary donation mechanisms were utilized to acquire land. \nOverall, the additional financing will adhere to methods used for the current project, but the land \nacquisition and compensation framework was revised and updated to remove voluntary donation \nmechanisms in relation to the water supply component of the project. \n \nThe two sample subprojects in Sopbao and Xam-Nua will not severely affect any individual \n35. \nor have significant impacts. No land acquisition is required in Sopbao, and only 284 square meters \nof land will be acquired from two HHs in Xam-Nua, but the impacts are not significant in nature, \nrepresenting only 2.94% and 1% of these households\u2019 total land holdings. Temporary or minor \nimpacts on driveways, fences, and walls, with no loss of income, shall occur; the contractor will \nrestore these to pre-project conditions. A loss of fruit-bearing trees will also occur, but the loss of \nincome\u2014at an average of 2% of  HH income\u2014is not significant in nature. Households shall be \ncompensated for their losses at replacement cost. Initial screening was undertaken for four other \nsubprojects already identified but indicated neither land acquisition nor resettlement needs. To \nmitigate and manage any impacts, two land acquisition and compensation plans were developed \nin line with the updated land acquisition and compensation framework and disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite on 26 April 2018.16 The final plans will be updated and disclosed in English and Lao once \nDEDs are completed. No physical or economic displacement will occur until full replacement cost \ncompensation and assistance in accordance with the plans has been paid. \n \n36. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The additional financing is category C for indigenous \npeoples.  The  poverty  and  social  assessment  confirmed  that  the  project  will  not  affect  ethnic \ngroups\u2019 traditional sociocultural or belief practices, customary livelihoods, or ancestral domains. \n \n\n                                                \n15 IEE, Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (available from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Land Acquisition and Compensation Plan, and Land Acquisition and Compensation Framework (available from the \n\nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n37. \nThe overall risk assessment is low, and the integrated benefits and impacts are expected \nto  outweigh  the  costs.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.17  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nGovernment and service  providers do not \nadopt sector  policy reforms. \n\nSlow disbursement as a result of low \nreadiness and slow procurement \n\nMitigating Measures \nAdoption of sector reforms form part of the subproject selection criteria \nand support investment sustainability. Delays should not affect regular \ntariff adjustments. \nThe executing agency has prepared several detailed engineering \ndesigns that can proceed to procurement. Procurement support will be \nprovided, so contracts can be awarded shortly after ADB approval of \nthe additional financing.  \nADB, the World Bank, and other development partners continue to \nsupport ongoing efforts to strengthen public financial management \narrangements, through technical assistance and lending.  \n\nWeak project financial management \nsystem, particularly for accounting, \nbudget preparation and execution, cash \nplanning, and performance measurement  \nShortage of PCU and PNP staff skills in \nfinancial management, including financial \nanalysis, management accounting, \nfinancial reporting, and audit \nArrangements for O&M of subproject \nassets are not implemented \nsuccessfully.
