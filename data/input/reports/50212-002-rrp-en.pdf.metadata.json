This  is  the \nsecond  phase  of  the  Disaster  Resilience  Program  approved  in  December  2016  for  the  Cook \nIslands  to  help  manage  the  fiscal  risk  arising  from  disasters  triggered  by  all  types  of  natural \nhazards.1 Since  the  facility  is  being  provided  pursuant  to  the  CDF  option  under  policy-based \nlending of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), ADB will only provide financing under the facility \nfollowing a natural hazard event that occurs during the facility availability period and leads to the \ndeclaration of a state of disaster in the Cook Islands; or at the end of the facility availability period \nif all conditions for exercise of the deferred disbursement option have been met. \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \nDevelopment context. The Cook Islands is a Polynesian island nation located midway \n3. \nbetween  French  Polynesia  and  Niue.  It  consists  of  15  islands  with  a  land  area  of  67  square \nkilometers spread across 2 million square kilometers of the South Pacific Ocean. About 75% of \nits 17,400 inhabitants live on the largest island of Rarotonga. The Cook Islands depends heavily \non  natural  resources  for  economic  activities.  Until  the  1970s,  the  economy  was  dominantly \nagriculture based, but now tourism contributes about 60% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product \n(GDP).  The  economy  grew  by  8.9%  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  2018,  supported  by  continued  strong \ngrowth in tourism and construction activity on large infrastructure projects in renewable energy, \nwater  supply  and  sanitation,  and  information  and  communication  technology  sectors. 2  GDP \ngrowth is expected to ease as tourism and public investment growth slows but will remain positive \nin the near term. Public debt\u2014equivalent to 22.0% of GDP as of FY2018\u2014remains well below \nthe official threshold (35.0%), and a debt sustainability analysis carried out by ADB points to a \nlow  risk  of  external  debt  distress.  However,  any  sudden  and  severe  shock  can  overturn  fiscal \nbuffers.3 \n \n4. \nDisaster  risk.  The  Cook  Islands  is  highly  vulnerable  to  climate  change  and  disaster \nimpacts,  particularly  coastal  erosion  and  inundation,  droughts,  flooding,  tropical  cyclones, \nincreasing  temperatures,  changing  ocean  currents,  and  abnormal  weather  patterns.  It  has \nperiodically experienced major tropical cyclones with associated high winds, storm surges, and \nflooding, which caused substantial economic damage and loss of life. The country\u2019s high exposure \nto  disasters  arises  from  (i)  its  geographic  location  in  the  South  Pacific  cyclone  belt;  (ii)  the \nremoteness and low-lying nature of many of its islands; and (iii) the proximity of many buildings, \ninfrastructure  assets,  and  services  to  the  coast,  especially  on  Rarotonga.  The  small,  narrowly \nbased economy and heavy reliance on a hazard-sensitive sector such as tourism makes the Cook \nIslands  particularly vulnerable to  natural  hazards,  which are  likely to disrupt  economic  activity, \n\n \n\n1  ADB. 2016. Cook Islands: Disaster Resilience Program. \n2   ADB. 2019. Asian Development Bank Outlook 2019 Update. Manila. \n3  Macroeconomic Assessment Summary: Cook Islands (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nThe Cook Islands is not an International Monetary Fund member, and therefore ADB has prepared a macroeconomic \nassessment summary in lieu of the International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nlead to loss of livelihoods and income, and undermine the fiscal position of the government. The \ndisaster risk was highlighted in 2005, when the country experienced five consecutive cyclones \nwithin  2  months,  including  four  category  5  storms,  which  caused  damages  estimated  at  $10.0 \nmillion.4 Annual GDP growth fell from 2.2% in 2004 to \u20131.1% in 2005, before recovering to 5.0% \nin 2006. Previously, Rarotonga had been extensively damaged by Cyclone Sally in January 1997, \nand in November of the same year, Cyclone Martin destroyed about 90% of houses and killed 19 \npeople  on  Manihiki  atoll.  The  most  recent  major  tropical  cyclone,  in  2010,  damaged  78%  of \nhouses in Aitutaki, devastated crops, and disrupted tourism.5 The average quarterly GDP growth \nof 0.8% in 2009 dropped to \u20132.7% before recovering to 0.7% in 2011. \n \n5. \nGovernment response and development partner coordination. To better manage the \nfiscal  risks  associated  with  disasters,  the  government  set  up  the  Cook  Islands  Disaster \nEmergency Trust Fund in 2011,6 to which it contributes regularly. The fund now has reserves of \nNZ$1.7 million (2019). The Cook Islands also joined the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment \nand Financing Initiative in 2013 and has since participated in the insurance scheme under the \nPacific  Catastrophe  Risk  Insurance  Company,  purchasing  annual  insurance  cover  disasters \nstarting  from  1-in-10-year  events,  using  its  own  funds  for  the  $100,000  annual  premium.  The \nmaximum insurance payout would be $2.7 million, but the Cook Islands has not experienced a \ndisaster triggering a payout. Despite its efforts to strengthen financial resilience to disasters, the \ngovernment would be unlikely to have sufficient resources in the event of a significant disaster to \nmeet  immediate  post-disaster  needs  through  its  budgetary  reserves,  disaster  emergency  trust \nfund, and insurance; it would instead rely heavily on budget reallocations, which can take time to \nsecure  and  will  often  redirect  funds  away  from  development  priorities. 7 Therefore,  the  Cook \nIslands was the first country in the Pacific to set up an arrangement for contingent financing for \ndisasters, through the first phase of the Disaster Resilience Program (footnote 1). \n \n6. \nIn addition to taking steps to reduce financial exposure to disaster risk, the government \nhas taken important steps to improve the country\u2019s resilience to disasters by establishing strong \npolicy  and  institutional  arrangements  for  DRM.  The  National  Sustainable  Development  Plan, \n2016\u20132020  provides  the  overarching  framework  for  a  DRM  strategy  and  seeks  to  integrate \ndisaster and climate resilience into development processes.8 National Development Goal 13 aims \nto strengthen resilience to combat climate change and disaster impacts, particularly at community \nlevel, and by and constructing public buildings and infrastructure to cyclone-strength standards. \nA  DRM  Policy,  approved  in  late  2005,  called  for  the  application  of  formal  risk  management \nprocesses to all aspects of national development planning. The 2007 Disaster Risk Management \nAct set out the institutional and organizational framework for DRM activities, but with a clear focus \non  response,  providing  guidance  on  declaring  a  state  of  disaster  or  emergency.  It  also \npromulgated the establishment of a National Disaster Risk Management Council, chaired by the \nPrime Minister, to ensure high-level oversight, policy guidance, and direction; and replaced the \nprevious  National  Disaster  Management  Office  with  Emergency  Management  Cook  Islands,  a \ndivision of the Office of the Prime Minister.  \n \n \n\n \n\n4  ADB. 2006.

Village-based DRM committees were also established in Rarotonga. The Climate \nChange  and  Disaster  Risk  Management  Platform,  comprising  representatives  of  government \nagencies,  nongovernment  and  civil  society  organizations,  the  private  sector,  and  traditional \nleaders, meets quarterly. \n \n8.  \nA 10-year, NZ$288.0 million National Infrastructure Investment Plan (NIIP) was launched \nin 2015. It sets out the criteria for reducing and managing disaster and climate risks when defining \npriority infrastructure investments, as well as risk mitigation measures.9 Successive infrastructure \nplans highlighted the designation and, where necessary, construction of public buildings suitable \nas cyclone shelters. All investments are required to undergo environmental impact assessments \nin line with the 2003 National Environment Act, including an analysis of the potential impact of \nnatural  hazards.  The  activity  management  cycle  for  investment  planning,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  Te  Tarai  Vaka,  which  is  mandatory  for  activities  in  excess  of \nNZ$150,000, identifies any major risks posed to public investments by climate variability, climate \nchange, and natural hazards, and indicates measures to address these and improve resilience. \n \n9.  \nDespite establishing various DRM policies and institutional arrangements, the government \nrecognizes that more could be done. The DRM gaps identified since the approval of the first phase \nof the program require: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\ndeveloping policies and action plans to step up the prioritization and expansion of \ninvestments in climate and disaster risk resilience; \nbolstering national and local disaster management arrangements by defining roles \nand  responsibilities,  and  operating  procedures  during  disasters;  recognizing  the \nrole of women in DRM; and outlining the national structures and the agreed plans \nfor utilizing international support for disaster response; \nundertaking  regular  capacity  building  or  disaster  drills  nationally  and  locally,  to \nensure the successful implementation of DRM plans during disasters; \nstrengthening  resilience  of  infrastructure  by  incorporating  climate  and  disaster \nresilience considerations into building codes; \nstrengthening disaster information in various areas, such as listing contractors for \npost-disaster  response;  gathering  baseline  data  on  hazards  and  risks;  and \nidentifying climate-proofing needs and financing gaps; \npromoting DRM initiatives that are gender responsive and child specific, i.e., that \ncater to the particular roles and vulnerabilities in communities; and \nimproving access to and management of climate and disaster finance; and fine-\ntuning  policies,  plans,  as  well  as  public  financial  management  (PFM)  and \nexpenditure to better use climate and disaster finance. \n\nThe new policy actions listed in the phase 2 policy matrix are directly tackling these gaps.10 \n\n9  Government of the Cook Islands. 2015. National Infrastructure Investment Plan, 2015\u20132020. Rarotonga. \n10 The policy matrix, including a post-program partnership framework, is in appendix 4: Policy Matrix. \n \n\n \n\n10.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fADB engagement and lessons. The Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility11 supported \n11. \nthe development of the NIIP with a stronger focus on DRM aspects (footnote 9). ADB provided \nfinancial  support  to  the  Cook  Islands  to  assist  with  post-disaster  recovery  and  reconstruction \nfollowing cyclones, including the procurement of materials and equipment, transport supplies and \npersonnel to disaster areas, civil works, and restoration of major productive activities.12 ADB often \nplays a key role in post-disaster needs assessments in the Pacific, and can provide funding for \nthe  humanitarian  phase  through  ADB\u2019s  Asia  Pacific  Disaster  Response  Fund,  for  recovery \nthrough emergency assistance loans, and for longer-term reconstruction through normal lending \nmodalities. However, emergency assistance loans can still take 3 months or more to process, and \nreconstruction loans under normal lending modalities may take significantly longer. These delays \nin  response  and  early  recovery  can  exacerbate  the  indirect  economic  and  social  costs  of \ndisasters, worsen their ultimate impacts, and compromise long-term fiscal balances. Therefore, \nADB has piloted contingent financing for disasters in the Pacific for the Cook Islands and Palau, \nand through the first phase of the regional Pacific Disaster Resilience Program for Samoa, Tonga \nand Tuvalu, as a mechanism to provide more timely post-disaster financing through policy-based \nloans and grants.13 On 1 August 2019, ADB formally adopted CDF as an option under its policy-\nbased lending.14 The second phase of the Pacific regional program for the Marshall Islands, the \nFederated States of Micronesia, Tonga, and Solomon Islands, all ADB concessional assistance \ncountries, was the first operation to apply the CDF option.15 \n \nContingent  financing  for  disasters  is  most  effective  as  part  of  a  broader  disaster  risk \n12. \nfinancing framework, complementing other risk retention and risk transfer instruments. Contingent \nfinancing is particularly cost-effective in addressing risks pertaining to events that would exhaust \nany dedicated national reserves or contingency budgets but occur too frequently to be covered \ncost-effectively  through  insurance.  Governments  should  select  the  most  appropriate  financing \ninstruments based on various factors, including funding needs, required disbursement speed, and \nrelative cost-effectiveness of alternative instruments for specific layers of risk in individual country \ncontexts. \n \n13. \nPhase  1  of  the  Disaster  Resilience  Program.  Phase  1  of  the  program  for  the  Cook \nIslands was the first program set up in the Pacific for providing contingent financing for disasters. \nThe  program  was  approved  in  December  2016  as  a single-tranche,  stand-alone,  policy-based \nloan. Eligibility to access the funds is based on a set of prior policy actions on DRM, but actual \ndisbursement is deferred until a formal declaration of a state of disaster. Phase 1 also includes a \npost-program partnership framework (PPPF) for additional near- and medium-term target policy \nactions on DRM. The country has not experienced a major disaster to trigger disbursement of the \nloan proceeds under phase 1. The 3-year program will be completed in December 2019, and the \ngovernment has requested ADB to continue providing this financing option. \n\n \n\n11 The Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility is a multidonor technical assistance comprising ADB, the governments of \nAustralia  and  New  Zealand,  the  World  Bank  Group  (including  International  Finance  Corporation),  the  European \nCommission, and the European Investment Bank. \n\n12 A loan of $7.1 million was provided for the economic restoration of Manihiki, Pukapuka, and Rakahanga islands after \nCyclone Martin (ADB. 1997. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan \nto  the  Cook  Islands  for  the  Cyclone  Emergency  Rehabilitation  Project.  Manila);  and  a  loan  of  $2.8  million  and \ntechnical assistance of $0.6 million were provided after the 2005 cyclones (ADB. 2005.

Phase 2 of the program for the Cook Islands will be the first time that \n14. \nthe CDF option will be applied to a developing member country  (DMC) only eligible to receive \nregular  loans  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources.  It  provides  rapid  access  to  resources  to \nenable the government to initiate disaster response and early recovery efforts with minimal delay, \nmitigating a disaster\u2019s immediate economic and social impact. To establish its eligibility to access \nthe  contingent  financing,  the  government  made  significant  progress  in  the  phase  1  PPPF  and \ncompleted new policy actions to strengthen disaster and climate risk management.  \n \nThe  program  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,  specifically  its  operational  priority  3 \n15. \n(tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental \nsustainability),  which  supports  strengthening  ADB  DMCs\u2019  financial  preparedness  for  disaster \nresponse  through  policy-based  contingent  financing. 16  The  program  is  consistent  with  the \nobjectives  of  the  ADB  Pacific  Approach,  2016\u22122020,  which  serves  as  ADB\u2019s  operational \nframework for the Pacific region and as the overall country partnership strategy for the 11 smaller \nPacific  DMCs,  including  the  Cook  Islands.17 The  Pacific  Approach  focuses  on  three  strategic \nareas, one of which is managing risks, and highlights the need to (i) expand ADB\u2019s work in climate \nchange and DRM; (ii) introduce innovative solutions to strengthen disaster preparedness, address \nvulnerability, and build resilience; and (iii) pursue a more programmatic and regional approach to \nfinancing climate change and DRM initiatives in the Pacific region. \n \nB. \n \n16. \nThe policy matrix under phase 2 was developed based on progress in achieving phase 1 \nPPPF and new policy actions (Appendix 4). These policy actions are all completed, and they will \nstrengthen the disaster resilience of institutions and communities in three reform areas. \n \n17. \nReform area 1: Policy and institutional arrangements for DRM strengthened. Under \nthis  reform  area,  the  Cook  Islands  launched  a  new  Climate  Change  Policy  2018\u20132028.18 The \npolicy  aligns  with  other  policies  on  crosscutting  issues,  such  as  the  gender  policy  and  the \nenvironmental and social safeguards policy; and reaffirms that climate change activities will be \ngender-responsive, participatory, and fully transparent, as well as being based on an integrated, \nmultisector  approach to sustainable development.  The policy  includes  the  goal  of  accelerating \ngender equality, empowering all women and girls, and advancing the rights of youth, the elderly, \nand the disabled. The government also approved the second Joint National Action Plan for DRM \nand  climate  change  adaptation. 19  The  plan  supports  a  whole-of-government,  all-hazards, \ncoordinated  approach,  closely  aligned  with  other key national  documents,  such  as  sustainable \ndevelopment plans. It covers the related activities of all line agencies, presenting a list of wide-\nranging  actions  and  indicators,  and  includes  gender  analysis  and  actions  to  ensure  stronger \ngender responsiveness  in government  programs  and  stronger  participation  by  women  in  DRM \ndecision-making. It  also requires all  agencies to develop  gender-responsive disaster response \nplans,  and  includes  other  gender-specific  commitments  such  as  developing  and  resourcing  a \ngender-responsive  contingency  plan  for  emergency  supplies.  Emergency  Management  Cook \nIslands and Climate Change Cook Islands, both divisions of the Office of the Prime Minister, are \njointly responsible for implementing the plan.  \n\n \n\n16 ADB.  2018.

To  ensure  the  successful \nimplementation of the island DRM plans both nationally and locally, including in the outer islands, \ntraining sessions were held locally and at government sector agencies. DRM learning modules \nwere also distributed to schools, and training on post-disaster needs assessments is conducted \nannually.  An  online  geoportal,  established  by  Emergency  Management  Cook  Islands  in \ncoordination with the Ministry of Infrastructure and the national Meteorological Services, provides \ndatabases on housing, infrastructure, and other assets, as well as some detailed vulnerability and \nrisk mapping. \n \n20. \nReform area 2: Resilience of physical assets to disaster and climate risks improved. \nThe  Cook  Islands  building  code  and  its  manual  were  also  revised  to  incorporate  climate  and \ndisaster risk considerations. The climate-proofing needs of priority infrastructure are defined in \nthe  NIIP,  and the  government  has recently  prepared  a  gender-responsive  country  program  for \nclimate change financing. The country program promotes gender-responsive, participatory, and \ntransparent low-carbon and climate-resilient pathways. In addition to these key policy actions, the \nMinistry  of  Infrastructure  maintains  and  regularly  updates  lists  of  contractors  and  prices,  and \nservice agreements with some contractors, for emergency services. The Cook Islands Investment \nCorporation  assessed  all  government  buildings,  as  well  as  all  cyclone  shelters,  for  climate-\nproofing needs. \n \n21. \nReform  area  3:  Disaster  risk  financing  expanded.  To  better  manage  the  fiscal  risk \nassociated  with  disasters,  and  in  addition  to budgetary  reserves,  the  government  continues  to \nmake annual budget allocations to the Cook Islands Disaster Emergency Trust Fund. It allocated \nits own resources to the fund in the FY2018 and FY2019 budgets. In addition, since joining the \nPacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative in 2013, it participates in the second \nphase  of  the  insurance  scheme  under  the  Pacific  Catastrophe  Risk  Insurance  Company.  The \ngovernment allocated its own resources to the full payment of the disaster insurance premium in \nthe FY2018 and FY2019 budgets. \n \n22. \nThese reform areas build on progress made during phase 1 of the program, and they were \nalready  identified  in  the  PPPF  for  phase  1.  The  implementation  of  the  policy  actions  was \nencouraged through policy dialogue, which has been ongoing since phase 1. In view of the DRM \ngaps identified since the approval of phase 1 in December 2016, a new PPPF was developed for \nphase 2 (Appendix 4). It includes the government\u2019s near- and medium-term plans to strengthen \nDRM, such as developing a comprehensive land-use policy, updating the NIIP and the associated \nclimate risk assessment, revising the DRM Act, and formulating local DRM plans.

The \nMinistry of Infrastructure will continue to update the lists of contractors and service agreements \nfor emergency services. The government will keep strengthening disaster risk finance through the \nCook Islands Disaster Emergency Trust Fund and disaster insurance. \n \nC. \n \nThe  impact  is  aligned  with  the  national  development  goal  of  the  National  Sustainable \n23. \nDevelopment  Plan\u2014resilience  to  combat  the  impacts  of  climate  change  and  natural  disasters \nstrengthened.23 The program is also aligned with the Framework for Resilient Development in the \nPacific, 2017\u20132030, particularly goal 1 on strengthened integrated adaptation and risk reduction \nto  enhance  resilience  to  climate  change  and  disasters  and  goal  3  on  strengthened  disaster \npreparedness,  response,  and  recovery. 24  The  most  fundamental  benefit  of  the  program  is \nimproved  financial  preparedness  for  disaster  events.  The  program  will  provide  a  timely  and \npredictable source of post-disaster financing to enable rapid decision-making and implementation \nof priority actions. This will reduce the indirect economic and social cost of direct physical losses. \n \n24. \nThe policy actions will ultimately result in economic benefits. In reform area 1, as a result \nof better planning and response, the benefits will include less loss of lives and property, and fewer \nnegative  post-disaster  health  impacts.  In  reform  area  2,  benefits  will  include  less  damage  to \nproperty, greater public safety, and lower costs because of shorter business and public facility \nclosures. These will result from more resilient infrastructure and assets, and faster restoration of \nessential infrastructure and services. In reform area 3, opportunity costs associated with budget \nreallocations and financial costs associated with additional borrowing will decrease, and loss of \nlives and negative health impacts will decline thanks to stronger social protection arrangements \nthat will help ensure that communities can reach safety in the event of a disaster, access sufficient \nrelief supplies for immediate needs, and receive support to rebuild their lives and assets.25 \n \nD. \n \n25. \nDuring the initial availability period (2020\u20132022), the Cook Islands\u2019 overall development \nfinancing needs are estimated to be about 6.2% of GDP ($24.6 million) per annum, of which 5.6% \nof GDP ($22.5 million) will be mobilized from external financing. Post-disaster financing needs \nwere determined based on the likely fiscal impact of medium- and low-frequency disasters (up to \n1-in-10-year  events),  taking  into  account  the  resources  likely  available  from  domestic  and \ninternational sources, the need to ensure that the country maintains sustainable levels of debt, \nand the availability of resources. Data on historical losses related to disasters caused by natural \nhazards  is  incomplete,  but  an  analysis  undertaken  under  the  Pacific  Catastrophe  Risk \nAssessment and Financing Initiative indicates that the country faces an average annual loss of \n$4.9 million from tropical cyclones alone, with probable maximum losses of $10.0 million (3.3% \nof  GDP)  from  a  1-in-10-year  event,  $56.8  million  (18.8%  of  GDP)  from  a  1-in-50-year  event, \n$103.0 million (34.0% of GDP) from a 1-in-100-year event, and $198.1 million (65.5% of GDP) \nfrom  a  1-in-250-year  event.26 The  program  financing,  $10.0  million,  is  less  than  the  cost  of  a \ntypical medium-impact disaster in the Cook Islands. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\n \n\n23 Goal 13 of the Cook Islands\u2019 National Sustainable Development Plan, 2016\u20132020 (footnote 8). \n24 Secretariat  of  the  Pacific  Community.  2016.

Washington, DC. \n \n\n \n\n\fImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe government  has  requested  a  CDF facility  of  NZ$15,676,00027 from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \n26. \ncapital resources to help finance the program. During the term of the facility, the government may \nrequest  one  or  more  loans  from  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility on the terms and conditions set forth in the draft facility agreement. In accordance with the \nCDF policy  pricing  option 2,28 after  the  occurrence  of  a qualifying  disaster,  ADB  and  the  Cook \nIslands will enter into a short-form agreement that will specify the actual loan amount requested \nby the Cook Islands, as well as the lending terms, and only then will ADB commit the requested \namount. Upon signing the short-form agreement, there will be a one-time front-end fee of 0.10% \nof the committed loan amount. If the committed funds are not fully disbursed, the undisbursed \nloan amount could be renewed for a 3-year availability period (up to four times), each time with a \nfee of 0.25% of the renewal amount (up to the undisbursed loan balance), which may be financed \nout of loan proceeds. \n \nE. \n \n27. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Management  will  be  the  program\u2019s  executing \nagency, and will oversee and coordinate the timely implementation of the agreed policy, legal, \nand regulatory actions. The implementing agencies will be Emergency Management Cook Islands \nand Climate Change Cook Islands, both under the Office of the Prime Minister, and the Ministry \nof  Infrastructure.  Eligibility  to  withdraw  from  the  loan  is  based  on  achievement  of  prior  reform \nactions,  which  the  government  implemented  under  phase  2  from  January  2017  to  31 October \n2019. ADB will periodically monitor  and encourage the continuing implementation of the policy \nactions according to the new phase 2 PPPF. \n \nThe program will be completed on 30 June 2023, with a renewal option up to four times of \n28. \nan  additional  3-year  period  each,  for  a  maximum  of  15  years.  The  renewal  is  subject  to \nreconfirmation  as  to  the  adequacy  of  the  macroeconomic  environment,  the  Cook  Islands\u2019 \ncontinued progress toward the PPPF, and an updated PPPF with mutually agreed objectives for \nthe subsequent availability period. The renewal may also be affected by any changes in country \nclassification during the program period.29  \n \n29. \nActual withdrawal requests will be deferred until triggered by the declaration of a state of \ndisaster  in  line  with  the  2007  DRM  Act.  The  government  can  withdraw  the  facility  proceeds \npartially or entirely, depending on its assessment of the disaster\u2019s severity and resulting need. \nOnly a single withdrawal may be requested per disaster event, and the request should be received \nby  ADB  within  90  days  of  the  declaration  of  a  state  of  disaster  or  emergency.30 Undisbursed \namounts will continue to be available during the availability period for subsequent disaster events. \nAny unutilized funds at the conclusion of the facility availability period can be disbursed to the \nCook  Islands  under  the  deferred  disbursement  option,  subject  to  ADB  reconfirming  the  Cook \nIslands\u2019 continuation of policy actions and the PPPF through submission of a progress report. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n27 Equivalent to $10.0 million, as of 23 October 2019. \n28 Footnote 14, paras. 28\u201329. \n29 Footnote 14, para. 26. \n30 Since the start date of a disaster event is often not clear (e.g., droughts, floods) and a declaration usually is issued \nvery shortly after a natural hazard event turns into a disaster, the declaration is used as a proxy for the disaster event.  \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nFunds will be spent through national budget processes for eligible items.31 Proceeds of \n30. \nthe policy-based loans will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time). ADB will periodically monitor the continuing implementation \nof the policy actions and PPPF during the availability period. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n31. \nSafeguards.  The  program  is  classified  as  category  C  for  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous people. Program activities are confined to policy and institutional \nreforms, and none of the activities will result in or lead to any physical works that could create \nenvironmental or social impacts, physical or economic displacement, or involuntary resettlement. \nThe  activities  will  not  negatively  affect  distinct  and  vulnerable  groups  of  indigenous  people. \nStakeholder  dialogue  was  carried  out  during  the  program  design  and  will  continue  during \nimplementation. The policy actions will improve the Cook Islands\u2019 ability to maintain greater fiscal \nstability in the event of a disaster, and to initiate relief and recovery efforts with minimal delay, \nthereby mitigating the immediate economic and social impacts of a disaster. The implementation \nof  the  policy  actions  is  expected  to  further  strengthen  existing  social  protection  arrangements, \nhelping  ensure  that  communities and vulnerable households (including  households headed  by \nwomen) can reach safety in the event of a disaster, access sufficient relief supplies for immediate \nneeds, and receive support to rebuild their lives and assets. \n \n32. \nGender. Women are affected by disasters in ways that are different and often overlooked. \nThe  program  will  directly  benefit  them  by  ensuring  that  gender  is  a  core  component  of  key \nstrategic and policy documents. The first phase of the program was categorized as some gender \nelements. However, since five of the eight policy actions under phase 2 include specific gender \ncommitments,  gender  analysis,  and  targets  on  gender  actions  (paras.  17\u201320),  phase  2  is \ncategorized as effective gender mainstreaming. \n \nGovernance. The government\u2019s latest PFM road map for 2016\u20132020 builds on positive \n33. \nprogress  from  recent  years  and  targets  further  improvements  to  financial  management \nlegislation. 32  Based  on  results  of  the  2015  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability \nassessment, the road map identified key areas for improving PFM policy and legislation, including \n(i) strengthening parliamentary review of the budget, (ii) clarifying responsibilities for PFM across \nall  of  government,  (iii)  revising  processes  around  economic  and  fiscal  monitoring,  and \n(iv) managing transfers of  appropriations and  authorization of  expenditure.  A  PFM  bill  is  being \ndeveloped  to  address  these  and  other  areas,  and  achieve  broader  financial  management  and \ngovernance in the Cook Islands. The government targets the enactment of the PFM bill to take \nplace during FY2019\u2013FY2020, and its implementation to result in strengthened financial reporting, \nmonitoring, and control thereafter. \n \nThe Cook Islands has limited financial arrangements in place for disaster events (para. 5). \n34. \nMoreover, coordinating disaster response  and early recovery,  including  the  support  offered by \ndonors  and  civil  society organizations with  competing requirements  and procedures, can  pose \nsignificant administrative challenges. Therefore, the government\u2019s absorptive capacities are often \nstretched in the aftermath of disaster events. Risks to program implementation relate to possible \nexternal  shocks  to  the  economy  and  capacity  constraints  in  government  agencies,  including \nconstraints in PFM systems. \n \n\n31 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Government of the Cook Islands. 2016.
