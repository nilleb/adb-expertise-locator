The  Second  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts  Rural  Development  Project  (CHTRDP-II)1 was \napproved by ADB in July 2011 for an amount of $55.0 million from ADB\u2019s concessional ordinary \ncapital resources. This loan followed ADB Loan No. 1771-BAN (SF): Chittagong Hill Tracts Rural \nDevelopment Project (CHTRDP-I)2 for $30 million, which was closed in June 2010. CHTRDP-II \nproject is  contributing to poverty reduction by making social services and economic opportunities \nmore accessible to rural people, including indigenous people (IP) and poor women, in three hill \ndistricts (Bandarban, Khagrachari, and Rangamati) of Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT).3 The project \nhas been strengthening institutional capacity; improving the access of remote communities to \nmain roads; and providing improved, other water resources infrastructure and agribusiness \nsupport to increase economic opportunities, particularly of women, to improve rural incomes. The \nloan became effective on 13 December 2011, and will be closed on 30 June 2019. \n \n2.  The ongoing project\u2019s impact is to increase rural household incomes in subproject areas \nin CHT and its outcome is increased income-generating opportunities for men and women in \nsubproject areas.4 The five  main outputs of the project are: (i) institutional development and \ncapacity building (output A), (ii) 100 km of Rural Roads (output B) upgraded, (iii) community \ninfrastructure  in  600  villages  (output  C)  maintained,  (iv)  sustainable  micro  agribusiness \ndevelopment in nine upazilas (output D), and (v) efficient project management operational (output \nE). Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs (MoCHTA) is the executing agency, the CHT Regional \nCouncil (CHTRC) is the lead implementing agency, and the Local Government Engineering \nDepartment (LGED) is the implementing agency for output B. As of 30 September 2017, the \ncumulative contracts awards and disbursements of the project were achieved at $33.7 million \n(73% of the net loan amount5), and $23.95 million (49%), respectively, against the project time \nelapsed 76%. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n3.  The transaction technical assistance (TRTA) will address challenges in the operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of community infrastructure and public assets built through two ADB assisted \nprojects in CHT, and increase the capacity of village level institutes, headed by IPs of CHT, in \nplanning for local development and service delivery. One major component of CHTRDP-I was \ncommunity development where 2,040 small scale infrastructure sub-projects comprising small-\nscale water supply, irrigation, village-roads, etc. were completed in 111 unions.6 Component C of \nCHTRDP-II, which is ongoing, continued the construction of community infrastructure, such as, \nvillage access roads and stairs, water resources development, etc., and supply of irrigation \ninfrastructure and machineries,  in Indigenous Peoples villages locally known as para. The \nprioritization and selection of the interventions and related procurement are community driven. \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n2  ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the  \n    People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Chittagong Hill Tracts Rural Development Project. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Preparing the Second Chittagong Hill \nTracts Rural Development Project. Manila. \n4  Five years after completion of the project (2023) there will be an increase in average annual household income in \nsubproject areas by Tk20,000 at 2010 price level (from Tk63,000 in 2010). \n5  Net Loan amount as of 30 September 2017 is $48.52 million \n6  Union is the smallest rural administrative and local government units in Bangladesh. Each Union is made up of nine  \n   Wards/ villages. \n ", "2 \nThe community infrastructure interventions have already been completed in 356 paras and are \nongoing in another 90. \n \n4.  Separately from these projects, the Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Facility (CHTDF)7, \nled by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) with the contributions from various \ndevelopment partners, has created a network of 3,257 community based organizations across \nthe  CHT,  known  as  Para  Development  Committees  (PDCs),  as  the  basic  institutions  for \ncommunity based development activities. The PDCs are playing a key role in leading community \nbased development initiatives, and other social and economic development activities, as well as \nengaging  with  government  institutions  to  ensure  accountable  rural  service  deliveries. \nRepresented by most of the households of a village, these institutions are encouraging all to \nparticipate in decision making and the management of small development initiatives and income \ngenerating activities supported through small grants to PDCs. Similarly, CHTDF has promoted \n1,685 women groups, commonly known as Para Nari Development Groups (PNDGs), to ensure \naccess to resource management and decision making by the women. \n \n5.  Capitalizing on these achievements, and to develop linkages with local government \ninstitutions and service providers, CHTDF has promoted an Area Based Development Initiative \n(ABDI) in 2013-14, where groups of communities with close geographical proximity (including \naverage five villages/communities) came together to identify issues/problems, develop a project \nof common interest, and access services within their areas. Public assets were created through \n236 sub-projects on rural earthen roads, foot bridges, culverts, school building, rural student \nhostels, rural market sheds, irrigation schemes, water supply, etc.  \n \n6.  While these community infrastructures supported by the two ADB loans and CHTDF \ncontinued to benefit the target communities tangibly, sustainability of those interventions is \nconditional  on  effective  community  planning  for  O&M  of  the  projects.  Due  to  being  less \nadvantaged IP area, the communities do not have sufficient technical skills for maintaining their \nown community infrastructures, although a mechanism to ensure adequate O&M plan and funds \nhas been in place in the project design of CHTRDP-II. Local development planning falls under the \nresponsibility of the Union Parishad (UP), the lowest local governance structure playing a vital \nrole  in  rural  development  service  delivery,  and  coordinated  by  the  Union  Development \nCoordination Committee (UDCC). While UDCCs are responsible for monitoring and maintenance \nof development projects in communities supported by ADB and UNDP, O&M planning for these \nsmall sub-projects has not been developed effectively, due to the government\u2019s less priority and \nlack of maintenance fund at the grass-root levels. The PDC leaders also lack in communication \nskills to approach the UPs for availing annual O&M fund from government\u2019s limited allocation. \nHence, the sustainability of the community infrastructure developed under CHTRDP-I and ABDI, \nand to be developed under CHTRDP-II, is at risk if communities are not capacitated to maintain \nthem independently. The three hill district councils (HDC), who are supposed to maintain the \ninfrastructure after contractor\u2019s defect liability period, do not have enough fund and manpower to \nrepair and maintain all civil structures and machineries (tube-well, power tiller, power pumps, etc.). \nThus, the project outputs are susceptible to inefficiencies and deterioration due to lack of O&M \ncapacity of the local bodies.    \n \n7.  This transaction TA will address the above-mentioned challenges and help to develop and \nenhance the O&M capacity and awareness on planning of local development and service delivery \n                                                 \n7  CHTDF is a multi-dimensional facility that has been enabling UNDP to support the Government of Bangladesh since \n2003. The current project under CHTDF is \u201cStrengthening Inclusive Development in Chittagong Hill Tracts\u201d (SID-\nCHT) which started on 1 October 2016 and will continue for five years up to 30 September 2021. \n ", "3 \nof PDCs supported by CHTRDP- I and CHTRDP-II. The TA will be delivered through UNDP, who \nhas the strongest network in CHT at para level and therefore played a leading role as the \nexecuting agency of the CHTDF and development assistance in the CHT. To enhance the \ncapacities of PDCs, a two-fold approach will be followed: (i) improve the capacity of PDCs on \nmanaging and sustaining community assets/infrastructure; and (ii) strengthening linkages of \nPDCs with UPs. It will aim to improve the community capacity for the sustainable management of \nlocal infrastructure and irrigation equipment. \n \n8.  Such TA support could not be included under the ongoing project due to several reasons: \n(i) the repair and maintenance for the 1st year of completion is usually contractor\u2019s liability. Most \nof the O&M requirements would evolve at the later stage of the project or after the loan closing; \n(ii) any investment in the PDCs of CHTRDP-I could not be supported by CHTRDP-II, and (iii) ADB \ndid not have network like UNDP at UP level to provide handholding support to PDCs in developing \ntheir communication and negotiation skills for O&M planning. The TA was included in the country \noperations business plan (2017-2019) for Bangladesh.8          \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n9.  Output 1: Capacity of PDCs on O&M of Subprojects Strengthened. Based on the \nneeds, a skilled resource pool of local unemployed youths will be created to maintain the \ncommunity assets like power tillers, irrigation pumps, diesel engines, deep and shallow tube-wells, \nvillage footpaths, and stairs. Following the skills training programs, the youths will be provided \nwith necessary tool-boxes for continuing their repair & maintenance (R&M) services to the target \nvillages, which will also help them earn revenue. PDC leaders will be capacitated in 300 selected \nparas to manage the community assets and to maintain linkages with local government. To deliver \nthis output, the following activities will be performed:  \n \n(i)  O&M status of all subprojects will be reviewed. A total of 200 subprojects under \nCHTRDP-I  would  be  prioritized  based  on  needs  assessment.  O&M  provisions \nmentioned in the feasibility study reports for subprojects under CHTRDP-II would also \nbe reviewed in coordination with the Project Management Office (PMO), and 100 \nleast advantaged PDCs will be selected from CHTRDP-II. \n \n(ii)  O&M committees will be strengthened to make them functional. The selected PDCs \nwill form/reform 300 O&M groups, with at least 50% female participation, for future \nmaintenance of the community assets/infrastructures. At least 12 R&M manuals9 will \nbe developed by the capacity development NGO, and the O&M committees will be \ntrained by the NGO and UNDP field staff. \n \n(iii)  900 PDC leaders (at least 30% women) will be trained on leadership, organizational \nand financial management; and 500 PDC members will be trained on participatory \nplanning, and monitoring towards strengthened governance and rural development. \n \n(iv)  At least 125 unemployed youths of the locality will be trained on R&M of community \nassets. Selected PDCs will be divided into different blocks based on the availability \nof the community assets/infrastructure. For each block, unemployed potential youths \nwill  be  trained  on  vocational  skills  for  R&M  of  community  assets.  Concerned \n                                                 \n8  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 October 2016.  \n9  Manuals on R&M of 3 types of tube wells, ring well, Gravity Flow System, Infiltration Gallery, power tiller, diesel fueled \npower pump, electric submersible pump, rural herring bone brick road, and RCC stair, lined irrigation canal system \n ", "4 \nengineers will provide on-the-job training on technical matters. About 4% of the TA \nfund will be utilized for procuring the tool-boxes. \n \n(v)  Asset-user fund will be created in 300 targeted communities. The PDC leaders will \nbe trained on developing the asset-user funds for maintenance of the community \nassets. The fund will initially be created through community contribution and later \nstrengthened by a grant program under UNDP.10 Women PDC members will be given \nprominent  role  in  managing  the  funds,  as  they  are  highly  motivated  by  being \nempowered to monitor the performance of the equipment and civil structures. \n \n10.  Output 2: Capacity and awareness of PDCs on planning of local development and \nservice delivery strengthened. Utilizing the strong network of UNDP at para level, the TA will \nstrengthen linkages between PDCs and UPs and other local government departments to avail \nnecessary services for achieving sustainable community development in the CHT. To achieve \nthis output, key areas of work will include the following:  \n \n(i)  Negotiation skills of PDC leaders will be enhanced. A total of 600 PDC leaders will \nbe  trained  on  negotiation  skills  to  mobilize  resources  and  services  from  local \ngovernment  (Union  and  Upazila),  different  line  departments,  and  other  service \nproviders. This will help the PDCs build community assets and maintain the public \nassets. \n \n(ii)  300 joint-plans for operation and maintenance of public infrastructures, considering \ncost sharing by both PDCs and UPs, will be developed and implemented. \n \n(iii)  Coordination mechanism at local level will be strengthened. Quarterly coordination \nmeetings between PDCs and UDCCs will be organized to discuss: (a) development \nplanning,  (b)  services  requirement,  (c)  potential  resources  identification,  (d) \nimplementing the joint-plans, and (e) joint progress monitoring. This will help routine \nmaintenance of public assets like village roads, stairs, footpath, culverts, etc. The \nPDCs  will  also  be  able  to  avail  different  services  from  the  government  line \ndepartments (i.e. LGED, PWD, DPHE, PDB, etc.)11, who attend the UDCC meetings \nregularly. Special attention will be given to PNDGs to link with relevant government \ndepartments (e.g. department of youth, women affairs, social welfare, etc.) to extract \nmore services/resources. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n1. \n \n12.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace for the monitoring and supervision consultant, venue for meetings, access to data, and \nother in-kind contributions. UNDP will provide counterpart support in the form of salaries and other \nemployment benefits for their field staff participating in the program, partial office space at CHT \nand Dhaka, logistic support under CHTDF, and other in-kind contributions. \n                                                 \n10 UNDP\u2019s ongoing project under CHTDF has a provision of about $5 million to be provided as micro-grant to 1,500 \nPDCs. The 300 PDCs under the TA will get priority to be linked with that grant program. \n11 LGED \u2013 Local Government Engineering Department, PWD- Public Works Department, DPHE- Department of Public \nHealth Engineering, PDB- Power Development Board. \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  Executing agency and implementing agency. ADB will administer the TA, while UNDP, \nas a lead partner of the CHTDF, will be the implementing agency. According to the Memorandum \nof Understanding (MOU) between ADB and UNDP signed in 2007, and amended in June 2014, \nUNDP shall be responsible for the project, using funds that are transferred by ADB to UNDP for \nthe project.12 A draft administrative arrangement between the ADB and UNDP has been prepared \nas per the MOU, which describes the implementation arrangement and fund transfer mechanism \nin details (linked document No. 2 of Appendix 2). While MoCHTA will be the executing agency of \nthe TA, Chittagong Hill Tracts Regional Council and PMO for CHTRDP-II will be the government \ncounterparts of the TA. Project support committees like Upazila Advisory Committee will be \nutilized for coordinating the implementation with local authorities, including advice on engagement \nof service providers.  \n \n14.  UNDP, through CHTDF, will select, supervise, and evaluate performance of the local \nNGOs, and procure goods to implement the activities at field level. Procurement of all goods and \nservices will be done according to Article XVIII of the draft administrative arrangement. The \nextensive networking between the UPs and PDCs, and logistic support at village level will be \nprovided by CHTDF staff placed at district and upazila level. One individual consultant will also \nbe recruited by ADB to monitor the overall progress of the TA activities at field level. ADB will \nretain $29,000 for the consulting service and transfer $471,000 to UNDP as per the draft \nadministrative arrangement mentioned in Para. 13.
