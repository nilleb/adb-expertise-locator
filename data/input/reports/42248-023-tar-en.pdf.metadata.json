This loan followed ADB Loan No. 1771-BAN (SF): Chittagong Hill Tracts Rural \nDevelopment Project (CHTRDP-I)2 for $30 million, which was closed in June 2010. CHTRDP-II \nproject is  contributing to poverty reduction by making social services and economic opportunities \nmore accessible to rural people, including indigenous people (IP) and poor women, in three hill \ndistricts (Bandarban, Khagrachari, and Rangamati) of Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT).3 The project \nhas  been  strengthening  institutional  capacity;  improving  the  access  of  remote  communities  to \nmain  roads;  and  providing  improved,  other  water  resources  infrastructure  and  agribusiness \nsupport to increase economic opportunities, particularly of women, to improve rural incomes. The \nloan became effective on 13 December 2011, and will be closed on 30 June 2019. \n \n2. \nThe ongoing project\u2019s impact is to increase rural household incomes in subproject areas \nin  CHT  and  its  outcome  is  increased  income-generating  opportunities  for  men  and  women  in \nsubproject  areas.4 The  five    main  outputs  of  the  project  are:  (i) institutional  development  and \ncapacity  building  (output  A),  (ii) 100  km  of  Rural  Roads  (output  B)  upgraded,  (iii)  community \ninfrastructure  in  600  villages  (output  C)  maintained,  (iv)  sustainable  micro  agribusiness \ndevelopment in nine upazilas (output D), and (v) efficient project management operational (output \nE). Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs (MoCHTA) is the executing agency, the CHT Regional \nCouncil  (CHTRC)  is  the  lead  implementing  agency,  and  the  Local  Government  Engineering \nDepartment  (LGED)  is  the  implementing  agency  for  output  B.  As  of  30  September  2017,  the \ncumulative  contracts  awards  and  disbursements  of  the  project  were  achieved  at  $33.7  million \n(73% of the net loan amount5), and $23.95 million (49%), respectively, against the project time \nelapsed 76%. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nJustification \n\n3. \nThe transaction technical assistance (TRTA) will address challenges in the operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of community infrastructure and public assets built through two ADB assisted \nprojects in CHT, and increase the capacity of village level institutes, headed by IPs of CHT, in \nplanning for local development and service delivery.  One  major component of CHTRDP-I  was \ncommunity development where 2,040 small scale infrastructure sub-projects comprising small-\nscale water supply, irrigation, village-roads, etc. were completed in 111 unions.6 Component C of \nCHTRDP-II, which is ongoing, continued the construction of community infrastructure, such as, \nvillage  access  roads  and  stairs,  water  resources  development,  etc.,  and  supply  of  irrigation \ninfrastructure  and  machineries,    in  Indigenous  Peoples  villages  locally  known  as  para.  The \nprioritization and selection of the interventions and related procurement are community driven. \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n3  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Preparing the Second Chittagong Hill \n\nTracts Rural Development Project. Manila. \n\n4  Five years after completion of the project (2023) there will be an increase in average annual household income in \n\nsubproject areas by Tk20,000 at 2010 price level (from Tk63,000 in 2010). \n\n5  Net Loan amount as of 30 September 2017 is $48.52 million \n6  Union is the smallest rural administrative and local government units in Bangladesh. Each Union is made up of nine  \n   Wards/ villages. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ninstitutions \n\nThe community infrastructure interventions have already been completed in 356 paras and are \nongoing in another 90. \n \nSeparately from these projects, the Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Facility (CHTDF)7, \n4. \nled by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) with the contributions from various \ndevelopment partners, has created a network of 3,257 community based organizations across \nthe  CHT,  known  as  Para  Development  Committees  (PDCs),  as  the  basic  institutions  for \ncommunity based development activities. The PDCs are playing a key role in leading community \nbased development initiatives, and other social and economic development activities, as well as \nengaging  with  government \nto  ensure  accountable  rural  service  deliveries. \nRepresented  by  most  of  the  households  of  a  village,  these  institutions  are  encouraging  all  to \nparticipate in decision making and the management of small development initiatives and income \ngenerating activities supported through small grants to PDCs. Similarly, CHTDF has promoted \n1,685 women groups, commonly known as Para Nari Development Groups (PNDGs), to ensure \naccess to resource management and decision making by the women. \n \nCapitalizing  on  these  achievements,  and  to  develop  linkages  with  local  government \n5. \ninstitutions and service providers, CHTDF has promoted an Area Based Development Initiative \n(ABDI)  in  2013-14,  where  groups  of  communities  with  close  geographical  proximity  (including \naverage five villages/communities) came together to identify issues/problems, develop a project \nof common interest, and access services within their areas. Public assets were created through \n236  sub-projects  on  rural  earthen  roads,  foot  bridges,  culverts,  school  building,  rural  student \nhostels, rural market sheds, irrigation schemes, water supply, etc.  \n \nWhile  these  community  infrastructures  supported  by  the  two  ADB  loans  and  CHTDF \n6. \ncontinued  to  benefit  the  target  communities  tangibly,  sustainability  of  those  interventions  is \nconditional  on  effective  community  planning  for  O&M  of  the  projects.  Due  to  being  less \nadvantaged IP area, the communities do not have sufficient technical skills for maintaining their \nown community infrastructures, although a mechanism to ensure adequate O&M plan and funds \nhas been in place in the project design of CHTRDP-II. Local development planning falls under the \nresponsibility of the Union Parishad (UP), the lowest local governance structure playing a vital \nrole  in  rural  development  service  delivery,  and  coordinated  by  the  Union  Development \nCoordination Committee (UDCC). While UDCCs are responsible for monitoring and maintenance \nof development projects in communities supported by ADB and UNDP, O&M planning for these \nsmall sub-projects has not been developed effectively, due to the government\u2019s less priority and \nlack of maintenance fund at the grass-root levels. The PDC leaders also lack in communication \nskills to approach the UPs for availing annual O&M fund from government\u2019s limited allocation. \nHence, the sustainability of the community infrastructure developed under CHTRDP-I and ABDI, \nand to be developed under CHTRDP-II, is at risk if communities are not capacitated to maintain \nthem  independently.  The  three  hill  district  councils  (HDC),  who  are  supposed  to  maintain  the \ninfrastructure after contractor\u2019s defect liability period, do not have enough fund and manpower to \nrepair and maintain all civil structures and machineries (tube-well, power tiller, power pumps, etc.). \nThus, the project outputs are susceptible to inefficiencies and deterioration due to lack of O&M \ncapacity of the local bodies.    \n \n7. \nThis transaction TA will address the above-mentioned challenges and help to develop and \nenhance the O&M capacity and awareness on planning of local development and service delivery \n\n                                                 \n7  CHTDF is a multi-dimensional facility that has been enabling UNDP to support the Government of Bangladesh since \n2003. The current project under CHTDF is \u201cStrengthening Inclusive Development in Chittagong Hill Tracts\u201d (SID-\nCHT) which started on 1 October 2016 and will continue for five years up to 30 September 2021. \n\n\fof PDCs supported by CHTRDP- I and CHTRDP-II. The TA will be delivered through UNDP, who \nhas  the  strongest  network  in  CHT  at  para  level  and  therefore  played  a  leading  role  as  the \nexecuting  agency  of  the  CHTDF  and  development  assistance  in  the  CHT.  To  enhance  the \ncapacities of PDCs, a two-fold approach will be followed: (i) improve the capacity of PDCs on \nmanaging  and  sustaining  community  assets/infrastructure;  and  (ii)  strengthening  linkages  of \nPDCs with UPs. It will aim to improve the community capacity for the sustainable management of \nlocal infrastructure and irrigation equipment. \n\n \nSuch TA support could not be included under the ongoing project due to several reasons: \n8. \n(i) the repair and maintenance for the 1st year of completion is usually contractor\u2019s liability. Most \nof the O&M requirements would evolve at the later stage of the project or after the loan closing; \n(ii) any investment in the PDCs of CHTRDP-I could not be supported by CHTRDP-II, and (iii) ADB \ndid not have network like UNDP at UP level to provide handholding support to PDCs in developing \ntheir communication and negotiation skills for O&M planning. The TA was included in the country \noperations business plan (2017-2019) for Bangladesh.8          \n \n\nB. \n\nOutputs and Activities  \n\n9. \nOutput  1:  Capacity  of  PDCs  on  O&M  of  Subprojects  Strengthened.  Based  on  the \nneeds,  a  skilled  resource  pool  of  local  unemployed  youths  will  be  created  to  maintain  the \ncommunity assets like power tillers, irrigation pumps, diesel engines, deep and shallow tube-wells, \nvillage footpaths, and stairs. Following the skills training programs, the youths will be provided \nwith necessary tool-boxes for continuing their repair & maintenance (R&M) services to the target \nvillages, which will also help them earn revenue. PDC leaders will be capacitated in 300 selected \nparas to manage the community assets and to maintain linkages with local government. To deliver \nthis output, the following activities will be performed:  \n\n \n(i)  O&M  status  of  all  subprojects  will  be  reviewed.  A  total  of  200  subprojects  under \nCHTRDP-I  would  be  prioritized  based  on  needs  assessment.  O&M  provisions \nmentioned in the feasibility study reports for subprojects under CHTRDP-II would also \nbe  reviewed  in  coordination  with  the  Project  Management  Office  (PMO),  and  100 \nleast advantaged PDCs will be selected from CHTRDP-II. \n \n\n(ii)  O&M committees will be strengthened to make them functional. The selected PDCs \nwill form/reform 300 O&M groups, with at least 50% female participation, for future \nmaintenance of the community assets/infrastructures. At least 12 R&M manuals9 will \nbe developed by the capacity development NGO, and the O&M committees will be \ntrained by the NGO and UNDP field staff. \n \n\n(iii)  900 PDC leaders (at least 30% women) will be trained on leadership, organizational \nand financial management; and 500 PDC members will be trained on participatory \nplanning, and monitoring towards strengthened governance and rural development. \n\n \n(iv)  At least 125 unemployed youths of the locality will be trained on R&M of community \nassets. Selected PDCs will be divided into different blocks based on the availability \nof the community assets/infrastructure. For each block, unemployed potential youths \nwill  be  trained  on  vocational  skills  for  R&M  of  community  assets.  Concerned \n\n                                                 \n8  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 October 2016.  \n9  Manuals on R&M of 3 types of tube wells, ring well, Gravity Flow System, Infiltration Gallery, power tiller, diesel fueled \npower pump, electric submersible pump, rural herring bone brick road, and RCC stair, lined irrigation canal system \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nengineers will provide on-the-job training on technical matters. About 4% of the TA \nfund will be utilized for procuring the tool-boxes. \n\n \n(v)  Asset-user fund will be created in 300 targeted communities. The PDC leaders will \nbe  trained  on  developing  the  asset-user  funds  for  maintenance  of  the  community \nassets.  The  fund  will  initially  be  created  through  community  contribution  and  later \nstrengthened by a grant program under UNDP.10 Women PDC members will be given \nprominent  role  in  managing  the  funds,  as  they  are  highly  motivated  by  being \nempowered to monitor the performance of the equipment and civil structures. \n\n \n10. \nOutput 2: Capacity and awareness of PDCs on planning of local development and \nservice delivery strengthened. Utilizing the strong network of UNDP at para level, the TA will \nstrengthen linkages between PDCs and UPs and other local government departments to avail \nnecessary  services  for achieving  sustainable  community  development  in  the  CHT.  To  achieve \nthis output, key areas of work will include the following:  \n\n \n(i)  Negotiation skills of PDC leaders will be enhanced. A total of 600 PDC leaders will \nbe  trained  on  negotiation  skills  to  mobilize  resources  and  services  from  local \ngovernment  (Union  and  Upazila),  different  line  departments,  and  other  service \nproviders. This will help the PDCs build community assets and maintain the public \nassets. \n \n\n(ii)  300 joint-plans for operation and maintenance of public infrastructures, considering \n\ncost sharing by both PDCs and UPs, will be developed and implemented. \n\n(iii)  Coordination mechanism at local level will be strengthened. Quarterly coordination \nmeetings between PDCs and UDCCs will be organized to discuss: (a) development \nplanning,  (b)  services  requirement,  (c)  potential  resources  identification,  (d) \nimplementing the joint-plans, and (e) joint progress monitoring. This will help routine \nmaintenance  of  public  assets  like  village  roads,  stairs,  footpath,  culverts,  etc.  The \nPDCs  will  also  be  able  to  avail  different  services  from  the  government  line \ndepartments (i.e. LGED, PWD, DPHE, PDB, etc.)11, who attend the UDCC meetings \nregularly. Special attention will be given to PNDGs to link with relevant government \ndepartments (e.g. department of youth, women affairs, social welfare, etc.) to extract \nmore services/resources. \n\nC. \n\nCost and Financing \n\n11. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $500,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n1. \n \n12. \nThe  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff, office \nspace  for  the  monitoring  and  supervision  consultant,  venue  for  meetings,  access  to  data,  and \nother in-kind contributions. UNDP will provide counterpart support in the form of salaries and other \nemployment benefits for their field staff participating in the program, partial office space at CHT \nand Dhaka, logistic support under CHTDF, and other in-kind contributions. \n                                                 \n10 UNDP\u2019s ongoing project under CHTDF has a provision of about $5 million to be provided as micro-grant to 1,500 \n\nPDCs. The 300 PDCs under the TA will get priority to be linked with that grant program. \n\n11 LGED \u2013 Local Government Engineering Department, PWD- Public Works Department, DPHE- Department of Public \n\nHealth Engineering, PDB- Power Development Board. \n\n\fD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n13. \nExecuting agency and implementing agency. ADB will administer the TA, while UNDP, \nas a lead partner of the CHTDF, will be the implementing agency. According to the Memorandum \nof Understanding (MOU) between ADB and UNDP signed in 2007, and amended in June 2014, \nUNDP shall be responsible for the project, using funds that are transferred by ADB to UNDP for \nthe project.12 A draft administrative arrangement between the ADB and UNDP has been prepared \nas per the MOU, which describes the implementation arrangement and fund transfer mechanism \nin details (linked document No. 2 of Appendix 2). While MoCHTA will be the executing agency of \nthe TA, Chittagong Hill Tracts Regional Council and PMO for CHTRDP-II will be the government \ncounterparts  of  the  TA.  Project  support  committees  like  Upazila  Advisory  Committee  will  be \nutilized for coordinating the implementation with local authorities, including advice on engagement \nof service providers.  \n \n14. \nUNDP,  through  CHTDF,  will  select,  supervise,  and  evaluate  performance  of  the  local \nNGOs, and procure goods to implement the activities at field level. Procurement of all goods and \nservices  will  be  done  according  to  Article  XVIII  of  the  draft  administrative  arrangement.  The \nextensive  networking  between  the  UPs  and  PDCs,  and  logistic  support  at  village  level  will  be \nprovided by CHTDF staff placed at district and upazila level. One individual consultant will also \nbe recruited by ADB to monitor the overall progress of the TA activities at field level. ADB will \nretain  $29,000  for  the  consulting  service  and  transfer  $471,000  to  UNDP  as  per  the  draft \nadministrative arrangement mentioned in Para. 13.
