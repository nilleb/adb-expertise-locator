This  is  a  key  infrastructure  component  for \nachieving  the  project\u2019s  outcome  and  for  optimizing  project  costs.  The  SEB  will  ensure that the \nwater quality in the Chubek Irrigation System (CIS) is suitable for agricultural production. It will \noptimize  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  of  the  CIS  in  the  long-term  by  reducing \nsediment inflow. The cost overrun was identified during detailed technical surveys and structural \ndesign under the original project. Actual site conditions were inconsistent with the assumptions \napplied  for  the  feasibility-level  design  of  the  SEB  prepared  during  project  preparation.  The \ntechnical  design  of  the  SEB  requires  substantial  revision  to  achieve  its  anticipated  sediment-\nremoving function. This will result in a cost overrun.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n \n\nRationale \n\n \n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the original project on 28 September 2016. \nIt  aims  to  support  agricultural  development  in  the  Pyanj  River  Basin  (PRB)  by  improving  the \ngovernment\u2019s  water  resources  management  (WRM)  capacity  and  increasing  agricultural \nproductivity and water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture.2 The project became effective on 8 \nAugust 2017. The Ministry of Energy and Water Resources (MEWR) and the Agency for Land \nReclamation and Irrigation (ALRI) are the executing agencies.3  \n \n\n \n\nUnder the MEWR-led component, the project has established a river basin organization \nand  provided  support  to  strengthen  its  capacity  for  river  basin  management.  This  includes \nimproved monitoring of water use for irrigation. The project supports Tajikistan\u2019s contribution to \nthe joint management of the PRB through the Afghanistan\u2013Tajikistan PRB commission.4 Under \nthe  ALRI-led  component,  the  CIS,  including  its  irrigation  and drainage  (I&D)  infrastructure and \npumping stations, are to be modernized and climate-proofed. The project also supports capacity \nbuilding  of  farmers  and  water  user  associations  (WUAs)  to  boost  water  use  efficiency  and \nagricultural productivity. \n \n\n \n\nThe  first  additional  financing  of  the  project  was  approved  on  21  June  2018. 5  This \n\n \n\n1  ADB.  Republic  of  Tajikistan:  Water  Resources  Management  in  Pyanj  River  Basin  Project;  and  ADB.  Republic  of \nTajikistan: Water Resources Management in the Pyanj River Basin Project (Additional Finance). The original project \nwas approved in 2016; the first additional financing was approved in 2018. In this report, \u201congoing project\u201d pertains \nto both the original project and the first additional financing, while \u201coverall project\u201d refers to the original project, first \nadditional financing, and proposed second additional financing. \n\n2  ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nexpanded  the  scope  of  the  original  project  to  include  capacity  building  and  institutional \ndevelopment of the State Agency for Hydrometeorology of Tajikistan (Hydromet). It also provided \nquality  climate  services  to  ALRI,  MEWR,  and  other  key  stakeholders  for  WRM,  agricultural \nproduction, and disaster risk reduction in the PRB. It became effective on 7 March 2019. Hydromet \nis  the  executing  agency  for  the  first  additional  financing.  Improved  information  delivery, \nforecasting,  and  early  warning  by  Hydromet  will  (i)  support  efficient  WRM  and  agricultural \nproductivity  among  river  basin  organizations, 6  WUAs,  and  farmers;  and  (ii)  reduce  disaster \nimpacts on settlements, water resources, and irrigation infrastructure.  \n \n\n \n\nThe original project included an SEB at the intake of the CIS to limit sediment entry to the \nirrigation system, prevent damage to pumps for lifting irrigation water to the command area, and \nreduce future O&M costs for sediment removal. During project implementation, modifications in \nthe design parameters for the SEB resulted in a revised design. The newly designed SEB is a \nlarger structure with an updated configuration and higher investment cost.7 The revised design \nwill ensure that the originally anticipated purpose of the SEB is achieved.  \n  \n\n \n\nThe second additional financing will bridge the financing gap to complete the construction \nof the SEB and achieve the project\u2019s outcome. The SEB is essential to achieving the output 2 \ntargets by (i) reducing sediment load entering the CIS canal from the Pyanj River, (ii) increasing \nthe irrigation conveyance efficiency of on-farm canals in the CIS,8  (iii) increasing the efficiency of \npump stations in the CIS, and (iv) providing access to water for selected households. \n \n\nThe ongoing project is performing well based on the following assessment:9  \n(i)  Project performance. Progress for the ongoing project is on track. It is expected that \nall activities will be completed within the project period. The original project was rated \nas a potential problem from the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2018 until Q1 2019. This was \nlargely  due  to  the  delay  in  procurement  of  the  two  major  civil  works  packages, \nincluding that for the SEB. The executing agency could not commence procurement \nbefore initiating the processing of the additional financing. The rating is on track since \nthese  major  civil  works packages  have  been  awarded.10 All  project  implementation \nconsultants\u2019  teams  have  also  been  recruited  and  are  providing  services.  No  major \npackages  are  pending  procurement.  The  original  project  has  been  rated  on  track \nsince Q2 2019. To accommodate the construction period of the SEB, the loan and \ngrants  closing  date  of  the  original  project  was  extended  by  2  years,  from  30  June \n2022 to 30 June 2024. As of 31 July 2020, of the total loan and grant amount of $28.0 \nmillion  for  the  original  project,  cumulative  contract  awards  totaled  $22.3  million  (or \n80.0% of the total loan and grant amount) and cumulative disbursements totaled $6.1 \nmillion  (22.0%).  The  first  additional  financing  has  been  on  track  since  becoming \neffective in March 2019. As of 31 July 2020, of the total grant amount of $11.5 million, \ncumulative contract awards for the first additional financing is $2.3 million (20.0%), \nwhile cumulative disbursement amount is $1.0 million (8.6%). \n\n(ii)  Compliance  with  safeguard  policy  requirements.  The  ongoing  project  is \n\n \n\n6  Multiple  river  basin  organizations  are  being  created  by  different  donors  in  line  with  the  Water  Sector  Reform \n\nProgramme 2016\u20132025 adopted by the Government of Tajikistan in 2015. \n\n7  The SEB in the original project was about 100 meters wide by 500 m long. The revised SEB is about 240 m wide by \n\n764 m long.  \n\nof water conveyed from the source.\u201d \n\n8  Irrigation conveyance efficiency is defined as \u201cthe amount of water reaching the irrigated field, divided by the amount \n\n9  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 One civil works package was awarded in July 2019, and the other package that includes the SEB which was awarded \n\nin July 2020.  \n\n \n\n\fcategorized  B  for  environment  and  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous \npeoples.  No  significant  adverse  social  or  environmental  impacts  are  expected,  as \nphysical activities are primarily conducted on existing irrigation systems. The project \ncomplies with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Safeguards due diligence \nreports and the initial environmental examination have been updated based on the \nlatest design of the SEB. To date, safeguard policy requirements have been complied \nwith and no outstanding corrective actions are required. \n\n(iii)  Delivery  of  expected  outputs.  The  ongoing  project  is  successful  in  meeting  its \nintended  outputs:  (a)  water  resources  in  the  PRB  better managed, (b) modernized \nand  climate-proofed  CIS  WRM  infrastructure  fully  operational,  and  (c)  farm \nmanagement capacity and water use skill improved. \n\n(iv)  Management of risks. Management of identified risks is successful. The 2018 audit \nmanagement  letter  identified  internal  control  risks  related  to  budget  execution, \nmanagement of fees and penalties, and tender documents. ALRI has taken measures \nto  address  these.  The  project  has  adequate  arrangements  to  manage  risks.  The \nproject implementation groups (PIGs) of ALRI, MEWR, and Hydromet implement the \nproject  activities.  The  project  implementation  consultants  support  the  PIGs  in \nmanaging  technical,  financial,  and  procurement  risks  and  other  aspects  of \nproject implementation. \n\n \n\n \n\nOverall, the eligibility criteria for additional financing have been met. The ongoing project \nremains technically feasible and is expected to sustain its economic viability in the long term. The \nfinancial  sustainability  of  the  project  is  a challenge.  This  is  in the  context  of  financing  of  O&M \ncosts,  irrigation  system  fee  (ISF)  adequacy,  ability  of  users  to  pay,  and  rigorous  asset \nmanagement.  The  Government  of  Tajikistan  will  need  to  substantially  increase  annual  O&M \nallocations through the increase of ISF. It will also need to introduce a continuous annual ISF and \ntariff  adjustment  mechanism.  ADB  will  continue  to  work  with  the  government  to  financial \nsustainability  by  accessing  grant  allocations  from  the  12th  replenishment  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF 13) to improve debt management. This will enhance project efforts to \nsupport a more structured approach to O&M cost rationalization and allocation of suitable budget \nfor O&M, within a public financial management context. \n \n\n \n\nThe  second  additional  financing  is  a  high  priority  for  the  government,  and  remains \nconsistent  with  the  project\u2019s  development  objectives.  It  is  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy for Tajikistan, 2016\u20132020.11 The second additional financing is aligned with \nthe  ADB  Strategy  2030  operational  priority  on  promoting  rural  development  and  food  security, \nand  with  the  strategy\u2019s  guiding  principles  of  promoting  innovative  technology  and  delivering \nintegrated solutions.12 \n \n\n \n\nTajikistan  is  experiencing  significant  adverse  economic  and  social  impacts  from  the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Food security in Tajikistan is at risk from the impact \nof COVID-19 and prices of essential food items increased during Q1 2020, affecting the poor.13 \nThe  second  additional  financing  will  contribute  to  increased  agricultural  productivity  and  food \nsecurity  by  improving  irrigation  system  performance.  The  impact  of  COVID-19  on  project \nimplementation  will  not  be  significant.  This  is  since  the  country  does  not  have  restrictions  on \ninternal  movement  of  people.  Although  Tajikistan\u2019s  borders  have  been  closed  for  passenger \n\n \n\n11 ADB. 2016. Country Partnership Strategy: Tajikistan, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n12 ADB.  2018.

The  government  has  not  imposed  in-country  movement  restrictions  and  this  will \nenable civil works planned under the project to be implemented.  \n \n\n \n\nThe International Monetary Fund assessed Tajikistan to be in high debt distress, further \njeopardized by the COVID-19 situation.14 This will impact the project\u2019s financial sustainability in \nterms of availability of the O&M budget and ALRI\u2019s ability to continue to collect and adjust the ISF. \nThrough  a  separate technical  assistance,15 ADB will  support  a  broader sector-wide  initiative  to \naddress  systemic  issues  of  debt  management  and  improved  allocation  of  O&M  budget  for \nirrigation and water resource infrastructure in Tajikistan. \n \nB. \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\nThe impact and outcome for the overall project will remain unchanged with the inclusion \nof the second additional financing. The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) irrigated \nland  in  good  condition  and  food  security  increased, 16  (ii)  efficiency  of  water  resource  use \nincreased,17 and (iii) climate resilience of agriculture and WRM improved.18 The project will have \nthe  following  outcomes:  (i)  agricultural  production  increased  in  CIS  area  of  PRB,  and  (ii) \nagricultural productivity and relevance of forecasting services increased in the PRB.19 \n \nC. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n \n\nThe  second  additional  financing  will  cover  the  cost  overrun  of  one  civil  works  package \n\nunder output 2 of the original project and will not directly contribute to outputs 1 and 3. \n \n\n \n\nOutput  2:  Modernized  and  climate-proofed  Chubek  Irrigation  System  water \nresources  management  infrastructure  fully  operational  (unchanged).  This  includes  (i) \nrehabilitation,  modernization,  and  climate-proofing  of  I&D  infrastructure;  (ii)  construction  of  an \nSEB; (iii) modernization and rehabilitation of pumping units; and (iv) capacity development of ALRI \nstaff. The first component will cover the Chubek main canal, including the head regulator, escape \nstructure, cross regulators, offtake structures, inter-farm and on-farm I&D canals and associated \nstructures. ALRI will remove the sediment along the main and inter-farm canals using machines \nto be procured under the original project, while WUAs and farmers will remove the sediment along \non-farm I&D canals. The flow capacities of canals have been checked against the climate change \nrisks anticipated during the next 50 years and augmented where required. With modernization \nand rehabilitation, irrigation conveyance efficiency will increase from the present 60.0% to 66.0% \nfor gravity-fed systems, and to 82.0% for pump-fed systems. \n \n\n \n\nThe  second  component  will  reduce  the  CIS  O&M  requirements,  as  the  larger  SEB  will \nremove about 85.0% of sediment entering the main canal. The second additional financing will \ncover the cost overrun to construct the larger SEB (para. 6).

The larger SEB to be constructed under the project will trap sediment flowing into the \nCIS.  This  will  mitigate  sediment deposits  in the main and  secondary  irrigation  canals  and  limit \ndamage to pumps for lifting irrigation water. The SEB will ensure that the project outcome and \noutputs are achieved. \n \n\n \n\nThe structural design of the SEB is technically feasible. Its detailed structural design was \nreviewed by applying the latest sediment particle size data, taking into account topographic and \nhydraulic survey results.26  \n \nB. \n \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \n\nThe  project  is  expected  to  be  economically  viable  in  the  long-term.  The  project\u2019s \nrecalculated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 22.7% and the economic net present value \n(NPV) is $25.4 million (TJS239.4 million) at a discount rate of  12.0%.27 This compares with an \nEIRR of 16.3% and an economic NPV of $15.7 million (TJS105.7 million) estimated at appraisal.28 \n\nin Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n26 Technical Report on Design Changes of the Sediment Excluding Basin (accessible from the list of linked documents \n\n27 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n28 In 2015 prices and using a 12.0% discount rate. A 12.0% discount rate has been also used in the updated economic \nanalysis, consistent with the discount rate used at appraisal. However, in sensitivity testing, the effect of the lower \n9.0% rate was examined given a lower rate now suggested in the latest guideline: ADB. 2017.  Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects. Manila. At a discount rate of 9.0%, the NPV is $45.7 million (TJS431.8 million) and \nthe EIRR is 22.7%. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fThe higher updated EIRR and NPV, despite the increased cost for the SEB construction, is largely \nthe  result  of  adjusting  the  calculation  of  agricultural  production  without  the  project.  This  was \noverestimated  at  project  appraisal.29 Based  on  the  sensitivity  analysis,  the  project  viability  is \nobserved to be most sensitive to benefits being delayed by 2 years, which causes the EIRR to \nreduce to 17.4%.  \n \n\n \n\nBy year 13 (2028), the project will result in an increase in net farm incomes from increased \nagricultural production of $207/ha (TJS1,952/ha) per annum, excluding returns to labor. Including \nreturns to labor (both farmers' own and hired labor) gives increased incomes in the project area \nof $291/ha (TJS2,743/ha) per annum. With an average farm size of 0.5 ha in the command area,  \na  farm  household  is  expected  to  receive  an  increase  in  income  of  $146/ha  (TJS1,372/ha)  per \nannum. This includes returns to labor and assuming only household family labor is used. Farmers \nwill also benefit from reduced costs and reduced time involved in sediment removal from on-farm \ncanals (although ALRI incurs most of these costs off-farm).30  \n \n\n \n\nThe project\u2019s financial sustainability remains a challenge since the project appraisal and \nthe government requires additional support to improve its capacity for the O&M cost recovery. \nFinancial analysis demonstrated that the government increased the collection rate from 62.6% in \n2015 to 88.7% in 2019. It also increased water tariffs, but these remain insufficient to financially \nsustain the project.  \n \n\n \n\nThe overall approach of ALRI\u2019s annual budget allocation for O&M and its computations \nrequire comprehensive review. The O&M balance sheet for the CIS is projected to be negative \nfrom 2020 to 2026 based on the results of the financial sustainability analysis. To achieve financial \nsustainability  with  the  project,  an  annual  allocation  of  $450,596  for  O&M  costs  and  a  15.7% \nincrease  in  the  ISF  will  be  required.  ADB  will  continue  to  support  the  government  to  address \nsector-specific financial sustainability issues. This will include capacity-building support in asset \nmanagement and calculating O&M budgets through a separate technical assistance (para. 12). \nADB will support the government to address systemic issues of debt management and improved \nallocation of O&M budget for irrigation and water resource infrastructure. The project covenants \nwill be strengthened to address the financial sustainability of the project by advancing the time \nframe for ALRI\u2019s delivery of the asset management and O&M plan to within 12 months from the \neffectiveness of the additional financing.31 \n \nC. \n \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\nThe  financial  management  assessment  noted  that  ALRI  and  the  PIG  have  suitable \ncapacity in project financial management, partially because of their prior experience and familiarity \nwith ADB\u2019s financial management requirements.32 The overall risk is considered moderate at the \n\n \n\n29 The  EIRR  at  appraisal  would  have  been  28%  if  agricultural  production  without  the  project  had  been  correctly \ncalculated. There were also other adjustments that needed to be made to the appraisal economic analysis model. \nThe most significant of these was to include returns for some new crops (potatoes, carrots, onions, fodder maize, \nsoya beans, and alfalfa) in the with-project scenario that were omitted from the appraisal analysis. \n\n30 Footnote 2, Preliminary Asset Management and Operation Plan of Chubek Irrigation System (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). The project implementation consultants for output 3 estimated that only 5% of \nsediment removal costs were incurred directly by the farmers for the removal of sediment from on-farm canals. About \n10% of sediment settles in fields and 90% in the canal system. \n\n31 This will require amending the terms of the original loan agreement. The amendment of the original loan agreement \nfor the purpose of reflecting the time frame for delivering the asset management and O&M plan will be processed in \nparallel with the proposed grant agreement. \n\n32 ALRI and the PIG obtained experience on financial management through recent ADB projects such as Grant 0352-\n\nTAJ: Building Climate Resilience in the Pyanj River Basin Project and the ongoing project.  \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fproject  level.  Because  of  its  small  budget  allocation,  ALRI  does  not  have  an  internal  audit \nrequirement under the government\u2019s regulations. It is subject to internal audit by the Ministry of \nFinance. The country\u2019s internal audit risk is considered substantial under the government\u2019s Public \nExpenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  report. 33  The  2018  external  audit  for  the  project \nproposed  recommendations  to  further  strengthen  internal  risk  mitigation  measures,  and  ALRI \nmanagement agreed to these recommendations. Combining country public financial management \nrisks and project risks, it is concluded that the overall pre-mitigation financial management risk is \nsubstantial. ALRI and the PIG have agreed to implement an action plan, which is detailed in the \nPAM (footnote 24). \n \n\n \n\nAccording to the procurement capacity assessment, ALRI and the PIG to have sufficient \ncapacity  in  project  procurement  management.  Considering  that  ALRI  and  the  PIG  staff  have \ndemonstrated strong capacity in procurement under the original project, their capacity does not \nappear to pose a substantial risk to efficient and effective project implementation. \n \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  ALRI.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 24). \n \nD. \n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \n\nPoverty.  The  second  additional  financing  will  contribute  to  addressing  low  agricultural \nyields, low income, and food insecurity in the target areas. This will be by reducing sediment inflow \nto  the  canal  system,  which  will  improve  O&M  of  the  CIS.  It  will  ensure  a  sufficient  supply  of \nirrigation water in the command area and improve agricultural productivity, thereby contributing \nto household incomes.  \n \n\n \n\nSocial and gender. The second additional financing is categorized as effective gender \nmainstreaming  as  it  will  continue  to  ensure  that  women  directly  benefit  from  the  project. \nComponents  include  (i)  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  PRB  Organization  and  PRB  Council \nmanagement  structures;  (ii)  increased  women  membership  in  WUAs;  (iii)  improved  women\u2019s \naccess  to  water  for  household  use;  and  (iv)  improved  women\u2019s  access to  training  on  weather \nforecasting, flood warnings, and preparedness. \n \nE. \n \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\nThe  second  additional  financing  is  classified  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  since  it  will  be  used  exclusively  to  bridge  cost  overruns \nwithin the existing project scale and scope. \n \nF. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.34 The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  of  the \nproject are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n \n\n33 Government of Tajikistan. 2017.

The  consultant  will  support  the  establishment  of  a  strong \ninternal audit system and build the capacity of the PIG, finance staff, and accounting \nstaff in financial project management and address audit recommendations. \nRequired O&M costs will be optimized by constructing the SEB under the additional \nfinancing.  Degraded  pumps and  motor  units  will be  replaced  with  energy-efficient \nmodels under the original project financing. The government agreed that ALRI will \nprepare and the government will approve a CIS asset management and O&M plan \nwith the support of the original project. Since 2015, the government has improved \nthe ISF collection rate from 62.6% to 88.7% and increased the water tariff. Although \nfinancial  sustainability,  ALRI  will  prepare  a \nthis \ncomprehensive  asset  management  and  O&M  plan  for  O&M  computations  and \nbudget allocations within 12 months from the effectiveness of the second additional \nfinancing.  The  asset  management  and  O&M  plan  will  include  components  to \nincrease ISFs and the budget allocation for O&M. This will substantially increase the \navailability  of  O&M  funds  and  support  full  cost-recovery  in  the  CIS  after \nmodernization  and  rehabilitation  works  have  been  completed.  The  main  system \noperators and WUAs will be trained in efficient CIS O&M under the original project. \nADB  will  also  support  the  government  to  address  systemic  issues  of  debt \nmanagement  and  budget  allocations  for  O&M.
