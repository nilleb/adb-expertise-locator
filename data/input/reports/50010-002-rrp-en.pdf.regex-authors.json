I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Shandong Spring City Green Modern Trolley Bus \nDemonstration Project.1 \n \n2.  Jinan, the capital of Shandong province, is one of the most congested and the ninth most \npolluted city in the PRC. The project is intended to improve accessibility and environmental \nquality, mitigate health impacts, and reduce the time and cost of travel for users through creation \nof a high-quality, zero-emissions bus rapid transit (BRT) network, complemented by policy \nmeasures  to  reduce  demand  for  travel  by  private  vehicles.  Building  the  infrastructure  for \nintegrated BRT routes and providing modern electric trolley buses will reduce pollution and traffic \ncongestion, increase public transport ridership, and improve the overall energy efficiency of the \ncity\u2019s transport system. The project will demonstrate how a large city developed with policies \noriented towards private vehicles can be converted to a city oriented towards public transport, \nand will change the direction of urban transport development to one that is more sustainable.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Strategic context. Cities in the PRC have achieved remarkable rates of urbanization, and \nurban transport has been vital to this development. However, rapid urbanization has also induced \nnew challenges including growing traffic congestion, worsening air quality that threatens public \nhealth, increasing greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, and more road \ncrashes. These challenges have serious implications for urban transport policy, but cities in the \nPRC  still  have  many  unexploited  opportunities  to  reduce  the  negative  impacts  of  these \nchallenges. Developing high-quality urban public transport in PRC cities is a trigger to change \nurban  transport  development  directions  from  options  that  favor  private  vehicles  to  more \nsustainable  urban  transport  and  nonmotorized  options  supported  by  integrated  multimodal \npassenger transport facilities and travel demand management (TDM) measures. \n \n4.  Urban transport in Jinan. As of 2016 Jinan had a population of 7.07 million and a fleet \nof 1.74 million private vehicles that is growing by 20% per year. 2 The city has grown physically \nby a factor of four from 2006 to 2016 with a high spatial concentration of traffic in the city center \nand growing travel demand from new outlying districts to the east and west. As in many PRC \ncities, traffic congestion and air pollution have worsened as urban development has progressed. \nJinan overtook Beijing as the most congested city in the PRC in the first quarter of 2016 and is \nthe ninth of the 10 most air polluted cities in the PRC overall, with transport contributing 15% of \nthe most harmful atmospheric particulate matter that has a diameter less than 2.5 micrometers.3 \n \n5.  The Jinan municipal government (JMG) owns the Jinan Public Transport Company (JPTC), \nwhich operates 5,345 buses serving 2.1 million passengers per day. Although the city is trying to \nretain its 18% public transport mode share with seven BRT routes, conventional bus services, \nand four trolley bus lines, the share is declining and the quality of the current system is not capable \nof reversing the trend. The city is developing three underground metro lines, but none can serve \nthe urban center because of restrictions to protect the city\u2019s many natural artesian springs. \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Jinan Statistics Bureau and Jinan Municipal Police data. \n3  Government of the PRC, Ministry of Environmental Protection. 2017. Air Quality Report. Beijing. ", "2 \n6.  Jinan is developing a low emission zone in the densest part of the city, roughly bounded \nby the moat and springs that historically protected the old city center, where centers of retail and \nother businesses, cultural and natural heritage, leisure, and government are situated closely \ntogether. The low emission zone will be supported by TDM measures including restrictions on \nprivate vehicles, parking management, and improved nonmotorized transport. These measures \ncombined will encourage the use of public transport and serve as a demonstration for the rest of \nthe metropolitan area for solving the city\u2019s accessibility and environmental problems. \n \n7.  A modern BRT system can greatly increase efficiency and level of service through \ndedicated lanes, signal prioritization, and reduced delays through external fare payment and \npassing lanes at median stations. Trolley bus systems are a sustainable option for urban public \ntransport  because  of  their  energy  efficiency  and  environmental  and  financial  advantages \ncompared to conventional buses and rail-based public transport. A trolley bus system integrated \nwith the BRT routes can provide high capacity and zero emission public transport for the central \narea where the underground metro cannot be built, and thus increase mode share. When the \nspeed and convenience of public transport are improved, and public transport is integrated with \nother modes, passenger demand can be expected to increase. \n \n8.  Urban transport strategy needed for Jinan. As Jinan has grown and established major \nnew residential and business districts to the east and west, travel demand has increased \ndramatically. However, the public transport system has not kept up with demand and mode share \nis decreasing, from 22.75% in 2011 to 18.4% in 2013, while ownership of private vehicles and \nelectric bikes is increasing. Because of increasing congestion, average speeds though the central \ncity have declined to 20.0 kilometers per hour (km/h) for cars and 13.8 km/h for buses. The JMG\u2019s \ntop urban transport priorities are the improvement of public transport quality, integration with other \nmodes, and supportive TDM to reduce congestion and achieve environmental sustainability. \n \n9.  The overall public transport policy is intended to ensure a fully integrated design and \noperation plan, including complementary TDM. By controlling parking through reformed policies, \nimproving enforcement, and increasing the rates for the most desirable areas in the central city, \nthe use of private vehicles is expected to decrease and the mode share for public transport to \nincrease.  A  cobenefit  of  better  parking  management  will  be  an  improved  environment  for \nnonmotorized transport, as illegally parked cars often block cycle lanes and footpaths. Introducing \nhigh-level technology for dispatching and efficiency management, real-time reporting from the \nvehicles, and real-time passenger information systems will attract passengers to public transport. \n \n10.  Value added by ADB assistance. The Sustainable Transport Initiative Operational Plan \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  prioritizes urban transport as one of its four priority pillars, \nwith a target of 30% of transport operations by 2020.4 ADB identified public sector champions in \nJinan who supported a major new initiative to increase public transport as the best solution to \nworsening congestion and pollution, and partnered with the Cities Development Initiative for Asia \nto design the network according to international best practices, including adoption of high-level \ntechnology for vehicles. In parallel, ADB is also implementing technical assistance financed by \nthe Global Environment Facility to develop guidance for vehicle selection and energy efficiency.5 \nThrough policy dialogue, partnerships, and expert analysis during project preparation, ADB has \nhelped the JMG find the most efficient solution to increasing public transportation for the largest \n                                                 \n4   ADB. 2010.

Link to country partnership and government strategy. The proposed project is aligned \nwith  the  Government  of  the  PRC\u2019s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan7 for  clean  and  low-carbon \ndevelopment,  and  with  the  ADB  country  partnership  strategy,  2016\u20132020  priorities  of \nenvironmental sustainability and inclusive and green cities development.8 The proposed project \nwill combat urban air pollution by promoting green transportation. It will also support ADB\u2019s \nstrategic priorities relevant to upper middle-income countries of mitigating climate change and \npromoting environmental sustainability.9 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  priority  development  of  public \ntransportation through bus rapid transit and nonmotorized transport to improve accessibility and \nservice for passengers and vulnerable groups.10 The project will have the following outcome: \ntraffic congestion and air pollution in Jinan reduced.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  Output 1: Zero-emission bus rapid transit network constructed. This output will \nestablish 111.2 km of prioritized high-quality BRT lanes served by electric trolley buses over \n39 routes,  93  new  and  65  upgraded  median  stations  with  real-time  passenger  information \nsystems, eight upgraded and eight new bus depots, and 36 new traction substations and power \nlines.  The  existing  control  center  will  be  upgraded  in  tandem  with  advanced  information \ntechnology on board the buses to provide real-time monitoring and dispatching to increase overall \noperational efficiency. Upgraded intersection designs will facilitate better nonmotorized transport. \n \n14.  Output 2: Modern trolley bus and service standards implemented. Updated and \nimproved trolley bus standards and service standards will be developed. The project will provide \n735 modern trolley buses equipped with advanced power storage technology and information \ntechnology systems for driving assistance and vehicle and power monitoring. \n \n15.  Output 3: Travel demand management measures for Jinan prepared. New TDM \nmeasures will target the mode shift from private vehicles to public transport. Measures include \nintegration of different modes including bicycles and electric bikes, bus services, urban rail and \nrailway stations, parking management, and a low-emission zone in the urban center. Capacity \nbuilding for their implementation will be conducted. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n16.

The JPTC will engage project implementation \nconsultants to support it during implementation and strengthen its financial management capacity \nby providing training, particularly on ADB guidelines and procedural requirements for safeguards \nmonitoring and financial management, reporting, and disbursement. \n \n23.  The project will be implemented over a 5-year period from January 2018 to December \n2022. All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). All consultant services will \nbe recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). Consulting services will be required for supervising construction and installing \ntrolley bus infrastructure. Advanced contracting and retroactive financing, which was initiated in \n2017, will be used for recruitment of project implementation consultants. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  A technical feasibility study was conducted on high-quality BRT routes including exclusive \nlanes and median stations, trolley bus infrastructure types and adoption of advanced technologies, \nlife cycle costs and technical capacity of the operation of the trolley bus system, and the overall \nsystem integration and TDM.13 \n \n25.  Network modeling showed that establishment of the planned BRT network, serviced by \nelectric trolley buses, would achieve significant traffic and environmental benefits. Ridership on \nthe BRT routes due to the expanded network, higher quality vehicles and stations, and increased \nspeeds would increase from 618,000 to 800,000 person-trips per day, or over one-third of all \npublic transport usage. Mode share for public transport would increase from 18% in 2016 to 25% \nin 2022 as 6% of private car users switch to public transport, and average BRT speeds through \nthe central city would increase from 13.8 km/h to 19.0 km/h. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  Economic and financial viability of the trolley bus system, incremental benefits of the BRT \nnetwork, and advanced trolley bus technologies were assessed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nguidelines.14 The project is economically viable with an estimated economic internal rate of return \nof 28.8%. Economic benefits of the project include lower vehicle operating costs, time savings, \nreduced carbon dioxide emissions, and avoided health impacts. A sensitivity analysis of potential \ncost overruns and benefit reductions demonstrates that the project\u2019s economic viability is robust. \nThe impact of TDM measures was not included in the estimate but would further increase these \nbenefits and increase the project\u2019s viability. The total cost of the proposed project would have to \nbe more than 51% higher than estimated for the economic internal rate of return to fall below the \nthreshold level of 9%. The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return is less sensitive to passenger \ntraffic projections. Time savings would have to decrease by about 58% to make the project \neconomically nonviable. Vehicle operating cost savings could fall by 91% and the project would \nstill be economically viable.15 \n \n                                                 \n13  Sector Assessment: Urban Transport (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila; ADB. 2009. Financial Due Diligence: a \nMethodology Note. Manila. \n15  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \n27.  A financial analysis has been undertaken for a revenue-generating project to determine if \nthe financial internal rate of return is greater than the weighted average cost of capital to determine \nthe financial viability of the project. Weighted average cost of capital is calculated based on \npercentage of debt and equity to total investment cost. The financial internal rate of return for the \nproject, computed after tax, is 3.38%, which compares favorably with the estimated 2.10% \nweighted average cost of capital. The sensitivity of the financial internal rate of return to adverse \nchanges  in  the  underlying  assumptions  was  also  assessed  and  the  project  is  considered \nfinancially viable. Sensitivity testing shows these results to be relatively less sensitive to increased \ncapital costs but more sensitive to increased operating costs and decreased revenues. \n \n28.  As the implementing agency, the JPTC will be responsible for operating the project, \nproviding counterpart funding, and servicing domestic debt. The JPTC is a large-scale state-\nowned public service enterprise with social obligations to keep fares low. Consequently, its \nrevenues do not cover operating costs in most years and it is reliant on government subsidies \nprovided by the JMG in lieu of increases in fares. However, the JMG\u2019s projected fiscal sources \nduring the project implementation period and the debt service period are stable and sufficient to \ncover total project financial obligations, and the project itself will improve the financial performance \nof the JPTC as ridership increases. The JMG and JPTC will conduct a review of fares and \nrecommend necessary adjustments to ensure sustainability of the BRT and trolley bus system. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n29.  Financial management. The financial management policy and capacity of both the JMG \nand JPTC to implement the project were assessed in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines.16 The \nfinancial  management  assessment  concluded  that  capacity  is  adequate  and  financial \nmanagement risk is moderate before mitigation measures, because the funds-flow arrangements, \nstaffing, accounting and financial reporting systems, financial information systems, and internal \nand external auditing arrangements of JMG and JPTC are acceptable. The JPTC has no prior \nexperience in implementing ADB projects or ADB procurement, disbursement, and financial \nmanagement procedures. The JPTC will strengthen its capacity by undertaking training on ADB \nguidelines  and  procedural  requirements  for  financial  management,  including  reporting  and \ndisbursement. Detailed requirements on financial management are in the PAM (footnote 11). \n \n30.  Procurement and anticorruption. An assessment of project procurement risk subject to \nprocurement capacity of the implementing agency was conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nguidelines.17 It is concluded that procurement risk of the project as moderate before mitigation \nmeasures. All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the \nJMG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM \n(footnote  11).  The  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  will  be  included  in  all \nprocurement documents and contracts. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n31.  A social, poverty, and gender assessment was undertaken in accordance with ADB \nguidelines to assess the transport and economic development needs of affected people; make \nthe project more pro-poor, socially inclusive, and sustainable; and formulate measures related to \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2005.

The transport \nneeds of the population along the proposed BRT corridor include mitigating traffic congestion and \nimproving traffic efficiency and safety, reducing travel time, and improving public transit facilities. \nThe BRT network will directly benefit 804,000 passengers daily in the first year of full operations. \nIt will directly or indirectly benefit about 1.7 million residents in five administrative districts around \nthe BRT network. The project will directly create 1,500 job opportunities during the construction \nperiod and 2,218 during the operation period. Indirectly, the project will promote business, \nemployment, and real estate development along the network. Additional direct social benefits of \nthe project will be improved quality of public transport service and customer satisfaction, and \ncapacity building of the executing and implementing agencies and design institutes in social \naspects. Bus fares are CNY1.0 for buses without air conditioning and CNY2.0 for buses with air \nconditioning. Fare concessions are provided to students, the elderly, and the disabled. The \naverage monthly cost of public transport is 1.0% of average monthly income, which is affordable, \nand 82.2% expressed their satisfaction with current fares. If fares are to be adjusted, the JMG \nand JPTC will hold a public hearing for comments from residents. The JPTC will ensure that \ncontractors  disseminate  information  on  HIV/AIDS  and  other  communicable  diseases  in \nconstruction sites for all new employees at the time of mobilization. The local center for disease \ncontrol will disseminate similar information to local communities in the project area. \n \n32.  To  maximize  positive  gender  impacts,  the  project  is  designed  for  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. Women have transport needs arising from their various social roles, mobility \npatterns, and responsibilities that often combine household work with travel to employment, \nmarkets, and social service centers such as schools and hospitals. Survey results show that about \n50.0% of women use public transport as their main mode of transportation, while 16.1% rely on \nwalking, 13.0% on private car, and 10.0% on motorcycle. Women also have personal concerns \nabout road safety. These considerations have important implications for the physical design and \noperation of public transport systems, so the project incorporates distinct gender-sensitive design \nfeatures to enhance women\u2019s inclusion and participation and ensure that women benefit from a \nBRT system that is safe, fast, and convenient. Other measures include the following targets for \nwomen\u2019s participation: (i) 20% of project generated unskilled jobs; (ii) 25% of BRT drivers, 45% \nof administration staff, and 85% of ticketing staff; (iii) at least 40% participation in road safety \nawareness raising activities, participation in travel modal shift activities awareness measures, and \npublic consultation; and (iv) gender-sensitive institutional strengthening and capacity building.18 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n33.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.19 \n \n34.  Environment (category B). The project is classified category B for environment. The \ninitial environmental examination complies with ADB\u2019s policies and requirements, including ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009), and identifies potential adverse impacts. The examination \nconcludes that those impacts can be mitigated through the implementation of the environmental \nmanagement  plan,  which  specifies  mitigation  measures,  monitoring  requirements,  and \ninstitutional  responsibilities  for  ensuring  proper  environmental  management  throughout  the \nproject\u2019s construction and operation. Meaningful public consultation was done in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and environment safeguard documents were disclosed to the \naffected people. Potential environmental complaints or disputes will be handled in accordance \n                                                 \n18  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19  ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "9 \nwith the grievance redress mechanism established for the project. The JMG and JPTC will \nmanage the identified environmental risks and have agreed to appropriate loan covenants and \ntraining. The initial environmental examination was posted on the ADB website on 7 June 2017. \n \n35.  Environmental  benefits  and  risks.  The  project  will  result  in  significant  long-term \nreductions in transport sector emissions and greenhouse gases, and increased benefits for \nhuman health and well-being compared to the without-project scenario because of zero-emission \nelectric buses, reduced numbers of commuters in private cars, and improved traffic flow. By 2043, \ntotal emission reductions related to urban transportation are predicted to be as follows:  carbon \nmonoxide 53,554 tons, nitrogen oxides 5,830 tons, hydrocarbon 3,157 tons, particulate matter \n169 tons, and carbon dioxide 5.2 million tons. A climate risk assessment concludes that climate \nrisk is high, and the most significant risk to the project areas and their vicinities relates to flood. \nSince the last flood event in 2015, the JMG has made significant efforts to improve drainage \nsystems in various parts of Jinan for better flood control. Engineering designs have been modified \nfor  elevated  trolley  bus  stations  and  bus  depots  with  sufficient  drainage,  accounting  for \n$3.15 million of ADB financing for adaptation. As an urban mass transit project targeting mode \nshift, $107.44 million of ADB financing is counted as mitigation finance. \n \n36.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  project  is  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement. A total of 24.6 mu of rural collective land will be acquired for the construction of the \nHanyu depot, affecting four households with 13 persons.20 Nine bus depots will be built or \nupgraded on the existing depots owned by the JPTC and will not involve any resettlement, while \n161.1 mu of state-owned land requires land use certificates with payment for six bus depots. A \ntotal of 4.3 mu of land will be occupied permanently for 36 traction substations within the existing \nlandscaped area or vacant state-owned land and will not involve any resettlement. The temporary \nland occupation area of the project will be within the permanent land acquisition or occupation \narea.  A  draft  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement. This will be finalized in line with the detailed engineering design and submitted to ADB \nfor approval prior to the award of civil works contracts. The total cost of land acquisition and \nresettlement is CNY5.79 million, or 0.2% of the total project cost. The executing agency has \nassured ADB that adequate counterpart funding will be made available for land acquisition and \nresettlement, in line with the annual funding requirements stipulated in the resettlement plan. A \nconsultant will be engaged to support the executing agency in effectively implementing the \nresettlement plan. The project management office staff will coordinate internal supervision and \nreporting of resettlement plan implementation with relevant local government agencies. The \nexecuting agency will engage an external institute for semiannual monitoring and reporting. Public \nconsultations were undertaken during project preparation and will continue throughout the project \ncycle as per the public consultation schedule prepared under the resettlement plan. The draft and \nfinal resettlement plans will be uploaded on the ADB website and disclosed to affected people. A \ngrievance redress mechanism has been established to address affected people\u2019s concerns.21 \n \n37.  Indigenous peoples (category C). There are no ethnic minority communities that will be \nadversely affected by the project. The project is category C for indigenous peoples. \n \n   \n                                                 \n20 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.7 square meters). \n21 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n38.  The overall risk is assessed to be low. The unified benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh the costs of mitigation. Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in \nTable 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.22 The project \ndesign and implementation measures are considered adequate to address the identified risks. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nRidership may be lower than forecast,  Projections are conservative and rely on about one-third of \nresulting in decreased benefits and  public transport demand on the highest density corridors. \nrevenues   Expansion of BRT routes and trolley buses is planned in \nphases that can be adjusted.  \nProcurement and implementation  Training will be provided on ADB financial management and \ncapacity may cause delays  procurement requirements.
