The focus \nwill be on improvements to the administration of the real property tax (RPT) and on management \nreforms. In particular, the project will (i) support institutional development and policy formulation \nfor property valuation, (ii) implement a property tax valuation database and information systems, \n(iii)  enhance  the  RPT  administration  for  selected  local  government  units  (LGUs),  and \n(iv) professionalize  local  assessors  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  LGUs.  The  project \ncomplements the programmatic approach of the Local Governance Reform Program, which was \napproved in November 2019.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDevelopment challenges. Strong economic growth in the Philippines has yet to deliver \nequitable  benefits  to  its  citizens.  From  2011  to  2019,  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  on \naverage at 6.2% per year, higher than the Association of Southeast Asian Nations\u2019 median GDP \ngrowth rate  of  5.7%  for 2018.2  However,  this  growth  did  not result  in  a  significant reduction  of \nlong-standing  disparities  in  the  Philippines.  The  country's  income  inequality  exceeds  that  of \nregional peers, and national averages mask significant regional variation.3 The national poverty \nincidence fell from 26.6% in 2006 to 16.6% in 2018 but remains among the highest in Southeast \nAsia.  The  poverty  incidence  is  rising  in  parts  of  eastern  Visayas  and  in southern  and  western \nMindanao;  in these areas, the  poverty  incidence  can  exceed  30.0%.  Women  are especially  at \nrisk;  poverty  incidence  among  women  in  the  former  Autonomous  Region  in  Muslim  Mindanao \nreached  55.1%  in  2017.4  The  country\u2019s  geographic  diversity  also creates unique  development \nchallenges,  and  service  delivery  costs  can  be  extremely  high  in  many  remote  parts.  Local \ngovernments  can  help  reduce  such  disparities  and  create  opportunities  for  economic \ndevelopment,  but  accountable  service  delivery  depends  on  well-calibrated  intergovernmental \nrelations and appropriate resourcing in line with local governments\u2019 roles and responsibilities. \n \n4. \nImpact  of  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic.  COVID-19  is  exacting  a \nheavy toll on the Philippines with the economy expected to contract by 1% or more in 2020, and \nthe potential for a sharp increase in both poverty and unemployment. Fiscal pressures are also \nincreasing  as  pandemic  response  requirements  result  in  new  expenditures,  and  revenues  are \nsqueezed  due  to  reduced  trade,  investment,  and  economic  activity.  These  factors  add  new \nurgency to the domestic resource mobilization agenda. Local government revenue mobilization \nwill  be  necessary  to  support  critical  relief  activities  and  to  provide  local  governments  with  the \nnecessary resources for economic recovery. Land and property values are relatively inelastic and \nare likely to be less affected by the pandemic than other revenue sources. As a result, COVID-19 \nmay have a positive effect on incentives for property tax reform, as revenue needs mount and \nother revenue sources such as income and consumption tax are compressed, encouraging both \ncentral and local governments to pursue property tax reforms.  \n\n \n\n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2019.

Compared  with  regional  peers,  the  Philippines  is  significantly \n5. \ndecentralized in administrative and political dimensions.5 Local government is broadly divided into \nthree levels: provinces and independent cities, municipalities, and barangays. As of 31 December \n2019,  the  country  had  81  provinces,  145  cities,  1,488  municipalities,  and  42,045  barangays.6 \nHowever,  fiscal  matters  are  relatively  less  decentralized,  especially  when  it  comes  to  revenue \nmobilization. About 29% of LGU revenue is from local own sources (raised by local governments \nthemselves), the rest comes from central transfers; this compares with an average of more than \n40% own-source revenues (OSR) raised by local governments in industrial economies.7 In most \ndecentralized systems, land and property taxes typically represent an important source of revenue \nfor  local  governments;  however,  in  the  Philippines,  the  property  tax  administered  by  local \ngovernments accounted for only 28% of all local OSR (or 9% of total revenues), compared with \n44% from business tax and 28% from nontax revenues.8 \n \n6. \nProperty tax. Property tax collection in the Philippines is low for several reasons. RPT is \nimposed on land and structures based on the assessed value of the property, and LGUs exercise \nsignificant  control  over  the  setting  of  rate  and  assessment  levels.  However,  political  and \ninstitutional  challenges  create  conflicting  incentives  for  local  officials,  which  prevent  revenue \noptimization. The schedule of market values (SMV), which is the basis for property assessments, \nis heavily influenced by local electoral politics, which discourages regular updates. True market \nvalues are shown to be 2 to 75 times higher than assessed values.9 The politicization of the SMV \nalso  creates  an  opening  for  rent  seeking:  the  decision  to  update  the  SMV  is  timed  to  the \npreference  of  decision  makers,  in  consideration  of  taxpayers,  or  to  attract  investments  on  the \nbasis of lower property taxes. This causes inconsistencies between property valuations by LGUs \nand the Bureau of Internal Revenue on which capital gains taxes from the sale of a property are \ncalculated and collected. Although national valuation standards and methods are improving, weak \ncapacity of local valuation staff results in inconsistent valuation systems. Coupled with poor record \nkeeping  and  outdated  reporting  systems,  real  property  values  are  distorted.  Moreover,  RPTs \ncollected as a percentage of GDP declined from 0.45% in 2004 to 0.35% in 2016. Acknowledging \nthese valuation constraints, the Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF) estimates that in \nthe same period, provinces and municipalities missed collecting \u20b19.4 billion10 in forgone property \ntax revenues, while cities could have collected an additional \u20b120.3 billion. \n \nReform measures. The government has embarked on various reforms to strengthen local \n7. \ngovernance  and  mobilize  local  revenues,  submitting  to  Congress  several  amendments  to  the \nLocal Government Code with the intention of updating the legal framework for local governance. \nThe  amendments  cover  revenue  provisions,  such  as  aligning  business  tax  collection  with  the \ngeographic area in which the business activities take place, harmonizing fees and fines across \nLGUs to reduce uncertainty for investors, and increasing local autonomy in the use of revenues \nfrom natural resources (footnote 1). The government also proposed a new real property valuation \nand  assessment  reform  act  (RPVARA)  to  Congress.  If  passed,  a  single  valuation  base  would \napply to all property taxation purposes of national and local governments; reviews of compliance \nwith valuation standards would be compulsory; and the approval of the SMV would be handled \ncentrally again by the Department of Finance (DOF) to ensure valuation of real property is not \n\n \n\n5  M.

The DOF will prescribe valuation standards, build capacity of local appraisers \nand assessors, and develop an up-to-date property information system consisting of an electronic \ndatabase of real property transactions from the LGUs and other stakeholders such as the private \nsector.  The  proposed  law  will  also make  LGUs  ineligible for  conditional or  performance-based \ngrants  and  prevent  them  from  accessing  credit  financing  if  they  do  not  update  their  SMVs \nregularly. Under this proposed legislation, the government estimates that RPT revenues would \nincrease  by  \u20b112.6  billion  ($252  million),  including  \u20b13.7  billion  ($74  million)  for  provinces  and \nmunicipalities and \u20b18.9 billion ($178 million) for cities. Additional measures to improve collection \nefficiency under the RPVARA are expected to add around \u20b130 billion ($600 million) in local tax \ncollections.11 \n \n8. \nBinding constraints. In reforming the administration of the RPT, the government faces \nthree primary constraints. First, the Philippines does not have a structured and institutionalized \nmechanism  or  body  to  implement  and  sustain  real  property  valuation  reforms.  The  many \ninstitutions  and  agencies  involved  in  land  management  and  taxation  have  overlapping  and \nsometimes conflicting roles and mandates. The legal framework for land management is complex, \nand  no  duly  organized  and  recognized  national  appraisal  service  exists.  Complex  revenue \nmobilization  reforms  typically  require  multiple  years  of  commitment.  The  absence  of  an \nestablished body that can sustain the reform momentum raises the risk of incomplete or ad hoc \nreform implementation. Likewise, international standards and methods for property valuation exist \nand  continue  to  evolve,  but  the  absence  of  an  institutionalized  body  of  practitioners  in  the \nPhilippines  forestalls  the  opportunity  to  transfer  this  knowledge  to  a  professional  cadre  of \nassessors.  The  result  is  a  significant  variation  in  the  approach  and  methodology  of  property \nvaluation across the Philippines, increased administrative costs, and lower tax compliance. \n \n9. \nSecond,  the  Philippines  does  not  have  a  consistent,  reliable  property  information  and \nvaluation database for record keeping of the true market value of land. Multiple central and local \nagencies  have  fragmented  responsibilities  for  different  dimensions  of  land  management  and \nrecord keeping. While some LGUs have developed individual property information and valuation \ndata  systems,  these  are  ad  hoc,  and  the  quality  varies  significantly  across  LGUs.  Individual \nsystems may use different protocols, classifications, and data formats, compromising the ability \nof central oversight agencies to obtain a consistent set of data on property values. Some LGUs \nalso  rely  on  private  sector  actors  to  prepare  and  maintain  property  valuation  information.  This \ntends to result in inconsistent valuations prepared by different government agencies and private \nentities  and  reflecting  varying  values  for  similarly  located  and  comparable  properties.  In  the \nabsence of a unified data standard and policy for data sharing, administrators of property taxes \nface serious difficulties in establishing an integrated information technology tax system and linking \ninformation from different government agencies and the private sector. \n \n10. \nThird, property taxation is fraught with political, institutional, and administrative challenges. \nTax reforms are often complex undertakings; national reforms which are to be implemented by a \nlarge  number  of  local  government  stakeholders  are  even  more  so.  Past  efforts  to  increase \nproperty  tax  collections  have  been  stymied  by  the  absence  of  a  well-articulated  strategy  to \naddress  these  challenges,  particularly  incentive  and  accountability  mechanisms  which  will \nsupport consistent reform implementation across diverse localities. For reform measures to be \nsuccessful, an appropriate balance of autonomy and accountability is needed in order to influence \nproperty tax policy and its administration. The mobilization of property tax revenue must be linked \nto improved levels of responsive, efficient, and accountable service delivery. \n \n\n11 BLGF calculations, June 2019. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nGovernment  strategy.  The  government  has  a  renewed  focus  on  the  role  of  local \n11. \ngovernments  in  delivering  quality  services  and  promoting  local  economic  development.  The \nPhilippine  Development  Plan,  2017\u20132022  underscores  the  importance  of  local  government  in \npromoting local investment, social protection, and other service delivery.12 The government also \nmade land management reform a part of its priority agenda for economic development, including \nensuring the security of land titling to encourage investments, and addressing bottlenecks in land \nadministration and titling agencies.13 The Department of Environment and Natural Resources in \nparticular  is  pursuing  updates  to  the  Land  Sector  Development  Framework  (2010\u20132030)  with \nsupport  from  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization.14  Under  the  pillar  of  \u201cEnsuring  Sound \nMacroeconomic Policy,\u201d the Philippine Development Plan targets an increase in local sources of \nLGU revenue (footnote 12). Local revenue mobilization is prioritized in both revisions to the Local \nGovernment Code of 1991 and the proposed RPVARA (para. 6). \n \n12. \nBank (ADB).15 Table 1 shows the specific links with the operational priorities of Strategy 2030. \n \n\nStrategic alignment.

ADB  plays  a  leading  role  in  local  governance  in  the \nPhilippines  and  coordinates  support  with  other  development  partners  so  that  efforts  are  \nwell-aligned and complementary to the government\u2019s overall agenda. ADB meets regularly with \nthe United States Agency for International Development on local infrastructure development and \nregional assistance to Mindanao. ADB is also coordinating closely with the Japan International \nCooperation  Agency  on  advisory  services  and  capacity  building  for  the  newly  established \nBangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. ADB coordinates with the World Bank on \npublic financial management reforms, particularly the links between national efforts (supported by \nthe World Bank) and subnational efforts (supported by the ADB), as well as on revenue reforms. \nADB has worked on local governance issues with Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (French \nDevelopment Agency), which also provided technical assistance to the government, including a \nstudy on the French approach to inter-LGU service delivery coordination. \n \nB. \n \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: efficient, effective, and equitable public \n14. \nservice  delivery  enhanced  (footnote  12).

The project will support policy formulation and institutional development within the \nBLGF to implement fair, efficient, and effective property valuation. The activities under this output \ninclude: (i) the establishment and operationalization of the real property valuation service (RPVS) \nwithin the BLGF to strengthen property valuation, institutionalize good international practices on \nvaluation, and support the operational work of other BLGF divisions; (ii) policy formulation and \nimplementation  support  for  real  property  taxation,  focusing  on  the  gender  and  development \ndimensions of tax administration and compliance management; (iii) formulation and dissemination \nof  operating  manuals  and  procedures  aligned  with  international  standards  on  valuation; \n(iv) comprehensive nationwide  rollout  of  training  for  central  government  agencies and  regional \nBLGF  offices;  and  (v)  formulation  of  policies  and  processes  for  compliance  monitoring  on \nvaluation  standards  for  public  and  private  real  property.  Previous  ADB  experience  on  land \nadministration reform has shown that stakeholder consultation is critical. To build a constituency \nfor  reform,  this  output  will  also  cover  consultations  with  national  oversight  and  implementing \nagencies, such as the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, LGUs, and the private \nsector, including female property owners and the Philippine Commission on Women. \n \n16. \nOutput 2: Property tax valuation database and information systems implemented. \nThis  output  will  result  in  more  accurate  and  timely  real  property  valuation  data  and  greater \ntransparency  and accountability  in the reporting of real  property-related  transactions.  Activities \ninclude: (i) development, operationalization, and nationwide rollout of a real property information \nsystem and of an electronic field appraisal and assessment sheet for maintaining property data \nand  computing  real  property  valuations;  (ii)  development  and  operationalization  of  a \ncomprehensive electronic property tax billing and payment system; (iii) rollout of the electronic \nproperty  tax  billing  and  payment  system  in  selected  municipalities;  (iv)  development  and \noperationalization  of  an  online  portal  for  public  access  to  the  SMV,  local  tax  codes,  local \ninvestment  and  incentives  code,  ecozone  information,  and  LGU  performance  in  property  tax \ncollection;  (v)  development  and  implementation  of  institutional  mechanisms  for  data  and \ninformation exchange between public and private sector stakeholders; and (vi) development of a \ncomputer-assisted  mass  appraisal  system  and  its  rollout  to  selected  cities,  integrated  with \ngeographic information system technologies. These activities will be coordinated closely with the \nBureau of Internal Revenue, DOF, Department of Information and Communications Technology, \nDepartment  of  the  Interior  and  Local  Government,  private  sector,  civil  society,  and  women\u2019s \ngroups.  The  proposed  database  and  information  systems  will  enable  the  collection  of  \nsex-disaggregated data to ascertain women\u2019s contributions to LGU revenues. \n \nOutput 3: Real property taxation of selected LGUs enhanced. Newly created cities, \n17. \nmunicipalities, and provinces exhibit a particularly high dependence on fiscal transfers from the \ncentral  government.  The  project  will  provide  targeted  assistance  to  selected  LGUs  to  help \ndecrease this dependence. Activities include: (i) technical support, coaching, and mentoring on \nSMV updates and on a general revision of assessments and property classification, with specific \ntargets for participation across different sectors; (ii) updates of tax maps and related tax records; \n(iii)  more  in-depth  assistance  with  the  adoption  of  integrated  electronic  systems  for  tax \nassessment and collection; (iv) more in-depth assistance with the preparation of tax and revenue \nimpact studies incorporating gender and development perspectives; (v) tax compliance reviews \n\n16 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fto  improve  the  collection  of  property  taxes;  and  (vi)  strengthening  of  compliance  management \npractices,  e.g.,  by  conducting  taxpayer  registration  drives  and  updating  taxpayers\u2019  registries.17 \nWhile the property maps generated will be used primarily for tax purposes, they can be combined \nwith  other  information  systems  to  conduct  asset  valuations  for  disaster  risk  financing  and \ninsurance under other government programs. \n \n18. \nOutput  4:  Local  assessors  professionalized  and  capacity  of  LGUs  strengthened. \nThe project will focus on developing and sustaining a professional cadre of assessors to meet \npublic  and  private  sector  needs.  The  output  is  also  aligned  with  efforts  under  the  Real  Estate \nService Act, 2009 for professional assessment and valuations services in coordination with state \nuniversities  and  colleges,  the  Professional  Regulation  Commission,  and  the  Commission  on \nHigher  Education.  Activities  include:  (i)  conducting  a  diagnostic  study  and  mapping  the  core \ncompetencies for local assessors and appraisers; (ii) developing expanded academic and training \ncourse curricula and performance assessment programs with training manuals, through a partner \nstate university or college and a training institution; (iii) developing and implementing an e-learning \nplatform  for  assessing  appraisers  and  assessors;  (iv)  rolling  out  provincial,  city,  and  municipal \ntraining for local assessors; and (v) reviewing and harmonizing inconsistent government policies \nrelated  to  academic  programs  and  capacity  building  for  property  valuation.  The  BLGF  will \ncoordinate closely with academic institutions that offer training in valuation, assessment, and local \nadministration  to  deliver  this  output.  The  BLGF  will  also  initiate  a  capacity  development \narrangement with an international academic and training institution, and participate in selected \ninternational training events, seminars, conferences, and technical exchange programs to further \nadvance and promote property valuation practices in the country. \n \nC. \n \n19. \nThe  project  complements  a  broader  program  of  ADB  support  for  local  economic \ndevelopment  in  the  Philippines.  Specifically,  the  project  supports  implementation  of  the  Local \nGovernance Reform Program, a policy-based loan approved in November 2019 that targets policy \nreforms  to  strengthen  the  legal  and  institutional  basis  for  local  governance  in  the  Philippines, \nmodernize local public financial management, and strengthen local economic development and \nfinancing  options  (footnote  1).  While  the  policy-based  loan  supports  the  legal  and  institutional \nframework  for  local  revenue  mobilization,  the  proposed  project  will  support  national  and  local \ngovernment  implementation  of  the  policy  changes.  ADB  also  provided  significant  technical \nassistance to support the preparation of the project, the preparation of the RPVARA, a review of \nlocal government systems for the electronic monitoring of revenue and expenditure, and policy \nadvisory services for project design. The project is especially critical in the context of the COVID-\n19 pandemic and the urgent need to mobilize resources and support economic recovery for LGUs. \n \nD. \n \n20. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $31.49  million  (Table  2).  Detailed  cost  estimates  by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).18 \n \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n \n\n17 The  proposed  project  draws  on  technical  assistance  provided  by  ADB  in  2011  for  local  government  revenue \ngeneration and land administration reforms, which showed the need for a demand-driven approach and for local and \nnational  governments  working  in  partnership  to  sustain  reforms.  The  project  tackles  the  problems  previously \nencountered with small-scale or short-lived support for land and property tax reforms by scaling up resources and \ninstitutionalizing  reform  mechanisms  for  the  future.

Benefits accrue from: \n(i)  an  increase  in  LGU  spending  to  produce  economic  benefits  from  investments  and  service \ndelivery; (ii) better quality of local spending through local taxation alignment with local needs and \npreferences; (iii) reduced reliance on distortionary nontax revenues, including fees and fines; and \n(iv) more efficient allocation of capital and development of unused land. The economic analysis \nestimated potential net economic benefits of the project under various assumptions of efficiency \ngains expected through the listed channels. Using conservative estimates of 2% efficiency gains, \nthe economic analysis estimates the project\u2019s potential net economic benefits at $400 million.19 \n \nB. \n \nThe project will institutionalize mechanisms to support professional real property valuation \n25. \nand  assessment  functions  in  the  Philippines.  In  doing  so,  the  project  will  help  ensure  that \ninternational good practice on property tax administration and property valuation is absorbed and \nsustained over the long term. Investments in digital systems will help the government establish \nand sustain a historical record of land and property values using modern and consistent valuation \n\nSustainability \n\n19 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nGovernance \n\nstandards. Partnerships with local academic institutions and training facilities will help ensure that \ncompetency frameworks, curricula, and course materials for local assessors can be delivered on \nan ongoing basis, resulting in a sustainable cadre of professional assessors for the public and \nprivate sectors. The project also supports the implementation of the RPVARA, which will underpin \nthe sustainability of reforms. While the project team envisages significant consulting services, the \ngovernment plans to absorb mission-critical personnel under the operating budget for the RPVS \nsubject to satisfactory performance and relevance. The additional tax revenues collected and the \ngovernment budget for the RPVS will more than cover the cost of servicing the project loan, the \nprincipal repayment, and operations; as such, the project is considered financially viable. \n \nC. \n \nThe  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  conducted  during  October\u2013November \n26. \n2018  followed  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  and \nFinancial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note.20 Based on the FMA, the pre-mitigation financial \nmanagement risk is substantial. The key financial management risks are (i) the BLGF\u2019s financial \nmanagement  division  has  staffing  shortcomings,  (ii)  the  BLGF\u2019s  fixed  asset  registry  requires \nstrengthening,  (iii)  the  BLGF  is  not  subject  to  internal  audit,  and  (iv) financial  reporting  can  be \ndelayed due to the absence of computerized budgeting and bookkeeping systems. However, the \nFMA  found  the  BLGF\u2019s  capacity  to  administer  advance  fund  and  statement  of  expenditures \nprocedures to be adequate. The risks will be managed by establishing a project management unit \nto undertake regular financial management responsibilities. The BLGF also agreed to implement \nan action plan to rectify the deficiencies. The FMA and the related action plan are discussed in \ndetail in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  and  the  BLGF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \nD. \n \n28. \nReforms under the project will help the government achieve its poverty reduction targets \nby  expanding  the  quality  and  range  of  public  services  available  to  the  poor,  and  by  providing \nopportunities  for  local  economic  development.  Local  revenue  mobilization  increases  the \nresources  available  to  LGUs  for  delivering  public  services  to  poor  and  marginalized  groups. \nReducing LGUs\u2019 reliance on transfers from the central government will improve the quality of local \nspending, as LGUs must balance its spending against taxation. The project is categorized some \ngender  elements.  Improvements  in  the  tax  administration  and  a  reduction  in  the  compliance \nburden  will  specifically  benefit  women  entrepreneurs  and  owners  of  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises, who are least able to bear the costs of cumbersome tax administration. The project \nalso  has  built-in  monitoring  for  sex-disaggregated  data.  Planned  tax  compliance  and  impact \nstudies will incorporate an explicit gender dimension to understand how the RPT affects different \ntaxpayers,  including  women  and  other  marginalized  groups.  Finally,  ADB  will  recruit  a  gender \nconsultant to strengthen the project\u2019s gender dimensions. \n \nE. \n \n29. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \ncategories  are  as  follows:  category  C  for  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nSafeguards \n\n20 ADB. 2005.
