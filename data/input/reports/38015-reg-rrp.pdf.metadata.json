The  Sustainable  Tourism  Development  Project  (the \nProject)  will  not  have  significant  adverse  environmental  effects. \nInitial  environmental  examinations  were  prepared  for  (i)  each  of \nthe  subprojects  identified  under  component  1  for  each  country \nand  (ii)  likely  interventions  to  be  identified  under  components  2 \nand  3.    Environmental  assessment  and  review  frameworks  were \nprepared for each country.  \n \nThe Project will support the development of tourism in the Greater \nMekong  Subregion  (GMS)  that  is  economically  viable  and \nenvironmentally  and  socially  sustainable  and  that  benefits  the \npoor.  It  will  develop  demonstration  subprojects  in  the  Lao  PDR \nand Viet Nam that improve the environment at urban and natural \ntourism  sites,  benefit  ethnic  groups/minorities  and  the  poor,  and \nprotect  vulnerable  people  from  potential  negative  impacts.  The \nProject will contribute to transforming GMS transport corridors into \neconomic corridors by developing tourism opportunities along the \nroads  and  improving  the  human  resource  capacity  of  tourism \nsmall  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  and  public  sector \ntourism  organizations.  It  will  contribute  to  more  inclusive  growth, \nenvironmental  sustainability,  and  regional  cooperation  in  the \nGMS.  The  Project  will  include  the  construction  of  handicraft \nmarkets,  viewing  points,  small  access  roads,  walking  trails, \ntourism  signage,  information  and  visitor  centers,  parking  areas, \nsmall  river  piers,  community  lodges,  and  protective  and  sanitary \nfacilities.  It  will  formulate  plans  for  tourism  site  development  and \nmanagement,  provide  training  for  local  communities  and  private \ntourism  operators,  develop  marketing  strategies  and  products, \nand compose subregional tourism manuals. The Project will seek \nto  strengthen  and  encourage  fair  partnerships  among  local \nin \ngovernments  and  communities  and \ndeveloping,  operating,  and  maintaining  community \ntourism \nfacilities and services. \n \n\nthe  private  sector \n\n \n\n\fii \n\nRationale \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n \n\nthe \n\nthese \n\nissues \n\nthreaten \n\nTourism is an important sector in the GMS whose contribution to \nthe  subregional  economy  has  increased  significantly  in  the  past \ndecade,  creating  new  opportunities  for  economic  growth  and \npoverty  reduction.  However,  unmanaged  and  rapid  tourism \ngrowth has resulted in a pattern of tourism that concentrates on a \nfew  destinations;  threatens  natural,  cultural,  and  urban  heritage; \nand  contributes  to  undesirable  social  impacts.  New  opportunities \nprovided  by  the  development  of  transportation  corridors  are  not \nbeing utilized, and the capacity of tourism SMEs to service tourist \nneeds, and of the public sector to sustainably manage growth, are \nweak. As a result, the contribution of tourism to poverty reduction \nand  sustainable,  inclusive  development  in  the  GMS  is  limited. \nlong-term \nUnless  addressed, \nsustainability  of  the  sector  and  its  ability  to  contribute  to \nsubregional development. \n \nThe  GMS  Tourism  Sector  Strategy  (GMS-TSS)  2006\u20132015, \nprepared  by  the  GMS  Tourism  Working  Group,  indicates  the \nurgent need to design effective approaches to the sustainable use \nand  development  of  natural,  cultural,  and  urban  tourism  assets; \nspread the benefits of tourism more widely, especially to the poor; \ntap the tourism potential of the GMS transport corridors; and build \nthe capacities of private tourism SMEs and public officials. If well \nmanaged,  tourism  can  be  a  powerful  tool  to  preserve  and \nenhance  natural  and  cultural  heritage  and  provide  additional \nsources of livelihood in the remote rural areas of the GMS where \nmost of the poor live. \n \nThe impacts of the proposed Project will be the development of a \nsustainable,  culturally  and  environmentally  sound,  pro-poor \napproach  to  tourism  in  the  GMS  and  the  preservation  of  natural \nand cultural heritage. It will contribute to the implementation of the \nGMS-TSS.  The  project  outcome  will  be  sustainable  tourism \ndevelopment that creates livelihood opportunities for the poor.  \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $21.98  million \nequivalent.  The  cost  for  the  Lao  PDR  component  is  $10.87 \nmillion,  including  taxes  and  duties  of  $598,000.  The  cost  for  the \nViet Nam component is $11.11 million equivalent, including taxes \nand duties of $589,000. \n \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\nPeriod of Utilization \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agencies \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niii \n\nIt is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide a \nloan  of  SDR6,479,000  ($10  million  equivalent)  from  Special \nFunds  resources  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam,  with  a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an \ninterest  charge  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The  Government  of  Viet  Nam  will \nprovide  $1.11  million  equivalent  as  counterpart  funds.  It  is  also \nproposed  that  ADB  provide  a  grant  of  $10  million  from  Special \nFunds  resources  to  the  Lao  PDR,  the  Government  of  which  will \nprovide $870,000 equivalent as counterpart funds. \n\nTotal \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\n \nSource \nA.

The Mekong Tourism Coordinating Office will act as \nthe secretariat of SPSC. A national project steering committee will \nbe  established  in  each  participating  country  to  provide  policy \nguidance  and  oversee  project  implementation  nationally.  Each \nexecuting agency has established a project coordination unit with \na  project  director,  a  deputy  director,  and  other  professional  staff. \nthe \nimplementation  units  have  been  stablished \nProject \nprovincial departments of tourism of each participating province to \nundertake the day-to-day implementation of the Project.

Each  of  the  procurement \npackages for works will not exceed $1.5 million. Procurement for \nworks will follow national competitive bidding procedures in each \nof the participating countries that are acceptable to ADB. National \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  in  each  of  the  participating \ncountries  will  be  used  for  procuring  material  and  equipment \npackages  estimated  to  cost  between  $100,000  and  $500,000 \nequivalent. Equipment and materials that are locally available and \ncost  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  may  be  procured  through \nshopping.  Any  procurement  of  works,  goods,  or  services  of  not \nmore than $10,000 will be done through direct contracting.  \n \nA  total  of  250.5  person-months  of  consulting  services  will  be \nrequired  for  the  Lao  PDR  component,  and  226.5  person-months \nfor  the  Viet  Nam  component,  to  assist  in  project  management, \nresettlement,  gender  and  environment  matters,  and  supervising \nthe  design  and  construction  of \ninfrastructure.  The \nconsultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). In \nthe Lao PDR, services will be provided by individual consultants and \na  firm.  In  Viet  Nam  the services  will  be  provided  by  two firms.  The \nfirms  will  be  selected  by  quality-  and  cost-based  selection.  Two \ntraining  institutions  will  be  recruited  to  provide  training  under \noutput  4  using  Consultants  Qualification  Selection.  Individual \nconsultants  will  be \nfor  external  monitoring  of \nresettlement impacts and project external monitoring.  \n \nImproved  tourism  infrastructure  will  benefit  local  residents  and \ntourists.  The  Project  will  benefit  60,000  people  directly  and \n300,000  indirectly.  An  estimated  44%  of  all  beneficiaries  in  the \nLao PDR, and 30% in Viet Nam, are poor. The capacity of trainers \nof  tourism  SME  staff,  and  of  public  officials  in  pro-poor  tourism \nplanning  and  management,  will  be  enhanced.  About  180  master \ntrainers,  400  trainers,  and  800  government  officials  working  in \ntourism-related  institutions  will  be  trained,  of  which  40%  will  be \nwomen  and  30%  will  be  from  participating  provinces  or  districts \nwith  a  high  percentage  of  ethnic  minority  residents.  Human \nresource development  will improve the quality of service and the \ncompetitiveness  of  the  sector  and  provide  new  employment \nopportunities  and  higher  salaries  to  trainers  and  employees. \nProperly  planned  community-based  and  value-chain  tourism \ndevelopment initiatives will benefit the poor while protecting ethnic \nminority cultures and mitigating the potentially adverse impacts of \ntourism, especially on vulnerable groups such as women, youths, \nand \nthe  elderly.  Local  communities  will  be  provided  with \nalternative means of livelihood to supplement their income, which \nwill  help  to  protect  the  biodiversity  of  the  natural  sites.  Improved \n \n\nrecruited \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nv \n\nurban  environmental  infrastructure  will  reduce  pollution  and  its \nassociated diseases. \n \nMarket  Risks. Project benefits depend on the number of tourists \nvisiting  the  sites,  which  could  decline  due  to  internal  or  external \nmarket  risks.  To  mitigate  the  risks,  (i)  tourism  demand  analyses \nand  projections  were  prepared  using  conservative  assumptions; \n(ii) each agency in charge of the facilities will prepare a business \nplan  focused  on  risk  management,  especially  market  demand; \nand (iii) marketing and promotion activities for each subproject will \nhelp underpin the meeting of demand targets. \n \nProject  Implementation  Risks.  These  include  implementation \ndelays  and  cost  overruns  that  can  result  from  weak  planning, \nmanagement,  administration  capabilities,  or  procedures.  These \nrisks  have  been  mitigated  through  the  development  of  clear \nprocedures and the provision of technical support and training to \nthe  implementing  agencies.  The  risk  of  cost  overruns  has  been \nmitigated through careful and detailed cost estimation.  \n \ntourism \nSocial  and  Environmental  Risks.  Uncontrolled \ndevelopment  can  cause  congestion,  increased  pollution,  and  the \ndeterioration  of  destinations.  Over-commercialization  of  cultural \ntraditions may degrade cultural heritage and the cultural identity of \ntourism \nethnic  groups/minorities.  To  minimize \nplanning  and  management  plans  for  each  of  the  subprojects  will \nbe prepared and carefully monitored. Environmental analysis and \nmanagement plans have been prepared to mitigate any potential \nenvironmental impacts. \n \n \n\nthese  risks, \n\n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \ngrant  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  and  (ii)  a  proposed  loan  to  the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Sustainable Tourism \nDevelopment Project (the Project).  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nFollowing the request of the GMS Tourism Working Group, the Asian Development Bank \n2. \n(ADB)  approved  technical  assistance  (TA)1 to  prepare  the  Project.  The  TA  built  on  a  previous \nADB-supported study2 used to prepare the GMS Tourism Sector Strategy (GMS-TSS) and the \nlessons  from  the  ongoing  GMS  Mekong  Tourism  Development  Project  (MTDP).3 The  Project \ncovers  two  countries  in  the  GMS,  the  Lao  PDR  and  Viet  Nam,  which  requested  support  from \nADB. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nA. \n \n3. \nTourism  is  one  of  the  most  dynamic  sectors  of  the  world  economy,  with  rapid  growth \nfueled  by  developing  countries  in  Asia,  especially  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and \nIndia, and in the Middle East. The World Travel and Tourism Council estimates that total global \ntourism demand in 2007 reached $7 trillion, accounted for around 10% of global gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP),  and  employed  240  million  people.4 International  tourist  arrivals  exceeded  880 \nmillion,  with  total  receipts  estimated  at  $700  billion. 5  The  United  Nations  World  Tourism \nOrganization  forecasts  that  by  2020  international  tourism  arrivals  will  reach  1.6  billion  and \ngenerate $2 trillion in gross receipts. The Asia and Pacific region is second only to Europe as a \ntourist destination and, by 2020, is expected to account for 25% of global arrivals, receipts, and \nemployment. \n \nIn 2007, the GMS countries and areas6 received 25.6 million international tourist arrivals \n4. \ngenerating  receipts  estimated  at  $18.85  billion  and  employing  3.74  million  people.  Over  the \n1995\u20132007 period, international tourist arrivals to the GMS increased by an annual average rate \nof  8.12%\u2014more  than  twice  the  world  average.  Its  share  of  world  tourism  increased  over  this \nperiod  from  2.2%  to  2.9%,  and  its  share  of  Asia  and  Pacific  region  tourism  rose  from  11%  to \n14%.  Total  international  arrivals  to  the  subregion  are  projected  to  grow  by  almost  13%  per \nannum  to  53  million  by  2015  (or  4%  of  global  tourism).  The  average  length  of  stay  increased \nfrom 6.5 days in 1995 to 7.6 days in 2007. However, the average daily expenditure per tourist \n(including expenditure on air fares accruing to national carriers and visa fees paid offshore) fell \nfrom  $134  to  $94  because  the  number  of  tourists  from  within  Asia,  particularly  the  PRC  and \nThailand,  increased  more  quickly  than  that  of  other  regions  of  the  world,  and  Asian  travelers \nrequire less air transportation and generally spend less than travelers from outside Asia. Rapid \ntourism  growth  is  stimulating  unprecedented  demand  for  the  development  of  destinations; \n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2005.

About  60%  of  tourists  enter  the  Lao  PDR  by  land,  through  15  international  border \ncheckpoints, particularly over the Friendship Bridge connecting Thailand and the Lao PDR. The \nremainder enter through the international airports at Vientiane, Luang Prabang, and Pakse. The \nLao  National  Tourism  Administration  (LNTA)  estimates  that  in  2007  tourism  generated  $233 \nmillion  in  receipts,  accounting  for  about  7.5%  of  GDP.  The  sector  employs  32,000  people \ndirectly  and  400,000  indirectly.  By  2015,  LNTA  aims  to  achieve  3.57  million  international \narrivals, who will spend a total of $389 million and stay an average of 8 days. The Lao tourism \nproduct is associated with nature, Buddhism, and ethnic culture. The most popular destination is \nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage \nSite  of  Luang  Prabang.  Other  important  sites  include  Wat  Pho  in  Champassak  Province,  the \nPlain of Jars in Xieng Khouang Province, Vang Vieng on the Nam Song River, Kong Island on \nthe Mekong River near the Cambodian border, and the capital city of Vientiane. Special interest \nand activity tours such as river cruises, biking tours, trekking, and weaving tours are becoming \nincreasingly popular. \n \n6. \nInternational arrivals in Viet Nam grew from 1.71 to 4.17 million between 1997 and 2007, \nwith the average length of stay at 8 days and average daily expenditure at $96. The Ministry of \nCulture, Sports and Tourism (MCST) estimates that tourism generated $3 billion in receipts in \n2007, accounting for 3.5% of GDP. Direct employment in tourism is estimated at 1 million jobs. \nFor 2010, MCST targets 6 million international arrivals spending a total of $4.5 billion, employing \n1.4  million  people,  and  contributing  6.5%  of  GDP.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  tourism  product  leverages  its \nunique cultural and natural heritage and its diverse ethnic cultures. Viet Nam has two UNESCO \nWorld Natural Heritage Sites, at Halong Bay and Phong Nga Kebang National Park, and three \nUNESCO  World  Cultural  Heritage  Sites:  Hue  Imperial  City,  Hoi  An,  and  My  Son.  Other \nimportant  sites  are  the  Mekong  Delta,  the  protected  areas  of  the  Anamite  Mountain  Range, \nhistoric war sites, beaches, and the urban French heritage architectural. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nDespite  the  rapid  increase  in  international  tourism  arrivals  to  the  GMS  and  tourism\u2019s \ncontribution to the subregional economy, the benefits of tourism are concentrated on only a few \ndestinations and generally do not reach the poor.7 The capacity of governments and the tourism \nindustry  to  protect  their  environmental  and  cultural  heritage  from  potential  damage  caused  by \nthis rapid growth are weak, posing significant risks for the sustainability of the sector. The key \nchallenge  for  the  GMS  is  to  manage  this  rapid  growth  to  ensure  that  tourists  are  offered  a \ndiversity of high-quality products that benefit the poor and contribute to the preservation of the \nenvironment and the rich cultural heritage of the subregion. Public sector intervention in tourism \nis  required  to  (i)  minimize  infrastructure  constraints  and  bottlenecks  that  hamper  tourism \ndevelopment, (ii) regulate and monitor the use of public tourism assets by private operators to \nmitigate negative externalities, and (iii) expand opportunities for the poor to benefit from tourism. \nGMS governments need to establish partnerships with the private sector and local communities \nto develop  models for  a new subregional pattern of tourism development  that  (i) improves  the \nsustainability of natural and cultural assets and urban areas for tourism, (ii) creates new tourism \nproducts that benefit the poor, (iii) taps the opportunities offered by the recently completed GMS \n                                                 \n7   A significant percentage of high-spending tourists visiting Lao PDR only spend a 2\u20133 days in the country and visit \nonly Luang Prabang, and most do not even venture outside the town. Many of the new businesses established in \nthe town are owned by foreigners, and most of their employees come from outside the province. This situation is \nrepeated in other countries across the subregion. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n\f \n\n3\n\ntransport corridors to promote subregional tourist circuits that can attract new tourists and help \nto increase the length of stay and expenditures, and (iv) enhances human resource capacity in \ntourism SMEs and among public sector officials  to improve the competitiveness and quality of \nservice. \n \nTourism  and  Natural  Heritage  Conservation.  The  long-term  sustainability  of  GMS \n8. \ntourism development depends on the preservation of its natural heritage. The rapid increase in \nthe  number  of  visitors,  combined  with  inadequate  planning  and  management  at  many  GMS \nnatural parks, protected areas, and wetlands\u2014such as Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park and \nHalong  Bay  in  Viet  Nam,  or  Siphandone  in  the  Lao  PDR\u2014has  increased  pollution  from \nunregulated activities, risking the environmental and economic sustainability of the destinations. \nPoor local communities living at the sites but not benefiting from tourism depend upon natural \nresources  for  their  survival.  To  address  these  problems,  it  is  necessary  to  develop  effective \nmodels  for  sustainable  tourism  in  natural  heritage  sites  that  conform  to  sustainable  practices \nand  standards  by  (i)  improving  water  quality  by  efficiently  treating  sewage  and  reducing  and \nmanaging solid wastes; (ii) developing and using local supply chains to reduce the impacts of \ntransportation; and (iii) involving local communities in managing the sites and allowing them to \nbenefit from tourism as an alternative source of income. The improved management of natural \ntourist  sites  can  benefit  both  the  environment  and  local  economic  development.  Tourism  can \nsignificantly  contribute  to  environmental  protection,  the  conservation  and  restoration  of \nbiological diversity, and the sustainable use of natural resources. Revenue from park entrance \nfees can be allocated to pay for protecting and managing the sites, as is done with a portion of \nreceipts  at  Phong  Nga  Ke  Bang  National  Park  in  central  Viet  Nam.  However,  this  practice  is \napplied only at some UNESCO sites, and the approach can be extended to cover all natural and \ncultural sites of importance to tourism. \n \n9. \nUnsustainable  Urban  Tourism.  Uncontrolled tourism development in the GMS harms \nthe environment of such tourism urban centers as Vang Vieng and Luang Prabang in the Lao \nPDR and Hue City in Viet Nam, causing unsanitary and unsafe conditions for local populations \nand  tourists  that  threaten  to  undermine  the  sustainability  of  the  sector.  Insufficient  planning, \nlimited  public  sector  investment,  lack  of  experience  in  managing  cost-recovery  schemes,  and \nweak  institutional  and  regulatory  frameworks  have  resulted  in  the  pollution  of  urban  rivers, \ncoasts,  and  groundwater  sources;  increased  flooding;  and  streets  full  of  rubbish.  The \nenvironment  of  urban  tourism  centers  needs  to  be  sustainably  managed  to  ensure  visitor \nsatisfaction  and  health,  and  mechanisms  must  be  established  for  the  tourists  to  contribute \nfinancially to the maintenance of urban infrastructure. To address this problem, it is necessary to \ndevelop  models  that  demonstrate  how  to  plan,  finance,  operate,  and  maintain  environmental \ninfrastructure in urban tourism areas and to collect financial contributions from the tourists. \n \n10. \nRisks to Ethnic Groups/Minorities. Ethnic groups/minorities often face constraints that \nprevent  them  from  seizing  the  opportunities  brought  about  by  tourism  growth,  such  as \nremoteness, limited mobility, and market access, low education levels, lack of familiarity with the \nnational  language  and  the  languages  spoken  by  tourists,  and  limited  capacity  to  negotiate \nequitable  partnership  arrangements  with  the  private  sector.  Unmanaged  tourism  is  damaging \nthe cultures, traditions, and norms of GMS ethnic groups/minorities. Women from small ethnic \ngroups  face  additional  risks  and  increased  demands  on  their  time  from  tourism  development, \nincreasing the risk, for example, of girls dropping out of school. Efforts to conserve and share \nethnic  culture  with  tourists  and  younger  generations  carry  the  risk  of  branding  minorities  as \nexotic or backward. Tourism development provides a number of direct and indirect opportunities \nto ethnic minority groups for (i) increased income, (ii) locally led planning and development, (iii) \nrevitalized  cultural  practices,  (iv)  better \ntransport  and  communication,  and  (v)  better \ncommunication  with  authorities.  Developing  models  to  spread  tourism  benefits  to  ethnic \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\ngroups/minorities  in  the  GMS  while  protecting  them  from  risks  is  fundamental  to  promoting \ninclusive development in the subregion. \n \n11. \nTourism Not Benefiting the Poor. The benefits of tourism bypass most of the poor in the \nGMS.  A  study  prepared  by  the  Overseas  Development  Institute  and  the  Netherlands \nDevelopment  Organization  in  2005  showed  that  only  27%  of  the  tourist  expenditure  in  Luang \nPrabang accrued to unskilled and semi-skilled people. Another study showed that in 2006 only \n10% of the $3.12 million spent by tourists in Kratie, Cambodia, went to people from a poor or \nnear  poor  background.  Siem  Reap  is  both  the  main  tourist  center  and  the  second  poorest \nprovince in Cambodia. Public officials lack models or experience in developing pro-poor tourism \nplans  and  initiatives  in  partnership  with  the  tourism  industry.  Weak  capacity,  difficult  access  to \ncapital, low awareness of available opportunities, and cultural barriers to poor local communities\u2019 \ndealing with tourists have been key constraints to developing and implementing tourism services \nand products that benefit the poor. Models of tourism development are required that involve poor \nlocal  communities  in  the  provision  of  handicrafts,  food,  transportation,  accommodation,  and \nguiding  services.  These  models  would  include  the  development  of  community-based  tourism \nproducts  in  areas  where  the  poor  live  that  are  attractive  for  tourists  and  the  establishment  of \nsupply chains that increase the contribution of tourism to the local economy. Tourism has significant \npotential to reduce poverty because it is labor intensive and uses natural and cultural assets owned \nby  the  poor.  Tourism can  empower the  poor  to improve  their  lives  by  providing opportunities  and \nbuilding capacity for (i) employment, (ii) establishing SMEs, and (iii) investments where they live. \n \n12. \nTourism  Opportunities  along  Transportation  Corridors  Untapped.  The  GMS \ntransportation corridors and the implementation of cross-border transportation arrangements are \nexpected to facilitate and increase the flow of tourists within the GMS. However, limited planning \nand  financing,  the  lack  of  infrastructure,  and  the  absence  of  subregional  cooperation  models  to \ndevelop  multi-country  tourism  circuits  along  transport  corridors  have  prevented  the  local \ncommunities  living  along  them  from  tapping  new  tourism-related  opportunities.  Significant \npotential  exists  for  transforming  transport  corridors  into  economic  corridors  through  tourism. \nDeveloping  tourist  attractions  along  the  corridors\u2014such  as  constructing  markets  to  sell  locally \nproduced handicrafts and food to tourists and installing scenic viewpoints and visitor information \ncenters\u2014will encourage tourists to spend more time and money in these communities. Planning \nand  marketing  subregional  tourist  circuits  along  the  newly  developed  transport  corridors  that \nconnect  historical  sites,  natural  areas,  beaches,  towns,  and  other  tourist  attractions  can  make \nindividual destinations more attractive to visitors and increase tourism benefits. Models and plans \nto develop sustainable tourism projects need to be developed that bring economic opportunities to \nlocal communities, particularly the poor, and help them to manage vulnerabilities and risks such \nas HIV/AIDS8 and human trafficking.  \n \n13.  Weak Tourism Human Resources. In the GMS tourism industry, the quality of services, \nespecially those provided by tourism SMEs, is generally poor. Hygiene standards are low. Many \nvocational  training  institutions  in  the  GMS  do  not  have  appropriate  curriculums  and  lack \nqualified trainers to support vocational training for tourism SMEs. Most officials in provincial and \ndistrict  tourism  offices  lack  the  knowledge  necessary  to  undertake  basic  tourism  planning, \nmarketing,  or  regulatory  and  monitoring  functions,  or  to  mainstream  poverty  reduction  in  their \nplans. Managers of heritage sites lack the competencies required to manage them sustainably. \nEducational institutions lack the trainers and training programs required to strengthen capacity \nin these areas. Particularly limited is training on pro-poor tourism planning and management that \nis  environmentally  sustainable,  culturally  sensitive,  and  gender  inclusive.  Unless  effectively \naddressed, this problem threatens the competitiveness and sustainability of the tourism sector.  \n \n\n                                                 \n8 human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n14. \nThe  GMS  Program.  The  Strategic  Framework  of  the  GMS  Economic  Cooperation \nProgram (2002\u20132012) focuses on (i) enhancing connectivity, (ii) increasing competitiveness, and \n(iii) generating a greater sense of community among GMS countries. It is implemented through 11 \nflagship programs, of which tourism is one. Tourism is a priority under the Vientiane Plan of Action \nfor GMS Development (2008\u20132012) endorsed by GMS leaders on 31 March 2008. The program \nhas succeeded in improving physical connectivity by developing transport corridors, but benefits \nhave not yet accrued to the poor. Urgent interventions are required to tap the opportunities and \nminimize the risks created by these new corridors. The Project will contribute to the vision of the \nGMS  program  by  (i)  developing  tourism  circuits  along  transport  corridors  to  tap  opportunities  to \nreduce  poverty  along  them  and  increase  connectivity  among  the  peoples  of  the  GMS,  (ii) \nenhancing human resources to increase the competitiveness of the GMS tourism industry, and (iii) \ndeveloping  model  tourism  projects  that  contribute  to  protecting  the  cultural  heritage  and \nenvironment of the subregion, distributing benefits to the poor, and generating a greater sense of \ncommunity.  \n \n15. \nGMS  Tourism  Cooperation.  The  GMS  tourism  cooperation  program  started  in  1993 \nwith the establishment of the Tourism Working Group (TWG), comprising senior representatives \nof  the  national  tourism  organizations  (NTOs)  of  each  GMS  country.  During  its  first  decade, \nsubregional  cooperative  initiatives  in  tourism  focused  on  marketing  the  GMS  as  a  single \ndestination, developing tourism-related infrastructure, improving the quality of human resources, \npromoting  dialogue  between  the  private  and  public  sectors,  and  facilitating  the  movement  of \ntourists to and within the subregion. In 2005, TWG launched the GMS-TSS (2006\u20132015), which \nprovides an effective framework for developing a pattern of tourism that is environmentally and \nsocially sustainable, distributes the benefits of tourism more widely, and benefits the poor. The \nstrategy is being implemented through seven strategic programs that (i) foster the development \nof  multi-country  tourism  in  the  GMS  with  common  branding  of  culture,  nature,  and  adventure \nattractions;9 (ii) provide for joint planning and development of tourism infrastructure; (iii) promote \nupgrading  the  skills  of  tourism  officials,  trainers,  and  workers;  (iv)  enhance  the  standards  of \nmanaging  natural  and  cultural  resources;  (v)  help  reduce  the  incidence  of  poverty  and  raise \nrural  incomes;  (vi)  encourage  private  sector  participation;  and  (vii)  identify  and  mitigate \nimpediments to travel to and within the GMS. The GMS-TSS recommends the preparation and \nimplementation of demonstration projects in these areas. To support the implementation of the \nstrategy,  TWG  established  the  Mekong  Tourism  Coordinating  Office  (MTCO)  in  Bangkok  in \n2006,  which  is  financed  by  contributions  from  TWG  members.  MTCO  has  developed  action \nplans  for  marketing  and  development  to  implement  priority  projects  under  the  strategy  up  to \n2010, endorsed by the first meeting of GMS tourism ministers in 2008 in Bangkok. \n \nExternal Assistance to the GMS Tourism Sector. Tourism is increasingly recognized \n16. \nby  many  development  partners  as  a  tool  for  natural  and  cultural  heritage  conservation  and \npoverty alleviation. Many development partners have become involved in tourism nationally and \nsubregionally  in  the  last  5  years.10 The  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for \nAsia  and  the  Pacific,  United  Nations  World  Tourism  Organization,  and  other  development \npartners  have  supported  initiatives  to  enhance  the  skills  of  tourism  leaders,  trainers,  and \nprofessional  managers  and  to  expand  the  benefits  of  tourism  to  the  poor  through  various \n\n                                                 \n9   A survey of 2,000 tourists conducted at five exit points in different GMS countries in 2005 for the preparation of the \n\nTSS showed that 35% of them visit more than one country and 15% visit three countries. \n\n10  The list includes (i) international organizations such as UNESCO, European Union, United Nations World Tourism \nOrganization, United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia Pacific, International Finance Corporation, \nand  Pacific  Asia  Travel  Association;  (ii)  bilateral  donors  such  as  German  Technical  Cooperation,  Danish \nInternational  Development  Agency,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  and  New  Zealand  International \nDevelopment  Agency;  (iii)  international  nongovernment  organizations  such  Wild  Aid,  World  Wildlife  Fund, \nNetherlands  Development  Organization,  and  Conservation  International;  and  (iv)  training  institutions  such  as  the \nMekong Institute. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nprojects.  UNESCO  has  supported  subregional  initiatives  to  enhance  standards  for  managing \nnatural  and  cultural  resources  for  conservation  and  tourism.  The  Mekong  Tourism  Forum  has \nbeen organized annually since 1995 with the assistance of the Pacific Asia Travel Association to \nenhance dialogue on tourism between the private and public sectors in the GMS. In 2005 and \n2006, tourism investment forums were organized with the support of the GMS tourism industry. \n \n17. \nADB has played a prominent role in supporting the GMS tourism sector. The MTDP has \nfacilitated the movement of tourists across the subregion by supporting the construction of airports, \npiers  along  the  Mekong  River,  and  access  roads  to  tourism  destinations.  It  contributed  to  the \nenvironmental  sustainability  of  key  GMS  tourism  destinations  through  the  construction  of \nmanagement systems for wastewater and solid wastes and to the distribution of tourism benefits \nthrough the development of 25 community-based tourism projects in poor areas of the GMS. The \nGMS Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management11 has supported several training courses \nto  improve  the  tourism  planning  and  management  capacity  of  GMS  government  officials.  ADB \nprovided  assistance  to  TWG  toward  preparing  the  GMS-TSS  and  seconded  staff  to  MTCO  to \nsupport  its  implementation,  with  financial  support  from  the  French  Government.  Appendix  2 \nprovides a summary of tourism-related external assistance to the GMS.  \n \n18. \nLessons  Identified.  Key  lessons  were  identified  from  the  MTDP  and  other  tourism \nprojects  in  the  subregion.  First,  promoting  local  ownership  of  tourism  resources  and  projects, \nand training communities to manage them, is fundamental to ensuring that they keep control of \ntheir  own  development  and  benefit  from  tourism.  Second,  in  many  instances,  poor  local \ncommunities  do  not  have  the  capacity  to  implement  and  sustain  tourism  products  without \nexternal  support  and  require  partnerships  established  with  the  private  sector.  Public  sector \nsupport  is  required  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  products  and  the  fairness  of  the \npartnerships.  Two  successful  examples  of  public-private-community  partnership  supported  by \nthe  MTDP  are  in  Luang  Namtha  and  Luang  Prabang,  Lao  PDR.  In  Luang  Namtha,  the  tour \noperator  Green  Discovery  increased  the  number  of  tourists  on  the  Nam  Ha  Camping  Tour  by \n350%,  and  revenue  from  $3,965  to  $22,938,  from  2005  to  2007,  after  entering  into  an \nagreement with the provincial tourism department and the village of Dorn Xay. Villagers provide \nfood, guide services, site security, and trail maintenance for the tour program and receive about \n30%  of  gross  revenue.  In  Luang  Prabang,  Tiger  Trails,  a  local  tour  operator,  entered  into  a \nsimilar agreement with the provincial tourism department and seven communities along the Fair \nTrek  tour  circuit.  By  the  second  year  of  operation,  the  tour  had  served  2,147  tourists  and \ngenerated $64,376 in gross income, of which approximately 25% was paid to village and local \nservice  providers.  In  contrast,  the  Phou  Khong  trekking  program,  operated  independently  by \nMaisingsampanh  village  in  Champasak  Province,    served  only  18  clients  in  3  years  and \ngenerated a mere $3,047.  \n \n19. \nThe  third  lesson  was  that  clearly  defined  roles  and  responsibilities  for  subregional  and \nnational  committees  and  management  units;  well-defined  job  descriptions,  training  programs, \nand  financial  incentives  for  staff;  detailed  work  plans  and  budgets;  and  clear  reporting \nmechanisms are key for the success of the Project. Fourth, allocating adequate resources and \nsystems for regular monitoring and evaluation of performance is fundamental to assessing the \nimpact of the interventions and gaining support from community leaders and partners. Appendix \n3 describes these and other lessons that have been factored into the design of the Project. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n11  Financed by ADB and other development partners. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n20. \nThe impact of the proposed Project will be the development of a sustainable, culturally \nand  environmentally  sound,  pro-poor  tourism  approach  for  the  GMS  and  the  preservation  of \nnatural  and  cultural  heritage.  It  will  contribute  to  implementing  the  GMS-TSS.  The  project \noutcome  will  be  sustainable  tourism  development  that  creates  livelihood  opportunities  for  the \npoor.  The  project  area  is  nine  provinces  in  the  Lao  PDR  (Bokeo,  Champassak,  Houaphanh, \nLuang Namtha, Oudomxay, Saravanh, Savannakhet, Vientiane, and Xayaboury) and five in Viet \nNam (Bac Kan, Cao Bang, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Tien Hue), which were selected for \ntheir tourism potential, poverty rates, and inclusion in a GMS-TSS priority zone. \n \nB. \n \n21. \nThe Project will have the following 5 outputs: (i) model sustainable tourism development \nprojects  protecting  the  environment  and  cultural  heritage  developed,  (ii)  pro-poor,  community-\nbased,  supply-chain  tourism  projects  operational,  (iii)  GMS  tourism  corridors  developed,  (iv) \nhuman resource capacity of public and private tourism stakeholders improved, and (v) efficient \nproject management services. Four subprojects under output 1 were selected from a long list of \n120  candidates  included  in  the  GMS-TSS  based  on  selection  criteria  agreed  with  the \nparticipating countries. A sectoral approach has been adopted for the demonstration subprojects \nunder outputs 2 and 3 that will be identified during project implementation following the selection \ncriteria stated in Appendix 4. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Model Sustainable Tourism Development Projects Protecting the \nEnvironment and Cultural Heritage Developed \n\n \n22. \nThis  output  will  develop  for  replication  throughout  the  GMS  four  model  tourism \nsubprojects  that  will  contribute  to  the  protection  of  important  natural  heritage  sites,  the \nimprovement  of  environmental  conditions  in  urban  tourism  centers,  ethnic  groups/minorities\u2019 \nlivelihoods,  and  the  protection  of  their  cultural  heritage.  Each  subproject  will  include  the \npreparation,  establishment,  development  and/or  implementation  of  (i)  heritage-based  tourism \nmaster plans and zoning and management plans; (ii) small tourism-related infrastructure such as \naccess roads, boat landings, pathways and trails, and drainage and waste management systems; \n(iii)  capacity  development  and  livelihood  support  programs  for  local  communities,  especially \nincluding  women,  youths,  and  ethnic  groups,  to  develop  and  operate  community  tourism \nenterprises and revitalize cultural industries in partnership with private tourism operators;12 (iv) a \ngender  and  ethnic  minority  development  program;  (v)  a  database  and  geographic  information \nsystem  on  cultural  practices  and  indigenous  knowledge  in  the  area;  (vi)  a  public  awareness \nprogram  targeting  tourists,  tourism  operators,  and  local  communities  on  natural  and  cultural \nresource conservation and protection, respect for cultural heritage, controlling the traffic in wildlife \nand antiquities, efficient waste management practices, HIV/AIDS, and other tourism issues; (vii) a \nmarketing  and  promotion  program  and  materials  to  promote  sustainable  tourism  and  cultural \nproducts in association with local private tourism companies; (viii) institutional strengthening and \ncapacity  building  in  the  agencies  in  charge  of  operating  and  maintaining  project  facilities;  (ix) \nmanuals to guide the preparation and implementation of future GMS tourism subprojects focused \non  wetlands,  protected  areas,  urban  sites,  and  ethnic  groups/minorities;  and  (x)  a  monitoring \nand evaluation program. These subprojects will help strengthen the local economy by creating \nadditional  livelihood  opportunities  for  local  communities  to  sell  agricultural  and  handicraft \nproducts; provide cultural and guide services; gain access to new and higher-paid employment \n\n                                                 \n12  The  Project  will  promote  the  development  of  community-private  sector  partnership  and  the  development  of  small \n\nand micro tourism enterprises. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nin  restaurants,  shops,  and  transportation  services;  and  establish  new  SMEs.  The  subprojects \nwill provide a more sustainable basis for private sector participation in the provision of services \nto  tourists  and  generate  sustained  markets  for  local  labor  and  locally  produced  handicrafts, \nagricultural products, and materials.  \n \nLao  PDR:  Biodiversity  Protection  in  the  Siphandone  Wetland.  The  Siphandone \n23. \nWetland  is  in  Champassak  Province  and  part  of  the  biodiversity  corridor  through  Lao  PDR, \nCambodia,  and  Thailand.  It  contains  about  four  thousand  islands  and  is  home  to  more  than \n72,000  people.  Poor  communities  living  in  and  adjacent  to  the  wetland  depend  on  it  for  food \nsecurity  and  income.  Over  the  years,  the  growing  population  and  high  fish  prices  have  brought \nintensifed fishing and hunting, threatening Siphandone\u2019s biodiversity. The subproject will provide \nalternative  income  opportunities  for  local  people  such  as  employment  in  tourism  information \ncenters,  hotels,  and  guesthouses;  as  guides;  providing  tourist  transport;  and  selling  handicrafts \nand other products to them. Additional income from these new opportunities is expected to stem \ncurrent activities that contribute to the site\u2019s environmental deterioration. The subproject includes \n(i)  upgrading  a  4  kilometer  (km)  access  road  that  connects  Route  13  to  the  boat  landing  at \nNakasang  village;  (ii)  improving  existing  pathways  on  Don  Det  and  Don  Kone  islands;  (iii) \nenvironmental improvements at Nakasang and on Don Det and Don Kone; (iv) constructing visitor \ninformation  and  interpretation  facilities  on  the  Nakasang  village  side  of  the  wetland;  and  (v) \nconstructing  fully  interpreted  access  trails  at  Nakasang  and  on  Don  Det,  Don  Kone,  and  other \nsmaller islands. \n \n24. \nLao  PDR:  Vang  Vieng  Town  Environmental  Improvement.  Vang Vieng town functions \nboth as a tourist center and service point between Vientiane and Luang Prabang. The number of \ntourists visiting the town has grown annually by 15% to 20% and is expected to surpass 100,000 \nby  2008.  Tourism  businesses  pollute  the  environment  with  solid  wastes  and  wastewater \ndischarged directly into the drainage system and the river, which is also used for tourism activities. \nThe subproject will improve environmental conditions in Vang Vieng town, contribute to reducing \ndownstream river pollution, and protect  the  water quality of  the  river for local use  and tourism.  It \nincludes (i) expanding and improving the existing drainage system in the core area of Vang Vieng \ntown; (ii) upgrading selected roads in the core area to ensure that stormwater drains into side-entry \npits;  and  (iii)  installing  a  bio-filter  to  remove  a  contaminants  (e.g.,  hydrocarbons  and  sediments). \nThe subproject will strengthen linkages between the tourism industry and local suppliers of labor, \nagricultural products, handicrafts, and other materials. \n \n25. \nViet Nam: Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park. Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park is a \nUNESCO  Natural  World  Heritage  Site  located  in  Quang  Binh  Province,  approximately  500  km \nsouth of Hanoi. Covering 85,754 hectares of rugged limestone mountains, the park straddles the \nHo Chi Minh Trail and abuts the Hin Nam No National Protected Area in the Lao PDR. More than \n75,000  people  live  in  communities  around  the  park,  and  about  2,100  people  reside  in  remote \nvillages within it. Since the area became protected, residents\u2019 loss of access to the forest and its \nnon-timber forest products has harmed their livelihoods. Tourism activities affect the sustainability \nof the site. The subproject will provide additional sources of income to local people by developing \nnew  tourism  products  that  will  create  additional  employment  opportunities  in  transport,  tourism \ninformation,  and  accomodation.  It  will  also  improve  the  capacity  of  park  managers  to  manage \nincreased  tourism  and  contribute  to  the  preservation  of  the  natural  environment.  It  includes  (i) \nimprovements to the Phong Nga and Tien Son caves to facilitate access for tourists and minimize \ndisruption  to  the  site,  (ii)  the  development  of  a  new  nature  circuit  in  the  park,  and  (iii) \nimprovements to existing procedures for solid waste disposal and management. \n \n26. \nViet Nam: Ethnic Minorities Cultural Heritage Development in Bac Kan. Located in \nthe northern highlands of Viet Nam along Route 3, Bac Kan Province is 120 km north of Hanoi. \nAbout  85%  of  the  residents  of  Bac  Kan  depend  on  agriculture  for  subsistence  and  livelihoods. \nAmong the 300,000 people living in the province, 87% are ethnic minorities, comprising the Tay, \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nDao,  Nung,  H\u2019mong,  Hoa,  and  San  Chay.  Bac  Kan  is  known  for  its  rich  ethnic  traditions  and \nnatural  landscapes  such  as  Ba  Be  Lake  and  National  Park  and  Nang  Tien  cave.  Since  2003, \ntourism has grown at an annual average of 23%, with about 100,000 overnight tourists visiting \nthe  province  in  2007.  As  ethnic  minorities  experience  a  rapid  shift  toward  a  market  economy \nand urbanization brought by tourism growth, there is a risk of lost cultural identity and heritage, \nespecially  language  and  oral  traditions  and  indigenous  knowledge,  music,  rituals,  and  belief \nsystems. Meanwhile, ethnic minorities do not benefit from tourism. The subproject will promote \nethnic culture and traditions in a way that is not exploitative but attractive to tourists. It will provide \nbusiness  and  employment  opportunities  to  ethnic  groups  and  help  them  benefit  from  tourism \nthrough the fair sharing of proceeds with private tourism operators, while improving their capacity \nto  minimize  potential  social  disruption.  It  includes  (i)  constructing  a  heritage  interpretation  and \nvisitor  information  center  near  Ba  Be  Lake,  (ii)  developing  tourist  destinations  and  products  in \nselected  villages,  (iii)  developing  and  delivering  training  programs  for  local  residents  at  the  new \ncenter to help revitalize  cultural industries, and (iv) preparing and implementing a private sector \ninvestment program for cultural heritage tour operation and, potentially, eco-lodges. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput  2:  Pro-Poor,  Community-Based,  Supply-Chain  Tourism  Projects \nOperational  \n\n \n27. \nOutput 2 will involve and benefit poor communities in the tourism economy through 33 \nsubprojects.13 It includes the development of tourism products and tours designed and operated \nby local communities in partnership with the private sector, and supply-chain initiatives to link the \nproduction  of agricultural goods and  handicrafts  by poor communities  to the local,  regional, and \nnational  tourism  economy.  Output  2  aims  to  protect  ethnic  cultures  and  minimize  the  adverse \nimpacts  of  tourism,  especially  on  vulnerable  groups  such  as  women,  youths,  and  the  elderly. \nThe output aims to increase rural employment and the incomes of the poor by developing new \ntourism  products  and  services  in  partnership  with  the  private  sector.  The  poor  will  benefit \nworking  as  guides  and  providing  food,  accommodation,  cultural  performances,  and  local \ntransportation  to  tourists.  New  opportunities  will  be  developed  to  produce  and  sell  local \nhandicrafts, food, and other products to tourists. \n \n28. \nA sectoral approach has been adopted for this output, based on a demonstration model \ndeveloped  for  Aloui  District,  Thua  Tien  Hue  Province,  with  other  sites  to  be  selected  during \nproject  implementation.  The  output  includes  (i)  the  development  of  community-based  tour \nproducts  and  services,  (ii)  a  public  awareness  program  for  tourism,  (iii)  the  identification  and \ndevelopment  of  tourism-related  supply-chain  initiatives,  (iv)  capacity  development  in  tourism-\nrelated SMEs and communities, (v) the construction of small tourism-related infrastructure, (vi) a \ngender  and  ethnic  minorities  development  program,  (vii)  a  marketing  and  promotion  program, \n(viii) the promotion of community tourism networks and tourism stakeholder associations, (ix) a \njoint  manual  to  guide  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  pro-poor  tourism  initiatives  in  the \nGMS  (coordinated  between  the  Lao  PDR  and  Viet  Nam),  and  (x)  a  monitoring  and  evaluation \nprogram.  \n \n\nOutput 3: GMS Tourism Corridors Developed \n\n3. \n \n29. \nThe  output  will  result  in  the  development  of  GMS  transnational  tourism  corridors.  It  will \nprovide  models  for  a  subregional  approach  to  developing  tourism  opportunities  along  the  GMS \ntransport  corridors  that  contributes  to  their  transformation  into  subregional  economic  corridors. \nThe  output  will  help  participating  countries  coordinate  with  other  GMS  countries, 14  local \n\n                                                 \n13  Three  subprojects  will  be  developed  in  11  provinces:  Bokeo,  Houaphanh,  Saravanh,  Oudomxay,  Sayabouli,  and \nVang Vieng District of Vientiane in the Lao PDR and Thua Tien Hue, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Bac Kan and Cao \nBang in Viet Nam. \n\n14  Other GMS countries can join by financing activities in their territories with their own resources. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\ncommunities,  and  the  private  sector  to  develop  tourism  sites  and  circuits,  joint  marketing  plans, \nand common tourism signage along the main GMS transport corridors.  About 10 subprojects to \nimprove the infrastructure of tourism sites will be developed in the Lao PDR along the north\u2013south \neconomic  corridor  (NSEC),  which  links  Yunnan  Province  in  the  PRC  to  the  Lao  PDR  and \nThailand,  and  in  Viet  Nam  and  the  Lao  PDR  along  the  east\u2013west  economic  corridor  (EWEC), \nwhich links these two countries with Thailand. The Project will include activities to help manage \nthe risks associated with the increased movement of people and tourists across borders. \n \n30. \nThis  output  aims  to  create  economic  opportunities  for  local  communities  located  along \nthe corridors; lengthen the time tourists spend in participating countries; create jobs, especially \nfor women and ethnic groups/minorities; protect the integrity of natural and cultural heritage at \nthe  sites  by  installing  appropriate  infrastructure  and  management  systems;  promote  private \nsector  participation;  and  develop \nto  add  value, \nunderstanding, and appreciation of the selected sites. The output includes (i) preparing tourism \ndevelopment  and  management  plans  for  individual  sites  and  each  economic  corridor;  (ii) \nconstructing  tourism-related  infrastructure  along  the  corridors,  including  access  roads,  parking \nlots,  ticket  booths,  information  centers,  walking  trails,  markets,  and  interpretation  and  sanitary \nfacilities,  with  partnerships  between  local  communities  and  the  private  sector  for  investment, \noperations and maintenance; (iii) a community awareness and livelihood-support program; (iv) \ntourism  management  training  for  site  managers  and  a  local  tour-guide  training  program;  (v)  a \nmarketing  and  promotion  program;  (vi)  a  gender  and  ethnic  groups/minorities  development \nprogram;  (vii)  a  public  awareness  program  for  HIV/AIDS,  human  trafficking,  drug  abuse,  and \nother  tourism-related  concerns;  (viii)  a  joint  manual  on  procedures  and  practices  to  develop \nGMS tourism corridors, coordinated between the Lao PDR and Viet Nam; and (ix) a monitoring \nand evaluation program.  \n \n\ninterpretative  materials  and  displays \n\nOutput 4: Human Resources in the Tourism Sector Developed \n\n4. \n \n31. \nOutput  4  will  create  a  pool  of  master  trainers  to  meet  training  needs  in  the  areas  of  (i) \nsmall-scale  tourism  and  hospitality  operations  and  (ii)  public  sector  tourism  planning  and \nmanagement. Under the first training area, some master trainers will be selected to train trainers \nof staff in tourism SMEs.15 Under the second training area, the Project will support master trainers\u2019 \ntraining of provincial, district, and local public officials responsible for tourism management in pro-\npoor  planning  and  management.  Training  will  focus  on  the  participating  provinces.  In  each \ncountry, a training institution for each of the two training areas will be selected, receive support to \nimprove its facilities, and partner with international institutions in training master trainers.  \n \nIn each country, the output includes (i) a review of the existing training needs assessment \n32. \nfor staff in tourism SMEs and public tourism officials; (ii) the revision or development of service \nstandards for SME tourism and hospitality enterprises, as well as related training standards based \non Association of Southeast Asean Nations (ASEAN) models and the training needs assessment; \n(iii)  the  development  of  gender-  and  ethnic-sensitive  and  -inclusive  training  kits  and  manuals, \nteacher  training  materials  and  case  studies,  best  practices,  and  lessons  learned;  (iv)  the \nproduction of CD ROMs and web-based training materials; (v) the development and maintenance \nof a web-based knowledge center accessible in all GMS countries; (vi) the translation of training \nmanuals  into  Lao,  Vietnamese,  and  other  ethnic  languages;  (vii)  support  to  training  institutions \nselected  in  each  country;  (viii)  the  training  of  master  trainers  in  English  and  of  trainers  and \ngovernment officials in local languages; and (ix) a monitoring and evaluation program.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n15  Training of staff in tourism SMEs will not be financed by the Project. \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nSpecial Features \n\nOutput 5: Efficient Project Implementation Services are Operational \n\n5. \n \n33. \nOutput  5  will  ensure  efficient  project  management  services  that  are  fully  operational.  In \neach country, this output includes (i) international and national consulting services with expertise \nin  tourism  development,  heritage  preservation  and  development,  financial  accounting,  social \nand  gender  development,  resettlement,  environment,  civil  engineering  and  supervision, \ndeveloping systems of project performance management, ecotourism, supply chains and human \nresource  development;  (ii)  support  for  project  implementation  and  coordination;  (iii)  capacity \ndevelopment for project coordination units (PCUs) and project implementation units (PIUs); (iv) \nexternal  monitoring  for  resettlement;  (v)  project  auditing;  and  (vii)  intermittent  monitoring  and \nevaluation of the Project by an independent consultant or institution. \n \nC. \n \n34. \nGMS  Subregional  Cooperation.  The  GMS-TSS  recognizes  that  a  cooperative, \ncommon  approach  to  tourism  development  is  needed  if  the  subregion\u2019s  countries  want  to \ndevelop  the  sector  in  a  sustainable  way  in  an  increasingly  competitive  market.  The  Project \nbuilds  on  that  principle  to  support  the  development  of  a  subregional  tourism  approach  to \nachieve the objectives of the GMS-TSS. It will enhance subregional cooperation and economic \nintegration  by  enhancing  the  attractions  of  key  subregional  tourism  destinations,  encouraging \nthe movement of tourists along the GMS transport corridors, promoting common approaches to \ncommunity-based  ecotourism  and  value-chain  activities,  and  improving  the  management  of \nurban and natural protected areas of importance for tourism. The Project is expected to have an \nimpact on all GMS countries through the development of demonstration tourism subprojects in \nthe participating countries, which can be replicated across the subregion. \n \n35. \nImproved  tourism  infrastructure  along  the  GMS  transport  corridors,  common  tourism \nsignage, and joint tourism marketing strategies for each corridor will help tour operators develop \nmulti-country circuits along the roads that could integrate the subprojects included in the Project \nand  the  entire  subregion.  The  Project  will  complement  other  GMS  projects  and  initiatives \nsupported by ADB, particularly the development of transport corridors (EWEC in the Lao PDR and \nViet Nam and the NSEC in the Lao PDR), the Core Environment Program, and the Cross-Border \nTransport  Agreement.  MTCO  will  serve  as  the  coordination  point  for  the  Project.  All  GMS \ncountries  are  expected  to  participate  in  meetings  of  the  subregional  project  steering  committee \n(SPSC)  to  exchange  experiences,  contribute  to  preparing  the  tourism  manuals,  develop  GMS \ntourism corridors, and agree on a subregional approach to sustainable tourism development. All \nproject  sites  are  located  in  one  of  the  priority  tourism  zones  identified  in  the  GMS-TSS.  Some \nareas of important natural and cultural heritage are shared by two or more GMS countries. GMS \nmanuals on (i) urban tourism, (ii) tourism management in protected natural and sensitive areas, (iii) \nethnic  groups/minorities  and  tourism,  (iv)  pro-poor  tourism,  and  (v)  tourism  corridors  will  be \nproduced and widely publicized. A GMS tourism database for human resources will be developed. \n \nPoverty  Reduction.  The  Project  has  been  classified  as  a  targeted  intervention.  As  the \n36. \nproject  area  covers  the  poorest  provinces  in  the  two  countries,  30%  of  expected  project \nbeneficiaries in Viet Nam and 44% in the Lao PDR are poor. As these areas are important tourist \nlocations, great potential exists for the Project to reduce the high poverty incidence and contribute \nto  inclusive  economic  development.  The  poor  in  the  project  areas  will  benefit  significantly  from \nproject interventions through the generation of new employment opportunities and tourism SMEs; \ndeveloping  community  ownership  and  self-reliance;  reduced  social  and  health  risks  through \nawareness  programs;  improved  infrastructure,  such  as  potable  water,  communications,  roads, \nand  access  to  markets;  protection  of  natural  and  cultural  resources;  and  a  more  sustainable \nenvironment.  The  Project\u2019s  pro-poor  tourism-development  activities  include  community-based \napproaches combined with supply-chain initiatives that aim to protect minority cultures, minimize \nthe adverse impacts of tourism, and provide livelihood opportunities for vulnerable groups such as \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\ninvolving  women \n\nimplementation;  (iv) \n\nin  project  monitoring  and  evaluation, \n\nwomen, youths, ethnic groups/minorities, and the elderly. The output regarding human resources \ndevelopment will have a pro-poor focus and include training on developing and managing small-\nscale tourism interventions in poor areas and targeted capacity development for women, the poor \nand ethnic groups/minorities. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 5. \n \nGender. The tourism industry is particularly important for women, as the percentage of \n37. \nwomen employed in restaurants, hotels, and other tourism services is higher than in the general \nworkforce.16 Women  will  benefit  through  increased  employment  and  the  educational  and  other \nsocioeconomic  opportunities  generated  by  the  tourism  sector  such  as  food  production, \nhandicrafts, ceremonial celebrations, and the operation and management of small tourism sites. \nAt  the  same  time,  the  Project  has  significant  potential  to  promote  gender  equity  by  improving \nwomen\u2019s decision making in tourism management. A gender action plan has been formulated to \npromote the equal participation of all stakeholders as project beneficiaries. Key activities include \n(i) establishing mechanisms to promote women\u2019s representation in decision-making processes; \n(ii) integrating women\u2019s needs into project subcomponents; (iii) including targets for female staff \nin  project \ntraining  communities,  government  officials,  and  other \nstakeholders on gender issues and risks related to tourism; (v) conducting awareness programs \nfor  communities  and  government  officials  on  HIV/AIDS,  trafficking,  and  other  social  risks;  (vi) \neffectively \nincluding  gender-\ndisaggregated data for these purposes; and (vii) reserving at least 40% of capacity development \nand  training  activities  and  50%  of  the  scholarships  for  master  trainers  for  women.  A  summary \ngender analysis and action plan is in Appendix 6. \n \n38. \nCommunity  Participation.  A  participation  strategy  is  incorporated  into  the  project \ndesign  to  help  communities  plan  and  manage  local  tourism  destinations  through  an  inclusive \nmodel of community and supply-chain development. The pro-poor tourism-development output \nwill  enable  community  groups  and  individual  households  to  set  their  own  priorities  for  tourism \ndevelopment and to utilize and manage tourism sites as collective resources. The Project will (i) \nfacilitate  and  provide  capacity  building  on  community  planning,  management,  operation,  and \nmaintenance of local tourism development; (ii) conduct awareness campaigns on social risks; (iii) \nprovide  sufficient  opportunities  for  all  groups  to  participate  in  the  Project;  (iv)  build  capacity  in \npoor communities for developing ownership and self-reliance; and (v) ensure the monitoring and \nevaluation  of  participatory  processes  and  outputs.  Project  preparation  included  extensive \nconsultation with beneficiaries using participatory approaches.  \n \n39. \nEthnic  Groups/Minorities.  Ethnic  groups/minorities  in  participating  provinces  will \nbenefit from the preparation and implementation of demonstration projects aimed at developing \na sustainable, culturally and environmentally sound, pro-poor approach to tourism in the GMS. \nThe anticipated threats to ethnic groups/minorities under output 1 of the Project are very limited. \nThe  Bac  Kan  subproject  will  help  conserve  and  revitalize  ethnic  culture  and  traditions  in  the \nprovince, especially in Ba Be District, where 85% of the population is minority. The  subprojects \nunder outputs 2 and 3 will include specific actions to enable ethnic minorities, especially ethnic \nwomen, to participate in capacity development for tourism-related micro-enterprises, ensure that \nthey benefit from the Project, and mitigate any risks. Each output includes a separate budget to \nsupport the screening and mitigation of tourism impacts on ethnic minority groups and develop \nmeasures for more equitable distribution of benefits among all ethnic groups. A summary ethnic \ngroups/minorities development framework for the Project is in Appendix 7. \n \n40. \nrecovery \nmechanisms  are  built  into  all  subprojects  to  ensure  their  financial  sustainability.  The \nmechanisms, based on user or environmental charges and tourism entrance fees, will be used \nto  cover  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  of  each  subproject  or  to  finance  social \n                                                 \n16  UNDP. 1999.

Surveys of foreign and domestic \ntourists  were  conducted  to  assess  their  willingness  to  pay  entrance  and  user  fees  at  project \nsites. Surveys of commercial businesses and residents in Vang Vieng town were conducted to \nassess  their  receptiveness  to  environmental  user  fees  for  the  environmental  management \ninfrastructure  proposed.  The  Project  will  develop  models  for  minority  cultural  heritage \ninformation centers and natural protected area management agencies of importance for tourism \nto generate sufficient revenue from tourists, reinvest a certain percentage of it in preserving the \ndestination,  and  gradually  reduce  government  subsidies,  while  benefiting  local  communities  in \nthe area. Entrance fees to Phong Nha Khe Bang, Bac Kan, and Siphandone will be increased \nso that the agencies in charge of the sites get sufficient funds to cover O&M costs.  \n \nD. \n \nThe  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $21.98  million  equivalent.  The  cost  for  the  Lao \n41. \nPDR component is $10.87 million, including taxes and duties of $598,000, and for the Viet Nam \ncomponent $11.11 million equivalent, including taxes and duties of $589,000.

The  SPSC,  with  representatives  from  LNTA  and  MCST,  will  be  established  to  oversee \nproject  implementation  subregion-wide.  Directors  general  of  LNTA  and  MCST,  or  more  senior \nofficials, will alternately chair the SPSC. Representatives from NTOs of the other GMS countries \nwill  be  invited  to  discuss  the  lessons  from  the  demonstration  subprojects  and  the  potential  to \nreplicate  them.  MTCO  will  act  as  the  secretariat  of  the  SPSC.  National  project  steering \ncommittees (NPSC) will be established in each participating country to provide policy guidance, \nand  oversee  project  implementation  nationally.  The  committees  will  be  chaired  by  a  senior \nofficial  of  director  general  level  in  the  EA,  and  their  memberships  will  include  representatives \nfrom  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  offices  of  GMS \ncoordinators,  and  participating  provinces.  In  Viet  Nam,  the  NPSC  will  also  include  the  State \nBank of Viet Nam and in Lao PDR, the members will include the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. \n \n44. \nIn each participating country, a PCU has been established within the EA and headed by a \nproject director. The project director will be assisted by a deputy director and five staff who will be \nresponsible for project accounting; monitoring and evaluation; environment, natural and cultural \nheritage, gender, and other social issues.  The PCUs will be responsible for (i) coordinating the \nProject; (ii) selecting and managing consultants, including for external monitoring of resettlement \nimpacts;  (iii)  submitting  all  necessary  data  to  the  auditor  on  time  and  the  audited  financial \nstatements  of  project  accounts  to  ADB;  (iv)  carrying  out  project  monitoring  and  evaluation;  \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n(v)  consolidating  project  reports  to  be  submitted  to  ADB  and  the  Government;  and  (vi) \ncoordinating with the other PCU, MTCO, and the NTOs of other GMS countries. In the Lao PDR, \nthe  PCU  will  be  responsible  for  carrying  out  procurement.  In  Lao  PDR,  the  PCU  will  also  be \nresponsible  for  carrying  out  Procurement.  The  PCUs  will  be  supported  by  international  and \nnational consultants. \n \n45. \nPIUs  established  in  each  participating  province  will  be  responsible  for  implementing, \ncoordinating, monitoring, and reporting project activities at the provincial level under PCU guidance. \nIn Viet Nam, the PIUs will be responsible for carrying out procurement. They will be headed by a \nprovincial project director and include a project manager and five other staff who will be responsible \nfor  project  accounting;  monitoring  and  evaluation;  environment,  natural  and  cultural  heritage, \ngender,  and  other  social  issues.  A  provincial  project  steering  committee  will  be  established  to \nrepresent agencies in charge of natural and cultural heritage site management, urban environment, \npublic  works,  and  transportation,  as  well  as  district  authorities.  Community  tourism  groups \nrepresenting stakeholders in the local community will be established for each subproject. Details on \nthe project management are in Appendix 9.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  5  years  from  1  January  2009  to  31 \n\n \n46. \nDecember 2013. An implementation schedule is presented in Appendix 10. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n47.  Works, goods, and services to be financed by ADB will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The PCU in the Lao PDR \nand  the  PIUs  in  Viet  Nam  will  be  responsible  for  procuring  works,  goods,  and  services \nprovincially. Each procurement package for works will not exceed $1.5 million. Procurement for \nworks will follow the national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures of the participating countries \nthat  are  acceptable  to  ADB.  NCB  procedures  will  be  followed  for  materials  and  equipment \npackages  estimated  to  cost  between  $100,000  and  $500,000  equivalent.  Equipment  and \nmaterials  that  are  locally  available  and  cost  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  may  be  procured \nthrough shopping. Any procurement of works, goods, and services of not more than $10,000 will \nbe  done  through  direct  contracting.  The  first  two  contracts  for  works  in  each  province  will  be \nsubject to ADB approval. Subsequently, the PCUs and PIUs will maintain specified documents17 \nfor review by ADB. A draft procurement plan is provided in Appendix 11. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n48. \nTo  support  the  implementation  of  the  Project,  250.5  person-months  of  consulting \nservices (78.5 person-months international and 172 person-months national) will be required for \nthe  Lao  PDR  and  226.5  person-months  (50.5  person-months  international  and  176  person-\nmonths  national)  for  Viet  Nam  to  assist  project  management,  resettlement,  and  gender  and \nenvironment  matters,  as  well  as  to  supervise  the  design  and  construction  of  tourism \ninfrastructure.  In  addition,  the  consultants  will  deliver  on-the-job  training  and  capacity  building \nprograms for PIUs and PCUs. They will be engaged in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  In  the  Lao  PDR,  individual \nconsultants  will  assist  the  PCU  and  PIUs  in  project  management,  and  a  firm  will  supervise  the \ndetailed design of infrastructure. In Viet Nam, a firm will be selected to assist the PCU and PIUs in \nproject  management  and  the  detailed  design  of  tourism-related  infrastructure,  and  a  different  firm \nwill be recruited  to  assist  the  PIUs  in  supervising  civil  works. The  firms  will  be selected  using  the \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  method,  and  the  weighting  will  follow  the  standard  quality\u2013cost \n                                                 \n17 These  include  bid  invitation  letters,  bid  opening  statements,  bid  evaluation  reports  or  approval  documents,  and \n\ncontracts. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nratio  of  80:20.  Additional  individual  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  each  country  for  external \nmonitoring  of  resettlement  impacts  and  project  external  monitoring.  All  consultants  will  be \nlocated  in  the  PCUs.  Two  training  institutions  in  each  participating  country  will  be  recruited  to \nprovide training under output 4 using the consultants qualification selection procedure. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n49. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  governments  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant and loan regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EAs  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  and  other  service \nproviders as they relate to the Project.  \n \nThe  Project  incorporates  several  other  measures  in  addition  to  the  standard  ADB \n50. \nrequirements to deter corruption and increase transparency. The Project will (i) build capacity in \nthe EAs, PCUs, and PIUs to understand and comply with ADB and government procedures as \noutlined  in  the  project  administration  manual  and  (ii)  widely  publicize  in  communities  in  the \nproject area the existence of the integrity division in ADB\u2019s Office of the Auditor General, as the \ninitial point of contact for allegations of fraud, corruption, and abuse in ADB-financed projects. A \nproject  website  will  be  developed  to  disclose  information  about  project  matters,  including \nprocurement. To encourage more stakeholder vigilance as well as ensure greater accountability, \na  task  force  will  be  set  up  in  the  PCUs  to  receive  and  resolve  grievances  or  act  upon \nstakeholders\u2019  reports  of  irregularities.  The  task  force  will  (i)  review  and  address  stakeholders\u2019 \ngrievances  against  the  Project  in  relation  to  the  Project  itself,  any  service  provider,  or  any \nperson responsible for carrying out the Project and (ii) set the threshold criteria and procedures \nfor  handling  such  grievances,  proactively  responding  to  them,  and  providing  the  stakeholders \nwith notice of the mechanism. The community tourist group will be a member of the procurement \ncommittee  for  subprojects  handled  by  the  PIUs  to  ensure  transparency  in  the  awarding  of \ncontracts  at  the  provincial  and  community  level.  Finally,  external  monitoring  consultants  will  be \nrecruited to monitor resettlement impacts and project implementation. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n51. \nThe payment of eligible expenditures from the proceeds of the grant and the loan will be \nmade  either  through  direct  payment  or  imprest  account  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement  Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). An imprest account will \nbe established for the Project in each participating country. In the Lao PDR, the imprest account \nwill  be  established  by  the  Government  at  the  Bank  of  Lao  PDR.  In  Viet  Nam,  the  imprest \naccount will be established by the Government at a commercial bank designated by the State \nBank  of  Viet  Nam  and  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  initial  advances  to,  and  the  ceiling  of,  each \nimprest account will be based on estimated expenditures to be funded from the imprest account \nfor  the  first  6  months  or  10%  of  the  total  ADB  grant  or  loan  amount,  whichever  is  less.  The \nimprest accounts will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  between  each \nparticipating  country\u2019s  government  and  ADB.  The  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be \nused  to  reimburse  and  liquidate  eligible  expenditures  under  contracts  not  exceeding  $50,000. \nThe PCUs and PIUs will each set up an account specifically for the Project. The accounts may \nbe  opened  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  each  participating  country\u2019s  government  and \nADB. In Viet Nam, any advance payment and subsequent replenishments to the PIUs\u2019 accounts \nwill be made directly from the imprest account. The funds flow mechanisms are in Appendix 12. \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n52. \nThe PCUs and PIUs will maintain project accounts exclusively established for the Project. \nA  separate  accounting  system  for  project  expenditures  will  be  established  and  maintained  in \naccordance with sound accounting principles. The consultants will provide training on the use of \nthe  imprest  accounts  and  operating  support  to  PCUs  and  PIUs  accounting  staff.  All  project \naccounts  will  be  audited  annually  as  part  of  the  regular  audit  by  an  independent  auditor \nacceptable  to  ADB,  using  international  accounting  and  auditing  standards.  A  separate  audit \nopinion  will  be  issued  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedures.  The  consolidated  audit  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  6  months  of  the \nclose  of  each  participating  government's  fiscal  year.  The  audit  opinion  will  include  (i)  an \nassessment  of  the  adequacy  of  accounting  and  internal  control  systems  regarding  project \nexpenditures  and  transactions  to  ensure  the  safe  custody  of  project-financed  assets;  (ii)  a \ndetermination  as  to  whether  the  Government,  the  PCU,  and  participating  provinces  have \nmaintained  adequate  documentation  for  all  financial  transactions,  specifically  including \nstatement of expenditure and imprest account procedures; and (iii) confirmation of compliance \nwith the project financial management system and ADB requirements for project management.  \n \n53. \nThe PIUs will submit quarterly reports and data to their PCU within 15 days of the end of \neach  quarter.  Each  PCU  will  (i)  collect  and  consolidate  all  project  progress  reports,  site  reports, \ntechnical reports, and financial reports and (ii) prepare quarterly progress reports within 30 days of \nthe end of each quarter and submit them to ADB. The quarterly reports will include (i) a narrative \ndescription  of  progress  made  during  the  reporting  period;  (ii)  modifications,  if  any,  to  the \nimplementation  schedule;  (iii)  details  of  land  use  and  resettlement;  (iv)  information  on  preparing \nand implementing initial environmental examinations (IEEs); (v) progress on the implementation of \nthe gender action plan and the ethnic minority development framework; (vi) major project activities \nby the PCU, PIUs, and training institutions; (vii) financial and procurement-related information; (viii) \nproblems  experienced  and  remedial  actions  proposed;  (ix)  the  work  to  be  carried  out  during  the \nupcoming  reporting  period;  (x)  progress  on  the  grant  or  loan  covenants,  and  (xi)  a  summary  of \nexpenditures during the quarter, year-to-date expenditures, and total expenditures. Each PCU will \nsubmit to ADB, within 3 months of project completion, a project completion report that will cover the \ndetails of project implementation, achievement of outputs and outcome, compliance with covenants, \nimplementation  of  environmental  and  social  safeguards,  and  other  information  that  ADB  may \nrequest. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nA comprehensive project performance monitoring system (PPMS) has been prepared. A \n54. \nset of PPMS indicators have been developed. The PPMS will be integrated into the information \nmanagement system of the NTOs and the provincial tourism departments so that the monitoring \nof  social  and  economic  benefits  can  continue  after  project  completion.  The  PIUs  in  each \nprovince  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  PPMS  is  implemented  and  updated,  in \nconsultation with the local communities, to (i) examine the Project\u2019s technical performance, (ii) \nevaluate  the  delivery  of  planned  facilities,  (iii)  assess  the  achievement  of  project  outputs  and \noutcome,  (iv)  ensure  compliance  with  social  safeguards,  and  (v)  measure  project  benefits. \nAnnual PPMS reports will be prepared by each PIU, consolidated by the PCUs, and submitted \nto  ADB.  The  integrated  system  for  managing,  monitoring,  and  evaluating  project  impacts, \noutcome, and outputs accords with ADB\u2019s Project Performance Monitoring System Handbook. \n \n55. \nProject  outputs  will  be  monitored  in  the  regular  course  of  the  Project  in  terms  of \nefficiency (quantities delivered, people trained, and meetings) and effectiveness (quality of the \ngoods and services delivered). The PPMS will generate data on the immediate effects and the \nbroader impacts of project investments on socioeconomic development, poverty reduction, and \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nthe  degree  to  which  women  and  vulnerable  groups  participate  and  benefit.  A  baseline  survey \nwill  be  carried  out  in  selected  communities  in  each  province  at  the  start  of  activities.  Data \ncollection will be organized by the PIUs through villages and communes and will be stored in a \ndatabase  maintained  by  the  PIUs  and  PCUs.  A  monitoring  and  evaluation  expert  will  provide \nguidelines and training on the design and maintenance of these databases. Monitoring data and \nindicators will be disaggregated, where possible, by sex, ethnicity, and income. In addition to the \nnormal  PPMS,  an  individual  consultant  will  be  recruited  in  each  country  for  external  benefit \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  thereby  independently  assessing  project  effectiveness.  The  PCUs \nwill  appoint  an  independent  external  monitor  acceptable  to  ADB  for  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement (LAR).  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \nThe  NTOs  and  ADB  will  conduct  joint  project  reviews  at  least  twice  a  year  and  a \n56. \ncomprehensive  project  review  about  30  months  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  comprehensive \nproject  review  will  evaluate  the  (i)  the  actual  progress  toward  achieving  the  project  outputs  in \neach  province,  (ii)  implementation  procedures,  (iii)  feedback  from  PPMS  activities,  (iv) \nfunctioning  and  performance  of  the  PCUs  and  PIUs,  (v)  performance  of  consultants,  and  (vi) \nfinancial performance and cost recovery of tourism subprojects.  \n \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nIV. \n \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\nA. \n \n57. \nSocial  Benefits  and  Beneficiaries.  Improved  tourism-related  infrastructure  brings \nsocial  benefits  to  local  residents  and  tourists.  The  Project  will  directly  benefit  60,000  people: \n35,000 in the Lao PDR and 25,000 in Viet Nam. An estimated 145,000 people in the Lao PDR \nand 155,000 people in Viet Nam will be indirect beneficiaries. The pro-poor, community-based, \nsupply-chain tourism subprojects under output 2 are expected to benefit the largest number of \npoor  households.  The  Project  will  improve  the  quality  of  tourism  SME\u2019s  operations  and  public \nofficials\u2019 pro-poor planning and management. About 180 master trainers, 400 trainers, and 800 \ngovernment officials working in tourism-related institutions will be trained, of which 40% will be \nwomen  and  30%  will  be  from  participating  provinces  and  districts  with  a  high  percentage  of \nethnic  minority  residents.  Human  resource  development,  especially  for  trainers  of  personnel \nworking  in  tourism  SMEs,  will  improve  the  quality  of  service  and  the  competitiveness  of  the \nsector  and  provide  new  employment  opportunities  and  higher  salaries  for  trainers  and \nemployees. The pro-poor, community-based tourism subprojects will involve poor communities \nin  the  tourism  economy  while  protecting  ethnic  minority  cultures  and  minimizing  the  adverse \nimpacts of tourism, especially on vulnerable groups such as women, youths and the elderly. It \nwill provide local communities with alternative means of livelihood to supplement their income. \nThe  Project  will  train  village  guides  employed  by  tour  companies  as  cultural  and  nature \ninterpreters,  assist  communities  in  setting  up  income-earning  home-stays  and  community \nlodges,  support  producers  of  handicrafts  to  improve  their  quality  and  techniques  for  selling  to \ntourists, and support  traditional arts and cultural performances. \n \n58. \nEconomic  Benefits. Economic analysis has been undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nguidelines,  including  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects  (1997),  Handbook  for \nIntegrating Poverty Impact Assessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects, and Guidelines for \nIntegrating Risk Analysis in the Economic Analysis of Projects. The analyses included examining \nalternatives and least-cost analysis of project development options. Calculations of the economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  and  sensitivity  analyses  have  been  undertaken  for  the  four \nsubprojects  under  output  1,  a  sample  pro-poor  tourism  development  subproject  under  output  2, \nand the NSEC under output 3. The analysis found that the EIRRs for the six subprojects range \nfrom  16.6%  for  the  pro-poor  tourism  subproject  to  22.8%  for  the  subproject  in  Phang  Nha  Ke \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nBang. The EIRRs are more sensitive to reductions in the number of tourists than to increases in \ncosts,  but  all  subprojects  remain  reasonably  robust.  Developing  tourism  corridors  will  create \neconomic opportunities for local communities located along them to establish tourism enterprises, \nlengthen the time tourists spend in the subregion, and generate jobs. Governments will be able to \ncollect more taxes that can be used to improve community facilities and services. The improved \ninfrastructure required for tourism can be used by local residents, and tourism can stimulate the \nexpansion  of  such  economic  activities  as  fishing,  farming,  handicraft  production,  and  other \nmanufacturing. Tourism stimulates the development of new and improved cultural and commercial \nfacilities that can be used by local residents and tourists. Increased tourism will provide financial \nresources  for  the  conservation  of  important  natural  areas,  historical  sites,  and  cultural  traditions \nand  arts.  The  Project  will  raise  the  service  standards  of  personnel  in  small-scale  hospitality \nestablishments in the participating countries that will make the tourism industry more competitive. \n \nFinancial  Benefits.  Financial  analysis  has  been  undertaken  for  the  four  subprojects \n59. \nunder output 1 and for the NSEC under output 3, based on the least-cost options identified in \nthe economic analysis. The analysis sought to assess if the subprojects can generate sufficient \nrevenues  from  entrance  fees  or  user  charges  and  retain  them  to  pay  for  the  O&M  of  project \nfacilities  to  ensure  their  financial  sustainability.  Cost-recovery  mechanisms  under  the  Project \ninclude the establishment or expansion of entrance fees to three of the subprojects (Siphandone, \nPhang Nha Ke Bang, and Bac Kan) and sites along the NSEC, as well as an environmental fee \nfor tourists staying in Vang Vieng town. From 2012, the subprojects will impose or increase the \nfees. It is conservatively assumed that demand between 2016 and 2020 will not increase over \nthat  of  2015.  The  analysis  concluded  that  the  subprojects  will  generate  sufficient  income  from \ntourists to pay for the O&M of the facilities and obtain modest surpluses, which can be invested \nin the project sites. Sensitivity analyses prepared for each project concluded that cash flows are \nmore sensitive to a reduction in the number of tourists than to an increase in O&M costs.  \n \n60. \nEnvironmental  Impacts.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B.  It  is \ndesigned to improve residents\u2019 quality of life and the physical environment. IEEs were prepared \nfor each of the two subprojects under output 1 for each country. IEEs for the likely interventions \nunder  components  2  and  3  were  prepared  for  each  country.  Because  infrastructure \ninterventions  will  be  small,  the  likely  environmental  impacts  will  be  temporary,  minor,  and \nlocalized. They can be minimized to acceptable levels with mitigation measures and monitoring \nprograms  identified  in  the  IEEs.  Environmental  mitigation  measures  requiring  action  by  the \ncontractors  will  be  incorporated  into  contracts  for  civil  works.  Environmental  assessment  and \nreview  frameworks  (EARF)  were  prepared  for  each  country  to  provide  adequate  guidance  for \nPCUs  and  PIUs  in  screening  subprojects,  determine  appropriate  mitigation  for  any  negative \nimpacts  identified,  and  implement  environmental  management  and  monitoring  during  project \nimplementation  and  beyond.  For  small-scale  infrastructure  interventions  to  be  identified  under \ncomponents  2  and  3,  a  cluster  of  IEEs  will  be  prepared  for  each  participating  province  to \ndocument  the  screening  results  of  all  interventions.  If  any  of  the  screening  results  indicate  a \nneed  for  further  environmental  analysis,  individual  IEEs  will  be  prepared  for  each  intervention \nthat requires further analysis and submitted to ADB for review prior to awarding the civil works \ncontract. A summary IEE for the Lao PDR is in Appendix 13. The summary IEE for Viet Nam, all \nremaining IEEs, and the EARFs are in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n61. \nResettlement Impacts. Efforts have been made to minimize and, where possible, avoid \nLAR.  However,  minimal  LAR  with  relatively  small  impacts  is  required:  relocating  a  few \nhouseholds,  temporarily  relocating  businesses,  and  using  public  land  for  the  construction  of \nsmall  markets,  parking  lots,  covered  bus  stops,  river  landings  and  stairs,  cultural  and \ninterpretation  centers,  refreshment  stands,  walkways,  footbridges,  toilets  with  water  supply, \nticket  booths,  lodges,  prayer  pavilions,  and  signage.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995) and Handbook on Resettlement, resettlement frameworks for each \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nRisks \n\nparticipating  country  and  short  resettlement  plans  for  the  subprojects  in  the  Siphandone \nWetland  (Lao  PDR)  and  Phong  Nga  Khe  Bang  (Viet  Nam)  have  been  prepared  based  on  an \ninventory of losses and socioeconomic surveys, including focus-group discussions with affected \npeople and provincial authorities. One household will lose about 900 square meters of land to \nthe  subproject  in  Phong  Nga  Khe  Bang  National  Park,  and  the  subproject  in  the  Siphadone \nWetland  will  temporarily  affect  28  stall  owners  and  require  three  households  to  be  relocated. \nAffected people will be compensated for their losses at full replacement cost at current market \nprices  and  provided  with  transition  allowances  and  rehabilitation.  Additional  support  will  be \nextended  to  the  poor  and  vulnerable  and  female-headed  households.  The  resettlement \nframeworks  will  guide  planning  for  any  unforeseen  LAR  during  project  implementation.  An \ninternational resettlement consultant for each country will build capacity in the PCUs and PIUs. \nThe summary resettlement plan and framework is in Appendix 14. \n \nB. \n \n62.  Market  Risks.  Project  benefits  will  depend  on  the  number  of  tourists  visiting  the  sites, \nwhich  could  fall  in  response  to  weak  marketing  strategies;  low  quality  of  service;  site \ndeterioration from  weak  O&M; or external factors such as epidemics, terror attacks, or natural \ndisasters. To mitigate these risks, (i) tourism demand analyses and projections were prepared \nusing conservative assumptions and tourism surveys at project sites; (ii) each agency in charge \nof  the  O&M  of  facilities  will  prepare  and  maintain  a  business  plan  for  risk  management, \nespecially regarding market demand; and (iii) marketing and promotion for each subproject will \nhelp meet demand targets.  \n \n63. \nProject  Implementation  Risks.  These  include  delays  in  implementation  and  cost \noverruns.  They  can  result  from  weak  planning,  management,  administrative  capability,  or \nprocedures.  These  risks  have  been  mitigated  by  developing  clearly  defined  and  standardized \nprocedures  and  providing  significant  technical  support  and  training  to  the  implementing \nagencies  during  implementation.  The  risk  of cost  overruns  has  been  mitigated  through  careful \nand detailed cost estimation based on the experience of the MTDP.  \n \n64. \nSocial  and  Environmental  Risks.  Uncontrolled  tourism  development  can  cause \ncongestion,  pollution,  the  illegal  trafficking  of  people,  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS,  and  the \ndeterioration of destinations. Over-commercialization of cultural traditions may degrade cultural \nheritage  and  the  cultural  identity  of  small  ethnic  groups.  To  minimize  these  risks,  tourism \nplanning and management plans for each of the subprojects, based on careful assessment of \ncarrying  capacity,  will  be  prepared  and  monitored  through  the  PPMS,  while  assessments  and \nspecific  actions  will  be  implemented  to  ensure  that  ethnic  groups/minorities  benefit  from,  and \nare not disadvantaged by, tourism.

The meeting should be chaired by \na senior member of the Executing Agency to ensure that there is political support \nand  an  understanding  of  the  project  among  senior  decision  makers  nationally \nand provincially. \nThe  6-month  action  plans  of  the  Project  should  be  given  priority  funding  in  a \nflexible  approval  framework  to  ensure  strong  counterpart  commitment  and \nmorale and momentum in project implementation. \nClear  and  effective  project  implementation  planning  and  reporting  systems  and \nforms in the local language need to be developed at the beginning of the Project. \nA  manual  of  procedures  for  administering  small  contracts  and  a  standardized \ncontract  format  acceptable  to  ADB  and  the  government  of  each  participating \ncountry needs to be prepared. \nIn the PCU and PIUs, a finance officer and an accountant should be contracted \nand  given  adequate  training  to  ensure  that  financial  reporting  to  ADB  and \nnational governments is properly managed. \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Training  on  project  procedures,  especially  financial  management,  should  be \nprovided  to  PCUs  and  PIUs.  Follow-up  audits  and  refresher  courses conducted \nby  an  international  or  national  consultant  familiar  with  ADB  and  government \nfinancial procedures should be undertaken throughout the course of the Project. \nA  communications  plan  to  publicize  the  project  outcome  and  outputs  to  other \nstakeholders  and  the  public  in  general  should  be  developed  during  the  first  6 \nmonths of the project and implemented as part of the project\u2019s awareness-raising \nactivities. \nThe  Project  should  actively  seek  partnerships  with  other  development  partners, \nand standard agreements should be prepared in advance and incorporated into \nthe implementation plan of the Project and manuals of procedures. \nLeaders of national tourism organizations should establish a mentoring program \nwhere  experienced  staffers  partner  with  junior  staffers  to  teach  them  how  to \neffectively manage large, donor-financed projects. \n\n(xi) \n\n(x) \n\n(xii)  Well-defined  job  descriptions  and  wide  advertising  of  PCU  and  PIU  positions \nshould  be  prepared  to  ensure  that  competent  people  are  recruited  to  fill  project \npositions.  Additional  financial  compensation  for  counterpart  staff  should  be \nprovided as an incentive. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n31\n\n(xiii)  Attention  needs  to  be  paid  to  recruiting  international  consultants  that  can  work \neffectively in the environment and culture of the participating countries. Detailed \nterms of reference with clearly defined job and ideal candidate descriptions need \nto be prepared. \n\n(xv) \n\n(xiv)  The selection of pro-poor tourism interventions for assistance should adhere to a \nset  of  criteria  that  includes  the  development  of  tourist  attractions,  tour  circuits, \nand value chain interventions. \nTo  avoid  spreading  resources  too  thin,  the  Project  should  aim  to  develop  one \nmodel suite of pro-poor interventions in each participating province that includes \nthe  development  of  a  tour  site  that  can  be  operated  by  the  local  community,  a \ntour  circuit  that  is  operated  as  a  public-private-community  partnership,  and  one \nvalue chain intervention. \n\n(xvi)  The  Project  should  promote  the  establishment  of  provincial  inbound  tour \noperators to raise the number of distribution outlets that develop and market local \ntour circuits and destinations.  \n\n(xvii)  To  ensure  that  local  people  retain  ownership  of  tourism  resources  and  have \naccess  to  income-generating  opportunities,  the  Project  should  work  with \ncommunities  and  government  authorities  to  train  and  allow  local  people  to \noperate  tourist  attractions  under  formal  management  agreements  or  community \nconcessions. \n\n(xviii)  To  help  the  PIUs,  communities,  and  local  authorities  establish  community-\nconcessions,  the  Project  should  develop  a  set  of  standard  procedures  and \nguidelines for doing so. \n(xix)  When  communities  operate \n\ntourist  attractions  under \n\nformal  management \nagreements,  community  concessions,  or  public-private-community  partnerships, \nmechanisms  must  be  in  place  to  ensure  that  a  portion  of  financial  benefits \nreaches the poorest members of the community. Some ways to accomplish this \nare to provide an annual dividend payments to each family or direct a portion of \ntourism  revenues  into  village  funds  that  can  be  accessed  by  the  entire \ncommunity. \nEncouraging  international  and  domestic  investors  to  construct  nature  resorts  in \nremote  areas  creates  employment  opportunities  for  the  poor  and  demand  for \nagricultural  products,  handicrafts,  labor,  building  materials,  transportation,  and \nother  tourism-related  services  that  the  poor  can  provide.  The  Project  should \nactively promote this type of investment. \n\n(xx) \n\n(xxi)  Pro-poor  tourism  subprojects  require  substantial  investments  in  awareness \nraising,  training,  capacity  building,  and  marketing  and  promotion.  The  Project \nshould allocate a significant portion of resources to these tasks. \n\n(xxii)  Approaches  to  sustainable  tourism  development  that  are  gender  sensitive  and \ninclusive of ethnic groups, youths, and the disadvantaged should be set out in a \nstrategy and mainstreamed into project activities by a dedicated social specialist \nin each PIU. \n\n(xxiii)  The  project  must  allocate  adequate  resources  to  implement  a  performance \nmonitoring and evaluation system that allows the PCUs and PIUs to identify and \ncorrect  mistakes  as  well  as  gather  information  on  successful  initiatives  that  can \nbe communicated to senior decision makers and the public at large. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nSUBPROJECTS\u2019 SELECTION CRITERIA \n\n \nThe  Sustainable  Tourism  Development  Project  (the  Project)  employs  two  sets  of \n1. \nselection and evaluation criteria: (i) one set used during project preparation to select the current \nlist  of  subprojects  under  the  project  outputs  and  (ii)  another  set  to  be  used  during  project \nimplementation to (a) prioritize the demonstration subprojects under outputs 2 and 3; (b) select \ntraining  institutions  for  implementing  output  4;  and  (c)  chose  the  group  of  master  trainers, \ntrainers of trainers, and public officials to receive training in output 4.  \n \nA. \n\nSelection and Evaluation Criteria During Project Preparation \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \nDuring  project  preparation,  a  set  of  selection  criteria  was  applied  to  a  long  list  of more \nthan  120  candidate  subprojects.  In  the  Lao  PDR,  the  criteria  helped  to  prioritize  the  two \nsubprojects  selected  under  output  1,  six  provinces  under  output  2,  and  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) north\u2013south and east\u2013west economic corridors under output 3. In Viet Nam, \nthe  criteria  helped  to  prioritize  two  subprojects  under  output  1,  five  provinces  under  output  2, \nand the GMS east\u2013west economic corridor under output 3. The criteria also helped to prioritize \ntwo training programs for both the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and Viet Nam \nunder output 4.  \n \nB. \n\nSelection and Evaluation Criteria During Project Implementation \n\nPro-Poor, Community-Based, Supply-Chain Tourism Subproject Sites. The Project \n3. \nwill select a complimentary combination of pro-poor interventions in each province, including at \nleast (i) one standalone individual tourist attraction such as a waterfall, cave, or historic site; (ii) \none tour circuit such as a trekking route or tour; and (iii) one value chain involving a cluster of \nvillages producing goods and services such as agricultural goods or handicrafts. The estimated \ncost  of  infrastructure  at  each  site  shall  be  about  $100,000  in  the  Lao  PDR  and  $110,000\u2013\n$150,000  in  Viet  Nam.  The  infrastructure  may  include,  but  is  not  limited  to,  markets,  viewing \npoints,  walking  trails  and  signage,  information  and  visitor  centers,  access  and  parking,  river \npiers,  community  lodges,  sanitary  facilities,  and  the  development  of  natural  sites  within  a  pro-\npoor, community-based tourism-development framework. \n \n4. \n\nThe selection of sites will be determined by the following set of criteria:  \n(i) \n\nThe  area  should  include  a  cluster  of  villages  and  communities  in  a  district  or \nprovince centered around a staging town as gateway and main dormitory.  \nIt shall be safe and secure from internal and external threats and dangers (e.g., \ngroup conflicts, unexploded ordnance, etc.). \nIt  should  be  accessible  by  an  existing  road  within  5  km,  which  may  require  a \nsmall investment for minor upgrading to enhance access.  \nIt  should  include  many  people  living  below  the  poverty  line,  especially  in  small \nand/or minority communities.  \nIt should have a mix of natural and cultural tourism attractions of strong interest \nto tourist markets.  \nAn  existing  flow  of  tourists  should  already  exist,  which  can  be  enhanced  with \nmodest interventions and generate substantial additional income.  \nStrong  and  proven  market  demand  should  exist  for  the  type  of  product  that  will \nbe developed.  \n\n(viii)  Tourist  attractions  should  include  many  local  community  stakeholders  whose \n\ntourist-hosting skills require strengthening.  \nAgencies in charge should have capacity to implement and operate the Project.  \nConsent  and  agreement  should  be  reached  with  participating  communities  to \nenter into a joint-management contract for operating and managing the site once \nit is developed. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n(x) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n33\n\n(xi) \n\nStrong  support  and  commitment  must  come  from  key  stakeholders  (e.g.,  local \ncommunities,  tourism  and  related  agencies,  private  tour  operators  and  carriers, \nand development partners and nongovernment organizations).  \n\n(xii)  Cost-recovery  mechanisms  for  recurrent  operating  costs  should  be  in  place,  or \n\nthere should be a clear willingness to put them in place.  \n\n(xiii)  No significant land acquisition or resettlement should be required, in accordance \n\nwith the land acquisition and resettlement framework for the Project.1  \n\n(xiv)  No relocation of small or minority villages should be required, in accordance with \nthe country-specific ethnic minority development framework for the Project. \n(xv)  No  significant  environmental  impacts  are  associated  with  the  intervention  in \naccordance with the Project\u2019s environmental assessment and review framework.  \n\n \n5. \nThese  criteria  will  be  used  for  screening  and  is  complemented  by  a  number  of  other \nevaluating steps, especially local communities\u2019 willingness to participate. Some of the steps are \nhighlighted  in  the  detailed  project  description  and  implementation  manual  in  Supplementary \nAppendix G.  \n \n6. \nGMS  Tourism  Corridor  Subproject  Sites.  Subprojects  sites  along  the  north\u2013south \neconomic corridor (NSEC) and east\u2013west economic corridor (EWEC) may include, but are not \nlimited  to,  markets,  viewing  points,  walking  trails  and  signage,  information  and  visitor  centers, \naccess  and  parking,  river  piers,  community  lodges,  sanitary  facilities,  and  the  development  of \nnatural sites. The sites will be selected according to of the following criteria:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nSmall-scale  improvements  (e.g.,  scenic  viewpoints)  shall  be  done  along  the \nNSEC  and  EWEC  to  enhance  tourist  attractions  or  shall  be  adjacent  to  both \neconomic corridors (i.e., within 10 km of the main road along an existing access \nroad).  The  total  number  of  improvements  along  the  NSEC  and  EWEC  is \nundefined, but the cost for each small-scale infrastructure improvement shall not \nexceed $150,000 in the Lao PDR or $180,000 in Viet Nam. \nThe area shall be safe and secure from internal and external threats and dangers \n(e.g., group conflicts, unexploded ordnance, etc.). \nAgencies in charge of the site should have the capacity to implement and operate \nthe Project.  \nStrong support and commitment should come from key stakeholders (e.g., local \ncommunities,  tourism  and  related  agencies,  private  tour  operators  and  carriers, \nand development partners and nongovernment organizations).  \nConsent and agreement must be obtained from the ministry responsible for road \noperations  and  maintenance  to  develop  roadside  viewing  points  and  construct \ncommon signage along the NSEC and EWEC. \nNo significant land acquisition or resettlement should be required, in accordance \nwith the land acquisition and resettlement framework for the Project.2 \n\n(vii)  No  relocation  of  any  small  or  minority  village  should  be  required  for  tourism \ndevelopment,  in  accordance  with  the  ethnic  minorities  development  framework \nfor the Project.  \n\n(viii)  No significant environmental impacts associated with the intervention should be \nrequired, in accordance with the Project\u2019s environmental assessment and review \nframework. \n\n \n7. \nSelection  of  the  Training  Institution. Two training institutions will be selected in each \ncountry under output 4 by the consultant qualification selection procedure. One will train master \n                                                 \n1   Fewer  than  200  people  will  experience  major  impacts,  which  are  defined  as  being  physically  displaced  from \nhousing or losing 10% or more of their income-generating assets. This is the threshold applied for the entire output, \ncontaining up to 2\u20133 sites per province (total of about 15 sites). \n\n2  Major impacts are defined in footnote 2. The threshold is applied for the entire output, containing up to seven sites \n\nalong the NSEC and one site along the EWEC in the  Lao PDR and ten sites along the EWEC in Viet Nam. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\ntrainers and trainers of trainers in small-scale tourism and hospitality operation, while the other \nwill train public officials in pro-poor tourism planning and management. A set of criteria has been \ndeveloped  and  will  be  refined  during  implementation  by  the  human  resource  development \nspecialist. The training institution shall  \n\nbe an existing vocational training and education institution in the Lao PDR or Viet \nNam  with  at  least  5  years  of  demonstrated  experience  in  delivering  training \nprograms in tourism development;  \nhave  sufficient  classrooms,  accommodation,  staff,  and  teaching  facilities  to \ndeliver  the  specified  training  and  demonstrate  its  commitment  to  improving  the \nquality of its training facilities and programs to accommodate the human resource \ndevelopment output for this Project;  \nbe one of the GMS tourism training and education institutions and/or be willing to \naccommodate interested trainees from other GMS countries;  \nbe accessible to all participating project provinces; \nhave  a  partnership  with  an  international  training  institution,  if  necessary,  which \nwill help train the master trainers in English; and  \nhave demonstrated its ability to manage training courses in English. \n\n \n8. \nSelection  of  Master  Trainers,  Trainers  of  Trainers,  and  Public  Officials.  Each \ntraining course under output 4 will train a group of master trainers that will then train a group of \nadditional trainers or public officials in the tourism sector or related field. \n\nThe training on small-scale tourism and hospitality operation will focus on training \n40 master trainers in each country. \nScholarships for 40 master trainers (20 in the Lao PDR and 20 in Viet Nam) will \nbe  available,  of  which  at  least  50%  shall  be  for  qualified  women  and  30%  for \nqualified men or women from provinces with high ethnic minority representation \n(e.g., Bac Kan and Cao Bang). \nThe  master  trainers  will  train  up  to  200  trainers  in  each  country  from  small  and \nmedium-sized enterprises (e.g., guesthouses or restaurants) in villages, districts, \nand provinces in the project area. At least 40% of these trainers shall be women, \nand about 30% of the trainers shall be qualified men and women from provinces \nor districts with high ethnic minority representation. \nThe training of public officials in tourism or tourism-related sectors will focus on \ntraining 50 master trainers in each country, who will train up to 400 public officials \nfrom project provinces in each country. \nScholarships for 60 public official master trainers (30 in the Lao PDR and 30 in \nViet Nam) will be available, of which 50% shall be for qualified women and 30% \nfrom  provinces  with  high  ethnic  minority \nfor  qualified  men  or  women \nrepresentation (e.g., Bac Kan and Cao Bang). \nAbout 400 public officials in the Lao PDR and 400 public officials in Viet Nam will \nbe  selected  to  attend  training  courses  in  pro-poor  tourism  planning  and \nmanagement,  with  specific  topics  on  environmentally  sustainable  tourism, \nculturally  sensitive  tourism,  and  gender-inclusive  tourism.  About  40%  of  all \nofficials  trained  shall  be  women,  and  about  30%  of  all  officials  trained  shall  be \nfrom the provinces or districts with high ethnic minority representation. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n\fSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n35\n\nCountry/Project Title: Greater Mekong Subregion Sustainable Tourism Development \n\nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\nProject Loan and Grant \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nSoutheast Asia Department/ \nSocial Sectors Division \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe Project will support pro-poor and environmentally and socially sustainable tourism development. It supports Viet \nNam\u2019s  5-year  socioeconomic  development  plan  (SEDP)  2006\u20132010  and  the  comprehensive  poverty  reduction  and \ngrowth strategy. The strategies aim for sustained annual growth of 7.5%, the elimination of hunger by 2010, and the \nhalving  of  poverty  from  2002  to  2010.  Sustainable  growth,  inclusive  social  development,  good  governance,  and \nregional cooperation in the GMS are the main priorities, and tourism is emerging as a key sector for achieving them. \nIn  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  the  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication  Strategy \n(NGPES) lists tourism as a key sector supporting growth. Cross-sector priorities include gender, information, culture, \npopulation,  social  security,  and  capacity  building,  all  key  activities  of  the  Project.  The  NGPES  aims  to  reduce  the \npercentage of poor households to 15%. \n \nIn the GMS regional cooperation strategy and program 2007\u20132009, the four key strategic pillars are (i) strengthening \nconnectivity  and  facilitating  cross-border  movement  and  tourism;  (ii)  integrating  national  markets  to  promote \neconomic efficiency and private sector development; (iii) addressing health and other social, economic, and capacity-\nbuilding  issues;  and  (iv)  managing  the  environment  and  shared  natural  resources  to  help  ensure  sustainable \ndevelopment  and  the  conservation  of  natural  resources.  The  Project  is  closely  aligned  with  all  four  pillars.  ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and program (CSP) for Viet Nam 2007\u20132010a is directly linked to supporting the SEDP\u2019s targeted \noutcomes.  Support  will  be  directed  toward  achieving  social  equity  and  improving  environmental  management. \nPromoting regional cooperation and gender development is key. The CSP 2007\u20132011 for the Lao PDRb focuses on \nsustainable economic growth, accelerating progress in non-income Millennium Development Goal (MDGs), building \ncapacity for good governance, and promoting regional cooperation and integration. \n \nIn  line  with  ADB  country  strategies,  the  Project  seeks  to  contribute  directly  to  poverty  reduction  by  locating  its \nactivities in tourist-attracting subproject sites with high levels of poverty. It promotes regional cooperation and poverty \nreduction in the GMS by developing and implementing models for sustainable and pro-poor tourism development. As \nindicated  in  the  GMS  tourism  sector  strategy  2006\u20132015,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  demonstrate  more  effective \napproaches for the sustainable use and development of natural and cultural tourism assets and spread the benefits \nof tourism more widely through pro-poor tourism initiatives. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                         Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (TI-G) \n1.  Key Issues \nViet  Nam.  Viet Nam\u2019s recent progress in socioeconomic development has been remarkable. Poverty was cut from \n58.1% in 1993 to 19.5% in 2005. During this period, income per capita grew from $288 to $622, with only a modest \nincrease  in  income  disparities.  Broad-based  economic  growth,  greater  macroeconomic  and  political  stability,  and \ntargeted  programs  for  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  have  helped  reduce  poverty.  However,  while  income  inequality \nhas increased only marginally, significant pockets of poverty remain. Households whose consumption is just over the \npoverty line are vulnerable to external shocks and remain at risk of falling back below the poverty line.  \n \nTourism is a key sector of the Vietnamese economy. It is expected to grow at over 16% per year, contributing $4.75 \nbillion to national GDP and employing 1.2 million people by 2010. This diverse and labor-intensive industry presents \nenormous opportunities for poverty reduction. In 2006, tourism receipts reached $2.4 billion (3.9% of total GDP), up \nfrom $1.2 billion in 2000. The tourism sector employs 250,000 people directly, and 500,000 people work in tourism-\nrelated businesses and industries. An expanding tourism industry will generate many jobs and provide opportunities \nfor  labor  to  shift  away  from  unproductive  agricultural  towards  services,  creating  opportunity,  achieving  higher \ndisposable incomes, and reducing poverty. \n \nLao PDR. The Lao PDR is one of the poorest countries in the Asia and Pacific region. Per capita GDP is $490, and \none  third  of  the  population  is  poor.  A  small  domestic  market,  the  subsistence  nature  of  the  rural  economy,  skills \nshortages,  and  the  remoteness  and  isolation  of  much  of  the  population  are  among  the  factors  constraining  growth \nand poverty reduction. However, the economy has grown and diversified in the past 5 years, as the Lao PDR tapped \nits  natural  resource  base  for  hydropower,  mining,  and  tourism.  The  incidence  of  poverty  fell  from  46%  to  33% \nbetween 1992 and 2003. Tourism is recognized as a key contributor to income generation and poverty reduction.  \n \nWhile  the  Lao  PDR  is  on  track  in  terms  of  meeting  the  income  MDGs  by  2015,  income  poverty  continues  to  be \nproblem  in  rural  areas,  where  the  incidence  of  poverty  is  twice  as  high  as  in  urban  areas.  Some  75%  of  poor \nhouseholds  are  in  ethnic  groups  living  in  remote  and  upland  areas  on  marginally  productive  land.  These  groups \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nsuffer high rates of infant and maternal mortality; low access to health and education services, electricity, and clean \nwater; high illiteracy; and limited involvement in the market economy. Remoteness and variation in access to basic \ninfrastructure are key reasons for the unequal regional distribution of poverty.  \n \nThe project area covers the poorest provinces in the two countries, and an estimated 30% of project beneficiaries in \nViet Nam and 44% in the Lao PDR are poor. Since these areas are prime tourist locations, there is great potential for \nthe Project to reduce the high poverty incidence and contribute to economic growth. \n \n2. Design Features \nThe Project will contribute to achieving the objective of the GMS tourism sector strategy of reducing poverty through \nsustainable  tourism  development  by  (i)  improving  livelihoods  in  poor  rural  areas  with  tourism  potential  and  (ii) \nfacilitating  pro-poor  tourism  development  and  designing  and  implementing  pro-poor  demonstration  projects  and \nsystems that can be replicated in Viet Nam, Lao PDR, and other GMS countries. The poorest people in the Project \nareas  will  benefit  significantly  from  project  interventions  through  expanded  tourism-related  opportunities,  the \ngeneration  of  new  employment  opportunities,  the  development  of  community  ownership  and  self-reliance,  reduced \nsocial and health risks through awareness programs, and a sustainable environment.  \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  pro-poor  tourism-development  activities  include  traditional  community-based  tourism  development \napproaches  combined  with  new  supply  chain  initiatives.  The  Project  will  develop  models  throughout  Viet  Nam  and \nthe Lao PDR to demonstrate ways to involve poor communities in the tourism economy and will aim to protect ethnic \ncultures and minimize the adverse impacts of tourism. The human resource development component will have a pro-\npoor  focus  and  include  training  on  developing  and  managing  small-scale  tourism  interventions  in  poor  areas  and \ntargeted capacity development for trainers from poor households and ethnic minorities. \n \nTourism  offers  new  opportunities  for  poor  and  vulnerable  groups.  Increases  in  the  number  and  duration  of  tourist \nvisits  derived  from  paved  footpaths,  improved  drainage,  visitor  information  centers  and  comfort  facilities,  signage, \nand  trained  local  guides  will  provide  poor  local  residents  with  enhanced  opportunities  to  produce  food  and  other \nservices for hotels and restaurants; set up their own stalls, eateries, and home stays; serve as construction workers \nand trekking and tourist guides; produce and sell handicrafts; improve their credit, accounting, and marketing skills; \nand  hold  traditional  cultural    performances  for  visitors.  Local  communities  will  be  encouraged  to  work  out  ways  to \nmanage and eventually collectively own their scenic resources.  \n \n\nII. SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nViet Nam. Viet Nam has made good progress in achieving the MDGs and the Viet Nam Development Goals. It has \nalready  achieved  its  poverty  targets,  halving  income  poverty  and  largely  eradicating  extreme  poverty  and  hunger. \nGood  progress  has  been  made  in  improving  access  to  primary  education,  gender  equality,  maternal  health,  and \naccess to safe drinking water. Despite these achievements, increased efforts will be required to improve the quality \nof key services, target pockets of poverty, and ensure sound and environmentally sustainable practices. \n \nAlthough  economic  growth  has  benefited  most  of  society,  some  groups  have  benefited  less  than  others.  The \nincidence of poverty remains much higher in rural areas (26.4%) than urban areas (13.7%). Food poverty has been \nlargely eliminated in urban households (3.3%), but 8.1% of rural households remain food-poor. Sixty-one percent of \nethnic  minority  households  lived  below  the  poverty  line  in  2002,  compared  with  14%  of  the  Kinh  and  Chinese \nhouseholds.  Ethnic  minority  children  are  less  educated  because  of  poor  infrastructure  and  accessibility,  language \nand cultural barriers, problems in attracting good teachers to remote areas, and curriculum irrelevance.  \n \nLao PDR. The Lao PDR lags behind on a number of non-income MDGs, as life expectancy at birth is low (61 years), \nchild malnutrition is high (30%), and rates of infant mortality (60 per 1,000 live births) and maternal mortality (350 per \n100,000  live  births)  are  very  high  compared  with  other  countries  in  the  region. The  Lao  PDR  is  the  lowest-ranking \nEast Asian country on the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s Human Development Index. One third of the \nadult population, and nearly half of all females, cannot read or write, and just 14% of the population has completed \nprimary school. However, the Government is committed to accelerating improvement in social indicators, and human \nresource development has been accorded the highest priority in the SEDP. \n \nThe 2006 surveys conducted in project preparatory technical assistance show that food insecurity, lack of access to \nsocial  infrastructure  and  services,  low  levels  of  education,  gender  inequalities,  lack  of  ownership  of  productive \nresources,  and  poor  access  to  social  services  and  infrastructure  are  prevalent  in  the  project  areas.  Women  are \nparticularly vulnerable to trafficking, HIV/AIDS, and other risks. Tourism offers new sets of livelihood opportunities to \npoor  people  in  food  and  livestock  growing  for  tourist  establishments,  food  and  souvenir  stalls,  home  stays,  the \nmanufacture and sale of handicrafts, construction labor, repair services, guided trekking, and cultural performances \nthat  retain  the  integrity  of  ethnic  minorities.  This  Project  builds  on  what  people  already  know  and  expands  their \nknowledge  base  and  livelihood  opportunities,  making  tourism  activities  technically  feasible,  while  integrating  new \nideas and tasks into people\u2019s indigenous systems through a participatory planning process.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n37\n\nB. Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Consultation and participation process during the project preparation \n \nThe  Project  was  designed  using  a  highly  participatory  approach  and  included  consultations  with  villagers  on  their \nsituation, participation in community activities and decision making, gender and ethnic minority issues, and tourism, \nas well as formal research instruments for quantitative and more intensive qualitative investigations. From August to \nOctober 2006, project teams carried out household surveys and focus group discussions. Key informant interviews \nwere  conducted  with  village  chiefs,  heads  of  local  associations,  women\u2019s  union  representatives,  shopkeepers, \nrestaurant  owners,  and  others.  The  results  were  discussed  with  government,  nongovernment  organizations,  and \nother participants at national workshops in Hanoi and Vientiane. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation     \n\n  Collaborative decision making      \n\n Empowerment  \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3. Was a consultation and participation plan prepared?     \n \nA  participation  strategy  is  incorporated  into  the  overall  project  design.  The  Project  supports  consultation  and \ncoordination activities among various stakeholders in the tourism sector, including the executing agencies, other line \nministries, politicians, provinces, districts, villages, businesses, and community groups. Tourism community groups \nwill be established to oversee activities at the project sites. Participatory approaches will be at the core of the Project, \nand  special  provisions  and  budgets  have  been  included  to  ensure  the  active  participation  of  women,  ethnic \nminorities, youths, and other vulnerable groups. This process will be regularly monitored and periodically evaluated \nthrough  field  research  using  household  and  community  surveys,  focus  group  discussions,  participant  observation, \nand key interviews. International and national consultants and project staff will carry out these tasks, with the results \nfed back into ongoing project implementation.   \n \n\nC. Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues \nViet  Nam.  A  strong  policy  and  institutional  environment  supporting  gender  equality  has  been  instrumental  in \nempowering  Vietnamese  women  and  reducing  the  gender  gap.  The  National  Committee  for  the  Advancement  of \nWomen is formally responsible for promoting gender equality. It is a high-level multisectoral committee that reports \ndirectly  to  the  Prime  Minister.  The  Vietnam  Women\u2019s  Union  is  a  mass  organization  for  women  that  facilitates  the \nimplementation  of  local  projects  and  programs,  in  addition  to  representing  its  members  in  national  policy  dialogue. \nThe newly issued Gender Equality Law (2007) provides leverage for addressing priority gender issues by redressing \ngender  disparities  in  existing  laws,  calling  for  gender  mainstreaming  in  public  administration,  and  providing  for \ntargets and quotas for women's participation in decision making.  \n \nLao  PDR.  Promoting  gender  equality  is  an  important  national  goal  of  the  Lao  PDR,  as  reflected  in  the  1991 \nConstitution,  the  NGPES,  the  National  SEDP,  and  a  number  of  the  country\u2019s  international  commitments.  The \nNational  Commission  for  the  Advancement  of  Women-Lao  PDR  was  established  in  1991  to  help  ensure  women\u2019s \nequal access to basic services and productive resources. It develops national strategies and reports directly to the \nGovernment, while the Lao Women\u2019s Union helps implementation on the ground. \n \nThe GMS tourism sector strategy calls for increased attention to gender development in the tourism sector, in which \nwomen are commonly employed by hotels and guesthouses, food service providers, bars, travel agencies, and tour \ncompanies. Women are also self-employed in preparing and selling food and providing accommodation. Handicrafts \nare an important sector in the rural economy, with production and sales dominated by women. In the formal sector, \nwomen  are  generally  underrepresented  in  management  but  predominate  in  customer  service  and  sanitation. \nExceptions are usually found in smaller, family-run businesses, which tend to have less rigid gender stereotyping in \nhiring. Self-employment through tourism thus offers women greater independence and control and has the potential \nto  promote  local  development  by  reducing  poverty,  expanding  women\u2019s  educational  opportunities,  and  increasing \ntheir  self-confidence.  At  the  same  time,  some  initiatives  may  increase  women\u2019s  workloads  with  little  recognition  or \ncompensation, and their exposure to social risks such as trafficking may increase.  \n \n2.  Key  Actions. Measures included in the design promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, including \naccess  to  and  use  of  relevant  services,  resources,  assets,  or  opportunities  and  participation  in  decision-making \nprocess: \n  \n \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n  Gender plan       \n\nThe  Project  will  particularly  benefit  women  through  increased  employment  opportunities  and  ensuring  that  women \nget  an  equitable  share  of  educational  and  other  socioeconomic  opportunities  produced  by  the  tourism  sector.  The \nProject will increase opportunities in food production, handicrafts, ceremonial celebrations, and the management of \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nsmall  tourism  sites,  ensuring  that  women,  who  tend  to  be  underrepresented  in  decision-making  positions,  are  fully \nintegrated into the planning and implementation of subproject activities.  \n \nA gender action plan has been prepared to highlight the different needs of men and women in the tourism sector and \nto help ensure that men and women have equal opportunity to participate in and benefit from the Project. The plan is \nbased on a gender analysis that  was prepared for the Project and builds on the experiences in the previous ADB-\nfunded  Mekong  Tourism  Development  Project,  Vietnam  Gender  Assessment  2006,  and  Gender  Assessment  and \nStrategic Action Plan of the Tourism Sector in the Lao PDR. Key activities include ensuring that (i) mechanisms to \npromote  women\u2019s  representation  in  decision-making  processes  are  established;  (ii)  women\u2019s  needs  are  integrated \ninto project subcomponents; (iii) targets for female staff in project implementation are established; (iv) communities, \ngovernment officials, and other stakeholders are trained on gender issues and risks related to tourism; (v) awareness \nprograms related to HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, trafficking and other social risks for communities and \ngovernment  officials  are  designed  and  implemented;  (vi)  women  are  effectively  involved  in  project  monitoring  and \nevaluation, including gender-disaggregated data for these purposes; and (vii) at least 40% of capacity development \nand training activities and 50% of the scholarships for master trainers are reserved for women. \n \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\n \n\n \n \nIssue \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/\nLimited/ \nNo Impact \nLimited \n\nLimited  \n \n \n\nLimited \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nNo impact \n \n \nLimited \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n \n\nLabor \n\n   Employment    \n\n   opportunities \n \n\n  Labor retrenchment \n\n \n\n Core labor \n\nstandards \n\nAffordability \n\nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \nHuman trafficking \nOthers(conflict, \n\npolitical instability, etc), \nplease specify \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issue \nA resettlement framework for each country \nand short resettlement plan for the Phong \nNga Khe Bang and Siphandone \nsubprojects are prepared.

The \nplan is based on a gender analysis that was prepared for the Project and is designed according \nto the Policy on Gender and Development (1998) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). It also \nbuilds  on  experiences in  the  previous  ADB-funded  Mekong  Tourism  Development  Project,  the \nVietnam Gender Assessment 2006, and the Gender Assessment and Strategic Action Plan of \nthe Tourism Sector in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). Key activities include (i) \nmechanisms  to  promote  women\u2019s  representation  in  decision-making  processes;  (ii)  ensuring \nthat  women\u2019s  needs  are  integrated  into  project  subcomponents;  (iii)  establishing  targets  for \nfemale staff in project implementation; (iv) training communities, government officials, and other \nstakeholders  on  gender  issues  and  risks  related  to  tourism;  (v)  designing  and  implementing \nawareness  programs  for  communities  and  government  officials  related  to  HIV/AIDS,  sexually \ntransmitted diseases, trafficking, and other social risks; (vi) ensuring the effective involvement of \nwomen  in  project  monitoring  and  evaluation,  including  gender-disaggregated  data  for  these \npurposes;  and  (vii)  ensuring  that  at  least  40%  of  capacity  development  and  training  activities \nand 50% of the scholarships for master trainers are reserved for women. Gender analyses for \nthe  Lao  PDR  and  Viet  Nam  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  L,  on  social  and  poverty \nassessment and strategies. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nIn  the  tourism  sector,  women  are  mostly  employed  by  hotels  and  guesthouses,  food \nservice  providers,  bars,  travel  agencies,  and  tour  companies.  They  are  also  self-employed  in \npreparing and selling food and providing accommodation. Handicrafts are important in the rural \neconomy,  with  production  and  sales  dominated  by  women,  especially  in  textiles.  In  the  formal \nsector,  women  are  generally  underrepresented  in  management  but  predominate  in  customer \nservice  and  sanitation.  Exceptions  are  usually  found  in  smaller,  family-run  businesses,  which \ntend to have less rigid gender stereotyping.  \n \n3. \nWhile  women  are  increasingly  able  to  take  advantage  of  opportunities  in  tourism,  they \nremain  constrained  by  limited  opportunities  in  business  development  and  leadership.  Ethnic \nminorities in the two countries, especially women, particularly lag in economic opportunities. In \nViet Nam, 87% of ethnic minority women in rural areas are self-employed in agriculture. Minority \nwomen  face  more  constraints  in  access  to  capital,  as  they  are  less  likely  to  own  land  or  be \nliterate, and many poor women lack knowledge of business development, marketing, enterprise \nselection techniques, and simple accounting.  \n \n4. \nSelf-employment  through  tourism  offers  women,  particularly  those  from  ethnic  groups, \ngreater independence and control. Tourism thus has the potential to boost local development by \nreducing  poverty,  expanding  women\u2019s  educational  and  employment  opportunities,  increasing \ntheir  self-confidence,  and  ensuring  more  active  involvement  of  marginalized  groups  through \nincreased demands for their skills in handicrafts, food preparation, and cultural performances.  \n \n5. \nTourism  development  may  increase  exposure  to  HIV/AIDS  and  other  diseases, \ntrafficking,  and  substance  abuse  resulting  from  higher  number  of  tourists  and  cross-border \nmovements, especially along the north\u2013south and east\u2013west economic corridors. The potential \nnegative  social  impacts  of  tourism  on  such  groups  as  women,  children,  the  disabled,  and \nminority  communities  are  currently  among  the  least  addressed  by  the  tourism  sector.  The \nProject  will  incorporate  and  specifically  address  these  concerns  to  ensure  a  more  socially \nresponsible pattern of tourism development that positively affects both men and women. \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nB. \n\nGender Action Plan and Implementation Arrangements \n\nTable A6: Gender Action Plan \n\nProject Output \nOutput 1: Model sustainable \ntourism development \nprojects protecting the \nenvironment and cultural \nheritage developed \n \nLao PDR: Biodiversity \nprotection at the \nSiphandone Wetland \n \nLao PDR: Vang Vieng town \nenvironmental improvement \nViet Nam: Phong Nha Ke \nBang National Park  \n \nViet Nam: Ethnic minorities \ncultural heritage \ndevelopment in Bac Kan  \n \n  \n\nOutput 2: Pro-poor, \ncommunity-based, supply-\nchain tourism projects \noperational \n \n\n \n\nActions Proposed \n\u2022  PCU/PIU  introduce  the  Project  to  district  and  village  representatives,  both \n\n\u2022 \n\nmale and female. \nIdentify female-headed households and vulnerable groups (e.g., the disabled \nand  ethnic  minorities)  and  ensure  that  they  will  have  equal  access  to \nparticipation in the Project.  \n\n\u2022  Encourage  women\u2019s  participation  in  project  meetings  through,  for  example, \nsex-disaggregated  focus  groups  and  meetings  held  at  times  conducive  to \nwomen\u2019s attendance. \n\n\u2022  Collect data disaggregated by sex, ethnicity, and income level. \n\u2022  Deliver awareness programs about tourism-related employment opportunities \n\nto men and women, in either joint or disaggregated focus groups. \n\n\u2022  Ensure  that  40%  of  all  capacity  building  and  training  activities  are  reserved \nfor  women  and  that  capacity-development  and  livelihood-support  programs \ncater to the needs of both men and women. \n\n\u2022  Ensure that men and women have equal access to employment opportunities \n\ncreated by the model projects. \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  Ensure that equal wages are paid to men and women laborers for civil works. \nInclude a section on gender development in tourism master plans for model \n\u2022 \nnatural, cultural, or urban sites. \nInclude  a  section  on  gender  development  in  the  GMS  manual  on  nature-\nbased tourism in the GMS.  \nImplement gender-sensitive public awareness programs.   \nInclude  separate  budget  lines  for  screening  potential  gender  impacts  and \ndeveloping enhancement measures, a public awareness program, and M&E \ndisaggregated by sex, ethnicity, and income. \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  PCU and/or PIU introduce the Project to district and village representatives, \n\n\u2022 \n\nboth male and female. \nIdentify  households  headed  by  women  and  vulnerable  groups  (e.g.,  the \ndisabled  and  ethnic  minorities)  and  ensure  that  they  have  equal  access  to \nparticipation in the Project. \n\n\u2022  Consult  with  stakeholders,  male  and  female,  on  their  participation  in  the \nplanning  process  and  implementation,  specifically  considering  that  women\u2019s \nparticipation is balanced with their other tasks so as not to overburden them. \n\n\u2022  Develop a gender-sensitive training program on environment, culture, and \n\ntourism for tour operators and guides. \n\n\u2022  Develop  and \n\nimplement  gender-sensitive  community-mobilization  and \n\nplanning methodologies, including gender-sensitive monitoring of activities. \n\u2022  Establish  specific  mechanisms  to  promote  women\u2019s  representation  in \n\ndecision-making processes. \n\n\u2022  Deliver awareness programs about tourism-related employment opportunities \n\nto men and women, in either joint or disaggregated focus groups. \n\n\u2022  Ensure  that  gender  perspectives  and  issues  are  central  to  all  subproject \nactivities, including community mobilization, subproject planning and design, \nand M&E. \n\n\u2022  Organize  separate  meetings  with  women\u2019s  groups  to  identify  specific \n\nprograms for women in tourism. \n\n\u2022  Ensure  the  availability  of  information  to  women  by  holding  all  public \nconsultations  at  convenient  times  and  locations,  taking  into  consideration \nwomen\u2019s involvement in fieldwork, household chores, and other activities. \n\u2022  Promote products and services produced by women and ethnic minorities to \n\ntourism service providers and tourists.

The purpose of the EGMDF is to (i) guide the \nassessment  of  potential  impacts  on  ethnic  minorities  during  the  feasibility  study  for  each \nsubproject; (ii) assist the preparation of specific actions or the development of an ethnic minority \ndevelopment  plan  to  address  these  impacts;  and  (iii)  help  improve  the  distribution  of  tourism \nbenefits  among  different  groups  of  beneficiaries,  especially  the  smaller  ethnic  groups.  The \nEGMDF is based on (i) provincial and household surveys; (ii) four sample subprojects for output 1; \n(iii) consultations with ethnic minorities, government officials, and other key stakeholders; (iv) the \nprevious gender equity and ethnic diversity action plan for the Greater Mekong Subregion Mekong \nTourism  Development  Project  (Lao  PDR); 1  and  (v)  secondary  sources  and  past  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) projects. Supplementary Appendix M contains individual country ethnic \ngroups/minorities development frameworks. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nLao PDR. The Lao PDR has a population of 5.6 million, with 49 recognized ethnic groups \nand more than 200 ethnic subgroups. Ethnic groups fall into four broad ethno-linguistic categories: \nLao-Tai, Mon Khmer, Hmong-Iu Mien, and China-Tibet. Smaller ethnic groups live mainly in the \nnorthern uplands of the Lao PDR near the borders with Thailand, Myanmar, People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, and Viet Nam. They make up one-third of the population but constitute more than half of \nthe country\u2019s poor. About 32% of the total population lives below the poverty line\u201452.5% in the \nnorthern region, 34.9% in the central, and 38.4% in the southern.  \n\nEthnic Groups/Minorities and Tourism Development  \n\n3. \nViet  Nam.  Viet  Nam had  a  population of 85.3  million in 2007, of  which ethnic  minorities \naccount for 14%. There are 54 officially recognized ethnic groups. About 53 ethnic minorities and \n100 subgroups live in the northern and central mountains and the lowland river deltas of Viet Nam. \nIn  2004,  about  39%  of  all  those  living  in  poverty  were  from  ethnic  minorities.  About  61%  of  all \nethnic minority people are poor (86% in 1993), compared with only 14% of the majority Kinh and \nChinese (56% in 1993).2 Ethnic minorities are generally poorer and more disadvantaged than the \nKinh and Chinese and have limited access to education and health care services. \n\n4. \nTourism  potential  is  often  the  greatest  in  areas  where  smaller  ethnic  groups  reside. \nTourism development brings a number of direct  and indirect opportunities for ethnic minorities \nincluding (i) income generation and poverty alleviation, (ii) locally led planning and development, \n(iii)  revitalized  cultural  industries  and  practices,  (iv)  better  transport  and  communication,  (v) \nincreased  disposable  income  for  better  education  and  health  services,  and  (vi)  better \ncommunication with authorities.  \n \nTourism development also has the potential to threaten local cultures and norms. Ethnic \n5. \ngroups/minorities  often  face  constraints  that  prevent  them  from  accessing  the  opportunities \nbrought about by tourism growth, such as remote villages and limited mobility, market access, \neducation,  and  familiarity  with  majority  languages.  Women  from  small  ethnic  groups  face \nadditional risks and increased demand on their time from tourism development (e.g., increasing \nthe risk of girls dropping out of school). Efforts to conserve and share ethnic culture with tourists \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2002.

The \nProject addresses these constraints and risks in its design.  \n \nB. \n\nLegal Framework and Principles \n\n6. \nCountry-specific  ethnic  groups/minorities  development  frameworks  for  the  Project  are \nbased  on  Lao  and  Vietnamese  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998). \nADB\u2019s policy aims to protect ethnic minorities from the adverse impacts of development and to \nensure that all ethnic groups benefit from development projects and programs.  \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\nC. \n \n7. \nThe  EGMDF  ensures  that  all  ethnic  groups/minorities  share  proportionately  in  project \nbenefits  and  experience  limited  adverse  effects.  The  implementation  arrangements  and \nestimated costs of the EGMDF are integrated into the overall arrangements and budget of the \nProject.  During  project  implementation,  demonstration  subprojects  will  be  prepared  to  include  a \nsocioeconomic and demographic profile of target communities by ethnicity. Using ADB\u2019s checklist \non indigenous peoples, the potential effects of subprojects will be assessed for all ethnic groups. \nPotential  impacts  will  be  identified  and  measures  to  mitigate  them  will  be  incorporated  into  the \ndetailed design for each subproject. It is anticipated that ethnic minorities in the proposed project \nareas will benefit from the demonstration projects, which aim to use a sustainable, culturally and \nenvironmentally sound, pro-poor tourism approach.  \n\nTable A7.1: Anticipated Impacts and Proposed Actions on Ethnic Minorities in the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic and Viet Nam \n \n\nAnticipated \nPositive Effect \n\nAnticipated \nNegative \nEffect \n\n \nProposed Actions to Mitigate Impacts \n\n \nProject \nOutput \nOutput 1: Model sustainable tourism development projects protecting the environment and cultural heritage \ndeveloped \n\u25cf Biodiversity \nprotection at \nthe \nSiphandone \nWetland (Lao \nPDR) \n \n\n\u25cf Minor/none: \nFew ethnic \nminorities in the \ncommunity \n\n\u25cf None  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\u25cf  Include  ethnic  groups  in  community  planning  for  income \ngeneration and asset management in tourism. \n\u25cf  Separate  budget  lines  included  for  (i)  screening  potential \nimpacts on ethnic groups, mitigating impacts, managing risks, \nand  developing  enhancement  measures; \n(ii)  a  public \nawareness program, and (iii) M&E activities disaggregated by \nsex, ethnicity, and income where possible. \n\u25cf  Consult  with  small  ethnic  communities  during  subproject \npreparation and before the start of construction. \n\u25cf  Visitor  information  and  interpretation  facilities  in  Nakasang \nvillage  feature  cultural  and  livelihood  information  on  ethnic \ngroups from the wetland and follow local architectural design. \n\u25cf Capacity-development and livelihood-support programs cater \nto the needs of the local ethnic groups (e.g., handicrafts).  \n\u25cf  Include  a  section  on  potential  impacts  on  ethnic  groups  in \nthe GMS manual under the subproject. \n\u25cf  Include  ethnic  groups  in  community  planning  for  income \ngeneration and asset management in tourism. \n\u25cf  Include  a  separate  budget  for  (i)  a  public  awareness \nprogram  and  (ii)  M&E  disaggregated  by  sex,  ethnicity,  and \nincome where possible. \n\u25cf Consult with ethnic minority communities during subproject \npreparation and before the start of construction. \n\u25cf Use different communication strategies (e.g., text, pictures, \nor  media)  for  raising  awareness  on  waste  management, \nHIV/AIDS, and other tourism-related awareness activities. \n\u25cf  Include  temporary  workers  (e.g.,  solid  waste  collectors) \nwhen strengthen capacity in the urban development authority. \n\u25cf  Include  a  section  on  potential  impacts  on  ethnic  groups  in \nthe GMS manual under the subproject. \n\n\u25cf Vang Vieng \ntown \nenvironmental \nimprovement \n(Lao PDR) \n \n\n\u25cf None \n\n\u25cf Minor/none: \nFew ethnic \nminorities live in \nthe town  \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \nProject \nOutput \n\u25cf Phong Nha \nKe Bang \nNational Park \n(Viet Nam) \n \n\nAnticipated \nPositive Effect \n\n\u25cf Minor: Few \nethnic minorities \nreside along the \nproposed circuit \nor in Chai Lap  \n\nAnticipated \nNegative \nEffect \n\n\u25cf None  \n \n\n\u25cf Ethnic \nminority \ncultural \nheritage \ndevelopment in \nBac Kan (Viet \nNam) \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u25cf Significant: \nThe Bac Kan \nheritage \ninterpretation \nand visitor \ncenter will bring \nbenefits to the \ncommunity in Ba \nBe District. \n\n\u25cf Minor: While \nclose to 85% \nof the \npopulation in \nBa Be district \nis ethnic \nminority, the \nBac Kan \nCenter will be \nconstructed in \nthe center of \ntown. \n\n \nProposed Actions to Mitigate Impacts \n\n\u25cf  Include  ethnic  groups  in  community  planning  for  income \ngeneration  and  asset  management  through  tourism.

The Project seeks to (i) enhance the protection and conservation of \nnatural, cultural, and urban heritage assets of importance for tourism development; (ii) increase \nthe  contributions  to  poverty  reduction  of  pro-poor  tourism  initiatives;  (iii)  develop  sustainable \ntourism corridors; (iv) raise public officials\u2019 tourism-management skills in provinces and districts \nand  at  the  site;  and  (v)  improve  service  and  hygiene  standards  among  staff  in  small  and \nmedium-sized hospitality enterprises in the provinces. \n \nThe  Project  will  have  five  outputs:  (i)  model  sustainable  tourism  development  projects \n2. \nprotecting natural, cultural, and urban heritage sites of importance to tourism are operational; (ii) \npro-poor,  community-based,  supply-chain  tourism  projects  are  developed  and  operational;  (iii) \ncommunity-operated  facilities  along  the  GMS  economic  corridors  bring  improved  economic \nbenefits  to  local  communities;  (iv)  the  human  resource  capacity  of  public  and  private  tourism \nstakeholders is developed; and (v) efficient project management services are fully operational. \nEnvironmental  assessment  was  conducted  for  small-scale  infrastructure  under  outputs  1 \nthrough  3,  while  environmental  consideration  was  included  in  output  4. 2  Three  initial \nenvironmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were  prepared:  (i)  one  each  for  two  subprojects  identified \nunder component 1 and (ii) one for likely interventions to be identified under components 2 and \n3. The environmental assessment and review framework was also developed. The summary of \noutputs is attached.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  project  area  has  a  typical  tropical  monsoon  climate  with  pronounced  wet  and  dry \nseasons  and  high  rainfall,  humidity,  and  temperatures.  These  climatic  conditions  vary  with \nlatitude  and  altitude  within  the  country,  with  the  mountains  and  highland  areas  receiving \nconsiderably more precipitation and less extreme heat than the floodplains.  \n \nThe  Mekong  River  flows  through  the  Siphandone  Wetland  in  southern  Lao  People\u2019s \n4. \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR). The Mekong is a major source of water for agriculture, human \ndomestic  use,  hydroelectricity,  and  freshwater  fisheries.  The  wetland  is  a  crucial  feeding  and \nrearing habitat for an area with exceptionally diverse fish and other aquatic fauna.  About 1,200 \nspecies of fish have been identified in the Mekong River, including such well known endangered \nspecies such as the Irrawaddy dolphin, Mekong catfish, and giant barb. \n \n5. \nThere  are  several  national  protected  areas  in  the  Project  area.  Poverty  rates  in  the \nproject provinces are higher than the national average of 38.6%, except in Bokeo (37.4%) and \n                                                 \n1   The  Project  covers  the  following  nine  provinces:  Champasak,  Bokeo,  Luang  Namtha,  Savanakhet,  Oudomxay, \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nXayaboury, Saravanh, Houaphanh, and Vientiane. \n\n2   Small-scale  infrastructure  includes  the  following  four  categories  of  civil  works:  (i)  construction  or  rehabilitation  of \nexisting  footpaths,  boat  landing  areas,  and  drainage;  (ii)  improvements  to  existing  waste  collection  and \nmanagement practices; (iii) construction or rehabilitation of existing markets; and (iv) protective and improvement \nmeasures in caves.  \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nPotential Impacts and Environmental Management Plan \n\nVang Vieng town (32%). The upland ethnic minority communities in the project area suffer high \nrates of infant and maternal mortality; low access to health, education, and other social services; \nhigh  illiteracy;  and  limited  involvement  in  the  market  economy.  Since  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  tourism \nproduct  is  strongly  associated  with  nature  and  culture,  tourism  can  offer  new  sets  of \nopportunities to poor people.    \n \nC. \n \nThe  small  scale  of  the  interventions  means  that  potential  negative  impacts  associated \n6. \nwith their design, construction, and operation will be temporary, minor, and localized. They can \nbe mitigated to acceptable levels.  \n \nVisitor Impacts on Cave System. A baseline survey will be conducted if construction of \n7. \na walkway and lighting system in the Tham Eng cave site on the north\u2013south economic corridor \nis selected under output 3. It is expected to indicate that the impacts can be effectively mitigated \nthrough the adoption of careful planning, design, construction, and operation.  \n \n8. \nUnexploded  Ordnance.  A  baseline  survey  will  be  conducted  to  undertake  a  level  3 \nsurvey of unexploded ordnance to ensure the risks of exposure to the community and visitors is \nminimal  with  the  development  of  small-scale  tourism  infrastructure.  This  is  a  precautionary \nmeasure,  as  one  of  the  provinces  selected  for  the  pro-poor  program  is  an  affected  area. \nConfirmation  of  clearance  is  required  where  there  is  site  disturbance,  especially  works  and \nconstruction below ground. \n \nConstruction  Impacts.  The  subprojects  involve  small  construction  works  (e.g.,  scenic \n9. \nlookouts, markets, toilets, and walking trails). Possible environmental impacts from construction \nmay include loss of vegetation and increased dust, noise, traffic, waste, and soil erosion. These \nimpacts  will  be  temporary  and  addressed  by  a  number  of  specific  environmental  screening \ncriteria  incorporated  in  the  IEEs  and  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework \n(EARF). \n \n10.  Waste  Collection  and  Treatment.  Higher  numbers  of  visitors  will  generate  increased \nsolid  wastes  and  wastewater.  The  proposed  design  includes  the  provision  of  waste  collection \nbins  and  equipment,  the  installation  of  gross  pollutant  traps  in  existing  drains,  and  improved \nmanagement  and  hygiene  practices  at  the  solid  waste  site.  The  existing  landfill  site  has \nsufficient  capacity  to  treat  more  waste.  Monitoring  of  waste  collection  will  be  undertaken  to \nmeasure  the  volume  and  types  of  waste  and  appropriately  design  and  modify  current  waste \ncollection and treatment practices and awareness programs.  \n \n11. \nEnvironmental  Benefits.  The  Project  will  improve  the  environmental  and  health \nsituation in and around the subproject sites\u2014and potentially in a larger area, if the models and \napproaches  to  the  development  of  the  subprojects  are  replicated  as  envisaged.  Waterborne \ndiseases  are  a  significant  health  threat  in  the  vicinity  of  all  the  subproject  sites,  especially  the \nsustainable tourism and pro-poor sites. The Project will reduce solid wastes and water pollution \nin the Vang Vieng River in the Lao PDR, as well as improve the town\u2019s amenities as a tourist \ndestination.  It  will  demonstrate  the  use  of  low-impact  visitor  access  infrastructure  in  sensitive \nenvironments such as at the Siphandone Wetland and at key attractions along the north\u2013south \neconomic corridor in the Lao PDR.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n \n\n63\n\nPublic Consultation \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Review Framework \n\nD. \n \n12. \nA series of public consultations was conducted at the national, provincial, commune, and \nvillage  levels  during  project  preparation.  Agency  representatives  and  villagers  supported  the \nproposed  project  activities  and  provided  variable  inputs  on  the  location  and  design  of \ninterventions.  No  major  issues  were  identified  with  the  proposed  projects.  The  public \nconsultations  allowed  ideas  to  be  integrated  into  the  design  of  mitigation  measures  and \nmonitoring  programs.    Public  consultation  is  an  ongoing  and  integral  process  in  project \nimplementation.  Continuous  dialogue  with  the communities  affected  by and/or  benefitting  from \nthe project, as well as with relevant governments, will be carried out during detailed design and \nimplementation.  \n \nE. \n \n13. \nThe  Lao  National  Tourism  Administration  (LNTA)  is  the  Executing  Agency,  and  the \nproject coordination unit (PCU) will be established in it. The Executing Agency is responsible for \ncoordinating relevant local agencies to ensure the adequate quality of IEEs, obtain IEE approval \nfrom  the  Water  Resources  and  Environmental  Administration,  and  monitor  the  progress  of \nimplementation.  Provincial  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  will  be  established  in  the \ndepartment  of  tourism  of  participating  provinces.  The  PIUs  bear  the  main  responsibility  for \nupdating  and  implementing  environmental  management  plans  for  the  Siphandone  and  Vang \nVieng  subprojects,  conducting  environmental  assessment  for  the  subprojects  to  be  identified \nunder outputs 2 and 3, in accordance with the EARF prepared during project preparation.  \n \nThe  IEEs  prepared  for  the  Project  will  guide  the  PIUs  in  updating  environmental \n14. \nmanagement  plans  for  the  Siphandone  Wetland  and  Vang  Vieng  subprojects  during  detail \ndesign.  The  EARF  will  guide  each  PIU  in  screening  subprojects,  specifying  institutional \nrequirements  for  environmental  management  and  monitoring  to  ensure  compliance  with  the \napplicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government  and  the  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) of the Asian Development Bank. The EARF is in \nSupplementary Appendix F.  \n \nThe  project  includes  the  estimated  environmental  management  plan  costs  of  $20,000 \n15. \neach  for  the  Siphandone  and  Vang  Vieng  subprojects  under  output  1  and  $10,000  each  for \noutputs 2 and 3 for the baseline survey for unexploded ordnance and the Tham Nam Eng cave, \nwater  monitoring,  and  any  other  necessary  monitoring.  Environmental  personnel  (3  person-\nmonths  of  international  consultancy  and  10  person-months  of  national)  will  be  provided  in  the \nPCU and PIUs. \n \nF. \n \n16. \nThe  IEE  found  that  most  of  the  proposed  interventions  will  not  adversely  affect \nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas,  nor  will  they  cause  significant  changes  in  the  physical, \nbiological,  and  social  environment.  A  special  study  will  be  conducted  if  the  proposed \ninterventions at the Tham Nam Eng cave site are selected to ensure that karst environments will \nnot  be  disturbed.  Any  environmental  effects  will  be  minor  and  easily  mitigated  through  the \nadoption of sound environmental planning, design, construction, and management practices at \nall sites. No environmental impact assessment is required for the Project.  \n \n\nConclusion  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nOutput 1: Sustainable Tourism Development \n\n \nNatural Site \n\n \nSiphandone Wetland in \nChampasak Province \n \n \n\n \nUrban Site \n\n \nVang Vieng town wastewater \nin Vientiane Province \n \n\n(i)  Extension of drains in the \ncore of the town  \n(ii)  Road pavement and \nimprovements to secondary \nroads in the town core \n(iii) \nInstallation of gross \npollutant traps and a wetland \nfilter to remove solid waste \n(iv)  Provision of an additional \nvehicle for solid waste \ncollection \n(v)  Environmental \nawareness campaign for \nresidents and business \nestablishments  \n(vi)  Training of the Urban \nDevelopment Administrative \nAuthority staff   \n\n(i)  Preparation of a \nheritage-based tourism \nzoning, structure, and \nmanagement plan  \n(ii)  Improvements to the 4 \nkm access road \n(iii)  Environmental \nimprovements at Ban \nNakasang and on Don Det \nand Done Kone  \n(iv)  Construction of visitor \ninformation and interpretation \nfacilities and fully interpreted \naccess trails at Nakasang \nand on Don Det, Done Kone, \nand smaller islands \n(v)  Capacity building and \nsupport program for local \ncommunities \n(vi)  Development and \nimplementation of a \ncommunity-based natural \nresource monitoring protocol \n\n       Source: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\nOutput 5: \nProject \nManagement \n\n \nSupport for \nefficient project \nmanagement \nservices \n\n6\n4\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n3\n \n\ni\n\n(i) Set up project \ncoordination \nunits  \n  \n\nTable A13: Summary of Outputs \n \nOutput 2: Pro-poor \nTourism Development \n\n \nOutput 3: Facilitation on \nEconomic Corridors \n\nOutput 4: Human \nResource \nDevelopment \n\n \nPro-poor tourism \nsubproject in  \nSaravanh Province, \nOudomxay Province, \nHoaphanh Province, \nBokeo Province, and \nVang Vieng District in \nVientiane Province \n\n(i)  Community-based \ntourism product \ndevelopment \nIdentification of \n(ii) \ntourism development \nsupply chain \n(iii)  Capacity building for \nmicro enterprises \n(iv)  Small-scale \ninfrastructure such as \ninformation centers, \nwalking trains, and \nsanitary facilities \n(v)  Gender \ndevelopment participation \nprogram \n(vi)  Marketing and \npromotion program \n(vii)  Community-based \ntourism networks \n(viii)  Impact monitoring \n \n\n \nOn the north\u2013south \ncorridor, five points plus \ntwo border points: (i) Nam \nHa Protected Area \nInterpretation Center, (ii) \nNam Eng Cave Complex, \n(iii) Vat Mahaphot and \nancient site, (iv) Nam \nPhae village scenic \nviewpoint, and (v) Don \nChai/Phimonsin village \nhandicraft market \n \n(i)  Preparation of tourism \ndevelopment and \nmanagement plans for the \nsites \n(ii)  Construction of small-\nscale infrastructure  \n(iii) Community \npreparation and livelihood \nsupport program  \n(iv) Tourism management \ntraining for site managers \nand local tour guide \ntraining program \n(v)  Marketing and \npromotion program for the \nnorth\u2013south economic \ncorridor tourism circuit  \n(vi) Impact monitoring and \nevaluation program  \n \n\n \nSupport for \ntraining of trainers \nin small-scale \nhospitality service \nskills and training \nof public officials \nat two existing \ntraining and \neducation \ninstitutions \n\nTourism training \nfor industries, \ncommunities and \nthe government \n(i) review of \nexisting training \nneeds \n(ii) development of \nservices \nstandards for \nsmall and \nmedium-sized \nenterprises in \ntourism and \nhospitality \nenterprises and \ntraining standards \n(iii) development \nof training \nmanuals and \nmaterials \n(iv) development \nof web-based \nknowledge center \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n65\n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN AND FRAMEWORK \n\nA  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  two  subprojects  in  component  1  of  the \n1. \nSustainable  Tourism  Development  Project  (the  Project),  where  sites  have  been  identified  and \nsurveys  and  consultations  found  that  resettlement  and  land  acquisition  will  be  necessary. \nResettlement frameworks for the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and Viet Nam \nhave been prepared because the prioritization and selection of sites for subprojects in outputs 2 \nand 3 will follow a sector approach and be done during project implementation. The frameworks \nhave  been  developed  based  on  the  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and include the specific policies and guidelines for the processes of \nland acquisition and resettlement for each of the two countries.  \n \n2. \nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts. Resettlement plans have been \nprepared for the subprojects in Siphandone in Lao PDR and Phong Nga Khe Bang National Park \nin Viet Nam. In Siphandone, 28 households with 141 people will be affected. Three households \nwill  be  relocated,  and  28  households  (including  the  three  to  be  relocated)  will  experience \ntemporary  impacts  from  the  relocation  of  their  market  stalls.  The  shop  owners  have  been \nguaranteed a stall at the new market to be constructed under the Project. Seven of the affected \nhouseholds are poor, and two are headed by women. In Phong Nga Khe Bang, one household \nof six people will lose 900 square meters of land currently used for farming. The household is \nneither poor nor ethnic minority. No resettlement plan is required for the Vang Vieng subproject \nin  the  Lao  PDR  or  the  Bac  Kan  subproject  in  Viet  Nam,  as  they  will  not  require  any  land \nacquisition  or  resettlement.  In  the  unlikely  event  that  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  will \nbecome  necessary,  any  impacts  will  be  addressed  in  accordance  with  the  respective \nresettlement frameworks.  \n \nFor  each  remaining  subproject  found  to  require  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  a \n3. \nresettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  by  the  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  under  the \nguidance of the project coordination units (PCUs). It is envisaged that, as the interventions will \nbe  small  and  priority  will  be given  to  avoiding  or  minimizing  resettlement  and land  acquisition, \nimpacts will not be significant. Some minimal resettlement or land acquisition may be necessary, \nsuch  as  relocating  a  few  households;  effects  on  farmland  or  garden  plots  and  crops;  and  the \nutilization of public or communal land for the construction of small markets, parking lots, covered \nbus stops, river landings and stairs, embankment protection, cultural and interpretation centers, \nrefreshment  stands,  walkways,  footbridges,  toilets  with  water  supply,  ticket  booths,  lodges, \npavilions,  and  signage.  As  all  impacts  are  expected  to  be  minimal,  it  is  likely  that  only  short \nresettlement plans will be prepared for this Project. \n \nLegal  and  Policy  Framework.  The  policy  framework  and  entitlements  have  been \n4. \ndeveloped from the relevant laws, decrees, and regulations of the governments of Viet Nam and \nthe  Lao  PDR  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995).  Both  countries  have \nenacted a number of laws, decrees, and regulations that constitute the legal framework for land \nacquisition,  compensation,  and  resettlement.  Provisions  and  principles  adopted  in  the \nresettlement plans and frameworks will supplement the provisions of relevant decrees currently \nin force in Viet Nam and the Lao PDR, wherever a gap exists.  \n \nPrinciples  of  Resettlement.  The  following  principles  were  formulated  to  bridge  the \n5. \ndifferences between ADB and government resettlement policies and will apply to all civil works \nundertaken: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nInvoluntary resettlement and impacts on land, structures, and other fixed assets \nwill be avoided or minimized where possible by exploring all alternative options. \nAffected people residing, working, doing business, or cultivating on required land \nas of the completion date of the census and detailed measurement survey will be \nentitled to compensation and rehabilitation assistance to assist them in improving, \nor  at  least  maintaining,  their  pre-project  living  standards  and  productive \n\n \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\ncapacities. The Project will ensure that affected people are able to find alternative \nsites and income sources. \nLack  of  formal  legal  title  or  rights  will  not  be  bar  eligibility  for  compensation  and \nassistance under the Project. Affected people will not be displaced until the village \nallocates  suitable  alternative  land  or  compensation  is  paid  that  is  sufficient  to \npurchase suitable land in the same or a neighboring village. \nAll compensation will be based on replacement cost at the time of compensation. For \nhouses and other structures, this will involve the costs for materials and labor at the \ntime  of  acquisition,  with  no  deduction  for  depreciation  or  salvageable  materials. \nCompensation  for  land  will  be  replacement  land  as  a  priority  or,  where  this  is  not \npossible, in cash adequate to purchase land locally of equivalent area and quality and, \nwhere required, to improve land to achieve suitable quality. \nThe process and timing of land and other asset acquisition will be determined in \nconsultation with affected people to minimize disturbance. \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi)  Where houses and structures are partly affected to the degree that the remaining \nportion is not viable for its intended use, the Project will acquire the entire asset, \nand affected people will be entitled to compensation at replacement cost for the \nentire asset. \nAffected people will be systematically informed and consulted about the Project, \ntheir  rights,  the  options  available  to  them,  and  proposed  mitigating  measures. \nThe  comments  and  suggestions  of  affected  people  and  communities  will  be \ntaken into account. \n\n(vii) \n\n(x) \n\n(ix) \n\n(xi) \n\nto  affected  people \n\n(viii)  The key information in the resettlement plan, such as the measurement of losses, \ndetailed  asset  valuation,  compensation  and  resettlement  options,  detailed \nentitlements  and  special  provisions,  grievance  procedures,  timing  of  payments, \nin  an \nand  displacement  schedule  will  be  disclosed \nunderstandable  format,  such  as  through  the  distribution  of  public  information \nbooklets, prior to submission to ADB for review and approval. \nResettlement  identification,  planning,  and  management  will  ensure  that  gender \nconcerns  are  incorporated,  including  gender-specific  consultation  and  information \ndisclosure. This includes special attention to guarantee women\u2019s assets, property, and \nland-use rights, and to ensure the restoration of their income and living standards. \nExisting  cultural  and  religious  practices  will  be  respected  and,  to  the  maximum \nextent practical, preserved. \nSpecial measures will be incorporated in the resettlement plan to protect socially \nand  economically  vulnerable  groups  such  as  indigenous  peoples,  households \nheaded by women, children, households headed by the disabled, the elderly, the \nlandless, and people living below the generally accepted poverty line. Vulnerable \naffected  people  will  be  provided  with  appropriate  assistance  to  help  them \nimprove  their  standard  of  living  through  asset-building  strategies  such  as  land \nprovision,  replacement  housing  of  minimum  standards,  and  strengthened \nsecurity of tenure. \nThere will be effective mechanisms for hearing and resolving grievances during \nthe  updating  and  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan.  Resettlement \ncommittees  will  include representatives  from  affected  people,  especially  women \nand other vulnerable groups. \nInstitutional  arrangements  will  be  in  place  for  the  timely  and  effective  design, \nplanning,  consultation,  and  implement  of  the  land  acquisition,  compensation, \nresettlement, and rehabilitation programs. \n\n(xiii) \n\n(xii) \n\n(xiv)  Adequate budgetary support will be fully committed and made available to cover the \n\n(xv) \n\ncosts of land acquisition and resettlement within the agreed implementation period. \nAppropriate  reporting,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  mechanisms  will  be  identified \nand set in place as part of the resettlement management system. Monitoring and \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n67\n\nevaluation of the land acquisition, resettlement, and rehabilitation processes and \ntheir final outcomes will be conducted by an independent monitor. \n\n(xvi)  Voluntary donation will not be applied for any assets. \n(xvii)  Civil works contracts will not be awarded for a specific subproject or geographic area \nuntil (a) compensation payment and relocation to new sites have been satisfactorily \ncompleted  for  that  subproject  or  geographic  area;  (b)  the  agreed  rehabilitation \nprogram  is  in  place;  and  (iii)  the  area  is  free  from  all  encumbrances  as  per  the \napproved resettlement plan. \n\n(xviii)  Cash  compensation  or  replacement  land  for  affected  households  losing  all  of \ntheir residential land will be made available well ahead of civil works to allow the \naffected households sufficient time to reconstruct their houses. \n\n(xix)  No demolition of assets and/or entry to properties will be done until the affected \n\nhousehold is fully compensated and relocated. \n\n \n6. \nEntitlements  and  Compensation.  Entitlements  and  compensation  are  based  on  the \nProject\u2019s social surveys and consultations and on the Governments\u2019 and ADB\u2019s requirements and \nprocedures. People eligible for compensation are those who will experience negative impacts on \ntheir  assets  or  livelihoods  as  a  result  of  the  Project.  Affected  people  who  appear  in  the \nsubprojects\u2019  census  will  be  entitled  to  compensation  and  assistance.  Loss  of  land  will  be \ncompensated  through  land-for-land  arrangements  or,  if  the  affected  people  prefer,  cash \ncompensation at an amount equal to the current market value. For affected houses and structures, \ncompensation and assistance will be equivalent to the provision of, or full replacement costs for, \nbuilding a house or structure of the same size and standard. Loss of unharvested annual crops \nwill  be  compensated  at  current  market  value.  Relocating  households  will  receive  subsistence \nallowances,  and  affected  people  belonging  to  vulnerable  groups  will  be  entitled  to  additional \nspecial  allowances.  The  resettlement  frameworks  contain  detailed  entitlement  matrixes \nsummarizing types of impact, eligibility, and compensation. However, it may not cover all types \nof  impact  and  can  be  enhanced  in  the  resettlement  plans  depending  on  the  findings  of  the \nsurveys  and  subproject  impacts.  Standards  described  may  not  be  lowered  but  may  be \nenhanced  in  the  ensuing  resettlement  plans  as  required  and  on  the  basis  of  detailed  social \nimpact  analysis.  The  entitlement  matrix \nin \nis \nSupplementary Appendix B.  \n \nConsultation,  Disclosure,  and  Grievance  Redress.  At  the  early  stages  of  project \n7. \npreparation, local authorities and leaders of different administrative levels in each of the Project \nareas were informed about the project proposal and its objectives and proposed activities. They \nwere  consulted  on  development  needs  and  resettlement  issues,  their  perception  of  project \nobjectives  and  technical  designs,  and  their  tasks  and  roles  in  project  planning  and \nimplementation. Affected people were informed of the proposed Project by household and have \nbeen  involved  in  developing  the  proposed  resettlement  and  compensation  packages.  Some \nhave  expressed  their  preference  for  the  type  of  compensation  to  receive.  Disclosure  of  the \nresettlement plans to the affected people has been done, using locally appropriate information \nbooklets.  Further  consultations  will  be  undertaken  prior  to  finalizing  detailed  design  to \nincorporate  affected  people\u2019s  requests  and  suggestions  to  minimize  resettlement  impacts.  A \ngrievance  mechanism  has  been  established  to  ensure  that  affected  people\u2019s  concerns  and \ngrievances  are  addressed  and  resolved  in  a  timely  and  satisfactory  manner.  Affected  people \nwill  be  made  fully  aware  of  their  grievance  rights  and  the  procedures, verbally  and  in  writing, \nduring consultation and the survey and at the time of compensation.  \n \nImplementation  Arrangements.  Responsibility  for  resettlement  spans  various  levels  of \n8. \ngovernment  and  project  contractors.  In  Viet  Nam,  these  include  the  Ministry  of  Culture,  Sports, \nand Tourism; provincial people\u2019s committees; district people\u2019s committees, project implementation \nconsultants; and specifically formed provincial, district, and village resettlement committees. The \nresettlement framework and plans will be approved by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism \n\nthe  resettlement \n\nframeworks \n\nfound \n\nin \n\n \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n(MCST)  and  the  provincial  people\u2019s  committees  of  the  relevant  provinces.  In  the  Lao  PDR,  the \ninstitutions  responsible  include  the  Lao  National  Tourism  Administration  (LNTA);  Urban \nDevelopment  Administration  Authority\u2019s  Department  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (in  Vang \nVieng);  Water  Resource  and  Environment  Administration;  project  implementation  consultants; \nprovincial  authorities;  and  specifically  formed  provincial,  district,  and  village  resettlement \ncommittees.  The  resettlement  framework  and  plans  will  be  approved  by  LNTA  and  the  Water \nResources and Environmental Administration and endorsed by the relevant provinces. The PIUs \nwill ensure coordination of provincial and/or district agencies involved in resettlement and review \ncompensation rates and the resettlement budget. \n \n9. \nImplementation  Schedule.  The  resettlement  plans  include  detailed  implementation \nschedules  coordinated  with  the  civil  works  schedule.  All  subproject  resettlement  plans  will  be \nreviewed  by  ADB  prior  to  project  implementation.  Approval  to  award  any  civil  works  contracts \nwill not be given until the required lands have been fully acquired and the affected households \nare appropriately compensated and relocated. \n \n10.  Monitoring and Evaluation. The PCU and PIUs are responsible for internal monitoring \nof land acquisition and resettlement. The PIUs will submit quarterly resettlement reports to the \nPCUs.  The  PCUs  will  include  PIU  resettlement  progress  in  the  Project\u2019s  quarterly  progress \nreports  submitted  to  ADB.  Monitoring  reports  will  be  uploaded  to  ADB's  website.  For  external \nmonitoring  and  post  evaluation  activities,  the  PCUs  will  engage  a  suitable  domestic  agency \nacceptable  to  ADB,  under  terms  of  reference  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  PCUs  and  PIUs  will \nprovide the domestic agency with all resettlement-related documents.  \n \n11. \nCost  and  Budget.  Adequate  budgetary  support  will  be  fully  committed  and  made \navailable  to  cover  the  costs  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  within  the  agreed \nimplementation period. Subproject resettlement plans will include a breakdown of each type of \nloss  with  corresponding  cost  estimates  reflecting  replacement  costs  at  current  market  values. \nThe cost estimates will make adequate provision for contingencies.  \n \nResettlement  Frameworks  and  Resettlement  Plans.
