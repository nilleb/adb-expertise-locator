A  summary  of  the  environmental  impact  assessment  was \ncirculated to the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nalong  with  the  environmental  management  plan  on  17  May  2007,  and \nuploaded to the ADB website on 18 May 2007.  \n\nThe  Project  is  a  key  urban  infrastructure  initiative  of  the  Jilin  provincial \ngovernment  (JPG).  It  is  classified  as  a  targeted  intervention  because  it \ncontributes to achieving Millennium Development Goal 7, Target 10, which \ncalls  for  the  halving  of  the  proportion  of  people  without  access  to  safe \ndrinking water and improved sanitation by 2015. The Project will help to (i) \nreduce  water  pollution,  (ii)  protect  water  resources,  (iii)  address  water \nshortage (through recycling effluent) and meet the demand for high quality \ntreated water through 2012, (iv) control nonpoint source of pollution through \neffective  solid-waste  management  (SWM),  (v)  reduce  air  pollution  through \nreduction  in  coal  consumption  and  more  efficient  central  heating,  (vi) \npromote  sustainable  economic  development,  and  (vii) \nthe \nenvironment  and  living  conditions  in  Changchun  and  Yanji  cities  in  Jilin \nprovince.  The  Project  has  three  components,  seven  subcomponents,  and \n35  activities.  The  components  are  (i)  an  improved  and  expanded  water \nsupply, wastewater services, and SWM in Changchun; (ii) an improved and \nexpanded water supply and wastewater facilities in Yanji; and (iii) improved \nair  quality  in  Yanji  through  a  more  efficient  central  heating  system.  The \nProject  will  also  involve  capacity  development  and  training  on  project \nmanagement, institutional and wastewater management, and tariff analysis \nfor  all  the  project  implementing  agencies  (IAs).  The  Project  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s  11th  Five  Year  Program  which  includes  goals  of  improving \nliving  conditions  and  health  in  cities  and  promoting  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment.  \n\nimprove \n\nThe  project  cities  of  Changchun  (with  an  urban  population  of  3.2  million) \nand Yanji (420,400) are located along the Songhua River Basin (SRB). The \nSRB is the third largest river basin in the PRC, and it covers sections of Jilin \nand Heilongjiang provinces and the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia. \nThe  Songhua  River  is  severely  polluted  with  organic  chemicals,  heavy \nmetals,  and  conventional  pollutants,  and  this  constrains  sustainable \neconomic  development  in  the  region.  The  Yitong  and  Yongchun  rivers  in \nChangchun  flow  into  the  SRB  and  are  highly  polluted  due  to  inadequate \nwastewater  treatment  in  Changchun.  The  Yanji  section  of  the  Buerhatong \nRiver is also heavily polluted as it goes from east to west and empties into \nthe  Tumen  River.  Given  that  the  present  landfill  site  in  Changchun  will  be \n\n\fii\n\nImpact and \nOutcome\n\nfully  utilized  within  2  years,  there  is  urgent  need  for  construction  of  a new \ndomestic solid-waste treatment facility to effectively control nonpoint source \nof pollution in the SRB. Jilin province, therefore, has a critical role to play in \nintegrated water and wastewater management and SWM in the SRB. The \nProject  will contribute significantly  towards  control  of  water pollution in  the \nYitong  and  Yongchun  rivers,  the  upstream  section  of  the  SRB,  and  the \nBuerhatong  River.  The  Project  will  also  help  to  solve  the  current  water \nshortage problems in the project cities and meet the future demand for high \nquality treated water. \n\nIn  2002,  during  the  processing  of  the  Harbin  Water  Supply  Project  ($100 \nmillion),  extensive  dialogue  was  conducted  with  the  Government  on \naddressing  pollution  control  in  the  SRB.  Consequently,  ADB  provided  a \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  project  for  the  Songhua  River  Basin  Water \nQuality  and  Pollution  Control  Management.  The  TA  project,  which  was \nconsidered  highly  successful,  provided  strategic  policy  inputs  to  the  SRB \nWater Pollution Prevention and Control Plan (SRBPCP). The SRBPCP is a \nGovernment-approved  action  program  to  set  pollution  control  targets  from \n2006  to  2010,  requiring  that  urban  environmental  pollution  and  ecological \ndamage  be  controlled  by  2010.  The  ongoing  Jilin  Water  Supply  and \nSewerage  Development  (JWSSD)  project,  with  an  ADB  loan  of  $100 \nmillion,  is  the  first  major  ADB  investment  directly  addressing  pollution \ncontrol  in  the  SRB.  It  will  help  Changchun  achieve  a  70%  wastewater \ntreatment rate by 2010. The proposed Project, which is the second project \nand follows the priority list of the SRBPCP, will help Changchun achieve an \n80%  wastewater  treatment  rate  by  2012.  The  Project  will  also  help  Yanji \ncity achieve a wastewater treatment rate of 95% by 2012. \n\nADB will implement a TA for an ensuing project in 2008, the Songhua River \nBasin  Water  Pollution  Control  and  Management  Project,  which  has  an \nindicative  ADB  loan  of  $200  million.  This  would  be  the  third  major \ninvestment in the context of the SRBPCP, and the ADB\u2019s fourth in the SRB. \nThis  comprehensive  strategic  approach  to  addressing  pollution  control  in \nthe SRB is a good model for replication elsewhere in the PRC. \n\nYanji  will  shortly  start  constructing  a  new  cogeneration  (heat  and  power) \nplant  which  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  2010,  allowing  complete \ncoverage  of  the  city  with  a  central  heating  service.  The  closure  and \nreplacement of the 318 polluting coal-based boilers by the proposed Project \nwould result in a major improvement in the air quality of Yanji, which would \ncontribute significantly to public health in Yanji city. However, to fully realize \nthe  benefits  of  this  facility,  the  heating  distribution  system  needs  to  be \nupgraded and treated wastewater effluent is required for plant cooling.  \n\nThe impact of the Project is to enhance the urban environment and improve \npublic  health  and  quality  of  life  for  urban  residents  in  the  cities  of \nChangchun and Yanji by (i) increasing wastewater coverage, (ii) enhancing \nSWM,  (iii)  improving  the  supply  of  potable  water,  and  (iv)  reducing  air \npollution.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  improved  water  supply, \nwastewater management, SWM, and efficient central heating in Changchun \nand Yanji. \n\n\fCost Estimates \n\nThe  investment  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $352.68  million \nequivalent, including taxes and duties. \n\niii\n\nFinancing Plan \n\nSource\nAsian Development Bank \nChangchun municipal government \nYanji municipal government \nCofinancing: Domestic Commercial \nBanks\n\n \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nAmount \n($ million equivalent)\n100.0 \n81.7 \n33.4 \n137.6 \n\n% of Total \n28 \n23 \n10 \n39 \n\n352.7 \n\n100 \n\nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $100  million  to  finance  28%  of  the  project  cost \nincluding  financing  charges  during  construction.  The  Government  will \nfinance  72%  through  a  combination  of  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  ($35 \nmillion),  Changchun  municipal  government  (CMG)  and  Yanji  municipal \ngovernment (YMG) budget sources, and domestic loans from PRC banks. \n\nADB\u2019s loan of $100 million will come from its ordinary capital resources and \nwill be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility  for  US  dollar  loans.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  based  on  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending,  a  commitment  charge  of 0.35%  per  year,  and  such \nother  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements.\n\nThe  Government  of  the  PRC  will  relend  the  loan  proceeds  to  the  JPG, \nwhich will onlend the loan proceeds to CMG and YMG. All transactions will \nhave the same terms and conditions as the ADB loan. CMG and YMG will \nonlend the loan proceeds to the IAs serving the project cities on the same \nterms  and  conditions  as  the  ADB  loan.  The  IAs  will  assume  the  foreign \nexchange and interest rate variation risks for the ADB loan. \n\nLoan Amount and \nTerms\n\nAllocation and \nRelending Terms\n\nPeriod of \nUtilization\n\nUntil 30 June 2013  \n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n\n31 December 2012 \n\nImplementation\nArrangements \n\nThe  JPG  has  established  a  project  leading  group  (PLG)  led  by  the  vice-\ngovernor.  The  members  include  representatives  of  the  Jilin  Development \nand  Reform  Commission,  Jilin  Construction  Bureau,  and  Jilin  Finance \nBureau, mayors of CMG and YMG, and concerned agencies. The PLG will \nmeet  periodically \ninteragency \ncoordination,  and  resolve  any  institutional  problems  affecting  project \nimplementation.  The  Project  Management  Office  (PMO)  for  the  ongoing \nJWSSD  project  will  continue  as  the PMO  for  the  proposed Project  and as \nthe  secretariat  of  the  PLG.  The  PMO  will  coordinate  with  the  project \nimplementing  units  established  in  CMG  and  YMG,  and  will  monitor \nimplementation progress made by IAs.  \n\nto  provide  policy  guidance, \n\nfacilitate \n\nExecuting Agency  Jilin Provincial Government\n\n\fiv\n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting\nServices\n\nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\nAll procurement of goods and works shall be carried out in accordance with \nADB's Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nContracts  for  goods  estimated  to  exceed  $1.0  million  and  contracts  for \nworks estimated to exceed $10.0 million will be procured using international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Contracts for goods and contracts for \nworks estimated to be equal to or less than the above ICB values, but more \nthan  $100,000,  shall  be  procured  on  the  basis  of  national  competitive \nbidding  procedures  in  accordance  with  the  PRC  Tendering  and  Bidding \nLaw (1999), subject to modifications agreed with ADB. Contracts for goods \nand  works  estimated  to  cost  $100,000  or  less  will  be  procured  using \nshopping procedures. \n\n(vi)  ADB  procurement  procedures  and \n\nAbout  18  person-months  of  international  consultant  expertise  and  108 \nperson-months  of  national  consultant  expertise  will  be  required.  Expertise \nwill  be  needed  in  (i)  construction  supervision  and  quality  control;  (ii) \nresettlement  monitoring;  (iii)  pipeline,  water,  and  wastewater  treatment \nplants;  (iv)  SWM  facilities;  (v)  heating  systems,  network  construction,  and \nreporting \nimprovement; \nrequirements; (vii) social and environmental monitoring; (viii) tariff analysis; \n(ix)  quality  control;  and  (x)  project  performance  management  system \n(PPMS).  The  international  consultants  will  also  provide  training  and \ncapacity  development  in  (i)  water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment \nplanning,  (ii)  water  resources  and  quality  management,  (iii)  financial \nmanagement,  (iv)  environmental  monitoring  and  management,  and  (v) \nPPMS.  The  scope  and  extent  of  consulting  services  take  account  of  the \nloan  consulting  and  capacity-development  support  provided  under  the \nongoing  JWSSD  project.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time).\n\nThe  Project  will  benefit  about  3.6  million  urban  residents  in  the  cities  of \nChangchun and Yanji, whose living conditions and public health standards \nwill  be  improved  by  (i)  improved  quality  of  water  supply  and  wastewater \nservices,  (ii)  a  reduction  in  nonpoint  source  pollution  through  increased \nSWM  capacity,  (iii)  a  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases \nsuch  as  diarrhea  and  hepatitis  A  to  below  2006  levels  (to  be  monitored \nthrough  the  PPMS),  (iv)  a  reduction  in  the  risk  of  respiratory  diseases  by \nimproving the central heating system and cutting utilization of coal by 40% \nor 298,000 tons per heating season, and (v) water savings of 700,000 cubic \nmeters  (m3)  per  heating  season  through  water  reuse  and  a  reduction  in \nunaccounted-for water. The Project will result in improved management and \nutilization of water resources in the upper SRB and the Buerhatong River, \nbringing positive downstream and transjurisdictional benefits in the province \nof  Heilongjiang.  The  water  quality \nthe  SRB  and \nBuerhatong  River  will  also  contribute  to  (i)  integrated  water  resource \nthe  basin-wide  management \nmanagement  and  pollution  control,  (ii) \nprogram, and (iii) transboundary pollution prevention and control. \n\nimprovements \n\nin \n\nThe  Project  will  secure  the  provision  of  reliable  drinking  water  to \nChangchun  and  Yanji.  The  recycling  of  wastewater  will  reduce  water \npollution  and  address  the  water  shortage  problem.  This  will  also  have  a \ncatalytic  effect  on  encouraging  the  replication  of  similar  optimal  and  cost-\neffective approaches to addressing water pollution and water shortage.  \n\n\fv\n\nOf  the  total  beneficiary  population,  about  240,000  persons  (or  5.54%)  are \nclassified  as  poor  measured  by  the  weighted  average  local  urban  poverty \nline  of  CNY1,925  per  year.  Major  social  measures  to  protect  urban \nresidents  from  falling  into  poverty  include  (i)  a  living  allowance  for  laid-off \nemployees, (ii) unemployment insurance, and (iii) a social support program \nunder the minimum living-standard scheme. Further, CMG and YMG have \nagreed to implement poverty reduction measures, including (i) lifeline tariffs, \n(ii)  providing  water  bill  discounts  or  cash  rebates  amounting  to  50%  of \nmonthly  water  bills  for  households  living  below  the  poverty  line,  and  (iii) \nconnecting  the  poorest  households  to  tap  water  in  Changchun  and  Yanji. \nThe Project will create a minimum of 810 permanent jobs for the operation \nof  the  facilities,  and  3,880  jobs  during  the  5-year  construction  period. \nFollow-on multiplier effects are expected to create an additional 5,000 full-\ntime  jobs.  About  half  of  the  construction  jobs  are  unskilled  jobs  that  are \nmost  likely  to  be  filled  by  currently  unemployed  persons.  Public  health \nbenefits  will  accrue  through  (i)  a  reduction  in  waterborne  and  airborne \ndiseases,  (ii)  savings  on  medical  treatment  costs,  and  (iii)  improved \nworkforce productivity.\n\nThe Project is technically sound, affordable to beneficiaries, and financially \nand  economically  viable  with  a  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  9.0% \n(higher  than  the  real  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  3.52%)  and  a \nbase-case  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  23.8%,  which  is  well  above \nthe economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. \n\nThe  following  risks  could  affect  timely  implementation  and  economic \nviability,  and  reduce  the  available  benefits  of  the  Project:  (i)  amendments \nand changes to the Changchun and Yanji master plans; (ii) a lack of proper \noperation and maintenance of project facilities; (iii) ineffective organizational \nstructures  and  inadequate  capacity  of  the  IAs,  which  could  result  in \ninefficient  project  development  and  delayed  implementation;  (iv)  delays  in \nthe  provision  of  counterpart  funding;  (v)  failure  of  CMG  and  YMG  to \nincrease  water,  wastewater,  solid-waste,  and  heating  tariffs  to  meet  cost \nrecovery  targets;  and  (vi)  unforeseen  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nissues,  which  could  constrain  the  efficient  implementation  of  the  project \nworks and the restoration of livelihoods of the affected persons. The Project \ndoes not have any unusual technical risks.  \n\nThe  project  components  will  use  standard  technology  that  conforms  to \ninternational  standards.  Specific  construction  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  the \nuse  of  experienced  consultants  to  prepare  designs  and  monitor  project \nimplementation. \n\nRisks

recommendation on a proposed loan to \n\n1. \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Jilin Urban Environmental Improvement Project. \n\n2. \nIn line with its long-term goals for the urban sector of improving living conditions, expanding \nthe supply of clean water, and enhancing wastewater treatment coverage, the Government of the \nPRC requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help increase the water supply, wastewater \ntreatment,  and  solid-waste  management  (SWM)  capacity  in  Changchun,  and  water  supply  and \nwastewater treatment capacity and energy efficient central heating in Yanji in Jilin province in the \nnortheast  of  the  PRC.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  water  policy1  and  will  help  the  PRC \nachieve  Millennium  Development  Goal  7,  target  10  which  calls  for  a  halving  of  the  proportion  of \npeople without access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation by 2015. This report is based \non  the  findings  of  the  Loan  Appraisal  Mission  and  discussions  with  the  central  and  local \ngovernments,  relevant  agencies,  and  community  organizations.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nSince  the  PRC  initiated  economic  reforms  in  1978,  rapid  urbanization  has  accompanied \nsignificant economic progress. The urban population has grown from 160 million in 1975 to about \n562 million in 2005, and the urbanization rate increased from 17% to 43%. The rate is expected to \nreach  47%  in  2010,  50%  in  2015,  and  55%  (or  about  700  million)  in  2030.  The  Government\u2019s \nAgenda  for  Economic  Reform  and  Social  Development  in  the  New  Century2  aims  to  accelerate \nurbanization  and  the  development  of  towns  and  cities,  particularly  in  metropolitan  areas.  The \nincreasing  urban  population,  industrialization,  and  economic  development  are  straining  the \noverloaded infrastructure and contributing to widespread pollution and environmental threats in the \nPRC\u2019s cities. In particular, cities in the north and west experience widespread pollution due to the \ndischarge of untreated wastewater, improper management of solid wastes, and inefficient burning \nof coal for heating. Without significant investment there will be a deterioration in the quality of life \nfor urban residents, degradation of the urban environment, and inefficient economic development.  \n\n4. \nMunicipal water supply in the PRC has increased steadily in the past decade. In 2005, total \nwater production was 29.8 billion cubic meters per day (m3/day) and sales were 25.8 billion m3/day,\nwith  unaccounted-for  water  at  15%  of  total  water  production.  Industrial  water  sales  account  for \n35.4%  of  water  sold  and  domestic  sales  account  for  56.4%,  while  other  sales  are  8.2%.  The \nnational  average  water  use  was  365  liters  per  person  per  day;  domestic  consumption  was  220 \nliters per person per day. In most large cities in the PRC more than 90% of all urban households \nhave access to piped water. However, this coverage indicator obscures shortages in many cities of \ngood  quality  raw  water  supply,  water  supply  delivery  capacities,  and  wastewater  treatment \nfacilities.  The  Government  has  classified  more  than  300  cities  as  water-short,  with  108  having \nserious  water  problems  and  more  than  60  being  critically  short  of  water.  The  situation  has  been \nexacerbated  by  the  pollution  of  raw  water  sources  by  the  discharge  of  inadequately  treated \nagricultural, municipal, and industrial wastewater. \n\n5. \nThe  PRC\u2019s  urban  areas  face  environmental  threats  from  pollution  of  rivers,  lakes,  and \nunderground  aquifers  by  untreated  water.  In  2004,  about  48.2  billion  cubic  meters  (m3)  of \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2001. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n2    The  Government\u2019s  long-term  vision  for  development  was  set  out  during  the  16th  Party  Congress  held  in  November \n\n2000 and reiterated during the 10th National People\u2019s Congress held in March 2003.  \n\n\f2\n\nwastewater  were  generated;  about  54%  of  this  was  from  municipal  sources  and  46%  from \nindustrial  sources.  Currently,  about  90%  of  industrial  wastewater  is  treated  before  discharge  to  a \nmunicipal sewer. Municipal wastewater is a major contributor to pollution of the PRC\u2019s rivers and \nlakes. As of 2005, only about 52% of urban wastewater was treated (compared with 34% in 2000); \nthe rest was discharged untreated to rivers and lakes. About 41.8% of the water in the seven major \nriver  basins3  does  not  meet  the  class  III  national  water  quality  standard.4  Surface  water  sources \nserving  municipal  water  supply  systems  are  polluted  to  levels  unacceptable  under  water  quality \nstandards.\n\nIn  2005,  the  PRC  generated  156  million  tons  of  solid  waste,  representing  an  increase  of \n6. \n32.2% from the 2001 volume of 118 million tons. However, the increase in the treatment capacity \nhas not kept pace with the increased solid-waste volume. In addition to direct adverse impacts on \npublic  health,  the  growing  and  uncontrolled  disposal  of  solid  waste  contributes  to  increasing \ncontamination of groundwater supplies through inadequate leachate collection systems.5\n\n7. \nIn  the  PRC\u2019s  11th  Five  Year  Program  (FYP)  covering  2006\u20132010,  the  Government  has \nprioritized  addressing  environmental  issues,  including  water  and  air  pollution,  through  policy \nreform,  increased  investment,  and  improved  urban  infrastructure  management.  Recognizing  that \nadequate  environmental  protection  and  pollution  controls  are  essential  for  sustainable  economic \ngrowth, the Government has made environmental protection a national priority in its development \nstrategy.  In  addition  to  enacting  environmental  protection  laws  and  implementing  regulations  that \nemphasize  preventive  measures  (the  polluter-pays  principle)  and  decentralized  environmental \nmanagement, \nfor  wastewater \nthe  Government  has  also  undertaken  numerous  programs \nmanagement.6  These  programs  included  (i)  the  requirement  of  industries  to  treat  wastewater  to \nnational wastewater discharge standards by the end of 2000, (ii) 5-year plans for municipalities to \naddress  wastewater  collection,  treatment,  and  disposal,  and  (iii)  the  development  and  partial \nimplementation  of  pollution  control  plans  for  the  key  river  basins.  The  Government  has  decreed7\nthat  by  2010  the  wastewater  treatment  rate  in  all  the  cities  in  the  PRC  should  not  be  lower  than \n60%,  and  not  lower  than  70%  for  major  cities  with  secondary  treatment  facilities.8  The  treatment \nlevel  required  is  dependent  on  the  water  quality  class  of  the  receiving  water.  To  achieve  water \nquality class I, II, or III, secondary wastewater treatment would normally be required.  \n\n8. \nThe  Government  has  accorded  priority  in  the  11th  FYP  to  addressing  water  supply  and \nwastewater  treatment  issues  through  policy  reform,  increased  investment,  and  improved  urban \ninfrastructure  management.  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  focuses  on  (i)  developing  water  sources; \n(ii) protecting existing sources by controlling industrial and residential pollution; (iii) controlling over-\nextraction  of  groundwater  resources;  (iv)  introducing  water-efficient  technologies  and  operations; \nand (v) using appropriate pricing mechanisms to encourage conservation and generate necessary \nfunds  for  operation,  maintenance,  and  investment.  The  Government\u2019s  ongoing  economic  and \nenterprise  reform  programs  require  that  all  water  supply  and  wastewater  projects  be  financially \nsustainable and capable of cost recovery.  \n\n                                                \n3   Changjiang (Yangtze River), Haihe, Huaihe, Huanghe Liaohe, Songhuajiang, and Zhujiang.  \n4  The  PRC  water  quality  standards  have  five  classes  of  quality  covering  about  40  pollution  parameters.  Class  I  is \npristine, while class V is suitable only for industrial use. Class III is the minimum  water quality required for municipal \nwater supply. \n\n5  Leachate is liquid percolated from solid-waste landfills or dumps; it can contain undesirable or toxic chemicals.    \n6  The Law of the PRC on Prevention and Control  of Water Pollution  was  first adopted in 1984 and amended in 1996. \nThe law was enacted for the purpose of (i) preventing and controlling water pollution, (ii) protecting and improving the \nenvironment,  (iii)  safeguarding  human  health,  and  (iv)  ensuring  effective  utilization  of  water  resources.  The  law  also \nestablishes  the  standards  for  water  environment  quality  and  for  discharge  of  water  pollutants,  and  also  defines  the \nplanning, supervision, and management of the prevention and control of water pollution. \n\n7   Ministry of Construction. 2000.

PRC.\n8  These include cities directly under the central Government, provincial capital cities, and key tourist cities. \n\n\f3\n\nIn the PRC, central heating in terms of square meters (m2) recorded an annual growth rate \n9. \nof  16%  between  1992  and  2004.  Nationwide  residential  buildings  account  for  about  70%  of  the \ntotal  heating  space,  with  commercial  and  public  buildings  accounting  for  the  remaining  30%. \nHeating demand in Jilin province has also grown rapidly during the past decade. In the PRC, over \n60  million  tons  of  coal  are  burned  by  500,000  small,  inefficient,  coal-fired  heating  boilers  every \nyear,  resulting  in  the  emission  of  substantial  amounts  of  sulfur  dioxide,  carbon  dioxide,  nitrogen \noxide,  and  total  suspended  particulates.  The  majority  of  urban  heating  supply  comes  from  these \nsmall  boilers,  creating  severe  air  pollution  problems  in  urban  areas.  An  urban  sector  analysis  is \nprovided in Appendix 2. \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n10. \nKey  problems  and  opportunities  include  (i)  a  shortage  of  good  quality  drinking  water,  (ii) \ninadequate  wastewater  treatment  capacity,  (iii)  inadequate  SWM  facilities  and  services,  (iv)  land \nsubsidence  arising  from  the  overuse  of  groundwater,  (v)  making  water  supply  and  wastewater \ntreatment self-financing through tariff reforms, and (vi) severe air pollution in urban areas through \nuse of small, inefficient, coal-fired boilers for heating.  \n\n11. \nThe  Project  cities  are  Changchun  (with  an  urban  population  of  3.2  million)  and  Yanji \n(420,400).  Changchun,  the  capital  of  Jilin  province,  is  an  industrial,  communication,  and \ntransportation  center  in  the  northeast  of  the  PRC.  Major  industries  include  automobile  and \nautomobile  parts  manufacturing,  agricultural  products  and  by-products  refining,  and  high-tech \nmanufacturing. Yanji is the capital of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture bordering Russia \nand the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It is the economic center of east Jilin province and \nis  one  of  the  most  developed  cities  in  the  province.  Key  industrial  sectors  include  food, \npharmaceuticals, textiles, farm machinery, and bus manufacture.  \n\nSonghua River Basin (SRB). The SRB is the third largest river basin in the PRC after the \n12.\nYangtze and Yellow rivers. It has an area of 557,000 square kilometers (km2) and a population of \n62 million. Major cities such as Changchun and Harbin, as well as the PRC\u2019s largest oil fields, are \nlocated  in  the  basin.  Agriculture  is  well  developed  and  there  is  a  large  industrial  base.  The \nSonghua  River  catchment  area  covers  portions  of  three  provinces\u2014Jilin  and  Heilongjiang \nprovinces  and  the  autonomous  region  of  Inner  Mongolia.  Changchun  is  located  in  the  upstream \npart of the Songhua River which flows through Harbin. After Harbin, the river joins the Heilongjiang \nRiver, enters Russia, and eventually discharges into the sea.  \n\n13. \nLike other river basins in the PRC, the SRB is seriously polluted and is now acknowledged \nby the State Environmental Protection Administration as being one of the four most polluted river \nbasins  in  the  PRC.  Pollution  is  recognized  as  impairing  both  natural  resources  and  economic \ndevelopment within the region. Water pollution issues within the SRB, especially in relation to the \nprotection  of  drinking  water  resources  for  the  municipality  of  Harbin,  have  received  increased \nnational  and  international  attention  due  to  the  recent  widely  publicized  pollution  incident  in  the \nSRB.  The  pollution  is  mainly  due  to  the  discharge  of  untreated  or  partially  treated  wastewater  in \nJilin  and  Heilongjiang  provinces.  The  Songhua  River,  which  is  contaminated  with  a  number  of \nknown and suspected trace organic chemicals, metals, and conventional pollutants, is classified by \nthe  Government  as  class  IV  (falling  below  class  V  during  the  6\u2013month,  low-flow  winter  season), \nand is considered unsuitable for municipal domestic use. The river water consistently fails to meet \nPRC class III standards\u2014the minimum quality required for the water to be used as the source for \nwater  supply.  In  March  2003,  ADB  approved  the  Harbin  Water  Supply  Project9  to  address  the \nneeds  of  Harbin  city,  with  a  population  of  3  million,  for  clean  and  reliable  drinking  water  from  an \n\n                                                \n9    ADB.  2003.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Harbin Water Supply Project. Manila. Several districts are already receiving the new \nhigh quality project water.\n\n\f4\n\nalternative  water  source  (the  Lalin  River),  since  the  existing  source  from  the  Songhua  River  was \nhighly  polluted.  Because  of  the  deteriorating  water  quality  in  the  Songhua  River,  the  Harbin \nmunicipal government expedited construction of the Project, which was completed 1 year ahead of \nschedule.\n\nProject Rationale. The major rivers in Changchun (the Yitong and Yongchun) flow into the \n14.\nSRB.  In  Yanji,  the  Buerhatong  River  crosses  the  urban  area  from  west  to  east  and  eventually \nempties  into  the  Tumen  River.  Underdevelopment  of  wastewater  collection  and  wastewater \ntreatment in Changchun and Yanji leads to the discharge of untreated wastewater into local rivers, \nand eventually to the pollution of the Songhua and Tumen rivers. Water quality in the Yitong and \nYongchun rivers in Changchun does not meet class V of the PRC Surface Water Quality Standard. \nDue to the discharge of untreated wastewater into the Buerhatong River, water quality in the Yanji \nsection  of  the  river  has  deteriorated  from  class  III  to  class  IV.  The  lack  of  adequate  wastewater \nmanagement  degrades  local  rivers,  poses  a  threat  to  public  health,  and  adversely  affects  the \nquality of life in Changchun and Yanji. There is an urgent need to expand the sewer network and \nwastewater treatment capacity in Changchun and Yanji to improve water quality in the Yitong and \nBuerhatong rivers. The Yanji municipal government (YMG) has just completed the construction of a \n100,000 m3/day wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), which will help to achieve 95% treatment of \nmunicipal wastewater discharge in Yanji. In order for this capacity to be fully utilized, improvements \nin the sewer network are urgently required. \n\nChangchun and Yanji rely primarily on surface water for their water supply. Their per capita \n15. \nproduction levels are well within the normal range for the PRC.10 Under normal conditions, water \ndemand  is  expected  to  exhaust  developed  capacity  in  both  Changchun  and  Yanji  by  2010.  Both \ncities experienced water supply problems during a severe episode of drought in 2004, leading to \ndangerously low water levels in reservoirs and a resulting loss of effective treatment plant capacity. \nChangchun and Yanji experienced low water pressure and supply interruptions.  \n\nChangchun  has  a  domestic  SWM  system  featuring  domestic  waste11  pick-up,  extensive \n16. \ninformal recovery of recyclable material, and disposal in a managed landfill. Given that the present \nlandfill  site  will  be  fully  utilized  within  2  years,  timely  construction  of  a  new  domestic  solid-waste \ntreatment facility is urgently needed.  \n\nJilin  province  has  a  critical  role  to  play  in  integrated  water  and  wastewater  management, \n17. \nand  SWM  in  the  SRB.  In  2002,  during  the  processing  of  the  Harbin  Water  Supply  Project, \nextensive  dialogue  was  conducted  with  the  Government  on  addressing  pollution  control  in  the \nSRB. Consequently, ADB provided a technical assistance (TA) project for the Songhua River Basin \nWater Quality and Pollution Control Management.12 The TA project, which was considered highly \nsuccessful, (i) strengthened the capacity of the Songhua Water Resources Protection Bureau, (ii) \nassisted the Government in developing a long-term water pollution control plan for the SRB beyond \n2010,  and  (iii)  provided  strategic  policy  inputs  to  the  11th  FYP  and  the  SRB  Water  Pollution \nPrevention  and  Control  Plan  (SRBPCP).13  The  SRBPCP  is  a  Government-approved  action \nprogram  to  set  pollution  control  targets  from  2006  to  2010,  requiring  that  urban  environmental \npollution  and  ecological  damage  be  controlled  by  2010.  The  ongoing  Jilin  Water  Supply  and \nSewerage  Development  Project  (JWSSD),14  with  an  ADB  loan  of  $100  million,  is  the  first  major \nADB investment directly addressing pollution control in the SRB. It will help Changchun achieve a \n                                                \n10 211 liters per person per day for Yanji and 327 liters per person per day for Changchun. \n11 Domestic waste in the PRC includes residential and institutional waste. \n12 ADB.  2002.

The  Project  will  also  help  Yanji  achieve  a \nwastewater treatment rate of 95% by 2012. \n\nADB  will  implement  a  project  preparatory  TA16  for  an  ensuing  project  in  2008,  for  the \n18. \nSonghua River Basin Water Pollution Control and Management Project with an indicative ADB loan \nof $200 million. This would be the third major investment in the context of the SRBPCP, and ADB\u2019s \nfourth  in  the  SRB.  This  comprehensive  strategic  approach  to  addressing  pollution  control  in  the \nSRB  will  serve  as  a  good  model  for  replication  elsewhere  in  the  PRC.  At  the  Stockholm  World \nWater Forum (12\u201318 August 2007), ADB and the Global Water Partnership convened a session to \nreview  and  share  experience  on  integrated  water  resource  management  (IWRM)  in  river  basins, \nspecifically  focusing  on  ADB  IWRM  projects  in  the  PRC  and  in  Central  Asia,  including  among \nothers, the SRB.17\n\n19. \nThe existing central heating plant in Yanji is supplying heat to the city\u2019s downtown area. It \nonly covers an area of 2 million m2 (or 15% of the city) due to its limited capacity and incomplete \nheating distribution network coverage. It is inefficient because (i) the retrofitted distribution system \nthat it uses does not allow efficient hot water delivery, and (ii) the plant is an older single purpose \ndesign  that  fails  to  achieve  the  efficiencies  possible  with  newer  cogeneration  (heat  and  power) \nplants.  The  remaining  area  is  heated  by  approximately  318  small  inefficient  boilers,  resulting  in \ntotal suspended particulates in the urban area averaging 0.38 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3), \nmore  than  twice  the  state  environmental  standard  of  0.15  mg/m3.  Yanji  will  construct  a  new \ncogeneration  plant18  which  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  2010,  allowing  complete  coverage  of \nthe city with a central heating service. In this regard, new heating distribution networks that connect \nthe existing central heating plant and the new cogeneration plant with the rest of the city need to be \ncompleted  to  effectively  utilize  the  city\u2019s  central  heating  supply  capacity.  The  proposed  Project19\nwill (i) complete the urgently needed central heating distribution networks for Yanji, (ii) lead to the \nclosure  and  replacement  of  the  318  polluting  coal-based  boilers,20  and  (iii)  result  in  a  major \nimprovement in the air quality of Yanji, which will contribute significantly to public health in Yanji. \n\nPolicy  Dialogue.  The  Project  builds  on  ADB  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  in \n20.\nseveral  key  areas  including  (i)  cost  recovery  and  tariff  reform,  (ii)  wastewater  management,  (iii) \nupstream  and  basin-wide  pollution  prevention  and  control,  (iv)  water  conservation,  (v)  corporate \ngovernance and enterprise reform, and (vi) private sector participation.  \n\nADB  has  supported  the  water  tariff  reform  process  through  two  water  tariff  TA  projects21\n21. \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Construction  under  which  the  market-oriented  National  Guidelines  on  Water \nTariffs  were  developed,  promulgated,  and  implemented.  The  water  tariff  TA  projects  (i) \n\n                                                \n15  State  government  policies  require  that  urban  environmental  pollution  and  ecological  damage  be  controlled  by  2010. \n\nMajor cities, including provincial capitals, should attain a wastewater treatment rate of 70% by 2010. \n\n16 ADB. 2007.

In 2003, the NDRC confirmed that the 1995 approval was still valid. The Feasibility Study Report has \nbeen submitted to the NDRC for approval which is expected by December 2007. Construction works will start in 2008 \nand be completed by 2010. This cogeneration plant is outside the scope of the proposed Project and is being financed \ndomestically. The detailed engineering design work is underway. \n\n19 The central heating component accounts for 13% of the total investment cost of the Project. \n20 Originally there were 700 coal-based boilers. YMG has so far closed 382 boilers and the remaining 318 boilers will be \n\nclosed during implementation of the proposed Project.  \n\n21 ADB. 1997.

Manila. \n\n\f6\n\nstrengthened  the  financial  sustainability  of  municipal  water  supply  companies;  (ii)  piloted \nimplementation  of  the  national  guidelines  in  the  selected  case-study  cities  of  Chengdu,  Fuzhou, \nand  Zhangjiakou;  (iii)  recommended  financial  regulations  for  water  supply  companies;  and  (iv) \ndesigned nationwide training programs. The guidelines are being implemented nationwide. Further, \nan  ADB  wastewater  tariff  TA22  developed  and  recommended  national  guidelines  for  wastewater \ntariffs,  including  tariff  calculation  methodologies  that  allow  for  full  cost  recovery,  taking  into \nconsideration  affordability  and  social  constraints.  By  2008  the  Changchun  municipal  government \n(CMG)  plans  to  increase  water  tariffs  from  CNY2.1/m3  to  CNY2.7/m3 and  wastewater  tariffs  from \nCNY0.4/m3  to  CNY0.8/m3.  CMG  has  scheduled  public  hearing  meetings  in  2007  to  discuss  the \nproposed water and wastewater tariff increases. YMG has already held a public hearing meeting to \ndiscuss  increasing  the  water  tariffs  from  CNY1.6/m3  to  CNY3.4/m3,  and  wastewater  tariffs  from \nCNY0.4/m3 to CNY0.8/m3 by 2008. After the second public hearing meeting scheduled for October \n2007,  the  new  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  in Yanji  will  become  effective  in  2008.  This  indicates \nChangchun\u2019s  and  Yanji\u2019s  progressiveness  in  adopting  tariff  reforms.23  The  policy  dialogue  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix A.\n\n22. \nThe  water  and  wastewater  tariff  increases  under  the  Project  are  important  steps  towards \nachieving  full  cost  recovery,  which  is  needed  to  attract  private  sector  participation  (PSP)  in \nChangchun and Yanji. An assurance is included requiring CMG and YMG to ensure that water and \nwastewater  tariffs  are  set  at  levels  that  ensures  full  cost  recovery  of  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M), depreciation, and financial costs including debt service obligations and a reasonable profit \nmargin  for  water  and  wastewater  treatment.  This  would  ensure  full  cost  recovery  at  the  start  of \nproject  operations,  and  financial  sustainability  of  the  Project.  ADB  has  also  provided  technical \nassistance support to the Government on the use of market-based instruments to enhance private \nsector  partnerships  in  public  utilities,  mainly  for  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  SWM.24  This  TA \nprovided  an  analysis  of  the  issues  in  the  context  of  international  best  practices  and  how  these \ncould be adopted in the PRC. During project processing, the main features of the ADB-supported \nChengdu  build-operate-transfer  project  were  discussed  with  CMG,  YMG,  and  the  implementing \nagencies (IAs); and those involved indicated interest in this modality of private sector involvement \nfor  future  investments.  Completed  in  February  2002,  the  build-operate-transfer  plant  is  delivering \nits contracted capacity to Chengdu municipality, providing an additional source of clean water to its \nresidents. The Nanjing experience of public\u2013private partnership, with public investments supporting \nan enabling environment for a utility bond issue, was also discussed and disseminated. The Jilin \nprovincial  government  (JPG)  has  expressed  its  interest  in  exploring  a  similar  approach  for  Jilin \nprovince and requested more detailed information. Further, the PRC Resident Mission and Private \nSector  Operations  Department  conducted  a  seminar  in  Beijing  on  25  July  2007  on  ADB\u2019s \nnonsovereign lending modality for the provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin. The proposed Project will \ncreate  the  environment  necessary  for  eventual  PSP  by  pursuing  tariff  reform,  full  cost  recovery, \nenterprise  reform,  and  improved  governance;  all  are  prerequisites  for  private  sector  involvement. \nOther forms of PSP, including leasing contracts and joint ventures, were also reviewed. As a result \nof  tariff  reforms  and  increases,  the  IAs  would  become  financially  sustainable,  and  be  able  to \ngenerate  funds  for  future  water  and  wastewater  expansion  projects.  Consequently,  the  tariff \nreforms and capacity building under the Project would contribute to improved governance. \n\nExternal  Assistance.  External  assistance  to  JPG  has  principally  been  provided  by  ADB \n23.\nand the World Bank. Since 1992, ADB has provided 22 loans totaling $2.5 billion to the PRC for \nurban  development  and  environment  projects  (Appendix  3).  ADB  also  has  provided  about  $46.3 \nmillion  for  about  70  TA  studies  to  prepare  these  projects,  and  to  review  and  study  key  issues  in \nwater resources, urban water supply, wastewater treatment, pollution control, and heating.  \n\n                                                \n22 ADB. 2001.

ADB\u2019s water supply loan projects in the PRC have generally been well \n24.\nimplemented.25 The lessons identified from post-evaluation of water supply and sanitation projects \nhighlight the importance of integrating both supply and demand concerns into the project design. \nEncouraging  broad  reforms,  such  as  commercial  management,  and  introducing  competition  will \npromote  efficient  and  responsive  delivery  of  water  supply  and  wastewater  services.  Appropriate \npricing  policies  for  water  and  sanitation  services  are  also  required.  Lessons  from  the  ongoing \nJWSSD project was also considered. Other lessons include the need to (i) review technical designs \nthoroughly; (ii) consider local conditions and constraints; (iii) support financial reform, particularly in \nestablishing  autonomous  wastewater  entities  and  tariff  increases,  to  ensure  sustainability;  (iv) \nstrengthen institutions, particularly by giving them managerial autonomy; (v) educate the public in \nenvironmental  improvement;  (vi)  consult  the  public  and  involve  the  community;  (vii)  address \nresettlement  issues  early;  and  (viii)  support  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  water  supply  and \nwastewater treatment.\n\n25. \nA  recently  completed  performance  portfolio  review  of  the  water  supply,  sanitation,  and \nwaste  management  sector26  identified  successes  and  deficiencies,  and  lessons  from  portfolio \nperformance.  These  along  with  the  recently  completed  PRC  Country  Assistance  Program \nEvaluation were considered.27 Among the major issues identified were (i) delays in the start-up of \nprojects  and  in  procurement,  (ii)  weak  institutional  arrangements  for  project  implementation  and \nsustainable operations, and  (iii)  a low  proportion  of  civil  works  financing  resulting in  loan  savings \nand  cancellation  of  surplus  loan  amounts.  To  ensure  that  there  is  no  duplication  of  effort,  during \nproject processing, lessons learned were taken into consideration by (i) thoroughly evaluating the \ntechnical designs and technologies, (ii) ensuring an adequate debt-equity ratio for the project IAs, \n(iii) undertaking rigorous sensitivity analysis of cash flows and financial and economic analysis, and \n(iv) incorporating institutional strengthening measures to improve the level of corporate governance \ntaking into account the capacity-development components included in the JWSSD project. \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n26. \nThe impact of the Project is to enhance the urban environment and improve public health \nand  quality  of  life  for  urban  residents  in  the  cities  of  Changchun  and  Yanji  by  (i)  increasing \nwastewater  coverage,  (ii)  enhancing  SWM,  (iii)  improving  the  supply  of  potable  water,  and  (iv) \nreducing  air  pollution.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  improved  water  supply,  wastewater \nmanagement, SWM, and efficient central heating services in Changchun and Yanji.   \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n27. \nThe  Project  has  three  components  and  related  capacity  development,  broken  down  into \nseven  subcomponents  (outputs)  and  35  activities  as  indicated  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework.  These  will  contribute  to,  and  support,  Changchun\u2019s  and  Yanji\u2019s  11th  FYP  and  the \nSRBPCP. The components include (i) improved and expanded water supply, wastewater services, \nand  SWM  in  Changchun;  (ii)  improved  and  expanded  water  supply  and  wastewater  facilities  in \nYanji;  and  (iii)  improved  air  quality  in  Yanji  through  a  more  efficient  central  heating  system.

The third subcomponent is the construction of a \nsanitary  landfill  facility  with  a  capacity  of  2,600  tons  per  day  with  a  10-year  service  life,  and  an \nadditional expected life of 12 years after expansion.  \n\nComponent  II:  The  Yanji  urban  infrastructure  has  two  subcomponents:  (i)  water  supply, \n29.\nand (ii) wastewater treatment. The first subcomponent is the construction of a WTP with a capacity \nof 60,000 m3/day, 10.5 km of raw water transmission pipelines, 9 km of distribution mains, and 35.7 \nkm  of  water  distribution  pipelines.  The  second  subcomponent  is  the  construction  of  an  effluent \nreuse WWTP with a capacity of 50,000 m3/day, 15.1 km of water reuse transmission mains, and 40 \nkm of sewer network.\n\nComponent  III:  The  Yanji  central  heating  component  has  two  subcomponents,  both  for \n30.\ncentral  heating.  The  first  subcomponent  will  provide  central heating  to  an  area  of  6.97  million  m2\nsouth  of  the  Buerhatong  River,  and  includes  42.52  km  of  heating  pipelines,  6.2  km  of  steam \npipelines,  35  heat-exchange  stations,  and  one  booster  pumping  station.  The  second \nsubcomponent  will  provide  central  heating  to  an  area  of  9.3  million  m2  north  of  the  Buerhatong \nRiver, and includes 77.6 km of heating pipelines, and 64 heat-exchange stations.  \n\n31. \nThe  Project  also  provides  for  institutional  capacity  development  for  effective  project \nmanagement  including  (i)  providing  training  to  strengthen  organizational  structures  and  staff \nresources  to  implement,  operate,  and  maintain  the  project  components;  (ii)  strengthening \nmanagement  practices  in  human  resources,  finance,  and  corporate  planning;  and  (iii)  providing \nmanagers and service-delivery staff to ensure efficient implementation and sustainability of project \nbenefits. The Project will strengthen institutional capacity to facilitate the adoption of an integrated \napproach to water resource management, including pollution control. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n32. \nThe  Project  is  a  multisector  urban  environmental  improvement  project  which  aims  to \nintegrate  urban  development  and  environmental  management  to  ensure  long-term  sustainable \ngrowth.\n\nIntegrated  River  Basin  Management.  The  proposed  Project  is  not  a  stand-alone \n33.\ninvestment,  but  is  an  integral  part  of  the  basin-wide  Songhua  water  resources  management \ninitiative,  the  SRBPCP,  and  the  Changchun  city  master  plan.  The  proposed  Project  will \ncomplement  the  ongoing  JWSSD  project  and  provide  the  critical  10%  capacity  required  for \nChangchun  city  to  achieve  its  treatment  target  of  80%  of  the  wastewater  generated  by  2012.  In \nYanji,  the  Project  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Yanji  city  master  plan  targeting  a  95%  wastewater \ntreatment  rate  by  2011  and  related  pollution  control  in  the  Buerhatong  River.  The  water  quality \nimprovements in the SRB and Buerhatong River will also contribute to (i) integrated water resource \nthe  basin-wide  management  program,  and  (iii) \nmanagement  and  pollution  control,  (ii) \n\n                                                \n28 Two additional pumping stations will be upgraded. \n\n\f9\n\ntransboundary pollution prevention and control. The Project also includes (i) training in the O&M of \nwater  supply  and  wastewater  facilities  to  ensure  effective  operation,  (ii)  monitoring  of  future \nperformance of O&M of the water and wastewater facilities using a number of indicators outlined in \nthe design and monitoring framework, and (iii) demonstration of the potential economic benefits of \nan integrated and strategic long-term approach to planning of water supply wastewater and SWM \nfacilities.  The  proposed  Project  reflects  a  continuation  of  ADB\u2019s  effort  for  the  environmental \nimprovement of the SRB following the JWSSD project. Lessons learned from the JWSSD project \nregarding the integration of wastewater treatment, water reuse, and water resource protection are \ncontinued  and  improved  under  the  proposed  Project.  Further,  the  proposed  Project  focuses  on \nstrengthening the environmental management institution and mechanism for seeking continuously \nimproved environmental performance, and initiating a policy dialogue on integrated, water resource \nand river basin management.\n\nTariff Reform. CMG and YMG have committed to generate funds to finance the water and \n34.\nwastewater subcomponents of the Project from water and wastewater tariff increases estimated at \n$35  million.  This  is  a  major  reform  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  water  policy  (see  footnote  1).  The  planned \nwater  and  wastewater  tariff  increases  (see  para.  20)  will  contribute  to  (i)  water  conservation  and \nrecycling of industrial water, (ii) financial sustainability of the Project, and (iii) PSP in the water and \nwastewater sectors in Changchun and Yanji.  \n\nOptimum  Design.  Through  rigorous  least-cost  analysis  and  engineering  consulting,  the \n35.\ntechnical design of the Project was optimized. Consequently, the resettlement impact of the Project \nwas  reduced  by  16%,  resulting  in  a  reduction  of  the  resettlement  cost.  The  design  optimization \nanalysis is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n\nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n36. \nThe  project  investment  is  estimated  at  $352.68  million  equivalent,  including  taxes  and \nduties.  The  cost  estimates  are  summarized  in  Table  1  and  detailed  in  Appendix  4  and \nSupplementary Appendix D.\n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\n \n \n \n\na.

The  Government  of  the  PRC  will  relend  the  loan  proceeds  to \n39. \nJPG. In the case of the Changchun Dongnan WWTP, a portion of the loan proceeds will be onlent \nfrom JPG to CMG and then to the Jingyuetan Administration Committee, both on the same terms \nand conditions as those of the ADB loan; this portion of the loan proceeds will then be onlent to the \nJingyue  district  government,  and  then  to  Changchun  Jingyuetan  Tourism  Construction  Group \nLimited Company as the IA. In all other cases in Changchun, JPG will onlend another portion of the \nloan  proceeds  to  CMG  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan;  such  loan \nproceeds  will  then  be  onlent  to  the  IAs  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions.  In  the  case  of  the \nsubcomponents in Yanji, the remaining portion of the loan proceeds will be onlent from JPG to the \nYanbian  Korean  Autonomous  Prefecture  and  then  to  YMG  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions as \nthose  of  the  ADB  loan;  the  loan  proceeds  will  then  be  onlent  to  the  IAs  on  the  same  terms  and \n\n                                                \n29 Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and China Construction Bank. \n\n\fconditions. In all cases in Changchun and Yanji, the IAs will bear the risks of foreign exchange and \ninterest  rate  variation  for  their  portion  of  the  loan  proceeds,  and  undertake  to  perform  the \nobligations  as  provided  in  the  Project  Agreement  applicable  to  the  IAs.  The  flow  of  funds  and \nonlending arrangements are shown in Appendix 5. \n\n11\n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nThe executing agency will be JPG. A project leading group (PLG) was established, headed \n40. \nby  the  vice-governor  of  JPG  and  comprising  the  heads  of  the  Jilin  Development  Reform \nCommission, the Jilin Construction Bureau, and the Jilin Finance Bureau, and the mayors of CMG \nand  YMG.  The  PLG  will  provide  overall  policy  guidance,  facilitate  interagency  coordination,  and \nresolve  any  institutional  problems  affecting  project  implementation.  A  project  management  office \n(PMO) was established at the JPG level led by the Jilin Construction Bureau. The PMO will also be \nthe secretariat of the PLG. Project implementing units (PIUs) were established in CMG and YMG, \nand they will report to the PMO and also coordinate and monitor activities of the project IAs. The \nPMO  already  has  experience  in  implementing  ADB  projects  since  it  is  also  the  PMO  for  the \nongoing JWSSD project. The IAs are limited liability companies incorporated under PRC company \nlaw.30 A board of directors will oversee financial and operational matters of each IA including (i) the \nhiring  and  firing  of  senior  management,  (ii)  reviewing  staffing  and  remuneration  plans,  (iii) \nreviewing the progress of construction and approving annual construction plans, (iv) reviewing and \napproving  annual  financial  budgets,  (v)  reviewing  the  investment  plans  and  accounts  of  the  IAs, \nand  (vi)  approving  the  procurement  of  major  equipment  and  civil  works  contracts.  The  IAs  will \nincrease their staff strength significantly for the construction period and when operations begin.  \n\n41. \nThe  six  IAs  are  (i)  Changchun  Water  Supply  Company  for  the  Changchun  water  supply \nsubcomponent,  (ii)  Yanji  Water  Supply  Company  for  the  Yanji  water  supply  subcomponent,  (iii) \nChangchun  Jingyuetan  Tourism  Construction  Group  Limited  Company  for  the  Changchun \nwastewater  management  subcomponent,  (iv)  Yanji  Sewage  Treatment  Company  for  the  Yanji \nwastewater management component, (v) Changchun Municipal Liya Environmental Sanitation and \nInfrastructure  Construction  Limited  Company  for  the  Changchun  SWM  subcomponent,  and  (vi) \nYanji  Investment  and  Development  Company  for  the  central  heating  subcomponent.  The  internal \ncontrols  and  accounting  and  auditing  procedures  of  the  IAs  were  reviewed  through  a  financial \nmanagement assessment and these are generally in order and will be fully functional and available \nfor use under the Project for the construction and operational phase of the Project. An assessment \nwas undertaken of the IAs technical and institutional capacities, and these are adequate for project \nimplementation.  The  IAs  will  retain  the  services  of  design  institutes,  specialist  procurement \nagencies  and  construction  supervision  companies  to  assist  in  the  implementation  activities.  The \nPMO  and  IAs  will  have  a  number  of  staff  trained  in  project  management  and  relevant  ADB \nprocedures  during  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  financial  management  assessment  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix E. \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  5  years  from  the  end  of  2007  to  2012 \n42. \n(Appendix 6). The implementation period is estimated based on the project scope and construction \ntechnology requirements. The schedule is considered realistic and achievable because the project \nimplementation structure is already in place and preparatory works are underway. \n\n                                                \n30 PRC Company Law. 1993. \n\n\f12\n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n43.\nAll  procurement  of  goods  and  works  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Contracts for goods estimated to \nexceed  $1.0  million  and  contracts  for  works  estimated  to  exceed  $10.0  million  will  be  procured \nusing  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Contracts  for  goods  and  contracts  for  works \nestimated to be equal to or less than the above international competitive bidding values but more \nthan  $100,000  shall  be  procured  on  the  basis  of  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  in \naccordance with the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law (1999), subject to modifications agreed with \nADB.  Contracts  for  goods  and  works  estimated  to  cost  $100,000  or  less  will  be  procured  using \nshopping procedures. More details are provided in Appendix 7. \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n44.      ADB  approved  the  Government\u2019s  request  for  advance  contracting,  which  includes \nrecruitment  of  consultants  and  procurement  of  goods  and  civil  works,  and  the  request  for \nretroactive financing of eligible expenditures up to $20 million (equivalent to 20% of the ADB loan) \nincurred before loan effectiveness, but not earlier than 12 months before the signing of the Loan \nAgreement.31  Advance  contracting  will  include  (i)  tendering  and  bid  evaluation  for  civil  works \ncontract packages; (ii) preparation of tender documents and bid evaluation for the procurement of \nmaterials,  plant,  equipment,  and  vehicles;  and  (iii)  recruitment  of  consultants.  The  issuance  of \ninvitations to bid under advance procurement action will be subject to ADB approval. All advance \nprocurement actions will be undertaken in accordance with the Procurement Guidelines or ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) as appropriate. YMG \nhas requested retroactive financing for civil works and equipment for part of the water supply and \ncentral  heating  subcomponents  of  Yanji.  Contracts  proposed  for  retroactive  financing  will  be \nundertaken in accordance with the Procurement Guidelines. The Government, JPG, CMG, YMG, \nand the IAs have also been advised that approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing \ndoes not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n45. \nThe Project provides funding for 18 person-months of international consulting services and \n108 person-months of national consulting services to support the Jilin PMO, Changchun and Yanji \nPIUs, and IAs in project implementation management and capacity development. A consulting firm \nwill be recruited in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using the quality- and \ncost-based  selection  method  (80:20)  and  requesting  full  technical  proposals.  Consulting  services \nare  required  for  (i)  project  management  and  construction  supervision;  (ii)  establishing  the \nmanagement  information  system  and  project  performance  management  systems  (PPMS);  (iii) \npreparing a strategy for reduction of non-revenue water in Changchun and Yanji along with a time-\nbound  action  plan;  (iv)  social,  environmental,  and  resettlement  monitoring;  (v) \nfinancial \nmanagement;  (vi)  assisting  with  private  sector  participation  initiatives;  and  (vii)  improving  O&M. \nCapacity  development  for  the  IAs  will  be  achieved  through  consultant  inputs,  hands-on  training, \nand domestic and international training financed from the loan. The outline terms of reference for \nthe consulting services is in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n\n6. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed \n46. \nwith  CMG,  JPG,  YMG,  and  the  IAs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \n\n                                                \n31 The advance action on the procurement and recruitment of consultants, and the uploading of the general procurement \nnotice to the ADB website, will facilitate the start of the advance action process. ADB management approved advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing on 27 June 2007. \n\n\f13\n\naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To \nsupport  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan \ncovenants and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  CMG,  JPG,  YMG,  IAs,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. For the Project, CMG, JPG, \nand  YMG  will  undertake  the  following  anticorruption  actions:  (i)  involve  full-time  officials  from  the \nprovincial  and  municipal  discipline  investigation  bureaus  in  bidding  and  construction  to  enhance \nconstruction  quality  control  and  supervise  effective  work;  (ii)  introduce  a  dual  signing  system  in \nwhich  the  civil  works  contract  winner  also  signs  an  anticorruption  contract  with  the  employer;  (iii) \nperiodically  inspect  the  contractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  funds  withdrawals  and  settlements;  (iv) \nengage  the  project  management  consultant  to  support  the  PMO  and  the  IAs  to  ensure  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency in project operations; (v) in consultation with relevant \nGovernment  ministries,  update  rules  and  regulations  on  local  and  corporate  governance  and \nanticorruption, and enhance transparency of the IAs\u2019 operations; and (vi) disclose audited financial \nstatements and project accounts and contract awards on the project websites of CMG, JPG, YMG, \nand the IAs. \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nThe  loan  proceeds  for  the  proposed  Project  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n47. \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007, as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  facilitate  project \nimplementation and funds flow, the imprest account will be set up upon loan effectiveness and will \nbe exclusively used to finance the ADB share of eligible expenditures. The imprest account will be \nmanaged by the Jilin Provincial Financial Bureau. The initial advance to be deposited to an imprest \naccount  will  not  exceed  either  6  months  of  estimated  expenditures  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount, \nwhichever is lower. For the large works contracts under the Project, direct payment procedures will \napply.  If  the  Government  initially  funds  eligible  expenditures  from  its  own  resources,  the \nreimbursement  procedures  will  be  used.  To  expedite  funds  flow  and  simplify  documentation \nprocess,  the  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  procedure  will  be  used  for  liquidation  and \nreplenishment  of  imprest  accounts  and  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding \n$200,00032 per individual payment. The payments in excess of the SOE ceiling will be reimbursed, \nliquidated, or replenished based on full supporting documentation.  \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe  PMO  will  prepare  and  submit  semiannual  progress  reports  indicating  (i)  progress \n48. \nmade,  (ii)  problems  encountered  during  the  period  under  review,  (iii)  steps  taken  or  proposed  to \nremedy the problems, (iv) the proposed program of activities, and (v) progress expected in the next \nhalf year. The IAs will keep records to allow the identification of goods and services financed out of \nthe  loan  proceeds,  following  accounting  principles  and  practices  prescribed  by  the  Accounting \nLaw33 of the PRC, which requires enterprises to prepare financial statements and generally follow \ninternationally accepted accounting standards. The IAs will maintain separate project accounts and \nrecords.  The  financial  statements  of  the  project  accounts  and  the  annual  corporate  financial \nstatements for IAs will be subject to external audit by the CMG and YMG audit bureaus, the Jilin \nProvincial  Audit  Bureau,  and  the  State  Audit  Administration.  The  audits  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  regulations  for  auditing  approved  by  the  State  Council  and  will  meet  ADB \nrequirements. A separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the imprest account and SOE will be part \n\n                                                \n32    In  line  with  adequate  financial  capability  of  the  executing  agency  or  IA  based  on  the  financial  management \nassessment, the ceiling of the statement of expenditure is identified at a higher level to facilitate disbursement. \n33 Accounting Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China was adopted by the Ninth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the \n\nSixth National People\u2019s Congress on 21 January 1985. \n\n\f14\n\nof the audit reports. The IAs\u2019 annual audited financial statements and audited project accounts will \nbe  submitted  to  ADB  no  later  than  6  months  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  for  the  entire \nimplementation period. The Government, CMG, JPG, YMG, and the IAs have been informed about \nthe ADB policy requiring the submission of audited financial statements on time. JPG and the IAs \nwill  submit  reports  and  information  to  ADB  concerning  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds,  project \nimplementation, and IA performance. These reports will include (i) semiannual progress reports on \nproject  implementation,  (ii)  annual  reports,  and  (iii)  a  project  completion  report  not  later  than  3 \nmonths after the completion of the project facilities. \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n49. \nThe  PPMS  indicators,  their  relevance,  and  monitoring  practicalities  were  confirmed  and \nagreed  with  the  PMO  and  IAs  during  project  preparation.  These  include  (i)  service  levels;  (ii) \nnonrevenue  water,  water  conservation,  and  treated  water  quality;  (iii)  treated  wastewater  quality \nand other operational performance measures; (iv) percentage of wastewater collected and treated; \n(v)  solid-waste  collection,  transportation,  and  treatment  efficiency  measures;  (vi)  air  pollution \nreduction  indicators;  (vii)  public  satisfaction  with  the  urban  environment;  (viii)  relevant  economic \ndata  to  monitor  project  impacts  on  improved  living  conditions  and  economic  opportunities;  (ix) \nhealth and gender data; (x) the incidence of waterborne, vector-borne, and airborne diseases; and \n(xi) an increase in public awareness of environmental protection.  \n\nAt  the  beginning  of  the  Project,  the  PMO  and  IAs,  with  the  assistance  of  consultants,  will \n50. \ndevelop comprehensive PPMS procedures to generate systematic data on the inputs and outputs \nof the subprojects, as well as the agreed abovementioned indicators to be used to measure project \nimpact.  The  PMO  and  IAs  will  (i)  refine  the  PPMS  framework,  (ii)  confirm  achievable  goals,  (iii) \nconfirm  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and  (iv)  establish  systems  and  procedures  no \nlater  than  6  months  after  loan  effectiveness.  Under  the  PPMS  framework,  baseline  and  progress \ndata will be reported at regular intervals by the PMO and the IAs, including semiannual reporting of \nthe  environmental  management  plan  (EMP).  The  PMO  and  IAs  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing \nand consolidating the data through their management information systems, established at the time \nof loan implementation. The PPMS will be designed to permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial \naction  regarding  project  design,  schedules,  activities,  and  development  impacts.  The  PMO  and \nIAs,  with  the  assistance  of  the  consultants,  will  monitor  and  assess  activities,  and  report  to  ADB \nsemiannually  on  the  physical  implementation  and  financial  aspects  of  the  Project  from \ncommencement  until  2  years  after  project  completion,  to  ensure  that  impacts  are  monitored  and \nreported in line with ADB requirements.\n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n51. \nADB and the Government will jointly review project implementation at least once a year. In \naddition, ADB and the Government will undertake a comprehensive midterm review 2 years after \nthe start of project implementation. This will include a detailed review of the scope, implementation \narrangements,  resettlement,  achievement  of  scheduled  targets,  and  progress  on  the  agenda  for \npolicy reform and capacity-building measures. Feedback from the PPMS activities will be analyzed. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Impacts and Benefits \n\nThe  Project  will  benefit  about  3.6  million  urban  residents  in  the  cities  of  Changchun  and \n52. \nYanji,  whose  living  conditions  and  public  health  standards  will  be  improved  through  (i)  improved \nquality  of  water  supply  and  wastewater  services  and  a  reduction  in  nonpoint  source  pollution \nthrough increased SWM capacity, (ii) a reduction in the incidence of waterborne diseases such as \ndiarrhea and hepatitis A to below 2006 levels (to be monitored through the PPMS), (iii) a reduction \n\n\f15\n\nin the risk of respiratory diseases by improving the central heating system and cutting utilization of \ncoal  by  40%  (or  298,000  tons)  per  heating  season,  and  (iv)  water  savings  of  700,000  m3  per \nheating season through water reuse and reduction of unaccounted-for water. \n\n53. \nThe  Project  will  result  in  improved  management  and  utilization  of  water  resources  in  the \nupper SRB and the Buerhatong River, bringing positive downstream and transjurisdictional benefits \nin  the  province  of  Heilongjiang.  The  water  quality  improvements  in  the  SRB  and  the  Buerhatong \nRiver will also contribute to (i) integrated water resource management and pollution control, (ii) the \nbasin-wide  management  program,  and  (iii)  transboundary  pollution  prevention  and  control.  By \ndeveloping  drinking  water  sources  from  rivers  and  existing  reservoirs  instead  of  relying  solely  on \noverexploited groundwater (use of which has reached unsustainable levels), the Project will secure \nthe  provision  of  a  clean  and  reliable  water  supply  for  Changchun  and  Yanji.  The  proposed \nextension, replacement, and rehabilitation of water distribution systems will increase the proportion \nof  the  population  with  access  to  piped  water  supplies.  These  improvements  in  the  distribution \nsystem  will  reduce  water  losses  and  reduce  the  risk  of  contamination  of  treated  water  within  the \ndistribution  system.  Recycling  wastewater  will  reduce  water  pollution  and  address  the  water \nshortage  problem.  The  reliable  water  supply  will  reduce  the  burden  on  women  responsible  for \ndomestic duties and caring for the sick.  \n\nB. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n54. \nResettlement  impacts  have  been  identified  and  resettlement  plans  (RPs)  have  been \nprepared  in  accordance  with  PRC  laws  and  regulations  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  and \nthe ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The land acquisition and resettlement program \nis designed to ensure that affected persons (APs) will be better off (or at least no worse off) as a \nresult  of  the  Project.  Overall,  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impact  for  the  Project  will  be \nsignificant.  A  total  of  one  full  RP  and  three  short  RPs  with  due-diligence  reports  have  been \nprepared by the IAs with assistance of the local design institute or university. Based on the scope \nof  impacts  identified,  the  Project  will  affect  102  households  (367  persons)  permanently  by  land \nacquisition,  377  households  (1,388  persons)  by  temporary  land  occupation,  relocate  232 \nhouseholds (719  persons)  due  to  the  demolition  of  residential  structures,  and  nine  nonresidential \nstructures  with  49  employees.  Of  the  total  APs,  22  households  (51  persons)  are  of  Korean \nethnicity. A total of 127.49 hectares (ha) of land will be affected permanently (of which 67.03% is \nfarmland),  3,146.25  mu  (209.75  ha)  of  rural  collective  and  state-owned  land  will  be  occupied \ntemporarily, and 32,392.3 m2 of residential houses and 4,296.88 m2 of nonresidential structures will \nbe  demolished.  In  addition,  associated  productive  assets,  ground  attachments,  and  basic \ninfrastructure and facilities will also be affected. \n\n55. \nThe APs will be compensated and resettled in a timely and adequate manner in accordance \nwith the RPs so that they will be made better off (or at least be no worse off) than they would have \nbeen  without  the  Project.  To  compensate  for  the  economic  and  income  losses,  the  following \nmeasures will be implemented during the resettlement process: (i) the Project owners will give the \nAPs priority to be employed in the activities during the project construction and operation, (ii) land \ncompensation will be used as basic social insurance for the farmers whose land is acquired, and \n(iii) secondary and tertiary industries (such as auto accessory manufacturing, community services, \ncommunity  medical  center,  transportation,  restaurant,  and  entertainment  services)  will  be \nexpanded  to  generate  employment  opportunities  and  increase  incomes  of  the  APs.  Vocational \ntraining will be provided to the APs to increase their skills. The total costs of land acquisition and \nresettlement,  including  contingencies,  is  estimated  at  CNY355.59  million  or  $45.60  million.34  The \nsummary  RP  is  in  Appendix  8.  JPG,  CMG,  YMG,  and  the  IAs  have  implemented  ADB\u2019s  Public\n                                                \n34 The base resettlement costs excluding contingencies is estimated at CNY240.03 million or $31.75 million. \n\n\f16\n\nCommunication Policy, which requires full disclosure for the resettlement activities by (i) distributing \ncopies  of  the  resettlement  information  booklet  to  affected  households  and  village  offices  on  12 \nJune 2007, (ii) posting the draft RPs in village offices or resident committees on 12 June 2007, and \n(iii) posting English versions of the draft RPs on the ADB website following their endorsement by \nJPG  and  Environment  and  Social  Safeguard  Division  on  21  June  2007.  The  final  RPs  were \nuploaded on the ADB website on 8 October 2007. \n\n56. \nADB requires both internal and external resettlement monitoring and evaluation of the APs \nduring  implementation.  The  IAs  will  report  progress  regularly  to  the  PMO,  which  in  turn  will \nsummarize the land acquisition and resettlement progress in the semi-annual progress reports to \nADB. The PMO will retain the services of a domestic external monitor for this purpose. The monitor \nwill visit the subprojects every 6 months to (i) review resettlement progress and the general welfare \nof those affected, (ii) make recommendations to resolve any issues or problems, and (iii) provide \nadvice  to  IAs  and  local  officials.  The  monitor  will  pay  special  attention  to  vulnerable  groups, \nincluding women and the poor, to assess whether they have fully regained their standard of living. \nMonitoring  and  evaluation  reports  will  be  prepared  every  6  months  during  implementation,  and \nannually  for  2  years  after  the  completion  of  resettlement.  These  reports  will  be  submitted \nsimultaneously to ADB, PMO, and the IAs, and will be uploaded to the ADB website. \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Benefits \n\nPoverty and social analysis was undertaken in line with ADB guidelines to collect detailed \n57. \nsocial  information  to  inform  project  design  and  identify  poverty  reduction  and  social  development \nobjectives, outcomes, and indicators. In addition to the socioeconomic survey, public consultations \nwere  conducted  with  different  groups  of  stakeholders  including  consumer  groups,  business \ncommunities, government agencies, people affected by the Project, and civil society organizations. \nA  participatory  approach  was  adopted  for  project  design  and  will  continue  during  project \nimplementation. The poverty and social analysis identified vulnerable groups and opportunities for \npro-poor interventions, and recommended social action measures and participation and mitigation \nplans to achieve positive social benefits. The summary poverty reduction and social development \nstrategy is in Appendix 9. \n\n58. \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  an  urban  population  of  3.2  million  in  Changchun  and \n420,400  in  Yanji.  Of  the  total  direct  beneficiary  population,  about  240,000  or  5.54%  (7%  in \nChangchun and 3.85% in Yanji) are classified as poor based on the weighted average local urban \npoverty  line  of  CNY1,925  per  year.  The  Project  will  support  poverty  reduction  by  (i)  providing  a \nsafer  and  more  reliable  urban  water  supply;  (ii)  improving  the  natural  environment  through \nincreased  wastewater  treatment  and  better  SWM;  (iii)  reducing  morbidity  due  to  decreased \nexposure  to  waterborne  diseases;  (iv)  reducing  the  risk  of  respiratory  diseases  by  improving  the \ncentral  heating  system;  and  (v)  providing  employment  opportunities  for  the  poor.  The  Project  will \nimprove  public  health  by  reducing  waterborne  and  respiratory  diseases  through  improved  water \nsupply,  expanded  wastewater  and  SWM  capacity,  and  a  more  energy  efficient  central  heating \nsystem. The health impact analysis is in Supplementary Appendix G. Provision of clean water will \nimprove  the  quality  of  life  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable  by  reducing  the  proportion  of  household \nincome  spent  on  medical  treatment  for  waterborne  diseases.  The  number  of  school  days  and \nworkdays lost due to sickness will also be reduced. Further, the Project will reduce the proportion \nof household income spent on buying water from private  sources and buying storage containers, \nfilters, and other water purifying equipment. Water pressure improvements will greatly enhance the \nquality of life of households living in apartments and reduce their water pumping costs. The better \ncentral  heating  system  will  reduce  the  use  of  coal  by  40%,  and  this  will  have  positive  health \nimpacts, particularly on the poor.    \n\n59. \nThe  Project  will  create  3,880  full  time  jobs  during  construction,  generating  about  CNY48 \nmillion in wages per year. About 30% of the employment opportunities during the construction and \n\n\f17\n\noperation phases of the Project are expected to be filled by women. Project operations will create \n810  full-time  permanent  jobs.  Project-related  services,  such  as  procurement  of  construction \nmaterials and equipment, and follow-on multiplier effects will create an additional 5,000 jobs. In the \nproject area, the major social measures to protect urban residents from falling into poverty include \n(i) a living allowance for laid-off employees, (ii) unemployment insurance, and (iii) a social support \nprogram  under  the  minimum  living  standard  scheme.  Further,  CMG  and  YMG  have  agreed  to \nimplement poverty reduction35 measures including (i) lifeline tariffs, (ii) water bill discounts or cash \nrebates  amounting  to  50%  of  the  monthly  water  bill  for  households  living  below  the  poverty  line, \nand (iii) connections to tap water for the poorest households in Changchun and Yanji. The Project \nwill promote public awareness through education programs about project benefits, public hygiene, \nand consumer behavior on water saving and wastewater disposal. \n\nC. \n\nFinancial Aspects \n\n60. \nThe  financial  evaluation  of  the  Project  was  undertaken  in  real  terms  using  constant  2007 \nprices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to real \nterms  by  adjusting  for  the  projected  effects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation  and  currency \nfluctuation. Incremental benefits and costs were derived by evaluating the financial position of the \nIAs under with-project and without-project scenarios. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for \nthe  Project  was  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis  of  9.0%,  which  compares  favorably  with  the \nweighted average cost of capital in real terms of 3.52%. The financial analysis is in Appendix 10. \nThe  detailed  financial  analysis  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  I.  The  sensitivity  analysis  includes \nexamination of the risk that (i) project costs will increase by 10% (resulting in an FIRR of 7.93%), \n(ii)  O&M  costs  will  increase  by  10%  (resulting  in  an  FIRR  of  7.04%),  and  (iii)  revenues  will  be \nreduced due to delays in tariff adjustments (resulting in an FIRR of 5.74%). Detailed verification of \nthe  local  financing  plan  indicates  that  the  equity  contributions  are  about  1%  of  annual  revenues \nfrom  CMG  and  1.5%  from  YMG,  indicating  minimal  risk.  CMG  and  YMG  have  sufficient  financial \nresources  to  take  on  responsibility  for  guaranteeing  the  loan  repayments,  and  have  provided \nassurances  that  they  accept  this  risk.  An  affordability  analysis  has  been  undertaken  based  on \nproposed  tariffs  and  household  income  data  from  the  social  survey.  Tariffs  under the  Project are \nconsidered affordable if the combined average water and wastewater charges are less than 5% of \nmonthly  household  income.  The  estimated  tariffs  on  this  basis  are  affordable  to  the  average \nhousehold (2.0% of monthly income), and also affordable to the poorest 10% of households (less \nthan 3.4% of monthly income before accounting for poverty reduction measures that exist now or \nthat have been committed to).\n\n61. \nThe IAs agreed to minimum levels of financial performance, and these will be included as \nloan covenants covering capital structure (debt-equity), debt service cover, and liquidity. Financial \nprojections estimate the tariffs required for an appropriate level of financial performance. Periodic \ntariff reviews will be required to overcome the risk of poor financial performance or of unexpected \nchanges in tariff income. The financial sustainability of the Project was verified through the financial \nanalysis  of  the  IAs.  The  project  sustainability  assessment  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  H.  The \nfinancial  projections  for  the  IAs indicate  that  the  minimum  debt-service  coverage  ratios  and \nacceptable rates of return on equity will generally be achieved by the Project. To ensure that the \nProject  does  not  have  an  adverse  fiscal  impact  on  any  level  of  government,  retail  tariffs  were \nstructured on the basis of achieving full cost recovery.  \n\n                                                \n35 The technical assistance study (i) defined poverty  levels  used in the analysis, (ii) assessed and provided an income \nand  expenditure  profile  of  poor  households  based  on  a  household  survey  of  500  households,  (iii)  evaluated  and \nrecommended  measures  to  alleviate  the  impacts  of  increased  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  on  the  poor,  and  (iv) \nassessed the positive impacts of the Project on the poor and low-income beneficiaries.  \n\n\f18\n\nD. \n\nEconomic Aspects \n\n62. \nThe  Project  is  an  integral  part  of  the  ongoing  provincial,  municipal,  and  river  basin \nenvironmental  programs,  contributing  significantly  to  pollution  control  in  the  SRB  and  the \nBuerhatong  River.  Public  perceptions  and  preferences  were  also  evaluated  using  household  and \nbusiness surveys. The analysis demonstrates that water supply, wastewater management, SWM, \nand  efficient  central  heating  rank  highest  in  priority  when  compared  with  a  range  of  other  public \nservices.  A  quantitative  economic  analysis  also  demonstrates  the  value  of  the  Project.  The \neconomic analysis was conducted for 25 years including project construction, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Project benefits and costs were estimated \non  a  with-project  and  without-project  basis.  Costs  were  divided  into  tradable  and  nontradable \ncosts,  and  benefits  were  adjusted  to  account  for  non-incremental  and  incremental  benefits. \nIncremental  economic  benefits  were  valued  on  the  basis  of  willingness  to  pay.  The  economic \ninternal rate of return for the components ranges from 15.8% to 28.0%, and is 23.8% for the whole \nProject, which exceeds the economic opportunity cost of capital, assumed at 12%. The economic \nanalysis is in Appendix 11. The detailed economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix J. \n\nE. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\nThe Government has met the requirements of ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). Extensive \n63. \npublic  consultations  involving  meetings  with  stakeholders,  focus-group  discussions,  and  surveys \nwere  undertaken  twice  during  preparation  of  the  domestic  environmental  impact  assessments \n(EIAs).  The  EIAs  summarize  the  environmental  impacts,  mitigation  measures,  and  monitoring \nplans.  The  EMP,  prepared  as  part  of  the  EIA,  will  guide  environmental  mitigation  and  monitoring \nunder the Project. All the EIAs have been approved by the Jilin Provincial Environmental Protection \nBureau.  The  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  (SEIA)  and  the  EMP  have  been \nconfirmed by the Government. The SEIA concludes that the Project will have substantial positive \nenvironmental and socioeconomic benefits. The SEIA was circulated to the ADB Board and posted \non the ADB website on 18 May 2007. The overall findings of the SEIA and EIAs are that negative \nimpacts on air, water, and the acoustic environment are expected, especially during construction. \nIn  general  these  impacts  will  be  temporary  and  localized. The  proposed  mitigation  measures  are \ndescribed in the SEIA. These measures will be developed into a detailed EMP in the design and \nconstruction  phases.  The  EMPs  will  be  implemented  by  IAs,  monitored  and  supervised  by \nprofessional  environmental  management  specialists  or  companies  and  local  environmental \nmonitoring  centers,  and  reported  to  the  Jilin  PMO,  Jilin  Provincial  Environmental  Protection \nBureau, and ADB. \n\nBy  intercepting  direct  discharges  of  raw  sewage  into  the  Yitong  River  and  Xinlicheng \n64. \nReservoir and having them treated in the Dongnan WWTP, the subcomponent will improve (i) the \ndrinking water quality in the Xinlicheng Reservoir from class III to class II, and (ii) the water quality \nof the SRB by reducing pollution loads of 12,411 tons of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 547 \ntons  of  ammonia  nitrogen  annually.  The  Yanji  water  reuse  subcomponent  will  (i)  allow  the  Yanji \nWWTP to optimally utilize its capacity, (ii) reduce annual pollutant loads of 1,825 tons COD into the \nBuerhatong  River  (which  represents  a  50%  reduction  of  COD  discharge),  (iii)  conserve  50,000 \nm3/day  (or  18.25  million  m3  annually)  of  fresh  water  through  water  reuse.  The  heating \nsubcomponent  will  include  the  replacement  of  318  polluting  coal-based  boilers,  resulting  in  (i)  a \nmajor  air  quality  improvement  in  Yanji  from  class  III  to  class  II  in  the  winter  season,  (ii)  a  40% \nenergy saving due to replacement of small energy-inefficient boilers, (iii) a 3\u20135 times reduction of \nhot water leakage by upgrading the retrofitted existing heating network, which is estimated to save \nCNY20 million a year. \n\n\f19\n\nF. \n\nProject Risks and Mitigation Measures \n\n65. \nThe Project does not have any unusual technical risks. Conventional engineering designs \nwith  proven  records  of  reliable  performance  are  adopted  for  water  supply,  wastewater \nmanagement,  SWM,  and  central  heating  supply.  During  project  implementation,  the  consultants \nwill  support  the  PMO  and  IAs  to  ensure  delivered  equipment  and  works  comply  with  the  design \nrequirements  and  quality  standards.  The  following  risks  could  affect  timely  implementation, \neconomic viability, and reduce the available benefits of the Project: (i) amendments and changes \nto the Changchun and Yanji master plans; (ii) lack of proper O&M of project facilities; (iii) ineffective \norganizational  structures  and  inadequate  capacity  of  the  IAs,  which  could  result  in  inefficient \nproject  development  and  delays  in  implementation;  (iv)  delays  in  the  provision  of  counterpart \nfunding; (v) the failure of CMG and YMG to increase water, wastewater, solid-waste, and heating \ntariffs to meet cost recovery targets; and (vi) unforeseen land acquisition and resettlement issues, \nwhich  could  constrain  the  efficient  implementation  of  the  Project  works  and  restoration  of \nlivelihoods of the affected persons. \n\n66. \nRisk (i) will be mitigated by synchronizing the Project design and implementation schedules \nwith other projects planned in Jilin province, which have also provided specific assurances that are \ncovenanted  in  the  Loan  Agreement.  Risks  (ii)  and  (iii)  will  be  mitigated  through  the  provision  of \ninstitutional capacity development for the IAs with the support of consultants. Risks (iv) and (v) will \nbe mitigated through covenanted assurances from CMG and YMG on the provision of counterpart \nfunding  and  regular  tariff  review  and  increases.  Risk  (vi)  will  be  mitigated  by  strengthening  the \ninternal monitoring and supervision by the PMO, municipal PMOs, and the IAs, and by engaging a \nqualified  external  agency  to  monitor  and  evaluate  resettlement.  Several  other  measures  will  also \nhelp  mitigate  the  project  risks:  (i)  the  appointment  of  project  implementation  and  monitoring \nconsultants,  including  environmental  monitoring  consultants,  (ii)  EMP  monitoring  and  mitigation \narrangements,  (iii)  EMP  environmental  management  training,  and  (iv)  specific  assurances  from \nCMG  and  YMG  that  the  project  leading  group  and  PMO  are  retained  for  the  entire  loan \nimplementation period and beyond. \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n67. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government,  CMG,  JPG,  YMG  and  the  IAs \nhave  provided  the  following  assurances,  which  will  be  incorporated  into  the  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements. The full list of assurances is in the Loan and Project Agreement, and Supplementary \nAppendix K.  \n\n(i) \n\nJPG,  CMG,  and  YMG  will  also  undertake  the  following  anticorruption  actions:  (a) \ninvolve respective concerned agencies with oversight responsibility for each project \nimplementing  agency  (PIA)  in  bidding  and  construction  to  enhance  construction \nquality control and supervise effective work; (b) introduce a dual-signing system, in \nwhich  the  civil  works  contract  winner  signs  an  anticorruption  contract  with  the \nemployer  when  they  execute  the  civil  works  contract;  (c)  periodically  inspect  the \ncontractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  (d)  engage  the \nproject  management  consultant  to  support  the  Jilin  PMO  and  the  PIAs  to  ensure \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency  in  project  operations;  (e)  in \nconsultation  with  relevant  central  government  ministries  update  rules  and \nregulations  on  local  and  corporate  governance  and  anticorruption  and  enhance \ntransparency  of  the  PIA\u2019s  operations;  and  (f)  disclose  a  summary  of  the  financial \nstatements  and  Project  accounts,  schedules  of  proposed  tariff  increases  and \n\n\f20\n\n(ii) \n\nassociated  public  hearings;  and  tracking  of  procurement  contract  awards  on  the \nexisting Project website of CMG, and YMG.  \n\nThe JPG, CMG, and YMG will ensure that: (a) all land and rights-of-way required by \nthe Project are made available in a timely manner; (b) the resettlement plan will be \nimplemented  promptly  and  efficiently  in  accordance  with  their  terms;  and  the \nprovisions of the RP will be implemented in accordance with all applicable PRC laws \nand regulations, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995);

Jilin  province  faces  the  same  water  shortage  issue \n1.\nthat  is  common  among  all  northern  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  provinces.  As  the \nprovincial  capital,  Changchun  Municipality  relies  on  four  municipal  water  treatment  plants \n(WTPs) with a total capacity of 930,000 cubic meters per day (m3/day) to provide the urban area \nwith  adequate  water  for  domestic  and  industrial  use.  The  daily  water  demand  has  averaged \naround 980,000 m3/day and has been increasing for the past 4 years. Newly developed urban \nareas  in  Changchun  frequently  experience  low  water  pressure  due  to  the  increased  water \ndemand and insufficient local water supply capacity. In the central urban area, many residential \nareas still do not have 24-hour water supply. Yanji relies on the Baishi WTP to serve its urban \narea. Other self-supply facilities also exist in the city to extract groundwater for use by the urban \nresidents. The total water supply capacity is approximately 110,000 m3/day. The average water \ndemand in the city increased from 99,000 m3/day in 2001 to 109,800 m3/day in 2006. This sharp \nincrease  is  challenging  the  city\u2019s  limited  water  supply  capacity.  Many  households  are  not \ncovered by the existing distribution system or do not receive 24-hour water supply service due \nto  inadequate  water  supply  capacity.  Moreover,  aged  distribution  pipelines  in  Yanji  have \nresulted in large water losses through leakage.  \n\nGovernment Response. The activities required to be completed in the 11th Five Year \n2.\nProgram (FYP) to strengthen Changchun\u2019s water supply system include (i) the construction of \nthe No. 5 WTP and the  development of the proposal for the No. 6 WTP, (ii) renovation of the \nwater supply facilities within the urban area to ensure a 24-hour water supply, (iii) upgrading of \n455 kilometers (km) of water supply pipelines, and (iv) water supply capacity to reach 1,456,000 \nm3/day  by  2018.  The  activities  to  be  completed  to  strengthen  Yanji\u2019s  water  supply  system \ninclude (i) completion of the Yanji Reservoir project, (ii) upgrading of 37 km of water distribution \npipelines,  and  (iii)  preservation  of  natural  forests  in  the  upstream  regions  of  the  Wudao  and \nYanji reservoirs to safeguard drinking water sources.  \n\nProject  Response.  The  Changchun  No.5  WTP  and  distribution  mains  subcomponents \n3.\nwill increase the city\u2019s water supply capacity by 300,000 m3/day after its completion by the end \nof 2011. The Changchun Dongnan wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) subcomponent includes \nthe  construction  of  36  km  of  wastewater  interception  mains,  which  will  collect  wastewater  that \ncurrently flows into the drainage area impacting the Xinlicheng Reservoir. The Yanji WTP and \nnetwork  upgrading  subcomponent  will  increase  the  water  supply  capacity  in  Yanji  by  60,000 \nm3/day, and improve 36.5 km of the current water distribution system. \n\nB. \n\nWastewater Management \n\n4. \nCurrent Status of Wastewater Management. The volume of wastewater discharged in \nChangchun in 2005 was 218.324 million m3, and the wastewater treatment rate was 49%. There \nare  currently  four  WWTPs  in  Changchun:  (i)  the  Beijiao  WWTP  (primary  treatment  facility, \n390,000 m3/day); (ii) the Xijiao WWTP (150,000 m3/day); (iii) the No. 1 Automobile Manufactory \nWWTP  (25,000  m3/day);  and  (iv)  the  Shuangyang  WWTP  (25,000  m3/day).  As  of  2005,  the \nlength of the sewer network in Changchun was 2,169.2 km. The volume of domestic wastewater \ndischarged in Yanji was 67,000 m3/day in 2004 and 66,000 m3/day in 2005. The wastewater in \nYanji  was  discharged  directly  into  the  Buerhatong  River  before  the  Yanji  WWTP  started \noperations at the end of 2006. The Yanji WWTP (100,000 m3/day) is currently the only municipal \nWWTP in Yanji. The length of sewer network in Yanji was 166 km in 2004 and 177 km in 2005. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27\n\nUnderdevelopment  of  wastewater  facilities  in  both  Changchun  and  Yanji  leads  to  the \ndeterioration  of  water  quality  in  local  rivers,  poses  a  threat  to  public  health,  and  adversely \naffects  the  quality  of  life  in  Changchun  and  Yanji.  Water  quality  in  the  Yitong  and  Yongchun \nrivers  in  Changchun  does  not  meet  class  V  of  the  National  Water  Quality  Standard.  Water \nquality in the Yanji section of the Buerhatong River has deteriorated from class III to class IV. \n\nGovernment  Response.  The  Changchun  11th  FYP  aims  to  achieve  a  wastewater \n5.\ntreatment rate of 70% by 2010. The subsequent target is to achieve a wastewater treatment rate \nof 80% by 2012. The volume of wastewater discharged from the downtown area of Changchun \nis  projected  to  reach  1.407  million  m3/day  by  2010,  and  the  wastewater  treatment  rate  will  be \nincreased  to  80%.  Two  WWTPs  are  planned\u2014the  Dongnan  WWTP  and  the  South  WWTP\u2014\nwith  an  aggregate  capacity  of  250,000  m3/day  (Phase  I).  The  existing  Beijiao  WWTP  will  be \nupgraded to a secondary treatment plant and the capacity will be expanded to 390,000 m3/day.\nAbout  350  km  of  drainage  network  will  be  established  or  replaced.  The  capacity  of  the  Yanji \nWWTP will be expanded and this will improve the wastewater treatment rate to 95% set in the \n11th  FYP,  and  this  includes  installation  of  30  km  of  wastewater  collection  mains  along  the \nBuerhatong River bank and 82 km of wastewater collection network in the urban area. \n\nProject Response. The proposed WWTPs and effluent reuse subcomponents under the \n6.\nProject  will  contribute  to  (i)  a  significant  reduction  of  discharge  loads  into  the  Yitong  River  in \nChangchun and the Buerhatong River in Yanji by intercepting direct discharges of raw sewage, \n(ii) improvement of the water quality of the Yitong River and Xinlicheng Reservoir in Changchun \nand the Buerhatong River in Yanji, and (iii) improvement of sanitation and hygiene conditions in \nboth cities. \n\nC. \n\nDomestic Solid-Waste Management \n\nCurrent Status. The only existing sanitary landfill in Changchun has a design capacity \n7.\nof 2,500 tons per day. A medical waste disposal center was put into operation in 2006 to treat \nthe medical waste from the city. In addition, a night-soil treatment center with a capacity of 100 \ntons per day is under construction and will be put into operation in 2007 to treat the night-soils \ncollected  from  the  urban  area.  During  the  past  5  years,  the  Jilin  provincial  government  (JPG) \nhas accorded high priority to improving its solid-waste management facilities.   \n\nGovernment  and  Project  Response.  The  construction  of  the  Changchun  sanitary \n8.\nlandfill  is  a  major  undertaking  by  the  Government  and  is  designed  to  deal  with  the  growing \nproblems associated with domestic solid-waste disposal. The design capacity of 2,600 tons per \nday  accounts  for  about  18%  of  the  total  domestic  solid-waste  generated  in  Jilin  province,  and \nthis contributes significantly to the Government\u2019s domestic solid-waste sanitary disposal goals. \nThe project subcomponent includes (i) a 2,600 tons per day sanitary landfill with 10-year service \nlife (a total of 22 years after expansion in the future) with related retention walls, a 300 m3/day \nleachate treatment plant, a landfill gas collection and emission control system, 1.6 km of roads \ninside the landfill, and associated machinery and equipment; (ii) one transfer station with 2,000 \ntons  per  day  capacity  and  associated  machinery  and  equipment;  and  (iii)  30  solid-waste \ntransport trucks.  \n\nD. \n\nCentral Heating \n\nStatus  of  Central  Heating  in  Yanji.  Jilin  province  has  a  relatively  long  winter  and \n9. \naccordingly needs heating for 170 days per year. The existing central heating plant in Yanji is \nsupplying heat to the city\u2019s downtown area. The plant services an area of only 2 million square \n\n\f28\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nmeters  (m2)  (15%  of  the  city)  due  to  its  limited  capacity  and  incomplete  heating  distribution \nnetwork coverage. It is inefficient because (i) the retrofitted distribution system that it uses does \nnot allow efficient hot water delivery, and (ii) the plant is an older single purpose design that fails \nto  achieve  the  efficiencies  possible  with  newer  cogeneration  (heat  and  power)  plants.  The \nremaining  city  area  is  heated  by  approximately  318  small  inefficient  boilers,  resulting  in  total \nsuspended  particulates  in  the  urban  area  averaging  0.38  milligrams  per  cubic  meter  (mg/m3),\nmore  than  twice  the  state  environmental  standard  of  0.15  mg/m3.  Yanji  will  construct  a  new \ncogeneration plant1 which is expected to be completed by 2010, allowing complete coverage of \nthe  city  with  a  central  heating  service.  In  this  regard,  new  heating  distribution  networks  that \nconnect  the  existing  central  heating  plant  and  the  new  cogeneration  plant  with  the  rest  of  the \ncity  need  to  be  completed  to  effectively  utilize  the  city\u2019s  central  heating  supply  capacity.  The \nproposed Project will (i) complete the urgently needed central heating distribution networks for \nYanji, (ii) lead to the closure and replacement of the 318 polluting coal-based boilers,2 and (iii) \nresult  in  a  major  improvement  in  the  air  quality  of  Yanji,  which  will  contribute  significantly  to \npublic  health  in  Yanji  city.  Coal  is  the  predominant  energy  source  in  Yanji  and  it  accounts  for \n98%  of  all  consumed  fuel  (coal  consumption  is  1.1  million  tons  per  year).  Recent  air  quality \nmonitoring  indicates  that  the  air  quality  in  Yanji  could  be  characterized  as  class  III  in  winter. \nDuring winter air quality deteriorates significantly due to pollution from the inefficient coal-based \nboilers. The total suspended particulates in winter exceed the environmental standard, posing a \nthreat  to  public  health.  Incidents  of  acute  carbon  monoxide  poisoning  due  to  inefficient  coal \ncombustion at local sources have occasionally been registered.  \n\nProject Response. The Yanji central heating component has two subcomponents. The \n10.\nfirst  subcomponent  will  provide  central  heating  to  an  area  of  6.97  million  m2 south  of  the \nBuerhatong  River,  and  includes  42.52  km  of  heating  pipelines,  6.2  km  of  steam  pipelines,  35 \nheat-exchange  stations,  and  one  booster  pumping  station.  The  second  subcomponent  will \nprovide central heating to an area of 9.3 million m2 north of the Buerhatong River, and includes \n77.6 km of heating pipelines and 64 heat-exchange stations.  \n\n                                                \n1  The  project  proposal  for  the  cogeneration  plant  was  approved  by  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission  in  1995.  In  2003,  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  confirmed  that  the  1995 \napproval was still valid. This cogeneration plant is outside the scope of the proposed Project and is being financed \ndomestically.  \n\n2  Originally there were 700 coal-based boilers. To date, the Yanji municipal government has closed 382 boilers and \n\nthe remaining 318 boilers will be closed during the implementation of the proposed Project.  \n\n\fEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n\nName

The  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation  is  designed  to  ensure  that  the  affected  persons  (APs)  will  be  better  off  (or  at \nleast  no  worse  off)  as  a  result  of  the  Project.  Overall,  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nimpacts of the Project will be significant. A total of two full resettlement plans (RPs), three short \nRPs, and two short RPs with due-diligence reports have been prepared. \n\n2. \nThe  impacts  of  the  Project  are  summarized  in  Table  A8.1.  In  total,  about  128  hectares \n(ha) of land will be permanently acquired by the Project, of which 67% is classified as farmland. \nPermanent  land  acquisition  will  affect  102  households  (367  persons).  The  Project  will  also \nrequire  the  temporary  acquisition  of  210  ha  of  land,  of  which  41%  is  farmland,  and  affect  377 \nhouseholds  (1,388  persons).  A  total  of  232  households  (719  persons)  will  be  relocated  and \nabout 32,392 square meters (m2) of residential houses will be demolished. Nine enterprises and \nshops with a total of 49 employees will be affected and 4,297 m2 of nonresidential structures will \nIn  addition,  some  productive  assets,  ground  attachments,  and  public \nbe  dismantled. \ninfrastructure and facilities will be affected, including electric poles, toilets, fences, hand-pumped \nwells,  doors,  pig  pens,  platform,  toilets,  barns,  greenhouses,  cement  and  asphalt  roads,  and \ntrees.  Of  the  total  affected  population,  711  households  (2,491  persons)  affected  are  rural \nresidents, and 32 persons urban residents, owners of structures with or without certificates, and \nprivate business owners. Of the total APs, 22 households (51 persons) are Korean living in Yanji \ncity.\n\nIn  order  to  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  there  was  close \n3. \nconsultation with the local officials and village and street committees during the preliminary and \nfinal feasibility study stages.\n\nis  based  on \n\nCompensation for the permanent land loss is based on the Land Administration Law of \n4. \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) (1998) and the State Council Decision to Deepen Reform and \nStrictly  Enforce  Land  Administration  (Document  28,  dated  November  2004).  The  house \ndemolition \nthe  Provincial  and  Municipal  Urban  Housing  Demolishment \nAdministration  Regulations.  The  RPs  prepared  comply  with  PRC  laws  and  regulation  of \nresettlement and the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995).\nBased  on  consultations  with  local  governments  and  those  affected,  and  general  practice  in \nChangchun and Yanji cities, a set of compensation standards was adopted by the respective city \nproject  management  offices  (PMOs)  and  implementing  agencies  (IAs).  The  resettlement \nprinciples  established  for  the  Project  are  that  (i)  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement \nshould be avoided or minimized where feasible by developing and comparing a series of design \nalternatives;  (ii)  compensation  and  entitlements  provided  are  based  on  market  value  or \nreplacement  value  and  must  be  adequate  to  allow  those  affected  to  at  least  maintain  their \npreproject  standard  of  living,  with  the  prospect  of  improvement;  (iii)  land  temporarily  occupied \nand the period for disruption are to be kept to a minimum; (iv) all the people affected (legal and \nillegal) are to be taken into consideration and accounted for; (v) the per capita landholding after \nland  acquisition  will  be  sufficient  to  maintain  the  previous  livelihood  standard;  (vi)  where  land \nallocation per capita is not sufficient to maintain the previous livelihood standards, other income-\ngenerating activities will be provided for; (vii) a preferential policy will be provided to vulnerable \ngroups in such things as compensation, payment of special fund, minimum living guarantee, and \nemployment;  (viii)  all  those  affected  will  be  adequately  informed  about  eligibility,  compensation \nrates and standards, livelihood and income restoration plans, and project timing; and (ix) close \nmonitoring and timely actions will be carried out to identify and resolve any problems.  \n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 8 \n\nIn  accordance  with  the PRC  national,  provincial,  and  municipal  policies  and  regulations \n5. \nfor  land  acquisition,  house  demolition,  and  resettlement,  together  with  ADB  policies  and \nguidelines, the PMO and IAs have conducted public consultations, negotiation, and information \ndisclosure  sessions  with  the  APs,  villages,  and  county  governments  during  the  project \npreparation  stage.  During  meetings,  interviews,  focus-group  discussions,  public  consultation \nworkshops, and community consultation meetings, local representatives have participated in the \nplanning  and  concerns  have  been  integrated  into  the  RPs.  The  draft  RPs  were  distributed  or \ndisclosed to the affected counties, townships, villages, and affected persons on 12 June 2007, \nand resettlement information booklets have been disseminated to all the APs. This booklet has \nconfirmed (i) the project-affected areas, (ii) the implementation schedule and framework, (iii) the \ncompensation standards for land acquisition and other assets, (iv) relocation assistance, (v) the \nlivelihood  rehabilitation strategy,  and  (vi)  dispute  resolution  procedures.  JPG,  CMG,  YMG,  and \nthe IAs have implemented ADB\u2019s Public Communication Policy, which requires full disclosure for \nthe  resettlement  activities  by  (i)  distributing  copies  of  the  resettlement  information  booklet  to \naffected  households  and  village  offices  on  12  June  2007,  (ii)  posting  the  draft  RPs  in  village \noffices  or  resident  committees  on  12  June  2007,  and  (iii)  posting  English  versions  of  the  draft \nRPs  on  the  ADB  website  following  their  endorsement  by  JPG  and  Environment  and  Social \nSafeguard  Division  on  21  June  2007.  The  final  RPs  were  uploaded  on  the  ADB  website  on  8 \nOctober 2007. The respective project IAs will establish project resettlement units for supervising \nimplementation,  continuing  public  consultation,  monitoring  progress,  and  responding \nto \ngrievances.  The  grievance  redress  procedures  are  well  established  and  explanations  will  be \nincluded in the resettlement information booklets.  \n\n6. \nFor land acquisition, land compensation will be paid in cash to the affected villages to be \nused  as  basic  social  insurance  for  the  farmers  whose  land  is  newly  acquired;  resettlement \nsubsidies and standing crops will be paid to the APs. For residential houses and nonresidential \n(enterprises  and  shops)  structures  to  be  demolished,  compensation  will  be  paid  to  owners, \nincluding  those  without  certificates.  The  payment  will  be  made  in  cash  according  to  the \nappraised  value  of  the  property.  The  households  that  have  to  relocate  will  also  receive  a \nrelocation allowance. Compensation for standing crops, auxiliaries, and other assets will also be \npaid  directly  to  the  APs.  Income  losses  resulting  from  reduced  production  or  sales  and  wages \ncaused by the Project will be compensated for in cash. \n\n7. \nThe  resettlement  strategy  encompasses  (i)  the  replacement  of  housing,  and  (ii)  the \nrestoration  of  livelihoods  and  income.  For  people  losing  housing  in  rural  areas,  there  are  two \nresettlement options: (i) to receive cash compensation, or (ii) to receive cash compensation plus \nprovision  of  a  house  plot  for  house  construction  by  the  APs  themselves.  Assistance  will  be \nprovided to construct new houses or find available housing close to their original homes, if that is \ntheir  preference.  The  respective  municipal  PMOs,  IAs,  and  local  governments  will  provide \nnecessary assistance for house construction and relocation during resettlement implementation. \n\nThe  measures \n\nfor  economic  rehabilitation \n\n8. \ninclude  (i)  provision  of  employment \nopportunities during the project construction and operational phases, (ii) provision of basic social \ninsurance  to  the  APs  whose  land  is  acquired,  (iii)  development  of  crops  with  higher  economic \nvalue,  (iv)  promotion  and  development  of  new  enterprises  and  self-employed  secondary  and \ntertiary businesses (such as auto accessory manufacturing, community services, transportation, \nentertainment,  and  catering  services),  and  (v)  provision  of  technical  training  to  the  APs  to \nincrease  their  skills.  Relocated  enterprises  and  shops  will  be  provided  with  the  options  of \ncompensation and resettlement. The same shops will reemploy the affected employees. \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n45 \n\nBased on the survey results, seven vulnerable people (including four disabled, one elder \n9. \nand two poor persons) are affected due to the construction of Changchun Domestic Solid Waste \nManagement. For the vulnerable people, the respective municipal PMOs and IAs will establish a \nspecial fund at CNY2,000 per person for them to improve their living standards. The fund will be \npaid  as  a  one-time  cash  payment.  In  addition,  the  vulnerable  households  will  receive  CNY140 \nper month as a municipal living guarantee from the municipal civil affairs bureau. The PMO and \nIA  will  supervise  implementation  to  ensure  these  vulnerable  persons  receive  adequate \ncompensation,  housing  arrangements,  special  funds,  and  municipal  living  guarantee,  and \nassistance to restore their living conditions and incomes. \n\n10. \nEach PMO will have at least two full-time staff responsible for land acquisition, and each \nIA  will  have  at  least  two  full-time  staff  responsible  for  resettlement.  The  staff  from  each \nsubproject  resettlement  unit  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  the  planning,  implementation, \nfinancing,  and  monitoring  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  They  will  work  closely  with \nrelevant village officials, land administration bureaus, and house demolishment offices, and will \nbe  responsible  for  supervision  and  monitoring  of  resettlement  (including  the  delivery  of \nentitlements,  selection  of  new  housing  sites,  restoration  of  incomes,  provision  of  replacement \nland, and other economic measures). A training program will be organized for the resettlement \nofficers.\n\nThe  cost  estimate  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  $45.6  million,  equivalent  to \n11. \nCNY355.59 million in 2007 prices, including contingencies. Resettlement implementation will be \nscheduled  to  precede  the  subproject  construction  schedules.  Most  resettlement  activities  will \noccur  between  February  2008  and  December  2009.  Resettlement  implementation  will  be \ncompleted prior to subproject construction. Detailed measurement surveys will be conducted in \neach  village,  neighborhood,  and  enterprise  and  shop,  and  the  compensation  contracts  will  be \nnegotiated  and  signed  with  village  committees,  households,  and  enterprises.  Based  on  these \nsurveys, the resettlement plans will be updated and submitted to ADB for review and approval. \n\n12. \nInternal  and  external  monitoring  of  RP  implementation  will  be  conducted.  Monitoring \nmethodologies are specified in the RPs. Internal supervision and monitoring will be done by each \nIA to ensure compliance with the provisions of the RP. The PMO and IAs have agreed to a set of \nsupervision milestones with ADB to ensure timely and effective implementation of resettlement \nactivities  (see  Table  A8.2).  External  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  carried  out  by  an \nindependent  agency  under  contract  to  the  PMO  and  IAs.  External  monitoring  reports  will  be \nforwarded directly to both the PMO and ADB. \n\nTable A8.1: Resettlement Supervision Milestone \n\nResettlement Tasks \n\nTarget \n\nResponsible Agency \n\nDeadline \n\nStatus \n\nNo. \nA. \n\n1.\n\nDisclosure \nInformation booklet \n\n2.

POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nA. \nIs the sector identified as a national priority \nin country poverty analysis?   \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\nIs the sector identified as a national priority \nin country poverty partnership agreement?   \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \n\nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  an  urban  population  of  3.2  million  in  Changchun  and  420,400  in  Yanji.  Of  the  total  direct \nbeneficiary population, about 240,000 or 5.54% (7% in Changchun and 3.85% in Yanji) are classified as poor, based on the \nweighted  average  local  urban  poverty  line  of  CNY1,925  per  year.  The  Project  will  benefit  the  urban  residents  through  (i) \nimprovements to water supply infrastructure, (ii) the disposal of wastewater, (iii) better solid-waste management facilities, and\n(iv)  an  improved  energy  efficient  central  heating  system.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  through  increased \nquality  of  life  by  reducing  the  incidence  of  waterborne  and  airborne  diseases,  and  providing  employment  opportunities \nduring construction and operation of the project facilities, with anticipated effects on economic development. \n\nThe  Project  will  assist  with  the  country\u2019s  progress  in  meeting  Millennium  Development  Goal  7,  target  10  to  halve  the \nproportion  of  people  without  access  to  basic  sanitation  by  increasing  coverage  of  the  Changchun  and  Yanji  wastewater \nsystem by 2015. It will contribute to reductions in medical costs incurred as a result of contracting waterborne and airborne \ndiseases  in  Changchun  and  Yanji.  Health  benefits  are  expected  to  be  disproportionately  realized  by  women  as  they  are \nmore  vulnerable  to  waterborne  diseases  due  to  greater  contact  with  water  from  household  responsibilities  (especially \ncooking  and  washing),  and  are  most  responsible  for  care  of  the  young  and  old.  The  annual  health  benefit  to  be  gained \ndirectly from the urban environmental improvement in both Changchun and Yanji is estimated at CNY189 million.  \n\nB. \n\n Poverty Analysis                                                Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention\n\nA  poverty  and  social  analysis  was  undertaken  in  line  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  guidelines  to  collect  detailed \nsocial  information  necessary  to  inform  project  design,  and  identify  poverty  reduction  and  social  development  objectives, \noutcomes,  and  indicators.  The  analysis  identifies  vulnerable  groups  and  opportunities  for  pro-poor  interventions,  and \nrecommends  social  action  measures,  participation,  and  mitigation  plans  to  achieve  positive  social  benefits.  The \ncharacteristics of low-income or vulnerable households in the project area are (i) where the head of the household is a long-\nterm, laid-off former state-owned-enterprise worker, often with children of school age; (ii) households headed by women; (iii) \nhouseholds containing one or more disabled or chronically sick person; and (iv) members are part of the floating population, \nusually from rural areas and living in poor conditions. \n\nThe  major  social  measures  to  protect  urban  residents  from  falling  into  poverty  include  (i)  a  living  allowance  for  laid-off \nemployees,  (ii)  unemployment  insurance,  and  (iii)  a  social  support  program  under  the  minimum  living  standard  scheme. \nFurther,  the  Changchun  municipal  government  (CMG)  and  Yanji  municipal  government  (YMG)  have  agreed  to  implement \npoverty  reduction1  measures  including  (i)  lifeline  tariffs,  (ii)  water  bill  discounts  or  cash  rebates  amounting  to  50%  of  the \nmonthly water bill for households living below the poverty line, and (iii) connections for the poorest households to tap water in \nChangchun  and  Yanji.  The  Project  will  promote  public  awareness  and  education  programs  about  project  benefits,  public \nhygiene, and consumer behavior on water saving and managing wastewater disposal. \n\nThe  Project  will  support  poverty  reduction  by  (i)  providing  safer  and  more  reliable  urban  water  supply,  (ii)  improving  the \nnatural environment by increased wastewater treatment and improved solid-waste management, (iii) reducing morbidity due \nto  decreased  exposure  to  waterborne  diseases,  (iv)  reducing  the  risk  of  contracting  respiratory  diseases  by  improving  the \ncentral heating system, and (v) providing employment opportunities for the poor. The Project will create 3,880 full time jobs \nduring  construction,  generating  about  CNY48  million  in  wages  per  year.  The  poor  and  women  will  fill  half  of  these  jobs. \nProject  operations  will create 810 full-time  permanent jobs directly, generating about  CNY11.56 million  in  wages  per  year. \nProject-related services, such as procurement of construction materials and equipment, and follow-on multiplier effects will \ncreate an additional 5,000 jobs. \n\nC.  Participation Process\nIs there a stakeholder analysis?\n\n  Yes             \n\n   No\n\nStakeholder analysis has been conducted during the poverty and social assessment. The primary stakeholders of the Project \narea  are  urban  residents,  the  floating  population,  affected  persons,  industries  and  businesses,  the  executing  agency  (EA) \n\n                                                \n1 The technical assistance study (i) defined poverty levels used in the analysis, (ii) assessed and provided an income and \nexpenditure profile of poor households based on a household survey of 500 households, (iii) evaluated and recommended \nmeasures  to  alleviate  the  impacts  of  increased  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  on  the  poor,  and  (iv)  assessed  the  positive \nimpacts of the Project on the poor and low-income beneficiaries.  \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n51 \n\nand implementing agencies (IAs); secondary stakeholders of the Project include relevant government agencies, such as the \nCivil  Affairs  Bureau,  Poverty  Reduction  Office,  Health  Bureau,  and  All  Women\u2019s  Federations.  During  the  Project  design,  a \nhousehold  survey  of  1,500  households  was  conducted.  The  participatory  approaches  for  the  poverty  and  social  impact \nassessment included stakeholder consultation workshops, focus-group discussions, and key informant interviews, and these \nwere used to gain a better understanding of the demands, needs, and interests of the stakeholders.  \n\nThree rounds of public consultations in the project areas were carried out to prepare the environmental impact assessment \n(EIA)  and  the  resettlement  plans.  The  public  consultations  and  information  disclosure  included  (i)  introducing  the  Project \ncomponents  to  the  stakeholders;  (ii)  soliciting  ideas,  suggestions,  comments,  concerns,  and  critiques  on  the  potential \nenvironmental  implications  of  the  Project;  and  (iii)  presenting  the  findings  of  the  EIA  and  resettlement  plans,  summarizing \npotential  environmental  impacts  and  mitigation  measures,  and  providing  answers  raised  by  workshop  participants.  Public \nconsultations  and  information  disclosure  of  resettlement  plans  were  conducted  during  surveys,  community  meetings, \ninterviews, and workshops. The results of these meetings and the concerns of the affected persons, particularly the poor and \nwomen, were integrated into the resettlement plans, which also describe the public consultation plan and grievance process. \n\nIs there a participation strategy?\n\n   Yes              \n\n   No \n\nPublic consultation and participation have been the core element of the project design and  will continue during the project \nimplementation,  monitoring,  and  evaluation.  Ongoing  consultations  will  also  be  carried  out  by  the  IAs  to  understand  and \nmeet  the  evolving  needs  and  expectations  of  the  users  as  well  as  increase  the  awareness  of  the  public,  especially  the \nbeneficiaries, about the benefits of the Project, and encourage the active involvement of local communities to maximize their \nsupport  to  the  Project,  promote  environmental  protection,  and  raise  the  social  acceptance  of  tariff  increases.  Public \nconsultations  will  be  held  during  the  project  implementation  to  discuss  and  obtain  feedback  on  tariff  adjustments  and \naffordability for consumers and other key stakeholders, particularly the poor. Existing participatory policies that rely on public\nhearings to gain approval for tariff adjustments will provide the mechanism for these consultations. The public consultation \nand  participation  will  be  carried  out  throughout  the  whole  process  of  the  EIA  and  environmental  management  plan \nimplementation. The consultations, including a grievance mechanism, will continue during land acquisition and resettlement \nso  that  the  problems  and  needs  of  affected  persons  are  properly  addressed  in  a  timely  manner  before  the  project \nimplementation. \n\nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n\nResults from the household surveys and focus-group discussions indicate that women are primarily responsible for collection \nof  household  water,  wastewater  disposal  and  management,  household  garbage  disposal  and  management,  heating \nprovision,  and  care  for  the  sick  and  elders.  Time  and  efforts  spent  on  these  activities  will  reduce  the  time  available  for \nwomen  to  engage  in  income-generating  activities,  family  entertainment,  or  leisure.  The  poverty  and  social  assessment \nindicated  that  women  strongly  support  the  Project.  Women  have  perceived  that  the  Project  will  improve  the  urban  living \nenvironment, create employment opportunities, and reduce the incidence of waterborne and airborne diseases. To maximize \nthe  project  benefits,  women  will  be  given  priority  in  the  employment  and  training  opportunities  generated  from  the  project \nconstruction and operation phases. A proactive employment program for women will be adopted by the IAs. Over 20% of the \nemployment opportunities will be filled by women during the project construction phase and 20% during the operation phase. \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nE.

The closure of 318 small boilers will affect \nabout  452  workers.  Reemployment  plans  have  been \nprepared by the project implementing agencies (PIAs) to \nensure that all the affected workers will be reassigned to \nother similar jobs or retrained for other jobs. The affected \nworkers will not be financially worse off than they would \nhave  been  in  the  absence  of  the  Project.  The  Jilin \nprovincial government (JPG) will ensure that no job and \nincome losses occur. \n\nThere  is  a  large  Korean  ethnic  group  (60%  of  the  Yanji \npopulation)  in  Yanji.  Koreans  are  the  dominant  cultural \nand economic group in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous \nPrefecture. Koreans migrated to the area 200\u2013300 years \nago  from  the  Democratic  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Korea \nand  have  thrived  there  ever  since,  maintaining  their \nculture and language. The Korean language is common \nin  the  workplace,  including  local  government  offices. \nKorean is taught in schools and Korean newspapers are \nwidely available. The Korean community maintains close \neconomic  ties  with  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and  officials \nwith  the  Civil  Affairs  Bureau  consider  the  Korean \ncommunity to be somewhat better off economically than \nother  groups.  In  Changchun,  96.5%  of  the  targeted \npopulation  belongs  to  the  Han  ethnic  group  while  other \nethnic  groups  have  similar  customs  and  economic \nactivities.  The  minority  people  will  benefit  from  the \nincreased  and  improved  urban  infrastructure  facilities \nand services. \n\nProject land acquisition and resettlement has affected, or \nwill affect, 22 Korean households (51 persons). However, \nthey  are  much  better  off  than  their  income  could  have \nseveral times increase as they have used or will use the \ncompensation  payment  from  land  acquisition  to  make \narrangements  to  get  employment  in  Korea  or  invest  in \nsmall  businesses.  As  a  result,  there  are  no  negative \nland  acquisition  and \nimpacts  on \nimpact  on  minority \nresettlement. \npopulations \nProject \nimplementation,  special  policies  and  considerations  will \nbe  provided  to  them  in  line  with  the  Chinese  policies  on \nminority people and the ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies. \n\nthem  due \nIf  any  negative \nidentified \nis \n\nduring \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities\n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\nHealth  and  safety  training  will  be  provided  to  the \nconstruction  workers.  The  Project  Management  Office \nwill  ensure  that  contractors  involved  in  the  project \nimplementation  receive  and  disseminate  information  on \nhealth  and  safety  issues.  Employees  involved  in  the \nProject  will  be  protected  in  accordance  with  PRC  labor \nlaws  and  other  regulations  and  guidelines  issued  by \nCMG and YMG. \n\n Yes \n\n  No\n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n53 \n\nA.   \n\nIntroduction \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nThe financial analysis was prepared in accordance with the Financial Management and \n1. \nAnalysis  of  Projects  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).1  An  assessment  of  financial \nperformance  was  completed  for  the  implementing  agencies  (IAs)  that  operate  as  enterprises. \nThe  financial  analysis  of  the  Project  is  completed  for  those  IAs  that  will  operate  revenue-\ngenerating  project  components.  The  analysis  determines  the  level  of  cost  recovery  that  is \nrequired to service the ADB loan and achieve financial health. \n\n2. \nThe  financial  evaluations  of  project  components  were  carried  out  in  real  terms  using \n2007  prices.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  was  determined  using  incremental \nannual  cash  flows  over  25  years  of  operations.  The  residual  value  of  physical  assets  is \nassumed to equal its remaining book or depreciated value at the end of the evaluation period. \nThe  evaluation  was  carried  out  for  the  project  components  and  the  combination  of  project \ncomponents  that  feature  cost  recovery  through  tariffs.  All  cost  and  revenue  projections  were \nprepared using a pro forma financial modeling approach. \n\nB.   \n\nHistorical Tariffs In Changchun and Yanji \n\n3. \nAn  effective  tariff  mechanism  is  needed  to  ensure  sufficient  contributions  from \nbeneficiaries  to  support  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  and  to  finance  overhead  costs \nincluding debt servicing. In addition, it is necessary to ensure adequate and timely provision of \ncounterpart  funds  during  project  implementation.  In  accordance  with  the  central  government\u2019s \npolicies, all local governments are expected to charge reasonable fees for sewage treatment. In \nprinciple,  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  should  be  established  based  on  the  cost  of  operating \nfacilities  and  the  affordability  by  consumers.  In  cities  where  profitability  is  not  possible,  local \ngovernments are encouraged to set a minimum wastewater tariff that can cover O&M costs.  \n\nWater and Wastewater Tariff in Changchun.

Manila. \n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nChangchun municipal government (CMG) introduced a new tariff system on urban solid-waste \ncollection  on  26  September  2005.  According  to  the  new  system,  each  urban  household  is \ncharged CNY7 per month and public establishments is charged CNY44 per ton for solid-waste \ndisposal. The new tariff system was effective on 1 October 2005. \n\nWater  and  Wastewater  Tariff  in  Yanji.  A  wastewater  tariff,  approved  by  the  Jilin \n6.\nprovincial government (JPG), was introduced in Yanji in 2000. The Yanji municipal government \n(YMG)  increased  the  wastewater  tariff  in  2003  and  2006  after  holding  public  meetings  and \nreceiving required approvals. The current wastewater tariff is CNY0.40 per cubic meter (m3) for \ndomestic users, CNY 0.80 per m3 for public institutions and industries, and CNY1.60 per m3 for \nspecial  industries  (Table  A10.2).

The  heating  tariff  in  Yanji  increased  from  CNY22  per  square \n7.\nmeter (m2) to CNY26 per m2 for residential apartments, CNY30 per m2 for schools, and CNY35 \nper m2 for commercial premises, industries, and public institutions on 1 October 2005.  \n\nC.   \n\nMajor Assumptions   \n\n8. \nA  value-added  tax  rate  of  6%  is  applied  to  the  sales  revenue;  sales  taxes  and \nsurcharges of a total of 10% on top of the value-added tax are also levied. An income tax rate of \n25%  is  used  in  the  financial  analysis  for  all  the  subprojects,  except  the  ones  with  solid-waste \nand wastewater management components, for which an income tax rate of 15% is used. \n\n9. \nAnnual average depreciation costs have been computed at 4.17% of the book value of \nfixed assets at the end of the implementation period for each subproject until the net book value \nof fixed assets becomes zero after 24 years of operation. An amortization rate of 8% is applied \nto the original book value of the total intangible assets and deferred assts. The depreciation and \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n55 \n\namortization costs are calculated based on the items\u2019 book values in nominal terms at the end \nof  the  implementation  period  in  accordance  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China\u2019s  (PRC) \naccounting  standards.  Costs  of  consumables,  electricity,  and  other  expenses  are  adjusted \nannually  according  to  the  proposed  capacity-utilization  rate.  All  O&M  costs  are  calculated  in \nnominal terms in financial statement projections, adjusted by the local inflation rates projected \nby ADB. The O&M costs are calculated in real terms in the discounted cash flow analyses.  \n\n10. \nIn  the  financial  statement  projections,  loans  to  be  obtained  from  ADB  and  local \ncommercial banks are included as debt. The balance of the total investment to be financed by \nthe  government  is  included  as  equity  injection.  The  proposed  ADB  loan  has  a  25-year  term, \nincluding a 5-year grace period. The interest rate will be based on the London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR) plus a spread. As of 17 May 2007, the 6-month LIBOR was 5.36%, and the 5-year \nfixed  swap  rate  was  5.11%.  By  adding  60  base  points  to  the  5-year  fixed  swap  rate,  the \nexpected  interest  rate  of  the  ADB  loan  will  be  5.71%.  The  commitment  fee  is  assumed  to  be \n0.35% and the front end fee is assumed to be waived.2 The cost of local bank loans is 7.20% \nand the opportunity cost of equity is assumed to be 8.00% in accordance with the government\u2019s \nguidelines  and  the  equity  cost  used  in  similar  ADB  projects  in  the  PRC.  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nFinancial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  specify  that  the  appropriate \ndiscount rate for discounted cash flow analyses is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), \nwhich  represents  the  cost  incurred  by  the  project  entity  in  raising  the  capital  to  implement  a \nproject. The WACC for the Project as a whole was calculated as 3.52% (Table A10.3). \n\nSource of Funds \n\nTable A10.3.

These returns \ncompare  favorably  to  the  WACC  of  3.52%.  The  sensitivity  analysis  tests  the  following  three \nscenarios: (i) project costs increase by 10%, (ii) O&M costs increase by 10%, and (iii) revenue \nreduces by 10% due to delay of tariff adjustments. The resulting financial internal rates of return \nfor  the  three  scenarios  are  7.93%  for  scenario  (i),  7.04%  for  scenario  (ii),  and  5.74%  for \nscenario  (iii).  The  sensitivity  analysis  suggests  that  tariff  reform  and  improved  financial \nmanagement,  particularly  cost  control,  are  the  most  important  factors  to  assure  a  successful \nproject  outcome.  JPG,  CMG,  and  YMG  have  confirmed  that  the  government  plans  to \nprogressively  increase  water  and  wastewater  tariffs,  introduce  a  solid-waste  tariff,  and \nstrengthen tariff collections in both project cities. Suitable assurances from the government are \nincluded in the loan document to ensure tariff reforms in the project cities. \n\n                                                \n2  Based on 1% waiver of the entire front-end fee on all new sovereign loans approved by the ADB Board of Directors \n\nfrom 1 July 2007 up to and including 30 June 2008. \n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 11\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nThe  economic  analysis  covers  project  justification,  general  parameters  for  economic \n1. \nanalysis,  project  costs  and  benefits,  least-cost  analysis,  and  calculations  of  the  economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR).  The  EIRR  is  calculated  for  each  of  the  Project\u2019s  seven \nsubcomponents (Table A11.1) and for the Project as a whole. \n\nTable A11.1: Served Districts and Primary Benefits of Project Subcomponents \n\nSubcomponent \n\nDistricts Served \n\nNature of Benefits \n\nA.

Meanwhile, shortages of safe drinking water are common. \nThe  central  government  has  classified  more  than  300  cities  as  \u201cwater  short,\u201d  108  as  having \nserious water problems, and more than 60 as being critically short of water. Changchun city is \nincluded in the list of cities that are  critically short of water.  Sustainable development requires \nthat  Jilin  province  strengthens  its  capacity  to  manage  its  utility  services  to  (i)  formulate \nintegrated urban plans, and (ii) monitor and enforce environmental regulations.  \n\nThe  Project  comprises  water  supply  and  wastewater  management  in  Changchun  and \n3. \nYanji,  domestic  solid-waste  management  in  Changchun,  and  central  heating  in  Yanji.  The \nProject  will  help \nlong-term  sustainable \ndevelopment  in  Changchun  and  Yanji  by  (i)  enhancing  the  quality  of  water  resources;  (ii) \nstrengthening  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  domestic  solid-waste  management;  and  (iii) \nimproving urban air quality. In the project design, alternative locations and specifications for the \n\nthe  urban  environment  and  achieve \n\nimprove \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n57 \n\nwastewater  treatment  plants,  sewer  networks, water  treatment  plants,  pumping  stations,  solid-\nwaste landfills, and central heating networks were considered. \n\nC.  \n\nGeneral Parameters \n\n4.  \nThe economic analysis was conducted by comparing situations with-project and without-\nproject. The study period covers 25 years including 5 years of construction from 2007 to 2011. \nEconomic  benefits  and  costs  are  denominated  in  domestic  price  numeraire  and  expressed  in \nconstant 2007 prices. Tradable components are converted to economic prices using a shadow \nexchange rate of 1.013, and nontradable components are valued at domestic market prices. A \nshadow  wage  rate  of  0.8  was  applied  to  the  wage  of  unskilled  labor  to  account  for \nunemployment and underemployment. \n\nD.  \n\nCosts \n\n5.  \nProject  costs  include  capital  investment  costs  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M) \ncosts.  Costs  were  allocated  to  tradable  and  nontradable  goods  and  services,  and  skilled  and \nunskilled labor. Appropriate conversion factors (shadow exchange rate and shadow wage rate) \nwere applied accordingly. Transfer payments, including taxes and interests, are excluded from \nthe economic costs, while physical contingencies are included.\n\nE. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n6. \nThe Project is expected to benefit 3.6 million urban residents (3.2 million in Changchun \nand  0.40  million  in  Yanji).  The  Project\u2019s  primary  benefits  will  include  (i)  improved  wastewater \ncollection and treatment services for about 300,000 people in Changchun and 26,300 people in \nYanji, (ii) provision of an alternative low-cost supply of water to industrial users in Yanji through \nthe reuse of treated wastewater effluent, (iii) reduced coal consumption and environmental costs \ndue  to  reduced  air  pollutant  emissions  in  Yanji,  (iv)  improved  water  supply  treatment  and \ndistribution services for about 1.2 million people in Changchun and 118,800 people in Yanji, (v) \nimproved  solid-waste  collection  and  treatment  in  Changchun,  and  (vi)  human  health  benefits \nsuch as reductions in morbidity and mortality due to airborne and waterborne diseases.  \n\n7.  \nBenefits associated with the improved water supply treatment and distribution services in \nChangchun  and  Yanji  include  (i)  the  provision  of  24-hour  service  in  the  areas  currently \nexperiencing  interrupted  service,  (ii)  increased  water  pressure  in  the  distribution  systems,  (iii) \nimproved  drinking  water  quality,  (iv)  reduced  risk  of  exposure  to  waterborne  pathogens  in  the \ntap water, and (v) reduced water leakage. Indirect benefits for domestic beneficiaries include the \nelimination  of  financial  costs  incurred  to  cope  with  the  interrupted  water  supply  service  and  a \ngeneral enhancement of the life quality.  \n\n8. \nThe  impacts  associated  with  the  improvements  in  wastewater  collection  and  treatment \ninclude  (i)  reduced  discharge  of  untreated  wastewater  into  the  river  streams,  (ii)  reduced \nfrequency of acute surface water contaminations, and (iii) reduced hydraulic loading of treated \nwastewater  effluent  to  the  receiving  streams.  Benefits  that  are  derived  from  these  impacts \ninclude (i) improved aquatic environment in local river systems, (ii) reduced risk of human and \nlivestock exposure to waterborne pathogens, (iii) reduced transboundary aquatic pollution, and \n(iv) improved drinking water supplies in Changchun and Yanji.  \n\n9. \nBenefits of the central heating component will result primarily from (i) more efficient heat \nproduction than using the existing small boilers and (ii) the reduction in environmental costs due \n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 11\n\nto reduced air pollution from the boilers. The proposed central heating systems will significantly \nimprove  the  air  quality  in  Yanji  during  winter  by  reducing  emissions  of  air  pollutants  and \ndispersing the remaining waste gas through tall chimneys. \n\nFor  solid-waste  management,  the  existing  landfill  of  Changchun  will  be  filled  in  18 \n10. \nmonths,  although  the  period  can  be  extended  somewhat  if  necessary.  Construction  of  a  new \ndomestic  solid-waste  treatment  facility  is  urgently  needed.  The  benefits  associated  with  the \nsolid-waste management component are primarily derived from the improved local environment \nand reduced pollution. \n\n11.   Benefits  of  all  the  project  components  are  calculated  using  a  willingness  to  pay \napproach. Estimation of the willingness to pay uses the contingent valuation method, which has \nbeen  widely  used  in  environmental  and  natural-resource  valuations.  The  contingent  valuation \nmethod  uses  survey  techniques  to  elicit  individuals\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  the  hypothetical \nprovision of a public good or willingness to accept compensation for a hypothetical loss. These \nmonetary values are then aggregated and used in cost-benefit analyses of public interventions \nthat potentially increase social welfare. A two-stage regression with a special treatment of zero \nresponses  in  the  survey  is  conducted.  The  regression  results  for  this  Project  indicate  that  the \nwillingness to pay for wastewater treatment is CNY0.85 per ton, for water supply CNY3.50 per \nton  (CNY2.50  per  ton  for  Yanji),  and  for  central  heating  CNY30  per  square  meter  (m2)  of \nbuilding area per heating season. \n\nF. \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis \n\nThe least-cost analysis uses two methods: (i) the lowest average incremental economic \n12. \ncost  approach  is  used  for  the  components  where  there  is  a  measurable  output,  such  as  the \nYanji Water Treatment Plant and Yanji Effluent Reuse Plant subcomponents; and (ii) the lowest \npresent  value  of  economic  cost  approach  is  used  for  the  subcomponents  of  water  supply  and \nsewer networks construction and upgrade, where a measurable output is unavailable. All costs \nand outputs are derived from a with-project and without-project comparison, and discounted at \nthe economic discount rate of 12%. The least cost conclusions are indicated below. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nFor  the  landfill  location,  the  Mogugou  option  is  found  to  be  cost  effective \ncompared to the Fufengshan option. \nFor  the  solid-waste  treatment  process,  the  landfill  process  is  found  to  be  better \nthan the fired mixed landfill process. \nFor the tertiary wastewater treatment, the filtration pitcher process is found to be \ncost effective compared to the filtration tank process. \nFor pipe materials, the least-cost analysis confirms the reinforced concrete pipe \nas a recommended option against the HDPE pipe. \nFor  the  water  transmission  pipeline  layout  routine,  the  preferred  option  is  the \npipeline from the Yanji River, compared to the pipeline from the Chaoyang River. \nFor  the  water  transmission  pipe  material,  the  cast-iron  pipe  is  marginally  better \nthan the PCCP pipe. \n\nG. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n13. \nThe EIRR is calculated for each Project subcomponent (Tables A11.2 to A11.5) and for \nthe  whole  Project  (Table  A11.6).  The  EIRR  ranges  from  15.8%  to  28.0%  for  subcomponents \nand 23.7% for the whole Project. Sensitivity analysis shows that the EIRR for the whole Project \nwill decrease to (i) 21.4% if the Project experiences a capital cost overrun of 10%, (ii) 20.5% if \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n59 \n\nthe  Project  experiences  an  O&M  cost  overrun  of  20%,  (iii)  19.1%  if  the  Project  benefits  are \nreduced  by  10%,  (iv)  21%  if  the  Project  experiences  a  commissioning  delay  of  1  year,  and \n(v) 13.6%  if  (i),  (ii),  and  (iii)  all  happen  together.  A  risk  analysis  based  on  1000  Monte  Carlo \nsimulations  shows  that  the  probability  of  the  EIRR  being  below  12%  is  less  than  5%.  The \nfinancial  analysis  (Appendix  10)  of  the  Project\u2019s  six  revenue-generating  subcomponents \nindicates that all of them will be financially viable and sustainable. The Government, through its \ngeneral  budget,  will  provide  subsidies  to  the  implementation  agencies  of  the  nonrevenue-\ngenerating subcomponents to cover their O&M costs.  \n\nTable A11.2:

\n\nDistribution Analysis and Poverty Impact Indicator \n\n14. \nAs a result of the Project, some stakeholders lose and others gain. At a discount rate of \n12%, the economy will gain CNY139.7 million, which is mainly from income taxes (Table A11.7). \nLaborers will gain CNY10.3 million because the Project pays wages in excess of the economic \nopportunity  cost  of  labor.  Consumers  will  gain  CNY3,233.5  million  because  they  can  avail \nthemselves  of  increased  quantities  of  water,  wastewater  treated,  and  heating  at  a  lower  cost \nthan without the Project. The share of net economic benefits of the Project accruing to the poor \nis 12.1%. Since the ratio is higher than the poverty ratio in the project area (estimated at 7.4%) \nthe  analysis  concludes  that  the  Project  will  support  pro-poor  economic  growth.
