THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will provide project preparation support, \nproject implementation support, capacity building, and policy advice to a series of ongoing and \nensuing projects in the agriculture, natural resources, and rural development (ANR) sector in the \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) in Southeast Asia in line with Strategy 2030 during 2018\u2013\n2023.1 The ANR sector plays a key role in ensuring inclusive economic growth in the region and \nhas high priority in the respective national development strategies.2 The TA facility approach will \nenhance efficiency in project preparation and administration by (i) reducing time and effort for TA \nprocessing, approval, and administration; and (ii) accelerating the consultant recruitment process \nby prequalifying consultants for all the project preparation and implementation support under the \nfacility. \n \n1.  Background \n \n2.  Remarkable economic growth and poverty reduction. The Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) region, comprising 10 Southeast Asian countries, is home to over 622 \nmillion people. It has the third largest labor force in the world, behind only the People\u2019s Republic \nof China and India. With an average annual economic growth of 5.3% during 2007\u20132015, ASEAN \nhas consistently outperformed global economic growth. ASEAN\u2019s combined gross domestic \nproducts in 2015 stood at $2.4 trillion (sixth largest economy in the world).3 The robust economic \nperformance enabled the region to reduce the proportion of populations below the respective \nnational poverty lines from 31% in 1990 to 14% in 2015.4 \n \n3.  Increasing rural-urban income disparity. Despite the remarkable poverty reduction, \nthere are still 36 million people in the region living below the international poverty line.5 The \neconomic growth driven by industrial and service sectors centered in urban areas has left the \nlarge population in rural areas outside the stream of viable economic opportunities. The widening \nrural-urban income disparity within countries has been recognized as a common symptom.6 To \nmake economic growth equitable, inclusive, and sustainable, investing in urban development is \nnot  sufficient.  Vitalizing  rural  economies  is  imperative  as  the  region  is  endowed  with  rich \nagricultural and natural resources, and with large populations engaged in agriculture. \n \n                                                \n1  The TA facility will initially provide project preparation support for three ensuing projects for Myanmar and Viet Nam, \nand project implementation support to ongoing projects such as the L3724-MYA and Grant 0617-MYA Climate-\nFriendly Agribusiness Value Chains Sector project. These projects are listed in Appendix 2. The ensuing projects \nand relevant TAs are in the Country Operations Business Plans of the respective DMCs. With additional funds \nincluding Technical Assistance Special Fund for 2019, more projects for additional DMCs in Southeast Asia will be \nadded under the TA facility. \n2  These strategies include Myanmar\u2019s Five-Year Development Plan 2016/2017-2020/2021 and Viet Nam\u2019s Five-Year \nSocio-Economic Development Plan (2016\u20132020). \n3  ASEAN. 2016.

Mordecai. 2017. \nWhat is the Future of Integration and Inequality in ASEAN? The Diplomat. 15 September. \n \n ", "2 \n2.  Sector Challenges \n4.  Low rural labor productivity. The increasing rural-urban income disparity is largely \nattributable to low rural labor productivity. The DMCs have substantial rural populations, whose \nshares in total populations vary from the lowest in Indonesia (46.3%) to the highest in Cambodia \n(79.3%). Rural labor opportunities in the region are largely in rice-dominant, small-scale, and low \nmechanized farming.7 A large portion of the rural workforce is engaged in subsistent agriculture \nand underemployed. It is crucial for the DMCs to generate productive economic opportunities for \nrural populations by diversifying the sector and building backward and forward linkages within the \nsector. \n \n5.  Increasing demand for a wide variety of safe food. Due to increased income and \nawareness for a safe and balanced diet, the people in the region demand a variety of high quality \nand more nutritious food products. Because food products are produced and transported by \nmultiple players in the food value chains, it is more difficult to trace causes of food adulteration \nand contamination. The extended food value chains and wide variety of food products have made \nlaw enforcement on food safety control a challenge. While food safety laws have become more \nstringent in the DMCs, their capacity to enforce food safety laws is still limited. \n \n6.  Underdeveloped agro-based value chains. To achieve inclusive growth in the region, \nthe ANR sector needs to become more competitive and generate productive off- and non-farm \njobs. Agro-based value chain development is the key to realize this. However, value chains of \nmost agriculture products in the DMCs are underdeveloped because of insufficient private sector \ninvestment caused by various constraints: (i) underdeveloped infrastructure; (ii) limited access to \nlong-term affordable finance for a great majority of business entities in the sector (i.e., micro-, \nsmall- and medium-sized enterprises and cooperatives); and (iii) sourcing raw materials from \nmany scattered small farmers. \n \n7.  Natural resources degradation and environmental pollution. The region is endowed \nwith rich natural resources, which are pivotal in sustaining a wide range of economic activities \nand livelihoods. However, natural resources intensive agricultural growth has caused immense \nnatural  resources  degradation  and  environmental  pollution.  Environmentally  unsustainable \nfarming practices, resource-intensive industrial agricultural production, poor management of \ncommercial plantations, and an increasing volume of agricultural products that require transport \nhave all contributed to the degradation of natural resources and environmental pollution. It is \nimportant to take a holistic approach to make the performance of agro-based value chains \nresource-efficient and green. \n \n8.  Climate change impacts. The region is highly vulnerable to climate change as a large \nproportion of population and economic activity is concentrated along coastlines and water bodies. \nThe region relies heavily on agriculture, the most climate vulnerable sector, for livelihood. \nAlthough the region\u2019s contribution to global greenhouse emissions is relatively low, Intended \nNationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change identifies the \nregion\u2019s  increasing  energy  use  in  agriculture,  industry,  and  transportation,  together  with \ndeforestation and land-use change as the main factors for the rise in greenhouse gas emissions.8 \nAn Asian Development Bank (ADB) study projected that the region may lose up to 11% of gross \ndomestic product by 2100 if no action is taken to address climate change.9 \n                                                \n7  Average agricultural land per capita ranges from 0.36 hectare in Cambodia as the largest and 0.12 hectare in Viet \nNam as the smallest. \n8  Synthesis of intended nationally determined contributions as communicated by Parties.

Growing hub of global agro-based value chains and regional integration. As one of \nthe fastest growing regions in the world characterized with rich agricultural resources, the region \nhas had some success in integrating into the global agro-based value chains with countries \noutside the region and in increasing the value chain linkages within the region. To enable the \nregion to grow as the hub of safe and environment-friendly agro-based value chains, ADB \nfacilitated the ministerial level agreement Siem Reap Action Plan 2018\u20132022 for the Greater \nMekong Subregion.10 This action plan is in line with the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint \n2025, which places a strategic importance to the ANR sector.11 \n \n10.  Promotion  of  advanced  technologies.  Application  of  advanced  technologies  to \nagriculture is on the rise. Advanced technologies vary from agricultural machinery, biotechnology \nfor seeds and agricultural chemicals, and satellite imaging to more recent technologies such as \ninternet of things, drones, and robotics. They enable farmers to access critical information and \nimprove farming operations and marketing of their products. Buyers of farm products can better \ncommunicate  with  farmers  and  manage  supplies  and  inventory  more  efficiently.  Advanced \ntechnologies will also help establish food traceability systems, which are increasingly in demand \nby consumers. \n \n11.  The TA facility will help prepare and implement investment projects that will address the \nabove-mentioned challenges and capitalize on the opportunities. These projects will continue to \n(i) promote the use of climate-smart agricultural practices; (ii) promote the adoption of advanced \ntechnologies such as satellite and drone-assisted applications to increase irrigation efficiency; \n(iii) ensure  the  sustainable  use  of  land  and  water  resources;  and  (iv)  enhance  disaster \npreparedness  and  climate  resilience.  The  projects  will  strengthen  public  infrastructure  and \nservices (e.g., irrigation, rural roads, public markets, and food safety-related facilities and services) \nto create enabling ANR sector development and business environments for agro-based value \nchain stakeholders (e.g., private agribusiness entities and farmer cooperatives). They will also \npromote private sector investment to accelerate growth by increasing productivity and adding \nvalue, and ensure the quality of growth by improving food safety and environmental controls. The \nprojects will also promote efficiency in resource use, especially in the post-harvest segments of \nagro-based value chains. They will incorporate gender designs and targets to improve and \nsupport women\u2019s participation in the ANR sector.  \n \n12.  The  TA  facility  will  support  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  and  its  operational  priorities  by \n(i) promoting rural development and food security; (ii) addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities; (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental  sustainability;  (iv)  fostering  regional  cooperation  and  integration;  and \n(v) accelerating progress in gender equality.12  \n \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2017.

The TA facility will assist the DMCs in \npreparing projects for ADB financing. This will include due diligence assessments including \n(i) technical suitability, (ii) economic and financial viability, (iii) governance, (iv) poverty impact \nand social and gender development, and (v) social and environment safeguards.13 During the TA \nfacility implementation, lessons learned from previous projects will be incorporated into the \npreparation of new projects. \n \n14.  Output 2: Project implementation support, capacity development, and policy advice \nprovided. The facility will provide the DMCs with (i) project implementation support; (ii) capacity \ndevelopment in procurement, financial management and disbursement, safeguards, and project-\nrelated technical aspects; and (ii) policy advisory and sector assessments. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $3,500,000, of which (i) $2,600,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($1,600,000 from TASF 6 and \n$1,000,000 from TASF-other sources); and (ii) $900,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the \nProject Readiness Improvement Trust Fund (PRITF) and administered by ADB.14 \n \n16.  The PRITF will help incorporate climate change proofing in the project design and improve \nproject  readiness.  The  key  expenditure  items  are  listed  in  Appendix  1.  ADB  will  explore \ncofinancing opportunities with other trust funds such as Water Financing Partnership Facility, \nHigh-Level Technology Fund, and other funds from development partners including Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement. \n \n17.  The  governments  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  staff  time,  office \naccommodation,  office  supplies,  communication  facilities  for  consultants,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. Activities in each participating DMC will start after obtaining no-objection from their \ngovernment. The governments were informed that approval of the TA facility does not commit \nADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  Output 1 activities will start after ADB approves the concept paper of the first ensuing loan \ncovered by the TA facility. Output 2 activities may commence upon approval of the TA facility. \nADB will administer the TA. The Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Division of the \nSoutheast Asia Department of ADB will be responsible for the implementation of the TA facility. \nThe  TA  facility  will  be  implemented  over  5  years,  commencing  in  January  2019.
