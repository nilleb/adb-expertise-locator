The \nproject  will  invest  in  forming  a  river  basin  organization  with  adequate  capacity  and  decision \nsupport  systems  for  integrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM).  It  will  finance  the \nconstruction  of  upstream  water  storage,  riverbed  oxygenating  weirs,  riverbank  beautification, \nand community initiatives to improve the river environment in Kathmandu Valley.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nThe  BRB  has  significant  cultural  and  economic  values  for  the  people  of  Nepal.  The \n3. \nBagmati river water is considered holy and is used for cultural and ritual ceremonies practiced at \nthe many significant temples along the river\u2019s banks. The river flows through Kathmandu Valley, \nwhich is the administrative and economic center of the country as well as Nepal\u2019s gateway for \ntourism. It provides most of the city\u2019s drinking water in its upper basin, hydropower generation in \nthe middle basin, and large-scale irrigation in the lower basin. \n \n4. \nThe  BRB  is  considered  the  most  water-stressed  basin  in  Nepal  with  (i)  declining \navailable water resources due to natural and anthropogenic causes, (ii) significant increases in \nfreshwater  demand  from  the  expanding  population  and  industry  sector,  and  (iii)  a  continuous \nneed  for  irrigated  agriculture.  The  rapid  and  unplanned  expansion  of  Kathmandu  City  has \nplaced  tremendous  pressure  on  water  resources  of  the  upper  BRB.  In  the  absence  of \nappropriate  solid  waste  and  wastewater  management,  the  river  has  become  the  main  waste \ncollector  drain  and  now  carries  high \nfecal  contamination,  pathogenic  bacteria,  and \nphysicochemical  pollutants.  The  absence  of  effective  pollution  control  measures  is  causing \nserious health hazards for local residents, livestock, and aquatic flora and fauna. The physical \ndeterioration of the riverine environment has led to a loss of cultural and recreational amenities \nfor local communities that no longer respect or cherish the river environment.  \n \n5. \nRapid urbanization has also increased demand on the valley\u2019s water supply distribution. \nDuring  dry  season,  about  80%  of  the  upper  Bagmati  River  flow  is  diverted  for  domestic  use \nleaving very little for irrigation and other sectors, including the environment. Current utilization of \nsurface  water  is  only  10%  of  the  annual  river  runoff  because  of  the  lack  of  water  storage \nfacilities.  As  a  result,  municipalities,  individuals,  and  companies  extract  groundwater  at  an \nunsustainable  rate,  estimated  to  be  4  to  5  times  higher  than  the  natural  recharge.  The  water \ntable has retreated by 35 meters (m) since 1993. The situation is aggravated by the conversion \nof  recharge  areas  into  residential  areas  and  upstream  catchment  degradation.  In  Kathmandu \nValley, the river is biologically dead; the remaining discharge is mainly heavily polluted sewage \n\n                                                \n1   Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. \n2   ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to Nepal for Preparing the Bagmati River Basin Improvement Project. Manila (TA \n\n8050-NEP). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nwater  that  endangers  the  health  of  the  capital\u2019s  population  and  downstream  water  users, \nespecially  the  poor  and  vulnerable  households.  Throughout  the  basin,  frequent  floods  and \nriverbank erosion are the main threat to infrastructure and people\u2019s lives and livelihoods.  \n \n6. \nThe planning, development, and management of water resources in the BRB have been \ngenerally ad hoc, uncoordinated, and reactive. Government agencies have operated in isolation \nleading  to  ineffective  investments  and  inequitable  allocation  of  water  for  human  needs  and \nproductive use, including the environment. This hampers the government\u2019s development efforts \nto  improve  water  security  in  the  basin.  The  government  recognizes  the  importance  of \naddressing these problems by moving away from a silo-management approach and the need to \nembrace  the  principles  of  IWRM. 3 The  current  Water  Resources  Act  (1993)  has  sought  to \nquantify  existing  use  and  allocation  rights. 4  Subsequent  strategy  and  planning  documents \nrecognize  the  importance  of  IWRM  and  established  the  need  for  holistic  and  systematic \nmanagement  and  development  of  water  resources. 5  They  also  commit  to  conservation  of \nresources and protection of the environment. The Bagmati River Basin Improvement Project will \nsupport the development of appropriate legal and institutional frameworks to operationalize the \nIWRM approach and develop a model that can be replicated in other basins of the country.  \n\n7. \nIn 2009, the government approved the Bagmati Action Plan, 2009\u20132014 to address the \npoor state of the upper BRB.6 The plan\u2019s vision is for \u201ca clean, green and healthy river system \nthat is full of life and valued by all.\u201d The plan provides a long list of interventions that collectively \naim  to  restore  and  conserve  the  river  health 7  in  Kathmandu  Valley.  The  High  Powered \nCommittee  for  the  Integrated  Development  of  the  Bagmati  Civilization  (HPCIDBC)  is  already \nimplementing  some  of  these,  but  lack  of  capacity  and  funds  means  that  many  of  the  plan\u2019s \nrecommendations have not yet been implemented. The government has also sought to address \ndrinking  water  scarcity  and  improve  wastewater  management  in  Kathmandu  Valley  through \nseveral  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-financed  projects.8 While  these  projects  will  address \nimmediate human needs, they do not resolve other critical priorities of the basin inhabitants or \nprovide a long-term sustainable management framework for the BRB.  \n \n8. \nSuch  priorities  were  identified  and  developed  under  a  capacity  development  TA  that \nstrategically assessed current and planned interventions from a river-basin perspective.9 The TA \nproduced a basin strategic investment road map and initiated studies aimed at resolving critical \npriorities.  In  particular,  it  produced  a  water  balance  and  quality  model  to  assess  interventions \nrequired  to  restore  the  health  of  the  upper  Bagmati  River  and  achieve  bathing  standards  at \nPashnupatinath and Gokarna temples. Interventions identified include (i) physical restoration of \nthe  urban  riparian  environment  and  social  mobilization  to  reconnect  riverine  communities  with \ntheir  river,  (ii)  increase  of  river-water  availability  during  the  dry  season  to  increase  the  river\u2019s \n\n                                                \n3  Silo management approach refers to an approach where each water user sector develops plans to utilize water in \n\nisolation, without considering the impact on other sectors\u2019 requirements. \n\n4   The act provided only 18 months to assess existing water rights. As the assessment could not be completed within \n\nthis period, subsequently water use could not be managed or monitored, or allocations enforced. \n\n5   Government of Nepal. 2002.

The need for a flood forecasting and early warning system was \nidentified  as  a  critical  priority,  particularly  in  the  lower  basin  where  communities  are  regularly \nexperiencing extreme flood hazards. \n \nLessons from past projects indicate the need to consider IWRM as a process rather than \n9. \na finite intervention. Projects trying to address many basin issues at one time have often proven \ntoo complex to implement. Through a programmatic and gender-inclusive participatory process, \nthe  project  will  follow  a  phased  approach  and  initially  focus  on  priority  issues  identified  by  the \nbasin  stakeholders  to  (i)  strengthen  river  basin  governance  through  legal  and  institutional \nreform,  (ii)  improve  the  river  environment  in  Kathmandu  Valley,  and  (iii) reduce  water-induced \ndisaster impacts throughout the basin.  \n \n10. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Nepal,  which \nsupports Nepal\u2019s peace and development by promoting (i) broad-based and inclusive economic \ngrowth,  (ii)  inclusive  social  development,  (iii)  governance  and  capacity  building,  and  (iv) \nenvironmental sustainability.10 The project will improve governance, build capacity, and improve \nenvironmental  sustainability.  The  project  fits  into  the  priority  sector  of  agriculture  and  natural \nresources and theme of environment sustainability outlined in the country partnership strategy. \nIt is included in the country operations business plan, 2013\u20132015.11 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe  impact  will  be  increased water  security  in  the  BRB. The  outcome  will  be  improved \nriver health and flood management. The project is the first attempt in Nepal to apply the concept \nand principles of IWRM since its adoption under the 2005 National Water Plan. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs  \n\n12. \nThe project focuses on priority issues selected by the basin stakeholders from the basin \nstrategic  investment  road  map.  The  road  map  is  based  on  the  2009  Bagmati  Action  Plan  and \nfurther consultations with basin stakeholders.

The  designs  for  the  structural  works  in  the  upper  Bagmati  River  were \nproduced with the support of an urban architect and cultural heritage specialist. They favor local \nengineering systems, such as use of stones and bricks, and design with local cultural amenities \nand  architectural  features.  The  design  capacity  of  the  improved  river  corridor  will  meet  the \nappropriate  local  design  standards  for  flood  management  incorporating  anticipated  impacts  of \nclimate change. Construction equipment, material, and labor are all readily and locally available. \nThe  size  of  the  dam  and  reservoir  was  determined  based  on  stakeholder  priorities  and  using \ndetailed  water  quantity  and  quality  models  accounting  for  future  developments  including \npopulation growth, urbanization, and investments in water (Melamchi Water Supply Project) and \nwastewater  management  (Kathmandu  Valley  Wastewater  Management  Project).14 Feasibility \nstudies  for  the  dams  included  hydrologic  and  geotechnical  investigations  as  well  as  seismic \nhazard and dam break analysis. Design standards for the dams are based on the Guidelines of \nthe  International  Commission  on  Large  Dams  and  Australian  National  Committee  on  Large \nDams. The Dhap dam is a moderate-size dam: 24 m high with 861,000 m3 storage. While it is \nnot  classified  as  an  extreme  hazard  dam,  prudent  conservative  design  criteria  were  adopted:  \n(i)  earthquake  standard  of  1:100  annual  exceedence  probability  and  maximum  credible \nearthquake associated with the closest active fault to the site; and (ii) probable maximum flood \ndesign  accounting  for  anticipated  impacts  of  climate  change.  Machinery  used  to  construct  the \ndams will access the site via an existing road that will be upgraded in places under the project. \nConstruction  machinery,  equipment,  materials,  and  labor  are  readily  and  locally  available. \nInternational specialists reviewed the final designs.  \n \n21. \nClimate  change.  An  analysis  of  likely  changes  of  temperature  and  rainfall  was \nconducted  to  appraise  the  resilience  of  the  proposed  infrastructure  investments  to  climate \nchange. The analysis used the latest downscaled projections including those from a 2010 TA.15 \nThe  analysis  revealed  the  average  mean  maximum  temperature  in  the  BRB  will  increase  by \n1.5\u00b0\u20132.1\u00b0 Celsius under various emission scenarios for 2070\u20132099 compared with 1970\u20131999. \nSimilarly, annual rainfall in the upper BRB is projected to decrease by 2% and monsoon rainfall \nby 8% from 2020 to 2040, and by 11% and 6% from 2041 to 2060 compared with 1994\u20132000. \nThe reduction in rainfall during the first 20 years may not affect the filling capacity of the Dhap \nreservoir as current available runoff is estimated at 160% of reservoir capacity. Variations from \nyear-to-year  are  projected  to  increase  with  more  extremes.  Therefore,  regulation  through \nreservoirs will be beneficial in maintaining the required flow in the river during the dry season.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\nThe  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  14.5%;  the  net  present  value  is  \n22. \n$4.5 million. The economic internal rate of return is higher than the economic opportunity cost of \ncapital  estimated  at  12.0%,  indicating  sufficient  economic  return.  The  sensitivity  analysis  with \nadverse variation in the project costs and project benefits indicates an economic internal rate of \nreturn above 12.0% even with increased costs and reduced benefits. The risk analysis confirms \nthat the project is resilient to downside risks. \n\n                                                \n14  ADB.  2011.  Technical  Assistance  to  Nepal  for  the  Kathmandu  Valley  Urban  Environment  Improvement  Project. \n\nManila (TA 7936-NEP). \n\n15  ADB.  2010.  Technical  Assistance  to  Nepal  for  Strengthening  Capacity  for  Managing  Climate  Change  and  the \n\nEnvironment. Manila (TA 7173-NEP, completed in July 2012). \n\n \n\n\f23. \nA  financial  sustainability  analysis  of  the  project  assessed  the  capacity  of  implementing \nagencies  to  sustain  project-related  recurrent  expenditure  and  its  debt  service  obligations.  In \n2011\u20132012, the Department of Irrigation, HPCDIBC and WECS, had total recurrent expenditure \nof NRs97 million. The project recurrent expenditure is estimated at NRs6.2 million, which is 6% \nof the recurrent expenditure of the implementing agencies. Therefore the project will not impose \na significant burden on the recurrent expenditure of these agencies.  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance  \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n24. \nwith  the  government  and  MOUD,  and  specific  measures  were  built  into  the  project  design  to \nmitigate  risk,  including  (i)  a  project  communication  strategy,  (ii)  reduced  number  of  contracts, \nand (iii) provision of procurement consultant expertise. Financial management and procurement \ncapacity  assessments  of  the  implementing  agencies  were  conducted  and  mitigation measures \nadopted  to  address  the  weaknesses.  Other  risk  assessments  were  conducted  during  project \ndesign with tools specifically designed for Nepal. Based on these assessments, some mitigation \nmeasures  incorporated  in  the  project  design  are  to  (i)  implement  the  project  communication \nstrategy for regular disclosure of project-related information to citizens; (ii) develop and regularly \nupdate a project website to enhance transparency in project implementation, procurement, and \nsafeguards; and (iii) establish a grievance redress mechanism to ensure effective resolution. \n\n \nPoverty and Social  \n\nD. \n\n25. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  A  poverty  and  social \nanalysis  was  completed.  While  the  primary  project  beneficiaries  are  the  people  living  in  the \nBRB,  the  project  specifically  includes  the  poor  and  socially  excluded.  Investment  activities  for  \n(i)  improved  water  security,  (ii)  conservation  of  watershed  and  augmentation  of  water  in  the \nriver,  (iii)  improved  sanitation  due  to  better  river  environment,  (iv)  reduction  of  flood  hazards,  \n(v)  good governance  through  establishing  a  dedicated  RBO,  and  (vi)  capacity  development  of \nlocal  residents  will  directly  benefit  all,  including  the  poor  and  the  socially  excluded.  A  gender \nequality  and  social  inclusion  action  plan  was  prepared  with  clear  targets,  responsibilities,  and \nresource  allocation.  Specific  gender  design  features  are  included  in  50%  or  more  of  project \noutputs.  The  project  will  contribute  to  improving  women's  access  to  benefits  from  the  project; \n30% of employment generated from rehabilitation works will be reserved for women. The project \nhas prepared a stakeholder communication strategy for community awareness and participation \nto help mobilize key stakeholders for widespread and meaningful participation. \n\n \nSafeguards  \n\nE. \n\n26. \nSocial  safeguards. The project is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement \nand  indigenous  peoples.  A  resettlement  framework  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  as  a  prudent  measure  to  address  any  involuntary \nresettlement-related  uncertainty  during  project  implementation,  should  any  issue  arise.  The \nproject does not include any component that will require land acquisition leading to involuntary \nresettlement, or involve involuntary restrictions on land use or on access to legally designated \nparks and protected areas. All civil works related to the Bagmati River channel improvement will \nbe limited to the existing government-owned right-of-way, and the proposed Dhap dam will be \nlocated within a national park (it is proposed to submerge an older dam). No adverse impacts on \nindigenous peoples are anticipated. Indigenous peoples living in the river basin area will benefit \nfrom the project like other residents. The project does not directly or indirectly affect the dignity, \nhuman  rights,  livelihood  systems,  or  culture  of  indigenous  peoples  or  affect  the  territories  or \nnatural  or  cultural  resources that  indigenous  peoples  may  own,  use,  occupy,  or  claim  as  their \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n \nancestral  domain.  The  project  preparatory  team  has  carried  out  meaningful  consultations  with \nrelevant stakeholders and MOUD will continue to do so with all communities in the project area, \nespecially with reference to community mobilization for a better environment. \n \n27. \nEnvironment safeguards. The project is classified as category A and an environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  including  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  was  prepared  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  is  uploaded  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  The \nEIA covers proposed project interventions, including the construction of an 850,000 m3 storage \nreservoir (Dhap dam) with a 24 m high dam, constructed 375 m downstream of an existing dam \nwithin Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park (SNNP). Construction of the new dam will increase the \ninundation area from 1.5 hectares to 12.5 hectares. The EIA also assesses the impacts of the \ninclusion  of  a  second  reservoir,  the  Nagmati  dam,  which  is  to  be  located  downstream  of  the \nDhap  dam,  also  within  SNNP,  for  which  only  detailed  designs  are  to  be  prepared.  The  main \nadverse  impact  of  the  project  is  the  inundation  of  land  within  a  protected  area.  Due  to  past \nactivities in SNNP, the forest area within these two sites is re-grown forest and contains only a \nfew  large  mature  trees.  Among  impacts  to  flora  and  fauna,  construction  of  the  Dhap  dam  will \nresult in habitat loss of approximately 0.03%. The EIA confirms that the small loss of habitat will \nnot  adversely  affect the nesting, feeding ground,  and reproduction system  of  wild fauna  in the \narea,  as  similar  habitats  are  found  within  SNNP.  Any  residual  impact  will  be  offset  by  the \nconservation  of  watershed  of  the  area,  which  is  supported  by  the  project.  Several  alternatives \nwere  considered  for  augmenting  river flows,  including  interbasin  transfers  and alternative dam \nlocations within and outside SNNP. The analysis demonstrates that the options selected under \nthe  project  are  the  most  feasible.  The  project  will  not  lead  to  significant  negative  cumulative \nimpacts on biodiversity, water quality, or ecological flows. \n \n28. \nThe EMP includes measures to minimize negative impacts and the dam design includes \na  minimum  environmental  flow  to  support  the  limited  aquatic  fauna  and  fish  supported  by  the \nriver\u2019s  ecosystem.  Given  the  high  pollution  within  the  Bagmati  River,  the  project  will  result  in \nseveral  positive  impacts,  which  will  outweigh  the  negative.  The  positive  impacts  include  \n(i) improved water quality and urban river environment; (ii) increased groundwater recharge; and \n(iii) ensured bathing water quality standard at the Pashupatinath temple to meet the community \nritual requirements during cultural festivals in the dry season.  \n \n29. \nAn environment specialist will be engaged to update the EMP after detailed designs are \ncompleted, supervise its implementation, and provide capacity building to implementing agency \nstaff.  The  Department  of  Irrigation  and  HPCIDBC  will  supervise  EMP  implementation.  An \nindependent  environment  consultant  will  monitor  EMP  implementation.  Stakeholders  were \nconsulted during project design; this will continue during project implementation in accordance \nwith  the  project\u2019s  communication  strategy.  The  project  will  establish  a  grievance  redress \nmechanism for resolving grievances of project-affected people. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures  \n\n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.16\n The integrated benefits and impacts of the \nproject are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n16 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nNepal adopts a federal structure that \nfails to recognize water as a state \nsubject. \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nMitigating Measures \nThe project adopts the IWRM approach for subbasins rather \nthan whole basin. \n\nParliament is not in place for adoption of \nnecessary policy, legal, and institutional \nreforms, including RBO establishment. \n\nMOUD, with support from ADB and the technical assistance, \nwill secure approval to establish an RBO through Presidential \nordinance.  \n\nWWTP effluent quality at Gokarna and \nGuheshwori is lower than standards \nagreed during design of the KVWMP. \nThe environmental flow generated for \nimproved water quality in the Bagmati \nRiver is withdrawn for other uses. \n\nMOUD is also the KVWMP executing agency.
