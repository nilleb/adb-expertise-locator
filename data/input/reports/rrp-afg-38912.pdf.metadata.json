The \nProject will be structured to ensure capital backing of the PRGs and \nleverage cofinancing from various official and commercial sources. It \ncomprises two principal components: \n \n(i)  the Afghanistan Investment Guarantee Facility (AIGF), to be \nestablished  by  the  Government  of  Afghanistan  and \nimplemented by the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency \n(MIGA)  with  funding  through  an  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) project loan ($5 million equivalent) and other official \nsources, including an International Development Association \n(IDA)  credit  ($5  million  equivalent)  and  bilateral  grants \n(amounts yet to be confirmed), to cover the face value of the \nPRGs issued by the AIGF on a \u201cfirst loss\u201d basis; and \n \n(ii)  supplemental  PRG  cover  without  Government  counter-\nguarantee,  to  be  provided  by  ADB  (up  to  $10  million \nequivalent, through the Supplemental PRG Facility), MIGA (up \nto $10 million), and other public or private insurers (anticipated \nto be up to $30 million), to supplement on a \u201csecond loss\u201d \nbasis the cover issued by the AIGF.  \n \nInvestors may choose any combination of four types of risk coverage: \ntransfer  restriction,  expropriation,  war  and  civil  disturbance,  and \nbreach of contract. PRG coverage is targeted at investments in the \nsmall and medium enterprises sector, although larger projects can be \nconsidered on a case-by-case basis. PRGs issued under the Project \nwill normally be for a period of not more than 7 years. \n \nRationale  To  support  and  sustain  the  reconstruction  effort,  employment \n  generation, and long-term economic growth in Afghanistan, a vibrant \nand active private sector is needed. The Government has given high \npriority  to  private  sector  promotion  in  its  development  agenda. \nHowever, many potential investors consider political risk as a major \ninvestment impediment. Without insurance against selected political or \nnoncommercial risks for investment projects, many potential investors \nare reluctant to do business in Afghanistan and are taking a wait-and-\nsee attitude. Currently, only limited amounts of political risk insurance \n   ", "ii \n(PRI)  are  available  worldwide  for  Afghanistan.  By  providing  an \neffective vehicle for political risk mitigation, private sector investment \ninto Afghanistan can be catalyzed. \n \nObjectives  The proposed Project seeks to assist Afghanistan in its reconstruction \n  efforts and stimulate growth and employment, by facilitating foreign \ndirect investment through a risk mitigation facility that will address key \ninvestor concerns.  \n \nCost Estimates and  The cost for capitalizing the AIGF is estimated at about $10 million. \nFinancing Plan  ADB\u2019s financing contribution to the AIGF is proposed to be a project \n  loan of $5 million equivalent to match the amount that IDA will commit \nto  the  Project.  The  AIGF  amount  will  be  leveraged  through \nsupplemental PRG coverage without Government counterguarantee to \nabout  $60  million.  The  Supplemental  PRG  Facility  coverage  is \nproposed by ADB up to $10 million to match the amount that MIGA will \ncommit under the Project. Additional resources of about $30 million \nare expected to be mobilized from the private sector or other official \nPRI  providers,  through  MIGA\u2019s  Co-operative  Underwriting  Program \n(CUP).   \n \nItem                          Amount ($million)    \nAIGFa                $10.0 \nADB PRG                $10.0 \nMIGA                $10.0 \nPrivate/Public PRI                  $30.0    \n  Total                $60.0   \na  Financed by ADB and IDA. \nSource:  ADB staff estimates. \nProject Loan   \n  Amount  A  loan  of  Special  Drawing  Rights  (SDR)  3.43  million  ($5 million \n  and Terms  equivalent)  is  proposed  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  for \n  funding the AIGF. The loan will have a term of 40 years, including a \ngrace period of 10 years; an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per \nannum; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft \nLoan Agreement.  \n \n  Allocation and   The Government will deposit the funds required to capitalize the AIGF \n  Disbursements   in  a  special  account,  which  is  to  be  administered  by  MIGA.  For \n    administrative ease, ADB may directly disburse the loan proceeds to \n  the special account, following withdrawal applications submitted by \nMIGA (on behalf of the Government) and based on the pipeline of \nprojects to be guaranteed.  \n \n  Utilization Period  The loan is expected to become effective in September 2004, and to \n  and Project   be available for withdrawals for a period of 5 years, with a possible \n  Completion Date  extension of up to 3 years based on actual demand.  \n \n  Executing Agency  Ministry of Finance of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. \n   \n ", "iii \n  Implementation  The various components under the Project will be administered by \n  Arrangements  MIGA,  which  will  act  as  the  Implementing  Agency  for  the  Project. \n  MIGA issues guarantees to eligible investors on behalf of the AIGF \nand itself, and coordinates with ADB as well as with other commercial \nPRI providers for guarantees issued through the use of MIGA\u2019s CUP. \nMIGA will take the lead in underwriting, administration, and claims \nmanagement while keeping all providers of coverage (including ADB) \nfully  apprised  of  its  activities  in  these  areas.  The  use  of  MIGA\u2019s \nunderwriting policies and methodologies will ensure that only projects \nthat are financially viable and have a positive development impact on \nAfghanistan will be underwritten under the Project. MIGA will liaise \nwith  Afghanistan  Investment  Support  Agency  for  marketing  and \npromotion of the Project, and with the Government to receive host \ncountry approval before issuing any guarantees under the Project. \n \nThe  AIGF  will  be  managed  by  MIGA  in  line  with  administrative, \naccounting,  financial  reporting,  and  internal  control  measures \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Interest  earned  by  the  AIGF  on  the  special \naccount during the project period will be used to offset operating and \nfunding costs and build up reserves if claims have to be paid. Payouts \nfrom the special account to PRG holders will be based on valid claims \nas determined in the PRG documentation. \n \n  Procurement   During  the  project  implementation  period,  there  will  be  no  direct \n  procurement of physical goods and services; rather, the loan will be \n  utilized to fund PRGs issued by the AIGF (through MIGA) to guarantee \ninvestments and imports as well as domestic inputs to be utilized by \nthe  guarantee  holder.  Most  of  this  investment  or  procurement  is \nexpected to come from ADB member countries, including Afghanistan. \nHowever, some investment or procurement may come from non-ADB \nmember countries. It is proposed that guarantees issued by the AIGF \nand  under  the  Supplemental  PRG  Facility  be  allowed  to  support \ntransactions in which the underlying investment will procure goods and \nservices from all countries including non-ADB member countries. This \nis  to  support  the  Project\u2019s  goal,  to  enhance  economic  efficiency \nthrough  procurement  of  inputs  on  a  cost  effective  basis  and  thus \nenhance development impact.  \n \nAny unused funds remaining in the special account at the end of the \nproject  implementation  period,  or  that  become  available  as  PRGs \nexpire after the project implementation period, may be utilized by the \nGovernment for establishing a new guarantee facility, or for financing \nimports other than ineligible items from ADB member countries and in \naccordance with ADB policies and Procurement Guidelines. \n \nSupplemental PRG  An  amount  of  up  to  $10  million  equivalent  of  PRGs  without \nFacility   Government counterguarantee and with backing from ADB\u2019s ordinary \n  capital resources is proposed to be issued under the Supplemental \nPRG Facility. PRGs issued by ADB under the Supplemental PRG \nFacility  may  cover  various  forms  of  debt,  but  not  any  equity \ninvestments.  The  Supplemental  PRG  Facility  will  be  administered \n   ", "iv \n(applications, processing, claims management and so on) by MIGA \nthrough the use of MIGA\u2019s CUP, together with guarantee capacity \noffered by MIGA itself. Implementation details, including underwriting, \npricing, and claims administration, will be specified in a Framework \nAgreement for the AIGF (between Government and MIGA), and a \nParticipation  Agreement  (between  ADB  and  MIGA)  and  the  CUP \ndocumentation  for  the  Supplemental  PRG  Facility  (between  ADB, \nother insurers, and MIGA). Fees and charges for PRGs will be in line \nwith market practices and agreed upon by ADB and MIGA. \n \nCofinancing  Parallel loan and grant cofinancing is expected from multilateral and \n  bilateral sources for the AIGF, including an IDA credit (of $5 million \nequivalent) and grant assistance (with amounts to be confirmed) from \nbilateral sources. The grants for technical assistance will be sourced \nand implemented by MIGA. In addition, co-guarantees will be provided \nby  MIGA  (about  $10  million  equivalent,  to  match  the  ADB \ncommitment), as well as by private or other official PRI providers (up \nto about $30 million). \n \nProject Benefits and  The Project will yield a wide range of benefits across different levels, \nBeneficiaries  including the macroeconomic level, the sector and policy levels, the \n  institutional  level,  and  the  investment  and  enterprise  levels.  The \n  Project will stimulate the local economy, generate employment, create \ntax revenues, and assist in the transfer of modern technologies and \nbusiness  practices  from  abroad  to  Afghanistan.  It  is  designed  to \nstimulate private business activity and attract foreign direct investment \nin a variety of sectors, including, but not limited to, manufacturing, \nagribusiness, banking, and smaller scale infrastructure projects.  \n \nRisks and Assumptions  A key concern is that private investors and lenders will not be induced \n  to finance transactions despite the risk mitigation offered by the AIGF \nand other risk participants such as MIGA and ADB. The main risks \nrelate  to  security,  policy,  and  business  risks,  for  which  mitigation \nmeasures have been put in place as applicable. Security continues to \nbe a concern for investors, and if the security situation deteriorates \nsignificantly, private investors may choose not to continue with plans \nto invest in Afghanistan despite the existence of the Project. Also, \neffective sanctioning, monitoring, and legal systems are just emerging, \nand  effective  contract  enforcement  has  yet  to  be  demonstrated. \nAnother risk is that after an initially good start, a large number of \nclaims may arise due to a breakdown of the political environment or \neven a resumption of hostilities. This risk will be mitigated by ADB\u2019s \nand MIGA\u2019s right to suspend the issuance of guarantees.  \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan; and (ii) a proposed political risk guarantee (PRG) \nfacility  without  government  counterguarantee  (the  Supplemental  PRG  Facility),  for  the \nAfghanistan Investment Guarantee Facility Project.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES1 \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Importance of Private Sector Development Recognized. After prolonged civil strife \nand conflict, Afghanistan's infrastructure and industries are in a desolate condition; its human \nresource base and social capital are severely depleted, and public institutions are hindered by \nweak operational capacity. While the international community is exerting considerable efforts to \nsupport Afghanistan\u2019s rebuilding and development, available official flows are not sufficient to \nsupport and sustain the reconstruction effort. A vibrant private sector is necessary to generate \nemployment and long-term economic growth for poverty reduction, and to realize tangible results \nfrom further prospects of lasting peace. The importance of private sector development is also \nlaid down in the country\u2019s new constitution, which was adopted in December 2003.2 \n \n3.  Improvement in Investment Environment. The Government of Afghanistan has taken \nsignificant steps to improve the institutional, policy, and legal environments for investment. In \nOctober  2003,  the  Afghanistan  Investment  Support  Agency  (AISA)  was  created  as  a \nprofessional body within the framework of the Ministry of Commerce to facilitate and promote \ninvestment  in  Afghanistan.  A  government  directive  created  AISA  as  a  \u201cone  stop  shop  for \ninvestors\u201d, and made it responsible for registering, licensing, and promoting all investments in \nAfghanistan. AISA aims to operate as a lean and efficient organization, with key staff possessing \nsignificant international business experience. As one of its first measures, AISA streamlined the \nregistration process for new investments into Afghanistan from more than 28 steps, which took \nseveral months to complete, to only 5 steps that can be completed in less than 1 week. In \naddition,  a  new  investment  law3  was  drafted  and  is  expected  to  be  enacted  shortly.  It  is \nconsidered one of the most progressive investment laws in the region, allowing full foreign \ninvestment in virtually all sectors of the economy. There are no restrictions on remittances of \nprofits  and,  in  case  of  investor  complaints,  international  dispute  settlement  is  provided.  In \naddition, an open trade regime has been introduced, including a tariff band with only four slabs \nand maximum tariff of only 16% and streamlined customs clearance. \n \n4.  Financial Sector Reforms Under Way. A more efficient financial sector will be key to \nAfghanistan\u2019s private sector development, and important reforms have been undertaken over the \npast 18 months. In early 2003, a new currency was successfully introduced. Since then, a stable \nexchange rate regime has been maintained, and inflation has been kept under control. To \nfacilitate an efficient financial sector, a new banking law was enacted. It allows banks to be \n100% foreign owned. Several international banks have already opened offices in Afghanistan to \noffer a wider range of financial services. \n \n                                                 \n1  For a more detailed analysis, see ADBI. 2004. Post-Conflict Reconstruction: the Afghan Economy. Tokyo.  \n2  Article 10 of the Constitution states: \u201dThe state protects and promotes private investment based on a free market \neconomy\u201d. \n3   http://www.export.gov/afghanistan/pdf/afinvlaw.pdf ", " 2\n5.  Investment Picking Up. While reliable statistics on private sector activities are hard to \ncome by, indicators depict a sharp rise in recent trade and investment, and most of this is \nassumed to take place in the private sector. AISA has registered 151 new projects amounting to \n$435 million during the first 6 months of its operation (October 2003\u2013March 2004). International \ninvestors include a range of well-known firms in a variety of sectors from transport and logistics \nto tourism, telecommunications, agro-processing, consumer goods, and oil and gas. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Issues and Opportunities \n \n1.  Investment Environment \n \n6.  A Challenging Investment Environment with Considerable Potential. Despite the \ngood  progress  in  a  number  of  areas  over  the  past  months,  Afghanistan  still  lacks  a \ncomprehensive private sector support mechanism and gaps continue to exist in the policy, \nregulatory,  and  institutional  environments.  On  the  social  side,  unemployment  and \nunderemployment  remain  major  issues,  while  salaries  and  education  levels  are  low.  Yet, \nAfghans in the past have proven to be resilient, hardworking, and dedicated, and have thrived in \ndifficult environments. An international investor conference held in March 2004 in Berlin attracted \na significant number of potential investors and underlined that considerable returns can be \nexpected by investors that are courageous enough to invest in the early stages of economic \ndevelopment. By establishing an early presence in Afghanistan, companies can achieve a first \nmover advantage. A more detailed analysis of key issues for trade, investment, and private \nsector development is in Appendix 1. \n \n7.  Political Risks are a Key Investment Impediment. While there is considerable interest \nin Afghanistan from foreign private investors, political risks are perceived as substantial. Many \npotential investors interviewed consider political risk as a major investment impediment, and \ncompanies involved in substantial investment transactions indicated that they would need PRI \nbefore  going  ahead  with  their  projects.  Without  insurance  against  selected  political  or \nnoncommercial  risks  for  investment  projects,  investors  are  reluctant  to  do  business  in \nAfghanistan and are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Currently, only limited amounts of worldwide \nPRI are available for Afghanistan. Providing an effective vehicle for political risk mitigation can \nsignificantly catalyze private sector investment into Afghanistan. \n \n8.  Focus  on  Investors  from  the  Afghan  Diaspora.  To  speed  up  the  reconstruction \nprocess, the Government has started to engage the private sector aggressively. While external \naid is important for establishing sound conditions for a developing economy, aid alone cannot \nbuild long-term and lasting economic growth. It is within this context that the Government gives \nhigh  importance  to  attracting  foreign  direct  investors,  including  investors  from  the  Afghan \ndiaspora. The primary group of potential foreign investors for the country currently consists of \nreturning Afghan nationals who left Afghanistan as many as 25 years ago for Australia, Europe, \nNorth America, and other countries in the region. This diaspora has strong ties to Afghanistan \nand wishes to play a role in reconstructing the country.  \n \n9.  Potential for Regional Trade and Cooperation. Other countries interested in trade and \ninvestments  include  regional  partners  such  as  India,  Iran,  Pakistan,  Turkey,  United  Arab \nEmirates,  and  Uzbekistan,  each  of  which  has  trade  ties  to  the  country.  Moreover,  North \nAmerican and European companies will likely show an interest when opportunities arise. Many \nforeign investors view Afghanistan as a central business hub and vital trade route, where the \nMiddle East meets South and Southeast Asia.  \n \n ", "    3 \n10.  Diverse  Investment  Intentions  and  Opportunities.  In  the  period  November  2002-\nJanuary 2003, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) conducted a preliminary \nanalysis of the potential level of foreign direct investment (FDI) into Afghanistan as a proxy for \ndemand for political risk insurance (PRI). This analysis showed encouraging results. Demand is \nexpected to come from several sectors including energy, telecommunications, internet services, \nbanking, hotels, housing, food and agribusiness, textile, steel, oil and gas, and mining. Most of \nthis  will  be  through  small  and  medium-size  enterprises (SMEs),  or  smaller  investments  by \ninternational firms. Appendix 2 gives an indicative list of projects.  \n \n2.  Link to Country Strategy and Program \n \n11.  Private Sector Development is High on the Development Agenda. The Government \nhas given high priority to private sector promotion in its development agenda. Early in 2002, a \nclear strategy for the country\u2019s reconstruction was elaborated through the National Development \nFramework (NDF), which is based on three major development objectives: (i) humanitarian \nassistance, human and social capital; (ii) physical reconstruction and natural resources, and (iii) \nprivate sector development. In the NDF, the Government expressed a strong commitment to \ndevelop a competitive export-oriented economy, to provide the engine of growth and instrument \nof social inclusion through the creation of business opportunities. \n \n12.  A Key Ingredient in ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) resumed operations in Afghanistan in May 2002 with the approval of the Initial \nCountry Strategy and Program 2002\u20132004, which proposed $500 million in loans and grants \nover 2.5 years to build capacity, establish appropriate policy and institutional frameworks, and \nrehabilitate essential infrastructure.4 Support of the Government\u2019s strategy of a private sector-led \neconomic recovery will also be provided through ADB\u2019s private sector operations, expected to \ntotal  about  $53  million  in  2004  ($10  million  in  banks  and  funds,  $13  million  in  edible  oil \nprocessing, and $35 million in telecommunication expansion) and about $100 million in 2005 \n($75 million in cement production and $25 million in petroleum storage and retailing). ADB\u2019s \nprivate sector investments are expected to catalyze investments of about $240 million in 2004 \nand $450 million in 2005. At an international conference - Afghanistan and the International \nCommunity: A Partnership for the Future - in April 2004 in Berlin, ADB also offered to provide \nguarantees to catalyze private investments. Finally, Afghanistan\u2019s security and future prosperity \nwill be more easily achieved and more sustainable by promoting effective regional cooperation \non sectors such as transport, energy, and water. A summary of recent project approvals by ADB \nas well as assistance from other development partners is provided in Appendix 3. \n \n3.  Lessons Learned \n \n13.  Limited  Implementation  Experience  in  Afghanistan.  ADB\u2019s  recent  operations  in \nAfghanistan  resumed  only  in  December  2002  with  the  $150  million Postconflict  Multisector \nProgram  Loan  (PMPL).  This  was  the  first  loan  by  an  international  financial  institution  to \nAfghanistan since 1979. The PMPL promoted economic growth and recovery in the war-torn \ncountry by supporting policy and institutional reforms to improve governance and strengthen the \nfinancial,  transport,  and  energy  sectors.  The  $150  million  Emergency  Infrastructure \nRehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Project  (EIRRP),  approved  in  June  2003,  is  rebuilding \nimportant road and power infrastructure and irrigation systems in northern Afghanistan. The $55 \nmillion Agriculture Sector Program Loan (ASPL), approved in May 2004, promotes agricultural \n                                                 \n4  More recently, ADB pledged at an international conference on Afghanistan in early 2004 to consider assistance of \nabout $800 million in ADF loans and grants during 2005\u20132008, subject to finalization of ADF negotiations. See also \nADB. 2004. AFG: Initial Country Strategy Update (2004-2006). Manila.  \n   ", " 4\ngrowth and poverty reduction by developing a sound policy framework and efficient sector \ninstitutions. As of June 2004, ADB had also approved $26.35 million in capacity-building TA \ngrants, and was administering $65.6 million in cofinanced activities.  \n \n14.  Encouraging  Portfolio  Performance.  While  recent  implementation  experience  in \nAfghanistan is limited, early indicators suggest that Afghanistan has so far made good use of \naid. The PMPL leveraged policy and institutional reforms to ensure that reconstruction efforts in \nkey sectors are soundly based. Government compliance with program terms and conditions was \nexemplary; the final tranche was disbursed in December 2003. The ASPL aims at a similar \nobjective in agriculture and natural resource management; first tranche conditions were met \nbefore loan approval. The Government\u2019s timely and effective compliance with tranche conditions \nunderscores its sense of program ownership. Civil works under the EIRRP as well as pilot \nprojects  in  the  education,  health,  transport,  irrigation,  and  community  development  sectors \nfunded  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  and  Kuwait  Fund  for  Arab  Economic \nDevelopment are under way. TA projects are progressing smoothly despite minor delays due to \nsecurity concerns. To date, $187.4 million has been disbursed out of a total loan assistance of \n$372.2 million, a disbursement ratio of 50.4%. \n \n15.  Lessons of Development Partners in Similar Initiatives. While this is ADB\u2019s first \nsupport for an investment guarantee facility in a post-conflict environment, there is a wealth of \nfeedback from similar initiatives carried out by the World Bank and International Development \nAssociation (IDA) elsewhere. The proposed Project has design features similar to those of \nguarantee facilities that IDA undertook in Africa (Regional Trade Facilitation Project), Albania, \nBosnia  and  Herzegovina,  and  Moldova,  whereby  IDA  provided  credits  to  the  governments \nconcerned, which were then held in trust accounts in support of guarantees issued against \npolitical risks to private investors. It also has similarities with investment guarantee trust funds \noffered by the MIGA in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the West Bank and Gaza, whereby MIGA \non behalf of others, administered a trust fund against which it issued PRGs.  \n \n16.  The key lessons learned in preparing and implementing the preceding projects that are \nrelevant to this Project are the following: \n \n(i)  The main lesson is to root the project in a firm understanding of the target market \nand build on that understanding and subsequent contacts with the private sector \nto develop a strong database of prospective investment clients. Experience with \nthe  World  Bank\u2019s  Bosnia  facility  shows  that  the  PRG  facility  concept  has \nimportant scope for attracting other risk takers, including private political risk and \ncredit insurers. \n \n(ii)  The  leveraging  mechanism  allocates  the  risk  to  the  party  that  has  the  best \ncapacity  to  mitigate  it,  e.g.,  the  governments  concerned.  The  World  Bank\u2019s \nRegional Trade Facilitation Project in Africa was structured in such a way that \nclaims  would  be  paid  out  of  the  trust  account  to  which  the  IDA  funds  are \ndisbursed, until the funds in the account are exhausted (in other words, the trust \naccount is \u201cfirst loss\u201d), at which point the private insurers would become liable for \nadditional claims. \n \n(iii)  MIGA\u2019s  experience  in  administering  guarantee  trust  funds  for  Bosnia  and \nHerzegovina has revealed that a local MIGA presence in the host country to \nimplement these trust funds is essential to its success. This is because, without a \nsubstantial  marketing  effort,  the  start-up  period  of  the  facility  is  likely  to  be \n ", "    5 \nsluggish. In addition, local presence greatly facilitates the underwriting of a project \nin a complex conflict-affected environment, where MIGA\u2019s understanding of the \ncountry risk and the reputation of investors are significantly enhanced by having \nlocal presence.  \n \n17.  Need for Flexibility. The guarantee facility needs to be flexible enough to accommodate \na wide range of eligible investments that will support private sector development in a conflict-\naffected environment. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objective \n \n18.  The proposed Project will assist Afghanistan in its reconstruction efforts by supporting \nprivate sector development. The purpose is to stimulate FDI in an environment where political \nrisk is perceived as high, through a structured assistance modality that will issue PRGs to \neligible investors. Thus, the Project aims to attract FDI in a variety of sectors including, but not \nlimited to, manufacturing, agribusiness, banking, and smaller scale infrastructure projects. FDI is \nexpected to stimulate the local economy, generate employment, create tax revenues, and assist \nin transferring modern technologies and business practices from abroad to Afghanistan. The \nproject framework is in Appendix 4. \n \nB.  Components and Output \n \n  1.  Guarantee Cover Through Two Distinctive Components \n \n19.  The Project will be structured in two distinctive components to ensure capital backing of \nthe PRGs issued and leverage cofinancing from various official and commercial sources.  \n \n(i)  The Afghanistan Investment Guarantee Facility (AIGF). The AIGF will be funded \nfrom public sector sources on concessional terms, including loans from ADB ($5 \nmillion equivalent) and IDA ($5 million equivalent) as well as possible grants from \nother sources (amounts still to be firmed up). The AIGF will cover the face value \nof the PRGs issued by the AIGF on a \u201cfirst loss\u201d basis, i.e., before claims on \nsupplemental PRG cover under the Project are paid; and \n \n(ii)  Supplemental PRG cover without Government counterguarantee.  This will be \nprovided on commercial terms from risk-sharing partners, including ADB (up to \n$10 million equivalent, through the Supplemental PRG Facility), MIGA (up to $10 \nmillion) and other public or private insurers (anticipated to be up to $30 million). It \nwill supplement the cover issued by the AIGF on a \u201csecond loss\u201d basis. \n \nThe Project will thus aim to leverage the initial amount of $10 million from official sources in the \nAIGF through supplemental PRG cover from commercial sources to a total amount of about $60 \nmillion  in  PRGs.  As  guarantees  are  normally  expected  to  cover  only  a  portion  of  each \ninvestment, the total investment volume supported by the Project is expected to be higher. The \nconceptual structure of the Project is presented in the Figure below. \n \n   ", " 6\n  Structure of the Project \nOfficial (Public Sector) Funding: Commercial Risk-Taking Capacity:\nPrivate PRI \nBilateral Grants Loans (ADB, IDA) ADB MIGA\nMarket\nLeveraging through PRGs without \nCounterguarantee ($20-50 million)\nGovernment  of Afghanistan\n(Minstry of Finance) AIGF ($10 million, 1st loss)\nImplementaion Agent: \nMIGA\nTechnical \nAISA\nAssistance\nInvestors\n \n \n20.  The various components of the Project will be administered by MIGA, which will act as \nImplementing Agency for the Project.5 MIGA issues guarantees to eligible investors on behalf of \nthe AIGF and itself, and coordinates with ADB as well as other commercial PRI providers for \nguarantees issued through the use of MIGA\u2019s Co-operative Underwriting Program (CUP). MIGA \nwill take the lead in underwriting, administration, and claims management while keeping all \nproviders of coverage (including ADB) fully apprised of its activities in these areas. The use of \nMIGA\u2019s underwriting policies and methodologies will ensure that only projects that are financially \nviable and have a positive development impact on Afghanistan will be underwritten. MIGA will \nliaise with AISA for marketing and promotion of the Project, supported through grant TA funds, \nand will seek host country approval from the Government before issuing any guarantees under \nthe Project.  \n \na.  The Afghan Investment Guarantee Facility \n \n21.  The AIGF will cover a first loss portion of PRGs issued under the Project. The AIGF, \nthrough MIGA, will issue PRGs for debt and equity cover to be capitalized through loans from \nADB and IDA, as well as grants from other financing partners, including possibly Germany and \nthe United Kingdom. Total funding for the AIGF is anticipated to be $10 million initially, but may \nincrease subject to grant funding mobilized from bilateral resources. Funds deposited for the \nAIGF will be placed in a special account (administered by MIGA) to ensure adequate capital \nbacking for all PRGs issued under the AIGF. The funded structure of the AIGF and its ability to \nabsorb a first loss in any claim event are important factors to leverage additional resources from \nvarious risk sharing partners, including ADB, MIGA, and the private PRI market. \n                                                 \n5  Detailed justification for the selection of MIGA and its role as Implementing Agency is in paras. 38-39. \n ", "    7 \n22.  The provision of the ADB loan to Afghanistan for financing the AIGF, which in turn issues \nPRGs that may cover equity transactions, does not raise any conflict vis-\u00e0-vis Article 11(iv) of the \nCharter.6 This is also consistent with IDA\u2019s views with respect to its Articles of Agreement.7  \n \nb.  The Supplemental Political Risk Guarantee Facility \n \n23.  The coverage provided by the AIGF will be complemented and leveraged by risk-taking \ncapacity provided without counterguarantee by ADB, MIGA, and the private sector or other \nofficial PRI providers. ADB and MIGA are expected to provide each up to $10 million, with \nadditional  amounts  up  to  about  $30  million  mobilized  through  cofinancing  under  the  co-\nguarantee  programs  of  ADB  and  MIGA.  ADB\u2019s  PRGs  will  be  provided  without  sovereign \nguarantee  through  the  Supplemental  PRG  Facility.  The  PRGs  issued  on  behalf  of  ADB \ncombined with other risk taking partners will cover the portion not covered by the AIGF, and will \nbe called only for residual amounts following payout by the AIGF of the first loss in case of a \nclaim event.  \n \n24.  It is important to emphasize that although the AIGF will be issuing PRGs that may cover \nboth equity and debt, PRGs issued by ADB through the Supplemental PRG Facility will not cover \nequity transactions. Such PRGs will be limited to debt transactions.8 \n \n2.  Output and Scope  \n \n25.  The direct output of the Project will be the issuance of PRGs for cover of selected risks to \neligible investors for eligible debt and equity investments into Afghanistan. \n \n26.  Political  Risk  Covered.  The  Project  will  provide  risk  coverage  for  the  following \noccurrences, including four-point cover that is standard in the PRI industry: \n \n(i)  Currency  inconvertibility  and  non-transferability.  This  coverage  addresses \nlosses incurred from the inability to convert local currency into foreign exchange \nand/or transfer foreign exchange out of the host country. \n \n(ii)  Expropriation. This coverage applies when a loss is caused by host government \nactions  that  reduce  or  eliminate  ownership  of,  control  over,  or  rights  to  the \nguaranteed investment; this includes \u201ccreeping expropriation\u201d (i.e., a series of \nacts that, over time, have the same effect as expropriation). \n \n(iii)  Political violence. This coverage is applicable to loss resulting from physical \ndamage, destruction or disappearance of assets, and/or business interruption, \n                                                 \n6   Article 11(iv) governs the nature of guarantees that ADB may directly issue. It does not govern guarantees provided \nby a facility (such as AIGF) that is funded by, and a project of, the Government, which project is in turn financed in \npart, by ADB. (See also R189-94 LAO:Theun-Hinboun Hydropower Project, where ADB\u2019s Board approved a loan of \n$60 million to the Lao PDR which was used  largely to fund the Government of the Lao PDR\u2019s equity contribution \n[through Electricit\u00e9  du Laos] to the Theun-Hinboun Power Company Limited. In that case, this was consistent with \nthe way ADB can carry out its operations under Article 11 (i) and (ii), i.e., by making a direct loan to the \nGovernment.) \n7  IDA has a similar provision in its Articles of Agreement; namely Section 5(iv), which states \u201cIn addition to the \noperations specified elsewhere in this Agreement, the Association may: . . (iv) in special cases, guarantee loans \nfrom other sources for purposes not inconsistent with the provisions of these Articles;. . .\u201d   IDA views its IDA credit \npurely as a loan, and not a guarantee. \n8   In compliance with Article 11(iv) where the pertinent part states: \u201cThe Bank may carry out its operations\u2026 by (iv) \nguaranteeing, whether as a primary or secondary obligor, in whole or in part, loans for economic development \nparticipated in by the Bank.\u201d (emphasis added).   \n   ", " 8\ndue to politically motivated acts of war and civil disturbance (including terrorism \nand sabotage). \n \n(iv)  Breach of contract. This coverage is invoked when loss results from the breach \nby the host government of its contractual obligations to the investor. \n \n27.  Coverage  Amounts  and  Exposure  Limits.  PRGs  issued  under  the  Project  are \nexpected to total $60 million. Maximum exposure by the AIGF, ADB under the Supplemental \nPRG Facility, and MIGA will be $10 million equivalent each; additional coverage of up to $30 \nmillion will come from other commercial PRI providers. The AIGF, ADB\u2019s Supplemental PRG \nFacility, and MIGA cover have been designed to support investment in smaller projects. On a \nper-project basis, the coverage by the AIGF will normally not exceed $2 million.9 Risk sharing \narrangements with ADB, MIGA and private PRI providers will be considered on a case-by-case \nbasis as appropriate, and take into account restrictions on ADB and MIGA operations (para 31). \n \n28.  Eligible Investors and Investments. Eligible investors include individuals, corporations, \nor financial institutions that provide financing for new projects in Afghanistan, normally from \noutside Afghanistan. A state-owned corporation or financial institution is eligible if it operates on \na commercial basis. New investments are those that have neither been made nor irrevocably \ncommitted on the date of submission to MIGA of a signed preliminary application for guarantee \ncoverage.  New  investment  contributions  associated  with  the  expansion,  modernization,  or \nfinancial restructuring of existing projects may also be eligible, as well as acquisitions that \ninvolve the privatization of state-owned enterprises. About 10\u201320 guarantees are expected to be \nissued, targeting primarily at SMEs across a wide range of sectors (para. 10).  \n \n29.  In keeping with the Project\u2019s objective of promoting economic growth and development, \ninvestment  projects  must  be  financially  and  economically  viable,  environmentally  sound  (in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s and MIGA\u2019s environmental guidelines), and consistent with the labor \nstandards and other development objectives of Afghanistan. Projects related to the production or \ntrade of items for military or paramilitary purpose, narcotics or hazardous pesticides, or other \nitems as agreed upon with ADB and MIGA will not be eligible for cover under the AIGF and the \nSupplemental PRG Facility. \n \n30.  Types of investments that may be covered under the Project include equity (only to be \nprovided by the AIGF, MIGA and private PRI providers), shareholder loans and shareholder loan \nguarantees, as well as non-shareholder related loans.10 Other forms of investment, such as TA \nand management contracts, and franchising and licensing agreements, may also be eligible for \ncoverage. \n \n31.  The Project will be structured to take into account the differences between ADB\u2019s and \nMIGA\u2019s eligibility criteria for political risk coverage. For example, ADB is precluded from issuing \nguarantees for equity investments, whereas MIGA is not. On the other hand, MIGA can cover \nonly debt if it also covers equity or quasi equity related to the transaction. Accordingly, from a \nstructural perspective, the AIGF will have the flexibility to allow for various scenarios where \npolitical risk coverage will be available from both ADB and MIGA, as well as where cover will \ncome only from either ADB or MIGA. To allow such flexibility, the AIGF will be structured to \nprovide guarantees that meet either ADB or MIGA criteria, and the AIGF will be severally liable \n                                                 \n9  Lower limits may apply to transactions that do not meet eligibility requirements for ADB or MIGA cover (para. 31). \nLarger transactions may be considered on a case-by-case basis if all financing parties agree. \n10  Restrictions apply to MIGA cover for debt transactions, including a minimum loan period of  3 years, as well as \nrequired shareholder relationship. \n ", "    9 \n(on  a  first  loss  basis)  with  the  other  relevant  parties  that  are  providing  the  supplemental \ncoverage  (on  a  second  loss  basis)  for  each  individual  investment  project.  In  such  cases, \nexposure limits for the AIGF and the risk-sharing partners will be adjusted in line with prudent \nrisk management standards. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n32.  Public Private Partnership and Cofinancing. The Project is a highly innovative model \nfor  public-private  partnership  and  cooperation  and  cofinancing  among  various  development \npartners to leverage resources and complement each other\u2019s strengths. Scarce public sector \nresources are leveraged through a mechanism that combines ADB\u2019s guarantee instruments with \nMIGA\u2019s risk insurance, and allows to crowd in the private sector underwriters in transactions that \nnormally could not be considered on a stand-alone basis. Through ADB\u2019s commitment of $15 \nmillion equivalent in total for the AIGF and Supplemental PRG Facility, an additional $15 million - \n45 million may be mobilized from both public and private sector sources to catalyze private \nsector investment in a challenging investment environment. Moreover, the Project generates real \nsynergies by combining ADB\u2019s and MIGA\u2019s different guarantee products, to offer a range of \nclient solutions that a single agency could not provide. The Project demonstrates the innovative \nand flexible application of ADB\u2019s guarantee and cofinancing instruments. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n \n33.  The total project costs and financing requirements are estimated at about $60 million, \ncomprising about $10 million for capitalizing the AIGF, and up to $50 million in guarantee \noperations. Project costs are expected to be mainly in foreign currency.  \n Cost Estimates, by Component and Funding Sources  \nComponent and Funding Source  Amount   Percentage \n($ million) \nAIGF     \n  ADB  5.0  8.3 \n  IDA  5.0  8.3 \n  Bilaterala     \nGuarantee/PRI Support     \n  ADB  10.0  16.7 \n  MIGA  10.0  16.7 \n  Private PRI Market *  30.0  50.0 \nTotal  60.0  100.0 \n        a  Under discussion. If confirmed, financing percentages will be adjusted. \n         Source: Staff estimates. \n \nE.  Financing Plan  \n \n34.  $5 million Asian Development Fund Lending. The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan has \nrequested a loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 3.43 million \n($5 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for funding the AIGF. The loan will \nhave a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years; with an interest charge at the rate \nof 1.0% per annum throughout the term of the loan; and such other terms and conditions as set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement. The remainder of funding for the AIGF is to be provided under \nparallel cofinancing arrangements from IDA and bilateral sources.  \n   ", " 10\n \n35.  Special Loan Terms. In view of the extraordinary challenges to cope with the continued \npostconflict situation, Afghanistan has requested for enhanced concessionality in funding the \ntransition  and  reconstruction  phase.  This  request  is  supported  by  recent  analysis  of  debt \nsustainability by ADB and the International Monetary Fund, which concludes that funding for \ndevelopment projects should be on a grant basis, or on highly concessional terms for key \nprojects and reforms for which no grant funding can be mobilized. Afghanistan is expected to be \neligible  for  grant  funding  under  the  recently  concluded  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  IX \nreplenishment. This will result in softer the lending terms for Afghanistan. Until such time that \nADF  IX  becomes  effective  in  2005,  grandfathering  of  the  pre-1999  ADF  lending  terms  as \ndescribed  in  para.  34  is  proposed,  similar  to  the  terms  for  other  projects  approved  for \nAfghanistan since lending operations were resumed in late 2002. \n \n36.  $10 million Political Risk Guarantee Facility. In addition, Afghanistan has requested \nADB to provide up to an aggregate of $10 million equivalent of PRG cover without sovereign \nguarantee, to complement the loan for funding the AIGF and match the $10 million commitment \nby MIGA to the Project.11 The Supplemental PRG Facility will be available during the life of the \nAIGF. Pricing for the PRGs issued under the Facility will be market-based in accordance with \npricing established by MIGA on a project-by-project basis (para. 53), and will not involve the \nGovernment. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n37.  Executing Agency. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency for the \nAIGF and the ADF loan. MOF\u2019s role will be limited to one of oversight and accountability for the \nutilization of the loan funds, based on information provided by MIGA. \n \n38.  Implementing Agency. MIGA will be the Implementing Agency for the Project, including \nthe AIGF and Supplemental PRG Facility, and will be responsible for the operational aspects of \nproject implementation. MIGA issues guarantees to eligible investors on behalf of the AIGF and \nitself12, and coordinates with ADB as well as other commercial PRI providers for guarantees \nissued through the use of MIGA\u2019s CUP. MIGA will take the lead in underwriting, administration, \nand claims management while keeping all providers of coverage (including ADB) fully apprised \nof its activities in these areas. MIGA will also establish contacts with potential investors and \npromote the Project. In doing so, MIGA will liaise closely with AISA, and recruit a consultant for a \n2-year period to train local staff at AISA to market the Project and initially process guarantee \napplications received from potential investors.  \n \n39.  MIGA will draw on its vast experience in guarantee operations and with similar projects in \nother postconflict countries. Since the start of its operations in 1988, MIGA has issued more than \n600 guarantees covering about $11.7 billion in investments. MIGA has also introduced a variety \nof innovative schemes that have encouraged public-private partnerships and the issuance of \nguarantees in conflict-torn areas, such as its CUP and Trust Fund in Bosnia-Herzegovina. To \ndate, MIGA has had only one claim in its 16 years of operation (for which a full recovery was \n                                                 \n11 These PRGs will be supplemental \u201csecond loss\u201d coverage to the \u201cfirst loss\u201d coverage issued by the AIGF for each \ndiscrete investment or project to be covered. \n12  PRGs issued by MIGA on behalf of the AIGF will be in accordance with MIGA\u2019s convention, operational regulations, \nand other relevant policies, i.e., MIGA\u2019s regular underwriting procedures and methodologies will be applied for \nprospective projects, but will also take into account relevant ADB policies and guidelines. \n ", "    11 \nmade). This excellent claims experience is to a large part due to its cooperative ownership \nstructure; each member country owns part of the Agency and shares the cost of its losses. \nPartnering with MIGA will ensure professional project management to the highest standards, and \nallow ADB to benefit from MIGA\u2019s unique expertise in the PRI business and further develop its \nown capacity, in line with a Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation signed by ADB and \nMIGA in 2002. \n \n40.  ADB\u2019s  Role  and  Involvement  in  Implementation.  Once  all  documentation  and \nagreements have been finalized and the Project becomes effective, it is expected that ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement in the operational aspects of the AIGF will be limited but efficient with respect to \nADB staff resource utilization. Primarily, this will involve consultation with MIGA and reporting on \nutilization aspects of the AIGF, and processing of withdrawal applications from the ADF loan \naccount. With regard to the Supplemental PRG Facility, ADB will closely coordinate with MIGA \nand  will  be  provided  with  all  necessary  background  information,  such  as  fundamental \nunderwriting  procedures,  base  risk  analyses,  and  proposed  rate  ranges.  ADB  will  also  be \nadvised on an ongoing basis of the pipeline of prospective business, transactions proposed to be \nunderwritten, and conclusions MIGA arrives at with respect to the nature of political risk and \ncorresponding pricing. ADB\u2019s level of monitoring should provide it with an adequate opportunity \nto  double-check  eligibility  and  creditworthiness.  Familiarity  with  MIGA\u2019s  processes  and \nprocedures assures ADB that due diligence conducted on eligible customers will be comparable \nto that which would be undertaken by ADB. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n41.  The AIGF and ADB\u2019s Supplemental PRG Facility will have an availability period of 5 \nyears after effectiveness, during which PRGs can be issued, with possible extensions of up to 3 \nyears to be discussed at the end of year 5. If PRGs that have been issued are canceled, or \nexpire,  the  funds  released  could  be  used  in  a  revolving  manner  to  backstop  subsequent \nguarantees for the duration of the availability period. Therefore, the AIGF and Supplemental \nPRG Facility could, in principle, be used to support a multitude of transactions during this period. \nIndividual PRGs issued under the Project are expected to have a life of not more than 7 years. \nAssuming that the last guarantee is issued at the end of year 5 for a period of 7 years, the total \nimplementation period of the Project could extend to 12 years. \n \n3.  Procurement  \n \n42.  No Direct Procurement from Loan Proceeds During Implementation Period. During \nthe 5-year availability period of the loan, there will be no direct procurement of physical goods or \nservices from the loan; rather, the loan will be utilized for capital backing of PRGs issued by the \nAIGF (through MIGA) to guarantee investments and inputs by the guarantee holder.  \n \n43.  Proposed Exception to Procurement Restrictions for Guarantee Cover. Most of the \ninvestments to be supported through the Project are expected to come from ADB member \ncountries  and  involve  procurement  from  ADB  member  countries,  including  Afghanistan. \nHowever,  some  investments  or  procurement  may  come  from  non-ADB  member  countries, \nincluding the Middle East. For maximum development impact, investors typically will seek quality \ngoods and services at the most competitive prices. Explicit procurement restrictions on the \nguarantee cover may preclude investors from seeking the best business terms, and restrict \neconomic  efficiency  and  undermine  the  reconstruction  efforts  as  well  as  the  Project\u2019s \noverarching goal, including private sector development. To maximize the development impact \nand economic efficiency of the Project, and facilitate cooperation and risk-sharing arrangements \n   ", " 12\namong the various development agencies involved a streamlined and effective manner, it is \nproposed that guarantees issued under the Project be allowed to support transactions in which \nthe underlying investments will procure eligible goods and services (para. 28) from all countries, \nincluding non-ADB member countries,13 so long as such goods are not from an embargoed \ncountry. \n \n44.  Use of Loan Proceeds After Project Period and Guarantee Expiration. Any unused \nfunds remaining in the special account (para. 45) at the end of the project implementation period, \nor that become available as PRGs expire after the project implementation period, may be utilized \nby the Government for establishing a new guarantee facility, or for financing imports other than \nineligible items (as specified in Appendix 5) from ADB member countries and in accordance with \nADB policies and procurement guidelines. \n \n4.  Loan Disbursement Arrangements \n \n45.  Use of a Special Account. Prior to loan effectiveness, the Government will cause MIGA \nto establish a special account14 for the AIGF as agreed upon with IDA, MIGA, and ADB for \ndisbursement  of  the  loan  proceeds.  ADB  will  advance  funds  to  the  special  account,  with \ndrawdown based on guarantees issued by the AIGF. The special account will be operated by \nMIGA and will constitute a revolving fund, which will be replenished with premium income from \nguarantees issued under the AIGF as well as any recoveries made on payouts.  \n \n46.  The liquidity built up within the special account will be used solely for capital backing of \nguarantees issued by the AIGF in accordance with the Loan Agreement. Utilization of the AIGF \nfunds for payouts to guarantee holders will be in line with the AIGF documentation agreed with \nADB. The interest earned on the special account will accrue in the special account as additional \nreserve,  and  may  be  used  to  pay  loan  service  charges  to  ADB  and  IDA  as  well  as  any \nadministrative fees to MIGA. \n \n47.  Demand-Based  Disbursement  and  Withdrawal  Applications.  The  loan  will  be \nreleased to the special account based on the anticipated volume of guarantee cover to be \nprovided by the AIGF over the next 6 months. Subsequent disbursements to the special account \nwill be based on the utilization of the preceding disbursements as well anticipated volumes of \nguarantees. A withdrawal application by MOF (or by MIGA on behalf of MOF) will be submitted \nto  ADB  before  each  disbursement.  The  withdrawal  application  will  be  accompanied  by \nsupporting documents to demonstrate the use of the AIGF in accordance with the terms of the \nLoan Agreement, and will include a statement of outstanding guarantees under the AIGF. \n \n48.  Liquidation of Funds at the End of Project Period. Any amount not disbursed by ADB \nat the end of the project period will be canceled. Any positive balance left in the special account \nrelated to the ADB loan at the end of the project period, or that becomes available after the \nexpiry of outstanding guarantees, may be used to finance eligible imports from ADB member \ncountries (as described in para. 44 and in Appendix 5). \n \n                                                 \n13  This is pursuant to Article 14 (ix) of the ADB Charter, which provides that the Board may, by a vote of the Directors \nrepresenting not less two thirds of the total voting power of the members, determine to permit procurement from \nnon-ADB member countries in special circumstances making such procurement appropriate. This exception is only \nproposed to the current Project, and will not be applicable to other projects in Afghanistan or elsewhere, nor is this \nexception intended to set a precedent for future projects in Afghanistan or elsewhere.  \n14  Essentially, this will be a special account (for disbursement purposes) where moneys will be deposited so that the \nAIGF can issue guarantees. \n ", "    13 \n49.  To utilize the proceeds from the special account after the project period, the Borrower will \ncertify that the value of eligible imports from ADB member countries over an agreed upon period \nexceeds the procurement to be undertaken from the remaining proceeds in the special account, \nand that such procurement will be undertaken through normal commercial practices for the \nprivate sector or the Government\u2019s prescribed procurement procedures acceptable to ADB, with \ndue consideration to economy and efficiency. Such certificate will be submitted to ADB after the \nproject period but prior to closing date of the loan. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the \nloan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. If ADB determines that \nany proceeds have been used to fund ineligible items, the Government may be required to return \nthe amount of such payment used for ineligible expenditure. \n \n5.  Guarantee Arrangements \n \n50.  Legal Structure and Documentation. Both ADB and IDA will, respectively, enter into \nloan  agreements  with  the  Government  for  establishing  the  AIGF.  MIGA  will  enter  into  a \nframework agreement with the Government for management of the AIGF. This will address the \nestablishment and operation of the special account, administration of funds, handling of premium \nand  interest  revenues,  arrangements  with  other  lenders  and  risk  sharing  partners,  and \noperational rules and regulations. A participation agreement will be entered into by ADB and \nMIGA. The agreement will regulate, among others, the pari passu rule with regard to payments \nfor claims and distribution of premium amounts for PRGs issued. For each PRG issued by ADB \nunder the Supplemental PRG Facility, ADB will enter into an project specific agreement with \nMIGA  and  other  providers  of  political  risk  coverage  under  MIGA\u2019s  CUP.  The  contract  of \nguarantee  and  all  other  relevant  legal  documentation  will  reflect  and  covenant  the  various \nprovisions provided for guarantee operations in ADB\u2019s Operations Manual.15 \n \n51.  Underwriting Process. MIGA will assume the leading role with respect to structuring \nand undertaking the due diligence associated with issuing individual guarantees. MIGA will \nprocess all guarantees in accordance with its Underwriting Department Operational Procedures. \nThe flow chart in Appendix 6 summarizes the underwriting process. It typically takes 3-6 months \non average to process a guarantee. MIGA will undertake best efforts, however, to accelerate the \nprocessing time so that each transaction under the Project will take only about 2-3 months. \nMIGA board approval is required for all guarantees it approves on its account under the Project. \n \n52.  The PRGs under the Supplemental PRG Facility will be underwritten and issued on a \nproject-specific basis directly to the guarantee holders under MIGA\u2019s CUP. The PRGs will be \nissued in line with the proposed eligibility criteria (paras. 28 to 31) and exposure limits (para. 27) \nup to an aggregate amount of $10 million without the requirement for separate Board approval. \nThis follows the approach by ADB for other guarantee facilities approved by the Board in the \nrecent past16 as well as the approach applied by ADB for sector loans. MIGA will provide a \nproject summary to ADB, together with a standard \u201cconfirmation\u201d that, after due enquiry, it \nbelieves  that  the  issuance  of  the  PRG  complies  with  ADB\u2019s  Charter  and  policies  and \nrecommends that ADB participates in the CUP. ADB will review each PRG in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Operations Procedures and Operations Manual before it is issued.17  \n                                                 \n15 ADB.2003. Guarantee Operations. Operations Manual, Section D9. Manila. \n16 The facility approach, similar to a sector loan, was first approved by the Board in December 2000 for the Pakistan \nSmall and Medium Enterprise Trade Enhancement Facility Project (SMETEF) (Loan 1796-PAK), followed by the \nFinancial (Non-Bank) Markets and Governance Program (Loan 1956-PAK) and the Small and Medium Enterprises \nSector Development Program (Loan 2066-PAK).  \n17  ADB review may be streamlined, based on the substantive due diligence carried out by MIGA. MIGA will provide \nADB with all necessary background information (para. 40) to assure ADB that due diligence conducted by MIGA on \neligible customers will be comparable to that which would be undertaken by ADB. \n   ", " 14\n53.  Pricing. Pricing of guarantee fees will be based on an assessment of project-specific as \nwell as country risks. ADB will rely on MIGA\u2019s pricing model, which analyzes both country and \nproject-specific risks. ADB will adhere to the pricing MIGA proposes for each transaction, but \nreserves the right to modify transactional pricing in accordance with its own risk assessment and \nmarket pricing. MIGA is in the process of assigning Afghanistan its own country risk rating. From \ninitial analysis, MIGA has indicated that it may charge and average base rate of approximately \n150 basis points per annum, depending on the nature of the perceived risk and the type of \ncoverage  requested  by  the  guarantee  holder.  Pricing  will  vary  depending  on  the  type  and \namount of coverage a guarantee holder is requesting. Any front-end or standby fees applicable \nin connection with the PRGs issued under this Project will be reflected in an \u201call-in-one\u201d price \ndetermined by MIGA. The guarantee fee will be payable upfront by the guarantee holder within \n30 days from the time the contract of guarantee is executed. \n \n54.  Financial  Administration  of  Guarantee  Fees  and  Other  Payments.  MIGA  as \nImplementing Agency and administrator of the CUP will centralize all payment flows related as \nset forth in the CUP agreement. MIGA therefore collects all premiums payable by the guarantee \nholders and distributes ADB\u2019s share within 30 days after receipt of the premium payments. \nMIGA\u2019s contract of guarantee defines the contract period as 6 months or 1 year from the \neffective date for which a one-time premium is paid in advance for the duration of the contract \nperiod. In the event that a claim has been paid, any amounts recovered under the claim will be \nshared between MIGA and each of the participants under the CUP agreement in proportion to \nthe share of total compensation paid by each party under a given contract of guarantee. All \nparties to the CUP agreement will share the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in \npursuing salvage in proportion to the total compensation paid under a contract of guarantee. \n \n55.  Currencies and Foreign Exchange Risks. PRGs under the Project will normally be in \nUS dollars, but could be issued in other currencies, including local currency. ADB\u2019s maximum \nexposure  under  the  Supplemental  PRG  Facility  will  in  any  case  not  exceed  $10  million \nequivalent, and ADB will not assume any exchange risk. Any foreign exchange fluctuation for \nguarantees issued in currencies other than US dollars will be borne by the guarantee holder. \n \n56.  Loss Determination and Claims Management. A PRG issued under the Supplemental \nPRG Facility may be called by MIGA in case any guarantee payment is being made under the \nCUP. In such a case, ADB will disburse the required funds to MIGA (or the guarantee holder). \nMIGA will also have access to and control of the special account for the AIGF. The Government \nwill neither draw from the AIGF account nor have the authority to consent or place constraints on \nMIGA\u2019s ability to pay claims for the account. Filing for and management of claims will be in line \nwith the following procedure:  \n \n(i)  Cure period. To give the Government an opportunity to correct any policy-related \nactions or inactions that would trigger a claims payment, a 45-day cure period will \nbegin when MIGA is notified of a potential claim.  \n \n(ii)  Claims procedure. Upon expiration of the cure period, a guarantee holder will \nhave the right to file a claim if the problem has not been resolved satisfactorily. \nUpon receipt of a claim, MIGA will have 15 days to either (a) accept the claim and \nmake the required payment, or (b) reject the claim. If MIGA rejects a claim, the \nguarantee holder will have the right to initiate binding arbitration proceedings. \nMIGA would pay the claim if the arbitrator rules in favor of the guarantee holder. \nWhen MIGA is required to pay the claim, the AIGF and the other risk sharers, \nincluding ADB, will pay the claim with their respective resources. \n ", "    15 \n \n(iii)  Arbitration. If an event arises between MIGA and the guarantee holder as to \nwhether (a) government action or inaction should lead to a call of the guarantee, \nor (b) the Government has in fact corrected the initial problem, the guarantee \nholder has the right to initiate arbitration proceedings. The arbitration procedure \nwill stipulate among others that the arbitrator should be independent, appointed \naccording to UNCITRAL rules; and that the decision of the arbitrator will be final \nand binding. The losing party will bear the costs of arbitration.  \n \n57.  Risk Allocation and Market Collaboration. The actual risk sharing between the AIGF \nand others will be decided on a project-by-project basis. The aim is to support as many projects \nas possible and maximize market participation. The amounts to be used from the AIGF for each \nindividual project will be limited to $2 million, unless the Government otherwise agrees, along \nwith the other risk participants. \n \n58.  To maximize the leverage, the AIGF will be \u201cfirst-loss\u201d to ADB\u2019s PRG, MIGA and other \ncommercial insurers. This means that if a claim arises, the payment will come first from the AIGF \nuntil the money that has been allocated for an individual project from the AIGF has been \nexhausted, at which point ADB, MIGA and other co-insurers in a project will be pari passu liable \nfor additional claims.  \n \n59.  MIGA has been very successful in achieving risk sharing with other private and public \ninsurers  through  a  treaty  reinsurance  program,  whereby  a  pre-agreed  percentage  of  every \nproject is reinsured by MIGA\u2019s treaty. Risk sharing also occurs through facultative reinsurance, \nwhereby the reinsurance partners and amounts are decided on a project-by-project basis.  \n \n60.  Facultative reinsurance under this Project will be accomplished through the CUP. ADB, \nthrough its Office of Cofinancing Operations, may attract additional co-insurers to the Project. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n61.  The special account to be established for the AIGF will operate in accordance with \naccounting procedures acceptable to ADB, and will be administered by MIGA as agreed upon in \nthe relevant legal documentation. MIGA will maintain adequate documentation and records on \nthe PRGs issued and related flow of funds. Independent auditors acceptable to ADB will audit \nthe account in accordance with established auditing standards. Certified copies of the relevant \nfinancial statements, as appropriate, and the report of the auditors in English will be submitted to \nADB normally within 3 months, but not later than 6 months, after the end of each fiscal year. \nADB will reserve the right to cause inspection of accounts and relevant guarantee records and \ndocuments of the AIGF as required and appropriate.  \n \n62.  Each time it plans to issue a new PRG, MIGA will notify ADB and provide ADB with \nrelevant documentation. MIGA will also provide ADB and the Government with periodic progress \nreports  on  AIGF  utilization.  Such  reports  should  include  information  on  (i)  the  number  of \ntransactions and guarantee applicants, (ii) guarantee terms and conditions, (iii) and any other \nmatters relating to the AIGF and guarantees issued as requested by ADB. Periodic reports will \nalso  indicate  the  relevant  projects\u2019  status  and  evidence  of  compliance  with  applicable \nenvironmental regulations of the Government and of MIGA and ADB.  \n \n   ", " 16\n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n63.  ADB will review implementation of the Project at least annually, or more frequently if \nrequired, and will follow up on the periodic progress reports. If AIGF utilization does not meet \nexpectations,  ADB,  the  Government,  and  other  AIGF  partners  may  consider  measures  to \nenhance AIGF operations. \n \n64.  A comprehensive midterm review will be undertaken about 18 months after the Project\u2019s \ninception to review all aspects of implementation. This review will focus on (i) the performance of \nMIGA  as  implementing  agent;  (ii)  progress  in  guarantees  issued  and  adequacy  of \nimplementation arrangements, including compliance with guarantee holder eligibility criteria; (iii) \npolicy and administrative constraints in implementation; and (iv) initial impact. \n \n65.  Within  3  months  after  the  end  of  the  eligibility  period,  ADB  will  prepare  a  project \ncompletion report. \n \n8.  Compliance with ADB Safeguard Policies \u2013 Environment, Resettlement, and \nIndigenous Peoples \n \n66.  ADB safeguard policies and guidelines are applicable to the Project and will be adhered \nto. Consistent with other implementation aspects of this Project and for ease of administration, \nMIGA  will  assume  primary  responsibility  for  determining  and  monitoring  compliance  with \nsafeguard policies. ADB\u2019s Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD) has \nreviewed and compared ADB\u2019s and MIGA\u2019s environmental and social guidelines and concluded \nthat the policies are identical in substance, save for a few differences, primarily with regard to \nnotice  periods  for  environmental  impact  assessments  (EIAs)  (120  days  versus  60  days, \nrespectively). A summary of MIGA\u2019s environmental and social safeguard policies is in Appendix \n7. RSDD has concluded that it foresees very few, if any, instances in which there is likely to be a \nsignificant difference between MIGA\u2019s and ADB\u2019s conclusions. However, MIGA will agree to \nrelease a project sponsor\u2019s EIA at least 120 days before a guarantee is approved for Category A \nprojects as per ADB\u2019s requirements. MIGA will also share with ADB at an early stage18 of \nguarantee processing, the results of its environmental review.  \n \n67.  ADB will receive a copy of each of MIGA\u2019s clearances under the Project to be able to \nverify  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  guidelines.  If  there  is  a \nsignificant divergence of opinion between MIGA\u2019s and ADB\u2019s conclusions, ADB will retain the \nright not to participate in supporting the transaction in question.  \n \n68.  Both  the  AIGF  and  ADB\u2019s  Supplemental  PRG  Facility  are  classified  as  financial \nintermediary for the purpose of compliance with ADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguard \npolicies. ADB, together with MIGA, will establish an environment management system, which will \nbe documented in all relevant legal documentation to ensure adherence of guarantee holders to \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) as well as \nADB\u2019s  policies  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  Since  the  majority  of \nguarantees under the Project will be issued mostly to SMEs in the trade and light manufacturing \nsectors, it is highly unlikely that the Project could create detrimental impacts on the natural \nenvironment  and  indigenous  peoples  or  that  involuntary  resettlement  would  be  needed.  A \nsummary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy,  including  social  issues  assessment,  is  in \nAppendix 8. \n                                                 \n18 After the preliminary application and screening step, in accordance with MIGA\u2019s Project Cycle and Underwriting \nProcess. (Appendix 6). \n ", "    17 \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n \n69.  TA will be provided under the Project on a parallel basis as grant from bilateral sources \n(but not ADB) for implementation through MIGA. The TA will support promotion and marketing of \nthe Project, and assist to build up local expertise within relevant institutions such as AISA or the \nlocal chamber of commerce. Such local expertise can be used to set up a more permanent local \nstructure  for  insurance  activities  related  to  foreign  trade  and  investment  in  the  future. \nSpecifically, MIGA will recruit a consultant for a period of 2 years to (i) market the AIGF to \npotential foreign investors; (ii) identify and screen projects; (iii) assist MIGA to process guarantee \nproposals,  and  administer  and  monitor  contracts;  and  (iv)  train  AISA  staff  in  investment \npromotion and processing of guarantee operations, including environmental, social and legal \nassessments and relevant policies and guidelines to ensure compliance.  \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \n70.  The Project will yield a wide range of benefits across different levels: the macroeconomic \nlevel, the sector and policy level, the institutional level, and the investment and enterprise level.  \n \n71.  Macro-Benefits.  On  the  macro-level,  the  Project  will  support  economic  growth  by \nstimulating the local economy through new investments. The new investments will have positive \nimplications for the labor market through increased and sustainable employment opportunities, \nwhich in turn will contribute to poverty reduction. Increased tax revenues as a result of higher \neconomic activity can also lead to positive fiscal implications. Moreover, increased FDI has \npositive balance-of-payment implications and will support integration into the global marketplace. \nImportantly, by stimulating private sector development as an essential element for the country\u2019s \neconomic  progress  and  as  a  foundation  for  peace  and  stability,  the  Project  will  make  an \nimportant contribution to the ongoing rebuilding and reconstruction of Afghanistan. \n \n72.  Sector and Policy Benefits. On the sector level, the Project will support industrial \nproduction and development by improving productivity in manufacturing and services across a \nvariety of industry sub-sectors. The Project will assist in the transfer of modern technologies and \nbusiness practices to Afghanistan. The increased investment will further yield economic spill-\novers and contribute to the emergence of private input supply and output marketing channels \nand, by creating equal opportunities for all sectors in a nondiscriminatory manner, allow private \nmarkets to determine allocation for financing. Finally, it will enhance the credibility of Afghanistan \nas an investment destination with an open and transparent business climate characterized by \nthe rule of law. As Afghanistan is emerging from a postconflict situation and undertaking a fresh \nstart in many areas, this additional level of comfort will be particularly required to attract private \nsector investment early on.  \n \n73.  Institutional Benefits. Through parallel TA financing implemented by MIGA, the Project \nwill support capacity building for key agencies involved in investment promotion, including AISA \nand the local chambers of commerce. \n \n74.  Enterprise Benefits. Finally, on the enterprise level the Project will help industrial and \ncommercial enterprises establish links with foreign firms in order to restart or establish their \noperations, through joint ventures; upgrade production processes and product quality; facilitate \naccess  to  financing  for  increased investment;  and  import  critical  inputs  into  the  production \nprocess and economic activity. \n \n   ", " 18\n75.  Value added by ADB. ADB\u2019s participation in the Project addresses Afghanistan\u2019s lack of \ncredibility in the eyes of foreign investors and financial institutions. Currently, most public and \nprivate  institutions  are  not  prepared  to  provide  PRI  coverage  for  Afghanistan.  A  single \ninstitution\u2019s ability to assume risk is severely limited. Risk sharing with MIGA and other public \nand  private  insurers  is  imperative  to  catalyze  investment  in  a  significant  way.  Further,  the \nproposed funding from IDA and ADF to establish the AIGF will allow entities that insure on a \ncommercial  basis  to  efficiently  share  risks,  and  significantly  increase  PRI  capacity  in \nAfghanistan.  Thus,  ADB  genuinely  plays  a  catalytic  role  and  the  Project  has  considerable \ndemonstration effect. Given the significant risks and challenges facing potential investors, ADB \nwill serve as a catalyst in leveraging additional foreign private investment in Afghanistan. In \naddition, ADB offers effective support to Government participation in the Project.  \n \n76.  Development  Effectiveness  and  Impact  Measures.  ADB  will  measure  the \ndevelopment  outcome  at  project  and  subproject  levels  as  well  as  beyond  the  Project  by \nmonitoring certain performance measures for the duration of the Project. Such measures will be \nmonitored for indicative purposes, albeit the Project on its own may be considered only a \ncontributing factor among many other driving forces. Performance measures employed and \nmonitored beyond the Project at the sector level will include: \n(i)  growth in private FDI, \n(ii)  growth in commercial bank lending in the domestic banking sector, and  \n(iii)  improvement in the country\u2019s overall employment rates. \n \n77.  At project and subproject levels, the following performance measures will be taken into \naccount during monitoring: \n(i)  annual direct and indirect employment growth by subproject, \n(ii)  total value of investments and supplemental political risk coverage provided, \n(iii)  annual net profits of the subprojects, \n(iv)  upstream and downstream impacts of the Project, \n(v)  ongoing  access  to  debt  and  equity  (including  growth  in  retained  earnings) \nfinancing for expansion purposes, and \n(vi)  annual taxes paid. \n \n78.  Specific  performance  measures  may  also  be  adapted  for  individual  subprojects  as \nrelevant  and  useful  for  determining  overall  development  effectiveness  of  the  Project.  The \nProject\u2019s  development  effectiveness  is  monitored  through  consistent  and  standardized  data \ncollection over the life of the Project. \n \n79.  Project Risks and Mitigating Measures. The main risk is that private investors and \nlenders will not be induced to finance transactions despite the risk mitigation offered by the AIGF \nand the other risk participants such as MIGA and ADB, and the stated objectives of the Project \nmay thus not be achieved, due to the following:  \n \n(i)  Security  Risks.  The  security  situation  may  worsen  or  hostilities  may  resume. \nThough security remains an issue in parts of the country, the risk is a deterioration of \nsecurity in areas (including Kabul) that, from a security standpoint are currently \nconsidered acceptable to foreign investors. \n \n(ii)  Policy  Risks.  The  Government  may  lack  demonstrable  efforts  in  implementing \nnecessary reforms that are critical to foreign investors. In the case of the banking \nlaw, ratification of legislation took much longer than expected. The passing of this \n ", "    19 \nlaw should, however, have a very positive effect on FDI. Also, effective sanctioning, \nmonitoring, and legal systems are just emerging. Effective contract enforcement is \nessential  to  increase  private  sector  investment  and  political  risk  insurance  will \nenhance credibility for enforcement.  \n \n(iii)  Business Risks. Foreign investors may fail to identify commercial opportunities or \nlack access to commercial sources of debt financing, at both local and international \nlevels. Foreign banks may be reluctant to finance private investment into Afghanistan \nand local banks are not (yet) lending sufficiently to the private sector. Hence, some \nprojects may fail to materialize. However, the availability of PRI should encourage \nbanks to start lending to economically viable ventures.  \n \n80.  Another risk is that after successful launch of the Project, a large number of claims may \narise due to a breakdown of the political environment, or even a resumption of hostilities, and \nexpose ADB to losses under the Supplemental PRG Facility with limited potential for recovery. \nThis risk will be mitigated by ADB\u2019s and MIGA\u2019s right to suspend the issuance of guarantees.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n81.  Government Assurances. In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Private  sector  framework  agreement.  A  framework  agreement  between  the \nGovernment and ADB was signed on 25 June 2003. This letter agreement contains \ncertain assurances by the Government regarding ADB\u2019s commencement of private \nsector operations, including those involving the provision of guarantees, and will \nremain in effect throughout the project period. \n \n(ii)  No-objection letter. The Government has given a no-objection letter with regard to \nADB\u2019s Supplemental PRG Facility, and this acknowledgement will remain in effect \nthroughout the project period. \n \n82.   Cofinancing Assurances. ADB will satisfy itself with all terms and conditions of the \nother principal documents associated with the Project, including the participation agreement with \nMIGA, and MIGA\u2019s CUP guarantee documentation. The legal documentation signed by ADB and \nMIGA, and the guarantee holders will govern the relationships between and among the parties. \nSuch documentation will be entered into if ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approves the loan and the \nSupplemental PRG Facility. All agreements will be on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB \nand will list all conditions precedent to the proposed loan and guarantee agreements, which \ninclude, among others the following: (a) compliance with MIGA\u2019s and ADB\u2019s environmental and \nsocial  safeguard  policies  and  guidelines  will  be  ensured;  (b)  appropriate  arrangements, \nsatisfactory  and  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  be  made  to  finance  the  AIGF\u2019s  administrative, \nconsulting, and implementation costs; (c) there will be evidence acceptable to ADB that the \nBorrower and MIGA have established satisfactory and acceptable financial management and \naccounting arrangements and environment management systems for the Project; and (d) ADB \nmay require other conditions in accordance with prudent commercial practice. \n \n \n   ", " 20\nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n83.  The following conditions for loan effectiveness have been incorporated into the loan \nagreements: \n \n(i)  The Government and MIGA will have signed a framework agreement in a form \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  whereby  the  parties  agree  that  MIGA  will  act  as  the \nGovernment\u2019s implementing agent in administering the AIGF.  \n \n(ii)  The Government will have established a special account for the AIGF as agreed \nupon by IDA, MIGA, and ADB for disbursement of the loan proceeds. \n \nC.  Condition Guarantee Effectiveness \n \n84.  As a condition for effectiveness of the PRG Supplemental Facility, ADB and MIGA will \nhave signed a participation agreement, in a form satisfactory to ADB, whereby the parties agree \nthat MIGA will act as implementation agent in administering the PRGs issued under the Project. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n85.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and guarantee would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 3,430,000 to \nthe  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  the  Afghanistan  Investment  Guarantee \nFacility Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the \nrate of 1.0% per annum; a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board;  \n \n(ii)  in  respect  of  such  loan,  a  variation  from  the  existing  loan  terms  under  ADF \nresources on an exceptional basis;  \n \n(iii)  the Supplemental PRG Facility for a principal amount not exceeding the equivalent \nof $10,000,000 in favor of direct investors (without sovereign counterguarantee), on \nsuch terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthis Report; and \n \n(iv)  the proposal set out in para. 43 of this Report that PRGs issued by the AIGF or \ndirectly  by  ADB  for  investments  in  Afghanistan  covering  goods  and  services \nprocured from non-ADB member countries be eligible for guarantees under the \nProject. If the requisite affirmative vote of Directors representing not less than two \nthirds of the total voting power of ADB members, pursuant to Article 14 (ix) of the \nArticles  of  Agreement,  is  not  obtained  and  the  Board  approves  the \nrecommendations in (i), (ii) and (iii) only, then only PRGs that cover goods and \nservices  from  ADB  member  countries  will  be  eligible  for  guarantee  under  the \nProject. \n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n26 August 2004 \n ", "Appendix 1  21\n1.SECTOR ANALYSIS \nKEY ISSUES FOR TRADE, INVESTMENT, AND PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT  \nIN AFGHANISTAN1 \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  Private  sector-led  development  is  the  key  to  Afghanistan's  longer-term  economic \nsustainability and poverty reduction. Concerted efforts will be required to create a suitable \nenabling environment for the private sector and to push forward with public sector reforms that \nredefine the State as the regulator of the private sector and not a competitor. The goal is a \ndynamic and well-regulated formal economy. \n \n2.  Trade, both within the region and more globally, will be a driving force in Afghanistan's \neconomy. At the recent Cancun trade meeting, Government representatives pledged to build a \nforeign  trade  regime  that  will  allow  Afghanistan  to  easily  pass  the  standards  required  for \naccession the World Trade Organization over the next few years. The Government is preparing \nor holding consultations on a wide ranging set of new laws, including those on trade in goods \nand  services,  and  economic  governance  including  bankruptcy,  competition,  and  land  use. \nAfghanistan has also joined the World Customs Organization, and on 15 September 2003 the \nGovernment approved new laws for central banking and regulations of all other banks. \n \n3.  The context for private sector development in Afghanistan is difficult, but nevertheless \nhas areas of strong potential. The following key features were considered in determining the \noverall focus of policies and the investment program. \n \n(i)  Afghanistan is a landlocked country, with porous borders and surrounded by \nneighbors with different trade and investment policies that are, in many cases, \nquite restrictive. \n(ii)  The Afghan economy is largely informal and undocumented, with the informal \neconomy including most importantly the illegal drug industry. \n(iii)  In  2000,  official  trade  flows  were  estimated  at  around  $600  million;  and \nundocumented flows were much higher. \n(iv)  Insecurity severely constrains the most productive private sector development \nand channels it into shorter-term activities. \n(v)  Infrastructure constraints, both national and within the region, undermine the cost \nefficiency of both trade and transit and thereby hurt private sector production. \n(vi)  Afghanistan is an agriculture-based economy whose growth is constrained by \ntransport,  marketing,  quality  guarantee  issues,  and  standardization  and \npackaging. \n(vii)  Afghanistan's rich underground resources are underexploited, and large-scale \nindustry is still in its infancy. \n(viii)  Afghanistan's labor market is already highly integrated into the regional economy, \nas a result of the large numbers of refugees and economic migrants. \n(ix)  Lack of banking and insurance services undermines the formal economy. \n                                                 \n1  Excerpted from Government of Afghanistan. 2004.

Afghanistan has all along been a strong trading nation, but today, formal regional trade \nflows between Afghanistan and its neighbors are relatively small in absolute terms (Table A1.1). \nHowever, informal trade flows are large, particularly with Pakistan. \n \nTable A1.1: Regional Trade, 2002 \nItems            Afghanistan       Iran         Pakistan     Tajikistan      Turkmenistan  Uzbekistan \nExports \nRegion ($ million)  28             274           276    118      430     158 \nRest of World ($ million)  76       25,890        9,610    619   2,280   1,605 \nRegional Share (%)  27  1               3      16        16          9 \n    \nImports  \nRegion($ million)            284        468          240    195  136         101 \nRest of World ($ million) 2,396  21,640  10,998        525  1,683       2,124 \nRegional share (%)   11  2  2  27  7  5 \n \nTotal \nRegion ($ million)        312  742  516       313  566  59 \nRest of World ($ million) 2,472       47,530  20,608    1,144  3,964  3,729 \nRegional share (%)            11  2  2  21  12  6 \nSource: International Monetary Fund.2002;  Direction of Trade Statistics. Washington, DC. \n \n5.  Capitalizing on Afghanistan's position as a land bridge for trading within the region and \npromoting its wider integration in the formal global economy require both policy and institutional \nreforms to be rapidly put in place. To this end, the Government has established foreign trade \npolicies, which are applied uniformly throughout Afghanistan, and has signed new bilateral or \ntrilateral agreements with most of its neighbors. A new customs collection system is being put in \nplace, including the adoption of a simplified tariff law. A new customs code has been adopted, \nand the Government is planning to adopt new internationally - recognized customs declaration \nforms. The Customs Department has adopted a five- year plan for customs modernization. \n \n6.  International experience shows that economies that are positively integrated into the \nworld economy have achieved higher growth in incomes, longer life expectancy, and better \nschooling over the past two decades. Enhanced regional cooperation and participation in the \nmultilateral trading system are therefore important long-term objectives. The Government will \ncontinue to pursue efforts to increase the transparency and predictability of the trade regime, \nlimiting  the  use  of  nontariff  measures  to  legitimate  objectives  such  as  health,  safety,  or \nenvironmental reasons. \n \nB.  Key Constraints \n \n7.  To achieve sustained economic and reach GDP per capita of $500 by 2015, a number of \nserious constraints will need to be systematically overcome, including, the following: \n(i)  Inadequate security; \n(ii)  weak  human  resources,  on  which  the  long  period  of  conflict  has  taken  an \nenormous toll; \n(iii)  the inherited policy regime whereby public enterprises crowded out the private \nsector in the formal economy; \n ", "Appendix 1  23\n(iv)  a  poor  understanding  in  parts  of  the  Government  of  the  benefits  of  market \nintegration and trade; \n(v)  weak infrastructure and trade administration; \n(vi)  a poorly diversified economy (including agriculture) and consequent poor trading \nposition; and \n(vii)  lack of banking, insurance, and other trade facilitation services. \n \nC.  Government Vision and Strategy \n \n8.  The  Government's  National  Development  Framework  (NDF),  promulgated  in  2002, \nexplicitly identifies the private sector as the engine of growth, and views the administrative \napparatus of Government as an enabler and facilitator of private sector development. Central \nthemes of the NDF include adopting an open trade regime with low and predictable tariffs and \ncustoms  procedures  that  are  in  harmony  with  international  standards;  instituting  a \nmarket-determined,  unified  exchange  rate;  establishing  modern  banking  laws;  building  an \nenabling environment for investment that will successfully attract private and public capital for \ntrade-related  infrastructure;  and  formulating  measures  to  prevent  corruption.  Considerable \nprogress has been made with implementation in some of these areas. \n \n9.  More generally, a strategy of openness to international trade combined with a strong \nenabling environment for the private sector is seen as the best path for exploiting opportunities \nfor private investment and economic growth in the longer term. The overall objective is to \nharness the economic potential of Afghanistan and all of its citizens, to maximize the growth of \nthe  formal  economy  through  better  policies  and  trade  facilitation,  including  a  secure  and \nconducive environment for domestic and international investment. To this end the Government \nwill  create  an  attractive  business  environment  for  both  domestic  and  foreign  traders  and \ninvestors by establishing a predictable legal framework for business; providing the necessary \ninstitutional, legal, and physical infrastructure; facilitating their activities through a simple and \ntransparent regulatory mechanism; and promoting trade, investment, and local business. \n \n10.  Specific directions and areas of engagement for private sector policies are summarized \nas follows: \n \n(i)  Encouraging legitimate businesses in the formal sector. In the absence of a \nstrong formal sector, people seeking employment as well as entrepreneurs are \ndrawn toward a wide variety of illicit and criminal activities to find a means of \nlivelihood. It is therefore critical to provide an enabling environment for expansion \nof  the  formal  sector\u2014legitimate  private  enterprises  that  offer  employment \nopportunities. \n \n(ii)  From comparative advantage to competitive advantage. Afghanistan needs to \nfurther  exploit  its  comparative  advantage  in  areas  like  horticulture, \nagriculture-based  and  labor-intensive  products  such  as  carpets,  mineral \nresources, etc. But over the medium to longer term, it will be vital for Afghanistan \nto develop a more dynamic competitive advantage based on its location, an \nincreasingly  skilled  and  educated  labor  force,  its  entrepreneurial  dynamism \n(channeled into the formal sector), and regional business networks. \n \n(iii)  Good governance. The enabling environment for the private sector depends \ncritically on good governance and the absence of corruption.  \n   ", "24 Appendix 1 \n \n(iv)  Encouraging business development. The strong revival of the economy and \nthe reconstruction program itself provide great opportunities for the development \nof the Afghan formal private sector in activities that provide substantial value \naddition and employment. This revival needs to be facilitated by proactive efforts \nat private sector capacity building, development of business support services, and \nthe like. \n \n(v)  Industrial clusters. While it may not be possible to provide high-quality industrial \ninfrastructure across the country, that can be done for special industry clusters or \nindustry development areas, which should be privately managed on a commercial \nbasis. \n \n(vi)  Political risk insurance. Larger foreign companies find it difficult to invest in \nAfghanistan because of the real or perceived insecurity of their investments. The \nGovernment  has  received  bilateral  support  for  investment  insurance  and  is \nlooking for additional bilateral and multilateral support for its instruments.  \n \n(vii)  Equity. In many areas, women are a driving force in economic growth, and this \nhas a direct impact on the social and economic status of the household. Thus, \nfacilitating  women\u2019s  participation  in  economic  activity  is  of  very  high  priority. \nRegional equity and social inclusion also are critical.  \n \nD.  Sector Priorities for Private Development \n \n11.  The Government, while not singling out individual industries for special support, will \nprioritize  interventions  that  have  maximum  impact  on  private  sector  economic  activity  and \nemployment overall. Priority sectors from this perspective include agriculture, transportation, \nenergy, housing, communications, banking and financial services, and, over a longer time frame, \ntourism. \n \n(i)  Agriculture.  Since  the  vast  majority  of  the  Afghan  population  depend  on \nagriculture for survival, it is necessary to give a high priority to revival of this \nsector.  Typically,  while  the  Government  can  support  provision  of  inputs  and \nadvice on a macro level, as well as key investments in irrigation infrastructure, the \nprivate  sector  can  provide  inputs  such  as  seeds,  fertilizers;  minor  irrigation \nfacilities;  post-harvest  support  in  marketing  output;  and  income  stabilization \nthrough crop insurance. The private sector can also promote dairy farming and \nanimal husbandry. \n \n(ii)  Transportation. Transport infrastructure - such as roads, railways, and airports - \ninvolves large capital intensive projects with long payback periods. Based on \npublic investments in such sectors, private provision of transport services will be \nfurther stimulated and can flourish with commercial management of infrastructure \nassets and adequate cost recovery.  \n \n(iii)  Mining.  The  potential  for  mining  in  Afghanistan  is  considerable.  To  expand \nextraction, the Government will rehabilitate some existing mines, but will put the \nmain emphasis on attracting new private sector investment. The Government will \nadopt appropriate policies and programs to stimulate private sector investment, \n ", "Appendix 1  25\nrather than make new direct Government investment in mining. Emphasis will \nalso be placed on those subsectors that can show results quickly. \n(iv)  Energy. Afghanistan is rich in primary energy resources such as coal and natural \ngas, and has significant hydropower resources. Options for the effective utilization \nof both solar and wind power may also be profitable over the medium term. The \nprivate sector could assist in developing these resources as well as the bulk \nimport, storage, and distribution of petroleum products. This activity is projected \nto increase sharply in the future. \n(v)  Housing and construction. Large public works, such as highways and bridges, \nare being constructed by the Government through contracting private firms, but \nreconstruction of homes and workplaces remains a private activity. To enhance \nindividual efforts, the availability and quality of construction materials\u2014 most of \nwhich are imported from neighboring countries\u2014 should be steadily improved and \nprices reduced. Domestic production should increase, and while it is relatively \nsimple  for  aggregate  and  bricks  to  be  produced  by  the  unorganized  sector, \nproduction of good-quality, reasonably priced cement and its distribution need to \nbe in the formal sector. \n(vi)  Communications.  Afghanistan  has  a  difficult  terrain  and  hence  fixed \ncommunications make sense only within and between urban conglomerations. \nLow-cost  mobile  communications  technology  provided  by  the  private  sector \nmeets the needs of the situation and is flourishing. \n(vii)  Banking arid financial services. The private sector must be supported largely \nthrough local capital, channeled by way of banks and the capital market into \nproductive investments. Banking is clearly a priority for private sector investment, \nsubject  to  appropriate  regulation  and  prudential  supervision.  The  need  for \nappropriate regulation and prudential supervision cannot be overstated if local \nintermediation is not to result in large capital outflows at a critical juncture in the \ndevelopment process.  \n(viii)  Tourism. Afghanistan is a land of stark beauty and important historical sites, of \nwide open spaces and hospitable people. Hence tourism, including eco-tourism \nand  adventure  tourism,  has  great  potential  over  the  longer  term.  Tourism  is \nexpected to provide greater employment and thus reduce poverty. Development \nin this sector is crucially dependent on security and, over time, adequate tourism \ninfrastructure.  Importantly,  the  early  preservation  and  enhancement  of \nAfghanistan's cultural heritage is essential to guarantee tourism over the longer \nterm, even if revenues from tourism will not be mobilized for some time.  \n \nE.  Investment Program \n \n12.  To achieve the critically important objectives of the trade and investment program, and to \nprovide a conducive enabling framework for the private sector, the Government has structured \nits future investments around five core investment themes (program areas): \n \n1.  Trade, Investment, and Private Sector Development Policy \n \n13.  This program area will focus on developing appropriate policies for trade, investment and \nprivate sector (TIPS) development in Afghanistan. The Government has defined its role as the \npromoter of trade and investment by providing the enabling environment for activities to be \n   ", "26 Appendix 1 \ncarried  out  by  the  private  sector.  Government  reforms  are  geared  toward  achieving  a \ntransparent and simple trade and investment regime that integrates the global trade system \npremised on free and fair trade with all its partners.  \n \n2.  Administrative Reform and Restructuring \n \n14.  The  Government  is  undertaking  vital  administrative  reform  and  restructuring  of  key \nministries, their associated departments, associations, and state-owned enterprises. This will \nensure a clear institutional mandate, enhanced human resource development and administrative \ncapacity  and,  therefore,  improved  public  sector  management  capabilities  (policy,  provision, \nregulation,  operation,  and  maintenance),  with  both  public  and  private  incentives  linked  to \nperformance.  \n \n3.  Trade, Transit, and Transport Facilitation \n \n15.  This program area aims to enhance trade and transport competitiveness in Afghanistan \nby reducing logistical and other transit costs. It will implement the key policy recommendations \nfrom the trade and investment policy program area, and will provide analysis and feedback to \nthe other program components regarding evolving trade facilitation issues. This will be a vital \ninput to enhanced bilateral and multilateral trade discussions. Here, trade facilitation is defined \nas the process of removing obstacles to trade transactions and related logistics, at and behind \nthe borders.  \n \n4.  Infrastructure, Equipment, and Logistics \n \n16.  This  program  area  will  facilitate  the  provision  of  supporting  infrastructure  (including \ninformation and communications) for developing the overall trade and investment program. This \nincludes facilitating the improvement of, and further creation of, trade- related infrastructure such \nas industrial parks and access infrastructure (roads, airports, etc.). The Government will limit the \nprovision of infrastructure to bare essentials, while encouraging (wherever possible) further \nprovision through either public-private partnerships or entirely by the private sector. \n \n5.  Direct Support to the Private Sector \n \n17.  The  Government  will  provide  an  enabling  environment  to  support  and  facilitate  the \ndevelopment of the private sector in Afghanistan, in particular by helping target private sector \nactivities that add value to the Afghan economy; assist in domestic business establishment and \nvalue addition, encourage legitimate business with a competitive advantage in local and global \nmarkets and which can be developed in industrial clusters. The focus is on developing specific \nmechanisms for public-private partnerships.  \n \nF.  Implementation and Capacity Building  \n \n18.  Although the financial resources required for the TIPS program are not extremely large, \nimplementation  will  be  challenging  because  of  the  institutional,  policy,  and  capacity \nrequirements. Thus policy design and implementation, institution-building, and capacity will be \ncritical. \n \n19.  A TIPS regime that is not harmonized across the various tiers of the public sector \nmanagement  structure will  lead  to  barriers  to  growth.  Accordingly,  provinces,  districts,  and \nmunicipal structures all play a role in the implementation of policies. To ensure sustainability, \n ", "Appendix 1  27\npublic policy dialogue with traders and the private sector will remain a modus operandi for \nimplementation.  \n \n20.  Building  central  ministry  and  provincial  capacities  will  be  an  important  factor  in  the \nsuccess  of  the  overall  program.  Institutional  reforms  will  follow  agreed-upon  public  sector \nmanagement reforms. Where interim capacity is required, it will be procured from the private \nsector through contracting. The Government envisages that TIPS will be executed by competent \ncivil servants and managers with appropriate skills and experience. The capacity of the private \nsector too will need to be enhanced through the enabling environment and technical support. It \nis recognized that public-private partnerships should start small and can be expanded as the \ncapacity of the local private sector builds up. \n \nG.  Conclusions \n \n21.  Overcoming  the  constraints  to  trade,  investment,  and  more  generally  private  sector \ndevelopment can best be achieved through institutional capacity building for both public and \nprivate sectors; improving public sector management; formulating a sound enabling regulatory \nframework for businesses; developing banking and insurance services, including political risk \ninsurance; introducing standards, metrology testing, and quality certification services; training of \nlabor and skills enhancement; titling land; developing infrastructure for trade and investment; \nfacilitating trade, transit, and transport; and giving direct support to the private sector where \nappropriate. The Afghan private sector also needs to benefit more directly from the present \nreconstruction process, and efforts to create partnerships and consortiums need to be given \nhigh priority. \n \n22.

Introduction \n \n1.  The  Multilateral  Investment  Guarantee  Agency  (MIGA)  will  require  environmental \nassessment of proposed projects to ensure that it will provide guarantees only to projects that \nare environmentally sound and sustainable, and thus to improve decision making. \n \n2.   Environmental assessment is a process whose breadth, depth, and type of analysis \ndepend  on  the  nature,  scale,  and  potential  environmental  impact  of  the  proposed  project. \nEnvironmental assessment evaluates a project's potential environmental risks and impacts in its \narea of influence2; identifies ways of improving project planning, design, and implementation by \npreventing,  minimizing,  mitigating,  or  compensating  for  adverse  environmental  impacts  and \nenhancing positive  impacts;  and  includes  the  process  of  mitigating and  managing  adverse \nenvironmental impacts throughout project implementation. MIGA will favor preventive measures \nover mitigatory or compensatory measures, whenever feasible. \n \n3.   Environmental assessment takes into account the natural environment (air, water, and \nland); human health and safety; and project-related social (involuntary resettlement, indigenous \npeoples,  and  cultural  property),  transboundary,  and  global  environmental  aspects3. \nEnvironmental assessment considers natural and social aspects in an integrated way. It also \ntakes into account the variations in project and country  conditions; the findings of country \nenvironmental  studies;  national  environmental  action  plans  and  the  country's  overall  policy \nframework and national legislation; the project sponsor's capabilities related to the environment \nand social aspects; and obligations of the country under international environmental treaties and \nagreements as these are relevant to the project. MIGA will not issue guarantees to projects that \nwould contravene such country obligations as identified during the environmental assessment. \nEnvironmental assessment should be initiated as early as possible in the sponsor's project \ndevelopment process, and is integrated closely with the economic, financial, institutional, social, \nand technical analyses of a proposed project. \n \n4.  The applicant is responsible for carrying out the environmental assessment, unless the \napplicant is a lender or minority partner in the project (less than a 50%and noncontrolling \ninterest in the project). If a lender or minority partner, the applicant will be required to provide \nMIGA  with  a  copy  of  the  project  sponsor's  environmental  assessment  of  the  project,  and \nsupplemental information deemed necessary by MIGA in determining that the investment is \nenvironmentally sound and sustainable. For Category A projects4 the project sponsor should \nretain independent environmental assessment experts not affiliated with the project to carry out \nthe environmental assessment to avoid a potential conflict of interest. For Category A projects \nthat are highly risky, or contentious, or that involve serious and multidimensional environmental \nconcerns, the project sponsor should normally also engage an advisory panel5 of independent, \n                                                 \n1  In accordance with MIGA's Convention, this policy is Annex B to MIGA's Operational Regulations. \n2  The area of influence for any project is determined with the advice of environmental specialists and set out in the \nenvironmental assessment's terms of reference.  \n3  Global environmental issues include climate change, ozone-depleting substances, pollution of international waters, \nand adverse impacts on biodiversity.  \n4  For screening, see para. 8.  \n5  The panel advises the project sponsor on the following aspects as appropriate: (i) the terms of reference for the \nenvironmental  assessment  (ii)  key  issues  and  methods  for  preparing  the  environmental  assessment  (iii) \nrecommendations  and  findings  of  the  environmental  assessment;  (iv)  implementation  of  the  environmental \nassessment's recommendations (v) development of environmental management capacity and (vi) engineering \nmatters such as dam safety. \n   ", "36 Appendix 7 \n \ninternationally  recognized  environmental  specialists  to  advise  on  all  aspects  of  the  project \nrelevant to the environmental assessment. The role of the advisory panel depends on the \ndegree to which project implementation has progressed, and on the extent and quality of the \nenvironmental assessment already completed at the time MIGA begins to consider the issuance \nof a guarantee for the project. If the environmental assessment for a Category A project has \nbeen completed by the project sponsor with in-house expertise before the time MIGA considers \nthe issuance of a guarantee for the project, independent expertise must be engaged to review \nthe environmental assessment for potentially significant problems in the analysis due to the \npotential conflict of interest. \n \n5.  MIGA  will  advise  the  applicant  on  MIGA's  environmental  assessment  requirements. \nMIGA  will  review  the  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  environmental  assessment  to \ndetermine whether they provide an adequate basis for a decision to offer a guarantee. When the \nproject sponsor has completed or partially completed environmental assessment prior to MIGA's \ninvolvement  in  a  project,  MIGA  will  review  the  environmental  assessment  findings  and \nrecommendations as provided by the applicant to ensure their consistency with this policy. To be \nable to make that determination, MIGA may require additional environmental assessment work, \nincluding public consultation and disclosure. \n \n6.  The Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook describes pollution prevention and \nabatement measures and emission levels that are normally acceptable to MIGA. However, \ntaking into account country legislation and local conditions, the environmental assessment report \nmay  recommend  alternative  emission  levels  and  approaches  to  pollution  prevention  and \nabatement for the project. The sponsor's environmental assessment report must provide full and \ndetailed justification for the levels and approaches chosen for the particular project or site. All \nalternatives to emission levels will be presented by MIGA staff to the Board for review and \nconcurrence. \n \nB.  Environmental Assessment Instruments \n \n7.  Depending  on  the  project,  different  instruments  can  be  used  to  satisfy  MIGA's \nenvironmental assessment requirements. These may include environmental impact assessment \n(EIA), environmental audit, hazard or environmental risk assessment, and an environmental \naction plan. Environmental assessment applies one or more of these instruments, or elements of \nthem, as appropriate.6  \n \nC.  Environmental Screening \n \n8.  MIGA  will  undertake  environmental  screening  of  each  investment  to  determine  the \nappropriate  extent  and  type  of  environmental  assessment  required.  MIGA  will  classify  the \nproposed investment into one of three categories depending on the type, location, sensitivity, \nand scale of the project; and the nature and magnitude of its potential environmental impacts. \n \n(i)   Category A. A proposed investment will be classified as Category A if the project \nis likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts that are sensitive7, \ndiverse, or unprecedented. These impacts may affect an area broader than the \n                                                 \n6  The objective of all these instruments is to provide MIGA with a (i) clear understanding of the sponsor's approach to \nenvironmental mitigation and management, and (ii) the basis for requiring specific actions as conditions for a \nguarantee. \n7  A potential impact is considered \"sensitive\" if it is irreversible (e.g., lead to loss of a major natural habitat), adversely \naffects indigenous peoples, involves involuntary resettlement, or adversely affects significant cultural property. \n ", "    Appendix 7  37\nsites  or  facilities  subject  to  physical  works.  Environmental  assessment  for  a \nCategory  A  project  examines  the  project's  potential  negative  and  positive \nenvironmental  impacts;  compares  them  with  those  of  feasible  alternatives \n(including the \"without project\" situation); and recommends any measures needed \nto prevent, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse impacts and improve \nenvironmental performance. For a Category A project, the project sponsor is \nresponsible  for  preparing  a  report,  normally  an  EIA  report,  that  includes,  as \nnecessary, elements of other instruments referred to in para. 7. \n \n(ii)   Category  B.  A  proposed  investment  will  be  classified  as  Category  B  if  the \nproject's  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  on  human  populations  or \nenvironmentally important areas (e.g., wetlands, forests, grasslands, and other \nnatural habitats) are less adverse than those of Category A projects. These \nimpacts  are  site-specific;  few,  if  any,  are  irreversible;  and,  in  most  cases, \nmitigatory measures can be designed more readily than for Category A projects. \nThe scope of environmental assessment for a Category B project may vary from \nproject to project8, but it is narrower than for of a Category A project. It examines \nthe  project's  potential  negative  and  positive  environmental  impacts  and \nrecommends  any  measures  needed  to  prevent,  minimize,  mitigate,  or \ncompensate for adverse impacts and improve environmental performance. \n \n(iii)   Category C. A proposed investment will be classified as Category C if the project \nis likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts. Beyond screening, \nno further environmental assessment action is required for a Category C project. \n \nD.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n \n9.  For all Category A projects9 during the environmental assessment process, MIGA will \nrequire the project sponsor to consult, or to have consulted, project-affected groups and local \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) about the project's environmental impacts, and to take \ntheir views into account. The project sponsor should initiate such consultations as early as \npossible, and consult with such groups throughout project implementation, as necessary, to \naddress project-related environmental and social issues that affect them. In cases where the \napplicant is not a majority partner in the project (i.e., less than a 50% and noncontrolling interest \nin the project), MIGA will request the applicant to provide information on appropriate steps taken \nby the project sponsor to achieve meaningful local consultation and disclosure. \n \n10.  For meaningful consultations between the project sponsor and project-affected groups \nand local NGOs on all Category A projects, the project sponsor provides relevant material in a \ntimely manner in a form and language that are understandable and accessible to the groups \nbeing consulted. \n \n                                                 \n8  When the screening process determines, or national legislation requires, that any of the environmental issues \nidentified warrant special attention, the findings and results of Category B environmental assessment may be set \nout in a separate report. Depending on the type of project and the nature and magnitude of the impacts, this report \nmay include, for example, a limited environmental impact assessment, an environmental mitigation or action plan, \nan environmental audit, or a hazard assessment. For Category B projects that are not in an environmentally \nsensitive area and that present well-defined and well-understood issues of narrow scope, MIGA may accept \nalternative approaches for meeting environmental assessment requirements: for example, environmentally sound \ndesign criteria, setting criteria, construction standards, or pollution limits.  \n9  Consultations with affected parties also are required by other safeguard policies regarding involuntary resettlement  \nof indigenous peoples for projects with potentially major adverse social impacts.  \n   ", "38 Appendix 7 \n \n11.  The applicant will be required to disclose locally, in an appropriate manner, the EIA \nreport for Category A projects. Specific requirements for MIGA's disclosure of environmental \ninformation are contained in MIGA's disclosure policy.10 If a project sponsor objects to MIGA's \nrelease of environmental information through the World Bank InfoShop, MIGA will not issue a \nguarantee. \n \n12.  In cases where the Category A environmental assessment has been completed before \nMIGA's receipt of a definitive application, or the project is already approved and permitted in \naccordance with host country environmental laws and regulations, MIGA will ascertain whether \npublic consultation and disclosure have been adequate with respect to MIGA's requirements. If \nnecessary,  MIGA  and  the  applicant  will  agree  on  a  supplemental  public  consultation  and \ndisclosure program to address any deficiencies identified by MIGA. \n \nE.  Implementation \n \n13.  All MIGA guarantee contracts will require guarantee holders to operate throughout the \nguarantee  period  in  compliance  with  the  host  country's  laws  and  regulations,  including \nenvironmental laws and regulations, MIGA's environmental policies and guidelines, and any \nother  specific  requirements  by  MIGA  as  per  para.3.06  in  MIGA's  Operational  Regulations. \nCompliance  with  host  country  laws  and  regulations  normally  will  be  confirmed  through \nwarranties  and  representations  as  per  standard  insurance  industry  practice.  Compliance, \nespecially in the case of Category A projects, will be verified by MIGA through requested \nmonitoring reports, site visits, or other measures as necessary in addition to warranties and \nrepresentations. Failure by the guarantee holder to respond to these requests or to abide by \nsuch laws, regulations, or specific requirements gives MIGA the right to terminate the guarantee \nor to deny payment of a claim if the noncompliance is not corrected within a period set forth in \nthe Contract of Guarantee. \n \nF.  Definitions \n \n14.  Environmental action plan. An instrument which provides details of the measures to be \ntaken  during  the  implementation  and  operation  of  a  project  to  eliminate  or  offset  adverse \nenvironmental impacts or to reduce them to acceptable levels. Included are the actions needed \nto implement them. \n \n15.  Environmental  audit.  An  instrument  to  determine  the  nature  and  extent  of  all \nenvironmental  areas  of  concern  at  an  existing  facility.  The  audit  identifies  and  justifies \nappropriate measures to mitigate the areas of concern, estimates the cost of the measures, and \nrecommends  a  schedule  for  implementing  them.  For  certain  projects,  the  environmental \nassessment report may consist of an environmental audit alone; in other cases, the audit is part \nof the environmental assessment documentation. \n \n16.  Environmental impact assessment. An instrument to identify and assess the potential \nenvironmental impacts of a proposed project, evaluate alternatives, and design appropriate \nmitigation, management, and monitoring measures. An environmental action plan is an integral \npart of an EIA. \n \n17.  Environmental risk assessment. An instrument for estimating the probability of harm \noccurring  from  the  presence  of  dangerous  conditions  or  materials  at  an  installation.  Risk \n                                                 \n10  MIGA's environmental and social review procedures provide specific guidance on MIGA's requirements for local \nconsultation and disclosure activities by the project sponsor or applicant.  \n ", "    Appendix 7  39\nrepresents the likelihood and significance of a potential hazard being realized; therefore, hazard \nassessment often precedes an environmental risk assessment, or the two are conducted as one \nexercise. Environmental risk assessment is a flexible method of analysis, i.e., a systematic \napproach  to  organizing  and  analyzing  information  about  potentially  hazardous  activities  or \nsubstances  that  might  pose  risks  under  specified  conditions.  MIGA  routinely  requires  an \nenvironmental risk assessment for projects involvinghandling, storage, or disposal of hazardous \nmaterials and wastes in quantities above a specified threshold level; the construction of dams; or \nmajor construction works in locations vulnerable to seismic activity or other potentially damaging \nnatural events. For certain projects, the environmental assessment report may consist of the \nenvironmental risk assessment alone; in other cases, the environmental risk assessment is part \nof the environmental assessment documentation. \n \n18.  Hazard assessment. An instrument for identifying, analyzing, and controlling hazards \nassociated with the presence of dangerous materials and conditions at an installation. MIGA \nrequires a hazard assessment for projects involving certain inflammable, explosive, reactive, and \ntoxic materials when they are present at a site in quantities above a specified threshold level. \nFor  certain  projects,  the  environmental  assessment  report  may  consist  of  the  hazard \nassessment  alone;  in  other  cases,  the  hazard  assessment  is  part  of  the  environmental \nassessment documentation. \n \n19.  Project area of influence. The area likely to be affected by the project, including all its \nancillary aspects, such as power transmission corridors, pipelines, canals, tunnels, relocation \nand access roads, borrow and disposal areas, and construction camps, as well as unplanned \ndevelopments  induced  by  the  project  (e.g.,  spontaneous  settlement,  logging,  or  shifting \nagriculture along access roads). The area of influence may include (i) the watershed within \nwhich the project is located, including the affected estuary and coastal zone; (ii) off-site areas \nrequired for resettlement or compensatory tracts; (iii) the air shed (e.g., where airborne pollution \nsuch as smoke or dust may enter or leave the area of influence); (iv) migratory routes of \nhumans, wildlife, or fish, particularly where they relate to public health, economic activities, or \nenvironmental conservation; and (v) areas used for livelihood activities (hunting, fishing, grazing, \ngathering, agriculture, etc.) or religious or ceremonial purposes of a customary nature. \n \n   ", "40 Appendix 8 \n8 SUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY (SPRSS)  \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in the country poverty \n  No \n      No  partnership agreement?   \n  NA  \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Afghanistan:  \nThe proposed Project supports the Government\u2019s National Development Framework (NDF), which also serves as the \ncountry\u2019s poverty reduction strategy. Private sector development is explicitly stated as one of the NDF\u2019s three \ndevelopment pillars. Private sector activities are the main source of income and employment in Afghanistan. By \nimproving income-generating opportunities in the private sector through increased investment, the proposed Project \nwill contribute to poverty reduction and indirectly lead to improvement in a range of other social and economic \nindicators in Afghanistan. However, no separate country poverty partnership agreement has yet been concluded \nbetween ADB and the Government. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification:   Other \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nNo poverty assessment has been prepared and no poverty partnership agreement (PPA) has been signed. Initiating \nand completing work on the preparation of a PPA will be synchronized with the preparation of a full country strategy \nand program (CSP), presently scheduled for 2005. Background work for the full CSP, including data collection and \npreparation of sector road maps, was initiated last year. \nReliable statistics on poverty are not available for Afghanistan. However, various estimates place at 60\u201380% the \nproportion of the population living below the threshold of $1 a day or consuming less than the minimum requirement of \nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) of 2,453 kilocalories a day per capita.  \nThe average life expectancy is only about 40 years; nearly two thirds of adults, and four fifths of adult women are \nilliterate; 70% of the population are malnourished; and in 1999 less than one third of Afghan children were enrolled in \nschool. Particularly vulnerable are those without any source of food production, employment, or income. Nonmaterial \npoverty as reflected in physical and social insecurity; isolation; marginalization; alienation; and ethnic, religious, and \ngender discrimination pushes many Afghans further down the poverty ladder.  \nNo systematic study has been done on the factors contributing to poverty in Afghanistan, but available information \nsuggests that poverty is associated with low economic growth and the collapse of income-generating and employment \nopportunities due to the long period of war and civil strife, particularly in rural areas. Other factors likely pertain to the \ndistinctive features of the agro-ecological environment (e.g., frequent droughts), state of natural resource degradation, \nland ownership and tenure, loss of livestock and destruction of orchards, access to water and agricultural inputs, \navailability of off-farm employment opportunities, refugee/displacement status, gender, ethnicity, household status \n(e.g., with female head or not, educational attainment), and physical disability. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nStakeholder analysis prepared: \nStudies on private sector development in Afghanistan have been prepared by ADB, ADB Institute, World Bank, \nGovernment  of  Afghanistan  and  other  organizations.
