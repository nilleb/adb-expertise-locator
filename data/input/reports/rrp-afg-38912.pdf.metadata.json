The \nProject  will  be  structured  to  ensure  capital  backing  of  the  PRGs  and \nleverage  cofinancing  from  various  official  and  commercial  sources.  It \ncomprises two principal components: \n \n\n(i) \n\nthe  Afghanistan  Investment  Guarantee  Facility  (AIGF),  to  be \nthe  Government  of  Afghanistan  and \nestablished  by \nimplemented by the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency \n(MIGA)  with  funding  through  an  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  project  loan  ($5  million  equivalent)  and  other  official \nsources,  including  an  International  Development  Association \n(IDA)  credit  ($5  million  equivalent)  and  bilateral  grants \n(amounts yet to be confirmed), to cover the face value of the \nPRGs issued by the AIGF on a \u201cfirst loss\u201d basis; and \n \n\n(ii)  supplemental  PRG  cover  without  Government  counter-\nguarantee,  to  be  provided  by  ADB  (up  to  $10  million \nequivalent, through the Supplemental PRG Facility), MIGA (up \nto $10 million), and other public or private insurers (anticipated \nto  be  up  to  $30  million),  to  supplement  on  a  \u201csecond  loss\u201d \nbasis the cover issued by the AIGF.  \n\n \nInvestors may choose any combination of four types of risk coverage: \ntransfer  restriction,  expropriation,  war  and  civil  disturbance,  and \nbreach  of  contract.  PRG  coverage  is  targeted  at  investments  in  the \nsmall and medium enterprises sector, although larger projects can be \nconsidered  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  PRGs  issued  under  the  Project \nwill normally be for a period of not more than 7 years. \n \nTo  support  and  sustain \nthe  reconstruction  effort,  employment \ngeneration,  and  long-term  economic  growth  in  Afghanistan,  a  vibrant \nand  active  private  sector  is  needed.  The  Government  has  given  high \npriority  to  private  sector  promotion  in  its  development  agenda. \nHowever,  many  potential  investors  consider  political  risk  as  a  major \ninvestment impediment. Without insurance against selected political or \nnoncommercial risks for investment projects, many potential investors \nare reluctant to do business in Afghanistan and are taking a wait-and-\nsee attitude. Currently, only limited amounts of political risk insurance \n\nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\nObjectives \n \n\nCost Estimates and \nFinancing Plan \n \n\n(PRI)  are  available  worldwide  for  Afghanistan.  By  providing  an \neffective  vehicle  for  political  risk  mitigation,  private  sector  investment \ninto Afghanistan can be catalyzed. \n \nThe proposed Project seeks to assist Afghanistan in its reconstruction \nefforts  and  stimulate  growth  and  employment,  by  facilitating  foreign \ndirect investment through a risk mitigation facility that will address key \ninvestor concerns.  \n \nThe  cost  for  capitalizing  the  AIGF  is  estimated  at  about  $10  million. \nADB\u2019s  financing  contribution  to  the  AIGF  is  proposed  to  be  a  project \nloan of $5 million equivalent to match the amount that IDA will commit \nthrough \nto \nsupplemental PRG coverage without Government counterguarantee to \nabout  $60  million.  The  Supplemental  PRG  Facility  coverage  is \nproposed by ADB up to $10 million to match the amount that MIGA will \ncommit  under  the  Project.  Additional  resources  of  about  $30  million \nare  expected  to  be  mobilized  from  the  private  sector  or  other  official \nPRI  providers,  through  MIGA\u2019s  Co-operative  Underwriting  Program \n(CUP).   \n\nthe  Project.

The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  40  years,  including  a \ngrace  period  of  10  years;  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per \nannum;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft \nLoan Agreement.  \n \nThe Government will deposit the funds required to capitalize the AIGF \nin  a  special  account,  which  is  to  be  administered  by  MIGA.  For \nadministrative  ease,  ADB  may  directly  disburse  the  loan  proceeds  to \nthe  special  account,  following  withdrawal  applications  submitted  by \nMIGA  (on  behalf  of  the  Government)  and  based  on  the  pipeline  of \nprojects to be guaranteed.  \n \nThe loan is expected to become effective in September 2004, and to \nbe  available  for  withdrawals  for  a  period  of  5  years,  with  a  possible \nextension of up to 3 years based on actual demand.  \n\nAllocation and  \nDisbursements  \n \n\nUtilization Period \nand Project  \nCompletion Date \n\nExecuting Agency \n\nMinistry of Finance of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n \n\n \n\nProcurement  \n\n \n \n\n \n\nSupplemental PRG \nFacility  \n \n\niii \n\nfinancial \n\nreporting,  and \n\nThe  various  components  under  the  Project  will  be  administered  by \nMIGA,  which  will  act  as  the  Implementing  Agency  for  the  Project. \nMIGA  issues  guarantees  to  eligible  investors  on  behalf  of  the  AIGF \nand itself, and coordinates with ADB as well as with other commercial \nPRI providers for guarantees issued through the use of MIGA\u2019s CUP. \nMIGA  will  take  the  lead  in  underwriting,  administration,  and  claims \nmanagement while keeping all providers of coverage (including ADB) \nfully  apprised  of  its  activities  in  these  areas.  The  use  of  MIGA\u2019s \nunderwriting policies and methodologies will ensure that only projects \nthat are financially viable and have a positive development impact on \nAfghanistan  will  be  underwritten  under  the  Project.  MIGA  will  liaise \nwith  Afghanistan  Investment  Support  Agency  for  marketing  and \npromotion  of  the  Project,  and  with  the  Government  to  receive  host \ncountry approval before issuing any guarantees under the Project. \n \nThe  AIGF  will  be  managed  by  MIGA  in  line  with  administrative, \ninternal  control  measures \naccounting, \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Interest  earned  by  the  AIGF  on  the  special \naccount during the project period will be used to offset operating and \nfunding costs and build up reserves if claims have to be paid. Payouts \nfrom the special account to PRG holders will be based on valid claims \nas determined in the PRG documentation. \n \nDuring  the  project  implementation  period,  there  will  be  no  direct \nprocurement  of  physical  goods  and  services;  rather,  the  loan  will  be \nutilized to fund PRGs issued by the AIGF (through MIGA) to guarantee \ninvestments  and  imports  as  well  as  domestic  inputs  to  be  utilized  by \nthe  guarantee  holder.  Most  of  this  investment  or  procurement  is \nexpected to come from ADB member countries, including Afghanistan. \nHowever, some investment or procurement may come from non-ADB \nmember countries. It is proposed that guarantees issued by the AIGF \nand  under  the  Supplemental  PRG  Facility  be  allowed  to  support \ntransactions in which the underlying investment will procure goods and \nservices from all countries including non-ADB member countries. This \nis  to  support  the  Project\u2019s  goal,  to  enhance  economic  efficiency \nthrough  procurement  of  inputs  on  a  cost  effective  basis  and  thus \nenhance development impact.  \n \nAny  unused  funds  remaining  in  the special  account  at  the  end  of  the \nproject  implementation  period,  or  that  become  available  as  PRGs \nexpire  after  the  project  implementation  period,  may  be  utilized  by  the \nGovernment for establishing a new guarantee facility, or for financing \nimports other than ineligible items from ADB member countries and in \naccordance with ADB policies and Procurement Guidelines. \n \nAn  amount  of  up  to  $10  million  equivalent  of  PRGs  without \nGovernment  counterguarantee  and  with  backing  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital  resources  is  proposed  to  be  issued  under  the  Supplemental \nPRG  Facility.  PRGs  issued  by  ADB  under  the  Supplemental  PRG \nFacility  may  cover  various  forms  of  debt,  but  not  any  equity \ninvestments.  The  Supplemental  PRG  Facility  will  be  administered \n\n \n\n \n\n\fCofinancing \n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n \n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n \n\nto  match \n\n(about  $10  million  equivalent, \n\n(applications,  processing,  claims  management  and  so  on)  by  MIGA \nthrough  the  use  of  MIGA\u2019s  CUP,  together  with  guarantee  capacity \noffered by MIGA itself. Implementation details, including underwriting, \npricing,  and  claims  administration,  will  be  specified  in  a  Framework \nAgreement  for  the  AIGF  (between  Government  and  MIGA),  and  a \nParticipation  Agreement  (between  ADB  and  MIGA)  and  the  CUP \ndocumentation  for  the  Supplemental  PRG  Facility  (between  ADB, \nother insurers, and MIGA). Fees and charges for PRGs will be in line \nwith market practices and agreed upon by ADB and MIGA. \n \nParallel  loan  and  grant  cofinancing  is  expected  from  multilateral  and \nbilateral  sources  for  the  AIGF,  including  an  IDA  credit  (of  $5  million \nequivalent) and grant assistance (with amounts to be confirmed) from \nbilateral  sources.  The  grants  for  technical  assistance  will  be  sourced \nand implemented by MIGA. In addition, co-guarantees will be provided \nby  MIGA \nthe  ADB \ncommitment), as well as by private  or other official PRI providers (up \nto about $30 million). \n \nThe Project will yield a  wide range of benefits across different levels, \nincluding  the  macroeconomic  level,  the  sector  and  policy  levels,  the \ninstitutional  level,  and  the  investment  and  enterprise  levels.  The \nProject will stimulate the local economy, generate employment, create \ntax  revenues,  and  assist  in  the  transfer  of  modern  technologies  and \nbusiness  practices  from  abroad  to  Afghanistan.  It  is  designed  to \nstimulate private business activity and attract foreign direct investment \nin  a  variety  of  sectors,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  manufacturing, \nagribusiness, banking, and smaller scale infrastructure projects.  \n \nA key concern is that private investors and lenders will not be induced \nto finance transactions despite the risk mitigation offered by the AIGF \nand  other  risk  participants  such  as  MIGA  and  ADB.  The  main  risks \nrelate  to  security,  policy,  and  business  risks,  for  which  mitigation \nmeasures have been put in place as applicable. Security continues to \nbe  a  concern  for  investors,  and  if  the  security  situation  deteriorates \nsignificantly,  private  investors  may  choose  not  to  continue  with  plans \nto  invest  in  Afghanistan  despite  the  existence  of  the  Project.  Also, \neffective sanctioning, monitoring, and legal systems are just emerging, \nand  effective  contract  enforcement  has  yet  to  be  demonstrated. \nAnother  risk  is  that  after  an  initially  good  start,  a  large  number  of \nclaims  may  arise  due  to  a  breakdown  of  the  political  environment  or \neven  a  resumption  of  hostilities.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  ADB\u2019s \nand MIGA\u2019s right to suspend the issuance of guarantees.  \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan;  and  (ii)  a  proposed  political  risk  guarantee  (PRG) \nfacility  without  government  counterguarantee  (the  Supplemental  PRG  Facility),  for  the \nAfghanistan Investment Guarantee Facility Project.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES1 \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nImportance  of  Private  Sector  Development  Recognized.  After  prolonged  civil  strife \nand  conflict,  Afghanistan's  infrastructure  and  industries  are  in  a  desolate  condition;  its  human \nresource  base  and  social  capital  are  severely  depleted,  and  public institutions  are  hindered by \nweak operational capacity. While the international community is exerting considerable efforts to \nsupport  Afghanistan\u2019s  rebuilding  and  development,  available  official  flows  are  not  sufficient  to \nsupport  and  sustain  the  reconstruction  effort.  A  vibrant  private  sector  is necessary  to  generate \nemployment and long-term economic growth for poverty reduction, and to realize tangible results \nfrom  further  prospects  of  lasting  peace.  The  importance  of  private  sector  development  is  also \nlaid down in the country\u2019s new constitution, which was adopted in December 2003.2 \n \n3. \nImprovement in Investment Environment. The Government of Afghanistan has taken \nsignificant  steps  to  improve  the  institutional,  policy,  and  legal  environments  for  investment.  In \nOctober  2003,  the  Afghanistan  Investment  Support  Agency  (AISA)  was  created  as  a \nprofessional  body  within  the  framework  of  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  to  facilitate  and  promote \ninvestment  in  Afghanistan.  A  government  directive  created  AISA  as  a  \u201cone  stop  shop  for \ninvestors\u201d,  and  made  it  responsible  for  registering,  licensing,  and  promoting  all  investments  in \nAfghanistan. AISA aims to operate as a lean and efficient organization, with key staff possessing \nsignificant international business experience. As one of its first measures, AISA streamlined the \nregistration process for new investments into Afghanistan from more than 28 steps, which took \nseveral  months  to  complete,  to  only  5  steps  that  can  be  completed  in  less  than  1  week.  In \naddition,  a  new  investment  law3  was  drafted  and  is  expected  to  be  enacted  shortly.  It  is \nconsidered  one  of  the  most  progressive  investment  laws  in  the  region,  allowing  full  foreign \ninvestment  in  virtually  all  sectors  of  the  economy.  There  are  no  restrictions  on  remittances  of \nprofits  and,  in  case  of  investor  complaints,  international  dispute  settlement  is  provided.  In \naddition, an open trade regime has been introduced, including a tariff band with only four slabs \nand maximum tariff of only 16% and streamlined customs clearance. \n \n4. \nFinancial  Sector  Reforms  Under  Way.  A  more  efficient  financial  sector  will  be  key  to \nAfghanistan\u2019s private sector development, and important reforms have been undertaken over the \npast 18 months. In early 2003, a new currency was successfully introduced. Since then, a stable \nexchange  rate  regime  has  been  maintained,  and  inflation  has  been  kept  under  control.  To \nfacilitate  an  efficient  financial  sector,  a  new  banking  law  was  enacted.  It  allows  banks  to  be \n100% foreign owned. Several international banks have already opened offices in Afghanistan to \noffer a wider range of financial services. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  For a more detailed analysis, see ADBI. 2004. Post-Conflict Reconstruction: the Afghan Economy. Tokyo.  \n2   Article 10 of the Constitution  states: \u201dThe state protects and  promotes  private investment based on a free market \n\neconomy\u201d. \n\n3   http://www.export.gov/afghanistan/pdf/afinvlaw.pdf \n\n\f  2\n\n \n\nInvestment  Picking  Up.  While  reliable  statistics  on  private  sector  activities  are  hard  to \n5. \ncome  by,  indicators  depict  a  sharp  rise  in  recent  trade  and  investment,  and  most  of  this  is \nassumed to take place in the private sector. AISA has registered 151 new projects amounting to \n$435 million during the first 6 months of its operation (October 2003\u2013March 2004). International \ninvestors include a range of well-known firms in a variety of sectors from transport and logistics \nto tourism, telecommunications, agro-processing, consumer goods, and oil and gas. \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Issues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Environment \n\ninstitutional  environments.  On \n\n \n6. \nA  Challenging  Investment  Environment  with  Considerable  Potential.  Despite  the \ngood  progress  in  a  number  of  areas  over  the  past  months,  Afghanistan  still  lacks  a \ncomprehensive  private  sector  support  mechanism  and  gaps  continue  to  exist  in  the  policy, \nregulatory,  and \nthe  social  side,  unemployment  and \nunderemployment  remain  major  issues,  while  salaries  and  education  levels  are  low.  Yet, \nAfghans in the past have proven to be resilient, hardworking, and dedicated, and have thrived in \ndifficult environments. An international investor conference held in March 2004 in Berlin attracted \na  significant  number  of  potential  investors  and  underlined  that  considerable  returns  can  be \nexpected  by  investors  that  are  courageous  enough  to  invest  in  the  early  stages  of  economic \ndevelopment.  By  establishing  an  early  presence  in  Afghanistan,  companies  can  achieve  a  first \nmover  advantage.  A  more  detailed  analysis  of  key  issues  for  trade,  investment,  and  private \nsector development is in Appendix 1. \n \nPolitical Risks are a Key Investment Impediment. While there is considerable interest \n7. \nin  Afghanistan  from  foreign  private  investors,  political  risks  are  perceived  as  substantial.  Many \npotential  investors  interviewed  consider  political  risk  as  a  major  investment  impediment,  and \ncompanies  involved  in  substantial  investment  transactions  indicated  that  they  would  need  PRI \nbefore  going  ahead  with  their  projects.  Without  insurance  against  selected  political  or \nnoncommercial  risks  for  investment  projects,  investors  are  reluctant  to  do  business  in \nAfghanistan and are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Currently, only limited amounts of worldwide \nPRI  are  available  for  Afghanistan. Providing  an  effective  vehicle  for  political  risk mitigation  can \nsignificantly catalyze private sector investment into Afghanistan. \n \n8. \nFocus  on  Investors  from  the  Afghan  Diaspora.  To  speed  up  the  reconstruction \nprocess, the Government has started to engage the private sector aggressively. While external \naid  is  important  for  establishing  sound  conditions  for  a  developing  economy,  aid  alone  cannot \nbuild long-term and lasting economic growth. It is within this context that the Government gives \nhigh  importance  to  attracting  foreign  direct  investors,  including  investors  from  the  Afghan \ndiaspora.  The  primary  group  of  potential  foreign  investors  for  the  country  currently  consists  of \nreturning Afghan nationals who left Afghanistan as many as 25 years ago for Australia, Europe, \nNorth  America,  and  other  countries  in  the  region.  This  diaspora  has  strong  ties  to  Afghanistan \nand wishes to play a role in reconstructing the country.  \n \nPotential for Regional Trade and Cooperation. Other countries interested in trade and \n9. \ninvestments  include  regional  partners  such  as  India,  Iran,  Pakistan,  Turkey,  United  Arab \nEmirates,  and  Uzbekistan,  each  of  which  has  trade  ties  to  the  country.  Moreover,  North \nAmerican and European companies will likely show an interest when opportunities arise. Many \nforeign  investors  view  Afghanistan  as  a  central  business  hub  and  vital  trade  route,  where  the \nMiddle East meets South and Southeast Asia.  \n \n\n\f \n\n 3\n\n \n\n \n\nDiverse  Investment  Intentions  and  Opportunities.  In  the  period  November  2002-\n10. \nJanuary  2003,  the  Multilateral  Investment  Guarantee  Agency  (MIGA)  conducted  a  preliminary \nanalysis of the potential level of foreign direct investment (FDI) into Afghanistan as a proxy for \ndemand for political risk insurance (PRI). This analysis showed encouraging results. Demand is \nexpected to come from several sectors including energy, telecommunications, internet services, \nbanking, hotels, housing, food and agribusiness, textile, steel, oil and gas, and mining. Most of \nthis  will  be  through  small  and  medium-size  enterprises  (SMEs),  or  smaller  investments  by \ninternational firms. Appendix 2 gives an indicative list of projects.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLink to Country Strategy and Program \n\n \n11. \nPrivate Sector Development is High on the Development Agenda. The Government \nhas given high priority to private sector promotion in its development agenda. Early in 2002, a \nclear strategy for the country\u2019s reconstruction was elaborated through the National Development \nFramework  (NDF),  which  is  based  on  three  major  development  objectives:  (i)  humanitarian \nassistance, human and social capital; (ii) physical reconstruction and natural resources, and (iii) \nprivate  sector  development.  In  the  NDF,  the  Government  expressed  a  strong  commitment  to \ndevelop a competitive export-oriented economy, to provide the engine of growth and instrument \nof social inclusion through the creation of business opportunities. \n \nA Key Ingredient in ADB\u2019s Country  Strategy and Program. The Asian Development \n12. \nBank  (ADB)  resumed  operations  in  Afghanistan  in  May  2002  with  the  approval  of  the  Initial \nCountry  Strategy  and  Program  2002\u20132004,  which  proposed  $500  million  in  loans  and  grants \nover  2.5  years  to  build  capacity,  establish  appropriate  policy  and  institutional  frameworks,  and \nrehabilitate essential infrastructure.4 Support of the Government\u2019s strategy of a private sector-led \neconomic  recovery  will  also  be  provided  through  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations,  expected  to \ntotal  about  $53  million  in  2004  ($10  million  in  banks  and  funds,  $13  million  in  edible  oil \nprocessing,  and  $35  million  in  telecommunication  expansion)  and  about  $100  million  in  2005 \n($75  million  in  cement  production  and  $25  million  in  petroleum  storage  and  retailing).  ADB\u2019s \nprivate  sector  investments  are  expected  to  catalyze  investments  of  about  $240  million  in  2004 \nand  $450  million  in  2005.  At  an  international  conference  -  Afghanistan  and  the  International \nCommunity:  A  Partnership  for  the  Future  -  in  April  2004  in  Berlin,  ADB  also  offered  to  provide \nguarantees to catalyze private investments. Finally, Afghanistan\u2019s security and future prosperity \nwill be more easily achieved and more sustainable by promoting effective regional cooperation \non sectors such as transport, energy, and water. A summary of recent project approvals by ADB \nas well as assistance from other development partners is provided in Appendix 3. \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \n13. \nLimited  Implementation  Experience  in  Afghanistan.  ADB\u2019s  recent  operations  in \nAfghanistan  resumed  only  in  December  2002  with  the  $150  million  Postconflict  Multisector \nProgram  Loan  (PMPL).  This  was  the  first  loan  by  an  international  financial  institution  to \nAfghanistan  since  1979.  The  PMPL  promoted  economic  growth  and  recovery  in  the  war-torn \ncountry by supporting policy and institutional reforms to improve governance and strengthen the \nInfrastructure \nfinancial, \nRehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Project  (EIRRP),  approved  in  June  2003,  is  rebuilding \nimportant road and power infrastructure and irrigation systems in northern Afghanistan. The $55 \nmillion  Agriculture  Sector  Program  Loan  (ASPL),  approved  in  May  2004,  promotes  agricultural \n\ntransport,  and  energy  sectors.  The  $150  million  Emergency \n\n                                                 \n4   More recently, ADB pledged at an international conference on Afghanistan in early 2004 to consider assistance of \nabout $800 million in ADF loans and grants during 2005\u20132008, subject to finalization of ADF negotiations.

Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f  4\n\n \n\ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction  by  developing  a  sound  policy  framework  and  efficient  sector \ninstitutions.  As  of  June  2004,  ADB  had  also  approved  $26.35  million  in  capacity-building  TA \ngrants, and was administering $65.6 million in cofinanced activities.  \n \nEncouraging  Portfolio  Performance.  While  recent  implementation  experience  in \n14. \nAfghanistan  is  limited,  early  indicators  suggest  that  Afghanistan  has  so  far  made  good  use  of \naid. The PMPL leveraged policy and institutional reforms to ensure that reconstruction efforts in \nkey sectors are soundly based. Government compliance with program terms and conditions was \nexemplary;  the  final  tranche  was  disbursed  in  December  2003.  The  ASPL  aims  at  a  similar \nobjective  in  agriculture  and  natural  resource  management;  first  tranche  conditions  were  met \nbefore loan approval. The Government\u2019s timely and effective compliance with tranche conditions \nunderscores  its  sense  of  program  ownership.  Civil  works  under  the  EIRRP  as  well  as  pilot \nprojects  in  the  education,  health,  transport,  irrigation,  and  community  development  sectors \nfunded  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  and  Kuwait  Fund  for  Arab  Economic \nDevelopment are under way. TA projects are progressing smoothly despite minor delays due to \nsecurity concerns. To date, $187.4 million has been disbursed out of a total loan assistance of \n$372.2 million, a disbursement ratio of 50.4%. \n \n15. \nLessons  of  Development  Partners  in  Similar  Initiatives.  While  this  is  ADB\u2019s  first \nsupport  for an  investment  guarantee  facility  in a  post-conflict  environment,  there  is  a  wealth  of \nfeedback  from  similar  initiatives  carried  out  by  the  World  Bank  and  International  Development \nAssociation  (IDA)  elsewhere.  The  proposed  Project  has  design  features  similar  to  those  of \nguarantee  facilities  that  IDA  undertook  in  Africa  (Regional  Trade  Facilitation  Project),  Albania, \nBosnia  and  Herzegovina,  and  Moldova,  whereby  IDA  provided  credits  to  the  governments \nconcerned,  which  were  then  held  in  trust  accounts  in  support  of  guarantees  issued  against \npolitical  risks  to  private  investors.  It  also  has  similarities  with  investment  guarantee  trust  funds \noffered by the MIGA in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the West Bank and Gaza, whereby MIGA \non behalf of others, administered a trust fund against which it issued PRGs.  \n \n16. \nrelevant to this Project are the following: \n \n\nThe key lessons learned in preparing and implementing the preceding projects that are \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nThe main lesson is to root the project in a firm understanding of the target market \nand build on that understanding and subsequent contacts with the private sector \nto  develop a  strong  database  of  prospective  investment  clients.  Experience  with \nthe  World  Bank\u2019s  Bosnia  facility  shows  that  the  PRG  facility  concept  has \nimportant scope for attracting other risk takers, including private political risk and \ncredit insurers. \n\nThe  leveraging  mechanism  allocates  the  risk  to  the  party  that  has  the  best \ncapacity  to  mitigate  it,  e.g.,  the  governments  concerned.  The  World  Bank\u2019s \nRegional  Trade  Facilitation  Project  in  Africa  was  structured  in  such  a  way  that \nclaims  would  be  paid  out  of  the  trust  account  to  which  the  IDA  funds  are \ndisbursed, until the funds in the account are exhausted (in other words, the trust \naccount is \u201cfirst loss\u201d), at which point the private insurers would become liable for \nadditional claims. \n\nMIGA\u2019s  experience  in  administering  guarantee  trust  funds  for  Bosnia  and \nHerzegovina  has  revealed  that  a  local  MIGA  presence  in  the  host  country  to \nimplement these trust funds is essential to its success. This is because, without a \nsubstantial  marketing  effort,  the  start-up  period  of  the  facility  is  likely  to  be \n\n\f \n\n 5\n\nsluggish. In addition, local presence greatly facilitates the underwriting of a project \nin  a  complex  conflict-affected  environment,  where  MIGA\u2019s  understanding  of  the \ncountry risk and the reputation of investors are significantly enhanced by having \nlocal presence.  \n\n \n17. \nNeed for Flexibility. The guarantee facility needs to be flexible enough to accommodate \na  wide  range  of  eligible  investments  that  will  support  private  sector  development  in  a  conflict-\naffected environment. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nObjective \n\n \nA. \n \n18. \nThe  proposed  Project  will  assist  Afghanistan  in  its  reconstruction  efforts  by  supporting \nprivate  sector  development.  The  purpose  is  to  stimulate  FDI  in  an  environment  where  political \nrisk  is  perceived  as  high,  through  a  structured  assistance  modality  that  will  issue  PRGs  to \neligible investors. Thus, the Project aims to attract FDI in a variety of sectors including, but not \nlimited to, manufacturing, agribusiness, banking, and smaller scale infrastructure projects. FDI is \nexpected to stimulate the local economy, generate employment, create tax revenues, and assist \nin  transferring  modern  technologies  and  business  practices  from  abroad  to  Afghanistan.  The \nproject framework is in Appendix 4. \n \nB. \n \n \n \n19. \nthe PRGs issued and leverage cofinancing from various official and commercial sources.  \n \n\nThe Project will be structured in two distinctive components to ensure capital backing of \n\nGuarantee Cover Through Two Distinctive Components \n\nComponents and Output \n\n1. \n\nThe Afghanistan Investment Guarantee Facility (AIGF). The AIGF will be funded \nfrom public sector sources on concessional terms, including loans from ADB ($5 \nmillion equivalent) and IDA ($5 million equivalent) as well as possible grants from \nother sources (amounts still to be firmed up). The AIGF will cover the face value \nof  the  PRGs  issued  by  the  AIGF  on  a  \u201cfirst  loss\u201d  basis,  i.e.,  before  claims  on \nsupplemental PRG cover under the Project are paid; and \n\nSupplemental  PRG  cover  without  Government  counterguarantee.  This  will  be \nprovided  on  commercial  terms  from  risk-sharing  partners,  including  ADB  (up  to \n$10 million equivalent, through the Supplemental PRG Facility), MIGA (up to $10 \nmillion) and other public or private insurers (anticipated to be up to $30 million). It \nwill supplement the cover issued by the AIGF on a \u201csecond loss\u201d basis. \n\n \nThe Project will thus aim to leverage the initial amount of $10 million from official sources in the \nAIGF through supplemental PRG cover from commercial sources to a total amount of about $60 \nmillion  in  PRGs.  As  guarantees  are  normally  expected  to  cover  only  a  portion  of  each \ninvestment, the total investment volume supported by the Project is expected to be higher. The \nconceptual structure of the Project is presented in the Figure below. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f  6\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nStructure of the Project \n\nOfficial (Public Sector) Funding:\n\nCommercial Risk-Taking Capacity:\n\nBilateral Grants\n\nLoans (ADB, IDA)\n\nADB\n\nMIGA\n\nPrivate PRI \nMarket\n\nLeveraging through PRGs without \nCounterguarantee ($20-50 million)\n\nGovernment  of Afghanistan\n(Minstry of Finance)\n\nAIGF ($10 million, 1st loss)\n\nTechnical \nAssistance\n\nAISA\n\nImplementaion Agent: \nMIGA\n\nInvestors\n\n20. \nThe  various  components  of  the  Project  will  be administered  by  MIGA,  which  will  act  as \nImplementing Agency for the Project.5 MIGA issues guarantees to eligible investors on behalf of \nthe  AIGF  and  itself,  and  coordinates  with  ADB  as  well  as  other  commercial  PRI  providers  for \nguarantees issued through the use of MIGA\u2019s Co-operative Underwriting Program (CUP). MIGA \nwill  take  the  lead  in  underwriting,  administration,  and  claims  management  while  keeping  all \nproviders of coverage (including ADB) fully apprised of its activities in these areas. The use of \nMIGA\u2019s underwriting policies and methodologies will ensure that only projects that are financially \nviable  and  have  a  positive  development  impact  on  Afghanistan  will  be  underwritten.  MIGA  will \nliaise with AISA for marketing and promotion of the Project, supported through grant TA funds, \nand will seek host country approval from the Government before issuing any guarantees under \nthe Project.  \n \n\na. \n\nThe Afghan Investment Guarantee Facility \n\n \nThe  AIGF  will  cover  a  first  loss  portion  of  PRGs  issued  under  the  Project.  The  AIGF, \n21. \nthrough  MIGA,  will  issue  PRGs  for  debt  and  equity  cover  to  be  capitalized  through  loans  from \nADB and IDA, as well as grants from other financing partners, including possibly Germany and \nthe United Kingdom. Total funding for the AIGF is anticipated to be $10 million initially, but may \nincrease  subject  to  grant  funding  mobilized  from  bilateral  resources.  Funds  deposited  for  the \nAIGF  will  be  placed  in  a  special  account  (administered  by  MIGA)  to  ensure  adequate  capital \nbacking for all PRGs issued under the AIGF. The funded structure of the AIGF and its ability to \nabsorb a first loss in any claim event are important factors to leverage additional resources from \nvarious risk sharing partners, including ADB, MIGA, and the private PRI market. \n\n                                                 \n5   Detailed justification for the selection of MIGA and its role as Implementing Agency is in paras. 38-39. \n\n\f \n\n 7\n\n \n\n \n\nThe provision of the ADB loan to Afghanistan for financing the AIGF, which in turn issues \n22. \nPRGs that may cover equity transactions, does not raise any conflict vis-\u00e0-vis Article 11(iv) of the \nCharter.6 This is also consistent with IDA\u2019s views with respect to its Articles of Agreement.7  \n \n\nb. \n\nThe Supplemental Political Risk Guarantee Facility \n\n \n23. \nThe coverage provided by the AIGF will be complemented and leveraged by risk-taking \ncapacity  provided  without  counterguarantee  by  ADB,  MIGA,  and  the  private  sector  or  other \nofficial  PRI  providers.  ADB  and  MIGA  are  expected  to  provide  each  up  to  $10  million,  with \nadditional  amounts  up  to  about  $30  million  mobilized  through  cofinancing  under  the  co-\nguarantee  programs  of  ADB  and  MIGA.  ADB\u2019s  PRGs  will  be  provided  without  sovereign \nguarantee  through  the  Supplemental  PRG  Facility.  The  PRGs  issued  on  behalf  of  ADB \ncombined with other risk taking partners will cover the portion not covered by the AIGF, and will \nbe  called  only  for  residual  amounts  following  payout  by  the  AIGF  of  the  first  loss  in  case  of  a \nclaim event.  \n \nIt is important to emphasize that although the AIGF will be issuing PRGs that may cover \n24. \nboth equity and debt, PRGs issued by ADB through the Supplemental PRG Facility will not cover \nequity transactions. Such PRGs will be limited to debt transactions.8 \n \n\nThe direct output of the Project will be the issuance of PRGs for cover of selected risks to \n\n2. \n\nOutput and Scope  \n\n \n25. \neligible investors for eligible debt and equity investments into Afghanistan. \n \n26. \noccurrences, including four-point cover that is standard in the PRI industry: \n \n\nPolitical  Risk  Covered.  The  Project  will  provide  risk  coverage  for  the  following \n\nCurrency  inconvertibility  and  non-transferability.  This  coverage  addresses \nlosses incurred from the inability to convert local currency into foreign exchange \nand/or transfer foreign exchange out of the host country. \n\nExpropriation. This coverage applies when a loss is caused by host government \nactions  that  reduce  or  eliminate  ownership  of,  control  over,  or  rights  to  the \nguaranteed  investment;  this  includes  \u201ccreeping  expropriation\u201d  (i.e.,  a  series  of \nacts that, over time, have the same effect as expropriation). \n\nPolitical  violence.  This  coverage  is  applicable  to  loss  resulting  from  physical \ndamage,  destruction  or  disappearance  of  assets,  and/or  business  interruption, \n\n                                                 \n6   Article 11(iv) governs the nature of guarantees that ADB may directly issue. It does not govern guarantees provided \nby a facility (such as AIGF) that is funded by, and a project of, the Government, which project is in turn financed in \npart, by ADB. (See also R189-94 LAO:Theun-Hinboun Hydropower Project, where ADB\u2019s Board approved a loan of \n$60 million to the Lao PDR which was used  largely to fund the Government of the Lao PDR\u2019s equity contribution \n[through Electricit\u00e9  du Laos] to the Theun-Hinboun Power Company Limited. In that case, this was consistent with \nthe  way  ADB  can  carry  out  its  operations  under  Article  11  (i)  and  (ii),  i.e.,  by  making  a  direct  loan  to  the \nGovernment.) \n\n7   IDA  has  a  similar  provision  in  its  Articles  of  Agreement;  namely  Section  5(iv),  which  states  \u201cIn  addition  to  the \noperations  specified  elsewhere  in  this  Agreement,  the  Association  may:  .  .  (iv)  in  special  cases,  guarantee  loans \nfrom other sources for purposes not inconsistent with the provisions of these Articles;. . .\u201d   IDA views its IDA credit \npurely as a loan, and not a guarantee. \n\n8    In compliance with Article 11(iv) where the pertinent part states: \u201cThe Bank may carry out its operations\u2026 by (iv) \nguaranteeing,  whether  as  a  primary  or  secondary  obligor,  in  whole  or  in  part,  loans  for  economic  development \nparticipated in by the Bank.\u201d (emphasis added).   \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\n\f  8\n\n \n(iv) \n\ndue  to  politically  motivated  acts  of  war  and  civil  disturbance  (including  terrorism \nand sabotage). \n\nBreach of contract. This coverage is invoked when loss results from the breach \nby the host government of its contractual obligations to the investor. \n\n \n27. \nCoverage  Amounts  and  Exposure  Limits.  PRGs  issued  under  the  Project  are \nexpected  to  total  $60  million.  Maximum  exposure  by  the  AIGF,  ADB  under  the  Supplemental \nPRG  Facility,  and  MIGA  will  be  $10  million  equivalent  each;  additional  coverage  of  up  to  $30 \nmillion  will  come  from  other  commercial  PRI  providers.  The  AIGF,  ADB\u2019s  Supplemental  PRG \nFacility,  and  MIGA  cover  have  been  designed  to  support  investment  in  smaller  projects.  On  a \nper-project  basis,  the  coverage  by  the  AIGF  will  normally  not  exceed  $2  million.9  Risk  sharing \narrangements with ADB, MIGA and private PRI providers will be considered on a case-by-case \nbasis as appropriate, and take into account restrictions on ADB and MIGA operations (para 31). \n \n28. \nEligible Investors and Investments. Eligible investors include individuals, corporations, \nor  financial  institutions  that  provide  financing  for  new  projects  in  Afghanistan,  normally  from \noutside Afghanistan. A state-owned corporation or financial institution is eligible if it operates on \na  commercial  basis.  New  investments  are  those  that  have  neither  been  made  nor  irrevocably \ncommitted on the date of submission to MIGA of a signed preliminary application for guarantee \ncoverage.  New  investment  contributions  associated  with  the  expansion,  modernization,  or \nfinancial  restructuring  of  existing  projects  may  also  be  eligible,  as  well  as  acquisitions  that \ninvolve the privatization of state-owned enterprises. About 10\u201320 guarantees are expected to be \nissued, targeting primarily at SMEs across a wide range of sectors (para. 10).  \n \n29. \nIn keeping with the Project\u2019s objective of promoting economic growth and development, \ninvestment  projects  must  be  financially  and  economically  viable,  environmentally  sound  (in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  and  MIGA\u2019s  environmental  guidelines),  and  consistent  with  the  labor \nstandards and other development objectives of Afghanistan. Projects related to the production or \ntrade  of  items  for  military  or  paramilitary  purpose,  narcotics  or  hazardous  pesticides,  or  other \nitems as agreed upon with ADB and MIGA will not be eligible for cover under the AIGF and the \nSupplemental PRG Facility. \n \n30. \nTypes  of  investments  that  may  be  covered  under  the  Project  include  equity  (only  to  be \nprovided by the AIGF, MIGA and private PRI providers), shareholder loans and shareholder loan \nguarantees, as well as non-shareholder related loans.10 Other forms of investment, such as TA \nand management contracts, and franchising and licensing agreements, may also be eligible for \ncoverage. \n \n31. \nThe  Project  will  be  structured  to  take  into  account  the  differences  between  ADB\u2019s  and \nMIGA\u2019s eligibility criteria for political risk coverage. For example, ADB is precluded from issuing \nguarantees  for  equity  investments,  whereas  MIGA  is  not.  On  the  other  hand,  MIGA  can  cover \nonly  debt  if  it  also  covers  equity  or  quasi  equity  related  to  the  transaction.  Accordingly,  from  a \nstructural  perspective,  the  AIGF  will  have  the  flexibility  to  allow  for  various  scenarios  where \npolitical  risk  coverage  will  be  available  from  both  ADB  and  MIGA,  as  well  as  where  cover  will \ncome  only  from  either  ADB  or  MIGA.  To  allow  such  flexibility,  the  AIGF  will  be  structured  to \nprovide guarantees that meet either ADB or MIGA criteria, and the AIGF will be severally liable \n\n                                                 \n9   Lower limits may apply to transactions that do not meet eligibility requirements for ADB or MIGA cover (para. 31). \n\nLarger transactions may be considered on a case-by-case basis if all financing parties agree. \n\n10  Restrictions  apply  to  MIGA  cover  for  debt  transactions,  including  a  minimum  loan  period  of    3  years,  as  well  as \n\nrequired shareholder relationship. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n 9\n\nSpecial Features \n\n(on  a  first  loss  basis)  with  the  other  relevant  parties  that  are  providing  the  supplemental \ncoverage  (on  a  second  loss  basis)  for  each  individual  investment  project.  In  such  cases, \nexposure  limits  for  the  AIGF  and  the  risk-sharing  partners  will  be  adjusted  in  line  with  prudent \nrisk management standards. \n \nC. \n \n32. \nPublic Private Partnership and Cofinancing. The Project is a highly innovative model \nfor  public-private  partnership  and  cooperation  and  cofinancing  among  various  development \npartners  to  leverage  resources  and  complement  each  other\u2019s  strengths.  Scarce  public  sector \nresources are leveraged through a mechanism that combines ADB\u2019s guarantee instruments with \nMIGA\u2019s risk insurance, and allows to crowd in the private sector underwriters in transactions that \nnormally  could  not  be  considered  on  a  stand-alone  basis.  Through  ADB\u2019s  commitment  of  $15 \nmillion equivalent in total for the AIGF and Supplemental PRG Facility, an additional $15 million - \n45  million  may  be  mobilized  from  both  public  and  private  sector  sources  to  catalyze  private \nsector investment in a challenging investment environment. Moreover, the Project generates real \nsynergies  by  combining  ADB\u2019s  and  MIGA\u2019s  different  guarantee  products,  to  offer  a  range  of \nclient solutions that a single agency could not provide. The Project demonstrates the innovative \nand flexible application of ADB\u2019s guarantee and cofinancing instruments. \n \nD. \n \n33. \nThe  total  project  costs  and  financing  requirements  are  estimated  at  about  $60  million, \ncomprising  about  $10  million  for  capitalizing  the  AIGF,  and  up  to  $50  million  in  guarantee \noperations. Project costs are expected to be mainly in foreign currency.  \n\nCost Estimates  \n\n Cost Estimates, by Component and Funding Sources  \n\nComponent and Funding Source \n\nAmount  \n\nPercentage \n\nAIGF \n \nADB \n \nIDA \nBilaterala \n \nGuarantee/PRI Support \n \n \n \n\nADB \nMIGA \nPrivate PRI Market * \n\n($ million) \n\n \n\n5.0 \n5.0 \n \n \n10.0 \n10.0 \n30.0 \n\n \n\n8.3 \n8.3 \n \n \n16.7 \n16.7 \n50.0 \n\n \n \n\n60.0 \n\nTotal \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\n100.0 \n    a  Under discussion.

The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan has \nrequested a loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 3.43 million \n($5 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for funding the AIGF. The loan will \nhave a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years; with an interest charge at the rate \nof 1.0% per annum throughout the term of the loan; and such other terms and conditions as set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement. The remainder of funding for the AIGF is to be provided under \nparallel cofinancing arrangements from IDA and bilateral sources.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f  10\n\n \n\n \n35. \nSpecial Loan Terms. In view of the extraordinary challenges to cope with the continued \npostconflict  situation,  Afghanistan  has  requested  for  enhanced  concessionality  in  funding  the \ntransition  and  reconstruction  phase.  This  request  is  supported  by  recent  analysis  of  debt \nsustainability  by  ADB  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  which  concludes  that  funding  for \ndevelopment  projects  should  be  on  a  grant  basis,  or  on  highly  concessional  terms  for  key \nprojects and reforms for which no grant funding can be mobilized. Afghanistan is expected to be \neligible  for  grant  funding  under  the  recently  concluded  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  IX \nreplenishment.  This  will  result  in  softer  the  lending  terms  for  Afghanistan.  Until  such  time  that \nADF  IX  becomes  effective  in  2005,  grandfathering  of  the  pre-1999  ADF  lending  terms  as \ndescribed  in  para.  34  is  proposed,  similar  to  the  terms  for  other  projects  approved  for \nAfghanistan since lending operations were resumed in late 2002. \n \n36. \n$10  million  Political  Risk  Guarantee  Facility.  In  addition,  Afghanistan  has  requested \nADB  to  provide  up  to  an  aggregate  of  $10  million  equivalent  of  PRG  cover  without  sovereign \nguarantee, to complement the loan for funding the AIGF and match the $10 million commitment \nby MIGA to the Project.11 The Supplemental PRG Facility will be available during the life of the \nAIGF.  Pricing  for  the  PRGs  issued  under  the  Facility  will  be  market-based  in  accordance  with \npricing  established  by  MIGA  on  a  project-by-project  basis  (para.  53),  and  will  not  involve  the \nGovernment. \n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n37. \nExecuting Agency. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency for the \nAIGF and the ADF loan. MOF\u2019s role will be limited to one of oversight and accountability for the \nutilization of the loan funds, based on information provided by MIGA. \n \n38. \nImplementing Agency. MIGA will be the Implementing Agency for the Project, including \nthe AIGF and Supplemental PRG Facility, and will be responsible for the operational aspects of \nproject implementation. MIGA issues guarantees to eligible investors on behalf of the AIGF and \nitself12,  and  coordinates  with  ADB  as  well  as  other  commercial  PRI  providers  for  guarantees \nissued through the use of MIGA\u2019s CUP. MIGA will take the lead in underwriting, administration, \nand claims management while keeping all providers of coverage (including ADB) fully apprised \nof  its  activities  in  these  areas.  MIGA  will  also  establish  contacts  with  potential  investors  and \npromote the Project. In doing so, MIGA will liaise closely with AISA, and recruit a consultant for a \n2-year  period  to  train  local  staff  at  AISA  to  market  the  Project  and  initially  process  guarantee \napplications received from potential investors.  \n \n39.  MIGA will draw on its vast experience in guarantee operations and with similar projects in \nother postconflict countries. Since the start of its operations in 1988, MIGA has issued more than \n600 guarantees covering about $11.7 billion in investments. MIGA has also introduced a variety \nof  innovative  schemes  that  have  encouraged  public-private  partnerships  and  the  issuance  of \nguarantees  in  conflict-torn  areas,  such  as  its  CUP  and  Trust  Fund  in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.  To \ndate,  MIGA  has  had  only  one  claim  in  its  16  years  of  operation  (for  which  a  full  recovery  was \n\n                                                 \n11 These PRGs will be supplemental \u201csecond loss\u201d coverage to the \u201cfirst loss\u201d coverage issued by the AIGF for each \n\ndiscrete investment or project to be covered. \n\n12  PRGs issued by MIGA on behalf of the AIGF will be in accordance with MIGA\u2019s convention, operational regulations, \nand  other  relevant  policies,  i.e.,  MIGA\u2019s  regular  underwriting  procedures  and  methodologies  will  be  applied  for \nprospective projects, but will also take into account relevant ADB policies and guidelines. \n\n\f \n\n 11\n\nmade).  This  excellent  claims  experience  is  to  a  large  part  due  to  its  cooperative  ownership \nstructure;  each  member  country  owns  part  of  the  Agency  and  shares  the  cost  of  its  losses. \nPartnering with MIGA will ensure professional project management to the highest standards, and \nallow ADB to benefit from MIGA\u2019s unique expertise in the PRI business and further develop its \nown capacity, in line with a Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation signed by ADB and \nMIGA in 2002. \n \n40. \nADB\u2019s  Role  and  Involvement  in  Implementation.  Once  all  documentation  and \nagreements  have  been  finalized  and  the  Project  becomes  effective,  it  is  expected  that  ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement  in  the  operational  aspects  of  the  AIGF  will  be  limited  but  efficient  with  respect  to \nADB staff resource utilization. Primarily, this will involve consultation with MIGA and reporting on \nutilization  aspects  of  the  AIGF,  and  processing  of  withdrawal  applications  from  the  ADF  loan \naccount. With regard to the Supplemental PRG Facility, ADB will closely coordinate with MIGA \nand  will  be  provided  with  all  necessary  background  information,  such  as  fundamental \nunderwriting  procedures,  base  risk  analyses,  and  proposed  rate  ranges.  ADB  will  also  be \nadvised on an ongoing basis of the pipeline of prospective business, transactions proposed to be \nunderwritten,  and  conclusions  MIGA  arrives  at  with  respect  to  the  nature  of  political  risk  and \ncorresponding pricing. ADB\u2019s level of monitoring should provide it with an adequate opportunity \nto  double-check  eligibility  and  creditworthiness.  Familiarity  with  MIGA\u2019s  processes  and \nprocedures assures ADB that due diligence conducted on eligible customers will be comparable \nto that which would be undertaken by ADB. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \nThe  AIGF  and  ADB\u2019s  Supplemental  PRG  Facility  will  have  an  availability  period  of  5 \n41. \nyears after effectiveness, during which PRGs can be issued, with possible extensions of up to 3 \nyears  to  be  discussed  at  the  end  of  year  5.  If  PRGs  that  have  been  issued  are  canceled,  or \nexpire,  the  funds  released  could  be  used  in  a  revolving  manner  to  backstop  subsequent \nguarantees  for  the  duration  of  the  availability  period.  Therefore,  the  AIGF  and  Supplemental \nPRG Facility could, in principle, be used to support a multitude of transactions during this period. \nIndividual PRGs issued under the Project are expected to have a life of not more than 7 years. \nAssuming that the last guarantee is issued at the end of year 5 for a period of 7 years, the total \nimplementation period of the Project could extend to 12 years. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement  \n\n \nNo Direct Procurement from Loan Proceeds During Implementation Period. During \n42. \nthe 5-year availability period of the loan, there will be no direct procurement of physical goods or \nservices from the loan; rather, the loan will be utilized for capital backing of PRGs issued by the \nAIGF (through MIGA) to guarantee investments and inputs by the guarantee holder.  \n \n43. \nProposed Exception to Procurement Restrictions for Guarantee Cover. Most of the \ninvestments  to  be  supported  through  the  Project  are  expected  to  come  from  ADB  member \ncountries  and  involve  procurement  from  ADB  member  countries,  including  Afghanistan. \nHowever,  some  investments  or  procurement  may  come  from  non-ADB  member  countries, \nincluding the Middle East. For maximum development impact, investors typically will seek quality \ngoods  and  services  at  the  most  competitive  prices.  Explicit  procurement  restrictions  on  the \nguarantee  cover  may  preclude  investors  from  seeking  the  best  business  terms,  and  restrict \neconomic  efficiency  and  undermine  the  reconstruction  efforts  as  well  as  the  Project\u2019s \noverarching  goal,  including  private  sector  development.  To  maximize  the  development  impact \nand economic efficiency of the Project, and facilitate cooperation and risk-sharing arrangements \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f  12\n\namong  the  various  development  agencies  involved  a  streamlined  and  effective  manner,  it  is \nproposed that guarantees issued under the Project be allowed to support transactions in which \nthe underlying investments will procure eligible goods and services (para. 28) from all countries, \nincluding  non-ADB  member  countries,13  so  long  as  such  goods  are  not  from  an  embargoed \ncountry. \n \n44. \nUse of Loan Proceeds After Project Period and Guarantee Expiration. Any unused \nfunds remaining in the special account (para. 45) at the end of the project implementation period, \nor that become available as PRGs expire after the project implementation period, may be utilized \nby the Government for establishing a new guarantee facility, or for financing imports other than \nineligible items (as specified in Appendix 5) from ADB member countries and in accordance with \nADB policies and procurement guidelines. \n \n\n4. \n\nLoan Disbursement Arrangements \n\n \n45. \nUse of a Special Account. Prior to loan effectiveness, the Government will cause MIGA \nto  establish  a  special  account14  for  the  AIGF  as  agreed  upon  with  IDA,  MIGA,  and  ADB  for \ndisbursement  of  the  loan  proceeds.  ADB  will  advance  funds  to  the  special  account,  with \ndrawdown  based  on  guarantees  issued  by  the  AIGF.  The  special  account  will  be  operated  by \nMIGA and will constitute a revolving fund, which will be replenished with premium income from \nguarantees issued under the AIGF as well as any recoveries made on payouts.  \n \n46. \nThe liquidity built up within the special account will be used solely for capital backing of \nguarantees issued by the AIGF in accordance with the Loan Agreement. Utilization of the AIGF \nfunds for payouts to guarantee holders will be in line with the AIGF documentation agreed with \nADB. The interest earned on the special account will accrue in the special account as additional \nreserve,  and  may  be  used  to  pay  loan  service  charges  to  ADB  and  IDA  as  well  as  any \nadministrative fees to MIGA. \n \n47. \nDemand-Based  Disbursement  and  Withdrawal  Applications.  The  loan  will  be \nreleased  to  the  special  account  based  on  the  anticipated  volume  of  guarantee  cover  to  be \nprovided by the AIGF over the next 6 months. Subsequent disbursements to the special account \nwill  be  based  on  the  utilization  of  the  preceding  disbursements  as  well  anticipated  volumes  of \nguarantees. A withdrawal application by MOF (or by MIGA on behalf of MOF) will be submitted \nto  ADB  before  each  disbursement.  The  withdrawal  application  will  be  accompanied  by \nsupporting documents to demonstrate the use of the AIGF in accordance with the terms of the \nLoan Agreement, and will include a statement of outstanding guarantees under the AIGF. \n \n48. \nLiquidation of Funds at the End of Project Period. Any amount not disbursed by ADB \nat the end of the project period will be canceled. Any positive balance left in the special account \nrelated  to  the  ADB  loan  at  the  end  of  the  project  period,  or  that  becomes  available  after  the \nexpiry  of  outstanding  guarantees,  may  be  used  to  finance  eligible  imports  from  ADB  member \ncountries (as described in para. 44 and in Appendix 5). \n \n\n                                                 \n13  This is pursuant to Article 14 (ix) of the ADB Charter, which provides that the Board may, by a vote of the Directors \nrepresenting  not  less  two  thirds  of  the  total  voting  power  of  the  members,  determine  to  permit  procurement  from \nnon-ADB member countries in special circumstances making such procurement appropriate. This exception is only \nproposed to the current Project, and will not be applicable to other projects in Afghanistan or elsewhere, nor is this \nexception intended to set a precedent for future projects in Afghanistan or elsewhere.  \n\n14  Essentially, this will be a special account (for disbursement purposes) where moneys will be deposited so that the \n\nAIGF can issue guarantees. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n 13\n\n \n\n \n\nTo utilize the proceeds from the special account after the project period, the Borrower will \n49. \ncertify that the value of eligible imports from ADB member countries over an agreed upon period \nexceeds the procurement to be undertaken from the remaining proceeds in the special account, \nand  that  such  procurement  will  be  undertaken  through  normal  commercial  practices  for  the \nprivate sector or the Government\u2019s prescribed procurement procedures acceptable to ADB, with \ndue consideration to economy and efficiency. Such certificate will be submitted to ADB after the \nproject period but prior to closing date of the loan. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the \nloan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. If ADB determines that \nany proceeds have been used to fund ineligible items, the Government may be required to return \nthe amount of such payment used for ineligible expenditure. \n \n\n5. \n\nGuarantee Arrangements \n\n \n50. \nLegal  Structure  and  Documentation.  Both  ADB  and  IDA  will,  respectively,  enter  into \nloan  agreements  with  the  Government  for  establishing  the  AIGF.  MIGA  will  enter  into  a \nframework agreement with the Government for management of the AIGF. This will address the \nestablishment and operation of the special account, administration of funds, handling of premium \nand  interest  revenues,  arrangements  with  other  lenders  and  risk  sharing  partners,  and \noperational  rules  and  regulations.  A  participation  agreement  will  be  entered  into  by  ADB  and \nMIGA. The agreement will regulate, among others, the pari passu rule with regard to payments \nfor claims and distribution of premium amounts for PRGs issued. For each PRG issued by ADB \nunder  the  Supplemental  PRG  Facility,  ADB  will  enter  into  an  project  specific  agreement  with \nMIGA  and  other  providers  of  political  risk  coverage  under  MIGA\u2019s  CUP.  The  contract  of \nguarantee  and  all  other  relevant  legal  documentation  will  reflect  and  covenant  the  various \nprovisions provided for guarantee operations in ADB\u2019s Operations Manual.15 \n \n51. \nUnderwriting  Process.  MIGA  will  assume  the  leading  role  with  respect  to  structuring \nand  undertaking  the  due  diligence  associated  with  issuing  individual  guarantees.  MIGA  will \nprocess all guarantees in accordance with its Underwriting Department Operational Procedures. \nThe flow chart in Appendix 6 summarizes the underwriting process. It typically takes 3-6 months \non average to process a guarantee. MIGA will undertake best efforts, however, to accelerate the \nprocessing  time  so  that  each  transaction  under  the  Project  will  take  only  about  2-3  months. \nMIGA board approval is required for all guarantees it approves on its account under the Project. \n \n52. \nThe  PRGs  under  the  Supplemental  PRG  Facility  will  be  underwritten  and  issued  on  a \nproject-specific  basis  directly  to  the  guarantee  holders  under  MIGA\u2019s  CUP.  The  PRGs  will  be \nissued in line with the proposed eligibility criteria (paras. 28 to 31) and exposure limits (para. 27) \nup to an aggregate amount of $10 million without the requirement for separate Board approval. \nThis  follows  the  approach  by  ADB  for  other  guarantee  facilities  approved  by  the  Board  in  the \nrecent  past16  as  well  as  the  approach  applied  by  ADB  for  sector  loans.  MIGA  will  provide  a \nproject  summary  to  ADB,  together  with  a  standard  \u201cconfirmation\u201d  that,  after  due  enquiry,  it \nbelieves  that  the  issuance  of  the  PRG  complies  with  ADB\u2019s  Charter  and  policies  and \nrecommends that ADB participates in the CUP. ADB will review each PRG in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Operations Procedures and Operations Manual before it is issued.17  \n\n                                                 \n15 ADB.2003. Guarantee Operations. Operations Manual, Section D9. Manila. \n16 The facility approach, similar to a sector loan, was first approved by the Board in December 2000 for the Pakistan \nSmall  and  Medium  Enterprise  Trade  Enhancement  Facility  Project  (SMETEF)  (Loan  1796-PAK),  followed  by  the \nFinancial (Non-Bank) Markets and Governance Program (Loan 1956-PAK) and the Small and Medium Enterprises \nSector Development Program (Loan 2066-PAK).  \n\n17  ADB  review  may  be  streamlined,  based  on  the  substantive  due  diligence  carried  out  by  MIGA.  MIGA  will  provide \nADB with all necessary background information (para. 40) to assure ADB that due diligence conducted by MIGA on \neligible customers will be comparable to that which would be undertaken by ADB. \n\n \n\n\f  14\n\nPricing. Pricing of guarantee fees will be based on an assessment of project-specific as \n53. \nwell as country risks. ADB will rely on MIGA\u2019s pricing model, which analyzes both country and \nproject-specific  risks.  ADB  will  adhere  to  the  pricing  MIGA  proposes  for  each  transaction,  but \nreserves the right to modify transactional pricing in accordance with its own risk assessment and \nmarket pricing. MIGA is in the process of assigning Afghanistan its own country risk rating. From \ninitial analysis, MIGA has indicated that it may charge and average base rate of approximately \n150  basis  points  per  annum,  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  perceived  risk  and  the  type  of \ncoverage  requested  by  the  guarantee  holder.  Pricing  will  vary  depending  on  the  type  and \namount of coverage a guarantee holder is requesting. Any front-end or standby fees applicable \nin  connection  with  the  PRGs  issued  under  this  Project  will  be  reflected  in  an  \u201call-in-one\u201d  price \ndetermined by MIGA. The guarantee fee will be payable upfront by the guarantee holder within \n30 days from the time the contract of guarantee is executed. \n \n54. \nFinancial  Administration  of  Guarantee  Fees  and  Other  Payments.  MIGA  as \nImplementing Agency and administrator of the CUP will centralize all payment flows related as \nset forth in the CUP agreement. MIGA therefore collects all premiums payable by the guarantee \nholders  and  distributes  ADB\u2019s  share  within  30  days  after  receipt  of  the  premium  payments. \nMIGA\u2019s  contract  of  guarantee  defines  the  contract  period  as  6  months  or  1  year  from  the \neffective date for which a one-time premium is paid in advance for the duration of the contract \nperiod. In the event that a claim has been paid, any amounts recovered under the claim will be \nshared between MIGA and each of the participants under the CUP agreement in proportion to \nthe  share  of  total  compensation  paid  by  each  party  under  a  given  contract  of  guarantee.  All \nparties  to  the  CUP  agreement  will  share  the  reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred  in \npursuing salvage in proportion to the total compensation paid under a contract of guarantee. \n \n55. \nCurrencies and Foreign Exchange Risks. PRGs under the Project will normally be in \nUS  dollars,  but  could  be  issued  in  other  currencies,  including  local  currency.  ADB\u2019s  maximum \nexposure  under  the  Supplemental  PRG  Facility  will  in  any  case  not  exceed  $10  million \nequivalent,  and  ADB  will  not  assume  any  exchange  risk.  Any  foreign  exchange  fluctuation  for \nguarantees issued in currencies other than US dollars will be borne by the guarantee holder. \n \n56. \nLoss Determination and Claims Management. A PRG issued under the Supplemental \nPRG Facility may be called by MIGA in case any guarantee payment is being made under the \nCUP. In such a case, ADB will disburse the required funds to MIGA (or the guarantee holder). \nMIGA will also have access to and control of the special account for the AIGF. The Government \nwill neither draw from the AIGF account nor have the authority to consent or place constraints on \nMIGA\u2019s ability to pay claims for the account. Filing for and management of claims will be in line \nwith the following procedure:  \n \n\nCure period. To give the Government an opportunity to correct any policy-related \nactions or inactions that would trigger a claims payment, a 45-day cure period will \nbegin when MIGA is notified of a potential claim.  \n\nClaims  procedure.  Upon  expiration  of  the  cure  period,  a  guarantee  holder  will \nhave  the  right  to  file  a  claim  if  the  problem  has  not  been  resolved  satisfactorily. \nUpon receipt of a claim, MIGA will have 15 days to either (a) accept the claim and \nmake  the  required  payment,  or  (b)  reject  the  claim.  If  MIGA  rejects  a  claim,  the \nguarantee  holder  will  have  the  right  to  initiate  binding  arbitration  proceedings. \nMIGA would pay the claim if the arbitrator rules in favor of the guarantee holder. \nWhen  MIGA  is  required  to  pay  the  claim,  the  AIGF  and  the  other  risk  sharers, \nincluding ADB, will pay the claim with their respective resources. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n 15\n\n \n(iii) \n\nArbitration.  If  an  event  arises  between  MIGA  and  the  guarantee  holder  as  to \nwhether (a) government action or inaction should lead to a call of the guarantee, \nor  (b)  the  Government  has  in  fact  corrected  the  initial  problem,  the  guarantee \nholder  has  the  right  to  initiate  arbitration  proceedings.  The  arbitration  procedure \nwill  stipulate  among  others  that  the  arbitrator  should  be  independent,  appointed \naccording to UNCITRAL rules; and that the decision of the arbitrator will be final \nand binding. The losing party will bear the costs of arbitration.  \n\n \n57. \nRisk Allocation and Market Collaboration. The actual risk sharing between the AIGF \nand others will be decided on a project-by-project basis. The aim is to support as many projects \nas possible and maximize market participation. The amounts to be used from the AIGF for each \nindividual  project  will  be  limited  to  $2  million,  unless  the  Government  otherwise  agrees,  along \nwith the other risk participants. \n \n58. \nTo  maximize  the  leverage,  the  AIGF  will  be  \u201cfirst-loss\u201d  to  ADB\u2019s  PRG,  MIGA  and  other \ncommercial insurers. This means that if a claim arises, the payment will come first from the AIGF \nuntil  the  money  that  has  been  allocated  for  an  individual  project  from  the  AIGF  has  been \nexhausted, at which point ADB, MIGA and other co-insurers in a project will be pari passu liable \nfor additional claims.  \n \n59.  MIGA  has  been  very  successful  in  achieving  risk  sharing  with  other  private  and  public \ninsurers  through  a  treaty  reinsurance  program,  whereby  a  pre-agreed  percentage  of  every \nproject is reinsured by MIGA\u2019s treaty. Risk sharing also occurs through facultative reinsurance, \nwhereby the reinsurance partners and amounts are decided on a project-by-project basis.  \n \n60. \nthrough its Office of Cofinancing Operations, may attract additional co-insurers to the Project. \n \n\nFacultative reinsurance under this Project will be accomplished through the CUP. ADB, \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n61. \nThe  special  account  to  be  established  for  the  AIGF  will  operate  in  accordance  with \naccounting procedures acceptable to ADB, and will be administered by MIGA as agreed upon in \nthe  relevant  legal  documentation.  MIGA  will  maintain  adequate  documentation  and  records  on \nthe  PRGs  issued  and  related  flow  of  funds.  Independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  will  audit \nthe  account  in  accordance  with  established  auditing  standards.  Certified  copies  of  the  relevant \nfinancial statements, as appropriate, and the report of the auditors in English will be submitted to \nADB  normally  within  3  months,  but  not  later  than  6  months,  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year. \nADB will reserve the right to cause inspection of accounts and relevant guarantee records and \ndocuments of the AIGF as required and appropriate.  \n \n62. \nEach  time  it  plans  to  issue  a  new  PRG,  MIGA  will  notify  ADB  and  provide  ADB  with \nrelevant documentation. MIGA will also provide ADB and the Government with periodic progress \nreports  on  AIGF  utilization.  Such  reports  should  include  information  on  (i)  the  number  of \ntransactions  and  guarantee  applicants,  (ii)  guarantee  terms  and  conditions,  (iii)  and  any  other \nmatters relating to the AIGF and guarantees issued as requested by ADB. Periodic reports will \nalso  indicate  the  relevant  projects\u2019  status  and  evidence  of  compliance  with  applicable \nenvironmental regulations of the Government and of MIGA and ADB.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f  16\n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n63. \nADB  will  review  implementation  of  the  Project  at  least  annually,  or  more  frequently  if \nrequired,  and  will  follow  up  on  the  periodic  progress  reports.  If  AIGF  utilization  does  not  meet \nexpectations,  ADB,  the  Government,  and  other  AIGF  partners  may  consider  measures  to \nenhance AIGF operations. \n \n64. \nA comprehensive midterm review will be undertaken about 18 months after the Project\u2019s \ninception to review all aspects of implementation. This review will focus on (i) the performance of \nMIGA  as \nissued  and  adequacy  of \nimplementation arrangements, including compliance with guarantee holder eligibility criteria; (iii) \npolicy and administrative constraints in implementation; and (iv) initial impact. \n \n65.  Within  3  months  after  the  end  of  the  eligibility  period,  ADB  will  prepare  a  project \ncompletion report. \n \n\nimplementing  agent;  (ii)  progress \n\nin  guarantees \n\n8. \n\nCompliance with ADB Safeguard Policies \u2013 Environment, Resettlement, and \nIndigenous Peoples \n\n \n66. \nADB safeguard policies and guidelines are applicable to the Project and will be adhered \nto. Consistent with other implementation aspects of this Project and for ease of administration, \nMIGA  will  assume  primary  responsibility  for  determining  and  monitoring  compliance  with \nsafeguard  policies.  ADB\u2019s  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  (RSDD)  has \nreviewed and compared ADB\u2019s and MIGA\u2019s environmental and social guidelines and concluded \nthat  the  policies  are  identical  in  substance,  save  for  a  few  differences,  primarily  with  regard  to \nnotice  periods  for  environmental  impact  assessments  (EIAs)  (120  days  versus  60  days, \nrespectively). A summary of MIGA\u2019s environmental and social safeguard policies is in Appendix \n7. RSDD has concluded that it foresees very few, if any, instances in which there is likely to be a \nsignificant  difference  between  MIGA\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  conclusions.  However,  MIGA  will  agree  to \nrelease a project sponsor\u2019s EIA at least 120 days before a guarantee is approved for Category A \nprojects  as  per  ADB\u2019s  requirements.  MIGA  will  also  share  with  ADB  at  an  early  stage18  of \nguarantee processing, the results of its environmental review.  \n \n67. \nADB  will  receive  a  copy  of  each  of  MIGA\u2019s  clearances  under  the  Project  to  be  able  to \nverify  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  guidelines.  If  there  is  a \nsignificant  divergence  of  opinion  between  MIGA\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  conclusions,  ADB  will  retain  the \nright not to participate in supporting the transaction in question.  \n \n68. \nBoth  the  AIGF  and  ADB\u2019s  Supplemental  PRG  Facility  are  classified  as  financial \nintermediary  for  the  purpose  of  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard \npolicies. ADB, together with MIGA, will establish an environment management system, which will \nbe documented in all relevant legal documentation to ensure adherence of guarantee holders to \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) as well as \nADB\u2019s  policies  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  Since  the  majority  of \nguarantees under the Project will be issued mostly to SMEs in the trade and light manufacturing \nsectors,  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  the  Project  could  create  detrimental  impacts  on  the  natural \nenvironment  and  indigenous  peoples  or  that  involuntary  resettlement  would  be  needed.  A \nsummary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy,  including  social  issues  assessment,  is  in \nAppendix 8. \n\n                                                 \n18 After  the  preliminary  application  and  screening  step,  in  accordance  with  MIGA\u2019s  Project  Cycle  and  Underwriting \n\nProcess. (Appendix 6). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n 17\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n\n \n69. \nTA will be provided under the Project on a parallel basis as grant from bilateral sources \n(but not ADB) for implementation through MIGA. The TA will support promotion and marketing of \nthe Project, and assist to build up local expertise within relevant institutions such as AISA or the \nlocal chamber of commerce. Such local expertise can be used to set up a more permanent local \nstructure  for  insurance  activities  related  to  foreign  trade  and  investment  in  the  future. \nSpecifically,  MIGA  will  recruit  a  consultant  for  a  period  of  2  years  to  (i)  market  the  AIGF  to \npotential foreign investors; (ii) identify and screen projects; (iii) assist MIGA to process guarantee \nproposals,  and  administer  and  monitor  contracts;  and  (iv)  train  AISA  staff  in  investment \npromotion  and  processing  of  guarantee  operations,  including  environmental,  social  and  legal \nassessments and relevant policies and guidelines to ensure compliance.  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nThe Project will yield a wide range of benefits across different levels: the macroeconomic \n\n \n70. \nlevel, the sector and policy level, the institutional level, and the investment and enterprise level.  \n \n71.  Macro-Benefits.  On  the  macro-level,  the  Project  will  support  economic  growth  by \nstimulating the local economy through new investments. The new investments will have positive \nimplications  for  the  labor  market  through  increased  and  sustainable  employment  opportunities, \nwhich  in  turn  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction.  Increased  tax  revenues  as  a  result  of  higher \neconomic  activity  can  also  lead  to  positive  fiscal  implications.  Moreover,  increased  FDI  has \npositive balance-of-payment implications and will support integration into the global marketplace. \nImportantly, by stimulating private sector development as an essential element for the country\u2019s \neconomic  progress  and  as  a  foundation  for  peace  and  stability,  the  Project  will  make  an \nimportant contribution to the ongoing rebuilding and reconstruction of Afghanistan. \n \n72. \nSector  and  Policy  Benefits.  On  the  sector  level,  the  Project  will  support  industrial \nproduction  and  development  by  improving  productivity  in  manufacturing  and  services  across  a \nvariety of industry sub-sectors. The Project will assist in the transfer of modern technologies and \nbusiness  practices  to  Afghanistan.  The  increased  investment  will  further  yield  economic  spill-\novers  and  contribute  to  the  emergence  of  private  input  supply  and  output  marketing  channels \nand, by creating equal opportunities for all sectors in a nondiscriminatory manner, allow private \nmarkets to determine allocation for financing. Finally, it will enhance the credibility of Afghanistan \nas  an  investment  destination  with  an  open  and  transparent  business  climate  characterized  by \nthe rule of law. As Afghanistan is emerging from a postconflict situation and undertaking a fresh \nstart in many areas, this additional level of comfort will be particularly required to attract private \nsector investment early on.  \n \n73. \nInstitutional Benefits. Through parallel TA financing implemented by MIGA, the Project \nwill support capacity building for key agencies involved in investment promotion, including AISA \nand the local chambers of commerce. \n \n74. \nEnterprise  Benefits.  Finally,  on  the  enterprise  level  the  Project  will  help  industrial  and \ncommercial  enterprises  establish  links  with  foreign  firms  in  order  to  restart  or  establish  their \noperations, through joint ventures;  upgrade production processes and product quality; facilitate \naccess  to  financing  for  increased  investment;  and  import  critical  inputs  into  the  production \nprocess and economic activity. \n \n\n \n\n\f  18\n\nValue added by ADB. ADB\u2019s participation in the Project addresses Afghanistan\u2019s lack of \n75. \ncredibility  in  the  eyes  of  foreign  investors  and  financial  institutions.  Currently,  most  public  and \nprivate  institutions  are  not  prepared  to  provide  PRI  coverage  for  Afghanistan.  A  single \ninstitution\u2019s  ability  to  assume  risk  is  severely  limited.  Risk  sharing  with  MIGA  and  other  public \nand  private  insurers  is  imperative  to  catalyze  investment  in  a  significant  way.  Further,  the \nproposed  funding  from  IDA  and  ADF  to  establish  the  AIGF  will  allow  entities  that  insure  on  a \ncommercial  basis  to  efficiently  share  risks,  and  significantly  increase  PRI  capacity  in \nAfghanistan.  Thus,  ADB  genuinely  plays  a  catalytic  role  and  the  Project  has  considerable \ndemonstration effect. Given the significant risks and challenges facing potential investors, ADB \nwill  serve  as  a  catalyst  in  leveraging  additional  foreign  private  investment  in  Afghanistan.  In \naddition, ADB offers effective support to Government participation in the Project.  \n \nthe \n76. \ndevelopment  outcome  at  project  and  subproject  levels  as  well  as  beyond  the  Project  by \nmonitoring certain performance measures for the duration of the Project. Such measures will be \nmonitored  for  indicative  purposes,  albeit  the  Project  on  its  own  may  be  considered  only  a \ncontributing  factor  among  many  other  driving  forces.  Performance  measures  employed  and \nmonitored beyond the Project at the sector level will include: \n\nImpact  Measures.  ADB  will  measure \n\nDevelopment  Effectiveness  and \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\ngrowth in private FDI, \ngrowth in commercial bank lending in the domestic banking sector, and  \nimprovement in the country\u2019s overall employment rates. \n\n \n77. \naccount during monitoring: \n\nAt  project  and  subproject  levels,  the  following  performance  measures  will  be  taken  into \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nannual direct and indirect employment growth by subproject, \ntotal value of investments and supplemental political risk coverage provided, \nannual net profits of the subprojects, \nupstream and downstream impacts of the Project, \nongoing  access  to  debt  and  equity  (including  growth  in  retained  earnings) \nfinancing for expansion purposes, and \nannual taxes paid. \n\n \n78. \nSpecific  performance  measures  may  also  be  adapted  for  individual  subprojects  as \nrelevant  and  useful  for  determining  overall  development  effectiveness  of  the  Project.  The \nProject\u2019s  development  effectiveness  is  monitored  through  consistent  and  standardized  data \ncollection over the life of the Project. \n \n79. \nProject  Risks  and  Mitigating  Measures.  The  main  risk  is  that  private  investors  and \nlenders will not be induced to finance transactions despite the risk mitigation offered by the AIGF \nand the other risk participants such as MIGA and ADB, and the stated objectives of the Project \nmay thus not be achieved, due to the following:  \n \n\n(i)  Security  Risks.  The  security  situation  may  worsen  or  hostilities  may  resume. \nThough security remains an issue in parts of the country, the risk is a deterioration of \nsecurity  in  areas  (including  Kabul)  that,  from  a  security  standpoint  are  currently \nconsidered acceptable to foreign investors. \n\n(ii)  Policy  Risks.  The  Government  may  lack  demonstrable  efforts  in  implementing \nnecessary  reforms  that  are  critical  to  foreign  investors.  In  the  case  of  the  banking \nlaw,  ratification  of  legislation  took  much  longer  than  expected.  The  passing  of  this \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n 19\n\nlaw should, however, have a very positive effect on FDI. Also, effective sanctioning, \nmonitoring,  and  legal  systems  are  just  emerging.  Effective  contract  enforcement  is \nessential  to  increase  private  sector  investment  and  political  risk  insurance  will \nenhance credibility for enforcement.  \n\n(iii)  Business  Risks.  Foreign  investors  may  fail  to  identify  commercial  opportunities  or \nlack access to commercial sources of debt financing, at both local and international \nlevels. Foreign banks may be reluctant to finance private investment into Afghanistan \nand local banks are not (yet) lending sufficiently to the private sector. Hence, some \nprojects  may  fail  to  materialize.  However,  the  availability  of  PRI  should  encourage \nbanks to start lending to economically viable ventures.  \n\n \nAnother risk is that after successful launch of the Project, a large number of claims may \n80. \narise  due  to  a  breakdown  of  the  political  environment,  or  even  a  resumption  of  hostilities,  and \nexpose ADB to losses under the Supplemental PRG Facility with limited potential for recovery. \nThis risk will be mitigated by ADB\u2019s and MIGA\u2019s right to suspend the issuance of guarantees.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n81. \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nGovernment Assurances. In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has \n\n(i)  Private  sector  framework  agreement.  A  framework  agreement  between  the \nGovernment and ADB was signed on 25 June 2003. This letter agreement contains \ncertain  assurances  by  the  Government  regarding  ADB\u2019s  commencement  of  private \nsector  operations,  including  those  involving  the  provision  of  guarantees,  and  will \nremain in effect throughout the project period. \n\n \n(ii)  No-objection letter. The Government has given a no-objection letter with regard to \nADB\u2019s  Supplemental  PRG  Facility,  and  this  acknowledgement  will  remain  in  effect \nthroughout the project period. \n\n \n82. \n Cofinancing  Assurances.  ADB  will  satisfy  itself  with  all  terms  and  conditions  of  the \nother principal documents associated with the Project, including the participation agreement with \nMIGA, and MIGA\u2019s CUP guarantee documentation. The legal documentation signed by ADB and \nMIGA, and the guarantee holders will govern the relationships between and among the parties. \nSuch documentation will be entered into if ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approves the loan and the \nSupplemental PRG Facility. All agreements will be on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB \nand  will  list  all  conditions  precedent  to  the  proposed  loan  and  guarantee  agreements,  which \ninclude, among others the following: (a) compliance with MIGA\u2019s and ADB\u2019s environmental and \nsocial  safeguard  policies  and  guidelines  will  be  ensured;  (b)  appropriate  arrangements, \nsatisfactory  and  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  be  made  to  finance  the  AIGF\u2019s  administrative, \nconsulting,  and  implementation  costs;  (c)  there  will  be  evidence  acceptable  to  ADB  that  the \nBorrower  and  MIGA  have  established  satisfactory  and  acceptable  financial  management  and \naccounting  arrangements  and  environment  management  systems  for  the  Project;  and  (d)  ADB \nmay require other conditions in accordance with prudent commercial practice. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f  20\n\nB. \n \n83. \nagreements: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe  following  conditions  for  loan  effectiveness  have  been  incorporated  into  the  loan \n\nThe  Government  and  MIGA  will  have  signed  a  framework  agreement  in  a  form \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  whereby  the  parties  agree  that  MIGA  will  act  as  the \nGovernment\u2019s implementing agent in administering the AIGF.  \n\nThe Government will have established a special account for the AIGF as agreed \nupon by IDA, MIGA, and ADB for disbursement of the loan proceeds. \n\nCondition Guarantee Effectiveness \n\n \nC. \n \n84. \nAs  a  condition  for  effectiveness  of  the  PRG  Supplemental  Facility,  ADB  and  MIGA  will \nhave signed a participation agreement, in a form satisfactory to ADB, whereby the parties agree \nthat MIGA will act as implementation agent in administering the PRGs issued under the Project. \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  guarantee  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\n \n85. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n \n\n(i) \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  3,430,000  to \nthe  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  the  Afghanistan  Investment  Guarantee \nFacility Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the \nrate of 1.0% per annum; a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board;  \n\n(ii) \n\nin  respect  of  such  loan,  a  variation  from  the  existing  loan  terms  under  ADF \nresources on an exceptional basis;  \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nthe Supplemental PRG Facility for a principal amount not exceeding the equivalent \nof $10,000,000 in favor of direct investors (without sovereign counterguarantee), on \nsuch terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthis Report; and \n\nthe  proposal  set  out  in  para.  43  of  this  Report  that  PRGs  issued  by  the  AIGF  or \ndirectly  by  ADB  for  investments  in  Afghanistan  covering  goods  and  services \nprocured  from  non-ADB  member  countries  be  eligible  for  guarantees  under  the \nProject.

Concerted  efforts  will  be  required  to  create  a  suitable \nenabling environment for the private sector and to push forward with public sector reforms that \nredefine  the  State  as  the  regulator  of  the  private  sector  and  not  a  competitor.  The  goal  is  a \ndynamic and well-regulated formal economy. \n \nTrade,  both  within  the  region  and more  globally,  will  be  a driving  force  in  Afghanistan's \n2. \neconomy. At the recent Cancun trade meeting, Government representatives pledged to build a \nforeign  trade  regime  that  will  allow  Afghanistan  to  easily  pass  the  standards  required  for \naccession the World Trade Organization over the next few years. The Government is preparing \nor  holding  consultations  on  a  wide  ranging  set  of  new  laws,  including  those  on  trade  in  goods \nand  services,  and  economic  governance  including  bankruptcy,  competition,  and  land  use. \nAfghanistan  has  also  joined  the  World  Customs  Organization,  and  on  15  September  2003  the \nGovernment approved new laws for central banking and regulations of all other banks. \n \n3. \nThe  context  for  private  sector  development  in  Afghanistan  is  difficult,  but  nevertheless \nhas  areas  of  strong  potential.  The  following  key  features  were  considered  in  determining  the \noverall focus of policies and the investment program. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nAfghanistan  is  a  landlocked  country,  with  porous  borders  and  surrounded  by \nneighbors  with  different  trade  and  investment  policies  that  are,  in  many  cases, \nquite restrictive. \n\nThe  Afghan  economy  is  largely  informal  and  undocumented,  with  the  informal \neconomy including most importantly the illegal drug industry. \n\nIn  2000,  official  trade  flows  were  estimated  at  around  $600  million;  and \nundocumented flows were much higher. \n\nInsecurity  severely  constrains  the  most  productive  private  sector  development \nand channels it into shorter-term activities. \n\nInfrastructure constraints, both national and within the region, undermine the cost \nefficiency of both trade and transit and thereby hurt private sector production. \n\nAfghanistan  is  an  agriculture-based  economy  whose  growth  is  constrained  by \nissues,  and  standardization  and \ntransport,  marketing,  quality  guarantee \npackaging. \n\n(vii) \n\nAfghanistan's  rich  underground  resources  are  underexploited,  and  large-scale \nindustry is still in its infancy. \n\n(viii)  Afghanistan's labor market is already highly integrated into the regional economy, \n\nas a result of the large numbers of refugees and economic migrants. \n\n(ix) \n\nLack of banking and insurance services undermines the formal economy. \n\n                                                 \n1  Excerpted  from  Government  of  Afghanistan.  2004.

Kabul, Afghanistan. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22\n\nAppendix 1 \n\n(x) \n\nLand allocation and uncertain property rights over land are commonly cited as the \nmost severe bottleneck in both formal and informal urban economic activities. \n\n \n4. \nAfghanistan has all along been a strong trading nation, but today, formal regional trade \nflows between Afghanistan and its neighbors are relatively small in absolute terms (Table A1.1). \nHowever, informal trade flows are large, particularly with Pakistan. \n \n\nTable A1.1: Regional Trade, 2002 \n\n          Afghanistan       Iran         Pakistan     Tajikistan      Turkmenistan \n\nUzbekistan \n\nItems \n\nExports \n\n    \nImports  \n\n \nTotal \n\nRegion ($ million) \nRest of World ($ million) \nRegional Share (%) \n\n28 \n76 \n27 \n\n           274 \n     25,890 \n1 \n\n         276 \n      9,610 \n             3 \n\n  118 \n  619 \n    16 \n\nRegion($ million) \n          284 \nRest of World ($ million) 2,396 \n 11 \nRegional share (%) \n\n      468 \n21,640 \n2 \n\n        240 \n10,998 \n2 \n\n  195 \n      525 \n27 \n\nRegion ($ million) \n      312 \nRest of World ($ million) 2,472 \nRegional share (%)            11 \n\n742 \n     47,530 \n2 \n\n516 \n20,608 \n2 \n\n     313 \n  1,144 \n21 \n\n    430 \n 2,280 \n      16 \n\n136 \n1,683 \n7 \n\n566 \n3,964 \n12 \n\n   158 \n 1,605 \n        9 \n\n       101 \n     2,124 \n5 \n\n59 \n3,729 \n6 \n\nSource: International Monetary Fund.2002;  Direction of Trade Statistics. Washington, DC. \n \nCapitalizing on Afghanistan's position as a land bridge for trading within the region and \n5. \npromoting its wider integration in the formal global economy require both policy and institutional \nreforms  to  be  rapidly  put  in  place.  To  this  end,  the  Government  has  established  foreign  trade \npolicies,  which  are  applied  uniformly  throughout  Afghanistan,  and  has  signed  new  bilateral  or \ntrilateral agreements with most of its neighbors. A new customs collection system is being put in \nplace, including the adoption of a simplified tariff law. A new customs code has been adopted, \nand the Government is planning to adopt new internationally - recognized customs declaration \nforms. The Customs Department has adopted a five- year plan for customs modernization. \n \n6. \nInternational  experience  shows  that  economies  that  are  positively  integrated  into  the \nworld  economy  have  achieved  higher  growth  in  incomes,  longer  life  expectancy,  and  better \nschooling  over  the  past  two  decades.  Enhanced  regional  cooperation  and  participation  in  the \nmultilateral  trading  system  are  therefore  important  long-term  objectives.  The  Government  will \ncontinue  to  pursue  efforts  to  increase  the  transparency  and  predictability  of  the  trade  regime, \nlimiting  the  use  of  nontariff  measures  to  legitimate  objectives  such  as  health,  safety,  or \nenvironmental reasons. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nserious constraints will need to be systematically overcome, including, the following: \n\nTo achieve sustained economic and reach GDP per capita of $500 by 2015, a number of \n\nKey Constraints \n\nInadequate security; \n\nweak  human  resources,  on  which  the  long  period  of  conflict  has  taken  an \nenormous toll; \n\nthe  inherited  policy  regime  whereby  public  enterprises  crowded  out  the  private \nsector in the formal economy; \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n23\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\na  poor  understanding  in  parts  of  the  Government  of  the  benefits  of  market \nintegration and trade; \n\nweak infrastructure and trade administration; \n\na poorly diversified economy (including agriculture) and consequent poor trading \nposition; and \n\n(vii) \n\nlack of banking, insurance, and other trade facilitation services. \n\nthat  are \n\nin  harmony  with \n\ninternational  standards; \n\nGovernment Vision and Strategy \n\n \nC. \n \n8. \nThe  Government's  National  Development  Framework  (NDF),  promulgated  in  2002, \nexplicitly  identifies  the  private  sector  as  the  engine  of  growth,  and  views  the  administrative \napparatus  of  Government  as  an  enabler  and  facilitator  of  private  sector  development.  Central \nthemes of the NDF include adopting an open trade regime with low and predictable tariffs and \ncustoms  procedures \ninstituting  a \nmarket-determined,  unified  exchange  rate;  establishing  modern  banking  laws;  building  an \nenabling  environment  for  investment  that  will  successfully  attract  private  and  public  capital  for \ntrade-related  infrastructure;  and  formulating  measures  to  prevent  corruption.  Considerable \nprogress has been made with implementation in some of these areas. \n \nMore  generally,  a  strategy  of  openness  to  international  trade  combined  with  a  strong \n9. \nenabling environment for the private sector is seen as the best path for exploiting opportunities \nfor  private  investment  and  economic  growth  in  the  longer  term.  The  overall  objective  is  to \nharness the economic potential of Afghanistan and all of its citizens, to maximize the growth of \nthe  formal  economy  through  better  policies  and  trade  facilitation,  including  a  secure  and \nconducive environment for domestic and international investment. To this end the Government \nwill  create  an  attractive  business  environment  for  both  domestic  and  foreign  traders  and \ninvestors  by  establishing  a  predictable  legal  framework  for  business;  providing  the  necessary \ninstitutional,  legal,  and  physical  infrastructure;  facilitating  their  activities  through  a  simple  and \ntransparent regulatory mechanism; and promoting trade, investment, and local business. \n \n10. \nas follows: \n \n\nSpecific directions and areas of engagement for private sector policies are summarized \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nEncouraging legitimate businesses in the formal sector. In the absence of a \nstrong  formal  sector,  people  seeking  employment  as  well  as  entrepreneurs  are \ndrawn  toward  a  wide  variety  of  illicit  and  criminal  activities  to  find  a  means  of \nlivelihood. It is therefore critical to provide an enabling environment for expansion \nof  the  formal  sector\u2014legitimate  private  enterprises  that  offer  employment \nopportunities. \n\nits  comparative  advantage \n\nFrom comparative advantage to competitive advantage. Afghanistan needs to \nfurther  exploit \nlike  horticulture, \nlabor-intensive  products  such  as  carpets,  mineral \nagriculture-based  and \nresources, etc. But over the medium to longer term, it will be vital for Afghanistan \nto  develop  a  more  dynamic  competitive  advantage  based  on  its  location,  an \nincreasingly  skilled  and  educated  labor  force,  its  entrepreneurial  dynamism \n(channeled into the formal sector), and regional business networks. \n\nin  areas \n\nGood  governance.  The  enabling  environment  for  the  private  sector  depends \ncritically on good governance and the absence of corruption.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24\n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nEncouraging  business  development.  The  strong  revival  of  the  economy  and \nthe reconstruction program itself provide great opportunities for the development \nof  the  Afghan  formal  private  sector  in  activities  that  provide  substantial  value \naddition and employment. This revival needs to be facilitated by proactive efforts \nat private sector capacity building, development of business support services, and \nthe like. \n\nIndustrial clusters. While it may not be possible to provide high-quality industrial \ninfrastructure across the country, that can be done for special industry clusters or \nindustry development areas, which should be privately managed on a commercial \nbasis. \n\nPolitical  risk  insurance.  Larger  foreign  companies  find  it  difficult  to  invest  in \nAfghanistan because of the real or perceived insecurity of their investments. The \nGovernment  has  received  bilateral  support  for  investment  insurance  and  is \nlooking for additional bilateral and multilateral support for its instruments.  \n\nEquity. In many areas, women are a driving force in economic growth, and this \nhas  a  direct  impact  on  the  social  and  economic  status  of  the  household.  Thus, \nfacilitating  women\u2019s  participation  in  economic  activity  is  of  very  high  priority. \nRegional equity and social inclusion also are critical.  \n\nSector Priorities for Private Development \n\n \nD. \n \n11. \nThe  Government,  while  not  singling  out  individual  industries  for  special  support,  will \nprioritize  interventions  that  have  maximum  impact  on  private  sector  economic  activity  and \nemployment  overall.  Priority  sectors  from  this  perspective  include  agriculture,  transportation, \nenergy, housing, communications, banking and financial services, and, over a longer time frame, \ntourism. \n \n\nAgriculture.  Since  the  vast  majority  of  the  Afghan  population  depend  on \nagriculture  for  survival,  it  is  necessary  to  give  a  high  priority  to  revival  of  this \nsector.  Typically,  while  the  Government  can  support  provision  of  inputs  and \nadvice on a macro level, as well as key investments in irrigation infrastructure, the \nprivate  sector  can  provide  inputs  such  as  seeds,  fertilizers;  minor  irrigation \nfacilities;  post-harvest  support  in  marketing  output;  and  income  stabilization \nthrough  crop  insurance.  The  private  sector  can  also  promote  dairy  farming  and \nanimal husbandry. \n\nTransportation. Transport infrastructure - such as roads, railways, and airports - \ninvolves  large  capital  intensive  projects  with  long  payback  periods.  Based  on \npublic investments in such sectors, private provision of transport services will be \nfurther stimulated and can flourish with commercial management of infrastructure \nassets and adequate cost recovery.  \n\nMining.  The  potential  for  mining  in  Afghanistan  is  considerable.  To  expand \nextraction, the Government will rehabilitate some existing mines, but will put the \nmain emphasis on attracting new private sector investment. The Government will \nadopt  appropriate  policies  and  programs  to  stimulate  private  sector  investment, \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n25\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nrather  than  make  new  direct  Government  investment  in  mining.  Emphasis  will \nalso be placed on those subsectors that can show results quickly. \n\nEnergy. Afghanistan is rich in primary energy resources such as coal and natural \ngas, and has significant hydropower resources. Options for the effective utilization \nof both solar and wind power may also be profitable over the medium term. The \nprivate  sector  could  assist  in  developing  these  resources  as  well  as  the  bulk \nimport,  storage,  and  distribution  of  petroleum  products.  This  activity  is  projected \nto increase sharply in the future. \n\nHousing and construction. Large public works, such as highways and bridges, \nare  being  constructed  by  the  Government  through  contracting  private  firms,  but \nreconstruction  of  homes  and  workplaces  remains  a  private  activity.  To  enhance \nindividual  efforts,  the  availability  and  quality  of  construction  materials\u2014  most  of \nwhich are imported from neighboring countries\u2014 should be steadily improved and \nprices  reduced.  Domestic  production  should  increase,  and  while  it  is  relatively \nsimple  for  aggregate  and  bricks  to  be  produced  by  the  unorganized  sector, \nproduction of good-quality, reasonably priced cement and its distribution need to \nbe in the formal sector. \n\n(vi) \n\nCommunications.  Afghanistan  has  a  difficult \nfixed \ncommunications  make  sense  only  within  and  between  urban  conglomerations. \nLow-cost  mobile  communications  technology  provided  by  the  private  sector \nmeets the needs of the situation and is flourishing. \n\nterrain  and  hence \n\n(vii)  Banking  arid  financial  services.  The  private  sector  must  be  supported  largely \nthrough  local  capital,  channeled  by  way  of  banks  and  the  capital  market  into \nproductive investments. Banking is clearly a priority for private sector investment, \nsubject  to  appropriate  regulation  and  prudential  supervision.  The  need  for \nappropriate  regulation  and  prudential  supervision  cannot  be  overstated  if  local \nintermediation is not to result in large capital outflows at a critical juncture in the \ndevelopment process.  \n\n(viii)  Tourism.  Afghanistan  is  a  land  of  stark  beauty  and  important  historical sites,  of \nwide  open  spaces  and  hospitable  people.  Hence  tourism,  including  eco-tourism \nand  adventure  tourism,  has  great  potential  over  the  longer  term.  Tourism  is \nexpected to provide greater employment and thus reduce poverty. Development \nin this sector is crucially dependent on security and, over time, adequate tourism \ninfrastructure. \nthe  early  preservation  and  enhancement  of \nAfghanistan's  cultural  heritage  is  essential  to  guarantee  tourism  over  the  longer \nterm, even if revenues from tourism will not be mobilized for some time.  \n\nImportantly, \n\nInvestment Program \n\n \nE. \n \n12. \nTo achieve the critically important objectives of the trade and investment program, and to \nprovide a conducive enabling framework for the private sector, the Government has structured \nits future investments around five core investment themes (program areas): \n \n\n1. \n\nTrade, Investment, and Private Sector Development Policy \n\n \n13. \nThis program area will focus on developing appropriate policies for trade, investment and \nprivate sector (TIPS) development in Afghanistan. The Government has defined its role as the \npromoter  of  trade  and  investment  by  providing  the  enabling  environment  for  activities  to  be \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26\n\nAppendix 1 \n\ncarried  out  by  the  private  sector.  Government  reforms  are  geared  toward  achieving  a \ntransparent  and  simple  trade  and  investment  regime  that  integrates  the  global  trade  system \npremised on free and fair trade with all its partners.  \n \n\n2. \n\nAdministrative Reform and Restructuring \n\n \n14. \nThe  Government  is  undertaking  vital  administrative  reform  and  restructuring  of  key \nministries,  their  associated  departments,  associations,  and  state-owned  enterprises.  This  will \nensure a clear institutional mandate, enhanced human resource development and administrative \ncapacity  and,  therefore,  improved  public  sector  management  capabilities  (policy,  provision, \nregulation,  operation,  and  maintenance),  with  both  public  and  private  incentives  linked  to \nperformance.  \n \n\n3. \n\nTrade, Transit, and Transport Facilitation \n\n \n15. \nThis program area aims to enhance trade and transport competitiveness in Afghanistan \nby reducing logistical and other transit costs. It will implement the key policy recommendations \nfrom  the  trade  and  investment  policy  program  area,  and  will  provide  analysis  and  feedback  to \nthe  other  program  components  regarding  evolving  trade  facilitation  issues.  This  will  be  a  vital \ninput to enhanced bilateral and multilateral trade discussions. Here, trade facilitation is defined \nas the process of removing obstacles to trade transactions and related logistics, at and behind \nthe borders.  \n \n\n4. \n\nInfrastructure, Equipment, and Logistics \n\n \n16. \nThis  program  area  will  facilitate  the  provision  of  supporting  infrastructure  (including \ninformation and communications) for developing the overall trade and investment program. This \nincludes facilitating the improvement of, and further creation of, trade- related infrastructure such \nas industrial parks and access infrastructure (roads, airports, etc.). The Government will limit the \nprovision  of  infrastructure  to  bare  essentials,  while  encouraging  (wherever  possible)  further \nprovision through either public-private partnerships or entirely by the private sector. \n \n\n5. \n\nDirect Support to the Private Sector \n\nImplementation and Capacity Building  \n\n \n17. \nThe  Government  will  provide  an  enabling  environment  to  support  and  facilitate  the \ndevelopment  of  the  private  sector  in  Afghanistan,  in  particular  by  helping  target  private  sector \nactivities that add value to the Afghan economy; assist in domestic business establishment and \nvalue addition, encourage legitimate business with a competitive advantage in local and global \nmarkets and which can be developed in industrial clusters. The focus is on developing specific \nmechanisms for public-private partnerships.  \n \nF. \n \n18. \nAlthough the financial resources required for the TIPS program are not extremely large, \ninstitutional,  policy,  and  capacity \nimplementation  will  be  challenging  because  of \nrequirements.  Thus  policy  design  and  implementation,  institution-building,  and  capacity  will  be \ncritical. \n \nA  TIPS  regime  that  is  not  harmonized  across  the  various  tiers  of  the  public  sector \n19. \nmanagement  structure  will  lead  to  barriers  to  growth.  Accordingly,  provinces,  districts,  and \nmunicipal  structures  all  play  a  role  in  the  implementation  of  policies.  To  ensure  sustainability, \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n27\n\nConclusions \n\npublic  policy  dialogue  with  traders  and  the  private  sector  will  remain  a  modus  operandi  for \nimplementation.  \n \n20. \nBuilding  central  ministry  and  provincial  capacities  will  be  an  important  factor  in  the \nsuccess  of  the  overall  program.  Institutional  reforms  will  follow  agreed-upon  public  sector \nmanagement  reforms.  Where  interim  capacity  is  required,  it  will  be  procured  from  the  private \nsector through contracting. The Government envisages that TIPS will be executed by competent \ncivil servants and managers with appropriate skills and experience. The capacity of the private \nsector too will need to be enhanced through the enabling environment and technical support. It \nis  recognized  that  public-private  partnerships  should  start  small  and  can  be  expanded  as  the \ncapacity of the local private sector builds up. \n \nG. \n \n21. \nOvercoming  the  constraints  to  trade,  investment,  and  more  generally  private  sector \ndevelopment  can  best  be  achieved  through  institutional  capacity  building  for  both  public  and \nprivate  sectors;  improving  public  sector  management;  formulating  a  sound  enabling  regulatory \nframework  for  businesses;  developing  banking  and  insurance  services,  including  political  risk \ninsurance; introducing standards, metrology testing, and quality certification services; training of \nlabor  and  skills  enhancement;  titling  land;  developing  infrastructure  for  trade  and  investment; \nfacilitating  trade,  transit,  and  transport;  and  giving  direct  support  to  the  private  sector  where \nappropriate.  The  Afghan  private  sector  also  needs  to  benefit  more  directly  from  the  present \nreconstruction  process,  and  efforts  to  create  partnerships  and  consortiums  need  to  be  given \nhigh priority. \n \n22. \ntrade and the private sector are summarized in Table A1.2. \n \n \n\nThe  investment  requirements  ($690  million  over  the  next  7  years)  needed  to  enhance \n\nTable A1.2: Trade and Investment Financing Requirements 2004 \u2013 2010 \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \n\n2004\u20132006 \n\n        2007\u201320010                       2004\u20132010 \n\n \n\n \n\nSubSector: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTIPS Development Policy \n      41 \nAdministrative Reform and Restructuring      109 \n      12 \nTrade & Transport Facilitation \n      55 \nInfrastructure, Equipment, and Logistics \n      15 \nDirect Support to Private Sector   \n\n \n\n \n\nTOTAL   \n\n   \n\n    232 \n\nSource: Government of Afghanistan.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n    50 \n    97 \n     8 \n  200 \n  102 \n\n 457 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n   \n   \n   \n\n   \n\n   91 \n 206 \n   20 \n 255 \n 117 \n\n 690 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28\n\nAppendix 2 \n \n\n \n\n2.TENTATIVE INVESTMENT PIPELINE \n\n(as of June 2004) \n \n\nSector \n\nInvestor \n\nStatus \n\nReg. \nNo. \n\nInvestor \nCountry \n\nInvestment \n\n($ \u2018000) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n06969 \n\nNetherlands \n\n7,000 \n\n10,000 \n\nAgribusiness \n\nG8 Cascade Holding \nLtd. \n \n \n \nOM Homes Ltd. \n \n \nManufacturing  Mr. Abdul Basir \n\nOmarzay \n \nTetra Pak Pakistan Ltd.\n \nPK International \nVentures \n \nSafi Apparel \nCorporation \n \nBank Melli Iran \n\n \nBI Financial Services \nInc.

Reforms under the \nAgriculture Sector Program Loan \n($55 million) and related technical \nassistance approved in 2004 \naddress market constraints to \nencourage private sector activity in \nthe important agriculture sector. The \nproposed Afghan Investment \nGuarantee Facility (AIGF) project ($5 \nmillion) will address key investment \nrisk concerns of private investors. \nThe Government has also requested \ninclusion of program support for \nfinancial market and private sector \ndevelopment ($80 million) in 2006. \n\nADB is also supporting private sector \ndevelopment directly through its \nprivate sector operations. ADB has \nassumed a 25% equity stake in the \nAfghanistan International Bank \n(AIB). AIB was opened for business \nin July 2004 and will support the \ngrowth and development of \nAfghanistan's banking sector.  ADB \nis also finalizing processing of $10 \nmillion supplemental guarantee \ncover for the AIGF project, as well as \nprocessing a $13 million investment \nin an edible oil processing venture in \nMazar-e-Sharif, a $35 million loan for \na telecommunications expansion \nproject, and an investment into a \nfund to encourage small and \nmedium enterprise (SME) \ndevelopment in Afghanistan. \n \n\nEuropean Commission (EC) has \nearmarked funds for reconstruction and \nrecovery assistance, including for \nfinancing of the Government\u2019s recurrent \nbudget, and for humanitarian \nassistance. EC will concentrate on four \nkey areas: (i) capacity building for public \nadministration reform; (ii) rural \ndevelopment and food security; (iii) \neconomic infrastructure, and  (iv) health. \nFinally, the EC will actively engage in \nthe promotion of democracy and human \nrights and the role of women. \n\nIMF technical assistance has focused on \nintroducing the new national currency, \npreparing new central bank and banking \nlaws, improving fiscal management and \nstatistical database. In March 2004, the \nGovernment and IMF agreed on a staff-\nmonitored program to maintain macro-\neconomic stability and pave the way to \nassistance a Poverty Reduction and \nGrowth Facility, possibly in early 2005. \nIMF support preparation of an action \nplan aimed at prioritizing policy, legal \nand institutional reforms to create an \ninvestment climate that helps accelerate \nprivate investment in Afghanistan. The \naction plan will cover privatization and \nsupport for SMEs. \n\nUNDP administers a fairly small \nprogram focused on SME development \nand trade facilitation. UNDP has also \nprovided support for training centers to \nenable women to acquire the skills, \nknowledge and know-how to start up \ntheir own small businesses, or generate \nincome through waged employment. \n\nWorld Bank support focuses on custom \nmodernization and harmonization, \nincluding capacity building of the \nMinistry of Commerce. To help increase \nrevenue from trade, reduce corruption, \nand prevent smuggling across its \nborders, the World Bank approved a $31 \nmillion IDA credit in 2003 aimed at \nhelping the government establish a \nmore efficient customs and transit \nregime. The World Bank Group has also \napproved assistance for the AIGF. In \naddition, IFC has approved an \ninvestment of $0.75 million in the First \nMicrofinance Bank of Afghanistan. \n\nGermany contributes to the \ndevelopment of the private sector \nthrough technical assistance by GTZ, \nincluding development of industrial \nparks, development of legal framework, \nfor SME development, and restructuring \nand capacity building of the Ministry of \nCommerce. Germany has also been \napproached for possible support for the \nproposed AIGF. \n\nJapan is providing significant grant \nassistance to address key security \nconcerns, including the disarmament, \ndemobilization and reintegration \nprocess. Japan has provides \nhumanitarian assistance and major \nsupport for community development \nprojects, including pilot projects for \neducation, health, and small-scale \nirrigation, through the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction, administered by the \nADB. Japan also contributes to the \nrestoration of transport infrastructure. \n\nUnited Kingdom, through DFID, \nsupports capacity building of key Afghan \nministries to manage the development \nprocess and establish an effective state, \nincluding rule of law. It also provides \nsupport to the livelihoods of the poorest \nAfghans, humanitarian aid to the most \nvulnerable groups, and initiatives to \ncreate alternatives to poppy cultivation.  \n\nUSAID has a large program focusing on \nprivate sector development through (i) \ndeveloping the enabling legislative, \ninstitutional and regulatory framework \nfor implementing policy, (ii) trade and \ninvestment promotion, (iii) export \npromotion, (iv) start of the WTO \naccession process, (v) restructuring and \ncapacity building of the Ministry of \nCommerce, and (vi) privatization, under \nthe Afghanistan Economic Governance \nProject.

MIGA will favor preventive measures \nover mitigatory or compensatory measures, whenever feasible. \n \n3.  \nEnvironmental  assessment  takes  into  account  the  natural  environment  (air,  water,  and \nland); human health and safety; and project-related social (involuntary resettlement, indigenous \ntransboundary,  and  global  environmental  aspects3. \npeoples,  and  cultural  property), \nEnvironmental  assessment  considers  natural  and  social  aspects  in  an  integrated  way.  It  also \ntakes  into  account  the  variations  in  project  and  country  conditions;  the  findings  of  country \nenvironmental  studies;  national  environmental  action  plans  and  the  country's  overall  policy \nframework and national legislation; the project sponsor's capabilities related to the environment \nand social aspects; and obligations of the country under international environmental treaties and \nagreements as these are relevant to the project. MIGA will not issue guarantees to projects that \nwould  contravene  such  country  obligations  as  identified  during  the  environmental  assessment. \nEnvironmental  assessment  should  be  initiated  as  early  as  possible  in  the  sponsor's  project \ndevelopment process, and is integrated closely with the economic, financial, institutional, social, \nand technical analyses of a proposed project. \n \nThe  applicant  is  responsible  for  carrying  out  the  environmental  assessment,  unless  the \n4. \napplicant  is  a  lender  or  minority  partner  in  the  project  (less  than  a  50%and  noncontrolling \ninterest  in  the  project).  If  a  lender  or  minority  partner,  the  applicant  will  be  required  to  provide \nMIGA  with  a  copy  of  the  project  sponsor's  environmental  assessment  of  the  project,  and \nsupplemental  information  deemed  necessary  by  MIGA  in  determining  that  the  investment  is \nenvironmentally  sound  and  sustainable.  For  Category  A  projects4  the  project  sponsor  should \nretain independent environmental assessment experts not affiliated with the project to carry out \nthe  environmental  assessment  to  avoid  a  potential  conflict  of  interest. For  Category  A  projects \nthat are highly risky, or contentious, or that involve serious and multidimensional environmental \nconcerns, the project sponsor should normally also engage an advisory panel5 of independent, \n\n                                                 \n1  In accordance with MIGA's Convention, this policy is Annex B to MIGA's Operational Regulations. \n2  The area of influence for any project is determined with the advice of environmental specialists and set out in the \n\nenvironmental assessment's terms of reference.  \n\n3  Global environmental issues include climate change, ozone-depleting substances, pollution of international waters, \n\nand adverse impacts on biodiversity.  \n\n4  For screening, see para. 8.  \n5  The  panel  advises  the  project  sponsor  on  the  following  aspects  as  appropriate:  (i)  the  terms  of  reference  for  the \nenvironmental  assessment  (ii)  key  issues  and  methods  for  preparing  the  environmental  assessment  (iii) \nrecommendations  and  findings  of  the  environmental  assessment;  (iv)  implementation  of  the  environmental \nassessment's  recommendations  (v)  development  of  environmental  management  capacity  and  (vi)  engineering \nmatters such as dam safety. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36\n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\ninternationally  recognized  environmental  specialists  to  advise  on  all  aspects  of  the  project \nrelevant  to  the  environmental  assessment.  The  role  of  the  advisory  panel  depends  on  the \ndegree  to  which  project  implementation  has  progressed,  and  on  the  extent  and  quality  of  the \nenvironmental assessment already completed at the time MIGA begins to consider the issuance \nof  a  guarantee  for  the  project.  If  the  environmental  assessment  for  a  Category  A  project  has \nbeen completed by the project sponsor with in-house expertise before the time MIGA considers \nthe issuance of a guarantee for the project, independent expertise must be engaged to review \nthe  environmental  assessment  for  potentially  significant  problems  in  the  analysis  due  to  the \npotential conflict of interest. \n \n5. \nMIGA  will  advise  the  applicant  on  MIGA's  environmental  assessment  requirements. \nMIGA  will  review  the  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  environmental  assessment  to \ndetermine whether they provide an adequate basis for a decision to offer a guarantee. When the \nproject sponsor has completed or partially completed environmental assessment prior to MIGA's \ninvolvement  in  a  project,  MIGA  will  review  the  environmental  assessment  findings  and \nrecommendations as provided by the applicant to ensure their consistency with this policy. To be \nable to make that determination, MIGA may require additional environmental assessment work, \nincluding public consultation and disclosure. \n \n6. \nThe  Pollution  Prevention  and  Abatement  Handbook  describes  pollution  prevention  and \nabatement  measures  and  emission  levels  that  are  normally  acceptable  to  MIGA.  However, \ntaking into account country legislation and local conditions, the environmental assessment report \nmay  recommend  alternative  emission  levels  and  approaches  to  pollution  prevention  and \nabatement for the project. The sponsor's environmental assessment report must provide full and \ndetailed  justification  for  the  levels  and  approaches  chosen  for  the  particular  project  or  site.  All \nalternatives  to  emission  levels  will  be  presented  by  MIGA  staff  to  the  Board  for  review  and \nconcurrence. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nDepending  on  the  project,  different  instruments  can  be  used  to  satisfy  MIGA's \nenvironmental assessment requirements. These may include environmental impact assessment \n(EIA),  environmental  audit,  hazard  or  environmental  risk  assessment,  and  an  environmental \naction plan. Environmental assessment applies one or more of these instruments, or elements of \nthem, as appropriate.6  \n \nC. \n \n8. \nMIGA  will  undertake  environmental  screening  of  each  investment  to  determine  the \nappropriate  extent  and  type  of  environmental  assessment  required.  MIGA  will  classify  the \nproposed  investment  into  one  of  three  categories  depending  on  the  type,  location,  sensitivity, \nand scale of the project; and the nature and magnitude of its potential environmental impacts. \n \n\nEnvironmental Assessment Instruments \n\nEnvironmental Screening \n\n(i)  \n\nCategory A. A proposed investment will be classified as Category A if the project \nis  likely  to  have  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  that  are  sensitive7, \ndiverse,  or  unprecedented.  These  impacts  may  affect  an  area  broader  than  the \n\n                                                 \n6  The objective of all these instruments is to provide MIGA with a (i) clear understanding of the sponsor's approach to \nenvironmental  mitigation  and  management,  and  (ii)  the  basis  for  requiring  specific  actions  as  conditions  for  a \nguarantee. \n\n7  A potential impact is considered \"sensitive\" if it is irreversible (e.g., lead to loss of a major natural habitat), adversely \n\naffects indigenous peoples, involves involuntary resettlement, or adversely affects significant cultural property. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n37\n\n \n(ii)  \n\nsites  or  facilities  subject  to  physical  works.  Environmental  assessment  for  a \nCategory  A  project  examines  the  project's  potential  negative  and  positive \nenvironmental  impacts;  compares  them  with  those  of  feasible  alternatives \n(including the \"without project\" situation); and recommends any measures needed \nto  prevent,  minimize,  mitigate,  or  compensate  for  adverse  impacts  and  improve \nenvironmental  performance.  For  a  Category  A  project,  the  project  sponsor  is \nresponsible  for  preparing  a  report,  normally  an  EIA  report,  that  includes,  as \nnecessary, elements of other instruments referred to in para. 7. \n\nCategory  B.  A  proposed  investment  will  be  classified  as  Category  B  if  the \nproject's  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  on  human  populations  or \nenvironmentally  important  areas  (e.g.,  wetlands,  forests,  grasslands,  and  other \nnatural  habitats)  are  less  adverse  than  those  of  Category  A  projects.  These \nimpacts  are  site-specific;  few,  if  any,  are  irreversible;  and,  in  most  cases, \nmitigatory measures can be designed more readily than for Category A projects. \nThe scope of environmental assessment for a Category B project may vary from \nproject to project8, but it is narrower than for of a Category A project. It examines \nthe  project's  potential  negative  and  positive  environmental \nimpacts  and \nrecommends  any  measures  needed \nto  prevent,  minimize,  mitigate,  or \ncompensate for adverse impacts and improve environmental performance. \n\n \n(iii)   Category C. A proposed investment will be classified as Category C if the project \nis likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts. Beyond screening, \nno further environmental assessment action is required for a Category C project. \n\n \nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\nD. \n \nFor  all  Category  A  projects9  during  the  environmental  assessment  process,  MIGA  will \n9. \nrequire  the  project  sponsor  to  consult,  or  to  have  consulted,  project-affected  groups  and  local \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  about  the  project's  environmental  impacts,  and  to  take \ntheir  views  into  account.  The  project  sponsor  should  initiate  such  consultations  as  early  as \npossible,  and  consult  with  such  groups  throughout  project  implementation,  as  necessary,  to \naddress  project-related  environmental  and  social  issues  that  affect  them.  In  cases  where  the \napplicant is not a majority partner in the project (i.e., less than a 50% and noncontrolling interest \nin the project), MIGA will request the applicant to provide information on appropriate steps taken \nby the project sponsor to achieve meaningful local consultation and disclosure. \n \n10. \nFor  meaningful  consultations  between  the  project  sponsor  and  project-affected  groups \nand local NGOs on all Category A projects, the project sponsor provides relevant material in a \ntimely  manner  in  a  form  and  language  that  are  understandable  and  accessible  to  the  groups \nbeing consulted. \n \n\n                                                 \n8  When  the  screening  process  determines,  or  national  legislation  requires,  that  any  of  the  environmental  issues \nidentified  warrant  special  attention,  the  findings  and  results  of  Category  B  environmental  assessment  may  be  set \nout in a separate report. Depending on the type of project and the nature and magnitude of the impacts, this report \nmay include, for example, a limited environmental impact assessment, an environmental mitigation or action plan, \nan  environmental  audit,  or  a  hazard  assessment.  For  Category  B  projects  that  are  not  in  an  environmentally \nsensitive  area  and  that  present  well-defined  and  well-understood  issues  of  narrow  scope,  MIGA  may  accept \nalternative  approaches  for  meeting  environmental  assessment  requirements:  for  example,  environmentally  sound \ndesign criteria, setting criteria, construction standards, or pollution limits.  \n\n9  Consultations with affected parties also are required by other safeguard policies regarding involuntary resettlement  \n\nof indigenous peoples for projects with potentially major adverse social impacts.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38\n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nImplementation \n\nThe  applicant  will  be  required  to  disclose  locally,  in  an  appropriate  manner,  the  EIA \n11. \nreport  for  Category  A  projects.  Specific  requirements  for  MIGA's  disclosure  of  environmental \ninformation  are  contained  in  MIGA's  disclosure  policy.10  If  a  project  sponsor  objects  to  MIGA's \nrelease  of  environmental  information  through  the  World  Bank  InfoShop,  MIGA  will  not  issue  a \nguarantee. \n \n12. \nIn  cases  where  the  Category  A  environmental  assessment  has  been  completed  before \nMIGA's  receipt  of  a  definitive  application,  or  the  project  is  already  approved  and  permitted  in \naccordance with host country environmental laws and regulations, MIGA will ascertain whether \npublic consultation and disclosure have been adequate with respect to MIGA's requirements. If \nnecessary,  MIGA  and  the  applicant  will  agree  on  a  supplemental  public  consultation  and \ndisclosure program to address any deficiencies identified by MIGA. \n \nE. \n \n13. \nAll  MIGA  guarantee  contracts  will  require  guarantee  holders  to  operate  throughout  the \nguarantee  period  in  compliance  with  the  host  country's  laws  and  regulations,  including \nenvironmental  laws  and  regulations,  MIGA's  environmental  policies  and  guidelines,  and  any \nother  specific  requirements  by  MIGA  as  per  para.3.06  in  MIGA's  Operational  Regulations. \nCompliance  with  host  country  laws  and  regulations  normally  will  be  confirmed  through \nwarranties  and  representations  as  per  standard  insurance  industry  practice.  Compliance, \nespecially  in  the  case  of  Category  A  projects,  will  be  verified  by  MIGA  through  requested \nmonitoring  reports,  site  visits,  or  other  measures  as  necessary  in  addition  to  warranties  and \nrepresentations.  Failure  by  the  guarantee  holder  to  respond  to  these  requests  or  to  abide  by \nsuch laws, regulations, or specific requirements gives MIGA the right to terminate the guarantee \nor to deny payment of a claim if the noncompliance is not corrected within a period set forth in \nthe Contract of Guarantee. \n \nF. \n \n14. \nEnvironmental action plan. An instrument which provides details of the measures to be \ntaken  during  the  implementation  and  operation  of  a  project  to  eliminate  or  offset  adverse \nenvironmental impacts or to reduce them to acceptable levels. Included are the actions needed \nto implement them. \n \n15. \nEnvironmental  audit.  An  instrument  to  determine  the  nature  and  extent  of  all \nenvironmental  areas  of  concern  at  an  existing  facility.  The  audit  identifies  and  justifies \nappropriate measures to mitigate the areas of concern, estimates the cost of the measures, and \nrecommends  a  schedule  for  implementing  them.  For  certain  projects,  the  environmental \nassessment report may consist of an environmental audit alone; in other cases, the audit is part \nof the environmental assessment documentation. \n \n16. \nEnvironmental impact assessment. An instrument to identify and assess the potential \nenvironmental  impacts  of  a  proposed  project,  evaluate  alternatives,  and  design  appropriate \nmitigation, management, and monitoring measures. An environmental action plan is an integral \npart of an EIA. \n \n17. \nEnvironmental  risk  assessment.  An  instrument  for  estimating  the  probability  of  harm \noccurring  from  the  presence  of  dangerous  conditions  or  materials  at  an  installation.  Risk \n\nDefinitions \n\n                                                 \n10    MIGA's  environmental  and  social  review  procedures  provide  specific  guidance  on  MIGA's  requirements  for  local \n\nconsultation and disclosure activities by the project sponsor or applicant.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n39\n\nrepresents the likelihood and significance of a potential hazard being realized; therefore, hazard \nassessment often precedes an environmental risk assessment, or the two are conducted as one \nexercise.  Environmental  risk  assessment  is  a  flexible  method  of  analysis,  i.e.,  a  systematic \napproach  to  organizing  and  analyzing  information  about  potentially  hazardous  activities  or \nsubstances  that  might  pose  risks  under  specified  conditions.  MIGA  routinely  requires  an \nenvironmental risk assessment for projects involvinghandling, storage, or disposal of hazardous \nmaterials and wastes in quantities above a specified threshold level; the construction of dams; or \nmajor construction works in locations vulnerable to seismic activity or other potentially damaging \nnatural  events.  For  certain  projects,  the  environmental  assessment  report  may  consist  of  the \nenvironmental risk assessment alone; in other cases, the environmental risk assessment is part \nof the environmental assessment documentation. \n \nHazard  assessment.  An  instrument  for  identifying,  analyzing,  and  controlling  hazards \n18. \nassociated  with  the  presence  of  dangerous  materials  and  conditions  at  an  installation.  MIGA \nrequires a hazard assessment for projects involving certain inflammable, explosive, reactive, and \ntoxic  materials  when  they  are  present  at  a  site  in  quantities  above  a  specified  threshold  level. \nFor  certain  projects,  the  environmental  assessment  report  may  consist  of  the  hazard \nassessment  alone;  in  other  cases,  the  hazard  assessment  is  part  of  the  environmental \nassessment documentation. \n \nProject area of influence. The area likely to be affected by the project, including all its \n19. \nancillary  aspects,  such  as  power  transmission  corridors,  pipelines,  canals,  tunnels,  relocation \nand  access  roads,  borrow  and  disposal  areas,  and  construction  camps,  as  well  as  unplanned \ndevelopments  induced  by  the  project  (e.g.,  spontaneous  settlement,  logging,  or  shifting \nagriculture  along  access  roads).  The  area  of  influence  may  include  (i)  the  watershed  within \nwhich  the  project  is  located,  including  the  affected  estuary  and  coastal  zone;  (ii)  off-site  areas \nrequired for resettlement or compensatory tracts; (iii) the air shed (e.g., where airborne pollution \nsuch  as  smoke  or  dust  may  enter  or  leave  the  area  of  influence);  (iv)  migratory  routes  of \nhumans,  wildlife,  or  fish,  particularly  where  they  relate  to  public  health,  economic  activities,  or \nenvironmental conservation; and (v) areas used for livelihood activities (hunting, fishing, grazing, \ngathering, agriculture, etc.) or religious or ceremonial purposes of a customary nature. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 8 \n\n8 SUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY (SPRSS)  \n \nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nA. \n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in the country poverty \npartnership agreement?   \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n  NA  \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Afghanistan:  \n\nThe proposed Project supports the Government\u2019s National Development Framework (NDF), which also serves as the \ncountry\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy.  Private  sector  development  is  explicitly  stated  as  one  of  the  NDF\u2019s  three \ndevelopment  pillars.  Private  sector  activities  are  the  main  source  of  income  and  employment  in  Afghanistan.  By \nimproving  income-generating  opportunities  in  the  private  sector  through  increased  investment,  the  proposed  Project \nwill  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  indirectly  lead  to  improvement  in  a  range  of  other  social  and  economic \nindicators  in  Afghanistan.  However,  no  separate  country  poverty  partnership  agreement  has  yet  been  concluded \nbetween ADB and the Government. \n\n \nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n\nProposed Classification:   Other \n\nNo poverty assessment has been prepared and no poverty partnership agreement (PPA) has been signed. Initiating \nand completing work on the preparation of a PPA will be synchronized with the preparation of a full country strategy \nand  program  (CSP),  presently  scheduled  for  2005.  Background  work  for  the  full  CSP,  including  data  collection  and \npreparation of sector road maps, was initiated last year. \n\nReliable  statistics  on  poverty  are  not  available  for  Afghanistan.  However,  various  estimates  place  at  60\u201380%  the \nproportion of the population living below the threshold of $1 a day or consuming less than the minimum requirement of \nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) of 2,453 kilocalories a day per capita.  \n\nThe  average  life  expectancy  is  only  about  40  years;  nearly  two  thirds  of  adults,  and  four  fifths  of  adult  women  are \nilliterate; 70% of the population are malnourished; and in 1999 less than one third of Afghan children were enrolled in \nschool. Particularly vulnerable are those without any source of food production, employment, or income. Nonmaterial \npoverty  as  reflected  in  physical  and  social  insecurity;  isolation;  marginalization;  alienation;  and  ethnic,  religious,  and \ngender discrimination pushes many Afghans further down the poverty ladder.  \n\nNo  systematic  study  has  been  done  on  the  factors  contributing  to  poverty  in  Afghanistan,  but  available  information \nsuggests that poverty is associated with low economic growth and the collapse of income-generating and employment \nopportunities due to the long period of war and civil strife, particularly in rural areas. Other factors likely pertain to the \ndistinctive features of the agro-ecological environment (e.g., frequent droughts), state of natural resource degradation, \nland  ownership  and  tenure,  loss  of  livestock  and  destruction  of  orchards,  access  to  water  and  agricultural  inputs, \navailability  of  off-farm  employment  opportunities,  refugee/displacement  status,  gender,  ethnicity,  household  status \n(e.g., with female head or not, educational attainment), and physical disability. \n\n \nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nStakeholder analysis prepared: \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nStudies  on  private  sector  development  in  Afghanistan  have  been  prepared  by  ADB,  ADB  Institute,  World  Bank, \nGovernment  of  Afghanistan  and  other  organizations.  On  the  policy  level,  the  NDF  signals  the  Government\u2019s \ncommitment  to  pursuing  a  broad-based  and  participatory  growth  strategy,  and  the  Government  is  committed  to \nparticipatory processes in policy formulation. On the project level, immediate stakeholders including the international \ninvestment community and Afghan diaspora have been consulted. \n\nIs there a participation strategy? \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\nParticipation strategy: \n\nStrengthen the Afghanistan Investment Support Agency (through bilateral grant funding on a parallel basis) as the key \ninstitution to interface with private sector investors and stakeholders, and work with other key ministries, agencies and \nstakeholders in preparing private sector development strategies and initiatives. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n41\n\nGender Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n\nThe project is expected to be gender neutral.
