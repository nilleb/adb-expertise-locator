It  will  enable  people  to  resume  their  normal  lives  by \nrestoring  access  to  livelihoods  and  basic  infrastructure.  The \nproject design is based on (i) the post-flood joint damage and \nneeds assessment, led by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in \nOctober\u2013November 2008, with the participation of United Nations \n(UN) agencies; and (ii) the Government\u2019s preliminary estimate of \nflood  damage.  The  Government\u2014supported  by  UN  agencies, \nbilateral  partners,  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)\u2014\nresponded effectively in the initial phase of the disaster. However, \n47,000  people  remain  displaced  in  temporary  accommodation, \nand damage to infrastructure and livelihoods has been severe. \nThe Project has been designed in coordination with central and \nlocal governments in recovery activities to move effectively from \nthe humanitarian relief activities of the Government, UN agencies, \nand NGOs to recovery and reconstruction. The Project supports \nincreased disaster preparedness and mitigation of damage from \nfuture recurrent floods by enhancing the Government\u2019s disaster \nmanagement  capacity,  and  improving  the  disaster  recovery \nsystem in cooperation with the Government of India. \n   \nRationale  The devastating 2008 floods\u2014affecting 300,000 people mainly in \nthree  districts\u2014caused  severe  damage  to  livelihood, \ninfrastructure, and other assets. They also disrupted economic \nactivities, inflicting heavy losses to crops and slowing expansion in \nindustries and services. The combined losses of the floods in both \nregions are estimated at $88 million. Direct losses to assets and \noutput because of flooding amount to $30 million; indirect losses \nare  estimated  at  $58  million.  The  floods  slowed  progress  in \npoverty reduction, with the poor and the vulnerable suffering most \nin terms of losses to crops, livestock, property, and housing; and \nreduced income opportunities. \n   ", "ii   \nImpact and Outcome  The  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  restore  economic  activities \nquickly, mainly in the three districts; and to improve the livelihoods \nof about 300,000 people seriously affected by the 2008 floods. It \nwill contribute to sustainable economic growth by minimizing the \ndevastating  impact  of  the  floods  and  reduce  future  risk  from \nsimilar disasters. The Project will focus on augmenting incomes \nand self-reliance by reviving agriculture in the affected farmland \nand  restoring  the  livelihoods  of  affected  persons,  as  well  as \nrehabilitating infrastructure. The interventions were identified in \nconsultation with the Government, NGOs, and other civil society \norganizations; and involve community participation. The Project \nincludes  mitigation  of  damage  from  future  recurrent  floods  by \nenhancing  cost-effective  construction  specifications  of \nrehabilitated infrastructure, and supporting capacity building and \nthe Government\u2019s disaster preparedness. It has five parts. \n \n  Part  A:  Agriculture. Restore the livelihood of affected people \nthrough revival of agriculture by distributing seeds and compost to \ngrow  crops  suitable  for  sandy  soil,  as  well  as  basic  farm \nequipment\u2014supported by extension services, skills development \ntraining, and social mobilization. It will also rehabilitate fishponds \nand  minor  irrigation,  distribute  fingerlings,  and  reconstruct \nagriculture collection centers and marketplaces.   \n \nPart B: Irrigation. Rehabilitate damaged structures of 2 large and \n25  small  surface  irrigation  systems,  including  25  head  works; \n127 kilometers (km) of canals; 196 canal structures such as drain \nsyphons, aqueducts, gates, outlets, and inlets; 36 km of canal \nservice  roads;  45  culverts  and  small  bridges;  1  medium-sized \nbridge; and 700 shallow tube wells.    \n \nPart C: Water Supply and Sanitation. Rehabilitate 28 gravity \nflow water supply systems in Kailali and Kanchanur, construct \n4 small overhead water supply systems, and install 3,500 shallow \ntube wells in Sunsari to provide access to drinking water and \nsanitation facilities. A health and hygiene awareness program will \nbe integral to part C.  \n \nPart D: Roads. Rehabilitate damaged strategic roads in the far \nwestern region, including bridge and culvert protection works and \nlandslide stabilization works; and provide alternative access to the \nfar-eastern region by constructing the Koshi bridge at Chatara \nwith the objective of minimizing the damaging impact of similar \npotential floods in the entire eastern region of the country.  \n \n  Part E: Project Management. To ensure efficient implementation \nand management of project activities, provide adequate staff at \nthe  project  coordination  office  (PCO)  to  support  project \nsupervision and monitoring, and capacity building for preparing \nthe strategies and actions needed to prevent and mitigate future \nfloods in the project districts.

The  PSC  will  include \n ", "iv   \nrepresentation from the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, \nMinistry of Finance, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Local \nDevelopment,  Ministry  of  Water  Resources,  National  Planning \nCommission, DOA, DOI, DWSS, Department of Water Induced \nDisaster Prevention (DWIDP), and DOR. The project coordinator \nwill act as member secretary of the PSC. ADB may be invited by \nMPPW to attend PSC meetings as an observer. The PSC will \nmeet  at  least  six  times  in  the  first  year  and  as  and  when \nnecessary in subsequent years, but not less than once a quarter. \nTo coordinate the planning and execution of various components \nacross the sectors, a national project management coordination \ncommittee (NPMCC) will be established with representation from \neach project implementation unit (PIU). The PCO will coordinate \nNPMCC meetings, which will be held monthly. \n   \nProcurement  Since the value of individual civil works contracts will be relatively \nsmall and they will be widely scattered in disaster-affected areas, \nthey are not likely to attract international contractors\u2014except for \nbridge  construction,  which  requires  international  competitive \nbidding.  National  procurement  of  civil  works  will  follow  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Act,  2007,  and  Public \nProcurement  Regulations,  2007,  which  are  both  generally \nacceptable to ADB; and ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement (2007, \nas amended from time to time). The flexibility provided in ADB\u2019s \nDisaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004) will be used \nwhere applicable. \n   \nConsulting Services  At  the  outset  of  the  Project,  the  PCO  will  recruit  7  individual \nconsultants  to  advance  project  preparatory  activities.  This  will \ninclude 98 person-months of national consultants on an individual \nbasis for services in project management, benefit monitoring and \nevaluation,  procurement,  financial  management,  social \ndevelopment, resettlement, and environment management. The \nPCO  will  also  recruit  5  individual  consultants  to  review  the \ninstitutional  aspect  of  flood  mitigation  work  and  draw  up  the \nstrategies  and  actions  needed  to  prevent  and  mitigate  future \nfloods.  This  will  include  8  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services of a river morphologist for 6 months and an \ninstitutional development specialist for 2 months; and 32 person-\nmonths  of  national  consultants,  including  an  institutional \ndevelopment specialist, a river engineer, and a river hydrologist.  \n \n  Given  the  tight  implementation  schedule,  the  IAs\u2019  uneven \ninstitutional  capacity,  and  the  need  for  accelerated  project \nimplementation, the Project includes four design and supervision \nconsultant packages, one  firm  for  each  sector,  with  a  total  of \n464 person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  The \nconsultants will assist the IAs with overall implementation; and \nensure quality of civil works, governance, risk assessment and \nmanagement,  and  other  related  areas.  Consulting  firms  and \nindividual consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s ", "  v\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime  to  time)  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging consultants. At the request of the Borrower, ADB has \nagreed to select the consultants on behalf of the Borrower for \ndesign  and  construction  supervision  of  the  project  activities  in \neach  sector.  Considering  the  urgency  and  need  to  expedite \nproject implementation, the consultants will be engaged through \nthe consultants' qualifications selection method as provided for \nunder  the  guidelines.  Subject  to  the  Government  taking \nresponsibility  for  selection  and  engagement,  the  single  source \nselection method is an acceptable selection method in the context \nof emergency rehabilitation. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The project parts are expected to be technically feasible and cost-\nBeneficiaries  effective, and represent a least-cost alternative with appropriate \nadjustment  for  flood  resistant  designs.  The  economic  analysis \nindicates that the economic internal rate of return for subprojects \nis 24.5%. The economic benefits of the restoration activities are \nthose accrued at the time of initial construction, but mostly lost \nbecause of flood damage. Project-financed restoration will bring \ninfrastructure back to original productivity and efficiency. While \nmost restoration works will aim to meet immediate emergency \nneeds, the restoration of permanent structures will improve their \nability to withstand future floods. \n \nThe project design includes features that will help reduce poverty \ndirectly or indirectly. It will provide short-term employment to poor \nwomen  and  men  in  skilled  and  unskilled  labor-intensive \nconstruction works needed for rehabilitation of damaged road and \nirrigation  infrastructure.  All  sectoral  support  will  have  poverty \nimplications  by  recruiting  flood-affected  people  to  rehabilitate \ndamaged  infrastructure  and  land,  and  by  improving  public \nservices which will have direct impact on affected people\u2019s lives. \nThe support will help people directly or indirectly to mitigate risks \nof likely impoverishment. \n \n  The  project  parts  in  four  major  sectors\u2014agriculture,  irrigation, \nwater and sanitation, and roads\u2014will contribute to reducing the \nvulnerability and risks of affected people, who are displaced, poor, \nand  disadvantaged.  Social  mobilization  activities  and  group \norganization will improve the management capacity and influence \nof the poor and disadvantaged in the reconstruction of damaged \nirrigation and water supply infrastructures, increasing their access \nto services.  \n \n  Construction  of  a  permanent  Koshi  bridge  at  Chatara  and \nrehabilitation of strategic roads will contribute to transportation of \ngoods  and  services  to  the  market\u2014creating  employment \nopportunities for the poor. Support for income generation activities \nwill be extended to the landless and poor farmers based on their \ndemand. \n   \n ", "vi   \nRisks and Assumptions  According to the Government\u2019s return strategy for Koshi flood-\ndisplaced people, the Government assumes that 60% of currently \naffected people will return immediately with the return package, \nand 15% of people with high-level damage to their home and \nfarmland  will  return  within  6  months.  These  people  will  be \nprovided employment opportunities from ongoing ADB projects \nand rehabilitation projects. However, about 25% of the people \nhave little prospect of an immediate return to their previous area \nsince deep siltation and deep water have prevented their land \nfrom being recovered, and some are landless people. ADB is \nworking with the Government and other development partners to \nidentify  sustainable  resettlement  options  for  the  significant \npercentage of displaced people.   \n   \nA  potential  risk  is  that  procedural  delays  in  obtaining  various \ngovernment approvals will slow implementation. The Government \nhas shown strong commitment to the Project and will arrange \nsimplified procedures. Delays at the executing agency (EA) level \nwill be minimized through the selection of an EA with considerable \nexperience in implementing ADB-financed projects and familiarity \nwith ADB procedures, implementation by an established PCO, \nand consultant selection by ADB. In the past, the availability of \ncounterpart funding has been a problem in ADB projects in Nepal. \nThe Ministry of Finance has assured that counterpart funds would \nbe provided to IAs on a timely basis.  \n \nGovernance-related  issues,  including  corruption,  constitute \nanother  risk.  This  is  addressed  by  selecting  all  subprojects; \ntransparent  implementation  and  monitoring  mechanisms;  and \nspecific financial controls, including regular as well as random \naudits. Measures will include strict construction supervision and \nstrong  consultant  support,  use  of  the  Public  Procurement \nRegulations, close monitoring by ADB staff, and random auditing \nof procurement and annual performance at the EA level. The PSC \nwill be supported by monitoring and evaluation specialists from \nMPPW and will be supported by two external consultants who will \n(i)  help  monitor  all  project  activities,  (ii)  conduct  random  spot \nchecks during project implementation, and (iii) provide capacity \nbuilding in key areas of monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n  A fourth risk is recurrence of major disasters and related extensive \ndamage.  This  is  addressed  by  adopting  cost-effective  flood-\nresistant  design  standards  for  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and \nstrengthening the capacity of DWIDP for flood preparedness and \nan early warning system, which are expected to reduce damage \nfrom future floods. The risk of inadequate maintenance will be \naddressed by the Government of Nepal in close coordination and \nongoing policy dialogue with the Government of India. \n \n ", "82o  00'E 88o  00'E\nNEPAL\nEMERGENCY FLOOD DAMAGE\n30 o 00'N REHABILITATION PROJECT 30 o 00'N\nFAR-WESTERN\nDEVELOPMENT HUMLA MID-WESTERN\nREGION Simikot DEVELOPMENT\nREGION\nDARCHULA N\nDarchula PEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nMAHAKALI OF  CHINA\nBAJHANG\nGamgadhi\nBAITADI Chainpur BAJURA MUGU 0 20 40 60 80 100\nPatan SETI Martadi\nDadeldhura KARNALI\nSilgarhi Jumla WESTERN Kilometers\nDADELBDhaHtkUaRndAa Dipaya Mangalsen KALIKOT JUMLA DOLPA DEVELOPMENT\nDOTI ACHHAM Manma MUSTANG REGION\nDunai\nBanbasaMahendranagar\nDAILEKH JAJARKOT Jomson\nKANCHANPUR GodawariMasuliyaBabiyachour DBailHekEhRJIajarkot RUKUM DHAWALAGIRI ChMamANeANG DEVCEELNOTPRMALENT\nDhangadhi Kol MYAGDI REGION \nKAILALI BGAuRlaDriIyYaA SUBRiPreKantHadnEraTnaSgiatdriSpaAtLiYSAaNlyanLRiwAanPgTRIOLPPAYUTHANBAGLUBNaGgluBnKegunPsiAhmRBaAT KPAokShKaIra GLAANMDJBUAeNsKGisIaharGORKHA DhuncheBARGASMUAWTAI DEVEREAELSGOTIEPORMNNENT\nBANKE Tulsipur Pyuthan GULMI Gorkha SINDHUPALCHOK\nGorahi Tamghas SYANJA TANAHU Bidur NUWAKOT Chautara\nNepalganj DANKGrLisahmnaanhaiSgKaaATnAradRPuikGIlihLhHaBarAwAkKaaSLHTumAUNbBiCnhiaBHRiruITaUtahwPinwaAsaleNnSDuEnLaHuUIliPNMAABLWPPIAANaLrIaPsSAiyRaAnjSaBIaruwMaeMghuCagHulilnIiTNgWaNrAaAyNLaRonhAgPDaaYHAtHrhheARaAtrSaNDBuAIIhdNiaTmNGhpaaeunLdbkAioisLteDITaKPkasUKhkRaainKntkhBiAaPmlHTiABaKHAhLnAKMaSAdkBTiNAnuBtAHadCNaBpPhRrHDhhuuUEiarOUmlibRmKeiRssaeaRhdmwAiaeMrcEcChCDahHpaOJHriLirkiAAoPOKtKHOHAkhAaLldDShHuOUnLgNUaKGSKHaAHOllUeTDrMAiikNBteGUlBBSHhAOoNjJBpKPauHsUraURnKWtphuATarSnEdARbTBHaeHrArihATaPHnhTUthuAMunPmgMLliEnEPgJChUidHNimGI\n27 o 00'N Project District Pathlaiya BMAARKAWANPUR JANAKPUSRINDHULI SAGARMATHA Dhankuta PANCHTAR Ilam27 o 00'N\nNational Capital Birganj Kalaiya SARLAHI Dhalkebar UDAYAPUR DHANKUTA ILAM\nDToiswtrnic/Mt Harekaedt qCueanrtteerrs I   N   D   I   A Raxaul RAUTAHGAauTr MalangawaDHANUSHA SIRAHA Gaighat DShUarNaSnARIKOSMaHikIhola Kakarbhitta\nNational Highway MAHOTTARI JanakpurSLiarhaahna SAPTARI Itahari MORANGChaJnHdAraPgAadhi\nJaleswar Rajbiraj Rangeli\nFeeder/District Road Biratnagar\nRiver Jogbani\nDistrict Boundary\nZonal Boundary\nRegional Boundary\nInternational Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n0\n9\n-11\n0\n0 H 82o  00'E 88o  00'E\nR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Nepal for the Emergency Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis  \n1.  Floods and Impact of Climate Change \n2.  Nepal, one of the poorest countries in Asia and the Pacific, is highly vulnerable to \nrecurrent floods and landslides. Extreme topographical variations and unstable steep slopes \ncombined  with  torrential  rain  during  the  monsoon  season  result  in  frequent  floods  and \nlandslides. These disasters cause heavy loss of life and property, and damage infrastructure, \nthereby disrupting the social and economic development of the country.  \n \n3.  In addition to these natural processes, development activities and increasing population \nhave  caused  further  vulnerability  and  destabilization  of  land  resources.  Human-induced \nvulnerability stems from activities such as deforestation, cultivation of marginal lands and slope, \nroad construction in hills and mountains, and encroachment of floodplains. The water-induced \ndisasters  have  been  occurring  more  frequently  in  recent  years.  Statistics  indicate  that \n7,300 people lost their lives in floods from 1983 to 2007.      \n \n4.  Water-induced disasters in Nepal are usually triggered by extreme weather events and \nare  often  associated  with  heavy  rainfall  during  the  monsoon.  Rainfall  events  exceeding \n300 millimeters (mm) in a day, which disturb both slope and channel equilibrium on a region \nscale, occur frequently in the country. The increasing frequency of such extreme precipitation \nevents, together with changes in snow and ice cover caused by global warming and other \nfactors, have led to an increase in the number of water-induced disasters in the country.  \n \n2.  Disaster Management \n5.  The Department of Water Induced Disaster Prevention (DWIDP) was established in \n2000 under the Ministry of Water Resources. DWIDP is responsible for managing and mitigating \nwater-induced disasters. The Natural Disaster Relief Act, 1982 (amended in 1989 and 1992), \nprimarily  provides  the  legislative  framework  for  disaster  management.  However,  national \ndisaster relief regulations need to be formulated as the act does not describe the duties and \nresponsibilities of all the disaster management agencies other than the Ministry of Home Affairs. \nDWIDP plans to construct infrastructure for mitigating predictable disasters in 20 districts and \nestablish  a  flood  warning  system  for  the  whole  country  by  2017.1 The  floods  and  flood \nmanagement in Nepal are described in Appendix 2.  \n \n6.  The hydro-meteorological systems of mountain areas are very complex and are poorly \nunderstood.  Nepal\u2019s  hydro-meteorological  network  is  still  poor;  the  existing  observational \nnetwork is not capable of capturing the diversity of the mountain landscape, and there are \ndifficulties in characterizing weather because there is little long-term data. Better data collection \nwith modeling and forecasting could eventually help reduce damage to life and property. \n \n                                                 \n1  Water and Commission Secretariat. 2005. National Water Plan. Nepal. ", "2 \n7.  There are more than 6,000 streams and rivers in Nepal. Most of the large rivers in Nepal \nhave a river treaty between the Government of Nepal and the Government of India. For the \nKoshi River, the Koshi Project Agreement, which was signed in 1954 by the Government of \nNepal and the Government of India and amended in 1966, resulted in the Government of India \nconstructing  the  Koshi  barrage,  head  works,  other  appurtenant  works,  embankment  and \nprotective works for the purpose of flood control, irrigation, generation of hydropower, and \nprevention of erosion. The treaty allows the Government of India to carry out surveys and \nmaintenance works. However, the condition of the embankment has deteriorated because of \nannual sedimentation from watershed with rugged and high-angle slope, and poor maintenance \nof the embankment and protective works. To prevent potential breach of the embankment in the \nfuture, its safety needs to be assessed regularly and monitored closely.   \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Impact of the 2008 Floods \n8.  On 18 August 2008, the Koshi River breached its embankment and shifted its course. \nThis caused some 47,000 people to be displaced in Nepal, about 5,000 hectares (ha) of \nfarmland to be damaged, and 14 kilometers (km) of road in different places along the East\u2013\nWest  Highway  to  be  badly  damaged.  Likewise,  incessant  heavy  rainfall  from  19  to \n21 September caused floods and landslides in the districts of the far western region (including \nKailali, Kanchanpur, Dadeldhura, and Doti) and in the mid-western region (including Bardiya, \nBanke,  Dang,  and  Salyan  districts).  This  disaster  affected  43,500  families  and  physical \ninfrastructure in the regions. The response of the Government and development partners was \nquick and efficient in Sunsari and Saptari as well as in the far western region. The Government \ncontinues to lead response operations through the district disaster relief committees (DDRCs), \nwith the chief district officer (CDO) coordinating between local authorities and the line ministries. \nThe work of the international humanitarian community in both regions is being coordinated \nthrough a cluster system formalized by DDRC. \n \n9.  On 19 October 2008, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to lead a post-flood damage and needs assessment in the areas of roads, bridges, \nculverts, embankments, agriculture, irrigation, electricity, health clinics, educational institutions, \nwater supply, drainage and sewerage systems, and housing in order to assist the Government \nto prepare rehabilitation works. Following the Government\u2019s official request, ADB organized a \nconsultation meeting with government agencies and development partners to discuss the flood \ndamage and needs assessment mission and fielded the assessment mission from 31 October \nto  9  November  2008.  The  assessment  mission  produced  a  final  report  (Supplementary \nAppendix A).   \n \n10.  Social  Impacts. Some 31% of Nepal\u2019s population still lives below the poverty line. \nPoverty  declined  from  42%  to  31%  from  FY1996  to  FY2004,  but  with  increasing  regional \ndisparity and unequal distribution among different population, caste, and ethnic groups. Poverty \nlevels are still high in the remote mid-western (45%) and far western regions (41%), compared \nwith 27% in western and central regions and 29% in the eastern region. The Koshi flood-\naffected district Sunsari covered under the Project is in the eastern region. The other two \ndistricts are located in the far western region. In a national human poverty index ranking, \nSunsari is 8th out of 75 districts, Kanchanpur is 15th, and Kailali is in 24th place.2  \n                                                 \n2  The human poverty index seeks to measure the degree of deprivation in these areas by examining five attributes of \npoverty: illiteracy, malnutrition among children, early death, poor health care, and poor access to safe water. \n \n ", "3 \n \n11.  In Kailali and Kanchanpur, 7,000 families of the displaced were living near rivers. The \nmost affected people were Mukta Kamaiya (freed bonded labors) and marginalized indigenous \npeople.  Shreepur,  Haripur,  Laukahi,  and  Paschim  Kusaha  village  development  committees \nVDCs (village development committees) of Sunsari were severely hit. Disadvantaged group \nmapping\u2014based on food sufficiency, access to health and education, prevalence of vulnerable \nand  marginalized  groups\u2014shows  Shreepur  VDC  as  the  most  disadvantaged  followed  by \nHaripur, Pashim Kusaha, and Laukahi.  \n \n12.  It is estimated that 40% of people displaced by the Koshi flood will not be able to return \nhome without a resettlement plan. More than 35,000 farm households have been adversely \naffected  in the  three  districts,  directly  increasing  risks  in  people\u2019s  long-term  livelihoods.  In \nSunsari, people who lost houses and could not return home have become unemployed because \nof the heavy sand siltation in their farmland and loss of property. This situation is worst in \nShreepur VDC as 80% of VDC land has been covered by sand. The flood affected both poor \nand nonpoor households, and farmers with both small and large land holdings. However, the \npoorest, landless, and marginalized were hardest hit and suffer higher threats to likely food \ninsecurity, diseases, unemployment, loss of income, and personal security. Women, children, \nand the elderly have been negatively affected in terms of health, nutrition, and personal security.  \n \n13.  Macroeconomic Impacts. The floods have had a devastating impact on local people, \nespecially in the Koshi area, disrupting livelihoods and household incomes\u2014especially of those \nwho suffered loss of their standing crops estimated at $18.7 million and livestock estimated at \n$2.1 million. The floods have also had a negative impact on manufacturing and transport \nactivities in eastern Nepal as the East\u2013West Highway was damaged, cutting off the region from \nthe rest of the country. However, although these impacts are quite significant from the local \nperspective, they are assessed moderate in the national context, reducing the Government's \n7.0% gross domestic product growth target for FY2009 by 0.3 percentage points.   \n \n14.  The  floods  will  also  have  fiscal  implications.  Although  the  FY2009  budget  has \nprovisioned  NRs2.5  billion  for  flood-related  relief,  rehabilitation,  and  reconstruction \nexpenditures,  it  remains  unfunded.  Further,  additional  relief  expenditures  can  be  expected \nbecause of the slower-than-expected resettlement of the flood-affected people. The additional \nexpenditure will add 0.2 percentage points to the 3.3% of gross domestic product budget deficit \nestimated for FY2009 budget because of the unfunded budgetary provision and the additional \nfunds for an extended resettlement period.  \n \n15.  The floods caused temporary shortage and price hikes of food and other commodities in \nthe flood-affected areas, especially in the eastern region. However, the impact on the national \ninflation is expected to be minimal given the small production loss relative to national output and \ndemand, the reasonably good summer crop harvest across the country, and supply alternatives \nfrom India. While overall inflation has been rising in recent months, it is not attributable to the \nfloods. Inflation was already on the rise even before the floods (since July 2008) because of \nrising  international  oil  and  food  prices.  However,  although  international  prices  and  India\u2019s \ninflation (to which Nepal\u2019s inflation is closely linked) have declined in recent months, Nepal\u2019s \ninflation has risen on a year-on-year basis to mid-January 2009 compared to 5.8% in 2008. This \nis mainly due to high transportation costs and acute power shortages, causing some supply \nconstraints, and the delayed impact of falling inflation in India. Inflation is, however, expected to \nsubside to reach an average of 10% for FY2009, higher than the Government\u2019s initial target of \n7.5%.  \n \n ", "4 \n16.  Environmental Impacts. When the Koshi River changed its course toward the east, \nbreaching  1.7  km  of  its  left  embankment,  it  deposited  silt  on  the  flood-affected  area  and \nadjoining four VDCs (Lauki, Pashim Kushaha, Madhuban, and Shreepur), covering 5,282 ha of \nland. In the far western region, major rivers such as the Mahakali, Shihali Nala, Dhodhara, and \nBanara carried sediment loads from catchments, contributing to river bank erosion, notably \ninside Sukhaphat Wildlife Reserve by the Mahakali River at Simla Phat and Barkaula Post. \nWaterlogging caused loss of vegetation on farmlands and recharged the groundwater table in \nvarying depths. \n \n17.  The floods and landslides have drastically affected habitats of wildlife, aquatic, flora, and \nfauna  of  the  Koshi  Tappu  Wildlife  Reserve  in  Sunasari  and  Sukhaphat  wildlife  reserve  in \nKanchanpur. After the floods and landslides, displaced people (including migrants from the hilly \nregions) have begun encroachment in the forest for natural resources and livelihood. The \nestimated forest encroachment in Kailali district is about 1,000 ha.3 The poor living environment, \nincluding  health,  sanitation,  and  safety  issues  of  the  displaced  people  in  this  area,  were \nobserved.  \n \n2.  Immediate Relief and Recovery \n18.  The Government. The response of the Government and development partners was \nquick and efficient in Sunsari and Saptari as well as the far western region. The DDRC in \nSunsari district was already holding an emergency meeting hours before the river broke the \nembankment and many people living beside the embankment on 18 August 2008 had started \nmoving out when the river entered the villages. The displaced people moved to nearby schools \nfor safety, and several camps were built in safer areas. A total of 328 shelters were built in the \nJhumka  camp,  followed  by  245  shelters  in  the  Lauki  camp.  Additional  shelters  were \nsubsequently built in other places. The DDRC promptly started delivering food and nonfood \nitems donated by the humanitarian agencies.  \n \n19.  In the far western region, several temporary camps were established following the floods \nof 20 September 2008. Nepal Army, Nepal Police, Armed Police Force, People\u2019s Liberation \nArmy,  and  locals  were  widely  mobilized  in  the  rescue  operations.  DDRCs  in  Kailali  and \nKanchanpur districts took the lead in the relief effort. From the central level, the Central Natural \nDisaster Relief Committee (CNDRC) decided on 21 September 2008 to deploy two Nepal Army \nhelicopters in the rescue operation. In the initial phase, food items were distributed by Nepal \nRed Cross Society (NRCS) to the displaced people living in camps and local schools.   \n \n20.  The Government continues to lead response operations in Sunsari and Saptari districts \nthrough DDRCs and CDOs by coordinating between local authorities and the line ministries. On \n4 September 2008, the Government declared a State of Emergency in 10 VDCs in Sunsari and \n1 VDC in Saptari, making it easier for CDOs to take prompt actions as needed. At the regional \nlevel, the Saptakoshi Disaster Management Coordination Cell was established to monitor and \ndirect  the DDRCs.  At  the  central  level,  CNDRC,  chaired  by  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs, \noversaw the response effort and prepared the return strategy plan for the Koshi flood-displaced \npeople in December 2008 (Supplementary Appendix I).  \n \n21.  DDRCs are also the lead agencies in rescue and relief operations in the far western \nregion,  supported  mainly  by  NRCS.  DDRCs  distributed  food  items  for  the  initial  15  days \nfollowing  the  floods.  The  United  Nations  (UN)  World  Food  Programme  (WFP)  has  been \n                                                 \n3  Livelihood DFO Report, 2008 \n ", "5 \nproviding food since then. Local governments constructed roads in certain affected areas for \nimmediate use, and connected damaged transmission lines and telecommunication facilities.  \n \n22.  On the budgetary front, the Government has earmarked NRs2 billion for rehabilitation of \nthe Koshi flood victims. It has also decided to allocate NRs5 million for Kailali; NRs1.5 million for \nAchham; NRs1 million for Dadeldhura; and NRs0.5 million for Doti, Bajhang, and Bardiya. \nDonations  from  individuals  and  private  organizations  were  collected  through  the  Prime \nMinister\u2019s Flood Relief Fund.   \n \n23.  Government of India. The Government of India, which is responsible for maintenance \nof the Koshi barrage and embankment under the Koshi Project Agreement, responded by \nproviding NRs320 million as immediate relief to flood-affected people in Saptari and Sunsari \ndistricts. In addition, the Government of India agreed to rebuild a damaged segment of the \nEast\u2013West  Highway  and  rehabilitate  the  damaged  embankment  by  March  2009.  The \nGovernment of India mobilized a contractor to divert water flow and restore the embankment. \nThe breached embankment is expected to be rehabilitated by the end of March 2009.    \n \n24.  Development Partners. The work of the international humanitarian community in both \nregions  is  being  coordinated  through  a  cluster  system  formalized  on  9  September  2008. \nClusters have been established for health (World Health Organization [WHO]); nutrition (United \nNations Children's Fund [UNICEF]); water, sanitation, and hygiene (UNICEF); food assistance \n(WFP);  education  (UNICEF  and  Save  the  Children);  protection  (Office  of  the  High \nCommissioner  for  Human  Rights)  with  a  subgroup  on  child  protection  (UNICEF);  camp \ncoordination and camp management (International Organization of Migration); and emergency \nshelter (International Federation of Red Cross). The clusters coordinated by the United Nations \nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs responded to the needs of flood-affected \npeople as shown in Appendix 3. The World Bank funded two barges to provide temporary \ntransport to cross the Koshi River.  \n  \n25.  In Sunsari and Saptari, WFP has been providing food items and will continue to do so \nuntil June 2009. In Kailali, development partners distributed 1,877 nonfood Item sets through \nNRCS, while 1,200 nonfood item sets were provided in Kanchanpur. WFP has been providing \nfood  items  (such  as  rice,  lentils,  cooking  oil,  and  salt)  after  the  initial  15  days  that  the \nGovernment provided those materials. \n  \n26.  National  and  local  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  NRCS  are  playing  a \ncritical role in the immediate response in Sunsari and Saptari districts, working closely with UN \nagencies. The role of NRCS has largely been to facilitate the distribution of relief materials \nobtained from government agencies and development partners. NRCS is also playing a critical \nrole  in  the far  western  region,  collecting  and  providing nonfood  items.  In  both  Kailali  and \nKanchanpur, affected persons expressed gratitude to NRCS for its promptness in delivering \nservices.  \n \n27.  ADB. The response of ADB to the 2008 floods was prompt. Upon the Government's \nrequest to lead the floods damage and needs assessment mission in consultation with other \ndevelopment partners, an assessment mission was undertaken from 31 October to 9 November \n2008. The mission held an inception meeting at MOF, chaired by the secretary, which further \ndiscussed the scope of the mission, its field visit schedule, the methodology of the damage and \nneeds assessment, and the Government\u2019s support for the mission. The mission first visited the \nflood-affected Sunsari district in the eastern region and held discussions with the Sunari and \nSaptari CDOs, district-based sector line agencies, local NGOs, development partners, and local \n ", "6 \ncommunities.  It  also  visited  Kailali  and  Kanchanpur  in  the  far  western  region  and  held \ndiscussions with CDOs, district-based sector line agencies, NGOs, and local communities. \nDuring the field visits, the mission members collected damage information and verified damages \nby  visiting  sample  sites.  Based  on  the  mission\u2019s  final  report,  on  22  December  2008,  the \nGovernment requested ADB to prepare an Emergency Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project. \nADB fielded a fact-finding mission for the proposed project from 12 to 28 January 2009. In \naddition, ADB approved the Government\u2019s requests for providing livestock inputs for the flood-\naffected  people  from  the  ongoing  Community  Livestock  Development  Project 4  and  for \nrehabilitation of damaged local roads and community infrastructure, including school buildings \nand  health  clinics,  under  the  ongoing  Rural  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation  Sector \nDevelopment Program and Project.5      \n \n28.  Current Status. Although the Government, Government of India, development partners, \nUN  agencies,  and  national  and  international  NGOs  provided  an  immediate  response  for \nhumanitarian relief to the flood-affected people, they remain displaced. The Koshi river flow was \ndiverted to the original river course in late January 2009, 6 months after the flood. The repair of \nthe breached embankment is still ongoing and is expected to be completed in March 2009. The \nGovernment expects about 36,000 people to return to their homes by March 2009 and about \n9,000 people to return by June 2009. However, about 15,000 landless people are waiting for the \nGovernment\u2019s plan to resettle them. To facilitate transportation, the Government installed two \nferries with limited capacity at Chatara ferry site, but they are only operational during the dry \nseason. The affected people believe that the whole embankment remains vulnerable to be \nbreached by similar floods in the future. \n \n3.   Financing Needs for Disaster Damage Rehabilitation \n29.   Preliminary estimates indicate that direct damage to assets and indirect losses in the \nthree districts in the eastern and far western regions amount to $87.73 million. About one-third \nof this was direct damage and two-thirds indirect losses. \n \n30.  Damage and losses were concentrated in the transport sector ($36.9 million or 42% of \nthe total), agriculture and livestock sector ($22.9 million or 26% of the total), and housing and \nsettlement sector ($9.7 million or 11%). The high damage in the transport sector is due to \nextensive damage of about 14 km of road along the East\u2013West Highway from a breach in the \neastern embankment of the Koshi River, which contributed to high indirect losses, mainly from \ndisruption of transportation of goods and services. \n \n31.  The financial requirement for the recovery program has been identified at $71.20 million \nbased on the damage and needs assessment. A total of $24.01 million is required for short-term \nneeds, and the remaining $47.19 million is needed for the medium term. The Government is \nalready  financing  the  short-term  need  of  about  $7.00  million  ($3.52  million  in  transport, \n$2.00 million  in  agriculture,  $0.84  million  in  communication,  and  $0.53  million  in  local \ninfrastructure  and  others).  The  Government  of  India  also  committed  $5.27  million  for \nrehabilitation of the breached embankment. A shortfall of $11.74 million in short-term need \nrequires financial support. In the medium term, the shortfall is $43.67 million and requires \nfinancial assistance as the Government provided $3.52 million for the roads sector.  \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2003.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Nepal for the Rural Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Sector Development Program and Project. \nManila. \n ", "7 \n4.  Rehabilitation Assistance Program \n32.  An integrated, multipronged approach for economic recovery of the affected area, and \nfor reconstruction of destroyed physical assets, is required to ensure the protection of the most \nvulnerable members of society and to resume socioeconomic development in the affected \nregions. The Government requested ADB to prepare the medium-term recovery program for \nsustainable production in agriculture, and reconstruction of infrastructure with improved risk \nresistance capacity in roads, water supply and sanitation, and irrigation. \n  \n33.  ADB Strategy. ADB has an integrated policy for managing its disaster and emergency \nassistance, which links the phases of the disaster management cycle, from prevention and \nmitigation through preparedness and recovery. The policy emphasizes not only responding after \nthe disaster strikes, but also supporting activities that anticipate and mitigate the likely impact of \ndisasters that might occur. However, ADB\u2019s mandate does not allow the institution to engage in \nhumanitarian relief as other international aid agencies, NGOs, and the UN normally assume \nthese functions. ADB\u2019s disaster and emergency assistance activities will be implemented within \nthe context of working more closely with the Government to help it adopt a new approach that \nemphasizes preventive measures. ADB\u2019s assistance instruments are portfolio restructuring and \nuse of loan savings and emergency assistance projects. Based on the policy, the recovery \nproject will also emphasize preventive measures to minimize the impact of future floods.     \n \n34.  Portfolio  Management  and  Restructuring.  In  formulating  ADB\u2019s  flood  recovery \nassistance project, government capacity, the possibility for loan portfolio restructuring, and \npotential use of loan savings under ongoing projects were carefully assessed in line with ADB\u2019s \nDisaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004).6 The portfolio assessment was made in light \nof the 2008 country portfolio review,7 and in close coordination with concerned government \nagencies.  Since  2006,  ADB  has  placed  particular  emphasis  on  regularly  identifying  and \ncanceling  Asian  Development  Fund  loan  savings  by  examining  the  physical  and  financial \nprogress  of  ongoing  projects  and  adjusting  their  scope  and  design.  Thus,  the  scope  for \nidentifying additional loan savings by restructuring the existing Asian Development Fund loan \nportfolio is limited. Nonetheless, savings identified under four projects, amounting to $5.60 \nmillion, were canceled for utilization under the Nepal country program allocation. \n  \n35.  Coordination in Recovery Program. While the Government has approved several acts \non good governance in recent years\u2014including the Public Procurement Act and Regulations, \n2007;  Financial  Procedures  Rules,  2007;  and  Local  Body  Financial  Administration  Rules, \n2007\u2014lack of coordination, efficiency, and accountability in central and local governments was \nidentified as a major challenge in delivering humanitarian relief and an early recovery program. \nThe UN agencies provide all technical support to the local governments and supported the \nCNDRC in coordinating cluster programs.  \n \n36.  Promoting  local  service  delivery  and  active  participation  of  key  stakeholders  could \nimprove coordination in disaster recovery activities and deliver quick and tangible benefits. A \ncommunity-driven  development  approach  for  all  Koshi  flood-related  activities  has  been \nintroduced in Sunsari district through the relief and rehabilitation program implementation unit \nestablished under the district office. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \nsupports district development committees and VDCs by providing adequate staff resources for \nstrengthening the RRU and better coordination among service providers so that early recovery \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2004.

Available: Lotus \nNotes database LNADBG1.  \n7  Ministry of Finance, 2008, Nepal Portfolio Performance Review, Kathmandu. \n ", "8 \nand  medium-term  recovery  programs  can  be  implemented,  as  demonstrated  by  better \ncoordination in humanitarian relief.  \n \n37.  Lessons in Disaster Management and Flood Rehabilitation. Although Nepal has a \nNational Disaster Relief Act, 1982, its regulations need to be developed to improve coordination \namong the agencies dealing with disaster management. UNDP plans to prepare the regulations, \nwhich  will  be  assisted  by  the  proposed  Project.  In  addition,  disaster  preparedness  and \nemergency management cannot solely depend on experts in these fields as the frequency of \ndisasters is high and locations are scattered. Making the public aware of possible hazards and \nusing their participation in an early warning system becomes very important in fighting against \ndisasters. Public awareness programs and awareness sessions in the school curriculum need to \nbe introduced. In addition, ADB is planning to undertake a disaster vulnerability assessment as \npreparation for the new country partnership strategy, which will provide recommendations for \nrisk mitigation measures in future ADB operations. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n38.  The objective of the Project is to restore quickly economic activities mainly in the three \ndistricts\u2014Kailali,  Kanchanpur,  and  Sunsari  districts\u2014and  improve  the  livelihood  of  about \n300,000 people seriously affected by the 2008 monsoon floods. It will contribute to sustainable \neconomic growth by minimizing the devastating impact of the floods and reduce future risk for \nsimilar disasters. The Project will focus on augmenting incomes and self-reliance through (i) the \nrevival of agriculture in the affected farmland and restoration of livelihoods of the affected \npeople, and (ii) the rehabilitation of infrastructure. The Project supports capacity building and the \nGovernment\u2019s  disaster  preparedness  by  developing  a  flood  forecasting  system  and  early \nwarning system in the Koshi river area.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n39.  The  Project  comprises  five  parts:  agriculture  (A),  irrigation  (B),  water  supply  and \nsanitation (C), roads (D), and project management (E). The Project will strengthen partnerships \nand synergies with other development partners. \n  \n40.   Part A: Agriculture. This part will help restore the livelihoods of affected people through \nrevival of agriculture by distributing seeds and compost to grow crops suitable for sandy soil in \nthe affected area, as well as basic farm equipment. The distribution of the agriculture inputs will \nbe provided to farm families whose lands have limited silt deposit or have cleared high silt \ndeposit by themselves. This will be supported by extension services, skills development training \nfor farming on sandy soil, and social mobilization. This part will also rehabilitate fishponds and \nminor irrigation, distribute fingerlings, and reconstruct agriculture collection centers and market \nplaces in the affected area. Training and material support will be provided to improve the quality \nof soil, crop, and water management. Combined with the irrigation component, about 8,500 \nfamilies comprising 42,500 people are estimated to benefit directly. Detailed project activities \nare in Appendix 4.    \n \n41.  Part B: Irrigation. This part will reconstruct and rehabilitate the damaged structures of \n2 large and 25 small surface irrigation systems. This will involve improvement of 25 head works; \n127 km of main, branch, and tertiary canals; 196 canal structures such as drains, aqueducts,  \ngates,  outlets,  and  inlets;  36  km  of  canal  service  roads;  45  culverts  and  small  bridges; \n1 medium-sized bridge (on canal service road); and necessary protection works for the above \n ", "9 \nstructures.  This  part  will  also  include  rehabilitation  of  700  shallow  tube  wells  and  a \nsupplementary surface irrigation system, which will provide irrigation to 13,060 ha of land. \nDetailed project activities are in Appendix 5.   \n \n42.  Part C: Water Supply and Sanitation. The expected benefits of this part are hygiene \nimprovements in the flood-affected areas, reduced pollution of groundwater and surface water, \nand access to drinking water. This part will rehabilitate 28 gravity flow water supply systems in \nKailali and Kanchanur, and construct 4 small overhead water supply systems and install 3,500 \nshallow tube wells in Sunsari to provide access to drinking water and sanitation facilities. For \nSunsari district, this part is designed to complement the Government\u2019s return package for \nreturnees to meet needs for drinking water and sanitation facilities.8 Social mobilization for a \nhealth and hygiene education and awareness program is integral to this part. The gravity flow \nwater supply system and small overhead water supply systems will be designed to give the \ndisadvantaged and poor adequate access to drinking water and sanitation, and will be operated \nand maintained by the respective communities. Detailed project activities are in Appendix 6.   \n \n43.  Part D: Roads. This part comprises rehabilitation of damaged strategic roads in the far \nwest region, including protection works for bridge and culvert and landslide stabilization works. \nIn the Koshi area, all damaged local roads under the responsibility of the Ministry of Local \nDevelopment will be rehabilitated under the ongoing Rural Reconstruction and Rehabilitation \nSector Development Project financed by ADB at a cost of $4 million. Major works in the Koshi \narea under the Project will focus on providing an alternative access road for strategic road \nnetworks under the responsibility of the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) for \nemergency preparedness, with the aim of minimizing the damaging effect of similar potential \nfloods in the entire eastern region of the country. As the Department of Roads (DOR) is \noperating two ferries to cross the Koshi River with limited capacity, the Government requested \nADB  to  substitute  them  with  a  permanent  bridge  over  the  Koshi  River  at  Chatara.  The \npermanent bridge would provide a reliable alternative transport route, linking the eastern part of \nthe country with the western part, and preventing possible negative impacts in case of similar \nfloods in the future. This conforms with the damage and needs assessment report and the \nGovernment\u2019s recovery strategy. DOR assured MOF that construction of the proposed bridge \nwould be completed within 3 years. Detailed project activities are in Appendix 7.   \n \n44.  Part E: Project Management. To ensure efficient implementation and management of \nproject activities, a new project coordination office (PCO) with adequate staff from the Executing \nAgency  (EA)  will  be  supported  by  consulting  services  and  required  logistics.  Individual \nconsultants will be engaged to support project supervision and monitoring, and capacity building \nfor preparing the strategies and actions needed to prevent and mitigate future floods in the \nproject districts. A capacity-building program for DWIDP will be undertaken (Supplementary \nAppendix B). A series of socioeconomic studies that focus on evaluation of the Project\u2019s impact \non poverty reduction will be carried out, including a benchmark study at the start of the Project, \na follow-up study in the third year, and a final study at the end of project implementation. \n   \nC.  Special Features \n45.  Improved Livelihoods of the Affected People. The Project will lead to restoration of \nincomes for 11,700 affected families: 7,700 families through agricultural input supports and an \nadditional 4,000 families through reconstructed irrigation schemes. Through the rehabilitation of \n                                                 \n8 Return  package  designed  to  support  initial  return  of  displaced  people  together  with  additional  inputs  from \nGovernment and other humanitarian agencies. Each household is to be provided with the return package of \nNRs50,000 in installments basis. \n ", "10 \nsurface irrigation, the provision of shallow tube wells for irrigating uneven farmlands, extension \nservices  for  crops  suitable  for  sandy  soils  and  input  supply  for  their  start-up,  and  the \nrehabilitation of fishponds, the incomes of families are expected to increase by NRs1,300 per \nfamily within 3 years. Much of the agricultural support will be geared to obtaining incomes from \nland that has been heavily silted and that now requires different technologies to provide farming \nincomes.  In  addition  to  project  activities,  ongoing  ADB-financed  projects\u2014the  Community \nLivestock  Development  Project  and  the  Rural  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation  Sector \nDevelopment Project\u2014will improve the livelihoods of affected people by providing livestock for \nthe disadvantaged group, and rehabilitating rural roads and community infrastructure in the \naffected areas.   \n \n46.  Disaster Preparedness. As it is the ADB's first disaster rehabilitation project for Nepal, \nthe Project will initiate activities related to disaster preparedness. The PCO under the direction \nof the project steering committee (PSC) will analyze lessons learned from past floods and, \nthrough a consultative process, draw up strategies and actions needed to prevent and mitigate \nfuture floods. The strategies and actions will be incorporated in a disaster preparedness action \nplan. ADB\u2019s disaster vulnerability assessment for the new country partnership strategy will \nstrengthen the capacity of the Government's disaster preparedness and early warning system. \nTraining will be provided to staff of the flood related agencies to improve flood awareness and \npreparedness. Civil works envisaged under the Project will provide greater flood protection for \nroads, bridges, and irrigation works; and the construction of an alternative route to the East\u2013\nWest Highway through Chatara will provide a fail-safe east\u2013west transport link to prepare for \nfuture floods in the Koshi River.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n47.  The project investment cost is estimated at $32.00 million, including taxes and duties of \n$3.19 million financed by the Government (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 8 \nand the details of the project investment plan are in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n  Item  Amounta \n  Base Costb    \n    Part A: Agriculture   3.86 \n    Part B: Irrigation    8.77 \n    Part C: Water Supply and Sanitation    4.56 \n    Part D: Roads     12.10 \n    Part E: Project Management   1.53 \n        Subtotal   30.82 \n    Contingencies  1.18 \n            Total  32.00 \na  Includes taxes and duties of $3.19 million financed by the Government. \nb  In January 2009 prices. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n48.  The Government has requested a grant of $25.60 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources to help finance the Project. The Government will finance the remaining project cost of \n ", "11 \n$6.40 million equivalent, including taxes and duties of $3.19 million (Table 2).

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management  \n49.  The EA for the Project will be MPPW. To support the EA, a PCO will be established at \nMPPW and will coordinate with the IAs and the line ministries, including the National Planning \nCommission. It will be headed by a full-time project coordinator. The PCO will (i) prepare the \noverall  project  implementation  plan  and  consolidated  annual  work  plan,  (ii)  assist  project \nimplementation units (PIUs) in preparing estimates for annual budget and contract packaging, \n(iii) conduct a series of socioeconomic studies, (iv) monitor all project management activities, \n(v) organize monitoring and evaluation of project activities, (vi) maintain proper accounting for all \nproject expenditures for auditing, (vii) manage and replenish the imprest account, (viii) prepare \nnecessary progress reports and submit to the PSC and ADB, and (ix) prepare the project \ncompletion report for submission to ADB. The project coordinator will be supported by a full-time \ndeputy project coordinator. The PCO will be properly staffed and assisted by consultants with \nexpertise  in  engineering,  finance,  accounting,  monitoring,  and  evaluation.  The  project \nmanagement structure is in Appendix 9. \n \n50.  The IAs for the Project will be as follows: Department of Agriculture (DOA) for part A \n(agriculture); Department of Irrigation (DOI) for part B (irrigation); Department of Water Supply \nand Sewerage (DWSS) for part C (water supply and sanitation); and DOR for part D (roads). \nEach IA will be responsible in its respective sector for (i) preparation of the annual work plan, (ii) \ndesign and approval of civil works, (iii) preparation of tender documents for civil works and \ngoods and approval of respective contracts, (iv) appointment of consultants, and (v) submission \nof progress reports to the EA. A separate PIU will be established in each IA and provided with \nadequate staff, resources, and logistical support. Each PIU will be headed by a project director. \nThe PIU concerned will be responsible for preparation, submission, approval, implementation, \nand benefits monitoring and evaluation of all subprojects. In each project district, subproject \nimplementation units (SPIUs) for each sector will be established to implement project activities \nin the respective districts.  \n \n51.  A PSC, chaired by the Secretary of MPPW, will be established within 1 month of grant \neffectiveness to provide overall project coordination and facilitate project implementation. The \nPSC includes representatives from Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, MOF, Ministry of \nHome Affairs, Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of Local Development, National Planning \nCommission, DOA, DOI, DWSS, DWIDP, and DOR. The project coordinator will act as member \nsecretary of the PSC. ADB may be invited by the Government to attend PSC meetings as an \nobserver. The PSC will meet at least six times in the first year; thereafter, it will meet as and \n ", "12 \nwhen needed, but not less than three times a year. To coordinate planning and execution of \nvarious components across the sectors, a national project management coordination committee \n(NPMCC) will be established with representation from each PIU. The PCO will coordinate \nNPMCC meetings, which will be held monthly.  \n \n52.  In each project district, a local project coordination committee will be established under \nthe chief district officer to coordinate project activities. Each SPIU will participate in the meetings \nof  the  existing  relief  and  rehabilitation  program  implementation  unit  to  coordinate  project \nactivities with other flood-related activities supported by the Government and other development \npartners. The relief and rehabilitation program implementation unit was established under the \ncoordination of the district office in Sunsari to coordinate all Koshi flood-related activities.  \n  \n53.  Good implementation arrangements for agricultural input distribution need to be in place \nto implement part A effectively. Although project implementation and procurement have been \ndecentralized to district agriculture development offices (DADOs), which have demonstrated \ntheir capacity in procurement and implementation of field programs. Consultants should be \nmobilized in time to support DADOs in procurement of agricultural inputs and their distribution to \naffected families whose lands have limited silt deposit or have cleared high silt deposit by \nthemselves. Over-procurement should be avoided, but inputs should reach farm families on time \nusing systematic procedures. DADOs will consult closely with DDRCs and UNDP, which will \nprovide adequate staff for strengthening local government agencies at districts, villages, and \nwards. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n54.  As the Project is for emergency assistance, project implementation will be substantially \ncompleted in 36 months, i.e., tentatively by 30 June 2012. Because of the inability to undertake \ncivil works during the wet season, and taking into account the country\u2019s weakened absorptive \ncapacity in remote areas, the project period is extended by 1 year beyond the 2-year project \nperiod generally expected under ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. A 3-year \nproject implementation period is also justified as Nepal is in a post-conflict situation. The agreed \nimplementation schedule recognizes the critical importance of restoring key infrastructure as \nmuch as possible before the onset of the next rainy season in July 2009. The implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n3.  Procurement \n55.  Procurement of works, goods, and services will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). ADB\u2019s procedures for providing \nrehabilitation assistance after disasters provide for flexible interpretation of these guidelines, so \nthat project activities can start promptly. Generally, national procurement will be the preferred \nmode for all civil works because of the relatively short implementation period, small size of \ncontract packages, wide geographic spread of the project sites, and need for local awareness \nand community participation. \n \n56.  However,  procurement  of  civil  works  contracts  with  estimated  values  greater  than \n$1 million will be carried out in accordance with international competitive bidding procedures, \nand contracts with estimated values of $1 million or less will be procured in accordance with \nnational competitive bidding procedures and generally be in accordance with the Government\u2019s \nPublic Procurement Regulations; Public Procurement Act; and ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \nShopping will be used for works exceeding $30,000 but no more than $100,000. All small and \n ", "13 \nwidely dispersed civil works of up to $30,000 will be undertaken mainly by the community, \nfollowing ADB's community participation guidelines.  \n \n57.  ADB\u2019s portfolio experience in Nepal indicates that national contractors have adequate \ncapacity to undertake such contracts. ADB will review and approve all contracts with estimated \nvalues exceeding $100,000 equivalent. National competitive bidding for civil works will follow the \nsingle-stage, one-envelope procedure with post-qualification and a bidding period of 21 days. \nTo encourage the participation of communities and local residents, especially women, and \nprovide  them  with  employment  opportunities,  small  earthworks  with  an  estimated  cost  of \n$30,000 or less may be awarded, in line with past practices for projects of a similar nature, to \nuser groups in accordance with community participation in procurement procedures acceptable \nto ADB. The procurement plan of the Project is in Appendix 11. \n \n58.  All the IAs will strictly adhere to the Public Procurement Regulations\u2019 specified time limits \nfor evaluating and awarding contracts. Contract variations will be discouraged and be subject to \nprior ADB approval, except in special circumstances for particular contracts for strong technical \nand economic reasons to maximize social and economic benefits. \n \n59.  Given the urgency of the Project, ADB approved advance action for the procurement of \ngoods, services, and works and the recruitment of consultants, provided the advance actions \ntake place on or after 12 January 2009, the starting date for the project fact-finding. ADB \nadvised the Government that approval of such advance action does not commit ADB to finance \nany part of the Project. \n \n60.  The  Project  provides  for  retroactive  financing  of  immediate  rehabilitation  of  key \ninfrastructure  and  facilities,  and  for  consulting  services.  ADB  Management  has  agreed  to \nprovide  retroactive  financing  for  a  maximum  30%  of  the  total  loan  amount  for  eligible \nexpenditures incurred not earlier than 18 August 2008 (date of disaster in Koshi river area). \nRetroactive  financing  will  be  approved  under  the  following  conditions:  (i)  procurement  is \nundertaken in accordance with the Government\u2019s procedures, (ii) contracts and recurrent costs \nare  certified  by  the  EA,  and  (iii)  the  certification  is  acceptable  to  ADB.  ADB  advised  the \nGovernment that provision of retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any part of \nthe Project. \n \n4.  Consulting Services  \n61.  Given the tight implementation schedule, the IAs\u2019 uneven institutional capacity, and the \nneed for accelerated project implementation, consulting services will be required to support \nproject implementation. At the outset of the Project, the PCO will recruit 7 individual national \nconsultants to advance project preparatory activities for a total of 98 person-months of national \nconsultants on an individual basis for services in project management, benefit monitoring and \nevaluation,  procurement,  financial  management,  social  development,  resettlement,  and \nenvironment management. The PCO will also recruit 5 individual consultants to review the \ninstitutional aspect of flood mitigation work and draw up the strategies and actions needed to \nprevent  and  mitigate  future  floods,  including  8  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices of a river morphologist for 6 months and an institutional management and development \nspecialist for 2 months; and 32 person-months of national consultants, including an institutional \ndevelopment specialist, a river engineer, and a river hydrologist. Four design and supervision \nconsultant packages, one firm for each of sectors, are included with a total of 464 person-\nmonths  of  national  consulting  services.  The  procurement  plan  is  in  Appendix  11and  the \nconsultants\u2019 terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n ", "14 \n62.  The consultant packages for design and construction supervision of the project activities \nin each component will be procured using the consultants\u2019 qualifications selection method. \nSubject to the Government taking responsibility for selection and engagement, single source \nselection is an acceptable selection method in the context of emergency rehabilitation. The \nconsultants will support the IAs with day-to-day project implementation, including (i) detailed \nassessment and verification of damage; (ii) preparation of assessment reports for safeguard \nrequirements  for  individual  subprojects;  (iii)  preparation  of  plans,  detailed  designs, \nspecifications, and cost estimates; (iv) preparation of bid and contract documents; (v) evaluation \nof bids and contract awards; (vi) supervision of construction quality, cost and schedule control, \nmeasurement, and approval of contractors\u2019 work and progress claims; (vii) monitoring of works \nto ensure quality control and transparency among contractors and communities carrying out \nsmaller works; (viii) issuance of completion certificates; and (ix) oversight of works.  \n \n63.  The IA concerned will sign all the contracts for consultants, who will be recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of national consultants. \nSince the Project must be completed within 36 months, expeditious selection and fielding of the \ndesign  and  construction  supervision  consultants  will  be  necessary.  Accordingly,  ADB  has \nagreed with the Government on the consultants\u2019 qualifications selection method for all the \nconsulting services packages. To expedite project implementation, the Government and ADB \nagreed that ADB will select a consulting firm on behalf of the Government using the consultants\u2019 \nqualifications  selection  method.  Consultants\u2019  performance  will  be  closely  monitored,  with \nparticular attention to quality of work and vigilance in the field to accelerate contract execution \nfor  timely  completion,  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  contract  period.  Continuity  of  key \nconsultants and senior field engineers should be strictly adhered to, in accordance with the \nagreed personnel schedule and work program in respective consultant contracts. To expedite \nthe implementation of construction of Koshi Bridge at Chatara, ADB agreed to fund the design \nof the bridge from the ongoing Road Connectivity Sector I Project. 9 \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy  \n64.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  Executing  Agency.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the grant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \n65.  The Project incorporates several specific anticorruption measures, including (i) strict \nfinancial  management  with  full  adherence  to  monitoring  and  reporting  systems;  (ii)  strict \ncompliance with Public Procurement Act and Regulations of 2007, and Local Body Finance \nAdministration Regulations of 2007; (iii) allowing third party monitoring of all subprojects; and \n(iv) random and independent spot checks of implementation by ADB and PCO.  \n \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n ", "15 \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n66.  All  disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). An imprest account for the Project will be established in \nNepal Rastra Bank, the central bank. The ceiling for the imprest account is $2.5 million, which \nshould not exceed estimated eligible expenditure for 6 months to be financed through the \nimprest account or 10% of the grant amount, whichever is lower. The statement of expenditures \n(SOE) procedure will be used to reimburse expenditures and liquidate advances under the \nimprest account. The ceiling for payment under the SOE procedure is $100,000. The EA will be \nresponsible for managing and administering the account and SOE in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n67.  The EA has implemented ADB projects for more than 20 years and is implementing nine \nprojects at present. The Project, however, includes a financial management specialist and a \nprocurement specialist in the PCO to strengthen project implementation of the emergency \nassistance project and the capacity of the EA, and effectively oversee financial transactions. \n \n68.  Accounts and Audit. The EA will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to \nidentify the goods and services financed by the loan proceeds, financing received, expenditures \nincurred, and use of local funds. The account will be maintained in accordance with sound \naccounting principles. Consolidated project accounts and related financial statements will be \naudited annually by the auditor general. The audited reports and related financial statements in \nEnglish should provide an audit opinion on the financial operations of the imprest accounts and \nSOEs and be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after the end of the fiscal year because \nof project implementation in remote project areas by multiple IAs.  \n \n69.  Reports.  While  the  PCO  will  monitor  overall  implementation  progress,  the  EA  will \nprepare brief progress statements and submit these to the PSC with a copy to ADB at the end \nof each quarter. In addition, each IA will submit monthly reports to the PCO in order to enable \nthe PCO to prepare quarterly progress reports. The project performance monitoring system will \nbe established within 3 months of grant effectiveness. Within 3 months of physical completion of \nthe Project, the Government will provide ADB with a project completion report providing detailed \nevaluation of the project design, costs, performance of contractors and consultants, social and \neconomic impacts, and other details.  \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n70.  The EA will establish the project performance monitoring and evaluation system within \n3 months of grant effectiveness. Baseline indicators and targets for each sector and subproject \nwill be developed within 3 months of grant effectiveness prior to implementation for monitoring \npurposes. The data will be disaggregated by gender, caste, and ethnicity. The outputs will \nprovide inputs to the Project\u2019s quarterly progress reporting for results monitoring of the design \nand monitoring framework of the Project in Appendix 1. \n \n9.  Project Review \n71.  ADB will conduct regular reviews throughout project implementation. Given the relatively \nshort implementation period and emergency nature of the Project, no midterm review will be \nconducted unless ADB and the Government deem it necessary. \n \n ", "16 \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Benefits \n72.  Based on experience from similar earlier projects providing emergency assistance, the \nproject components are expected to be technically feasible and cost-effective, and represent a \nleast-cost alternative with appropriate adjustment for flood resistant designs. Analysis shows an \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 16% for agriculture, 30% for irrigation, 26% for water \nsupply and sanitation, 24% for roads, and a project EIRR of 25%. These calculations include \nproject  implementation  expenses  for  each  component  and  expenses  to  ensure  proper \nmaintenance of rehabilitated infrastructure. Project-financed restoration will bring infrastructure \nback to original productivity and efficiency. Benefits calculated for agriculture for damaged land \nareas are based on a changed use of land. While most restoration works will aim to meet \nimmediate emergency needs, restoration of permanent structures will improve their ability to \nwithstand future floods.  \n \n73.  Through the displacement of families and lowered production on farmland, it is estimated \nthat 4,870 persons have become unemployed\u201432% of the original workforce on the affected \nland. The civil works programs envisaged under the Project will provide work for up to 60% of \nthe unemployed. Within 1 year of project completion, it is expected that economic production \nand employment will have returned to pre-flood levels. A summary of economic analysis is in \nAppendix 12 and detailed economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nB.  Poverty and Social Impacts \n74.  Poverty  Impact. The project design includes features that will help reduce poverty \ndirectly or indirectly. It will provide short-term employment to poor women and men in skilled \nand unskilled labor-intensive construction works, in rehabilitation of damaged road and irrigation \ninfrastructures. All sectoral support will have poverty implications by rehabilitating damaged \ninfrastructure and farmland, and improving services. The support will help people directly or \nindirectly to mitigate risks of likely impoverishment. A summary of the poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy in Appendix 13. \n \n75.  Social  Impact.  The  project  components  in  four  major  sectors\u2014roads,  irrigation \ninfrastructure, agriculture, and water and sanitation\u2014will contribute to reducing the vulnerability \nand  risks  of  the  affected  people,  displaced,  poor,  and  disadvantaged.  Social  mobilization \nactivities will be integrated, which will improve the group organization and management capacity \nof  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  in  reconstruction  of  damaged  irrigation  and  water  supply \ninfrastructures, empowering them to access services. Gender and social inclusion guidelines \nand a detailed action plan will be developed based on the gender equality and social inclusion \naction plan (Supplementary Appendix J) to ensure benefits to women and marginalized groups. \n \n76.  Agriculture support will be provided to the poor and affected farmers free of cost for up to \n2 years so that they will be able to restore farm work and income. Irrigation measures will be \ntaken to cope with the immediate need for restoring the land and to support livelihoods by \nproviding shallow tube wells, which will benefit the poor and marginal farmers. Rehabilitation of \nfarmer-managed  irrigation  facilities  and  large  irrigation  schemes  will  help  regain  long-term \nsustainability of the agriculture production, providing benefits to all users. \n \n77.  Water supply and sanitation activities will rehabilitate damaged schemes by improving \nquality, and extend the services to the poor and marginalized groups. Access to drinking water \nand sanitation will help women and poor households save time for other economic activities and \n ", "17 \nreduce their work burden. In all four affected VDCs in Sunsari, a water supply service will be \nprovided through a phased approach, which will complement the Government\u2019s return package. \nSocial  mobilization  will  be  integrated  in  the  component  to  ensure  social  inclusion  in  user \ncommittees in terms of gender, caste, ethnicity, and other disadvantaged groups.  \n \n78.  Construction of a permanent bridge on the Koshi River and rehabilitation of strategic \nroads will contribute to transportation of goods and services to the market, creating employment \nopportunities for the poor.  \n \n79.  Employment Generation. Rehabilitation of the highway and rural roads will contribute \nto smooth transportation of goods and services to the market and facilitate economic activities, \ncreating employment opportunities for the poor. Support for income-generation activities will be \nextended to the landless and poor farmers based on their demand. \n \nC.  Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement \n80.  The Project involves rehabilitation and improvement of infrastructure such as roads, \nirrigation, water supply, and other small agricultural infrastructure. While most rehabilitation \nworks are expected to be limited within their existing corridor of impacts, some may require \nadditional  land  and/or  involve  resettlement  impacts.  The  improvement  of  roads,  additional \nstructures  for  protection  of  roads/bridges,  realignment  of  roads  and  irrigation  canals,  and \nconstruction  of  overhead  water  supply  reservoirs  may  need  additional  land  and  cause \nresettlement impacts.  \n \n81.  A  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared,  providing  policy  and  procedures  to \nscreen, assess, and plan for land acquisition and resettlement aspects of project components in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). An involuntary resettlement \nframework  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  The  resettlement  framework  includes  an \nentitlement matrix covering all potential losses, and provides compensation at replacement cost \nand rehabilitation support for affected people. If project components involve any land acquisition \nand resettlement impacts, a resettlement plan will be prepared based on the detailed design of \nthe project infrastructure during implementation. The resettlement plans will be developed in \nconsultation with affected people, publicly disclosed to affected people, submitted for ADB\u2019s \napproval, and posted on the websites of ADB and the EA. The resettlement plans will outline \ndetailed arrangements for their implementation, monitoring, evaluation, and grievance redress. \nThe compensation for land acquisition and resettlement will be completed before award of the \ncivil works contracts, while other rehabilitation and income-generation activities may continue \nduring project construction. The EA will provide semiannual progress reports to ADB on the \nimplementation of the resettlement framework/resettlement plan(s), which will also be posted on \nthe EA and ADB websites.  \n \n82.  The IAs will assign a senior government official as a resettlement officer and recruit a \nresettlement  consultant  to  assist  in  overall  coordination,  planning,  and  monitoring  of \nresettlement  aspects  under  their  respective  sectors.  The  design  consultants  will  include \nnecessary social and land survey staff for social assessment and preparation of resettlement \nplans, as appropriate. The IAs assisted by the consultant will screen, assess, plan, implement, \nand monitor any resettlement impacts of project activities in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy and the resettlement framework for the Project. The IAs will review and \nendorse relevant resettlement plans and reports before their submission to ADB for approval. \nThe EA and IAs will ensure timely availability of budget for land compensation and resettlement \nactivities.  \n ", "18 \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n83.  The Project involves rehabilitation and reconstruction works, whose scope requires only \ninitial environmental examination (IEE). Although the Project will construct a bridge 330 meters \nlong at an estimated cost of $7.0 million, the Project is classified category B in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  the  existing  laws  of  the  Government,  including  the \nEnvironmental Protection Act, 1997, and Environmental Protection Rules, 1997. The Project\u2019s \nenvironmental assessment and review procedure and a summary IEE will identify the degree of \nlikely impacts and describe possible mitigation measures. The field visits verify that the Project \nconforms with the above criteria. The Government endorsed the summary IEE and resettlement \nframework, and uploaded them to their website for public disclosure. Sample IEE for new \nconstruction of a 330-meter long bridge at Chatara is under preparation. \n \n84.  All subprojects will be required to complete and satisfy an environmental assessment \nscreening  checklist  during  formulation,  and  will  have  to  satisfy  IEE  requirements. \nRecommended mitigation measures will be incorporated into the subproject design and work \nassignment (such as the bill of quantities, specifications, and contract document).  \n \n85.  Apart  from  minor  impacts,  the  Project  is  expected  to  have  several  environmental \nbenefits,  including  limiting  land  erosion  and  failure  of  embankments  along  damaged \ninfrastructure,  reducing  health  risks  by  rehabilitating  damaged  water  supply  and  sanitation \nfacilities,  cleaning  drainage  systems,  and  reconstruction  of  damaged  irrigation  facilities  to \nbolster both the irrigation and agriculture sectors. The EA is familiar with the environmental \nguidelines and procedures of ADB and the Government. Summary IEE and environmental \nassessment  and  review  procedures  are  in  Supplementary  Appendixes  G  and  H  to  guide \nsubproject implementation and to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy and the \nGovernment\u2019s environmental requirements. \n \nE.  Risks \n86.  According to the Government\u2019s return strategy plan for Koshi flood-displaced people, the \nGovernment assumes that 60% of currently affected people will return immediately with the \nreturn package and 15% will return within 6 months because of high-level damage to their home \nand farmlands. These people will be provided with employment opportunities from ongoing ADB \nprojects and rehabilitation projects. However, about 25% of the people have little prospect of an \nimmediate return to their previous area since deep siltation and deep water have prevented their \nland from being recovered, and some are landless people. ADB is working with the Government \nand other development partners to identify sustainable resettlement options for the significant \npercentage of displaced people.    \n \n87.  A potential risk is that procedural delays in obtaining government approvals will slow \nimplementation. The Government has shown strong commitment to the Project and will arrange \nsimplified procedures. Delays at the EA level will be minimized through the selection of an EA \nwith considerable experience in implementing ADB-financed projects and familiarity with ADB \nprocedures, implementation by an established PCO, and consultant selection by ADB. In the \npast, the availability of counterpart funding has been a problem in ADB projects in Nepal. MOF \nassured that counterpart funds would be provided to IAs on a timely basis.  \n \n88.  Governance-related  issues,  including  corruption,  constitute  another  risk.  This  is \naddressed  through  selecting  all  subprojects,  transparent  implementation  and  monitoring \nmechanisms,  and  specific  financial  controls  including  regular  as  well  as  random  audits. \n ", "19 \nMeasures will include strict construction supervision and strong consultant support, use of the \nproject performance report, close monitoring by ADB staff, and random procurement and annual \nperformance auditing at the EA level. The PSC will be supported by monitoring and evaluation \nspecialists from MPPW as well as four national consultants (a project team leader, monitoring \nand evaluation specialist, a procurement specialist, and a financial management specialist), who \nwill  (i)  help  monitor  all  project  activities,  (ii)  conduct  random  spot  checks  during  project \nimplementation, and (iii) provide capacity building in key areas of monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n89.  A fourth risk is recurrence of major disasters and related extensive damage. This is \naddressed  by  adopting  cost-effective  flood-resistant  design  standards,  including  capacity \nbuilding, which are expected to reduce damage from future floods. In addition, DWIDP will build \nits capacity under the Project by establishing a flood forecasting system and an early warning \nsystem for the Koshi River, in close coordination with UNDP, which plans to support the early \nwarning system in the field to take necessary actions at the field to prevent any breach of the \nembankment.  The  risk  of  inadequate  maintenance  is  addressed  by  close  monitoring  and \nongoing policy dialogue with the Government.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES  \n90.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and MPPW have given the \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Project  steering  committee.  Within  1  month  of  grant  effectiveness,  the \nGovernment will establish a PSC to monitor project implementation and oversee \nall project governance-related matters. Within 1 month of grant effectiveness, \nMPPW will have established a PCO, headed by a full-time project coordinator. \n(ii)  Simplified  procedures.  Cabinet  will  approve  simplified  and  fast  track \nprocedures for goods, services, and civil works, in line with the provisions on \nemergency projects in its Public Procurement Act and Regulations of 2007, and \nacceptable to ADB. \n(iii)  Delegation of financial powers. The Government will ensure that delegated \nfinancial powers, in particular those under the financial procedures rules of 2007, \nare followed under the Project.  \n(iv)  Timely  completion  of  preparatory  activities  for  Koshi  bridge.  The \nGovernment will ensure that river survey works be completed by 15 April 2009, \nand the contract be awarded by  31 October 2009 in order to complete the \nconstruction of Koshi bridge at Chatara within the project period. \n(v)  Counterpart funds. The Government will allocate and release, on a timely basis, \nadequate counterpart funds from its budget for each fiscal year during project \nimplementation. \n(vi)  Operation  and  maintenance.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  facilities \nrehabilitated  or  constructed  under  the  Project  will  be  properly  operated  and \nmaintained by the relevant IAs in accordance with sound practices.  \n(vii)  Beneficiary participation. All IAs will actively seek beneficiary participation in \nthe design and implementation of all rehabilitation works carried out under the \nProject. \n(viii)  Within 1 year of grant effectiveness, the Cabinet will approve a flood disaster \npreparedness action plan, and DWIDP will provide training on flood awareness \nand preparedness.  \n(ix)  Anticorruption.  The  following  measures  will  be  taken:  (a)  strict  financial \nmanagement with full adherence to monitoring and reporting systems; (b) strict \n ", "20 \ncompliance with the Government\u2019s Public Procurement Act and Regulations and \nLocal  Body  Financial  Administration  Regulations;  (c)  allowing  third  party \nmonitoring  of  all  subprojects;  and  (d)  random  independent  spot  checks  of \nimplementation by ADB and PCO.  \n(x)  Environment.  The  subprojects  will  be  implemented  in  compliance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  environmental  protection  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy,  and  the  summary  IEE  for  the  Project.  In  the  event  of \ndiscrepancy  between  the  Government\u2019s  law  and  regulations  and  the  ADB\u2019s \npolicy, ADB\u2019s policy will prevail. The Government\u2019s environmental clearance, if \nrequired, will be obtained prior to commencing any civil works.  \n(xi)  Resettlement.  The  Government  will  ensure  that,  to  the  extent  possible, \nsubprojects will not require land acquisition or involuntary resettlement. In the \nevent  that  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement  is  required  for  any \nsubproject, the Government will prepare a resettlement plan in accordance with \nthe  Government\u2019s  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy, ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement,10 and the resettlement \nframework  agreed  for  the  Project.  In  case  of  discrepancy  between  the \nGovernment\u2019s law and regulations and ADB\u2019s policy, ADB\u2019s policy will prevail.  \n(xii)  Gender  and  social  inclusion. The Government will ensure that all IAs will \nimplement  the  gender  action  plan  for  the  Project.  Within  3  months  of  grant \neffectiveness, gender and social inclusion guidelines will be approved to ensure \nbenefits accrue equitably to women and marginalized groups. All surveys and \nassessments to be prepared under the Project will employ data disaggregated by \ngender, caste, and ethnicity. Monitoring and reporting will address the services \nprovided to these groups and will provide data in disaggregated form. \n(xiii)  Core labor standard. The Government will ensure that civil works contractors \ncomply with all applicable labor laws, do not employ child labor for construction \nand  maintenance  activities,  and  provide  appropriate  facilities  in  construction \ncampsites.  The  Government  requires  contractors  not  to  differentiate  wages \nbetween men and women for work of equal value. A specific clause will be \nincluded in bidding documents, and compliance will be strictly monitored during \nproject implementation. \n(xiv)  Indigenous people. The Government will ensure that subprojects will not affect \nvulnerable population groups, such as indigenous people. In the event of their \ninvolvement  in  any  of  the  subprojects,  the  Government  will  take  necessary \nactions  required  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  applicable  laws  and \nregulations, and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n91.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not  \nexceeding $25,600,000 to Nepal from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for the Emergency Flood \nDamage  Rehabilitation  Project,  on  such  terms  and  conditions  that  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n3 April 2009 \n \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 1998.

Floods in Nepal \n  \n1.  There are more than 6,000 streams and rivers in Nepal, which flow mostly from the north \ntoward the south, generally with high velocity because of high river gradient. Most of the large \nrivers are snow-fed, originating in the snow-covered Himalayan range. As the topography of the \ncountry is steep and high-angle slope, very high intensity of rainfall during monsoon season \ncauses floods and landslides, which are the most destructive types of disasters in Nepal. Three-\nquarters of the total land area of Nepal is hilly and many villages are situated on or adjacent to \nthe unstable hill slopes. Landslides in the hills add enormous sediment to streams and rivers, \nand cause floods downstream. Each year, such disasters cause the loss of human lives and \nimmense damage to agricultural land, crops, human settlements, and other physical property. \n  \n2.  Floods are usually triggered by extreme weather events associated with heavy rainfall \nduring the monsoon. Rainfalls events exceeding 300 millimeters (mm) within a 24-hour period, \nwhich disturb both slope and channel equilibrium on a regional scale, occur frequently in the \ncountry. The increasing frequency of such extreme precipitation events, together with changes \nin snow and ice cover caused by global warming and other factors, have led to an increase in \nthe number of natural disasters in the country. \n \n3.  Increasing  settlements  along  riverbanks  (encroaching  the  rivers)  and  valleys  have \naggravated flood hazards in recent years. From 1983 to 2007, 7,300 people were reported killed \nand 630,500 families were affected by floods and landslides. According to a report of the \nDepartment of Water Induced Disaster Prevention (DWIDP), floods contribute about 34% of \ntotal deaths and 75% of total affected families of all kinds of natural disasters in the country.1 \nTherefore, priority should be given to reducing the effect of floods.     \n \n4.  Poor understanding of flood causes and a scarcity of relevant hydro-meteorological data \nhave perpetuated uncertainties in dealing with natural hazards. It is necessary to fill these gaps, \nand develop methods and techniques for flood management. These methods and techniques \nshould be simple and affordable if they are to be effective.  \n \n5.  Floods can be accurately predicted, which can eventually help reduce damage to life \nand property. The hydro-meteorological systems of mountain areas are very complex and are \npoorly understood. The hydro-meteorological network is still poor; the existing observational \nnetwork is not capable of capturing the diversity of the mountain landscape, and there are \ndifficulties in the generalization of weather and climate as there is little or no long-term data.  \n \nB.  Flood Management in Nepal \n \n6.  Before the Natural Disaster Relief Act, 1982, there was no well-structured disaster policy \nin Nepal. Prior to 1982, relief and rescue work was carried out as social work. The act was \nformulated in 1982, and amended in 1989 and 1992.  \n \n7.  As the act does not describe the functions and duties of all district disaster management \nrelated  agencies,  there  have  been  cooperation,  coordination,  and  mutual  understanding \nproblems among the flood related agencies. Disaster victims do not receive immediate, efficient, \nand effective rescue and relief services. Delayed relief works often bring very serious and \n                                                 \n1 DWIDP. 2008. Disaster Review. Kathmandu. \n ", "24  Appendix 2 \nunpleasant results, and duplication of efforts has been experienced, mainly because of the \nabsence of dialogue and mutual understanding among agencies. In addition, some disaster \nrelated agencies try to shift their responsibilities to others, as the act does not provide clear-cut \njob descriptions. Immediate formulation of natural disaster relief regulations is necessary to give \nclear-cut job descriptions of all disaster related agencies. \n \n8.  According  to  the  Natural  Disaster  Relief  Act,  the  Central  Natural  Disaster  Relief \nCommittee  (CNDRC)  has  been  constituted  under  the  leadership  of  the  home  minister  to \nformulate and implement policies and programs relating to natural disaster relief work, and to \nundertake other necessary measures. The CNDRC prepares specific norms of relief assistance \nto be given to disaster victims of the affected area in cash and/or in kind. Although there is a \nrelief and treatment subcommittee, supply shelter and rehabilitation subcommittee, regional \ndisaster relief committees, DDRCs, and local disaster relief committee, only the CNDRC and \nDDRC are active. \n \n9.  The CNDRC may establish the relief and treatment subcommittee and supply shelter \nand rehabilitation subcommittee, which provide advice and suggestions to the CNDRC; help to \nexecute CNDRC policies and directives; and operate rescue, relief, and rehabilitation work \neffectively during very serious natural disasters.  \n10.  The Ninth Plan (1998\u20132002) underlines the need to strengthen disaster management \ncapacity. It envisages attempting to prevent, mitigate, and reduce natural disasters through \nmore  advanced  geological,  hydrological,  and  meteorological  technology.  Hazard  mapping, \nvulnerability assessment, risk analysis, and an early warning system have to be developed; and \na well-trained and efficient labor should be made available. The plan suggests that the policies \nand plan emphasize the importance and need for national and/or international assistance.  \n11.  Responding to the request of the United Nations, Nepal has constituted a high-level \nNational Committee for the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, chaired by the \nhome minister and represented by high-level dignitaries from government and nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs). The National Action Plan prepared under the direction of the committee \nincludes  activities  on  disaster  preparedness,  response,  mitigation,  rehabilitation,  and \nreconstruction programs; and specifies the responsibilities of various disaster actors with a \nspecified time frame. The plan guides disaster reduction tasks by formulating special actions \nand mobilizing the available resources in the given period.  \n12.  Media involvement is helping to raise public awareness in cooperation with various \ngovernment agencies and NGOs. Each year, public awareness programs are launched on the  \nradio and television. During the hazardous season, distribution of posters and pamphlets, as \nwell as media alerts, raise public awareness significantly. \n \n13.  Different government agencies and development partners\u2014including Japan International \nCooperation  Agency,  Water  Induced  Disaster  Prevention  Technical  Centre,  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  and  Asian \nDisaster Preparedness Center\u2014are involved in conducting workshops, seminars, and training \nprograms on disaster management. Such activities have contributed significantly to raise public \nawareness and labor development. \n14.  In addition, the Department of Mines and Geology is preparing a landslide inventory. The \nWater  Induced  Disaster  Prevention  Technical  Centre  is  carrying  out  thematic  studies  on \nlandslides  and  monitoring  of  landslides.  The  Department  of  Soil  Conservation  is  doing \nprotection works in different districts. The Department of Roads is carrying out bioengineering \n ", "  Appendix 2  25 \nworks in cooperation with Tribhuvan University to stabilize the slope and road cut sides. The \nDepartment of Hydrology and Meteorology and the International Centre for Integrated Mountain \nDevelopment are preparing a map of flood-prone areas. The International Centre for Integrated \nMountain Development also conducts research and training activities on natural hazards. The \nDepartment of Hydrology and Meteorology is involved in generating data on earthquakes and \nweather forecasts in Nepal. Tribhuvan University established a Mountain Risk Engineering Unit \nfor training purposes. \nC.  Flood Management in the Project Areas \n \n15.  Disaster risks in the flood-affected areas are high, as they are vulnerable to annual \nfloods during the wet season. The damaged left embankment of the Koshi River needs to be \nrehabilitated as soon as possible so that the Government\u2019s recovery program can be more \neffective  in  the  immediate  humanitarian  relief  program,  and  the  Government\u2019s  short-term \nrecovery program in flood-affected areas can be initiated.  \n \n16.  To reduce disaster risks in flood-affected areas, the Government proposed additional \nriver training works in Kailali, Kanchanpur, and Sunsari districts. However, a feasibility study of \nproposed river training works needs to be undertaken to improve the risk management of the \nproposed works and to prioritize the proposed river training works.  \n \n17.  As the Government needs to study flood risk in the Koshi River, it is recommended that \na study team\u2014comprising a river morphologist, river engineer, and international river legal \nadvisor\u2014be mobilized to prepare a disaster risk management plan in close coordination with the \ntechnical team of the Government of India in order to respond to any future floods (a similar \neffort is being made in Bihar State, India).   \n \n18.  The far western region is also vulnerable to annual floods as heavy rainfall brings \nlandslides, which cause floods in the mountains. This is mainly a localized phenomenon, but the \nresulting flash floods can be quite devastating when they descend the mountains. Excessive \nrainfall  is  the  primary  cause  of  flooding,  but  even  concentrated  and  heavy  rainfall  in  the \nwatershed during the wet season would not cause such severe flooding if the resulting surface \nrunoff could flow away downstream without hindrance. In the far western region, a combination \nof natural factors, including the silting up of river channels and river wandering, require civil \nworks to provide quick drainage of the relatively large runoff. Therefore, it is recommended to \nprepare a flood action plan for each district to prevent future flood damage and landslides.  \n \n19.  To overcome future floods efficiently and effectively, bilateral water treaties need to be \nreviewed by the governments of Nepal and India to improve the management and maintenance \nof barrages and embankments in the bilateral rivers; and to clarify the responsibilities of both \ngovernments  in  maintenance  of  river  works.  As  the  embankments  in  Nepal\u2019s  rivers  are \nvulnerable  to  floods,  it  is  necessary  to  establish  a  safety  monitoring  mechanism  in  each \nembankment in the bilateral rivers and to allocate suitable budgets to DWIDP and the Ministry of \nWater Resources in order to improve bilateral coordination in disaster management with the \nGovernment of India. \n \n \n ", "26   Appendix 3 \nDEVELOPMENT PARTNERS' CLUSTER ACTIVITIES \n \n  Cluster  Achievements in 2008  Priorities for 2009 \n1.

Damage and Impact \n \n1.  On 18 August 2008, a massive flood on the Koshi River breached about 1.7 kilometers \n(km)  of  its  east  embankment,  which  resulted  in  inundation  of  many  village  development \ncommittees  (VDCs),  with  major  damage  to  agricultural  land  and  standing  crops.  On \n3 September 2008, farming land and standing crops were damaged by floods\u2014mainly by the \nDodha River in Kanchanpur district and by the Mohana River in Kailali district. In Sunsari, major \ndamage and losses occurred in four VDCs were located along the east embankment.1 However, \nin Kailali and Kanchanpur, damages and losses were scattered throughout several VDCs, with \nhigh magnitude in 7 VDCs in Kanchanpur and 11 VDCs in Kailali.2    \n \n2.  The damage assessment indicated that the floods damaged 25,870 hectares (ha) of \nagricultural land and standing crops in different magnitudes in the three districts (5,282 ha in \nSunsari; 10,215 ha in Kailali; and 10,375 ha in Kanchanpur) owned by 35,151 farm families \n(5,320  in  Sunsari;  17,059  in  Kailali;  and  12,772  in  Kanchanpur).  Out  of  the  total  affected \nagricultural land, 3,590 ha is heavily damaged (2,590 ha in Sunsari alone), and can only be \nreclaimed  in  the  medium  term  by  cleaning  sand  or  recovering  land  productivity  through \ncultivation  of  suitable  crops,  technology,  and  irrigation.  The  floods  have  damaged \n123,706 metric tons (t) of standing crops (20,158 t in Sunsari; 41,159 t in Kailali; and 60,847 t in \nKanchanpur). Major crops damaged were paddy (80,783 t); vegetable (9,374 t); sugarcane \n(23,985 t); fruits (5,215 t); pulses (999 t); others3 (3,350 t); and fish (100,000 kilograms)\u2014worth \nabout $19.6 million equivalent. The floods have seriously affected the livelihoods of about \n32,500 farm families, requiring medium- and long-term measures to revive agriculture and \nrestore their livelihoods. Agriculture infrastructure (such as agriculture product collection and \nmarket centers, micro-irrigation systems, fishponds, and agriculture service centers) were also \ndamaged.  \n       \nB.  Project Scope \n \n3.  The agriculture component will restore the livelihoods of affected people from 22 VDCs \nin the project districts by supporting them to grow cash crops such as vegetables, watermelon, \npeanuts, parwar (pointed gourd), sunflower, jute, and arahar (pulse) in the highly affected areas; \nand cultivate cereals (paddy, wheat, and maize) and vegetables in partly affected areas. Seeds, \nsaplings, compost, and pesticides will be provided to affected farm families by organizing them \ninto groups; and training will be provided to reclaim soil fertility so that livelihoods are restored. \nThe  reestablishment  of  fruit  orchards  (such  as  banana,  mango,  and  pineapple)  and \nrehabilitation of fishponds, agriculture products collection and marketing centers, and agriculture \nservice centers will be carried out. Other activities such as fingerlings and beehives (with bee) \nwill be provided to interested farm families to support their livelihoods. Basic equipment will be \nprovided to undertake agricultural programs. Management services and consulting inputs will be \navailable to implement this component.  \n \n4.  This  component  will  support  rehabilitation  of  agriculture  in  7,940  ha  of  farmland \n(3,688 ha in Sunsari; 2,264 ha in Kailali; and 1,988 ha in Kanchanpur), covering 7,730 farm \nfamilies (3,280 families in Sunsari; 2,640 families in Kailali; and 1,810 families in Kanchanpur), \nand restoration of livelihoods of about 45,600 people (19,680 in Sunsari; 14,520 in Kailali; and \n                                                 \n1 The four VDCs heavily damaged by the Koshi floods are Shreepur, Hariput, Paschim Kusaha, and Laukahi. \n2 In Kailali, the most affected VDCs are Hasuliya, Dansingpur, Lalbojhi, Ratanpur, Pawera, Khailad, Basauti, \nGadariya, Narayanpur, and Fulbari. The most affected VDCs in Kanchanpur district include Shankarpur, Laxmipur, \nChadani, Krishnapur, Dekhatbhuli, Raikawar-Bichawa, and Shreepur.     \n3 Other crops include maize, oilseed, jute, and fish.   \n ", "  Appendix 4  31 \n11,400 in Kanchanpur). The beneficiaries will comprise 45% women and 25% dalit4 and janajati5 \ncommunities. \n \nC.  Project and Community Selection  \n \n5.  Project beneficiaries will be the flood-affected farm families. For support under this \ncomponent, the farm families will be selected based on their demand and preparedness to \nrestore their livelihood through revival of agriculture. Specific criteria will include that farm \nfamilies  (i)  are  formally  returned  to  their  original  areas  from  camps,  (ii)  have  land  where \ncultivation of suitable cereal or cash crops is possible, (iii) are willing to cultivate suitable crops \nthrough project support, (iv) are prepared to be members of farmer groups formed in respective \nsettlements, and (v) are committed to continue agriculture after the Project is completed. The \nmost affected people requiring immediate support will be given high priority. Cohesive groups \nwill be formed through social mobilization, taking into account their preference to grow crops \nsuitable for their lands. Out of the targeted 7,940 farm families, 25% is expected to be covered \nin 2009, 50% in 2010, and the remaining 25% in 2011. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n6.

On  18  August  2008,  the  Koshi  River  breached  its  left  embankment,  which  led  to \ninundation  and  severe  flooding  in  four  village  development  committees  (VDCs):  Haripur, \nLaukahi, , Paschim Kusaha, and Shreepur.1 About 90% of the river discharge flew through the \nbreached embankment and damaged standing crops, farmlands, irrigation facilities, and other \ninfrastructure. It was estimated that 5,280 hectares (ha) of farmland were severely damaged, \naffecting the livelihoods of 3,280 farm families. The national highway was also damaged at \nseveral places, interrupting the daily life of people from the Eastern Development Region.    \n \n2.  Excessive rainfall of 240\u2013300 millimeters (mm) per day during 19\u201320 September 2008, \nwith an occurrence frequency of 50-year, caused floods in Kailali and Kanchanpur districts that \ndamaged irrigation facilities and related infrastructure in both districts. The estimated cost to \ndamaged irrigation facilities in 11,542 ha of the three districts is $12.7 million, which has ceased \nirrigation facility on farmland, and affected 8,931 farm families and 57,788 people. The total loss \nof agricultural income caused by the absence of irrigation was estimated at about $16.6 million.  \n \nB.  Project Scope \n \n3.  This irrigation part will rehabilitate the damaged 27 surface irrigation systems, including \ntheir head works, main and branch canals and village channels, canal structures such as drain \nsiphons and outlets, canal service roads and small bridges, and protection works for key canal \nstructures. Rehabilitation of the irrigation systems will restore irrigation facilities to 11,542 ha of \nfarmland. To revive agriculture quickly in viable areas and supplement surface irrigation after \ntheir rehabilitation, 700 shallow tube wells (STWs) will be installed and the operation and \nmaintenance cost will be provided for a year. The total cost estimated for this component is \n$9.18 million ($7.66 million for rehabilitation of surface irrigation and $1.52 million for installation \nof STWs). Details on surface irrigation systems for rehabilitation and the area to be irrigated are \nin Table A5.1.  \n \n4.   The Project will finance the rehabilitation of 25 head works; 127 kilometers (km) of main, \nbranch, and tertiary canals; 196 canal structures such as drain siphon, aqueduct, gates, outlets, \nand inlets; 36 km of canal service roads; 45 culverts and small bridges; and 1 medium-sized \nbridge (on canal service road).

The 2008 far western floods damaged 28 gravity flow water supply systems in Kailali \nand Kanchanpur. The major structures of the gravity flow water facilities\u2014including intakes \n(both streams and springs near the river), transmission pipeline of various sizes and lengths, \nand river crossings\u2014have been washed away by the floods. Currently, about 94,000 people \nfetch water from the nearest available river, irrigation system, and hand pumps. In Sunsari \ndistrict, 3,900 shallow tube wells, serving about 22,000 people, were under water and most of \nthem were covered by sand. Flood-affected people are displaced in the following four areas: \n(i) formal camps, (ii) spontaneous settlements, (iii) host families, and (iv) earlier residence. \nReturnees  to  their  previous  area  and  residents  of  spontaneous  settlements  are  the  most \nvulnerable in terms of access to drinking water and sanitation facilities.  \n \nB.  Project Activities  \n \n1.  Water Supply Scheme  \n \n2.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  28  gravity  flow  water  supply  systems  in  Kailali  and \nKanchanpur; construct 4 small overhead water supply systems; and install 3,500 shallow tube \nwells in Sunsari to provide access to drinking water and sanitation facilities for the flood-affected \npeople. The gravity flow water supply systems and small overhead water supply systems will be \ndesigned to give the disadvantaged and poor adequate access to drinking water and sanitation, \nand will be operated and maintained by the respective communities.   \n  \n2.  Sanitation \n \n3.   This activity will cover a health and hygiene education awareness program and support \nthe construction of household latrines for returnees in Sunsari district. In Kailali and Kanchanpur \ndistricts, the Project will focus on promoting hygiene and sanitation behavioral change through \nan  integrated  community  and  school-based  program.  Revolving  funds  will  be  available  to \nencourage rapid and significant expansion of latrine use and proper hand washing in project-\nassisted  communities.  The  health  and  hygiene  education  awareness  program,  with  a \ncommunity-led modality, will be implemented for 6 months for each district.  \n \n3.  Community Mobilization  \n \n4.   The  Project  envisages  the  active  participation  of  communities  to  ensure  equitable \naccess to benefits, and long-term sustainability of water supply and sanitation facilities. In \naccordance with the Government\u2019s strategy, project beneficiaries (users) and water supply and \nsanitation communities are responsible for operation and maintenance of facilities. This activity \nwill (i) form water users and sanitation communities (WUSC) or strengthen existing WUSCs; \n(ii) organize an orientation program; (iii) ensure optimum use of locally available resources, \nincluding labor and skills; and (iv) establish effective operation and maintenance mechanisms.

Damage and Impact \n \n1.  The 2008 floods caused extensive damage to the road network, both in the Koshi area in \nthe east and in far western Nepal. In the east, the East\u2013West Highway and some feeder roads \n(including bridges and culverts) were severely damaged. Similarly, incessant rainfall and floods \ncaused  widespread  damage  to  the  Strategic  Road  Network  in  the  far  west,  including \nembankment  failures,  damage  to  approaches  and  bridge  protection  works,  landslides, \nrockslides and debris flow in the East\u2013West Highway, Mahakali Highway, Seti Highway, and \nSilgadi-Sanfe Roads. Although the Department of Roads (DOR) has managed to open the \nroads in the far west, major landslides are yet to be removed and rehabilitation of damaged \nroads and retaining structures needs to be carried out. Eastern Nepal remains cut off from the \nrest of the country; the only means of transport are by air or via a long detour through India at \nmore than double the normal transportation cost. There has been a significant negative impact \non  the  economy  of  the  entire  eastern  region  following  the  Koshi  floods.  Considering  the \nrelatively low discharge in the river on the day the Koshi embankment was breached causing \nwidespread damage, the embankment remains vulnerable to further breaches. \n  \n2.  Based on the information available from DOR, the direct damage and indirect losses in \nthe road sector due to the 2008 floods in the Koshi river area and the far western region are \nestimated to be more than $36.00 million.  \n \nB.  Project Scope \n \n3.  The road part of the Project comprises reconstruction and rehabilitation of damaged \nstrategic roads in the far west, and replacement of existing ferries by a permanent bridge  over \nthe Koshi River at Chatara. Rehabilitation of flood-damaged feeder and local roads in the Koshi \narea, which are under the responsibility of the Ministry of Local Development, will be carried out \nunder  the  ongoing  Rural  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation  Sector  Development  Program1 \nfunded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) at an estimated cost of $4 million. The roads part \nof the Project will cover rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure and, where technically feasible \nand justified, the design of rehabilitation works will focus on preventive and mitigating measures \nto minimize the damaging effect of similar floods in the future. This conforms with the flood \ndamage  and  needs  assessment  report  prepared  by  ADB  and  the  Government\u2019s  recovery \nstrategy.  \n \nC.  Project Activities  \n \n4.  Reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  works  are  based  on  government  priority  and  the \nseverity of damages caused by the floods, both in the east and far western Nepal. The following \nselection criteria have been used to select the project components: \n \n(i)  The project will reconstruct and rehabilitate damaged or vulnerable roads, \nbridges, culverts, and retaining structures that are under the responsibility of \nDOR. \n(ii)  Priority  was  given  to  roads  and  structures  that  will  reduce  the  future \nvulnerability of the infrastructure and preparedness for possible flood damage \nin the future. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007.

Economic Benefits \n \n1.  An economic analysis was carried out for each component and for the Project as a \nwhole. The costs of the project coordination office were allocated to each component based on \ntheir  total  expenditures.  The  conversion  of  financial to  economic  pricing  took  into  account \ninternational pricing for tradable goods and taxes and duties in accordance with Nepalese \ntariffs. Shadow wage rates were estimated for agricultural and skilled workers. Conversion \nfactors used for previous Asian Development bank (ADB) projects involving agriculture and \nroads were applied to this Project.1 \n \n2.  In summary, the overall financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the Project, based on a \n20-year life, is estimated at 20.42% and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 24.56%. \nA 1-year delay in implementation, the major risk, reduces the FIRR to 19.2% and the EIRR to \n23.3%. The Table SAE.3 in Supplementary Appendix 3 provides more detail on the sensitivity of \ninvestments to risk and uncertainty. Overall, the EIRR is robust against a range of project-\nspecific variations. The EIRR of the Chatara bridge is a special case and its justification rests on \nstrategic issues as much as economic issues. The sections below discuss economic benefits for \neach of the components. \n \n  1.  Irrigation  \n \n3.  The Irrigation Department shows an irrigation command area of 27,471 hectares (ha) in \nthe proposed project area. Of this total, the irrigation system covering 10,283 ha has been \ndamaged.  In  the  financial  and  economic  analysis,  it  is  assumed  that  even  land  in  the \nundamaged command area (17,188 ha) has a loss of production of 10% because the whole \ncommand area is affected. Within the damaged area, it is assumed that 20% (2,057 ha) has \naccess to alternative water supplies through the use of pumps, and is able to grow winter and \nwet season crops although at reduced production levels, while the remaining 8,226 ha has no \naccess to water and only grows a non-irrigated paddy crop in the wet season. \n \n4.  The analysis assumes a cropping intensity of 1.80 that is based on combined statistics \nfor the eastern and far western Terai districts.2 It assumes that the paddy area is equal to the \nirrigated area, cereals equal 55% of the irrigated area, and cash crops take up 25% of area. To \nsimplify calculations, wheat is the proxy for cereals (maize, millet, and barley) and oilseed and \npotatoes are the proxy for cash crops that also include sugarcane and jute. \n \n5.  Crop incomes are based on production outputs ranging from 50% to 100% of production. \nThe financial income is NRs364.0 million without the Project and NRs576.0 million with the \nProject by the third year\u2014an annual increase of NRs211.0 million. On an economic basis, the \nnet annual benefit from the Project is NRs275.0 million. This higher benefit is due to the \neconomic farm gate price for paddy being NRs15.8 per kilogram compared to NRs12.0 per \nkilogram market price. The FIRR for the Project from irrigation rehabilitation is 14.8% and the \nEIRR is 30.0%. A delay in implementation of 1 year lowers the EIRR to 23.0%. This delay is \nconsidered unlikely. \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003.

Full information concerning a complete classification of land according to potential use \nand the number of farm families affected and willing to return is still being collected. The \nanalysis is based on total mapped areas less the area of 490 ha totally damaged. Indicative \nrevenues and expenditures for the proposed fishponds, orchards, and cash crops for affected \nland areas have been assessed. To avoid an overlap in benefits from irrigation, the benefits \nfrom agriculture in this analysis focus on damaged land that is not immediately amenable to \nsurface irrigation and, in many cases, requires a changed use of land supplemented by the \navailability of shallow tube wells (STWs).  \n \n7.  The projected benefits from the Project are estimated on a conservative basis. The STW \noperating costs are derived from the ADB Community Groundwater Irrigation Sector Project, as \nare the revenues and other operating costs for vegetables. Family labor is included in costs. \nTotal labor creation from the targeted area of 3,590 ha is estimated at 1,871 person-years per \nannum. It is assumed that only one crop is grown each year. Until more data are available, only \nvegetable crops have been included in the analysis. The FIRR for the component is 14.1% and \nthe EIRR is 16.16%. \n \n3.  Water Supply and Sanitation \n \n8.  Water supply and sanitation comprises overhead and gravity water supply systems in all \nthree districts plus hand pumps and reconstructed toilets in Sunsari, for a total direct cost of \nNRs314.07 million. The number of households and population indicate a total savings of more \nthan 100,000 hours per day. This is converted to economically active workdays, assuming each \nhousehold has 1.5 active workers and 70% of the hand-carried water is carried by an adult \nbefore the Project. The value of workdays gained is NRs290.7 million per annum at a daily \nwage  rate  of  NRs185.  Operational  costs  for  the  new  investments  are  calculated  at \nNRs26.2 million per annum, leaving a net annual gain of NRs264.5 million. \n \n \n9.  The FIRR for the water supply and sanitation investment is 27.77% and the EIRR is \n26.32%. The component benefits 18,856 households (103,700 persons). Water supply and \nsanitation construction utilizes 294,925 person-days of work, equivalent to 1,134 person-years \nof work and wage incomes amounting to NRs54.56 million. \n \n4.  Roads \n \n10.  In the far west, five road systems are proposed for rehabilitation; three require road and \nbridge repairs and two require reconstruction following the removal of landslides. The total cost \nis NRs315 million. Benefits from repairs are calculated as being (i) a saving in vehicle costs of \nNRs0.239 million per day (NRs2.462 million without the Project and NRs2,223 million with the \nProject); (ii) a saving of 13,940 passenger hours per day; and (iii) a saving of not requiring three \nearthmoving machines on standby at each of three mega-landslide locations. These savings are \ncalculated on a full-year basis. \n \n11.  The Project provides for the construction of a 350-meter bridge at Chatara crossing the \nKoshi River to allow east\u2013west traffic to proceed even when the main East\u2013West Highway is \nimpassable. The cost of this is estimated at $7.4 million. There are four types of savings are \nmade when people use the bridge when the East\u2013West Highway is impassable: (i) the saving in \nferry costs at the Chatara crossing, (ii) the savings in foot traffic costs and time, (iii) the saving in \nvehicle costs, and (iv) the saving in vehicle passenger hours. The savings in ferry costs are \nNRs12.29 million per 180 days or NRs0.07 million per day. The savings in foot traffic costs are \nNRs0.04 million per day. The savings in vehicle costs and time are based on distances shown \n ", "60   Appendix 12 \n \nin Table SAE.2 in the Supplementary Appendix E. The saving in vehicle costs is NRs2.773 \nmillion per day when the East\u2013West road is impassable. The saving would be greater if the \nroads on both sides of the Chatara bridge were bitumen sealed\u2014a further NRs0.909 million per \nday (but this is not envisaged under the Project). Construction of the Chatara bridge would save \n34,894 passenger hours per day during future floods. This saving amounts to NRs0.538 million \nper day, assuming two-thirds of passengers are economically active. \n \n12.  Operation and maintenance costs of 5% of cost per annum are included. A residual \nvalue of the bridge of 50% of cost after 20 years is included. Had the bridge been in place prior \nto the 2008 flood, the 180 days damage aversion would have saved $7.6 million in costs. Based \non 42 days of use each year, the FIRR of the bridge is 13.8% and the EIRR 12.9%. The rate of \nreturn from the bridge investment is highly dependent on the frequency and duration of future \nflooding. \n \n13.  In the far west, the annual saving in vehicle costs amounts to NRs86.22 million. The \nbenefit from saved passenger time, assuming two-thirds of passengers are economically active \nand have a daily wage rate of NRs200, amounts to NRs83.64 million. The saving from not \nneeding three earthmoving machines on standby is NRs3.6 million, assuming a capital cost of \nNRs6 million per machine and operating costs (including depreciation, repairs, and operations) \nof 20% per annum. The total benefit amounts to NRs173.46 million and the associated FIRR is \n41.5% including operation and maintenance of 5% per annum. The EIRR is 40.20%. \n \nB.  Income and Employment \n \n14.  In  agriculture  and  irrigation,  a  total  of  35,150  farm  families  were  affected  by  flood \ndamage and 22,100 families require rehabilitation of their water supply and sanitation services. \nMany of the latter group have also incurred losses caused by irrigation and agricultural damage, \nand are included in the first total. Of the 35,150 families, 19,950 families have no land damage \nbut are affected by a reduced supply of irrigation water; 11,570 families require rehabilitation of \ntheir surface irrigation facilities; 2,840 families have had their land badly damaged and have no \nimmediate source of revenue; and 790 families have completely lost their land. Before the \ndisaster, the income per family (including wages for farm labor) was an average of NRs47,759 \n(including NRs22,854 in wages and NRs25,905 net farm income). Following the disaster, the \nfamily income is estimated at an average NRs35,350 for the 19,950 families and NRs13,305 for \nthe 11,570 families. The two remaining family groups with a total 3,630 families have zero farm \nincome because their land is severely damaged or irreparably lost. In aggregate, the annual \nlabor surplus (net income plus wages) will drop from NRs1,261 million before the disaster to \nNRs693 million after the disaster\u2014equal to a loss of NRs568 million ($7.2 million) in the year \nfollowing the disaster. This is in addition to the loss of crops during the flood. \n \n15.  Before the disaster, farm labor amounted to 15,160 persons in full-time employment. \nThis  declined  to  10,290  persons  with  the  disaster,  creating  unemployment  equal  to \n4,870 persons\u201432% of the original workforce. It is estimated that project works could create \n9,200 person-years of employment over two and a half years, and it is suggested that not less \nthan 60% of this should be allocated to flood-affected persons. On an annual basis, this would \nprovide  work  for  2,200  persons\u2014about  45%  of  the  unemployed.  This  would  amount  to \nNRs86 million per annum but leave an annual income deficit of NRs482 million in the first year. \n \n16.  Family incomes are expected to rise to NRs964 million in the second year. The addition \nof project works of NRs86 million would raise total income to NRs1,050 million\u2014still a deficit of \nNRs211  million  compared  to  before  the  disaster.  In  the  third  year,  total  family  income  is \nexpected  to  be  NRs1,200  million,  and  by  the  fourth  year  it  is  projected  to  reach \nNRs1,246 million. At this point all families, apart from those that lost their land, would be \nrestored to pre-disaster income levels.  \n ", "  Appendix 13  61 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n \nCountry/Project Title: Nepal/Emergency Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project  \n \nSouth Asia Regional Department/ \nLending/Financing  Department/ \nProject grant  Nepal Resident Mission \nModality:  Division: \n \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n \n \nA.   Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy. \n \n \nPoverty in Nepal is evident as 31% of its population lives below the poverty line. Poverty incidence declined from 42% to 31% \naccording to the National Living Standard Survey from FY1996 to FY2004.a Disparity in income poverty has actually widen. \nThe reduction in poverty was disproportionately distributed across regions and in different caste, ethnic, and marginalized \ngroups. The survey data showed a strong correlation between poverty incidence and people regionally and socially excluded. \nThe poverty incidence varies across geographical regions; rural and urban locations; and identity (gender, caste, and \nethnicity). Poverty is higher in rural areas, mid-western (45%), and far western (41%) regions; and among socially excluded \ngroups (Dalits, Janajatis, and Muslims). Poverty incidence is 46% in dalits, 44% in hill indigenous people, and 46% in religious \nminority Muslims.  \n \nThe Koshi river flood inundated 4 village development committees (VDCs) of Sunsari district, located in the eastern region of \nthe country. Shreepur, Haripur, Paschim Kusaha, and Laukahi VDCs of Sunsari were severely hit\u2014causing heavy damage \nand displacing thousands. The flood damaged highways, farmlands, schools, irrigation schemes, water supply and sewerage, \nand  other  infrastructure;  and  displaced  47,000  people  with  huge  loss  of  houses,  standing  crops,  and  livestock.  The \nGovernment has assumed that the number of internally displaced people can reach up to 60,000 who will be in dire need of \nsupport. In addition, 40% of the displaced will not be able to return home without a long-term resettlement plan. Disadvantaged \ngroup mapping\u2014based on food sufficiency, access to health and education, and prevalence of vulnerable and marginalized \ngroups\u2014shows Shreepur VDC as the most disadvantaged followed by Haripur, Pashim Kusaha, and Laukahi. Damages in \nShreepur and Haripur VDCs are more extensive than in the other two VDCs. The flood in Kailali and Kanchanpur districts \nlocated in the far western region also affected nearly 43,500 people and heavily damaged water supply systems, irrigation \ncanals, school buildings, and part of the highway. The damage is scattered in many of the VDCs. In these two districts, some \n7,000 people living near the rivers were displaced\u2014mostly Mukta Kamaiya (freed bonded labors) and marginalized indigenous \npeople. In three districts, more than 35,000 farm households have been adversely affected, directly increasing risks in people\u2019s \nlong-term livelihoods. In the human poverty index, Sunsari is 8th out of 75 districts, Kanchanpur is 15th, and Kailali is in 24th \nplace.b However, there could be adverse flood impacts in the districts if timely rehabilitation measures are not taken.  \n \nSupport in the rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure will be critical to restoring the normal life and activities of the affected \npeople. This emergency project\u2014covering road, irrigation, agriculture, and water supply and sanitation\u2014will contribute in \nreducing the vulnerability and risks of the affected people, displaced, poor, and disadvantaged. All sectoral support will have \npoverty implications through rehabilitation of the damaged infrastructure and reclamation of farmland as a means of livelihood, \nand improvement of the services that will have direct impact on affected people\u2019s lives. The support will mitigate risks of likely \nimpoverishment The Project will assist and complement the Government\u2019s return strategy plan for Koshi-displaced people. \n \nThe project design includes features that will help reduce poverty directly or indirectly. It will provide short-term employment to \npoor women and men in skilled and unskilled labor-intensive construction works in the rehabilitation of damaged road and \nirrigation  infrastructure.  Social  mobilization  activities  will  be  integrated,  which  will  improve  the  group  organization  and \nmanagement  capacity  of  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  in  the  reconstruction  of  damaged  irrigation  and  water  supply \ninfrastructure\u2014empowering them to access services. Rehabilitation of highways and rural roads will contribute to smooth \ntransportation of goods and services to market, and ease economic activities\u2014creating employment opportunities for the poor. \nAgriculture support will be provided to the poor and affected farmers, integrated with irrigation measures, free of cost for a   \n1-year cropping cycle so that they will be able to restore farm work and generate an income.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "62   Appendix 13 \n \nSupport for income-generation activities will be extended to the landless and poor farmers based on their demand. Irrigation \nmeasures will be taken to cope with the immediate need for restoring the land, and to support livelihoods by providing shallow \ntube wells which will benefit the poor and marginal farmers. Rehabilitation of farmer-managed irrigation canals, including large \nschemes, will help regain the long-term sustainability of agriculture production\u2014providing benefits to all users. Water sector \ninputs will rehabilitate the damaged schemes by improving the quality and services\u2014extending the services to the poor and \nmarginalized groups, with sanitation and hygiene integral to the process. Access to drinking water and sanitation will help \nwomen and poor households save time for other economic activities and reduce their work burden. In all four affected VDCs in \nSunsari, service will be provided through a phased approach that will complement the Government\u2019s home return package. In \nSunsari VDCs, shallow tube wells will be installed to provide immediate access to drinking water. In Kailali and Kanchanpur, \ngravity-fed damaged schemes will be rehabilitated, supporting the construction of household latrines. Social mobilization will be \nintegrated to ensure social inclusion in user committees in terms of gender, caste, ethnicity, and other disadvantaged groups; \nand for effective and sustainable management of the rehabilitated schemes.   \n \nAll sectoral components will have poverty implications via support for the rehabilitation of major infrastructure directly related to \npeople\u2019s livelihoods and living conditions. The Project will assist the Government to implement its flood relief and rehabilitation \nprogram to respond to the flood impacts through medium-term support. It will be in line with National Poverty Reduction \nStrategy in terms of overall long-term poverty impacts.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                 Targeting Classification: Geographic intervention  \n \n1.  Key Issues \n \nThe impact of the Koshi flood was hardest for the displaced people who need long-term support. The people who want to \nreturn home might face deprivation in the absence of immediate needs such as basic services, food, water, and livelihoods. \nHeavy damage to some farmland in Koshi-affected VDCs require a long-term restoration program to bring the land back to its \nnormal productivity. Until then, displaced people from those areas require a long-term livelihoods program for their living. In all \nthree districts, the poorest, women, children, and marginalized groups were badly affected. They suffered more after the flood \nin terms of food access, health services, and personal security; and their situation could worsen if rehabilitation support is not \nprovided on time. Among the affected, the landless, Mukta Kamaiya, and other indigenous and minority groups will suffer long-\nterm impacts in terms of livelihood, housing, health, and food security. Hundreds of families are still living in the emergency \ncamps in Sunsari and are not able to return without a proper return package. The Government has announced a return \npackage of NRs50,000 to each Koshi-displaced family but the returnees need other support to restore livelihoods. \n \n2.   Design Features \n \nThe project design includes features to help reduce poverty directly or indirectly. It will \n(i)  provide short-term employment to poor women and men in skilled and unskilled labor-intensive construction works; \n(ii)  contribute to smooth transportation of goods and services to market, improving the access of the poor to services;  \n(iii)  improve the participation of the poor and marginalized in user committees of rehabilitated infrastructure supported \nthrough social mobilization; and \n(iv)  provide an integrated agriculture and irrigation support package for a 1-year cropping cycle, free for all affected \npeople for livelihood improvements. \n \nC.   Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \n  Not applicable \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nThe Koshi flood impact was severe for the affected people, especially the poor, as many required immediate shelter, food, \nwater, and health services. The floods in the far western districts also affected the poor, landless, and marginalized who \nrequire short- and long-term rehabilitation support. With the help of United Nations (UN) agencies and nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), the Government provided emergency relief support to the displaced with shelter, food, drinking water, \nand health clinics. In December 2008, the Government announced a return strategy plan for displaced people. It has assumed \nthat about 60% of Koshi displaced people can return home. The remaining 40% has a high level of damage to their houses \nand farmlands, so their return may be delayed. Some 25% of the displaced people do not have recoverable land, and some \nare landless and require a long-term resettlement plan. In Kailali and Kanchanpur, displaced Mukta Kamaiya and other \nmarginalized communities need resettlement support. The displaced people need a government resettlement support and \nreturn package that will assist them to rehabilitate houses, farmlands, and basic infrastructure. Employment is a high priority for \nthe poor and those not able to return home soon. Health impacts of the flood also require urgent attention, especially for \npregnant and lactating women, children, the elderly, and the poorest. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 13  63 \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n  1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during project preparation.  \n \nThe flood damage and needs assessment and the design of the Project involved consultations at different levels with key \nstakeholders, including central government officials, district offices, flood-affected people, and local political and community \nleaders. The consultations were conducted jointly with the Government and UN agencies providing relief support to the \naffected and displaced people. All the executing and implementing agencies were consulted. The findings of the assessment \nwere shared with UN partners to identify the areas of support. Based on the Government\u2019s proposals in different sectors, a \nfield assessment was carried out and consultations were conducted with district stakeholders to verify the proposed activities \nwith requirements on the ground. After field verification, ADB and the Government agreed on the areas to be supported by the \nProject. The priorities were set jointly and the project components were identified and discussed with all major stakeholders \nduring the assessment and fact-finding mission. The Government prioritized infrastructure rehabilitation, mainly roads (rural \nand highways), bridges, culverts, water and sanitation, recovery of irrigation schemes, and damaged farmland. Implementation \narrangements for project implementation were also discussed during the fact-finding mission to ensure effective service \ndelivery and minimize administrative problems. Mechanisms to ensure the participation of the poor and  women  were \nemphasized to integrate their needs in all project components. Social mobilization has been recognized as an essential \nelement in the water and agriculture components. \n \n  2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment  \n \n  3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \n \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, consultant \ninput, etc.). If no, explain why.  \n \nAs the Project is for emergency assistance, the project duration will be 36 months. Because of the inability to undertake civil \nworks during the wet season, the project period was extended 12 months beyond the 2-year project period generally expected \nunder the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004). The agreed implementation \nschedule recognizes the critical importance of restoring key infrastructure as much as possible before the onset of the next \nrainy season in July 2010. The Ministry of Physical Planning and Works will be the main executing agency, supported by a \nproject coordination office. Project implementation units will be established in the key implementing agencies\u2014Department of \nAgriculture, Department of Irrigation, Department of Water Supply and Sewerage, and Department of Roads. Consultants with \nexpertise in project management, financial management, monitoring and evaluation, environment, resettlement, and social \ndevelopment  will  be  hired  to  support  the  project  coordination  office  and  project  implementation  units.  The  planning, \nimplementation, and monitoring processes will ensure the participation of all stakeholders, including the local development \nagencies, NGOs, affected people, and relevant organizations. The concerns of women, the poorest, and disadvantaged caste \nand ethnic groups will be well integrated through participatory consultative approaches. A project steering committee\u2014chaired \nby the secretary of the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works, and including the line ministries\u2014will be established to \nprovide overall project coordination and facilitate project implementation. The total cost to be supported by ADB for the Project \nis $25.6 million.  \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues   \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: The Project will have positive impacts on women. The rehabilitation of damaged \nwater supply schemes will greatly support women by reducing their work burden. A hygiene and sanitation program, integrated \nwith a water component, will help raise women\u2019s awareness of cleanliness and use of latrines, which will have direct impact on \nfamily health. Short-term employment created during rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure will provide employment to \nwomen and increase their access to income sources. Women will be encouraged to play an active role in decision making \nthrough their participation in water user committees, farmer groups, and committees formed for operation and maintenance of \nthe rehabilitated infrastructure. Women will receive equal wages to those of men for equal work performed in construction \nworks. Agriculture activities will support women with training and knowledge related to farm activities. Free agriculture inputs \nwill help women to access productive resources, which this will be a particularly large support for poor female-headed \nhouseholds to restore their incomes. \n \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to \nand use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n    Gender plan       Other actions/measures         No action/measure \nWomen\u2019s participation and representation in decision making will be ensured in user committees of the water supply and \nsanitation, agriculture, and irrigation programs. Gender issues will be analyzed in each component while developing the plans \nand during implementation to ensure equal benefit to women from the project services and resources. Data disaggregated by \ngender,  caste,  and  ethnicity  will  be  collected  and  reported.  Through  community  mobilization  activities,  women  and \ndisadvantaged groups will be actively involved in works that directly benefit them in terms of employment and income \ngeneration. They will participate actively in user groups and committees to obtain equal benefits from project resources. \n \n ", "64   Appendix 13 \n \nIII.
