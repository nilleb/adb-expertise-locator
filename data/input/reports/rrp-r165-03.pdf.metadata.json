The summary IEE of a \nsample project is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nThe  Project,  developed  as  a  sector  loan  under  the  framework  of  the \nGovernment  of  Nepal\u2019s poverty  reduction  focus in the  10th  National \nDevelopment  Plan,  will  provide  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation \n(RWSS)  facilities  and  services  to  improve  community  health  and \nprovide  opportunities  for  income  generation  (Kingdom  of  Nepal \nNovember  2002.  Tenth  Plan  (1998/99-2001/2002),  Drinking  Water \nand Sanitation Section) to about 1,200 communities in 21 districts. It \nwill  also  facilitate  building  the  capacity  of  local  authority  institutions \n(district  development  committees  (DDCs),  village  development \ncommittee  (VDCs)),  reflecting  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to \ndecentralized  decision  making  by  focusing  implementation  at  the \ndistrict  level.  With  its  strong  community-based approach, the Project \nwill  help  rectify  historical  inequities  in  RWSS  service  provision  to \nremote districts (Midwestern and Far Western development regions), \nand  will  focus  on  providing  service  to  previously  underserved \ncommunities  and  families  in  those  communities  whose  access  to \nRWSS was limited due to gender, caste, or ethnicity.  \n \nNepal  has  less  than  0.4%  of  the  world\u2019s  population, but possesses \n2.3%  of  the  world\u2019s  water  resources.  Despite  the  abundant  water \nresources,  however,  the  country\u2019s  harsh  terrain  makes  access  to \nwater  supply  difficult  for  many  segments  of  the  population.  The \nGovernment  estimates  water  supply  coverage  to  be  around  70% \nnationwide,  but  the  quality  of  coverage  data  is  highly  variable  and \ndoes  not  necessarily  imply  that  the  systems  are  working.  Access  in \nrural areas is substantially lower. Many rely on shallow wells, ponds, \nand  streams,  which  are  often  both  biologically  and  chemically \ncontaminated.  The  burdens  associated  with  shortage  of  water  are \nborne disproportionately by women and children. \n \nLack  of  water  impacts  on  the  lowest  income  groups,  especially  on \nwomen and children who spend as much as 4-5 hours a day fetching \nwater  from  distant  sources.  This  task  causes  the  women  to  lose  out \nforgo  educational \non  productive  opportunities  while  children \nopportunities. These groups also suffer significantly from waterborne \ndiseases  due  to  use  of  water  unfit  for  human  consumption and from \nthe high cost of health care due to illness. The provision of safe water \nwill  enable  these  beneficiaries  to  make  more  productive  use  of  their \ntime and will yield significant health benefits. \n \n\nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \nObjectives  \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCost Estimates \n\nFinancing Plan \n \n\nSection  III  of  the  2001  Millennium  Development  Goals  includes \nhalving, by 2015, the proportion of people who are unable to reach or \ncannot  afford  safe  drinking  water.  The  goals  also  identify  increased \ninvestment  in  the  water  and  sanitation  sectors,  as  one  of  the  main \nstrategies.  In  its  10th  National  Development  Plan  and  its  poverty  \nreduction  strategy,  the    Government    emphasizes  the  need  to  \nimprove  water supply, sanitation,  and community health services. It \naims to increase sector coverage efficiently and equitably as a means \nof  reducing  poverty  and  accelerating  broad-based economic growth \nto meet the needs of the poor and disadvantaged groups. It identifies \naccess to safe drinking water and appropriate sanitation as one of its \npriorities in the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework.  \n \nThe  overall  objective  is  to  expand  the  coverage  of  improved  water \nsupply and sanitation facilities to underserved populations, especially \nto  poor  and  remote  areas,  and  to  improve  health  and  hygiene \npractices related to waterborne and sanitation  diseases. The Project \nwill (i) strengthen participating communities\u2019 capacity and capability to \nplan, cofinance, implement, manage, operate, and maintain improved \nwater supply and sanitation facilities; (ii) increase the participation of \ncastes, ethnic minorities, and women; (iii) increase hygiene education \nthrough  awareness  campaigns;  (iv)  develop \nthe  capacity  and \ncapability of a wide range of sectoral support organizations, such as \nnongovernment  organizations/community-based  organizations, \nto \nprovide  efficient  and  cost-effective support to communities and local \nauthorities  so  as  to  improve  RWSS  service  delivery;  (v)  support  the \nimplementation of the National Water Supply Sector Policy 1998 and \nthe  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Strategy  and  Action \nthe  Government\u2019s \nPlan;  and \ndecentralization  efforts  by  focusing  project  activities  and  decision \nmaking at the local authorities and community levels. \n \nThe  project  has  two  components.  The  RWSS  component  includes \ncommunity  mobilization  and  capacity  building  for  sustainability; \nconstruction  of  community  water  supply  and  sanitation  services; \nhealth  and  hygiene  program;  and  gender,  caste  and  ethnic  minority \nprogram.  The  institutional  strengthening  component  will  seek  to \nstrengthen the DDCs to provide water supply and sanitation services, \nand support the decentralization policy and the Department of Water \nSupply and Sewerage (DWSS). \n \nThe  estimated  project  cost  is  $35.7  million  equivalent,  comprising \nforeign exchange of $12.1 million (34%) and local currency equivalent \nof $23.6 million (66%).  \n \n\n(vi)  support  and  strengthen \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nLocal authorities (DDC and VDC) \nBeneficiaries  \n\nTotal \nCost \n24.0 \n7.7 \n0.4 \n3.6 \n35.7 \nDDC = district development committee, VDC = village development committee. \n\nForeign \nExchange \n12.1 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n12.1 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n11.9 \n7.7 \n0.4 \n3.6 \n23.6 \n\nTotal \n\n($ million) \n\n% \n \n67 \n22 \n1 \n10 \n100 \n\n\fLoan Amounts and Terms \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nExecuting Agency \n\n \nProcurement \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n\n \n\n  v\n\nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent  to  $24  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  The \nloan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nan interest rate charge of 1% per annum during the grace  period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the Loan Agreement. \n \nUntil 30 June 2010 \n \n31 December 2009 \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\nimplementation  of \n\nthe  communities  will  have \n\nA  project  management  unit  will  be  established  in  Kathmandu.  To \nhead  the  unit,  the  Ministry  of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) \nwill  appoint  a  project  director  (class  I  officer  with  sector  experience) \nwho will provide management and policy support to the district-based \nwater  and  sanitation  support  teams  (WSSTs)  and  will  facilitate  a \ninstitutional \ndetailed  strategy  and \nstrengthening component. WSSTs will be established within the DDC \nin  each  of  the  selected  districts  to  support  the  communities  in \nimplementing RWSS schemes and to ensure that the social programs \nare  integrated  in  planning  and  implementation.  WSST  together  with \nthe DDC will provide technical support for the RWSS component. A \nparticipatory  approach  will  be  adopted  to  formulate  and  design  the \nRWSS  schemes,  and \nthe  main \nresponsibility for scheme identification, design, and implementation. \n \nMPPW  is  the  Executing  Agency,  with  responsibility  delegated  to \nDWSS. \n \nGoods  and  services  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in \nthe \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines \nGovernment\u2019s  procurement  procedures  acceptable \nto  ADB.  \nEquipment  packages  valued  at  $500,000  equivalent  or  less  will  be \nprocured  following  international  shopping  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB and packages valued at $50,000 equivalent or less will be under \ndirect  purchasing  procedures.  There  will  be  no  procurement  by \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Civil  works  contracts  for  the  rural \ncomponent  will  be  small,  with  an  average  value  of  $10,000\u201315,000 \nequivalent  and  will  follow  community  participation  in  procurement  in \nADB's Guidelines for Procurement. \n \nThe  Project  will  require  1,217  person-months  of  consulting  services \n(15  person-months \nfor \ninstitutional  reform,  finance  and  accounting,  social  development, \ncommunity  development,  and  project  management.  One  consulting \nfirm  will  provide  consulting  services  to  the  PMU.  For  the  rural \ncomponent, 10 consulting contracts (2 contracts per batch of districts) \nwill  provide  consulting  services  to  the  WSSTs.  Consultants  and \nnongovernment  organizations/private  sector  organizations  will  be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based selection method and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  of  domestic \nconsultants. \n \n\ninternational,  and  1,202  of  domestic) \n\nfor  Procurement  and \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nThe  main  benefits  of  the  Project  will  be  (i)  improved  health  and \nnutrition;  (ii)  less  resources  (time  and  cash)  spent  by  households  to \nobtain water, especially by women and young girls; and (iii) improved \nconditions  for  women,  and  socially  excluded  castes  and  groups.  By \nreducing child mortality and malnutrition due to waterborne diseases, \nand  increasing  environmental  sustainability  due  to  reduction  of \ngroundwater extraction and elimination of unsafe sanitation practices, \nthe Project directly addresses both ADB\u2019s and the Government\u2019s goal \nof  poverty  reduction  and  contributes  to  the  achievement  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s millennium goals. \n \nOther  benefits  include  improved  school  attendance  due  to  better \nhealth  and  reduced  water  carrying  burdens,  especially  for  girls; \nsupport  for  decentralization  efforts;  improved  sectoral  management \nand  increased  sector  capacity;  and  improved  health  of  the  general \npopulation and reduced mortality. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  improved  WSS  facilities  and  associated \nhealth services  to  about  1,200  rural  communities  in  the  Midwestern \nand  Far  Western  development  regions.  About  850,000  people  will \nbenefit  from  safe  drinking  water.  The  Project  focuses  on  poor  areas \nwhere  conflict  has  heightened  poverty.  The  project  efforts  will  focus \nmore  on  addressing  the  needs  of  the  historically  underserved \ncommunities in previously conflict-affected areas. \n \nThe Project assumes (i) a stable political environment and economic \nstability in Nepal; (ii) continuing Government support to the Project, in \nthe  form  of  available  funds,  support  to  the  decentralization  process, \nand implementation of the RWSS sector strategy and action plan; and \n(iii) DWSS acting as a facilitator of RWSS.  \n \nIt is assumed that the rural communities will demand improvement of \nwater  infrastructure  in  their  communities  and  will  be  willing  and  able \nto  contribute  20%  of  the  capital  investment  and  to  take  over  the \noperation and maintenance of the schemes. \n \nA lack of progress in the peace process is also a significant risk as it \nmay  impede  the  implementation  of  the  rural  component  due  to \nsecurity  and  safety  concerns  in  some  districts  and  because  local \nelections are not likely to be held unless the peace negotiations take \nplace.  Project  activities  could  continue,  albeit  more  slowly,  if  the \ncurrent cease-fire does not hold. \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \n I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Nepal for the Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. \nThe project framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nIn  its  10th  National  Development  Plan  and  its  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy,  the \nGovernment  emphasizes  the  need  to  improve  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  community  health \nservices  in  Nepal,  and  increase  coverage  efficiently  and  equitably  to  accelerate  broad-based \neconomic  growth  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  poor  and  disadvantaged groups. The Government \nidentifies access to safe drinking water and appropriate sanitation as one of its priorities in the \nMedium-Term  Expenditure  Framework.  Section  III  of  the  2001  Millennium  Development  Goals \n(MDG) includes halving, by 2015, the  proportion  of  people  who  are  unable  to  reach  or  cannot \nafford  safe  drinking  water.  The  MDG  also  identifies  increased  investment  in  the  water  and \nsanitation sectors, as one of their main strategies.1 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) country \nstrategy  for  the  social  sectors  emphasizes  the  development  of  adequate  infrastructure  and \nservices in rural areas.2 \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \n Nepal has less than 0.4% of the world\u2019s population, but possesses 2.3% of the world\u2019s \nwater resources. Despite the abundant of water resources, however, the country\u2019s harsh terrain \nmakes  access  to  water  supply  difficult  for  many  segments  of  the  population.  The  Government \nestimates water supply coverage to be around 70% nationwide, but the quality of the coverage \ndata is highly variable and does not necessarily imply that the systems are working. Access in \nrural  areas  is  substantially  lower.  Many  rely  on  shallow  wells,  ponds,  and  streams, which are \noften  both  biologically  and  chemically  contaminated.  The  burdens  associated  with  shortage  of \nwater  are  borne  disproportionately  by  women  and  children.  Especially  in  the  mountainous \ndistricts, women and female children can spend as much as 4-5 hours a day fetching water from \ndistant sources.  \n \n\n4. \nThe  problems  associated  with  limited  access  to  sanitation  and  low  levels  of  hygiene \nawareness are extensive and, again are borne disproportionately by women and children. The \nUnited  Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reports that diarrhea accounts for up to 25% \nof all childhood deaths in the country. In terms of national morbidity patterns, ailments related to \ninadequate  water  and  sanitation  account  for  almost  72%  of  all  ailments  reported.3 Sanitation \ncoverage in 1997 was 61% in urban areas and only 17.5% in rural areas. \n  \n5. \nCurrently,  donors  are  increasing  their  financial  support  for  improved  rural  water  supply \nand  sanitation  (RWSS)  services.  To  help  focus  these  efforts,  representatives  of  nearly  all \nproviders  of  RWSS  services  participated  in  a  consensus  building  process  to  develop  a  broad \n                                                 \n1   United Nations 2001. Road Map Toward the Implementation of the United Nations Millennium Declaration. Report \n\nof the Secretary-General. \n\n2   In  2000,  the  Government  of  Nepal  requested  ADB  assistance  to  prepare  a  community-based water supply and \nsanitation  project.  In  March  2002,  technical  assistance  (TA3844-NEP:  Community  Based  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation Project) for $750,000 was approved. \n\n3  Skin  disease,  29.8%;  worm  infestation,n  14.9%;  diarrhea,  12.6%;  dysentery,  7.6%;  gastritis,  7%.

The purpose of the sector strategy is to formulate \na  common  institutional,  financial,  community-based  approach  for  planning  and  delivering \nimproved  RWSS  services.  The  strategy  reflects  Government  policies  related  to  decentralized \nservice  provision  and  financial  control,  evolving  responsibilities  of  line  agencies  and  local \nauthorities,  and  acceptance  of  the  importance  of  full  community  participation  in  subproject \nplanning and implementation. The sector strategy confirms the importance of strong community \nparticipation  for  sustainability,  and  supports  the  need  to  integrate  community  demand  for \nimproved  services,  willingness  to  pay,  and  affordability  in  project  planning,  financing  and \nimplementation. \n \n \n6. \nA  major  institutional  decentralization  effort  is  under  way  across  all  sectors.  The  Local \nSelf-Governance Act (LSGA) of 1999 mandates decentralization from central to local levels and \noutlines  the  roles  of  the  local  authorities  at  district  and  village  levels.  The  LSGA  is  clear  that \ndistrict and village authorities will be taking increasing responsibility for planning and providing \nrural  infrastructure  (including  those  associated  with  water).  Two  district-level  UNDP-supported \nprograms - the Local Governance Program and the Participatory District Development Program \n-  are  being  implemented.  Both  intend  to  establish  an  enabling  environment  to  implement key \nLSGA  provisions.  They  will  be  integrated  in  the  Local  Governance  Strengthening  Program, \nsupported by the Department for International Development (DFID), UNDP, Norway, the Danish \nInternational Development Assistance, the Netherlands International Development Cooperation \nAgencies,  and  possibly  the  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr technische Zusammenarbeit. District development \nplanning  activities,  ongoing  for  several  years,  have  resulted  in  district  periodic  plans  for  most \ndistricts.  The  LSGA  requires  that  line  ministry departments such as the Department of Water \nSupply and Sewerage (DWSS) no longer implement subprojects at the district or village levels \nas  they  had  in  the  past.  Sectoral  implementation  responsibilities  will  change  even  further  as \nmajor donor organizations follow best practice, lead by nongovernment organizations (NGOs), \nthe  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Fund  Development  Board  (Fund  Board),  and  bilateral \ndonors \nin  actively  supporting  demand-driven,  community-based  project  planning  and \nimplementation. \n \n7. \nCompounding  all  the  usual  challenges  of  sectoral  development  is  the  considerable \npolitical uncertainty in Nepal. Major transitions within the last 2 years have greatly complicated \nnot only sectoral planning, but also virtually all other activities. Local elections were not held in \ntime  and  the  terms  of  elected  local  authorities  officials  expired  in  mid-July  2002.  National \nelections  scheduled  for  November  2002  were  cancelled.  As  a  result,  there  is  no  citizen \nrepresentation  at  any  level  of  Government.  This  has  specific  impacts  at  the  district  level  and \nbelow,  where  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  sectoral  development  activities  are  focused.   \nThe  Government\u2019s  nascent  decentralization  efforts  have  yet  to  be  firmly  institutionalized,  and \nthere  are  clear  conflicts  among  line  ministries  themselves  as  to  how  and  when  transfer  of \nresponsibilities  and  associated  budgets  will  effectively  take  place.  Full  support  for  the \ndecentralization  efforts  will  dramatically  improve  services  of  WSS  facilities  to  those  who  so \ndesperately  need  them.  Political  stability,  elections,  and  implementation  of  the  terms  of  the \nLSGA  would  provide  the  framework  for  dramatic  improvement  of  RWSS  service  delivery.  A \ndetailed discussion of the policy environment and ongoing sector reforms is in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n8. \nIn  spite  of  considerable  RWSS  investment,  both  water  and  sanitation  coverage  remain \nwell  below  targeted  levels.  Awareness  of  the  importance  of  hygiene  and  sanitation  behavioral \nchange is limited in many communities. At the core of the slow progress in the sector are limited \nresources, and lack of accountability and collaboration with stakeholders. About 5-7% of Nepal\u2019s \n\n\f3 \n\ndevelopment  budget  is  allocated  to  the  water  and  sanitation  sector.  Of  this,  two  thirds  is \nfinanced  by  external  sources,  including  ADB.  Unfortunately,  coordination  and  dialogue  among \nassistance  agencies  are  inadequate  and  result  in  significant  overlaps  in  target  areas  and \ninefficient  mobilization  of  available  resources.  Other  significant  problems  are  lack  of \ntransparency and comprehensive information in the sector; inadequate community participation \nduring  implementation  of  water  supply  projects;  continued  exclusion  of  women,  castes  and \nethnic  minorities  from  community  decision  making;  inefficient  mobilization  of  NGOs;  weak \nprivate  sector  activity  in  rural  areas;  inadequate  health  and  hygiene  education  programs;  and \nlack of focus on sanitation improvements. These facts have generated considerable support for \nsectoral development among multilateral and bilateral donors and international and local NGOs. \nEach  has  developed  a  slightly  different  approach  to  dealing  with  these  problems.  Through  an \nextensive  consensus  building  process,  a  draft  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector \nStrategy, along with a financial envelope, was developed to help rationalize sector development, \ncreate workable institutional arrangements, and assist the Government in reaching its coverage \ntargets. Appendix 3 describes external assistance in the sector. \n \n  The  institutional  context  of  the  RWSS  sector  in  Nepal  is  changing  as  a  result  of \n9. \ndecentralization.  The  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works  (MPPW)  remains  principally \nresponsible  for  water  supply-related  activity  in  the  country,  including  developing  sector \nstrategies  and  programs,  overseeing  budgets,  and  coordinating  external  assistance  activities. \nThe Department of Water Supply and Sanitation (DWSS), under MPPW, has been responsible \nfor water supply in semiurban and rural areas. It is required to hand over completed schemes to \nlocal authorities and water user groups (WUGs) for operation and maintenance (O&M). DWSS \nhas been unable to adequately address issues, in the past, with regard to gender, participation, \nand  NGO  involvement.  The  Government  is  restructuring  DWSS  by  changing  its  role  from \nimplementation to facilitation (technical support, regulation, quality control and monitoring, etc.). \nPlanning  and  implementing  of  smaller  schemes  will  be  decentralized  to  the  district  level  and \nbeneficiary  communities.  The  Project\u2019s  decentralized  policy  and  implementation  modality \nstrongly support the letter and spirit of the LSGA of 1999, and is intended to support institutional \nreform and decentralization. This approach promotes good local governance through a project \nimplementation  framework  mandating  full  participation  by  beneficiary  groups  in  subproject \nplanning, implementation, and follow-up support. \n \n10. \nAs the lead provider of external assistance, ADB has completed four rural water supply \nand  sanitation  projects  in  Nepal  since  1985,  for  a  total  of  $65  million.  The  latest,  the  fourth \nRWSS4 project, was successfully completed in early 2002. The primary lessons learned through \nefforts  of  ADB5  and  others  in  the  sector  are  (i)  the  importance  of  emphasizing  community \nconsultation,  mobilization,  to  improve  system  sustainability;  (ii)  the  need  for  inclusive  gender, \ncaste  and  ethnic  minority  implementation  modalities;  (iii)  the  need  to  emphasize  hygiene  and \nsanitation education programs to maximize the impact of external assistance interventions; and \n(iv)  the  need  for  closer  coordination  between  assistance  efforts  to  avoid  redundancies  and \nidentify potential synergies. \n \n11. \nThe  consensus  building  process  undertaken  during  project  preparation  revealed \nsignificant  agreement  on  many  substantive  issues  including  community  contribution;  the  need \nfor gender, caste, and ethnic sensitivity; the importance of hygiene and sanitation improvement; \n                                                 \n4   ADB. 1996.

The  process  also  demonstrated  the  value  of  broad  participation  that  included \ngovernment agencies, NGOs, external donors, local authorities representatives, and beneficiary \ncommunities in development if a comprehensive sector strategy is to have local ownership. The \nprocess revealed issues related to institutional arrangements that were not so easily addressed, \ngiven  the  ongoing  decentralization  process.  The  subproject  appraisal  in  five  communities  and \nthe field visits during fact-finding substantiated and confirmed the statements and conclusions of \nthe stakeholders.  \n \nIn line with the Government and ADB policies and the lessons learned6, the Project will \n12. \nfinance  investments  in  RWSS  to  address  the  critical  need  to  extend  the  coverage  of  water \nsupply,  sanitation,  and  community  health  services  to  underserved  and  unserved  communities. \nThe Project will focus especially on poorer communities and those in remote areas or in conflict-\naffected areas.  The  project  design  is  based  on  the  outcomes  of  a  comprehensive  stakeholder \nconsensus  building  exercise  undertaken  under  PPTA  NEP-3844,  which  resulted  in  the  draft \nRural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Strategy  and  Action  Plan.  The  Project  and  the \nstrategy and action plan follow the policies spelled out in the National Water Sector Policy and \nStrategy, 1988, the draft National Sanitation Policy, 2002, the 10th National Development Plan, \nNepal\u2019s  Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework,  and  Nepal\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Plan. \nThe  Project  will  address  key  sector  issues  by  (i)  including  local  authorities  and  community \nparticipation in planning and implementing of RWSS subprojects, with communities contributing \nat  least  20%  of  capital  costs  and  becoming  owners  of  the  assets;  (ii)  delegating  O&M  of  the \nschemes  to  the  WUG;  (iii)  implementing  a  strategy  to  change  DWSS\u2019  role  from  provider  to \nfacilitator;  and  (iv)  promoting  public awareness campaigns to educate consumers about water \nas a scarce resource and the relationship between water, sanitation, and health.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\n The overall objective is to expand the coverage of improved water supply and sanitation \n13. \nfacilities to underserved populations, especially to poor and remote areas, and to improve health \nand hygiene practices related to waterborne and sanitation-related diseases. The Project will (i) \nstrengthen  participating  communities\u2019  capacity  and  capability  to  plan,  co-finance, implement, \nmanage, operate, and maintain improved WSS facilities; (ii) increase participation of all castes, \nethnic  minorities,  and  women;  (iii)  increase  hygiene  education  through  awareness  campaigns; \n(iv)  develop  the  capacity  and  capability  of  a  wide  range  of  sectoral  support  organizations, \nincluding  NGOs/community-based organizations (CBOs), to provide efficient and cost-effective \nsupport  to  communities  and  local  authorities;  (v)  support  the  implementation  of  the  1998 \nNational  Water  Supply  Sector  Policy  and  the  draft  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector \nStrategy  and  Action  Plan  (Supplementary  Appendix  C);  and  (vi)  support  and  strengthen  the \nGovernment\u2019s  decentralization  efforts  by  focusing  project  activities  and  decision  making  at  the \nlocal authorities and community levels. \n\n                                                 \n6 Supplementary Appendix B describes in detail how the project design incorporated these lessons. \n\n\f5 \n\nB. \n\nSector Loan Approach \n\n14. \nThis  Project  has  been  formulated  as  a  sector  loan  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  10th \nNational  Development  Plan  and  decentralization  strategy.  ADB\u2019s  sector  loan  modality  was \nselected  as  the  most  appropriate  method  of  financing  the  Project.  ADB\u2019s  sector  loan  criteria \nhave  been  met:  (i)  as  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  10th  Plan,  the  RWSS  sector  investment  plan \nunder  the  Project  is  well-conceived  and  appropriately  formulated  to  meet  priority  needs  of  the \nsector;  (ii)  the  sector  institutions  have  the  capability  to  implement  the  draft  RWSS  sector \nstrategy; and (iii) sector policies are appropriate. \n \nC. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe Project intends to use a community-based, demand-driven approach to extend WSS \n15. \nfacilities to approximately 1,200 communities in the 21 Districts prioritized by the Government, \nADB, and major stakeholders.  Selection of the project districts followed the prioritization set by \nthe gender-adjusted human development index, existing WSS coverage, incidence of diarrhea \nand  other  waterborne  diseases,  presence  of  occupational  castes  and  ethnic  minorities,  and \nremoteness  from  developed  areas.7  The  Project  has  a  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation \ncomponent (the rural component) and an institutional strengthening component. \n\n1. \n\nThe Rural Component \n\n16. \nThe  rural  component  will  implement  RWSS  infrastructure  (gravity,  hand  pump  on  tube \nwell, piped with overhead tank, and rainwater systems) in 21 districts. Beneficiary communities \nwill  implement  WSS  subprojects  with  support  from  NGOs/CBOs,  village  development \ncommittees (VDCs) and DDCs.  The Project will be demand-driven. \n \n17. \nEquity and pro-poor considerations through targeted subsidies will be incorporated in the \nrural  component,8  based  on  subproject  selection  criteria  applied  by  the  Water  and  Sanitation \nSupport Team (WSST) (Appendix 4).  Direct subsidy for latrine construction is recommended for \npoor  households  as  defined  by  indicators  such  as  food  insufficiency,  households  with  female \nheads, wage laborers, or disability. \n \n18. \nA  demand-driven  approach  will  be  used  to  achieve  institutional  and  financial \nsustainability  of  the  project  benefits.    To  achieve  this  end,  the  direct  beneficiaries  will  be \nrequired  to  make  minimal  contributions  to  the  Project  to  qualify  for  project  funding.  This \nminimum  contribution  (local  counterpart  funding)  is  as  follows:  (i)  DDCs  will  be  required  to \ncontribute up-front and in cash 10% of their locally generated annual revenue for the previous \nfiscal  year;  (ii)  VDCs  will  contribute  up-front  and  in  cash  2.5%  of  the  total  cost  of  the \nconstruction of the schemes within the jurisdiction of the VDCs to the relevant water user and \nsanitation committee (WUSC)9 project accounts; and (iii) all communities wishing to participate \nin  the  Project  will  be  required  to  contribute  at  least  20%10  with  more  than  1%  of  this  20%  in \ncash.  Communities  must  also  be  willing  to  take  full  managerial  and  financial  responsibility  for \nO&M. The Project requires that regular O&M costs be fully borne by the WUG members.  \n \n\n                                                 \n7   Supplementary Appendix D lists the districts and gives the district selection criteria. \n8  Equity and pro-poor considerations are set out in the Government\u2019s Community Contribution in Water Supply and \n\nSanitation Policy, 2002. \n\n9   WUGs comprise the WUSC, which is the legal entity elected by and representing the WUGs. \n10 For poor communities in remote inaccessible areas, the minimum contribution will be reduced to 10% as set out in \n\nthe Government's Policy on Community Contribution, 2002. \n\n\f6 \n\n19. \n\nThe rural component will include the following activities: \n\na. \n\nCommunity Mobilization and Capacity Building for Sustainability \n\ninto  WUGs  and  participate  actively \n\nThe rural component focuses on developing ownership of the subprojects by the project \n20. \nbeneficiaries,  who  will  organize \nin  design  and \nimplementation.  The Project will train and assist communities to organize WUGs; develop their \ncapacity  to  plan,  construct,  manage,  operate,  and  maintain  water  supply  schemes  and \nsanitation facilities, and ensure the sustainability of water supply after project completion.11   \n \n21. \nThe  WUG  will  plan,  build,  manage  and  operate,  and  maintain  their  water  supply  and \npublic sanitation facilities. This requirement will be made explicit to community members during \ninitial community mobilization before any formal commitment by the Project, or the community. \nWUG members will receive training in the importance of O&M support, and guidelines for tariff \nsetting  and  revenue  collection  to  ensure  that  funds  are  available  for  O&M.  The  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  will  develop  manuals  to  distribute  to  the  DDCs  and  the  WUGs.  In \naddition, village maintenance workers, preferably married women (who are more likely to remain \nin  the  village),  will  be  selected  and  trained  to  operate  and  maintain  the  facilities  provided.    To \nensure  that  funds  will  be  available  for  O&M  and  to  foster  the  practice  of  tariff  collection, \ncommunities must establish an O&M fund. \n\nb. \n\nConstruction of Community Water Supply and Sanitation Facilities \n\nThe proposed Project will finance the construction by WUG of water supply schemes12 in \n22. \napproximately  1,200  communities,13  including  the  rehabilitation  of  approximately  250  existing \nschemes. The 1,200 schemes will be approximately 65% gravity, 23% tube well, 11% overhead \ntank,  and  1%  rainwater.  The  main  technical  options  for  water  supply  under  the  Project  are  (i) \ngravity  pipe  system  (ii)  rainwater  harvesting  (iii)  piped  systems  with  overhead  tank  and  (iv) \ngroundwater  wells  with  hand  pumps.  The  WUG  will  select  the  appropriate  water  supply \ntechnology from the options in the project technical guidelines.14 \n \n23. \nThe  Project  will  also  (i)  set  up  a  Sanitation  Revolving  Fund  to  provide  credit  for \nconstruction  of  individual  family  latrines,  and  (ii)  finance  sanitation  facilities  for  schools. \nManagement  and  operation  of  the  fund  will  reflect  best  practice  as  established  by  the  Fund \nBoard that uses this approach to support community sanitation. The Sanitation Revolving Fund \nwill provide initial seed money for the community revolving fund and will be sufficient to provide \ncredit to 25% of the households to build approximately 30,000 family latrines.15 The Project will \nprovide  subsidies  of  NRs5,000  in  the  terai  and  NRs3,000  in  the  hills  to  10%  of  the  poorest \nhouseholds  in  each  community.  The  beneficiaries  will  choose  among  simple  pit  latrines, \nventilated improved pit latrines, double pit latrines, and pour flush latrines. \n \n24. \nThe  rural  component  will  support  the  current  National  Water  Supply  Policy  (1998)  by \nmaking  WUGs  the  center  of  implementation.  The  WUGs  will  register  according  to  Water \nResource Act 1992 to establish a WUSC. Each WUG will apply for a license under the terms of \nWater Supply Regulations 1998, after which it will be entitled to construct, operate, and maintain \n\n                                                 \n11 Supplementary Appendix E describes the roles and responsibilities of the WUG and their elected WUSC. \n12  Includes water treatment to meet WHO water quality standard if required. \n13 Can include ongoing Government schemes if they are in district plan and all project conditions have been met.   \n14  Supplementary Appendix F describes the project technical guidelines for the schemes. \n15  Under the Sanitation Revolving Fund, the maximum credit for constructing a latrine will amount to NRs7,500 in the \n\nterai and NRs5,000 in the hills. \n\n\f7 \n\nthe scheme, and charge consumers for water provided to them. To ensure the sustainability and \nactive  participation  of  the  community,  the  WUG  will  contribute  to  the  scheme  as  follows:  (i)  at \nleast 20% of the cost of the scheme16 with at least 1% of that 20% to be up-front in cash; and (ii) \nthe estimated cost of 1 year of O&M of the scheme up-front in cash. With poor communities in \nremote inaccessible areas, the minimum contribution is reduced to 10%17 under the terms in the \nnational Community Contribution in Water Supply and Sanitation Policy, 2002. \n\nc. \n\nHealth and Hygiene Program \n\n25. \nTo  maximize  the  health  impact  of  project  interventions,  and  to  reduce  the  incidence  of \ndiarrhea  and  other  waterborne  diseases,  the  Project  will  adopt  the  hygiene  improvement \nframework18  and  will  (i)  train  and  support  DDCs,  VDCs,  and  community  leaders  in  planning, \nmonitoring,  and  evaluating  of  sanitation  and  hygiene  improvement  following  the  guidelines  set \nout in the basic sanitation package19 developed by United Nations Children's Fund/DWSS; and \n(ii) implement for WUG members and beneficiary communities awareness programs in hygiene, \nhealth and sanitation practices. The Project will specifically incorporate gender-appropriate and \nuser-friendly approaches for boys, girls, men and women, and out-of-school children. \n\nd. \n\nGender, Caste and Ethnic Minority Program \n\nTraditionally, women, lower caste members, and ethnic minorities have not participated \n26. \nfully  in  community  decision  making.  Some  castes  and  ethnic  minorities  have  had  restricted \naccess  to  WSS  provided  through  projects.  The  rural  component  will  implement  training  and \nawareness programs to increase active participation of disadvantaged groups and women in all \nproject activities. As a condition for funding, communities will have to form a WUSC with at least \na  proportional  representation  of  poor,  castes,  ethnic  minority  groups  and  with  at  least  50%  of \ntheir executive and general members being women (of any caste or ethnic group).  Proportional \nrepresentation by the Project means that if, for example 30% of households in a community are \nDalits, then at least 30% of the members of the WUSC must be Dalits (regardless of gender). \nAppendix 5 describes the targets and activities in a program set for the poor, gender and castes \nand ethnic minority group. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nThe Institutional Strengthening Component \n\n27. \nThe institutional component will support the implementation of the National Water Supply \nSector Policy,1998 and the draft National Sanitation Policy, 2002, in line with the Government's \ndecentralization  policies  as  set  out  in  the  LSGA.  This  component  will  assist  Government \ninstitutions in the rural water sector to fully take on their new roles and responsibilities assigned \nunder decentralization by strengthening DDCs capacity to provide WSS through a community- \nbased demand-driven approach. The Project will also support MPPW to adopt the institutional \nchanges required by the devolution of functions to DDCs. \n\n                                                 \n16  Including contribution in kind. \n17 Community  contribution  follows  the  requirements  set  out  in  the  Government\u2019s  Community  Contribution  in  Water \nSupply and Sanitation Policy. 2002. Cost of airfreight transportation for equipment and materials will be excluded. \n18 The  hygiene  improvement  framework  provides  an  integrated  approach  that  combines  expanded  access  to \n\nhardware with hygiene promotion and supportive enabling environments to reduce diarrheal disease. \n\n19  DWSS  and  the  PMU  will  revise  the  basic  sanitation  package  before  implementating of the Health and Hygiene \n\nProgram. \n\n\f8 \n\na. \n \n\nStrengthening  DDC  Capacity \nSanitation \n\nto  Provide  Water  Supply  and \n\n28. \nThe  Project  will  train  and  give  technical  support  to  participating  DDCs  to  allow  them  to \nplan, manage, monitor, and evaluate demand-driven community-based RWSS projects; and to \nimplement  and  monitor  gender  and  caste  and  ethnic  minority  groups  programs,  and  health, \nhygiene, and sanitation awareness programs. \n \nThe Project will provide support to consolidate and develop materials, training packages \n29. \nand  manuals  focusing  on  community  participation,  O&M  of  RWSS,  and  gender,  caste  and \nethnicity issues, which will be incorporated in the various training programs to be conducted at \nthe district, village, and community levels. The Project will also provide for technical assistance \nto orient project staff and stakeholders on these issues and to monitor their progress to ensure \nthat  such  issues  are  not  overlooked  during  the  various  stages  of  the  project  and  individual \nscheme cycle. \n \nProject support to each DDC's WSST will be  for a period of 4 years (two full subproject \n30. \ncycles) upon their satisfactory performance in meeting sector targets and successful progress in \nimplementing and complying with project guidelines. Funding to DDCs in the first year for pilot \nsubprojects  will  be  in  accordance  with  their  annual  plans  and  provision  of  the  DDC \ncontributions.  Further  funding  for  community  mobilization  and  scheme  construction  in \nsubsequent years will depend on the performance of each DDC. DDCs may continue to access \nproject  funds  beyond  two  subproject  cycles  if  their  performance  continues  to  be  satisfactory. \nDDCs' performance will be monitored by the PMU, the MPPW Sector Monitoring and Evaluation \nUnit, and the RWSS sector stakeholder group.   \n \n\nb. \n\nSupporting the Decentralization Policy and DWSS  \n\nThe Project will provide technical assistance for developing and implementing a strategy \n31. \nto  improve  human  resource  allocation  in  line  with  the  new  roles  and  responsibilities  of  DWSS \ndefined under the RWSS sector strategy and action plan and in line with the LSGA. The Project \nwill also (i) undertake a human resource review reflecting DWSS\u2019 new role and train DWSS in \nits new role, including developing and maintaining standardized databases of WSS facilities and \nservices; (ii) rationalize and make consistent the National Water Supply Sector Policy, 1998 with \nthe RWSS Sector Strategy and the existing policies and regulations affecting the RWSS sector; \nand (iii) give technical support to project implementation, such as the development of standards, \nmanuals, and detailed technical guidelines for RWSS.   \n\nD. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nEthnic  Diversity.  All  ethnic  groups  in  the  project  area  are  significantly  represented  in \n32. \nthe  beneficiary  population.  The  activities  in  the  rural  component  pay  particular  attention  to \nincluding all ethnic and caste groups so that benefits will accrue equally to all groups residing in \nthe communities. \n \n33. \nDemand-Driven  and  Participatory  Approach  through  NGOs/CBOs.  The  rural \ncomponent is based on a demand-driven participatory approach facilitated by NGOs to help the \nbeneficiaries  organize  into  WUGs  and  collectively  take  responsibility  for  implementation  and \nO&M  of  the  water  systems.  The  counterpart  NGOs  work  with  the  communities  to  raise \nawareness  and  introduce  the  project  methodology.  Communities  are  required  to  show  their \ncommitment by contributing 20% of the capital cost of schemes. The beneficiaries decide on the \n\n\f9 \n\ntype  of  technology  and,  with  the  assistance  of  WSST  and  NGOs,  take  responsibility  for \ndesigning  and  implementing  the  schemes.  The  Project  provides  the  beneficiaries  with  training \nand  practical  experience  in  project  and  financial  management,  which  will  provide  communities \nwith the skills to initiate other community improvements.  \n \n34. \nNGOs-Supported  Community-Based  Approach.  National  and  district-based  NGOs \nare  central  to  project  implementation.  NGOs  will  be  engaged  to  provide  awareness  programs \nand  train  community  members  and  their  WUSCs.  The  NGOs  will  assist  each  participating \ncommunity in planning and implementing construction activities and in monitoring and reporting \non  progress.  This  NGO-supported  community-based  approach  reflects  best  practices  in  Nepal \nand is successful in there.  Local and district-based NGOs and CBOs have remained active in \nthe  conflict  areas  over  the  past  several  years  of  the  insurgency.  Because  they  were  not \npolitically driven and were able to work with both sides to help meet the needs of communities, \nNGOs are able to continue their social and local infrastructure development projects. \n \n35. \nSupport to Decentralization. The Project supports the Government\u2019s decentralization \nstrategy and helps implement it by focusing project implementation at the district level and using \nNGOs  and  private  sector  organizations  to  assist  with  implementation  at  the  community  level. \nThe  DDC  will  receive  training  and  assistance  to  develop  their  skills  and  to  enhance  their \ncapacity to work with NGOs and CBOs using participatory, demand-driven approaches.  \n \n36. \nPolicy.  A  unified  program  approach  has  been  created  by  first  developing  the  RWSS \nSector  Strategy  and  Action  Plan  through  consultative  stakeholder  workshops  that  thoroughly \ninvolved the sector stakeholders at every step. This process resulted in several specific policy \nrecommendations to update relevant sector policies and strategies. The Project assists ongoing \npolicy reforms through support to the formal stakeholder group, which has a sector policy role. \nThe Project also provides resources to enable DWSS to adapt to its new role in the sector. \n\nE. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n37. \nThe  project  cost  presented  in  Table  1  is  based  on  an  indicative  1,200  subprojects  and \nother components as well as discussions with stakeholders and field visits. The total cost of the \nProject is estimated at $35.7 million equivalent, including about $2.3 million equivalent for duties \nand  taxes.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is  estimated  at  $12.1  million,  or  about  34%  of  the  total \nproject  cost,  including  $0.7  million  for  interest  on  the  ADB  loan  during  construction. The local \ncurrency  cost  is  estimated  at  $23.6  million  equivalent,  about  66%  of  the  total  project  cost. \nDetailed cost estimates are provided in Appendix 6. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Cost by Component \n($ million) \n\n \nProject Componenta \nA.

The  ADB  loan  will \nhave a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate charge of 1% per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. ADB will cover 100% of the foreign exchange costs \nand part of the local currency costs. DDCs, VDCs, and the beneficiaries themselves will meet \nthe balance of 32% of the intervention.  \n \n39. \nADB will cover a portion of the costs relating to civil works, office equipment, consulting \nservices, and training and public awareness and education campaigns, but will not include the \nsalaries  of  regular  project  staff,  procurement  of  vehicles20  (excluding  motorcycles),  rental  of \noffice space, and taxes and duties. The financing of the local currency cost by ADB is justified \nby the nature of the Project, which will address local poverty, gender concerns, caste and ethnic \nminorities, and environmental health issues in the project areas. The Government will disburse \nthe  funds  to  DDCs  as  a  grant  through  budgetary  allocation.

MPPW has \ndelegated to DWSS authority to execute the Project. A PMU under DWSS will be established in \nKathmandu to support the Project. A national project steering committee (NPSC), chaired by the \nsecretary MPPW, who will be the sector coordinator, will guide the PMU and make all policy and \nstrategic decisions. The Government will establish the sector stakeholder group21 chaired by the \nsecretary  MPPW,  and  will  call  for  a  meeting  at  least  twice  a  year  to  ensure  (i) coordination of \nsector  reforms  and  interventions  supported  by  external  funds  and  the  Government,  and \n(ii) exchange of information.  \n \n\n                                                 \n20 As per current ADB/Nepal policy on the use of motor vehicles. \n21 The  sector  stakeholder  group  will  include  representatives  of  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  Ministry  of  Local \nDevelopment  (MLD),  National  Planning  Council  (NPC),  DWSS,  Association  of  District  Development  Committees \nNepal  (ADDCN),  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH),  Ministry  of  Water  Resources,  the  Fund  Board,  ADB,  World  Bank, \nDepartment for International Development, UNICEF, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Finland, Water Aid, Helvetas, the \nprivate sector, and others. \n\n\f11 \n\nThe  NPSC  will  provide  overall  coordination  and  guidance  for  the  Project.22  During \n41. \nimplementation, the NPSC will deal with policy matters as they arise, and coordinate with other \nministries and agencies. It will meet every 3 months, or as often as necessary. \n \nThe  PMU  will  be  established  within  DWSS\u2019  Kathmandu  office.  An  experienced  project \n42. \ndirector at the level of a Class I officer with sector experience will be appointed to head the PMU \nfor the duration of the Project. A core team of MPPW/DWSS counterparts, along with a team of \ninternational  and  domestic  consultants,  will  assist  the  project  director.  Supported  by  the  PMU, \nthe project director will coordinate all activities under the Project; will be directly responsible for \noverall  project  management,  monitoring,  and  supervision  under  the  guidance  of  the  director \ngeneral of DWSS; and will report to the MPPW secretary. \n \nThe  PMU  will  (i)  prepare  the  overall  project  implementation  plan  and  consolidated \n43. \nannual work plan; (ii) consolidate and develop training materials, policy manuals, and technical \nguidelines; (iii) assist eligible DDCs in preparing annual and periodic plans for the RWSS sector;  \n(iv) provide management and technical support to DDCs; (v) monitor and supervise all project \nmanagement activities; (vi) organize all monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities; (vii) ensure \nsatisfactory implementation of the gender action plan and caste and ethnic minority programs; \n(viii)  liaise  with  the  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Unit  of  MPPW;  (ix)  carry  out  financial \nmanagement and reporting of project accounts; and (x) prepare necessary progress reports and \nthe project completion report. The PMU will be properly staffed and assisted by consultants with \nexpertise in gender and social development, institutional reform, finance and accounting, M&E, \nhealth and hygiene, water supply, and contract management.23 \n\nb. \n\nDistrict Level \n\n44. \nThe  DDCs  will  be  the  project  implementation  agency  at  district  level.  A  WSST  will  be \nestablished  in  each  district  as  soon  as  it  enters  into  a  project  agreement  with  MPPW  that \ndelineates project implementation arrangements including consulting requirements. The WSST \nteam  leader  will  be  a  Class  II  officer  with  sector  experience,  and  appointed  by  MPPW  in \nconsultation with of the DDC chairperson. The officer will report directly to the DDC chairperson. \nA core team of DDC counterpart staff of at least one water supply engineer, two overseers, one \ncommunity  development  officer,  and  one  accountant  (full-  time  and  for  the  duration  of  the \nProject),  along  with  a  team  of  domestic  consultants  (gender  and  social  development,  financial \naccounting,  procurement  and  contract  management,  and  M&E)  will  assist  the  WSST  team \nleader.  If  the  DDC  is  unable  to  provide  the  required  counterpart  staff,  the  DDC  will  request \nMPPW to depute staff. \n \n45. \n A district water coordination committee (DWCC) chaired by the chairperson of the DDC \nwill  be  established  in  each  DDC  to  guide  and  coordinate  the  activities  of  DDCs,  VDCs,  and \ncommunities, and liaise with the PMU. Each participating VDC will be staffed by at least one full-\ntime secretary for the duration of the project. \n  \n46. \nDDCs  will  contract  NGOs,  CBOs  and  consulting  firms  to  initially  contact  communities \npotentially  interested  in  participating  in  the  Project.  Interested  communities,  assisted  by  VDCs \nand  NGOs/CBOs,  will  develop  and  submit  applications  for  project  assistance.  These \napplications  will  be  reviewed  and  prioritized  by  the  DDC  to  be  included  in  the  district  periodic \n                                                 \n22 The National Project Steering Committee will be chaired by the Secretary of MPPW and will include the Director \nGeneral  of  DWSS  as  member  secretary  and  representatives  from  MOF,  NPC,  MPPW,  MLD,  MOH,  Ministry of \nWater Resources, and the ADDCN.  \n\n23  Details of PMU and WSST responsibilities are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n\n\f12 \n\nand annual plans. NGOs/CBOs will (i) assist the selected communities to establish WUGs; (ii) \nguide communities through the creation of a community action plan; (iii) assist and train WUGs \non planning, procurement, construction, management, O&M of water supply schemes; and (iv) \nincrease awareness on gender, castes and ethnic minorities and implement a WUG strategy to \nensure active participation of these groups and compliance with the proportional representation \nand gender targets. Consulting firms may be engaged to undertake specific tasks in support of \nthe  Project,  such  as  technical  and  financial  audits,  training  the  DDCs  and  NGOs,  and \nevaluations. \n \n47. \nThe PMU will procure equipment only for PMU-related activities. It will contract firms and \nNGOs for PMU-related activities and for activities to be carried out by the WSST. The WSST will \nprocure equipment and materials for their respective activities and will assist WUSCs to contract \nall NGOs and firms required for supporting their activities. WUSCs will procure all materials and \ncivil works for constructing the water and sanitation schemes.  \n \n48. \nAt the start of the Project, the WSSTs will help the DDC formulate a budget for all project \nactivities, with estimates for each year of implementation. The budgets will be reviewed by the \nPMU  and  ADB  and  updated  annually.  Expenditures  will  be  recorded  at  source  by  the \nimplementing  WSST  and  the  PMU.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  compiling  project \nexpenditures  and  the  reports  of  expenditures  submitted  by  WSSTs.  It  will  report  project \nexpenditures  monthly  to  MPPW  and  MOF,  with  copies  to  ADB,  with  quarterly  and  annual \nsummaries.  \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n49. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years.  The  institutional  component  will  start  in \nthe  first  quarter  of  2004.  Development  and  consolidation  of  manuals  and  technical  guidelines \nwill be completed by the end of the first year. The rural component will have five batches (1 pilot \nbatch  and  4  batches).  Each  batch  will  have  three  phases  and  an  implementation  period  of  3 \nyears. The pilot batch will have four districts with additional districts in the succeeding batches. \nDuring  phase  1,  the  DDCs  will  prepare,  in  consultation  with  the  VDCs  and  communities,  their \nannual district plans for RWSS. In phase 2, they will begin mobilizing and training communities \nand form WUGs and register WUSCs. Community contribution will be collected during phase 2. \nDuring  phase  3,  DDCs  will  support  and  monitor  the  construction  of  water  and  sanitation \nschemes by WUGs. Each phase is expected to last from 6 months to a year. The 21 DDCs will \nbe  clustered  into  5  groups  as  agreed  with  the  Government.    The  project  implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 7. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n50. \nGoods and services financed by the ADB loan will be procured in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines for Procurement and the Government\u2019s procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. \nAs  contracts  are  expected  to  be  small,  international  contractors  are  not  likely  to  be  interested \nand therefore international competitive bidding will not be required.  All equipment and materials \nas  well  as  service  motorcycles  will  be  procured  through  international  shopping.  Certain  items \nmay  be  procured  under  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Some \nequipment  and  vehicles  packaged  at  a  contract  value  of  less  than  $50,000  will  be  procured \nunder  direct  purchase  procedures.  Civil  works  contracts  of  the  rural  component  will  be  small \nwith  average  value  in  the  range  of  $10,000  to  $15,000  equivalent  and  will  follow  ADB's \n\n\f13 \n\ncommunity participation in procurement in the guidelines. The proposed procurement packages \nare in Appendix 8. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nto \n\nConsulting  services  of  1,217  person-months  are  required \n\nfacilitate  project \n51. \nimplementation  and  to  strengthen  the  institutional,  administrative,  and  financial  capacities  of \nMPPW  and  DDCs.  One  consulting  firm  will  provide  consulting  services  for  the  PMU.  \nInternational  consultants  will  be  involved  in  project  management,  capacity-building,  and \nmonitoring  activities.  The  international  and  domestic  consultants  in  the  PMU  will  advise \nDWSS/MPPW  on  best  international  practices  in  designing  strategies  to  implement  the \ninstitutional  strengthening  component  and  the  gender,  caste,  and  ethnic  and  related  social \nprograms.  \n \n52. \nFor the rural component, there will be 10 consulting contracts, 2 contracts per batch of \ndistricts.24 The PMU will contract suitable private sector organizations and/or NGOs to assist the \nDDCs in project management and implementation of social programs. The consultants (which \ncan include NGOs/private sector organizations) to be financed under the loan will be recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants,  using  a  quality-and  cost-based \nselection  method  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. Summary terms of reference for all consulting services are in Appendix 9. \n \n53. \nThe  DDC  will  engage  NGOs  to  facilitate  community  mobilization  and  carry  out  the \nhealth, hygiene, and sanitation campaigns. The WUSC will engage NGOs to help implement the \nwater and sanitation schemes. The NGOs will be selected following criteria developed under the \nProject.25  \n\n5. \n\n  Disbursement Arrangements \n\n54. \nTo facilitate the timely release of loan proceeds and counterpart funds and to expedite \nimplementation, the Government will, as a condition for loan effectiveness, open a WSS sec tor \naccount  at  the  Nepal  Rastra  Bank.  Project  funding  (other  than  local  counterpart  funds) \ncomprising (i) counterpart funds provided by the central Government, and (ii) ADB funding will \nbe pooled at the sector account and then channeled to pay all costs of the Project (other than \ncosts  funded  by  the  local  counterpart  funds)  via  the  following  routes:  (a)  to  the  district \ndevelopment funds (DDF) and then into each DDC\u2019s project operating account, and (b) into the \nPMU project operating account. From each DDC\u2019s project operating account, the funds will be \nused  to  pay  incremental  WSST  salaries  and  wages  and  to  give  the  WUSCs  funds  to  pay  the \ncosts  of  the  schemes.  The  funds  that  are  paid  to  the  PMU  operating  account  will  fund  the \noperations  of  the  PMU.  The  PMU  will  prepare  disbursement  projections,  request  budgetary \nallocations  for  the  central  counterpart  funds,  collect  supporting  documents,  and  prepare \nwithdrawal  applications  and  send  them  to  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement \nHandbook.  Central  counterpart  funds  via  this  channeling  arrangement  will  be  allocated  to  the \nProject annually by the Government through \u201cRed Book\u201d allocations. ADB funding of the Project \nwill  periodically  be  disbursed  from  the  ADB  loan  account  into  a  subaccount  of  the  sector \naccount.  The  subaccount  will  be  dedicated  to  operate  de  facto  as  an  imprest  account  for  the \nADB funding of the Project. The imprest account will be replenished as often as needed, subject \nto  the  following  conditions:  (i)  the  ADB  loan  is  drawn  in  six  payment  milestone amounts, and \n\n                                                 \n24 One package will include the regional social development specialist and M&E specialist for each batch of districts \n\n,and one package will include a financial accountant for each. \n\n25  The selection criteria for prequalifying NGOs are in Supplementary Appendix H. \n\n\f14 \n\ndisbursement of each amount will depend on satisfying the relevant project milestone conditions \n(Appendix 10); (ii) at no point may the balance of the account exceed the lesser of $2.4 million \nor 6 months estimated expenditure. ADB will  monitor the achievement of project milestones via \nthe monitoring and progress reports submitted by the PMU and recommendations of the sector \nstakeholder group and the MPPW Monitoring and Evaluation Unit. ADB will only then approve \nthe replenishment of the sector account.  \n \n55. \nTo facilitate implementation the rural component and in keeping with the Government\u2019s \npolicy  on  decentralization  and  the  National  Water  Supply  Sector  Policy,  a  project  operating \naccount will be established in each DDC for the  rural component immediately after its selection \nto  participate  in  the  Project.  Irrespective  of  funding  sources  for  the  sector  account, \ndisbursements to each DDC will be made on the understanding that each disbursement may be \nexpended  in  the  following  mix  of  uses:  civil  works,  65%;  community  building,  8%;  gender, \ncastes,  and  ethnic  minority  program,  12%;  health  and  hygiene  program,  4%;  and  project \nmanagement,  11%.  The  project  operating  account  will  be  established  only  after  the  Project-\nfinanced financial accountant and procurement specialist are fielded and the DDC accountant is \nappointed. The initial ceiling for each DDC project operating account will be set in accordance \nwith the approved annual district plan and will not exceed $100,000 equivalent.  \n \n56. \nFor  the  rural  component,  when  the  WUG  contributions  have  been  satisfied,  each  DDC \nwill  deposit  construction  funds  for  subprojects  into  each  of  the  relevant  WUSCs  project \noperating account as a grant. Before disbursing the DDC funds of to any WUSC, the WUSC will \nmake the following contribution and commitments: (i) a cash contribution of at least 1% of the \nestimated construction cost of the scheme into the WUSC project operating account; (ii) 1 year\u2019s \nestimate  of  the  O&M  cost  into  the  community\u2019s  O&M  account;  (iii)  a  commitment  to  further \ncontribute the balance (beyond any cash contribution) of the 20% of the cost of the scheme in \nkind.  \n \nThe  PMU  will  ensure  that  all  project  operating  accounts  are  established,  and  will \n57. \nmanage,  replenish,  and \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  and  with  detailed  arrangements  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and \nADB. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure will be used to liquidate advances from \nthe  subsector  Account.  The  SOE  ceiling  per  disbursement  transaction  is  set  at  $5,000 \nequivalent. \n\nliquidate  account  balances \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe  Government  will  submit \n\n 58. \nto  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation  following  ADB\u2019s  standard  procedures.  The  PMU  will  obtain  and  consolidate \nrelevant data from WSSTs. The WSSTs will prepare the project operating accounts and related \nfinancial  statements,  and  records  of  the  SOEs.  The  PMU  will  particularly  address  progress  in \nmeeting  the  performance  targets  defined  under  the  sector  loan  modality.  These  progress \nreports will be the basis for directing further funding to the DDCs.  \n \n59.  MPPW/PMU  and  the  WSSTs  will  maintain  accounts  and  records  so  that  income  and \nexpenditures  related  to  the  Project  are  easily  identified.  They  will  be  assisted  by  an  adequate \nnumber of suitably qualified accounting staff, including a senior financial manager. Additionally, \na financial accountant will assist the PMU and WSSTs to establish the project accounting and \nrecording  systems,  and  to  train  staff  to  maintain  them.  The  accounts  and  statements  of \nexpenditures  and  revenues  related  to  the  Project  will  be  audited  annually  by  an  independent \n\n\f15 \n\nauditor acceptable to ADB.26 WUSC accounts will be audited annually by the WSST/DDC and \nthe DDC  project  operating  account  will  be  audited  by  the  PMU  as  set  forth  in  the  project  and \nsubproject  agreements.    Audited  financial  statements  and  project  accounts,  together  with  the \nreport  of  the  auditor,  will  be  submitted  within  9  months  of  the  close  of  the  financial year. The \nannual audit will include the audit of the sector account and the operating accounts at DDC and \nPMU, and SOE procedure. A separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account and SOE \nprocedure  should  be  included  in  the  annual  audit  report.  The  PMU  will  also  submit  to  ADB, \nwithin 3 months of the physical completion of the Project, a project completion report following \nstandard  ADB  procedures.  MPPW  and  the  DDCs  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \ndelayed  submission,  and  the  requirement  for  satisfactory  audited  accounts  of  acceptable \nquality.  \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n60. \nTo  ensure  that  subprojects  are  managed  efficiently  and  that  project  benefits  are \nmaximized  and  reach  target  groups,  a  M&E  program  is  included  in  the  framework  of  ADB\u2019s \nproject  performance  management  system  (PPMS).  PPMS  activities  will  be  conducted \nperiodically  to  gather  information  from  multiple  sources  to  determine  whether  inputs  have \nrendered  expected  benefits  to  the  target  population.  The  PPMS  will  also  seek  to  detect  any \ndeficiencies  and  discrepancies  between  the  plan  and  execution  of  the  Project  so  that  timely \ncorrections  can  be  made  to  improve  resource  efficiency,  benefits,  outcomes,  and  impacts. \nIndicators to be monitored have been formulated and agreed upon with the Executing Agency. \nSelected  indicators  pertain  to  physical  progress,  project  impact  with  disaggregated  data  to \ndemonstrate  benefits  to  the  poor  and  targets  of  the  gender,  caste  and  ethnicity  program, \ncapacity-building  activities,  and  institutional  reform  activities.27  The  PMU  will  gather  baseline \nphysical  and  socioeconomic  data  in  each  of  the  21  DDCs,  submit  a  detailed  implementation \nplan  for  monitoring  performance,  and  prepare  benchmark  information  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and \nconcurrence  3  months  after  work  begins  in  a  particular  DDC.  Thereafter,  the  PMU  will  submit \nannual M&E reports to ADB throughout project implementation.  \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n61. \nBecause  of  the  number  of  districts  and  components  to  be  covered  by  the  Project, the \nregular joint reviews at least twice a year by ADB and the Government will be supplemented by \na  comprehensive  midterm  review.  The  routine  project  reviews  will  cover  the  DDCs  financial \nperformance  and  staffing;  implementation  of  the  gender,  caste,  and  ethnic minority programs; \nphysical  progress  in  project  implementation;  and  capacity-building  activities.  The  midterm \nreview  will  allow  the  Government  and  ADB  to  monitor  the  Project  closely  and  to  make \nappropriate  adjustments  in  the  design  and  implementation  arrangements,  if  necessary.  The \nmidterm  review  will  (i)  review  the  scope,  design,  and  implementation  arrangements  of  the \nProject;  (ii)  identify  changes  needed  since  project  appraisal;  (iii)  assess  implementation \nperformance  against  project  indicators;  (iv)  review  and  establish  compliance  with  loan \ncovenants; and (v) identify problems and constraints and, if necessary, recommend changes in \nthe design or the implementation arrangements.  \n \n\n                                                 \n26 ADB acknowledges that the auditor general of the Kingdom of Nepal is acceptable to it as an independent auditor \n\nfor the project. \n\n27  Details of these indicators are in Supplementary Appendix I. \n\n\f16 \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n Investments in RWSS will generate significant benefits for approximately 850,000 direct \n62. \nbeneficiaries at the community level, for local authorities units (at district and village levels), and \nfor central Government oversight and coordination in accordance with redefined roles for central \nGovernment departments and agencies. Benefits will include (i) poverty reduction in historically \nunderdeveloped areas; (ii) improved conditions for gender, castes and socially excluded groups; \n(iii) improved community health and environmental condition; (iv) improved sector management; \nand  (v) increased sector capacity.   \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Reduction in Historically Underdeveloped Areas \n\n63. \nNepal is a very poor country, currently ranked 143rd out of 175 countries on the UNDP \nhuman  development  index.  Socioeconomic  surveys28  reveal  that  household  income  for  more \nthan 85% of households in the 21 target districts is below $48 per month. The Project focuses \non poorer and more remote areas of western and northern Nepal, where RWSS and other rural \ninfrastructure services have long been lacking. Good quality and reliable RWSS will help reduce \npoverty in poor rural communities in many ways. Additional income for project beneficiaries will \naccrue from (i) utilizing the saved time of women and girls for income-generating activities; (ii) \nimproved  family  health  and  reduction  in  health-related  expenditures;  (iii)  reducing  missed \nworkdays  due  to  diarrheal  disease  in  wage  earners;  and  (iv)  over  the  long  run,  reducing  the \nmissed school days for boys and girls. Households that currently use unacceptably low-quality \nwater  for  drinking  that  leaves  from  polluted  rivers  or  ponds  will  no  longer  spend  so  much  on \nremedies  for  diarrhea  and  other  waterborne  diseases.  Improved  community  health  is  also \nreflected  in  lower  welfare  costs  and  more  resources  available  for  community  programs.  The \nsummary poverty reduction and social analysis are in Appendix 11. \n\n2. \n\nGender, Castes and Excluded Ethnic Groups \n\n64. \nThe  main  project  beneficiaries  will  be  women  and  girls  who  now  spend  4-5 hours per \nday fetching water, which is often of poor quality, from distant sources. The availability of water \nin or near their homes will save time and improve their (and their families') quality of life due to \nimproved hygienic conditions. Women will be relieved from the stress and discomfort of hauling \nwater,  especially  during  illness  and  extreme  weather.  They  will  be  able  to  spend  time  and \nenergy on more productive social and economic activities including better child and house care \nand farm production activities such as tending livestock and poultry. By working with the ADB-\nfinanced  Empowerment  of  Women  Project  (where  project  implementation  overlaps)  and  its \nmicrocredit  promotion  activities  will  also  enable  communities,  particularly  women,  to  pursue \nincome-generating activities. Girls, who share the responsibility for water collection, could then \nbe enrolled in schools. Men and boys will also benefit, but not to the same extent as women and \ngirls. \n \n65. \nSocially  excluded  castes  and  ethnic  groups  will  be  specifically  targeted  to  receive \nbenefits,  rectifying  historically  inequitable  access  to  many  social  services,  including  RWSS. \nMembers of lower caste and excluded ethnic groups will be actively encouraged to participate in \nproject training activities and RWSS management, thereby providing them with opportunities for \neducation and facilities management that have historically been denied them.   \n\n                                                 \n28 Socio-economic survey carried out by Nepal Water for Health under TA3844-NEP: Community Water Supply and \n\nSanitation Project. \n\n\f17 \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental and Health Improvement \n\n66. \nDiarrheal and other waterborne diseases are endemic in Nepal. Infant mortality rates are \nunacceptably high. Typhoid is disturbingly common. All these indicators are generally worse in \nthe remote or poorer areas targeted by this Project.  Health benefits from improved water supply \nwill  be  significant.    Sanitation  improvement  will  add  significantly  to  health  by  helping  isolate \ndisease pathogens from the household and community environment. Studies have shown that \nregular use of improved sanitation facilities, coupled with hygiene and behavioral change, has a \nconsiderably greater health impact than just the provision of clean water. The project focus on \nhygiene  and  sanitation  behavioral  change,  such  as  regularly  using  improved  latrines,  washing \nface  and  hands  with  soap  (or  suitable  substitutes)  at  appropriate  times  will  help  ensure  that \nthese benefits are realized.  \n\n4. \n\nInstitutional and Policy Impacts \n\nin  accordance  with \n\nimplement,  and  monitor  RWSS  projects \n\n67. \nThe  RWSS  Sector  Strategy  supports  the  improvement  of  RWSS  facilities  and  service \ndelivery  by  establishing  a  commonly  agreed-upon  implementation  approach.  The  consensus- \nbuilding process confirmed that a community-based approach placing responsibility for RWSS \nimplementation  in  the  hands  of  communities  with  support  from  district  and  village  government \nand NGOs should be adopted.  This Project builds on the experience of other donors, adopting \nand supporting successful institutional arrangements and strengthening institutional capacity to \nthe  Government's \nplan, \ndecentralization process and the community-based approach.   \n \n68. \nThe  Government\u2019s  long-term  governance  strategy  is  based  on  decentralizing  central \nGovernment roles, including responsibilities and authority for many services such as RWSS, to \nlocal  authorities.  The  LSGA  establishes the legal framework for decentralization. Districts and \nvillages will develop the capacity to take on the new decentralized responsibilities. Capacity will \nbe  improved  so  that  districts  will  be  able  to  plan  and  manage  sector  activities,  and  support \neducation  and  training  for  community-based  projects.    Participating  communities,  with  NGO \nsupport,  will  be  able  to  build  their  own  RWSS  facilities  and  establish  the  capacity  to  operate, \nmaintain, and repair the systems.   \n \nThe Project will also support institutional reform and capacity building within DWSS, the \n69. \nlead central Government agency in the sector.  DWSS will improve its capacity to support the \nsector  through  coordination,  technical  support,  training,  and  other  sector  facilitation  activities \nwhile  at  the  same  time  relinquishing  direct  implementation  responsibility  for  the  RWSS  sector. \nEstablishing a rational staffing pattern will be a component of the reform process.   \n \n\n5. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses \n\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects  was applied to five subprojects \n70. \nin  the  rural  areas,  covering  five  districts  and  with  the  application  of  every  possible  technical \nsolution  envisaged  to  be  financed  under  the  Project.  The  average  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn  (EIRR)  for  the  five  schemes  is  estimated  at  68%;  for  the  individual  schemes,  the  EIRR \nranged  from  24%  to  94%.  The  estimated  EIRR  for  the  Project  as  a  whole  is  about  14%.  The \nfigure is conservative, as it does not include benefits derived from sanitation improvements and \nhealth  benefits.  Because  the  analysis  is  based  on  a  five  subproject  sample,  it  is  not \nrepresentative of the substantial macro benefits arising from the intervention. These benefits are \ndiscussed fully in Appendix 12.   \n\n\f18 \n\nB. \n\nRisks \n\nIt \n\nthe \n\nthat \n\n Policy. \n\nis  assumed \n\nInstitutional  Capacity. \n\ninstitutional  reforms  related \n\n71. \nto \nimplementing \ndecentralization  will  continue.    Institutional  reforms  in  the  RWSS  sector  are  required  to  reflect \nthe  decentralization  process  and  changing  institutional  roles.  The  institutional  strengthening \ncomponent  is  designed  to  support  this  momentum  by  strengthening  the  capacity  of \nDWSS/MPPW to function as a sector facilitator and implement the RWSS Sector Strategy and \nAction Plan in coordination with other external agencies. \n \n72. \nThe  risk  is  that  the  to-be-approved  sector  strategy  is  not  acted  on  by  Government \nagencies and other donors, and that the harmonization process does not continue. Another risk \nis that NGOs do not see their experiences incorporated into Government-supported projects. \n \n73. \nInsufficient  institutional  capacity,  particularly  at  the  local \nauthorities  level,  poses  a  risk  to  the  implementation  of  the  rural  component.  Weak  local  NGO \ncapacity and capability in remote and poorer districts could make it difficult to mobilize qualified \nNGOs there. The Project will train and support the DDCs to build their capacity and the capacity \nof  district-based  NGOs.  In  addition,  the  Government  will  provide  the  necessary  budgetary \nallocations  for  the  DDCs  to  have  at  least  one  water  supply  engineer,  two  overseers,  one \ncommunity  development  officer,  and  one  accountant  as  counterpart  to  be  trained  and  to  work \nfull-time on the Project. \n \n74. \nLocal  Administration.  The  Project  assumes  a  stable  political  and  economic \nenvironment at the local level.  The lack of locally elected officials at the DDC and VDC levels \nweakens  the  participatory  decentralized  approach  and  may  reduce  community  trust.    District \nand village authorities are currently being managed by civil servants.  Dedicated civil servants \n(in  a  lot  of  cases  informally  supported  by  former  elected  officials)  working  at  the  district  level \n(principally,  local  development  officers)  do  make  efforts  to  be  responsive  to  community  needs \nwithin the constraints imposed by the current district administration system. However, the pace \nof project implementation may be affected.   \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n75. \nassurances which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nBefore each fiscal year, the Government, in consultation with relevant DDCs and \nthe  PMU,  will  prepare  and  agree  on  adequate  annual  budget  for  central \ncounterpart funds for the fiscal year. \nBy  16  or  17  July  of  each  year,  the  Government  will  allocate  central  counterpart \nfunds in the amount budgeted in accordance with paragraph (i) in respect of the \nsubsequent  fiscal  year;  and  the  Government  will  ensure  DDC  contributions  and \nVDC contributions are paid to the relevant accounts. \nThe Government will ensure that all nonoperating and operating project accounts \nat central and DDC level do not get frozen for the duration of the Project. \nThe  Government  will  ensure,  and  will  cause  MPPW  and  DDC  to  ensure,  that \neach  of  the  following  implementation  units  is  established  and  staffed  to  the \nsatisfaction of ADB and maintained during the term of the Project: \n\n\f19 \n\n(v) \n\n(vi)  \n\n(ix)  \n\n(x)  \n\n(xi)  \n\n \nthe PMU, by loan effectiveness; \n(a) \neach WSST, not later than 1 month after selection of the relevant DDC;  \n(b) \nNPSC, not later than 1 month after loan effectiveness; and \n(c)  \n(d)  \nDWCC not later than 1 month after selection of the relevant DDC. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  sector  stakeholder  group  meets  at  least \ntwice a year. \nThe Government will ensure that the Project develops an environmental checklist \nat planning stage

environment  policy  and  guidelines  on  environmental \nassessment procedures and involuntary resettlement policy. \n\n(vii)   The Government will support the establishment and registration of WUGs in each \nproject  community,  pursuant  to  the  relevant  bylaws  permitting  such  groups  to \ntake  legal  ownership  of,  and  plan,  design,  construct,  and  operate  the  relevant \ncommunity water scheme. \n\n(viii)   The Government will review and approve manuals and guidelines developed by \n\nthe Project for the sector. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that,  in  selecting  the  project  target  communities, \nDDCs use the community selection criteria set out in Appendix 4. \nThe Government shall inform ADB promptly of any change of the director of the \nPMU or WSST team leader. \nThe Government will ensure that funding made available by ADB to fund DDCs \nwill  be  allocated  and  expended  by  each  DDC  as  follows:    civil  works,  no  more \nthan 65%; community building, less than 8%; gender, caste, and ethnic minorities \nprogram, no less than 12%; health and hygiene program, no less than 4%; and \nproject management, no less than 11%. \n\n(xii)   The  Government  agrees  that  no  disbursement  will  be  made  from  the  loan \naccount for any subproject or scheme that is in breach of the criteria pertaining to \ndemand-driven,  community-based  RWSS  subproject  selection  namely:  poverty, \nremote location, and unserved or underserved in terms of RWSS coverage. \n(xiii)   The Government will ensure that targets set out in the gender, caste and ethnic \n\nminorities plans  (Appendix 5) are met by WUG, DDCs and the PMU. \n\n(xv) \n\n(xiv)   The  Government  will  ensure  that  before  starting  project  activities  in  any \ncommunity, and as a condition for funding by ADB of the relevant district\u2019s project \nactivities, MPPW and the relevant DDC will enter into a project agreement, to be \nprepared by ADB, regulating the following matters: \n(a) \n(b) \n\ncontribution of local counterpart funding; \nterms and conditions of release of funding from DDC to WUGs (including \nconditions relating to provision of DDC contribution); \nestablishment and staffing of WSST; and \nauditing and reporting mechanism to PMU. \n\n(c) \n(d) \nThe Government will ensure that, for works to be carried out in any community, \nthe relevant DDC, the relevant VDC, and the WUG enter into a contract, \nacceptable in form and substance to ADB, regulating the following matters: \nprovision of the VDC contribution and the WUG contribution;  \n(a) \nestablishment of minimum specifications and standards for construction \n(b) \nworks to be performed by the WUG; \nstablishment of minimum specifications and standards for the operation \nworks to be performed by the WUG; \nestablishment of environmental standards applicable to design, \nconstruction, and O&M of works;  \n\n(d) \n\n(c) \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n(g) \n\ncooperation and coordination by WUG with relevant agencies of \nGovernment, including the PMU; \nproject Implementation; and \nprocurement requirements. \n\n(xvi)  The  government  shall  ensure  that  by  end  of  Project  implementation  period,  its \nCabinet  review  its  existing  policy  under  which,  depending  in  size  of  end-user \npopulation settlements, different government line agencies implement rural water \nsupply and sanitation projects. \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness  \n\n76. \n\nThe following are conditions for loan effectiveness:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe Government establishes and fully staffs the PMU, to the satisfaction of ADB, \nand maintains it during the term of the Project.  \nThe Cabinet approves the RWSS sector strategy and its associated action plan. \nThe  Government  shall  have  confirmed  that  the  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Unit \nunder MPPW is operational. \nThe Government opens the sector account at the Nepal Rastra Bank. \n\nC. \n\nCondition for Initial Disbursement  \n\nthe \nFor the initial disbursement of ADB project funding,  the  Government  approves \n77. \nbudget for project funding from central Government sources  (central counterpart funds) for the \nfirst fiscal year and makes a budgetary allocation for the amount. \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n78. \nADB  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1

\nThe  national  framework  for  decentralized  governance  has  been  established  under  the \nLocal  Self-Governance  Act  (1999)  and  is  now  being  implemented.  Historical  sector  roles  and \nresponsibilities  are  changing,  with  local  governments  taking  on  additional  responsibilities.  The \nchange  has  required  the  creation  of  transitional  structures  to  manage  some  devolved \nresponsibilities  on  an  interim  basis  until  the  decentralization  process  is  complete.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  decentralization  implementation  plan  (DIP)  outlines  the  plan  and  schedule  for \nachieving  the  decentralization  goals.  The  following  table  outlines  the  current  functions  of \nnational and district agencies. \n\nWSS-Related Functions on Different Tiers of Government \n\nFunction \n\nCurrent Capacity \n\nComment \n\nHas lead role in WSS sector policy \ndevelopment.

Once local government elections are held, DDCs \nwill be able to take more direct responsibility for planning and providing services based on local \npriorities. The Decentralization Implementation and Monitoring Committee in its third meeting in \nJanuary  2002  approved  the  DIP  and  has  agreed  to  a  time  frame  of  5  years  for establishing \nsector sections (including water supply and sanitation [WSS]) in all DDCs.  \n\n3. \nThe  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Fund  Development  Board  (the  Fund  Board),  a \nformal agency of government, is constituted as an autonomous entity under the supervision of \nthe  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works  (MPPW).    Since  its  establishment  in  1996,  the \nFund  Board  has  developed  a  demand-led  community-based  implementation  modality  that  has \nfocused on direct intervention at  the  community  level  by  nongovernment  organizations  (NGO) \nsupport organizations.  This program has created a cadre of NGOs with experience in working \nto support the sector.  Along with those of several national NGOs, this program, has provided \nvaluable  lessons to the rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) sector. The implementation \napproach for the ADB investment is modeled on these modalities.   \n\nB. \n\nNGO and Private Sector Capacity \n\nMore  than  80  national  and  district-based  NGOs  have  successfully  implemented  WSS \n4. \nprojects  financed  by  aid  agencies.  Because  NGOs  focus  at  the  community  level,  they  have \nbeen  more  effective  in  supporting  social  mobilization  and  other  community  capacity  building \nneeds. NGOs with the proper training have proved to be good partners in assisting communities \ndevelop and implement schemes.  More NGOs are now being established at the district level. \nHowever, more remote and poorer districts are less likely to have active and capable NGOs. In \nsuch  cases  strong  orientation  programs  will  be  necessary  to  attract  capable  NGOs  and \nstrengthen  district-based  NGO  capacity.  The  Fund  Board  has  been  supporting  such  NGO \norientation and has trained a large number of NGOs. \n\n5. \nPrivate  sector  organizations  (PSOs)  are  supporting  the  RWSS  sector  by  providing \ntechnical support for design, construction, and operation and maintenance, training, monitoring \nand  evaluation,  technical  auditing,  and  special  studies.  Such  capacity  is  largely  restricted  to \nurban areas and is very limited in the remoter districts.  The specific skills of PSOs have been \nutlilized  to  advantage  even  in  rural  and  remote  areas  through  contracts  for  specific  services \noutlined above.  \n\nC. \n\nPlanning and Flow of Funds  \n\nUnder \n\nthe  participatory  development  planning  process, \n\n6. \nthe  National  Planning \nCommission (NPC) and sectoral ministries send to the districts information and directives, along \nwith  budget  ceilings,  for  each  year\u2019s  development  plan.  Planning  is  a  14-step  process, \nculminating  in    approval  of  the  district  council  plan.  The  DDC  forwards  the  annual  district \ndevelopment  plan  to  NPC  through  the  Ministry  of  Local  Development  (MLD).    DDCs  also \nforward sectoral program plans to sectoral ministries. In the past, DDC plans and budgets have \nbeen  subject  to  modification  at  central  levels.  Efforts  are  now  being  made  to  restrict  such \nmodifications.  DDC  and  sectoral  ministry  plans  are  approved  at  the  national  level  with  budget \ndetails published in the \u201cRed Book.\u201d  The process starts in mid-November and ends in March. \nThe fiscal year starts in mid-July with release of funds in the following weeks or months.  At the \nend of the fiscal year, all Government accounts are frozen and with unspent funds returned to \nthe Ministry of Finance.  \n\n7. \nThe  Government  recently  mandated  that  district-level  program  budgets  flow  directly  to \nDDCs  for  FY2002/03.  This  changes  the  past  practice  that  channeled  funds  for  sectoral \nprograms through sectoral ministries . This system was introduced even though departments of \nsectoral  ministries  may  still  implement  district-level  programs.    Bloc  grants  to  support  DDC \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nactivities  (staff  salaries,  operating  expanses,  and  limited  program  budgets)  continue  to  flow \ndirectly to the DDC as before. \n\nD. \n\nRWSS Implementation Capability  \n\nNational  policy  has,  to  date,  been  developed  through  an  informal  consultative  process. \n8. \nGovernment implementation of national RWSS programs has been the responsibility of DWSS \nand  Department  of  Local  Infrastructure  Development  and  Agricultural  Roads  (DOLIDAR) \nthrough  district-level  departments.    DDCs  and  village  development  committees  (VDCs)  have \nbeen responsible for DDC-initiated programs at the district and village levels.   The Fund Board \nmanages  its  programs  though  its  centrally  located  office.  NGOs  working  within  the  sector  are \nlegally  bound  to  the  national  sector  policy,  but  there  is  no  mechanism  to  ensure  that  they \nfunction entirely within the national framework.   \n\nThe  LSGA  now  gives  overall  sectoral  responsibility  for  supporting  RWSS  service \n9. \nplanning  and  provision  to  DDCs.  However,  DDC  capacity  is  severely  constrained  by  central \nbudget allocations and staffing. Historically line ministries, such as MPPW, provided capacity in \nrelevant sectors at the district level (DWSS, a department within MPPW, maintains offices in all \ndistricts).  Most RWSS capacity at the district level resides with DWSS offices. In 2002 formal \nresponsibility  for  smaller  systems  (serving  less  than  1,000  people)  was  given  to  DOLIDAR,  a \ndepartment  of  MLD,  which  has  closer  institutional  links  to  the  DDC.  The  establishment  of \nDOLIDAR offices at the district level (DIDO) was followed in late 2002 by the creation of district \ntechnical offices (DTOs) within DDCs but staffed by seconded DOLIDAR personnel.   Approved \nstaffing  for  DTOs  is  limited  with  the  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  and  Building  Section  having \none  engineer,  two  overseers,  and  two  water  supply  technicians  in  42  larger districts, and only \none overseer and two water supply technicians in the remaining 33 districts. Many posts within \nDTOs remain vacant.  \n\n10. \nDDCs have five kinds of staff working in the office: (i) Government staff including LDO, \nchief  accountant,  planning  and  administration  officer,  and  DTO  staff  from  MLD  and  its \ndepartments; (ii) administrative staff recruited by the DDC from grants given by the government; \n(iii)  administrative  staff  and  technicians  paid  for  from  a  contingency  fund  used  to  cover  the \nadministration  cost  of  bloc  grant  management;  (iv)  staff  recruited  by  the  DDC  from  its  own \nrevenue; and (v) staff assigned to it to manage special programs in the district, such as Remote \nArea Development Program.  All DDC staff except Government are considered temporary and \nGovernment  staff  are  subject  to  transfer  at  any  time.  The  LSGA  provides  for  a  Local \n(Government) Service Act which outlines terms of employment (recruitment, promotion, transfer, \npensions,  etc.)  and  allows  DDCs  to  establish  staffing  patterns  and  hire  permanent  staff.    This \nAct is being prepared.  \n\n11. \nThe  LSGA  provides  for  sectoral  sections  within  DDCs  including  a  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation Section.  When established, these sections will plan and manage investments in the \nsector but will not directly implement projects. Government policy supports provision of RWSS \nservices  through  a  community-based  approach.  Under  this  approach,  communities  (through \nlegally  constituted  water  user  and  sanitation  committees)  implement  RWSS  projects  with  the \nassistance  of  support  organizations.    NGO  capacity  is  well  established  in  some  districts,  but \nmay not yet be adequate to support the program in rural and remote districts.  The investment \nprogram will orient and train NGOs to build this capacity in participating districts. \n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening \n\nThe  institutional  strengthening  component  is  designed  to  support  the  Government\u2019s \n12. \ndecentralization  process  and  build  capacity  at  local  levels  to  manage  and  implement  RWSS \nprojects. This component will focus on three major areas: (i) DDC training and capacity building, \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n(ii)  strengthening  DWSS  capacity  to  provide  technical  support,  and  (iii)  strengthening  sector \ncoordination and policy development.   \n\n1. \n\nLocal Government Training and Capacity Building \n\nDDC  and  VDC  capacity  in  the  RWSS  sector  is  weak.    Under  the  LSGA,  these  local \n13. \nbodies  now  have  formal  responsibility  for  managing  and  implementing RWSS projects at the \ndistrict  and  village  levels.    Existing  technical  capacity  at  the  district  level  currently  lies  within \nDWSS regional and subregional offices, which are linked to a line ministry department. Limited \ntechnical capacity is available to the DDC through the DDC\u2019s DTO office, staffed by seconded \nDOLIDAR staff. The Project will work toward building local government capacity independent of \nthe  line  ministries  as  outlined  in  the  LSGA.  This  will  be  accomplished  by  (i)  deputing  the \nrequired  capacity  to  manage  the  Project  at  the  district  level  to  the  DDC,  thereby  giving  them \nexperience in planning and managing sectoral work; (ii) training DDC and VDC officials and staff \nin sector policy and strategy, project planning and management, and the social, technical, and \nfinancial  aspects  of  project  implementation  modalities;  (iii)  providing  funding  for  training  and \nsubprojects directly to the districts through the District Development Fund; and (iv) working with \nDDCs  to  formally  establish  and  staff  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  sections  once  local \ngovernment elections are held. Training and capacity building will be enhanced by giving DDCs \nthe responsibility, authority, and funding for RWSS interventions. PMU consultants and staff will \nprovide training and technical assistance.   \n\n2. \n\nStrengthen DWSS Capacity to Provide Technical Support \n\n14. \nDWSS  has  been  the  principal  Government  agency  with  RWSS  sector  responsibility.   \nHowever,  the  LSGA  and  national  policy  mandate  that  DWSS  relinquish  its  historical \nimplementation  role  and  take  on  a  sectoral  support  and  facilitation  role.  The  RWSS  sector \nstrategy outlines 12 specific technical support and facilitation roles that fall to DWSS within this \nnew institutional framework.  The Project has been designed to support and strengthen DWSS\u2019 \nrole as sector facilitator by (i) designing the PMU to be a central planning and management unit \nfor  the  sector  so  that  it  fulfils  a  technical  support  and  facilitative  role  during  project \nimplementation;  (ii)  assisting  DWSS  establish  specific  capability  areas  that  DWSS  will  have \nresponsibility  for  (the  RWSS  sector  strategy  outlines  a  list  of  DWSS  sectoral  responsibilities) \nthrough demonstration and training; and (iii) assisting DWSS outline a process for redeploying \nstaff and rightsizing related to its mandated functions while at the same time retaining the staff it \nneeds within the new institutional structure.  \n\n3. \n\nStrengthening Policy Development \n\nSector  stakeholders  have  begun  to  share  information  and  discuss  policy  issues  more \n15. \nopenly  in  the  broader  context  of  sector  development.  The  Government\u2019s  decentralization \nprogram  has  already  revealed  inconsistencies  with  existing  policies  and  certain  weaknesses \nrelated to such issues as rehabilitation of facilities and implementation of schemes.  The Project \nwill  support  continuation  of  the  sector  dialogue  begun  during  project  conceptualization  and \nexpanded  during  project  preparation.  Support  will  be  provided  to  establish  a  formal  sector \nstakeholder  group  to  include  government  and  aid  agencies,  NGOs  and  others  involved  in \nfurthering sector goals and agendas.  \n\n\fEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE WSS SECTOR IN NEPAL 1990-2002 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nProject Name \n \n\nA.

Project  funding  will  be  allocated  to  communities  that \nrank  first  according  to  the  criteria.    The  criteria  are  based  on  hardship  factors,  willingness  to \nshare the costs of rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS), and poverty and social factors.  All \nschemes selected must have already been identified and prioritized in the district development \nplan. Failure to prioritize communities following these criteria will render the DDC noneligible for \nfurther funding. \n\nHardship Factors \n\nA. \n\n2. \n\nFor a community to qualify, it must have one or more of the following hardship factors: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nTime required to fetch water from existing water sources/points, i.e. average time \nto  go,  wait  (if  necessary),  and  return  home  is  more  than  30  minutes  per round \ntrip. \nExisting accessible water sources are available less than 9 months per year. \nExisting water sources are highly contaminated (arsenic or fecal coliform >1,500 \npm)  or  physically  prone  to  contamination  (e.g.,  open  dug  wells,  broken  down \ntubewells, rivers, etc.). \nAverage  per  capita  water  consumption  is  adequate  (at  least  25  liters  per  capita \nper day) or inadequate (less than 15). \n\nB. \n\nWillingness to Share the Costs of RWSS Development \n\n3. \nCommunities  wishing  to  participate  in  the  Project  must  make  cash  and  in-kind \ncontributions.  They  must  also  be  willing  to  take  full  financial  and  managerial  responsibility  for \noperations  and  maintenance.  Communities  can  increase  their  chance  of  being  selected  by \nagreeing  to  pay  a  higher  percentage  of  the  cost:  of  the  scheme  at  least  20%  community \ncontribution, with >1% in cash. For poor communities in remote inaccessible areas the minimum \ncontribution will be reduced to 10%, although per capita cost may be higher. \n\nC. \n\nSocial and Poverty Factors \n\n4. \nWSS  services  also  need  to  be  provided  to  poor,  socially  excluded,  and  otherwise \ndisadvantaged communities with low income, insufficient food supply, low literacy rate, and high \nmorbidity and mortality rates. According to the Nepal Poverty Assessment 1999 indicators poor \nhouseholds are: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nhouseholds having food sufficiency for less than 6 months in a year; \nhouseholds whose major source of income is wage from labor; \nhouseholds with female heads with disabled persons; and \nother households with low literacy, unsatisfactory health indicators, etc. \n\n \n\nThe table gives draft sample of the instrument that DDCs will use to evaluate and rank \n5. \ncommunities  using  the  community  selection  criteria.  The  PMU  in  consultation  with  the  sector \nstakeholder group, will finalize the instrument and will submit it for  ADB's concurrence 6 months \nafter project effectiveness.  \n\nCommunity  selection  criteria  incorporate  both  required  eligibility  elements  and  ranking \n6. \nelements.

During \nthe  evaluation  survey,  women  questioned  the  lack  of  transparency  of  system  costs  and  illegal \nextensions  using  private  pipelines  by  WUSC  chairmen.  The  Community-Based Water Supply \nand  Sanitation  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  Sample  Survey  and  the  subsequent \nSocioeconomic Survey (SES) findings confirmed that, without targeted intervention, women and \npoor  men  are  all  too  often  excluded  from  participating  in  decision  making  related  to  project \nplanning  for  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  (RWSS)  and  resource  allocation  in  Nepal.  The \npoorest groups\u2014Dalits and other socially excluded ethnic groups\u2014often have unequal access \nto water, sanitation, and other project benefits like training and paid jobs. Empowering women \nand socially excluded men to participate in decision making about improved RWSS resources is \ntherefore  a  critical  issue  to  be  addressed  in  this  Project  through  intensive  social  mobilization \nefforts and gender-sensitive processes. \n \nB. \n\nCapacity Building to Promote Women's Involvement in Decision Making \n\n1. \n\nCentral Level \n\n2. \nThe  project  management  unit  (PMU)  located  in  the  Department  of  Water  Supply  and \nSewerage  under  the  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works,  will  include  an  international \ngender/social development specialist who will work with the regional gender/social development \nspecialists  in  the  development  phase  and  first  2  years  of  implementation.  All  will  work closely \nwith  the  health  and  sanitation,  technical  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  specialists  to  ensure \ngender,  caste,  ethnicity,  and  community  mobilization  objectives  are  developed,  planned,  and \nintegrated into project strategies, action plans, and processes.  \n \n\n2. \n\nDistrict Level \n\nThe  PMU  gender/social  development  specialist  will  orient  the  regional  gender  and \n3. \ncommunity development consultants to support the water and sanitation support team (WSST) \ncommunity  development  specialist  and \nthe  district  development  committee\u2019s  women \ndevelopment  officer  and  to  ensure  that  all  WSST  staff  (including  counterpart  staff)  receive \ntraining on gender awareness and gender, caste, and ethinicity policy and process. The regional \ngender and community development consultant will support WSST officers to initiate and carry \nout their gender-sensitive and socially inclusive coordination and monitoring roles effectively. \n \n\n3. \n\nCommunity Level \n\n4. \nBefore  nongovernment  organizations/community-based  organizations  (NGOs/CBOs) \nstart implementing subprojects with communities, two staff members will be required to attend \ntraining  sessions  in  gender  awareness  and  project  policy  and  processes  for  incorporating \ngender, caste, and ethnicity. This will enable NGOs/CBOs to better promote gender awareness \nand  to  facilitate  gender  and  caste-sensitive  processes  in  a  community  in  all  phases  of  a \nsubproject and in other components such as health and sanitation.  \n\n                                                 \n1   Benefit,  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  of  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Subprojects  under  the  Fourth  Rural  Water \n\nSupply and Sanitation Sector Project, Main Report, New Era, Kathmandu, September 2001. \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n33 \n\n \n\n5. \n \n\nC. \n\nTargets for Women's Participation and Access to Subproject Benefits \n\nThe following targets will be achieved in implementing this project: \n\n(i) \n\n50%  women  as  executive  and  general  members  in  WUSCs,  with  proportional \nrepresentation2 of all castes and ethnic groups residing in the community \n(ii)  WUSCs  to  receive  gender,  caste  and  ethnic  participation  awareness  and \n\nconfidence building training as part of initial WUSC training \n\n(iii)  Women as well as men trained as paid village maintenance workers (VMW) and \n\nsanitation masons where possible, \n\n(iv)  Men as well as women trained as community health motivators to promote health \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nand sanitation to men as well as women, boys, and girls \nSchool  water  supply  and  sanitation  construction  to  include  separate  toilet \ncubicles for boys, girls, and teachers. School hygiene and sanitation promotions \nto be extended to out-of-school boys and girls through a child-to-child approach \nPaid unskilled labor to the poorest men and women selected in a community at \n50% of the standard daily labor rate \n\n(vii)  Affordable  sanitation  options  (in  the  Community  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation \nCatalog) available for all socioeconomic groups, and sanitation subsidies to the \n10% poorest households \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Women participating in decision making on the number, location, and position of \nwater points, and design modifications to meet practical needs for washing and \nbathing \nParticipatory  approaches  applied  to  identify  households  by  gender,  caste, \nethnicity, and socioeconomic group \nGender analysis and consultation with women conducted in all subprojects \nSubsidies  to  poor  communities  in  remote  middle  hills  and  mountain  areas  for \nRWSS \n\n(x) \n(xi) \n\n(xii)  Community-based  revolving  funds  for  sanitation  to  offer  loans  for  affordable \nlatrines, with appropriate repayment schedules to enable greater access by poor \nmen and women \n\n \n\nD. \n\nGender Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n6. \nThe above tasks will be monitored using gender, caste, and ethnicity impact monitoring \nindicators,  disaggregated  data  collected  and  analyzed  incorporated  in  progress  reports  by \nNGOs/CBOs, and the project performance management system (WSST/DDCs to PMU).  ADB \nbiannual review missions and the midterm review mission will also evaluate the achievements \nand impacts of the targets. \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n2   Proportional representation means that if there are 30% Dalit households in a community, then the WUSC should \n\nhave 30% Dalit members on the WUSC. \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nCOST ESTIMATESa \n($'000) \n\n \nItem \nA.

Yes \n\nSector identified as a national priority in country poverty \npartnership agreement?  Yes \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Nepal: \n \nThe country poverty analysis describes the provision of basic services for the poor, including water-related needs, as \nbeing fundamental to poverty elimination.  Under the Project, benefits will impact principally on the health and quality \nof  life,  with  full  benefits  being  realized  in  the  longer  term.    The  Project  will  enhance  hous ehold economies in the \npoorest regions of the country.  Anticipated benefits include stronger, more sustainable livelihoods; increased family \nincomes through improved crop production; improved livestock management; improved cottage industries; fewer days \nlost through sickness; reduced medical expenditures; and improved attendance of children, especially girls, at school.  \n \nEconomic analysis for RWSS projects in Nepal indicates that time and energy savings contribute to economic internal \nrates  of  return  of  around  24%  for  gravity  schemes  and  14%  for  tube  wells.1  These  analyses  are  understood  to \nsignificantly understate benefits since they measure only  time savings and ignore significant quality-of-life benefits.  \n \nFetching water is mainly the responsibility of women and girls. Social structures and current levels of education and \nawareness inhibit gender equality.  In the hills, time taken to fetch water, including waiting time at the source, is about \n4.5 hours per household per day. A shorter time to collect  water normally results in increased consumption of water, \nwhich will result in improved hygiene (more frequent personal bathing and washing of clothes and utensils) and better \nlivestock maintenance. Health  benefits  cited  by  beneficiaries  normally  include  improved  quality  of  life  due  to  better \nphysical health, reduced mental stress (as result of less drudgery), and an improved household economy.  Improving \nin the quality of life by providing basic water and sanitation services will have a profound bearing on poverty levels in \nthe poorest areas of Nepal. \n\n \n\n \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nProposed Classification \n\n \nUnder  the  Project,  low-income  families  are  identified  on  the  basis  of  annual  income.  Households  with  an  annual \nincome of less than NRs34,000 ($436) (on the basis of 5.45 members per household) are regarded as poor. The per \ncapita poverty line is therefore NRs6,238 ($80).  \u201cBetter-off\u201d incomes are taken to be those greater than NRs12,844 \n($165).  Socioeconomic analysis of five accessible communities (therefore likely to be relatively well-off) showed that \naround 38% are poor, 43% medium, and 19% better-off.2 \n \nThe  short-term  direct  impact  of  the  Project  on  poverty  will  be  employment  generation  targeted  at  poor  and \ndisadvantaged  groups  in  communities,  especially  women.  Paid  posts  include  health  motivators,  maintenance \ncaretakers, and water and sanitation technicians.  Wages for men and women will be the same.  Low-income families \nwill receive payments for 50% of the time they spend working on the Project,3 and receive concessionary loans and \nsubsidies to support latrine construction. The Project will also benefit the poor through direct support for environmental \nimprovements  and  improved  potential  for  income  generation.  The  integrated  assistance  package  will  have  a  major \nimpact on the quality of life, confidence, and capabilities of community members. \n \nThe  long-term  benefits  of  the  Project  will  arise  principally  from  productive  uses  of  time  saved,  fewer  days  lost  to \nsickness,  and  reduced  in  expenditure  on  medical  treatment.    Sector  studies  show  that  30-38%  of  time  saved  is \ngenerally used for economically productive activities such as farming, livestock rearing and maintenance, household \nmaintenance, vegetable gardening, and cottage industries.  Improved nutrition, child care, and opportunities to rest are \nother important benefits normally cited by beneficiaries  \n \nReliable  data  from  which  to  gauge  full  health  benefits  are  lacking  and  would  almost  certainly  prove  inconclusive. \nHowever, indirect evidence suggests that improved water supply, sanitation, and hygiene practices directly translate \ninto  lower  morbidity  and  mortality  from  waterborne  diseases.  Studies 4  have  found  positive  relationships  between \nconsumption levels of water and personal hygiene, especially in rural areas. Households consuming less than 15 liters \nper  capita  per  day  tend  to  have  unsatisfactory  hygiene  practices  compared  with  those  that  consume  more.  Further, \nthere is a correlation between the level of literacy and awareness of personal hygiene. The community education and \nawareness program will promote improved personal hygiene. \n \n \n                                                 \n1   World Bank. 1996.

An Asian Development Bank (ADB) supported consultative process of more than \n30  workshops  in  the  course  of  8  months  resulted  in  the  design  of  a  sectorwide  approach \n(SWAp) to facilitate meeting the targets set for the sector in the Government\u2019s Tenth Five-Year \nPlan. \n \n2. \n \n\nThe approach decided upon by the Government and ADB raises some critical issues. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nAs  a  result  of  the  Local  Self-Government  Act  (LSGA)  of  1999,  the  central \nagencies  (Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works  [MPPW],  Ministry  of  Local \nDevelopment  [MLD],  Ministry  of  Finance  [MOF],  and  the  National  Planning \nCommission [NPC]) need to involve themselves much more deeply and strongly \nwith  planning,  facilitating,  and  monitoring  developments  under  the  SWAp \npartnership;  and  support  and  enhance  it.  There  are  important  implications  for \nresource allocation, financing, and financing mechanisms. \n\nIt  is  critical  that  all  echelons  of  the  Government  advocates  a  coherent  sector \napproach.  Although  the  decision  makers  at  MPPW,  MLD,  MOF,  and  NPC \nsupport  the  approach  and  are  aware  of  the  opportunities,  officers  at  lower \nechelons  and  decentralized \nlevels  district  development  committee/village \ndevelopment committee are insufficiently involved. Neither are they aware of the \ndevelopments  and  the  opportunities  it  offers,  and  thus  continue  to  promote, \ndevelop, and attract disjunctive and project-based support. \n\nIt  is  to  be  expected  that  a  considerable  part  of  future  external  support  to  the \nsector  will  be  related  to  direct  support  to  community  development  and  poverty \nreduction  in  the  field.  This  support  should  make  use  of  existing  structures  and \ndecision-making  mechanisms  at  national  and  district  level  and  avoid  creating \nparallel structures. This means that, for the sector approach to work, and agency \ncontributions  and  the  Government\u2019s  own  budget  allocation  to  the  sector  should \nbe put in the same  planning framework at central and decentralized levels. This \nallows  government  funding  for  certain  activities,  aid  agency  funding  for  other \nactivities,  and  government-donor  agency  cofinancing  for  again  other  activities. \nSWAp  is    the  only  way  of  providing  for  coherence  and  ownership of the sector \nsupport  program,  and  could  avoid  the  need  for  the  Government  to  allocate \nseparate counterpart funds to some aid agency investments. \n\n \n3. \nThe  approach  taken  under  this  intervention  is  not  based  on  the  size  and  number  of \ninvestments. Instead, the focus is on coordinating aid and the resulting benefits, supporting the \ndecentralization process, and developing capacity at the district and community levels.   \n \n4. \nHowever, in Section B this analysis does assess the outputs directly attributable to this \nintervention  \u2013  but  the  analysis  in  itself  should  not  be  the  overall  criterion  for  approving  the \nintervention and support to the sector. \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 12  49\n\nFinancial Justification for the Approach \n\nB. \n \n5. \nThe question\u2014what are the transaction costs of managing aid in Nepal\u2014is a potentially \nuseful one to ask because high transaction costs may indicate inefficiencies and other problems \nin an aid delivery system. It is difficult to quantify transaction costs; therefore this report focuses \nmainly  on  qualitative  problems.  It  is  in  the  interest  of  both  aid  agencies  and  recipient \ngovernments to minimize all aid transaction costs whether they can be measured easily or not.  \nThis is because high transaction costs may \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ninfluence  the  volume  of  aid  delivered,  by  discouraging  donor  agencies  and \ngovernments from entering into agreements and reducing disbursement rates; \nreduce aid efficiency, by consuming aid and Government resources that could be \notherwise  employed  and  misallocating  the  resources  made  available  under  aid \nagreements; and  \nreduce  aid  effectiveness,  by  encouraging  aid  agencies  and \nrecipient \ngovernments to allocate resources to activities that do not address development \npriorities and, in some cases, undermining institutional development goals.   \n\n \n6. \nThe  costs  arising  from  the  preparation,  negotiation,  implementation,  monitoring,  and \nenforcement of agreements for the delivery of overseas delivery assistance may take the form \nof  administration  costs  (arising  from  inputs  of  resources  needed  for  the  transaction),  indirect \ncosts (resulting from the impact of the delivery mechanism on the achievement of development \ngoals), and opportunity costs (measuring the benefits foregone from alternative applications of \nthe resources consumed in the transaction). \n \n7. \nThe  sector  approach  will  allow  donor  agencies  to  specialize  more  easily  and  move  to \nlarger  joint-funded  projects;  introduce  programmatic  planning  processes;  increase  rates  of \nproject  disbursements;  consolidate  training  activities  and  make  skills  less  donor-specific; and \nincrease  recipient  ownership  of  projects,  particularly  at  the  community  level.  The  sector \napproach is beneficial to both the Government and donor agencies, whether they favor a project \napproach or a sectorwide programmatic approach, whether they give loans or grants. \n \nThe  SWAp  approach  brings  Government  and  aid  agency  policies,  procedures,  and \n8. \npractices closer together over time, mitigating the problem of high transaction costs when so \nmany players insist on different \u201crules of the game.\u201d The ultimate goal of the process is that the \nonly  set  of  guidelines  and  regulations  becomes  those  of  the  Government,  with  donor \ninvolvement limited to ensuring that practice does not deviate from the regulations. \n \n9. \nby addressing issues at both macro and project cycle levels. \n \n10. \n \n \n\nTransaction costs in Nepal will be addressed and possibly reduced by this intervention \n\nAt the macro level, SWAp will have the following key accomplishments: \n\n1. \n\nImprove Medium Term Resource Planning by the Government \n\n11.  Medium-term resource planning by the Government will be improved \n \n\n(i) \n\nby a planning network based on community participation that will help produce a \nmedium-term  fiscal  outlook,  which  will  be  the  basis  for  a  resource  allocation \n\n\f \n\n50\n\nAppendix 12 \n\npolicy in the sector. SWAp will also support the approach that MOF introduced, \nnamely, rolling fiscal budgets; \nby  costed,  medium-term  sector  expenditure  programs  based  on  defined sector \nstrategies and plans, which are currently being adopted by the Government; \nby transforming DDC plans into rolling 5-year programs, renewed annually; and \nby requiring agencies and provinces to submit consolidated recurrent and capital \nbudget proposals simultaneously to the DDC as the focus of central planning. \n\n2. \n\nEnsure Support for this Process by Donors \n\n \n12.  Major  contributors  to  the  sector  and  DFID  which  have  participated  in  the  extensive \nconsultation process express interest in participating in the SWAp because it will  \n\nprovide  information  on  the  level  and  structure  of  aid  agency  commitments  and \nprogrammed  disbursements  over  the  medium-term  planning  horizon  used  by \nGovernment; \nsynchronize fixed-term country programs with the Government's 5-year planning \ncycle; and   \nadopt  medium  -  to  long-term  (5-10  years)  country  programs,  and  roll  forward \ncommitments and disbursement plans on an annual basis.   \n\nImprove The Quality Of Public Expenditure Information  \n\n3. \n \n13. \nDetailed  sector  expenditure  reviews,  led  by  the  Government  with  support  from \ncontributors,  will  enhance  the  quality  of  public  expenditure  data.  A  midterm  review  of  the \nintervention  will  be  written  into  the  loan  document  and  will  form  part  of  the  Government \nassurances. \n\n4. \n\nImprove Aid Coordination  \n\nFormalizing the Stakeholder Group Committee will enhance aid coordination. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nThe structure of working groups can be rationalized. \nThe structure of meetings can be improved. \nGovernment ownership of the coordination function will increase. \nCoordination  group  meetings  can  be  synchronized  with  Government  planning \nand budgeting cycles. \n\nAt the project cycle management level, key accomplishments are as follows. \n\nImprove the Project Identification and Appraisal Process \n\n \n5. \n \nThe Government adopts selection criteria developed for identifying subprojects. \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nRevising the project appraisal criteria will promote consistency and clarity. \nAuthority for project appraisal and approval is devolved to DDC level. \nThe community  is  involved  in  the  early  stages  of  project  design  and  feasibility \nstudies. \nDDC capacity for project design and appraisal is promoted. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n14. \n \n\n \n15. \n \n\n16. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 12  51\n\n6. \n\nEnsure Support for this Process by Donors \n\nDonor agencies will support this process, for it \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nleads to coordinated country programming missions, thus reducing administration \ncosts; and \nallows them to see whether they are engaging the Government appropriately and \nat the right level. \n\n7.  \n\nStandardize Procedures between Government and Donor Agencies \n\n \n18. \nStandardizing  procedures  between  the  Government  and  aid  agencies  could  generate \nefficiency  savings,  strengthen  the  Government's  capacity  to  build  and  reinforce  systems,  and \nenhance  Government  ownership  of  ODA  by  ensuring  Government  leadership  in  decision \nmaking. Standardization of the project design and appraisal process will be achieved by \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nconducting  joint  missions  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  projects,  and  joint \nmissions to identify future interventions; \nadopting  common  forms  for  project  proposals  and  feasibility  studies,  with \nagreement on the nature and quality of information to be provided; and \nusing common appraisal criteria for projects. \n\n \n\n18. \nThe  prospect  of  all  Nepal  aid  delivery  moving  toward  this  model  is  a  long-term one in \nthat  the  macroenvironment  of  aid  delivery  and  budgetary  management  does  not  yet  meet \nseveral  preconditions  needed  to  embark  on  a  fully  programmatic  approach.    The  Government \nand ADB (with cofinancing) have moved toward this approach slightly in the education sector, \nbut  it  is  not  working  effectively  due  to  the  relationship  between  the  aid  agencies  and  their \ninternational procedures.  \n \n19. \nIn  the  short  term,  however,  this  intervention  will  assist  the  Government  to  implement \nmeasures  that  could  achieve  a  more  programmatic  approach  with  the  potential  advantage  of \nincreasing aid effectiveness, although an immediate reduction in transaction costs arising from \nthese developments is not likely.  These initiatives follow \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nbringing projects under one sectoral, or subsectoral strategy; \nconsolidating and rationalizing donor agency projects through joint funding; \nimproving the quality of aid coordination; \ntrying to get a sectoral allocation overview; \nimproving public expenditure management; and \nemphasizing  Government  leadership  throughout,  but  with  a  community- based \napproach. \n\nAssumptions on Project Costs \n\nDue to the nature of the intervention at a sector level, the following analysis is indicative \n20. \nof the type of output made possible by the approach. Because the analysis is based on a five-\nsubproject  sample  it  is  not  representative  of  the  macro  benefits  arising  from  the  intervention. \nThese  benefits  are  difficult  to  quantify.  The  following  analysis  is  provided  to  give  a  visible  and \ntangible demonstration of the effects of the intervention.  \n\n \n17. \n \n\n \n\n \nC. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n52\n\nAppendix 12 \n\n1. \n\nAssumptions for the Economic and Financial Analyses \n\n21. \nThe financial and economic analyses were in accordance with the ADB guidelines in the \nHandbook for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects , 1999. Basic assumptions used \nfor the financial analysis follow: (i) all revenues and investment costs are in constant April 2003 \nprices on an incremental basis; (ii) project investment costs are derived from estimated costs, \nless  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction;  and  (iii)  capital  expenditure  are \nrecorded at the time they are incurred, while interest and depreciation are excluded. \n\n22. \nThe  cost  estimate  of  the  Community-Based  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project  is \ncalculated based on a project period of 6 years (2004-2009) with the base cost data based on \nApril  2003  costs.  An  exchange  rate  of  NRs78/$  and  price  contingencies  of  5.7%  for  local \ninflation  and  2.5%  for  foreign  inflation  were  assumed,  based  on  the  data  and  guidelines  in \nADB\u2019s Project Administration Instructions on preparation of project cost estimates. These rates \nwere applied for the whole period from data collection (April 2003) to project completion.  \n\nThe financial and economic analyses of the Project were conducted individually for each \n23. \nof the five water supply and sanitation core subprojects selected by the end of phase 2 of the \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA).  It  is  not  possible  at  this  stage  of  the  Project  to \nanticipate  the  relative  share  of  each  type  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  subprojects (piped \nwater  supply,  deep  borehole  equipped  with  hand  pumps,  drilled  wells,  etc.)  that  will  be \neffectively implemented on each qualifying province and at project level.  \n\nFor  each  core  subproject,  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  calculated. \n\n24. \nKey assumptions for the economic analysis follow:  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe economic opportunity cost of capital is 12%.  \nThe economic life of the infrastructure and the forecast period for the economic \ncost-benefit analysis is 15 years.  \nAnalysis  used  a  domestic  price  level  numeraire,  expressed  in  Nepali  rupees. \nTradable goods and services were converted into domestic prices by using the \nshadow exchange rate factor, which for Nepal is currently estimated to be 0.9.  \nThe conversion factor for unskilled labor was estimated at 0.70, reflecting the fact \nthat  the  real  market  price  of  labor  in  the  project  area  is  lower  than  the  official \nwage rates, which are used in the financial cost estimates.  \nAll  taxes  and  duties  were  excluded  from  the  cost  estim ates,  and  the  resulting \neconomic values expressed in constant April 2003 price levels. \n\n25. \nQuantifiable  economic  benefits  from  improved  water  supply  include  economic  cost \nsavings on nonincremental water consumption, and incremental water consumption induced by \nimproved  service  and  quality.  The  economic  value  of  non-incremental  water  is  based  on  the \naverage existing economic supply price of water from existing sources and that of incremental \nwater  is  based  on  the  average  demand  price,  all  expressed  in  economic terms in world price \nnumeraire.  Resources  costs  savings  include  the  cost  of  alternative  water  sources  and  time \nsaved in fetching water. \n\n26. \nTable 1 presents a summary of the Average Incremental Financial Cost (AIFC), Average \nIncremental Economic Cost (AEIC), and monthly tariff per household, estimated as a proportion \nof  monthly  tariff  in  household  income;  EIRR;  and  poverty  impact  ratio  (PIR)  for  each  scheme \nand the average of the five schemes. AIFC for water supply and sanitation projects provides a \nmeasure  of  the  cost  per  cubic  meter  in  the  proposed  subprojects  and  the  tariff  needed  to \nprovide  for  full  cost  recovery.  AIEC  is  the  discounted  value  of  incremental  capital  costs  and \n\n\fAppendix 12  53\n\noperating  costs  (in  economic  prices)  over  the  project  life,  divided  by  the  discounted value of \nincremental quantity of water sales. \n\nThe  estimated  average  EIRR  for  the  five  schemes  is  68%.  The  EIRRs  for  individual \n\n27. \nschemes range from 24% to 94%. Para. 29 gives a qualifying explanation of the high values. \n\nTable  1  :  Population,  Number  of  HH,  AIFC,  AIEC,  Monthly  Tariff,  EIRR,  and  PIR  of  the  5 \n\nSelected Schemes \n\n \n \n \n\n234 \n92 \n313 \n291 \n97 \n205 \n\n \n \nNo. of \nHH \n\n \n \nAIEC \n(NRs) \n215 \n279 \n125 \n103 \n120 \n168 \n\n \n \nAIFC \n(NRs) \n221 \n281 \n95 \n104 \n122 \n165 \n\nTariff \nas % of \nMonthly \nIncome \n1.5 \n0.5 \n0.2 \n0.3 \n0.6 \n     0.62 \n\n \nMonthly \nTariff \nPer HH \n129 \n53 \n16 \n17 \n50 \n53 \n\n \nBase \nCase \nEIRR(%) \n87 \n24 \n94 \n47 \n91 \n68 \n\n \n \n \nPopulation \n1,427 \n   592 \n1,669 \n1,945 \n    562 \n1,239 \n\n \n \n \nScheme \nChuriyamai \nDhap \nHirminiya \nLalpur \nPhedayak \nAverage \nAIEC =Average Incremental Economic Cost, AIFC = Average Incremental Financial Cost, EIRR = economic internal \nrate of return, HH = households, PIR = poverty impact ratio. \n \nA number of sensitivity tests were conducted to test the EIRR of each core subproject. \n28. \nSensitivity tests include 10% increase in capital cost and operation and maintenance costs, 10% \nreduction in benefits linked to water tariffs and water consumption, and 20% decrease in assets' \nlifetime. Switching values and AIEC were also calculated for each subproject using a discount \nrate of 12%. No testing was conducted for possible delays in initial investment schedule as the \nsize  and  type  of  investments  considered  will  be  completed  within  1  year  for  each  individual \nsubproject. All results were robust to the tests. \n \n29. \nas it does not include benefits derived from sanitation improvements and health benefits. \n \n\nThe estimated EIRR for the Project as a whole is about 90%.

This  is  expected  to  increase  by  about  20-30% the coverage for water \nsupply in rural areas in the target area.  \n\n31. \nA  community  awareness  program  will  empower  the  village  communities  to  plan  and \nparticipate in subproject screening, design, and implementation. The adoption of this Project will \nin part redress historical inequities in service provision and involvement in decision making by \nwomen,  poor  people,  and  marginalized  castes  and  ethnic  minorities.  The  Project  will  support \nDepartment of Water Supply and Sewerage at the central level and its district departments to \nupgrade  infrastructure  planning  and  implementation  skills.  More  importantly  it  will  support \ncapacity  building  at  DDC,  VDC,  the  private  sector,  and  nongovernment  organizations.  For  the \nsanitation  component,  the  Project  will  increase  by  about  15%  the  existing  improved  sanitation \nsystems. \n\n\f \n\n54\n\nAppendix 12 \n\n3. \n\nAssumption of Water System Type \n\n32. \nAgreed-upon  district  selection  criteria  were  applied  to  all  districts  throughout  Nepal, \nwhich  were  then  prioritized  by  giving  equal  weight  to  the  four  major  criteria  of  gender \ndevelopment  index  (GDI,  a  gender-modified  version  of  the  human  development  index  [HDI]), \npiped water supply coverage, latrine coverage, and incidence of diarrheal disease.  \n\n33. \nThe resulting mapping showed that an approximate 70/30% split of districts most in need \nof  project  assistance  between  those  in  the  hills  and  mountains,  and  those  in  the  terai.    In  the \nhills and mountain areas, gravity systems are the most technically viable water supply option. In \nthe  terai,  the  great  majority  of  sites  (except  a  very  few  sites  close  enough  to  the  hills  where \ngravity systems might be technically feasible) will use improved hand pumps with drilled or dug \nwells. Thus, the Project construction cost estimates assume that 70% of the systems financed \nby the Project will be gravity systems, and the remaining 30% multifamily drilled wells with hand \npumps  attached.  Individual  users  may  upgrade  to  small  electric  pumps,  for  which  they  pay \n100% of the incremental cost. \n\n4. \n\nAssumptions on the Realization of Economic Benefit \n\n34. \nSubprojects  will  be  selected  according  to  the  selection  criteria  designed  for  the  use  of \nthe  DDC.  Three  key  aspects will ensure that the selection criteria will focus the subproject on \nthe anticipated economic benefits:  \n\n(i)  The  technical  solution  will  only  be  chosen  from  the  sample  subproject  proposals \nthat  were  subjected  to  rigorous  economic  analysis  during  the  TA.  All  anticipated \ntechnical options provided an appropriate EIRR.  \n\n(ii)  All  design  options  will  deliver  a  minimum  of  25  liters  per  capita  per  day.  This  is  a \nprerequisite  to  attaining  economic  benefits  as  determined  by  the  subproject \nanalysis. \n\n(iii)  The  design  of  the  technical  solution  must  meet  the  demand  for  a  minimum  time \n\nsaving, being the time required to fetch water from existing water sources. \n\n5.  Affordability \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n35. \nThe communities are aware of Government policy that, to qualify for schemes, they have \nto assume the responsibility for postconstruction operation and maintenance (O&M). In addition, \nthe  village  has  to  contribute  20%  to  the  cost  of  construction.  As  the  average  expressed \nwillingness  to  pay  for  water  and  sanitation  in  each  village  exceeded  by far the required O&M \ncosts, it can be concluded that the overall Project is in principle sustainable. \n\n6. \n\nPoverty Impact \n\n36. \nThe  selection  of  subprojects  for  appraisal  during  the  TA  was  compromised  by  the \nsecurity situation at the time the sites were chosen (before the current cease-fire between the \nGovernment and the Maoists), and it was strongly advised that sites relatively near road heads \nbe  chosen  that  did  not  necessarily  reflect  the  UNDP  HDI  initial  selection  criterion  to  focus  on \npoorer  districts.  The  net  result  was  that  while  one  of  the  communities  was  relatively  poor,  the \nothers were not as poor. Thus the PIR shown in Table 1 is not likely to be representative of the \nkinds of communities that will actually be supported by the Project.  \n\n\fAppendix 12  55\n\n7. \n\nMaximum Al lowable Subproject Capital Cost Work Sheet  \n\n37. \nA basic calculation that provides a maximum justifiable construction cost is required for \neach subproject.

IEEs of five sample subprojects1 were undertaken \nduring the course of the  project preparatory technical assistance (TA). The Project is classified \nas environmental category B. The IEE study was prepared in accordance with the Government \nof  Nepal's  environmental  legislation  and  Asian  Development  Bank's  (ADB)  environmental \nassessment  and  requirements.  The  study  is  based  on  the  TA,  comprehensive  reports  by \nrelevant Government agencies, research institutions, and ADB Mission findings.  \n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n2. \nThe  Project,  developed  as  a  sector  loan  under  the  framework  of  the  Government\u2019s \npoverty reduction focus in the 10th National Plan, will provide rural water supply and sanitation \n(RWSS)  facilities  and  services  to  improve  community  health  and  provide  opportunities  for \nincome generation to about 1,200 communities in 21 districts. It will also facilitate the building of \ninstitutional  capacity  of  local  government  institutions  district  development  committees,  village \ndevelopment  committees  reflecting  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  decentralized  decision \nmaking  by  focusing  implementation  on  the  district  level.  With  its  strong  community-based \napproach, the Project will help rectify historical inequities in providing RWSS services to remote \ndistricts, and will focus on service provision to previously underserved communities and families \nwithin those communities whose access to RWSS was limited due to gender, caste, or ethnicity. \n \n3. \nThe  Project  has  a  RWSS  component  (the  rural  component  and  an  institutional \nstrengthening  component).  The  rural  component  will  include  community  mobilization  and \ncapacity  building  for  sustainability;  construction  of  community  water  supply  and  sanitation \nfacilities;  health  and  hygiene  program  and  gender,  caste,  and  ethnic  minority  program.  The \ninstitutional  component  will  (i)  look  at  strengthening  the  capacity  of  DDCs  to  provide  water \nsupply and sanitation services, and (ii) support the decentralization policy and the Department \nof Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS) Central Planning and Monitoring Unit in its new role as \nfacilitator of RWSS. \n\nC. \n\nEnvironmental Requirements \n\n1. \n\nThe Rural Component \n\na. \n\n Community Mobilization and Capacity Building for Sustainability \n\nThis  activity  will  involve  environmentally  harmless  activities  intended  to  develop  the \n\n4. \ncapacity of water user groups (WUGs). \n \n\n                                                 \n1   A sample IEE of a subproject is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\n\fAppendix 13  57 \n\nb. \n\nConstruction of Community Water Supply and Sanitation Facilities \n\n5. \nIn  this  activity,  RWSS  facilities  will  be  financed  by  the  Project.  Water  supply  systems \nfacilities include (i) gravity pipe  system, (ii) groundwater tube well, (iii) rainwater harvesting, and \n(iv)  groundwater  wells  with  hand  pumps.  Sanitation  facilities  include  (i)  simple  pit  latrines,  (ii) \npour-flush  latrines,  and  (iii)  cistern  flush  latrines.  Not  one  of  these  schemes  is  associated with \npotentially  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  as  they  are  small  and  environmental \nfactors  will  be  taken  into  account  from  the  planning  and  design  stages.  However,  minor  and \nlocalized  environmental  impacts  and  risk  may  occur  and  could  reduce  the  benefits.    These \nimpacts  include  inadequate  drainage  (stagnant  pools  of  water  becoming  the  habitat  of \nmosquitoes  and  other  disease  vectors);  pollution  of  source  water  or  during  transmission, \ndistribution,  or  in-house  storage  due  to  improper  water  management;  source  disputes  with \nexisting  or  prospective  water  users;  damage  to  the  system  or  disruption  of  the  supply  due  to \nfloods,  landslides,  animals;  and  water  source  depletion  from  overuse.    These  environmental \nimpacts are localized any potential negative impacts by improper siting, cumulative effects, and \ninadequate  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  procedures  of  the  systems  will  be  managed \nthrough  the  Project\u2019s  environmental  assessment  and  monitoring  procedures.  Environmental \ncriteria for selecting the subprojects are set out in the table. These environmental criteria as well \nas an Environmental Screening Procedure and Checklist for Scheme Appraisal will be attached \nto  the  loan  agreement  with  the  Government  of  Nepal  and  to  the  Project  agreements  between \nthe  Executing  Agency,  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works  and  the  DDCs  and  the \nparticipating community.   \n\nc. \n\nHealth and Hygiene Program \n\nThis  activity  will \n\n6. \ncommunities awareness of health and hygiene issues related to water supply and sanitation. \n\ninvolve  environmentally  harmless  activities \n\nintended \n\nto  raise \n\nd. \n\nGender, Caste, and Ethnic Minority Program \n\n7. \nA program to increase the active participation of disadvantaged groups and women in all \nactivities of the WUGs and water user and sanitation committee through training and awareness \nprograms will be implemented. \n\n2. \n\nThe Institutional Strengthening Component \n\nThis component will provide training and technical support to participating DDCs to allow \n8. \nthem  to  plan,  manage,  monitor,  and  evaluate  community-based  RWSS.  This  component  will \nalso  provide  TA  to  DWSS  to  carry  out  its  new  role  as  facilitator  of  RWSS.  Though  these \nactivities  will  not  have  any  environmental  impacts,  the DDCs as well as DWSS will be made \naware of and will be trained on environmental issues related to RWSS to ensure that technical \nguidelines and standards take into account environmental concerns. \n \nD. \n \n\nEnvironmental Review Procedure \n\n1. \n\nNepal\u2019s Environmental Assessment and Review Procedures \n\n \n9. \nThe Environmental Protection Act 2053 (1996) and the Environmental Protection Rules \n(EPR)  2054  (1997),  revised  in  2055  (1999)  and  supported  by  acts  such  as  the  Forest  Act, \nNational Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, and the Local Self-Governance Act, provide the \nbasic legal framework for environmental appraisal in Nepal.  According to EPR criteria, RWSS \nschemes  do  not  require  a  formal  environmental  appraisal  except  for  certain  criteria  such as \nnumber of people being served; need for resettlement if any; diversion of water from a surface \n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 13 \n\nsource;  capacity  of  water  treatment  plant;  etc.  In  these  cases,  an  IEE  or  an  environmental \nimpact  assessment  will  be  required.  Where  no \nis  required,  an  environmental \nscreening/appraisal of the schemes will be carried out. An environmental screening procedure \nand an environmental checklist for scheme appraisal have been drawn up and will be attached \nto the Project Agreement between DDC and the community.  \n\nIEE \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Procedures to Be Used for Scheme Appraisal \n\n10.  When a community is ready to select its scheme and start planning, with the assistance \nof  the  contracted  nongovernment  organization/community-based  organization (NGO/CBO) the \nWUSC  will  fill  out  the  environmental  checklist  for  scheme  appraisal  and  complete  an \nenvironmental brief. This will be done in a participatory manner as scheme selection involves all \nWUGs.  The  documents  will  be  submitted  with  the  scheme  application to the DDC. The DDC, \nwith  assistance  initially  from  the  WSST,  will  carry  out  the  environmental  screening  procedure2 \nfor potential environmental impacts and compliance with formal requirements.3  \n \nIn addition to the technical supervision during planning, design, and construction of the \n11. \nschemes by the NGOs/CBOs, the DDC technical officer with the assistance of the WSST will \nregularly  monitor  activities  during  each  phase  of  the  scheme  (planning,  design,  construction, \nO&M)  to  ensure  that  environmental  concerns  are  being  addressed  and  appropriate  mitigation \nmeasures are in place.  \n \n12. \nDWSS  will  commission  two  independent  assessments  of  environmental  performance \nduring  the  project  period  by  random  sampling  of  project  schemes  and  will  focus  on  (i) \ncompliance  with  environmental  screening  and  related  requirements;  (ii)  use  of  environmental \nguidelines  for  planning  and  development;  (iii)  satisfactory  monitoring  by  the  DDC;  (iv) \nsatisfactory  support,  supervision,  and  guidance  by  NGOs/CBOs;  (v)  general  level  of  project \nenvironmental  performance;  (vi)  O&M  status  of  constructed  facilities;    and    (vii)  water  quality \ntesting of sample schemes with cross-checking of water quality test carried out by the DDC. The \nresults of these assessments will be sent to ADB for review.  During its review missions, ADB \nwill also assess environmental compliance of the DDC and communities.  \n\n3. \n\nConformity  of  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Procedures  with \nADB\u2019s Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies  \n\n13. \nThe  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  have  been  reviewed  and  found \nto  be  satisfactory  and  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies.   \nSpecific evaluations will be carried out throughout the project life to ensure that the guidelines \nare  adhered  to  and  that  adequate  training  is  given  to  DDC  and  DWSS  staff  carrying  out  the \nassessment and to the communities receiving the services.  \n\n                                                 \n2   The  screening  includes  siting,  execution,  and  O&M  considerations.  The  results  are  then  fed  into  a  matrix  and \nmitigation  measures  are  developed  for  each  indicated  impact.  Costs  and  responsibilities  are  then  assigned.  The \ncost  of  the  identified  environmental  mitigation  measures  will  be  included  in  the  schemes\u2019  costs,  and  their \nimplementation will be monitored.  \n\n3   An IEE methodology and procedure has been developed for RWSS and is included in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\n\f  \n\nSUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA \n \n\nProject Activity \n \nAn environmental appraisal and project brief will be prepared by the water user and sanitation committees and submitted to the district development committees \n(DDC) after which the DDC will carry out environmental screening. Environmental screening will specify how the impacts will be minimized by approaching the \nactivities and practices in an environmentally sensitive manner. All subprojects will ensure active participation of women, excluded castes, and ethnic minority groups \nas set in the gender, caste, and ethnic minority program. No scheme will have a negative impact on these groups.  \nWater Supply Schemes \n \nThe source should be assessed and an agreement in writing drawn up for water use by all \nusers (community, farmers, etc.). \n\nSpecial Specifications \n\nThe scheme will not be located in the premises of cultural sites. \n\nSchemes will not be located within protected and forest areas.   \n\n \n\n \n\nScheme components will not be located on steep slopes, landslide areas, moist areas, and \nloess deposit areas. \n\nAfter selecting the source, the WUG will develop measures to prevent pollution of the water \nsource and the system as a whole \n\nSource  depletion  will  be  assessed  especially  on  south-facing  slopes  with  no  vegetation \ncover.  Promotion  of  community  forestry,  tree/grass  plantation,  horticultural activities, and \nother activities that will increase or protect vegetation cover in the catchment/recharge area \nwill be undertaken. \nNo quarrying on unstable slopes will be carried out. \nAll construction activities will be undertaken only during the dry season. \nAny clear topsoil will be set aside for later use. Vegetation cover will be replaced after \nconstruction of the scheme. \nPipe laying on steep slopes will be avoided. \n\n \n \n \n\nAt  the  site  of  water  points,  drainage  problems  will  be  considered.  Water  points  will  be \nlocated in higher areas to facilitate drainage and measures will be implemented to ensure \nadequate  drainage.  A  maintenance  plan  will  be  drawn  up  and  those  designated \nresponsible will be trained for operation and maintenance (O&M). \nThe DDC will set up a water quality monitoring program to monitor chemical and biological \ncontamination. \n\n \nThe  community  mobilization  activity  will  ensure  that  all  concerned \nparties  are  consulted  and  agreement  is  reached  on  the  use  of  the \nsource. \nIf this is absolutely not possible, approval in writing from the concerned \ncommunity or relevant Government agency needs to be sought. \nShould  a  component  of  the  scheme  need  to  pass  by  a  protected  or \nforest area, approval in writing will be sought from the Protected Area \nAuthority and the community forest user groups. \nMeasures  will  be  developed  with  the  assistance  of  nongovernment \norganizations  and  the  district  development  committees  (DDC).  These \ncan  include  ditches  to  divert  runoff  away  from  source,  fencing  off  the \nsource to control entry of animals, providing separate washing facilities \nsufficiently far from the water source, etc. \nThe  DDC  will  ensure  that  these  activities  take  place  if  the  source  is \nlocated  on  these  slopes.  Each  DDC  will  set  up  a  groundwater \nmonitoring program for the participating communities. \n \n\nimplemented \n\nAdequate  protection  measures  will  be \nunavoidable. \nAwareness  raising  and  training  in  O&M  and  behavioral  change  will \ntake  place  before  schemes  are  implemented  to  ensure  adequate \nmaintenance of the schemes, and hygienic behavior and proper use of \nthe facilities. \n DWSS will train technical DDC staff to carry out water quality testing. \n\nthis \n\nis \n\nif \n\n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n3\n\ni\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n5\n9\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nProject Activity \nSanitation Schemes (Latrines) \nLatrines  will  not  be  constructed  on  fractured  rocky  soil  or  any  other  soil  that  drains  too \nquickly, not allowing the removal of pathogens and other pollutants. \nLatrines  will  not  be  located  uphill  of  a  water  source  or  facility,  on  a  river/stream  bank \ndischarging waste into it, or close to a water source or to water supply facilities such as a \nreservoir, tap stand, and well. \nLatrines will be located at least 30 meters away from any water supply source or facility. \nCommunity health, sanitation, and awareness programs will have to be carried out before  \nlatrine construction. \n\n \n \n\n \n\nSpecial Specifications \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n3\n \n \n \n \n \n\ni\n\n6\n0\n \n\n \nDesign of the latrines is important and will consider the following: \n Safe  for  use  of  children  and  adults,  minimal  human  contact  with  raw \nwaste,  minimal  odor,  and  minimal  contamination  of  the  surrounding \nwater and soil.
