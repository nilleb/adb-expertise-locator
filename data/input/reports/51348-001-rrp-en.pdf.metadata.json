The  report  also  describes  proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Implementing the Mortgage Market Sector Development Program, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, approve the TA. \n \n2. \nThe program aims to establish a new institutional framework and financing mechanism to \npromote  market-based  mortgage  finance  in  Uzbekistan,  expand  the  availability  of  residential \nmortgage products, and bring product innovation to the banking sector. Measures supported by \nthe  FIL  will  enable  banks  to  access  long-term  funding,  promote  competition,  and  remove \ninefficiencies and distortions in the housing finance market. The PBL will support the Government \nof Uzbekistan in reforming its housing policy and subsidy framework to ensure an efficient use of \npublic  resources  and  achieve  the  fiscal  sustainability  of  housing  subsidies.  The  proposed \ntransaction TA will help implement the program. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nMacroeconomic context. Since 2017, Uzbekistan has undertaken critical reforms, which \nhave sustained a gross domestic product (GDP) growth above 5% in 2018.1 The country moved \nto a more liberal exchange rate and trade regime in 2017 and is undertaking major fiscal reforms. \nSubstantive progress has also been achieved through ongoing structural and institutional reforms. \nThe government is keen to continue its reform agenda, but it remains challenging. To sustain high \ngrowth and to make the private sector the primary driver of growth, the government has prioritized \nthe  restructuring  of  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  public  finance  management  reforms, \nincluding ad hoc transfers from the state budget to SOEs, and finance sector development. \n \n4. \nSector development context. Access to affordable and long-term mortgage finance is \nneeded to meet the growing housing demand, which is the result of population growth and years \nof underinvestment in the housing sector.2 Uzbekistan needs to produce 145,000 new housing \nunits per year until 2040 to keep up with new household formation and replace old housing stock, \nwith most new housing needed in urban areas. This figure is well above current production figures; \nthe  housing  shortfall  is  therefore  increasing  annually  despite  the  government\u2019s  involvement  to \naddress it. In the past, the government initiated a number of housing subsidy programs mostly \nadministered by state-owned commercial banks to improve the housing conditions in the country.3 \nHowever, the inefficiently structured and targeted subsidies are costly for the government and are \n\n                                                \n1  This is despite adverse weather conditions for agriculture and ongoing reform challenges such as tariff adjustments \n\nof utilities and institutional restructuring of the energy sector. \n\n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates a need of 100,000 units per year until 2040 to deal with population \ngrowth, based on secondary source estimates of square meters per person needed, while also taking into account \nslowing population growth and decreasing household size. In addition, the country would need an estimated 45,000 \nunits  per  year until 2040  to  decrease  substantially  the current  housing  deficit because  of  overcrowding  and  poor \nhousing conditions. \n\n3  Uzbekistan  has  21  different  government  housing  subsidy  programs  targeting,  for  instance,  the  rural  and  urban \n\npopulation, young families, teachers, military personnel, and public sector employees. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fit \n\nthat \n\nCore  development  problem.  The  government  acknowledges \n\nnot  conducive  to  the  development  of  market-based  solutions  by  focusing  solely  on  a  limited \nnumber of households and products.4 \n \n5. \nlacks  a \ncomprehensive housing policy and subsidies framework. The existing housing finance programs \nare  not  effectively  coordinated  in  terms  of  design,  targeting,  and  use  of  subsidies,  resulting  in \ninefficient use of limited fiscal resources.5 The government also recognizes the need to gradually \nreplace  or  phase  out  the  existing  programs  and  move  to  a  market-based  mortgage  finance \nmechanism in addressing the housing needs of the population. \n \n6. \nLow  mortgage  finance  intermediation  by  banks  dominated  by  state  housing \nprograms. The mortgage loan portfolio of Uzbek banks has increased steadily during 2013\u20132018, \nas  reflected  by  the  high  compound  annual  growth  rate  of  all  bank  mortgage  loan  portfolios  of \n31.4% and growth in the total gross loan portfolio of banks of 36.8% during this period. As of the \nend  of  2018,  the  total  mortgage  loan  portfolio  had  grown  to  SUM13.8  trillion.  However,  these \nfigures still only represent 8.3% of banks\u2019 total loans outstanding and 3.4% of the GDP. 6 Since \n2007, most state housing programs have been mainly delivered by public banks.7 Six public banks \nissued 92% of all mortgage loans under the government\u2019s rural and urban housing programs (i.e. \nat subsidized rates). As a result, of the 39,556 mortgage loans issued in 2018, 75% by number, \nand 72% by volume, of loans were issued under the various state housing programs.8 \n \n7. \nLack  of  access  to  long-term  funding  and  underdeveloped  capital  markets.  All \ncommercial banks are constrained by the lack of access to long-term funding (beyond 1 year). \nThis results in banks\u2019 aversion to fund residential mortgages and leads to limited experience and \ninsufficient internal capacity to properly design, analyze, price, and service mortgage loans. The \ncapital market in the country is underdeveloped and illiquid. There is no active bond market to \nmobilize  long-term  financing  from  institutional  investors,  such  as  pension  funds  or  insurance \ncompanies. Despite  the  sizable  mortgage  loan  portfolio  in  public  banks,  these  mortgage  loans \ncannot be used by the banks for the issuance of corporate bonds or mortgage-backed securities \nbecause of the highly subsidized interest rates. New instruments such as long-term saving plans \nfor households are also absent. \n \nThe  proposed  sector  development  program  (SDP)  aims  to  develop  a  market-based \n8. \nresidential mortgage market by (i) designing and implementing a new housing policy, reforming \nhousing  subsidies,  and  reviewing  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework;  (ii)  strengthening  the \ninstitutional  framework  to  administer  housing  policy  and  subsidies  by  establishing  a  Housing \nAssistance Unit (HAU) in the Ministry of Finance (MOF); and (iii) making long-term fixed-rate local \ncurrency funds available to banks to enable them to expand their range of residential mortgage \n\n                                                \n4  Most programs focus on housing construction, with interest rate-based subsidies, while no options are provided for \n\nsmall renovations or purchase of existing housing units. \n\n5  According to ADB\u2019s calculations, the cost to the government of the finance subsidies to banks and lost tax revenues \nof the various subsidies is about 79% of the cost of a house produced under the subsidy programs or SUM110 million \nfor a SUM140 million house. If construction costs increase, housing prices and the costs of the subsidies will also \nincrease. \n\n6  These indicators are very modest compared with more mature markets\u2014the percentage of mortgage loans to the \ntotal loan portfolio in banks in the United States and most European countries is about 50%. The ratio of mortgage \nloans  to  GDP  in  selected  countries  of  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  is  about  5.6%  in  the  Russian \nFederation and 12.1% in Georgia.

The \nprogram is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy for \nUzbekistan,  2019\u20132023,10  which  supports  inclusive  and  sustainable  economic  growth  through \nfinancial  market  development,  access  to  finance,  private  sector  development,  and  domestic \nresource  mobilization.  The  program  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  for \nUzbekistan,  2019\u20132021,11and  will  be  the  first  SDP  in  the  country.  In  late  2017,  ADB  provided \nknowledge support TA to conduct detailed diagnostics of the housing finance sector, which led to \na comprehensive government reform program. The program supports key operational priorities \nof ADB\u2019s Strategy 203012 such as making cities more livable, addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities, accelerating progress in gender equality and strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity.  \n \n10. \nGovernment\u2019s  reform  agenda.  Based  on  ADB\u2019s  advice  and  preparatory  work,  the \ngovernment  prepared  a  comprehensive  presidential  decree  to  reform  the  mortgage  finance \nsector, which was signed on 13 May 2019.13 The decree establishes a strategic road map for the \ndevelopment  of  the  mortgage  market,  including  reforms  to  the  existing  housing  policy  and \nsubsidies framework, over the period of 2019\u20132021. The government plans to gradually reduce \nits direct role in providing long-term funding for residential mortgage finance, remove interest rate \nsubsidies and other distortions in the finance sector, reform the regressive subsidy framework, \nand establish efficient administrative mechanisms. Over time, the government plans to enable the \noperations of new institutions and to replace the current inefficient and costly subsidy programs \nwith  transparent  and  efficient  subsidies  to make residential mortgages  more  affordable to  low- \nand middle-income families. \n \n11. \nRationale for a sector development program. The SDP modality is justified because \nthe sector requires both a policy reform component and an investment component (supported by \nthe FIL), which are interlinked. The PBL will focus on reforms that are necessary for creating the \nenabling  environment for  an  effective  and  efficient mortgage finance  market. The  FIL  will  help \nestablish a new type of financial institution (i.e., the UMRC) with private sector participation and \nmake  long-term  funds  available  to  banks.  Initially,  the  UMRC  will  use  ADB  resources  and \nsubsequently access the capital market by issuing bonds (i.e., once the domestic capital markets \nare sufficiently developed). Therefore, the program will ensure that (i) reforms to improve market \nintermediation are pursued continuously, (ii) government housing policies and subsidy programs \nare streamlined to effectively support low- and middle-income borrowers, and (iii) much-needed \nlong-term financing to banks is provided to expand the range of market-based mortgage products. \nThese measures will enable banks to access long-term funding, promote competition, and remove \nmarket inefficiencies and distortions. \n \n                                                \n9  Overall, the supply side of the mortgage market infrastructure in Uzbekistan is stronger than in many countries of \nsimilar income level and is conducive to the development of housing finance.  ADB\u2019s analysis shows that the main \nsupply-side elements are in place and functional to support the key priority areas for reform (supported under output \n1) aimed at accelerating the development of housing finance. \n\n10  ADB. 2019.

The multitranche PBL will primarily support reforms \nunder  outputs  1  and  2.16  The  PBL  comprises  13  policy  actions  under  tranche  1  and  14  policy \nactions under tranche 2. The FIL will focus on delivering output 3 of the program. \n \n14. \nOutput 1: Policy, regulatory, and legal framework for the mortgage finance industry \nstrengthened. The government will revise and strengthen the existing housing policy and subsidy \nframework, which is presently distorting the financial system (i.e., government housing programs \nare provided at below-market rates, crowding out market funding and pricing). Activities include \nreview of the existing, and establishment of better targeted, subsidy programs that reach lower-\nincome  households.  Some  of  the  changes  under  tranche  1  of  the  PBL  are  aimed  at  reducing \nexcessive subsidies and their regressive nature.17 Policy actions under tranche 2 of the PBL will \nfurther deepen these reforms to enhance the fiscal sustainability and effectiveness of pro-poor \ntargeting.18  The  transition,  which  the  UMRC  will  facilitate,  toward  stronger  private  sector \nparticipation in the development of the housing sector will be supported by (i) introducing a new \ncategory of financial institutions specializing in mortgage refinancing activities, (ii) mandating the \nCentral  Bank  of  Uzbekistan  (CBU)  to  supervise  and  regulate  this  new  category  of  financial \ninstitutions,  and  (iii)  developing  new  regulations  on  mortgage  lending  to  induce  sound  lending \npractices by banks. \n \nOutput 2: Housing finance strategy and subsidy framework strengthened. Tranche \n15. \n1  of  the  PBL  will  establish  the  institutional  mechanisms  required  to  effectively  implement  and \nrationalize the government\u2019s housing subsidy framework. The government will establish the HAU \nto coordinate all existing housing policies and subsidy programs.19 In the initial phase, the HAU \nwill take stock of the existing government housing programs and redefine the eligibility criteria for \nbeneficiaries,  review  the  housing  policy  framework,  and  agree  on  a  road  map  that  sets  out \npriorities for the required legal and policy reforms. Ultimately, the HAU will become a single point \n\n                                                \n14 Government of Uzbekistan. 2017. 2017\u20132021 National Development Strategy. Tashkent. \n15 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n16 The PBL will also support some of the activities under output 3 such as the incorporation of UMRC, preparation of a \nsupervisory and regulatory framework for companies specializing in mortgage refinancing activities and amendments \nto  the capital market  regulations governing  the  procedures  for  institutional investors  to  invest  in  bonds issued  by \ncompanies such as UMRC. \n\n17 For instance, by introducing a gradual step-up process for increasing the interest rates for housing loans rather than \nthe current scheme where interest rates stay at 7% for the first 5 years and then jump to the CBU refinancing rate \n(currently  16%),  which  creates  a  payment  shock  for  mortgagors.  Other  changes  include  the  revision  of  the \namortization  schedule  to  fixed  monthly  repayments  (annuity  scheme)  in  line  with  international  norms,  and  the \nintroduction of new lending products in the form of small loans for home repairs and improvements. \n\n18 The government has eliminated some tax exemptions for existing and new housing subsidy programs starting in \n2020. The presidential decree requires the elimination of all value-added tax benefits from 1 January 2020 onwards \nand the commissioning of an assessment study to evaluate the impact on the economy and state budget with respect \nto a gradual phaseout of deduction of interest and principal payments from the income tax base of the homeowner \nbeneficiaries,  the  elimination  of  property  tax  deductions  for  all  owners  of  housing  units,  and  tax  incentives  to \nconstruction companies and suppliers. \n\n19 The decision to establish the HAU in the MOF was based on the MOF\u2019s capacity, mandate, and past experience. \n\n\fof  contact  for  all  housing  programs  and  subsidy  schemes,  with  the  objectives  of  reducing  the \nexcessive burden on the public budget and improving efficiency and sustainability. The HAU will \nalso  increase  coverage  by  developing  innovative  and  new  housing  finance  solutions  and \ninstruments (such as the up-front and one-time subsidy schemes for low-income beneficiaries, \nand rental programs in the housing sector). \n \n16. \nThe following actions will be carried out by the government under tranche 2 of the PBL to \nfacilitate implementation of outputs 1 and 2: (i) introduction of a pilot program of income-based \nup-front housing subsidies for low-income families and preparation of a feasibility study for a new \ngovernment-sponsored  housing  assistance  scheme;  (ii)  development  of  a  comprehensive \nhousing  and  mortgage  market  database;  (iii)  eventual  transformation  of  the  HAU  into  an \nindependent housing agency; (iv) preparation and approval of a new system for the collection and \ntimely dissemination of statistical data and information on the housing sector, which will ultimately \nlead  to  the  establishment  of  a  house  price  index;  (v)  review  and  amendment  of  the  current \nprudential and regulatory framework governing housing finance and mortgage lending in line with \ninternational norms; and (vi) comprehensive  review of the housing sector (demand and supply \nsides) to identify areas and initiatives to promote greater competition by introducing international \nbest  practices.  A  feasibility  study  will  also  look  into  the  future  roles  and  relevance  of  the  two \ndominant state-owned real estate developers. \n \nOutput  3:  The  establishment  and  operationalization  of  the  mortgage  refinancing \n17. \ncompany supported with long-term funding. Under this output (solely addressed by the FIL), \nADB  will  provide  long-term  funding  to  the  proposed  UMRC  to  make  long-term  local  currency \nresources available to banks to fund residential mortgage and housing improvement loans.20 The \nUMRC will facilitate the provision of mortgage loans at an interest rate close to market rates (with \nan average loan maturity of 10 years), and address the demand for housing improvement loans, \nwhich are currently unavailable in the market.21 The UMRC will address a fundamental market \nconstraint  that  is  preventing  banks  from  expanding  their  housing  finance  portfolios,  by  better \nmatching  their  assets  and  liabilities.22  The  UMRC  will  provide  loans  to  participating  financial \ninstitutions (PFIs) that are secured by eligible mortgage loans, based on criteria that will assess \nproduct  design,  market-based  pricing,  underwriting  practices,  loan  documentation,  and \nperformance. This will help to professionalize the overall housing finance industry and address \nthe risks associated with broadening access to housing finance across new borrower segments.23 \nEligibility criteria will also target end-beneficiaries that are currently underserved by the banking \nsector. In the medium to long term, the UMRC  will  support more exponential sector growth by \n\n                                                \n20 The  Financial  Analysis  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  the  Appendix  2)  contains  the  proposed \n\neligibility criteria with respect to the participating financial institutions (PFIs) and subloans to be refinanced. \n\n21 The UMRC expects to onlend proceeds from the ADB loan at a fixed rate of 13% to the PFIs, which is very competitive \nwhen compared to banks\u2019 other sources of funding. The PFIs will onlend these funds to end-borrowers at a maximum \nspread of 5% for mortgage loans and 4% for home improvement loans. Mortgage market rates currently stand at \nabout 21%\u201323% per annum for an average tenor of 7 years. \n\n22 Further information on the objectives and roles that the UMRC is expected to play in the financial markets can be \nfound  in  the  Overview  of  the  Uzbekistan  Mortgage  Refinancing  Company  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n23 An MRC is a wholesale financial institution providing long-term finance to mortgage lenders. It raises funds with long \ntenors from various sources (such as the government and bilateral and multilateral development finance institutions) \nand by issuing bonds in the capital markets. With the proceeds, an MRC provides long-term loans to participating \ncommercial  banks  and  housing  finance  companies.  It  bridges  the  maturity  mismatch  that  mortgage  lenders  face \nwhen trying to do long-term lending using their short-term deposits. The business model of an MRC, like the proposed \nUMRC, is low risk. The refinancing loans are fully matched by the bond issues so there is no asset\u2013liability mismatch. \nLoans are over-collateralized (typically 110%\u2013125%) by a mortgage loan portfolio pledged by the banks that must \nmeet strict quality criteria, which reduces credit risk. \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fValue Added by ADB \n\nusing new debt instruments such as corporate bonds, covered bonds, and/or mortgage-backed \nsecurities to mobilize long-term funds from institutional investors.24 \n \nC. \n \n18. \nADB\u2019s  value  addition  and  lessons  learned.  The  program  will  address  underlying \nhousing finance market constraints that have inhibited its growth and sustainability. It will build on \nthe foundations established under the two prior ADB rural housing programs, which have helped \nbuild the capacity of the domestic housing construction industry and stimulated the development \nof an emerging mortgage lending industry, largely under government-sponsored programs.25 Prior \nprogram  support  has  served  to  gradually  expand  the  number  of  banks  providing  residential \nmortgage  loans;  however,  the  programs\u2019  impact  and  scale  were  constrained  by  the  limited \navailable fiscal resources. Therefore, the program is a logical continuation of ADB\u2019s work to reform \nthe mortgage sector (and an acknowledgement of the limitations of the prior subsidized approach \nto  market  development).26  The  program  will  also  help  establish  an  institutional  framework  and \nempirical benchmarks to improve access to housing for low- and middle-income households.27 \n \n19. \nThe program fits within broader ADB engagement to improve the government\u2019s fiscal and \nfinancial  management  capacity  and  strengthen  the  banking  sector  (particularly  its  supervision \nframeworks)  under  the  Economic  Management  Improvement  Program;28  and  to  develop  the \ndomestic capital markets (under a forthcoming ADB intervention) to diversify the banking sector\u2019s \nfunding sources, reduce financing costs, and improve its management of risk\u2014paving the way \ntoward broadening the banking sector\u2019s business development potential and facilitating enhanced \nmarket  activity  (including  the  UMRC\u2019s  expected  future  issuance  of  advanced  capital  market \ninstruments,  such  as  covered  bonds  and  mortgage-backed  securities).29  The  combination  of \npolicy  reforms  and  local  currency  support  for  banks  (via  the  UMRC)  under  the  program  will \nintroduce  international  good  practices  into  the  housing  finance  sector.  Further,  ADB  currently \nprovides hands-on support to operationalize the UMRC through a TA of $500,000, financed on a \ngrant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund.30 \n\n                                                \n24 The establishment of a wholesale mortgage finance provider of long-term funds raised on the capital market has \noccurred in various countries, both developed and developing, always with support from the government for the initial \nramp-up phase. \n\n25 ADB.  2011.

ADB \nhas been the lead partner in supporting a holistic approach to development of the sector to date \n(prior ADB support identified in footnote 25). Additional development partners\u2019 support has been \nconcentrated  on  (i)  expanding the  supply  of  housing  and  its  associated  infrastructure  (i.e.,  the \nIslamic Development Bank\u2019s contribution of $300 million under the State Affordable Rural Housing \nProgram); (ii) strengthening regulations and building codes for, and  improving access to, cost- \nand energy-saving technology for lower-income housing (i.e., the United Nations Development \nProgramme); and (iii) upgrading the real property registration and cadaster system (i.e., the World \nBank). Further, ADB has coordinated with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and addresses \nsome  of  its  recommendations  in  the  program  design.31,  32  These  include  recommendations  to \nprioritize reforms that address market distortions and promote private sector development. The \nprogram  will  carry  out  this  agenda  through  rationalizing  fiscal  expenditures  and  improving \ngovernance and business incentives in the housing sector to unlock market growth. The IMF\u2019s \nadvisory  support  to  the  government  is  primarily  focused  on  tax  reforms  and  improvement  of \nmacroeconomic data collection, analysis, and dissemination systems. \n \nD. \n \nThe overall annual financing need for the housing sector is estimated to amount to about \n21. \n$2.2 billion.33 Given that about 44,000 housing units are projected to be built annually from 2019\u2013\n2023 (under the various government housing programs at an assumed average housing unit cost \nof SUM140 million to SUM200 million), the cost to the government per year is estimated to be \nfrom  SUM4,488  billion  ($476  million  equivalent)  to  SUM6,600  billion  ($700  million  equivalent) \ndepending on the mix of housing unit prices.34 The estimated shortfall between the government \nbudget  allocations  and  the  overall  housing  sector  financing  needs  therefore  amounts  to  $1.5 \nbillion\u2013$1.8  billion  per  year.  The  program  will  mobilize  private  sector  financing  to  reduce  the \nsector\u2019s  reliance  on  fiscal  expenditures  to  address  this  shortfall,  and  introduce  the  structural \nreforms required to rationalize subsidy programs and related expenditures.  \n \n22. \nThe government has requested a concessional loan of $50 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the PBL component of the program. The PBL will have a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2.0% per year during the grace \nperiod and thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement \nfor  the  PBL.  The  government  has  also  requested  a  regular  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to help finance the FIL component of the program. The FIL will have a \n20-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements. Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity is 12.75 \nyears, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The PBL will be disbursed over a period \nof 3 years in two tranches of equal amounts against achievement of policy actions under tranches \n\n                                                \n31  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 IMF. 2019.

The advisor will guide, coach, and train officers on \nall business processes (e.g., handling requests for a refinance loan from a bank, undertaking the \ndue  diligence  process  of  the  prospective  bank,  processing  the  approval  and  disbursement  of \nfunding, and monitoring the PFIs and the quality and sufficiency of the refinanced subloans).

The MOF will be the executing agency \nfor  the  TA,  which  will  be  implemented  from  January  2020  to  December  2021.46  The  TA  is \nestimated  to  cost  $850,000,  of  which  $800,000  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The government will provide counterpart support \nin  the  form  of  counterpart  staff  remuneration,  office  accommodation  and  supplies,  logistical \nsupport, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n \nA. \n \n30. \nThe benefits of the program considerably outweigh the costs. The program will facilitate \nthe phasing out of a costly and inefficient government-subsidized approach to mortgage market \ndevelopment.  By  intermediating  access  to  long-term  local  currency-denominated  funding,  the \nUMRC  will  stimulate  a  transition  to  market-based  finance  solutions  for  commercially  viable \nsegments  of  the  mortgage  market  and  help  expand  the  banking  sector\u2019s  mortgage  lending \ncapacity  to  address  growing  needs.47  Reforms  under  the  program  will  rationalize  the  current \nhousing subsidy policies and programs to progressively reduce market distortions by introducing \nneeds-based income-linked subsidies, rather than the current interest-linked subsidies. These will \nhave direct economic benefits by (i) reducing the fiscal burden, estimated at 79% of the cost per \nhousing  unit,  and  redirecting  savings  to  other  priority  areas  or  reducing  the  budget  deficit;  (ii) \nestablishing reliable empirical data and detailed analysis to refine targeting and the effectiveness \nof housing subsidy programs; and (iii) improving affordability and facilitating the introduction of \nnew lending instruments tailored to broader income segments (e.g., home improvement loans, \nwhich are currently not available in the market despite strong demand, estimated at 25% of the \nUMRC\u2019s refinancing business), and thereby broadening access to housing finance. \n \n\n                                                \n45 The transaction TA will build on the outputs of (i) knowledge and support TA of $560,000 for the Mortgage Market \nDevelopment Program, which produced the business plan for the UMRC and the road map for regulatory changes \nrequired to ensure market uptake (Technical Assistance Special Fund [TASF 6 and TASF-other sources]); and (ii) \nTA of $500,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, \nto support the operationalization of the UMRC. \n\n46 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n47 About 40,000 mortgage loans were provided in 2018, of which 75% by number and 72% by volume fell under the \nvarious government housing programs; this compares poorly with the estimated annual demand of 145,000 housing \nunits. \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fThe financial viability of the FIL is based on a thorough analysis of market data, a sound \n31. \nunderstanding of the local context drawn from inputs across all key stakeholders, the proposed \nbusiness strategy and model, and lessons from similar companies operating in other countries. \nThe UMRC will require an initial paid-in capital of SUM25 billion, which the government will provide \nto commence operations. Capital is expected to double to SUM50 billion within 12 months once \nthe most active commercial banks in mortgage lending invest in the company. A further increase \nin capital to SUM100 billion has likewise been projected in line with the expected business growth \nand  development  of  the  company.  The  final  shareholding  structure  is  expected  to  be  25% \ngovernment (through the MOF) and 75% commercial banks. \n \n32. \nThe UMRC will operate as a wholesale lending institution dealing with relatively few but \nlarge financial transactions. Operations will initially be funded through credit lines (starting with \nADB\u2019s $150 million loan) and subsequently through corporate bond issuances\u2014sequentially with \nthe growth and progress of the capital markets and as the size of the underlying mortgage loan \nportfolio  grows.  Based  on  the  UMRC\u2019s  business  plan,  the  company  is  projected  to  remain \nprofitable with an average annual growth in profit before tax of 28% during the period of 2020\u2013\n2024 (i.e. its first 5 years of operation). As reflected in the UMRC\u2019s return on assets ratio, which \nis expected to average 1.0% during its first 5 years, the company\u2019s profit margins will remain small \nto maintain competitive lending costs. The UMRC will use its resources efficiently by allocating its \nshareholders\u2019  capital contributions  to  offset  operating  expenses  and maintain  a  solid return  on \nequity ratio of 14% on average during its first 5 years, reflecting fast anticipated growth in volume \nof  refinancing  because  of  strong  demand.  Based  on  the  business  strategy  and  conservative \nestimates (identified in the company business plan, see Supplementary Linked Document 12), \nthe UMRC will begin refinance activities starting with a market share of 15% in the first year of \noperations and increasing to 22% over 5 years.48 In the base-case scenario, the UMRC is forecast \nto  earn  an  after-tax  profit  of  SUM7.4 billion  in  the  first  year  of  operations,  i.e.  2020,  rising  to \nSUM13.2 billion in 2024.49 \n \nB. \n \n33. \nRegulations will be introduced under the program to enhance the supervision and ensure \nthe  sustainability  of  the  UMRC\u2019s  operations  by  facilitating  the  company\u2019s  raising  of  long-term \nfunds (i.e., by allowing institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance companies in \nUzbekistan to invest in highly rated and liquid debt securities, including those issued by wholesale \nlenders),  and  to  align  regulations  for  bond  market  issuances  with  international  standards.50 \nFurther, the HAU will steer the government\u2019s housing subsidy policy framework and programs to \nenable  a  coordinated  and  sustainable  approach.  The  HAU  will  lead  the  consolidation  and \nvalidation  of  housing  sector  data,  establish  a  database  of  beneficiaries,  and  monitor  the \neffectiveness of ongoing government housing programs. Under the second tranche of the PBL, \nthe  HAU  is  expected  to  become  an  independent  housing  agency  with  a  mandate  to  develop, \ncoordinate,  and  manage  all  housing  subsidy  programs  in  Uzbekistan.  It  will  facilitate  a \nfundamental change in the premise of government subsidy programs toward transparent up-front \nsubsidies to low-income households and will help reduce the fiscal burden and re-prioritize public \nexpenditures. To smoothen the transition to market lending rates, the ADB program will support \n\nSustainability \n\n                                                \n48 MRCs typically refinance no more than 25% of total outstanding mortgage loans because of banks\u2019 preference for \ncheaper deposit-based funding, which would suggest about SUM435 billion ($46 million equivalent, as of 11 October \n2019) on the current commercial mortgage outstanding debt. \n\n49 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n50 The UMRC will support capital market development as it begins to issue corporate bonds and more sophisticated \n\nproducts over time, by providing a safe investment channel for institutional investors. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nthe introduction of an income-linked up-front subsidy program to address the affordability stress \ncaused by high interest rates and will support access to commercially priced mortgage products. \n \nC. \n \n34. \nThe  UMRC  will  be  regulated  by  the  CBU  and  will  follow  its  capital  requirements  and \nprudential  regulations.  The  Capital  Market  Development  Agency  will  regulate  the  issuance  of \nsecurities  issued  by  the  UMRC.  The  UMRC  may  follow  different  regulatory  requirements  than \nthose applicable to banks because of its specialized business functions. ADB will conduct integrity \ndue diligence as soon as the UMRC has been incorporated. \n \n35. \nThe UMRC will have a seven-member supervisory board, of which two directors will be \nindependent. All directors of the supervisory board will have to be knowledgeable in the areas of \nbanking, mortgage finance, and/or housing. The company will be staffed with a professional team \nof  10\u201312.  Noncore  functions  such  as  marketing,  research,  and  human  resources  may  be \noutsourced. \n \n36. \nADB  will  review  and  approve  the  financial  and  integrity  due  diligence  of  the  first  three \ncommercial  banks  to  be  included  in  the  program  as  PFIs  to  ascertain  the  UMRC\u2019s  ability  to \nmanage the PFI selection process. ADB will also review the first three loans from the UMRC to \nPFIs. Thereafter, ADB will decide whether the PFI review and selection process can be delegated \nto  the  UMRC  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  Operations  Manual  section  on  financial \nintermediation loans based on (i) ADB's overall assessment of the UMRC\u2019s performance, (ii) the \nUMRC\u2019s PFI appraisal and selection standards, (iii) its loan portfolio quality, (iv) its management \nstrength, (v) the quality of its annual audited project financial statements submitted to ADB, and \n(vi)  its  capacity  to  monitor  the  potential  PFIs\u2019  environmental  and  social  safeguard  screening \nprocedures.51  The  UMRC  will  have  the  ultimate  responsibility  to  verifying  and  assuring  the \neligibility of the subborrowers and their mortgage loans funded by the FIL. \n \n37. \nBased on preliminary due diligence, the overall pre-mitigation financial management risk \nof the program is expected to be high, primarily because the UMRC will have substantial start-up \nrisks as a new entity. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand discussed with the government and the MOF, and will be discussed with the UMRC Board, \nmanagement team and staff, once established, and each PFI, once selected. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in paragraph 67 of the PAM.52 \n \nD. \n \n38. \nThe  program  will  serve  to  lower  borrowing  costs  and  incentivize  PFIs  to  lend  to \nunderserved market segments, further enabling market growth and improving access to housing \nfor  lower-  and  middle-income  households.  Lending  covenants  for  the  project  (FIL)  will  include \neligibility  criteria  for  PFIs  and  their  onlending  operations  to  expand  access  to  commercial \nmortgage finance.53 The SDP program will tackle key market constraints, which make borrowing \nprohibitively  expensive  and  facilitate  the  introduction  of  lending  products  adjusted  to  different \nborrower risk profiles. Broader access to housing finance will contribute to improving the living \n                                                \n51 ADB. 2003. Financial Intermediation Loans. Operations Manual. OM D6.

In  addition,  the  policy \nreforms  introduced  with  the  support  of  the  program  will  have  more  targeted  pro-poor  housing \nassistance initiatives that benefit the low- and informal income-earning population.  \n \n39. \nBased on the independent evaluation of ADB\u2019s first rural housing program (footnote 25), \n22% of the 22,284 beneficiaries of the said program were women.54 At least 30% of the UMRC\u2019s \nfunded  loan  portfolio must  be  provided  to  eligible  women borrowers,  per  ADB\u2019s  requirement.55 \nTherefore, the program will foster increased home ownership among women through the ADB \nFIL  and  the  TA.  The  program  is  classified  as  having  some  gender  elements  under  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines. The loan and project agreements include covenants on labor standards and safety. \n \nE. \n \n40. \nGiven  the  nature  of  the  intervention,  all  three  safeguard  categories  (environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples) are classified C under the PBL and FI-C under \nthe FIL.56 The program is expected to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts and is \nunlikely  to  entail  impacts  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  UMRC\u2019s \nfunding of the PFIs will not finance real estate development or mass housing construction but will \nbe used to refinance loans provided to individuals to purchase new housing units or to acquire \nand/or renovate existing homes. The UMRC will not provide any mortgage loans; it will instead \nrefinance  mortgage  loan  portfolios  of  its  PFIs.  Consequently,  the  UMRC  will  set  up  an \nenvironmental and social management system (ESMS) as part of the PAM. The UMRC ESMS \nwill require it to ensure that PFIs have a screening process as part of their ESMSs\u2014acceptable \nto ADB\u2014in place or will establish one prior to any disbursements.
