The CRP carries out the \ncompliance review phase of the ADB Accountability Mechanism. People who are or may be \ndirectly, materially, and adversely affected by an ADB-assisted project in the course of its \nformulation, processing, or implementation can file a request for compliance review with the \nCRP after going through the consultation phase of the Accountability Mechanism. \n \nThe CRP investigates whether the harm suffered by project-affected people is caused by \nADB\u2019s noncompliance with its operational policies and procedures and recommends remedial \nactions to the Board. It also monitors the implementation of Board-approved remedial actions \nand provides the Board with reports at least annually for a period of 5 years unless otherwise \nspecified. The CRP reports directly to the Board on all activities except clearing its terms of \nreference for a compliance review and reviewing its draft monitoring reports. In these instances \nit reports to the Board Compliance Review Committee, a Board committee of six members. \n \nCurrently, the CRP consists of Mr. Rusdian Lubis (Chair), Mr. Antonio La Vi\u00f1a, and Ms. \nAnne Deruyttere.  \n \nRusdian Lubis is an Indonesian national who has more than 30 years experience in \nenvironmental management. He has worked with government, university, and private firms in \nIndonesia and with the World Bank as a senior executive. He has also been Chairman of the \nBoard of Dana Mitra Lingkungan (Environmental Funds) since 2008 and founded Yayasan \nWaetasi, a nongovernment organization for coastal conservation in Sulawesi, Indonesia, in \n1986. He has a bachelor of science in agricultural economics and a master of science in natural \nresources management and environmental sciences from Bogor Agricultural University and a \ndoctor of philosophy in agricultural and resources economics from Oregon State University in \nthe United States (US). \n \nAntonio La Vi\u00f1a is a Philippine national.

Introduction \n1.  In  December  2004,  the  Compliance  Review  Panel  (CRP)  registered  a  request  for \ncompliance review of the Southern Transport Development Project1 (STDP) in Sri Lanka. The \nrequest was submitted by the Joint Organization of the Affected Communities of the Colombo \nMatara Highway. The CRP determined that the request was eligible and the Board of Directors \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) authorized a compliance review. The CRP reviewed and \ninvestigated the request and submitted its findings and recommendations in a final report to the \nBoard in June 2005 which the Board approved.2  \n2.  The CRP has since then monitored the implementation of the Board-approved remedial \nactions identified in the final report on the investigation and has recorded its observations in \nannual monitoring reports posted on the CRP website.3 This Fourth Annual Monitoring Report \n2009\u20132010 examines progress from 1 March 2009 to 14 May 2010.4 The CRP also obtained \nfeedback from ADB staff at headquarters and in the Sri Lanka Resident Mission5 and from \nSTDP-affected persons6 during a monitoring mission in Sri Lanka from 19 to 24 April 2010.7  \n3.  In accordance with paragraph 48 of CRP operating procedures, a draft of this fourth \nmonitoring report was submitted to the Board Compliance Review Committee on 3 June 2010.  \nII.  Description of the Project \nA.  Scope \n4.  The original STDP loan had two components: the southern highway component and the \nroad  safety  component.  The  highway  component  consisted  of  the  construction  of  a  new \nhighway linking Colombo with Galle, the capital of the Southern Province of Sri Lanka, and \nMatara while the road safety component addressed Sri Lanka's serious road traffic accident \nsituation. The highway will be about 126 kilometers (km) long, and a 5.6 km Galle access road \nwill also be constructed. STDP also supports policy and institutional reform in its two-fold \nprimary objective: to spur economic development in the southern region and to significantly \nreduce the high rate of road accidents. The secondary objective is poverty reduction.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1999. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Southern Transport Development Project. Manila. (Loan 1711\u2013\nSRI[SF]). \n2   The recommendations are included in Appendix 1 taken from paragraphs 267 and 268 of the CRP final report on \nthe investigation.  \n3  The  reports  and  other  related  information  on  the  STDP  request  are  at \nhttp://www.compliance.adb.org/dir0035p.nsf/alldocs/BDAO-7XVBSH?OpenDocument. \n4  The delay in issuing the Third Annual Monitoring Report in 2009 moved monitoring work for the fourth report to \n2010. \n5  The South Asia Department of ADB delegated the administration of STDP to the resident mission. \n6  The CRP monitoring mission included a 2-day field visit to the project area where the CRP met government \nofficials, project consultants, and STDP-affected persons.  \n7  The mission was led by CRP Chair Rusdian Lubis with CRP part-time member Anne Deruyttere; Teresita Capati, \nCompliance Coordination Officer; and Josefina Miranda, Senior Compliance Program Assistant from the Office of \nthe Compliance Review Panel. In meeting the affected persons, the CRP was assisted by an interpreter, Mr. \nDunstan Fernando. ", "2   \n5.  Based on a request of the Government of Sri Lanka, an ADB supplementary loan of $90 \nmillion for the highway component was approved by the Board in March 20088 to finance (i) cost \noverruns  for  restructuring  construction  from  Kurundugahahetekma  to  the  Pinnaduwa \ninterchange to complete the two-lane highway, for expanding the carriageway to a four-lane \nhighway, and for completing the Galle access road; (ii) consultancy services for construction \nsupervision and project management; and (iii) the purchase of road safety equipment. The \nsupplementary loan excluded the last 30 km from the Pinnaduwa interchange to Godagama \nwhich was also excluded from the original loan through the restructuring of the civil works \ncontract. The government is now responsible for funding the completion of this section. \nB.  Agencies and Financing \n6.  The original STDP was funded by ADB, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation,9 \nthe Government of Sri Lanka, the Nordic Development Fund, and the Swedish International \nDevelopment Cooperation Agency. The total cost of the restructured STDP was estimated at \n$448 million with ADB financing $180 million and the rest shared by the Japan International \nCooperation Agency (JICA) and the government. JICA is financing 66.6 km from Kotawa to \nKurundugahahetekma in the northern part while ADB is financing 35.2 km including the 5.6 km \nGalle  access  road.  While  the  southernmost  portion  from  the  Pinnaduwa  interchange  to \nGodagama was originally to be funded by the government, it will now be financed by the Export \nand Import Bank of China. Cabinet approval has already been obtained to award a civil works \ncontract to the China National Technical Import and Export Corporation. It is expected that \nconstruction on this portion will start by the third quarter of 2010.     \n7.  The highway component is implemented by the Road Development Authority (RDA) with \nthe Ministry of Highways and Road Development as the executing agency. \nC.  Status of the Project \n8.  The Board approved the ADB loan for the project in November 1999 with an expected \ncompletion date of 31 December 2005. The loan agreement (between ADB and the Democratic \nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka as borrower) and the project agreement (between ADB and the \nRDA) were signed in December 1999. The ADB loan was declared effective in October 2002 \nfollowing delays in complying with loan effectiveness conditions, particularly the submission of a \nsatisfactory resettlement implementation plan (RIP). All cofinancing agreements are in place.  \n9.  STDP has suffered cost overruns, especially due to increased costs for civil works. \nSeveral factors have contributed to this increase including (i) price escalation due to delays, (ii) \nundetermined geo-technical and soil conditions, and (iii) an increase in value-added tax. In \naddition, the delay in bringing the project into compliance has increased the cost of consulting \nservices, mainly because of the additional time required to supervise construction. The STDP \nsupplementary loan approved in March 2008 aims to cover the cost overruns, the Galle access \nroad, and the change in scope for a four-lane highway from Kurundugahahetekma to the \nPinnaduwa interchange. The closing date for STDP has been extended to 31 December 2010. \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Supplementary \nLoan and Technical Assistance Grant to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Southern Transport \nDevelopment Project. Manila. (Loan 2413\u2013SRI). \n9  The Japan International Cooperation Agency and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation merged in October \n2008, and after the merger JICA assumed responsibility for funding STDP. Therefore, this report will use JICA as \nthe cofinancier. ", "    3 \n10.  As of 14 March 2010, $94.6 million of the original ADB loan and $40.4 million of the \nsupplementary  loan  had  been  disbursed.  The  restructured  civil  works  were  at  least  98% \ncomplete.  \n11.  The JICA section has two contract packages: Package 1 for a four-lane highway close to \nColombo was awarded in August 2005, and package 2 was restructured to a four-lane highway \nin 2008. As of 15 April 2010, progress on the JICA packages was 65% for package 1 and 30% \nfor package 2. These two contracts are now scheduled to be completed by April 2011.   \nIII.  Request, Panel Investigation, and Board Decision \n12.  The requesters filed a request for compliance review in December 2004. They claimed \nthat the harm they suffered or would suffer as a result of noncompliance with ADB operational \npolicies  and  procedures  would  include  loss  of  homes,  loss  of  livelihoods,  damage  to  the \nenvironment, degradation of wetlands, dispersion of integrated communities, damage to five \ntemples, the negative effects of resettlement, and human rights violations. \n13.  The requesters specifically stated that the sections of the ADB Operations Manual that \nwere and would be violated and thus cause them harm were those on environment, involuntary \nresettlement,  incorporating  social  dimensions  in  ADB  operations,  governance,  economic \nanalysis,  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation,  gender  and  development  in  ADB  operations, \nprocessing loan proposals, and formulating and implementing loan covenants. \n14.  The requesters sought remediation from ADB including the following: \n(i)  full compensation for resettlement; \n(ii)  a gender analysis; \n(iii)  reconsideration of the best alignment for the road trace in order to minimize the \nnumber of persons to be resettled; \n(iv)  an initial social assessment for the final trace; \n(v)  provision of adequate land for replacement; \n(vi)  completion of an environmental impact assessment for the final trace; \n(vii)  full consultation with affected people after completion of the new assessment; \nand \n(viii)  as first steps, suspension of disbursements under the loan and a full investigation \nof the highway by an independent committee. \n \n15.  The CRP's investigation was carried out from January to June 2005. In July 2005, the \nBoard deliberated and approved the final CRP report including the panel's recommendations \n(see Appendix 1). \nIV.  Progress in Achieving the Course of Action \n16.  The  CRP\u2019s  final  report  on  the  investigation  specified  two  categories  of \nrecommendations. The first was four general recommendations with a scope broader than the \nproject  itself.  The  second  listed  15  specific  recommendations  to  bring  the  project  into \ncompliance.   \n17.  In the third monitoring report (15 May 2009), the CRP considered that 15 of the 19 \nrecommendations were in compliance, 2 had been partially met, 1 could no longer be met, and \n1 had not yet been met. In this fourth report, the CRP focused on those four recommendations. \n ", "4   \nThe findings are that one recommendation has been met; two have partially been met; and one \ncould indeed no longer be met as stated in the third report. This status is reflected in the last \ncolumn of the updated course of action in Appendix 2. Unless otherwise specified, the cut-off \ndate for information considered in this report is 14 May 2010. The findings and assessments \nregarding the four remaining recommendations are summarized below. \nV.  Findings and Assessment \n18.  General Recommendation 3: Management should develop additional guidance for \nthe ADB Handbook for Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice dated 1998 for staff to \ndevelop major infrastructure projects with borrowers with little or no comparable project \nexperience, especially in Category A projects. The guidance should particularly address \nthe  issues  of  implementing  agencies  having  adequate  institutional  capacity  and \nresources in carrying out and monitoring resettlement and ensuring that appropriate \nlegislation is in place to carry out such resettlement.   \n19.  During previous CRP monitoring exercises, Management explained that the preparation \nof a new resettlement handbook was contingent on the revision of the ADB safeguard policy \nstatement. On 14 May 2010, ADB reported that following the adoption of the statement in July \n2009, extensive internal consultations on revising guidelines were held to ensure consistency. \nADB plans to complete the update and release a revised resettlement handbook in the last \nquarter of 2010 after which it will be updated periodically. The safeguard policy statement \nincludes provisions for incorporating capacity strengthening components into project design and \nfor helping borrowers to ensure that resettlement plans adequately address all involuntary \nresettlement issues and the availability of sufficient funds. ADB also reported that it is providing \nadditional resources including funding for technical assistance to support the strengthening of \ndeveloping member country safeguard systems including legal frameworks for resettlement.   \n20.  Based on the progress reported by ADB and the specific timetable for completion of the \nrevised resettlement handbook, the CRP concludes that general recommendation 3 has been \npartially met. When the revised handbook is released, this recommendation may be considered \nto be in compliance.  \n21.  Specific Recommendation 5: Management should require that all affected persons \nbe fully compensated by actual payment before they are moved. \n22.  In the Second Annual Monitoring Report, the CRP concluded that Management had not \ncomplied with this recommendation as all attempts to achieve compliance had been superseded \nby events. However, the CRP indicated its intention to monitor (i) delays in issuing new title \ndeeds to people relocated to resettlement sites; (ii) compensation for land plots without houses; \nand (iii) the likelihood that additional property would have to be acquired. In the Third Annual \nMonitoring Report, the CRP concluded that significant progress had been made on resettlement \nand  compensation  including  issuing  title  deeds,  mitigating  and  compensating  construction-\nrelated impacts from blasting and dust, safety measures, and conflict resolution. Nonetheless, \nthe CRP expressed concerns regarding (i) the potential need for further land acquisition; (ii) \ndelays in the construction of the southernmost 30 km of the highway and at the interchanges \nand the potential impact on resettlement; and (iii) other measures to offset prolonged disruption \nof the livelihoods of families as a result of project delays.   \n23.  Compensation for land acquisition. The implementation progress reports of 25 May \nand 30 September 2009 and 31 March 2010 show that Management has continually monitored ", "    5 \nprogress on the implementation of the original RIP and its addendums. Minutes of the monthly \nSTDP coordination committee meetings indicate that progress and problems regarding land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  were  reported  and  discussed.  According  to  Management\u2019s \nconsultant\u2019s report of 5 April 2010, as of February 2010, only 14 of the 10,273 lots acquired still \nneeded to be compensated (compared to 449 plots in the previous monitoring mission). Those \n14 outstanding payments involved very small amounts which some affected persons either had \nnot collected or could not be issued because of missing information on land ownership, in which \ncase the RDA had deposited corresponding amounts with the courts.  \n24.  Additional land acquisition was necessary to accommodate slopes; to improve drainage; \nto provide alternative access to inaccessible settlements; and to acquire uneconomic, small land \nparcels left after previous acquisitions. As of March 2010, additional land acquisition consisted \nof 2,729 parcels of which 844 had been fully compensated. The remaining payments are \nexpected to be made by the end of September 2010. According to the resident mission and the \nRDA, no significant additional land acquisition is anticipated for the final 30-km section.    \n25.  Resettlement and title deeds. During this monitoring period, the CRP noted10 that \ncompensation had been finalized for all of the 1,338 resettled households including 21 families \nthat had to resettle because of additional land acquisition. Of the 530 families who resettled in \nthe 32 RDA resettlement sites, however, 75 had not been issued title deeds due to outstanding \npayment dues for issuance of title deeds and to procedural delays in the acquisition by the RDA \nof 7 of the resettlement sites. Management requested project staff to prepare a list of all affected \nhouseholds  with  outstanding  compensation  issues;  the  staff  is  taking  necessary  steps  to \ncomplete titling. In all the resettlement sites services (i.e., paved roads, electricity, water, and \ndrainage)  have  been  provided,  and  the  responsibility  for the  sites  has  now  been  officially \ntransferred to the local authorities. The RDA does not anticipate any additional resettlement due \nto construction of the final 30-km section. \n26.  Temporary  construction-related  impacts  including  dust,  noise,  and  structural \ndamage. Houses that would likely suffer damage due to blasting and vibration were assessed \nbefore blasting started and were to be reassessed afterwards to determine compensation. \nReassessing structural damage has commenced as the blasting is complete. It is expected that \ncompensation for structural damage and for dust, noise, and other direct construction-related \nimpacts  will  be  completed  before  the  end  of  the  project.  According  to  Management\u2019s \nconsultant\u2018s report, as of February 2010, 721 of the 781 complaints received had been resolved \nby grievance redress committees (GRCs).  \n27.  Grievance  redress  committees.11  GRCs  were  established  to  find  solutions  to \ncomplaints and disputes related to land acquisition and resettlement. All parties involved can file \ncomplaints. In all, 22 GRCs have been created by the RDA and are operating in all the districts \naffected by the highway though some issues remain such as the implementation of GRC \ndecisions by contractors, vague procedures, and their legal status.12 Nevertheless, the CRP is \npleased to note that several parties involved have commented that the GRCs have proven to be \n                                                 \n10 STDP status reports on issuing title deeds and additional land acquisition dated April 2010 provided during the \nCRP monitoring mission in Sri Lanka.  \n11 GRCs are chaired by the additional district secretary and include the STDP project manager, local authorities, high-\nranking persons in the area, the Samatha Mandalaya chairman, a representative of a respected nongovernment \norganization in the area and its (non-voting) chair, and the social impact monitoring office of STDP. Other \nspecialists may be invited as needed. Gender is an important consideration in the composition of the GRCs. (STDP \nstatus report of April 2010.)    \n12 Egis Bceom International report to Management on 5 April 2010. \n ", "6   \nan effective mechanism for problem solving. In fact, by the end of February 2010, the GRCs had \nresolved 850 problems considerably reducing the caseload for STDP, the contractors, and the \nlocal courts. \n \nCRP meets with the Sri Lanka Resident Mission staff \n28.  The CRP acknowledges that the resident mission plans to continue monitoring progress \non the implementation of the RIP and its addendums including compensation for additional land \nacquisition, issuing compensation certificates and title deeds, and compensation for direct, \nconstruction-related impacts. This will include monitoring the final 30-km section of the highway. \nThe RDA reports on progress with compensation on a quarterly basis. It is important to note that \nthe resident mission has hired a communication specialist as part of the Small Scale Capacity \nDevelopment Technical Assistance Project on Strengthening Road Development Authority in \nImplementation of the Environmental Management Plan of the Southern Transport Development \nProject.13 The specialist has designed informative leaflets and brochures for persons affected by \nadditional land acquisition. \n29.  Conclusion.  The  CRP  recognizes  that  with  the  exception  of  relatively  small \ncompensation payments for additional land acquisition and direct, construction-related impacts, \nalmost all resettlement and compensation issues have been resolved in the JICA and ADB \nsections and that both the RDA and the resident mission are committed to ensuring compliance \nwith the RIP for the last 30-km section. While the original recommendation can no longer be \ncomplied with due to the current advanced stage of land acquisition, given the assurances by \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2009. Small Scale Capacity Development Technical Assistance Project on Strengthening Road Development \nAuthority in Implementation of the Environmental Management Plan of the Southern Transport Development \nProject. Manila. (S-CDTA-7239\u2013SRI).  ", "    7 \nManagement that it will monitor remaining compensation issues, no further monitoring by the \nCRP of the implementation of the RIP and land acquisition is required.  \n30.  Specific Recommendation 7: Management should assist in the income restoration \nprogram  and  the  establishment  of  household  benchmarks  through  the  management \ninformation system for affected persons as called for in the resettlement implementation \nplan. \n31.  In the Third Annual Monitoring Report, the CRP expressed concerns regarding (i) the \nreduction in scope of the livelihood restoration component from the original 1,050 affected \nhouseholds14 to 22 households, (ii) the use of benchmark data collected under the management \ninformation system (MIS), and (iii) the resident mission\u2019s role in facilitating using the results of \nthe land-use study in the income restoration program (IRP). The CRP considered that ADB \ncontinued to be in partial compliance with this recommendation and urged, \u201c\u2026Management to \ncarefully review the reduction in scope under the revised IRP, to closely monitor and facilitate \nland-use planning along the highway and its interchanges, and to ensure that the MIS is fully \noperational...\u201d CRP considered that compliance would be achieved when (i) the review of the \nIRP showed that all affected persons needing income support were included in the revised IRP; \n(ii)  ADB  closely  monitored  and  facilitated  land-use  planning  along  the  highway  and  its \ninterchanges; and (ii) the MIS was fully operational. \n32.  Income restoration program.15 In addition to its ongoing efforts to monitor progress on \nimplementing the IRP through RDA monthly progress reports, the resident mission contracted a \nsocial development specialist to review the revised IRP including the process for selecting \nhouseholds to be included in the livelihood restoration component. The study did not, however, \naddress CRP concerns about reducing the scope of the IRP from 1,050 households to 22; \nrather, the report16 provided only a chronological overview of the IRP and did not attempt to \nreview the soundness of the methodologies used to define household eligibility. The consultant \ninstead recommended that an analysis of data on 940 households be undertaken by the RDA.  \n33.  The independent external monitor17 (IEM) reported that of the 22 eligible households, \nonly 10 had actually received support under the livelihood restoration component. The rest had \nmoved out of the area, had restored their pre-project livelihoods on their own, or were no longer \ninterested in participating in the program. The participating households received customized \nassistance including support from the Industrial Development Board, facilitation of employment, \ntraining, and social welfare assistance. According to project staff, only 2 of the 22 households \nneed further assistance. The IEM also reported that in a sample of 17 of the 62 households in \nthe ADB section that had previously had commercial properties and had resettled themselves, \n60% had re-established their business (up from 30% in 2006) while 40% had not. The IEM \nreport further indicated that several affected households were poverty stricken, especially those \nheaded  by  females,  and  that  there  were  many  complaints  about  further  deterioration  in \nlivelihoods due to prolonged construction delays. \n                                                 \n14The 1,050 affected households selected by Sarvodaya Economic Enterprise Development Services (Gte) Ltd, a \nnongovernment organization initially contracted after transferring the implementation of the IRP to the RDA, was \nrevised downwards to only 22 families needing further assistance in the JICA section.  \n15 The income restoration program consists of (i) livelihood restoration; (ii) home gardening programs; and (iii) \nstrengthening housing societies. \n16 ADB.  2009.

During the field visit, the CRP noted that affected persons recovered economically in \ndifferent ways. Some were highly successful in setting up new businesses while others were still \nstruggling to regain their livelihoods. In general, improvements were noted compared with the \nprevious monitoring mission; however, several households, some of which had been visited \nduring the previous field visit, continued to be in precarious positions and had been clearly \nimpoverished after resettlement even though minor improvements in their unfinished houses \nwere observed. The CRP also observed that the home gardening program for some of the \npoorest  households  provided  critical  subsistence  support.  Of  particular  concern  was  the \nsituation of households that were already poor before resettling and whose situation further \ndeteriorated as a result of resettlement. These households were not among the 22 selected for \nthe  IRP.  Nevertheless,  while  many  households  had  not  yet  recovered  their  pre-project \nlivelihoods, most seemed to have managed on their own making further support unnecessary. \n35.  Based on these findings and on available reports, the CRP suggests that ADB should \nsupport the RDA in identifying households in precarious situations that are still in need of \nsupport for income restoration. Data from the IEM survey, the MIS, and information contained in \nindividual files in the regional STDP offices could be used for this purpose.  \n36.  Land use planning. The CRP acknowledges the resident mission\u2019s active support18 of \nthe  Urban  Development  Authority  (UDA)  for  the  preparation  of  land-use  plans  along  the \nhighway, especially for the interchanges and access roads. The preparation of the plans was \njust getting underway during the previous monitoring mission, but now they are complete and \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2009.

", "    9 \nseem to be of high quality and include detailed plans for some of the 11 interchanges.19 The \nstudies included broad consultations and took into consideration the development needs of the \nlocal population. While specific IRPs supported by the RDA are phasing out, these land-use \nplans could facilitate economic opportunities for the local population including many affected \npersons.  The  resident  mission  provides  the  CRP  with  the  monthly  reports  of  the  project \ncoordinating committee as evidence of its continuing role in facilitating coordination between the \nRDA and the UDA, and the CRP is convinced that the mission has played this role successfully. \nThe  CRP  acknowledges  the  mission\u2019s  intention  to  keep  monitoring  progress  on  the \nimplementation of the land-use plans including the inter-institutional coordination necessary for \nsuccess. \n \nCRP meets with staff of the Road Development Authority and the Urban Development Authority  \n \n37.  Management  information  system.  The  CRP  noted  that  ADB  has  continuously \nsupported the RDA in establishing a database on land acquisition and resettlement. During the \nmission, the CRP observed the operation of the MIS. It now includes data on all acquired plots \nand on all affected persons, but information regarding pre-project income levels is available for \nonly some households. While the form and content of the database can be improved, it is a \ngood basis for monitoring progress on land acquisition and resettlement and could easily be \nexpanded to record baseline socioeconomic information and to monitor progress on income \nrestoration. The RDA intends to use a similar database for future road projects. The CRP is \npleased to note that the resident mission intends to monitor the improvement of the database to \nensure that it is user friendly, that it provides easy access to consolidated information, and that it \nexpands to include socioeconomic data. In fact, the reports of the IEM drew on data from the \nMIS.  It  is  therefore  not  only  a  necessary  tool  for  the  day-to-day  implementation  of  land \nacquisition, resettlement, and the IRP, it is also a source of data to assist the Environment and \nSocial Division (ESD) of the RDA in its monitoring and evaluation activities.  \n                                                 \n19 Egis bceom International, 6 volumes (August 2009). \n ", "10   \n38.  Conclusion.  The  CRP  considers  that  significant  progress  has  been  achieved  in \nimproving the MIS and is confident that it will be fully operational in the short term. The CRP is \nalso  convinced  that  the  resident  mission  will  continue  to  perform  its  role  in  facilitating \ncoordination between the RDA and the UDA to use the results of the land-use study in the IRP. \nRegarding  the  IRP,  the  CRP  acknowledges  that  while  many  households  have  not  fully \nrecovered their livelihoods, further support would no longer be effective as they are recovering \non their own. However, the CRP remains concerned about several cases of very poor, resettled \nfamilies who have not recovered. Based on the unsatisfactory review of the reduction in the \nscope of the IRP and on continued concerns that some of the poorest households have not \nrecovered  their  livelihoods,  the  CRP  considers  that  recommendation  7  is  still  in  partial \ncompliance. In order to achieve full compliance, the CRP recommends that ADB work closely \nwith the RDA to identify poor households that have not been covered by the revised IRP, \ndocumenting the process and the results, and to provide them with the support necessary to at \na minimum re-establish their pre-project livelihoods. \n39.  Specific  Recommendation  9:  Management  should  help  establish  well-staffed \nmonitoring of resettlement activities by an independent institution, forwarding concerns \nto the RDA for urgent action from affected persons. \n40.  In the Third Annual Monitoring Report, the CRP found that creating the ESD to oversee \nthe  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  at  the  RDA  was  a  positive  development20  though \nManagement still needs to address the further development and integration of the project\u2019s \nvarious monitoring and evaluation systems. The CRP continued to find only partial compliance \nwith  this  recommendation  though  compliance  will  be  achieved  when  the  ESD  is  fully \noperational.  \n41.  During this monitoring period, the CRP was pleased to see that ADB had provided \nsupport  for  strengthening  the  ESD  in  the  Small  Scale  Capacity  Development  Technical \nAssistance Project on Strengthening Road Development Authority in Implementation of the \nEnvironmental  Management  Plan  of  the  Southern  Transport  Development  Project.  The \nconsultants with this project are providing training for staff and are supporting the ESD in \nmonitoring  the  implementation  of  the  project\u2019s  environmental  management  plan  and  the \ndevelopment impacts as described in the design and monitoring framework. The CRP also took \nnote that the staffing and capacity of the ESD have improved since the previous monitoring \nmission and that the division currently has 22 staff members. The ESD reviewed the monthly \nenvironmental report submitted by the construction supervision consultant prior to submitting it \nto the Central Environmental Authority. In addition to reviewing safeguard policy documents, the \nESD is now capable of preparing them. In fact, with support from consultants, the ESD has \nprepared the last two project performance and monitoring system reports for use by ADB and \nJICA. Also, the Central Environmental Authority noted it was pleased to have the ESD as a \ncounterpart within the RDA. In addition to providing the project performance and monitoring \nsystem reports to the RDA, ADB, and JICA, the ESD will also monitor future World Bank and \nJICA road projects. The CRP was also informed that the ESD is now participating in project \ncoordination committee meetings.   \n42.  Conclusion.  The  CRP  concludes  that  despite  some  shortcomings,  the  ESD  has \ndeveloped its ability as an independent unit within the RDA to monitor the environmental and \n                                                 \n20In line with the policy of the Ministry of Highways and Road Development of the Government of Sri Lanka to \nmainstream environmental and social safeguard compliance in all its operations, the Environmental and Social \nDivision has been established in Road Development Authority. ", "    11 \nsocial aspects of STDP. The CRP is of the opinion that the ESD still needs further institutional \nsupport and capacity building in areas such as database management, communication skills, \nand  awareness  building  on  safeguard  matters.  In  addition,  since  the  ESD  deals  with \nenvironmental safeguard compliance, it must maintain independence in its operations and avoid \nall potential conflicts of interest. Despite these remaining challenges, the CRP is pleased to see \nsignificant progress and concludes that this recommendation is in compliance. \nVI.  Other Matters \n43.  In the Third Annual Monitoring Report, the CRP indicated two major issues that were to \nbe addressed promptly and adequately, i.e., delays related to the southernmost 30-km section \nof  the  highway  and  the  problem  of  flooding,  as  both  issues  are  related  to  CRP \nrecommendations.  \n44.  Regarding the delay in obtaining financing for the last section of the highway, the CRP \nwas informed21 that a new financier, the Export and Import Bank of China, has been identified \nand that negotiations are at an advanced stage. Cabinet approval has been obtained to award \nthe civil works contract to M/S China Technical Import and Export Corporation, and pending \napproval by Parliament, construction is expected to start in the third quarter of 2010. Although \nno longer financing this section, ADB continues to be responsible for ensuring compliance with \nits environment and social safeguard policies.22 On 14 September 2009, ADB wrote to the \ngovernment highlighting the importance of adopting ADB safeguard measures for the last 30 km \nof STDP.23 During the field monitoring mission in April 2010, the CRP was pleased to receive \nassurances from the government and the resident mission that the ADB safeguard policy would \nbe followed in the last 30 km and that the implementation of the environmental management \nplan for the entire trace would be included as part of the conditions in the contract for the final \nsection.  \n45.  In the third monitoring report, the CRP was concerned about the flooding that continued \nto be a significant issue for affected persons. The resident mission reported that one of the \nsocial measures undertaken in the Kahatuduwa area (JICA package 1 section) was extensive \nflood mitigation work that was now almost complete. During the April 2010 field visit, the CRP \nobserved that remedial measures had been implemented by redesigning some structures to \naccommodate the flow of a larger volume of floodwater and that work on the canals and canal \ndredging was in progress. The CRP understands that in certain areas of the flood plain, flooding \nis  inevitable.  While  the  issue  of  flooding  is  only  indirectly  related  to  the  Board\u2013approved \nrecommendations, it is particularly significant for affected persons, some of whom resettled in \nflood-prone areas. As demonstrated by the remedial work on drainage and canals systems, \nADB has clearly been proactive on this issue. While JICA is providing the resources for remedial \naction, the CRP urges ADB to work closely with its counterpart to continue to give the flooding \nissue high priority. \n                                                 \n21The resident mission\u2019s draft Aide Memoire of the review mission of 30 March to 8 April 2010, para 7. \n22Schedule 6 of the loan agreement on STDP states that \"The Borrower shall ensure that all environmental mitigation \nmeasures  identified  in  the  Summary  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  and  the  approval  of  the  Central \nEnvironment Authority of the Borrower are incorporated in the design, and followed during the construction, \noperation and maintenance of the Project.\" \n23Management\u2019s implementation progress report of 30 September 2009.  \n ", "12   \n \nFlood mitigation measure at the JICA section \nVII.  Conclusions \n46.  The CRP concludes in this Fourth Annual Monitoring Report for STDP that considerable \nprogress has been made in implementing the recommendations formulated in 2005. The CRP \nacknowledges the efforts of ADB (and of the borrower) to bring STDP into full compliance. Of \nthe original 19 recommendations, there are only 2 that are still outstanding, namely general \nrecommendation 3 and specific recommendation 7, both of which are in partial compliance.   \n47.  Regarding general recommendation 3 on the preparation of the resettlement handbook, \nwhile  not  yet  satisfied,  the  CRP  took  note  of  the  timeline  Management  provided  for  the \ncompletion of the handbook and related initiatives during the last quarter of 2010. Therefore, the \nCRP concludes that this recommendation is in partial compliance.  \n48.  Regarding  specific  recommendation  7  on  the  IRP,  the  CRP  acknowledges  that \nManagement has taken action to respond to the recommendation in the Third Annual Monitoring \nReport; however, the CRP remains concerned about affected households that were previously \npoor and were further impoverished as a result of resettlement and also about the fact that the \nreview by the resident mission required in the third report did not supply a justification for the \nreduction in the scope of the IRP. Therefore, the CRP considers that recommendation 7 is still \nin partial compliance. In order to achieve full compliance, ADB should work closely with the RDA \nto identify poor households not covered by the revised IRP and, if necessary, to provide them \nwith enough support to at a minimum re-establish their pre-project livelihoods. \n49.  As reported in the second monitoring report, specific recommendation 5 could no longer \nbe  complied  with  because  construction  work  had  already  started  before  affected  persons \nreceived compensation. Despite this fact, the CRP indicated it would continue to monitor the \nimplementation of land acquisition and resettlement and notes that with the exception of small \ncompensation payments for direct, construction-related impacts, almost all resettlement and ", "    13 \ncompensation issues have been resolved in the JICA and ADB sections and that both the RDA \nand  the  resident  mission  are  committed  to  ensuring  compliance  with  the  ADB  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  for  the  last  30  km  of  the  highway.  Therefore,  while  the  original \nrecommendation can no longer be complied with given the advanced stage of completion of the \nland acquisition and resettlement plan, the issues pertinent to this recommendation require no \nfurther CRP monitoring. \n50.  In summary, while the scope and depth of ADB's non-compliance with ADB policies \nreported in its 2005 compliance review report was very significant, during the past 4 years \nsignificant progress in implementing the course of action on the recommendations has been \nmade. \nVIII.  Next Step \n51.  The CRP, after consultation with the Board Compliance Review Committee, will provide \nthe Board with its fifth and final annual monitoring report in December 2010.  \n \n \n/S/ Rusdian Lubis \nChair \nCompliance Review CRP \n01 July 2010 \n \n \n \n ", "14 Appendix 1 \nCompliance Review Panel Recommendations  \n(extracted from the CRP's Final Report on the Southern Transport Development Project \ncompliance review request)  \n \n266.  The CRP has 2 categories of recommendations resulting from its investigation in this \nProject\u2014measures addressing issues that may cause difficulties in complying with ADB policies \nand  operational  procedures  in  ADB-assisted  projects,  and  measures  relevant  to  current \nimplementation problems necessary to bring the project back into compliance. \n267.  On the first category, the Board asks that Management take the following measures:  \n(i)  review  selected  road  projects  as  to  how  changes  of  scope  may  make  the \napplication of environment and resettlement policies difficult; \n \n(ii)  review  cofinancing  arrangements  in  selected  projects  to  determine  if  such \narrangements have a damaging effect on policy compliance for the whole project, \nand make recommendations to strengthen policy compliance for these projects; \n \n \n(iii)  develop additional guidance for the ADB Handbook for Resettlement: A Guide to \nGood Practice dated 1998 for staff to develop major infrastructure projects with \nborrowers with little or no comparable project experience, especially in Category \nA projects.
