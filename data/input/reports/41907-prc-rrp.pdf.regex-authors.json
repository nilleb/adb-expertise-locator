I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed \nEnergy Efficiency Multi-project Financing Program (the Program) for the issue of partial credit \nguarantees (PCGs) by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to selected financial institutions (the \nPartner Banks) in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) to cover a portion of the principal \npayments due to these banks under loans to energy efficiency projects, up to an aggregate \namount of CNY800 million.  \n \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Energy Efficiency in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n1.  Recent Trends  \n \n2.  Energy demand in the PRC, the world\u2019s second-largest energy consumer and one of its \nlargest emitters of greenhouse gases (GHGs), is growing rapidly to support the economic \ngrowth needed to raise the living standards of the large population. Between 1980 and 2000, \nPRC achieved a quadrupling of its gross domestic product (GDP) with only a doubling of energy \nconsumption,  effectively  decoupling  the  relationship  between  economic  growth  and  energy \nconsumption.  However,  during  PRC\u2019s  transition  to  a  market-based  economy,  many  of  the \ncountry\u2019s energy efficiency programs were dismantled between 2001 and 2005. Since 2001, \naccordingly, energy use has outpaced economic growth, with elasticity reaching 1.6 in 2004. \nThe growth in energy consumption moderated to some extent in 2005 but averaged a high 9.5% \nyearly in 2000\u20132005, only slightly lower than GDP growth, resulting in elasticity of just under 1, \nversus the 0.4\u20130.5 in 1980\u20132000. Continuation of this 1:1 ratio of energy consumption to GDP, \ngiven the PRC\u2019s stated goal of again quadrupling GDP in 2000\u20132020, will lead to significant \ndemand for energy, most of it coal-based; 82% of electricity is now produced by burning coal. \nThe resulting local, national, and global environmental impact could be substantial. \n \n3.  The  current  energy  path  is  neither  environmentally  nor  economically  sustainable. \nIncreasing the efficiency of energy use, to wring more service value from each primary energy \nunit consumed, has large environmental and economic benefit. Energy efficiency is essential, to \nreduce  global  emissions  of  GHGs,  ease  growth  in  fossil  energy  demand  and  the  upward \npressure  on  energy  prices,  and  improve  energy  security.  Investments  in  energy  efficiency \ntechnologies in the rapidly growing economies are required, to prevent being locked into an \nenergy-intensive capital stock in the future. The benefits of energy efficiency are described in \nAppendix 2.  \n  2.  Demand-Side Efficiency Potential \n \n4.  Energy efficiency means delivering services with less primary energy. Energy efficiency \nprojects are defined as economic investments in energy equipment and infrastructure that \ndeliver higher useful energy outputs or services. Reducing energy use creates a compounded \nefficiency increase throughout the energy value chain. This is evident in the case of electricity, \nwhere overall network and system losses and inefficiencies, from production to end-use, 100 \nunits of input energy to only 9.5 units of actual energy service at the point of end use. As such, a \nsmall increase in demand-side efficiency will reverse the compounding losses. It results in both \nlower  energy  consumption  and  reduced  emissions  of  GHGs.  The  technical  and  economic \n ", "2   \n \npotential exists to save 20\u201340% of energy use, with cost-effective investments in a broad range \nof applications, such as in motors, which account for about 50% of power use, heating and air-\nconditioning, controls, water supply, lighting, and efficient combustion systems. \n \n5.  Improvements in demand-side efficiency are required across all sectors\u2014commercial, \nindustrial, governmental, agricultural, residential, and transport. In addition, specific electricity \nconsumption in the products is much higher in the PRC compared with international standards. \nTo achieve its economic and environmental target, the PRC needs to attract a huge investment \nin energy efficiency technologies and practices. The Energy Research Institute of the National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission estimates the investment needs by 2010 to be at least \n$120\u2013$160 billion.  \n \n3.  Policies and Regulations \n \n6.  Improving energy efficiency has been a cornerstone of the PRC\u2019s energy policy for \n20 years. In the 1980s, the Government employed a monitoring and quota mechanism through \nthe planned economy to promote energy conservation and curtail at least the most blatant \ncases of energy waste. As recently as the 1990s the number of energy efficiency projects that \nreceived funding was determined by a top-down approach that largely depended on state \nsubsidies. State-owned banks were instructed to finance projects selected by the Government.  \n \n7.  When the PRC began its transition toward a market economy, however, the Government \nmade  significant  changes  that  affected  energy  efficiency.  It  reformed  the  banking  sector, \nliberalized energy prices, and phased out subsidies for energy efficiency projects. \n \n8.  Faced with the recent energy intensity increase since 2001, the Government recognizes \nthe urgency to invest in and significantly improve energy efficiency. From its previous emphasis \non  energy  exploitation,  the  national  energy  policy  now  assigns  top  priority  to  energy \nconservation and energy efficiency. Expanding investment in energy efficiency projects, among \nothers, is a high priority for environmental sustainability and enterprise competitiveness. The \nGovernment seeks to promote market-based methods to deliver and finance energy efficiency \nprojects, in partnership with the private sector.  \n \n9.  The  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  strengthens  the  policy  orientation  to  energy \nconservation, high-efficiency use, and energy security. The large energy efficiency potential is \nseen as a great opportunity to obtain some flexibility in the PRC\u2019s dependency on external \nsources of energy. By the end of this period, the Government aims to improve energy intensity \nby  20%  and  reduce  sulfur  dioxide  (SO )  emissions  by  10%  compared  with  2005  levels. \n2\nAchieving these targets requires major policy changes that would both revitalize investment in \nenergy efficiency throughout the PRC and encourage the shift to less energy-intensive and \nmore economically productive sectors. A number of steps have been taken to support this \ntarget. The Medium- and Long-Term Energy Conservation Plan highlights key sectors and \nprovides a conceptual road map for improving energy efficiency. The plan puts forward 10 \nspecific types of energy efficiency projects, and identifies the industry, transport, and building \nsectors as having the most potential for energy efficiency improvement. In addition, energy \nefficiency  is  granted  special  attention  along  with  energy  development  in  all  energy-related \nplanning  by  the  Government.  The  Energy  Conservation  Law  is  being  revised  and  a \ncomprehensive Energy Law is expected to be in effect by 2008.  \n \n10.  Furthermore, the PRC\u2019s highest governing bodies have made resource conservation a \nstrategic focal point for future economic development. The State Council has called for the \n ", "3 \nestablishment of a \u201cresource-saving society\u201d and emphasized every citizen\u2019s duty to conserve \nenergy and other resources. National standards are being developed for energy efficiency \nmonitoring and evaluation, verification, and labeling.  \nB.  Energy Efficiency Financing \n11.  Despite the recent policy shift in favor of energy efficiency, market barriers still limit the \nexpansion of energy efficiency projects. One of the key bottlenecks is lack of access to finance. \nThe reluctance of banks to finance energy efficiency projects is often cited as a key obstacle to \nscaling up energy efficiency project implementation. According to recent surveys and comments \nobtained  through  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Efficiency  Initiative  (EEI)  consultation  process,  the  main \nreasons why financially viable energy efficiency projects fail to attract commercial bank loans in \nthe PRC are summarized as follows: \n \n(i)  Energy efficiency projects involve a wide range of technologies with which the \ncommercial  banks  are  often  unfamiliar.  There  is  gap  in  energy  efficiency \nknowledge and misperceptions of actual technology risks. Commercial banks \nhave  not  yet  developed  sufficient  technical  knowledge  and  experience.  No \nspecific  training  system  exists.  As  a  result,  that  there  is  little  marketing, \nevaluation, and structuring of energy efficiency projects. \n \n(ii)  Management  awareness  about  energy  efficiency  financing  is  low,  and  no \neffective financing model for energy efficiency projects has been developed in \nthe market. Few management resources have therefore been allocated for this \npurpose. \n  \n(iii)  The  due  diligence  costs  associated  with  energy  efficiency  projects  are  high \nbecause of the need for technical evaluation regardless of the project size. \n  \n(iv)  Availability of medium- and long-term loans, even for 3\u20135 years, is very limited. \n \n(v)  The local banking sector is highly liquid, but financing is often based on high \ncollateralization,  making  it  difficult  for  energy  end  users  to  raise  financing. \nSubstantial credit enhancement is needed to meet the security requirements of \nlocal commercial banks. \n \n12.  A window of opportunity exists for ADB to make a real impact in this sector in the PRC. \nBy mobilizing available domestic funds in an effective investment program, ADB can help \nsupport energy efficiency investment and create better awareness among commercial banks. \nThe program approach, broad in reach, will enable ADB to provide financing support for a large \nnumber of energy efficiency projects, which are often too small for ADB to finance directly.  \nC.  ADB\u2019s Operations \n1.  Country Strategy \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  the  PRC  is  based  on  four  development  objectives: \n(i) equitable  and  inclusive  growth,  (ii)  better  and  more  efficient  markets,  (iii)  environmental \nimprovements, and (iv) regional cooperation.  \n \n ", "4   \n \n14.  To support the initiatives taken by the Government to let the private sector contribute as \nthe driving force for long-term economic growth and job creation, ADB plans to substantially \nincrease its private sector operations in the PRC, particularly in the infrastructure and energy \nsectors, the financial sector, and environmental improvements. In the infrastructure and energy \nsectors, ADB prioritizes pioneering projects with innovative contractual and financial structuring \nto encourage private sector participation and enhance management expertise.  \n2.  Medium-Term Strategy II  \n15.  ADB\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy II (2006\u20132008) seeks more directly to help DMCs acquire \nlow-carbon technologies, and to implement energy efficiency and renewable energy projects to \nenable Asia to take the technology leap. Catalyzing investment to improve the investment \nclimate, expanding private sector operations, and managing the environment are also priorities. \n3.  Energy Sector Strategy \n16.  ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy supports, as operational priorities, (i) poverty reduction, \nthrough such means as energy infrastructure development for sustainable economic growth, \nand increased access to energy for the poor, particularly in rural areas; (ii) private sector \ninvolvement, through energy sector restructuring and the creation of an enabling environment \nfor the private sector to invest and operate; (iii) regional and global environment impact, through \nmeasures that address acid rain problems and promote the use of clean energy; and (iv) \nregional cooperation. The ongoing review of ADB\u2019s energy policy is expected to recommend \ngreater focus on energy efficiency. \n4.  The Energy Efficiency Initiative \n17.  ADB\u2019s EEI aims to expand ADB operations in energy efficiency and clean energy to at \nleast $1 billion a year, according to the general framework for the implementation of EEI.  \n \n18.  The EEI task force has identified the PRC as a priority DMC with the highest potential \namong DMCs in Asia and the Pacific for energy efficiency and clean energy investments. The \ntask force has been holding consultative meetings in the PRC to learn firsthand from energy \nefficiency market stakeholders\u2019 about immediate investment opportunities and barriers in the \nPRC  market  as  a  prerequisite  for  developing  energy  efficiency  projects.  EEI  consultations \nconfirmed  many  different  approaches  are  needed  to  tap  various  segments  with  significant \nenergy efficiency potential. ADB has developed several projects under the EEI in the PRC. In its \npublic sector operations, ADB is working with a provincial government to provide a financial \nintermediation loan to a provincial trust company to finance energy efficiency in the industrial \nsector (multitranche financing facility for the Guangdong Energy Efficiency and Environment \nImprovement Investment Program). In the private sector, in addition to the proposed Program, \nADB has called for proposals from private equity funds interested in equity investment in clean \nenergy and energy efficiency projects in the region. \n \n19.  The  proposed  Program  responds  to  a  request  from  EEI  task  force  to  design  and \nimplement a new risk-sharing methodology in order to facilitate investments in energy efficiency \nprojects. Ongoing consultation with a wide range of stakeholders has enabled ADB to develop \nthe Program as a pilot project to address the financing needs of a series of small and medium \nscale energy efficiency projects.  \n ", "5 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n20.  The impact of the Program is to expand private sector investment in energy efficiency \nprojects in the PRC by developing the energy efficiency financing activities of qualified financial \ninstitutions (Partner Banks), thereby achieving energy efficiency improvements and associated \nreduction in the growth of GHGs and other pollutants. To achieve this objective, the Program \nwill provide PCGs that will enable commercial banks to offer energy end users access to energy \nefficiency financing at reliable and reasonable terms and conditions.  \n \n21.  Energy efficiency investments are needed in a range of market segments and each \nsector has distinct credit characteristics and investment needs. Since the commercial banks \nhave limited experience in energy efficiency financing, the Program will focus on a specific area \nto accelerate learning among the banks. Consultations have led to the selection of the energy \nefficiency of buildings as the initial target market on the basis of market potential as well as the \ncommercial  banks\u2019  interest,  appetite,  and  capacity.  Energy  efficiency  of  buildings  can  be \nachieved with proven technologies and has significant improvement potential. Yet this market \nhas been neglected because of relatively more attention being focused on improving industry \nenergy efficiency. Urban areas are responsible for about 75% of all energy use and GHG \nemission in the world. Buildings account for nearly 40% of GHG emissions worldwide. Improving \nenergy efficiency in buildings with appropriate technologies locks in the pattern of energy use for \nmany  years.  Given  the  PRC\u2019s  rapid  urbanization,  energy  efficiency  of  buildings  will  have \nlong-lasting and large cumulative impact. The Program will provide energy end users with \naccess to the necessary funds to retrofit existing buildings with energy-saving improvements \nand install energy-efficient products in their buildings, typically leading to energy savings of 20\u2013\n40%. \nB.  Description \n1.  The Program \n \n22.  The Program will set up systems and framework agreements to provide energy end user \nwith increased access to finance for energy efficiency projects that have so far not been fully \naddressed through local financing. ADB will provide a PCG to each Partner Bank to cover the \ncredit risks associated with energy efficiency projects, thereby mobilizing their funds for energy \nefficiency projects. The lack of technical competence among commercial banks to make a \ntechnical assessment of energy efficiency projects is a key bottleneck. Thus, combining the \ntechnical skills of a private sector energy management company (Technical Partner) with ADB \nrisk-sharing is a key innovation under the Program.  \n \n23.  Each energy efficiency project financed by a Partner Bank under the Program will benefit \nfrom comprehensive technical input from the Technical Partner throughout the project cycle. \nThe Technical Partner will take the lead in marketing, energy audit, technical due diligence, \nsetting the energy policy for end users, and equipment procurement. The Technical Partner will \nsource the projects to be financed by a Partner Bank for credit assessment and further due \ndiligence. Each eligible energy efficiency loan is subject to detailed technical review by the \nTechnical Partner and credit assessment and approval by the relevant Partner Bank. \n ", "6   \n \nC.  The Credit Guarantee  \n1.  Rationale \n \n24.  Commercial banks in the PRC tend to lend mainly against fixed asset collateral as \nopposed to the prospective project cash flow and debt service capacity. This approach often \nlimits the market for commercial bank financing. Because of lack of experience, the banks often \nperceive the risk of lending for energy efficiency purposes to be higher than the actual risks. The \nProgram is intended to help close this gap. It will support projects that are viable but lack access \nto  finance  under  current  lending  practices.  Energy  efficiency  projects  can  often  pay  for \nthemselves from energy cost savings, but these projects generally lack collateral value, as the \nequipment is engineered for and installed at the energy user\u2019s facilities and is difficult to remove \nand use economically in other locations. The Program will help address this barrier to energy \nefficiency finance by providing a substitute for collateral value, allowing the commercial banks to \nunderwrite financing on the basis of the economic merits and cash flows of energy efficiency \nprojects. With the credit enhancement tool to be provided by the Program, Partner Banks can \nprudently extend their risk horizons, enter new markets, and offer loans for energy efficiency \nprojects at reliable and reasonable terms and conditions. \n \n  2.  Scope of the Guarantee \n25.  Each PCG will cover an agreed portion of the principal amount financed by the relevant \nPartner Bank under the relevant energy efficiency loans. ADB\u2019s aggregate liability under the \nProgram will be limited to CNY800 million. ADB will agree on the lending selection criteria and \nrisk management process with each Partner Bank. Once ADB is satisfied with the record of a \nPartner Bank and its borrowers, portfolio targets may be revised to encourage the Partner Bank \nto expand to new customer segments.  \n \n  3.  Eligibility Criteria and Use of Proceeds \n26.  The  PCG  covers  both  the  retrofitting  of  existing  buildings  with  energy  efficiency \ntechnology and equipment and also the financing of new buildings, such as green buildings, \nwith improved arrangements for more efficient energy use. The Program will consider energy \nefficiency projects that (i) have energy efficiency potential, as confirmed through an energy audit \nby the Technical Partner; and (ii) are creditworthy, as evaluated and approved by the applicable \nPartner Bank. Eligible energy efficiency projects will be selected according to the preagreed \nminimum criteria. These eligibility criteria and procedures will be adopted by each Partner Bank. \nEnergy efficiency loans that involve land acquisition or resettlement will not be considered. \nLoans  provided  under  the  Program  will  be  used  to  fund  all  costs  associated  with  energy \nefficiency projects: (i) energy equipment and systems, (ii) installation costs; (iii) engineering \ncosts; (iv) financing costs and fees; and (v) project development costs. \n \nD.  Program Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Selection and Approval of Partner Banks \n \n27.  Partner Banks will be selected at the sole discretion of ADB. Before final selection, each \nPartner Bank will be subject to detailed due diligence and credit analysis. The standardized \ncredit review of each Partner Bank will include an analysis of capital adequacy, asset quality, \n ", "7 \nliquidity, connected or large lending, and profitability. It will also include a review of ownership, \nintegrity,  governance,  money  laundering  controls,  credit  approval  process,  and  operating \ncapacity.  \n  3.  Reporting and Management \n28.  Each Partner Bank will be required to follow a pre-agreed and standardized format both \nfor loan documentation and for regular reporting. It must promptly notify ADB of any defaults in \nthe portfolio.  \n \nIV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Justification \n \n29.  The  Program  is  justified  by  its  development  impact  and  demonstration  effects.  It \nsupports the Government\u2019s development plans, ADB\u2019s operational strategies, and the value \nadded of ADB\u2019s participation.  \n \n(i)  The  Program  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  policy  of  promoting  a  resource-\nsaving society by bridging the gap between the substantial level of investment \nrequired  in  energy  efficiency  projects  and  the  limited  financing  capacity  of \ncommercial banks. It addresses and is aligned with the Government\u2019s strategic \npriorities for energy and environment as set forth in the 11th Five-Year Plan.  \n \n(ii)  The  Program  will  embody  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  the  PRC,  which \nemphasizes supporting environmental improvement. The Program introduces a \nnew  mechanism  for  efficiently  addressing  demand-side  energy  management, \nwhich  helps  to  arrest  environmental  degration,  and  advance  sustainable \ndevelopment without sacrificing the standard of living. \n \n(iii)  The Program is consistent with ADB\u2019s private sector operations policy in the \nPRC, which is focused on the infrastructure and energy sectors, the financial \nsector,  and  environmental  improvements.  This  Program  contributes  to  the \nintroduction  and  transfer  of  state-of-the-art  technology  and  management \nknow-how to be used in dealing with energy management in the PRC.  \n \n(iv)  The Program is in line with ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy, which recommends a \nreorientation  of  energy  sector  activities  to  address  regional  and  global \nenvironmental  impact.  By  introducing  energy  efficiency,  the  Program  will \ncontribute to mitigating climate change. The proposed guarantee structure is a \nmulti-obligor guarantee in local currency with a clear thematic intervention for \nenergy efficiency, consistent with ADB\u2019s credit enhancement operations policy. \n \n(v)  The Program will embody ADB\u2019s EEI and Innovation and Efficiency Initiative, \nwhich recommends the introduction of new forms of cofinancing through active \nrisk-sharing with commercial financing partners.  \n \n ", "8   \n \nB.  Development Impact  \n30.  The Program is designed to promote economic growth and environmental improvement \nin the PRC through improved energy efficiency. The impacts of improving energy efficiency in \nthe PRC will decrease in the growth rate of GHG emissions, increase energy services, and \nimprove energy security. Specifically, the Program will (i) demonstrate the potential for energy \nefficiency in retrofitted and new buildings, which are untapped areas of energy efficiency, and \nset standards for competitors to follow; (ii) improve global and local environmental conditions \nthrough improved energy efficiency; (iii) support the Government\u2019s efforts to build a resource-\nsaving society through private sector participation; (iv) help remove barriers to investments in \nenergy efficiency, thereby promoting enterprise competitiveness and economic growth; and \n(v) demonstrate that energy efficiency projects are bankable and encourage the private sector \nto invest in energy efficiency beyond the Program\u2019s intervention. \n \n31.  The  development  impact  of  the  Program  will  be  assessed  and  described  from  the \nperspective of development effectiveness and Program framework, and its contribution to both \neconomic sustainability and private sector development as per guidelines for the implementation \nof  the  Good  Practice  Standards  for  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector  Investment  Operations \nprepared by the Evaluation Cooperation Group of the multilateral development banks. It is \ndeemed  to  be  developmentally  effective,  and  its  performance  measurable.  A  summary \ndiscussion of each of these assessment parameters follows. \n  1.  Program Performance \n32.  The Program will be assessed against its specific investment capital, operational and \nfinancial objectives. Effectiveness will be measured in terms of how successfully the Program \nattracts private sector investment in energy efficiency, and leads to annual energy savings and \nreductions in GHG emissions.  \n2.  Economic Sustainability \n33.  The Program will be assessed for economic sustainability, by evaluating its ability to \ndevelop and implement energy efficiency infrastructure and contribute to sustainable growth. \nThe Program\u2019s successful implementation will promote retrofitted and green buildings in the \nPRC. \n \n3.  Private Sector Development \n \n34.  The Program will be assessed by its contribution to private sector development. This \nassessment will focus on the Program\u2019s commercial and financial viability, and its demonstrative \nand catalytic effect on future private sector participation in energy efficiency and the economy \nas a whole. \n \n35.  The Program will not be specifically assessed from an investment profitability point of \nview, as a profitability assessment is better gauged and measured against a portfolio of similar \nloans  and  equity  investments.  Similarly,  the  Program  will  not  be  assessed  and  measured \nagainst overall operational effectiveness, as this is a department-wide consideration.  \n \n ", "9 \nC.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n1.  ADB Safeguards \n \n36.  The Program has been classified environmental category FI and assigned as category C \nwith respect to indigenous people and resettlement. Each Partner Bank will set up and maintain \nan environmental management system (EMS) for new projects and build capacity to implement \nthe system. At least one bank officer will attend ADB-sponsored training in environmental \nmanagement.  \n2.  Clean Development Mechanism \n37.  Energy savings provide an environmentally sound solution to reduce GHG emissions \nsuch as carbon dioxide (CO ) and have the potential to generate carbon credits under the Clean \n2\nDevelopment Mechanism (CDM). The CDM is a market-based arrangement under the Kyoto \nProtocol  that  allows  industrialized  countries  with  GHG  reduction  commitment  to  purchase \ncarbon credits from developing countries to meet their commitment. The Program will support \nthe energy end users in exploring possibilities for generating carbon revenue from their projects \nduring the feasibility studies, and will also seek assistance from ADB\u2019s Carbon Market Initiative \nfor this purpose. The additional carbon revenue will assist in removing the barriers to energy \nefficiency projects. \nD.  Anticorruption Policy; Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism \n38.  Each Partner Bank will be advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) and the policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism  (2003).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB will require each Partner Bank to institute, maintain, and comply with internal \nprocedures and controls following international best practice standards for preventing corruption \nor money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism, and covenant with ADB to refrain \nfrom engaging in such activities.

Overview \n \n1.  The impacts of improving energy efficiency in Asia-Pacific will be a lower growth rate of \nCO2 emissions, increased energy services, and improved energy security. The slowdown in \nCO  emissions will help reduce the adverse impact of climate change and promote sustainable \n2\neconomic growth. Such impact merits support from both developed and developing countries. \nThe rationale for energy efficiency must be firmly established to sustain political will and long-\nterm investment focus at the required scale. Investments in energy efficiency can be justified \nand pursued to the extent of their economic merits. This is known as the no-regrets strategy, \nwhich means that making energy efficiency investments that are economically viable now, \nirrespective of their long-term environmental benefits, can later create no regrets if predicted \nclimate change impacts do not occur.  \n \n2.  Energy efficiency has a large technical and economic potential, at a scale that can \ncontribute substantially to meeting future demands for energy services. The economy does not \nneed  energy  per  se,  but  rather  energy  services\u2014transport,  heating,  cooling,  drive  power, \nrefrigeration, pumping, lighting, etc. Energy efficiency means delivering the services with less \nprimary  energy.  Technological  development  already  does  this;  over  the  years  the  energy \nintensity in industrialized countries has substantially improved. The International Energy Agency \nhas argued that energy efficiency needs to be viewed like other energy sources; it estimates \nthat without the energy savings in the 25-year period from 1973 to 1998, the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries would have been almost 50% \nhigher, which makes the contribution of energy efficiency greater than that of oil and coal. \nFurther, energy efficiency can be exploited faster, more cheaply, and with employment that \ngenerates domestic economic growth and investment. \nB.  Energy Efficiency Benefits \n3.  Capital Stock Turnover Rates. Each investment in infrastructure for energy supply and \nenergy-using  equipment  locks  in  the  pattern  of  primary  energy  use  for  many  years. \nInfrastructure  for  energy-intensive  industries  such  as  steel,  cement,  aluminum,  and  power \ngeneration and transmission, lasts 20\u201340 years. It follows that energy efficiency investments \nwould also have a long-lived and large cumulative impact. \n \n4.  Macroeconomic Benefits. Energy efficiency reduces fossil fuel consumption, thereby \nlowering fossil fuel imports (saving foreign currency) and trade deficits, reducing vulnerability to \noil price volatility, and improving overall international competitiveness (in the face of high energy \nprices).  Employment  and  domestic  job  growth  are  also  associated  with  energy  efficiency. \nMarket-wide declines in fossil fuel demand can create a downward pressure on international \nfuel prices, or diminish upward price trends, resulting in lower or more stable prices to the \nbenefit of the region\u2019s economies, which are generally net fossil fuel consumers. \n \n5.  Air Pollution and Health. When linked to a reduction in coal use in urban areas, energy \nefficiency reduces urban air pollution and generates quantifiable public health benefits.  \n \n                                                 \n \n1  Based on ADB. 2006. Report on Energy Efficiency Initiative. Manila. \n ", "Appendix 2  15 \n6.  Enterprise Benefits. Energy efficiency results in economic benefits to energy users at \nthe enterprise level. Many energy efficiency projects have compelling economics, with savings \nof 20\u201340% of energy use in a given application and simple payback periods in the range of 2\u20133 \nyears. Yet these investments have remained largely undeveloped because of various market \nand  institutional  barriers.  By  reducing  energy  use  per  unit  of  output  or  service  delivered, \nenterprises save money, reduce maintenance costs, increase productivity, and improve product \nquality (energy efficiency often involves upgrading technology). \n \n7.  Achieving  the  Development  Goals  of  Developing  Member  Countries.  Energy \nefficiency projects can contribute to reducing poverty and meeting the development goals of \ndeveloping  member  countries  because  they  are  often  the  least-cost  means  for  expanding \nenergy services and allowing the population to enjoy a high quality of life with less primary \nresource consumption overall\u2014a key to long-term sustainability. \n ", "16     Appendix 3 \nGOVERNMENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK \nA.  Top-Down Energy Efficiency Policy \n \n1.  Improving energy efficiency has been a cornerstone of the energy policy of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) for 20 years. In the 1980s, the Government employed a monitoring \nand quota mechanism through the planned economy to promote energy conservation and \ncurtail at least the most blatant cases of energy waste. As late as the 1990s the number of \nenergy efficiency projects that received funding was determined by a top-down approach that \ndepended largely on state subsides. State-owned banks were instructed to finance projects \nselected by the Government. The Energy Conservation Law, passed in 1997, was intended to \nfacilitate energy saving, improve the efficiency of energy use, protect the environment, and \nguarantee national economic and social development. It calls for increased efficiency of energy \nuse and encourages the development and use of new sources of energy. Accordingly, energy-\nusing entities must \u201cstrengthen energy management, and formulate and implement technical \nmeasures  for  energy  savings.\u201d  The  Circular  of  the  State  Council  on  the  View  of  Further \nDeveloping  the  Comprehensive  Resource  Utilization  (Guo  Fa,  August  1996,  No.  36)  is \nsupplementary to the law and emphasizes the key field of energy conservation.  \n \n2.  When the PRC began its transition toward market economy, however, the Government \nmade a variety of significant changes that affected energy efficiency. It reformed the banking \nsector, liberalizing energy prices, and phasing out subsidies for energy efficiency projects.  \nB.  Market-Based Energy Efficiency Policy \n3.  Faced with the recent energy intensity increase since 2001, the Government recognizes \nthe urgency of the need for significant improvements and investments in energy efficiency. A \nshift  in  the  national  energy  policy  has  assigned  first  priority  to  energy  conservation  and \nimproved  energy  efficiency  from  the  previous  emphasis  on  energy  exploitation.  Expanded \ninvestment in energy efficiency projects, among others, is a high priority for environmental \nsustainability and enterprise competitiveness. The Government seeks to promote market-based \nmethods to deliver and finance energy efficiency projects, in partnership with the private sector.  \n \n4.  The  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  set  the  goals  of  improving  the  energy \ninfrastructure, increasing the share of energy provided by natural gas, and reducing coal use \nthrough various measures, including energy conservation and efficiency.  \n \n5.  The 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) further strengthens the policy orientation toward \nenergy  conservation,  high-efficiency  use,  and  energy  security.  The  high  energy  efficiency \npotential is seen as a great opportunity to obtain some flexibility in the country\u2019s dependency on \nexternal sources of energy. By the end of the plan period, the PRC Government aims to achieve \na  20%  improvement  in  energy  intensity  compared  with  2005  levels.  Achieving  this  target \nrequires  major  policy  changes  that  would  both  revitalize  investment  in  energy  efficiency \nthroughout the PRC and encourage the shift to less energy-intensive and more economically \nproductive sectors. The plan aims to achieve structural, technical, and management of energy \nconservation  through  an  optimized  industrial  structure,  wide  use  of  energy  conservation \ntechnology,  and  strengthened  systems  in  the  energy  production,  transportation,  and \nconsumption industries and other industries. Chapter 12 of the plan, related to the energy \nindustry,  emphasizes  pluralistic  and  optimal  development  to  secure  a  stable,  economically \nsustainable, clean, and safe energy supply system.  \n ", "Appendix 3  17 \n6.  A number of steps have been taken to support the achievement of the 20% reduction \ntarget. The related administrative regulations include the Circular of the General Office of the \nNational  Development  Reform  Commission  on  Organizing  and  Implementing  the  National \nDevelopment  of  Important  Industries  and  Technologies  in  Energy  Conservation  and  Key \nTechnologies of Renewable Energies (September 2004), the Circular of the General Office of \nthe State Council on Further Pushing the Innovation of Wall Materials and Popularizing the \nBuilding of Energy Conservation (Guo Ban Fa, June 2005, No. 33), and the Circular of the \nGeneral Office of the State Council on the View of Encouraging the Development for the Energy \nEfficient, Environmental Friendly and Low Emission Vehicles (Guo Ban Fa, December 2005, \nNo. 61). Most importantly, the Medium- and Long-Term Energy Conservation Plan highlights \nkey sectors of emphasis and provides a conceptual road map for improving energy efficiency. \nThe plan puts forward 10 specific types of energy efficiency projects, and identifies the sectors \nwith the most potential for energy efficiency improvement. Energy efficiency is also granted \nspecial attention along with energy development in all of the Government\u2019s energy-related \nplanning. In addition, the Energy Conservation Law is being revised and a comprehensive \nEnergy Law is expected to be in effect by 2008. The revised Energy Conservation Law will \n(i) specify the enforcement authority; (ii) broaden the field of energy conservation; (iii) provide \nconcrete  measures  for  energy  pricing,  financing,  and  taxation  or  fiscal  budgeting;  and \n(iv) provide stricter punishment. \n \n7.  Furthermore,  the  PRC\u2019s  highest-level  governing  bodies  have  defined  resource \nconservation as a strategic focal point for the PRC\u2019s future economic development. In this vein, \nthe  State  Council  has  called  for  the  establishment  of  a  \u201cresource-saving  society\u201d  and \nemphasized every citizen\u2019s duty to conserve energy and other recourses.  \n \n8.  In 2004, the PRC\u2019s Initial National Communication to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) stated that \u201cA key component of the PRC\u2019s industrial \npolicies is to reduce consumption of energy and other resources, improve the comprehensive \nutilization and efficient use of energy and other resources, promote cleaner production, and \nprevent and control industrial pollution.\u201d It added: \u201cThe Chinese government has all along \nattached great importance to international cooperation in the field of climate change.\u201d National \nstandards for energy efficiency monitoring and evaluation, verification, and labeling are being \ndeveloped. \n \n9.  In  April  2006  the  Government  launched  the  Top-1000  Program  to  improve  energy \nefficiency in industrial enterprises. The top 1,000 enterprises were in the following industries: \n(i) building  materials,  (ii)  power,  (iii)  textile,  (iv)  iron  and  steel,  (v)  chemical,  (vi)  coal, \n(vii) petroleum and petrochemical, (viii) nonferrous metal, and (ix) paper. Each enterprise is \nsupposed to sign an energy efficiency agreement with the Government set energy efficiency \ngoals, implement an energy utilization reporting system, conduct energy audits, draw up an \nenergy conservation plan, invest in energy efficiency improvement, and train its officials and \nstaff in energy efficiency.  \n \n10.  The Decision of the State Council on Strengthening Energy Conservation (Guo Fa, \nAugust, 2006, No. 28) places energy conservation in a position of greater strategic urgency to \nensure the fulfillment of the energy conservation goals of the 11th Five-Year Plan. Overall \nenergy  consumption  in  key  industries  should  reach  internationally  advanced  levels.  The \ndecision  reiterates  the  main  goals  of  energy  conservation,  which  are  to  (i)  lower  the \nconsumption of each CNY 10,000 GDP to 0.98 tons of standard coal, about 20% less than at \nthe  end  of  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  Period;  and  (ii)  achieve  an  annual  average  energy \nconservation efficiency of 4.4%. The decision also explicitly asks all areas and departments to \n ", "18   Appendix 3   \n \n \nadopt  the  following  measures  to  meet  the  energy  conservation  goal:  (i)  revise  industry \nstructures and build energy-saving industrial systems by increasing the proportion of the service \nindustry in the national economy, strictly controlling the growth of industries with high energy \nconsumption, and developing high-efficiency, clean, and renewable sources of energy; (ii) focus \non energy conservation in key fields, including energy-consuming industries, residential and \npublic buildings, transportation, commercial and civilian fields, rural areas, and government \ndepartments;  (iii)  pursue  the  development  of  energy  conservation  technologies  and  the \nimplementation  of  the  10  energy  conservation  projects  in  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan; \n(iv) strengthen energy conservation supervision and administration; and (v) establish energy \nconservation  guarantee  mechanisms  comprising  energy  price  reforms,  preferential  taxation \npolicies, and a reward system for energy conservation.  \n \n11.  In March 2007, Premier Wen Jiabao reported to National People\u2019s Congress that eight \nmeasures would be implemented in 2007 to further improve energy conservation: (i) improve \ncompliance  with  energy  consumption  standards,  (ii)  abolish  obsolete  production  capacity, \n(iii) prioritize  energy  conservation  in  high-consumption  sectors,  (iv)  improve  the  policy \nframework,  (v)  accelerate  technological  development,  (vi)  improve  pollution  control, \n(vii) strengthen the regulatory compliance system, and (viii) effectively delegate responsibility for \nenergy conservation. CNY10 billion has been set aside for 2007 to be used in doing away with \noutdated production methods in industry, upgrading production technologies, and management \nof  high-energy-consuming  and  polluting  industries.  The  Integrated  Work  Plan  for  Energy \nConservation and Emission Reduction issued by the State Council in June 2007 reconfirmed 10 \nenergy-saving projects during the period of the 11th Five Year Plan. The aim is to produce 240 \nmillion tons of standard coal energy-saving capacity. \n \n12.  Preferential tax treatment policies for energy conservation were introduced in the new \nEnterprise  Income  Tax  Law.  Companies  that  engage  in  projects  involving  environmental \nprotection,  energy  saving,  and  water  conservation  will  enjoy  income  tax  deductions  or \nexemption. Investment in the purchase of specialized equipment used in those projects can be \noffset against income tax at specified percentages. In addition, other tax benefits have been put \nin place, such as deduction of value-added tax for energy efficiency activities. It is anticipated \nthat more detailed tax and fiscal policies will be issued to promote energy efficiency.  \n \n13.  The  Notification  on  Enhanced  Carrying  out  of  Differential  Electricity  Prices  in \nSeptember 2007  further  encourages  energy  efficiency  and  conservation.  Provincial \nDevelopment and Reform Commissions, Economic and Trade Commissions, and Price Bureaus \nare  to  identify  high-energy-consuming  enterprises  and  remove  favorable  electricity  price \nincentives previously granted to those industries, especially the aluminum (removal of incentive \nof CNY0.02 or CNY0.05 by the end of 2007 and elimination of any remaining incentives in \n2008), iron alloy (removal of the incentive of CNY0.02 per kilowatt-hour by 21 October 2007) \nand chlorine-caustic soda (removal of incentives in 2008) industries. \n \n ", "    Appendix 4           19 \n \n  \nADB\u2019S EFFORTS TO IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY \nA.  ADB in Asia and the Pacific1\n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has made several investments in energy efficiency, \nincluding (i) a $150 million credit line for the Industrial Development Bank of India that was used \nfor large industrial energy efficiency projects (1995); (ii) a $100 million credit line for the India \nRenewable  Energy  Development  Agency  (IREDA),  used  primarily  for  industrial  biomass \ncogeneration,  waste  heat  recovery,  and  wind  energy  projects  (1997);  and  (iii)  equity  fund \ninvestments in FondElec Global/Asia Clean Energy (FEGACE) Fund and China Environment \nFund  (2003).  ADB  successfully  developed  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM) \ntransaction related to the coal-mine methane (CMM) capture project in Fuxin, People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC); emission reduction credits from another two ADB projects in the PRC were sold \ndirectly by the project. Numerous energy efficiency investments have been made in power \ntransmission and distribution system upgrades, which were components of mainstream power \nsector loans. Urban environment improvement and energy projects in the PRC, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  and  Mongolia  include  projects  aimed  at  increasing  energy  efficiency  in  heat \ndistribution and gas supply. These supply-side projects were generally rated satisfactory or \npartly satisfactory, except for the loan through a financial intermediary. \n \n2.  ADB has made a limited number of interventions on the demand-side energy efficiency; \nthese were implemented in the 1990s mainly with the objective of improving the environment \nthrough the use of cleaner production technologies. Of the 11 such loans that were extended to \nindustrial  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  nine  were  rated  successful  and  two  partially \nsuccessful on completion. Continued and enhanced support for regulation to improve demand-\nside efficiency is essential for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In markets where \nsuch policies and regulations exist but are not effective, further interventions will be required. To \nsuitably address the concern related to market distortion, interventions can be designed for \nSOEs using the non-sovereign public sector financing facility (under ADB\u2019s Innovation and \nEfficiency Initiative), which enables the use of market-based lending terms.  \n \n3.  ADB  has  actively  promoted  energy  efficiency  in  the  region  through  its  technical \nassistance (TA) and capacity-building programs. Most recently, an interdepartmental program \nwas established on Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency and Climate Change (REACH). One \nof its key roles is to administer the following funds: (i) the Netherlands Cooperation Fund on \nPromotion  of  Investments  in  Developing  Member  Countries  (DMCs);  (ii)  the  Canadian \nCooperation Fund on Greenhouse Gas Abatement, Adaptation, and Carbon Sequestration, \nwhich aims to help and engage ADB\u2019s DMCs at the programming and policy level in managing \nand  abating  climate  change  to  reduce  the  growth  of  GHG  emissions;  (iii)  the  Danish \nCooperation Fund on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in Rural Areas, which helps \nADB promote environmental sustainability; and (iv) the Finnish Technical Assistance Grant \nFund to support environmental protection and development of renewable energy These funds \nhave been used to finance projects focused on advocacy, training, and capacity building and \nhave also supported numerous energy efficiency project pre-feasibility studies, identifying cost-\neffective investments, for example, in bagasse and rice husk cogeneration, agricultural and \nlivestock waste biogas, and industrial efficiency. \n                                                 \n \n1 Based on ADB. 2006. Report on Energy Efficiency Initiative. Manila. \n ", "20   Appendix 4 \n   \n \n4.  Overall, ADB\u2019s level of investment in sustainable energy has so far been below both the \npotential and the need. Advocacy and training programs are useful, but success needs to be \nmeasured in terms of investments made, energy saved or produced, and emissions reduced. \nThe current challenges call for ADB to increase its sustainable energy investing as a thematic \narea,  through  both targeted special energy efficiency projects and deeper incorporation of \nenergy efficiency components within mainstream investments.  \nB.   ADB in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n5.  By 2006, ADB\u2019s energy sector lending to the PRC exceeded $3.5 billion for 29 loans, \nwhich  had  successfully  facilitated  the  introduction  and  expansion  of  higher-risk  new \ntechnologies and new mechanisms, such as combined heat and power plants, CMM and coal-\nbed methane (CBM) extraction, pumped storage power plants, emission trading mechanisms, \n500  kilovolt  transmission  lines,  gas  insulated  substations,  as  well  as  documentation  and \ntransaction for CDM projects. Non-lending support of about $50 million has evolved from tariff \nreforms,  sector  restructuring,  establishment  of  the  electricity  regulator,  and  mainstreaming \nenvironment evaluation, to innovative technologies and mechanisms in energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy, and to capacity building for CDM.  \n \n6.  ADB assistance, in the form of policy advice, knowledge services, TA, project financing, \nand  risk  mitigation  services,  will  focus  on  (i)  energy  efficiency  and  energy  conservation; \n(ii) renewable energy, mainly wind, biomass, and hydropower; (iii) clean coal technologies; \n(iv) urban environment improvement; (v) CMM and CBM; and (vi) regional cooperation in power. \nADB will also support the Government in intensifying sector reforms and building capacity \n(particularly at the provincial and project implementation level), nurturing a more efficient energy \nmarket  by  catalyzing  private  investment,  mobilizing  the  participation  of  domestic  financial \ninstitutions, stimulating CDM-related carbon trading, assisting local energy service companies, \nand removing major barriers to the transfer and adoption of low-carbon technologies.  \n \n7.  In these focal areas, ADB will continue to conceptualize innovative projects and use new \ninitiatives and flexible financing tools, e.g., the Carbon Market Initiative (CMI), the Clean Energy \nFinancing Partnership Facility, the Energy Efficiency Initiative (EEI), financial intermediation, \nand multitranche financing facilities, in planning, designing, and implementing projects with \ntangible demonstration effects and significant opportunities for replication. Sector interventions \nwill be closely coordinated with private sector operations, and will actively seek private or \nnon-sovereign investment. Some projects targeted for the poor western provinces will directly \nbenefit  local  rural  communities,  thereby  promoting  inclusive  growth.  ADB  assistance  will \nimprove sector governance by adopting international best practices, ensuring efficient and fair \nprocurement,  mainstreaming  participatory  project  design,  and  enhancing  compliance  with \nsafeguards. \n \n8.
