The  program  supports  the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to increase financial inclusion by (i) strengthening the institutional and policy \nenvironment, (ii) improving the financial infrastructure, and (iii) increasing the capacity and reach \nof  service  providers.  The  program  is  consistent  with  the  Philippine  Development  Plan  (PDP), \n2017\u201320221 and is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  development  problem.  Despite  rising  and  sustained  economic  growth,  the \nGovernment of the Philippines faces a challenge of persistently high inequality. Sound economic \nstewardship,  and  an  emphasis  on  governance  and  infrastructure  led  to  an  acceleration  in \neconomic  growth  \u2013  which  averaged  6.2%  from  2011\u20132017,  and  a  decline  in  overall  poverty \nincidence from 26.6% in 2006 to 21.6% in 2015.3 However, the Philippines has one of the highest \nlevels of income inequality in Southeast Asia, with a Gini coefficient of 0.44 in 2015, compared \nwith  0.39  in  Indonesia  in  2017  and  0.38  in  Thailand  in  2013.  The  per  capita  gross  regional \ndomestic  product  in  the  National  Capital  Region  is  the  country\u2019s  highest,  and  is  more  than  12 \ntimes  that  in  the  Autonomous  Region  in  Muslim  Mindanao  (ARMM). 4  In  recognition  of  the \nchallenges, the PDP, 2017\u20132022 set ambitious objectives for inclusive growth. The rural poverty \nrate is targeted to decline from 30% in 2015 to 20% in 2022, and the overall poverty rate from \n21.6% to 14.0% during the same period. To achieve these targets, the government plans to create \njobs,  increase  incomes,  and  strengthen  the  investment  climate.  The  government\u2019s  signature \n\u201cBuild, Build, Build\u201d program calls for $168 billion in total infrastructure investment from 2017 to \n2022.  Spending  on  education,  skills,  and  public  service  delivery  has  been  increased  and  the \neconomy has responded, with economic growth further accelerating to 6.7% in 2017, the fastest \nin the Association of Southeast Asian Nations region.5  \n \nWhile  higher  economic  growth  will  provide  a  strong  foundation  for  reducing  inequality, \n4. \nmore needs to be done. High inequality in the Philippines is a result of several factors, but low \nlevels of financial inclusion \u2013 especially in rural areas \u2013 represents a key contributor.6 In 2017, \nonly 34% of Filipino adults held an account at a formal financial institution, compared with 49% of \nadults  in  Indonesia,  82%  in  Thailand,  and  85%  in  Malaysia  (Table  1).  Only  10%  of  the  adult \n\n                                                \n1  Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority. 2017.

Lower-income \nhouseholds are disproportionally excluded, with only 18% of adults from the bottom 40% income \ngroup holding an account at a formal financial institution in 2017 (the same level recorded in 2014). \nAdditionally, regional disparities in financial access are substantial, with bank offices concentrated \nin highly populated regions such as the National Capital Region, Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal \nand Quezon, and Central Luzon. As of September 2017, 35% of cities and municipalities did not \nhave  a  banking  office. 7  Taking  nonbank  financial  institutions  (e.g.,  microfinance  institutions, \ncooperatives,  pawnshops,  and  remittance  agents)  into  account  reduced  the  level  of  unserved \nmunicipalities from  35%  to  10%,  but  these  offer  only  a  limited  range  of  financial  products  and \nservices. As a result, many individuals have limited access to or are completely excluded from \nfinancial services, including savings, credit, remittances, payments, cash drawdowns, e-money \nconversions,  and  insurance.  Likewise,  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs), \nwhich are typically owned by individuals, lack access to similar types of financial services. While \nsome indicators on access to finance indicate gender gaps in favor of women, 61% of women still \nlack a bank account at a formal financial institution. \n \n\nTable 1: Financial Inclusion in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  \n(%) \n\nCountry \nCambodia \nMyanmar \nLao PDR \nViet Nam \nPhilippines \nIndonesia \nThailand \nMalaysia \n\nAccounta \n22 \n26 \n29 \n31 \n34 \n49 \n82 \n85 \n\nAccount \nMale \n22 \n26 \n26 \n31 \n30 \n46 \n84 \n88 \n\nAccount \nFemale \n22 \n26 \n32 \n30 \n39 \n51 \n80 \n82 \n\nAccount \nYouth  \n(age 15-24)  \n20 \n11 \n24 \n34 \n24 \n47 \n73 \n84 \n\nAccount  \nPoorest \n40%  \n53 \n30 \n42 \n42 \n18 \n37 \n78 \n81 \n\nBorrowed \nfrom a \nFinancial \nInstitution \n27 \n19 \n9 \n21 \n10 \n17 \n15 \n12 \n\nSaved at a \nFinancial \nInstitution \n\n5 \n8 \n18 \n14 \n12 \n22 \n39 \n38 \n\n  Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \n  Note: Indicators are defined as the percentage of people aged 15 and over who have an account. \na  Number of people who have an account, on their own or with someone else, at a bank or another type of financial          \n\ninstitution, or have personally used a mobile money service in the past 12 months. \n\nSource: World Bank.

Recognizing  the  challenges,  the  government  adopted  its  first \n5. \nNational Strategy for Financial Inclusion (NSFI) in 2015 to coordinate broad-based initiatives for \ngreater  financial  inclusion.  Based  on  an  assessment  of  the  2015  NSFI  and  a  stocktaking  of \ninclusive finance in the Philippines, three primary constraints have been identified: (i) structural \nimpediments  limit  access  to finance,  especially  for  the  rural  poor;  (ii)  financial  infrastructure  is \nfragmented and does not provide an enabling environment; and (iii) financial institutions exhibit \nlimited capacity to expand outreach and increase access to finance.8 \n \nStructural impediments. There are four primary structural impediments that limit access \n6. \nto finance: (i)  lack  of  a  national  identification  system (NIS);  (ii)  limited  availability  of  agriculture \nfinance; (iii) low penetration of microinsurance; and (iv) shallow financial literacy. In 2017, 32% of \n\n                                                \n7  Central Bank of the Philippines (BSP). 2017. Financial Inclusion in the Philippines: Dashboard as of Third Quarter \n\n2017. Manila. \n\n8  Sector Assessment (Summary): Finance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fthe  population  reported  not  having  a  bank  account  because  of  a  lack  of  necessary \ndocumentation.9 Thus, a single NIS and an integrated national database represent a necessary \nstarting  point  for  accelerating  financial  inclusion.  International  experience  shows  that  the \nestablishment of an NIS, with a foundational identification card,10 can improve poor households\u2019 \naccess  to  government  benefits  and  services  by  making  it  easier  to  open  a  bank  account.11 In \naddition, the legal and regulatory environment needs to be strengthened to better encourage the \nfinance  sector  to  provide  the  financial  products  and  services  necessary  for  individuals  in  rural \nhouseholds  to  generate  income  and  mitigate  financial  risks.12 With  25%  of  employed  persons \nworking  in  agriculture  (around  10  million  individuals)  rural  areas  often  rely  on  MSMEs  and \nagribusiness  for  growth  and  employment  creation.13 While  agricultural  lending  increased  17% \nfrom 2016 to 2017, agriculture finance overall remains underdeveloped and underutilized. Banks \nstruggle  to  comply  with  mandatory  agricultural  lending  requirements,  preferring  to  pay  the \npenalties for non-compliance rather than allocate part of their portfolio to the agriculture sector. \nTransaction costs are high, especially in rural areas, and financial institutions lack expertise in \nmanaging agricultural loan portfolios. Crop insurance coverage is available only from government \nentities, coverage of risk is narrow, fragmentation of the market limits demand, and value chains \nhave not yet been developed. The number of farmers covered by the Philippine Crop Insurance \nCorporation in 2017 increased to 1,040,000, but less than 2.82% of actual total damages were \npaid out  2017.14 Finally,  efforts  to  promote  financial  literacy  have not  been sufficient  to  ensure \nthat  consumers,  especially  poorer  households  and  MSMEs,  can  make  well-informed  financial \ndecisions. A coordinated financial education strategy and tailored financial literacy activities are \nnecessary  to  meet  the  needs  of  specific  groups  (e.g.,  women,  farmers,  fishers,  youth,  and \nMSMEs) and for specific types of financial services, including digital financial services. \n \nFragmented financial infrastructure. There are three primary impediments to financial \n7. \ninfrastructure:  (i)  an  underdeveloped  payment  system;  (ii)  lack  of  comprehensive  credit  and \ncollateral data; and (iii) a lack of alternative credit enhancement mechanisms. Financial inclusion \nis best served through a modern, efficient, and low-cost payment system. However, the payment \nsystem is costly, fragmented, and cannot support the efficient provision of electronic payments to \nreach the  underserved. Digital  payments  represented  only  1%  of total financial  transactions  in \n2013, demonstrating the lack of effective electronic delivery channels. Achieving higher levels of \nfinancial inclusion also depends on the ability of lenders to assess credit risks, and to compensate \nwith  collateral  if  necessary.    A  comprehensive  credit  reporting  registry  has  been  established. \nHowever,  awareness  of  the  registry  among  clients  and  financial  service  providers  is  low  and \nparticipation  is  limited,  especially  for  MSMEs.  Moreover,  the  absence  of  a  movable  collateral \nregistry  exacerbates  the  lack  of  credit  data  and  inhibits  bank  lending,  as  banks  are  unable  to \nmitigate their credit risk. While the government has a network of credit guarantee mechanisms, \n\n                                                \n9  The Philippines has multiple forms of identification; none are integrated, and none provide comprehensive coverage. \n10 A foundational national identification registry contains basic data which can be used for multi-purposes. \n11 For  example,  India  has  a  biometric  NIS  with  1.19  billion  enrolled  members  (as  of  30  November  2017),  and \napproximately 99% of households in both rural and urban areas in India now have at least one member with a bank \naccount, up from 50% in 2011 at the inception of the NIS.P. Bhattacharya. 2016. 99% Indian households are covered \nby  a  bank  account.  Mint.  9  April.  http://www.livemint.com/Specials/vVKbQ0cMmiNbdwOlfd0Z4N/99-Indian-\nhouseholds-are-covered-by-a-bank-account.html.  \n\n12 The  agriculture  sector  represents  9.7%  of  gross  domestic  product  and  yet  has  a  high  unmet  demand  for  more \nsophisticated agriculture and agriculture value chain finance (financial products and services supporting the full range \nof value adding activities required for bringing a product or service from the farm to the final customer or consumer) \nand crop insurance. \n\n13 Government of the Philippines, Philippine Statistics Authority. https://www.psa.gov.ph (accessed 3 July 2018). \n14 Legislation  pending  in  Congress  proposes  to  address  weaknesses  of  the  Philippine  Corp  Insurance  Corporation \n\nthrough a recapitalization of funds and by allowing engagement in index-based insurance and reinsurance. \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nthe  credit  guarantee  system  is  undercapitalized,  inefficient,  and  underused.  This  weakness \nespecially limits the extension of credit to MSMEs, which usually lack collateral, particularly for \nagriculture finance. \n \nLimited  capacity  of  financial  institutions.  The  limited  capacity  of  financial  service \n8. \nproviders prevents wider outreach and constrains access to finance, especially in rural areas. The \nmicrofinance  sector  has  approximately  1,400  operating  microfinance  institutions,  including \nmicrofinance nongovernment organizations (MNGOs), rural banks, thrift banks, and cooperatives \nserving  about  7  million active clients.  As  of  2017, the  banking sector  alone  had  164  operating \nmicrofinance  banks  serving  1.8  million  clients  with  outstanding  loans  amounting  to  around \n$279 million. 15  Despite  this  growth,  MNGOs\u2014which  serve  the  most  excluded  populations, \nincluding  poor  women\u2014are  unable  to  meet  existing  demand.  With  the  passage  of  the \nMicrofinance NGOs Act in 2015, registered and accredited MNGOs now pay only 2% tax. The \ncost savings from the reduced tax burden can be translated into new product development, lower \ninterest  rates,  and  expanded  outreach.  However,  MNGOs  have  not  been  subjected  to  a \ncomprehensive regulatory structure, including social and governance performance standards and \nregular monitoring, which would ensure their financial sustainability and better protect their clients. \nRural banks, which are best placed to reach MSMEs and agricultural enterprises in rural areas, \nalso exhibit limited financial and operational capacity. Without cost-effective credit assessment or \nenhancement mechanisms, most rural banks limit their risk exposure, resulting in lower outreach. \nFinancial technology has the potential to rapidly expand and scale financial services. However, \nmost financial institutions lack the financial resources or ability to innovate. Finally, gaps in the \nlegal and regulatory framework for Islamic finance have slowed development of Islamic financial \nservices, particularly in the ARMM, limiting financial inclusion in that region.  \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe  government\u2019s  reform  agenda.  Expanding  financial  services  across  the  country, \nincluding  regions  with  the  highest  levels  of  poverty,  is  critical  to  achieving  the  government\u2019s \nagenda of promoting inclusive growth. On 1 July 2015, the government launched the Philippines\u2019 \nfirst NSFI to coordinate broad-based initiatives for greater financial inclusion.16 The NSFI serves \nas a guide for stakeholders to systematically accelerate financial inclusion in the Philippines. The \nobjective of the NSFI is to achieve a regionally responsive, development-oriented, and inclusive \nfinancial  system that  provides  for the  evolving  needs  of  a diverse  Filipino  public.  The four key \nareas of the strategy are (i) policy and regulation, (ii) financial education and consumer protection, \n(iii)  advocacy  programs,  and  (iv)  data  and  measurement.  NSFI  initiatives  and  areas  of  policy \ninformation  systems, \nreform  cover  (i)  digital \n(iv) development  of  a  movable  collateral  registry,  (v)  diversification  of  financial  products  and \nservices, and (vi) strengthening of the capacity of financial service providers. The NSFI has been \nembraced by the PDP, 2017\u20132022, which calls for the development of inclusive business models \nand social enterprises to better engage MSMEs and to increase their access to finance. \n \n10. \nProposed policy reforms. The use of a programmatic approach with a policy-based loan \nand  technical  assistance  (TA)  provides  for  comprehensive  and  flexible  support  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s reform program over the medium to long term. Subprogram 1, which is the first of \ntwo  subprograms,  contains  14  high-impact  reforms,  including  seven  policy  triggers  and  seven \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\nliteracy,  (iii)  credit \n\nfinance,  (ii) \n\nfinancial \n\n                                                \n15  A microfinance bank is defined as either a rural or thrift bank with more than 50% of its portfolio in microfinance. \n    BSP. 2017.

Manila. \n \n\n\fpolicy  milestones.17 All  policy  actions  have  been  accomplished.  The  program  will  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s  efforts  under  the  NSFI  to  increase  financial  inclusion  by  (i)  strengthening  the \ninstitutional and policy environment, (ii) improving the financial infrastructure, and (iii) increasing \nthe capacity and reach of service providers with a focus on nonbank financial institutions in rural \nareas. TA will  support policy reforms proposed under subprogram 2 and the medium-term results \nframework.18 The scope of the TA includes (i) development of a road map for agriculture finance, \n(ii)  development  of  diverse  microinsurance  products  and  services  through  public\u2013private \npartnerships, (iii) promotion of digital financial services, (iv) a strategic plan for financial literacy \ninitiatives,  (v)  strengthened  capacity  of  financial  service  providers,  and  (vi) gender-responsive \nstrategies to support key policy reforms. Subprogram 2 may include a TA loan. A medium-term \ndirection  and  expected  results  policy  framework  covering  2016\u20132022  provides  a  structure  for \ncontinued policy reforms and ongoing dialogue with government. \n \n11. \nInstitutional and policy environment for financial inclusion. This reform area reflects \nthe  implementation  of  institutional  measures  to  improve  access  to  finance  among  poorer \nhouseholds  and  MSMEs.  Accomplishments  under  subprogram  1  included  the  government\u2019s \nsubmission  of  draft  legislation  to  Congress  for  the  development  of  a  NIS  with  an  identification \ncard,  and  a  commitment  of  $40  million  to  support  implementation  through  the  General \nAppropriations Act for 2018\u20132020. Over time, the NIS will increase the reach of the government\u2019s \nfinancial inclusion efforts and improve data availability, leading to increased financial inclusion, \nespecially among the poorest and most excluded segments of the population who are most likely \nto lack the identification needed to open a bank account or borrow from a financial institution. The \ngovernment also adopted complementary regulatory reforms to expand the availability of products \nand services. The Central Bank of the Philippines (BSP) issued regulatory guidelines to support \nagricultural  value  chain  finance  and  provided  incentives  to  banks  to  offer  agriculture  finance \nproducts,  including  an  increase  of  related  single  borrower  limits.  In  addition,  the  government, \nthrough the Insurance Commission (IC), revised the regulatory framework to enable  a broader \ndistribution of microinsurance to reach a wider range of clients. Specifically, the new regulations \nallow  licensed  microinsurance  general  agents,  brokers,  cooperative  insurance  societies,  and \nmutual  benefit  associations  to  contract  services  of  microinsurance  providers,  drastically \nincreasing  the  potential  for  opening  new  accounts.  Finally,  Congress  passed  legislation \nestablishing an annual Economic and Financial Literacy Week to increase financial literacy across \nthe country. Under subprogram 2, the government will launch development of the NIS and will \nprovide a road map for the design and introduction of an identification card. The government will \ndevelop and implement a gender-sensitive agriculture finance road map and will roll out a new \nmicroinsurance  scheme  to  increase  coverage,  especially  for  farmers.  A  financial  education \nstocktaking  assessment  will  support  the  development  and  of  an  enhanced  financial  learning \nprogram with tailored approaches for specific population segments, including women and youth. \n \n12. \nInfrastructure for financial inclusion. This reform area reflects the government\u2019s efforts \nto  directly  increase  financial  inclusion  through  investment  in  support  systems  and  support \nnetworks.  Accomplishments  under  subprogram  1  included  the  BSP\u2019s  actions  to  upgrade  the \nnational retail payment system to provide a more varied and a safer means of payment, especially \nfor lower-income customers. As part of the upgrade, the BSP established two clearing houses: \n(i) PESONet,  which  launched  direct  business-to-business  and  customer-to-business  payments \nand  enabled \nthe  digitization  of  government-to-government  and  person-to-government \ntransactions;  and  (ii)  InstaPay,  which  makes  it  easier  and  less  costly  for  individuals  and \n\n                                                \n17 Prior actions are considered loan disbursement conditions, and policy milestones strengthen the program. \n18 ADB. 2016.

In  addition,  the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) integrated microfinance credit information into the \nnational credit information registry, which will expand access to credit for individuals and MSMEs. \nThe government also submitted legislation to Congress to provide an updated legal framework \nfor  a  national  secured  transaction  registry,  which  will  provide  individuals  and  MSMEs  with  the \nability to pledge movable collateral, thereby increasing their access to credit and reducing its cost. \nThe government also completed an action plan to improve the existing credit guarantee schemes \nby consolidating and strengthening their management and governance. Under subprogram 2, the \nBSP will (i) continue enhancing the national retail payment system to support the expansion of \ndigital payments, (ii) issue additional financial technology licenses, and (iii) increase the ability of \nbanks  to  reach  the underserved  through  agents  and  off-premise  cash  and  deposit  services. \nCoverage  of  the  national  credit  information  registry  will  continue  to  increase,  and  the  Land \nRegistration  Authority  will  establish  a  collateral  registry.  Finally,  the  government  will  launch  its \nplan to improve existing credit guarantee schemes. \n \nCapacity  of  financial  service  providers.  This  reform  area  reflects  actions  taken  to \n13. \nimprove the capacity of MNGOs and to expand the reach of rural banks. Accomplishments under \nsubprogram  1  included  the  establishment  of  a  Microfinance  NGO  Regulatory  Council  with  the \nSEC  as  chair.  The  council  subsequently  adopted  accreditation  standards  to  strengthen  the \nfinancial and social performance standards and governance practices of MNGOs. The program \nalso pilot-tested new technological innovations to improve the operational efficiency and outreach \nof  rural  banks.  Finally,  the  government  submitted  legislation to  Congress  to  establish a strong \nlegal and policy framework for the development of Islamic finance to expand access to financial \nservices  in the  ARMM  in  particular.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  council  will  accredit  and monitor \nMNGOs  and provide  training  programs  to  help  build their capacity for  compliance.  Support  for \ntechnical innovation will continue with the mainstreaming of cloud-based core banking solutions \nin  the  banking  industry. The  BSP  will  support  passage  of  legislation, conduct gender-sensitive \nawareness-raising  and capacity-building  campaigns,  and formulate  regulations  for  issuance  of \nsukuk (sharia-compliant bonds). \n \n\n \n\n\f14. \nADB experience. A strong government commitment, complemented by ADB\u2019s support, \nhas  created  a  vibrant  microfinance  industry  and  a  conducive  regulatory  framework.  The  Rural \nMicroenterprise Finance Project laid the foundation for successful microfinance wholesale lending \noperations  and  contributed  to  the  growth  of  microfinance. 19 The  Microfinance  Development \nProgram  improved  the  microfinance  regulatory  environment,  strengthened  regulatory  and \noperational  capacity,  and  implemented  the  national  microfinance  literacy  program. 20  These \nprograms were complemented by the Developing Financial Cooperatives Project, which improved \nthe regulatory environment for credit and savings cooperatives.21 The Developing Microinsurance \nProject helped the government set up a suitable regulatory environment and launch the National \nStrategy for Microinsurance in 2010.22 The Capacity Building for Microinsurance Project produced \nthe  regulatory  framework  necessary  to  support  the  development  of  microinsurance. 23 \nComplementing  this  support,  the  Encouraging  Investment  through  Capital  Market  Reforms \nProgram,  approved  by  ADB  in 2015,  has  supported  reforms  to  deepen  the capital market  and \nexpand the institutional investor base to increase access to long-term finance, opening the door \nfor ADB\u2019s shift to expanding financial inclusion. 24 \n \nLessons learned. ADB\u2019s long engagement in the microfinance sector has informed the \n15. \nprogram  design  through  four  key  lessons.  First,  increasing  broad  access  to  financial  services \nrequires  a  comprehensive  strategy.  This  strategy  must  cover  the  institutional  and  policy \nenvironment, the types and accessibility of products and services offered, the infrastructure and \npayment system, and the capacity of financial service providers. Second, there should be strong \ngovernment  ownership of  the  reforms  and  widespread  political  will  to  implement  them.  This  is \nespecially important considering that certain barriers to financial inclusion (through initiatives such \nas an NIS, credit and collateral registries, and Islamic financial services) have not been addressed \nthrough  earlier  reforms  because  of  the  concerns  of  various  stakeholders.  Third,  pilot  projects \ntesting new strategies through a regulatory \u201csandbox\u201d approach (i.e., a test-and-learn approach) \nrepresent  an  important  part  of  policy  development  and  help  build  stakeholder  support  for \ninstitutional  reforms. 25  Fourth,  building  capacity  should  include  close  ADB  involvement  with \ngovernment and national and local government ownership of interventions. \n \n16. \nADB\u2019s  value addition  to program  design  and  implementation. The  program  design \nbenefited from the explicit commitment of the government through the NSFI. The program also \nincorporates knowledge gained from sustained ADB policy dialogue with key stakeholders as well \nas  previous  and  ongoing  TA  implementation.  Most  recently,  ADB  has  worked  closely  with  the \nBSP  to  identify  priority  areas  of  reform  and  has  helped  identify  ways  to  strengthen  agriculture \nfinance, improve coordination of financial literacy, and explore innovation in the banking sector. \n                                                \n19 ADB. 1996.

Manila. \n\n25 A regulatory \u201csandbox\u201d approach (i.e., a test-and-learn approach) is a framework set up by a finance sector regulator \nto allow small-scale live testing of innovations by private firms in a controlled environment (operating under a special \nexemption, allowance, or other limited, time-bound exception) under the regulator\u2019s supervision. \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fThrough TA support, ADB has built on the lessons learned and is supporting the BSP\u2019s test-and-\nlearn approach with a rural bank in Mindanao by funding the migration of its core banking system \nto  a  cloud-based  core  banking  solution. 26    Based  on  previous  ADB  research,  ADB  TA  is \nsupporting a follow-on assessment to identify how an NIS can accelerate financial inclusion in the \nPhilippines,  particularly  among  the  most  marginalized  population.27 Together,  ADB  and  the  IC \nhave  worked  to  further  develop  microinsurance,  including  exploration  of  public\u2013private \npartnerships  to  expand  agriculture  insurance.  ADB  has  also  worked  closely  with  the  SEC  to \ndevelop financial, social, and governance standards for MNGOs and an accreditation framework \nto  professionalize  and  scale  their  operations.  ADB  is  also  supporting  the  development  of  a \nregulatory framework for Islamic finance.28 \n \n17. \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  Since  2000,  ADB  has  worked  closely  with  the \ngovernment  and  other  development  partners  to  support  the  government\u2019s  goal  of  increasing \nfinancial  inclusion  in  the  Philippines.  Since  2015, the  NSFI  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the \nBSP, has coordinated development partner support. Key development agencies actively involved \nin supporting financial inclusion include Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD). ADB and \nAFD are working closely to align technical assistance to support implementation of the Inclusive \nFinance Development Program. In addition, the AFD is exploring the possibility to provide parallel \ncollaborative  cofinancing  for  subprogram  2.  Other  development  partners  include  German \ndevelopment cooperation through Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit, the \nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC), the International Labor Organization, the United Nations \nDevelopment  Programme,  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  and  the \nWorld Bank. Within this framework, ADB and the World Bank are closely collaborating to support \nimplementation of the NSFI, including an expansion of agriculture finance and insurance. ADB \nhas worked closely with Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit to develop a \nstrong regulatory framework and financial literacy for microinsurance. The IFC has worked with \nthe Credit Information Corporation to establish a credit information system and has supported the \ndevelopment of an updated regulatory framework for secured transactions, including an online \ncollateral registry. ADB and the IFC are collaborating on ways to raise awareness of the credit \nand  collateral  registries.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  has  long \nsupported innovation in the rural banking sector and the promotion of electronic money. Recent \ndiscussions with ADB have focused on coordinated support for Islamic finance in Mindanao.  \n \nC. \n \n18. \nEconomic  impact  of  the  program.  The  program  impact  assessment  estimates  the \npotential net present value of benefits (benefits minus costs) of the program to range from $1.5 \nto $4.6 billion. Benefits arise primarily out of reforms which will increase the number of account \nholders  and  the  average  savings of  the  new  account  holders,  which together  boost GDP. The \npresent value of the costs arise primarily from the adoption of a national identification system. In \naddition  to  the  economic  growth,  the  reforms  supported  by  the  program  yield  other  economic \nbenefits such as a reduction in poverty and increased participation in the formal economy.29 \n \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n                                                \n26 ADB. 2017.

The \nloan will have a 15-year term, including a 3-year grace period, annuity method with 30% discount, \nan annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft loan agreement. The average maturity is 12.1 years, and there is no maturity \npremium  payable  to  ADB. 30 The  loan  size  is  based  on  the  Philippines\u2019  financing  needs,  the \ndevelopment impact of the policy reform package, and development spending arising from the \nreforms. In 2018, the government\u2019s total gross borrowing requirement is estimated at $17.4 billion, \none fifth of which will be from foreign borrowing. The foreign borrowing will comprise government \nbonds estimated at $1.0 billion and official development assistance estimated at $2.5 billion. \n \nE. \n \n20. \nThe Department of Finance (DOF) will be the executing agency with the BSP, Bureau of \nTreasury,  Department  of  Justice,  IC,  Philippine  Statistics  Authority,  and  SEC  as  implementing \nagencies. A steering committee chaired by the DOF, with the implementing agencies as members, \nimplementation  periods  are \nwill  oversee \nMarch 2016\u2014 April 2018  for  subprogram  1  and  May  2018\u2013May  2020  for  subprogram  2.  The \nproceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nthe  program.  The \n\nimplementation  of \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n21. \nSafeguards.  Subprogram  1  will  not  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  affect \nindigenous  people  or  the  environment.  It  is  classified  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples. \n \n22. \nPoverty  and  social.  The  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  program  include  the  central \ngovernment, private stakeholders such as rural banks, financial technology companies, MSMEs, \nindustry  associations,  and  nongovernment  organizations.  The  indirect  beneficiaries  of  the \nprogram  include  investors,  enterprises,  entrepreneurs,  farmers,  workers,  consumers,  and \nvulnerable households. Entrepreneurs, farmers, workers, and poor households will benefit from \na broader range of financial products and services, better access to services by gaining financial \nliteracy,  and  stronger  protection  frameworks  that  boost  resilience  to  shocks.  Subprogram  1  is \ncategorized  as  some  gender  elements,  with  key  gender  actions  including  collection  of  credit \ninformation  disaggregated  by  sex  and  promotion  of  gender  diversity  on  MNGO  boards.  The \nprogram  is  expected  to  generate  benefits  for  women  and  increase  their  access  to  financial \nservices through the development of an NIS (considering that women are less likely than men to \nhave identification documents required to open a bank account) and efforts to strengthen MNGOs, \nwhich predominantly serve women. A gender gap assessment will be conducted through TA to \nstrengthen  the  gender  focus  of  subprogram  2  for  categorization  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. \n \nGovernance.  The  latest  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  assessment \n23. \nconfirmed that three of seven core areas (transparency, policy-based budgeting, asset\u2013liability \n                                                \n30 The loan may be disbursed in one or more installments. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fmanagement) have improved and are now considered strong. Areas of weakness identified in the \nassessment\u2014budget  credibility,  predictability  and  control  in  budget  execution,  and  external \nscrutiny and audit\u2014are being actively addressed by government. The proposed Public Financial \nAccountability Act will help to enforce accountability in the public financial management system \nand  increase  budget  transparency  and  participation.  The  government  is  implementing  a \ncomprehensive results-based anticorruption plan to strengthen the Office of the Ombudsman and \nthe justice subsector, which have achieved positive results. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \n24. \nRisks and mitigating measures. The program has two substantial risks. Public financial \nmanagement is assessed as a substantial risk because of a dispersion of responsibilities among \noversight agencies, weak budget execution, and a lack of transparency. These weaknesses are \nbeing mitigated by government by improvements in transparency, policy-based budgeting, and \naccounting  and  record  keeping.  The  government  has  also  strengthened  the  budget  review \nprocess,  reduced  the  number  and  size  of  special  purpose  funds,  and  institutionalized \ntransparency as a precondition to accessing public funds. A second substantial risk, corruption, \nis  being  mitigated  through  the  Philippines\u2019  Cabinet  Cluster  on  Good  Governance  and \nAnti-Corruption, which has implemented a comprehensive and results-based anticorruption action \nplan. 31 \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n25. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as described in detail  in  the  loan \nagreement.  \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n26. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  loan  would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nthe programmatic approach for the Inclusive Finance Development Program; and \nthe loan of $300,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 1 of the \nInclusive Finance Development Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nin regular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of  15  years, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement \npresented to the Board. \n\n27 August 2018 \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n                                                \n31 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objectives \nResilient and inclusive finance sector achieved (Philippine Development Plan, 2017\u20132022)a \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nEffect of the Reform \nFinancial inclusion \nincreased \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \na.\u2013b World Bank, Global \nFindex Database \n\nPerformance Indicators with \nTargets and Baselines \n\nBy 2022: \na.
