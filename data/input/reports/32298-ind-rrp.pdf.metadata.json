The  main  policy \ninstrument  in  the  power  sector  is  the  National  Electricity  Policy, \nwhich  calls \nrural \nelectrification),  reduced  aggregate  technical  and  commercial \nlosses,  better  cost  recovery,  greater  private  sector  participation, \nfull development of hydropower, use of information technology for \ngreater  operational  efficiencies,  and  protection  of  consumers\u2019 \ninterests.  \n \nThe Electricity Act, 2003 (the Act) is the cornerstone legislation for \nthe  power  sector,  providing  the  legal  framework  for  the  efficient \ndevelopment  of  the  sector.  The  act  is  concerned  primarily  with \nunbundling  of  state  electricity  boards,  open  access,  and \ncompetition. The act also mandates full metering for all consumer \nclasses, multiyear tariff determinations, and tariffs set within 20% \nof the deemed cost of supply, as well as availability-based tariffs \nand 100% rural electrification.  \n \nReform  of \nthe  Madhya  Pradesh  (MP)  power  sector  has \nprogressed  within  the  policy  and  legislative  framework  of  India. \nThe Government of Madhya Pradesh (GOMP) has demonstrated \nits  commitment  to  reforms  and  has  made  encouraging  progress. \nIn December 2001, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved \nthe  Madhya  Pradesh  Power  Sector  Development  Program  that \ncombined program lending with physical investment financing that \naddressed key reform areas. It also increased delivery capacity of \nthe  power  sector,  including  substantial  reduction  in  transmission \nlosses.  \n \nWith  substantial  support  from  ADB\u2019s  program  loan,  restructuring \nof  the  power  sector  was  completed.  Five  companies  were \nestablished  for  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution.  GOMP \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nOverview \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nlevel.  Throughout \n\nthe  reform  process, \n\nachieved  a  comprehensive  financial  restructuring  that  included \ninjecting  equity  and  taking  over  loan  arrears  in  lieu  of  rural \nelectrification  loans  and  subsidies. Transmission  losses,  targeted \nthrough  physical  investments,  were  reduced  to  an  internationally \nthe  MP \nacceptable \nElectricity  Regulatory  Commission  (MPERC)\u2014an  independent, \nstate-level  regulatory  agency\u2014adopted  a  realistic  and  supportive \nposition through its regulatory mechanisms.  \n \nTo facilitate economic growth by increasing electricity supply to its \nurban  and  rural  population,  GOMP  conducted  a  diagnostic \nassessment  of  earlier  reforms  and  physical  investments.  Based \non the diagnostic work, the challenges in the power sector can be \nsummarized as follows:  \n \nGeneration.  MP  has  suffered  from  chronic  peak  capacity  and \nenergy shortages in recent years. The peak deficit has exceeded \n20%  and  the  energy  deficit  consistently  has  been  about  13%  for \nthe past 3 years. Installed capacity in or available to MP is about \n6,300  MW,  with  about  3,000  MW  owned  and  operated  by  the \ngenerating company. Generating capacity available to meet peak \ndemand is significantly less than required to eliminate the energy \ndeficit. Therefore, new physical investments, as well as renovation \nand modernization of existing generating facilities, are essential. \n \nTransmission.  Since  2002, \nlength  has \nincreased  almost  14%,  while  transformation  capacity  has  risen \n41%.  Transmission  losses  have  been  reduced  to  an  acceptable \nlevel of about 5%, and availability of the transmission network has \nexceeded  98%  for  the  past  year.  However,  due  to  continued \ngrowth  in  demand,  the  transmission  capacity  is  inadequate  to \nserve peak demand. During 2006, the transmission system served \nthe highest ever maximum demand of 5,780 MW. Peak demand is \nexpected  to  grow  on  average  at  about  9%  to  2012.  The \ntransmission network will require significant investment if capacity \nis to be increased to match this forecast demand growth.  \n \nDistribution.  GOMP policy targets 100% village electrification by \n2008 and 100% household electrification by 2012. The distribution \nnetwork needs significant investment to reach these targets. Loss \nreduction  and  reliability  improvement  are  also  sector  policy \nimperatives  for  the  distribution  subsector.  Losses  for  distribution \ncompanies  exceed  35%,  and  power  quality  is  poor  due  to \nundersized conductors, long low-voltage circuits, and overloading \nof distribution transformers.  \n \nPrivate  Sector  Participation.  GOMP  recognizes  the  need  for \nfurther  private  sector  participation  to  meet  the  sector\u2019s  overall \nfinancing  requirements  and  to  enhance  operational  efficiencies. \nThrough implementation of power sector reforms under the ADB-\nfinanced  Madhya  Pradesh  Power  Sector  Development  Program \n\ntransmission  circuit \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nto  address \n\n(2001),  GOMP  has  created  the  enabling  environment  for  private \nsector  participation  and  public-private  partnerships \n(PPP). \nHowever, private sector contributions have been slow to develop. \nThe  financial  fragility  of  the  sector  is  perceived  to  be  the  key \nimpediment to private investment. Opportunities for private sector \ninvolvement  include  (i)  electricity  generation  from  renewable  and \nnonrenewable resources, (ii) transmission network ownership and \nleasing,  (iii)  further  distribution  network  franchising  and  leasing, \n(iv)  bilateral  electricity  trading,  and  (v)  maintenance  contracting. \nPilot  distribution  system \nfranchising  schemes  have  been \nimplemented, and some minor maintenance functions have been \noutsourced. In generation, GOMP  has proposals for independent \npower  producer  thermal  projects  in  the  next  5  years  with  a \ncombined  capacity  of  12,000  MW,  although  the  number  of \nprojects  implemented  is  expected  to  be  a  small  subset  of  this \ntotal.   \n \nCapacity  Constraints.  ADB\u2019s  2001  program  loan  included  a \ncapacity  development  component \nthe  policy \nenvironment.  This  assistance  was  successful,  and  GOMP  has \ndemonstrated the capacity to formulate and execute sector policy \nsince  2001.  However,  the  diagnostic  assessment  by  GOMP \ndemonstrated  technical,  commercial,  financial,  and  management \nconstraints  in  the  new  power  sector  companies.  Key  areas \nidentified  include  design  and  implementation  of  a  \u201cbackbone\u201d \nenterprise  resource  planning  system  covering  (i)  billing  and \n(iii)  metering  data \ncollection; \n(ii) \nmanagement, \n(v) \nmaintenance  management;  (vi)  materials  management;  (vii) \nproject  systems;  (viii)  human  resources  and  e-mail  solutions, \ntogether  with  the  appropriate  network  infrastructure  and  support. \nCapacity development also is required to improve the companies\u2019 \ninternal audit and control capability.  \n \nThe  constraint  being  addressed \nthrough  a  comprehensive \nfunctional  support  and  capacity-building  program.  ADB  and  the \nDepartment for International Development of the United Kingdom \n(DFID)  are  partnering  in  capacity  development.  ADB  and  DFID \njointly have supported the MP power sector since the initial stage \nof reforms. DFID is providing \u00a318.5 million $35.2 million as of 21 \nSeptember  2006)  in  technical  assistance  (\u00a314.5  million)  and \nfinancial  assistance  (\u00a34million)  covering  2006\u20132010.  The  DFID \nprogram  under  implementation  across  the  sector  emphasizes  (i) \nmapping  further  reforms  by  supporting  GOMP,  (ii)  capacity \nbuilding  in  MPERC,  and  (iii)  financial  management  and  human \nresources  development  in  all  companies.  In  addition  to  these \nprincipal  areas  of  work,  socioeconomic  impact  studies  also  are \nbeing conducted.  \n \nADB has included an additional $10 million under the investment \nprogram  for  a  selective  capacity  development  program.  This \n\nfinance  and  accounting; \n(iv)  management \n\ninformation  systems; \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nSector Road Map and \nInvestment Program \nDescription \n \n\nprogram  focuses  on  implementation  support  of  Supervisory \nControl and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems in the distribution \ncompanies; and development of a trading and settlements support \nsystem,  metering,  and  communications  for  the  new  trading \ncompany, whose future role is pivotal in the effective commercial \noperation  of  the  reformed  sector.  In  addition,  ADB\u2019s  capacity \ndevelopment program will support energy efficiency activities and \nstrategic PPP.  \n \nKey  constraints,  challenges,  and  opportunities  identified  through \ndiagnostic work paved the way for defining a strategic framework, \na new sector strategy, and action plans over the short to medium \nterm.  The  action  plans  are  sequenced  and  complement \ntransactions  involving  the  private  and  public  sectors.  These  are \nencapsulated  in  a  medium-term  sector  road  map  (2007\u20132012). \nThe  sector  road  map  is  linked  to  a  comprehensive  investment \ninvestments  and  nonphysical \nprogram  covering  physical \ninterventions  in  further  sector  reforms,  capacity  development, \nfiduciary  oversight  and  governance,  knowledge  management, \nsafeguards, procurement, disbursements, project implementation, \nevaluation, supervision, monitoring, and reporting. \n \nPhysical  Investments.  Reserve  Bank  of  India  forecasts  a \nsignificant improvement in MP\u2019s economic performance from 2007 \nto  2012,  which  is  expected  to  drive  strong  growth  in  demand  for \nelectricity. The objective of full household electrification by 2012 is \nexpected to generate further growth in electricity demand. Based \non  consistent  growth  in  the  national  and  state  economy,  and \nmoderate  increases  in  tariffs  to  bring  them  in  line  with  the  true \ncost of supply, unrestricted consumer demand for electricity in MP \nis  forecast  to  increase  by  7%  from  2007  to  2012.  With  energy \nlosses  currently  at  about  41%,  more  than  6,000  MW  of  peak \ngeneration  and  network  capacity  will  have  to  be  added  over  the \nnext 5 years to serve this demand.  \n \nA  coherent  and  realistic  state  and  regional  plan  for  expansion  of \ngeneration capacity is in place with contributions from public and \nprivate  financial  resources.  The  need  to  transmit  an  additional \n6,000  MW  of  peak  power  is  the  main  driver  of  the  investment \nprogram  for  the  transmission  and  distribution  systems.  The \ninvestment program is predicated on building sufficient capacity to \nevacuate  power  from  existing  and  planned  power  stations  and \nsubstations,  and  delivering  power  reliability  and  efficiency  to \nconsumers.  It  also  targets  significant  reductions  in  technical  and \nfor  additional \ncommercial \ncapacity by more than 1,000 MW and returning to a capacity and \nenergy surplus by 2011.  \n \nThe total investment program for the power sector is estimated to \nbe  $5.3  billion  (2007\u20132012),  with  $3.0  billion  needed \nfor \ntransmission  and  distribution.  The  financing  plan  involves  the \n\nlosses,  reducing \n\nthe  requirement \n\n\f  v\n\nin \n\nlosses  and \n\nincreased  capacity \n\nstate  government  budget,  as  well  as  the  private  sector  and \ninstitutions such as ADB. \n \nIn  this  context,  India  requested  ADB  support  for  the  investment \nprogram  in  the  form  of  a  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF). \nSuch  support  provides  a  platform  for  financial  and  expert \nassistance,  blending  reform  and  capacity  development  with \ninvestments.  ADB  support  will  be  extended  for  the  transmission \nand  distribution  segments  of  the  sector  since  a  joint  venture \nbetween  state  and  central  power  utilities,  private  sector \ninvestments,  and  central-level  generating  projects  (e.g.,  ultra \nmega  power  projects)  are  planned  to  eliminate  the  generation \ndeficit.  The  impact  of  the  transmission  component  will  be  further \nreductions \nfor  electricity \ntransmission to meet forecast demand growth. The impact of the \ndistribution component will be reduced technical and nontechnical \nlosses, improved voltage profiles, power quality and reliability, and \nmore efficient revenue collection. \n \nThe  project  component  of  the  earlier  ADB  loan  covered  the \ntransmission and distribution subsectors. The program component \nassisted  GOMP  in  (i)  implementing  key  policy  reforms  and \nestablishing  a  policy  framework,  including  a  fully  operational, \nindependent  state  regulatory  commission;  (ii)  unbundling  the \nMPSEB  into  five  companies;  (iii)  improving  sector  governance \nthrough  more  functional  independence;  and  (iv)  restructuring \ntariffs and issuing new tariff orders that allow revenue realization. \nRemaining policy issues are currently being addressed.  \n \nThe Investment Program will be a logical replication of the project \ncomponent  of  the  previous  ADB  loan,  covering  transmission  and \ndistribution  subsectors  by  taking  into  account  the  interrelated \nnature of the subsectors. Subprojects are designed in a repeater \nnature  in  the  transmission  and  distribution  subsectors,  and  one \nset of project from each subsector is presented in the Report and \nRecommendation of the President. The executing agencies (EAs) \nthe \nhave  gained  substantial  experience \nprevious ADB project.  \n \nThe  MFF  is  particularly  well  suited  for  the  Investment  Program \nbecause  (i)  the  aim  of  the  Investment  Program  is  to  support \nGOMP\u2019s  long-term  objectives,  as  stated  in  the  sector  road  map; \n(ii) the performance of the previous loan can guide the provision of \nsubsequent \nfor \nimplementation;  and  (iii)  the  MFF  can  offer  the  flexibility  required \nfor  the  Investment  Program  to  support  the  participation  of  four \ncompanies with different levels of readiness.   \n \nNonphysical  Investments.

This \nfinancing represents 11.6% of the total financing plan and 20.7% \nof  the  financing  plan  for  the  transmission  and  distribution \nsegment.  The  MFF  will  allow  financing  of  individual  subprojects, \nas projects and conditions warrant, by linking financing to project \nreadiness,  reforms,  capacity,  and  work  on  various  themes.

It is underway for further tranches.  \n \nIndia  has  entered  into  a  financing  framework  agreement  (FFA) \nwith  ADB.  The  FFA  satisfies  the  requirements  established  in \nAppendix 4 of the Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities.  \n \nThe FFA records the full set of warranties and representations of \nADB  operating  policies  and  procedures  on  all  crosscutting \nthemes,  covering  safeguards,  governance,  anticorruption, \nfinancial  management,  procurement,  and  disbursement  and \nsubproject selection criteria. \n \nBefore  ADB  accepts  a  Periodic  Financing  Request  (PFR),  India, \nMP,  and  sector  companies  will  ensure  full  compliance  with  the \nterms  and  conditions  of  the  FFA.  The  capacity  development \ncomponent  will  provide  support  if  necessary.  ADB  teams  will \nevaluate all funding requests, and will ensure that they adhere to \nrepresentations made and will continue to do so. ADB teams will \nprovide  ongoing  guidance  to  the  authorities,  and  make  available \nadditional  experts  under  the  capacity  development  component,  if \nneeded.  ADB  staff  will  inform  the  Government  of  India  (the \nGovernment),  and  report  to  Management,  and  the  Board  on  the \nstatus of individual loans, including the performance on warranties \nand  representations.

This  component \nincludes  construction  of  (i)  2  circuit  kilometers  (cct-km)  of  400   \nkilovolt (kV) and about 1,500 cct-km of 220 kV transmission lines \nacross the state of MP; (ii) eight new 220/132 kV substations, with \ntransformer  capacity  of  160  megavolt-ampere  (MVA)  each;  and \n(iii) one new 400/220/132 kV substation with 315 MVA transformer \ncapacity.  \n \nPFR  2,  Distribution  Efficiency  Enhancement.  The  distribution \ncomponent  will  undertake \n(i)  construction  of  high-voltage \ndistribution  systems  in  six  distribution  circles  in  the  eastern \ndistribution zone of MP, including conversion of about 7,400 km of \nlow-voltage  lines  to  high-voltage  lines;  (ii)  remote  metering  of \nabout 2,000 industrial consumers; (iii) metering of about 250,000 \nconsumers; and (iv) renovation of the protection system at about \n100 substations.  \n \n\n \n\n\fviii \n\n \n\nAmount and Terms \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nRetroactive Financing \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n\n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agencies and \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nThe MFF will provide up to $620 million, secured from the ordinary \ncapital  resources  of  ADB,  with  final  terms  and  conditions  to  be \nestablished under individual loan agreements based on prevailing \nADB policies.  \n \nPursuant to the FFA, the Government has submitted two PFRs to \nADB totaling $151 million for Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 to finance \ntransmission  and  distribution  subprojects.  Both  PFRs  are \npresented to the Board with the MFF and the FFA. Tranche 1 and \nTranche  2  loans  will  have  a  principal  repayment  period  of  20 \nyears,  not  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years.  However,  each \nfuture  tranche  may  be  financed  under  terms  different  from  the \nfinancing terms of previous or subsequent tranches. Financing will \nbe  made  available  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The Government can choose from \neligible  currencies  and  interest  rate  regimes,  which  can  change \nwith  each  loan.  Currency  and  interest  rate  swaps  will  be  made \navailable  during  the  financing  period.  Repayment  schedules  can \nbe structured to satisfy the needs of individual loans.  \n \nEach tranche under the MFF would be at least $40 million, except \nfor  the  nonphysical  investments  component,  which  would  have  a \nminimum loan amount of $5 million.  \n \nThe Government will make loans available to GOMP on the same \nterms  and  conditions  as  the  ones  applicable  to  the  Government. \nGOMP  will  onlend  to  sector  companies,  as  the  EA,  with  a  1 \npercentage  point \nrespective  onlending \nagreements. \n \nRetroactive  financing  may  be  possible  under  individual  loans  for \nexpenditures  incurred  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the \ncorresponding loan agreement, with a ceiling of up to 20% of the \nloan amount, in accordance with the Board paper on Cost Sharing \nand  Eligibility  of  Expenditures  for  Asian  Development  Bank \nFinancing:  A  New  Approach.  The  Government,  GOMP,  and  EAs \nhave been informed that approval of advance procurement action \nand retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing any of \nthe  proposed  subprojects.  Each  PFR  will  specify  the  nature  of \nexpenditure if retroactive financing is requested. \n \nUntil 30 June 2015, with the last PFR submission by 31 December \n2010. \n \n31 December 2014. \n\nthrough \n\nspread, \n\n \nThe EAs will be Madhya Pradesh Power Transmission Company \nLimited  (TRANSCO),  Madhya  Pradesh  Madhya  Kshetra  Vidyut \nVitaran  Company  Limited  (DISCOM-C),  Madhya  Pradesh  Poorv \nKshetra  Vidyut  Vitaran  Company  Limited  (DISCOM-E),  Madhya \n\n\f \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\nix\n\nPradesh  Paschim  Kshetra  Vidyut  Vitaran  Company  Limited \n(DISCOM-W), and the Madhya Pradesh Power Trading Company \nLimited (TRADECO). \n \nThe  EAs  will  be  guided  by  a  coordinating  committee  chaired  by \nthe  chairman  and  managing  director  of  TRANSCO,  who  has \nextensive  experience  at  major  project  delivery  and \nloan \ndisbursement  through  an  earlier  ADB  loan.  This  approach  will \nensure  the  sharing  of  best  practices  within  the  state.  The  EA  for \nthe energy efficiency component will be identified in the future. \n \nThe Government will be responsible for the implementation of the \nMFF  and  loans  in  accordance  with  the  FFA  and  individual  loan \nagreements. \n \nThe  Energy  Department \n(ED)  of  GOMP  handles  overall \ninvestment  program  management  in  MP.  Based  on  national \npolicies,  the  Energy  Department  formulates  state  power  sector \npolicies,  road  map,  and  long-term  investment  plan.  It  also  is \nresponsible for creating an enabling environment for private sector \ninvestment  in  the  state.  The  ED  will  monitor  and  evaluate  the \nimplementation of the approved investment program and report it \nto Ministry of Power. \n \nMPERC will take part in monitoring since it conducts due diligence \nfor  all  investment  proposals  and  reviews  detailed  project  reports \nfrom  the  state  power  companies  or  private  sector  before  warrant \napproval.   \n \nOnce  an  investment  program  is  approved,  the  companies  will \nimplement  and  be  responsible  for  it.  They  also  will  oversee \nprofessionally  and  efficiently  the  investment  operations  planned \nover the next few years. The staff of all power sector companies \nhas acquired substantial experience, including management skills \nand  systems  in  the  previous  ADB-financed  project.  Teams  have \nbeen  set  up  to  conduct  best  practices  in  technical,  financial, \nproject management, procurement, and environmental and social \nsafeguards. Evaluation, monitoring, and reporting systems will be \npart of the work. \n \nProcurement to be financed under the MFF will be undertaken in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines,  (2006,  as \namended  from  time  to  time),  and  will  be  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (e.g.,  environmentally \nresponsible procurement).  International  competitive  bidding  (ICB) \nwill  be  used  for  supply  and  construction  of  the  facilities  being \nfunded  under  the  investment  program  (substations,  transmission \nlines,  equipment,  and  transformers,  etc.).  ICB  will  be  utilized  for \nsupply contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of or more than \n$1  million.  Limited  international  bidding  or  national  competitive \nbidding  will  be  used  for  supply  contracts  estimated  at  $250,000\u2013\n\n \n\n\fx \n\n \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries of the \nFacility \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n$1  million,  and  shopping  for  contracts  estimated  at  less  than \n$250,000.  Contract  packages  will  be  prepared \nto  ensure \nmaximum competition under ICB.  \n \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2006,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  Consulting  firms  will  be  chosen  through \ninternational  competition  using \nthe  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  method.  Individual  experts  may  be  recruited  following \nADB\u2019s procedures for engagement of individual consultants based \non resume submitted in response to specific terms of reference for \nthe assignment. \n \nThe MFF is designed to benefit all grid-connected consumers with \nadequate and reliable supply of electricity. This would support the \nGovernment\u2019s projections for growth in energy demand, as well as \nits plan to make affordable grid-based electricity supplies available \nto  the  entire  population  by  2012.  Substantial  investments  in \nrehabilitation,  augmentation,  and  expansion  of \nthe  power \ntransmission  system  will  increase  reliability  of  supply  to  the \nresidential,  agricultural,  commercial,  and  industrial  consumers \nwithin the state of MP. A secure and predictable electricity supply \nwill  enable  social  and  economic  benefits  to  materialize,  and  will \nensure  improved  conditions  for  schools,  hospitals,  and  other \nsocial services. At the state level, the economic and financial cost \nof  supplying  electricity  will  be  reduced  by  directly  addressing \ninherent inefficiencies. \n \nThe  investment  program  will  enable  urban  and  rural  domestic \nconsumers  to  receive  a  supply  of  electricity  at  an  acceptable \nvoltage  level,  and  with  minimal  scheduled  and  unscheduled \noutages.  Rural  consumers  in  particular  will  see  a  significantly \nimproved  electricity  supply,  unaffected  by  the  lengthy  scheduled \noutages  that  are  currently  experienced.  This  will  have  positive \noutcomes  for  educational  and  social  activities,  and  will  open  up \nopportunities  for  energy-dependent  rural  enterprises.  Industrial \nand commercial consumers also will benefit from improved supply \nreliability  and  quality,  thereby  enhancing  production  and  output \nand  reducing  equipment  failures.  In  addition,  the  investment \nprogram  will  create  short-term  and \nlong-term  employment \nopportunities and tax revenues. \n \nThe  MFF  is  accompanied  by  some  risks,  particularly  cost \noverruns,  commissioning  delays,  investment  timing  mismatches, \nand  stalled  sector  reforms.  Given  the  cost-plus  tariff  setting \nmechanism  employed  in  MP  and  in  other  Indian  states,  cost \noverruns can be passed through to consumers. If tariff increases \nare  substantial,  the  demand  growth  upon  which  the  investment \nprogram  is   predicated  could  be  constrained,  undermining  the \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\n \nWarranties and \nRepresentations \n\n \n\n \n\nxi \n\nto  be  small.  Cost  projections  are \n\n \neconomic  and  financial  viability  of  investments.  This  risk  is \nthorough  and \ndeemed \nconservative, and have been based on a basket of tender prices \nsubmitted over the past 12 months. Moreover, turnkey contracting \nwill be used where appropriate, thereby transferring a large part of \nprice  and  implementation  risk to turnkey contractors. Investment \ncomponents are interrelated to some extent. Benefits expected to \nflow from one component might be reduced if commission delays \nare experienced in other components. Such risk will be contained \nand  managed  through  contractual  mechanisms  that  include \nprovisions for liquidated damages when commissioning delays are \nthe  fault  of  contractors.  Sufficient  slippage  provision  will  be  built \ninto \nthe  risk  of \nthe  control  of  contractors. \ncommissioning  delays  outside \nTRANSCO\u2019s experience in managing and disbursing major loans \nand capital programs provides further comfort. \nCapacity  building  and  public  policy  reform  are  essential  to  the \nlong-term  growth  and  sustainability  of  the  sector.  The  risk  of  a \nslowdown  or  reversal  in  the  reform  process  is  very  unlikely.  The \nGovernment and GOMP remain committed to the reform process \nas a secure and reliable power supply is viewed as a key enabler \nfor economic growth and poverty reduction.  \n\nimplementation  program \n\nto  minimize \n\nthe \n\n(iv) \n\nand \n\nfiduciary \n\noversight; \n\n \nMP has a well-defined power sector road map, a clear investment \nthe  people  and \nand  capacity  development  program,  and \ninstitutions to deliver on the objectives and targets. The provision \nof  ADB  finance  through  an  MFF  requires  an  agreement  on  key \nwarranties  and  representations,  which  are  intended  to  ensure \nprogram  success.  The  FFA  captures  critical  provisions  for  ADB \nfinancing,  including  (i)  subproject  eligibility  criteria;  (ii)  selection, \nand implementation, capacity building, safeguards framework; (iii) \nfinancial \nprocurement  and  disbursement  procedures; \n(v)  monitoring, \nmanagement \nadministration, and reporting.  \n \nADB will provide direct support to the EAs responsible for program \nimplementation, from headquarters and through the India Resident \nMission.  A  program  support  office  has  been  established  that  will \ncoordinate  specific  implementation  tasks,  including  procurement, \nsubproject  management,  monitoring,  and  supervision.  The  office \nwill  comprise  professional,  experienced  staff,  especially  in  the \nareas  of  safeguards,  financial  management,  administration,  and \nreporting.  Although  an  MFF  can  be  a  flexible  instrument  for  the \nauthorities, its viability requires a strong local presence and quality \nresources allocated to implementation.   \n \nEach  new  financing  request  to  be  converted  into  a  new  loan  will \nrequire an evaluation of the performance of the previous one. ADB \nwill  conduct  periodic  review  missions,  which  will  include  due \ndiligence  on  warranties  and  representations  made  to  ADB.  In \naddition,  staff  will  report  on  any  issues  or  problems  faced  by  the \nauthorities  and  the  EAs  under  the  program,  and  the  remedial \nactions suggested to overcome them. \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to India for the Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Investment \nProgram (Investment Program). Design and Monitoring Framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nBackground, Performance Indicators, and Analysis \n\n2. \nIndia  faces  formidable  challenges  in  achieving  balanced  infrastructure  development, \nwhere  the  provision  of  adequate  energy  plays  an  essential  role  in  reducing  poverty  through \nsustainable  economic  growth.  The  Government  of  India  (the  Government)  has  confirmed  its \n\u201cPower for All\u201d initiative to provide universal power supply by 2012, which will require 100,000 \nmegawatt (MW) of new generation capacity and related transmission and distribution facilities. \nCognizant  of  the  vast  impact  on  the  global  environment  and  energy  security,  the  Government \ndeveloped  the  Integrated  Energy  Policy 1 .  The  policy  encapsulates  the  vision  to  meet  the \ndemand for energy services of all sectors reliably with safe, clean, and convenient energy in a \ntechnically  efficient,  economically  viable,  and  environmentally  sustainable  manner.  The \nIntegrated  Energy  Policy  provides  for  specific  measures,  including  (i)  optimizing  the  power \nsupply mix through greater use of indigenous hydropower resources and renewable energy; (ii) \npursuing  technologies  that  maximize  energy  efficiency,  demand-side  management,  and \nconservation;  and  (iii)  continuing  related  power  sector  reforms  to  control  technical  and \ncommercial  losses  of  the  state  transmission  and  distribution  utilities,  with  the  restructuring \nsupported by the Accelerated Power Development and Reform Program.  \n \n3. \nThe past poor performance of state electricity boards was a roadblock to private sector \ninvestment.  In  2001,  the  Government  adopted  a  program  of  unbundling,  open  access,  tariff \nrestructuring, and rationalization. An independent central regulatory body was established, and \nthe  formation  of  state-level  regulatory  bodies  was  made  mandatory.  The  Electricity  Act,  2003 \nwas  intended  to  improve  governance  in  the  power  sector  through  continued  institutional \nrestructuring  and  improved  management  of  sector  entities  to  ensure  long-term  sustainability. \nCompulsory metering, open access to transmission systems, facilitation of power trading, lifeline \ntariff  for  the  poor  and  rural  consumers  and  rationalization  of  tariffs  have  been  initiated. \nSeparation of generation, transmission, and distribution has been made obligatory. The Central \nElectricity  Regulatory  Commission  has  prescribed  detailed  rules  for  cost  accounting  and \nallowable  tariffs.  Further,  the  Electricity  Act,  2003  mandated  full  metering  for  all  consumer \nclasses, multiyear tariffs (MYT), tariffs to be within 20% of the deemed cost of supply by 2012, \navailability-based tariffs, and 100% rural electrification. \n \nPower  sector  reforms  (Appendix  2)  in  Madhya  Pradesh  (MP),  which  began  in  2001, \n4. \nreceived additional impetus from the Electricity Act, 2003, and have accelerated in the past two \nyears.  The  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  (GOMP)  has  demonstrated  its  commitment  to \nreforms and has made encouraging progress. In December 2001, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  approved  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Power  Sector  Development  Program  (MPPSDP),  which \nhad a $150 million program component and a $200 million project component. The objectives of \nthe  program  component  were  to  (i)  establish  independent  regulation,  (ii)  improve  sector \ngovernance through institutional and organizational actions, (iii) establish and begin operations \nof  new  sector  companies,  (iv)  reduce  system  losses,  and (v)  increase  the  delivery  capacity  of \nthe  power  system.  With  substantial  support  from  ADB\u2019s  program  loan,  unbundling  has  been \n\n                                                 \n1   Planning Commission, Government of India, 2006. Integrated Energy Policy. India \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ncompleted, all sector companies have been given cost-reflective tariffs that will gradually move \nto full cost recovery, and capacity is being developed in all companies to operate in the evolving \ncommercial and competitive sector.  \n \nFollowing the unbundling of the Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board (MPSEB), five \n5. \npower  sector  companies  have  been  incorporated:  MP  Power  Generating  Company  Limited \n(GENCO),  MP  Power  Transmission  Company  Limited  (TRANSCO),  and  three  distribution \ncompanies (DISCOMs2). GENCO has been vested with MP\u2019s electricity generation assets and \nhas  taken  over  their  operation.  TRANSCO  has  become  the  sole  transmission  company  in  the \nstate.  The  three  DISCOMs  have  taken  over  the  distribution  and  supply  activities  in  three \ngeographic  areas  (east,  central,  and  west).  In  June  2005,  the  companies  started  to  operate \nindependently.  The  formation  of  the  MP  Power  Trading  Company  Limited  (TRADECO)  was \nannounced in June 2006 for the bulk procurement of electricity from generators in order to sell \nto  DISCOMs.  All  power  purchase  agreements  for  which  MPSEB  was  the  purchasing \ncounterparty have been transferred to TRADECO. To provide an avenue for sector companies \nto  reach  financial  sustainability,  GOMP  undertook  sector  financial  restructuring  that  included \ninjecting  equity  and  taking  over  loan  arrears  in  lieu  of  rural  electrification  loans  and  subsidy \narrears in 2005\u20132006. MPSEB will remain in place until the successor entities have built enough \ncapacity to handle their own corporate affairs and financial management.  \n \nThroughout  the  reform  process,  the  MP  Electricity  Regulatory  Authority  (MPERC),  an \n6. \nindependent,  state-level  regulatory  agency  formed  in  1999,  has  adopted  a  realistic  and \nsupportive  position  through  its  regulatory  mechanisms.  In  2001,  it  issued  its  first  tariff  orders \n(Supplementary  Appendix  A)  for  all  sector  companies\u2014offtake  tariffs  for  GENCO,  allowable \ncosts  and  returns  for  TRANSCO,  and  uniform  retail  tariffs  for  DISCOMs.  In  September  2002, \nMPERC introduced a time-of-day tariff applicable to some classes of consumers. Between 2001 \nand 2004, a single 1-year tariff was ordered. In the revised tariff philosophy of December 2003, \nMPERC proposed to determine a full-cost tariff for all consumer categories with the objective of \nensuring that the sector companies receive enough income to cover expenditures and provide a \nreasonable return on assets. In March 2006, MPERC passed the first MYT orders for generation \nand transmission covering 2007\u20132009. However, the distribution retail tariff order still covered a \nsingle  year,  2007.  The  first  multiyear  retail  tariff  will  cover  2008\u20132010.  DISCOMs  filed  MYT \napplications on 31 October 2006 to be effective as on 1 April 2007.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  and  GOMP\u2019s  main  objective  for  the  power  sector  is  increasing \n7. \nelectricity  supply  to  its  urban  and  rural  population  to  facilitate  economic  growth.  Based  on \ndiagnostic  work  undertaken  by  GOMP,  achieving  this  objective  in  MP  faces  the  following \nchallenges (Appendix 3):  \n \n\n1. \n\nSector Constraints  \n\n8. \nGeneration.  Installed  capacity  in  or  available  to  MP  is  about  6,300  MW,  with  about \n3,000  MW  owned  and  operated  by  GENCO.  Less  than  100  MW  of  net  installed  generating \ncapacity  has  been  added  in  MP  in  the  past  5  years.  However,  plant  utilization  has  increased \nfrom 63% in 2002 to more than 70% in 2006, which has helped in meeting the growth in energy \ndemand during this period. Electricity demand is estimated to have grown at an average of 5% \n\n                                                 \n2 Madhya Pradesh Madhya Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Limited (DISCOM-C), Madhya Pradesh Poorv Kshetra \nVidyut Vitaran Company Limited (DISCOM-E), Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Limited \n(DISCOM-W). \n\n \n\n\fover the same period, whereas actual sales have increased by more than 7% on average. The \nsupply-demand balance is now critical. MP has suffered from chronic peak capacity and energy \nshortages  in  recent  years.  The  peak  deficit  has  exceeded  20%  and  the  energy  deficit \nconsistently has been about 13% for the past 3 years. Annual energy demand is estimated to \nexceed supply by more than 13% in 2007, and is forecast to grow by approximately 7% through \n2012. \n \n \n9. \nInvestments  in  capacity  are  planned  to  remove  the  peak  deficit  by  2012.  The  bulk  of \nplanned generation capacity expansion will be coal-fired thermal plants, reflecting the availability \nof coal to MP, relatively short project development cycle, and low development risk of coal-fired \nplants.  Approximately  800  MW  of  additional  hydropower  capacity  is  planned,  primarily  as \npeaking  plants.  Development  of  planned  generation  expansion  will  be  shared  equally  by  the \nstate,  central,  and  private  sectors.  The  current  portfolio  of  MP  state  projects,  which  are  under \nconstruction or in the planning phase, are all thermal-based. These are expected to increase the \ninstalled capacity by approximately 700 MW by the end of 2007. Private sector contributions will \ncome through competitively bid and greenfield projects. Private sector projects are expected to \nbe predominantly coal-fired thermal plants. MP will receive an allocation from the central sector \nand  joint  venture  hydropower  and  thermal  projects  that  are  in  development,  including  the  500 \nMW Omkareshwar hydropower project. MP also will receive an allocation of approximately 400 \nMW  of  new  capacity  from  the  Kawas  and  Gandhar  gas-based  projects.  In  addition,  the \nGovernment  is  developing  ultra  mega  power  projects  under  tariff-based  competitive  bidding. \nThese  projects  will  meet  the  power  needs  of  some  states,  including  MP,  through  the \ntransmission of power regionally and nationally. MP has consented to take 12,000 MW based \non the power securing agreement with the Ministry of Power. \n \n10. \nTransmission. Since 2002, transmission circuit length has increased almost 14%, while \ntransformation capacity has risen 41%. Consequently, transmission losses have been reduced \nto an acceptable level of about 5%, and availability of the transmission network has exceeded \n98% for the past year. However, transmission capacity within MP is inadequate to serve peak \ndemand  due  to  continued  growth  in  demand.  An  (n-1)  security  level  is  used  for  transmission \nplanning. 3   Investment  in  the  transmission  network  has  not  matched  the  consistently  high \ndemand growth in recent years, which means that supply security is significantly less than (n-1) \nfor  parts  of  the  transmission  network\u2014in  other  words  failure  of  a  major  network  component \nmight necessitate load shedding. \n \n11. \nDistribution.  In  broad  terms,  the  distribution  system  is  the  primary  bottleneck  in \nelectricity delivery in MP.  It is characterized by high ratios of Low Voltage (LV) circuit length to \nMedium  Voltage  (MV)  circuit  length  (about  64%  in  central  and  east  zones,  and  47%  in  west \nzone), overloaded power transformers (20% of all power transformers were overloaded at some \nstage  in  2005),  and  overloaded  distribution  transformers  (10%  of  all  distribution  transformers \nwere overloaded at some stage in 2005). By most measures, the MP distribution system suffers \nfrom  such  a  severe  capacity  shortage  that  it  is  incapable  of  providing  adequate  quality  and \nreliability  of  supply  to  all  customers.  Safety  is  compromised  on  the  networks  of  the  three \nDISCOMs  due  to  shoddy  installation  of  equipment  and  inadequate  maintenance  practices. \nLosses arising from poorly executed connections at distribution transformers exceed standards.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSystem Losses \n\nThe high network losses (Supplementary Appendix B ) are a pressing energy efficiency \n12. \nissue for MP. Previous investments have successfully targeted transmission losses, which are \n                                                 \n3   Supply can be maintained to all customers with the outage of one major item of equipment. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nnow  about  5%.  As  this  is  a  reasonable  level  for  a  transmission  network,  only  minor  further \nimprovements are anticipated. Distribution network losses in many areas are 40%\u201345%, which \nis  unacceptably  high.  Comparing  the  DISCOMs  with  a  notional  international  benchmark \ndistribution  network  indicates  that\u2014after  correction  for  different  system  characteristics,  load \nfactor, and energy supplied\u2014a reasonable target for technical distribution losses in MP is about \n19%.  DISCOMs  and  MPERC  have  agreed  on  loss  reduction  targets,  which  form  part  of \ndistribution  tariff  determinations.  DISCOMs  will  be  penalized  financially  if  they  fail  to  achieve \nthese targets, and will be rewarded if they exceed the targets. The distribution component of the \nMFF  will  address  losses,  among  other  things.  The  high-voltage  distribution  system  (HVDS) \nsubproject in particular will impact directly technical and nontechnical losses. Other measures, \nsuch  as  consumer  and  distribution  transformer  metering,  will  help  in  identifying  and  isolating \nlosses. As a result, MPERC will be able to more accurately measure and report on the technical \nperformance of DISCOMs. Incorrect and manipulated meter reading for high-value customers is \nsuspected  of  causing  significant  commercial  losses,  and  remote  metering  of  these  customers \nwill address the issue.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPrivate Participation \n\nThrough  its  National  Electricity  Policy  (NEP) 4,  and  in  keeping  with  open  access  and \n13. \nother  provisions  in  the  Electricity  Act,  2003,  the  Central  Electricity  Authority  (CEA)  has  stated \nthat  private  participation  in  the  sector  is  desirable  and  is  to  be  encouraged.  GOMP  has  been \ncognizant  of  the  need  for  further  private  sector  participation  to  meet  the  sector\u2019s  financing \nrequirements  and  to  enhance  operational  efficiencies.  ADB  and  GOMP  has  continued  policy \ndialogue  since  processing  the  MPPSDP  in  2001,  and  agreed  that  further  private  sector \nparticipation would be a critical medium-term objective. Through implementation of power sector \nreforms  under  MPPSDP,  GOMP  has  created  enabling  environments  for  private  sector \nparticipation  and  public-private  partnerships  (PPP).  In  2005,  MPERC  defined  the  terms  and \nconditions for intrastate open access in MP with the intention of further enabling private sector \nparticipation in the generation and retail subsectors (Supplementary Appendix C). Despite these \ninitiatives, the private sector is not yet playing a major role in the MP power sector. The financial \nfragility  of  the  sector  is  perceived  to  be  the  main  impediment  to  private  investments.  ADB\u2019s \nintervention  has  the  potential  improve  the  sector\u2019s  financial  viability,  so  that  the  private  sector \nincreasingly will see investment reward as commensurate with risk and will begin to participate \nas intended under federal and state policy. \n \n14. \nIn generation, GOMP has proposals for independent power producer thermal projects in \nthe  next  5  years  with  a  combined  capacity  of  12,000  MW,  although  the  number  of  projects \nimplemented  is  expected  to  be  a  small  subset  of  this  total.  The  first  project  is  in  the  bidding \nphase,  and  15  private  investors  have  been  short-listed.  In  addition,  further  opportunities  in \nrenewable energy generation\u2014small to medium  hydroelectric, wind, and biomass\u2014abound. In \ntransmission,  opportunities  for  PPP  include  outsourcing  operation  and  maintenance.  In \ndistribution, DISCOMs are piloting franchising schemes for rural distribution systems. They also \nare  exploring  a  strategic  partnership  schemes  in  urban  distribution  systems  for  achieving  the \nrequisite  reduction  in  distribution  losses,  as  well  as  improving  the  quality  of  service  to \nconsumers.  To  this  end,  GOMP  has  started  a  scoping  exercise  with  ADB  involving  potential \ninvestors and other stakeholders.   \n\n \n15. \nEnergy  efficiency  initiatives  are  another  area  where  PPPs  might  play  a  key  role \n(Supplementary Appendix C). The private sector is expected to participate in the establishment \nof an Energy Conservation Fund (ECF) as financier, fund operator, and financing recipient. The \n                                                 \n4 Ministry of Power. Government of India, 2005. National Electricity Policy. India. \n\n \n\n\fECF  could  provide  technical  assistance  for  project  development,  as  necessary.  The  fund  also \ncould  help  finance  revenue-generating  energy  efficiency  projects  implemented  mainly  by  the \nprivate  sector  and  through  PPP  schemes,  Energy  Service  Company  (ESCOs),  power \ndevelopers,  and  other  entities,  including  community-owned  energy  service  providers.  ADB\u2019s \ndirect participation would open the opportunity for additional credit enhancements in the form of \npartial  credit  guarantees,  and  cofinancing  from  new  carbon  and  energy  efficiency  funds \nexpected  to  be  operational  by  2007  and  2008.  ADB  participation  in  the  fund  also  would  add \nsubstantial  value  to  the  MFF  proposal  as  it  presents  innovative  financing,  mobilizes  private \nparticipation,  and  could  capitalize  on  carbon  credit  opportunities.  Design  and  operational \nprocedures of the ECF, which are mandated under the Energy Conservation Act 2001, will be \ndetailed following due diligence for Tranche 4 of the MFF.  \n \n\n4. \n\nFinancial Sustainability of the Sector \n\n16. \nAchieving financial sustainability of the sector is a key objective of GOMP power sector \nreforms.  Sustainability  currently  is  undermined  by  energy  inefficiency,  specifically  the  level  of \ntechnical  and  nontechnical  losses  in  the  distribution  subsector.  In  addition  to  reducing  these \nlosses,  systematic  billing  and  collection  by  distribution  companies,  payments  of  intercompany \nobligations, and timely remittance of subsidies by the Government are essential for the financial \nsustainability of the sector.  \n \n17. \nBefore  the  sector  reforms,  MPSEB\u2019s  financial  position  was  critical  due  to  inadequate \ntariffs, nonremunerative investments in rural electrification schemes to meet social obligations, \ndelays  in  tariff  subsidy  from  GOMP,  and  high  commercial  and  technical  losses  in  the \ntransmission  and  distribution  networks.  To  meet  cash  flow  requirements,  MPSEB  has  been \ndefaulting  on  payment  obligations  to  its  suppliers  and  lenders  by  reducing  capital investments \nand pursuing suboptimal repair and maintenance practices. Following the unbundling of MPSEB \nin 2002, GOMP prepared a financial restructuring plan (FRP) with the objective of restoring the \nsector\u2019s financial sustainability. Sector companies began operating independently in June 2005. \nIn line with this, GOMP undertook financial restructuring of the sector, which included injecting \nequity  and  taking  over  loan  arrears  and  rural  electrification  loans  in  lieu  of  subsidy  arrears  in \n2005\u20132006. GOMP is updating the FRP to reflect the results of the financial restructuring and to \nmap further reforms in the sector. However, shortfalls in sector revenues are likely to continue \nfor  next  3  to  5  years  as  a  result  of  high  distribution  losses.  In  this  context,  targeted  loss-\nreduction investments are critical to bring the cost of supply in line with average retail tariffs by \nthe  end  of  the  Eleventh  Plan  (2008\u20132012),  and  to  achieve  sector  profitability  and  eventually \nfinancial sustainability.   \n \n18. \nGOMP  continues  to  extend  subsidies  to  various  customer  groups,  such  as  domestic \nconsumers  and  small  farmers  (for  irrigation).  However,  GOMP  is  reducing  progressively  the \nnumber  of  categories  and  the  level  of  subsidies  to  be  paid.  Currently,  power  sector  subsidies \nare reflected as a line item in the state budget. Sector companies collect development cess of \n10  paisa  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  and  electricity  dues  on  behalf  of  GOMP.  Rather  than  pass \nthese through to GOMP, they are set off against electricity tariff subsidies. In this way, subsidies \nare  not  paid  upfront.  Instead,  the  companies  deduct  subsidy  payments  before  they  remit  the \ncash to the MPSEB.    \n \n19.  MPERC  is  determining  tariffs  in  compliance  with  the  NEP  of  CEA.  The  tariff  orders \nsupport  the  rationalization  of  operating  costs  and  the  commercialization  of  overall  system \noperations. Most importantly, the tariff orders reflect the official viewpoint that electric power will \nbe provided on a cost-of-supply basis, and that all consumers will pay for electric service. Tariffs \ninclude consideration of good governance, financial sustainability, distributive justice, economic \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nefficiency,  and  fair  pricing.  They  also  are  consistent  with  ADB  guidance.  In  2006,  MPERC \npassed a distribution and retail tariff order for 2007, as well as the first MYT order for generation \nand transmission covering 2007\u20132009. MPERC allowed TRANSCO to base its tariff on full cost \nrecovery  of  loan  capital,  depreciation,  return  on  equity,  operation  and  maintenance  expenses, \nadministrative  and  general  expenses,  repairs  and  maintenance  expenses,  interest  on  working \ncapital,  MPERC  fee,  and  income  taxes.  With  the  proper  implementation  of  the  tariff  policy, \nTRANSCO  is  projected  to  maintain  profitability,  while  DISCOM-E  is  expected  to  achieve \nprofitability by 2008.  \n \n\n5. \n\nCapacity Development \n\n20. \nThe  early  stages  of  reform  led  to  the  creation  of  successor  companies  that  have \nassumed  operating  responsibilities  for  generation,  transmission,  distribution,  and  recently \ntrading. They have inherited assets, liabilities, procedures, systems, and the work regime from \nMPSEB. Staff have been allocated to the new companies on an \u201cas is where is\u201d basis. Boards \nhave been appointed. Below this level, organization structures in the new companies have been \nevolving.  Concerns  have  been  raised  that  earlier  efforts  to  contain  costs  in  the  loss-incurring \nMPSEB have led to shortages of skills in strategically significant disciplines and work areas. In \naddition,  sector  companies  in  the  transition  phase  face  resource  constraints  for  financial \nmanagement and reporting, as well as for enhancing their internal audit and control capability.  \n \n21. \nRecognizing  these  constraints,  GOMP  included  a  $45  million  nonphysical  investment \ncomponent  for  capacity  development  to  support  physical  investments.  Department  for \nInternational  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom  (DFID)  is  providing  assistance5  for  further \ncapacity  development,  specifically  in  financial  management,  technical  planning,  and  human \nresources  development,  as  well  as  in  commercial  areas.  DFID  assistance,  which  will  cover \n2006\u20132010,  will  complement  ADB\u2019s  physical  investments  included  under  the  MFF.  ADB  also \nincluded  an  additional  $10  million  under  the  MFF  for  capacity  development  to  support  energy \nefficiency  activities,  such  as  the  establishment  of  ECF  and  other  energy  efficiency  initiatives, \ne.g., Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The funds also will support information technology \nand  management  information  systems  (MIS)6  for  TRADECO  that  are  not  covered  under  the \nDFID program. Since the initial stage of reforms, ADB and DFID have supported jointly the MP \npower sector.  \n \n22. \nFrom  2002  to  2006,  ADB  (Supplementary  Appendix  D)  helped  GOMP  (i)  improve  the \npolicy environment and governance of the sector, (ii) initiate the establishment of a commercial \nand competitive business environment to promote efficiency gains and loss reduction, and (iii) \nintroduce  a  computerized  information  and  revenue  management  system.  The  Canadian \nInternational  Development  Agency  worked  with  ADB  from  2002  to  2004,  providing  extensive \nsupport  for  the  development  of  financial  restructuring  plans,  as  well  as  the  assessment  of \npension fund liabilities. From 2002 to 2005, DFID provided complementary support to the reform \nprocess  through  detailed  needs  assessments  for  accounting  and  information  and  technology \nsystems  for  the  successor  companies.  DFID\u2019s  capacity  development  assistance  covers  (i) \ndefining  the  commercial  relation  ships  between  sector  companies,  including  market  operation \nsupport during the transition to the new market mechanisms, energy billing arrangements, and \npreparation  of  PPAs;  (ii)  financial  management  through  setting  financial  policies,  cost  and \nrevenue centers, planning, modeling, controls, and reporting; (iii) accounting systems, including \n\n                                                 \n5   DFID is providing \u00a318.5 million in technical  assistance (\u00a314.5 million) and financial assistance (\u00a34.0 million) from \n\n6  A needs assessment will be conducted to design the capacity building component for TRADECO. Therefore, this \n\ncomponent will be included in the third tranche that is scheduled for April 2008. \n\n2006 to 2010. \n\n \n\n\fspecification  of  long-term  accounting  requirements  and  preparation  of  chart  of  accounts;  (iv) \nhuman  resource  strategies,  needs  assessment,  organizational  structure,  and  development  of \nrecruitment  procedures  and  supporting  mechanisms  (e.g.,  job  descriptions);  (v)  development, \nprocurement,  and  implementation  of  integrated  MIS  solutions,  including  components  such  as \nbilling,  accounting,  materials  management,  project  management,  asset  maintenance \nmanagement,  and  technical  applications;  and  (vi)  regulatory  support,  including  filing  tariff \napplications and interaction with MPERC.  DFID assistance also supports technical areas, such \nas  distribution  investment  planning,  facilitation  of  decentralization  and  standardization,  load \nforecasting,  power  quality  and  reliability,  benchmarking,  and  equipment  standards  for  all \nDISCOMs  and  transmission  investment  planning  studies  to  meet  demand  growth  and  open \naccess requirements for TRANSCO.  \n \n\n6. \n\nSector Road Map    \n\n23. \nTo  overcome  these  challenges,  GOMP  has  developed  a  sector  road  map  linked  to  a \ncomprehensive investment program. The sector road map\u2019s objective is to establish the route to \nachieving the sustainable growth of the power sector in MP. The road map aims to deliver the \nfollowing  outcomes:  (i)  strengthening  power  supply  capacity  to  improve  access  to  reliable  and \naffordable  electricity,  (ii)  enhancing  efficiency  and  quality  of  power  supply,  and  (iii)  ensuring \nfinancial  health  of  the  power  sector  through  continued  power  sector  reform  at  the  sector  and \ncorporate levels. Based on the sector road map, the MP power sector needs an estimated $5.3 \nbillion in investments through to 2012. The largest component is generation, accounting for $2.3 \nbillion  of  planned  investment  (43%).  This  is  followed  by  $1.6  billion  for  distribution,  including \nrural  electrification  (30%),  and  $1.4  billion  for  transmission  (26%).  The  investment  program \nincludes  $40  million  for  a  comprehensive  capacity  building  program  to  meet  the  sector\u2019s \nincreasing  management  capacity  requirements.  The  physical  investments  will  address  current \nunserved energy demand and provide additional capacity to meet forecast demand growth. The \ninstalled generating capacity of thermal and hydropower plants will be increased, while technical \nand  nontechnical  losses  will  be  reduced  through  enhanced  transmission  capacity  and  the \nadoption of more appropriate voltage levels for distribution. The need for load shedding also will \nbe reduced during peak demand periods (A matrix that summarizes the sector road map is in \nAppendix 1).  \n \n\n7. \n\nAsian Development Bank\u2019s Strategy \n\n24. \nCognizant  of  the  strong  nexus  between  infrastructure  and  poverty  reduction,  ADB\u2019s \noverall assistance has taken a balanced infrastructure development approach, comprising road \nsystems,  water  transport,  railways,  hydrocarbons,  and  energy.  Within  the  energy  sector,  the \ncountry strategy and program 2003\u20132006 (CSP) focused investment programs on clean energy \ndevelopment,  including run-of-the-river  hydropower  projects,  other  forms  of  renewable  energy, \nrural  electrification,  and  energy  efficiency  improvements.  Guided  by  the  CSP,  the  2004  and \n2005  CSP  updates7  outlined  six  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  power  sector  assistance:  (i)  reforming  the \npower sector, (ii) promoting higher efficiency and low-carbon power sources, (iii) expanding and \noptimizing  transmission  and  distribution  systems,  (iv)  strengthening  institutions  to  implement \nreforms required by the 2003 Electricity Act, (v) promoting private sector participation, and (vi) \nencouraging energy conservation and ensuring environmental and social sustainability.  \n \n25. \nUnder  its  energy  efficiency  and  carbon  market  initiatives,  ADB  is  providing  a \ncomprehensive  technical  assistance  program  that  began  in  2005.  The  program  includes:  (i) \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006): India. Manila; ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nCDM8,  which  provides  capacity  building  for  financial  and  municipal  sectors,  with  an  ultimate \ngoal  of  reducing  greenhouse  gasses  through  CDM  projects;  (ii)  support  the  inception  of  the \nenergy  efficiency  initiative  in  developing  member  countries 9  for  country-level  assessment  of \nnear-term  energy  efficiency  opportunities \nfocusing  on  conservation  and  demand-side \nmanagement;  and  (iii)  assistance  for  renewable  energy  in  rural  areas  through  the  ADB \nRenewable Energy and Climate Change Program.  \n \n26. \nADB  will  continue  to  expand  its  promotion  of  and  support  for  power  sector  reforms  in \nother  states.  ADB  also  will  intensify  its  efforts  in  the  states  where  it  is already  active,  such  as \nAssam,  Gujarat,  MP,  and  Uttaranchal.  The  interventions  will  promote  knowledge  transfer  in \nrelation  to  best  practices  in  the  international  power  sector,  improve  corporate  governance  in \nstate-owned  utilities,  and  ensure  that  appropriate  environmental  and  social  safeguards  are \nincorporated into new power sector investments. The proposed intervention in MP is consistent \nwith the strategy of supporting state-level sector reforms, in this case with the emphasis on the \ntransmission and distribution subsectors. \n \n\n8. \n\nLessons  \n\n  \n\n27. \nIn  the  past,  ADB  extended  assistance  to  discrete  power  projects  in  various  states,  as \nwell as to the central power sector agencies. Although this policy enabled ADB to support many \nprojects,  it  spread  ADB\u2019s  resources  too  thinly.  As  a  result,  ADB  could  not  achieve  fully  its \ndesired goal of policy reforms with its power sector borrowers. In most states, the power sector \nwas the largest recipient of state resources in terms of subsidies and capital investments. India \nrecognized  that  macro  management  of  the  state\u2019s  finances  needed  to  be  improved  to  turn \naround the power sector.  \n \n28. \nSince  2000,  ADB  has  focused  its  lending  on  states  committed  to  reforming  and \nrestructuring  their  power  sectors  on  the  premise  that  improving  the  power  sector  toward \nfinancial  sustainability  will  increase  the  ability  of  state  governments  to  allocate  resources  for \npoverty  reduction.  In  2003,  ADB  conducted  project  performance  audits  of  energy  projects  in \nIndia,  which  identified  the  following  lessons:  (i)  ADB  needs  to  be  flexible  and  adaptable  to \nchanging conditions in India, (ii) land acquisition should be carried out expeditiously to minimize \nimplementation  delays,  (iii)  construction  contracts  should  be  properly  packaged  to  facilitate \nimplementation and coordination, and (iv) loan covenants should be appropriate. These issues \nwere taken into consideration when selecting the subprojects, finalizing procurement packages, \nand  implementing  subprojects  under  the  ongoing  loan.  The  experience  is  reflected  in  the \npreparation  of  the  proposed  MFF,  and  ensured  that  these  lessons  are  incorporated  into  MFF \ndesign and project preparedness criteria agreed between India and ADB.  \n \n\n9. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\nin \n\nThe  power  sector \n\nIndia  has  received  assistance \n\n29. \ninternational \ndevelopment  partners  (Appendix  4).  The  World  Bank  has  been  the  major  source  of  external \nfunding  to  the  sector,  focusing  on  reforms  in  generation,  rehabilitation  and  improvement,  and \ndevelopment  of  renewable  energy  resources.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment has supported policy aspects of private sector participation, with studies on state \nsector  reforms,  and  has  provided  assistance  for  energy  management.

Japan  Bank  for \nInternational  Corporation  has  supported \nthe  expansion  of  public  sector  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution, including rural electrification. \n \n30. \nADB  has  been  coordinating  with  other  development  partners  to  maximize  the  value  of \nsector  reforms  and  physical  investments10.  The  Canadian  International  Development  Agency \nworked with ADB from  2002 to 2004 on MP power sector reform, and has provided extensive \nsupport  for  development  of  financial  restructuring  plans,  reconfiguration  of  distribution \noperations,  and  assessment  of  pension  fund  liabilities.  DFID  has  provided  technical  and \nfinancial  assistance  for  power  sector  restructuring  in  Andhra  Pradesh,  Haryana,  Orissa,  and \nWest Bengal, as well as in MP in cooperation with ADB.  \n \n\n10. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n31. \nEnergy  Efficiency.  GOMP  is  aware  that  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy \npotential  to  bridge  supply  gaps,  specifically  in  distributed  and  decentralized  generation \napplication,  is  substantially  unrealized.  Total  potential  of  energy  efficiency,  renewable  energy, \nand distributed and decentralized generation is roughly equivalent to current state-wide power \nimports.  The  main  sources  of  this  potential  are  conservation  and  demand-side  management, \nsolar water heating and photovoltaic systems, wind power, small hydropower, biomass-biogas, \nand  biofuels.  Cofinancing  of  energy  efficiency  projects  is  possible  through  the  Kyoto  Protocol, \nsecond-tier  carbon  markets,  commercial  clean  energy  investment  funds,  and  the  global \nenvironment  facility.  The  Energy  Conservation  Act  2001  mandates  the  creation  of  state-level \nECF.  GOMP  approved  on  26  September  2006  a  new  policy  for  unconventional  resource \ndevelopment, including directing 5% of the Rs0.10 per kWh cess on power sales into a state-\nlevel ECF to be created. MP will be among the first few states in India to create the ECF.11 \n\nCash  Management. Sector cash management, in terms of revenues and payments, is \n32. \ncentralized  under  MPSEB.  Although  the  five  companies  are  operated  separately  and \nindependently, the revenues from their businesses are consolidated and utilized by MPSEB in \naccordance  with  a  prescriptive  cash  flow  mechanism.  Priority  is  given  to  payment  of  salaries \nand  wages,  coal  and  oil  supplies,  power  purchases,  debt  service,  essential  operation  & \nmanagement expenses, and administrative and capital expenditures. The cash flow mechanism \nis  expected  to  be  retained  until  the  sector  is  returned  to  profitability  in  2011,  according  to \nprojections  in  the  FRP.  However,  TRANSCO\u2019s  projections  show  that  it  will  make  a  profit,  and \nwill  be  capable  of  meeting  its  own  operating  costs  and  debt  repayments,  in  2007.  Similarly, \nDISCOMs\u2019 financial projections indicate that DISCOM-E will achieve profitability in 2009, while \nDISCOM-C  and  DISCOM-W  are  expected  to  reach  that  milestone  in  2010  with  only  small \noperating  losses  in  2009.  Accordingly,  the  cash  flow  mechanism  could  be  discontinued \nbeginning 1 April 2008.  \n \n33. \nGovernance  Measures.  Companies  are  introducing  an  enterprise  resource  planning-\nbased  procurement  system,  which  will  increase  transparency,  accountability,  and  efficiency  in \nprocurement.  Use  of  ADB  guidelines  on  procurement  and  consulting  services  and  standard \nbidding  documents  will  provide  an  opportunity  for  better  monitoring.  Bid  specifications  and \npackaging will ensure maximum competition under international competitive bidding procedures. \n \n\n                                                 \n10 Appendix 4 provides further details.  \n11 Further details are discussed in para. 44. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nRecruitment  of  financial  management  experts  and  establishment  of  internal  control \n34. \nsystems  supported  with  advanced  information  and  communication  technology-based  financial \nmanagement  systems  will  ensure  efficiency  and  accountability.  External  auditors  will  audit  the \nfinancial  statements,  which  will  be  published  regularly  and  reported  to  the  shareholders  and \nMPERC. Measurable financial performance indicators for each company will be set, evaluated, \nand benchmarked by MPERC. ADB review missions will have regular access to the executing \nagencies\u2019  (EA)  accounting  and  control  systems  to  monitor  expenditures  and  other  financial \ntransactions, and ensure safe custody of project-financed assets.  \n \n35. \nThe appointment of independent board members in the sector companies will clarify and \nenhance  their  role  as  custodians  of  stakeholder  interests.  Revisions  to  board  recruitment \nprocedures and establishment of board-level committees will encourage diversity and facilitate \nthe  introduction  of  additional  private  sector  expertise.  The  development  of  a  formal  code  of \nconduct  for  board  members,  as  well  as  public  disclosure  of  operational  and  financial \nperformance  of  the  sector  entities  on  the  MPERC  web  site,  will  ensure  transparency  in  the \npower sector in MP.

Consequently, quality \nand  reliability  of  supply  to  consumers  will  improve,  productive  uses  of  electricity  will  escalate \neconomically,  and  quality  of  life  will  improve.  Additionally,  the  direct  benefit  to  electricity \nconsumers will underpin the expected economic value of the reforms. A secure and predictable \nelectricity  supply  will  enable  social  and  economic  benefits  to  materialize,  and  will  ensure \nimproved  conditions  for  schools,  hospitals,  and  other  social  services.  The  targeted  loss-\nreduction investments will bring the cost of supply in line with average retail tariffs by the end of \nthe  Eleventh  Plan  (2008\u20132012),  and  will  achieve  sector  profitability  and  eventually  financial \nsustainability. The proposed Investment Program to be supported by  ADB  will require 8 years \nfor  full  implementation,  and  will  require  flexibility  in  subproject  selection  to  achieve  overall \nobjectives and to mitigate risk. \n \nThe  EAs  have  gained  substantial  experience  from  implementing  the  previous  ADB \n37. \nproject.  The  project  component  of  the  earlier  ADB  loan  covered  the  transmission  and \ndistribution subsectors. The program component assisted GOMP in (i) implementing key policy \nreforms  and  establishing  a  policy  framework,  including  a  fully  operational,  independent  state \nregulatory  commission;  (ii)  unbundling  the  MPSEB  into  five  companies;  (iii)  improving  sector \ngovernance through more functional independence; and (iv) restructuring tariffs and issuing new \ntariff  orders  that  allow  revenue  realization.  Remaining  policy  issues  are  currently  being \naddressed. The Investment Program will be a logical replication of the project component of the \nprevious  ADB  loan, covering  transmission  and  distribution  subsectors12  by  taking  into  account \nthe  interrelated  nature  of  the  subsectors.  The  transmission  component  will  complete  the \nestablishment  of  a  backbone  for  transmission,  while  the  distribution  component  will  extend \npower to end connections and target physical and nonphysical system losses. Subprojects are \ndesigned  in  a  repeater  nature  in  the  transmission  and  distribution  subsectors,  and  one  set  of \nproject from each subsector is presented in the Report and Recommendation of the President \n(RRP). The MFF is particularly well suited for the Investment Program because (i) the aim of the \nInvestment  Program  is  to  support  GOMP\u2019s  long-term  objectives,  as  stated  in  the  sector  road \nmap;  (ii)  the  performance  of  the  previous  loan  can  guide  the  provision  of  subsequent  loans, \nthereby  offering  proper  incentives  for  implementation;  and  (iii)  the  MFF  can  offer  the  flexibility \nrequired for the Investment Program to support the participation of four companies with different \nlevels of readiness.   \n \nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n38. \nThe  transmission  and  distribution  component  of  MP\u2019s  investment  program  from  2007 \nthrough 2012 is predicated on building sufficient capacity for evacuation of power from existing \nand  planned  power  stations  and  substations,  and  delivering  power  reliability  and  efficiently  to \nconsumers.  ADB  will  finance  key  components  of  the  transmission  investment  program  from \n2007 through to 2012 ($250 million of an estimated total investment requirement of $1.4 billion), \nas  well  as  part  of  the  distribution  investment  program  ($360 million  of  a  total  estimated \ninvestment requirement of $1.6 billion). The construction of new transmission lines will remove \nconstraints  to  power  flow,  and  will  provide  additional  operational  flexibility  to  TRANSCO  in  its \nrole  as  an  independent  system  operator  in  MP.  Supply  reliability  will  be  improved  further,  and \nwill  promote  open  access  and  development  of  intrastate  and  interstate  power  trading  by \n\n                                                 \n12 The generation expansion will be shared equally by the state, central, and private sectors. See para. 9. for details. \n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nproviding  sufficient  excess  substation  and  line  capacity  to  handle  unplanned  power  transfers. \nFrom  the  perspective  of  consumers,  the  impact  of  the  distribution  component  will  be  more \npronounced  and  apparent.  Improvements  in  voltage  profiles  will  be  evident  through  better \nlighting and fewer equipment failures. Supply will be more consistent and momentary outages \nwill be reduced significantly. The distribution component also will impact directly technical and \nnontechnical losses, and eventually sector profitability and financial sustainability. \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n39. \n\nThe ADB supported subset of the investment program will cover three areas: \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\ncapacity \n\nexpansion.  Time-critical \n\nTransmission \nlines, \nsubstations, and auxiliary equipment will be constructed to evacuate and transmit \npower  from  new  power  stations  and  substations  to  consumers.  The  scope  of \ntransmission work will comprise the construction of (a) 2 cct-km of 400 kV13 and \n1,435  cct-km  of  220  kV  transmission  lines  across  the  state;  (b)  eight  new \n220/132  kV  substations  with  transformer  capacity  of  160  MVA14  each;  and  (c) \none new 400/220/132 kV substation with 315 MVA transformer capacity. \n\ntransmission \n\nDistribution  efficiency  enhancement. Targeted capital works will be designed \nto  improve  efficiency  through  loss  reduction  and  to  enhance  supply  reliability  in \nall  DISCOMs.  Subprojects  will  include  (a)  rollout  of  an  HVDS;  (b)  remote \nmetering  of  high-value  customers  (metering  of  unmetered  consumers  and \ndistribution  transformers  metering);  (c)  renovation  of  substation  protection,  and \nmodernization  of  substations  and  substation  Supervisory  Control  and  Data \nAcquisition  (SCADA);  and  (d)  expansion  of  the  village  lighting  scheme  (feeder \nseparation scheme).  \n\ninvestments.  A  number  of  nonphysical \n\ninvestments  will \nNonphysical \ncomplement  physical  investments,  including  implementation  of  SCADA  systems \nin  DISCOM-E,  development  of  a  trading  and  settlements  support  system  for \nTRADECO,  facilitation  of  strategic  PPP,  and  establishment  of  ECF  and  other \nenergy efficiency initiatives such as CDM. \n\n \nTechnical Justification and Selection Criteria  \n\nC. \n\nTransmission components form part of the least-cost expansion plan of the Government, \n40. \nMP, and TRANSCO. TRANSCO\u2019s planning process uses investment signals provided through \nthe  national  and  regional  demand  forecast  produced  by  the  CEA,  and  from  state  energy  and \ndemand  forecasts  produced  with  the  assistance  of  DISCOMs.  TRANSCO\u2019s  transmission \nnetwork was modeled using power system analysis framework software, and this model was the \nprimary  transmission  planning  tool  for  assessing  the  technical  benefits  of  the  transmission \ncomponents.  Distribution  components  were  modeled  and  analyzed  using  power  systems \nanalysis  software,  and  are  focused  on  network  augmentation  and  reinforcement  rather  than \nexpansion. The expansion program is technically, financially, and economically viable. It can be \nimplemented with minimal environmental and social impact. Best practice design standards and \nconstruction techniques will be applied to all investments.  \n \n41. \n\nThe following are the criteria for selecting each subproject: \n\n                                                 \n13 Kilovolt (kV) \n14 Megavolt-ampere 1,000,000 volt-amperes (MVA). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nSubproject  designs  will  be  consistent  with  overall  least-cost  expansion  plans \ndesigned  on  a  least  cost  basis  and  reflect  \u201cbest  practice\u201d  design,  construction, \nand operations and maintenance features. \n\nSubprojects  will  display  performance-based  design  consistent  with  international \nbenchmarks for system efficiency and operational risk.  Subprojects should have \nquantifiable energy efficiency improvements. \n\nthe \n\nresettlement \n\nSubproject  designs  will  be  consistent  with  the  environmental  management  plan \n(EMP), \nindigenous  people \ndevelopment  framework  (IPDF).  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  (RP) \nand indigenous people development plans (IPDP) based on the agreed IPDF and \nthe  RF  will  be  prepared  as  necessary  for  additional  subprojects  before  ADB \napproves funding. \n\n(RF),  and \n\nframework \n\nthe \n\nAll  subprojects  require  environmental  assessments  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002).  Category  A  subprojects  will  require  a  summary \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (SEIA),  category  B  subprojects  will  require  a \nsummary initial environmental examination (SIEE). SEIA and SIEE for category A \nand B-sensitive subprojects respectively must be prepared and made available to \nthe  public  120  days  before  a  Periodic  Financing  Request  (PFR)  is  submitted  to \nADB. EMPs with budgets will be prepared for each subproject. \n\n \n\nD. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n42. \nHigh-Voltage  Distribution  System.  The  objective  of  HVDS  is  a  virtual  elimination  of \ntheft-related commercial losses, as well as significant reduction in technical losses. This will be \nachieved  by  replacing  the  overhead  open  wire  low-voltage  (0.4  kV)  distribution  system  with  a \nhigh-voltage (11 kV) distribution system, and placing additional, lower-rated transformers close \nto  consumers\u2019  premises.  By  extending  the  11  kV  network  closer  to  consumers\u2019  service \nconnections,  illegal  connections  from  lengthy  low-voltage  lines  will  become  difficult.  In  the \nabsence  of  LV  voltage  drop,  voltage  profiles  also  will  improve  and  interference  between \nneighboring customers\u2019 loads will be decreased. Further, unscheduled supply interruptions are \nexpected  to  be  reduced  from  fewer  overloaded  transformers  and  circuits.  A  pilot  study \nundertaken by DISCOM-W confirmed the viability of the HVDS scheme, with distribution loss in \nthe study area reduced from 26.7% to 8.4%.  \n \n43. \nStrategic  Public-Private  Partnership  Scheme.  Under  the  Investment  Program,  a \nstrategic partnership with the private sector will be developed in selected urban areas under the \nfranchising modality with the intention of achieving the requisite reduction in distribution losses \nand improving the quality of service to consumers. If successful, this scheme will be extended \ninto  other  semi-urban  and  urban  areas  in  MP.  Under  the  modality,  the  strategic  partnerships \nwith the private sector, selected through competitive bidding process, would buy power from the \nincumbent\u2019s  distribution  licensee  at  bulk  import  points.  The  PPP  would  be  responsible  for  all \ndownstream distribution-related activities, including long-term capital investment and operation \nand maintenance. These franchises will be at least long enough to recover the investments in \nnetwork augmentation and expansion. Gwalior city under DISCOM-C has been selected for pilot \ntesting the scheme. \n \n44. \nEnergy  Conservation  Fund.  ADB  funds  will  partly  capitalize  a  new  special  purpose \nvehicle  created  for  the  ECF.  Operations  of  the  ECF  will  be  outsourced  through  competitive \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nbidding to a consortium of an ESCO with experience in project implementation and a financial \ninstitution with professional experience in fund management. Additional equity contributions by \npower  sector  companies  and  private  financiers  will  be  possible.  ADB\u2019s  direct  participation  will \ncreate  the  opportunity  for  additional  credit  enhancements  in  the  form  of  partial  credit \nguarantees,  cofinancing  from  the  new  CDM  and  energy  efficiency  funds  expected  to  be \noperational  by  2007  and  2008.  The  ECF  investments  will  be  repaid  from  revenue  generated \ndirectly  by  the  projects.  ADB  participation  in  the  ECF  offers  innovative  financing,  mobilizes \nprivate participation, and capitalizes on carbon credit opportunities. Various parties will need to \nbe consulted during the development of the ECF. For this reason, it will be included in one of \nthe further tranches of the MFF, tentatively scheduled for April 2008.  \n \n45. \nCarbon Emissions Trading.  Cofinancing  of  alternative  energy  projects  is  possible \nthrough  the  Kyoto  Protocol  CDM,  second-tier  carbon  markets,  commercial  clean  energy \ninvestment  funds,  and  the  Global  Environment  Facility.  CDM  and  second-tier  carbon  markets \nmight  be  the  best  options  for  carbon  credit  transactions.  ADB  will  provide  indirect  support \nthrough  an  ongoing  technical  assistance  project  executed  by  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and \nForests, the designated national authority for CDM. The HVDS is the only component confirmed \nfor ADB funding that appears to be a promising CDM candidate based on expected emissions \nreductions. ADB will assist in preparing a project concept note for submission to the ministry to \nestimate  the  relative  prospects  for  CDM.  ADB  will  assist  in  further  development  accordingly \nthrough a technical assistance.15\n \nE. \n\nInvestment Program and Financing Plan \n\nThe  total  power  sector  investment  program  and  indicative  financing  for  2007\u20132012  is \n\n46. \nshown in Table 2.

The Government and GOMP have asked ADB to extend this finance in \nthe form of an MFF. \n \nThe financing will be provided under an MFF in accordance with ADB policy.16 The Staff \n48. \nInstructions  on  the  Use  of  MFF17  was  followed  in  processing  the  MFF.  The  MFF  will  extend \nmultiple  loans  to  finance  a  range  of  projects  under  the  Investment  Program,  subject  to  the \nsubmission of a related periodic financing request (PFR)\n by the Government and execution of \nthe  related  loan  and  project  agreements.  Each  PFR  will  be  accompanied  by  a  detailed  cost \nestimate, as well as an implementation schedule. The Framework Financing Agreement (FFA) \nsatisfies  the  requirements  set  forth  in  Appendix  4  of  the \nPilot  Financing  Instruments  and \n (footnote 35). The Government is required to comply with the FFA requirements. The \nModalities\nloans under the MFF will finance equipment supply and erection, consulting services, and other \ncapacity  building  activities.  The  minimum  amount  of  a  PFR  will  be  $40  million,  except  for  the \ncapacity building component, which will have a minimum loan amount of $5 million.  \n \nAll provisions of the ordinary operations loan regulations applicable to London interbank \n49. \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  loans18  will  apply  to  each  loan,  subject  to  any  modifications  that \nmight  be  included  under  any  loan  agreement.  The  Government  can  choose  from  eligible \ncurrencies and interest rate regimes for each loan. The specific terms of each loan will be based \non  the  related  PFR,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending  facility.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decisions  to \nborrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices \nwere its own independent decision and not  made in reliance on any  communication or advice \nfrom  ADB.  The  Government  will  make  loans  available  to  GOMP  on  the  same  terms  and \nconditions as the ones applicable to the Government. GOMP will onlend to sector companies, \nas the EAs, with a 1 percentage point spread, through the respective onlending agreements. \n \nIf  the  Government  requests  any  cofinancing  arrangements  or  related  assistance  for \n50. \nprojects  under  the  MFF  from  ADB,  ADB  may  assist  with  these,  subject  to  related  ADB  policy \nand procedures.  \n \nThe Government will provide the proceeds of the loans under the MFF in local currency \n51. \nto the state and through the state to the EAs. GOMP will bear the foreign exchange risk on the \nloans. \n \nThe MFF transaction is accompanied by Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 PFRs to finance a set \n52. \nof  subprojects  consisting  transmission  and  distribution  components,  respectively,  which  are \nready for implementation.  \n \n\n(i) \n\nincludes \nPFR  1,  Transmission  Capacity  Expansion.  This  component \nconstruction  of  (a)  2  circuit  kilometers  (cct-km)  of  400  kV  and  1,435  cct-km  of \n220  kV  transmission  lines  across  MP;  (b)  eight  new  220/132  kV  substations, \nwith  transformer  capacity  of  160  MVA  each;  and  (c)  one  new  400/220/132  kV \nsubstation with 315 MVA transformer capacity.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nPFR 2, Distribution Efficiency Enhancement. The distribution component will \nundertake  (a)  construction  of  HVDS  in  six    distribution  circles  in  the  eastern \ndistribution zone of MP, including conversion of about 7,400 km of low-voltage \nlines  to  high-voltage  lines;  (b)  remote  metering  of  about  2,000  industrial \nconsumers;  (c)  metering  of  about  250,000  consumers;  and  (d)  renovation  of \nprotection system at about 100 substations. \n\n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n53. \nExecuting Agencies.  TRANSCO  will  be  the  EA  for  the  transmission  component; \nDISCOM-E, DISCOM-C, and DISCOM-W will be the EAs for the distribution components in their \nrespective areas. A coordinating committee comprising the chairman and managing director of \nthe  EAs,  and  led  by  the  chairman  and  managing  director  of  TRANSCO,  will  be  established to \nmonitor and coordinate the overall implementation of the Investment Program. The coordinating \ncommittee  will  report  to  the  Energy  Department  of  GOMP.  At  the  state  level,  the  Energy \nDepartment  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  reform  policy  and  overall  power  sector \ninvestment.  The  MPERC  will  monitor  the  performance  and  improvement  of  service  delivery  of \nthe  EAs  at  the  state  level.  At  the  central  level,  the  Ministry  of  Power  will  monitor  state  sector \npolicy  and  investment  program  implementation.  All  EAs  have  established  their  project \nmanagement  units  (PMU),  headed  by  a  full-time  project  manager.  Each  PMU  will  have \ntechnical, financial, procurement, and safeguards divisions. Since the PMU staff of TRANSCO \nand  DISCOMs  has  substantial  experience  from  implementing  the  previous  ADB-financed \nproject,  they  are  fully  conversant  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and  procedures.  TRADECO  will \nimplement  the  capacity  building  component  included  in  the  third  tranche,  while  the  EA  for \nenergy efficiency will be determined once the design is finalized. \n \n54. \nInvestment  Program  Management.  The  EAs  will  be  responsible  for  the  appraisal, \nprocessing, and implementation of the Investment Program. The responsibilities will include the \npreparation  of  technical  reports  (feasibility  studies,  preliminary  design  reports,  environmental \nassessment reports, resettlement and indigenous people\u2019s development plans, detailed design \nreports),  and  bidding  documents  to  ensure  compliance  with  requirements  of  the  Government \nand  ADB.  Overall  investment  progress  will  be  considered  when  new  financing  requests  are \nsubmitted. The Investment Program Implementation Structure is in Appendix 6. \n \n55. \nAs  the  staff  of  TRANSCO  and  the  three  DISCOMs  are  technically  competent  and  fully \nfamiliar with ADB\u2019s policies and guidelines, they will not require assistance from consultants for \nproject design and implementation. However, TRADECO will require consulting services for (i) \ndesign, procurement, and implementation of a power trading system; (ii) capacity building and \ntraining in power trading; and (iii) implementation of information technology and MIS design. In \naddition,  ADB  assistance  will  be  extended  for  design  and  implementation  of  the  energy \nefficiency  component,  as  well  as  monitoring  the  overall  implementation  of  the  Investment \nProgram, if necessary. \n  \n56. \nPerformance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  Performance  will  be  monitored  and \nevaluated  based  on  indicators  and  targets  stipulated  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework. \nThe ADB team will prepare periodic reports to inform the ADB Board of Directors (the Board) of \noverall  progress.  A  Board  information  report  will  be  submitted  annually,  and  supplemental \nprogress reports will be submitted before Management approves individual loan agreements. \n \n57. \nReview.  ADB  will  field  an  Inception  Mission  within  3  months  of  the  approval  of  each \ntranche.  ADB  will  review  the  implementation  and  operations,  including  resettlement,  and \nenvironmental aspects based on quarterly progress reports. Further, ADB will meet with GOMP \n\n \n\n\fand the EAs semiannually to discuss implementation progress. A midterm review to be carried \nout  2  years  after  each  tranche  becomes  effective  will  focus  on  the  engineering,  resettlement, \nenvironmental,  and  social  aspects  of  the  ADB-supported  investments,  and  will  review  the \nfinancial  status  of  EAs.  Representatives  of  ADB  and  the  EAs  will  take  part  in  the  review.  The \nreview will allow for any necessary midcourse corrections to ensure successful implementation \nand  achievement  of  objectives.  A  completion  report  will  be  submitted  within  3  months  of  the \ncompletion of each tranche. An MFF completion report will be prepared after the completion of \nall ADB-supported activities and projects under the Investment Program. \n \n58. \nImplementation  Period.  The  Investment  Program  will  be  implemented  over  8  years, \nincluding procurement and construction activities, from 2007 to 2014. The loan agreements are \nexpected  to  have  implementation  periods  of  4\u20135  years  (Appendix  7).  The  last  PFR  should  be \nsubmitted no later than the end of 2010.  \n \n59. \nProcurement  and  Consulting  Services.  Procurement  to  be  financed  under  the  MFF \nwill  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2006,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).  International  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  will  be  used  to  procure  equipment  (conductors, \ntransformers, etc.) and turnkey construction of the facilities being funded under the Investment \nProgram (transmission lines, HDVS, etc.). ICB will be utilized for supply contracts estimated to \ncost  the  equivalent  of  or  more  than  $1  million.  Limited  international  bidding  or  national \ncompetitive  bidding  (NCB)  will  be  used  for  supply  contracts  estimated  at  $250,000\u2013$1  million, \nand shopping for contracts estimated at less than $250,000. Under NCB the bidding documents \nand procurement procedures agreed between EAs and ADB, as also set out in the procurement \nplan  will  be  followed.  Any  modification  to  these  will  be  agreed  between  EAs  and  ADB  and \nfurther  reflected  in  the  procurement  plan.  Contract  packages  will  be  prepared  to  ensure \nmaximum competition under ICB. In accordance with these arrangements, a procurement plan \nfor the subprojects under Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 are presented in Appendix 8. \n \nConsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \n60. \nUse  of  Consultants  (2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Consulting  firms  will  be  selected \nthrough international competition using the quality- and cost-based selection method. Individual \nexperts may be recruited following ADB\u2019s procedures for engagement of individual consultants \nbased  on  resume  submitted  in  response  to  the  terms  of  reference  for  the  assignment.  Full \ntechnical  proposals  will  be  required  for  contracts  valued  at  more  than  $1  million.  Simplified \ntechnical proposals will be used for contracts worth between $600,000 and $1 million, and the \nresume for technical proposals for those less than $600,000. \n \n61. \nDisbursement  Arrangements.  Loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). For each loan, the \nGovernment  will  establish,  operate,  and  maintain  a  first  generation  imprest  account  (FGIA)  in \nReserve  Bank  of  India  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  The  FGIA \naccount  will  be  a  current  account,  which  will  facilitate  withdrawal  of  funds  to  meet  project \nexpenditures whenever needed. The initial advance to an imprest account will be 6 months of \nestimated  expenditures  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  which  ever  is  lower.  A  second  generation \nimprest  account  (SGIA)  will  be  established  for  each  loan  in  the  name  of  each  EA  to  receive \nfunds  from  the  FGIA  to meet  project  expenditures  incurred.  The  SGIA  will  be  established in  a \nnon-interest  bearing  current  account  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  and  the \nGovernment. Interest income earned from the SGIA, if any, will be utilized by the relevant EAs \nfor  project  purposes  only.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible \nexpenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  to  the  FGIA  and  SGIA.  This  will  be  applicable  to \nexpenditures  of  $100,000  or  less.  ADB  will  conduct  a  training  seminar  on  its  disbursement \nprocedures for DISCOMs.   \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n \n62. \nAdvance  Contracting.  To  expedite  the  implementation  of  Tranche  1  and  Tranche  2 \nsubprojects,  ADB  approved  the  request  of  the  Government  for  advance  contracting.  ADB  has \nreviewed and approved bidding documents for transmission subprojects, which were issued in \nDecember 2006. The bidding documents for distribution subprojects are being prepared. Once \nADB  reviews  and  approves  the  documents,  they  will  be  issued  in  February  2007.  For  each \nfuture tranche, the Government will request ADB\u2019s approval for advance contracting. \n \nRetroactive  Financing.  ADB\u2019s  Management  may  consider  and  allow  retroactive \n63. \nfinancing  of  eligible  expenditures  when  included  in  PFRs.  Except  as  otherwise  agreed  with \nADB,  the  expenditures  incurred  for  equipment  and  consulting  services  will  be  eligible  for \nadvanced  contracting,  provided  that  these  are  incurred  before  the  effectiveness  of  the  related \nloan  agreement,  but  not  earlier  than  12  months  preceding  the  signing  of  the  related  loan \nagreement,  and  as  long  as  they  do  not  exceed  an  amount  of  20%  of  the  individual  loan.  The \nGovernment and EAs have been informed that approval of advanced contracting and retroactive \nfinancing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  any  of  the  proposed  subprojects.  Each  PFR  will \nspecify the nature of expenditure if retroactive financing is requested. Retroactive financing will \napply from the third tranche onward. \n \n64. \nAnticorruption  Policy.  ADB\u2019s policy on  Anticorruption (1998, as amended up to date) \nwas  explained  to  and  discussed  with  GOMP  and  the  EAs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices \nrelating  to  subprojects  under  the  MFF.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \npolicy on Anticorruption are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the \nMFF.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  subprojects  under  the \nInvestment  Program  will  include  provisions  specifying  ADB\u2019s  right  to  audit  and  examine  the \nrecords and accounts of the EAs and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service \nproviders as they relate to the subprojects and components under the Investment Program (see \npara. 38 for governance measures in these areas).   \n \n65. \nAccounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting. Quarterly progress reports will be prepared for \nthe individual components for review by ADB. The reports will include a description of physical \nprogress  and  problems,  and  a  summary  of  financial  accounts  that  will  consist  of  loan \nexpenditures during the period, year to date, and total to date. Progress on environmental and \nsocial compliance,  overall  progress,  and  compliance  with  conditions  of  the  FFA  and  individual \nloan and project agreements also will be included in the progress reports. Further, the progress \nreports  will  include  an  evaluation  of  issues  or  problems  faced  by  the  EAs  and  recommended \nremedial  actions.  A  project  completion  report  will  be  submitted  within  3  months  of  the \ncompletion  of  each  component.  The  EAs  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  each  loan \n(tranches). Within 6 months of the close of the financial year, the EAs will submit audited project \naccounts and financial statements. An independent auditor acceptable to ADB will be hired by \nthe EAs to conduct the audit. \n \n\nIV. \n\nBENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS  \n\nA. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nInstitutional  and  financial  analyses  of  the  Tranche  1  and  Tranche  2  subprojects \n66. \n(Appendix  9  and  further  details  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E )  have  been  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment \n\n \n\n\fProjects Financed by the ADB19. The analysis was conducted for 2008\u20132032 for TRANSCO, the \nEA for Tranche 1, and DISCOM-E, the EA for Tranche 2. The financial evaluation of subprojects \nwas  undertaken  in  real  terms  using  constant  2006  prices.  Incremental  costs  and  benefits \nattributable  to  investments  were  derived  by  comparing  \u201cwith\u201d  and  \u201cwithout\u201d  project  scenarios. \nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is estimated to be 4.8% for Tranche 1 transmission \nsubprojects and 8.3% for Tranche 2 distribution subprojects. This compares favorably with their \nweighted average cost of capital (WACC) for this period, which is 3.4% for TRANSCO and 2.3% \nfor  DISCOM-E.  When  discounted  at  WACC,  investments  have  net  present  values  of  Rs1.2 \nbillion for the transmission subprojects and Rs2.8 billion for the distribution subprojects. Tranche \n1  and  Tranche  2  investments,  therefore,  are  considered  financially  viable  and  sustainable. \nSensitivity and risk analysis indicates that the FIRR for Tranche 1 and Tranche 2, as well as the \noverall Investment Program, are robust with (i) 10% increase in capital costs, (ii) 10% increase \nin operational and maintenance costs, (iii) 10% reduction in benefits, (iv) 2-year delay in project \ncompletion plus 20% increase in costs, and (v) no residual value.  \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Management  \n\n67. \nA  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was  carried  out  using  ADB\u2019s  FMA \nquestionnaire to review the capacity of the sector companies to manage financial aspects of the \nMFF.  The  FMA  is  an  independent  assessment  based  on  discussions  with  officials  of  sector \ncompanies  and  review  of  reports  prepared  for  the  sector  companies  under  the  earlier  DFID-\nsponsored  technical  assistance.  The  unbundled  power  sector  companies  inherited  billing, \naccounting,  and  management  information  systems  from  MPSEB  that  were  developed  to  meet \nthe Electricity Supply Association Accounting Rules established in 1985. These systems are not \nsuitable  to  meet  the  management  and  reporting  requirements  of  commercial  companies \noperating under the Companies Act 1956. The current systems have limitations and are not fully \ncomputerized. While these systems can meet the companies\u2019 statutory reporting requirements, \nthey cannot provide useful and timely online information for management of the new companies \nand  meet  the  information  requirements  of  MPERC.  As  part  of  the  capacity  building  support, \nfunding  has  been  allocated  to  meet  the  \u00a318.5  million  cost  of  new  systems,  covering  billing, \naccounting,  and  MIS  for  the  three  DISCOMs  and  TRANSCO  to  purchase  software  and \nhardware, 20   implementation,  training,  and  5-year  service  support.  Under  the  capacity \ndevelopment  program,  companies  have  been  updating  the  chart  of  accounts  and  accounting \npolicies to comply with the Companies Act 1956, as well as preparing their long-term business \nplans.  In  addition,  the  new  companies  are  receiving  comprehensive  training  on  revised \naccounting  procedures,  preparing  cost  accounting  manuals,  assisting  with  the  preparation  of \ntariff petitions to MPERC, and developing internal audit procedures.  \n \nC. \n\nPast and Projected Financial Performance \n\nOver  2001\u20132005,  the  MPSEB  reduced  annual  financial  losses  from  a  high  of  Rs13.7 \n68. \nbillion  in  2002  to  Rs2.7  billion  in  2005.  The  improvement  of  the  financial  situation  is  mainly \nattributable to an increase in electricity sales and in average revenues from Rs2.53 per kWh to \nRs3.05  per  kWh.  In  addition,  as  a  result  of  sector  financial  restructuring,  interest  charges \ndeclined from Rs11.373 billion to Rs3.121 billion in 2005.  \n \n\n                                                 \n19  ADB.  2002.  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  the \n\n20 Approximately  50%  of  the  cost  will  be  met  by  the  DFID  grant  with  the  companies  providing  the  balance  of  the \n\nfunding for the proposed software and hardware. \n\nADB. Manila. \n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n69.  MPERC has introduced MYT determinations for generation and transmission companies. \nFollowing single-year price determinations in 2006 and 2007 for distribution companies, MPERC \nwill  provide  a  3-year  tariff  determination  covering  2008  to  2010.  This  will  provide  certainty  for \ncompanies  and  customers.  At  the  same  time,  per  the  Electricity  Act,  2003  and  National  Tariff \nPolicy,  all  tariffs  are  to be  plus  or minus  20%  of  the  cost of  supply  by  the  end  of  2011.  Thus, \nprogressive increases in tariffs, coupled with a reduction in losses from the current level of 41% \nfor  transmission  and  distribution  to  24%  by  2012,  will  continue  to  improve  the  companies\u2019 \nfinancial performance over the next 5 years.  \n \n70. \nFor Tranche 1, TRANSCO\u2019s projected financial performance indicators improve over the \nforecast  period  with  a  debt  service  coverage  ratio  exceeding  1.2  in  all  years  from  2008.  The \nself-financing  capacity  of  the  company  improves  towards  the  end  of  the  forecast  period,  with \nTRANSCO  able  to  meet  at least  20%  of capital  expenditures  from  internal  sources  from  2013 \nonward. The debt to debt-plus-equity ratio of 67% in 2007 falls steadily to 45% by 2016. ADB \nwill  fund  about  63%  of  the  capital  expenditures,  with  the  balance  financed  by  internal  funds, \nGOMP  equity,  and  PFC  loans.  TRANSCO\u2019s  financial  position  is  improving  as  a  result  of \nincreasing  tariffs  and  revenues.  The  improving  self-financing  ratio  and  adequate  debt  service \nratio assure the financial sustainability of the company with the ADB investment (Appendix 11, \nSupplementary Appendix G).  \n \nFor Tranche 2, DISCOM-E tariff increases approved by MPERC allow profitability to be \n71. \nachieved  by  2008.  DISCOM-E  return  on  equity  will  be  positive  from  2008.  Return  on  historic \naverage net fixed assets will increase to 19.3% in 2009 and remain above 16% thereafter. Debt \nto debt-plus-equity ratio is forecast to fall from 68.3% in 2006 to 39.6% by 2012. ADB will fund \nabout  57%  of  the  proposed  project  with  the  balance  funded  by  equity  from  GOMP,  retained \nearnings, and PFC loans. Grants from the Government will fund 90% of rural electrification with \n10%  financed  by  loans  through  the  rural  electrification  corporation.  Full  electrification  of  MP \nstate is projected to be achieved at the end of 2009. At the proposed tariffs, DISCOM-E exhibits \na  strong  cash  flow  with  a  debt  service  ratio  of  at  least  1.3  in  all  years.  The  self-financing \ncapacity of DISCOM-E exceeds 20% from 2009. The projections for DISCOM-E show sustained \nfinancial improvement from 2007 through to 2016, and indicate that the company is capable of \nabsorbing the proposed investments under the MFF (Appendix 11, Supplementary Appendix G).. \n \nD. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n72. \nEconomic  analysis  (Appendix  12)  was  undertaken  for  transmission  and  distribution \ncomponents to be funded under the Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 in accordance with the Guidelines \nfor Economic Analysis of Projects21. Economic internal rates of return (EIRR) were calculated by \ncomparing  \u201cwith\u201d  and  \u201cwithout\u201d  project  scenarios.  The  main  economic  benefits  are  displaced \nthermal  electricity  generation  and  incremental  consumption.  These  benefits  arise  from  a \nreduction  in  technical  and  nontechnical  losses,  removal  of  network  constraints,  and  improved \nreliability of supply. Benefits were quantified through load flow analyses and from pilot studies \nundertaken  in  other  states.  Demand  forecasts,  prepared  by  TRANSCO  for  Tranche  1,  were \nbased on projections of historical sales data, modified by population growth, the impact of real \ntariff increases, and the impact of real increases in household income. Non-incremental output \nfrom  the  subprojects  was  valued  based  on  the  displaced  generation  from  coal-fired  thermal \nplants.  Incremental  output  was  valued  using  consumers\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  incremental \nconsumption. Initial estimates indicate that Tranche 1 transmission subprojects have an overall \nEIRR of 15.0% and Tranche 2 distribution subprojects an overall EIRR of 14.7%. These EIRRs \nindicate that Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 components are economically viable. Sensitivity analysis \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\frevealed  that  expected  economic  outcomes  from  transmission  subprojects  are  robust  under  a \nrange  of  downside  scenarios,  reflecting  the  urgent  need  for  augmentation  of  the  transmission \nnetwork. Distribution subprojects are also robust, although sensitivity to forecast demand growth \nis apparent for some subprojects. \n \nE. \n\nEnvironmental Analysis \n\n \n\n23\n\n73. \nA draft environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) has been prepared for \nthe Investment Program, outlining the policy, procedures, and institutional requirements for the \noverall  Investment  Program  and  each  tranche  (Supplemental  Appendix  K).  The  EAs  are \nresponsible  for  preparing  the  required  environmental  assessments  and  obtaining  ADB \nconcurrence  before  implementation.  Environmental  assessment  of  the  proposed  investments \nhas  been  and  will  continue  to  be  conducted  following  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002); \n22\nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003)\n;  ADB  Staff  Instructions  on  the  Use  of  the \nMultitranche  Financing  Facility  (2006)\n;the  EARF;  and  the  Government\u2019s  environmental \nassessment regulations and guidelines. The first and second tranche investments are classified \nas  category  B 24  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines.  The  EAs \n(TRANSCO  and  DISCOM-E)  have  prepared  IEEs  for  Tranche  1  and  Tranche  2  components. \nEnvironmental assessment also will be prepared in due course for the remaining components in \neach  tranche,  as  outlined  in  the  EARF.  A  summary  IEE  (Appendix  13)  for  Tranche  1  and \nTranche 2 outlines environmental benefits and negative impacts, proposed mitigation measures, \nand  preliminary  EMP  (Supplementary  Appendix  L).  Public  consultations  indicate  strong  local \nsupport for the proposed investments. \n \nBased  on  the  environmental  assessments  and  reconnaissance  surveys,  most  of  the \n74. \nimpacts will occur during construction. The principal impacts are related to acquisition of rights-\nof-way for transmission lines, earthmoving and initial clearing of vegetation for construction, and \nperiodic  clearing  of  vegetation  during  operations.  These  impacts  will  be  mitigated  by  selective \nrouting  of  transmission  lines,  appropriate  erosion-control  measures,  proper  management  of \nconstruction-related wastes, and provision of compensation for reforestation, as necessary. No \nendangered,  rare,  or  threatened  species  of  flora  or  fauna  have  been  reported  at  any  project \nsites.  Adequate  provisions  have  been  made  for  the  environmental  mitigation  and  monitoring \nrequirements  and  their  associated  costs.  The  project  sites  are  mostly  on  government-owned \nland. The land acquired for new substations is mostly uninhabited, unused, and outside towns \nand  villages.  Mitigation  measures  related  to  construction  and  specified  in  the  EMP  will  be \nincorporated into civil works contracts. Although the contractors will have primary responsibility \nfor  implementation  of  mitigation  measures  during  construction,  the  implementing  agencies  will \nbe responsible for overall implementation of site-specific EMPs. \n \n75. \nThe proposed Investment Program has potential cumulative and induced impacts, which \nare  considered  largely  positive.  Distribution  and  transmission  system  efficiency  improvements \nwill  result  in  energy  savings  of  at  least  1,200  gigawatt-hour  (GWh)  per  year,  with  equivalent \ncarbon dioxide (CO2) reductions of more than 1 million tons per year. Environmental and social \nbenefits of the investment components and long-term program objectives outweigh the negative \nimpacts.  The  EARF  will  guide  environmental  management  activities  robustly  for  the  life  of  the \nMFF.   \n\n                                                 \n22 ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n24 Each  tranche  will  be  subject  to  environmental  categorization.  All  tranches  are  expected  to  be  Category  B  or  C. \nTranches  will  be  re-categorized  as  necessary  if  Category  A-  or  B-sensitive  projects  and/or  subprojects  are \nidentified. \n\n21 \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n \nF. \n\nSocial Assessment \n\n76. \nIn full consultation with stakeholders and affected persons, an RF, RP, and IPDF were \nprepared,  which  will  be  the  basis  for  preparing  subsequent  RPs  and  IPDPs  for  additional \nsubprojects  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  Policy  on \nIndigenous  Peoples  (1998),  and  relevant  sections  of  the  Operations  Manual.  Tranche  1  and \nTranche 2 will have no impacts on indigenous people. The RP, RF, and IPDF were disclosed to \nthe affected persons in their local language in December 2006 (Appendix 14, Appendix 15 and \nSupplementary Appendix J). Future RPs and IPDPs will be prepared and disclosed to affected \npersons, and all compensation will be paid before the start of civil works. GOMP has agreed to \nmonitor  the  implementation  of  both  frameworks,  and  to  endorse  the  frameworks  for  future \ntranches.  Frameworks  that  are  part  of  the  FFA  will  be  considered  a  prerequisite  to  apply  for \nfinancing by the EAs. Appraisal of successive tranches will require a review of the RF and IPDF, \nas  well  as  the  preparation  of  the  RPs  and  IPDPs,  if  needed,  or  the  appropriate  indigenous \npeople (IP) actions for all subprojects with IP issues. \n \n77.  Minimal  land  acquisition  is  required  for  the  transmission  network  expansion  under \nTranche  1.  One  of  the  18  substations  will  require  the  acquisition  of  3  hectares  (ha)  of  private \nland, affecting three households. If land acquisition from private owners is required, the EA has \nallocated  sufficient  budgetary  resources  to  cover  the  compensation  packages  provided  in  the \nRP. A maximum of 612 ha of land is estimated to be acquired temporarily for transmission lines, \naffecting  a  maximum  of  1,528  people  (for  less  than  10%  of  their  assets).  Since  the  EA  has \nensured that all the transmission lines will pass through agricultural land, substantial loss of land \nvalue is not expected on any of the affected plots. The EA also has ensured that scheduling the \nconstruction  of  towers  and  the  stringing  to  minimize  crop  disruption  is  common  practice.  No \nprivate land is required permanently or temporarily for the expansion of the distribution system \nunder Tranche 2. \n \n78. \nImpacts  of  Tranche  1,  and  future  tranches,  if  any,  are  expected  to  be  minimal. \nCompensation packages and a short RP have been prepared for the subproject components of \nTranche 1. The short RP also covers the transmission network expansion to be financed under \nTranche 3. However, the short RP, will be updated during the preparation of Tranche 3. \n \nG. \n\nPoverty Assessment \n\nThe MFF is designed to benefit all grid-connected consumers with adequate and reliable \n79. \nsupply  of  electricity,  which  would  support  the  Government\u2019s  projections  for  growth  in  energy \ndemand  and  its  intent  to  make  affordable  grid-based  electricity  supply  available  to  the  entire \npopulation by 2012. Government policy includes support to poor households via a lifeline tariff \nfor the first 1 kWh of consumption per household per day. A secure and predictable electricity \nsupply  will  enable  social  and  economic  benefits  to  materialize,  as  well  as  ensure  improved \nconditions  for  schools,  hospitals,  and  other  social  services.  Improvements  in  quality  and \nreliability  of  supply  that  will  accrue  from  targeted  investments  are  expected  to  improve  living \nconditions in the rural areas through the creation of job and income opportunities. Farmers and \nsmall  business  owners  are  expected  to  increase  their  productivity.  Demand  for  electric \ninstallations,  supplies,  and  maintenance  is  expected  to  increase,  creating  additional  new  job \nopportunities.  In  addition,  a  reliable  electricity  supply  improves  quality  of  life  of  households, \nespecially for women who are traditionally responsible for the activities inside the house.  \n \n\n \n\n\fH. \n\nPotential Risks \n\n80. \nRisks include (i) inability of DISCOMs to reduce losses as agreed with MPERC, resulting \nin  lower  revenues  and  failure  to  meet  debt  service  on  subproject  investments;  (ii)  delays  in \npower  sector  reforms,  resulting  in  limited  financial  independence  of  companies  and  continued \ncentralization  of  cash  flow  mechanisms;  (iii)  delays  in  construction  of  power  projects  not \nfinanced  by  ADB,  leading  to  further  energy  and  peak  capacity  shortages,  as  well  as  lower \nelectricity  sales  and  revenues  than  forecast;  (iv)  increases  in  the  prices  of  construction \nmaterials,  resulting  in  financially  nonviable  investments;  (vi)  failure  to  mobilize  the  necessary \ncounterpart  funds;  (vii)  delays  in  procurement  and  contract  awards;  and  (vii)  increases  in  the \ncost  of  delivered  electricity  due  to  suboptimal  power  purchasing  and  other  factors,  leading  to \nlower-than-expected  demand  for  electricity.  These  risks  are  regarded  as  low,  or  have  been \nminimized  to  the  extent  possible  in  project  formulation  and  implementation  as  follows:  (i) \ninvestment has been provided to achieve the targeted loss reduction; (ii) GOMP is committed to \nongoing  sector  reforms  and  full  financial  independence  of  the  operating  companies;  (iii)  the \nenergy  balance  demonstrates  that  adequate  excess  will  be  available  for  purchase  within  MP \nand  from  outside  of  MP  to  meet  electricity  sales  forecasts;  (iv)  adequate  physical  and  price \ncontingencies  are  provided  to  meet  quantity  and  cost  escalations,  cost  estimates  have  been \nbased on a basket of recent tender prices, and MPERC\u2019s tariff-setting principles allow costs of \napproved investments to be passed through in the tariff; (vi) GOMP has provided assurances on \nthe  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funding;  (vii) tender  documents  are  prepared  for  Tranche  1 \ntransmission  subprojects  and  are  being  prepared  for  Tranche  2  distribution  subprojects,  and \nadvance  action  for  procurement  has  been  requested;  and  (viii)  appropriate  risk  management \nmechanisms will be incorporated in the evolving corporate governance framework.   \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n81. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  GOMP  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which have been largely incorporated in the FFA, and will be incorporated \nin the individual loan agreement(s) and project agreement(s) as applicable and mutually agreed \nbetween the Government and ADB for each project under the MFF. \n \nA. \n\nFinancial and Sector Reforms \n\nCapacity  Development.  GOMP  will  ensure  timely  implementation  of  the  capacity \n\n82. \nSector  Reforms.  The Government and GOMP will continue to emphasize and support \nthe  autonomy  of  DISCOMs,  TRANSCO,  and  TRADECO  with  respect  to  commercial, \nadministrative, and operational activities.  \n \n83. \ndevelopment program (financed by DFID).   \n \n84. \nCounterpart  Funding.  The  Government  and  GOMP  will  ensure  and  cause  the \navailability  and  timely  release  of  counterpart  funding  for  the  timely  implementation  of  each \nsubproject.  \n \n85. \nCash  Management  Responsibilities.  GOMP  will  ensure  that  the  cash  management \nresponsibilities are transferred to TRANSCO from 1 April 2008 and DISCOMs from 1 April 2009, \nso that the EAs can commence commercially independent operations, with any deficits met by \ncommercial borrowings or other satisfactory means. \n \n86. \nAudits. The EAs will engage independent private audit firms to conduct annual finmancil \nand  procurement  audits.  In  addition  the  EAs  will  ensure  that  independent  auditors  whose \n\n23 \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nqualifications, experience, and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB and GOMP conduct (i) \nenergy  audit  for  distribution  reconfiguration  and  corporatization  and  divestment,  and  (ii) \nbusiness process and performance audits in all operational areas. \n \nCorporate  Governance. The GOMP will ensure the accountability and transparency of \n87. \nEAs  is  maintained  through  the  stakeholders  meeting  and  publication  of  its  agendas,  actions \nthrough  the  duration  of  the  investment  program.  The  EAs  will  ensure  that  the  following \nmeasures to strengthen corporate governance will have been completed by 31 December 2007: \n(i) independent directors at the board level are recruited; (ii) board-level committees, including \naudit  and  risk  management  committees,  are  formed;  (iii)  internal  audit  functions  strengthened \nand  internal  audit  guidelines  in  line  with  best  practices  are  developed  (internal  audit  scope  to \ncover revenue audit and internal audit reports to the audit committee of the board); (iv) internal \ncontrollers reporting to the chairmen and managing directors of the respective EAs on a regular \nbasis are appointed.  \n \n88. \n1.2 from 2007 and onwards. \n \n89. \n2010 onwards (3 years moving average capital expenditure). \n \nB. \n\nDebt  Service  Coverage  Ratio.  The EAs will maintain a debt service coverage ratio of \n\nSelf  Financing  Ratio.  The  EAs  will  maintain  historic  self-financing  ratio  of  20%  from \n\nCommercial  \n\nTariff. DISCOMs\u2019 MYT will be effective as of 1 April 2007.  \n\n90. \nCorporate  Social  Responsibility.  DISCOMs  will  conduct  extensive  public  awareness \ncampaigns  through  installing  appropriate  signs,  issuing  flyers  to  the  public,  and  placing \nnewspaper  and  television  ads  in  local  language  to  ensure  that  people  are  aware  that  HVDS \nnetworks  may  result  in  serious  injury  or  death  in  case  of  attempts  to  illegally  connect  to \noverhead circuits. \n \n91. \n \n92. \nCustomer  Service  Centers.  By  not  later  than  31  March  2009,  DISCOMs  will  have \nestablished, made operational, and fully staffed with specialists with appropriate skills a number \nof customer service centers in large cities and a customer service center in small towns.  \n \n93. \nfrom 92% in 2006 to 96% by not later than 31 December.  \n \n94. \nLoss  Reduction. DISCOM-E will ensure that agreed loss-reduction targets are met as \nfollows; by 31 December 2007 to 32.5%, by 31 December 2008 to 29.5%, and by 31 December \n2009 to 26.5%.  \n \n95. \nTurnkey  Contracts.  The  EAs  will  (i)  ensure  utilization  of  turnkey  contracts,  where \nappropriate; (ii) negotiate longer terms of guarantees on equipment; and (iii) include long-term \nmaintenance provisions in the turnkey contracts. \n \nC. \n\nBilling and Collection Efficiency. DISCOM-E will ensure improved collection efficiency \n\nHuman Resources  \n\nRecruitment.  By  not  later  than  31  December  2008,  the  EAs  will  have  appointed \n96. \ndirectors  for  operations,  information  technology,  commercial  functions,  and  finance;  and  will \nhave  recruited  (i)  chartered  accountants,  (ii)  information  technology  specialists,  and  (iii) \n\n \n\n\fspecialists in commercial areas. The EAs will have established management training programs \nin finance, operations, and commercial functions. \n \n97. \narrears by 31 December 2008.  \n \nD. \n\nPension  Funds.  The  EAs  will  have  legally  established  trust  funds  to  cover  pension \n\nSafeguards \n\nfrom  such \n\nthe  utilities, \n\nland,  required \n\ntrees,  and  any  other  obstruction \n\nLand  Availability,  Resettlement  and \n\nIndigenous  Peoples.  GOMP  will  cause  \n98. \nrespective EAs, subject to compliance with the relevant provision of the RF and RPs and EARF \nand  EMP  and  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government  and \nMP, to acquire or make available the land and rights to land free from any encumbrances, and \nfor \ncleared \ncommencement  of  construction  activities  in  accordance  with  the  schedule  agreed  under  the \nrelated civil works contract.  \n \nGOMP  will  cause  respective  EAs  to  ensure  that  all  land  and  rights-of-way  required  by \n99. \nthe  subprojects  will  be  made  available  in  a  timely  manner  and  that  the  provisions  of  the  RPs, \nincluding  compensation  and  entitlements  for  affected  households  and  persons,  will  be \nimplemented in conformity  with all applicable laws and regulations of the Government, GOMP \nand ADB\u2019s policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and the agreed RF. \n \n100.  GOMP will cause respective EAs to ensure that affected persons by each subproject are \nfairly  compensated  in  a  timely  manner  on  replacement  values  in  accordance  with  the  related \nRPs  and  RF,  such  that  their  living  standards  are  not  adversely  affected.  The  EAs  will  submit \nprogress  and  completion  reports  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  under  the  quarterly \nprogress  reports  for  each  subproject.  In  addition,  the  external  monitoring  report  shall  be \nsubmitted to ADB on a semiannual basis for review. \n \n101.  GOMP  will  cause  respective  EAs  to  ensure  that  prior  to  land  acquisition  and  any \nresettlement under each subproject, the related RP including its update based on consensus of \nAP,  is  disclosed  with  all  necessary  information  made  available  to  persons  affected  by  the \nsubproject and confirm that it be uploaded onto ADB\u2019s web site. EAs will ensure that essential \npublic infrastructure that may be affected under land acquisition and resettlement is replaced as \nappropriate in an expeditious manner in accordance with the RPs. \n \n102.  GOMP  will  cause  respective  EAs  to  ensure  that  construction  contracts  contain  binding \nrequirements for construction contractors to fully reinstate pathways, other local infrastructures, \nand  agricultural  land  to  at  least  their  pre-project  condition  upon  construction  completion. \nProvision  should  be  made  for  adequate  recording  of  the  condition  of  roads,  agricultural  land, \nand other infrastructure prior to transport of material and construction commencement. \n \n103.  GOMP  will  cause  respective  EAs  to  ensure  that  the  requirements  set  out  in  the  IPDF \nand the Government\u2019s and GOMP\u2019s applicable loans on IP will be implemented. \n \n \n104. \nIn order to strengthen the effectiveness of stakeholder consultation and participation in \nthe  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program,  GOMP  will  cause  each  EA  to  undergo  a  full \nconsultation and participation (C and P) process including: (i) stakeholder analysis, (ii) provision \nand disclosure of documents to the stakeholders, (iii) announcement of the date for consultation \non specific issues, and (iv) adequate monitoring of the C And P process. \n \n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n105.

The \nupdate  was  formulated  considering  MPSEB  as  an  integrated  utility,  offsetting  the  cross-\n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n37 \n\ncompany  transactions  taking  place  after  implementation  of  the  transfer  scheme.  The  revised \nFRP included (i) additional provisioning for doubtful debts, and write-off of Rs3.85 billion and a \nfurther Rs0.6 billion of bad debts in MPSEB\u2019s balance sheet, and expensed before devolution to \nthe  companies;  (ii)  conversion  of  all  overdue  loans  and  bonds  from  GOMP  into  equity;  (iii) \ntransfer  of  Rural  Electrification  Corporation  loan  to  GOMP  through  adjustments  against \nreceivables  toward  free  electricity  bill  waiver  (Rs14.140  billion);  and  (iv)  adjustment  of  cross \ndues,  receivables  and  payables  and  power  purchase  receivable  and  payables  toward, \nMaharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh state electricity boards.  \n \n7. \nAs  the  result  of  the  FRP,  cleaning  up  of  balance  sheets  largely  has  been  completed \n(Table  A2.1).  The  power  sector  is  expected  to  achieve  an  accounting  profit  in  2011  with  a \nhealthier debt-equity ratio (Table A2.2). The revised FRP planned to focus on several pending \nissues;  (i)  remaining  pension  liabilities,  (ii)  contingent  liabilities,  and  (iii)  provisioning  for  non-\nmoving  items.  The  final  phase  of  the  FRP  will  be  included  as  part  of  the  next  MYT  review, \nthereby completing and consolidating the financial restructuring. \n \n\nTable A2.1 : Balance Sheet of Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board  \n(Rs million) \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n \n\n \n\nAssets \nEquity  \n\n119,935\n(1,965)\n\n    106,548\n   (14,647)\n\n116,043\n (15,634)\n\n143,077 \n (13,170) \n\n  154,853\n    44,189\n\nLiabilities \nDebt/Debt Plus Equity (%) \nCurrent Assets/Current Liabilities \n(-) = Negative \nNote: 2001 accounts are for 15 April 2000 to 31 March 2001 (as per 2002 audited accounts). \nBalance Sheet of 2005 was not audited. \n\n    57,025\n129.6\n0.61\n\n61,401\n128.6\n0.66\n\n48,202\n102.7\n1.02\n\n75,690 \n119.5 \n0.69 \n\n    51,455\n57.3\n1.26\n\n \n\nTable A2.2: Sector Financial Projections  \n(Rs million) \n\nItem \n\nRevenues \nExpenditure \nProfit or Loss \nProvision for Income Tax \nProfit or Loss After Tax \nReturn on Average Equity (%) \n \nBalance Sheet \nAssets \nPension Liability \nLong-Term Liabilities \nEquity \nTotal Equity and Liabilities \nDebt/Debt Plus Equity (%) \n(-) = Negative \nSource: Financial Restructuring Plan November, 2005. \n\n2006 \n643 \n719 \n(76) \n- \n(76) \n(10) \n \n \n1,673 \n484 \n745 \n444 \n1,673 \n45 \n\n2007 \n772 \n850 \n(78) \n- \n(78) \n(4) \n \n \n1,933 \n468 \n937 \n528 \n1,933 \n48 \n\n2008 \n1,017 \n1,064 \n(46) \n- \n(46) \n(2) \n \n \n2,196 \n447 \n1,091 \n658 \n2,196 \n50 \n\n2009 \n1,221 \n1,262 \n(41) \n- \n(41) \n(1) \n \n \n2,439 \n419 \n1,223 \n798 \n2,439 \n50 \n\n2010 \n1,378 \n1,414 \n(36) \n-\n(36) \n(1) \n \n \n2,567 \n383 \n1,320 \n863 \n2,567 \n51 \n\n2011 \n1,532 \n1,468 \n64 \n5 \n58 \n2 \n \n \n2,560 \n340 \n1,256 \n964 \n2,560 \n49 \n\n2012 \n1,671 \n1,594 \n77 \n7 \n70 \n2 \n \n \n2,510 \n288 \n1,216 \n1,006 \n2,510 \n48 \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \nC. \n\nCapacity Development \n\n8. \nSince  the  initial  power  sector  reforms,  ADB  has  taken  a  joint  approach  in  capacity \ndevelopment with other Development Partners (DPs). In tandem with the power sector financial \nand  organizational  restructuring,  ADB\u2019s  earlier  program  loan  and  sector  investment  project \nhelped  GOMP  to  (i)  improve  the  policy  environment  and  governance,  (ii)  initiate  the \nestablishment  of  a  commercial  and  competitive  business  environment  to  promote  efficiency \ngains  and  loss  reduction;  and  (iii)  introduce  a  computerized  information  and  revenue \nmanagement system. Contemporaneously, DFID implemented its \u00a310 million capacity building \nprogram.  \n\n \n\nFigure A2.3: Overview of Capacity Development Program (ADB & DFID) \n\n<DFID \u00a318.5M ($35.2M) >  \n\n<ADB  $620M  >\n\n<Phisical Investment $610M>\n\nContinued Development of \nEnabling Environment \n\n<Remaining Issues of \nMPPSDP>\n\nFinal Unbundling of \nMPSEB\n\nFurther Internal \nReforms\n\nEnhancement of \nFinancial Viability \n\n (cid:31)Policy coordination and reform \nprogramme management (GOMP)  \n-including communications, socio-economic \nand environmental issues \n<GBP 4m (+GBP 0.4m reviews and GBP 0.5m \ncontingencies)>\n(cid:31)Strengthened Regulation Function\nSupport to MPERC, including management \nsystems, stakeholder participation, recruitment \nand training <GBP 2m>\n\n(cid:31)Transfer of employees, etc.\n-HR support to the five companies, including \nstaff transfer, needs assessment, recruitment, \ntraining, reward and service rules <GBP 1m>\n\n(cid:31)Backbone MIS\n-MIS/IT support, to deliver an ERP solution for \nthe five companies <GBP1.5m + 4m>\n\n (cid:31)Financial Position Strengthening \n -Support to DISCOMs, including financial \nmanagement and accounting, \ncommercialisation, investment and business \nplanning, regulation, technical support, trading \nand market operations <GBP 3.6m>\n\n-Support to GENCO and TRANSCO, including \nfinancial management, commercialisation, \ninvestment and business planning, regulation, \ntrading and market operations <GBP1.5m>\n\n (cid:31)Phisical Capacity Expansion\n\n   \n   -Transmission -TRANSCO\n   -Distriburion-DISCOM-E\n                     -DISCOM-W\n                     -DISCOM-C\n                     TRADECO  \n \n\n<Non Physical Investment $10M>\n\n (cid:31)Empowering Trading Function \n-Support to TRADECO for development \nsystems and capacity building\n \n\n (cid:31)System Loss Reduction and \nReliability Enahncement  \n-Support to DISCOMs for implementing \nSCADA systems \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank Assessment  \n \nADB  and  DFID  have  been  exploring  a  similar  collaborative  arrangement  during \n9. \nimplementation of the Investment Program. DFID is providing up to \u00a318.5 million ($35.2 million \nas  of  21  September  2006)  in  technical  assistance  (\u00a314.5  million)  and  financial  assistance  (\u00a34 \nmillion) from 2006 to 2010, which will include (i) support to GOMP for mapping further reforms; \nincluding  subsidy  review  and  communications;  (ii)  capacity  development  in  MPERC;  (iii) \ntechnical,  business  planning,  and  financial  management  support  to  all  sector  companies \ntogether with MIS and human resources development.  \n \nTo  maximize  the  synergy  with  the  DFID  program,  a  selective  capacity  development \n10. \nprogram  is  envisaged  by  ADB,  focusing  on  implementation  support  of  SCADA  systems  in  the \nDISCOMS and TRADECO, whose future role is pivotal for the effective commercial operation of \nthe reformed sector. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n39 \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\nPOWER SECTOR ASSESSMENT \n\nNational Sector Structure \n\nIndia has confirmed its intent to provide universal power supply at an affordable price by \n1. \n2012, which will require an estimated 100,000  megawatt (MW) of new generating capacity. The \nGovernment  also  intends  to  use  more  indigenous  hydropower  resources,  thereby  shifting  the \nsupply mix in favor of hydropower at the expense of coal-fired thermal plants. Recognizing that \nthe  poor  performance  of  state  electricity  boards  in  the  past  was  a  roadblock  to  private  sector \ninvestment,  The  Government  adopted  in  2001  a  program  of  unbundling,  open  access  tariff \nrestructuring,  and  rationalization.  Independent  regulatory  bodies  also  were  established  at \ncentral  and  state  levels.  The  Electricity  Act,  2003  mandated  full  metering  for  all  consumer \nclasses,  multiyear  tariff  determinations,  tariffs  to  be  within  20%  of  the  deemed  cost  of  supply, \navailability-based tariffs, and 100% rural electrification.  \n \n2. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Ministry  of  Power  (MOP)  provides  overall  guidance  to  the  sector \nthrough  the  Central  Electricity  Authority  (CEA).  MOP  owns  central  power  utilities,  such  as  the \nNational  Thermal  Power  Cooperation,  National  Hydroelectric  Power  Cooperation,  Nuclear \nPower Cooperation, and the Powergrid Corporation of India, which are engaged in generation \nand interstate power transmission. The Rural Electrification Corporation and the Power Finance \nCorporation are Government-owned institutions dedicated to financing power sector activities. A \npower  trading  corporation  was  established  recently  to  take  responsibility  for  power  trading \namong states, as well as between states and central power utilities.  \n \nIn  technical  and  economic  matters,  MOP  is  assisted  by  CEA,  a  statutory  body \n3. \nconstituted under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, which was replaced by the  Electricity Act, \n2003.  CEA,  an  attached  office  of  MOP,  is  responsible  for  the  technical  coordination  and \nsupervision  of  programs,  and  also  is  entrusted  with  some  statutory  functions.  Headed  by  a \nchairman,  CEA  comprises  six  full-time  members.    CEA  is  responsible  for  preparing  a  national \nelectricity plan in accordance with the National Electricity Policy (NEP).  \n \n4. \nThe  Indian  Parliament  passed  the  Electricity  Regulatory  Commissions  (ERC)  Act  in \n1998, the same year the Central Energy Regulatory Commission (CERC) was established. The \nERC Act gives CERC full autonomy to regulate central power utilities and to set bulk tariffs. The \nERC  Act  also  encourages  the  states  to  establish  state  electricity  regulatory  commissions  with \nfull authority to regulate state-level power utilities. \n \nB. \n\nProvisions of Electricity Act, 2003 \n\n5. \nThe Electricity Act, 2003 is the cornerstone legislation for the power sector, and provides \nthe legal framework for the efficient development of the sector. The act is concerned primarily \nwith unbundling of state electricity boards, open access, and competition. Salient provisions of \nthe Electricity Act, 2003 are (i) exemption from licensing requirements for electricity generation, \n(ii) open access in electricity transmission, (iii) licensing for electricity trading, (iv) arrangement \nof  licenses  for  laying  lines  for  private  transmission,  (v)  promotion  of  competition  by  allowing \nmore than one distribution company in one area of supply, (vi) ensuring electricity supply to the \nconsumers at minimum standards, and (vii) provision for establishment of tribunals in place of \nthe High Court for appeals against the orders of CERC. \n \n6. \nThe act includes a provision for MOP to update regularly and publish a NEP. The current \npolicy  document  is  dated  12  February  2005.  Its  broad  policy  objectives  include  (i)  access  to \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nelectricity  for  all  households  by  2010;  (ii)  demand  to  be  fully  met  by  2012,  and  energy  and \npeaking shortages to be overcome with adequate spinning reserve available; (iii) efficient supply \nof  reliable  and  quality  power  of  specified  standards  at  reasonable  rates;  (iv)  per  capita \navailability  of  electricity  to  be  increased  to  more  than  1,000  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  by  2012;  (v) \nminimum lifeline consumption of 1 kWh per household per day by 2012; (vi) financial turnaround \nand commercial viability of the sector; and (vii) protection of consumers\u2019 interests. \n \nC. \n\nMadhya Pradesh Power Sector Structure \n\n7. \nA  vertically  integrated  monopoly,  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Electricity  Board  (MPEB), \noperated the Madhya  Pradesh (MP) power sector under state direction. MPEB interacted with \nthe  central  power  utilities  for  planning  and  coordination.  In  the  early  1990s,  MPEB  faced \nnegative  equity,  increases  in  transmission  and  distribution  losses,  power  shortages,  and  poor \nquality of power supply. From 1992, it was unable to reach the minimum return of 3% on fixed \nassets, as required by the Electricity Supply Act, 1948. As a consequence, revenue subsidies \nfrom the state government increased from 19% in 1993 to 40% in 1999 of total revenues. The \ninability  to  invest  in  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  due  to  lack  of  funds  eroded  the \nalready weak condition of the MP power sector.  \n \n8. \nMadhya  Pradesh  State  Electricity  Board.  In  2000,  the  state  of  Chhattisgarh  was \ncarved  out  of  Madhya  Pradesh  state,  and  the  MPEB  was  divided  in  Madhya  Pradesh  State \nElectricity  Board  (MPSEB)  and  Chhattisgarh  State  Electricity  Board.  The  assets  and  project-\nrelated  liabilities  were  allocated  geographically,  while  non-project  related-liabilities  were \ndistributed based on population. MPSEB assumed about 79% of the long-term debt, only 67% \nof  the  revenue  base,  and  94%  of  agricultural  consumers,  with  excess  power  generation \nallocated to the Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board. This imbalanced allocation had a negative \nimpact on MPSEB. \n \nThe  Electricity  Act,  2003,  the central  legislation,  came  into  force  on 9  June 2003.  With \n9. \nthe State Act, it envisaged the reorganization of MPSEB and introduced significant changes in \nregulatory  approaches,  open  access  to  the  grid,  and  power  trading.  Under  the  power  sector \nreform  program,  and  in  line  with  the  Electricity  Act,  2003,  Government  of  Madhya  Pradesh \n(GOMP)  has  unbundled  the  MPSEB  into  five  wholly  state-owned  government  companies: \nMadhya  Pradesh  Power  Generating  Company  Ltd  (GENCO),  Madhya  Pradesh  Power \nTransmission  Corporation  Company  Ltd  (TRANSCO),  and  three  distribution  companies \n(DISCOM-E  for  the  Eastern  area,  DISCOM-C  for  the  Central  area,  and  DISCOM-W  for  the \nWestern area). GENCO has been vested with MPSEB\u2019s generation assets and has taken over \ntheir operation, while TRANSCO has become the sole transmission company in the state. The \nbulk  power  trading  function  was  transferred  from  MPSEB  to  the  three  DISCOMs.  The  most \nrecently  incorporated  company  is  the  power  trade  company  (TRADECO),  which  took  over  the \nrole of single electricity buyer and seller from MPSEB in June 2006.  \n \n10. \nAlthough MPSEB retains few functions and staff, it is still a key stakeholder in the sector \nas  it  manages  cash  flow  for  sector  companies  and  retains  the  corporate  planning  function  for \nthe sector through its corporate planning group. In June 2005, the companies started to operate \nindependently,  with  each  distribution  company  responsible  for  collections.  However,  these \ncollections  are  transferred  to  the  escrow  account  of  MPSEB,  which  is  in  charge  of  paying  the \nliabilities of the companies. The year-end balance sheet for MPSEB as of 31 March 2005 takes \ninto  account  the  restructuring  intended  by  GOMP.  MPSEB  is  completing  accounts  to  31  May \n2005,  which  represent  its  final  accounts.  Thereafter,  successor  companies  will  report \nseparately, with the final accounts for MPSEB representing the opening position for each of the \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n41 \n\ncompanies  from  1  June  2005.  The  corporate  planning  group\u2019s  role  will  diminish  thereafter, \nalthough MPSEB plans to continue to manage cash flows until the cash deficit in the revenue \nearnings and expenditure requirements is resolved to the satisfaction of all companies.  \n \n\nFigure A3.1:  Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Structure \n\nEnergy Flow \nRevenue Flow\nCapital Flow\n\nMPERC\nState Regulator\n\nPower Purchase & \nIPP\n  \n\nPPA \n\nPPA\n\nGENCO\nGeneration Company\n\nMPSEB\nResidual of State \nElectricity Board \n\nTRADECO\nTrading \nCompany\n\nTRANSCO\nTransmission \nCompany\n\nCess/ED \n\nSubsidy \n\nGOMP \nState Government \n\nDISCOM-W\nDistribution \nCompany\n\nDISCOM-C\nDistribution \nCompany\n\nDISCOM-E \nDistribution \nCompany \n\nConsumers\n\n \n\nNote: Taxable income of the operating companies goes to the Government. \n\nSource: ADB estimate \n\n \n  \n11. \nState  Regulatory  Affairs.  The  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  Act,  1998,  provided \nfor  the  establishment  of  central  and  state  electricity  regulatory  commissions.  The  primary \nobjective  of  these  regulatory  bodies  was  to  introduce  transparency  and  economically  sound \nregulation  to  the  sector,  while  improving  the  financial  health  of  state  electricity  boards  and \nelectricity utilities. Key functions of Madhya Pradesh Electricity Commission (MPERC) include (i) \nrationalization  of  electricity  tariffs;  (ii)  regulation  of  power  systems  operation;  (iii)  reliability  and \nquality standard setting; (iv) issuance of licenses and regulation of licensees; and (v) promotion \nof competition, efficiency, and economy in the electricity industry. MPERC determines tariffs for \nwholesale,  bulk,  grid,  or  retail  electricity  based  on  tariffs  made  to  it,  and  determines  the  tariff \npayable  for  use  of  the  intrastate  transmission  facilities.  MPERC  has  the  same  powers  as  are \nvested in a civil court\u2014it can pass interim orders in any proceeding, hearing, or matter before it; \nsummon  books  and  accounts  related  to  generation,  transmission,  distribution  supply,  or \nutilization of electricity for examination; and impose penalties for contravention of provisions of \nlicensing. \n \nAlternative  Energy  Board. The MP Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd., a state government entity, \n12. \nleads alternative energy development, including energy efficiency. This entity is responsible for \nverification of energy production and consumption.  \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \nD. \n\nMadhya Pradesh Power Sector \n\n1. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n13. \nThe provision of reliable, affordable electricity is a prerequisite for economic and social \ndevelopment in MP. GOMP is driving a power sector reform process with the core objective of \nstrengthening the ability of public and private entities to deliver such an electricity supply to all \nconsumers.  The  reforms  are  underpinned  by  a  realistic  investment  program,  designed  to \nremove current constraints and to meet forecast demand growth though capacity augmentation \nand  loss  reduction,  as  well  as  a  regulatory  regime  that  recognizes  actual  and  reasonable \noperating costs in tariff setting and encourages efficient use of capital. During the Eleventh Plan \n2008\u20132012,  $5.3  billion  in  investments  are  planned,  divided  among  generation  (43%), \ntransmission (26%), and distribution (30%). GOMP has requested external financial assistance \nfor implementing critical parts of this investment program. \n \n\n2. \n\nCapacity and Constraints \n\n14. \nGeneration.  India\u2019s  western  region,  which  includes  MP,  has  37,000  MW  of  installed \ngenerating  capacity.  Coal-fired  thermal  plants  account  for  27,000  MW  of  this  capacity.  The \nWestern Region is an importer of capacity during peak periods and an exporter during off-peak \nperiods. Generation is predominantly thermal (74%), with coal-fired plants representing 58% of \ninstalled and available capacity; hydropower capacity represents 19%. The GOMP power sector \nroad map under the Eleventh Plan 2008\u20132012 is predicated on an increase in the percentage of \nhydropower in the generation mix, improvement in the plant factors of thermal stations, and loss \nreduction through targeted investments in transmission and distribution. \n \n15.  MP has suffered from chronic peak capacity and energy shortages in recent years. The \npeak deficit has exceeded 20% and the energy deficit has been about 13% for the past 3 years. \nInstalled capacity in or available to MP is about 6,300 MW, with GENCO owning and operating \nabout 3,000 MW. Generating capacity available to meet peak demand is significantly less than \ninstalled capacity (Table A3.1). \n \n\nTable A3.1: Peak Generating Capacity Available to Madhya Pradesh \n(MW) \n\nSector \n\nHydro\n\nThermal\n\n(MW) \n\nState \nPrivate / JV \nCentral (MP Share) \nEastern Region Electricity Board (EREB) \nTOTAL \n\n733\n\n1,718\n\nCurrent \nTotal\n\n2,451\n1,399\n1,396\n43\n5,289\n\nPlanned \nAdditions \nFY07 \n71\n222 \n86\n0\n379 \n\nPlanned \nCapacity \n31/3/07\n2,522\n1,621\n1,482\n43\n5,668\n\n \n\nJoint Venture (JV) \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates \n \n16. \nBased  on  consistent  growth  in  the  national  and  state  economy,  as  well  as  moderate \nincreases  in  tariffs  to  bring  them  in  line  with  the  true  cost  of  supply,  unrestricted  consumer \ndemand for energy in MP is forecast to increase at 7% a year during the Eleventh Plan 2008\u2013\n2012. This means that approximately 17,000 gigawatt-hour (GWh) of additional demand will be \nadded by early 2012. With total energy losses currently at about 41%, more than 6,000 MW of \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n43 \n\npeak generation and network capacity would need to be added over the next 5 years to serve \nthis demand.  \n \n17.  MP\u2019s  power  sector  investment  program  is  predicated  on  a  significant  reduction  in \ntechnical  and  commercial  losses,  which  would  reduce  the  additional  capacity  requirement  by \nmore  than  1,000  MW  and  return  to  a  capacity  and  energy  surplus  by  2011.  Meeting  peak \ndemand  is  problematic  and  expensive,  given  the  short  duration  and  nature  of  the  peak. \nConsequently, planned new generation is mostly base- and mid-load thermal plants.  \n \n18. \nThe  Electricity  Act,  2003  enables  a  competitive  power  market  for  all  sector  players, \nincluding  generation  companies,  to  expand  their  market  base.  As  generation  is  de-licensed, \nmajor competition is expected from independent power producers, merchant plants, and captive \nplants in addition to initiatives from the existing plants inside and outside states where they are \nlocated to increase their market share. GENCO\u2019s past and projected performance is open to the \nscrutiny of potential competitors, many of which could be in a position to cherry-pick the most \nprofitable  bilateral  power  wholesaling  opportunities.  New  entrants  benefit  from  considerably \nmore  flexibility  in  choosing  and  timing  their  investments  to  respond  to  the  market\u2019s  new  and \nevolving  needs.  GENCO  must  improve  its  performance  to  take  on  the  competition  from  other \nplayers entering into the market, and to move away from being an asset-driven company to one \nwith a commodity and trading focus. \n \n19. \nTransmission. Since 2002, transmission circuit length has increased almost 14%, while \ntransformation capacity has risen 41%. Consequently, transmission losses have been reduced \nto an acceptable level of around 5%, and availability of the transmission network has exceeded \n98% for the past year. However, due to continued growth in demand, the transmission capacity \nis  inadequate  to  serve  peak  demand.  During  2006,  the  transmission  system  served  a  record \nmaximum demand of 5,780 MW. The peak demand is expected to grow on average about 9% \nto  2012.  The  transmission  system  is  connected  with  all  neighboring  states:  Chhattisgarh, \nGujarat,  Maharashtra,  Rajasthan,  and  Uttar  Pradesh..  TRANSCO  has  382  connection  points \nwith  DISCOMs  and  43  connection  points  with  GENCO  at  the  outgoing  feeders  of  power \nstations.  \n \nNotwithstanding  the  obvious  short-  and  long-term  need  for  investment  to  increase \n20. \ncapacity,  the  transmission  system  is  in  good  condition,  maintains  acceptable  voltage  and \nstability levels most of the time, and has reasonable levels of losses. The challenge\u2014and the \nopportunity\u2014is to ensure that transmission standards do not slip in the face of ramping demand, \nincreasing  generation  levels,  and  the  additional  uncertainty  that  open  access  and  reduced \ncentralized planning impose on the transmission operator.  \n \n21.  With  the  advent  of  nondiscriminatory  open  access,  TRANSCO  is  receiving  capacity \nbuilding assistance, funded by Department for International Development of the United Kingdom \n(DFID), to (i) improve the reliability and availability of its network, (ii) increase its understanding \nof network technical capacity under normal and contingency conditions, (iii) introduce balancing \nand settlement mechanisms, and (iv) improve its ability to meter and account for transmission \ntransactions. \n \n22. \nDistribution.  The  sector  road  map  targets  100%  village  electrification  by  2008  and \n100%  household  electrification  by  2012.  This  requirement  increases  the  burden  on  MP\u2019s \nDISCOMs  to  meet  forecast  demand  growth,  reduce  losses,  and  improve  reliability  of  supply. \nPerformance  in  these  areas  has  been  poor,  and  historical  investment  has  failed  to keep  pace \nwith growth. Losses for DISCOMs still exceed 35%, power transformer capacity is inadequate to \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nmeet diversified demand on 11 kilovolt (kV) feeders in many areas, 33 kV and 11 kV feeders are \nbeing  loaded  in  excess  of  thermal  limits,  and  distribution  failure  rates  are  about  19%.  Power \nquality  is  poor  due  to  undersized  conductors,  long  Low  Voltage  (LV)  circuits,  and  distribution \ntransformer  overloading.  The  introduction  of  computerized  power  systems  analysis  has \nunderscored the widespread nature of these problems throughout the state. \n \n23. \ninstallation  of  equipment  have \ncompromised  safety  on  the  networks  of  the  three  DISCOMs.  Losses  arising  from  poorly \nexecuted  connections  at  distribution  transformers  are  suspected  to  be  far  higher  than  normal. \nWhile improving and modernizing these practices will be a challenge, it is essential if targeted \nsystems and corporate performance improvements are to be realized. \n \n\nInadequate  maintenance  practices  and  poor \n\n3. \n\nInvestment Program \n\n24. \nIn summary, the power sector faces the following challenges: (i) generation capacity is \ninsufficient  to  meet  peak  demand,  necessitating  scheduled  and  unscheduled  load  shedding, \nwhich  constitutes  a  major  impediment  to  economic  development  in  MP;  (ii)  transmission \ncapacity is barely adequate and security of supply is at risk; and (iii) the absence of a framework \nfor long-term distribution planning and a lack of funding has led to significant underinvestment in \nthe  distribution  network  and  poor  maintenance  of  equipment.  Consequently,  the  network  is \noverstretched, losses are high, and reliability and quality of supply is poor. \n \n25. \nThe economic performance of MP has lagged that of India in recent years. Gross state \nproduct  grew  at  2.5%  in  2004\u20132005,  compared  with  Indian  gross  domestic  product  growth  of \nabout  7%.  Energy  intensity  of  output  is  also  relatively  low  compared  to  the  rest  of  India. \nHowever, forecasts indicate a significant improvement in MP\u2019s economic performance, which is \nexpected  to  match  or  exceed  that  of  neighboring  states  during  the  Eleventh  Plan  2008\u20132012. \nThis,  in  turn,  will  drive  strong  growth  in  electricity  demand.  The  objective  of  full  household \nelectrification by 2012 is expected to generate further growth in electricity demand. Table A3.2 \nsummarizes demand projections through the end of the Eleventh Plan.  \n \n\nTable A3.2: Demand Projections per Eleventh Plan  \n(GWh) \n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\nEleventh Plan\n2010 \n\n2009\n\nForecast demand (including T & D losses) \nAnnual growth \nCAGR \n\n39,183\n\n7.1%\n\n41,808\n6.7%\n\n44,943\n7.5%\n\n48,545 \n8.0% \n\n52,114\n7.4%\n\n55,142\n5.8%\n\nCAGR = , GWh = giga watt, T & D = Transmission and Distribution \nSource: ADB estimate \n \n26. \nTo meet this demand growth and to reinforce existing system constraints, an investment \nof approximately Rs248 billion ($5.3 billion) will be required. Investments are closely linked\u2014the \ngeneration  requirement  is  predicated  on  loss-reduction  targets  at  the  distribution  level  being \nachieved,  while  the  transmission  investment  is  driven  by  the  requirement  to  evacuate  power \nfrom  new  generating  plants,  and  to  supply  peak  capacity  to  distribution  off-take  points.  In  this \ncontext,  investment  plan  components  are  interdependent,  and  the  timing  of  physical \nimplementation is important if purported benefits are to be delivered. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n45 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE POWER SECTOR  \n\n \n1. \nIndia\u2019s  power  sector  has  received  a  major  portion  of  its  external  assistance  from  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  Canadian  International  Development  Agency,  the \nDepartment  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational  Cooperation,  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  of  the  Government  of  Germany,  the \nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  and  the  World  Bank.

\nbeen  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects. The financial evaluation covers Madhya Pradesh Power \nTransmission  Company  Limited  (TRANSCO)  and  Madhya  Pradesh  Poorv  Kshetra  Vidyut \nVitaran Company Limited (DISCOM-E). All financial costs and benefits have been expressed in \nconstant 2006 prices. Cost streams used for the purposes of determining the financial internal \nrate  of  return  (FIRR)\u2014i.e.,  capital  investment,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and \nadministration\u2014are  those  costs  of  delivering  the  estimated  benefits.  The  weighted  average \ncosts  of  capital  (WACC)  of  TRANSCO  for  the  proposed  subprojects  under  Tranche  1  and  of \nDISCOM-E  for  the  proposed  subprojects  under  Tranche  2  also  were  calculated.  These  were \ncompared with the FIRRs to ascertain the financial viability of the subprojects. The sensitivity of \nthe FIRR to adverse movements in the underlying assumptions also was assessed. Based on \nthis analysis, the investment program under Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 is financially viable.  \n \nB. \n\nTariff Policy \n\nIn  compliance  with  the  National  Electricity  Policy  (NEP),  Madhya  Pradesh  Electricity \n2. \nRegulatory  Commission  (MPERC)  promulgated  in  2006  a  distribution  and  retail  tariff  order  for \n2007, as well as the first multiyear tariff (MYT) order for generation and transmission covering \n2007\u20132009.  MPERC  requires  TRANSCO  to  base  its  tariff  on  full  cost  recovery  of  the  loan \ninterest  costs,  depreciation,  return  on  equity,  (O&M)  expenses,  administrative  and  general \nexpenses,  repair  and  maintenance  expenses,  interest  on  working  capital,  MPERC  fee,  and \nincome  taxes.  For  distribution,  MPERC  has  approved  the  full  cost  recovery  tariff  for  2007 \n(Rs3.49 per unit on average), with the MYT for  distribution to be approved by March 2007 for \n2008\u20132010.  Given  the  proper  implementation  of  the  tariff  policy,  TRANSCO  is  projected  to \nmaintain profitability over the years, while DISCOM-E will achieve profitability by 2008. \n \nC. \n\nMethodology and Assumptions \n\n3. \nIncremental  costs  and  benefits  were  computed  based  on  \u201cwith\u201d  and  \u201cwithout\u201d  project \nscenarios for each of the components. The costs of each component include land acquisition, \ncivil  works,  equipment,  incremental  operating  and  maintenance  costs,  and  distribution  cost. \nTaxes and duties were included, while price contingencies and interest during construction were \nexcluded. The anticipated capital mix of debt and equity was used for estimating the WACC for \neach component.  \n \nTRANSCO  charges  a  one-part  (Rs/Mega  Watt/month)  uniform  tariff  for  access  to  its \n4. \ntransmission  network.  This  tariff  is  determined  based  on  full  cost  recovery  and  an  adequate \nreturn on investment. Therefore, the projected financial benefit stream for TRANSCO is simply \nthe recovery of allowable expenses\u2014primarily additions to its asset base.1 Since tax is a tariff \npass-through item, financial analysis for TRANSCO was carried out on a pre-tax basis. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Although TRANSCO is subject to MYT for FY2007\u20132009, it is entitled to petition MPERC to have assets added to \nits regulated asset base within the regulatory period, allowing it to earn revenue immediately on the new assets. In \nother  words,  TRANSCO  does  not  need  to  wait  until  the  subsequent  regulatory  period  to  have  revenue-earning \nassets added to its asset base. \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\nFor  the  distribution  subprojects,  the  incremental  financial  benefits  are  the  additional \n5 \nelectricity  sold  and  reduced  electricity  purchased,  both  of  which  arise  from  decreased  losses, \nincreased  distribution  capacity,  and  improved  reliability.  In  some  cases,  subprojects  were \nascribed more specific benefits, including reduction in (O&M) costs. Cost of energy purchased \nand  end-use  tariffs,  as  set  by  MPERC  in  its  determination  for  2007  and  those  projected  for \n2008\u20132016, were used to value benefits.  \n \n6. \nCapital costs were estimated in Indian rupees using a basket of tender prices submitted \nduring  2005  and  2006.  An  allowance  of  10%  for  physical  contingencies  was  added.  The \nevaluation was undertaken over 20 years following commissioning with residual value assumed \nat year 20, based on estimated remaining physical life of assets. O&M costs were estimated at \n1.5%\u20132.0% of capital costs, although for some subprojects an expected reduction in O&M costs \nwas included as a benefit. \n \nD. \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital  \n\nThe WACC is calculated for the ADB projects in Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 during 2007\u2013\n7. \n2012  (Tables  A9.1  and  A9.2).  For  estimating  WACC,  ADB  is  assumed  to  finance  63%  of \nTRANSCO and 57% of DISCOM-E subprojects costs through proposed Tranche 1 and Tranche \n2.  The  Government  would  onlend  the  funds  with  the  same  duration,  20  years  with  a  5-year \ngrace period, in rupees to GOMP, which would onlend to TRANSCO at 6.8%. TRANSCO and \nDISCOM-E  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk.  The  balance  will  be  financed  through  Power \nFinance Corporation at an interest rate of 10.5%, internal funds, and GOMP equity. The cost of \nequity is assumed as per MPERC allowance of 14% in the case of TRANSCO and DISCOM-E. \nA domestic inflation rate of 5.4% also is assumed. The pretax WACC for TRANSCO, therefore, \nis estimated at 3.4%. Income tax is a pass-through item based on actual tax payments. In the \ncase of DISCOM-E, the after-tax WACC assuming a corporate income rate of 30% is 2.3% \n \n\nTable A9.1: Weighted Average Cost of Capital for TRANSCO  \n\nItem \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nWeigh \n(%) \n\nADB Loan \nDomestic Loan \nEquity Contribution \n \n\nTotal \n\n106.0 \n30.0 \n32.0 \n168.0 \n\n62.9\n17.9\n19.2\n100.0\n\nNominal \nCost  \n(%) \n\n6.8\n10.5\n14.0\n\nTax Adj. \nNominal \nCost (%) \n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\nReal \nCost  \n(%) \n\nComposite \nCost \n(%) \n\n1.32 \n4.86 \n8.19 \n \n\n0.83\n0.80\n1.72\n3.35\n\n\u2014 = no data available, ADB = Asian Development Bank, Adj. = adjusted. \n    Source: ADB staff estimates \n \n\nTable A9.2: Weighted Average Cost of Capital for DISCOM-E \n\nItem \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nWeigh \n(%) \n\nADB Loan \nGovernment Loan \nEquity Contribution \n \n\nTotal \n\n45.0 \n11.0 \n24.0 \n80.0 \n\n56.6\n13.4\n30.0\n100.0\n\n( ) = negative, ADB = Asian Development Bank, Adj. = adjusted. \nSource: ADB staff estimates \n \n\nNominal \nCost  \n(%) \n\n6.8\n10.5\n14.0\n\nTax Adj. \nNominal \nCost (%) \n4.74\n7.34\n14.0\n\nReal \nCost  \n(%) \n(0.60) \n1.87 \n8.19 \n \n\nComposite \nCost \n(%) \n\n(0.35)\n0.26\n2.43\n2.34\n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n61 \n\nE. \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return and Net Present Value Calculation   \n\n8. \nIncremental  cash  flows  attributable  to  the  proposed  investments  in  TRANSCO  and \nDISCOM-E  were  estimated  based  on  the  methodology  and  assumptions  described  on  Tables \nA9.1 and 9.2.

The current \ntariff  has  taken  the  investment  plan  into  account.  If  necessary,  regulated  entities  can  submit \nrevised  asset  capitalization  and  financing  plans,  and  MPERC  will  adjust  the  determination \naccordingly.  The  risk  of  tariffs  being  lowered  does  not  exit,  because  they  will  not  be  changed \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\nunless  MPERC  is  petitioned  by  the  regulated  entities  to  do  so.  Volume  (i.e.,  demand)  risk  is \nminimal  since  the  current  system  is  peak-constrained  and  energy-constrained.  Loss-reduction \ntargets, while aggressive, are realistic as long as the proposed investment program proceeds. \nGeopolitical  and  political  risks  are  present  for  all  projects  in  India.  However,  the  number  and \nnature of investments, and their geographical spread, diversifies this risk. Therefore, the overall \nrisk to the financial sustainability of TRANSCO and DISCOM-E is deemed to be minimal. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject-Specific Risks \n\n10. \nFinancial risks at the subproject level include increases in prices of equipment, delays in \nproject implementation, and failure to gain access to necessary counterpart funds. These risks \nare  considered  low  for  the  following  reasons:  (i)  the  cost  estimates  were  based  on  recent \ntenders  received,  and  advanced  procurement  will  lessen  the  time  between  loan  effectiveness \nand disbursement; (ii) TRANSCO\u2019s implementation capacity is proven based on the past ADB \nproject,  while  DISCOM-E\u2019s  implementation  capacity  might  require  support  as  the  staff  have \nlimited  experience  implementing  ADB  projects;  (iii)  although  TRANSCO  and  DISCOM-E  have \nnot  become  fully  independent  in  terms  of  cash  flow  management,  the  financial  projections \ndemonstrate satisfactory cash flows from 2008 to meet the repayment of debt associated with \nthe investment.  \n \nG. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n11. \nSeparate  analyses  were  carried  out  for  TRANSCO  and  DISCOM-E  to  examine  the \nsensitivity of the FIRR and net present value to adverse changes in key variables. The variables \nconsidered for the sensitivity analyses were (i) 10% increase in capital costs, (ii) 10% increase \nin O&M costs, (iii) 10% decrease in revenues (allowable costs), (iv) 2-year implementation delay \nwith a 20% increase in costs, and (v) no allowance for residual values.

The Madhya \nPradesh  State  Electricity  Board  (MPSEB)  has  been  unbundled  into  six  new  power  sector \ncompanies  for  generation,  transmission,  distribution,  and  most  recently  for  trading.  In  2003, \nGovernment  of  Madhya  Pradesh  (GOMP)  prepared  a  financial  restructuring  plan  to  make  the \nsector financially healthy. GOMP restructured the sector by injecting equity and taking over loan \narrears  and  in  lieu  of  rural  electrification  loans  and  subsidy  arrears.  Assets  were  transferred, \nwhile  commercial  and  contractual  mechanisms  were  set  up.  In  June  2005,  opening  balance \nsheets  for  each  new  company  were  established,  and  the  companies  started  to  operate \nindependently.  The  companies  are  still  operating  under  the  accounting  system  inherited  from \nMPSEB, as required by the Electricity Supply Act, 1948; and annual statement of accounts are \nprepared  following  the  Electricity  Supply  Annual  Account  Rules,  1985  (ESAAR).  Per  the \nCompanies  Act  1956,  the  new  companies  are  required  to  comply  with  the  Indian  Accounting \nStandards. As such, they must prepare the annual financial statements an accrual basis and file \naudited accounts within 6 months of the financial year. \n \n2. \nThe  sector  companies  are  still  in  transition,  moving  from  reporting  under  ESAAR  to \ncomplying  with  new  requirements.  After  the  sector  reforms,  GOMP  undertook  a  diagnostic \nneeds  assessment  of  the  financial  management  structure  capability  of  the  companies,  which \nidentified  technical,  commercial,  financial,  and  management  constraints  in  the  power  sector. \nKey  areas  recognized  included  the  design  and  implementation  of  a  \u201cbackbone\u201d  enterprise \nresource planning system covering billing and collection, finance and accounting, metering data \nmanagement  and  management  information  systems,  materials  management,  project  systems, \nhuman resources and e-mail solutions, and appropriate network infrastructure and support. The \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  verified  the  needs  assessment  with  financial  management \nassessment  questionnaires  completed  by  each  sector  company.  ADB  supports  short-term \ninitiatives  undertaken  by  the  companies:  the  request 1   of  new  billing,  accounting,  and \nmanagement  information  systems  typical  for  commercial  power  utilities  operations,  which  will \nallow  the  companies  to  be  ready  for  the  proposed  ADB  investments.  GOMP  has  requested \nassistance from the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom (DFID) to \naddress  the  identified  weaknesses.  A  nonphysical  investment  component  for  capacity \ndevelopment  is  being  provided, 2   complementing  ADB\u2019s  proposed  physical  investments. \nCapacity  development  covers  (i)  financial  management  through  financial  policies,  cost  and \nrevenue centers, planning, modeling, controls, and reporting; (ii) accounting systems, including \nspecification  of  long-term  requirements  and  chart  of  accounts;  (iii)  human  resource  strategies, \nincluding  recruitment  procedures  and  supporting  mechanisms;  (iv)  materials  and  asset \nmaintenance management, project management, and technical applications; and (v) regulatory \nsupport with tariff filing applications. \n \nThe  respective  executing  agencies  have  well-staffed  project  management  offices. \n3 \nTRANSCO implemented the previous ADB loan in a timely and efficient manner. Also under the \nESAAR  system,  the  executing  agencies\u2019  accounts,  projects  accounts,  and  audit  opinion  have \nbeen  complied  with.  The  proposed  short-term \nfinancial \nmanagement  arrangements  proposed  by  GOMP  for  the  sector  companies  are  considered \nappropriate  for  proper  project  financial  management,  reporting,  and  implementation  of  the \nmultitranche financing facility. \n\ninitiatives  are  adequate.  The \n\n                                                 \n1 Tenders are being prepared with expected approval in January 2007. \n2 DFID is providing \u00a318.5 million in technical assistance (\u00a314.5 million) and financial assistance (\u00a34 million) from 2006 \n\nto 2010. \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\nPAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS FOR SECTOR COMPANIES \n\n \nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nA  vertically  integrated  monopoly,  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Electricity  Board  (MPEB), \n1. \noperated  the  Madhya  Pradesh  (MP)  power  sector.  In  the  early  1990s,  MPEB  faced  negative \nbalance  sheets,  increases  in  transmission  and  distribution  losses,  power  shortages,  and  poor \nquality of power supply. Since 1992, it was unable to reach the minimum return of 3% on fixed \nassets, as required by the Electricity Supply Act, 1948. In 2000, when the state of Chhattisgarh \nwas  carved  out  of  Madhya  Pradesh,  the  MP  State  Electricity  Board  (MPSEB)  was  created. \nMPEB  assets  and  project-related  liabilities  were  allocated  geographically,  while  non-project-\nrelated  liabilities  were  distributed  base  on  the  population.  MPSEB  assumed  about  79%  of  the \nlong-term  debt,  67%  of  the  revenue  base,  and  94%  of  agricultural  consumers,  with  excess \npower  generation  allocated  to  the  Chhattisgarh  state.  This  imbalanced  allocation  worsened \nMPSEB\u2019s  financial  position  as  follows:  (i)  estimated  transmission  and  distribution  losses \nreached  about  49%  in  2001,  (ii)  per  unit  cost  of  generation  increased,  and  (iii)  unfavorable \nconsumer  mix,  and  consequently  lower  average  realization  per  unit  compared  to  the \nChhattisgarh  State  Electricity  Board,  resulted.  The  series  of  the  power  sector  reforms  by  the \ngovernment of Madhya  Pradesh (GOMP), supported  by the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) \nMadhya  Pradesh  Power  Sector  Development  Program  (MPPSDP),  helped  to  improve  the \nfinancial position of the MP power sector. \n \nB. \n\nPast Financial Performance \n\nThe  MP  power  sector  has  reduced  financial  losses  from  Rs13.71  million  in  2002  to \n2. \nRs2.680 billion in 2005. The improvement of the financial situation is attributable to an increase \nin sales in 2001\u20132005, and of a decline in interest charges as a result of the positive impact of \nthe  power  sector  financial  restructuring.  The  financial  improvements  were  demonstrated  by \nactual  results  compared  with  those  forecasted  in  the  2001  report  and  recommendation  of  the \nPresident  for  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Power  Sector  Development  Program.    The  forecasted  loss \nlevel  in  2002  was  much  lower  than  projected,  and  the  debt  to  debt-plus-equity  ratio  declined \nfrom 103% in 2001 to 57% in 2005. Prior period adjustments of Rs15.119 billion resulted in a \nsubstantial increase in cash in 2005, allowing a decline in accumulated losses to Rs9.492 billion \ncompared  with  Rs23.614  billion  in  2004.  In  2005,  retirement  of  Rs35.149  billion  of  capital \narrears  and  an  equity  injection  by  GOMP  of  Rs44.125  billion  allowed  reduction  of  debt  and \nsignificant strengthening of the balance sheet before transfer of assets and liabilities to the new \nsector companies. Even with an improvement in the financial situation over this period, MPSEB \nhas  not  been  able  to  achieve  profitability  because  of  (i)  insufficient  tariff  to  cover  the  cost  of \nsupply;  (ii)  non-remunerative  investments  in  rural  electrification  schemes  for  the  purpose  of \nserving  the  social  obligations  of  GOMP;  (iii)  tariff  subsidy  from  GOMP  was  received  mostly \nthrough  adjustments  than  cash  in  the  early  years,  aggravating  the  poor  cash  flow;  (iv)  high \ncommercial and technical losses in distribution; and (v) lower plant load factor and high station \nheat rate of its generating plants. The past performance of MPSEB is in Table A11.1.  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n65 \n\nC. \n\nOpening Balance Sheets of the Companies \n\nMPSEB allocated assets and liabilities to the individual companies as of 31 May 2005.1 \n3. \nAs these balance sheets were only provisional, they  were  not based on the year-end balance \nsheets  of  MPSEB  as  at  31  March  2005.  MPSEB  has  undertaken  to  provide  the  operating \ncompanies  a  final  balance  sheet  by  30  November  2006.  The  Corporate  Planning  Group  of \nMPSEB  anticipated  little  change  in  the  opening  balance  sheets,  except  that  MPSEB-allocated \nloans might increase by Rs500 million, spread equally among the companies. Madhya Pradesh \nElectricity  Regulatory  Commission  has  used  the  companies\u2019  opening  fixed  assets and  work  in \nprogress  (as  of  31  May  2005)  to  determine  the  allocation  of  equity  and  loans  between  fixed \nassets in operation and work in progress. In some instances, however, the companies claim that \nassets  at  that  date  have  been  put  into  service  and  should  be  allowed  to  expense  rather  than \ncapitalize interest and claim a return to equity.  \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Projections of Executing Agencies \n\nThis  section  sets  out  the  financial  projections  for  the  executing  agencies.  The  inflation \n4. \nand exchange rate assumptions are ADB estimates. Domestic inflation is projected at 5.5% for \n2006, 4.5% for 2007, 4.3% for 2008, and 4.1% from 2009 on. International inflation is assumed \nat  1.6%  for  2006,  2.8%  for  2007,  and  1.2%  from  2008  on.  Foreign  exchange  costs  are \nforecasted  to  decline  by  the  international  and  domestic  inflation  differential  2   to  maintain \npurchasing  power  parity,  and  are  converted  to  the  Indian  rupees  by  the  exchange  rate  of  the \ndraw year. \n \nMadhya  Pradesh  Transmission  Company  Limited  (TRANSCO).  The  company\u2019s \n5. \nprofitability is expected to grow in line with improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of \nits  operational  performance,  moving  toward  the  return  on  equity  ceiling  of  14%  allowed  under \nthe  current  regulations.  The  project  funding  will  enable  TRANSCO  to  undertake  the  planned \ninvestment.  Projected  financial  performance  indicators  improve  over  the  forecast  period  and \nshow adequate debt service coverage throughout the project. Self-financing capacity improves \ntoward the end of the forecast period, indicating TRANSCO\u2019s capacity to meet at least 20% of \ncapital expenditures from internal sources from 2013 onward. From 2008 on, the debt service \ncoverage ratio will exceed 1.2 in all years, while the debt to debt-plus-equity ratio declines from \n67%  in  2007  to  45%  by  2016.  The  summary  of  TRANSCO\u2019s  financial  projections  is  in  Table \nA11.2. \n \n6. \nMadhya  Pradesh  DISCOM  East  Company  Limited  (DISCOM-E).  DISCOM-E\u2019s \nfinancial  projections  show  that,  with  the  progressive  tariff  increases  approved  by  MPERC, \nprofitability  will  be  achieved  by  2008.  DISCOM-E\u2019s  return  on  equity  will  be  positive  from  2008 \non, while return on average net fixed assets will increases to 13.7% in 2008 and remain above \n16% thereafter. Debt to debt-plus-equity ratio is forecasted to fall from 68.3% in 2006 to 39.6% \nby 2012, and then to 24.4% by 2016. ADB would fund about 56% of the proposed projects, with \nthe  balance  to  be  funded  by  internal  funds,  equity  injections  by  GOMP,  and  Power  Finance \nCorporation  at  10.5%  interest  repayable  over  10  years.  With  the  proposed  tariffs,  cash  flow is \nstrong,  and  the  debt  service  ratio  is  expected  to  exceed  1.3  in  all  years.  The  self-financing \ncapacity  exceeds  20%  from  2009.  Cash  available  from  operations  more  than  doubles  from \nRs2.089  billion  in  2008  to  Rs4.342  billion  in  2016,  with  debt  service  increasing  from  Rs1.593 \n                                                 \n1  This  balance  sheet  is  without  considering  the  impact  of  the  Government  order,  dated  4  November  2004,  on  the \nMPSEB/  Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board split as it is being contested by MPSEB and GOMP in the Supreme \nCourt. \n\n2   Assuming all other assumptions do not change. \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\nbillion to Rs3.037 billion over the same period. Capital expenditures decline from Rs8.753 billion \nin  2008  to  Rs4.342  billion  in  2016.  The  decline  in  capital  expenditure  is  the  result  of  the \ncompletion  of  the  national  rural  electrification  program  with  100%  rural  electrification  achieved \nby 2009 and the bulk of the states distribution network in place.

The \nevaluation  covers  Tranche  1  for  Madhya  Pradesh  Power  Transmission  Company  Limited \n(TRANSCO),  and  Tranche  2  for  Madhya  Pradesh  Poorv  Kshetra  Vidyut  Vitaran  Company \nLimited (DISCOM-E). All costs and benefits have been expressed at a constant 2006 prices. A \ndomestic price numeraire was used; tradable inputs were valued at their border price equivalent \nand  converted  into  domestic  equivalents  using  an  estimated  standard  exchange  rate  factor \n(SERF)  of  1.05.  Capital  costs  included  physical  contingencies,  but  excluded  taxes,  price \ncontingencies, and financial charges during construction. \n \nB. \n\nProject Benefits  \n\nThe main economic benefits of the subprojects in Madhya Pradesh (MP) are displaced \n2. \nthermal  electricity  generation  and  incremental  consumption.  These  benefits  arise  from  a \nreduction in technical and non technical losses, removal of network constraints, and improved \nreliability of supply. Benefits were quantified through load flow analyses and from pilot studies \nin  other  states.  Demand  forecasts,  prepared  by  TRANSCO  with  input  from  DISCOMs,  were \nbased on projections of historical sales data, modified by population growth, the impact of real \ntariff increases, and the impact of real increases in household income. \n \nDetailed analysis by TRANSCO confirmed that the transmission component is the least-\n3. \ncost transmission solution to achieve the desired outcomes. It confirmed that the transmission \ncomponent  was  overall  least-cost  by  comparing  the  discounted  cost  with  an  equivalent \ngeneration  project\u2014i.e.,  an  electricity  generation  plant  or  plants,  built  at  or  close  to  the  load \ncenter,  that  would  be  capable  of  producing  the  same  level  of  output  as  the  savings  in  losses \nand incremental demand served that the transmission component of the Project delivers. At a \n12% discount rate, the leveled cost of the transmission project is approximately Rs1.3 per kWh. \nThis  compares  to  the  long-run  marginal  cost  of  the  equivalent  peak  and  off-peak  plant  (on  a \nweighted average basis) of Rs3.1 per kWh. Transmission reinforcement, therefore, is the least-\ncost means of removing the peak constraints on the transmission network and reducing losses.  \n \n4. \nNo viable alternatives are available for 100% consumer metering, substation projection \nupgrading,  and  remote  metering.  In  the  case  of  High  Voltage  Distribution  System  (HVDS), \nDISCOM-E  has  confirmed  that  other  means  to  achieve  similar  reductions  in  technical  and \ncommercial  losses  have  been  explored,  and  HVDS  has  been  identified  as  least-cost.  The \ntransmission  component  is  concerned  primarily  with  relieving  transmission  constraints.  The \ndistribution  component  focuses  on  making  delivery  more  efficient  on  an  isolated  subproject \nbasis.  Therefore,  as  the  two  components  are  largely  independent,  they  were  analyzed \nseparately rather than using the systems approach. Non-incremental outputs from transmission \nand distribution components were valued at the resource cost savings that would accrue if the \nproject  was  to  proceed.  Analysis  of  the  electrical  capacity  and  energy  demand  and  supply \nbalance  in  MP  demonstrates  that  (i)  any  reduction  in  peak  losses  will  result  in  incremental \ndemand being served in most years; and (ii) any reduction in off-peak load will mean that less \ngeneration will be required to serve the same level of demand, and will result in a resource cost \nsaving.  \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1997 Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n69 \n\n \n\n \n5. \nThe  marginal  cost  of  electricity  from  coal-fired  thermal  plants  represents  the  short-run \nmarginal  cost  of  off-peak  energy  in  MP.  Marginal  costs  of  existing  coal  plants  were  estimated \nbased on actual historical operating parameters contained in generating company\u2019s most recent \ntariff petition. Coal fuel was initially valued at its border price equivalent value (BPEV), based on \nthe World Bank\u2019s coal price forecast and adjusted for the generally lower quality of coal used for \npower  generation  in  India.  Loading  and  transport  costs  excluding  were  added  to  base  coal \nprices  to  derive  a  2007  BPEV  of  Rs2,400  per  ton.  A  discounted  average  marginal  generating \ncost of Rs1.9 per kWh for electricity delivered at the power station gate was calculated. \n \n6. \nIdeally, additional hydropower capacity or open cycle gas turbines would be added in the \nlonger term to cope with the growth in peak demand. In practice, however, the long lead times \nfor hydropower coupled with the additional development risk it poses, as well as the difficulties \nin securing long-term gas supply, have meant that few new peaking plants are planned. Instead, \nadditional thermal base load plant is being added, moving hydropower from mid-load and peak-\nload  duty  into  dedicated  peaking.  Therefore,  it  has  been  assumed  that  the  short-run  marginal \ncost  of  peak  energy  is  set  by  the  marginal  cost  of  coal-fired  thermal  plant  and  the  long-run \nmarginal  cost  of  peak  energy  by  the  life  cycle  cost  of  coal-fired  thermal  plant.  International \nEnergy  Association 2   and  Royal  Academy  of  Engineering 3   data  were  used  to  establish \ninternational  benchmarks  for  the  performance  and  costs  of  modern  thermal  plant.  Leveled  life \ncycle cost of a new coal-fired plant was estimated to be Rs2.3 per kWh. \n \n7. \nIncremental  outputs  were  valued  using  consumers\u2019  estimated  willingness  to  pay  for \nincremental  consumption.  For  domestic  consumption,  a  semi-log  demand  function  was \nestimated, following the methodology outlined in ADB\u2019s Economic Relations Division Technical \nNote No. 3 \u201cMeasuring Willingness to Pay for Electricity.\u201d The demand function then was tested \nagainst  MP  data  from  earlier  years  and  found  to  be  a  reasonable  fit.  Suppressed  demand  is \naround  13%  of  energy  demand.  Solving  the  demand  function  for  q  =  804  kWh  gives  a \nwillingness  to  pay  for  additional  units  of  consumption  of  Rs3.03  per  kWh.  For  other  consumer \ncategories, the marginal tariff was taken as a conservative proxy for their willingness to pay. The \nweighted average willingness to pay for all MP consumers supplied at Low Voltage is Rs3.2 per \nkWh on this basis. For Medium Voltage customers the figure is Rs4.0 per kWh. \n \nC. \n\nEstimation of Economic Internal Rate of Return \n\n8. \nThe  project  evaluation  is  based  on  a  comparison  of  benefits  and  costs  between  the \nproject  (base)  case  and  the  without  project  (alternative)  case.  A  period  of  25  years  has  been \nused  for  economic  evaluation,  including  3  years  for  construction.  The  detailed  benefit-cost \ncalculations  show  that  the  transmission  and  distribution  components  are  expected  to  be \neconomically viable. The transmission component has an estimated Economic Internal Rate of \nReturn  (EIRR)  of  15.0%, 4   and  the  combined  distribution  component  an  estimated  EIRR  of \n14.7%.

Subprojects will improve significantly the quality \nof  supply  to  consumers  through  improved  voltage,  reduced  harmonic  content,  and  more \nconsistent  frequency.  Reliability  will  be  improved  through  a  reduction  in  nuisance  tripping  of \nlines  and  substations,  and  through  reduced  requirements  for  load  shedding.  However,  a \nvaluation  of  the  improvement  that  supply  quality  and  reliability  would  have  on  consumers\u2019 \nwillingness  to  pay  for  incremental  consumption  was  not  attempted.  In  other  words,  it  was \nconservatively  assumed  that  consumers\u2019  demand  functions  would  not  change,  despite  a \nsignificant  improvement  in  the  overall  quality  of  electricity  that  they  receive.  Moreover,  the \nassumption of coal-fired thermal power stations as the displaced peaking plant does not reflect \nthe  need  in  the  longer  term  to  construct  gas  or  hydropower  peaking  plants  to  load-following \nduties during peak supply periods. \n \n10. \nCare  was  taken  to  avoid  \u201cdouble  counting\u201d  of  benefits  across  the  transmission  and \ndistribution  components.  The  transmission  component  is  focused  primarily  on  relieving \ntransmission  network  constraints.  As  such,  benefits  are  largely  independent  of  work  on \nremoving  distribution  constraints.  Moreover,  general  expansion  of  distribution  networks  will \noccur  in  both  \u201cwith  (transmission)  project\u201d  and  \u201cwithout  (transmission)  project\u201d  cases. \nFurthermore,  demand  growth  beyond  the  end  of  construction  of  the  transmission  component \nhas  not  been  included  in  benefit  quantification.  In  this  context,  the  EIRR  for  the  transmission \ncomponent is a conservative estimate. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n71 \n\nThe project would be effective in reducing poverty. A secure and predictable electricity \n11. \nsupply  will  enable  social  and  economic  benefits  to  materialize,  as  well  as  ensure  improved \nconditions for schools, hospitals, and other social services. The investment program will enable \nurban and rural domestic consumers to receive a supply of electricity at an acceptable voltage \nlevel, and with minimal scheduled and unscheduled outages. Rural consumers particularly will \nsee a significantly improved electricity supply, unaffected by the lengthy scheduled outages that \nare experienced currently. This will have positive outcomes for educational and social activities, \nand will open up opportunities for energy-dependent rural enterprise. Industrial and commercial \nconsumers  also  will  benefit  from  improved  supply  reliability  and  quality,  enhancing  production \nand  output  and  leading  to  fewer  equipment  failures.  In  addition,  the  investment  program  will \ncreate short-term and long-term employment opportunities and tax revenues.  \n \n12. \nfinancial sustainability of the executing agencies (EAs).5\n \nD. \n\nA transparent tariff-setting regime that permits full recovery of efficient costs supports the \n\nSensitivity and Risk Analysis \n\n13. \nThe  sensitivity  of  the  EIRR  to  various  input  assumptions  also  was  tested.  For  the \ntransmission and distribution components, EIRRs exceed the assumed hurdle rate of 12% for all \nsensitivities tested, except for the combined downside scenario for the transmission component. \nBased on these results, subprojects appear to be economically robust. The results are in Table \n12.2. The IRR for the transmission and distribution components increases with increasing cost  \nof  generation  as  the  resource  cost  saving  benefit  outweighs  the  additional  generation  cost  to \nserve incremental consumption. \n \n\nTable A12.2: Sensitivity Analysis \n\nSensitivity Parameter\n\nVariation\n(%)\n\nSwitching\nValue (%)\n\nVariation\n(%)\n\nBase case\n\n1.

The \neconomy  gains  overall  from  the  project,  and  the  difference  between  the  financial  net  present \nvalue  and  economic  net  present  value  is  distributed  between  electricity  consumers  and  the \nGovernment.  From  an  economic  perspective,  benefits  accrue  to  consumers  as  energy  is \nconsumed  incrementally  based  on  consumers\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  this  consumption.  The \nbenefit of resource cost savings also accrue to consumers through lower electricity prices. The \nsum of these benefits is greater than the incremental transmission charges that would appear in \nconsumers\u2019  electricity  bills.  Therefore,  consumers  are  net  beneficiaries.  The  Government  is  a \nnet beneficiary of the difference between the financial and economic capital costs of the project. \nThe economic price of foreign exchange and the official exchange rate differ. A SERF of 1.05 \nhas been estimated for India, implying that foreign exchange costs have a higher economic than \nfinancial cost to the economy. However, taxes and duties collected on the foreign component of \nequipment  purchases  offset  the  loss  accruing  from  the  overvalued  currency.  Small  gains  and \nlosses to labor have been excluded from the analysis. \n \n16. \nFinancial benefits accrue to DISCOM-E as soon as new assets are brought into service, \nprincipally  through  increased  electricity  sales  and  reduced  losses.  However,  as  DISCOM-E\u2019s \nWACC is less than 12%, it suffers a loss when its net financial benefit streams are discounted at \n12%. The economy gains overall from the project, and the difference between the financial net \npresent value and economic net present value is distributed between electricity consumers and \nthe  Government.  From  an  economic  perspective,  benefits  accrue  to  consumers  as  energy  is \nconsumed  incrementally  based  on  consumers\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  this  consumption.  The \nbenefit of resource cost savings also accrue to consumers through lower electricity prices. The \nsum  of  these  benefits  is  greater  than  incremental  distribution  and  retail  charges  that  would \nappear  in  consumers  electricity  bills.  Therefore,  consumers  are  net  beneficiaries.  Residential \nand  agricultural  consumers  are  the  two  consumers  that  suffer  most  from  poor  quality  and \nunreliable  electricity  supply.  As  such,  they  would  benefit  the  most  from  the  project.  The \nGovernment  is  a  net  beneficiary  of  the  difference  between  the  financial  and  economic  capital \ncosts  of  the  project.  The  economic  price  of  foreign  exchange  and  the  official  exchange  rate \ndiffer. A SERF of 1.05 has been estimated for India, implying that foreign exchange costs have \na higher economic than financial cost to the economy. However, taxes and duties collected on \nthe  foreign  component  of  equipment  purchases  offset  the  loss  accruing  from  the  overvalued \ncurrency. The Government also is a net beneficiary of the incremental income tax that would be \ngenerated. Small gains and losses to labor have been excluded from the analysis. \n \nE. \n\nConclusion \n\n17. \nThe economic analysis confirms that Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 subprojects are least-cost \nand economically viable. The analysis yields EIRRs of 15.0% for the transmission components \nand 14.7% for the distribution components. Sensitivity and risk analysis demonstrates that the \nexpected  economic  performance  is  robust.  From  an  economic  perspective,  Tranche  1  and \nTranche 2 subprojects should proceed. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n73 \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nEnvironmental  assessment  of  the  proposed  investments  is  being  carried  out  following \n1. \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  Environment  Policy  (2002),  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines  (2003) 1 ,  and  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  assessment  regulations  and \nguidelines.2 The first and second tranche investments are classified as category B according to \nADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines.  The  executing  agencies  (EAs),  TRANSCO  and \nDISCOM,  have  prepared  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEE)  for  the  first  and  second \ntranche  components.  Environmental  assessment  also  will  be  prepared  in  due  course  for  the \nremaining  components  in  future  tranches.  This  summary  IEE  outlines  key  aspects  of  the \nproposed  investment  program,  environmental  benefits  and  negative  impacts,  proposed \nmitigation measures, and preliminary environmental management plan (EMP). \n \nThe  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF) 3   is  applicable  to  all \n2. \ninvestments funded by the multitranche financing facility, and particularly to projects included in \nsubsequent  tranches  that  have  not  been  fully  defined.  The  EARF  outlines  the  policy, \nprocedures,  and  institutional  requirements  for  preparing  subsequent  projects.  The  EAs  are \nresponsible  for  preparing  the  required  environmental  assessments  and  obtaining  ADB \nconcurrence  before  implementation.  These  approvals  must  be  in  place  before  contracts  are \nfinalized and work begins.  \n \n3. \nA  generic  EMP  in  matrix  form  that  will  apply  to  additional  subprojects  has  been \nprepared.4 The matrix is developed based on environmental analysis of the proposed Tranche 1 \nand Tranche 2 components and subprojects,5  as well as a review of environmental impacts of \ntypical power transmission and distribution projects. The mitigation measures for the additional \nsubprojects will be developed in the spirit of the principles agreed upon in this EMP framework. \n\nDescription of the Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Investment Program \n\n \nB. \n \nThe  proposed  Program  will  sustain  the  reform  agenda  established  with  earlier  ADB \n4. \nsupport,  and  is  expected  to  help  to  attract  other  long-term  financiers  to  the  sector.  The \ninvestments  to  be  supported  by  ADB  will  (i)  improve  the  quality  and  reliability  of  power;  (ii) \nremove  transmission  bottlenecks;  (iii)  facilitate  in-state  and  interregional  power  transfers;  (iv) \nfacilitate a reduction in overall system losses; (v) improve energy efficiency, expand renewable \nenergy  capacity,  and  capitalize  related  carbon  market  opportunities;  and  (vi)  improve  utility \noperational and financial performance. \n  \n5. \n \n\nElectricity Transmission Capacity Strengthening.  \n\n(i) \n\nTranche  1,  Transmission  Capacity  Expansion.  This  component  includes \nconstruction  of  (a)  2  circuit  kilometers  (cct-km)  of  400  kV  and  1,435  cct-km  of \n220  kV  transmission  lines  across  MP;  (b)  eight  new  220/132  kV  substations, \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003 Environmental Assessment Guidelines.  Manila \n2   Government of India regulations consider transmission and distribution systems to be non-polluting activities, and \nas such do not require environmental assessments or prior regulatory approval from Ministry of Environment and \nForests.  \n\n3   EARF is in Supplementary Appendix K \n4   EMP is provided in Supplementary Appendix L \n5   An IEE with EMP has been prepared for the proposed Tranche 1 and Tranche 2. \n\n \n\n\f74 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nwith  transformer  capacity  of  160  MVA  each;  and  (c)  one  new  400/220/132  kV \nsubstation with 315 MVA transformer capacity.  \n\nTranche 2, Distribution Efficiency Enhancement. The distribution component \nwill undertake (a) construction of HVDS in six  distribution circles in the eastern \ndistribution zone of MP, including conversion of about 7,400 km of low-voltage \nlines  to  high-voltage  lines;  (b)  remote  metering  of  about  2,000  industrial \nconsumers;  (c)  metering  of  about  250,000  consumers;  and  (d)  renovation  of \nprotection system at about 100 substations. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n \nC. \n \nPhysical Resources. The project components are in various geographic regions of the \n6. \nstate,  covering  Bagel  Khand,  Bundel  Khand,  Chambal,  Mahakaushal,  Malwa  and  Nimar \nregions. Except for the Narmada river valley, the state consists of a plateau with mean elevation \nof about 500 meters above mean sea level, interspersed with mountains of the Satpura and the \nVindhya ranges. The Narmada is an MP lifeline, which runs from east to west between Vindhya \nand Satpura ranges. The project area is part of a peninsular plateau consisting of sedimentary \nand metamorphic rocks, and is structurally part of the peninsular block. The soil of the region is \nrich  and  fertile.  MP  has  two  agro-climatic  zones:  (i)  Central  Plateau  &  Hill  Region,  and  (ii) \nWestern Plateau and Hill Region. Soil in the region is mainly black soil, ranging from shallow to \ndeep black. In addition to high reserves of coal, the state\u2019s other mineral resources include iron \nore, manganese, copper, bauxite, limestone, dolomite, rock phosphate, diamonds etc. The area \nis  geologically  stable  and  not  prone  to  earthquakes.  Agriculture  dominates  land  use,  with  the \naverage  area  reported  under  forest  cover  at  about  28%.  Four  major  rivers  crisscross  MP: \nMahanadi,  Narmada,  Sone,  and  Tapti.  Availability  of  water  in  the  state  is  more  than  81,000 \nmillion  cubic  meters  (m3),  of  which  approximately  56,857  million  m3  (70%)  had  been  utilized. \nSurface water commonly is used for all purposes. However, groundwater use is also common. \nThe  areas  directly  impacted  by  the  investment  components  do  not  have  any  sensitive, \nthreatened, or endangered species. The state has a tropical climate varying from dry subumid to \nsemiarid.  Summers  are  hot  (maximum  temperature  between  330C  and  440C)  and  at  some \nplaces  it  remains  humid,  while  winters  are  reasonably  comfortable  (between  270C  and  100C). \nThe  monsoon  season  runs  from  June  to  September,  with  average  rainfall  of  1,000  millimeter \n(mm)  in  the  west  to  2,000  mm  in  the  eastern  part  of  state.  Average  air  quality  in  the  state  is \ngood,  except  in  a  few  urban  and  industrial  centers,  where  air  quality  is  deteriorated  due  to \nindustrial activities and transport sources.  \n \n7. \nEcological Resources. The total forest area in the state is about 9.77 million hectares, \nwhich constitutes 31.7% of total land area of MP. Of the forested area, 64% is legally reserved \nforest,  22%  protected  forest,  and  14%  unclassified  forest.  MP  has  nine  national  parks  and  25 \nwildlife  sanctuaries,  covering  about  10,800  square  kilometers  (km2)  or  about  3.5%  of  the \ngeographic area of the state. However, none of the physical investment components is in these \nsensitive areas. The notable wildlife species reported are jackal, fox, monkey, wolf, squirrel, and \nreptiles. The common flora species are babul, chhola, jaria, keekar, neem, reonjha, etc. \n \nSocioeconomic  Conditions.  The  population  of  state  exceeds  60  million,6  constituting \n8. \nabout 5.9 % of country\u2019s population. Average population density is about 196 persons per km2. \nAbout 73% of the population lives in rural areas. The literacy rate is nearly 65%. The economy \n\n                                                 \n6  Statistics  are  taken  from  **Author**.  **Year  of  publication**.  Census  of  India,  2001.  **Place  of  publication: \nPublisher**\u2014the latest authentic document published by Government of India and revised by every 10 years.   \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n75 \n\nis  based  primarily  on  agriculture,  with  predominant  crops  of  millet,  wheat,  maize  (corn),  rice, \ngram, soybean, cotton, ground-nuts, pulses etc. The total cultivable area is 18,704 hectares and \nthe net area sown is about 14,975 hectares. Mineral resources and tourism also are contributing \nsignificantly to the state\u2019s economy. Per capacity income at current prices is about Rs5,926 per \nyear,  and  the  net  domestic  product  at  current  prices  is  about  Rs41,572  crores  (annual  basis). \nAbout  95%  of  villages  are  electrified,  nearly  24%  villages  have  all-weather  road  connectivity, \nand about one third of the population has access to improved water supply. \n \nD. \n \n\nAnticipated Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Problems Due to Project Location and Design \n\n \nIn all project areas, the project components do not encroach upon ecologically important \n9. \nareas.  They  generally  traverse  barren  land  with  minimum  vegetative  cover  and  agricultural \nareas. Preliminary route selection was based on the topographic sheets and forest atlas (forest \nmaps).  The  following  principles  were  adopted  for  selection  of  optimum  sites  for  project \ncomponents: (i) minimize disturbance of human settlements; (ii) avoid monuments of cultural or \nhistorical  importance;  (iii)  do  not  create  a  threat  to  the  survival  of  any  community  with  special \nreference to tribal communities; (iv) do not affect any public utility services such as playgrounds, \nschools etc.; (v) do not pass through any sanctuaries, national parks, reserve forests etc.; (vi) \nminimize  damage  to  forest  resources;  (vii)  selection  new  equipment  (i.e.,  transformers, \ncapacitors,  etc.)  that  comply  with  international  standards,  particularly  with  respect  to  avoiding \nuse  of  PCBs.  Site  selection  for  individual  lines  and  substations  is  undertaken  carefully. \nAlternative  alignments  and/or  locations  were  considered  to  ensure  that  the  disruption  to \nenvironmentally sensitive areas would be avoided or minimal. The land required for placing new \ntransmission towers is about 0.3 hectares, and for new substations is about 76.5 hectares. The \nland  required  is  mostly  government  and/or  agricultural  land,  and  will  be  compensated  per \nexisting  norms.  No  land  acquisition  will  be  required  for  augmentation  of  substation  capacity, \ninstallation  of  additional  transformers  and  circuit  breakers,  and  extension  of  feeder  bays,  etc. \nThe proposed project components do not pose any threat to other public utilities or wildlife.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Effects During Construction \n\n \n10.  Minor disruption to farming activities, as well as disturbance of crops, bunds, canals, and \ndrains,  could  occur  during  construction  and  line  maintenance.  To  minimize  such  impacts, \nestablished  roads  and  tracks  will  be  used  wherever  possible,  compensation  will  be  paid  for \ntemporary loss in agricultural production in accordance with the resettlement action plan, topsoil \nwill  be  protected  and  reinstated  after  construction  is  completed,  and  damaged  bunds  and \nirrigation  facilities  will  be  maintained  in  working  condition  throughout  project  implementation. \nTemporary  access  roads  might  be  needed  in  some  locations.  The  environmental  impacts \nassociated  with  the  establishment  of  temporary  access  roads  will  include  compaction  of  soil \nstructure  and  disruption  of  stream  or  other  water  bodies.  To  minimize  the  impact,  the \ncontractors will be required to limit the load of trucks in transporting construction equipment and \nmaterials.  Uncontrolled  soil  erosion  and  silt  runoff  are  likely  to  be  minor  due  to  the  limited \namount of excavation required for towers and the dry climate. In addition, measures to minimize \nerosion and silt runoff will be incorporated into contract documents. Substations will be sited and \ndesigned  to  ensure  noise  level  from  fence  will  not  exceed  70  dB(A)  at  any  time.  Construction \nwill  generate  noise  for  a  short  duration  in  predominantly  rural  locations,  and  is  considered \ninsignificant.  Other  nuisances  from  construction  activities  will  be  mitigated  through  contract \nclauses  specifying  careful  construct  practices  and  compensation  paid  for  any  losses  in \nagricultural production. Escape of polluting material, such as oil and sewage, from construction \n\n \n\n\f76 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n\ncamps  and  substations  will  be  prevented  through  design  and  installation  of  appropriate  oil \ncontainment  and  sewerage  systems.  Hazardous  waste  generated  from  phased  out  equipment \nand/or  batteries  will  be  disposed  off  according  to  the  norms  of  Ministry  of  Environment  and \nForests. Health hazards from potential explosions or fire, electric shocks, and accidents to staff \nand the public will be minimized through implementation of measures such as (i) careful designs \nusing  appropriate  technologies  to  minimize  hazards,  (ii)  safety  awareness  raising  for \nconstruction  and  operational  staff  and  the  public,  (iii)  substations  equipped  with  modern  fire \ncontrol systems, (iv) provision of adequate water supply and sanitation facilities for substations \nand construction camps, (v) provision of adequate staff training in operations and maintenance, \nand (vi) security fences and barriers around substations and transmission towers in populated \nareas. \n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Effects During Operation  \n\n11. \nDuring  construction,  3-meter  wide  strips  of  land  under  each  conductor  will  be  cleared, \none of which will be kept clear as a maintenance right-of-way. The other strips will be allowed to \nbe afforested. Trees will be trimmed with the assistance of the state forest department to ensure \nthat  the  required  vertical  clearances  from  the  top  of  tree  to  the  conductor  are  maintained \nthroughout the transmission corridor. This will reduce the chances of forest fires due to electric \nsparks.  Emissions  from  circuit  breakers,  which  use  sulphur  hexafluoride  (SF6),  are  a  concern, \nand have been evaluated in the context of possible opportunities under the Clean Development \nMechanism  (CDM). 7   While  MPPTCL  has  investigated  phasing  out  SF6,  no  technological \nsubstitute for SF6 circuit breakers is ready. Emissions of SF6 will be controlled by applying sound \nengineering and management practices, including leak detection and repair, use of appropriate \nequipment  for  recycling,  and  orientation  and  training  of  employees.  To  minimize  the  risk  of \naccidents  and  exposure  to  electric  fields,  houses  will  not  be  allowed  within  the  right-of-way. \nGeneral  awareness  among  people  about  potential  risks  due  to  high-voltage  lines  and  safety \naspects should be raised. Table A13.1 summarizes the anticipated impacts during construction \nand operations. Overall, the project\u2019s minimal negative impacts can be mitigated cost effectively. \n\n \nTable A13.1: Project Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nTypes of \nImpacts  \nNoise: \nConstruction \nPeriod \n\nNoise: \nOperational \nPeriod \n\nImpact Sources \n\nConstruction \nequipment and \nequipment \nrepairing and \nmaintenance \nTransmission line \nand associated \nsubstations \n\nLocation of \nSources \nConstruction \nsites, \nmaintenance \nyard, and access \nroads \nOutdoor \nSwitchyards \n\n \n\nPollutant or \nParameter \n70 dB(A) at site \nboundary \n\n70 dB(A) at site \nboundary  \n\nWastewater: \nConstruction \nPeriod \n\nDomestic \nwastewater \n\nIndustrial \nwastewater from \nconstruction \nequipment \nmaintenance \n\nWork site and \nconstruction \ncamps \nEquipment \nmaintenance \nyards \n\nBOD, COD, fecal \ncoliform \n\nPetroleum and \ndetergent \n\nTreatment Measures \n\nEquipment to meet local \nnoise standards; \nconstruction scheduling \nto avoid evening and \nnighttime disruption \nLocate facility 70\u2013100 m \nfrom nearest receptor; \nwalls, fencing, and/or \ngreenbelt to provide \npartial sound barrier \nPrimary treatment if \nneeded by larger camps \n\nSedimentation and \nbiological treatment if \nnecessary \n\n                                                 \n7 SF6 is one of the six greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol, but India is not subject to Kyoto emissions \n\ncaps and SF6 is not regulated by the Government of India as a pollutant.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n77 \n\nPollutant or \nParameter \nMineral oil, \npossible oil with \nPCBs \n\nTreatment Measures \n\nReuse after filtration. \nDispose off-site to \nregistered vendors \n\nTypes of \nImpacts  \n\nWastewater: \nOperational \nPeriod \n\nImpact Sources \n\nWaste oil from \nphased out \ntransformers and \nother equipment \nDomestic \nwastewater \nIndustrial \nwastewater and \noils from \ntransformer \nreplacement \n\nLocation of \nSources \nConstruction \nsites and \nmaintenance \nyards \nSubstations and \nstorage yard \nStorage and \nmaintenance \nyard \n \nTransformers \nbeing taken out \nof service \n\nAir Quality: \nConstruction \nPeriod \n\nAir Quality: \nOperational \nPeriod \n\nDust during \nconstruction and \nexhaust gases \nfrom construction \nmachinery and \nvehicles \nRelease of gases \nin receptors from \nprocess, \nequipment \n \n\nConstruction \nsites access \nroads and \nsurrounding \nareas \n\nEquipment or  \nprocess using \nCFCs and \nhalons \n\nBOD, COD, fecal \ncoliform  \nTemperature, pH, \nBOD, etc. to meet \nCPCB standards \nfor industrial \nwastewater \n \nMineral oil; \npossible oil with \nPCBs \nIncrease TSP, NO2, \nSO2 levels at \nconstruction sites, \nand surrounding \nareas \n\nGHGs in \natmosphere \n\nSolid \nWastes: \nConstruction \nPeriod \n \n\nSpoils from earth \nmoving; \nconstruction debris \n\nConstruction \nsites and \nworkers\u2019 camps \n\nEarth and domestic \nsolid waste \n\nReplaced \nequipment \n\nStorage yard \n\nPieces of phased \nout equipment \n\nPrimary treatment if \nneeded \nOff-site disposal at \nlicensed treatment facility, \nor alternate on-site \ntreatment as approved by \npollution control board \n\nContinuous management \nmeasures to be imposed \nat the construction sites \n\nReplace equipment or \nprocess or system using \nCFCs, including halon, \nand dispose off in manner \nconsistent with the \nrequirements of the \nGovernment \nSpoils to be used as base \nmaterial for substations \nand greenbelts \n\nDispose of in a manner \nconsistent with the \nGovernment\u2018s \nrequirements \nDisposed at facilities \napproved by local \ngovernment pollution \ncontrol agencies \n\nSubstations and \nstorage yards \n\nGarbage from \nsubstations and \nstorage yards \n\nSolid \nWastes: \nOperational \nPeriod \nBOD  =  biochemical  oxygen  demand,  COD  =  chemical  oxygen  demand,  dB(A)  =  decibel  acoustic,  NO   =  nitrogen \ndioxide,  NO   =  nitrogen  oxides,  PCB  =  polychlorinated  biphenyl,  SO   =  sulfur  dioxide,  TSP  =  total  suspended \nparticles, CFC = chlorofluorocarbons, GHG = greenhouse gases. \nSource: Asian Development Bank assessment \n \n\nDomestic solid \nwaste and/or \nprocess waste or \nscrap waste \n\n2\n\n2\n\nx\n\n4. \n\nPotential Cumulative and Induced Impacts \n\n12. \nThe proposed investment program does have potential cumulative and induced impacts, \nwhich are considered largely positive. Direct impacts result from acquisition of additional RoWs \nand land for transmission lines and substations, and improvements in power system efficiency. \nDistribution and transmission system efficiency improvements will result in energy savings of at \nleast 1,200 giga watt per hour (GWh) per year, with equivalent Carbon Dioxide (CO2) reduction \nof  more  than  1  million  tons  per  year.  Indirect  impacts  include:  (i)  expansion  of  thermal  power \ngeneration  base  (facilitated  by  the  transmission  and  distribution  system  investments);  (ii) \nincreased investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy; (iii) economic growth related \nto  improved  power  supplies;  and  (iv)  reallocation  of  government  funding  away  from  loss-\nincurring utility operations and toward social investment in education, health, water supply, and \nsanitation.  The  application  of  advanced  power  generation  technologies  and  renovation  of \n\n \n\n\f78 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n\nexisting  power  stations  will  offset  partially  thermal  power  expansion.  If  the  full  spectrum  of \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy investments materialize, the potential savings are more \nthan 2,000 GWh per year and more than 2 million tons per year of CO2 equivalent. \n \n\n5. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n\n \n13.  While the EAs have engineering and support staff, they have varying levels of dedicated \nstaff  and/or  full-time  qualified  personnel  with  environment  and  resettlement  expertise.  An \nenvironmental and social management unit, responsible for environment, resettlement, and any \nother social development obligations, will be established at each EA.8 All the EAs will assume \nprimary  responsibility  for  the  environmental  assessment  and  implementation  of  EMPs  for  their \nrespective components. TRANSCO has an environmental and social management cell (ESMC) \nwithin  its  organization  structure  to  deal  with  environmental  and  social  issues.  However,  its \ncapacity  needs  to  be  strengthened  by  providing  orientation  and  training  on  monitoring  and \nimplementation of environmental good practices. A chief engineer (T&P) heads the ESMC cell, \nwhich has seven officers from T&P office, civil office, and EHT-wing. ESMC at TRANSCO will \nhave overall responsibility for implementation and monitoring of EMPs. The field organizations \nof EHT: C&M cell are carrying out the field studies. The field organizations of MPPTCL and DFO \nof the concerned district are conducting the EIA studies jointly. The ESMC is self-sufficient for \nmonitoring  the  program  and  submission  of  progress  reports.  However,  as  and  if  required \nservices  of  external  agencies  could  be  taken  for  monitoring  and  implementation  of  mitigation \nmeasures. Need for additional staff is not envisaged. \n \n14. \nThe  duties  of  the  environmental  and  social  management  unit  will  include  at  least:  (i) \nmonitoring and implementing mitigation measures; (ii) preparing and implementing environment \npolicy  guidelines  and  environmental  good  practices;  (iii)  advising  and  coordinating  effective \nenvironment  management;  (iv)  preparing  an  environment  and  safety  manual  for  substation \noperation; (v) liaising with the Ministry of Environment Forest, New Delhi, and Pollution Control \nBoard, and seeking their help to solve the environment-related issues of project implementation; \n(vi) advising the project planning cell on environmental and social issues, while selecting routes \nfor the alignment at the planning stage to avoid negative environmental impacts; (vii) providing \ntraining  and  awareness  on  environmental  and  social  issues  related  to  power  transmission \nprojects to the project staff.  \n \n15. \nThe contractor will be responsible for implementation of mitigation measures during the \nconstruction  stage.  The  environmental  engineer  of  the  environmental  and  social  management \nunit will ensure inclusion of environmental mitigation measures in contract documents. ADB will \n(i)  review  and  approve  IEEs  and  EMPs  before  contracts  are  finalized  and  work  begins;  (ii) \nreview monitoring reports; and (iii) officially disclose the IEEs on its Web site in accordance with \nthe ADB Public Communications Policy (2005)9. The IEEs include EMPs that cover (i) summary \nof  potential  impacts,  (ii)  mitigation  measures,  (iii)  environmental  monitoring,  (iv)  public \nconsultation  processes,  (v)  outline  of  responsibilities  and  authorities  for  implementing  the \nproposed  monitoring  and  mitigation  activities,  (vi)  reporting  and  review  procedures,  (vii)  work \nplan  (including  staffing  and  schedules  of  assigned  personnel,  activities,  and  inputs  of  other \ngovernment  agencies  and  stakeholders),  (viii)  environmentally  responsible  procurement  plan, \n(ix)  cost  estimates,  and  (x)  mechanisms  for  feedback  and  adjustment.

Further, it will provide them with a public forum to raise their \nconcern  or  objections.  The  GRC  will  comprise  representatives  from  project  proponent,  local \nauthorities,  affected  parties,  and  other  stakeholders,  as  mutually  agreed  with  the  local \nauthorities  and  affected  persons,  and  a  senior  official  from  each  EA.

Minimal  negative \nenvironmental  impacts  are  anticipated,  mostly  during  construction.  These  can  be  mitigated \nsuccessfully  by  implementing  component-specific  EMPs.  Environmental  and  social  benefits  of \nthe  investment  components  and  long-term  program  objectives  outweigh  the  negative  impacts. \nBased on environmental assessment activities conducted to date, the Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 \nprojects  are  confirmed  as  environmental  category  B  and  the  IEEs,  including  EMPs,  are \nconsidered sufficient to meet the environmental assessment requirements of ADB and India. A \nfull environmental impact assessment study is not required. \n                                                 \n11  Queries raised by people were answered to their satisfaction. It was assured that compensation for any loss would \n\nbe paid in a timely manner on mutually agreed terms, or after the revenue department fixed the amount. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n81 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY (SPRSS)  \n \n\n \nYes \n\n \nSector identified as a National Priority in \nCountry Poverty Partnership Agreement  \n\nLinks to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \nYes \n\nA. \n \nSector identified as a National Priority in \nCountry Poverty Analysis?   \n \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to poverty reduction in India \n \nInfrastructure  development  is  critical  as  a  catalyst  for  generating  economic  activity  and  employment, \naccelerating  growth,  and  providing  better  integration  and  social  welfare.  The  power  sector  investment \nprogram  in  Madhya  Pradesh  will  have  intrinsic  scope  for  poverty  reduction.  The  investment  program  will \nbring direct and indirect positive social impacts. This will benefit specifically the people living in the remote \nareas through improved frequency and voltage levels for various uses, which will result in socioeconomic \ngrowth. Electricity is a key input for socioeconomic development process. Efficient and reliable provision of \nelectricity contributes indirectly to poverty reduction through economic growth. It also has a direct bearing \non poverty reduction as electricity access is central to the basic human needs of health and education. Poor \nand  vulnerable  consumers,  as  well  as  social  utilities such  as  hospitals  and  schools,  are  often  particularly \ndisadvantaged  by  inadequate  power  supply,  load  shedding,  and  poor  power  quality.  Therefore,  they  will \nbenefit directly from the project. Direct positive economic and social benefits will result from the investment \nprogram. In addition, better supply of electricity will enable farmers to set up high-powered pump sets for \ntheir  agricultural  use,  which  will  help  increase  yields.  The  proposed  project  is  expected  to  generate \nconsiderable employment for skilled and unskilled labor during the construction. \n\n \nB.         Poverty Analysis                                                  Proposed Classification: General intervention \n   \nThe poverty level in Madhya Pradesh is, on average, higher than in the rest of India. This is indicative of \nthe degree of vulnerability and marginalization of the population. According to the National Sample Survey \n55th  round,  37.43%  of  the  population  in  the  state  lives  in  poverty.  The  poverty  line  in  the  state  is  set  at \nRs311.34  per  capita  per  month  for  rural  areas  and Rs481.65  per  capita  per  month  for  urban  areas.  The \nnational poverty line is slightly higher for rural areas at Rs327.66 per month, but lower for urban areas at \nRs454.11 per month. However, the national and the state poverty lines are well below the internationally \naccepted  $1  a  day  poverty  line,  highlighting  the  vulnerability  of  population.  According  to  the  Human \nDevelopment Report, the poverty level in the rural areas has fallen from 40.6% in 1993\u20131994 to 37.1% in \n1999\u20132000,  as  per  the  head  count  ratio  in  Madhya  Pradesh.  The  literacy  rate  is  64.11%  of  the  total \npopulation. Of the literate population, 76.80% is male and 50.28% is female. Of the total households, 74% \nare in rural areas and 26% in urban areas. Net sown area under agriculture is 49%, and forest land covers \nabout 28% of the geographic area. Of the total population, 57% is classified as nonworkers and 32% are \nmain workers, whereas 11% is marginal workers.  \n \nThe  sample  subprojects  will  create  significant  employment  opportunities  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor \nduring implementation. Unskilled labor will be employed directly for the construction of transmission lines, \nsubstations,  and  other  manual  works.  The  post-construction  phase  also  will  offer  opportunities  for \nemployment, especially for maintenance \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \nC. \n \n \nIs there a stake holder analysis?           \nParticipation during project preparation: The executing agencies consulted with local officials and village \nleaders,  raising  the  level  of  awareness,  building  local  support,  and  enabling  affected  people  to  voice \nopinions and suggestions for project design and implementation. The poor, women, and other vulnerable \ngroups were considered carefully in conducting participatory activities. As a part of the social assessment, \nstakeholders\u2019  consultations  in  the  project  areas  were  carried  out  with  the  broad  objective  of  ensuring \nextensive  participation  of  all  types  of  stakeholders.  The  participatory  approach  will  be  continued  during \n\n   Yes                         No \n\nX \n   \n\n \n\n\f82 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \n\nX \n\nimplementation.  \n \nIs there participatory Strategy?                      Yes                        No \nParticipation  and  consultation  are  based  on  a  two-way  information  flow\u2014from  project  authorities  to \npeople  and  from  people  to  project  authorities.  Participation,  consultation,  and  information  dissemination \nwere incorporated at several levels during the planning of subprojects. Public consultations were carried \nout  as  an  integral  component  of  project  preparation  to  ensure  that  the  community  supports  the  project \nand  the  project  supports  the  needs  of  the  people.  The  stakeholders  and  the  affected  community  were \ncontinuously involved, and their feedback has led to substantial inputs into project preparation. While the \nproject authority retains the decision-making authority, interaction with people and their feedback allows \naffected populations to influence the decision-making process by raising issues that should be considered \nin  design,  mitigation,  monitoring,  and  management  plans,  as  well  as  the  analysis  of  alternatives.  The \nexecuting  agencies  (EA)will  ensure  that  during  implementation  local  groups  will  remain  involved  in  (i) \npreparing  final  compensation  listings  and  individual  claim  files  and  in  the  payment  of  compensation  for \nacquired  land  and  loss  of  assets  and  livelihood;  and  participate  in  any  grievance  redress;  and  (iv)  the \nM&E process during implementation of the resettlement plan. \n \n \nD. \n \nStrategy to Maximize Impacts on Women:  \nWomen  will  benefit  from  the  project  through  improved  access  to  electricity,  which  will  result  in  better \nservices  such  as  health,  education,  and  clean  environment.  Women  have  been  consulted  during  the \nproject  preparation,  and  the  necessary  mitigations  have  been  suggested  to  avoid  any  discrimination \nagainst women during the project implementation. \n \nHas an out put been prepared?

Attempts \nhave  been  made  to  ensure  that  most  of  the \nconstruction  is  done  on  the  government  land. \nHowever,  some \nrequired, \nalthough  impacts  on  individual  households  are \nlimited.  According  to  the  assessment  for  Tranch1 \nand  Tranche  2,  611.30  hectares  of  private \nagricultural land will be acquired temporarily due to \nthe  construction  of  transmission  lines,  which  will \nresult  in  1,528  temporarily  affected  households. \nSimilarly,  162  hectares  of  government  land  will  be \nacquired  for  construction  of  18  substations,  which \nwill  have  no  resettlement  impact.  Additionally,  the \nremaining  substations,  whose  sites  have  not  been \nfinalized,  have  been  assessed.  For  the  remaining \nsubstations,  a  maximum  of  three  households  are \nassumed to lose part of their land in the worst case \nscenario.  Therefore, \nland \nrequirement  and  subsequent  number  of  affected \nhouseholds  has  been  done  on  the  basis  of  these \nassumptions,  and  the  acquisition  is  considered \nlosses  will  be \npermanent  and  private.

Per the detailed project report (DPR), 18 of the \n19 proposed substations will be built in the government land. The remaining substation \n(Chicholi) will require minimal private land acquisition. The assessment has been done \nfor the transmission lines for Tranche 1. Land acquisition and resettlement impacts have \nbeen  assessed  and  documented  in  the  RP  for  the  transmission  lines  and  substations \nunder  Tranche  1.  The  construction  of  transmission  lines  will  require  the  temporary \nacquisition  of  611.3049  hectares  of  private  agricultural  land,  which  will  result  in  1,52850 \ntemporarily  affected  households.  Similarly,  162.46  hectares  of  government  land  will  be \n\n                                                 \n49 Temporary acquisition for transmission routes have been calculated based on the amount of land required \nfor  footings,  towers,  and  rights-of-way.  In  Madhya  Pradesh,  about  49%  of  the  land  is  used  for  private \ncultivation. Therefore, assessment of private land is done by applying 49% to the total land to be affected \nby the transmission components. \n\n50 The average land holding size in Madhya Pradesh is 0.4 hectare, and the temporarily affected household \n\nis calculated applying 0.4 hectare average to the total affected agricultural land. \n\n \n\n\f86 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n \n\nacquired  for  construction  of  18  substations  (sites  have  been  selected),  which  will  have \nno  resettlement  impact.  Only  3  hectares  of  private  land  will  be  acquired  for  one \nsubstation (Chicholi), which will affect three households and 15 persons. Details are in \nTable A15.2.

MP  is  the  second  largest  state  in  India  with  an  area  of  308,000  square \nkilometers  (km2).  The  state  of  MP  comprises  of  45  districts  and  51,806  villages.  The \npopulation density of MP is 196 per km2. According to the national census of 2001, the \npopulation  of  MP  was  60,385,118  persons,  of  which  52%  is  male  and  48%  is  female. \nThe sex ratio (i.e., the number of females per thousand males) is 933:1000. The literacy \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n87 \n\nIndigenous People \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlements \n\nfor  Project  Affected  Persons  (NPRR)  by \n\nrate  is  64.11%  of  the  total  population.  Of  the  literate  population,  76.80%  is  male  and \n50.28%  is  female.  Of  total  households,  74%  are  in  rural  areas  and  26%  are  in  urban \nareas. Net sown area under agriculture is 49%, and forest land covers about 28% of the \ngeographic  area.  Of  the  total  population,  57%  are  classified  as  nonworkers,  32%  as \nmain  workers,  and  11%  as  workers.  According  to  the  National  Sample  Survey  55th \nround, 37.43% of the state\u2019s population lives in poverty. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe  project  will  not  affect  any  indigenous  people.  MP\u2019s  scheduled  tribe \npopulation  is  12,233,474,  or  20.3  %  of  the  state  population.  An  Indigenous  People\u2019s \nDevelopment  Framework  (IPDF)  has  been  prepared  for  management  of  Indigenous \nPeople (IP) issues if occurs in the future. \n \nD. \n \nThis RP is based on the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) policy on Involuntary \n6. \nResettlement  (1995),  as  well  as  on  the  Government\u2019s  domestic  laws,  particularly  Land \nAcquisition  Act  of  1894  (Govt  of  India);  National  Policy  on  Resettlement  and \nRehabilitation \nthe  Ministry  of  Rural \nDevelopment, 2003; and The Madhya Pradesh Resettlement Policy, 2002.  \n \n7. \nNational  Policy  on  Resettlement  and  Rehabilitation.  The  basis  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  resettlement  policy  is  the  NPRR,  which  provides  minimum  conditions \nensured for persons affected by acquisition of land for public purposes. The objectives of \nthe policy are to (i) minimize displacement and identify non-displacing or least-displacing \nalternatives;  (ii)  plan  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  of  project-affected  families  (PAF), \nconsidering special needs of tribal and vulnerable sections; (iii) provide a better standard \nof  living  for  PAFs;  and  (iv)  facilitate  cooperation  between  the  project  proponent  and \nPAFs.  The  Land  Acquisition  Act,  1894  provides  the  framework  for  facilitating  land \nacquisition  in  India.  It  enables  the  Government  to  acquire  private  lands  for  public \npurposes,  and  seeks  to  ensure  that  no  person  is  deprived  of  land  except  as  provided \nunder this act.   \n \n8. \nResettlement  and  Rehabilitation  Policy  of  Madhya  Pradesh,  2002.  The \nMadhya  Pradesh  Resettlement  Policy  of  2002  recognizes  all  affected  persons \nirrespective  of  titles.  The  policy  provides  for  project-assisted  resettlement  for  (i) \nresettlement  and  relocation,  (ii)  income  restoration,  (iii)  special  attention  to  vulnerable \ngroups,  (iv)  time-bound  and  fair  compensation,  and  (v)  rebuilding  and/or  restoration  of \ncommunity resources or facilities. \n \n9. \n\nADB\u2019s policy on Involuntary Resettlement policy requires:  \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nin  project  planning  and \nincluding  disclosure  of  RP  and  project-related \n\navoiding or minimizing adverse project impacts where possible;  \nconsulting  with  affected  persons \nimplementation, \ninformation;  \npaying compensation for acquired assets at replacement value; \nentitling  APs  to  receive  assistance  to  restore  income  and  livelihood  at \npre-project standard, and entitling all vulnerable APs to receive additional \nassistance to improve their income and livelihood;  \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(AP) \n\n \n\n\f88 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n \n\n \n10. \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\nproviding  resettlement  assistance  to  APs,  including  non-titled  persons \n(informal dwellers or squatters and encroachers);  \nintegrating  APs  economically  and  socially  into  their  host  communities,  if \nrelocated.  \nSafeguarding  and  supporting  APs\u2019  social  and  cultural  institutions;  and \nrestoring common properties and facilities;  \ncarrying  out  compensation  and  rehabilitation  programs  with  equal \nconsideration for women and men; and  \nproviding income restoration and rehabilitation programs. \n\nThe basic principles adopted for the project are: \n(i) \n\nAvoid  negative  impacts  of  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement \non persons affected by the project to the extent possible. \n\nto \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nrelated \n\ninformation \n\nresettlement  planning  and \n\n(ii)  Where  negative  impacts  cannot  be  avoided,  assist  APs,  particularly \nvulnerable  groups,  in  improving  or  at  least  regaining  their  standard  of \nliving and income.  \nDisclose  all \nimplementation, and ensure APs\u2019 participation in them. \nProvide compensation for acquired assets at replacement and/or market \nvalue in accordance with the RP and resettlement framework.  \nProvide resettlement assistance and income restoration to APs, including \nnon-titled persons. \nProvide  for  APs  not  present  during  enumeration.

The \nresettlement  and  RP  implementation  for  Tranche  1,  especially  for  the  TRANSCO \ncomponents, will cost Rs77 million ($6.1 million). This is a tentative budget that will be \nupdated as the project is developed and finalized.  \n\n \n\n\f92 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n \n \n \nH. \n \n16. \nAccording  to  the  conditions  in  the  technical  construction  works  contracts,  land \nfree from all encumbrances is to be made available to the contractors in phases for each \ncontract package. The time frame for implementation of the RP will be synchronized with \nproject  implementation  to  avoid  undermining  commencement  and  progress  of  civil \nworks. The RP is expected to be implemented continuously, and will be completed in a \nphased  manner  for  over  the  project  duration  for  each  specific  contract  and  tranches. \nHowever,  the  sequence  might  change  or  delays  might  occur  due  to  circumstances \nbeyond  the  control  of  the  project.

Two  broad  categories  of  indicators  will  be  monitored  during  the  project:  (i) \ninput and output indicators, and (ii) outcome and impact indicators. The PMU, with the \nhelp  of  the  implementing  NGO,  will  carry  out  internal  monitoring  according  to  impact \nindicators related to the overall project objectives as stated in the R&R policy and in the \nentitlement  matrix.  An  external  monitoring  consultant  will  be  engaged  to  monitor  and \nevaluate  proactively  the  RP  objectives.  The  external  monitoring  consultant  will  submit \nmonthly  and  quarterly  monitoring  reports.  A  final  evaluation  will  determine  if  the  R&R \nobjectives have been achieved according to the performance impact indicators.  \n\n \nI. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 28 February 2007)\n", "Currency Unit \n", "Indian rupees/s (Re/Rs) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "Rs1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "$0.0226 \nRs44.22 \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ADB \nCDM \nCEA \nCMD \nCO2\nCSP \nDFID \nDISCOM \nDISCOM-C \nDISCOM-E \nDISCOM-W \nEA \nEARF \nECF \nEIRR \nEMP \nEPA \nCERC \nFFA \nFIRR \nFMA \nFRP \nFY \nGDP \nGENCO \nGOMP \nGRC \nHVDS \nICB \nIEE \nIPDF \nIPP \nLIBOR \nMFF \nMOP \nMP \nMPPSDP \n", "distribution company \n", "clean development mechanism \n", "chairman and managing director \ncarbon dioxide \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Central Electricity Authority \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Country Strategy Programme \n\u2013  Department for International Development of the United Kingdom \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Madhya Pradesh Madhya Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Limited \n\u2013  Madhya Pradesh Poorv Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Limited \n\u2013  Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Limited \nexecuting agency \n\u2013 \nenvironmental assessment and review framework \n\u2013 \nEnergy Conservation Fund \n \neconomic internal rate of return \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nenvironmental management plan \n\u2013  Environmental Protection Agency \n\u2013  Central Electricity Regulatory Commission \n\u2013  Framework Financing Agreement \n\u2013 \nfinancial internal rate of return \n\u2013  Financial Management Assessment \n\u2013  Financial Restructuring Plan \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Madhya Pradesh Power Generating Company Limited \n\u2013  Government of Madhya Pradesh \ngrievance redress committee \n\u2013 \nhigh-voltage distribution system \n\u2013 \nInternational Competitive Bidding \n\u2013 \ninitial environmental examination \n\u2013 \nindigenous peoples development framework \n\u2013 \nindependent power producer \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nLondon interbank offered rate \n\u2013  multitranche financing facility \n\u2013  Minister of Power \n\u2013  Madhya Pradesh \n\u2013  Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Development Program \n", "fiscal year \ngross domestic product \n", "MPSEB \nMPERC \n", "\u2013  Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board \n\u2013  Madhya Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "MIS \nMYT \nNEP \nO&M \nOCR \nPFR \nPMU \nPPA \nPPP \nRF \nRP \nSCADA \nTRADECO \nTRANSCO \nWACC \n", "\u2013  Management Information Systems \n\u2013  Multi Year Tariff \n\u2013  National Electricity Policy \noperation and maintenance \n\u2013 \nordinary capital resources \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nperiodic financing request \n\u2013  Project Management Unit \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Private Public Partnership \n\u2013  Resettlement Framework \n\u2013  Resettlement Plan \n\u2013  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition \n\u2013  Madhya Pradesh Power Trading Company Limited \n\u2013  Madhya Pradesh Power Transmission Company Limited \n\u2013  Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n", "power purchase agreement \n", "GWh \nha (hectare) \nkm (kilometer) \nkV  \nkW  \nkWh  \nMVA  \nMW  \nMWh  \nVA  \n", " \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "gigawatt-hour (1,000 megawatt-hours) \nUnit of area \n1,000 meters \nkilovolt (1,000 volts) \nkilowatt (1,000 watts) \nkilowatt-hour  \nmegavolt-ampere(1,000,000 volt-amperes) \nmegawatt (1,000 kilowatts) \nmegawatt-hour  \nVolt-ampere  \n", " \n", "NOTES \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of India and its agencies runs from 1 April to 31 March of the \nfollowing  year.
