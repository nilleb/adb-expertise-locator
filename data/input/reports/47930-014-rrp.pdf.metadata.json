MSMEs \nmake  up  98%  of  all  enterprises  in  Mongolia,  three-quarters  of  which  are  microenterprises.2 \nAccess  to  finance  is  the  foremost  constraint  for  Mongolian  MSMEs\u2014the  World  Bank\u2019s \nEnterprise Surveys show that more than 30% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in \nMongolia  perceive  access  to  finance  as  the  largest  issue  for  their  operations. 3 It  is  estimated \nthat  only  about  10%  of  around  37,000  Mongolian  SMEs  regularly  access  finance  through \nbanks.4 Another World Bank study notes that when finance is available to SMEs, loan terms and \nconditions are characterized by high interest rates, shorter maturities, and smaller amounts that \ndo  not  meet  the  full  financial  needs  of  these  companies  and  primarily  require  immovable \ncollateral  (footnote  2).  There  is  therefore  very  significant  unmet  financing  demand  from  all \nMSME segments in Mongolia, and commercial banks are seeking to raise additional sources of \nfunding to respond to this.  \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  met  several  financial  institutions  to  find  suitable \n3. \ncandidates  with  the  interest  and  ability  to  serve  the  MSME  segment,  and  to  examine  ways  to \nsupport  the  financing  needs  of  those  MSMEs  and  SMEs  that  cannot  meet  the  traditional \ncollateral  requirements  of  banks.  Additionally,  ADB  is  developing  a  sovereign  program  to \nimprove substandard  living  conditions  through  the  provision  of  priority  services  to  ger  areas  in \nMongolia's  capital,  Ulaanbaatar  (the  Ger  Area  Development  Program). 5  Currently,  60%  (or \nabout 800,000) of the capital\u2019s population lives in the  ger areas. ADB considered how the two \nprojects  could  complement  each  other.  Specifically,  funding  was  needed  for  small  businesses \noperating  in  the  ger  areas  under  the  sovereign  project.  Hence,  ADB  sought  a  private  sector \nbank  that  had  experience  in  lending  to  lower-income  businesses  in  ger  areas.  (To  further \nsupport  MSME  access  to  finance,  ADB  is  in  the  early  stages  of  processing  a  loan  to  another \nsystemically important commercial bank in Mongolia, which would complement this initiative).  \n \n4. \nADB held discussions with TenGer Financial Group (TFG), a financial holding group with \nsix  subsidiaries  engaged  in  banking,  leasing,  general  insurance,  microcredit  in  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, financial security, and financial advisory services. TFG has a core strategy of \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  World Bank. 2012.

Other constraints noted were the tax rate, \ninadequately  educated  workforce,  informal-sector  practices,  political  instability,  and  licensing  and  permitting \nproblems.

Manila.   \n\n5  The $320 million Ulaanbaatar Urban Services and Ger Areas Development Investment Program (Project Number:  \n45007) targets specific ger areas (named after ger tents) where services such as water supply and sewerage will \nbe provided to economic hubs (subcenters) to rationalize costs. Many businesses are also operated from gers. \n\n \n\n\f2          \n \n\n\u201cPeople,  Planet,  and  Profit.\u201d  Largest  among  the  group\u2019s  holdings  is  XacBank,  which  accounts \nfor 97% of its assets. XacBank, a participant in ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program, is a systemically \nimportant  bank  in  Mongolia  with  its  origins  in  microfinance.  XacBank  has  the  highest \ninternational credit rating among Mongolian banks, setting high governance standards since its \ninception. It has excellent asset quality and a strong focus on being responsive to the needs of \nits  customers  and,  more  broadly,  the  people  of  Mongolia,  with  the  goal  of  promoting  more \nequitable,  inclusive  growth  across  the  country. 6 XacBank  expanded  into  the  SME  segment, \nwhere there  is  significant  unmet  demand for financing,  and  now  provides  other  standard  bank \nproducts.  XacBank  is  active  in  ger  areas  and  has  branches  specifically  in  the  ger  areas \n(Bayankhoshuu and Selbe) targeted under the Ger Area Development Program.7   \n \n5. \nXacLeasing,  TFG\u2019s  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  has  been  active  in  Mongolia  since  2007 \nand  has  a  market  share  of  about  14%.  XacLeasing  provides  leases  to  companies  and \nindividuals,  primarily  equipment  leasing  for  small  businesses  and  leasing  to  individuals  for \npassenger  vehicles.  By  lending  to  TFG  in  addition  to  XacBank,  ADB  will  also  have  the \nopportunity  to  support  the  country\u2019s  emerging  leasing  industry,  which  is  important  since  some \nbusinesses  struggle  to  provide  the  collateral  typically  required  by  banks.  Given  XacBank\u2019s \nstrong developmental mandate as compared with the other commercial banks and its ability to \ntouch  the  underserved  poor  in  Mongolia,  coupled  with  the  opportunity  to  support  the  leasing \nindustry through TFG, ADB selected XacBank and TFG as candidates for the proposed loans.   \n\n \nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\nB. \n \n6. \nTFG was established in 1998 as a holding company for XacBank, which grew to become \none  of  the  most  prominent  microfinance  institutions  globally.  TFG  is  now  a  major  Mongolian \nfinancial  group  with  a  portfolio  of  growing  companies  engaged  in  financial  services.  XacBank \naccounts for the  majority  of group assets,  while  XacLeasing  accounts for  2%  of group  assets. \nTFG\u2019s insurance subsidiary has limited operations to date. The remaining companies within the \ngroup are service-based firms that generate advisory fees.  \n \n7. \nXacBank  is  Mongolia\u2019s  fourth-largest  commercial  bank.  It  operates  in  all  21  provinces \nand in Ulaanbaatar, serving more than 525,000 customers through its 103 retail and four SME \nbusiness  branches,  as  well  as  specialized  banking  outlets  that  include  888  mobile  banking \nmerchants and 49 savings and credit cooperatives. XacBank strives to be the market leader in \nMongolia  for  corporate  governance,  transparency,  and  risk  management.  It  has  developed  a \nreputation for its corporate social responsibility initiatives and received a rating of 4 out of 5 from \nthe development finance rating agency, Planet Finance, for its long-standing social performance. \nThe bank\u2019s goal is to be a client-focused company that is accessible and innovative, and able to \nleverage the economic growth prospects of Mongolia. \n \n8. \nXacLeasing was established in 2007 to offer equipment leasing to SMEs and individual \nclients.  In  February  2013,  the  company  provided  leasing  services to  331  customers.  The  total \nlease  portfolio  at  fiscal  year-end  2012  was  MNT20.9  billion.  Construction,  road  maintenance, \nand  transportation  represent  the  largest  sector  exposure  (41%),  followed  by  manufacturing \n(11%), trade (8%), services (7%), and mining (4%). In terms of underlying assets, about 80% of \ntotal leases are passenger and commercial vehicles. The balance is made up of equipment in \n                                                \n6  XacBank and TFG have also been at the forefront of financial education efforts. In 2012, XacBank delivered social \n\nand financial education programs to 30,000 children and youths throughout Mongolia. \n\n7   An  SME  Development  Committee  has  been  established  in  each  subcenter.  Provision  of  business  incubator \nbuildings combining vocational training and renting space for SMEs is included in  the first tranche of the Ger Area \nDevelopment Program. This will form a relevant and efficient vehicle for XacBank\u2019s MSME lending program, and \ncomplement the MSME development component of the ADB sovereign program. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n       \n\n3 \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\nvarious  sectors,  such  as  agriculture,  health,  and  education.8 The  company  initially  adopted  a \nconservative  approach,  which  led  to  slow  portfolio  growth  in  early  years  as  management \nfocused on building relationships with vendors.  \n \n \nDespite  the  slower  growth  initially,  XacLeasing  has  been  profitable  every  year  since \n9. \n2008,  generating  an  average  return  on  equity  of  more  than  10%  by  2012.  The  company  has \ndeveloped  strategic  partnerships  with  key  equipment  vendors \nin  Mongolia  covering \nmanufacturing,  transportation,  mining,  health  care,  and  agricultural  industries.  Bolstered  by \nincreasing demand, more significant growth is expected: the total portfolio is estimated to reach \nMNT500  billion  by  2017.  Cross-selling  is  also  an  important  part  of  TFG\u2019s  strategy,  and \nXacLeasing stands to benefit from leveraging XacBank\u2019s brand recognition and branch network. \nThe  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)  has  provided  technical  assistance  to  XacLeasing \nfor capacity  building  in areas  such  as risk management  and corporate governance,  and ORIX \nCorporation,  which  became  a  TFG  shareholder  in  2013,  will  provide  strategic  support  for \nXacLeasing as it seeks to scale up its leasing activities.9 \n \nC. \n \n10. \nOwnership. TFG\u2019s major shareholders are Mongolyn Alt Corporation (MAK) (20%), IFC \n(19%), ORIX Corporation (16%), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) \n(12%),  Ronoc  (10%),  EIT  Capital  Management  (10%),  Mercy  Corps  (8%),  and  Triodos  Fund \n(4%).  The  remaining  small  shareholders  are  Mongolian  individuals  and  the  Mongolian  UB \nRotary  Club,  Open  Society  Forum,  Equity  Investment  Trust.  XacBank  and  XacLeasing  are \nwholly owned subsidiaries of TFG. \n \ntop \n11.  Management.  TFG  and  XacBank  have  an  experienced  and  well-qualified \nmanagement;  the  chief  executive  officer  (CEO)  of  XacBank,  Bat-Ochir  Dugersuren,  has  been \nassociated with the group since 1998 and held many senior positions, including chief financial \nofficer of TFG and deputy CEO of XacBank. The bank has appointed a new chief risk officer in \nSeptember 2013 who gained extensive experience in SME and corporate lending at ABN Amro \nBank. The CEO of XacLeasing is Tsevegjav Gumenjav, supported by the chief operating officer, \nDaurenbek Serikjan. The XacLeasing management team has more than 20 years  of combined \nexperience in the finance sector. \n \n12. \nBold  Magvan  serves  as  the  CEO  of  TFG,  and  has  been  an  executive  director  on  its \nboard since January 2011. Before joining TFG, Magvan was XacBank's CEO for 2 years and its \npresident for over 3 years. Magvan is a senior banking professional with more than 20 years of \nexperience  in  global  financial  institutions,  including  the  World  Bank  and  the  International \nMonetary Fund. His career experience also includes 4 years at the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) in \nthe top management position of deputy governor from 1996 to 2000. \n \nGovernance structure. TFG recognizes the importance of sound corporate governance \n13. \nin supporting its sustainable growth and securing trust among its various stakeholders, including \ncustomers,  staff,  and  shareholders.  Besides  adhering \nthe  Principles  of  Corporate \nGovernance  of  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development,  TFG  bases  its \noperations  on  the  principles  and  best  practices  set  out  in  the  Corporate  Governance  Code, \nwhich the Mongolian Financial Regulatory Commission adopted in 2007.  \n\nto \n\n                                                \n8  XacLeasing. 2013. Business Plan 2013\u20132017. Ulaanbaatar. \n9   ORIX  Corporation  is a  Japanese  financial  services group established  in  1964.  The  group  offers leasing, lending, \nrentals,  life  insurance,  real  estate  financing  and  development,  venture  capital,  investment  and  retail  banking, \ncommodities funds and securities brokering. ORIX has also expanded globally, offering financial services in North \nAmerica, Asia, the Middle East, and Northern Africa. \n\n\f4          \n \n\nThe  board  of  directors  of TFG  consists  of  eight members  and  includes  representatives \n14. \nfrom EBRD, IFC, ORIX Corporation, and Triodos Fund. The chairperson of the board is Chuluun \nGanbold,  a  Mongolian  national  with  more  than  30  years  of  experience  in  business  and \nadministration.  He  is  a  founding  member  of  X.A.C.  (Golden  Fund  for  Development),  the  first \nnonbank  financial  institution  in  Mongolia  and  a  predecessor  of  XacBank.  The  board  is \nresponsible for determining the strategy of TFG and for supervising the conduct of its business, \nincluding responsibility for corporate governance.  \n \nThe compliance department manages reporting of any suspicious transactions. The TFG \n15. \ncompanies  have  established  \u201cknow  your  customer\u201d  principles,  and  have  adopted  policies  on \nanti-money  laundering  and  combating  the  financing  of  terrorism.  Suspicious  transactions  are \nidentified  by  scanning  information  based  on  key  items  such  as  transaction  amount,  politically \nexposed persons, and watch lists, and findings are reported to the Financial Information Unit of \nthe BOM.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n16. \nThe proposed unsecured senior loans to XacBank for up to $30 million and to TFG (for \nonlending to XacLeasing) for up to $10 million will support Mongolian MSMEs through subloans \nmade  by  XacBank  and  through  leases  provided  by  XacLeasing.  The  loan  to  XacBank \nrepresents  about  25%  of  the  bank\u2019s  annual  funding  needs  based  on  historical  growth  rates.10 \nHowever,  additional growth is  expected  in  2014 given  the  significant  levels  of  unmet financing \ndemand from MSMEs. The proposed ADB loan amount represents less than 15% of XacBank\u2019s \nprojected  funding  needs  for  2014. Of  the  funding  that  ADB  will  provide  to  XacBank,  up  to  $6 \nmillion will be targeted to MSMEs in the Bayankhoshuu and Selbe ger areas under the Ger Area \nDevelopment Program.  \n \nB. \n \n17. \nADB will receive annual audited financial statements for TFG, XacBank, and XacLeasing \nin  accordance  with  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards.  ADB  will  also  receive \nquarterly  financial  statements  and  compliance  certificates  for  agreed  financial  covenants. \nReporting  requirements  include  (i)  updates  on  governance,  safeguards,  and  social  protection \ncompliance;  and  (ii)  updates  on  XacBank  and  XacLeasing\u2019s  business  performance  and \nutilization  of  the  ADB  loans.  ADB  will  field  review  missions  at  least  annually  to  examine  and \ndiscuss progress with TFG, XacBank, and XacLeasing\u2019s management. \n \nC. \n \n18. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nADB\u2019s presence adds value through the following: \n(i) \n\nADB will provide stable long-term financing that cannot be readily raised from the \nlocal  market,  and  is  needed  to  help  banks  deal  with  the  maturity  mismatch  on \ntheir balance sheet. Mongolia\u2019s capital markets are undeveloped and commercial \nbank funding is not readily available in large amounts. Also, Mongolia has felt the \nimpact  of  the  problems  in  Europe's  banking  industry,  which  used  to  provide \nfinancing to Mongolian banks. Hence, Mongolian banks have had to turn to IFIs. \nADB\u2019s  loan  to  XacBank  will  help  overcome  the  lack  of  access  to  finance  that \nMSMEs  now  experience  in  Mongolia.  MSME  growth  is  needed  to  help  diversify \n\n(ii) \n\n                                                \n10 XacBank\u2019s loan portfolio growth has averaged about $120 million annually since 2010. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n       \n\n5 \n\nthe country\u2019s economy. The ADB loan also directly complements the work of the \nsovereign  sector\u2019s  Ger  Area  Development  Program  by  helping  promote  private \nsector  development  and  growth  of  business  activity  in  the  ger  areas  where \nXacBank already has an established branch presence.  \nADB\u2019s  funding  will  also  help  support  the  nascent  leasing  industry  in  Mongolia, \nwhich is in need of access to funds for its growth. The leasing industry provides a \ncritical  alternative  for  businesses  that  cannot  access  bank  funding  due  to \ncollateral requirements.    \nThrough  on-site  monitoring  with  TFG,  XacBank,  and  XacLeasing  management \nover  the  life  of  the  loan,  ADB  will  support  the  group\u2019s  adherence  to  high \ncorporate governance, social, environmental, and risk management standards. \n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nRisks \n\nD. \n \n19. \nChallenging  operational  environment.  Mongolia  has  a  small,  narrowly  diversified \neconomy,  with  high  reliance  on  the  cyclical  mining  sector.  Recent  high  inflation  has  further \nexposed the banking industry to economic and policy risks, and there have been decreases in \nforeign  direct  investment  and  foreign  exchange  reserves.  Solid  economic  growth  prospects, \nalong with progress in economic stabilization and an open, market-led economy partly mitigate \nthese  weaknesses. 11  Authorities  have  taken  measures  to  tighten  prudential  regulations  on \ncapital  requirements,  asset  classification,  and  loss  provisions.  The  managements  of  TFG, \nXacBank,  and  XacLeasing  are  cognizant  of  the  risks  imposed  by  Mongolia\u2019s  economic \nenvironment,  and  to  help  mitigate  the  risks  imposed  by  the  operating  environment,  the  group \nconservatively manages its capital position and keeps a significant liquidity buffer at XacBank, \nwhich also maintains a diversified and granular loan portfolio with prudent limits on sector and \nborrower concentration. \n \n20. \nRapid  growth  of  credit  in  Mongolia.  Banking  credit  growth  has  increased  in  2013, \nreaching  23%  in  the  first  6  months  of  the  year,  partly  driven  by  the  government\u2019s  specialized \nprogram  funding  for  SMEs  in  targeted  segments  such  as  meat,  flour,  and  fuel,  as  well  as \nmortgages. This follows a slowdown in credit growth in 2012, when it was 24% for the full year. \nWhile  credit  growth  has  increased  significantly  since  the  global  financial  crisis,  it  was  from  a \nrelatively  small  and  narrow  base.  BOM  is  taking  steps  to  improve  bank  supervision,  and  has \nincreased the capital requirements for systemically important banks. As a systemically important \nbank,  XacBank  is  exposed  to  tougher  supervision  and  a  higher  regulatory  capital  requirement \nthan  banks  that  are not considered  systemically  important.  Although it  remains a concern,  the \nrisk of overheating has also receded as a result of the policy tightening evident in 2012.12  \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n \nA. \n \n21. \nImpact. The impacts of the loans are (i) growth of the banking and leasing sectors; and \n(ii) greater access to banking credit and leasing services for underserved MSMEs in Mongolia. \nThis will be reflected by an increase in loans and leases, as well as an increase in the ratio of \nbanking  sector  credit  to  gross  domestic  product,  and  ratio  of  leasing  sector  credit  to  gross \ndomestic  product.  Additionally,  ADB  will  support  broader  finance  sector  development  through \nfinancing XacLeasing in a country that has a very small nonbank sector.  \n\n \n\n                                                \n11 Standard & Poor\u2019s. 2013. Banking Industry Country Risk Assessment: Mongolia. New York. \n12 Moody\u2019s Investors Service. 2013. Banking System Outlook: Mongolia. New York. \n\n\f6          \n \n\nOutcome.  The  outcome  will  be  the  growth  and  sustainability  of  XacBank\u2019s  financial \n22. \nservices and XacLeasing services to MSMEs in Mongolia. This will be measured by monitoring \nnonperforming  loans  and  capital  adequacy,  and  the  increased  volume  of  lending  to  MSME \nborrowers. A large number of new MSME borrowers are expected to be women.  Although not \nbeing measured, providing financing to MSMEs will strengthen their role as an important source \nof employment, especially in underserved ger and rural areas. Moreover, funding these entities \nhelps diversify the economy.  \n \nOutputs. The output of the loans is that XacBank\u2019s and XacLeasing\u2019s financial capacity \n23. \nto service MSMEs  is  expanded. XacBank  and XacLeasing  will  provide  financial  services while \nensuring that adequate investment is made in human resources and business processes. \n \nB. \n \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n \nStrategy  2020\u2019s13 focus  on  poverty  reduction  through  private  sector  development  and \n24. \ninclusive  financial  systems  will  be  supported  by  TFG\u2019s  emphasis  on  funding  underserved \nsegments  of  the  Mongolian  population.  The  Government  of  Mongolia  considers  that  private \nsector development will be a thematic driver of change, and that ADB  assistance is needed to \nstrengthen  financial  markets  to  support  long-term  investment,  innovation,  and  access  to \nfinance. 14 ADB\u2019s  strategy  also  provides  that  ADB  will  increase  access  to  finance  by \nstrengthening financial intermediation through the banking industry. Access for MSMEs and the \nrural  population  to  formal  sources  of  credit  is  limited.  ADB\u2019s  finance  sector  assessment  for \nMongolia  further  concludes  that  broader  and  deeper  financial  intermediation  is  necessary  for \nMongolia \nfinance  sector  assessment \nrecommends the continued  development  of the  finance  sector  and  improvements  in  access to \nfinance.  The  proposed  loans  are  also  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  SME  development \nprogram  aimed  at  boosting  SME  capacity  and  job  creation.  The  loans  also  complement  the \ngovernment\u2019s  ongoing  MSME  lending  programs  through  the  commercial  banks.  These \nprograms  target  specific  sectors  and types  of  enterprises  that  the  government  deems  eligible, \nso many MSMEs continue to seek funding not available to them under these programs.   \n \n\nlong-term  growth. 15 The \n\nto  achieve  sustainable, \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n \n25. \nIn  2008,  ADB  conducted  an  independent  evaluation  of  ADB  assistance  to  the  finance \nsector.16 Based  on  this  analysis,  and  in  view  of  looming  challenges  and  opportunities,  it  put \nforward  recommendations  for  future  operations.  These  included  (i)  considering  nonsovereign \nequity investments in and loans to Mongolian banks by ADB to strengthen operational capacity; \n(ii)  supporting  rural  finance  by  using  banks  to  channel  credit  to  meet  the  gap  in the  supply  of \nrural finance in the country; (iii) providing longer-term loans to meet and promote the needs of \nSMEs; and (iv) supporting the development of nonbank and capital market sectors.   \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n13 ADB.  2008.

The potential impacts and risks associated with XacBank \nand  XacLeasing\u2019s  existing  and  likely  future  portfolios,  and  their  commitment  and  capacity  for \nenvironmental and social management, have been assessed. Existing social and environmental \nmanagement  systems have been  reviewed.  In respect  of  loans  and  leases  extended  by  using \nADB  funds,  the  companies  will  integrate  and  apply  ADB\u2019s  prohibited  investment  activities  list \nwith its existing exclusion list; ensure compliance with applicable national laws and regulations, \nand  with  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  An  enhanced  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system (ESMS) satisfactory to ADB will be a condition of first disbursement. The \nESMS will require compliance with national labor laws and will include measures to comply with \ninternationally  recognized  core  labor  standards,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \nStrategy (2001), including provisions prohibiting any discrimination against women in hiring and \nproviding  equal  pay for equal  work for  men  and  women. The  human resource  policies  of TFG \ncompanies  are  based  on  equal  opportunities.  XacBank  also  targets  female  customers  as  an \nimportant  business  segment,  and  the  bank\u2019s  commercial  policies  and  practices  support  equal \nopportunities  for  women  in  access  to  services  and  markets.  XacBank  commits  to  provide \ngender-sensitive  outreach  training  to  XacBank  and  XacLeasing  staff  on  servicing  women \ncustomers  and  borrowers.  The  borrowers\u2019  reporting  requirements  to  ADB  include  reporting  on \nsubloans  by  gender,  and  ADB  will  monitor  progress  in  supporting  female  borrowers  over  the \ncourse  of  the  loan.
