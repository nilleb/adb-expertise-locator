The  Armenian  finance  sector  is  heavily  dominated  by  banks,  which \naccount  for  about  90%  of  sector  assets.  The  banking  subsector,  consisting  of  17  banks,  is \nfragmented and is dominated by foreign-owned banks, which account for more than 50% of total \nbanking assets. AMB is the largest bank and has a market share of about 17% in total assets. To \ndrive  consolidation  and  strengthen  the  banking  system,  the  Central  Bank  of  Armenia  (CBA) \nincreased the minimum capital requirements for commercial banks from AMD5 billion ($10 million) \nto AMD30 billion ($60 million), effective 1 January 2017, which led to a consolidation of the sector \nfrom  21  to  17  banks.  The  banking  industry  lacks  some  important  funding  tools  (e.g.,  a  well-\nfunctioning interbank market and developed capital markets) and is not effectively supplemented \nby nonbank financial institutions, nor supported by institutional investors.  \n  \n3. \nSmall  and  medium-sized  enterprises.  Access  to  finance  in  Armenia  is  problematic, \nparticularly  for  mid-sized  and  small  enterprises,  and  microentrepreneurs.  The  World  Bank \nestimates that 50% of Armenia\u2019s 130,000 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have no \naccess to finance, and this figure increases to 60%\u201370% in rural areas.1 Banks have traditionally \nhad larger exposures to corporate clients, which were perceived to be lower risk. SMEs account \nfor the vast majority of enterprises in Armenia but contribute a disproportionately low amount to \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  (43.0%),  employment  (41.7%),  foreign  trade,  and  foreign \ninvestment.  According  to  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  estimates,  the  informal  economy \nrepresents 11.3% of total GDP and is highest in agriculture (22.4%), construction (15.4%), and \nwholesale and retail trade (14.8%)\u2014sectors with the largest SME share. Given the large informal \neconomy share, the importance of SMEs may be underestimated in official statistics.  \n \n4. \nSome  banks  in  Armenia  have  started  shifting  their  strategies  to  target  this  untapped \nsegment  because  of  rising  demand  and  higher  yields  for  the  banks,  coupled  with  better \nunderstanding  of  SMEs and  corresponding  underwriting  practices.  AMB  is  one  such  bank  and \nhas been identified as a strong partner for ADB to help improve access to finance in the country. \nTo better match the needs of SME borrowers in terms of loan tenors and products, the bank needs \nlonger tenor debt, which is not readily available in the market. ADB also has the opportunity to \nsupport AMB through an equity investment and in preparation for a planned initial public offering \n(IPO). Fresh equity is needed to fund future growth, help AMB develop into a universal bank, and \nmaintain healthy capital adequacy levels. As per its business plan, AMB needs to raise $60 million \nof fresh equity until the end of 2019 to maintain its target Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio (CAR) at \n15%. It plans to raise $30 million in FY2017 from a high-quality shareholder and views ADB as a \nstrong partner, which will not only support its growth but also build its profile among international \ninvestors. This will be ADB\u2019s first equity investment in Armenia. The proposed funding deepens \n\n                                                 \n1   World Bank. 2016. Financial Inclusion Data. Washington, DC. \n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s relationship with AMB. AMB is a participating bank in ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program and \nin 2011 received an ADB loan, which has been fully repaid.2   \n \nB. \n \n5. \nAMB is the largest bank in Armenia in terms of assets ($1.48 billion; 17% market share) \nand  loan  portfolio  (20%  market  share).  The  bank  primarily  serves  corporate  customers  (about \n75% of its portfolio), with the remainder SMEs and retail customers. It has 13 branches throughout \nArmenia  and more than 600  employees.  Fitch  has  assigned  AMB  a  Long-Term Issuer  Default \nRating  of  \u201cB+\u201d  with  a  stable  outlook,  in  line  with  the  sovereign.  The  rating  reflects  reasonable \nfinancial  metrics,  sizeable  liquidity  cushion,  manageable  refinancing  risks,  and  solid  domestic \nfranchise. \n \n6.  \n\nAMB\u2019s business strategy for 2017\u20132020 has four key priorities:  \n(i) \n\nBecome Armenia\u2019s first universal bank. AMB\u2019s goal is to be the first universal \nbank  in  Armenia  providing  a  complete  range  of  banking  services.  It  plans  to \nstrengthen its market share to 20% in 2020 and grow its loan book by 10%\u201312% \nannually until 2022. During this period, management plans to increase its SME and \nretail portfolio by leveraging technology, launching new customized products, and \ntargeting  high-growth,  promising  sectors  of  the  economy  (e.g.,  agriculture, \ninformation  technology  [IT],  energy,  renewables,  and  services).  The  bank\u2019s \nproduct mix will be gradually balanced, increasing the share of SME retail loans \nover total loans from 23.6% in FY2016 to more than 30% in FY2020.  \nReduce funding cost. AMB plans to strengthen its position in the deposit market \nby FY2019 through mobilizing deposits and diversifying funding sources. The bank \nhas 18% of the market by current account and time deposits. Customer deposits \nare  expected  to  reach  $1.12  billion  from  $980  million  in  FY2016.  As  part  of  its \nfunding strategy, AMB aims to strengthen relationships with its existing and new \ninternational financial institution (IFI) partners, and target $434 million in IFI funding \nby FY2019. AMB actively issues bonds in the local market, and will continue to do \nso, as this offers a cheaper and stable funding source. \nReinforce  institutional  capacity  and  efficiency.  AMB  aims  to  improve  its \ncapacity  and  efficiency  with  new  distribution  channels,  digital  finance,  improved \nhuman  resource  processes,  and  branding.  While  AMB  is  the  largest  bank  by \nassets, it is still significantly smaller than some of its peers in physical presence. It \nhas 13 branches compared to the 66 branches of Ardshinbank (ranked second in \nthe  market)  and  50  branches  of  Armbusinessbank  (ranked  third).  AMB  has \nmanaged  its  growth  and  leadership  by  careful  selection  of  branch  sites  and \neffective use of digital channels to reach its target customers. Since 2012, AMB \nhas been investing heavily in IT solutions to strengthen its position as a digital bank \nand plans to launch a first-of-a-kind multichannel distribution channel in Armenia \nManagement  expects  that  the  investments  in  IT  and  digital  channels  will  also \nimprove its cost-to-income ratio from 43.2% in Q1 2017 to 41% by Q4 2019. \nInitial public offering. AMB plans to be the first Armenian international financial \ngroup, and it aims to have an initial public offering listing on an international stock \nexchange. It believes that an international listing is critical to its strategic plans, as \nthis  will  enhance  its  corporate  governance  framework  and  provide  access  to  a \nbroader pool of investors to fund its growth plans. AMB has taken several steps to \nprepare for a listing on an international exchange  An in-house IPO team is tasked \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB. 2015.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n 3 \n\nto implement all milestones needed for the listing, including setting up an investor \nrelations  function,  implementing  a  corporate  governance  framework  that  aligns \nwith  listed  companies  on  the  LSE,  and  enhancing  disclosure  and  transparency \nstandards. \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n \n7. \nSmall  and  medium-sized  enterprises  strategy.  In  2010,  AMB  shifted  its  strategy  to \nemphasize the importance of SME lending. Since then, strong growth of this market segment has \nbeen recorded. The compound aggregate growth rate of the SME portfolio for the last 5 years \nwas 45.9%, compared to 30% for the overall loan portfolio. As a result, SME loans reached $158.7 \nmillion by FY2016, and AMB is among the top three banks lending to the SME segment. Based \non current projections, the average growth of the SME portfolio will be 20% and will reach $188 \nmillion by FY2017 and $241 million by FY2019. The share of SME and retail loans in the total \nloan portfolio will increase by about 10% in 3 years. The portfolio\u2019s growth will be driven mainly \nby  the  application  of  flexible  lending  mechanisms  during  the  financing  process,  individual \napproach to clients, and high-quality service. AMB has conducted detailed market analysis of the \nSME segment and plans to roll out products tailored to SMEs\u2019 needs. AMB has invested in new \nbranches and sales points, as well as improvements to its multichannel distribution network.  \n \nC. \n \n8. \nOwnership. AMB (formerly Armimpexbank CJSC) was established in July 1992. In 2007, \nAMB  was  acquired  by  TDA  Holdings  Limited,  which  purchased  a  96.15%  shareholding.  TDA \nHoldings  Limited  was  renamed  to  Ameria  Group  in  2011.  In  2013,  Ameria  Group  Limited \nincreased  its  share  in  AMB  to  100%.  On  23  December  2015,  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD)  purchased  newly  issued  shares  in  AMB.  On  21 \nDecember 2016, ESPS Holding Limited purchased 13.5% of AMB shares from Ameria Group.3 \nAs of August 2017, the AMB shareholders were Ameria Group (65.80%), EBRD (20.69%), and \nESPS  Holding  Limited  (13.51%).  These  shareholders  are  looking  to  enhance  the  bank\u2019s \nshareholder  base  of  high-quality  institutional  investors  to  strengthen  its  profile  and  corporate \ngovernance ahead of the planned IPO. This may result in further dilution of Ameria Group\u2019s stake \nin the bank.  \n \n Integrity  due  diligence  has  been  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Integrity  Due \n9. \nDiligence  Guidelines  for  Nonsovereign  Operations. 4  No  significant  or  potentially  significant \nintegrity issues were identified. Tax integrity due diligence was also conducted because of the \npresence  of  intermediate  jurisdictions  (Cyprus  and  Liechtenstein)  in  the  ownership  structure.5 \nADB\u2019s  review  of  the  entity  does  not  give  ADB  cause  to  believe  that  such  entity  has  been \nestablished,  or  is  being  used  for  cross-border  tax  evasion,  money  laundering,  or  terrorism \nfinancing in the jurisdictions involved in the investment.  \n \n10.  Management.  The  management  board  consists  of  10  members  with  considerable \nexperience in banking, telecom and advisory businesses \u2013 coming from local and international \nfirms. \n \nGovernance structure. AMB\u2019s corporate governance is good and further improvements \n11. \nhave been made given the bank\u2019s plans for the IPO. As part of the IPO development plan, in 2016 \n\n                                                 \n3   ESPS Holding has shares of AMB\u2019s management team vested under the employee stock ownership plan. \n4  ADB. 2015. Integrity Due Diligence Guidelines for Nonsovereign Operations. Manila. \n5   ADB. 2016. Anticorruption Policy: Enhancing the Role of the Asian Development Bank in Relation to Tax Integrity. \n\nManila.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nAMB  established  three  board-level  committees,  each  comprising  three  members:  an  audit \ncommittee  chaired  by  an  independent  director,  a  remuneration  committee,  and  a  nominations \ncommittee. Moreover, the board was increased to comprise seven directors (from five), three of \nwhom  were  appointed  in  2016.  One  of  the  new  directors  is  the  EBRD  nominee  director  (A. \nGermanovich), who brings considerable external expertise in multiple business sectors. Although \nthere  is  no  formal  requirement  to  have  an  independent  director,  AMB  has  four  independent \nmembers on its board. In November 2013, A. Mkrtchyan, the CEO of Ameria Group, became the \nboard  chair,  replacing  R.  Vardanyan,  who  remains  a  board  director.  A.  Mkrtchyan  has  a \nbackground  in  public  and  private  sector  advisory  and  investment  banking.  R.  Vardanyan,  a \nRussian-Armenian, the founder and the president of Troika Dialog, the first investment bank in \nRussia.. He is a prominent investment banker and recognized for his philanthropy.  \n \nRisk management. AMB is governed by a board-approved risk management policy that \n12. \noversees  all  aspects  of  risk  including  credit,  operation,  market,  liquidity,  interest  rate,  and \ncompliance.  AMB\u2019s  chief  risk  officer  reports  directly  to  the  board,  and  the  board  is  updated \nregularly on the risks and mitigating actions taken to manage them. The risk management center \n(RMC) is a dedicated department reporting directly to the management board. The RMC consists \nof five units: credit risk analytics, business credit risk, retail credit risk, operational risk, and market \nrisk. The internal audit and financial monitoring services report directly to the board.  \n \nCredit risk management is the responsibility of the RMC\u2019s corporate credit risk and retail \n13. \ncredit risk units, which focus on overall portfolio assessment, and the review and monitoring of \nbusiness  loans.  For  business  loans,  there  is  a  clear  segregation  of  duties:  client  managers \noriginate loan applications and pass them on to the corporate loan department, which prepares a \ncredit report. This  is  then  independently  reviewed  by  the  RMC  before being  considered  at  the \ncredit committee. The RMC does not have explicit veto power, but its disagreement with a credit \nproposal  automatically  escalates  it  to  the  large  credit  committee,  attended  by  the  RMC  head, \nwhere decisions are based on a majority vote. Credit approval levels are granular and vary by \nproduct. All related party exposures require board approval.  \n \nCONFDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB FINANCING \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n14. \nThe proposed ADB assistance consists of (i) an equity investment of the dram equivalent \nof  up  to  $30  million,  and  (ii)  a  5-year  senior  unsecured  loan  of  up  to  $30  million  or  (at  ADB\u2019s \ndiscretion)  its  dram  equivalent  to  support  SMEs  in  Armenia.6 CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION \nDELETED \n \nB. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n15. \nReporting  arrangements.  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  will  carry  out \nproject  monitoring  of  ADB\u2019s  debt  and  equity  investments.  AMB  will  provide  ADB  with  financial \nreports at agreed intervals and as requested. These will include (i) quarterly unaudited financial \n\n                                                 \n6  For the ADB loan, SMEs are defined following the European Union definition as having up to 250 employees and \n\neither (i) an annual business turnover of up to AMD1,500 million or (ii) assets of up to AMD1,000 million. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n 5 \n\nstatements,  (ii) compliance  certificates  for  financial  covenants,  (iii)  annual  audited  financial \nstatements, (iv) reports on characteristics of AMB\u2019s loan portfolio, (v) annual reports on selected \ndevelopment indicators agreed between ADB and AMB, and (vi) annual environmental and social \nsafeguard monitoring and compliance reports.  \n \nC. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n16. \nEconomic  growth  and  access  to  finance.  SMEs  in  Armenia  have  very  constrained \naccess to finance. Banks often find it difficult to service this segment because of perceived higher \nrisks, difficulties in obtaining information, and collateral requirements. ADB will support AMB in \nproviding funding to this important customer segment and expanding new product offerings, thus \nsupporting overall economic growth, job creation, and diversification.  \n \n17. \nAccess  to  long-term,  local  currency  funding.  CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION \nDELETED.  The  ADB  loan  will  provide  critically  needed  long-tenor  funding  to  AMB  to  better \nsupport SMEs given the absence of long-term funding sources such as well-developed capital \nmarkets. The ADB loan will help AMB extend the maturity of its lending and better match the tenor \nof its SME products, which have an average tenor of 5 years.  \n \n18. \nADB\u2019s  debt  funding  is  also  expected  to  be  partially  in  local  currency.  ADB\u2019s  Treasury \nDepartment has obtained the necessary approvals to raise dram through a local currency bond \nissuance. To date, EBRD and the International Finance Corporation have issued local currency \nbonds  in  the  market.  Although  the  market  is  small,  preliminary  indications  are  that  demand  is \nstrong  enough  to  support  up  to  $15  million  equivalent  of  debt  funding,  and  the  remaining  $15 \nmillion  of  the  loan  could  be  in  dollars.  Providing  local  currency  debt  funding  to  AMB  will  help \nreduce the currency mismatch and lower the foreign exchange risk for AMB\u2019s borrowers.  \n \n19. \nCatalyze capital as a strategic shareholder. The proceeds from ADB\u2019s investment will \nmeet AMB\u2019s capital requirements for FY2018 and support its planned IPO. The proposed equity \nfunding  will  have  a  multiplier  effect.  AMB\u2019s  total-capital-to-gross-loans  ratio  was  17.07%  in \nFY2016 and 27.58% in FY2015. Hence, leveraging ADB\u2019s equity injection will enable AMB to lend \na much larger amount to its target customers as it makes a strategic shift to focus more on retail \nand SME loans. Additional capital will also ensure compliance with CBA guidelines. While AMB\u2019s \nFY2016  CAR  of  20.46%  is  healthy  as  per  Basel  2  standards,  it  drops  to  15.87%  once  CBA\u2019s \ndiscretionary adjustments are applied to calculate the risk-weighted assets. Applying the same \nmethodology, AMB\u2019s FY2017 CAR is projected at 12.70%. Without additional equity injection, this \nleaves  little  cushion  over  CBA\u2019s  minimum  CAR  of  12.00%.  ADB\u2019s  equity  investment  is  also \nexpected to support AMB\u2019s IPO by catalyzing other investors. ADB, as a strategic partner, will \nhelp enhance AMB\u2019s shareholder base of high-quality IFIs and contribute to its ability to reach the \nunderserved SME segment through the transaction technical assistance. ADB will be AMB\u2019s only \nsolely Asia-focused equity shareholder. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs  \n\nImpact. The impact will be improved availability of credit to SMEs and expansion of private \n\n20. \nfinancial services in Armenia. \n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nOutcome.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  uptake  of  financial  services  by  SMEs.  The \n21. \nproject will enable AMB to provide sustainable financial services to SMEs and thereby contribute \nto the growth and diversification of the Armenian economy as well as to employment creation.  \n \n22. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs. Outputs will be the increased financing capacity of AMB to serve SMEs. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n23. \nADB and country strategy. Under ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, ADB aims \nto  strengthen  its  support  for  the  finance  sector  by  assisting  the  development  of  financial \ninfrastructure, institutions, and products and services; and by promoting inclusive growth.7 AMB\u2019s \nemphasis on lending to segments with high potential for employment and income generation will \nsupport inclusive growth. ADB funds will help AMB provide loans to SMEs to meet their investment \nneeds  and  support  overall  growth.  This  is  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  promote \ngrowth and economic diversification, and with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Armenia, \n2014\u20132018.8 \n  \n24. \nSector  strategy  and  ADB  operations.  ADB  plays  a  tangible  role  in  the  deepening  of \nfinancial services in Armenia. In 2011, ADB supported four banks in Armenia through senior loans \ntotaling  $65  million.  ACBA  Credit  Agricole,  AMB,  Ardshininvestbank,  and  Inecobank  were  the \nbanks selected in ADB\u2019s Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Finance Program. The loan to and \nequity investment in AMB will continue ADB\u2019s efforts to develop Armenia\u2019s financial market and \nsupport SMEs. These efforts also complement sovereign programs in the finance sector, such as \nthe Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Support Sector Development Program (2012).9 \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \n\n25. \nThe project is classified category FI for impacts on environment, involuntary resettlement, \nand  indigenous  peoples.  The  project\u2019s  potential  environment  and  social  impacts,  its  risks \nassociated with AMB\u2019s existing and/or likely future portfolio, and its commitment and capacity for \nenvironmental and social management have been assessed. AMB subloan subprojects assessed \nduring due diligence have required land acquisition and new subloans will likely also require this. \nHowever, no significant involuntary displacement has occurred on AMB-financed subprojects. No \nAMB subloan subprojects have had impacts on indigenous peoples\u2019 communities, and none are \nexpected. The environmental and social management system applies IFIs\u2019 prohibited investment \nactivities list, has procedures to address subprojects\u2019 environmental and social risks, ensures that \ninvestments abide by applicable national laws and regulations, and complies with national labor \nlaws  and  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  (2001).  Additional  guidelines  are  available  in  the \nenvironmental  and  social  management  system  for  subprojects  that  have  significant  adverse \nenvironmental and social impacts, including involuntary resettlement.  \n  \n26.   AMB committed to exclude the ADB loan and equity funds from supporting any activities \nunder the Prohibited Investment Activities List or category A subprojects. ADB will monitor the \nuse  of  ADB  proceeds  through  AMB\u2019s  semiannual  reporting  obligations  and  application  of  the \nenvironmental and social management system. Semiannual reports will include reporting on the \n                                                 \n7   ADB. 2014.

As additional assurance of ADB projects\u2019 use on \nnon-category  A  subprojects  only,  AMB  is  committed  to  consulting  with  ADB  in  the  screening, \nreviewing, and finalizing of environment and social assessments for subprojects with potentially \nsignificant impacts and risks, prior to AMB credit committee approval.  \n \n27. \nThe  transaction  is  classified  as  having  some  gender  elements.  AMB  will  comply  with \nnational  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy,  will  take  measures  to \ncomply with the internationally recognized core labor standards. AMB will report regularly to ADB \non  (i)  its  compliance  with  such  laws,  and  (ii)  the  measures  taken.  Information  disclosure  and \nconsultation with affected people will be conducted following ADB requirements. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n28. \nAMB was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nC. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),10 \n29. \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of Armenia \nhas  no  objection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to  AMB.
