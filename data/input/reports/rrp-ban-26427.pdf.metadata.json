The selected towns are prone to river flooding, river \nerosion, waterlogging, and flash floods. The poorer income groups, \nespecially  recently  settled  dwellers,  are  the  most  vulnerable  to \ndisaster. Lack of flood protection and inadequate drainage lead to \nwaterlogging  and  overflowing  of  sewerage  facilities,  especially \nlatrines,  and  cause  widespread  environmental  degradation  and \ndeplorable unsanitary living conditions.  \n \nThe  integrated  approach,  combining  river  protection  works  with \ndrainage and basic sanitation services, is appropriate for the urban \nareas in Bangladesh, which are prone to frequent river flooding, \nparticularly in low-lying areas with poor drainage systems. In the \nproject  design,  flood  protection  works  are  fully  integrated  with \ndrainage  system  improvement,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste \nmanagement to establish better environmental conditions and more \nhygienic living conditions for the poor in the slums. \n \nWhile most of the project investments will be directed toward the \nconstruction of infrastructure facilities for urban flood protection, the \nparticipating  towns  will  also  implement  the  Urban  Governance \nImprovement  Action  Program  (UGIAP)  which  was  originally \nintroduced in an earlier Asian Development Bank  (ADB)-assisted \nproject in six key result areas,  four  for enhancing awareness and \nparticipation  of  local  stakeholders  in  urban  planning  and \nmanagement,  and  two  for  improving  accountability  and \ntransparency  in  municipal  administration.  The  long-term \nsustainability of the project investments will depend on progress \nthat the project towns will make in managing their municipal affairs.  \n    ", "iii \nRationale  The growth potential of the urban sector in Bangladesh is severely \nundermined by frequent flooding. There are about 550 urban centers \nin Bangladesh and many of them suffer from severe erosion and  \ndestruction of  physical infrastructure  caused by  river flooding  and  \nwaterlogging.  Flooding  is  a  perennial  problem  and the urban \nareas are more prone to economic and human losses due to their \nhigh population density and concentration   of   industrial   and   \ninvestments  sites.    While  the Government had wanted to address \nthe problems of flooding and erosion in urban areas as early as in \nthe  1970s,  no  major  investments  could  be  carried  out  due  to \nresource constraints. As a result, the urban areas, especially the \nsecondary towns, have remained neglected. \n \nAfter the devastating floods of 1987 and 1988, the Government and \ndevelopment partners prepared the Flood Action Plan. Under the \nplan, Dhaka and 15 district towns were identified for urban flood \nprotection. ADB has already provided two loans to cover Dhaka and \n6 of the 15 district towns. ADB's intervention proved to be very \neffective, as evidenced during another massive flooding in 1998. The \nproposed Project will cover the remaining towns identified earlier. A \nfeasibility study for a third loan for urban flood protection is included \nunder the Project.  \n   \nObjectives   The Project comprises four components:   \n(i)  Component A: flood protection works \n(ii)  Component B: urban drainage system improvement \n(iii)  Component C: urban environmental improvement  \n(iv)  Component D: capacity building and implementation \nassistance \n \nComponent A will consist of flood protection works for each of the \nselected towns. The works may be either new facilities or upgrade \nof existing ones. Typically, flood protection works include earthen \nflood  embankments,  reinforced  concrete  flood  walls,  drainage \nregulators, and river training or bank protection works including \ngroynes and revetments. \n \nComponent B will comprise improvements to the existing drainage \nworks. The main works will be construction of large lined drains and \nopen unlined drainage outfalls. Many small structures such as road \nculverts and bridges will be constructed throughout the drainage \nsystem. \n \nBased  on  the  very  positive  results  of  the  urban  environmental \nimprovement works under the previous loan (particularly in slum \nareas),  greater  emphasis  in  the  second  phase  is  placed  on \ncomponent C, which aims at environmental improvements at the \ntown  level.  It  comprises  (i)  a  solid  waste  management \nsubcomponent,  including  sanitary  landfill  sites  and  composting \nfacilities;  (ii)  installation  of  sanitary  latrines;  and  (iii)  slum \nimprovement activities. Road improvement works for small stretches \n ", "iv \n  connecting  slums  and  solid  waste  disposal  facilities  are  also \nincluded in the respective subcomponents. \n \nComponent  D  includes  capacity  building  and  implementation \nassistance  for  (i)  project  management,  detailed  design  of  the \nvarious   investment   components   for   each   project town, and \nconstruction supervision and quality control of the works; (ii) support \nto urban governance improvement; and (iii) assistance to implement \nslum improvement activities under component C. A feasibility study \nis also proposed under component D to prepare the next phase of \nthe urban flood protection project in Bangladesh.   \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $128.88  million \nequivalent. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at $9.13 million, \nor about 7.08% of the total cost, including $2.01 million for interest \ncharge. The local currency cost is estimated at $119.75 million \nequivalent, or about 92.91% of the total cost, including duties and \ntaxes of about $12.98 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $80 million equivalent \nfrom its Special Funds resources to cover 62.1% of the total project \ncost, including $71.31 million equivalent of the local currency cost. \nThe OPEC Fund for International Development will provide a loan \nof $15.0 million to cofinance 11.6% of the total project cost. The \nOPEC Fund loan will have a maturity of 20 years with a grace \nperiod of 5 years, and an interest rate of 1.0% per annum and a \nservice charge of 1%. A domestic contribution of $33.88 million \nequivalent is required. It will include $33.78 million equivalent from \nthe  Government,  and  $0.1  million  equivalent  from  the  project \nbeneficiaries. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $80 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will have \na 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; interest charge \nof 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the Loan \nAgreement. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project   \nCompletion Date  30 June 2009 \n   \nExecuting Agency  Executing agencies (EAs) of the Project will be the Bangladesh \nWater Development Board (BWDB) under the Ministry of Water \nResources  (MOWR)  and  the  Local  Government  Engineering \nDepartment (LGED) under the Ministry of Local Government, Rural \nDevelopment and Cooperatives (MLGRDC). BWDB will be the lead \nEA.  ", "v \nImplementation  Actual  implementation  of  component  A  and  a  small  part  of \nArrangements  component B will be undertaken by the BWDB field divisions. A \nproject implementation unit (PIU) will be established at each project \ntown,  headed  by  the  respective  executive  engineers  with \nsubdivisional engineers, sectional officers, and work assistants as \nmembers. \n \nActual implementation of components B and C will be carried out by \nthe project towns under the technical supervision and guidance of \nLGED.  A  PIU  for  each  project  town  will  be  established  in  the \nmunicipal  office  and  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day \nimplementation  of  the  respective  physical  works.  LGED  will \ncoordinate centrally all activities of the nine PIUs through consultants \nand project management office (PMO) staff. \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Since the contracts for civil works will \nbe small and widely dispersed, international competitive bidding \n(ICB) is not appropriate. Consequently, all civil works contracts will \nbe  procured  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding  among \nprequalified  contractors  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s \nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB. Each supply contract \nfor equipment or materials estimated to cost $500,000 equivalent or \nmore will be awarded on the basis of ICB, and those costing less \nthan the equivalent of $500,000 (other than minor items) but more \nthan  $100,000  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international \nshopping. Direct purchase procedures will be used for small or off-\nthe-shelf items valued at less than $100,000. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting services and implementation assistance at the field level \nare required to facilitate project implementation and to strengthen \nthe  institutional,  administrative,  and  financial  capacities  of  the \nproject towns. Consultants and field workers will be selected and \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging domestic consultants. In total, two types of consulting \nservices  will  be  provided.  One  for  project  management  and \nengineering, and the other for UGIAP preparation. Implementation \nassistance at the field level will be provided by UGIAP facilitators \nand the field staff for the slum improvement activities.  For project \nmanagement and engineering, an international  consulting  firm will \nbe  engaged  to assist  BWDB,  LGED,  and the project towns. For \nthe  remaining  three  sets  of  assistance,  domestic  individual \nconsultants  will  be  hired.  A  total  of  64  person-months  of \ninternational and 3,303 person-months of domestic inputs will be \nrequired for the Project \n   \nProject Benefits and  Poverty incidence was found to be as high as 40% of the sample \nBeneficiaries  households, where income is below the poverty line of Tk44,410 \nper year (or $65 per month). Households in hard core poverty \nsurvive  on  incomes of  less than  Tk36,345  per  year  (or  $53 per ", "vi \n  month), concentrated in overcrowded slum and squatter areas, and \nliving in precarious daily hand-to-mouth conditions. Between 7% \nand 30% of the households in hard core poverty are headed by \nwomen. Focus group discussions strongly underline the appeal of \nthe poor for employment opportunities and decent wages; their \nemphasis is on the need to improve drainage for quicker clearance \nof rainwater and facilitation of normal movement during flooding to \nmitigate the loss of workdays. Women are particularly concerned \nabout shelter for themselves and their animals, children\u2019s access to \nschools, as well as access to medicine and health care, especially \nduring floods. Poverty reduction has been made as a strategic \nobjective of each project component, with the view to maximizing \nemployment during construction, developing skills for operation and \nmaintenance (O&M), and building roads and making basic services \navailable in deprived areas. In slums, improved access to water \nsupply,  sanitation,  solid  waste  disposal,  roads  and  footpaths, \nlighting, schools, and health care will be assured. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  While  no  unusual  risk  is  foreseen  during  implementation,  the \npotential risks are (i) implementation delays due to slow progress of \nstart-up activities, such as engagement of consultants and filling up \nthe vacancies in PIUs; (ii) lack of suitably qualified personnel in the \nproject towns, which may eventually lead to weak implementation of \nthe subproject at the town level; (iii) sustainability of the facilities \nand  services  provided  under  the  Project;  and  (iv)  inadequate \ncoordination between the EAs. \n   ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nto Bangladesh for the Secondary Towns Integrated Flood Protection Project Phase 2, and (ii) \nproposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a loan to be provided by the \nOPEC Fund for International Development (OPEC Fund) for the Project.  \n \n2.  The  overall  project  framework  (Appendix  1)  summarizes  the  Project\u2019s  objectives, \nindicators to measure achievements, and assumptions that must be satisfied to avoid the risk of \nnoncompliance. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n1.  Urban Flood Protection in Bangladesh \n \n3.  Although  the  level  of  urbanization  in  Bangladesh  is  relatively  low  with  23%  of  the \npopulation residing in urban areas, already over 40% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product \n(GDP)\u2013\u2013from a low of 25% in the early 1970s\u2013\u2013is derived from the urban sector. The role of the \nurban centers as the engine of growth is clearly recognized in the Government\u2019s latest 5-year \nplan documents, which projected that the urban sector GDP would grow at more than twice the \nrate of the national GDP.  \n \n4.  However, frequent flooding severely undermines the growth potential of the urban sector.   \nThere are about 550 urban centers in Bangladesh and many of them suffer from severe erosion \nand destruction of physical infrastructure because of river flooding and water-logging. Flooding is \na perennial problem in Bangladesh and the urban areas are more prone to economic and human \nlosses due to their high population density and concentration of industrial and investment sites. \nWhile the Government had wanted to address the  problems of flooding and erosion in urban \nareas as early as in the 1970s, no concerted major investments could be carried out due to \nresource constraints. As a result, the urban areas, especially the secondary towns, remained \nneglected.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for  Bangladesh  highlights  the  strategic \nimportance of secondary towns in the urbanization process, and the need to promote them to \nlead a sound and balanced urban development. The Government's Interim-Poverty Reduction \nStrategy Paper (I-PRSP)1 also recognizes urban local bodies as one of the key instruments for \nensuring improved quality and enhanced accountability of public service in urban areas. The I-\nPRSP strongly supports capacity building at the local level, including effective participation of \nwomen in local governance. As for flood protection, reduction of vulnerability to natural disaster is \nrecognized as an integral aspect of the national strategy for poverty reduction. \n \n5.  The devastating floods of 1987 and 1988 were a reminder to all concerned, including \npolicy makers and external development partners, that the threats of severe flooding could no \nlonger be left unattended (Appendix 2). A strong consensus was formed quickly for immediate \naction in a concerted manner. A year later, the Government and the international community \ntogether formulated a comprehensive program, called the Flood Action Plan (FAP), to develop a \nsustained solution to the dangers of frequent flooding. The FAP comprised 26 activities for \nphysical investments, technical studies, and support activities. For urban flood protection, the \nFAP identified Dhaka and 15 district towns to be supported by the Asian Development Bank \n                                                 \n1 Government of Bangladesh. 2003.  A National Strategy for Economic Growth, Poverty Reduction, and Social \nDevelopment. Dhaka. A full PRSP is expected to be completed by end-December 2004. ", "2 \n(ADB). ADB provided two loans2 for urban flood protection to cover Dhaka and 6 of the 15 district \ntowns. ADB's intervention proved to be very effective, as evidenced during another massive \nflooding in 19983 (external assistance for urban flood protection is summarized in Appendix 3).  \n \n6.  Prior to the ADB investments, the earlier interventions related to urban flood protection \nremained largely at master planning stage. Where actual investments were carried out, they were \nimplemented by various agencies on an ad hoc basis without proper coordination. In fact, \npiecemeal efforts had generally been ineffective and, in some cases, inadvertently compounded \nthe environmental health hazards. Inadequate drainage resulted in polluted waters remaining \nstagnant in low-lying land (often densely populated slum areas) for long periods. Uncoordinated \ncollection and disposal of solid waste contributed to localized flooding due to clogged drains. \nSimilarly, inadequate and ineffective excreta management led to high levels of exposure to \nwaterborne pathogens during floods. A clear, urgent need thus emerged to integrate flood \nprotection works with other infrastructure and environment improvement measures in selected \nhigh-priority secondary towns to maximize impact. Given such experience, ADB adopted an \nintegrated approach where flood protection was combined with drainage, sanitation, solid waste \nmanagement, and slum development in one project. \n \n7.  Although implementation of ADB\u2019s integrated flood protection project for the six district \ntowns was delayed by 2 years due to unforeseen natural causes and political events, flood \nprotection facilities constructed under it have safely withstood annual flood seasons since then. \nMoreover,  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  reports  confirmed  that  the  total  beneficiaries \nexceeded the targets set during project appraisal. The respondents in both slum and non-slum \nareas cited significant direct benefits from reduced flood damage, including improved hygiene \nand a cleaner environment, and more efficient solid waste collection. Substantial indirect benefits \nwere also reported: better housing, higher land values, increased daily incomes, and reduction in \nillness  and  medical  costs.  The  project  also  provided  significant  construction  employment \nopportunities for the local poor, and livelihood skills training for women-led community-based \nhandicraft industries. With this positive feedback, the Government and ADB agreed to complete \nthe flood protection facilities for the remaining nine towns that were left out from the first phase of \nthe project. \n \n8.  However, since more than 10 years has passed from the selection of the original 15 \ntowns, it was necessary under the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the second \nphase to update flood information on the remaining towns and reassess the need for ADB \nsupport in those towns. The interministerial meeting held on 1 December 2003 reviewed the \nupdated flood information and decided to include the following secondary towns in the second \nphase:  Brahmanbaria,  Gaibandha,  Jamalpur,  Kushtia,  Manikganj,  Munshiganj,  Mymensingh, \nRajshahi City Corporation (RCC), and Sunamganj.   \n \n2.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n9.  All the towns under the Project are prone to river flooding, river erosion, waterlogging, and \nflash  floods.  The  poorer  income  groups,  especially  recently  settled  dwellers,  are  the  most \nvulnerable to disaster. Lack of flood protection and inadequate drainage lead to waterlogging and \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1991.

The low-lying areas or in close proximity to the embankment, slum dwellers are the first to \nbe inundated when the floods come, as those areas lack proper drainage and sewerage. When \nriver erosion is severe, water intrudes into the surrounding areas causing severe waterlogging. In \nKushtia, the lowlying area is regularly flooded because the existing embankment has deteriorated \nat several points. Without proper sewage and solid waste arrangements, the streets are littered \nwith rubbish and human excreta during floods.  \n \n11.  Often water is stagnant for 2-3 months. Inhabitants wade through knee- and waist-deep \npolluted water to go about their daily activities. Women and children suffer most. Young children \nwho play in the polluted waters suffer from skin ailments and waterborne diseases. With little \nsanitation facilities in the best of times, during flooding and with mobility restricted even further, \nwomen  undergo  hardships  in  personal  hygiene  and  toilet  requirements.  With  no  sewerage \nfacilities, overflowing of drains especially during the monsoons poses a health hazard. Lack of \nsolid waste management is a constant threat to the environment. The economic activities of the \npoor are often jeopardized due to floods, when they remain busy in protecting their belongings at \nthe cost of their employment. There is no ongoing flood or disaster preparedness program in the \nproject towns. During the focus group discussions, women slum dwellers requested a special \nprogram  to  flood-proof  houses,  and  to  generate  income,  and  measures  to  ensure  normal \nmovement year-round.   \n \nB.  Analysis of Lessons Learned from Phase 1 \n12.  The preparation of the phase 2 of the Project is firmly based on the lessons learned from \nphase 1.4 While many documents and reports have been prepared to fully or partially review the \nachievements of phase 1, project completion reports and the project performance audit report \n(PPAR)5 are particularly important. The project preparatory TA also carried out a separate review \nand consolidated all the lessons learned to incorporate them in the design of the new Project. \nWhile the Project is not perceived as disaster related, it has significant disaster mitigating \nimplications. The Project will help reduce the incidence of future disaster related to flooding and \nlessen the demand for rehabilitation projects after disaster. As such, the design of the Project is in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, 2004.6  \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s PPAR by the Operations Evaluation Department confirms that phase 1 of the \nProject has achieved its main objective. Since project completion, the six towns have been \nprotected from annual floods. Drainage and sanitation facilities have reduced the incidence of \nwaterborne diseases. Improvements in the living environment as a consequence of the project \nwere recognized by the majority of the respondents in all project towns. The slum improvement \ncomponent directly benefited some 8,000 households and provided a greater sense of security \nand permanence within towns.      \n \n14.  The PPAR pointed out, however, that adequate operation and maintenance (O&M) of the \nproject assets is the main concern in the long term. It became evident that the project targets for \nrevenue generation and O&M were too ambitious, while not much support was provided for \ncapacity  building  in  financial  management.  Considerable  problems  also  persisted  with  the \ninstitutional and administrative capacity of the urban municipalities for effective provision of local \n                                                 \n4 Details of the project processing chronology is in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n5 ADB. 2003.

As  for  the  river  protection  facilities,  the  joint \nresponsibility for O&M by the concerned project towns and Bangladesh Water Development \nBoard (BWDB) was found to be ineffective, indicating the need for a different approach for phase \n2.  Other key recommendations of the PPAR follow: (i) solid waste dump sites must be designed \nwith  proper  environmental  controls;  (ii)  slum  improvement,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste \nmanagement could be expanded in future projects; and (iii) where adequate O&M is unlikely to be \nprovided, the adoption of more expensive civil works should be considered.  \n \n15.  It is also noted that in Kurigram, one of the six towns in phase 1, 250 meters of revetment \nwas engulfed by the river after project completion. The damage was extended during floods in \nsubsequent years. The incidence of very costly failures like this in Kurigram could have been \navoided by increasing engineering investigations before and during detailed design. The lessons \nlearned were incorporated in the design of phase 2.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n16.  The Project will promote economic growth and reduce poverty in nine selected towns by \nproviding a flood-free and secure living environment within the framework of integrated flood \nprotection. The integrated approach, combining river protection works with drainage and basic \nmunicipal services, is appropriate for the urban areas in Bangladesh, which are prone to frequent \nriver flooding, particularly in low-lying areas with poor drainage systems. The urban sector \nremains a priority for ADB because it presents a greater opportunity for both pro-poor economic \ngrowth, as well as targeted poverty reduction, particularly at the secondary towns level.  \n \n17.  While the Project will benefit the entire urban community in the project towns, some \ncomponents will focus on upgrading the conditions of the poorest and most needy groups in the \nslum  areas  in  particular.  Through  urban  governance  reforms  and  support  to  gender  and \ndevelopment activities, the Project will also promote active participation of women citizens in \nmunicipal management and services as both beneficiaries and agents. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n18.  The Project comprises four components:   \n(i)  Component A: flood protection works; \n(ii)  Component B: urban drainage system improvement; \n(iii)  Component C: urban environmental improvement; and  \n(iv)  Component D: capacity building and implementation assistance.  \n \n19.  These four components are basically identical to those included in phase 1 of the Project. \nThe lessons learned suggested that phase 2 should not depart from the previous project design \nbut further strengthen the focus on environmental improvement activities, including solid waste \nmanagement, low-cost sanitation, and urban poverty reduction. In the project design, flood \nprotection works are fully integrated with drainage system improvement, sanitation, solid waste \nmanagement, and slum improvement to establish better environmental conditions, including more \nhygienic living conditions for all the people of the towns. Major engineering works involved in \nflood control and drainage improvement activities in the towns will be planned with the people\u2019s \nparticipation to minimize adverse social and environmental impacts.  \n \n \n ", "5 \n1.  Component A: Flood Protection Works \n \n20.  This component will consist of flood protection works for each of the selected towns. The \nworks may be either new facilities or upgrade of existing ones. Typically, flood protection works \ninclude earthen flood embankments, reinforced concrete flood walls, drainage regulators, and \nriver training or bank protection works including groynes and revetments.  \n \n2.  Component B: Urban Drainage System Improvement \n \n21.  Component B will comprise improvements to the existing drainage works in each town. \nThe  work  will  aim  to  reduce  nuisance  flooding  in  low-lying  urban  areas  and  improve \nenvironmental conditions generally by removing polluted storm water, which can be a health \nhazard as it is a source of waterborne diseases as well as a breeding ground for mosquitoes.  \n \n22.  The main works require the construction of large lined drains and open unlined drainage \noutfalls. Many small structures such as road culverts and bridges are required throughout the \ndrainage system. In addition, there is a demand for slabs to cover existing concrete drains, which \nare a safety hazard for small children and the elderly.      \n \n3.  Component C: Urban Environmental Improvement \n \n23.  Based on the very positive results of the environmental improvements works under phase \n1 (particularly in slum areas), greater emphasis in phase 2 is placed on component C, which aims \nat environmental improvements at the secondary towns level. Component C comprises the \nfollowing subcomponents: (i) solid waste management, (ii) sanitation improvement, and (iii) slum \nimprovement. Road improvement works for small stretches connecting slums and solid waste \ndisposal facilities are included in the respective subcomponents.  \n \n24.  The solid waste management subcomponent will establish solid waste dump sites with \nadequate  controls  (including  sanitary  landfill  sites)  in  each  project  town  except  Manikganj; \nbuilding a pilot composting facility in RCC; demolishing and disposing of dustheaps, improving \ncollection facilities and establishing solid waste transfer stations, providing mechanical sweeping \nequipment for RCC on a pilot basis, and providing strainers for collecting solid waste from drains \nand transport, including rickshaws, pushcarts, garbage trucks, and bulldozers. \n \n25.  The sanitation improvement subcomponent will provide about 13,200 sanitary latrines and \nabout 22 public toilets. In addition, unhygienic latrines will be converted into sanitary latrines.7 \nAppropriate O&M of latrines, including regular cleaning of the facilities, is critical for project \nsustainability. Town authorities will engage sufficient manpower and water supply for cleaning \npublic toilets several times a day. A sanitation management plan will be prepared for each of the \nnine towns addressing, among others, O&M. \n \n26.  The  slum  improvement  subcomponent  will  provide  basic  infrastructure  facilities  for \nsanitation, drainage, footpaths, water supply, and street lighting for Brahmanbaria, Gaibandha, \nJamalpur, Munshiganj, and Sunamganj. The remaining four towns are covered under other \nprograms supported by either the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) or ADB.8 \nThis  subcomponent  will  be  operated  based  on  a  model  developed  under  UNDP\u2019s  Local \nPartnerships  for  Urban  Poverty  Alleviation  (LPUPA)  program,  where,  on  the  basis  of  a \n                                                 \n7  For the low-cost sanitation component, beneficiaries will take out loans for 50% of the cost of the household toilets \nfrom the revolving fund to be set up by the project towns. This will be repaid every fortnight over a 10-month period at \nthe annual interest rate of 7%. The remaining 50% of the cost will be borne by the beneficiaries. \n8  Three towns under the Project\u2013Kushtia, Mymensingh, and Rajshahi\u2013have been supported by UNDP. Manikganj is \nbeing covered by the urban poverty reduction component under UGIIP. ", "6 \nCommunity Action Plan, the communities access resources from a community development fund \nfor improving basic infrastructure in the slums. This approach is presently followed by LGED. In \naddition, the LPUPA program has a poverty alleviation fund and a component on strengthening \nlocal governments, both of which will also be replicated in this Project.  \n \n4.  Component D: Capacity Building and Implementation Assistance \n27.  The capacity building subcomponent is introduced in phase 2. The long-term sustainability \nof the municipal components, including the drainage and solid waste management facilities, will \nbe at risk unless the capacities of the participating project towns are substantially improved during \nproject implementation. At present, the participating towns lack the capacity to assume the \nadditional  responsibilities  for  managing  the  new  assets  to  be  created  under  the  Project. \nConsiderable  problems  also  persist  regarding  the  institutional,  organizational,  and  financial \ncapacity of the project towns to provide effective municipal services.  \n \n28.  Component D includes consulting services to assist the project management office (PMO) \nat the central level and the project implementation units (PIUs) at the town level in (i) developing \nwork procedures for project management, preparing detailed designs of the various investment \ncomponents for each project town, and providing construction supervision and quality control of \nthe works; (ii) supporting urban governance improvement under the UGIAP; and (iii) helping \nimplement slum improvement activities in component C. Component D will also have a feasibility \nstudy to prepare phase 3 of the Project. The feasibility study will comprise two parts: part 1 for \nselecting  new  towns,  and  part  2  for  overall  feasibility  study  of  new  investments  including \nengineering, social, environmental, economic, and financial aspects. Incremental staffing costs \nand expenses are included in component D. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n29.  While  most  of  the  project  investments  will  be  directed  toward  the  construction  of \ninfrastructure  facilities  for  urban  flood  protection,  its  success  in  the  long  term  depends  on \nprogress that the project towns make in managing their municipal affairs. Recently, under the \nADB-assisted  Urban  Governance  and  Infrastructure  Improvement  Project  (UGIIP), 9  the \nGovernment introduced a participatory approach to assist urban local bodies to improve their \nmanagement and performance. Under the UGIIP, in exchange for receiving financial assistance \nfrom ADB, the participating municipalities entered into a formal agreement with the Government \nto implement the Urban Governance Improvement Action Program (UGIAP) in five key result \nareas: three for enhancing awareness and participation of local stakeholders in urban planning \nand management (citizen awareness and participation, women\u2019s participation, and integration of \nthe urban poor) and two for improving accountability and transparency in municipal administration \n(financial accountability and sustainability, and administrative transparency). Under these action \nareas, secondary towns are assisted with forming town-level citizen committees, developing \nparticipatory municipal development plans, strengthening the role of female ward commissioners, \nimplementing a slum improvement program, and operating community-level funds for income \ngeneration and infrastructure improvement.  The project towns will also implement a similar \nUGIAP with increased emphasis on urban environmental improvement that includes regular \ncleaning of municipal drainages by the community, organizing an awareness campaign for \nsanitation  and  solid  waste  management,  and  converting  all  latrines  into  sanitary  latrines. \nAdministrative  and  technical  support  for  effective  implementation  of  these  activities  will  be \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2002.

Cost Estimates \n \n30.  The total Project cost is estimated at $128.88 million equivalent. The foreign exchange \ncost is estimated at $9.13 million, or about 7.08% of the total cost, including $2.01 million for \ninterest charge. The local currency cost is estimated at $119.75 million equivalent, or about \n92.91% of the total cost, including duties and taxes of about $12.98 million.

Financing Plan \n \n31.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $80.0 million equivalent from its Special Funds \nresources to cover 62.1% of the total project cost, including $71.31 million equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years with a grace period of 8 years, and \nan interest rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund will provide a loan of $15.0 million \nto jointly finance 11.6% of the total project cost. The OPEC Fund loan will have a maturity of 20 \nyears with a grace period of 5 years, and an interest rate of 1.0% per annum and a service \ncharge of 1%. In the event that cofinancing from the OPEC Fund cannot be obtained within 6 \nmonths of the effective date, the Borrower will take all necessary and appropriate steps to make \nother  arrangements  to  cover  the  shortfall,  through  either  budget  allocations  or  other \narrangements acceptable to ADB. If such arrangements cannot be made, the Government and \nADB will agree on the components or activities under the Project to be scaled down. \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s financing of the local currency expenditure is justified by the nature of the Project, \nwhich will improve the living and health conditions of the people in the project areas by preventing \ndamage to property and disruption of lives caused by flooding. The proposed financing plan for \nthe Project is shown in Table 2.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n33.  Coordination at the Central Level. The Executing Agencies (EAs) of the Project will be \nBWDB under the Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR) and Local Government Engineering \nDepartment  (LGED)  under  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural  Development  and \nCooperatives  (MLGRDC)  with  BWDB  as  the  lead  EA.  An  interministerial  project  steering \ncommittee (IPSC) will be established at MOWR with members drawn from MLGRDC; Ministry of \nLand, Ministry of Environment and Forests; Economic Relations Division and Finance Division of \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance;  Implementation,  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Division  of  Ministry  of \nPlanning;  Planning  Commission  (Irrigation  and  Physical  Infrastructure  Division);  Ministry  of \nWomen  and  Children  Affairs;  BWDB;  LGED;  and  Department  of  Environment,  and  Water \nResources Planning Organization. Representatives from ADB, OPEC, and the project towns will \nparticipate in the IPSC meeting as observers. The MOWR Secretary will chair the meeting. The \nIPSC will first meet within 2 months from the date of loan effectiveness; thereafter it will meet at \nleast once a year to provide overall coordination and guidance, or whenever an urgent issue \nrequiring interministerial coordination arises.  \n \n34.  There will be two PMOs, one under  BWDB and another under LGED. For effective \ncoordination, however, the two PMOs will be set up in one location, mutually agreeable to the two \nEAs. BWDB will be responsible for executing of component A and LGED for components B \n(excluding natural drainage channels) and C through the respective local bodies. Component D \nwill be executed by both BWDB and LGED, with BWDB as lead agency.  The PMO of BWDB will \nbe headed by a superintending engineer while the PMO of LGED will be headed by a senior-level \nengineer. The two engineers will be full-time project directors (PDs) assisted by requisite human \nresources and consultants. The PMOs will (i) coordinate with other agencies concerned, (ii) \nprepare an overall implementation plan and annual budget, (iii) maintain financial accounts, (iv) \nprepare periodic reports, (v) assist the project towns in implementing of UGIAP, (vi) organize \nM&E activities, and (vii) implement gender action plan (GAP) and activities under the poverty \nreduction action plan (PRAP).  \n \n35.  The PMOs will be assisted by management, design and supervision (MDS) consultants \nduring the entire period of implementation. PD-BWDB will supervise the activities of consultants \nfor component A. The consultants for components B and C will work under the guidance and \nsupervision of the PD-LGED. For effective coordination, a project management team (PMT) \ncomprising the two PDs and, the team leader and the deputy team leader of the MDS consultants \nwill be formed. The PMT will prepare programs for all project components to keep linkages at \nleast between the works under components A and B and also monitor implementation of overall \nprogress. The PMT, convened by BWDB, will meet as frequently as required to discuss the ", "9 \nprogress of all activities and problems so that both PDs are fully informed of all aspects of the \nProject. \n \n36.  Coordination at the Town Level. A town-level project coordination committee will be \nformed within 3 months after loan effectiveness. The coordination committee for RCC will be \nheaded by the mayor of RCC and draw members from BWDB (executive engineer and sub-\ndivisional engineers); heads of engineering, revenue, health and conservation sections of RCC; \nadditional deputy commissioner (Land); the executive engineer of LGED; a representative of the \nregional UMSU; representatives from nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and community-\nbased organizations (CBOs); and chief executive officer as member secretary. The coordination \ncommittee for each of the eight other towns will be headed by the town's chairperson and include \nmembers from BWDB (executive engineers and subdivisional engineers); heads of engineering, \nhealth and revenue sections of the towns; additional deputy commissioner (Land); executive \nengineer of LGED; a representative of the regional  UMSU;  representatives  from  NGOs  and \nCBOs; and the chief executive officer as member secretary. The committee will provide overall \nguidance to the PIUs as required. Implementation arrangements are in Appendix 5.  \n \n37.  Implementation  of  the  Flood  Protection  Component.  Actual  implementation  of \ncomponent A and a small part of component B (natural drainage channels) will be undertaken by \nthe BWDB field divisions through an established chain of command of zonal chief engineers and \nsuperintending  engineers. The BWDB PIU for each town will be headed by the respective \nexecutive  engineer  with  subdivisional  engineers,  sectional  officers,  and  work  assistants  as \nmembers. The executive engineers will be responsible to the PD so far as the execution of the \nProject is concerned. No additional human resources are required for the BWDB PIUs except for \none computer operator. However, if there is a vacant position, BWDB need to fill the positions \nbefore  the  Project  starts.  The  BWDB  PIUs  will  also  implement  the  resettlement plans in \naccordance with the land acquisition and resettlement plan, and will coordinate closely with the \nmunicipal PIUs through the town-level project coordination committee. \n \n38.  Implementation of the Municipal Components. Actual implementation of components B \nand C will be carried out by the project towns under the technical supervision and guidance of the \nPMO-LGED. At a few sites, however, improvement of natural drainage channels outside the \nmunicipal  boundaries  will  be  undertaken  by  BWDB.  The  municipal  PIU,  located  within  the \nmunicipal office, will be responsible for the day-to-day implementation of the respective physical \nworks. LGED will coordinate centrally all the activities of the nine town PIUs through consultants \nand PMO staff. For close supervision of all physical works including environmental activities, the \nregional superintending engineer of LGED will be empowered to carry out regular supervision, \nmonitoring, and reporting on all project implementation activities to the PMO-LGED. The quality of \nconstruction materials will be ensured with the help of LGED\u2019s district laboratory (or other \nqualified institution). The PMO-LGED will be responsible for procuring vehicles and equipment \ncentrally for components B and C, and arrange the deputation of the necessary engineering staff \nto PIUs from either internal resources or new recruitment.  \n \n39.  Each municipal PIU will have three sections: (i) infrastructure improvement section (IIS), \n(ii) environmental sanitation and slum improvement Section (ESSIS), and (iii) urban governance \nimprovement section (UGIS). To be more specific, the engineering section (IIS) will undertake \ninfrastructure development (drainage) works, and ESSIS will implement all sanitation, solid waste \nmanagement, and slum improvement works. The UGIS will be responsible for implementing \nUGIAP. The PIUs will be headed by the town chairperson, assisted by the chief executive officer \nfor day-to-day operations of the Project. IIS will be led by the head of the engineering department \nof the concerned project town and ESSIS will be headed by the health officer. Additional technical \nstaff may be deputed from LGED to support the municipal engineer. UGIS will be headed by the ", "10 \ntown secretary. For RCC, the PIU will be headed by the chief executive officer and comprise \nthree section heads: chief engineer for IIS, chief health officer for ESSIS, and secretary for IIGIS.  \nEach PIU will also have an accounting section under the secretary to deal with procedural \naspects, record financial  transactions  and  prepare  liquidation  statements  and  replenishment \nrequests to the PMO. At the beginning of the Project, training in civil works, slum improvement, \nsanitation, and regular administrative responsibilities for the PIU staff will be organized.   \n \n40.  The PIUs will be responsible for (i) preparing an annual development program (ADP) and \nthe annual budget for the municipal components; (ii) tendering and awarding contracts; (iii) \nexecuting physical works; (iv) implementing the GAP, the PRAP, and the UGIAP; (v) preparing \nthe resettlement plan in accordance with the Project Resettlement Plan; and (vi) accounting for \nproject expenditures. \n  \n \n41.   Implementation of Slum Improvement.  The mechanism developed by UNDP for the \nLPUPA  program  will  be  adopted  in  the  Project.  The  approach  is  as  follows.  Community \norganization and empowerment start with the formation of primary groups of 20 families who then \nform community development committees (CDCs) representing 200-300 families. CDCs are \nformed into clusters of 6-12 CDCs and in each town CDC Federation is introduced. The project \nactivities are managed by a small central management team in Dhaka and a group of 8-10 staff \nbased in each town. The subcomponent has three parts, namely, (i) community development \nfund, (ii) poverty reduction fund, and (iii) community empowerment and strengthening of the \ncapability of the local governments. Most project activities are undertaken by the communities \nwith strong links to the respective local government bodies through their elected representatives \nand officials. The project staff plays mainly a facilitating role.  \n     \n \n42.  Implementation of UGIAP. The national UMSU in Dhaka has already been established \nand is at present headed by a full-time director at the level of superintending engineer. Three \ndeputy directors assist the director in managing the following sections, namely (i) governance \nprogram development, (ii) general administration and training coordination, and (iii) database \ndevelopment and performance evaluation and monitoring. Ten regional UMSUs have also been \nset up at the offices of the regional superintending engineers. Adequate human resources and \noperational budget have been provided for activities under the UGIAP. The national and seven \nregional UMSUs located at Comilla, Dhaka, Khulna, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet \nwill assist in implementing the UGIAP as adopted in the nine project towns (Appendix 6). \nAdditional human resources and financial resources will be required for UMSUs to cover the \nactivities of the Project. So additional staff and operating budget have been included for UGIAP \nimplementation.   \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n43.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 5 years beginning in April 2005. Physical \ncompletion is expected by June 2009 and loan closing date on 31 December 2009. Government\u2019s \nstart-up activities, such as preparing the project proformas, establishing PMOs, and recruiting \nconsultants should be completed in the first quarter of 2005. To take up physical work in the \nsecond  half  of  2005,  ADB  may  help  the  Government  with  advance  action  for  recruiting \nconsultants and procurement. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n44.  The Project will have two types of procurement, one for goods and the other for civil works \n(construction). Goods and services financed by ADB and the OPEC Fund will be procured in ", "11 \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Given the small individual contracts for civil \nworks in a scattered area and to be executed over 5 years, individual contracts are unlikely to \nattract  international  bidders.  So  all  the  civil  work  contracts  will  be  executed  by  domestic \ncontractors. Local contractors have the capacity to carry out the civil works. To ensure quality, the \nEAs will award civil works contracts to pre-qualified contractors following Government local \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  and  the  OPEC  Fund.  PIUs  under  the \nguidance  of  the  PMO  will  carry  out  procurement  for  civil  works  only.  To  expedite  project \nimplementation, advance action in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement will be \nundertaken  for  (i)  prequalifying  contractors,  and  (ii)  preparing  tender  documents.  The \nGovernment, BWDB, and LGED were advised that approval of advance action does not commit \nADB to finance the Project. \n \n45.  Efforts  will  be  made  to  limit  the  number  of  contract  packages  and  engage  larger \nprofessional contractors so as to shorten the construction period and ensure single accountability \nfor the quality of work. The contract packages for BWDB and RCC (components A and B) will \nhave a minimum value of Tk30 million. Contract packages for component B will have a minimum \nvalue of Tk3 million. The contract packages for component C may have a minimum value of Tk2 \nmillion for RCC and Tk1.5 million for the other towns. The MDS consultants will be involved in \npreparing all procurement packages and evaluating for contract awards of packages a valued at \nTk30 million and above for BWDB and RCC and Tk3 million for the project towns. \n \n46.  Procurement  packages  for  goods  are  unlikely  to  exceed  $500,000.  So  most  of  the \nprocurement will fall under ADB\u2019s international shopping procedures. Direct purchase procedures \nwill be used for small or off-the-shelf items valued at less than $100,000. The PMOs will procure \nequipment.  Advance  action  for  procurement  of  equipment  and  vehicles  will  be  required  to \nfacilitate the start-up of project implementation. Indicative procurement packages are in Appendix \n8. \n \n4.  Consulting Services and Implementation Assistance  \n47.  Consulting  services  and  implementation  assistance  in  the  field  will  facilitate  project \nimplementation and strengthen the institutional, administrative, and financial capacities of the \nproject towns. Consultants and field workers will be selected and engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  the  ADB  and  Its  Borrowers  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  In  total,  two  sets  of \nconsulting  services  will  be  provided  under  the  Project:  one  for  project  management  and \nengineering services, and the other for UGIAP preparation. Implementation assistance in the field \nwill be provided by the UGIAP facilitators and the field workers for the  slum improvement \nactivities.  An international consulting firm will be engaged for the MDS consultants to assist the \nPMO and PIUs. For the remaining three sets of assistance, domestic individual consultants will \nbe hired. The Project will require 64 person-months of international and 3,303 person-months of \ndomestic inputs (Appendix 9). \n \n48.  BWDB will recruit the MDS consultants and LGED will participate in evaluating them. The \nMDS consultants will be located in one place to have better coordination and interaction among \nthem and to allow the team leader and deputy team leader, to have effective control on their \nactivities. The MDS consultants will provide overall project management support; and arrange \nsubcontracts  for  field  engineering  surveys,  detailed  resettlement  surveys,  and  geotechnical \ninvestigations, including hydraulic modeling.  They will prepare detailed engineering designs, cost \nestimates, and tender documents. They will also regularly supervise, monitor progress and quality \nof works, and oversee resettlement actions. The team leader (in his absence, the deputy team \nleader) will have overall responsibility for the management of consulting services. ", "12 \n \n49.  For implementing of the UGIAP, LGED will recruit governance improvement consultants \nand UGIAP facilitators, as individual consultants through a competitive procedure acceptable to \nADB. The consultants will work closely with their counterparts at UMSU and the project towns. \nThey will prepare training programs, training materials, and modules to assist the project towns to \nachieve the targets under the UGIAP as adopted. Field workers for the slum improvement \nactivities will be engaged by LGED. \n \n5.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n50.  The land acquisition and other resettlement impacts of the Project will not be significant \ndespite the large number of affected persons (APs). According to the census undertaken during \nthe TA, 10,228 persons will be affected by the Project; 8,443 by the river protection works and \n1,785 by the drainage improvement works. These are mainly informal dwellers who do not have \nany land titles to the property that they currently occupy. These people will need to move \ntemporarily to allow construction to proceed, but they will stay close to the present locations and \nretain their existing sources of livelihood as well as social bonds. They will thus be saved from \ntotal disruption that is so common with relocation to distant locations.  \n \n51.  The temporary removal of APs, however, will trigger resettlement safeguards. All APs are \nentitled to compensation packages elaborated in the entitlement matrix of the resettlement plan \nsummary10 (Appendix 10). During socioeconomic surveys and a census of all potentially affected \ncommunities, APs expressed their willingness to self-relocate. The Project will assist them when \nthey relocate as stated in the resettlement plan. The plan was disclosed to all APs during \nstakeholder consultations and will be posted in BWDB, LGED and ADB web sites. The Project \nwill not have any  impacts on indigenous people since there are no indigenous people in the \nproject towns. \n \n6.  Solid Waste Management Activities \n52.  To  prevent  unhygienic  conditions  currently  faced  in  most  cities,  dustheaps  will  be \ndemolished and CBOs and NGOs will implement door-to-door collection of solid waste. New or \nimproved facilities for solid waste collection will be provided. Waste segregation will take place \nmostly at the collection stage. Garbage trucks will park at transfer stations on schedule, liaise with \nsolid waste collection facilities, and transport waste to solid waste dump sites with adequate \nenvironmental  controls  or  sanitary  landfill  sites.  These  sites  will  be  provided  with  suitable \nimpervious lining, and leachate collection will take place in purposely built, lined leachate ponds. \nLeachate tanks will be provided to allow for leachate decay before arranging for final safe \ndisposal. It is proposed that the entire solid waste management cycle (collection, transportation, \nsegregation,  reuse,  disposal,  and, where relevant, recycling) be operated through either (i) \npartnerships where the municipalities own the facilities and CBOs operate them, or (ii) micro \nenterprises where CBOs both own and operate solid waste management services. The issue will \nbe explored in the solid waste management plans to be formulated for each project town. Public \nawareness and capacity to operate such schemes will be provided by the UMSU. \n \n7.  Operation and Maintenance \n53.   Asset owners are responsible for providing adequate O&M funding and ensuring that \nmaintenance staff regularly inspect the infrastructure facilities, identify potential problems, and \nimplement remedial measures. Maintenance activities are generally divided into three types: \n                                                 \n10 A full land acquisition and resettlement plan is included in Supplementary Appendix B. ", "13 \nroutine or preventive maintenance, periodic maintenance, and emergency maintenance. BWDB is \nrequired to prepare field manuals for the three types for the flood protection works constructed \nunder the Project. For routine and periodic maintenance, BWDB may engage labor contracting \nsocieties, including poor women, for earthwork and tree planting activities on embankments. \nWhile BWDB is responsible for O&M of all flood protection infrastructure in the country, it has no \nauthority to impose any kind of surcharge, levy, or fee for maintenance of the flood protection \nsystem including natural drainage outside the municipal boundary. Instead BWDB receives O&M \nfunding from the Government of Bangladesh under the ADP, which is often inadequate even for \nroutine maintenance. In reality, O&M funding is not just a project-related issue but part of a much \nwider issue involving the capacity of the Government to meet the O&M requirement of all \nexternally aided and government-funded projects.  The Government and ADB will closely monitor \nthe level of O&M funding at both project and national levels and ensure a phasing -in of increased \nallocations to gradually meet actual requirements. In the medium term, the Government may \nconsider the option to allow BWDB to impose a levy or fee, or share the O&M costs for flood \ncontrol and drainage projects with the beneficiaries. In addition, if adequate O&M funding is \nunlikely to be realized in the sector, the review will prepare a modified model for O&M where the \nloan funds will be used for O&M with counterpart contribution from the Government. For this \npurpose, a comprehensive review of the status of O&M funding will be undertaken to make \nrecommendations to ADB and the Government under the proposed feasibility study for the next \nphase of investments.  \n \n54.  The project towns will be responsible for O&M of municipal works including the drainage \nsystem. Simple O&M manuals prepared under the earlier urban projects financed by ADB will be \nadopted for use by PIUs. These manuals, which describe the O&M procedures for municipal \ninfrastructure, services, and facilities, will be for the use of municipal engineering staff. The PMO \nconsultants will train all relevant staff of the project towns in O&M of infrastructure facilities. One \nof the tasks of the institutional strengthening consultants will be to define for each town the O&M \nrequirements and make a realistic assessment of the costs involved. The consultants will use the \nmanuals and on-the-job training to ensure that the staff in the project towns are made familiar \nwith the O&M responsibilities and requirements. The only way to secure an adequate budget for \nsustainable maintenance is to raise tax and nontax revenues of the towns. During phase 1 of the \nProject,  compliance  with  the  loan  covenants  on  improving  financial  performance  was  not \nsatisfactory.  The  proposed  action  plan  for  financial  management  improvement  was  poorly \nimplemented.  Considering these lessons, ADB and the Government agreed to resolve the \nchronic problem of poor financial performance by introducing institutionalized capacity building for \nbetter financial management under the UGIIP. At the same time, the national committee was \nformed to review policy-related issues for overall municipal management including barriers to \nmunicipal resource mobilization. Under the Project, the UGIAP requires the participating project \ntowns to set aside at least 20% equivalent of the ADP for O&M each year.  \n \n55.  In February 2004, the committee on urban local governments (CULG) was established \nwith assistance from ADB.11 It will, among others, review the existing holding tax system in the \ncountry to suggest reforms for improving the collection of the holding taxes. The committee will \nalso make recommendations for amending the 1977 Pourashava Ordinance to reflect the needs \nfor improved local governance and better urban management. The Project is expected to benefit \nfrom policy changes in these new initiatives. \n \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to Bangladesh for Supporting Urban Governance Reform. Manila. ", "14 \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n56.  Soon after loan effectiveness, four commercial bank accounts\u2014two  for each EA (for the \nADB and OPEC funds of each)\u2014will be established at designated commercial banks acceptable \nto ADB. The PDs will operate the accounts. The statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure will \nbe adopted to facilitate reimbursement and liquidation of small contracts. The imprest account \nand the SOE procedure will be established, maintained, and audited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook. The initial advance to the imprest account will be limited to 6 \nmonths of estimated ADB and OPEC-financed project expenditures, or 10% of each loan amount, \nwhichever is lower. The SOE procedure is applicable to individual payments below $50,000. \n \n57.  BWDB. BWDB has a very streamlined and well-defined disbursement procedure. There is \nno need to modify the procedure as it is working well. Regional accounting centers (RAC) were \ncreated and authorized to make payments to contractors after getting the bills from engineers. \nBills prepared by the sectional officers are further checked and initialed by the sub-divisional \nengineer. The executive engineer forwards the bills to the RAC for payment to the contractors \nafter the project consultants have certified the work for quality control and specifications. After \nreviewing the bills, the RAC makes payment to the contractor in three cheques (ADB, OPEC, and \nGovernment  contribution  separately)  or  may  make  one  payment  from  the  government \ncontribution and transfer the proportionate amount of funds on a periodic basis from the imprest \naccounts of the ADB and OPEC loans.       \n \n58.  RAC prepares the withdrawal application (W/A) for replenishment of fund following ADB\u2019s \nSOE  procedures  and  submits  the  same  to  the  PD  for  onward  transmission  to  ADB  for \ndisbursement.      \n \n59.  RCC. The present staff strength is not enough for making quick payments to contractors \nand claiming reimbursement from ADB. The Project has provided incremental human resources \nto strengthen capability. Bills are normally prepared by the sub-assistant engineer and submitted \nto assistant engineers for checking. The assistant engineers sign and submit the bill to the \nexecutive engineer. The executive engineer after obtaining certification on quality control from the \nconsultants, signs and forwards the bill to the chief engineer. The chief engineer submits the bill \nto the accounts section through chief executive officer. The accounts section prepares three \ncheques (ADB, OPEC, and Government contribution) and submits them to chief executive officer/ \nmayor for signature, or may make one payment from the Government contribution and transfer \nthe proportionate amount of funds on a periodic basis from the imprest accounts of the ADB and \nOPEC loans.       \n \n60.  After  payment,  the  accounts  section  prepares  W/A  based  on  SOE  procedures  and \nsubmits it for the chief engineer\u2019s signature. The chief executive officer forwards the W/A to PD of \nLGED for submission to ADB. \n \n \n61.  Project Towns. The chairperson of the project town exercises all power to administer the \nfunctions of the town. The sub-assistant engineer prepares a bill. The assistant engineer checks, \nsigns  and  forwards  the  bill  to  the  executive  engineer.  The  executive  engineer  obtains  the \ncertificate of quality control from the consultants, countersigns and forwards the bill and certificate \nto the accounts section. This section prepares three cheques (ADB, OPEC, and Government \ncontribution) for joint signature by the chief executive officer and the chairperson, or may make \none payment from the Government contribution and transfer the proportionate amount of funds \non a periodic basis from the imprest accounts of the ADB and OPEC loans.       \n ", "15 \n62.  The accounts section prepares the W/A based on SOE procedures and submits it to the \nexecutive engineer for countersignature. The chairperson forwards the W/A to PD/LGED for \nsubmission to ADB. \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n63.  With the assistance of an adequate number of suitably qualified accounting staff, including \na financial manager, the PMOs under BWDB and LGED will maintain separate accounts and \nrecords for all sources of funding and the project expenditures in accordance with generally \naccepted accounting principles. Consolidated project accounts and related financial statements \ncompiled by the PMOs separately will be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to \nADB.  The  annual  audit  will  cover  all  receipts  and  expenditures,  imprest  accounts,  SOE \nprocedures, and compliance with loan covenants. The audit report will include a separate audit \nopinion on the use of the imprest account and SOE procedures. The audited accounts, audit \nreport, and related financial statements will be submitted to ADB and the OPEC Fund within 9 \nmonths after the end of each fiscal year. BWDB, LGED, and the project towns are made aware of \nADB\u2019s policy on delayed submission, and the requirement for satisfactory and acceptable quality \nof audited accounts. \n \n64.  The PMOs will receive monthly and quarterly progress reports from all PIUs under their \njurisdiction. The PMOs will consolidate those reports into one report to be submitted to ADB and \nthe OPEC Fund within 1 month after the end of each quarter. The report will provide information \non progress made, problems encountered during the period and steps taken or proposed to be \ntaken to remedy the problems, and the proposed programs for the following quarter. The report \nwill particularly address progress in meeting the targets of the UGIAP. The PMOs will also submit \nM&E reports in years 2 and 4 of the Project. Finally, within 3 months of substantial physical \ncompletion of the Project, a project completion report will be prepared and submitted by the EAs \nin a format satisfactory to ADB. \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n65.  The performance evaluation and monitoring of the Project will be carried out under the \ndirection of the PMT and following ADB\u2019s guidelines for this purpose. With the assistance of the \nconsultants, BWDB and LGED will establish a management system to ensure that the facilities \nare managed efficiently and the expected benefits are maximized. M&E will determine the \neffectiveness of the integrated flood protection measures introduced under the Project and the \nimprovements on public health, environment, property values, and operational efficiencies that \nhave taken place.  \n \n66.  To ensure that project activities and facilities are managed efficiently and that benefits \nreach the target groups, an M&E program will be included the framework of ADB\u2019s project \nperformance monitoring system (PPMS). PPMS activities will be conducted periodically to gather \ninformation through multiple sources to determine whether the input deliveries for implementing \nprogram activities have rendered the expected benefits to the intended beneficiaries. The PPMS \nalso seeks to detect any deficiency and discrepancy between the plan and the execution of a \nprogram in using the resources efficiently so that timely corrections can be made to update the \nprogram and thus improve the benefits, outcomes, and impact. The indicators to be monitored will \nbe formulated and agreed upon with BWDB and LGED and will include indicators pertaining to \nboth physical progress and capacity building activities. The PMOs will conduct initial baseline \nphysical and socioeconomic surveys and submit a detailed implementation plan for monitoring \nperformance and for preparing benchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within 6 \nmonths  of  loan  effectiveness.  Thereafter,  PMOs  will  submit  annual  M&E  reports  to  ADB \nthroughout Project implementation. ", "16 \n11.  Project Review \n67.  ADB and the OPEC Fund will conduct detailed reviews of the Project at least twice a year. \nThe reviews will cover physical progress of project implementation; financial performance and \nstaffing of the project towns; implementation of UGIAP, PRAP, and GAP; progress on slum \nimprovement activities; and identification of problems and suggested solutions. A comprehensive \nmidterm review (MTR) will be conducted jointly by the Government, ADB and the OPEC Fund in \nyear 3. The MTR will evaluate project design, stakeholder participation, quality of works, social \nand environmental impacts, improvement on urban governance, effectiveness of implementation \narrangements and project management structures, attainment of the O&M budget for sustainable \nmaintenance, and future implementation plans for remaining work. If the assessment of MTR so \ndemands, the Government and ADB may consider modifying the scope and design of the Project \nand reallocating of funds among the loan categories including consultants\u2019 inputs. The MTR will \nfinalize the schedule of the proposed feasibility study for the new investments. BWDB and LGED \nwill submit detailed terms of reference of the study for ADB\u2019s review and approval during the \nMTR. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Major Benefits and Impacts \n \n1.  Social and Gender Aspects \n \n68.  Poverty incidence was as high as 40% of the sample households, where income is below \nthe poverty line of Tk44,410 per year ($65 per month). Households in hard core poverty survive \non incomes of less than Tk36,345 per year ($53 per month), concentrate in overcrowded slum \nand  squatter  areas,  and  lead  a  hand-to-mouth  existence.  Between  7%  and  30%  of  the \nhouseholds in hard core poverty are headed by women (Appendix 11). Focus group discussions \nstrongly underline the appeal of the poor for employment opportunities and decent wages; their \nemphasis is on the need to improve drainage for quicker clearance of rainwater and facilitation of \nnormal movement during flooding to mitigate the loss of workdays. Women are particularly \nconcerned about shelter for themselves and their animals, children\u2019s access to schools, as well \nas access to medicine and health care, especially during floods. Poverty reduction has been \nmade as a strategic objective of each Project component, with the view to maximize employment \nduring construction, develop skills for O&M, and make roads and basic services available in \ndeprived areas. In slums, improved access to water supply, sanitation, solid waste disposal, \nroads and footpaths, lighting, schools and health care will be assured. To this end each town will \nhave its own PRAP and GAP, which will be prepared with primary stakeholder participation, in \nresponse to expressed needs.12 \n \n2.  Economic and Financial Feasibility \n69.  The  economic  analysis  confirms  substantial  economic  benefits  from  the  project \ncomponents in all nine project towns. The main economic benefits include (i) flood damage \nmitigation for buildings and all types of property, (ii) mitigation of infrastructure damage, (iii) \nenhancement of land values, and (iv) enhancement of economic activities. While the Project will \nmainly address urban flood protection within municipal boundaries, proposed works will provide \nsignificant peripheral benefits to cultivated land outside the town boundaries. While improved \nsanitary conditions through solid waste management and installation of sanitary latrines will bring \nnumerous health benefits, these are not quantified. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \n                                                 \n12 Supplementary Appendix C gives the detailed Gender Action Plan. ", "17 \ncalculated for all project towns, ranges from 13.5% in Rajshahi to 44.6% in Jamalpur. The EIRR \nfor the Project as a whole is estimated at 22.8% (Appendix 12) The overall poverty impact ratio is \nestimated to be 48%. \n \n70.  The financial base of the project towns is weak, with per capita revenues averaging Tk413 \n($7.0) per year. Own-source revenues make up one half of total revenues, with the balance \nreceived as municipal grants from the Government. Since the project capital costs (drainage, \nsolid waste, sanitation, slum improvement) are financed by Government grants, the cost recovery \nstrategy under the Project is aimed at meeting the incremental O&M costs through increased \nrevenue mobilization, the success of which relies heavily on efficient property tax collection. \nBased  on  the  lessons  learned  from  phase  1,  institutionalized  training  will  be  provided  by \nimplementing  the  UGIAP  to  improve  financial  management  in  the  project  towns.  Proposed \nproperty tax reforms include raising the tax collection efficiency from the current average of 52% \nto 80% and above, and regularly updating property assessments (analysis of municipal finance is \nsummarized in Appendix 13).  \n \n3.  Environmental Aspects \n71.  The Project has been classified in environmental category B.  As part of the project \npreparatory  TA,  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were  carried  out  for  all  project \nsubcomponents. The IEEs showed that none of the proposed components would have significant \nadverse  environmental  impacts.  The  summary  IEE  is  in  Appendix  14.13 Anticipated  minor \nenvironmental  impacts  include  generation  of  dust  and  air  pollution  due  to  demolition  and \nexcavation  activities,  and  increased  vibrations  and  noise  during  construction;  increases  in \nexhaust fumes and traffic during construction activities and transport of solid waste to dump sites; \nand hygiene and sanitation problems arising from inappropriate O&M of latrines and solid waste \ndump sites.   \n \n72.  Environmental benefits resulting from the Project include improved hygiene and sanitary \nconditions and improved waste handling, treatment and disposal. To guide these activities, a solid \nwaste management plan and a sanitation management plan will be formulated before loan \neffectiveness. The two plans will include public awareness as well as models for operationalizing \nand maintaining latrines and solid waste management facilities, including sanitary landfill sites \nand composting facilities. The riverbank will have significant positive impacts by protecting the \nproductive agricultural and homestead land from progressive river erosion.  \n \nB.  Major Risks \n73.  While no unusual risk is foreseen during implementation, the potential risks concern (i) \nimplementation delays due to slow progress with start-up activities (such as engagement of \nconsultants and completion of administrative changes required for launching regional training \ncenters), (ii) lack of suitably qualified personnel in the project towns that may eventually lead to \nweak implementation of the subproject at the town level, (iii) inadequate coordination between \nBWDB and LGED, (iv) unavailability of the OPEC Fund cofinancing, and (v) sustainability of the \nfacilities and services provided under the Project. \n \n74.  First, implementation delay can largely be prevented by timely mobilization of consultants. \nAdvance action is required to ensure that the implementation schedule can be adhered to. \nSecond, the Government will ensure that qualified staff in the PIU are nominated and provided \nwith advance training before loan effectiveness. Third, the two PMOs will be set up and placed in \n                                                 \n13 A sample IEE is in Supplementary Appendix D. ", "18 \none location under the joint leadership of the PMT for effective coordination. Fourth, in the event \nthat the OPEC Fund loan does not materialize for any reason after effectiveness of the ADB loan, \nthe scope of the Project may be reduced in accordance with the available resources. Scaling \ndown the components and activities of the Project is technically and financially feasible and \ndiscussed with the Government. \n \n75.  Finally, the sustainability of the project investments will depend primarily on the ability of \nBWDB and the project towns to generate sufficient revenues for O&M. The following measures \nare adopted to minimize the O&M risk: (i) raise engineering standards, specifying the higher \nquality, and more robust civil works options; (ii) strengthen local governments to improve financial \nmanagement and revenue generation performance; and (iii) firm up central Government O&M \ncommitments in line with a strategy prepared with project support. Additional measures will also \nbe considered during project implementation: (i) provide incentives for better O&M performance; \nand (ii) prepare a modified O&M model for using loan funds to partially finance O&M recurrent \ncosts,  on  a  diminishing  contribution  basis.    The  Project's  O&M  risk  profile  will  be  closely \nmonitored and will guide the preparation of the next phase of the urban flood protection works \nassisted by ADB. \n  \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n76.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, each project town will have entered into a \nformal agreement with LGED for the effective implementation of the UGIAP for that \ntown. The Government will ensure implementation of the UGIAPs in accordance \nwith  the  set  time  frames.  The  formal  agreement  with  LGED  for  UGIAP \nimplementation is a condition for awarding civil work contracts for the project \ntowns. \n(ii)  The Government will cause BWDB and LGED to adopt the GAP and PRAP and \nwill ensure their full implementation throughout the project period. To this end, the \nGovernment will require the PMOs to prepare field manuals for the GAP and \nPRAP and conduct training for the PMO and PIU staff. Implementation of the GAP \nand PRAP will be closely monitored and progress will be described in the quarterly \nreports to ADB.   \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that, each year before calling tenders for any new \nconstruction, the work plans and preliminary designs will be presented to the \nbeneficiaries at a town meeting organized by the town chairperson (or mayor of \nRCC).  At  these  meetings,  the  proposed  works  will  be  presented  to  the \nbeneficiaries in a manner that ensures they gain a full understanding of the \nproposed  works.  The  presentations  will  actively  involve  suitable  engineering \nproject personnel from BWDB and LGED (depending on the work component \ninvolved) and the towns (or RCC), as well as the MDS consultant. Approval in \nprinciple for the works to proceed must be sought. \n(iv)  BWDB and the project towns will complete detailed surveys and prepare detailed \nland acquisition plans each year for the works to be undertaken during the coming \nfiscal year and submit them to the deputy commissioner of the respective towns at \nthe latest 3 months before the working season so as to complete all formalities as \nwell as physical land possession before the working season begins.  ", "19 \n(v)  The Government will ensure that all people affected by land acquisition will be \ncompensated before possession of land and assets, on the basis of replacement \ncost and in a manner satisfactory to ADB. If involuntary resettlement, land, or \nasset acquisition is required, a resettlement plan will be prepared in accordance \nwith the Project Resettlement Plan. \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that all environmental mitigating measures identified \nin the IEE and agreed upon with ADB will be incorporated into the project design \nand  implemented  during  construction  and  O&M,  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s environmental laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003).  \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that civil works contractors comply with all applicable \nlabor laws, do not employ child labor for construction and maintenance activities, \nand  provide  appropriate  facilities  for  children  in  construction  campsites.  The \nGovernment will set employment targets in road construction and maintenance \nand other infrastructure construction activities for poor and vulnerable people, \nparticularly women, and require contractors not to differentiate wages for men and \nwomen for work of equal value. A specific clause will be included in bidding \ndocuments,  and  compliance  will  be  strictly  monitored  during  project \nimplementation. \n(viii)  BWDB will ensure that all vacant positions in its field divisions will be filled by \nqualified personnel within 1 month of loan effectiveness and that all positions will \nremain filled for the duration of the Project. \n(ix)  The Government will ensure that all counterpart funding required for the Project in \naccordance with the financing plan, including the cost of land acquisition, cost of \nother resettlement compensation, implementation and monitoring activities under \nthe land acquisition and resettlement plans, and general project management \nexpenses, will be fully provided through the approved annual development plan \nallocations. \n(x)  The Government will take all necessary and appropriate measures to ensure \nadequate O&M funding and implementation. This will involve BWDB preparing \nfield  manuals  for  flood  protection  works,  adopting  existing  field  manuals  for \nmunicipal works as well as strictly implementing O&M provisions in the UGIAP. By \nDecember 2008, the Government will have reviewed the O&M funding for BWDB \nworks and will have made recommendations. \n(xi)  In the event that cofinancing by the OPEC Fund cannot be obtained within 6 \nmonths  of  the  effective  date,  the  Government  will  take  all  necessary  and \nappropriate steps to make other arrangements to cover the shortfall, through either \nbudget  allocations  or  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB.  If  such \narrangements  cannot  be  made,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  agree  on  the \ncomponents or activities to be scaled down. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n77.  The following are the conditions for loan effectiveness: \n \n(i)  The project proformas, consistent with the Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident (RRP) and loan agreement, will have been approved by the Government.  \n(ii)  The PMOs will have been established and staff nominated. \n(iii)  A detailed program for UGIAP implementation in each of the nine towns will have \nbeen submitted by UMSU of LGED for ADB\u2019s review and approval. \n(iv)  A solid waste management plan and a sanitation management plan will have been \ndeveloped under the Project. ", "20 \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n78.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB \nand, acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of \nAgreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 54,321,000 to the \nPeople's  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Secondary  Towns  Integrated  Flood \nProtection Project Phase 2 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest \ncharge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreement presented to the Board; and  \n \n(ii)  the administration by ADB of a loan not exceeding the equivalent of $15,000,000 to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Secondary Towns Integrated Flood \nProtection Project Phase 2 to be provided by the OPEC Fund under the terms of a \nLetter of Administration to be entered into between ADB and the OPEC Fund. \n \n \n \nJoseph B.

Institutional Development \n \n1.  After the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the provincial Irrigation Directorate was in charge \nof the development of water resources and flood control facilities. Following the devastating \nfloods of 1954 and 1955, a United Nation (UN) mission\u2014the Krug Mission\u2014 recommended the \ncreation of the East Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (EPWAPDA). This was \nestablished  in  1959  with  two  wings:  Water  Wing  and  Power  Wing.  The  Water  Wing  was \nrestructured in 1972 as Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) and its mandate limited \nto water resources development. BWDB was reconstituted in July 2000 under a new Act that \nrepositions the organization and aligns its responsibilities to those set out in the National Water \nPolicy (NWP).   \n \nB.  Milestone Events in the Water Sector \n \n2.  The Water Wing of EPWAPDA prepared a master plan envisaging 58 massive flood \ncontrol  and  drainage  (FCD)  projects  and  three  barrages  on  three  major  rivers.  Projects \nimplemented by EPWAPDA covered mainly the engineering aspects to help boost agricultural \nproduction to meet the country\u2019s demand. It was claimed that the master plan ignored the needs \nof nonagricultural water-using sectors. A World Bank study in 1972 suggested a major shift in \nstrategy from massive FCD projects to minor irrigation complemented by agricultural input supply \nand support services. The World Bank Mission recommended a review of BWDB activities and \nstressed the creation of a planning body outside BWDB to prepare a NWP that emphasizes on \nmaximizing agricultural growth and production for food grain self-sufficiency. The NWP that was \nprepared put heavy reliance on minor irrigation through massive fielding of tube wells and low-lift \npumps utilizing available surface water from rivers and other water resources. \n \n3.  The country experienced two consecutive massive floods in 1987 and 1988, which \nprompted the government to undertake immediate rehabilitation works, and in parallel a few joint \nstudies.  Later  a  flood  action  plan  (FAP)  consisting  of  26  studies  and  pilot  projects  was \nundertaken with the support  of various sources. The major achievement of the FAP was the \npreparation of five regional studies and three important guidelines for: (i) project assessment, (ii) \npeople\u2019s participation, and (iii) environmental impact assessment. At the conclusion of the FAP \nstudies the Bangladesh flood and management strategy was produced as the final report of the \nFAP. The report outlined a strategic framework for developing and implementing a national water \nmanagement system and formulating a NWP and national water management plan (NWMP). It is \nworth mentioning that the NWP was prepared and approved by the Government in 1999, while \nthe NWMP was approved by the Government on 31 March 2004. The Secondary Towns \nIntegrated Flood Protection Project-II (STIFPP-II) is being formulated under the umbrella of the \nFAP. The NWMP provides the overall approach to and program for future urban flood protection, \nbut actual formulation of the investment plans will be the responsibility of the end users. \n \n4.  The FAP was instrumental in bringing a paradigm shift in water planning methodology, \nputting emphasis on equal rights of all water users and mandatory use of environment impact \nassessment (EIA) and guidelines for people's participation at all stages of the project cycle \n(planning, design, implementation, and operation and maintenance). In line with the above \npolicies and with the changing demand, the role of BWDB has been redefined and a new \nmanagement structure is in place through reforms and downsizing of its manpower. \n \n ", "   \n 26   Appendix 2   \n \nC.  Key Issues \n \n5.  Bangladesh is making good progress in establishing an up-to-date and comprehensive \nlegal,  policy,  planning,  institutional  framework  for  the  water  sector.  Some  elements  of  the \nframework are NWP, MWMP, and reforms in the key institutions responsible for water resources \nmanagement. A milestone in formulating policy and planning for the sector was the adoption of \nthe  NWP  in  1999,  a  step  further  toward  good  governance.  The  NWP  also  defined  major \ninstitutional reforms, and the role of the government, the private sector, and civil society in water \nmanagement. The NWP has called for accelerating the development of sustainable public and \nprivate water delivery systems with appropriate legal and financial measures and incentives \nincluding  formulation  of  water  rights  and  water  pricing.  The  NWP  has  also  called  for \ndecentralization of water management. A scheme of up to 1,000 ha command area is to be given \nto the local government to plan, execute, and operate. \n \n6.  As dictated by the NWP, the government revised the earlier guidelines for people\u2019s \nparticipation and replaced it with Guidelines for Participatory Water Management. The guidelines \nincorporate the mechanism for establishing and operationalizing beneficiary organizations like \nwater user associations and linking with state institutions. In line with the NWP, the NWMP was \napproved by the Government on 31 March 2004. Even before approval, the salient features of \nthe NWMP were incorporated in the Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.  \n \n7.  The institutional reforms currently on the agenda are based on the NWP. Key BWDB \nreforms include redefining of BWDB\u2019s role in the sector, changing BWDB's management to make \nit fully autonomous with an independent governing council, separating management from the \ngoverning council, and reducing the permanent staff from 18,000 to 8,860 by June 2007. Overall \nprogress in reforming BWDB has been substantial. Given the accomplishment of the past years, \nit is possible that most of the actions associated with the reform process will have been \naddressed by 2007. The BWDB Act has mandated participatory management of projects. The \nobjective is to promote a sense of ownership among beneficiaries and their willingness to share \nthe cost of maintenance that would eventually relieve BWDB of the O&M burden. Progress is \nslow on this. \n \n8.  River training and bank protection works by BWDB have been found very costly, but they \nhave been the only effective means of combating river erosion. Erosion control schemes show \nthat they involve high maintenance expenditure, but they can provide protection. There is a need \nfor contingency planning to cope with failure, and beneficiary participation in erosion control \nprograms has proved extremely useful. \n ", "   \nAppendix 3  27 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO FLOOD PROTECTION IN BANGLADESH \n(1990 onward) \n \nProject/ Technical Assistance  Agency  Currency  Amount  Year  Loan/ \n(million)  Committed  Grant \nNortheast Regional Study (FAP 6) and pilot  Canada  Canadian dollar  17.00  1991  Grant \nworks \nFlood Action Plan (FAP 25)  Denmark  Denmark krone/  13.300  1993  Grant \nMeghna Estuary Study (FAP 5B)  Denmark  US Dollar  5.300  1994  Grant \nBank Protection and River Training (FAP 21/22)  France  France  93.000  4992  Grant \nCompartmentalization Pilot Project (FAP 20)  Germany  Deutsche mark  13.500  1992  Grant \nBank Protection and River Training (FAP 21/22)   Germany  44.400  1992  Grant \nNarayanganj Narsingdi FCDI III Study  Japan  Yen  339.000  1998  Grant \nCompartmentalization Pilot Project (FAP 20)  Netherlands  Guilder  13.410  1991  Grant \nTA Flood Action Plan (FAP 25)  Netherlands  Guilder  0.065  1992  Grant \nSmall-Scale Water Resources Development  Netherlands  Guilder  12.000  1996  Grant \nSecond Small-Scale Water Resources  Netherlands  Guilder  64.385  2001  Grant \nDevelopment \nFlood Action Plan (FAP 12)  UK  Pound sterling  0.850  1990  Grant \nFlood Action Plan (FAP 2)  UK  Pound sterling  1.403  1990  Grant \nFlood Action Plan-Related Activities  USA  US dollar  4.199  1991  Grant \nSecond Pabna Irrigation and Rural Development  ADB  US dollar  0.250  1990  Grant \nSecond Bhola Irrigation  ADB  US dollar  0.250  1990  Grant \nDhaka Integrated Flood Protection Project  ADB  US dollar  0.250  1990  Grant \nDhaka Integrated Flood Protection Project  ADB  US dollar  91.500  1991  Loan \nSecondary Towns Integrated Flood Protection I  ADB  US dollar  0.600  1992  Grant \nSecondary Towns Integrated Flood Protection I  ADB  US dollar  55.000  1992  Loan \nSecond Bhola Irrigation  ADB  US dollar  39.800  1992  Loan \nSmall-Scale Water Resources Development  ADB  US dollar  0.500  1992  Grant \nSmall-Scale Water Resources Development  ADB  US dollar  32.000  1995  Loan \nCommand area Development Project  ADB  US dollar  0.441  1992  Grant \nCommand area Development Project  ADB  US dollar  30.000  1995  Loan \nSecond Small-Scale Water Resources  ADB  US dollar  0.500  1999  Grant \nDevelopment    US dollar  34.000  2001  Loan \nSecond Small-Scale Water Resources  ADB  US dollar  0.900  2002  Grant \nDevelopment   \nSecondary Towns Integrated Flood Protection II  ADB \nGumti Project Phase 1 (FCD 1)  World Bank(IDA)  US dollar  23.000  1991  Loan \nNaogaon polder 1 (FCD 3)  World Bank(IDA)  US dollar  21.000  1991  Loan \nMadhumati-Nabaganga project (FCD 4)  World Bank(IDA)  US dollar  11.000  1992  Loan \nRiverbank Protection  World Bank(IDA)  US dollar  121.900  1996  Loan \nRiverbank Protection (Supplementary)  World Bank(IDA)  US dollar  45.000  1999  Loan \nSmall-Scale Water Resources Development  IFAD  US dollar  10.400  1995  Loan \nNorth Central Regional Study (FAP 3)  EU  Ecu  12.600  1990  Grant \nJamuna-Daleshwari Left Bank Studies  EU  Ecu  4.000  1993  Grant \nFlood Action Plan   UNDP  US dollar  0.688  1990  Grant \nDhaka Integrated Flood Protection Project  Finland  US dollar  0.350  1990  Grant \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EU = European Union, FAP = Flood Action Plan, FCDI = flood control, drainage and \nirrigation, IDA = International Development Association, IFAD = International Fund for Agricultural Development, TA = \ntechnical assistance, UK = United Kingdom, UNDP = United Nations Development Programme, USA = United States of \nAmerica.    \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.

This resettlement plan has been prepared in accordance with the Asian Development \nBank (ADB)  Policy on Involuntary Resettlement  (1995), ADB's  Handbook on Resettlement \n(1998), and ADB's Operations Manual Bank Policies (Involuntary Resettlement) issued on 29 \nOctober 2003. The plan is divided into two parts. Part 1 presents the overall Secondary Towns \nIntegrated flood Protection Phase II (STIFPP II) project resettlement plan, focusing on policy \nissues and Part 2 includes the project towns resettlement plans. The policy framework of the \noverall STIFPP II resettlement plan is to guide implementation of the town-specific resettlement \nplans. \n  \nA.  The Project \n \n2.  With over 200 river systems across the country and about 40%of its inland area under \nwaterways, Bangladesh has a long history of flooding. The heavy rainfall during the monsoon \nmonths  makes  things  worse.  Flooding  in  the  urban  areas  has  become  particularly  acute \nbecause of high population densities, concentration of industrial and commercial activities, and \ninadequate drainage facilities. This problem affects mostly the urban poor, who generally live in \nslums and squatter areas, mainly on low-lying land that is flooded annually. Disastrous floods \nthat cause extensive damage to the economy and loss of human lives highlight the enormity \nand urgency of the problem and have aroused much international concern.  \n   \n3.  The goal of the ADB -financed project preparatory TA1 was to provide people of selected \nproject towns with a relatively flood-free and secure living environment within the broader \nstrategic framework of poverty reduction. The nine towns in the Project are: Brahmanbaria, \nGaibandha, Jamalpur, Kushtia, Manikganj, Munshiganj Mymensingh, Rajshahi, and Sunamganj. \nThe  Project  has  four  major  components:  (i)  flood  protection  works;  (ii)  drainage  system \nimprovement;  (iii)  urban  environmental  improvement  including  solid  waste  management, \nsanitation, and slum improvement; and (iv) capacity building  and implementation assistance, \nincluding consulting services and training. \n \n4.  Despite its essentially beneficial aspects, some activities of the Project are likely to have \nadverse socioeconomic consequences for people in the project area. Some may lose either \nwholly or partially their houses, lands, businesses, and other sources of making a living, and be \nforced to relocate. The Project is, however, unlikely to trigger relocation on any large scale. \nEven those who will need to move temporarily to allow the construction activity to proceed will \nbe close to their present locations, retaining their existing sources of livelihood as well as social \nbonds, and will thus be saved from total disruption that is so common in relocation to distant \nlocations.  \n \nB.  Impacts and the Affected People \n \n5.  A census of all potentially affected households, business enterprises, community assets, \nand common property resources was conducted. The purpose was to register and document \nthe status of all potentially affected households, their assets, and sources of livelihood. The \ncensus data will provide the basis for determining who may be entitled to compensation, \nassistance,  and  other  benefits.  In  addition,  a  socioeconomic  survey,  of  20%  households, \nselected on a random basis was conducted. The two surveys together yielded a wealth of \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2002.

The census, revealed that will affect Project 10,128 persons, with flood protection works \naffecting  8,443  persons,  and  drainage  system  improvement  works  accounting  for  1,785 \npersons. These figures do not include the number of people who might be affected by urban \nslum environmental improvement works. At this stage, it is not possible to identify the possible \nimpacts  from  this  component,  as  decisions  about  the  exact  location  of  urban  slum \nenvironmental improvement works have not yet been taken up.  \n \nC.  Policy Guidelines and Entitlements \n \n7.  While  there  is  general  support  for  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement,  the \nBangladesh  legal  system  on  mitigating  of  the  loss  of  land  and  other  assets  focuses  on \ncompensating only titleholders. There is no compensation for affected people who lack legal \ntitles. In recent years, however, Bangladesh has adopted for ADB-funded and other aid projects \non an ad hoc basis, resettlement policy guidelines that are largely consistent with ADB's \nresettlement policy. Considering this precedent and the legal and policy requirements of the \nGovernment and ADB, a set of compensation principles has been adopted to guide resettlement \noperations in this Project.  \n \n8.  The project policy is designed to compensate lost assets and restore or improve the \nlivelihood of all categories of affected persons, whether affected directly, indirectly, with titles, or \nwithout titles. The affected people will be eligible to receive cash compensation for land and \nother assets at replacement value, if not replacement land. Additionally, they will receive \nassistance  in  other  forms,  including  shifting  allowance,  assistance  for  small  business \nenterprises  to  reestablish  businesses,  income  restoration  allowance,  and  assistance  to \nhouseholds headed by females. The entitlement matrix (see table) summarizes the entitlements \nfor losses of all kinds to all affected persons and lists persons eligible to receive those benefits.    \n \nTable A10.1: Entitlement Matrix \n No  Nature of Loss  Entitled Persons  Entitlements \n(Compensation and/or Assistance) \n1  Loss of agricultural  Legal owner(s) of the land  Replacement land, or cash compensation  \nland or fishpond  Premium (50%) \nAdditional grant to cover replacement cost \nStamp duty and registration fees for land to be \npurchased \n2  Loss of access to  Tenants and  Compensation for crops at Tk200/decimal (1% of \ncultivable agricultural  sharecroppers under  an acre)  \nland or fishpond by  contract  Compensation for fish at Tk300/ decimal \ntenant or sharecropper \n \n3  Loss trees or  Legal owner(s) of the land  Compensation at the replacement value for trees \nstanding crops or  Additional grant to cover replacement  value  \nfishes  Compensation for fruits for fruit-bearing trees at \n30% of tree value \nAffected persons allowed to take away trees and \ncrops \n4  Loss of homestead or  Legal owner(s) of the land  Replacement land, or cash compensation  \nbusiness  Premium (50%) \n(commercial) land  Additional grant to cover replacement cost \nStamp duty and registration fees for land to be   \npurchased \n5  Loss of residential or  Legal owner(s) of the  Cash compensation for structure at replacement \nbusiness structure by  structure  value \nowner  Additional grant to cover replacement value  \n ", "  38  Appendix 10 \n No  Nature of Loss  Entitled Persons  Entitlements \n(Compensation and/or Assistance) \nOne-time grant of TK5,000 to transfer structure to \nnew location, and reconstruction grant of Tk2500    \nOwner allowed to take salvageable material \nAdditional assistance for households with female \nheads \n \n  6  Loss of access to  Tenants renting or leasing  One-time cash grant of Tk5,000 to transfer  \nresidential or  the structure  structure to new location, and reconstruction    \nbusiness structure  grant of Tk2,500 \n(rented or leased) \n \n7  Loss of residential  Head of household  Compensation for lost structure to owner at \nstructure by squatter  squatting on government  replacement value \nland   One-time shifting grant of Tk5,000 and \nreconstruction grant of Tk2,500 \n8  Loss of business due  Owner/operator of  Business restoration grant of Tk8,000 to large and \nto dislocation  business  Tk5,000 to small owner   \nBusiness restoration grant of Tk8,000 for large and \nTk5,000 for small renter or squatter \n9  Loss of income,  Workers of affected  One-time cash grant of Tk3,000 per wage loser \nemployment or work  businesses  Additional Tk1,000 for households with female \nopportunity full-time  heads \nor part-time   \n \n10  Loss of community  Community at relocation  Reconstruction or improvement of \nfacilities or common  site  community facilities or common  property resource \nproperty resources   Compensation at replacement value for structures \nTransfer grant of Tk5,000 \nReconstruction grant of Tk2,500 \n11  Loss to host  Host village or area  Provision of additional civic  \ncommunity   amenities \n \nD.  Consultative Approach and Grievance Redress   \n \n9.  People taking part in decisions that directly affect their lives develop a sense of local \nownership and cooperate in the program. In fact, the Project regards participation as critical to \nthe success of its efforts and will utilize a participatory approach to planning and implementing \nof resettlement. The resettlement plan was prepared in consultation with all the stakeholders, \nespecially the affected people, and has thus greatly benefited from the local knowledge. The \nplan will be implemented in a similar consultative manner. \n \n10.  Generally, people see the Project in a positive light, thanks to the emphasis on the \nconsultative approach adopted right from the beginning. They think they have good reasons to \nwelcome the initiative that will save them from floods and the latter's devastating impacts. With \nthe flood menace gone, they hope to enjoy a better standard of living in a relatively safer \nenvironment. People also expect better civic amenities planned under the slum environmental \nimprovement  component  to  further  improve  their  living  conditions.  Other  stakeholders \nsupportive  of  the  Project  are  all  the  secondary  towns,  the  Rajshahi  City  Corporation, \ngovernment officials, and local women\u2019s groups (as they are the ones who bear the brunt of the \nfloods' fury most of all). \n \n11.  The  Project  will  establish  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  deal  with  cases  of \ndiscontent  among  affected  persons  or  groups.  The  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs) \nimplementing the resettlement plan will set up a broad-based grievance redress committee with \nrepresentation of affected people including women in adequate number. The committee will \nmeet regularly and maintain a complete record of the meetings, grievances solved, etc. will ", "  Ap pendix 10  39 \nensure that grievances are solved as speedily as possible. Grievances relating to land titles are  \noutside the purview of this committee, and persons with such grievances will be advised to \napproach the appropriate law courts for their resolution. \n \nE.  Plan Implementation \n   \n12.   The Project will be jointly implemented by the two Executing Agencies. Bangladesh \nWater Development Board (BWDB), and Local Government Engineering Department (LGED). \nThe flood protection component will be the responsibility of BWDB and, the drainage system \nimprovement and urban environmental improvement components will be executed by LGED \nthrough the project towns under its overall technical guidance. Project management offices \n(PMOs) will be set up in both BWDB and LGED. The PMOs, headed by project directors, will be \nresponsible  for  overall  management  of  the  Project,  including  land  acquisition,  relocation, \nresettlement, and related matters. BWDB and LGED will contract NGOs to implement the \nresettlement plans, and also add resettlement specialists to their staff. project implementation \nunits (PIUs) will be established in each project town. \n \n13.  An interministerial project steering committee at the central level will be established for \noperational coordination and for policy guidance. It will be chaired by the secretary of the \nMinistry of Water Resources. Similarly, in each project town, a project coordination committee \nunder the chairmanship of the mayor will be established. The members of this committee will be \nthe local officials of BWDB, LGED, and other concerned town agencies.  \n \n14.  A time-bound implementation schedule has been prepared. Resettlement activities will \nbe completed within the preparatory stage of engineering construction and before the relevant \ncivil engineering works begin.  \n \nF.  Budget \n \n15.  The total estimated budget cost, inclusive of costs related to land acquisition, relocation, \nresettlement, income restoration,  administrative costs, monitoring and evaluation, comes to     \nTk478,490,434 ($8,110,007.36). The estimates will vary from town to town, depending on the \nnumber of affected persons and their entitlements. The Government of Bangladesh will meet \nthe entire cost of land acquisition and resettlement. The Government will further guarantee \nmeeting unforeseen obligations in excess of the budget cost estimates to ensure that the \nresettlement objectives are fully met.  \n \nG.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n16.  The project director assisted by resettlement specialists and the NGO field staff will be \nresponsible for monitoring the progress of resettlement activities at both project and field levels. \nMonitoring  will  cover  the  administrative  and  socioeconomic  aspects  of  the  resettlement \noperation. In addition to quantitative monitoring, qualitative monitoring will be conducted, using \ninterviews with key informants, focus group discussions and other social science research \nmethods.  \n \n17.  Monitoring will be done both internally and externally. BWDB and LGED will internally \nmonitor the progress of resettlement done and will employ an external resettlement agency or \nspecialist on an intermittent basis to provide an independent and objective perspective on all \nmatters pertaining to implementation of the resettlement plan. \n \n \n \n ", "40   Appendix 11 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY (SPRSS)  \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nDespite the high incidence of natural disasters and many adverse conditions, Bangladesh has achieved considerable \nprogress over the years in reducing both income and human poverty. Absolute poverty dropped from 58.7% in 1991 to \n49.8% of the population in 2000.1 The declining trend is valid for both rural and urban poverty, the latter having fallen \nfrom 44.9% (1991) to 36.6% (2000). Whereas progress in reducing the head count index of poverty was better in the \nurban areas, rural areas fared better in reducing the severity of poverty as captured by trends in poverty gap and \nsquared poverty gap. The uneven reduction in urban poverty is explained by the greater urban income inequality, as \nthe Gini coefficient increased by 2.3% per year, from 0.307 to 0.368 over the period.  \n \nThe principal reason behind this phenomenon is the steady migration of the resource poor from rural to urban areas in \nsearch of employment and better economic opportunities. Migration inflates the annual growth rate of the urban \npopulation and triggers the sprouting shanty settlements along the towns\u2019 river embankments or in surrounding low-\nlying areas. In some towns considered under Secondary Towns Integrated Flood Protection Phase II (STIFPP-II), \nsuch settlements represent more than 25% of the population. The towns are prone to flooding and river erosion, and \nthe poorer income groups, especially recently settled women dwellers, are very vulnerable to disaster. Lack of flood \nprotection  and  inadequate  drainage  lead  to  waterlogging  and  overflowing  of  sewers,  causing  widespread \nenvironmental degradation and deplorable unsanitary living conditions, particularly in slums and squatter areas.   \n \nUrban development is important in reducing the vulnerability of the urban poor and contributes to a safer, less morbid \nliving environment for them throughout the year. The provision of flood protection infrastructure, drainage, slum \nimprovement, and capacity assistance for improving urban governance will enable the poorer groups, men and \nwomen, to benefit directly from employment created in construction and operation and maintenance (O&M), and from \nadditional social programming around microcredit, income generation, and environmental improvement, all of which \nare indispensable to reduce poverty. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has already lent well over $300 million for \nsix urban infrastructure projects since it began its operation in Bangladesh in the late 1980s. The proposed \nintervention will significantly enhance the gains made so far in urban infrastructure and governance and in reducing \npoverty in the secondary towns of Bangladesh. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nA socioeconomic baseline survey was conducted through questionnaires, focus group discussions, and secondary \ndata analysis. Each town was the subject of (i) an in-depth analysis of the incidence of poverty; and (ii) extensive \nconsultation on people\u2019s perceptions, priority needs, and demands regarding flood protection and drainage, basic \nservices, and poverty reduction. Participatory urban appraisal through focus group discussions and stakeholder \nconsultation was undertaken. The survey presents a complete profile of the demographic situation and basic services \navailable in the towns and it supported the feasibility team\u2019s efforts to target the poor and to accommodate their needs \nand demands in town-specific infrastructure improvement plans. The survey documents existing socioeconomic \nconditions to be used in monitoring changes and benefits resulting from the project. Population projections up to 2010 \nunderline the challenge facing the towns in coping with rapid urbanization and uncontrolled growth of slum and \nsquatter areas. Due consideration was given to gender differentials.  \n \nPoverty incidence was found to be 34% overall and as high as 40% in some towns, where income is below the poverty \nline of Tk44,410 per year. Households in hard core poverty survive on incomes of less than Tk36,345 per year, are \nconcentrated in overcrowded slum and squatter areas, and lead a hand-to-mouth existence. There are cases where \n20% (and sometimes more) of the households surveyed in slums are headed by women and the majority live in hard \ncore poverty.  Perception studies strongly  underline  the appeal  of  the poor for employment opportunities and decent  \n \n                                                 \n1 Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2001.  Preliminary Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2000. Dhaka; and World \nBank.2002. Poverty in Bangladesh: Building on Progress. Washington, DC.  ", "     Appendix 11  41 \nwages; their emphasis is on the need to improve drainage for quicker clearance of rainwater and facilitation of normal \nmovement during flooding to mitigate the loss of work-days. Women are particularly concerned about shelter for \nthemselves and their animals, children\u2019s access to schools, as well as access to medicine and health care, especially \nduring floods. Hence the importance of making poverty reduction a strategic objective of each project component was \nestablished.  \n \nPreparation and implementation of a Poverty Reduction Action Plan (PRAP), Urban Governance Improvement Action \nProgram (UGIAP), and Gender Action Plan (GAP) by each town with primary stakeholder participation have been \nsuggested. The capacity of the project towns will be strengthened for participatory local governance and development \nand to address poverty issues throughout project implementation. Emphasis will be on the involvement of women and \nthe  vulnerable  in  community  activities.  Allocation  of  funds  for  microcredit,  income-generating  activities,  skills \ndevelopment, and basic health and sanitation services has been suggested. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nPrimary stakeholders, who will benefit directly from the project, include the entire town's population, private property \nowners, commercial shops and businesses, private and public sector institutions, all of whom are interested in a \nsecure and flood-free environment. The poor will benefit from employment generated during construction and \nsubsequent O&M and through direct support for environmental improvement and provision of basic services.  \n \nSecondary  stakeholders  as  key  intermediaries  in  project  delivery  are  the  Government's  Executing  Agencies: \nBangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) and Local Government Engineering Department (LGED); elected \ntown representatives and administration; civil society, NGO,  community-based organization (CBO) and women\u2019s \norganizations, as possible partners to help implement social and environmental programs, conduct surveys, deliver \ntraining, and bring about full participation of women and other disadvantaged groups; private sector engineering firms \nand contractors interested in survey and construction contracts; and ADB whose thrust is to ensure the loan will \nactually achieve poverty reduction. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe participation strategy aims principally at the project towns' ownership of the urban development process and their \nsustained contribution toward O&M. Agreement on project design was reached, clarifying the respective roles and \nresponsibilities of each stakeholder through extensive consultation. A participatory strategy has been developed and \nthe responsibilities of all stakeholders, agencies, men, and women to implement participatory PRAP, UGIAP, and GAP \nhave been identified. The strategy calls for demand-driven, pro poor, people-oriented and gender-sensitive planning \nand implementation methods. It will involve appropriate sensitization, formal and on-the-job training, and support \nservices as part of the capacity assistance component for stakeholders and partners at all levels. \n \nTo help implement the project and to ensure participation of the poor and women, each project town will constitute a \ntown- level coordination committee (TCC) with representation from key citizen groups including women. Each project \ntown's participatory planning efforts will be strengthened , with emphasis on gender-balanced decision-making bodies \nsuch as, TCC, ward-based committees and gender and environment committees. Through meetings, joint rallies, \nconsultations, and workshops, each project town will interact with its citizens and ensure their participation. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to Maximize Beneficial Impacts on Women: \n \nThe project has significant gender implications. Poverty reduction and improvement in living standards through flood \nprotection measures, drainage, various environmental infrastructure development, as well as through better basic \nservices and employment opportunities for the urban poor, require that careful attention be given to gender equality in \nall project components. Women\u2019s empowerment and women\u2019s participation as agents and beneficiaries will be \npursued among both primary and secondary stakeholders. A generic GAP has been prepared and will be adopted by \nthe project towns through a participatory town-level process at the early stage of project implementation. This process \nwas requested by men and women \u2013 town representatives of the Mid-Term Gender Workshop in February 2004. The \nproposed GAP takes into consideration LGED\u2019s Gender Equity Strategy and Action Plan 2002\u20132007 as well as the \nnational policy and other guidelines on gender equality, including ADB\u2019s. It takes examples from other urban \ninfrastructure projects such as Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement Project (UGIIP) and Secondary \nTowns Infrastructure Development Project (STIDP) and has many dimensions. \n \n ", " \n42  Appendix 11 \n \nGender analysis has been applied to all components and contributed to the logical framework of the Project. Gender-\nsensitive indicators, quantitative and qualitative, have been identified and included in the monitoring and evaluation \nplan. \nThe socioeconomic survey has paid particular attention to women head of households (an average 13.6% of the \nsample in slum areas and 9.3% in non-slum areas) and to differentiate/compare perceptions, needs, and demands \naccording to men and women. The study also highlights the particular characteristics of poverty-stricken women.  \n \nWays have been suggested to create employment for women during and after construction, ensure wage equity, and \nattempt to increase the income of poor women and other disadvantaged groups. Surely the improved services will \nhelp reduce women\u2019s health hazards and ease their workloads of water collection and solid waste management. \nWomen\u2019s needs for privacy will also be taken into consideration by providing adequate toilet facilities for them in public \nplaces and institutions where needed.  \n \nWith reference to the capacity assistance component, the Project will follow UGIAP and GAP to enhance the capacity \nof female town representatives, ward commissioners, and staff to participate effectively in the project\u2019s decision-\nmaking entities. Female ward commissioners will receive separate training to better play their role in managing \nmunicipal affairs: they will be mentored to organize local women\u2019s groups and empower them to take part in urban \nplanning and management. Men\u2019s support and strong advocacy from the top are essential ingredients to successful \ngender mainstreaming. Thus gender training\u2013addressed to both men and women\u2013will be offered at all levels and to all \nstakeholders.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Under ADB's Policy   \n None  on Involuntary Resettlement, however, they are eligible for   None \nresettlement benefits such as cash grants. By modifying   \nthe engineering designs, in consultation with potentially  Resettlement \naffected people, the Project will try to further reduce the  studies: \nneed for resettlement. As a result, people may lose only a  census and \nsmall  part  of  their  residential  or  business  structures,  socioeconomic \nespecially those that tend to extend to the riverbank. For  survey \ndrainage improvement works, the Project will acquire only \nsmall  strips  of  land  on  payment  of  compensation  in \naccordance with the land acquisition laws of Bangladesh. \nThis will leave sufficient land for the affected people to \nstay where they are. While minimizing resettlement to the \nextent possible, the resettlement plan will ensure that the \naffected people, especially women and other vulnerable \ngroups, receive assistance so that they would be at least \nas well-off as they would have been without the Project. \n \n       \n   Significant  Since  the  Project  is  within  the  purview  of  national   Yes \nAffordability    priorities, it is assumed to be affordable.

The \nanalysis draws on the socioeconomic survey and flood damage assessment survey carried out \nunder the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) and other available secondary data. \nThe basic assumptions follows: (i) capital and operation and maintenance (O&M) costs were \napportioned into traded and nontraded components and labor; (ii) using the domestic price \nnumeraire, financial prices based on June 2004 prices and reduced by duties and taxes were \nconverted to economic prices by a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.1 for the traded-cost \ncomponent and 1.0 for the nontraded-cost component; (iii) a conversion factor of 0.9 was used \nfor the cost of unskilled labor and 0.85 for skilled labor to reflect the real market value of labor, \nwhich is lower than the official wage rates used in the financial cost estimates; (iv) a subproject \ncomponent was assumed to have a useful economic life of 30 years after construction; and (v) \nthe  real  opportunity  cost  of  capital  employed  in  the  analysis  was  assumed  at  12%,  and \nrepresents the social opportunity cost of capital (SOCC) for Bangladesh. \n \n2.  Least-cost analysis compares alternative options for supplying the same output to meet \nthe projected demand. Under the Project, however, no other option is considered for the \nfollowing reasons. First, the project design is based on the lessons learned from phase 1 that \nwas rated as successful. While adjustments are made to reflect the lessons learned, the \ntechnical solutions under the Project generally employ the same methodologies as those in the \nprevious  loan.  Second,  the  project  design  standard  follows  the  requirements  of  the \nGovernment's policy on water resources management. \n \nB.  Economic Benefits and Valuation  \n \n3.  The benefits considered in the economic analysis are (i) flood damage mitigation for \nbuildings and different types of property, (ii) flood damage mitigation for municipal infrastructure \nfacilities, (iii) flood damage mitigation for cultivated land, (iv) increase in land values, and (v) \nenhanced economic activities. The methodology used in determining the benefits is as follows. \n \n1.  Flood Damage Mitigation for Buildings and Other Property   \n \n4.  The amount of flood damage is determined by the severity and, in the project area, the \nfrequency of floods. Direct damage is caused by physical floodwaters that directly hit houses, \nother buildings and infrastructure, and is generally evaluated as the cost of replacing, repairing, \nor rehabilitating the affected property in the case of urban damage and as the net effect on farm \nincome in the case of crop damage.  \n \n5.  Two surveys were conducted under the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) \nto derive the estimates for flood damage costs in the towns of Munshiganj and Manikganj. The \nresults were used as a proxy for other towns for flood damage estimates. The survey data \ncovered  private  buildings,  residential  houses,  shops,  factories,  and  social  infrastructure \n(schools, religious establishments, and hospitals). Three types of floods were assumed for the \nproject areas: 1 in 5 years, 1 in 10 years, and 1 in 50 years. It was further assumed that these \nfloods represent flood depths of 0.5 meter (m), 0.5-1.0, and greater than 1. Table A12.1 shows \nthe annual average cost that the towns incur from flooding in their areas. For the total project ", "   \nAppendix 12  45 \narea, the average annual cost in flood damage is estimated at $17 million, demonstrating a high \ndemand for flood protection works.  \n \nTable A12.1: Summary of Flood Damage to Property (annual) \nTown   Taka Million  $ Million  Percent  \nOverall 9 towns  960.9  16.57          100 \nBrahmanbaria  62.3  1.07  6 \nGaibandha  34.7  0.60  4 \nJamalpur  31.3  0.54  3 \nKushtia  30.0  0.52  3 \nManikganj  75.4  1.30  8 \nMunshiganj  36.6  0.63  4 \nMymensingh  99.8  1.72  10 \nRajshahi  563.7  9.72  59 \nSunamganj  23.5  0.40  2 \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n2.  Flood Damage Mitigation for Infrastructure facilities \n \n6.  Frequent floods also damage municipal infrastructure, including drainage pipes and \nculverts,  sanitation  and  solid  waste  management  facilities.  However,  there  is  only  sparse \ninformation on flood damage estimates for municipal infrastructure, a situation that is common \neven in developed countries. Nevertheless, as a result of the devastating flooding in 1998, \nexternal agencies required flood damage assessments to be conducted before their assistance \nfor rehabilitation works is sought. The estimates in Table A12.2 are based on reports prepared \nafter the 1998 flooding. The average flood damage to infrastructure is estimated at $0.8 million \nfor three probabilities of flood frequency. The infrastructure works proposed under the Project, \nwhich are integrated with the flood protection works, will eliminate these costs.  \n \nTable A12.2: Summary of Flood Damage to Infrastructure  (annual) \nTown   Taka Million  $ Million  Percent  \nOverall 9 towns  43.7  0.75  100 \nBrahmanbaria  4.9  0.09  11 \nGaibandha  2.3  0.04  5 \nJamalpur  4.3  0.07  10 \nKushtia  3.3  0.06  8 \nManikganj  2.0  0.03  5 \nMunshiganj  1.9  0.03  4 \nMymensingh  8.3  0.14  19 \nRajshahi         14.7  0.25  34 \nSunamganj  1.9  0.03  4 \n     Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n3.  Flood Damage Mitigation for Cultivated Land \n \n7.  A significant beneficial impact of the Project will accrue to agricultural crops. In seven \ntowns, the project areas have significant agricultural land within the  town boundaries. The \nproject works will also result in protection for substantial additional rural or agricultural land \noutside  the  town  boundaries.  Any  flood  protection  works  in  these  towns  will  increase \nopportunities for agriculture. Crop damage due to over-bank spills, inundation, and breaches in \nthe riverbanks during the premonsoon and monsoon seasons will be reduced and flood-free \nlands will be increased. However, it is also assumed that protected agricultural areas will be \n ", " \n46  Appendix 12   \ngradually urbanized over a 5-year period and therefore any benefits accruing will be for a period \nof 5 years after project completion. The analysis identifies the agricultural land and the type of \ncrops that would be affected. Aman rice crops will be the most significant crop affected by the \nProject and therefore this effect is the one measured to derive agricultural benefits. All cultivated \nland benefits are reduced by 20% annually and expire 5 years after project completion. A \nsummary of the annual benefits is in Table A12.3. \n \nTable A.12.3: Increased Production in Cultivated Land \nAnnual Benefits  Cultivated  Benefit \nTown  ($million)  Area (ha)  ($/ha) \nBrahmanbaria  2.09  700  2,985 \nGaibandha  2.93  396  7,399 \nJamalpur           11.84  3,500  3,383 \nManikganj  5.63  1,500  3,754 \nMunshiganj  2.10  790  2,664 \nMymensingh  4.43  1,472  3,010 \nSunamganj  1.46  1,110  1,318 \nTotal           30.49  9,468  3,220 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n4.  Land Value Increases \n \n8.  Significant increase in land values is expected. Land value increases, estimated at 8% \nper year,1 will generally favor the urban poor as they are more inclined to occupy the lower-lying \nareas and are the major beneficiaries of the flood protection works. It is also expected that \nincreased land values will cause land and property owners to consolidate their investments to \ncapture secondary gains. An annual increase of 5% was assumed in phase 1. In calculating the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR), however, land value increases are not included to avoid \ndouble counting of benefits resulting from flood damage mitigation.   \n \n5.  Enhanced Economic Activities \n \n9.  Reducing in the threat of flood (and related) damage in the project area will reduce the \nuncertainty associated with virtually all economic activity, which, in turn, will irrefutably augment \ninvestment levels, which then translate into further increases in local employment and income. \nAn attempt was made to identify the multiplier effects on major items, such as consumer \nproducts, building and petroleum products, and the demand that might arise from the project \nworks. The resultant demand is multiplied by current prices to determine revenues.  \n \n6.  Indirect Benefits \n \n10.  Other benefits from the Project include reduced household expenditures on medical \nservices; reduced costs of removing solid wastes that people dump in canals; reduced costs for \nrepairing  road  and  vehicle  damage  from  flooding;  reduced  travel  delays  caused  by \nwaterlogging; and reduced loss of productive activity due to illness or poor health. The main \nindirect benefit is improved workers' productivity due to improved hygienic conditions. While the \nglobal impact of these microchanges is difficult to assess, an attempt was made to arrive at a \nbaseline estimate. For instance, the nationwide per capita government expenditures on health \n                                                 \n1  For a conservative indicator of trends in the increase of land prices over the last 7 years House Rent Indices (1984-\n85) of Private Residential Houses for Rajshahi was used, which shows that, on the average, land prices have risen \nby 8% per annum. ", "   \nAppendix 12  47 \nare presently about $2.5/person,2 which is about 0.2% of per capita income in the project area.  \nThus, if the project works eventually made an impact in the same proportion on direct project \nrecipients, the annual benefit will be approximately $3.5 million. This benefit was not used in the \nanalysis, but is quoted to indicate the project\u2019s importance both socially and economically. \n \nC.  Economic Rationale \n \n11.  All  the  project  components  have  a  strong  economic  rationale  since  they  provide \nminimum acceptable standards for basic living conditions and help remove existing constraints \non social development and economic growth. Similarly, all components were designed along \nsound principles of priority needs, consultation and targeting, and demand management and \nrehabilitation before new investment. They represent technically feasible options at the least \ncost. Economic analysis is carried out for all the project components combined since the project \nbenefits will be realized from the integrated investments.  \n \n12.  The summary of the economic evaluation (Table A12.4) indicates that the overall EIRR \nis 22.8%. The base EIRRs, ranging from 13.5% in Rajshahi and Sunamganj to 44.6% in \nJamalpur, are above the economic opportunity cost of capital for all towns. When tested for \nsensitivity, the results remain robust. The Project relies heavily on the economic benefits that \naccrue to the mitigation of flood damage to buildings and short-term cultivated land benefits. \nOverall, the Project is most sensitive to the timing of project benefits rather than to adverse \neffects on capital, O&M, and benefit levels. \n \nTable A.12.4: Summary of EIRRs \nTown  EIRR (%)  Capital Cost  O&M Cost  Benefits  Benefits  Costs \nIncreased   Increased   Reduced   Delayed   Increased, \n10%  10%  10%  1 year  Benefits \nDecreased\nOverall Project  22.8  20.90  22.70  20.60  19.20  18.70 \nSensitivity Indicator      0.48    0.04    0.52    0.65    0.69 \nBrahmanbaria  20.4  18.90  20.30  18.60  17.60  17.00 \nSensitivity Indicator      0.46    0.05    0.50    0.62    0.67 \nGaibandha  16.3  14.40  16.20  14.00  13.50  12.00 \nSensitivity Indicator      0.58    0.08    0.62    0.67    0.78 \nJamalpur  44.6  41.60  44.50  41.30  35.30  38.30 \nSensitivity Indicator      0.42    0.02    0.45    0.73    0.62 \nKushtia  14.3  13.20  14.20  13.00  12.80  11.90 \nSensitivity Indicator      0.45    0.06    0.50    0.55    0.67 \nManikganj  33.7  31.10  33.60  30.80  27.20  28.20 \nSensitivity Indicator      0.45    0.03    0.49    0.70    0.66 \nMunshiganj  18.6  17.00  18.50  16.80  16.00  15.20 \nSensitivity Indicator      0.48    0.05    0.52    0.62    0.69 \nMymensingh  30.4  28.30  30.30  28.00  25.30  25.90 \nSensitivity Indicator      0.43    0.02    0.46    0.67    0.64 \nRajshahi  13.5  12.20  13.40  12.00  11.90  10.70 \nSensitivity Indicator      0.50    0.08    0.55    0.57    0.72 \nSunamganj  13.5  12.20  13.40  12.00  11.90  10.70 \nSensitivity Indicator      0.50    0.07    0.55    0.58    0.72 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n                                                 \n2  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2000. Statistical Yearbook of Bangladesh. Dhaka. (Table 13.15, page 563).  \n ", " \n48  Appendix 12   \nD.  Poverty Reduction Impact \n \n13.  The  poverty-reducing  impact  of  the  Project  is  traced  by  evaluating  the  expected \ndistribution of net economic benefits to various groups.  A poverty impact ratio expressing the \nproportion  of  net  economic  benefits  accruing  to  the  poor  is  calculated  by  comparing  net \neconomic benefits to the poor with net economic benefits to the project as a whole. \n \n14.  The portion of the four groups (consumers, government, private sector and labor and \nbeneficiaries) that were classified as poor was assessed.  For consumers, the town profiles \nrepresent an analysis of the distribution of household incomes across a range of monthly \nincomes. The bottom two groups classified as \u201cpoor\u201d and \u201cvery poor\u201d were taken as being \nrepresentative of the poor in that particular town. Government represents the economic effect \non the economy as a whole. The poor of the country will share, probably disproportionately, in \nany increase or decrease in the gross national product of the country. In Bangladesh, the \nresultant share of the poor in incremental increase or decrease in gross domestic product \n(GDP) is calculated at 18%. Although it is inevitable that the poor will share in net economic \nbenefits to the private sector, it is assumed that the poor will not share in any benefits allocated \nto the private sector.  On the other hand, all net economic benefits allocated to labor and \nbeneficiaries are assumed to reach the poor. The overall poverty impact ratio is estimated to be \n48%. \n ", "   \nAppendix 13  49 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The financial analysis focuses on cost recovery measures that the municipalities must \ntake  to  ensure  that  they  will  be  able  to  finance  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M) \nexpenditures associated with local components of the project (drainage, solid waste, sanitation, \nslum improvement). Project capital costs as well as the O&M costs for the flood protection \nworks are financed centrally by the Government and therefore will not burden the municipal \nbudgets.  \n \nB.  Financial Management \n \n2.  Accounting  and  financial  management  of  the  municipalities  are  governed  by  the \nPourashavas Ordinance of 1977. Municipalities follow the government system of accounting, \nwhich is cash-based financial reporting rather than accrual-based accounting procedures. The \nassets and liabilities are not accounted for and information on the true cost of providing urban \nservices is not determined precisely. The Government is currently considering a revision of the \n1985 Model Tax Rule which on implementation will substantially increase municipal income \nfrom sources other than the property tax.  \n \n3.  As the Project calls for large investments that will have a major impact on cash flows, it \nrequires the project municipalities to follow a more organized approach in managing financial \nresources. Most of these municipalities are financially weak. Tax collection efficiency is far from \nsatisfactory, annual development grants are used to finance current revenue expenditure, Tax \narrears are increasing, and power bills remain unpaid. Thus, project municipalities have to move \nnow toward improved efficiency and additional resource mobilization, not only to meet the \ncurrent  deficit  but  also  to  meet  the  additional  costs  to  operate  and  maintain  the  project \ncomponents.  \n \n4.  Following the lessons learned from phase 1 of the Project, institutionalized training to \nimprove  the  financial  management  of  the  project  towns  will  be  provided  through  the \nimplementation of the Urban Governance and Improvement Action Program (UGIAP). The \nProject  municipalities  will  be  required  to  adopt  a  time-bound  financial  accountability  and \nsustainability action program suggested in the UGIAP. \n \nC.  Municipal Revenue and Expenditure \n \n5.  The main sources of municipal revenue are property taxes; business taxes such as trade \nlicenses, vehicle fees, ferry ghat charges, and user charge where a service is provided; bazaar \nand other property rentals;  and other miscellaneous revenues. In addition, The Government \nprovides a revenue grant, which includes a grant for salaries and a general grant to compensate \nfor  the  loss  of  revenue  from  octroi,  and  a  development  fund  grant  for  construction  and \nmaintenance of infrastructure under the Government's annual development program (ADP).    \n \n6.  Aggregate annual revenues in the project municipalities are $8.5 million. The average \nannual revenue is $0.95 million. The maximum and minimum revenues are $5.3 million and \n$0.27 million, respectively. Own-source revenues make up one half of total revenues, with the \nbalance provided by the Government as grants (Table A13.1). Rajshahi City Corporation (RCC) \nis the main beneficiary of the development fund grant. In the case of other project municipalities, \nthe development fund grants are low, averaging $0.07 million annually. Similarly,  except in \nRCC, the revenue grants in lieu of the abolition of octroi are insignificant.  The per capita annual \nrevenue average is $7.0, varying from a high of $13.0 to a low of $2.9. These modest amounts \nare the financial base for all municipal activities. \n ", " \n50  Appendix 13 \n \n \nTable A13.1: Composition of Total Revenues  \nFY 2000/01\u2013FY 2002/03 \n(%) \nItem  Average  Maximum  Minimum \nOwn Sources       \nProperty Taxes  18.3  54.2  9.3 \nOther Revenues  32.4  58.5  25.1 \nSubtotal  50.7     \nGovernment Grants       \nRevenue Grants  2.4  38.5  0.0 \nDevelopment Fund and Other Capital Grants  46.9  64.5  0.0 \nSubtotal  49.3     \nTotal  100.0     \n   Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n7.  The municipalities can levy property taxes to a maximum of 27%, currently allowed \nunder  the  Pourashavas  Ordinance.  Only  two  project  municipalities,  Brahminbaria  and \nGaibandha, levy property tax at the maximum level allowed. In the others, the property tax rates \ncan be increased from 6% to 10%. Property-based taxes comprise 36.1% of total own-source \nrevenues, and range from 20.2% to 67.8%. Among the nontax revenue sources, \"miscellaneous \nand other\" revenues are dominant at 44%, (Table A13.2).  \n \nTable A13.2: Composition of Own-Source Revenues \nFY 2000/01\u2013FY 2002/03 \nItem  Average  Maximum   Minimum  \nProperty Taxes  36.1  67.8  20.2 \nBusiness Taxes  10.9  21.1  7.1 \nBazaar/Rentals    8.6  28.4  4.2 \nOther Income  44.4  59.6  8.3 \nTotal Own Sources       100.0     \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n8.  Aggregate annual expenditures for the project municipalities are $6.9 million. The annual \naverage expenditure is $0.77 million with maximum and minimum annual expenditures at $4.3 \nmillion and $0.18 million for Rajshahi and Gaibandha, respectively. The average per capita \nexpenditure is $5.7, varying from a high of $10.5 to a low of $1.4.  \n \nD.  Financial Performance \n \n9.  Overall, financial performance shows that the project municipalities rely heavily on \ngrants for operations, with the average ratio of own-source revenues to total revenues being \n0.51.  Only  two  project  municipalities,  Gaibandha  and  Brahminbaria,  manage  to  cover \nexpenditures with own-source revenues. RCC fails to cover expenses on salaries from own-\nsource revenues.  \n \n10.  The efficiency of tax collection is an important issue since the project municipalities will \nbe under significant pressure to increase revenues so as to cover incremental O&M costs. The \ntax collection performance (Table A13.3) is below average overall and is poor for tax arrears. \nOnly about 50% of the taxpayers pay their taxes on time.   \n \n \n \n ", "   \nAppendix 13  51 \nTable A13.3: Property Tax Collection Efficiency \nFY 2000/01\u2013FY 2002/03 \n(%) \nTown  Current  Arrears  Total \nBrahmanbaria  52  38  44 \nGaibandha  63  Not available  63 \nJamalpur  68  71  70 \nKushtia  66  39  49 \nManikganj  35  31  32 \nMunshiganj  71  57  65 \nMymensingh  42  17  29 \nRajshahi  112  61  88 \nSunamganj  42  43  43 \nAverage  65  40  52 \nNote: The budget figures do not provide an accurate measure of arrears or current \ntaxes owed. This is evident from the value for current taxes in Rajshahi, which \nexceeds 100%.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n11.  In  summary,  increased  tax  rates  and  new  taxes  will  not  be  sufficient  to  increase \nrevenues in the short term. Instead, such measures will increase the tax burden for those who \npay their taxes now, and on time. The capacity-building measures under the Project are \ntherefore aimed to take aggressive measures to improve collection efficiency for existing taxes \nand expanding the tax base.  \n \nE.  O&M Costs under the Project \n \n12.  Adequate O&M practices are critical. Evidence from phase 1 suggests that benefits from \nthe Project will not be sustainable if the works are not properly maintained. In the project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA),  O&M  costs  were  developed  separately  for  all \nsubprojects. The O&M cost for the flood protection works is the responsibility of the Bangladesh \nWater  Development  Board  (BWDB).  The  O&M  cost  relating  to  drainage  and  solid  waste \nmanagement is the direct responsibility of the municipality. These costs (Table A13.4) were \nused to assess the financial capacity of the project municipalities under with-project and without-\nproject situations. Sanitary waste facilities and other slum improvement subprojects will be \nmaintained by the beneficiaries, and therefore are not a burden to municipal resources.   \n \nTable A13.4: Program Costs for O&M \nO&M Costs ($/capita/year) \nIncremental Cost per \nTown  Without \nWith Project  Incremental   Household ($/week) \nProject \nBrahmanbaria  1.24  1.52  0.27  0.03 \nGaibandha  0.84  1.76  0.91  0.09 \nJamalpur  0.89  1.92  1.02  0.09 \nKushtia  0.84  1.69  0.86  0.09 \nManikganj  0.46  1.89  1.43  0.13 \nMunshiganj  0.62  1.64  1.02  0.11 \nMymensingh  0.96  1.78  0.83  0.08 \nRajshahi  0.96  1.64  0.68  0.07 \nSunamganj  0.68  1.35  0.66  0.08 \nAverage   0.83  1.67  0.85  0.07 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n ", "  52  Appendix 13   \nF.  Cost Recovery \n \n13.  The rates and charges currently used by municipalities for cost recovery are not all \nnecessarily  appropriate  funding  mechanisms  for  recovery  of  incremental  O&M  costs.  The \ndrainage improvements and solid waste management services confer a specific benefit to \nindividual property owners as well as a general benefit to all community members within the \nmunicipal boundaries. The property tax is a broadly based local tax that allocates cost to tax \npayers in proportion to assessed property values. For this reason, the property tax is the best \nfunding instrument for drainage maintenance and solid waste management services.  \n \n14.  The first step toward cost recovery is tax reform involving an increase in collection \nefficiency and property assessments. Efforts to update assessments and improve tax collection \nshould be pursued first to realize the full potential of existing property taxes. These efforts will \nalso reduce the implicit cross subsidy that now exists between people who pay their taxes and \nthose who do not. With adequate promotion, this change can increase public acceptance of the \nproperty tax system and public willingness to accept future tax rate increases. The following \nmeasures are proposed as a cost recovery strategy for municipal O&M costs: \n(i)  Improve property tax collection efficiency and update property assessments. An \noverall  collection  efficiency  of  80%  and  a  20%  increase  in  assessment  are \nproposed as achievable targets by FY2009. \n(ii)  Increase property tax rates as needed up to the maximum allowable thresholds to \ncover the remaining funding deficits by FY2009.  \n(iii)  Increase  other  user  fees  and  charges  as  a  last  resort  if  property  tax  rate \nadjustments do not generate sufficient revenue. \n \n15.  A specific charge for solid waste collection from individual households is an appropriate \nuser fee. Such fees are currently used at a neighborhood level in Bangladesh municipalities to \nfinance waste collection services organized by community groups. This funding arrangement \nhas the added advantages of conferring direct local control on the delivery of the service, \ncreating employment opportunities for low-income households, and providing market-based \nincentives to encourage efficient service delivery. Project municipalities  will therefore aim to \nfund the solid waste management services in a similar manner without direct financial or \noperational involvement. \n \nG.  Financial Projections \n \n16.  As the subprojects are not direct revenue earning, the capital costs will be financed by \nthe  Government  as  grants.  The  municipalities  therefore  do  not  carry  any  debt  service \nobligations. Financial projections were completed to test the sustainability of the proposed \ndrainage and solid waste management works over the forecast period FY2020. The analysis \nfocused on the potential to finance municipal expenditures using the revenue gained from \nreform in the property tax collection and assessment system, and raising the property tax rates \nto a level that covers the full municipal expenditures. Where this could not be achieved, the \nproperty tax rate is increased to the maximum allowed level, 27%. Further adjustments will be \nnecessary if total revenues fail to meet the total expenditures. In which case, an increase in the \nnontax rates and charges will be considered.

In four project municipalities\u2014Kushtia, Rajshahi, Mymensingh, and Sunamganj\u2014it was \npossible to fully cover the O&M costs and also maintain financial performance by increasing the \nproperty  tax  rate.  In  the  other  four  project  municipalities\u2014Brahmanbaria,  Gaibandha, \nManikganj,  and  Munshiganj\u2014all costs were recovered with property tax rates increased to \nmaximum level of 27%. Only Jamalpur failed to meet the full costs. Jamalpur will therefore need \nto increase its nontax revenues by 80% to achieve full cost recovery. The increase appears \nlarge, as the current nontax revenue base in Jamalpur is small. Alternatively, property tax \ncollection efficiency will be achieved at 90%.  \n ", " \n54  Appendix 14 \n \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.   Introduction \n \n1.  In compliance with the environmental requirements of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), an initial environmental examination (IEE) was conducted for  the Secondary Towns \nIntegrated Flood Protection Project Phase II (STIFPP II), which covers eight towns and one city \n(Rajshahi) in Bangladesh. The Project is categorized as a B project in accordance with ADB's \nOM Section F1/OP. Subcomponents to be financed under the Project showed no significant \nenvironmental  impacts.  Project  activities  that  may  have  a  marginal  effect  and  the  main \nmitigating measures proposed are summarized here. Overall the project is expected to result in \nsubstantial  environmental  benefits.  The  IEE  is  in  agreement  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nGuidelines  (2003)  and  Bangladesh\u2019s  laws  and  regulations,  including  Bangladesh\u2019s  EIA \nGuidelines (1997). \n \n2.  The Project aims to provide a flood-free and more secure living environment in nine of \nBangladesh\u2019s secondary towns through flood protection, improved internal town drainage, urban \nenvironmental improvements, solid waste disposal, improved sanitation, capacity building, and \nimplementation assistance. \n \nB.   Description of Project Components \n \n3.  The main components to be financed by ADB are (i) flood protection works, (ii) drainage \nsystem improvements, (iii) urban environmental improvements, and (iv) capacity building and \ninstitutional strengthening.  \n \n4.  The  flood  protection  works  component  comprises  new  schemes  for  the  towns  of \nBrahmanbaria, Jamalpur, Manikganj, Mymensingh, and Sunamanj where embankments that will \neffectively  convert  them  into  polders  will  surround  the  last  two.  Gaibandha,  Kushtia,  and \nRajshahi will require extension and rehabilitation works. Flood protection works typically include \nbuilding  and  repair  of  flood  walls  (approx.  20  kilometers  [km]);  resection,  rehabilitate,  or \nconstruct core wall embankments (approx. 70 km); regulators and pipe sluices (approx. 90); \nrevetment works, groynes, and spurs (less than 5); and metalling crest embankments.  \n \n5.  The drainage system components includes cleaning of existing primary, secondary, and \ntertiary drains; and repair, rehabilitation, excavation, construction and lining of 100-150 km of \ndrains and culverts. All structures comprising the drainage system will be designed to resist all \nforces and loads to which they will be subjected. Auxiliary elements will include silt traps, trash \nracks, weep holes, and plot drains. \n \n6.  Municipal  engineering  works  comprise  a  solid  waste  management  subcomponent, \ninstallation of sanitary latrines and slum improvement. Solid waste management will involve \nestablishing sanitary landfill sites in eight towns, with provision for lining to protect impervious \nsoils and groundwater and leachate collection and treatment ponds. This subcomponent will \nalso provide for  pilot composting facilities (10 or 2 initially), demolition and disposal of 1,300 \ndustheaps,  solid  waste  transfer  stations,  mechanical  sweeping  equipment,  strainers  for \ncollecting of solid waste from drains, and transport facilities (rickshaws, pushcarts, garbage \ntrucks, and bulldozers). The sanitation improvement subcomponent will provide 13,200 sanitary \nlatrines  and  22  public  toilets.  The  slum  improvement  subcomponent  will  supply  basic \ninfrastructure of sanitation, drainage, footpaths, water supply, and lighting.  ", "   \nAppendix 14  55 \n \nC.   Description of the Environment \n \n7.  The STIFPP II is within the Asiatic monsoon region in Bangladesh. The area is humid \ntropical with prolonged monsoons for 4-5 months of the year and consequent intermittent \nflooding from May to October in large parts of the country. Elevations of the secondary towns \ngenerally vary from 5.5 meters (m) to 16.5 m above sea level. Both urban and rural areas \nsurrounding the nine towns are generally subject to moderate to high flooding risk from the \nadjacent rivers, and internal runoff from intense or prolonged storm events.  The current \ndrainage systems of these towns consist of small, ad hoc drainage ditches that were able to \ndirect water to low-lying areas, ponds, khals (water channels), or rivers.  With the increase in \npopulation and building density, paved areas, and reduced green space, urban runoff discharge \nhas increased considerably, often rendering existing drainage systems inadequate.  While the \nofficial 2001 population figures for the nine towns total 1.16 million, there are significant and \nunaccounted  for  poorer  income  groups,  notably  recently  settled  dwellers  who  are  most \nvulnerable to the impacts of flooding and inadequate drainage. \n \n8.  Surface waters in rivers, khals, and canals are unsuitable for drinking, but treatment can \nbe easily provided. Groundwater in many areas of Bangladesh is often contaminated with \nnaturally occurring arsenic and heavy metals; therefore, testing is essential. In all nine cities, \necological resources including fisheries and scarce natural forests, are declining due to large \npopulation pressures.. Crops cultivated in the surrounding lowland areas around the towns \ninclude rice, other  grains, and vegetables.  \n \nD.   Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n1.  Location \n \n9.  The proposed schemes are in nine towns located on the banks of powerful rivers. The \ntowns are subject to regular internal and external floods. Earthquakes have been reported in the \narea; however, their magnitude over the  past 100 years was below 4 on the Richter scale. \nEnvironmental  risks  associated  with  structural  failure  will  be  prevented  through  the  strict \nimplementation of Bangladesh\u2019s Building Rules.  \n \n10.  Project construction will require total land acquisition of 47.26 hectares (ha) for drainage \nand  flood  control  works,  which  affect  1,835  households.  A  comprehensive  compensation \nprogram has been produced in conjunction with an entitlement matrix to ensure that involuntary \nresettlement addresses compensation to replace lost assets, livelihood and income, assistance \nin relocation sites for appropriate facilities and services, and assistance in rehabilitation to \nachieve the same level of well-being. \n \n11.  Project implementation will result in the conversion of small amounts of rural agricultural \nland, with associated loss of trees and crops, and reduced fishponds for construction of flood \nprotection structures, drainage system and landfill sites. The constructor will optimize the \nengineering design ensure that environmental impacts to the ecosystem are minimized.  \n \n12.  Locations of landfill and solid waste transfer stations need in some cases to be finalized \nand future design should address associated complexities. Future selection should ensure that \nsuitable sites will have minimal exposure to flooding; be located away from populated areas, \nnear to a clay source or located on clays; have minimal resettlement requirements; and have a \nlocation  with  minimal  local  nuisance  hazards.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review \n ", " \n56  Appendix 14   \nprocedure  has  been  prepared  to  guide  the  environmental  assessment  for  each  landfill \nsubproject to facilitate compliance with the environmental requirements of the Government and \nADB. An environmental appraisal and subproject brief (EASB) will be prepared by the Local \nGovernment  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  and  submitted  to  the  Town  Office.  Careful \nscreening of potential subprojects based on environmental criteria will be conducted based on \nthe  review  of  EASB  by  the  Environmental  Section  of  the  Town  Office.  For  any  selected \nsubproject,  LGED  will  prepare  a  full  environmental  assessment  report  including  public \nconsultation and an environmental management plan with specific mitigating measures and \nfinancial sources as prerequisite for approval of credit. A monitoring program will be developed \nto ensure that none of the landfill subprojects will have major adverse environmental impacts. \nThe environmental criteria for site selection and the detailed environmental assessment and \nreview procedure for landfill subprojects are provided in the IEE. \n \n2.  Design \n \n13.  The  riverbank  will  have  significant  positive  impacts  by  protecting  the  productive \nagricultural land and homestead from progressive river erosion, that would result in associated \ndisplacement of households. However, active structures (groynes, spurs, guide bunds) and \npassive structures (bank protection structures, revetments) built on the riverbank will also cause \nmorphological impacts, affecting the river flow and, to a certain extent, shaping the riverbed and \nthe river course. Bank protection structures planned for the project are passive structures. \nThese should be well-aligned with the direction of the flow to minimize bank erosion. River \ntraining in the form of active structures is, however, also part of the project. As a result, erosion \nupstream and downstream from the selected towns may occur. The aim to minimize erosion at \nupstream  and  downstream  locations  will  ultimately  affect  a  number  of  individuals  and \nvegetation. Flood modeling will be undertaken as part of engineering design. River training \nworks will also have a small impact on aquatic organisms. \n \n14.  Interference of drainage facilities with other utilities is possible during construction of \nnew drains. The situation will be mitigated through utility mapping and keeping minimal distance \nlocations. Overflow and bypassing hazards may occur in areas serving large populations. For \nthis purpose appropriate sizing and material selection will be essential. The cost estimate will \nhave a budget provision for relocating and restoring or replacing damaged utilities to minimize \nthe negative impact.   \n \n15.  Appropriate waste segregation is essential to ensure a good operating a sanitary landfill \nsite and successful composting facilities. The Project will provide equipment for segregating \nwaste  during  collection,  to  be  further  confirmed  in  waste  transfer  centers.  In  addition,  a \ncomprehensive solid waste management plan will be developed for each of the nine towns \nbefore loan disbursement starts. Leachate may contaminate soil and groundwater if no proper \nleachate collection system is provided. To prevent the problem, all landfill sites will be sanitary. \nThe design should incorporate (i) waste segregation and recycling with the solid waste disposal \nsystem to maximize the service life of the landfill; (ii) a proper sanitary lining, preferably of clay \nor geosynthetic fabric; (iii) a system to properly collect and treat leachate; and (iv) the design of \na collection system for landfill gases. Equipment should be provided for waste segregation \nduring  collection  and  in  waste  transfer  centers.  When  finalized  site  selection  is,  a  full \nconsultation process with affected people will be conducted during the detailed design stage.  \nEndorsement from ADB will be sought before initiating construction activities. \n \n16.  Sanitation facilities to be provided under this Project will include only sanitary pit latrines \nfor households that do not have the financial resources to install them, and public toilets. Where ", "   \nAppendix 14  57 \npossible, sanitary latrines will be two pit latrines or be provided with septic tanks. Poor latrine \ndesign will attract insect vectors. \n \n3.  Construction Impacts on Physical Environment \n \n17.  During construction, a large amount of sand will have to be transported to the sites. \nStorage of sand and sand-filled geo-bags at the project site may generate dust. Impacts during \ntransport and storage of sand will be minimized by covering the sand or by keeping the surface \nwet. If sand is to be transported by boat, boatowners will be required to keep their engines \nproperly maintained to reduce air pollution from exhausts and oil spills in the water courses. \nSimilar practices will be observed for land transportation. \n \n18.  Site construction activities such as digging of drains or landfill site landscaping will also \ngenerate dust, noise, vibration that will affect both workers on-site and the nearby population. \nSoil erosion may result from land preparation activities. Proposed mitigating measures include \nuse of dust suppression techniques such as water sprays, covered wagons and skips; work \nwithin agreed-upon hours; plants and equipment with low operating noise levels; and limiting \nexcavation and land leveling works during the rainy season. \n \n19.  Extensive sand mining or sand from land immediately adjacent to the riverbanks may \ncause substantial erosion in these areas. An alternative solution is sand dredging from river \nbeds, since construction will take place over a period of 5 years and the dredged volume is \nconsidered small with respect to the estimated annual bed load transport. Establishment of \nworking areas and storage of sand and sand-filled geo-bags at the project site may damage \nlocal vegetation and degrade the topsoil, affecting its productivity. Removing the topsoil from the \nstorage site and returning it on completion of construction may be appropriate; however, sand \nstorage site selecting in areas with no topsoil (sandy areas) would be more appropriate.  \n \n4.  Construction Impacts on Ecosystems \n \n20.  During construction, sediments may reach the aquatic habitat due to sand mining, \ntransport, storing, filling of sandbags, and dumping. Slope preparation that may be necessary at \nsome  stretches  would  spread  sediments.  However,  the  expected  increase  in  sediment \nconcentration is not considered higher than that generated at present by river erosion and may \nbe considered minor. \n \n21.  The Project will not encroach into terrestrial habitats of significance. On completion, \nhowever, the embankment in some areas may prevent some terrestrial fauna from coming to \nthe river to drink. Given the urban nature of many of the sites, the impact on terrestrial \necosystems is expected to be minimal. During construction, noise may disturb the scarce \nwildlife and birds in the vicinity. Measures undertaken to minimize impacts to the surrounding \npopulation will also be of benefit to the ecosystems. \n \n5.  Construction Impacts on the Surrounding Population \n \n22.  Reduced vehicle accident risk and preventing disturbance resulting from increased traffic \nvolume will be enforced through a sound traffic management plan promoting traffic flow and \nfocusing on the highly populated areas or schools. Interaction with the public will be encouraged \nthrough continuous dialogue and information exchange, establishing a procedure for recording \nand dealing with complaints, and workers instruction. Good health and hygiene practices at \nwork and reduced work accidents will be achieved by means of an occupational health and \n ", " \n58  Appendix 14 \nsafety plan (OHSP), which will include emergency plans, personnel basic training, first-aid \nprovisions,  and  a  comprehensive  domestic  solid  waste  management  plan  and  sanitation \nfacilities for the construction camp. Most of these measures will also be enforced during the \noperation stage at the site. \n \n6.  Operation \n \n23.  Intense floods can last for 2 months of the year, preventing the opening of gates and \nsluices  and  therefore  discharge  of  drains  into  the  watercourses.  The  water  then  remains \nstagnant and concentrates in lower areas of the town, possibly creating an insect-breeding \nhabitat. While internal hydrological studies were conducted to address some of the issues \nduring  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA),  a  sanitation  and  wastewater \ntreatment management plan will be formulated for each of the nine towns to suggest appropriate \nsanitation measures. \n \n24.  As part of the mitigating measures implemented in the solid waste management center, \nregular pest (rodents and insects) treatment will be carried out. Moreover, an OHSP ensuring \nthe safety and good health of the operators in those centers will be formulated and endorsed \nbefore  starting operation.   \n \n25.  The  proposed  landfill  is  anticipated  to  produce  significant  amounts  of  gases,  e.g. \nmethane and carbon dioxide. In addition, gases like, hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide, and \nammonia may be formed in small quantities from decomposing solid waste. These are odorous \ngases and may create nuisance and health hazards to nearby communities if not controlled. In \naddition,  they  may  have  some  negative  effect  on  the  vegetation  of  the  area.  Mitigating \nmeasures proposed to minimize the negative impacts include provision of proper soil cover, \nbuffer zone, planting, and a proper gas control system. The option to reuse methane as biogas \nfor power production may also be considered at the detailed design stage. \n   \n26.  It is envisaged that traffic loads in the area approaching the landfill site may increase \ndue to the movement of transfer vehicles, and their affect the community and cause nuisance \nand health risks. Mitigating measures will include transport of waste during times of light traffic \nto minimize gas emissions in busy areas, provision of a traffic management plan and close \ncoordination between municipalities and traffic police personnel for smooth execution. \n \n27.  The presence of silt and solid waste in drains may obstruct the flow, resulting in overflow \nor flooding, and further environmental pollution in areas along the drains. Provision must be \nmade for cleaning and desilting by the municipalities. The design must consider accessibility of \nthe drains. \n \n28.  Operation and regular maintenance of both latrines and toilets and sanitary landfill site \nare  essential  to  achieve  the  objectives  of  environmental  improvement.  This  issue  will  be \naddressed  in  detail  in  the  solid  waste  management  plan  and  sanitation  and  wastewater \nmanagement plan to be formulated before loan effectiveness for each of the nine secondary \ntowns. Impacts to be addressed will include safety of health workers and the neighborhood, pest \nprevention, collection and disposal of treated leachate, waste segregation, reuse and recycling, \npublic awareness and required training, and operation linkages with the private sector for \nfertilizer conversion.  \n ", "   \nAppendix 14  59 \n29.  Groundwater supply systems to be provided in the slum areas will address evaluation of \naquifer  resources  before  extraction  to  prevent  depletion,  and  water  testing  before  safe \nconsumption. \n \nE.   Environmental Monitoring Plan and Institutional Requirements  \n \n30.  Technical  and  institutional  mitigating  measures  will  be  incorporated  in  the  detailed \ndesign of the Project. Measures of a planning, functional, institutional and procedural character \nhave to be included in the site selection criteria, in the tender documents, and in the OHSP and \nthe traffic plan. Mitigating measures related to the construction works will be stated in the \ncontract with the contractor. The project management unit (PMU), LGED, and Bangladesh \nWater Development Board (BWDB), and project implementation units (PIUs) in the project \ntowns  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  and  enforcement  during  construction.  During  the \noperational  phase,  the  communities  undertaking  solid  waste  management  activities,  and \nmunicipal  authorities  aided  by  BWDB  and  LGED  will  be  responsible  for  implementing \nenvironmental measures in the sector of water and municipal engineering, respectively.  The \nexecuting  agency  will  obtain  relevant  environmental  clearances  from  the  Department  of \nEnvironment before implementing of any civil works activities. The Department of Environment \nwill  be  responsible  for  overseeing  overall  environmental  compliance  and  environmental \nmonitoring. During its review missions, ADB will also assess environmental compliance in the \ndifferent towns. \n \nF.   Public Consultation and Disclosure  \n \n31.  Formal and informal consultation exercises were undertaken during preparation of the \nproject preparatory technical assistance (PPTA). Municipal and government officials were also \ninterviewed and their views solicited regarding STIFPP II goals and objectives. A total of 57 \nmeetings and formal and informal consultations were carried out in the nine towns of concerned. \nMeetings were held with affected groups, municipal authorities, and various sectors of society \nwithin  the  vicinity  of  the  project  sites.  Other  groups  consulted  included  villagers,  town \ninhabitants, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs). Main issues of interest included (i) the \nneed for an efficient solid waste management system, (ii) access to safe drinking water, (iii) \nneed  for  flood  protection  and  flood  embankments,  and  (iv)  desire  for  an  environmental \nawareness campaign. In addition, in agreement with ADB\u2019s information disclosure requirements, \nthis summary IEE will be available worldwide through the depository library system and the ADB \nweb site. \n \nG.   Findings and Recommendations  \n \n32.  Environmental  screening  processes  were  carried  out  in  nine  cities.  Positive \nenvironmental impacts result from protecting the towns against recurrent internal and external \nfloods, improving overall internal drainage, managing solid waste, and improving sanitation.  \nMitigating measures and an environmental monitoring plan have been formulated to minimize \nnegative environmental impacts.  \n \nH.   Conclusions \n \n33.  The proposed Project will significantly improve the overall environmental quality of the \nparticipating secondary towns. The Project will not have significant environmental impacts and \nclassification B is appropriate. Therefore an environmental impact assessment is not deemed \nnecessary.  \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20041206130942+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20041111172851+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R233-04.doc", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 6.0 for Word", "Author": "ADB", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "SourceModified": "D:20041111092832"}}
