The  selected  towns  are  prone  to  river  flooding,  river \nerosion, waterlogging, and flash floods. The poorer income groups, \nespecially  recently  settled  dwellers,  are  the  most  vulnerable  to \ndisaster.  Lack  of  flood  protection  and  inadequate  drainage  lead  to \nwaterlogging  and  overflowing  of  sewerage  facilities,  especially \nlatrines,  and  cause  widespread  environmental  degradation  and \ndeplorable unsanitary living conditions.  \n \nThe  integrated  approach,  combining  river  protection  works  with \ndrainage and basic sanitation services, is appropriate for the urban \nareas  in  Bangladesh,  which  are  prone  to  frequent  river  flooding, \nparticularly  in  low-lying  areas  with  poor  drainage  systems.  In  the \nproject  design,  flood  protection  works  are  fully  integrated  with \nimprovement,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste \ndrainage  system \nmanagement to establish better environmental conditions and more \nhygienic living conditions for the poor in the slums. \n \nWhile  most  of  the  project  investments  will  be  directed  toward  the \nconstruction of infrastructure facilities for urban flood protection, the \nparticipating  towns  will  also  implement  the  Urban  Governance \nImprovement  Action  Program  (UGIAP)  which  was  originally \nintroduced  in  an  earlier  Asian  Development  Bank    (ADB)-assisted \nproject in six  key result areas,  four  for enhancing awareness and \nparticipation  of \nin  urban  planning  and \nimproving  accountability  and \nmanagement,  and \nlong-term \ntransparency \nsustainability  of  the  project  investments  will  depend  on  progress \nthat the project towns will make in managing their municipal affairs.  \n  \n\nin  municipal  administration.  The \n\nlocal  stakeholders \n\ntwo \n\nfor \n\n \n\n\fRationale \n\n \nObjectives  \n\niii \n\nThe  growth  potential  of  the  urban  sector  in  Bangladesh  is  severely \nundermined by frequent flooding. There are about 550 urban centers \nin  Bangladesh  and  many  of  them  suffer  from  severe  erosion  and   \ndestruction of  physical infrastructure  caused by  river flooding  and  \nwaterlogging.    Flooding    is    a    perennial    problem    and  the  urban \nareas  are  more  prone  to  economic  and  human  losses  due  to  their \nhigh  population  density  and  concentration      of      industrial      and     \ninvestments  sites.    While  the Government had wanted to address \nthe  problems  of  flooding  and  erosion  in  urban  areas  as  early  as  in \nthe  1970s,  no  major  investments  could  be  carried  out  due  to \nresource  constraints.  As  a  result,  the  urban  areas,  especially  the \nsecondary towns, have remained neglected. \n \nAfter the devastating floods of 1987 and 1988, the Government and \ndevelopment  partners  prepared  the  Flood  Action  Plan.  Under  the \nplan,  Dhaka  and  15  district  towns  were  identified  for  urban  flood \nprotection. ADB has already provided two loans to cover Dhaka and \n6  of  the  15  district  towns.  ADB's  intervention  proved  to  be  very \neffective, as evidenced during another massive flooding in 1998. The \nproposed Project will cover the remaining towns identified earlier. A \nfeasibility study for a third loan for urban flood protection is included \nunder the Project.  \n \nThe Project comprises four components:   \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii)  Component C: urban environmental improvement  \n(iv)  Component D: capacity building and implementation \n\nComponent A: flood protection works \nComponent B: urban drainage system improvement \n\nassistance \n\n \nComponent  A  will  consist  of  flood  protection  works  for  each  of  the \nselected towns. The works may be either new facilities or upgrade \nof  existing  ones.  Typically,  flood  protection  works  include  earthen \nflood  embankments,  reinforced  concrete  flood  walls,  drainage \nregulators,  and  river  training  or  bank  protection  works  including \ngroynes and revetments. \n \nComponent  B  will  comprise  improvements  to  the  existing  drainage \nworks. The main works will be construction of large lined drains and \nopen unlined drainage outfalls. Many small structures such as road \nculverts  and  bridges  will  be  constructed  throughout  the  drainage \nsystem. \n \nBased  on  the  very  positive  results  of  the  urban  environmental \nimprovement  works  under  the  previous  loan  (particularly  in  slum \nareas),  greater  emphasis  in  the  second  phase  is  placed  on \ncomponent  C,  which  aims  at  environmental  improvements  at  the \ntown \n(i)  a  solid  waste  management \nsubcomponent,  including  sanitary  landfill  sites  and  composting \nfacilities;  (ii) \nlatrines;  and  (iii)  slum \nimprovement activities. Road improvement works for small stretches \n \n\ninstallation  of  sanitary \n\nIt  comprises \n\nlevel. \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nconnecting  slums  and  solid  waste  disposal  facilities  are  also \nincluded in the respective subcomponents. \n \nComponent  D  includes  capacity  building  and  implementation \nassistance  for  (i)  project  management,  detailed  design  of  the \nvarious   investment   components   for   each   project town, and \nconstruction supervision and quality control of the works; (ii) support \nto urban governance improvement; and (iii) assistance to implement \nslum improvement activities under component C. A feasibility study \nis also proposed under component D to prepare the next phase of \nthe urban flood protection project in Bangladesh.   \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $128.88  million \nequivalent. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at $9.13 million, \nor about 7.08% of the total cost, including $2.01 million for interest \ncharge.  The  local  currency  cost  is  estimated  at  $119.75  million \nequivalent,  or  about  92.91%  of  the  total  cost,  including  duties  and \ntaxes of about $12.98 million. \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $80  million  equivalent \nfrom its Special Funds resources to cover 62.1% of the total project \ncost, including $71.31 million equivalent of the local currency cost. \nThe  OPEC  Fund  for  International  Development  will  provide  a  loan \nof  $15.0  million  to  cofinance  11.6%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The \nOPEC  Fund  loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  20  years  with  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  and  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  and  a \nservice  charge  of  1%.  A  domestic  contribution  of  $33.88  million \nequivalent is required. It will include $33.78 million equivalent from \nthe  Government,  and  $0.1  million  equivalent  from  the  project \nbeneficiaries. \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $80 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will have \na 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; interest charge \nof  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the Loan \nAgreement. \n \nUntil 31 December 2009 \n \n \n30 June 2009 \n \nExecuting  agencies  (EAs)  of  the  Project  will  be  the  Bangladesh \nWater  Development  Board  (BWDB)  under  the  Ministry  of  Water \nResources  (MOWR)  and  the  Local  Government  Engineering \nDepartment (LGED) under the Ministry of Local Government, Rural \nDevelopment and Cooperatives (MLGRDC). BWDB will be the lead \nEA.  \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n\fImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nv \n\nfor \n\nthe \n\nActual  implementation  of  component  A  and  a  small  part  of \ncomponent  B  will  be  undertaken  by  the  BWDB  field  divisions.  A \nproject implementation unit (PIU) will be established at each project \ntown,  headed  by \nrespective  executive  engineers  with \nsubdivisional  engineers,  sectional  officers,  and  work  assistants  as \nmembers. \n \nActual implementation of components B and C will be carried out by \nthe  project  towns  under  the  technical  supervision  and guidance of \nLGED.  A  PIU  for  each  project  town  will  be  established  in  the \nmunicipal  office  and  will  be  responsible \nthe  day-to-day \nimplementation  of \nthe  respective  physical  works.  LGED  will \ncoordinate centrally all activities of the nine PIUs through consultants \nand project management office (PMO) staff. \n \nGoods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement. Since the contracts for civil works will \nbe  small  and  widely  dispersed,  international  competitive  bidding \n(ICB) is not appropriate. Consequently, all civil works contracts will \nbe  procured  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding  among \nprequalified  contractors  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s \nprocurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Each  supply  contract \nfor equipment or materials estimated to cost $500,000 equivalent or \nmore  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  ICB,  and  those  costing  less \nthan the equivalent of $500,000 (other than minor items) but more \nthan  $100,000  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international \nshopping. Direct purchase procedures will be used for small or off-\nthe-shelf items valued at less than $100,000. \n \nConsulting services and implementation assistance at the field level \nare  required  to  facilitate  project  implementation  and  to  strengthen \nthe  institutional,  administrative,  and  financial  capacities  of  the \nproject  towns.  Consultants  and  field  workers  will  be  selected  and \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging  domestic  consultants.  In  total,  two  types  of  consulting \nservices  will  be  provided.  One  for  project  management  and \nengineering,  and  the  other  for  UGIAP  preparation.  Implementation \nassistance  at  the  field  level  will  be  provided  by  UGIAP  facilitators \nand  the  field  staff  for  the  slum  improvement  activities.    For  project \nmanagement and engineering, an international  consulting  firm will \nbe  engaged  to assist  BWDB,  LGED,  and the project towns. For \nthe  remaining \nindividual \nconsultants  will  be  hired.  A \ntotal  of  64  person-months  of \ninternational  and  3,303  person-months  of  domestic  inputs  will  be \nrequired for the Project \n \nPoverty  incidence  was  found  to  be  as  high as 40% of the sample \nhouseholds,  where  income  is  below  the  poverty  line  of  Tk44,410 \nper  year  (or  $65  per  month).  Households  in  hard  core  poverty \nsurvive  on  incomes of  less than  Tk36,345  per  year  (or  $53 per \n\nthree  sets  of  assistance,  domestic \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nmonth), concentrated in overcrowded slum and squatter areas, and \nliving  in  precarious  daily  hand-to-mouth  conditions.  Between  7% \nand  30%  of  the  households  in  hard  core  poverty  are  headed  by \nwomen.  Focus  group  discussions  strongly  underline  the  appeal  of \nthe  poor  for  employment  opportunities  and  decent  wages;  their \nemphasis is on the need to improve drainage for quicker clearance \nof rainwater and facilitation of normal movement during flooding to \nmitigate  the  loss  of  workdays.  Women  are  particularly  concerned \nabout shelter for themselves and  their animals, children\u2019s access to \nschools, as well as access to medicine and health care, especially \nduring  floods.  Poverty  reduction  has  been  made  as  a  strategic \nobjective  of  each  project  component,  with  the  view  to  maximizing \nemployment during construc tion, developing skills for operation and \nmaintenance (O&M), and building roads and making basic services \navailable  in  deprived  areas.  In  slums,  improved  access  to  water \nsupply,  sanitation,  solid  waste  disposal,  roads  and  footpaths, \nlighting, schools, and health care will be assured. \n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions  While  no  unusual  risk  is  foreseen  during  implementation,  the \npotential risks are (i) implementation delays due to slow progress of \nstart-up activities, such as engagement of consultants and filling up \nthe vacancies in PIUs; (ii) lack of suitably qualified personnel in the \nproject towns, which may eventually lead to weak implementation of \nthe  subproject  at  the  town  level;  (iii)  sustainability  of  the  facilities \nand  services  provided  under  the  Project;  and  (iv)  inadequate \ncoordination between the EAs. \n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nto  Bangladesh  for  the  Secondary  Towns  Integrated  Flood  Protection  Project  Phase  2,  and  (ii) \nproposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a loan to be provided by the \nOPEC Fund for International Development (OPEC Fund) for the Project.  \n \n2. \nThe  overall  project  framework  (Appendix  1)  summarizes  the  Project\u2019s  objectives, \nindicators to measure achievements, and assumptions that must be satisfied to avoid the risk of \nnoncompliance. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \nA. \n \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nUrban Flood Protection in Bangladesh \n\nHowever, frequent flooding severely undermines the growth potential of the urban sector.   \n\n \nAlthough  the  level  of  urbanization  in  Bangladesh  is  relatively  low  with  23%  of  the \n3. \npopulation  residing  in  urban  areas,  already  over  40%  of  the  country\u2019s  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP)\u2013\u2013from a low of 25% in the early 1970s\u2013\u2013is derived from the urban sector. The role of the \nurban  centers  as  the  engine  of  growth  is  clearly  recognized  in  the  Government\u2019s  latest  5-year \nplan documents, which projected that the urban sector GDP would grow at more than twice the \nrate of the national GDP.  \n \n4. \nThere are about 550 urban centers in Bangladesh and many of them suffer from severe erosion \nand destruction of physical infrastructure because of river flooding and water-logging. Flooding is \na perennial problem in Bangladesh and the urban areas are more prone to economic and human \nlosses due to their high population density and concentration of industrial and investment sites. \nWhile  the  Government  had  wanted  to  address  the  problems  of  flooding  and  erosion  in  urban \nareas  as  early  as  in  the  1970s,  no  concerted  major  investments  could  be  carried  out  due  to \nresource  constraints.  As  a  result,  the  urban  areas,  especially  the  secondary  towns,  remained \nneglected.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for  Bangladesh  highlights  the  strategic \nimportance  of  secondary  towns  in  the  urbanization  process,  and  the  need  to  promote  them  to \nlead  a  sound  and  balanced  urban  development.  The  Government's  Interim-Poverty  Reduction \nStrategy  Paper  (I-PRSP)1 also recognizes urban local bodies as one of the key instruments for \nensuring  improved  quality  and  enhanced  accountability  of  public  service  in  urban  areas.  The  I-\nPRSP  strongly  supports  capacity  building  at  the  local  level,  including  effective  participation  of \nwomen in local governance. As for flood protection, reduction of vulnerability to natural disaster is \nrecognized as an integral aspect of the national strategy for poverty reduction. \n \nThe  devastating  floods  of  1987  and  1988  were  a  reminder  to  all  concerned,  including \n5. \npolicy  makers  and  external  development  partners,  that  the  threats  of  severe  flooding  could  no \nlonger  be  left  unattended  (Appendix  2).  A  strong  consensus  was  formed  quickly  for  immediate \naction  in  a  concerted  manner.  A  year  later,  the  Government  and  the  international  community \ntogether formulated a comprehensive program, called the Flood Action Plan (FAP), to develop a \nsustained  solution  to  the  dangers  of  frequent  flooding.  The  FAP  comprised  26  activities  for \nphysical  investments,  technical  studies,  and  support  activities.  For  urban  flood  protection,  the \nFAP  identified  Dhaka  and  15  district  towns  to  be  supported  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n\n                                                 \n1   Government  of  Bangladesh.  2003.  A  National  Strategy  for  Economic  Growth,  Poverty  Reduction,  and  Social \n\nDevelopment. Dhaka. A full PRSP is expected to be completed by end-December 2004. \n\n\f2 \n\n(ADB). ADB provided two loans2 for urban flood protection to cover Dhaka and 6 of the 15 district \ntowns.  ADB's  intervention  proved  to  be  very  effective,  as  evidenced  during  another  massive \nflooding in 19983 (external assistance for urban flood protection is summarized in Appendix 3).  \n \n6. \nPrior  to  the  ADB  investments,  the  earlier  interventions  related  to  urban  flood  protection \nremained largely at master planning stage. Where actual investments were carried out, they were \nimplemented  by  various  agencies  on  an  ad  hoc  basis  without  proper  coordination.  In  fact, \npiecemeal efforts had generally been ineffective and, in some cases, inadvertently compounded \nthe  environmental  health  hazards.  Inadequate  drainage  resulted  in  polluted  waters  remaining \nstagnant in low-lying land (often densely populated slum areas) for long periods. Uncoordinated \ncollection  and  disposal  of  solid  waste  contributed  to  localized  flooding  due  to  clogged  drains. \nSimilarly,  inadequate  and  ineffective  excreta  management  led  to  high  levels  of  exposure  to \nwaterborne  pathogens  during  floods.  A  clear,  urgent  need  thus  emerged  to  integrate  flood \nprotection  works  with  other  infrastructure  and  environment  improvement  measures  in  selected \nhigh-priority  secondary  towns  to  maximize  impact.  Given  such  experience,  ADB  adopted  an \nintegrated approach where flood protection was combined with drainage, sanitation, solid waste \nmanagement, and slum development in one project. \n \n7. \nAlthough  implementation  of  ADB\u2019s  integrated  flood  protection  project  for  the  six  district \ntowns  was  delayed  by  2  years  due  to  unforeseen  natural  causes  and  political  events,  flood \nprotection  facilities  constructed  under  it  have  safely  withstood  annual  flood  seasons  since  then. \nMoreover,  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  reports  confirmed  that  the  total  beneficiaries \nexceeded  the  targets  set  during  project  appraisal.  The  respondents  in  both  slum  and  non-slum \nareas  cited  significant  direct  benefits  from  reduced  flood  damage,  including  improved  hygiene \nand a cleaner environment, and more efficient solid waste collection. Substantial indirect benefits \nwere also reported: better housing, higher land values, increased daily incomes, and reduction in \nillness  and  medical  costs.  The  project  also  provided  significant  construction  employment \nopportunities  for  the  local  poor,  and  livelihood  skills  training  for  women-led  community-based \nhandicraft industries. With this positive feedback, the Government and ADB agreed to complete \nthe flood protection facilities for the remaining nine towns that were left out from the first phase of \nthe project. \n \nHowever,  since  more  than  10  years  has  passed  from  the  selection  of  the  original  15 \n8. \ntowns,  it  was  necessary  under  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  second \nphase  to  update  flood  information  on  the  remaining  towns  and  reassess  the  need  for  ADB \nsupport  in  those  towns.  The  interministerial  meeting  held  on  1  December  2003  reviewed  the \nupdated  flood  information  and  decided  to  include  the  following  secondary  towns  in  the  second \nphase:  Brahmanbaria,  Gaibandha,  Jamalpur,  Kushtia,  Manikganj,  Munshiganj,  Mymensingh, \nRajshahi City Corporation (RCC), and Sunamganj.   \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n2. \n \n9. \nAll the towns under the Project are prone to river flooding, river erosion, waterlogging, and \nflash  floods.  The  poorer  income  groups,  especially  recently  settled  dwellers,  are  the  most \nvulnerable to disaster. Lack of flood protection and inadequate drainage lead to waterlogging and \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB. 1991.

When \nriver erosion is severe, water intrudes into the surrounding areas causing severe waterlogging. In \nKushtia, the lowlying area is regularly flooded because the existing embankment has deteriorated \nat several points. Without proper sewage and solid waste arrangements, the streets are littered \nwith rubbish and human excreta during floods.  \n \n11. \nOften  water  is  stagnant  for  2-3  months.  Inhabitants  wade  through  knee-  and  waist-deep \npolluted water to go about their daily activities. Women and children suffer most. Young children \nwho  play  in  the  polluted  waters  suffer  from  skin  ailments  and  waterborne  diseases.  With  little \nsanitation facilities in the best of times, during flooding and with mobility restricted even further, \nwomen  undergo  hardships  in  personal  hygiene  and  toilet  requirements.  With  no  sewerage \nfacilities,  overflowing  of  drains  especially  during  the  monsoons  poses  a  health  hazard.  Lack  of \nsolid waste management is a constant threat to the environment. The economic activities of the \npoor are often jeopardized due to floods, when they remain busy in protecting their belongings at \nthe cost of their employment. There is no ongoing flood or disaster preparedness program in the \nproject  towns.  During  the  focus  group  discussions,  women  slum  dwellers  requested  a  special \nprogram  to  flood-proof  houses,  and  to  generate  income,  and  measures  to  ensure  normal \nmovement year-round.   \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Lessons Learned from Phase 1 \n\nThe preparation of the phase 2 of the Project is firmly based on the lessons learned from \n12. \nphase 1.4 While many documents and reports have been prepared to fully or partially review the \nachievements  of  phase  1,  project  completion  reports  and  the  project  performance  audit  report \n(PPAR)5 are particularly important. The project preparatory TA also carried out a separate review \nand  consolidated  all  the  lessons  learned  to  incorporate  them  in  the  design  of  the  new  Project. \nWhile  the  Project  is  not  perceived  as  disaster  related,  it  has  significant  disaster  mitigating \nimplications. The Project will help reduce the incidence of future disaster related to flooding and \nlessen the demand for rehabilitation projects after disaster. As such, the design of the Project is in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, 2004.6  \n \n13. \nADB\u2019s  PPAR  by  the  Operations  Evaluation  Department  confirms  that  phase  1  of  the \nProject  has  achieved  its  main  objective.  Since  project  completion,  the  six  towns  have  been \nprotected  from  annual  floods.  Drainage  and  sanitation  facilities  have  reduced  the  incidence  of \nwaterborne  diseases.  Improvements  in  the  living  environment  as  a  consequence  of  the  project \nwere recognized by the majority of the respondents in all project towns. The slum improvement \ncomponent  directly  benefited  some  8,000  households  and  provided  a  greater sense of security \nand permanence within towns.      \n \n14. \nThe PPAR pointed out, however, that adequate operation and maintenance (O&M) of the \nproject assets is the main concern in the long term. It became evident that the project targets for \nrevenue  generation  and  O&M  were  too  ambitious,  while  not  much  support  was  provided  for \ncapacity  building  in  financial  management.  Considerable  problems  also  persisted  with  the \ninstitutional and administrative capacity of the urban municipalities for effective  provision of local \n                                                 \n4 Details of the project processing chronology is in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n5 ADB. 2003.

Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy.  Manila. \n\n\f4 \n\nsanitation  and  waste  management  services.  As  for  the  river  protection  facilities,  the  joint \nresponsibility  for  O&M  by  the  concerned  project  towns  and  Bangladesh  Water  Development \nBoard (BWDB) was found to be ineffective, indicating the need for a different approach for phase \n2.  Other key recommendations of the PPAR follow: (i) solid waste dump sites must be designed \nwith  proper  environmental  controls;  (ii)  slum  improvement,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste \nmanagement could be expanded in future projects; and (iii) where adequate O&M is unlikely to be \nprovided, the adoption of more expensive civil works should be considered.  \n \n15. \nIt is also noted that in Kurigram, one of the six towns in phase 1, 250 meters of revetment \nwas  engulfed  by  the  river  after  project  completion.  The  damage  was  extended  during  floods  in \nsubsequent  years.  The  incidence  of  very  costly  failures  like  this  in  Kurigram  could  have  been \navoided by increasing engineering investigations before and during detailed design.  The lessons \nlearned were incorporated in the design of phase 2.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nObjectives \n\n \nA. \n \n16. \nThe Project will promote economic growth and reduce poverty in nine selected towns by \nproviding  a  flood-free  and  secure  living  environment  within  the  framework  of  integrated  flood \nprotection.  The  integrated  approach,  combining  river  protection  works  with  drainage  and  basic \nmunicipal services, is appropriate for the urban areas in Bangladesh, which are prone to frequent \nriver  flooding,  particularly  in  low-lying  areas  with  poor  drainage  systems.  The  urban  sector \nremains a priority for ADB because it presents a greater opportunity for both pro-poor economic \ngrowth, as well as targeted poverty reduction, particularly at the secondary towns level.  \n \n17.  While  the  Project  will  benefit  the  entire  urban  community  in  the  project  towns,  some \ncomponents will focus on upgrading the conditions of the poorest and most needy groups in the \nslum  areas  in  particular.  Through  urban  governance  reforms  and  support  to  gender  and \ndevelopment  activities,  the  Project  will  also  promote  active  participation  of  women  citizens  in \nmunicipal management and services as both beneficiaries and agents. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n18. \n\nThe Project comprises four components:   \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nComponent A: flood protection works; \nComponent B: urban drainage system improvement; \nComponent C: urban environmental improvement; and  \nComponent D: capacity building and implementation assistance.  \n\n \nThese four components are basically identical to those included in phase 1 of the Project. \n19. \nThe lessons learned suggested that phase 2 should not depart from the previous project design \nbut  further  strengthen  the  focus  on  environmental  improvement  activities,  including  solid  waste \nmanagement,  low-cost  sanitation,  and  urban  poverty  reduction.  In  the  project  design,  flood \nprotection  works  are  fully  integrated  with  drainage  system  improvement,  sanitation,  solid  waste \nmanagement, and slum improvement to establish better environmental conditions, including more \nhygienic  living  conditions  for  all  the  people  of  the  towns.  Major  engineering  works  involved  in \nflood control and drainage improvement activities in the towns will be planned with the people\u2019s \nparticipation to minimize adverse social and environmental impacts.  \n \n \n \n\n\f5 \n\n1. \n\nComponent A: Flood Protection Works \n\n \n20. \nThis component will consist of flood protection works for each of the selected towns. The \nworks may be either new facilities or upgrade of existing ones. Typically, flood protection works \ninclude  earthen  flood  embankments,  reinforced  concrete  flood  walls,  drainage  regulators,  and \nriver training or bank protection works including groynes and revetments.  \n\n \n2. \n\nComponent B: Urban Drainage System Improvement \n\n \nComponent  B  will  comprise  improvements  to  the  existing  drainage  works  in  each  town. \n21. \nThe  work  will  aim  to  reduce  nuisance  flooding  in  low-lying  urban  areas  and  improve \nenvironmental  conditions  generally  by  removing  polluted  storm  water,  which  can  be  a  health \nhazard as it is a source of waterborne diseases as well as a breeding ground for mosquitoes.  \n \n22. \nThe main works require the construction of large lined drains and open unlined drainage \noutfalls.  Many  small  structures  such  as  road  culverts  and  bridges  are  required throughout the \ndrainage system. In addition, there is a demand for slabs to cover existing concrete drains, which \nare a safety hazard for small children and the elderly.      \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent C: Urban Environmental Improvement \n\n \nBased on the very positive results of the environmental improvements works under phase \n23. \n1 (particularly in slum areas), greater emphasis in phase 2 is placed on component C, which aims \nat  environmental  improvements  at  the  secondary  towns  level.  Component  C  comprises  the \nfollowing subcomponents: (i) solid waste management, (ii) sanitation improvement, and (iii) slum \nimprovement.  Road  improvement  works  for  small  stretches  connecting  slums  and  solid  waste \ndisposal facilities are included in the respective subcomponents.  \n \n24. \nThe  solid  waste  management  subcomponent  will  establish  solid  waste  dump  sites  with \nadequate  controls  (including  sanitary  landfill  sites)  in  each  project  town  except  Manikganj; \nbuilding  a  pilot  composting  facility  in  RCC;  demolishing  and  disposing  of dustheaps, improving \ncollection facilities and establishing solid waste transfer stations, providing mechanical sweeping \nequipment for RCC on a pilot basis, and providing strainers for collecting solid waste from drains \nand transport, including rickshaws, pushcarts, garbage trucks, and bulldozers. \n \n25. \nThe sanitation improvement subcomponent will provide about 13,200 sanitary latrines and \nabout  22  public  toilets.  In  addition,  unhygienic  latrines  will  be  converted  into  sanitary  latrines.7 \nAppropriate  O&M  of  latrines,  including  regular  cleaning  of  the  facilities,  is  critical  for  project \nsustainability.  Town  authorities  will  engage  sufficient  manpower  and  water  supply  for  cleaning \npublic toilets several times a day. A sanitation management plan will  be prepared for each of the \nnine towns addressing, among others, O&M. \n \n26. \nThe  slum  improvement  subcomponent  will  provide  basic  infrastructure  facilities  for \nsanitation,  drainage,  footpaths,  water  supply,  and  street  lighting  for  Brahmanbaria,  Gaibandha, \nJamalpur,  Munshiganj,  and  Sunamganj.  The  remaining  four  towns  are  covered  under  other \nprograms  supported  by  either  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  or  ADB.8 \nThis  subcomponent  will  be  operated  based  on  a  model  developed  under  UNDP\u2019s  Local \nPartnerships  for  Urban  Poverty  Alleviation  (LPUPA)  program,  where,  on  the  basis  of  a \n                                                 \n7  For the low-cost sanitation component, beneficiaries will take out loans for 50% of the cost of the household toilets \nfrom the revolving fund to be set up by the project towns. This will be repaid every fortnight over a 10-month period at \nthe annual interest rate of 7%. The remaining 50% of the cost will be borne by the beneficiaries. \n\n8  Three towns under the Project\u2013Kushtia, Mymensingh, and Rajshahi\u2013have been supported by UNDP. Manikganj is \n\nbeing covered by the urban poverty reduction component under UGIIP. \n\n\f6 \n\nCommunity Action Plan, the communities access resources from a community development fund \nfor improving basic infrastructure in the slums. This approach is presently followed by LGED. In \naddition, the LPUPA program has a poverty alleviation fund and a component on strengthening \nlocal governments, both of which will also be replicated in this Project.  \n \n\n4. \n\nComponent D: Capacity Building and Implementation Assistance \n\nSpecial Features \n\n27. \nThe capacity building subcomponent is introduced in phase 2. The long-term sustainability \nof the municipal components, including the drainage and solid waste management facilities, will \nbe at risk unless the capacities of the participating project towns are substantially improved during \nproject  implementation.  At  present,  the  participating  towns  lack  the  capacity  to  assume  the \nadditional  responsibilities  for  managing  the  new  assets  to  be  created  under  the  Project. \nConsiderable  problems  also  persist  regarding  the  institutional,  organizational,  and  financial \ncapacity of the project towns to provide effective municipal services.  \n \n28. \nComponent D includes consulting services to assist the project management office (PMO) \nat the central level and the project implementation units (PIUs) at the town level in (i) developing \nwork  procedures  for  project  management,  preparing  detailed  designs  of  the  various  investment \ncomponents for each project town, and providing construction supervision and quality  control of \nthe  works;  (ii)  supporting  urban  governance  improvement  under  the  UGIAP;  and  (iii)  helping \nimplement slum improvement activities in component C. Component D will also have a feasibility \nstudy  to  prepare  phase  3  of  the  Project.  The  feasibility  study will comprise two parts: part 1 for \nselecting  new  towns,  and  part  2  for  overall  feasibility  study  of  new  investments  including \nengineering,  social,  environmental,  economic,  and  financial  aspects.  Incremental  staffing  costs \nand expenses are included in component D. \n \nC. \n \n29.  While  most  of  the  project  investments  will  be  directed  toward  the  construction  of \ninfrastructure  facilities  for  urban  flood  protection,  its  success  in  the  long  term  depends  on \nprogress  that  the  project  towns  make  in  managing  their  municipal  affairs.  Recently, under the \nADB-assisted  Urban  Governance  and  Infrastructure  Improvement  Project  (UGIIP), 9  the \nGovernment  introduced  a  participatory  approach  to  assist  urban  local  bodies  to  improve  their \nmanagement and performance. Under the UGIIP, in exchange for receiving financial assistance \nfrom ADB, the participating municipalities entered into a formal agreement with the Government \nto  implement  the  Urban  Governance  Improvement  Action  Program  (UGIAP)  in  five  key  result \nareas:  three  for  enhancing  awareness  and  participation  of  local  stakeholders  in  urban  planning \nand management (citizen awareness and participation, women\u2019s participation, and integration of \nthe urban poor) and two for improving accountability and transparency in municipal administration \n(financial accountability and sustainability, and administrative transparency). Under these action \nareas,  secondary  towns  are  assisted  with  forming  town-level  citizen  committees,  developing \nparticipatory municipal development plans, strengthening the role of female ward commissioners, \nimplementing  a  slum  improvement  program,  and  operating  community-level  funds  for  income \ngeneration  and  infrastructure  improvement.  The  project  towns  will  also  implement  a  similar \nUGIAP  with  increased  emphasis  on  urban  environmental  improvement  that  includes  regular \ncleaning  of  municipal  drainages  by  the  community,  organizing  an  awareness  campaign  for \nsanitation  and  solid  waste  management,  and  converting  all  latrines  into  sanitary  latrines. \nAdministrative  and  technical  support  for  effective  implementation  of  these  activities  will  be \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2002.

The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years with a grace period of 8 years, and \nan  interest  rate  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund will provide a loan of $15.0 million \nto jointly finance 11.6% of the total project cost. The OPEC Fund loan will have a maturity of 20 \nyears  with  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  and  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  and  a  service \ncharge  of  1%.  In  the  event  that  cofinancing  from  the  OPEC  Fund  cannot  be  obtained  within  6 \nmonths of the effective date, the Borrower will take all necessary and appropriate steps to make \nthrough  either  budget  allocations  or  other \nother  arrangements \narrangements  acceptable  to  ADB.  If  such  arrangements  cannot  be  made,  the  Government  and \nADB will agree on the components or activities under the Project to be scaled down. \n \nADB\u2019s financing of the local currency expenditure is justified by the nature of the Project, \n32. \nwhich will improve the living and health conditions of the people in the project areas by preventing \ndamage to property and disruption of lives caused by flooding.

The Executing Agencies (EAs) of the Project will be \nBWDB  under  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  (MOWR)  and  Local  Government  Engineering \nDepartment  (LGED)  under  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural  Development  and \nCooperatives  (MLGRDC)  with  BWDB  as  the  lead  EA.  An  interministerial  project  steering \ncommittee (IPSC) will be established at MOWR with members drawn from MLGRDC; Ministry of \nLand, Ministry of Environment and Forests; Economic Relations Division and Finance Division of \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance;  Implementation,  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Division  of  Ministry  of \nPlanning;  Planning  Commission  (Irrigation  and  Physical  Infrastructure  Division);  Ministry  of \nWomen  and  Children  Affairs;  BWDB;  LGED;  and  Department  of  Environment,  and  Water \nResources Planning Organization. Representatives from ADB, OPEC, and the project towns will \nparticipate in the IPSC meeting as observers. The MOWR Secretary will chair the meeting. The \nIPSC will first meet within 2 months from the date of loan effectiveness; thereafter it will meet at \nleast  once  a  year  to  provide  overall  coordination  and  guidance,  or  whenever  an  urgent  issue \nrequiring interministerial coordination arises.  \n \n34. \nThere  will  be  two  PMOs,  one  under  BWDB  and  another  under  LGED.  For  effective \ncoordination, however, the two PMOs will be set up in one location, mutually agreeable to the two \nEAs.  BWDB  will  be  responsible  for  executing  of  component  A  and  LGED  for  components  B \n(excluding natural drainage channels) and C through the respective local bodies. Component D \nwill be executed by both BWDB and LGED, with BWDB as lead agency.  The PMO of BWDB will \nbe headed by a superintending engineer while the PMO of LGED will be headed by a senior-level \nengineer. The two engineers will be full-time project directors (PDs) assisted by requisite human \nresources  and  consultants.  The  PMOs  will  (i)  coordinate  with  other  agencies  concerned,  (ii) \nprepare  an  overall  implementation  plan  and  annual  budget,  (iii)  maintain  financial accounts, (iv) \nprepare  periodic  reports,  (v)  assist  the  project  towns  in  implementing  of  UGIAP,  (vi)  organize \nM&E  activities,  and  (vii)  implement  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  and  activities  under  the  poverty \nreduction action plan (PRAP).  \n \n35. \nThe  PMOs  will  be  assisted  by  management,  design  and  supervision  (MDS)  consultants \nduring the entire period of implementation. PD-BWDB will supervise the activities of consultants \nfor  component  A.  The  consultants  for  components  B  and  C  will  work  under  the  guidance and \nsupervision  of  the  PD-LGED.  For  effective  coordination,  a  project  management  team  (PMT) \ncomprising the two PDs and, the team leader and the deputy team leader of the MDS consultants \nwill  be  formed.  The  PMT  will  prepare  programs  for  all  project  components  to  keep  linkages  at \nleast between the works under components A and B and also monitor implementation of overall \nprogress.  The  PMT,  convened  by  BWDB,  will  meet  as  frequently  as  required  to  discuss  the \n\n\f9 \n\nprogress of all activities and problems so that  both  PDs  are  fully  informed  of  all  aspects  of  the \nProject. \n \n36. \nCoordination  at  the  Town  Level.  A  town-level  project  coordination  committee  will  be \nformed  within  3  months  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  coordination  committee  for  RCC  will  be \nheaded  by  the  mayor  of  RCC  and  draw  members  from  BWDB  (executive  engineer  and  sub-\ndivisional engineers); heads of engineering, revenue, health and conservation sections of RCC; \nadditional deputy commissioner (Land); the executive engineer of LGED; a representative of the \nregional  UMSU;  representatives  from  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  community-\nbased organizations (CBOs); and chief executive officer as member secretary. The coordination \ncommittee for each of the eight other towns will be headed by the town's chairperson and include \nmembers from BWDB (executive engineers and subdivisional engineers); heads of engineering, \nhealth  and  revenue  sections  of  the  towns;  additional  deputy  commissioner  (Land);  executive \nengineer  of  LGED;  a  representative  of  the  regional  UMSU;  representatives  from  NGOs  and \nCBOs;  and  the  chief  executive  officer  as  member  secretary.  The  committee  will  provide  overall \nguidance to the PIUs as required. Implementation arrangements are in Appendix 5.  \n \nImplementation  of  the  Flood  Protection  Component.  Actual  implementation  of \n37. \ncomponent A and a small part of component B (natural drainage channels) will be undertaken by \nthe BWDB field divisions through an established chain of command of zonal chief engineers and \nsuperintending  engineers.  The  BWDB  PIU  for  each  town  will  be  headed  by  the  respective \nexecutive  engineer  with  subdivisional  engineers,  sectional  officers,  and  work  assistants  as \nmembers. The executive engineers will be responsible to the PD so far as the execution of the \nProject is concerned. No additional human resources are required for the BWDB PIUs except for \none  computer  operator.  However,  if  there  is  a  vacant  position,  BWDB  need  to  fill  the  positions \nbefore  the  Project  starts.  The  BWDB  PIUs  will  also  implement  the  resettlement  plans  in \naccordance  with  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan,  and  will  coordinate  closely  with  the \nmunicipal PIUs through the town-level project coordination committee. \n \n38. \nImplementation of the Municipal Components. Actual implementation of components B \nand C will be carried out by the project towns under the technical supervision and guidance of the \nPMO-LGED.  At  a  few  sites,  however,  improvement  of  natural  drainage  channels  outside  the \nmunicipal  boundaries  will  be  undertaken  by  BWDB.  The  municipal  PIU,  located  within  the \nmunicipal office, will be responsible for the day-to-day implementation of the respective physical \nworks. LGED will coordinate centrally all the activities of the nine town PIUs through consultants \nand PMO staff. For close supervision of all physical works including environmental activities, the \nregional  superintending  engineer  of  LGED  will  be  empowered  to  carry  out  regular  supervision, \nmonitoring, and reporting on all project implementation activities to the PMO -LGED. The quality of \nconstruction  materials  will  be  ensured  with  the  help  of  LGED\u2019s  district  laboratory  (or  other \nqualified  institution).  The  PMO -LGED  will  be  responsible  for  procuring  vehicles  and  equipment \ncentrally for components B and C, and arrange the deputation of the necessary engineering staff \nto PIUs from either internal resources or new recruitment.  \n \n39. \nEach municipal PIU will have three sections: (i) infrastructure improvement section (IIS), \n(ii) environmental sanitation and slum improvement Section (ESSIS), and (iii) urban governance \nimprovement  section  (UGIS).  To  be  more  specific,  the  engineering  section  (IIS)  will  undertake \ninfrastructure development (drainage) works, and ESSIS will implement all sanitation, solid waste \nmanagement,  and  slum  improvement  works.  The  UGIS  will  be  responsible  for  implementing \nUGIAP. The PIUs will be headed by the town chairperson, assisted by the chief executive officer \nfor day-to-day operations of the Project. IIS will be led by the head of the engineering department \nof the concerned project town and ESSIS will be headed by the health officer. Additional technical \nstaff may be deputed from LGED to support the municipal engineer. UGIS will be headed by the \n\n\f10 \n\ntown  secretary.  For  RCC,  the  PIU  will  be  headed  by  the chief executive officer and comprise \nthree section heads: chief engineer for IIS, chief health officer for ESSIS, and secretary for IIGIS.  \nEach  PIU  will  also  have  an  accounting  section  under  the  secretary  to  deal  with  procedural \naspects,  record  financial  transactions  and  prepare  liquidation  statements  and  replenishment \nrequests to the PMO. At the beginning of the Project, training in civil works, slum improvement, \nsanitation, and regular administrative responsibilities for the PIU staff will be organized.   \n \n40. \nThe PIUs will be responsible for (i) preparing an annual development program (ADP) and \nthe  annual  budget  for  the  municipal  components;  (ii)  tendering  and  awarding  contracts;  (iii) \nexecuting  physical  works;  (iv)  implementing  the  GAP,  the  PRAP,  and  the  UGIAP;  (v)  preparing \nthe  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  the  Project  Resettlement  Plan;  and  (vi)  accounting  for \nproject expenditures. \n  \n \n41.  \nImplementation  of  Slum  Improvement.  The  mechanism  developed  by  UNDP  for  the \nLPUPA  program  will  be  adopted  in  the  Project.  The  approach  is  as  follows.  Community \norganization and empowerment start with the formation of primary groups of 20 families who then \nform  community  development  committees  (CDCs)  representing  200-300  families.  CDCs  are \nformed into clusters of 6-12 CDCs and in each town CDC Federation is introduced. The project \nactivities are managed by a small central management team in Dhaka and a group of 8-10 staff \nbased  in  each  town.  The  subcomponent  has  three  parts,  namely,  (i)  community  development \nfund,  (ii)  poverty  reduction  fund,  and  (iii)  community  empowerment  and  strengthening  of  the \ncapability  of  the  local  governments.  Most  project  activities  are  undertaken  by  the  communities \nwith strong links to the respective local government bodies through their elected representatives \nand officials. The project staff plays mainly a facilitating role.  \n \n \n42. \nImplementation of UGIAP.  The national UMSU in Dhaka has already been established \nand  is  at  present  headed  by  a  full-time  director  at  the  level  of  superintending  engineer.  Three \ndeputy  directors  assist  the  director  in  managing  the  following  sections,  namely  (i)  governance \nprogram  development,  (ii)  general  administration  and  training  coordination,  and  (iii)  database \ndevelopment  and performance evaluation and monitoring. Ten regional UMSUs have also been \nset  up  at  the  offices  of  the  regional  superintending  engineers.  Adequate  human  resources  and \noperational  budget  have  been  provided  for  activities  under  the  UGIAP.  The  national  and  seven \nregional UMSUs located at Comilla, Dhaka, Khulna, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet \nwill  assist  in  implementing  the  UGIAP  as  adopted  in  the  nine  project  towns  (Appendix  6). \nAdditional  human  resources  and  financial  resources  will  be  required  for  UMSUs  to  cover  the \nactivities of the Project. So additional staff and operating budget have been included for UGIAP \nimplementation. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n43. \nThe Project will be implemented over a period of 5 years beginning in April 2005. Physical \ncompletion is expected by June 2009 and loan closing date on 31 December 2009. Government\u2019s \nstart-up  activities,  such  as  preparing  the  project  proformas,  establishing  PMOs,  and  recruiting \nconsultants  should  be  completed  in  the  first  quarter  of  2005.  To  take  up  physical  work  in  the \nsecond  half  of  2005,  ADB  may  help  the  Government  with  advance  action  for  recruiting \nconsultants and procurement. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n44. \nThe Project will have two types of procurement, one for goods and the other for civil works \n(construction).  Goods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  and  the  OPEC  Fund  will  be  procured  in \n\n\f11 \n\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Given the small individual contracts for civil \nworks  in  a  scattered  area  and  to  be  executed  over  5  years,  individual  contracts  are  unlikely  to \nattract  international  bidders.  So  all  the  civil  work  contracts  will  be  executed  by  domestic \ncontractors. Local contractors have the capacity to carry out the civil works. To ensure quality, the \nEAs  will  award  civil  works  contracts  to  pre-qualified  contractors  following  Government  local \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  and  the  OPEC  Fund.  PIUs  under  the \nguidance  of  the  PMO  will  carry  out  procurement  for  civil  works  only.  To  expedite  project \nimplementation,  advance  action  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  will  be \nundertaken  for  (i)  prequalifying  contractors,  and  (ii)  preparing  tender  documents.  The \nGovernment, BWDB, and LGED were advised that approval of advance action does not commit \nADB to finance the Project. \n \n45. \nEfforts  will  be  made  to  limit  the  number  of  contract  packages  and  engage  larger \nprofessional contractors so as to shorten the construction period and ensure single accountability \nfor  the  quality  of  work.  The  contract  packages  for  BWDB  and  RCC  (components  A  and  B)  will \nhave a minimum value of Tk30 million. Contract packages for component B will have a minimum \nvalue of Tk3 million. The contract packages for component C may have a minimum value of Tk2 \nmillion  for  RCC  and  Tk1.5  million  for  the  other  towns.  The  MDS  consultants  will  be  involved  in \npreparing all procurement packages and evaluating for contract awards of packages a valued at \nTk30 million and above for BWDB and RCC and Tk3 million for the project towns. \n \n46. \nProcurement  packages  for  goods  are  unlikely  to  exceed  $500,000.  So  most  of  the \nprocurement will fall under ADB\u2019s international shopping procedures. Direct purchase procedures \nwill be used for small or off-the-shelf items valued at less than $100,000. The PMOs will procure \nequipment.  Advance  action  for  procurement  of  equipment  and  vehicles  will  be  required  to \nfacilitate the start-up of project implementation. Indicative procurement packages are in Appendix \n8. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services and Implementation Assistance  \n\n47. \nConsulting  services  and  implementation  assistance  in  the  field  will  facilitate  project \nimplementation  and  strengthen  the  institutional,  administrative,  and  financial  capacities  of  the \nproject  towns.  Consultants  and  field  workers  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  the  ADB  and  Its  Borrowers  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  In  total,  two  sets  of \nconsulting  services  will  be  provided  under  the  Project:  one  for  project  management  and \nengineering services, and the other for UGIAP preparation. Implementation assistance in the field \nwill  be  provided  by  the  UGIAP  facilitators  and  the  field  workers  for  the  slum  improvement \nactivities.  An international consulting firm will be engaged for the MDS consultants to assist the \nPMO  and  PIUs.  For  the  remaining  three  sets  of  assistance,  domestic  individual  consultants  will \nbe hired. The Project will require 64 person-months of international and 3,303 person-months of \ndomestic inputs (Appendix 9). \n \n48. \nBWDB will recruit the MDS consultants and LGED will participate in evaluating them. The \nMDS consultants will be located in one place to have better coordination and interaction among \nthem  and  to  allow  the  team  leader  and  deputy  team  leader,  to  have  effective  control  on  their \nactivities.  The  MDS  consultants  will  provide  overall  project  management  support;  and  arrange \nsubcontracts  for  field  engineering  surveys,  detailed  resettlement  surveys,  and  geotechnical \ninvestigations, including hydraulic modeling.  They will prepare detailed engineering designs, cost \nestimates, and tender documents. They will also regularly supervise, monitor progress and quality \nof  works,  and  oversee  resettlement  actions.  The  team  leader  (in  his  absence,  the  deputy  team \nleader) will have overall responsibility for the management of consulting services. \n\n\f12 \n\n \nFor  implementing  of  the  UGIAP,  LGED  will  recruit  governance  improvement  consultants \n49. \nand  UGIAP  facilitators,  as  individual  consultants  through  a  competitive  procedure  acceptable  to \nADB.  The  consultants  will  work  closely  with  their  counterparts  at  UMSU  and  the  project  towns. \nThey will prepare training programs, training materials, and modules to assist the project towns to \nachieve  the  targets  under  the  UGIAP  as  adopted.  Field  workers  for  the  slum  improvement \nactivities will be engaged by LGED. \n \n\n5. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n50. \nThe  land  acquisition  and  other  resettlement  impacts of the Project will not be significant \ndespite the large number of affected persons (APs). According to the census undertaken during \nthe  TA,  10,228  persons  will  be  affected  by  the  Project;  8,443  by  the  river  protection  works  and \n1,785 by the drainage improvement works. These are mainly informal dwellers who do not have \nany  land  titles  to  the  property  that  they  currently  occupy.  These  people  will  need  to  move \ntemporarily to allow construction to proceed, but they will stay close to the present locations and \nretain  their  existing  sources  of  livelihood  as  well  as  social  bonds.  They  will  thus  be  saved  from \ntotal disruption that is so common with relocation to distant locations.  \n \n51. \nThe temporary removal of APs, however, will trigger resettlement safeguards. All APs are \nentitled to compensation packages elaborated in the entitlement matrix of the resettlement plan \nsummary10 (Appendix 10). During socioeconomic surveys and a census of all potentially affected \ncommunities, APs expressed their willingness to self-relocate. The Project will assist them when \nthey  relocate  as  stated  in  the  resettlement  plan.  The  plan  was  disclosed  to  all  APs  during \nstakeholder  consultations  and  will  be  posted  in  BWDB,  LGED  and  ADB  web  sites.  The  Project \nwill  not  have  any  impacts  on  indigenous  people  since  there  are  no  indigenous  people  in  the \nproject towns. \n \n\n6. \n\nSolid Waste Management Activities \n\n52. \nTo  prevent  unhygienic  conditions  currently  faced  in  most  cities,  dustheaps  will  be \ndemolished  and  CBOs  and  NGOs  will  implement  door-to-door collection of solid waste. New or \nimproved  facilities  for  solid  waste  collection  will  be  provided.  Waste  segregation  will  take  place \nmostly at the collection stage. Garbage trucks will park at transfer stations on schedule, liaise with \nsolid  waste  collection  facilities,  and  transport  waste  to  solid  waste  dump  sites  with  adequate \nenvironmental  controls  or  sanitary  landfill  sites.  These  sites  will  be  provided  with  suitable \nimpervious lining, and leachate collection will take place in purposely built, lined leachate ponds. \nLeachate  tanks  will  be  provided  to  allow  for  leachate  decay  before  arranging  for  final  safe \ndisposal. It is proposed that the entire solid waste management cycle (collection, transportation, \nsegregation,  reuse,  disposal,  and,  where  relevant,  recycling)  be  operated  through  either  (i) \npartnerships  where  the  municipalities  own  the  facilities  and  CBOs  operate  them,  or  (ii)  micro \nenterprises where CBOs both own and operate solid waste management services. The issue will \nbe explored in the solid waste management plans to be formulated for each project town. Public \nawareness and capacity to operate such schemes will be provided by the UMSU. \n \n\n7. \n\nOperation and Maintenance  \n\n53. \n  Asset  owners  are  responsible  for  providing  adequate  O&M  funding  and  ensuring  that \nmaintenance  staff  regularly  inspect  the  infrastructure  facilities,  identify  potential  problems,  and \nimplement  remedial  measures.  Maintenance  activities  are  generally  divided  into  three  types: \n\n                                                 \n10 A full land acquisition and resettlement plan is included in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\n\f13 \n\nroutine or preventive maintenance, periodic maintenance, and emergency maintenance. BWDB is \nrequired  to  prepare  field  manuals  for  the  three  types  for  the  flood  protection  works  constructed \nunder  the  Project.  For  routine  and  periodic  maintenance,  BWDB  may  engage  labor  contracting \nsocieties,  including  poor  women,  for  earthwork  and  tree  planting  activities  on  embankments. \nWhile BWDB is responsible for O&M of all flood protection infrastructure in the country, it has no \nauthority  to  impose  any  kind  of  surcharge,  levy,  or  fee  for  maintenance  of  the  flood  protection \nsystem including natural drainage outside the municipal boundary. Instead BWDB receives O&M \nfunding from the Government of Bangladesh under the ADP, which is often inadequate even for \nroutine maintenance. In reality, O&M funding is not just a project-related issue but part of a much \nwider  issue  involving  the  capacity  of  the  Government  to  meet  the  O&M  requirement  of  all \nexternally aided and government-funded projects.  The Government and ADB will closely monitor \nthe level of O&M funding at both project and national levels and ensure a phasing -in of increased \nallocations  to  gradually  meet  actual  requirements.  In  the  medium  term,  the  Government  may \nconsider  the  option  to  allow  BWDB  to  impose  a  levy  or  fee,  or  share  the  O&M  costs  for  flood \ncontrol  and  drainage  projects  with  the  beneficiaries.  In  addition,  if  adequate  O&M  funding  is \nunlikely to be realized in the sector, the review will prepare a modified model for O&M where the \nloan  funds  will  be  used  for  O&M  with  counterpart  contribution  from  the  Government.  For  this \npurpose,  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  status  of  O&M  funding  will  be  undertaken  to  make \nrecommendations to ADB and the Government under the proposed feasibility study for the next \nphase of investments.  \n \n54. \nThe project towns will be responsible for O&M of municipal works including the drainage \nsystem. Simple O&M manuals prepared under the earlier urban projects financed by ADB will be \nadopted  for  use  by  PIUs.  These  manuals,  which  describe  the  O&M  procedures  for  municipal \ninfrastructure, services, and facilities, will be for the use of municipal engineering staff. The PMO \nconsultants will train all relevant staff of the project towns in O&M of infrastructure facilities. One \nof the tasks of the institutional strengthening consultants will be to define for each town the O&M \nrequirements and make a realistic assessment of the costs involved. The consultants will use the \nmanuals  and  on-the-job  training  to  ensure  that  the  staff  in  the  project  towns  are  made  familiar \nwith the O&M responsibilities and requirements. The only way to secure an adequate budget for \nsustainable maintenance is to raise tax and nontax revenues of the towns. During phase 1 of the \nProject,  compliance  with  the  loan  covenants  on  improving  financial  performance  was  not \nsatisfactory.  The  proposed  action  plan  for  financial  management  improvement  was  poorly \nimplemented.    Considering  these  lessons,  ADB  and  the  Government  agreed  to  resolve  the \nchronic problem of poor financial performance by introducing institutionalized capacity building for \nbetter  financial  management  under  the  UGIIP.  At  the  same  time,  the  national  committee  was \nformed  to  review  policy-related  issues  for  overall  municipal  management  including  barriers  to \nmunicipal resource mobilization. Under the  Project, the UGIAP requires the participating project \ntowns to set aside at least 20% equivalent of the ADP for O&M each year.  \n \nIn  February  2004,  the  committee  on  urban  local  governments  (CULG)  was  established \n55. \nwith  assistance  from  ADB.11 It will,  among  others,  review  the  existing  holding  tax  system  in  the \ncountry to suggest reforms for improving the collection of the holding taxes. The committee will \nalso make recommendations for amending the 1977 Pourashava Ordinance to reflect the needs \nfor improved local governance and better urban management. The Project is expected to benefit \nfrom policy changes in these new initiatives. \n \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to Bangladesh for Supporting Urban Governance Reform. Manila. \n\n\f14 \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n56. \nSoon after loan effectiveness, four commercial bank accounts\u2014two  for each EA (for the \nADB and OPEC funds of each)\u2014will be established at designated commercial banks acceptable \nto ADB. The PDs will operate the accounts. The statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure will \nbe  adopted  to  facilitate  reimbursement  and  liquidation  of  small  contracts. The imprest account \nand  the  SOE  procedure  will  be  established,  maintained,  and  audited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook.  The  initial  advance  to  the  imprest  account  will  be  limited  to  6 \nmonths of estimated ADB and OPEC-financed project expenditures, or 10% of each loan amount, \nwhichever is lower. The SOE procedure is applicable to individual payments below $50,000. \n \n57. \nBWDB. BWDB has a very streamlined and well-defined disbursement procedure. There is \nno need to modify the procedure as it is working well. Regional accounting centers (RAC) were \ncreated  and  authorized  to  make  payments  to  contractors  after  getting  the  bills  from  engineers. \nBills  prepared  by  the  sectional  officers  are  further  checked  and  initialed  by  the  sub-divisional \nengineer.  The  executive  engineer  forwards  the  bills  to  the  RAC  for  payment  to  the  contractors \nafter  the  project  consultants  have  certified  the  work  for  quality  control  and  specifications.  After \nreviewing the bills, the RAC makes payment to the contractor in three cheques (ADB, OPEC, and \nGovernment  contribution  separately)  or  may  make  one  payment  from  the  government \ncontribution and transfer the proportionate amount of funds on a periodic basis from the imprest \naccounts of the ADB and OPEC loans.       \n \n58. \nRAC prepares the withdrawal application (W/A) for replenishment of fund following ADB\u2019s \nSOE  procedures  and  submits  the  same  to  the  PD  for  onward  transmission  to  ADB  for \ndisbursement.      \n\n \n\n \n\n59. \nRCC. The present staff strength is not enough for making quick payments to contractors \nand claiming reimbursement from ADB. The Project has provided incremental human resources \nto strengthen capability. Bills are normally prepared by the sub-assistant engineer and submitted \nto  assistant  engineers  for  checking.  The  assistant  engineers  sign  and  submit  the  bill  to  the \nexecutive engineer. The executive engineer after obtaining certification on quality control from the \nconsultants, signs and forwards the bill to the chief engineer. The chief engineer submits the bill \nto  the  accounts  section  through  chief  executive  officer.  The  accounts  section  prepares  three \ncheques (ADB, OPEC, and Government contribution) and submits them to chief executive officer/ \nmayor  for  signature,  or  may  make  one  payment  from the Government contribution and transfer \nthe proportionate amount of funds on a periodic basis from the imprest accounts of the ADB and \nOPEC loans.       \n \n60. \nAfter  payment,  the  accounts  section  prepares  W/A  based  on  SOE  procedures  and \nsubmits it for the chief engineer\u2019s signature. The chief executive officer forwards the W/A to PD of \nLGED for submission to ADB. \n \n\n61. \nProject Towns. The chairperson of the project town exercises all power to administer the \nfunctions of the town. The sub-assistant engineer prepares a bill. The assistant engineer checks, \nsigns  and  forwards  the  bill  to  the  executive  engineer.  The  executive  engineer  obtains  the \ncertificate of quality control from the consultants, countersigns and forwards the bill and certificate \nto  the  accounts  section.  This  section  prepares  three  cheques  (ADB,  OPEC,  and  Government \ncontribution) for joint signature by the chief executive officer and the chairperson, or may make \none  payment  from  the  Government  contribution  and  transfer  the  proportionate  amount  of  funds \non a periodic basis from the imprest accounts of the ADB and OPEC loans.       \n \n\n\f15 \n\n62. \nThe accounts section prepares the W/A based on SOE procedures and submits it to the \nexecutive  engineer  for  countersignature.  The  chairperson  forwards  the  W/A  to  PD/LGED  for \nsubmission to ADB. \n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n63.  With the assistance of an adequate number of suitably qualified accounting staff, including \na  financial  manager,  the  PMOs  under  BWDB  and  LGED  will  maintain  separate  accounts  and \nrecords  for  all  sources  of  funding  and  the  project  expenditures  in  accordance  with  generally \naccepted  accounting  principles.  Consolidated  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements \ncompiled by the PMOs separately will be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to \nADB.  The  annual  audit  will  cover  all  receipts  and  expenditures,  imprest  accounts,  SOE \nprocedures,  and  compliance  with  loan  covenants.  The  audit  report  will  include  a  separate  audit \nopinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  SOE  procedures.  The  audited  accounts,  audit \nreport,  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  and  the  OPEC  Fund  within  9 \nmonths after the end of each fiscal year. BWDB, LGED, and the project towns are made aware of \nADB\u2019s policy on delayed submission, and the requirement for satisfactory and acceptable quality \nof audited accounts. \n \n64. \nThe  PMOs  will  receive  monthly  and  quarterly  progress  reports  from  all  PIUs  under  their \njurisdiction. The PMOs will consolidate those reports into one report to be submitted to ADB and \nthe OPEC Fund within 1 month after the end of each quarter. The report will provide information \non progress made, problems encountered during the period and steps taken or proposed to be \ntaken to remedy the problems, and the proposed programs for the following quarter. The report \nwill particularly address progress in meeting the targets of the UGIAP. The PMOs will also submit \nM&E  reports  in  years  2  and  4  of  the  Project.  Finally,  within  3  months  of  substantial physical \ncompletion of the Project, a project completion report will be prepared and submitted by the EAs \nin a format satisfactory to ADB. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n65. \nThe  performance  evaluation  and  monitoring  of  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  under  the \ndirection of the PMT and following ADB\u2019s guidelines for this purpose. With the assistance of the \nconsultants,  BWDB  and  LGED  will  establish  a  management  system  to  ensure  that  the  facilities \nare  managed  efficiently  and  the  expected  benefits  are  maximized.  M&E  will  determine  the \neffectiveness  of  the  integrated  flood  protection  measures  introduced  under  the  Project  and  the \nimprovements  on  public  health,  environment,  property  values,  and  operational  efficiencies  that \nhave taken place.  \n \n66. \nTo  ensure  that  project  activities  and  facilities  are  managed  efficiently  and  that  benefits \nreach  the  target  groups,  an  M&E  program  will  be  included  the  framework  of  ADB\u2019s  project \nperformance monitoring system (PPMS). PPMS activities will be conducted periodically to gather \ninformation  through  multiple  sources  to  determine  whether  the  input  deliveries  for  implementing \nprogram activities have rendered the expected benefits to the intended beneficiaries. The PPMS \nalso  seeks  to  detect  any  deficiency  and  discrepancy  between  the  plan  and  the  execution  of  a \nprogram in using the resources efficiently so that timely corrections can be made to update the \nprogram and thus improve the benefits, outcomes, and impact. The indicators to be monitored will \nbe  formulated  and  agreed  upon  with  BWDB  and  LGED  and  will  include  indicators  pertaining  to \nboth  physical  progress  and  capacity  building  activities.  The  PMOs  will  conduct  initial  baseline \nphysical  and  socioeconomic  surveys  and  submit  a  detailed  implementation  plan  for  monitoring \nperformance and for preparing benchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within 6 \nmonths  of  loan  effectiveness.  Thereafter,  PMOs  will  submit  annual  M&E  reports  to  ADB \nthroughout Project implementation. \n\n\f16 \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\n67. \nADB and the OPEC Fund will conduct detailed reviews of the Project at least twice a year. \nThe  reviews  will  cover  physical  progress  of  project  implementation;  financial  performance  and \nstaffing  of  the  project  towns;  implementation  of  UGIAP,  PRAP,  and  GAP;  progress  on  slum \nimprovement activities; and identification of problems and suggested solutions. A comprehensive \nmidterm review (MTR) will be conducted jointly by the Government, ADB and the OPEC Fund in \nyear  3.  The  MTR  will  evaluate  project  design,  stakeholder  participation,  quality  of  works,  social \nand environmental impacts, improvement on urban governance, effectiveness of implementation \narrangements and project management structures, attainment of the O&M budget for sustainable \nmaintenance, and future implementation plans for remaining work. If the assessment of MTR so \ndemands, the Government and ADB may consider modifying the scope and design of the Project \nand reallocating of funds among the loan categories including consultants\u2019 inputs. The MTR will \nfinalize the schedule of the proposed feasibility study for the new investments. BWDB and LGED \nwill  submit  detailed  terms  of  reference  of  the  study  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and  approval  during  the \nMTR. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n \n\nMajor Benefits and Impacts \n\n1. \n\nSocial and Gender Aspects \n\n \n68. \nPoverty incidence was as high as 40% of the sample households, where income is below \nthe poverty line of Tk44,410 per year ($65 per month). Households in hard core poverty survive \non  incomes  of  less  than  Tk36,345  per  year  ($53  per  month),  concentrate  in  overcrowded  slum \nand  squatter  areas,  and  lead  a  hand-to-mouth  existence.  Between  7%  and  30%  of  the \nhouseholds in hard core poverty are headed by women (Appendix 11). Focus group discussions \nstrongly underline the appeal of the poor for employment opportunities and decent wages; their \nemphasis is on the need to improve drainage for quicker clearance of rainwater and facilitation of \nnormal  movement  during  flooding  to  mitigate  the  loss  of  workdays.  Women  are  particularly \nconcerned about shelter for themselves and their animals, children\u2019s access to schools, as well \nas  access  to  medicine  and  health  care,  especially  during  floods.  Poverty  reduction  has  been \nmade as a strategic objective of each Project component, with the view to maximize employment \nduring  construction,  develop  skills  for  O&M,  and  make  roads  and  basic  services  available  in \ndeprived  areas.  In  slums,  improved  access  to  water  supply,  sanitation,  solid  waste  disposal, \nroads and footpaths, lighting, schools and health care will be assured. To this end each town will \nhave  its  own  PRAP  and  GAP,  which  will  be  prepared  with  primary  stakeholder  participation,  in \nresponse to expressed needs.12 \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic and Financial Feasibility \n\n69. \nThe  economic  analysis  confirms  substantial  economic  benefits  from  the  project \ncomponents  in  all  nine  project  towns.  The  main  economic  benefits  include  (i)  flood  damage \nmitigation  for  buildings  and  all  types  of  property,  (ii)  mitigation  of  infrastructure  damage,  (iii) \nenhancement of land values, and (iv) enhancement of economic activities. While the Project will \nmainly  address  urban  flood  protection  within  municipal  boundaries,  proposed  works  will  provide \nsignificant  peripheral  benefits  to  cultivated  land  outside  the  town  boundaries.  While  improved \nsanitary conditions through solid waste management and installation of sanitary latrines will bring \nnumerous health benefits, these are not quantified. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \n\n                                                 \n12 Supplementary Appendix C gives the detailed Gender Action Plan. \n\n\f17 \n\ncalculated for all project towns, ranges from 13.5% in Rajshahi to 44.6% in Jamalpur. The EIRR \nfor the Project as a whole is estimated at 22.8% (Appendix 12) The overall poverty impact ratio is \nestimated to be 48%. \n \n70. \nThe financial base of the project towns is weak, with per capita revenues averaging Tk413 \n($7.0)  per  year.  Own-source  revenues  make  up  one  half  of  total  revenues,  with  the  balance \nreceived  as  municipal  grants  from  the  Government.  Since  the  project  capital  costs  (drainage, \nsolid waste, sanitation, slum improvement) are financed by Government grants, the cost recovery \nstrategy  under  the  Project  is  aimed  at  meeting  the  incremental  O&M  costs  through  increased \nrevenue  mobilization,  the  success  of  which  relies  heavily  on  efficient  property  tax  collection. \nBased  on  the  lessons  learned  from  phase  1,  institutionalized  training  will  be  provided  by \nimplementing  the  UGIAP  to  improve  financial  management  in  the  project  towns.  Proposed \nproperty tax reforms include raising the tax collection efficiency from the current average  of 52% \nto 80% and above, and regularly updating property assessments (analysis of municipal finance is \nsummarized in Appendix 13).  \n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\n71. \nThe  Project  has  been  classified  in  environmental  category  B.  As  part  of  the  project \npreparatory  TA,  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were  carried  out  for  all  project \nsubcomponents. The IEEs showed that none of the proposed components would have significant \nadverse  environmental  impacts.  The  summary  IEE  is  in  Appendix  14. 13  Anticipated  minor \nenvironmental  impacts  include  generation  of  dust  and  air  pollution  due  to  demolition  and \nexcavation  activities,  and  increased  vibrations  and  noise  during  construction;  increases  in \nexhaust fumes and traffic during construction activities and transport of solid waste to dump sites; \nand hygiene and sanitation problems arising from inappropriate O&M of latrines and solid waste \ndump sites.   \n \nEnvironmental  benefits  resulting  from  the  Project  include  improved  hygiene  and  sanitary \n72. \nconditions and improved waste handling, treatment and disposal. To guide these activities, a solid \nwaste  management  plan  and  a  sanitation  management  plan  will  be  formulated  before  loan \neffectiveness. The two plans will include public awareness as well as models for operationalizing \nand  maintaining  latrines  and  solid  waste  management  facilities,  including  sanitary  landfill  sites \nand composting facilities.  The  riverbank  will  have  significant  positive  impacts  by  protecting  the \nproductive agricultural and homestead land from progressive river erosion.  \n \nB. \n\nMajor Risks \n\n73.  While  no  unusual  risk  is  foreseen  during  implementation,  the  potential  risks  concern  (i) \nimplementation  delays  due  to  slow  progress  with  start-up  activities  (such  as  engagement  of \nconsultants  and  completion  of  administrative  changes  required  for  launching  regional  training \ncenters), (ii) lack of suitably qualified personnel in the project towns that may eventually lead to \nweak  implementation  of  the  subproject  at  the  town  level,  (iii)  inadequate  coordination  between \nBWDB and LGED, (iv) unavailability of the OPEC Fund cofinancing, and (v) sustainability of the \nfacilities and services provided under the Project. \n \n74. \nFirst, implementation delay can largely be prevented by timely mobilization of consultants. \nAdvance  action  is  required  to  ensure  that  the  implementation  schedule  can  be  adhered  to. \nSecond,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  qualified  staff  in  the  PIU  are  nominated  and  provided \nwith advance training before loan effectiveness. Third, the two PMOs will be set up and placed in \n\n                                                 \n13 A sample IEE is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n\n\f18 \n\none location under the joint leadership of the PMT for effective coordination. Fourth, in the event \nthat the OPEC Fund loan does not materialize for any reason after effectiveness of the ADB loan, \nthe  scope  of  the  Project  may  be  reduced  in  accordance  with  the  available  resources.  Scaling \ndown  the  components  and  activities  of  the  Project  is  technically  and  financially  feasible  and \ndiscussed with the Government. \n \n75. \nFinally, the sustainability of the project investments will depend primarily on the ability of \nBWDB  and  the  project  towns  to  generate  sufficient  revenues  for  O&M.  The  following  measures \nare  adopted  to  minimize  the  O&M  risk:  (i)  raise  engineering  standards,  specifying  the  higher \nquality, and more robust civil works options; (ii) strengthen local governments to improve financial \nmanagement  and  revenue  generation  performance;  and  (iii)  firm  up  central  Government  O&M \ncommitments in line with a strategy prepared with project support. Additional measures will also \nbe considered during project implementation: (i) provide incentives for better O&M performance; \nand  (ii)  prepare  a  modified  O&M  model  for  using  loan  funds  to  partially  finance  O&M  recurrent \ncosts,  on  a  diminishing  contribution  basis.    The  Project's  O&M  risk  profile  will  be  closely \nmonitored  and  will  guide  the  preparation  of  the  next  phase  of  the  urban  flood  protection  works \nassisted by ADB. \n  \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n76. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nWithin 3 months of loan effectiveness, each project town will have entered into a \nformal agreement with LGED for the effective implementation of the UGIAP for that \ntown.  The  Government will ensure implementation of the UGIAPs in accordance \nwith  the  set  time  frames.  The  formal  agreement  with  LGED  for  UGIAP \nimplementation  is  a  condition  for  awarding  civil  work  contracts  for  the  project \ntowns. \nThe  Government  will  cause  BWDB  and  LGED  to  adopt  the  GAP  and  PRAP  and \nwill ensure their full implementation throughout the project period. To this end, the \nGovernment  will  require  the  PMOs  to  prepare  field  manuals  for  the  GAP  and \nPRAP and conduct training for the PMO and PIU staff. Implementation of the GAP \nand PRAP will be closely monitored and progress will be described in the quarterly \nreports to ADB.   \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that,  each  year  before  calling  tenders  for  any  new \nconstruction,  the  work  plans  and  preliminary  designs  will  be  presented  to  the \nbeneficiaries  at  a  town  meeting  organized  by  the  town  chairperson  (or  mayor  of \nRCC).  At  these  meetings,  the  proposed  works  will  be  presented  to  the \nbeneficiaries  in  a  manner  that  ensures  they  gain  a  full  understanding  of  the \nproposed  works.  The  presentations  will  actively  involve  suitable  engineering \nproject  personnel  from  BWDB  and  LGED  (depending  on  the  work  component \ninvolved)  and  the  towns  (or  RCC),  as  well  as  the  MDS  consultant.  Approval  in \nprinciple for the works to proceed must be sought. \nBWDB and the project towns will complete detailed surveys and prepare detailed \nland acquisition plans each year for the works to be undertaken during the coming \nfiscal year and submit them to the deputy commissioner of the respective towns at \nthe latest 3 months before the working season so as to complete all formalities as \nwell as physical land possession before the working season begins.  \n\n\f19 \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nimplemented  during  construction  and  O&M, \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  people  affected  by  land  acquisition  will  be \ncompensated before possession of land and  assets, on the basis of replacement \ncost  and  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB.  If  involuntary  resettlement,  land,  or \nasset  acquisition  is  required,  a  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  in  accordance \nwith the Project Resettlement Plan. \nThe Government will ensure that all environmental mitigating measures identified \nin the IEE and agreed upon with ADB will be incorporated into the project design \nand \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s environmental laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003).  \nThe Government will ensure that civil works contractors comply with all applicable \nlabor laws, do not employ child labor for construction and maintenance activities, \nand  provide  appropriate  facilities  for  children  in  construction  campsites.  The \nGovernment  will  set  employment  targets  in  road  construction  and  maintenance \nand  other  infrastructure  construction  activities  for  poor  and  vulnerable  people, \nparticularly women, and require contractors not to differentiate wages for men and \nwomen  for  work  of  equal  value.  A  specific  clause  will  be  included  in  bidding \ndocuments,  and  compliance  will  be  strictly  monitored  during  project \nimplementation. \n\nin  accordance  with \n\n(x) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  BWDB  will  ensure  that  all  vacant  positions  in  its  field  divisions  will  be  filled  by \nqualified personnel within 1 month of loan effectiveness and that all positions will \nremain filled for the duration of the Project. \nThe Government will ensure that all counterpart funding required for the Project in \naccordance  with  the  financing  plan,  including  the  cost  of  land  acquisition,  cost  of \nother  resettlement  compensation,  implementation  and  monitoring  activities  under \nthe  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans,  and  general  project  management \nexpenses,  will  be  fully  provided  through  the  approved  annual  development  plan \nallocations. \nThe  Government  will  take  all  necessary  and  appropriate  measures  to  ensure \nadequate  O&M  funding  and  implementation.  This  will  involve  BWDB  preparing \nfield  manuals  for  flood  protection  works,  adopting  existing  field  manuals  for \nmunicipal works as well as strictly implementing O&M provisions in the UGIAP. By \nDecember 2008, the Government will have reviewed the O&M funding for BWDB \nworks and will have made recommendations. \nIn  the  event  that  cofinancing  by  the  OPEC  Fund  cannot  be  obtained  within  6 \nmonths  of  the  effective  date,  the  Government  will  take  all  necessary  and \nappropriate steps to make other arrangements to cover the shortfall, through either \nbudget  allocations  or  other  arrangements  acceptable \nIf  such \narrangements  cannot  be  made,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  agree  on  the \ncomponents or activities to be scaled down. \n\nto  ADB. \n\n(xi) \n\n \nB. \n\n77. \n \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe following are the conditions for loan effectiveness: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  project  proformas,  consistent  with  the  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the \nPresident (RRP) and loan agreement, will have been approved by the Government.  \nThe PMOs will have been established and staff nominated. \nA detailed program for UGIAP implementation in each of the nine towns will have \nbeen submitted by UMSU of LGED for ADB\u2019s review and approval. \nA solid waste management plan and a sanitation management plan will have been \ndeveloped under the Project. \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n78. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB \nand, acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of \nAgreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board approve \n \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 54,321,000 to the \nPeople's  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Secondary  Towns  Integrated  Flood \nProtection  Project  Phase  2  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest \ncharge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter;  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreement presented to the Board; and  \n\nthe  administration  by  ADB  of  a  loan  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $15,000,000  to \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Secondary  Towns  Integrated  Flood \nProtection  Project  Phase  2  to  be  provided  by  the  OPEC  Fund  under  the  terms  of  a \nLetter of Administration to be entered into between ADB and the OPEC Fund. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n8 November 2004 \n\nJoseph B.

Water Sector \n\n \nA. \n \nAfter the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the provincial Irrigation Directorate was in charge \n1. \nof  the  development  of  water  resources  and  flood  control  facilities.  Following  the  devastating \nfloods of 1954 and 1955, a United Nation (UN) mission\u2014the Krug Mission\u2014 recommended the \ncreation  of  the  East  Pakistan  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  (EPWAPDA).  This  was \nestablished  in  1959  with  two  wings:  Water  Wing  and  Power  Wing.  The  Water  Wing  was \nrestructured in 1972 as Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) and its mandate limited \nto  water  resources  development.  BWDB  was  reconstituted  in  July  2000  under  a  new  Act  that \nrepositions the organization and aligns its responsibilities to those set out in the National Water \nPolicy (NWP).   \n \nB. \n \nThe  Water  Wing  of  EPWAPDA  prepared  a  master  plan  envisaging  58  massive  flood \n2. \ncontrol  and  drainage  (FCD)  projects  and  three  barrages  on  three  major  rivers.  Projects \nimplemented  by  EPWAPDA  covered  mainly  the  engineering  aspects  to  help  boost  agricultural \nproduction to meet the country\u2019s demand. It was claimed that the master plan ignored the needs \nof  nonagricultural  water-using  sectors.  A  World  Bank  study  in  1972  suggested  a  major  shift  in \nstrategy from massive FCD projects to minor irrigation complemented by agricultural input supply \nand support services. The World Bank Mission recommended a review of BWDB activities and \nstressed the creation of a planning body outside BWDB to prepare a NWP that emphasizes on \nmaximizing agricultural growth and production for food grain self-sufficiency. The NWP that was \nprepared put heavy reliance on minor irrigation through massive fielding of tube wells and low-lift \npumps utilizing available surface water from rivers and other water resources. \n \nThe  country  experienced  two  consecutive  massive  floods  in  1987  and  1988,  which \n3. \nprompted the government to undertake immediate rehabilitation works, and in parallel a few joint \nstudies.  Later  a  flood  action  plan  (FAP)  consisting  of  26  studies  and  pilot  projects  was \nundertaken  with  the  support  of  various  sources.  The  major  achievement  of  the  FAP  was  the \npreparation of five regional studies and three important guidelines for: (i) project assessment, (ii) \npeople\u2019s participation, and (iii) environmental impact assessment. At the conclusion of the FAP \nstudies the Bangladesh flood and management strategy was produced as the final report of the \nFAP. The report outlined a strategic framework for developing and implementing a national water \nmanagement system and formulating a NWP and national water management plan (NWMP). It is \nworth mentioning that the NWP was prepared and approved by the Government in 1999, while \nthe  NWMP  was  approved  by  the  Government  on  31  March  2004.  The  Secondary  Towns \nIntegrated Flood Protection Project-II (STIFPP-II) is being formulated under the umbrella of the \nFAP. The NWMP provides the overall approach to and program for future urban flood protection, \nbut actual formulation of the investment plans will be the responsibility of the end users. \n \n4. \nThe  FAP  was  instrumental  in  bringing  a  paradigm  shift  in  water  planning  methodology, \nputting  emphasis  on  equal  rights  of  all  water  users  and  mandatory  use  of  environment  impact \nassessment  (EIA)  and  guidelines  for  people's  participation  at  all  stages  of  the  project  cycle \n(planning,  design,  implementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance).  In  line  with  the  above \npolicies  and  with  the  changing  demand,  the  role  of  BWDB  has  been  redefined  and  a  new \nmanagement structure is in place through reforms and downsizing of its manpower. \n \n \n\n\f \n \nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n \n26 \n \n \n\nKey Issues \n\nC. \n \n5. \nBangladesh  is  making  good  progress  in  establishing  an  up-to-date and comprehensive \nlegal,  policy,  planning,  institutional  framework  for  the  water  sector.  Some  elements  of  the \nframework are NWP, MWMP, and reforms in the key institutions responsible for water resources \nmanagement. A milestone in formulating policy and planning for the sector was the adoption of \nthe  NWP  in  1999,  a  step  further  toward  good  governance.  The  NWP  also  defined  major \ninstitutional reforms, and the role of the government, the private sector, and civil society in water \nmanagement.  The  NWP  has  called  for  accelerating  the  development  of  sustainable  public  and \nprivate  water  delivery  systems  with  appropriate  legal  and  financial  measures  and  incentives \nincluding  formulation  of  water  rights  and  water  pricing.  The  NWP  has  also  called  for \ndecentralization of water management. A scheme of up to 1,000 ha command area is to be given \nto the local government to plan, execute, and operate. \n \n6. \nAs  dictated  by  the  NWP,  the  government  revised  the  earlier  guidelines  for  people\u2019s \nparticipation and replaced it with Guidelines for Participatory Water Management. The guidelines \nincorporate  the  mechanism  for  establishing  and  operationalizing  beneficiary  organizations  like \nwater user associations and linking with state institutions.  In line with the NWP, the NWMP was \napproved  by  the  Government  on  31  March  2004.  Even  before  approval,  the  salient  features  of \nthe NWMP were incorporated in the Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.  \n \n7. \nThe  institutional  reforms  currently  on  the  agenda  are  based  on  the  NWP.  Key  BWDB \nreforms include redefining of BWDB\u2019s role in the sector, changing BWDB's management to make \nit  fully  autonomous  with  an  independent  governing  council,  separating  management  from  the \ngoverning council, and reducing the permanent staff from 18,000 to 8,860 by June 2007. Overall \nprogress in reforming BWDB has been substantial. Given the accomplishment of the past years, \nit  is  possible  that  most  of  the  actions  associated  with  the  reform  process  will  have  been \naddressed  by  2007.  The  BWDB Act has mandated participatory management of projects. The \nobjective is to promote a sense of ownership among beneficiaries and their willingness to share \nthe  cost  of  maintenance  that  would  eventually  relieve  BWDB  of  the  O&M  burden. Progress is \nslow on this. \n \nRiver training and bank protection works by BWDB have been found very costly, but they \n8. \nhave been the only effective means of combating river erosion. Erosion control schemes show \nthat they involve high maintenance expenditure, but they can provide protection. There is a need \nfor  contingency  planning  to  cope  with  failure,  and  beneficiary  participation  in  erosion  control \nprograms has proved extremely useful. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \nAppendix 3 \n\n27 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO FLOOD PROTECTION IN BANGLADESH \n(1990 onward) \n\nProject/ Technical Assistance \n\nAgency \n\nCurrency \n\nCanada \n\nCanadian dollar \n\nAmount \n(million) \n17.00 \n\nYear \nCommitted \n1991 \n\nLoan/ \nGrant \nGrant \n\nNortheast Regional Study (FAP 6) and pilot \nworks  \nFlood Action Plan (FAP 25) \nMeghna Estuary Study (FAP 5B) \n\nBank Protection and River Training (FAP 21/22) \nCompartmentalization Pilot Project (FAP 20) \nBank Protection and River Training (FAP 21/22)  \nNarayanganj Narsingdi FCDI III Study \nCompartmentalization Pilot Project (FAP 20) \nTA Flood Action Plan (FAP 25) \nSmall-Scale Water Resources Development \nSecond Small-Scale Water Resources \nDevelopment \nFlood Action Plan (FAP 12) \nFlood Action Plan (FAP 2) \nFlood Action Plan-Related Activities \nSecond Pabna Irrigation and Rural Development \nSecond Bhola Irrigation \nDhaka Integrated Flood Protection Project \nDhaka Integrated Flood Protection Project \nSecondary Towns Integrated Flood Protection I \nSecondary Towns Integrated Flood Protection I \nSecond Bhola Irrigation \nSmall-Scale Water Resources Development \nSmall-Scale Water Resources Development \nCommand area Development Project \nCommand area Development Project \nSecond Small-Scale Water Resources \nDevelopment \nSecond Small-Scale Water Resources \nDevelopment \nSecondary Towns Integrated Flood Protection II \nGumti Project Phase 1 (FCD 1) \nNaogaon polder 1 (FCD 3) \nMadhumati-Nabaganga project (FCD 4) \nRiverbank Protection \nRiverbank Protection (Supplementary) \nSmall-Scale Water Resources Development \nNorth Central Regional Study (FAP 3) \nJamuna-Daleshwari Left Bank Studies  \nFlood Action Plan  \nDhaka Integrated Flood Protection Project \n\nDenmark \nDenmark \n\nFrance \nGermany \nGermany \nJapan \nNetherlands  \nNetherlands  \nNetherlands  \nNetherlands  \n\nUK \nUK \nUSA \nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \n \nADB \n \nADB \nWorld Bank(IDA) \nWorld Bank(IDA) \nWorld Bank(IDA) \nWorld Bank(IDA) \nWorld Bank(IDA) \nIFAD \nEU \nEU \nUNDP \nFinland \n\nDenmark krone/ \nUS Dollar \n\nFrance \nDeutsche mark \n\nYen \nGuilder \nGuilder \nGuilder \nGuilder \n\nPound sterling \nPound sterling \nUS dollar \nUS dollar \nUS dollar \nUS dollar \nUS dollar \nUS dollar \nUS dollar \nUS dollar \nUS dollar \nUS dollar \nUS dollar \nUS dollar \nUS dollar \nUS dollar \nUS dollar \n\nUS dollar \nUS dollar \nUS dollar \nUS dollar \nUS dollar \nUS dollar \nEcu \nEcu \nUS dollar \nUS dollar \n\n13.300 \n5.300 \n\n93.000 \n13.500 \n44.400 \n339.000 \n13.410 \n0.065 \n12.000 \n64.385 \n\n0.850 \n1.403 \n4.199 \n0.250 \n0.250 \n0.250 \n91.500 \n0.600 \n55.000 \n39.800 \n0.500 \n32.000 \n0.441 \n30.000 \n0.500 \n34.000 \n0.900 \n\n23.000 \n21.000 \n11.000 \n121.900 \n45.000 \n10.400 \n12.600 \n4.000 \n0.688 \n0.350 \n\n1993 \n1994 \n\n4992 \n1992 \n1992 \n1998 \n1991 \n1992 \n1996 \n2001 \n\n1990 \n1990 \n1991 \n1990 \n1990 \n1990 \n1991 \n1992 \n1992 \n1992 \n1992 \n1995 \n1992 \n1995 \n1999 \n2001 \n2002 \n\n1991 \n1991 \n1992 \n1996 \n1999 \n1995 \n1990 \n1993 \n1990 \n1990 \n\nGrant \nGrant \n\nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \n\nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nLoan \nGrant \nLoan \nLoan \nGrant \nLoan \nGrant \nLoan \nGrant \nLoan \nGrant \n\nLoan \nLoan \nLoan \nLoan \nLoan \nLoan \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  EU  =  European  Union,  FAP  =  Flood  Action  Plan,  FCDI  =  flood  control,  drainage  and \nirrigation,  IDA  =  International  Development  Association,  IFAD  =  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development,  TA  = \ntechnical assistance, UK = United Kingdom, UNDP = United Nations Development Programme,  USA = United States of \nAmerica.    \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\nItem \nInvestment Costs \n  A.

The plan is divided into two parts. Part 1 presents the overall Secondary Towns \nIntegrated  flood  Protection  Phase  II  (STIFPP  II)  project  resettlement  plan,  focusing  on  policy \nissues  and  Part  2  includes  the  project  towns  resettlement  plans. The policy framework of the \noverall STIFPP II resettlement plan is to guide implementation of the town-specific resettlement \nplans. \n  \nA. \n \n2. \nWith over 200 river systems across the country and about 40%of its inland area under \nwaterways,  Bangladesh  has  a  long  history  of  flooding.  The  heavy  rainfall  during  the  monsoon \nmonths  makes  things  worse.  Flooding  in  the  urban  areas  has  become  particularly  acute \nbecause of high population densities, concentration of industrial and commercial activities, and \ninadequate drainage facilities. This problem affects mostly the urban poor, who generally live in \nslums  and  squatter  areas,  mainly  on  low-lying  land  that  is  flooded  annually.  Disastrous  floods \nthat  cause  extensive  damage  to  the  economy  and  loss  of  human  lives  highlight  the  enormity \nand urgency of the problem and have aroused much international concern.  \n \n \nThe goal of the ADB -financed project preparatory TA1 was to provide people of selected \n3. \nproject  towns  with  a  relatively  flood-free  and  secure  living  environment  within  the  broader \nstrategic  framework  of  poverty  reduction.  The  nine  towns  in  the  Project  are:  Brahmanbaria, \nGaibandha, Jamalpur, Kushtia, Manikganj, Munshiganj Mymensingh, Rajshahi, and Sunamganj. \nThe  Project  has  four  major  components:  (i)  flood  protection  works;  (ii)  drainage  system \nimprovement;  (iii)  urban  environmental  improvement  including  solid  waste  management, \nsanitation,  and  slum  improvement;  and  (iv)  capacity  building  and implementation assistance, \nincluding consulting services and training. \n \n4. \nDespite its essentially beneficial aspects, some activities of the Project are likely to have \nadverse  socioeconomic  consequences  for  people  in  the  project  area.  Some  may  lose  either \nwholly or partially their houses, lands, businesses, and other sources of making a living, and be \nforced  to  relocate.  The  Project  is,  however,  unlikely  to  trigger  relocation  on  any  large  scale. \nEven those who will need to move temporarily to allow the construction activity to proceed will \nbe close to their present locations, retaining their existing sources of livelihood as well as social \nbonds,  and  will  thus  be  saved  from  total  disruption  that  is  so  common  in  relocation  to distant \nlocations.  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nA census of all potentially affected households, business enterprises, community assets, \nand  common  property  resources  was  conducted.  The  purpose  was  to  register  and document \nthe  status  of  all  potentially  affected  households,  their  assets,  and  sources  of  livelihood.  The \ncensus  data  will  provide  the  basis  for  determining  who  may  be  entitled  to  compensation, \nassistance,  and  other  benefits.  In  addition,  a  socioeconomic  survey,  of  20%  households, \nselected  on  a  random  basis  was  conducted.  The  two  surveys  together  yielded  a  wealth  of \n\nImpacts and the Affected People \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2002.

These  figures  do  not  include  the  number  of  people  who  might  be  affected by urban \nslum environmental improvement works. At this stage, it is not possible to identify the possible \nimpacts  from  this  component,  as  decisions  about  the  exact  location  of  urban  slum \nenvironmental improvement works have not yet been taken up.  \n \nC. \n \n7. \nWhile  there  is  general  support  for  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement,  the \nBangladesh  legal  system  on  mitigating  of  the  loss  of  land  and  other  assets  focuses  on \ncompensating  only  titleholders.  There  is  no  compensation  for  affected  people  who  lack  legal \ntitles. In recent years, however, Bangladesh has adopted for ADB-funded and other aid projects \non  an  ad  hoc  basis,  resettlement  policy  guidelines  that  are  largely  consistent  with  ADB's \nresettlement  policy.  Considering  this  precedent  and  the  legal  and  policy  requirements  of  the \nGovernment and ADB, a set of compensation principles has been adopted to guide resettlement \noperations in this Project.  \n \nThe  project  policy  is  designed  to  compensate  lost  assets  and  restore  or  improve  the \n8. \nlivelihood of all categories of affected persons, whether affected directly, indirectly, with titles, or \nwithout  titles.  The  affected  people  will  be  eligible  to  receive  cash  compensation  for  land  and \nother  assets  at  replacement  value,  if  not  replacement  land.  Additionally,  they  will  receive \nassistance  in  other  forms,  including  shifting  allowance,  assistance  for  small  business \nenterprises  to  reestablish  businesses,  income  restoration  allowance,  and  assistance  to \nhouseholds headed by females. The entitlement matrix (see table) summarizes the entitlements \nfor losses of all kinds to all affected persons and lists persons eligible to receive those benefits.    \n \n\n No \n\nNature of Loss \n\nEntitled Persons \n\nTable  A10.1: Entitlement Matrix \n\nLegal owner(s) of the land  Replacement land, or cash compensation  \n\nLoss of agricultural \nland or fishpond \n\nLoss of access to \ncultivable agricultural \nland or fishpond by \ntenant or sharecropper \n \nLoss trees or \nstanding crops or \nfishes  \n\nLoss of homestead or \nbusiness \n(commercial) land \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\nTenants and \nsharecroppers under \ncontract \n\nLegal owner(s) of the land  Compensation at the replacement value for trees \n\nEntitlements \n(Compensation and/or Assistance) \n\nPremium (50%) \nAdditional grant to cover replacement cost \nStamp duty and registration fees for land to be \npurchased \nCompensation for crops at Tk200/decimal (1% of \nan acre)  \nCompensation for fish at Tk300/ decimal \n\nAdditional grant to cover replacement  value  \nCompensation for fruits for fruit-bearing trees at \n30% of tree value \nAffected persons allowed to take away trees and \n\nPremium (50%) \nAdditional grant to cover replacement cost \nStamp duty and registration fees for land to be   \npurchased \nCash compensation for structure at replacement \nvalue \nAdditional grant to cover replacement value  \n\ncrops  \nLegal owner(s) of the land  Replacement land, or cash compensation  \n\nLoss of residential or \nbusiness structure by \nowner \n\nLegal owner(s) of the \nstructure \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n38 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n No \n\nNature of Loss \n\nEntitled Persons \n\n  6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\nLoss of access to \nresidential or \nbusiness structure \n(rented or leased) \n \nLoss of residential \nstructure by squatter \n\nTenants renting or leasing \nthe structure \n\nHead of household \nsquatting on government \nland  \n\nLoss of business due \nto dislocation \n\nOwner/operator of \nbusiness \n\nLoss of income, \nemployment or work \nopportunity full-time \nor part-time \n \nLoss of community \nfacilities or common \nproperty resources  \n\nWorkers of affected \nbusinesses  \n\nCommunity at relocation \nsite \n\nEntitlements \n(Compensation and/or Assistance) \nOne-time grant of TK5,000 to transfer structure to \nnew location, and reconstruction grant of Tk2500    \nOwner allowed to take salvageable material \nAdditional assistance for households with female \nheads  \n \nOne-time cash grant of Tk5,000 to transfer  \nstructure to new location, and reconstruction    \ngrant of Tk2,500 \n\nCompensation for lost structure to owner at \nreplacement value \nOne-time shifting grant of Tk5,000 and \nreconstruction grant of Tk2,500 \nBusiness restoration grant of Tk8,000 to large and \nTk5,000 to small owner   \nBusiness restoration grant of Tk8,000 for large and \nTk5,000 for small renter or squatter \nOne-time cash grant of Tk3,000 per wage loser \nAdditional Tk1,000 for households with female \nheads  \n \n\nReconstruction or improvement of \ncommunity facilities or common  property resource \nCompensation at replacement value for structures  \nTransfer grant of Tk5,000 \nReconstruction grant of Tk2,500 \nProvision of additional civic  \namenities  \n\n11 \n\nLoss to host \ncommunity  \n\nHost village or area \n\nConsultative Approach and Grievance Redress   \n\n \nD. \n \n9. \nPeople  taking  part  in  decisions  that  directly  affect  their  lives  develop  a  sense  of  local \nownership and cooperate in the program. In fact, the Project regards participation as critical to \nthe success of its efforts and will utilize a participatory approach to planning and implementing \nof  resettlement.  The  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  in  consultation  with  all  the  stakeholders, \nespecially  the  affected  people,  and  has  thus  greatly  benefited  from  the  local  knowledge.  The \nplan will be implemented in a similar consultative manner. \n \nGenerally,  people  see  the  Project  in  a  positive  light,  thanks  to  the  emphasis  on  the \n10. \nconsultative approach adopted right from the beginning. They think they have good reasons to \nwelcome the initiative that will save them from floods and the latter's devastating impacts. With \nthe  flood  menace  gone,  they  hope  to  enjoy  a  better  standard  of  living  in  a  relatively  safer \nenvironment.  People  also  expect  better  civic  amenities  planned  under  the  slum  environmental \nimprovement  component  to  further  improve  their  living  conditions.  Other  stakeholders \nsupportive  of  the  Project  are  all  the  secondary  towns,  the  Rajshahi  City  Corporation, \ngovernment officials, and local women\u2019s groups (as they are the ones who bear the brunt of the \nfloods' fury most of all). \n \n11. \nThe  Project  will  establish  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  deal  with  cases  of \ndiscontent  among  affected  persons  or  groups.  The  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs) \nimplementing the resettlement plan will set up a broad-based grievance redress committee with \nrepresentation  of  affected  people  including  women  in  adequate  number.  The  committee  will \nmeet  regularly  and  maintain  a  complete  record  of  the  meetings,  grievances  solved,  etc.  will \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n39 \n\nensure that grievances are solved as speedily as possible. Grievances relating to land titles are  \noutside  the  purview  of  this  committee,  and  persons  with  such  grievances  will  be  advised  to \napproach the appropriate law courts for their resolution. \n \nPlan Implementation \nE. \n \n \n12. \n  The  Project  will  be  jointly  implemented  by  the  two  Executing  Agencies.  Bangladesh \nWater  Development  Board  (BWDB),  and  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED). \nThe  flood  protection  component  will  be  the  responsibility  of  BWDB  and,  the  drainage  system \nimprovement  and  urban  environmental  improvement  components  will  be  executed  by  LGED \nthrough  the  project  towns  under  its  overall  technical  guidance.  Project  management  offices \n(PMOs) will be set up in both BWDB and LGED. The PMOs, headed by project directors, will be \nresponsible  for  overall  management  of  the  Project,  including  land  acquisition,  relocation, \nresettlement,  and  related  matters.  BWDB  and  LGED  will  contract  NGOs  to  implement  the \nresettlement  plans,  and  also  add  resettlement  specialists  to  their  staff.  project  implementation \nunits (PIUs) will be established in each project town. \n \nAn interministerial project steering committee at the central level will be established for \n13. \noperational  coordination  and  for  policy  guidance.  It  will  be  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  the \nMinistry of Water Resources. Similarly, in each project town, a project coordination committee \nunder the chairmanship of the mayor will be established. The members of this committee will be \nthe local officials of BWDB, LGED, and other concerned town agencies.  \n \n14. \nA  time-bound  implementation  schedule  has  been  prepared.  Resettlement  activities  will \nbe completed within the preparatory stage of engineering construction and before the relevant \ncivil engineering works begin.  \n \nF. \n \n15. \nresettlement,  income  restoration,  administrative  costs,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  comes  to         \nTk478,490,434  ($8,110,007.36).  The  estimates  will  vary  from  town  to  town,  depending  on  the \nnumber  of  affected  persons  and  their  entitlements.  The  Government  of  Bangladesh  will  meet \nthe  entire  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  Government  will  further  guarantee \nmeeting  unforeseen  obligations  in  excess  of  the  budget  cost  estimates  to  ensure  that  the \nresettlement objectives are fully met.  \n \nG. \n \n16. \nThe project director assisted by resettlement specialists and the NGO field staff will be \nresponsible for monitoring the progress of resettlement activities at both project and field levels. \nMonitoring  will  cover  the  administrative  and  socioeconomic  aspects  of  the  resettlement \noperation. In addition to quantitative monitoring, qualitative monitoring will be conducted, using \ninterviews  with  key  informants,  focus  group  discussions  and  other  social  science  research \nmethods.  \n \n\nThe total estimated budget cost, inclusive of costs related to land acquisition, relocation, \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nBudget \n\n17.  Monitoring  will  be  done  both  internally  and  externally.  BWDB  and  LGED  will  internally \nmonitor the progress of resettlement done and will employ an external resettlement agency or \nspecialist  on  an  intermittent  basis  to  provide  an  independent  and  objective  perspective  on  all \nmatters pertaining to implementation of the resettlement plan. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n40 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY (SPRSS)  \n\n \nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nDespite the high incidence of natural disasters and many adverse conditions, Bangladesh has achieved considerable \nprogress over the years in reducing both income and human poverty. Absolute poverty dropped from 58.7% in 1991 to \n49.8% of the population in 2000.1 The declining trend is valid for both rural and urban poverty, the latter having fallen \nfrom 44.9% (1991) to 36.6% (2000). Whereas progress in reducing the head count index of poverty was better in the \nurban areas,  rural  areas  fared  better  in  reducing  the  severity  of  poverty  as  captured  by  trends  in  poverty  gap  and \nsquared poverty gap. The uneven reduction in urban poverty is explained by the greater urban income inequality, as \nthe Gini coefficient increased by 2.3% per year, from 0.307 to 0.368 over the period.  \n \nThe principal reason behind this phenomenon is the steady migration of the resource poor from rural to urban areas in \nsearch  of  employment  and  better  economic  opportunities.  Migration  inflates  the  annual  growth  rate  of  the  urban \npopulation and triggers the sprouting shanty settlements along the towns\u2019 river embankments or in surrounding low-\nlying  areas.  In  some  towns  considered  under  Secondary  Towns  Integrated  Flood  Protection  Phase  II  (STIFPP-II), \nsuch settlements represent more than 25% of the population. The towns are prone to flooding and river erosion, and \nthe poorer income groups, especially recently settled women dwellers, are very vulnerable to disaster. Lack of flood \nprotection  and  inadequate  drainage  lead  to  waterlogging  and  overflowing  of  sewers,  causing  widespread \nenvironmental degradation and deplorable unsanitary living conditions, particularly in slums and squatter areas.   \n \nUrban development is important in reducing the vulnerability of the urban poor and contributes to a safer, less morbid \nliving  environment  for  them  throughout  the  year.  The  provision  of  flood  protection  infrastructure,  drainage,  slum \nimprovement,  and  capacity  assistance  for  improving  urban  governance  will  enable  the  poorer  groups,  men  and \nwomen, to benefit directly from employment created in construction and operation and maintenance (O&M), and from \nadditional social programming around microcredit, income generation, and environmental improvement, all of which \nare indispensable to reduce poverty. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has already lent well over $300 million for \nsix  urban  infrastructure  projects  since  it  began  its  operation  in  Bangladesh  in  the  late  1980s.  The  proposed \nintervention will significantly enhance the gains made so far in urban infrastructure and governance and in reducing \npoverty in the secondary towns of Bangladesh. \n\n \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis   \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nA  socioeconomic  baseline  survey  was  conducted  through  questionnaires,  focus  group  discussions,  and  secondary \ndata  analysis.  Each  town  was  the  subject  of  (i)  an  in-depth  analysis  of  the  incidence  of  poverty;  and  (ii)  extensive \nconsultation  on  people\u2019s  perceptions,  priority  needs,  and  demands  regarding  flood  protection  and  drainage,  basic \nservices,  and  poverty  reduction.  Participatory  urban  appraisal  through  focus  group  discussions  and  stakeholder \nconsultation was undertaken. The survey presents a complete profile of the demographic situation and basic services \navailable in the towns and it supported the feasibility team\u2019s efforts to target the poor and to accommodate their needs \nand  demands  in  town-specific  infrastructure  improvement  plans.  The  survey  documents  existing  socioeconomic \nconditions to be used in monitoring changes and benefits resulting from the project. Population projections up to 2010 \nunderline  the  challenge  facing  the  towns  in  coping  with  rapid  urbanization  and  uncontrolled  growth  of  slum  and \nsquatter areas. Due consideration was given to gender differentials.  \n \nPoverty incidence was found to be 34% overall and as high as 40% in some towns, where income is below the poverty \nline of Tk44,410 per year. Households in hard core poverty survive on incomes of less than Tk36,345 per year, are \nconcentrated in overcrowded slum and squatter areas, and lead a hand-to-mouth existence. There are cases where \n20% (and sometimes more) of the households surveyed in slums are headed by women and the majority live in hard \ncore poverty.  Perception studies strongly  underline  the appeal  of  the poor for employment opportunities and decent  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Bangladesh  Bureau  of  Statistics.  2001.

Washington, DC.  \n\n\f \n\n \nAppendix 11 \n\n41 \n\nwages; their emphasis is on the need to improve drainage for quicker clearance of rainwater and facilitation of normal \nmovement  during  flooding  to  mitigate  the  loss  of  work-days.  Women  are  particularly  concerned  about  shelter  for \nthemselves and their animals, children\u2019s access to schools, as well as access to medicine and health care, especially \nduring floods. Hence the importance of making poverty reduction a strategic objective of each project component was \nestablished.  \n \nPreparation and implementation of a Poverty Reduction Action Plan (PRAP), Urban Governance Improvement Action \nProgram  (UGIAP),  and  Gender  Action  Plan  (GAP)  by  each  town  with  primary  stakeholder participation have been \nsuggested. The capacity of the project towns will be strengthened for participatory local governance and development \nand to address poverty issues throughout project implementation. Emphasis will be on the involvement of women and \nthe  vulnerable  in  community  activities.  Allocation  of  funds  for  microcredit,  income-generating  activities,  skills \ndevelopment, and basic health and sanitation services has been suggested. \n\n \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nPrimary stakeholders, who will benefit directly from the project, include the entire town's population, private property \nowners,  commercial  shops  and  businesses,  private  and  public  sector  institutions,  all  of  whom  are  interested  in  a \nsecure  and  flood-free  environment.  The  poor  will  benefit  from  employment  generated  during  construction  and \nsubsequent O&M and through direct support for environmental improvement and provision of basic services.  \n \nSecondary  stakeholders  as  key  intermediaries  in  project  delivery  are  the  Government's  Executing  Agencies: \nBangladesh  Water  Development  Board  (BWDB)  and  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED);  elected \ntown  representatives  and  administration;  civil  society,  NGO,  community-based  organization  (CBO)  and  women\u2019s \norganizations,  as  possible  partners  to  help  implement  social  and  environmental  programs,  conduct  surveys,  deliver \ntraining, and bring about full participation of women and other disadvantaged groups; private sector engineering firms \nand  contractors  interested  in  survey  and  construction  contracts;  and  ADB  whose  thrust  is  to  ensure  the  loan  will \nactually achieve poverty reduction. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe participation strategy aims principally at the project towns' ownership of the urban development process and their \nsustained  contribution  toward  O&M.  Agreement  on  project  design  was  reached,  clarifying  the  respective  roles  and \nresponsibilities of each stakeholder through extensive consultation. A participatory strategy has been developed and \nthe responsibilities of all stakeholders, agencies, men, and women to implement participatory PRAP, UGIAP, and GAP \nhave been identified. The strategy calls for demand-driven, pro poor, people-oriented and gender-sensitive planning \nand  implementation  methods.  It  will  involve  appropriate  sensitization,  formal  and  on-the-job  training,  and  support \nservices as part of the capacity assistance component for stakeholders and partners at all levels. \n \nTo help implement the project and to ensure participation of the poor and women, each project town will constitute a \ntown- level coordination committee (TCC) with representation from key citizen groups including wom en. Each project \ntown's participatory planning efforts will be strengthened , with emphasis on gender-balanced decision-making bodies \nsuch  as,  TCC,  ward-based  committees  and  gender  and  environment  committees.  Through  meetings,  joint  rallies, \nconsultations, and workshops, each project town will interact with its citizens and ensure their participation. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to Maximize Beneficial Impacts on Women: \n \nThe project has significant gender implications. Poverty reduction and improvement in living standards through flood \nprotection  measures,  drainage,  various  environmental  infrastructure  development,  as  well  as  through  better  basic \nservices and employment opportunities for the urban poor, require that careful attention be given to gender equality in \nall  project  components.  Women\u2019s  empowerment  and  women\u2019s  participation  as  agents  and  beneficiaries  will  be \npursued among both primary and secondary stakeholders. A generic GAP has been prepared and will be adopted by \nthe project towns through a participatory town-level process at the early stage of project implementation. This process \nwas requested by men and women \u2013 town representatives of the Mid-Term Gender Workshop in February 2004. The \nproposed GAP takes into consideration LGED\u2019s Gender Equity Strategy and Action Plan 2002\u20132007 as well as the \nnational  policy  and  other  guidelines  on  gender  equality,  including  ADB\u2019s.  It  takes  examples  from  other  urban \ninfrastructure  projects  such  as  Urban  Governance  and  Infrastructure  Improvement  Project  (UGIIP) and Secondary \nTowns Infrastructure Development Project (STIDP) and has many dimensions. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n42 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \nGender analysis has been applied to all components and contributed to the logical framework of the Project. Gender-\nsensitive indicators, quantitative and qualitative, have been identified and included in the monitoring and evaluation \nplan. \nThe  socioeconomic  survey  has  paid  particular  attention  to  women  head  of  households  (an  average  13.6%  of  the \nsample in slum areas and 9.3% in non-slum areas) and to differentiate/compare perceptions, needs, and demands \naccording to men and women. The study also highlights the particular characteristics of poverty-stricken women.  \n \nWays have been suggested to create employment for women during and after construction, ensure wage equity, and \nattempt  to  increase  the  income  of  poor  women  and  other  disadvantaged  groups.  Surely  the  improved  services  will \nhelp  reduce  women\u2019s  health  hazards  and  ease  their  workloads  of  water  collection  and  solid  waste  management. \nWomen\u2019s needs for privacy will also be taken into consideration by providing adequate toilet facilities for them in public \nplaces and institutions where needed.  \n \nWith reference to the capacity assistance component, the Project will follow UGIAP and GAP to enhance the capacity \nof  female  town  representatives,  ward  commissioners,  and  staff  to  participate  effectively  in  the  project\u2019s  decision-\nmaking  entities.  Female  ward  commissioners  will  receive  separate  training  to  better  play  their  role  in  managing \nmunicipal affairs: they will be mentored to organize local women\u2019s groups and empower them to take part in urban \nplanning and management. Men\u2019s support and strong advocacy from the top are essential ingredients to successful \ngender mainstreaming. Thus gender training\u2013addressed to both men and women\u2013will be offered at all levels and to all \nstakeholders.  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \nGender Action Plan \n \nE.

Most affected people occupying the riverbanks  are \nsquatters and are not entitled to compensation under the \nland acquisition laws of Bangladesh. Under ADB's Policy \non Involuntary Resettlement, however, they are eligible for \nresettlement  benefits  such  as  cash  grants.  By  modifying \nthe  engineering  designs,  in  consultation  with  potentially \naffected  people,  the  Project  will  try  to  further  reduce  the \nneed for resettlement. As a result, people may lose only a \nsmall  part  of  their  residential  or  business  structures, \nespecially those that tend to extend to the riverbank. For \ndrainage improvement works, the Project will acquire only \nsmall  strips  of  land  on  payment  of  compensation  in \naccordance with the land acquisition laws of Bangladesh. \nThis  will  leave  sufficient  land  for  the  affected  people  to \nstay where they are. While minimizing resettlement to the \nextent possible, the resettlement plan will ensure that the \naffected  people,  especially  women  and  other  vulnerable \ngroups, receive assistance so that they would be at least \nas well-off as they would have been without the Project. \n \n \nSince  the  Project  is  within  the  purview  of  national \npriorities,  it  is  assumed  to  be  affordable.  However,  the \nownership  of  benefits  will  be  ingrained  in  the  project \ntowns,  which  have  demonstrated  a  keen  interest  in \nparticipating  in  planning  the  activities  and  in  O&M.

The \nanalysis draws on the socioeconomic survey and flood damage assessment survey carried out \nunder the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) and other available secondary data. \nThe  basic  assumptions  follows:  (i)  capital  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  were \napportioned  into  traded  and  nontraded  components  and  labor;  (ii)  using  the  domestic  price \nnumeraire, financial prices based on June 2004 prices and reduced by duties and taxes were \nconverted  to  economic  prices  by  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.1  for  the  traded-cost \ncomponent and 1.0 for the nontraded-cost component; (iii) a conversion factor of 0.9 was used \nfor the cost of unskilled labor and 0.85 for skilled labor to reflect the real market value of labor, \nwhich is lower than the official wage rates used in the financial cost estimates; (iv) a subproject \ncomponent was assumed to have a useful economic life of 30 years after construction; and (v) \nthe  real  opportunity  cost  of  capital  employed  in  the  analysis  was  assumed  at  12%,  and \nrepresents the social opportunity cost of capital (SOCC) for Bangladesh. \n \nLeast-cost analysis compares alternative options for supplying the same output to meet \n2. \nthe  projected  demand.  Under  the  Project,  however,  no  other  option  is  considered  for  the \nfollowing reasons. First, the project design is based on the lessons learned from phase 1 that \nwas  rated  as  successful.  While  adjustments  are  made  to  reflect  the  lessons  learned,  the \ntechnical solutions under the Project generally employ the same methodologies as those in the \nprevious  loan.  Second,  the  project  design  standard  follows  the  requirements  of  the \nGovernment's policy on water resources management. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  benefits  considered  in  the  economic  analysis  are  (i)  flood  damage  mitigation  for \nbuildings and different types of property, (ii) flood  damage mitigation for municipal infrastructure \nfacilities,  (iii)  flood  damage  mitigation  for  cultivated  land,  (iv)  increase  in  land  values,  and  (v) \nenhanced economic activities. The methodology used in determining the benefits is as follows. \n \n\nEconomic Benefits and Valuation  \n\n1. \n\nFlood Damage Mitigation for Buildings and Other Property \n\n \n\n \n4. \nThe amount of flood damage is determined by the severity and, in the project area, the \nfrequency  of  floods.  Direct  damage  is  caused  by  physical  floodwaters  that  directly  hit houses, \nother buildings and infrastructure, and is generally evaluated as the cost of replacing, repairing, \nor rehabilitating the affected property in the case of urban damage and as the net effect on farm \nincome in the case of crop damage.  \n \n5. \nTwo surveys were conducted under the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) \nto derive the estimates for flood damage costs in the towns of Munshiganj and Manikganj. The \nresults  were  used  as  a  proxy  for  other  towns  for  flood  damage  estimates.  The  survey  data \ncovered  private  buildings,  residential  houses,  shops,  factories,  and  social  infrastructure \n(schools, religious establishments, and hospitals). Three types of floods were assumed for the \nproject areas: 1 in 5 years, 1 in 10  years, and 1 in 50 years. It was further assumed that these \nfloods represent flood depths of 0.5 meter (m), 0.5-1.0, and greater than 1. Table A12.1 shows \nthe  annual  average  cost  that  the  towns  incur  from  flooding  in  their  areas.  For  the  total  project \n\n\f \nAppendix 12 \n\n45 \n\narea, the average annual cost in flood damage is estimated at $17 million, demonstrating a high \ndemand for flood protection works.  \n \n\nTable A12.1: Summary of Flood Damage to Property (annual) \n\nTaka Million \nTown  \n960.9 \nOverall 9 towns \n62.3 \nBrahmanbaria \n34.7 \nGaibandha \n31.3 \nJamalpur \n30.0 \nKushtia \n75.4 \nManikganj \n36.6 \nMunshiganj \n99.8 \nMymensingh \n563.7 \nRajshahi \nSunamganj \n23.5 \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n$ Million \n16.57 \n1.07 \n0.60 \n0.54 \n0.52 \n1.30 \n0.63 \n1.72 \n9.72 \n0.40 \n\nPercent  \n\n        100 \n6 \n4 \n3 \n3 \n8 \n4 \n10 \n59 \n2 \n\n2. \n\n \nFlood Damage Mitigation for Infrastructure facilities \n\n \n6. \nFrequent  floods  also  damage  municipal  infrastructure,  including  drainage  pipes  and \nculverts,  sanitation  and  solid  waste  management  facilities.  However,  there  is  only  sparse \ninformation on flood damage estimates for municipal infrastructure, a situation that is common \neven  in  developed  countries.  Nevertheless,  as  a  result  of  the  devastating  flooding  in  1998, \nexternal agencies required flood damage assessments to be conducted before their assistance \nfor rehabilitation works is sought. The estimates in Table A12.2 are based on reports prepared \nafter the 1998 flooding. The average flood damage to infrastructure is estimated at $0.8 million \nfor three probabilities of flood frequency. The infrastructure works proposed under the Project, \nwhich are integrated with the flood protection works, will eliminate these costs.  \n \n\nTable A12.2: Summary of Flood Damage to Infrastructure  (annual) \nPercent  \n\nTown  \nOverall 9 towns \nBrahmanbaria \nGaibandha \nJamalpur \nKushtia \nManikganj \nMunshiganj \nMymensingh \nRajshahi \nSunamganj \n\nTaka Million \n43.7 \n4.9 \n2.3 \n4.3 \n3.3 \n2.0 \n1.9 \n8.3 \n       14.7 \n1.9 \n     Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n$ Million \n0.75 \n0.09 \n0.04 \n0.07 \n0.06 \n0.03 \n0.03 \n0.14 \n0.25 \n0.03 \n\n100 \n11 \n5 \n10 \n8 \n5 \n4 \n19 \n34 \n4 \n\n3. \n\nFlood Damage Mitigation for Cultivated Land \n\n \n7. \nA  significant  beneficial  impact  of  the  Project  will  accrue  to  agricultural  crops.  In  seven \ntowns,  the  project  areas  have  significant  agricultural  land  within  the  town  boundaries.  The \nproject  works  will  also  result  in  protection  for  substantial  additional  rural  or  agricultural  land \noutside  the  town  boundaries.  Any  flood  protection  works  in  these  towns  will  increase \nopportunities for agriculture. Crop damage due to over-bank spills, inundation, and breaches in \nthe  riverbanks  during  the  premonsoon  and  monsoon  seasons  will  be  reduced  and  flood-free \nlands  will  be  increased.  However,  it  is  also  assumed  that  protected  agricultural  areas  will  be \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n46 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\ngradually urbanized over a 5-year period and therefore any benefits accruing will be for a period \nof 5 years after project completion. The analysis identifies the agricultural land and the type of \ncrops that would be affected. Aman rice crops will be the most significant crop affected by the \nProject and therefore this effect is the one measured to derive agricultural benefits. All cultivated \nland  benefits  are  reduced  by  20%  annually  and  expire  5  years  after  project  completion.  A \nsummary of the annual benefits is in Table A12.3. \n \n\nTable  A.12.3: Increased Production in Cultivated Land \n\nTown \nBrahmanbaria \nGaibandha \nJamalpur \nManikganj \nMunshiganj \nMymensingh \nSunamganj \nTotal \n\nAnnual Benefits \n($million) \n2.09 \n2.93 \n         11.84 \n5.63 \n2.10 \n4.43 \n1.46 \n         30.49 \n\nCultivated \nArea (ha) \n700 \n396 \n3,500 \n1,500 \n790 \n1,472 \n1,110 \n9,468 \n\nBenefit \n($/ha) \n2,985 \n7,399 \n3,383 \n3,754 \n2,664 \n3,010 \n1,318 \n3,220 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n4. \n\nLand Value Increases \n\n \n8. \nSignificant increase in land values is expected. Land value increases, estimated at 8% \nper year,1 will generally favor the urban poor as they are more inclined to occupy the lower-lying \nareas  and  are  the  major  beneficiaries  of  the  flood  protection  works.  It  is  also  expected  that \nincreased land values will cause land and property owners to  consolidate their investments to \ncapture secondary gains. An annual increase of 5% was assumed in phase 1. In calculating the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR), however, land value increases are not included to avoid \ndouble counting of benefits resulting from flood damage mitigation.   \n \n\n5. \n\nEnhanced Economic Activities \n\n \nReducing in the threat of flood (and related) damage in the project area will reduce the \n9. \nuncertainty associated with virtually all economic activity, which, in turn, will irrefutably augment \ninvestment levels, which then translate into further increases in local employment and income. \nAn  attempt  was  made  to  identify  the  multiplier  effects  on  major  items,  such  as  consumer \nproducts,  building  and  petroleum  products,  and  the  demand  that  might arise from the project \nworks. The resultant demand is multiplied by current prices to determine revenues.  \n \n\n6. \n\nIndirect Benefits \n\n \n10. \nOther  benefits  from  the  Project  include  reduced  household  expenditures  on  medical \nservices; reduced costs of removing solid wastes that people dump in canals; reduced costs for \nrepairing  road  and  vehicle  damage  from  flooding;  reduced  travel  delays  caused  by \nwaterlogging;  and  reduced  loss  of  productive  activity  due  to  illness  or  poor  health.  The  main \nindirect benefit is improved workers' productivity due to improved hygienic conditions. While the \nglobal impact of these microchanges is difficult to assess, an attempt was made to arrive at a \nbaseline estimate. For instance, the nationwide per capita government expenditures on health \n\n                                                 \n1  For a conservative indicator of trends in the increase of land prices over the last 7 years House Rent Indices (1984-\n85) of Private Residential Houses for Rajshahi was used, which shows that, on the average, land prices have risen \nby 8% per annum. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n47 \n\nEconomic Rationale \n\nare presently about $2.5/person,2 which is about 0.2% of per capita income in the project area.  \nThus,  if  the  project  works  eventually  made  an  impact  in  the  same  proportion  on  direct  project \nrecipients, the annual benefit will be approximately $3.5 million. This benefit was not used in the \nanalysis, but is quoted to indicate the project\u2019s importance both socially and economically. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nAll  the  project  components  have  a  strong  economic  rationale  since  they  provide \nminimum acceptable standards for basic living conditions and help remove existing constraints \non  social  development  and  economic  growth.  Similarly,  all  components  were  designed  along \nsound  principles  of  priority  needs,  consultation  and  targeting,  and  demand  management and \nrehabilitation  before  new  investment.  They  represent  technically  feasible  options  at  the  least \ncost. Economic analysis is carried out for all the project components combined since the project \nbenefits will be realized from the integrated investments.  \n \n12. \nThe summary of the economic evaluation  (Table A12.4) indicates that the overall EIRR \nis  22.8%.  The  base  EIRRs,  ranging  from  13.5%  in  Rajshahi  and  Sunamganj  to  44.6%  in \nJamalpur,  are  above  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  for  all  towns. When  tested for \nsensitivity,  the  results  remain  robust.  The  Project  relies  heavily  on  the  economic  benefits  that \naccrue  to  the  mitigation  of  flood  damage  to  buildings  and  short-term cultivated land benefits. \nOverall,  the  Project  is  most  sensitive  to  the  timing  of  project  benefits  rather  than  to  adverse \neffects on capital, O&M, and benefit levels. \n \n\nTown \n\nEIRR (%) \n\nTable A.12.4: Summary of EIRRs \n\nCapital Cost \nIncreased  \n10% \n\nO&M Cost \nIncreased  \n10% \n\nBenefits \nReduced  \n10% \n\nBenefits \nDelayed  \n1 year \n\n22.70 \nOverall Project \n  0.04 \nSensitivity Indicator \n20.30 \nBrahmanbaria \n  0.05 \nSensitivity Indicator \n16.20 \nGaibandha \n  0.08 \nSensitivity Indicator \n44.50 \nJamalpur \n  0.02 \nSensitivity Indicator \n14.20 \nKushtia \n  0.06 \nSensitivity Indicator \n33.60 \nManikganj \n  0.03 \nSensitivity Indicator \n18.50 \nMunshiganj \n  0.05 \nSensitivity Indicator \n30.30 \nMymensingh \n  0.02 \nSensitivity Indicator \n13.40 \nRajshahi \n  0.08 \nSensitivity Indicator \n13.40 \nSunamganj \nSensitivity Indicator \n  0.07 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n20.90 \n  0.48 \n18.90 \n  0.46 \n14.40 \n  0.58 \n41.60 \n  0.42 \n13.20 \n  0.45 \n31.10 \n  0.45 \n17.00 \n  0.48 \n28.30 \n  0.43 \n12.20 \n  0.50 \n12.20 \n  0.50 \n\n22.8 \n \n20.4 \n \n16.3 \n \n44.6 \n \n14.3 \n \n33.7 \n \n18.6 \n \n30.4 \n \n13.5 \n \n13.5 \n \n\n20.60 \n  0.52 \n18.60 \n  0.50 \n14.00 \n  0.62 \n41.30 \n  0.45 \n13.00 \n  0.50 \n30.80 \n  0.49 \n16.80 \n  0.52 \n28.00 \n  0.46 \n12.00 \n  0.55 \n12.00 \n  0.55 \n\nCosts \nIncreased, \nBenefits \nDecreased\n18.70 \n  0.69 \n17.00 \n  0.67 \n12.00 \n  0.78 \n38.30 \n  0.62 \n11.90 \n  0.67 \n28.20 \n  0.66 \n15.20 \n  0.69 \n25.90 \n  0.64 \n10.70 \n  0.72 \n10.70 \n  0.72 \n\n19.20 \n  0.65 \n17.60 \n  0.62 \n13.50 \n  0.67 \n35.30 \n  0.73 \n12.80 \n  0.55 \n27.20 \n  0.70 \n16.00 \n  0.62 \n25.30 \n  0.67 \n11.90 \n  0.57 \n11.90 \n  0.58 \n\n                                                 \n2   Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2000.

A poverty impact ratio expressing the \nproportion  of  net  economic  benefits  accruing  to  the  poor  is  calculated  by  comparing  net \neconomic benefits to the poor with net economic benefits to the project as a whole. \n \n14. \nThe  portion  of  the  four  groups  (consumers,  government,  private  sector  and  labor  and \nbeneficiaries)  that  were  classified  as  poor  was  assessed.    For  consumers,  the  town  profiles \nrepresent  an  analysis  of  the  distribution  of  household  incomes  across  a  range  of  monthly \nincomes.  The  bottom  two  groups  classified  as  \u201cpoor\u201d  and  \u201cvery  poor\u201d  were  taken  as  being \nrepresentative  of  the  poor  in  that  particular  town.  Government  represents  the  economic  effect \non the economy as a whole. The poor of the country will share, probably disproportionately, in \nany  increase  or  decrease  in  the  gross  national  product  of  the  country.  In  Bangladesh,  the \nresultant  share  of  the  poor  in  incremental  increase  or  decrease  in  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP)  is  calculated  at  18%.  Although  it  is  inevitable  that  the  poor  will  share  in  net  economic \nbenefits to the private sector, it is assumed that the poor will not share in any benefits allocated \nto  the  private  sector.    On  the  other  hand,  all  net  economic  benefits  allocated  to  labor  and \nbeneficiaries are assumed to reach the poor. The overall poverty impact ratio is estimated to be \n48%. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n49 \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nFinancial Management \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe  financial  analysis  focuses  on  cost  recovery  measures  that  the  municipalities  must \ntake  to  ensure  that  they  will  be  able  to  finance  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M) \nexpenditures associated with local components of the project (drainage, solid waste, sanitation, \nslum  improvement).  Project  capital  costs  as  well  as  the  O&M  costs  for  the  flood  protection \nworks  are  financed  centrally  by  the  Government  and  therefore  will  not  burden  the  municipal \nbudgets.  \n \nB. \n \nAccounting  and  financial  management  of  the  municipalities  are  governed  by  the \n2. \nPourashavas  Ordinance  of  1977.  Municipalities  follow  the  government  system  of  accounting, \nwhich  is  cash-based  financial  reporting  rather  than  accrual-based accounting procedures. The \nassets and liabilities are not accounted for and information on the true cost of providing urban \nservices is not determined precisely. The Government is currently considering a revision of the \n1985  Model  Tax  Rule  which  on  implementation  will  substantially  increase  municipal  income \nfrom sources other than the property tax.  \n \nAs the Project calls for large investments that will have a major impact on cash flows, it \n3. \nrequires  the  project  municipalities  to  follow  a  more  organized  approach  in  managing  financial \nresources. Most of these municipalities are financially weak. Tax collection efficiency is far from \nsatisfactory, annual development grants are used to finance current revenue expenditure, Tax \narrears are increasing, and power bills remain unpaid. Thus, project municipalities have to move \nnow  toward  improved  efficiency  and  additional  resource  mobilization,  not  only  to  meet  the \ncurrent  deficit  but  also  to  meet  the  additional  costs  to  operate  and  maintain  the  project \ncomponents.  \n \n4. \nFollowing  the  lessons  learned  from  phase  1  of  the  Project,  institutionalized  training  to \nimprove  the  financial  management  of  the  project  towns  will  be  provided  through  the \nimplementation  of  the  Urban  Governance  and  Improvement  Action  Program  (UGIAP).  The \nProject  municipalities  will  be  required  to  adopt  a  time-bound  financial  accountability  and \nsustainability action program suggested in the UGIAP. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe main sources of municipal revenue are property taxes; business taxes such as trade \nlicenses, vehicle fees, ferry ghat charges, and user charge where a service is provided; bazaar \nand  other  property  rentals;  and  other  miscellaneous  revenues.  In  addition,  The  Government \nprovides a revenue grant, which includes a grant for salaries and a general grant to compensate \nfor  the  loss  of  revenue  from  octroi,  and  a  development  fund  grant  for  construction  and \nmaintenance of infrastructure under the Government's annual development program (ADP).    \n \nAggregate  annual  revenues  in  the  project  municipalities  are  $8.5  million.  The  average \n6. \nannual  revenue  is  $0.95  million.  The  maximum  and  minimum  revenues  are  $5.3  million  and \n$0.27 million, respectively. Own-source revenues make up one half of total revenues, with the \nbalance provided by the Government as grants (Table A13.1). Rajshahi City Corporation (RCC) \nis the main beneficiary of the development fund grant. In the case of other project municipalities, \nthe  development  fund  grants  are  low,  averaging  $0.07  million  annually.  Similarly,  except  in \nRCC, the revenue grants in lieu of the abolition of octroi are insignificant.  The per capita annual \nrevenue average is $7.0, varying from a high of $13.0 to a low of $2.9. These modest amounts \nare the financial base for all municipal activities. \n \n\nMunicipal Revenue and Expenditure \n\n\f \n\n50 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n \nTable A13.1: Composition of Total Revenues  \nFY 2000/01\u2013FY 2002/03 \n(%) \n\nItem \nOwn Sources \n\nProperty Taxes \nOther  Revenues \n\nSubtotal \n\nGovernment Grants \nRevenue Grants \nDevelopment Fund and Other Capital Grants \nSubtotal \nTotal \n\nAverage \n \n18.3 \n32.4 \n50.7 \n \n2.4 \n46.9 \n49.3 \n100.0 \n\nMaximum \n \n54.2 \n58.5 \n \n \n38.5 \n64.5 \n \n \n\nMinimum \n \n9.3 \n25.1 \n \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n \n\n   Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n7. \nThe  municipalities  can  levy  property  taxes  to  a  maximum  of  27%,  currently  allowed \nunder  the  Pourashavas  Ordinance.  Only  two  project  municipalities,  Brahminbaria  and \nGaibandha, levy property tax at the maximum level allowed. In the others, the property tax rates \ncan be increased from 6% to 10%. Property-based taxes comprise 36.1% of total own-source \nrevenues, and range from 20.2% to 67.8%. Among the nontax revenue sources, \"miscellaneous \nand other\" revenues are dominant at 44%, (Table A13.2).  \n \n\nTable A13.2: Composition of Own-Source Revenues \nFY 2000/01\u2013FY 2002/03 \n\nItem \nProperty Taxes \nBusiness Taxes \nBazaar/Rentals \nOther  Income \n\nAverage \n36.1 \n10.9 \n  8.6 \n44.4 \n     100.0 \n\nMaximum  \n\n67.8 \n21.1 \n28.4 \n59.6 \n \n\nMinimum  \n20.2 \n7.1 \n4.2 \n8.3 \n \n\nTotal Own Sources \n\n Source: Asian Development Bank es timates. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n \nAggregate annual expenditures for the project municipalities are $6.9 million.

The  average  per  capita \nexpenditure is $5.7, varying from a high of $10.5 to a low of $1.4.  \n \nD. \n \n9. \nOverall,  financial  performance  shows  that  the  project  municipalities  rely  heavily  on \ngrants  for  operations,  with  the  average  ratio  of  own-source  revenues  to  total  revenues  being \n0.51.  Only  two  project  municipalities,  Gaibandha  and  Brahminbaria,  manage  to  cover \nexpenditures  with  own-source  revenues.  RCC  fails  to  cover  expenses  on  salaries  from  own-\nsource revenues.  \n \n10. \nThe efficiency of tax collection is an important issue since the project municipalities will \nbe under significant pressure to increase revenues so as to cover incremental O&M costs. The \ntax  collection  performance  (Table  A13.3)  is  below  average  overall  and  is  poor  for  tax  arrears. \nOnly about 50% of the taxpayers pay their taxes on time.   \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n51 \n\nTable A13.3: Property Tax Collection Efficiency \nFY 2000/01\u2013FY 2002/03 \n(%) \n\nCurrent \n52 \n63 \n68 \n66 \n35 \n71 \n42 \n112 \n42 \n65 \n\nTown \nBrahmanbaria \nGaibandha \nJamalpur \nKushtia \nManikganj \nMunshiganj \nMymensingh \nRajshahi \nSunamganj \nAverage \nNote: The budget figures do not provide an accurate measure of arrears or current \ntaxes  owed.

Instead, such measures will increase the tax burden for those who \npay  their  taxes  now,  and  on  time.  The  capacity-building  measures  under  the  Project  are \ntherefore aimed to take aggressive measures to improve collection efficiency for existing taxes \nand expanding the tax base.  \n \nE. \n \n12. \nAdequate O&M practices are critical. Evidence from phase 1 suggests that benefits from \nthe  Project  will  not  be  sustainable  if  the  works  are  not  properly  maintained.  In  the  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA),  O&M  costs  were  developed  separately  for  all \nsubprojects. The O&M cost for the flood protection works is the responsibility of the Bangladesh \nWater  Development  Board  (BWDB).  The  O&M  cost  relating  to  drainage  and  solid  waste \nmanagement  is  the  direct  responsibility  of  the  municipality.  These  costs   (Table  A13.4)  were \nused to assess the financial capacity of the project municipalities under with-project and without-\nproject  situations.  Sanitary  waste  facilities  and  other  slum  improvement  subprojects  will  be \nmaintained by the beneficiaries, and therefore are not a burden to municipal resources.   \n \n\nTown \n\nTable A13.4: Program Costs for O&M \n\nO&M Costs ($/capita/year) \n\nWithout \nProject \n\nWith Project \n\nIncremental  \n\nIncremental Cost per \nHousehold ($/week) \n\nBrahmanbaria \nGaibandha \nJamalpur \nKushtia \nManikganj \nMunshiganj \nMymensingh \nRajshahi \nSunamganj \nAverage  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n1.24 \n0.84 \n0.89 \n0.84 \n0.46 \n0.62 \n0.96 \n0.96 \n0.68 \n0.83 \n\n1.52 \n1.76 \n1.92 \n1.69 \n1.89 \n1.64 \n1.78 \n1.64 \n1.35 \n1.67 \n\n0.27 \n0.91 \n1.02 \n0.86 \n1.43 \n1.02 \n0.83 \n0.68 \n0.66 \n0.85 \n\n0.03 \n0.09 \n0.09 \n0.09 \n0.13 \n0.11 \n0.08 \n0.07 \n0.08 \n0.07 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nCost Recovery \n\nF. \n \n13. \nThe  rates  and  charges  currently  used  by  municipalities  for  cost  recovery  are  not  all \nnecessarily  appropriate  funding  mechanisms  for  recovery  of  incremental  O&M  costs.  The \ndrainage  improvements  and  solid  waste  management  services  confer  a  specific  benefit  to \nindividual  property  owners  as  well  as  a  general  benefit  to  all  community  members  within  the \nmunicipal  boundaries.  The  property  tax  is  a  broadly  based  local  tax  that  allocates  cost  to  tax \npayers in proportion to assessed property values. For this reason, the property tax is the best \nfunding instrument for drainage maintenance and solid waste management services.  \n \n14. \nThe  first  step  toward  cost  recovery  is  tax  reform  involving  an  increase  in  collection \nefficiency and property assessments.  Efforts to update assessments and improve tax collection \nshould be pursued first to realize the full potential of existing property taxes. These efforts will \nalso reduce the implicit cross subsidy that now exists between people who pay their taxes and \nthose who do not. With adequate promotion, this change can increase public acceptance of the \nproperty  tax  system  and  public  willingness  to  accept  future  tax  rate  increases.  The  following \nmeasures are proposed as a cost recovery strategy for municipal O&M costs: \n\nImprove  property  tax  collection  efficiency  and  update  property  assessments.  An \noverall  collection  efficiency  of  80%  and  a  20%  increase  in  assessment  are \nproposed as achievable targets by FY2009. \n\nIncrease property tax rates as needed up to the maximum allowable thresholds to \ncover the remaining funding deficits by FY2009.  \n\nIncrease  other  user  fees  and  charges  as  a  last  resort  if  property  tax  rate \nadjustments do not generate sufficient revenue. \n\nFinancial Projections \n\n \n15. \nA specific charge for solid waste collection from individual households is an appropriate \nuser fee. Such fees are currently used at a neighborhood level in Bangladesh municipalities to \nfinance  waste  collection  services  organized  by  community  groups.  This  funding  arrangement \nhas  the  added  advantages  of  conferring  direct  local  control  on  the  delivery  of  the  service, \ncreating  employment  opportunities  for  low-income  households,  and  providing  market-based \nincentives  to  encourage  efficient  service  delivery.  Project  municipalities  will  therefore  aim  to \nfund  the  solid  waste  management  services  in  a  similar  manner  without  direct  financial  or \noperational involvement. \n \nG. \n \n16. \nAs the subprojects are not direct revenue earning, the capital costs will be financed by \nthe  Government  as  grants.  The  municipalities  therefore  do  not  carry  any  debt  service \nobligations.  Financial  projections  were  completed  to  test  the  sustainability  of  the  proposed \ndrainage  and  solid  waste  management  works  over  the  forecast  period  FY2020.  The analysis \nfocused  on  the  potential  to  finance  municipal  expenditures  using  the  revenue  gained  from \nreform in the property tax collection and assessment system, and raising the property tax rates \nto  a  level  that  covers  the  full  municipal  expenditures.  Where  this  could  not  be  achieved,  the \nproperty tax rate is increased to the maximum allowed level, 27%. Further adjustments will be \nnecessary if total revenues fail to meet the total expenditures. In which case, an increase in the \nnontax rates and charges will  be considered.

In  the  other  four  project  municipalities\u2014Brahmanbaria,  Gaibandha, \nManikganj,  and  Munshiganj\u2014all  costs  were  recovered  with  property  tax  rates  increased  to \nmaximum level of 27%. Only Jamalpur failed to meet the full costs. Jamalpur will therefore need \nto  increase  its  nontax  revenues  by  80%  to  achieve  full  cost  recovery.  The  increase  appears \nlarge,  as  the  current  nontax  revenue  base  in  Jamalpur  is  small.  Alternatively,  property  tax \ncollection efficiency will be achieved at 90%.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n54 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nDescription of Project Components \n\nA.  \n \n1. \nIn  compliance  with  the  environmental  requirements  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB),  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  conducted  for  the  Secondary  Towns \nIntegrated Flood Protection Project  Phase II (STIFPP II), which covers eight towns and one city \n(Rajshahi) in Bangladesh.  The  Project  is  categorized  as  a  B  project  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nOM  Section  F1/OP.  Subcomponents  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  showed  no  significant \nenvironmental  impacts.  Project  activities  that  may  have  a  marginal  effect  and  the  main \nmitigating measures proposed are summarized here. Overall the project is expected to result in \nsubstantial  environmental  benefits.  The  IEE  is  in  agreement  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nGuidelines  (2003)  and  Bangladesh\u2019s  laws  and  regulations,  including  Bangladesh\u2019s  EIA \nGuidelines (1997). \n \nThe Project aims to provide a flood-free and more secure living environment in nine of \n2. \nBangladesh\u2019s secondary towns through flood protection, improved internal town drainage, urban \nenvironmental improvements, solid waste disposal, improved sanitation, capacity building, and \nimplementation assistance. \n \nB.  \n \n3. \nThe main components to be financed by ADB are (i) flood protection works, (ii) drainage \nsystem  improvements,  (iii)  urban  environmental  improvements,  and  (iv)  capacity  building  and \ninstitutional strengthening.  \n \n4. \nThe  flood  protection  works  component  comprises  new  schemes  for  the  towns  of \nBrahmanbaria, Jamalpur, Manikganj, Mymensingh, and Sunamanj where embankments that will \neffectively  convert  them  into  polders  will  surround  the  last  two.  Gaibandha,  Kushtia,  and \nRajshahi will require extension and rehabilitation works. Flood protection works typically include \nbuilding  and  repair  of  flood  walls  (approx.  20  kilometers  [km]);  resection,  rehabilitate,  or \nconstruct  core  wall  embankments  (approx.  70  km);  regulators  and  pipe  sluices  (approx. 90); \nrevetment works, groynes, and spurs (less than 5); and metalling crest embankments.  \n \n5. \nThe drainage system components includes cleaning of existing primary, secondary, and \ntertiary drains; and repair, rehabilitation,  excavation,  construction  and  lining  of  100-150 km of \ndrains and culverts. All structures comprising the drainage system will be designed to resist all \nforces and loads to which they will be subjected. Auxiliary elements will include silt traps, trash \nracks, weep holes, and plot drains. \n \n6. \nMunicipal  engineering  works  comprise  a  solid  waste  management  subcomponent, \ninstallation  of  sanitary  latrines  and  slum  improvement.  Solid  waste  management  will  involve \nestablishing sanitary  landfill  sites  in  eight  towns,  with  provision  for  lining  to  protect  impervious \nsoils  and  groundwater  and  leachate  collection  and  treatment  ponds.  This  subcomponent  will \nalso  provide  for    pilot  composting  facilities  (10  or  2  initially),  demolition  and  disposal of 1,300 \ndustheaps,  solid  waste  transfer  stations,  mechanical  sweeping  equipment,  strainers  for \ncollecting  of  solid  waste  from  drains,  and  transport  facilities  (rickshaws,  pushcarts,  garbage \ntrucks, and bulldozers). The sanitation improvement subcomponent will provide 13,200 sanitary \nlatrines  and  22  public  toilets.  The  slum  improvement  subcomponent  will  supply  basic \ninfrastructure of sanitation, drainage, footpaths, water supply, and lighting.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n55 \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n \nC.  \n \n7. \nThe  STIFPP  II  is  within  the  Asiatic  monsoon  region  in  Bangladesh.  The  area  is  humid \ntropical  with  prolonged  monsoons  for  4-5  months  of  the  year  and  consequent  intermittent \nflooding from May to October in large parts of the country. Elevations of the secondary towns \ngenerally  vary  from  5.5  meters  (m)  to  16.5  m  above  sea  level.  Both  urban  and  rural  areas \nsurrounding  the  nine  towns  are  generally  subject  to  moderate  to  high  flooding  risk  from  the \nadjacent  rivers,  and  internal  runoff  from  intense  or  prolonged  storm  events.    The  current \ndrainage  systems  of  these  towns  consist  of  small,  ad  hoc  drainage  ditches  that  were  able  to \ndirect  water  to  low-lying areas, ponds, khals (water channels), or rivers.  With the increase in \npopulation and building density, paved areas, and reduced green space, urban runoff discharge \nhas  increased  considerably,  often  rendering  existing  drainage  systems  inadequate.    While  the \nofficial  2001  population  figures  for  the  nine  towns  total  1.16  million,  there  are  significant  and \nunaccounted  for  poorer  income  groups,  notably  recently  settled  dwellers  who  are  most \nvulnerable to the impacts of flooding and inadequate drainage. \n \n8. \nSurface waters in rivers, khals, and canals are unsuitable for drinking, but treatment can \nbe  easily  provided.  Groundwater  in  many  areas  of  Bangladesh  is  often  contaminated  with \nnaturally  occurring  arsenic  and  heavy  metals;  therefore,  testing  is  essential.  In  all  nine  cities, \necological resources including fisheries and scarce  natural  forests,  are  declining  due  to  large \npopulation  pressures..  Crops  cultivated  in  the  surrounding  lowland  areas  around  the  towns \ninclude rice, other  grains, and vegetables.  \n \nD.  \n \n\nForecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nLocation \n\n1. \n \nThe proposed schemes are in nine towns located on the banks of powerful rivers. The \n9. \ntowns are subject to regular internal and external floods. Earthquakes have been reported in the \narea;  however,  their  magnitude  over  the  past  100  years  was  below  4  on  the  Richter  scale. \nEnvironmental  risks  associated  with  structural  failure  will  be  prevented  through  the  strict \nimplementation of Bangladesh\u2019s Building Rules.  \n \n10. \nProject construction will require total land acquisition of 47.26 hectares (ha) for drainage \nand  flood  control  works,  which  affect  1,835  households.  A  comprehensive  compensation \nprogram has been produced in conjunction with an entitlement matrix to ensure that involuntary \nresettlement addresses compensation to replace lost assets, livelihood and income, assistance \nin  relocation  sites  for  appropriate  facilities  and  services,  and  assistance  in  rehabilitation  to \nachieve the same level of well-being. \n \n11. \nProject implementation will result in the conversion of small amounts of rural agricultural \nland,  with  associated  loss  of  trees  and  crops,  and  reduced  fishponds  for  construction  of  flood \nprotection  structures,  drainage  system  and  landfill  sites.  The  constructor  will  optimize  the \nengineering design ensure that environmental impacts to the ecosystem are minimized.  \n \n12. \nLocations of landfill and solid waste transfer stations need in some cases to be finalized \nand future design should address associated complexities. Future selection should ensure that \nsuitable  sites  will  have  minimal  exposure  to  flooding;  be  located  away  from  populated  areas, \nnear to a clay source or located on clays; have minimal resettlement requirements; and have a \nlocation  with  minimal  local  nuisance  hazards.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n56 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \n\nprocedure  has  been  prepared  to  guide  the  environmental  assessment  for  each  landfill \nsubproject to facilitate compliance with the environmental requirements of the Government and \nADB.  An  environmental  appraisal  and  subproject  brief  (EASB)  will  be  prepared  by  the  Local \nGovernment  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  and  submitted  to  the  Town  Office.  Careful \nscreening of potential subprojects based on environmental criteria will be conducted based on \nthe  review  of  EASB  by  the  Environmental  Section  of  the  Town  Office.  For  any  selected \nsubproject,  LGED  will  prepare  a  full  environmental  assessment  report  including  public \nconsultation  and  an  environmental  management  plan  with  specific  mitigating  measures  and \nfinancial sources as prerequisite for approval of credit. A monitoring program will be developed \nto  ensure  that  none  of  the  landfill  subprojects  will  have  major  adverse  environmental  impacts. \nThe  environmental  criteria  for  site  selection  and  the  detailed  environmental  assessment  and \nreview procedure for landfill subprojects are provided in the IEE. \n \n\n2. \n\nDesign \n\n \n13. \nThe  riverbank  will  have  significant  positive  impacts  by  protecting  the  productive \nagricultural land and homestead from progressive river erosion, that would result in associated \ndisplacement  of  households.  However,  active  structures  (groynes,  spurs,  guide  bunds)  and \npassive structures (bank protection structures, revetments) built on the riverbank will also cause \nmorphological impacts, affecting the river flow and, to a certain extent, shaping the riverbed and \nthe  river  course.  Bank  protection  structures  planned  for  the  project  are  passive  structures. \nThese  should  be  well-aligned  with  the  direction  of  the  flow  to  minimize  bank  erosion.  River \ntraining in the form of active structures is, however, also part of the project. As a result, erosion \nupstream and downstream from the selected towns may occur. The aim to minimize erosion at \nupstream  and  downstream  locations  will  ultimately  affect  a  number  of  individuals  and \nvegetation.  Flood  modeling  will  be  undertaken  as  part  of  engineering  design.  River  training \nworks will also have a small impact on aquatic organisms. \n \nInterference  of  drainage  facilities  with  other  utilities  is  possible  during  construction  of \n14. \nnew drains. The situation will be mitigated through utility mapping and keeping minimal distance \nlocations.  Overflow  and  bypassing  hazards  may  occur  in  areas  serving  large populations. For \nthis  purpose  appropriate  sizing  and  material  selection  will  be  essential.  The  cost  estimate  will \nhave a budget provision for relocating and restoring or replacing damaged utilities to minimize \nthe negative impact.   \n \n15. \nAppropriate waste segregation is essential to ensure a good operating a sanitary landfill \nsite  and  successful  composting  facilities.  The  Project  will  provide  equipment  for  segregating \nwaste  during  collection,  to  be  further  confirmed  in  waste  transfer  centers.  In  addition,  a \ncomprehensive  solid  waste  management  plan  will  be  developed  for  each  of  the  nine  towns \nbefore loan disbursement starts. Leachate may contaminate soil and groundwater if no proper \nleachate collection system is provided. To prevent the problem, all landfill sites will be sanitary. \nThe design should incorporate (i) waste segregation and recycling with the solid waste disposal \nsystem to maximize the service life of the landfill; (ii) a proper sanitary lining, preferably of  clay \nor geosynthetic fabric; (iii) a system to properly collect and treat leachate; and (iv) the design of \na  collection  system  for  landfill  gases.  Equipment  should  be  provided  for  waste  segregation \nduring  collection  and  in  waste  transfer  centers.  When  finalized  site  selection  is,  a  full \nconsultation  process  with  affected  people  will  be  conducted  during  the  detailed  design  stage.   \nEndorsement from ADB will be sought before initiating construction activities. \n \n16. \nSanitation facilities to be provided under this Project will include only sanitary pit latrines \nfor households that do not have the financial resources to install them, and public toilets. Where \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n57 \n\npossible,  sanitary  latrines  will  be  two  pit  latrines  or  be  provided  with  septic tanks. Poor latrine \ndesign will attract insect vectors. \n \n\nConstruction Impacts on Physical Environment \n\n3. \n \n17. \nDuring  construction,  a  large  amount  of  sand  will  have  to  be  transported  to  the  sites. \nStorage of sand and sand-filled geo-bags at the project site may generate dust. Impacts during \ntransport and storage of sand will be minimized by covering the sand or by keeping the surface \nwet.  If  sand  is  to  be  transported  by  boat,  boatowners  will  be  required  to  keep  their  engines \nproperly  maintained  to  reduce  air  pollution  from  exhausts  and  oil  spills  in  the  water  courses. \nSimilar practices will be observed for land transportation. \n \nSite construction activities such as digging of drains or landfill site landscaping will also \n18. \ngenerate  dust,  noise,  vibration  that  will  affect  both  workers  on-site  and  the  nearby  population. \nSoil erosion may result from land preparation activities. Proposed mitigating measures include \nuse  of  dust  suppression  techniques  such  as  water  sprays,  covered  wagons  and  skips;  work \nwithin  agreed-upon  hours;  plants  and  equipment  with  low  operating  noise  levels;  and  limiting \nexcavation and land leveling works during the rainy season. \n \n19. \nExtensive  sand  mining  or  sand  from  land  immediately  adjacent  to  the  riverbanks  may \ncause  substantial  erosion  in  these  areas.  An  alternative  solution  is  sand  dredging  from  river \nbeds,  since  construction  will  take  place  over  a  period  of  5  years  and  the  dredged  volume  is \nconsidered  small  with  respect  to  the  estimated  annual  bed  load  transport.  Establishment  of \nworking  areas  and  storage  of  sand  and  sand-filled  geo-bags  at  the  project  site  may  damage \nlocal vegetation and degrade the topsoil, affecting its productivity. Removing the topsoil from the \nstorage site and returning it on completion of construction may be appropriate; however, sand \nstorage site selecting in areas with no topsoil (sandy areas) would be more appropriate.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConstruction Impacts on Ecosystems \n\n \n20. \nDuring  construction,  sediments  may  reach  the  aquatic  habitat  due  to  sand  mining, \ntransport, storing, filling of sandbags, and dumping. Slope preparation that may be necessary at \nsome  stretches  would  spread  sediments.  However,  the  expected  increase  in  sediment \nconcentration is not considered higher than that generated at present by river erosion and may \nbe considered minor. \n \nThe  Project  will  not  encroach  into  terrestrial  habitats  of  significance.  On  completion, \n21. \nhowever, the embankment in some areas may prevent some terrestrial fauna from coming to \nthe  river  to  drink.  Given  the  urban  nature  of  many  of  the  sites,  the  impact  on  terrestrial \necosystems  is  expected  to  be  minimal.  During  construction,  noise  may  disturb  the  scarce \nwildlife  and  birds  in  the  vicinity.  Measures  undertaken  to  minimize  impacts  to  the  surrounding \npopulation will also be of benefit to the ecosystems. \n \n\nConstruction Impacts on the Surrounding Population \n\n5. \n \n22. \nReduced vehicle accident risk and preventing disturbance resulting from increased traffic \nvolume  will  be  enforced  through  a  sound  traffic  management  plan  promoting  traffic  flow  and \nfocusing on the highly populated areas or schools. Interaction with the public will be encouraged \nthrough continuous dialogue and information exchange, establishing a procedure for recording \nand  dealing  with  complaints,  and  workers  instruction.  Good  health  and  hygiene  practices  at \nwork  and  reduced  work  accidents  will  be  achieved  by  means  of  an  occupational  health  and \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nsafety  plan  (OHSP),  which  will  include  emergency  plans,  personnel  basic  training,  first-aid \nprovisions,  and  a  comprehensive  domestic  solid  waste  management  plan  and  sanitation \nfacilities  for  the  construction  camp.  Most  of  these  measures  will  also  be  enforced  during  the \noperation stage at the site. \n \n\nOperation \n\n6. \n \n23. \nIntense  floods  can  last  for  2  months  of  the  year,  preventing  the  opening  of  gates  and \nsluices  and  therefore  discharge  of  drains  into  the  watercourses.  The  water  then  remains \nstagnant  and  concentrates  in  lower  areas  of  the  town,  possibly  creating  an  insect-breeding \nhabitat.  While  internal  hydrological  studies  were  conducted  to  address  some  of  the  issues \nduring  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA),  a  sanitation  and  wastewater \ntreatment management plan will be formulated for each of the nine towns to suggest appropriate \nsanitation measures. \n \n24. \nAs part of the mitigating  measures implemented in the solid waste management center, \nregular  pest  (rodents  and  insects)  treatment  will  be  carried  out.  Moreover,  an  OHSP  ensuring \nthe  safety  and  good  health  of  the  operators  in  those  centers  will  be  formulated  and  endorsed \nbefore  starting operation.   \n \nThe  proposed  landfill  is  anticipated  to  produce  significant  amounts  of  gases,  e.g. \n25. \nmethane  and  carbon  dioxide.  In  addition,  gases  like,  hydrogen  sulfide,  carbon  monoxide,  and \nammonia may be formed in small quantities from decomposing solid waste. These are odorous \ngases and may create nuisance and health hazards to nearby communities if not controlled. In \naddition,  they  may  have  some  negative  effect  on  the  vegetation  of  the  area.  Mitigating \nmeasures  proposed  to  minimize  the  negative  impacts  include  provision  of  proper  soil  cover, \nbuffer zone, planting, and a proper gas control system. The option to reuse methane as biogas \nfor power production may also be considered at the detailed design stage. \n \n \n26. \nIt  is  envisaged  that  traffic  loads  in  the  area  approaching  the  landfill  site  may  increase \ndue to the movement of transfer vehicles, and their affect the community and cause nuisance \nand health risks. Mitigating measures will include transport of waste during times of light traffic \nto  minimize  gas  emissions  in  busy  areas,  provision  of  a  traffic  management  plan  and  close \ncoordination between municipalities and traffic police personnel for smooth execution. \n \n27. \nThe presence of silt and solid waste in drains may obstruct the flow, resulting in overflow \nor  flooding,  and  further  environmental  pollution  in  areas  along  the  drains.  Provision  must  be \nmade for cleaning and desilting by the municipalities. The  design must consider accessibility of \nthe drains. \n \nOperation and regular maintenance of both latrines and toilets and sanitary landfill site \n28. \nare  essential  to  achieve  the  objectives  of  environmental  improvement.  This  issue  will  be \naddressed  in  detail  in  the  solid  waste  management  plan  and  sanitation  and  wastewater \nmanagement  plan  to  be  formulated  before  loan  effectiveness  for  each  of  the  nine  secondary \ntowns. Impacts to be addressed will include safety of health workers and the neighborhood, pest \nprevention, collection and disposal of treated leachate, waste segregation, reuse and recycling, \npublic  awareness  and  required  training,  and  operation  linkages  with  the  private  sector  for \nfertilizer conversion.  \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n59 \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure  \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring Plan and Institutional Requirements  \n\nGroundwater supply systems to be provided in the slum areas will address evaluation of \n29. \naquifer  resources  before  extraction  to  prevent  depletion,  and  water  testing  before  safe \nconsumption. \n \nE.  \n \n30. \nTechnical  and  institutional  mitigating  measures  will  be  incorporated  in  the  detailed \ndesign of the Project. Measures of a planning, functional, institutional and procedural character \nhave to be included in the site selection criteria, in the tender documents, and in the OHSP and \nthe  traffic  plan.  Mitigating  measures  related  to  the  construction  works  will  be  stated  in  the \ncontract  with  the  contractor.  The  project  management  unit  (PMU),  LGED,  and  Bangladesh \nWater  Development  Board  (BWDB),  and  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  in  the  project \ntowns  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  and  enforcement  during  construction.  During  the \noperational  phase,  the  communities  undertaking  solid  waste  management  activities,  and \nmunicipal  authorities  aided  by  BWDB  and  LGED  will  be  responsible  for  implementing \nenvironmental  measures  in  the  sector  of  water  and  municipal  engineering,  respectively.  The \nexecuting  agency  will  obtain  relevant  environmental  clearances  from  the  Department  of \nEnvironment before implementing of any civil works activities. The Department of Environment \nwill  be  responsible  for  overseeing  overall  environmental  compliance  and  environmental \nmonitoring.  During  its  review  missions,  ADB  will  also  assess  environmental compliance in the \ndifferent towns. \n \nF.  \n \nFormal  and  informal  consultation  exercises  were  undertaken  during  preparation  of  the \n31. \nproject preparatory technical assistance (PPTA). Municipal and government officials were also \ninterviewed  and  their  views  solicited  regarding  STIFPP  II  goals  and  objectives.  A  total  of  57 \nmeetings and formal and informal consultations were carried out in the nine towns of concerned. \nMeetings were held with  affected groups, municipal authorities, and various sectors of society \nwithin  the  vicinity  of  the  project  sites.  Other  groups  consulted  included  villagers,  town \ninhabitants, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs). Main issues of interest included (i) the \nneed  for  an  efficient  solid  waste  management  system,  (ii)  access  to  safe  drinking  water,  (iii) \nneed  for  flood  protection  and  flood  embankments,  and  (iv)  desire  for  an  environmental \nawareness campaign. In addition, in agreement with ADB\u2019s information disclosure requirements, \nthis summary IEE will be available worldwide through the depository library system and the ADB \nweb site. \n \nG.  \n \n32. \nin  nine  cities.  Positive \nenvironmental  impacts  result  from  protecting  the  towns  against  recurrent  internal  and  external \nfloods,  improving  overall  internal  drainage,  managing  solid  waste,  and  improving  sanitation.   \nMitigating  measures  and  an  environmental  monitoring  plan have been formulated to minimize \nnegative environmental impacts.  \n \nH.  \n \n33. \nThe  proposed  Project  will  significantly  improve  the  overall  environmental  quality  of  the \nparticipating secondary towns. The Project will not have significant environmental impacts and \nclassification  B  is  appropriate.
