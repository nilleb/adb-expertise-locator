The  activity  of  leasing  companies  in  Sri  Lanka  is \nconstrained  by  the  need  to  borrow  at  short  maturity  to  fund  a \nbusiness  that  lends  at  a  longer  maturity.  The  underdeveloped \nnature of the corporate debt market in Sri Lanka has made nonbank \nleasing  firms  heavily  dependent  on  commercial  banks  for  their \nfunding through short-term borrowings and commercial paper. This \nhas  resulted  in  maturity  mismatches  in  asset  and  liabilities  and \nhigher cost of funds for these institutions. \n \nThe proposed loans from ADB to the two companies will give them \naccess  to  long-term  funds\u2014enabling  them  to  promote  alternative \nand  more  competitive  financing  instruments  to  SME  entrepreneurs \nto  promote  their  operations  and  profitability  and  enhance  their \ncompetitiveness.  \n \nThe  proposed  loans  will  be  used  to  provide  leasing  facilities  to \nSMEs, especially to support business in rural areas in Sri Lanka. \n \n(i) \n\nPLC  was  established  in  August  1995  as  a  fully  owned \nsubsidiary of People\u2019s Bank, the second largest state-owned \nbank  in  Sri  Lanka.  PLC  is  incorporated  as  a  private  limited \nliability company. It has been the market leader in the leasing \nsector in Sri Lanka for the past 5 years. \n\n \n(ii)  CLC,  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  third  largest  specialized  leasing  company, \nwas  established  in  1988.  Initially,  the  principal  shareholders \nwere  Commercial  Bank  of  Ceylon  Limited  and  Singer  (Sri \nLanka). In May 1989, Chemanex Limited was admitted as the \nthird principal shareholder. The company was converted to a \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\nJustification \n\n \nLoan Terms \n\n \nEnvironmental and \nSocial Safeguards \n\n \n \n \n \n\npublic  company  in  June  1992  and  is  listed  on  the  Colombo \nStock Exchange.  \n\n \nThe  companies\u2019  focus  on  SMEs  will  improve  funding  availability  to \nsections of the Sri Lankan economy left underserved by commercial \nbanks.  \n  \nFrom a development perspective, a well-functioning leasing industry \nis an important financing tool for SMEs. The lack of assets that can \nbe  used  as  collateral  for  bank  loans  particularly  constrains  SMEs. \nWhen credit is available from informal sources, it tends to be short-\nterm  and  too  costly  for  investment  financing.  Leasing  and  supplier \ncredit  are  often  the  only  source  of  credit  available  to  SMEs.  By \noffering leasing companies debt with maturity similar to the duration \nof  leases,  ADB  will  (i)  improve  the  competitiveness  of  the  leasing \nsector,  and  (ii)  promote  the  development  of  SMEs  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s country strategy for Sri Lanka. \n \nBy  strengthening  the  leasing  sector,  this  project  can  also  boost \ncapital  markets  development.  Once \nleasing  companies  have \nestablished  an  operating  history,  they  can  tap  equity  and  debt \nmarkets.  As  a  follow-up  to  an  earlier  loan  provided  by  ADB  to \nanother  leasing  company  in  Sri  Lanka  (Lanka  Orix  Leasing \nCompany  Limited  [LOLC]),  ADB  is  in  discussions  with  LOLC  to \nassist it in the securitization of part of its lease portfolio. \n \nIt  is  expected  that  about  400  SMEs  will  be  assisted  through  lease \nfinancing,  which  would  result  in  additional  capital  formation,  value \nadded,  employment  and  foreign  exchange  earnings/savings,  and \npromotion of new entrepreneurs. This is fully in line with the focus of \nthe  Government  of  Sri  Lanka,  which  has  given  priority  to  the \ndevelopment  of  enterprises  by  new  entrepreneurs  and  of  the  SME \nsector in general.  \n \nThe  proposed  loans  will  be  in  US  dollars.  The  maximum  tenor  of \nboth  loans  will  not  exceed  5  years.  The  interest  rate  will  be  the \nmarket rate for this type of borrower and instrument. The proposed \nloans  will  have  the  benefit  of  security  over  certain  assets  of  the \nborrowers. \n \nBoth  companies  have  been  classified  category  FI  with  respect  to \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  and  category  C  with  respect  to \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  Policy  on \nIndigenous  Peoples  (1998).  No  involuntary  resettlement  or  any \nimpact  on  indigenous  peoples  is  expected  from  the  activities \nfinanced by ADB\u2019s loans.  \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  the  proposed \nloans  of  (i)  up  to  $10  million  to  People\u2019s  Leasing  Company  Limited  (PLC),  and  (ii)  up  to  $7.5 \nmillion to Commercial Leasing Company Limited (CLC).  \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nEconomy  \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nSri  Lanka  is  a  trade-oriented  economy,  partly  because  of  its  lack  of  natural  resources. \nWholesale and retail trade (trade in exports, imports, and domestic goods and services) is the \nlargest  single  subsector,  accounting  for  21.6%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2005.  The \ncombined  services  sector\u2014which  includes  transport,  communications,  financial  services,  and \ntourism\u2014generates more than 55% of GDP. Telecommunications, the most dynamic subsector, \nhas consistently recorded a double-digit annual growth rates since 1998.  \n \n3. \nManufacturing  accounts  for  60%  of  total  industrial  output.  The  sector  also  includes \nmining,  electricity,  water,  and  construction.  Privately  owned  export-oriented  factories  produce \nover  95%  of  manufacturing  output.  The  manufacturing  base  is  dominated  by  the  garment \nindustry, although the production of food and beverages, as well as chemical and rubber-based \ngoods,  is  also  considerable.  Although  its  significance  has  declined  in  the  recent  years,  the \nagricultural sector remains important, directly accounting for around 17% of national output and \nemploying over one third of the workforce.  \n \n4. \nAlthough  privatization  has  reduced  the  role  of  the  public  sector  in  manufacturing,  the \nstate  continues  to  dominate  the  financial  sector  and  utilities,  and  has  a  quasi-monopoly  in \nhealthcare and education. It is also the largest property owner (90% of all land). The role of the \nGovernment of Sri Lanka (the Government) in the employment market is also substantial. Over \n1 million people are employed in the civil service and semigovernmental bodies, meaning that \nSri Lanka has one of the highest ratios of public employees to population in Asia. Expenditure \non  civil  servants  and  the  huge  political  establishment  accounts  for  around  one  third  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s recurrent expenditure, equivalent to almost 6% of GDP in 2005. \n \n5. \nIn  late  December  2004,  a  major  tsunami  claimed  about  31,000  lives,  left  more  than \n6,300 missing and 443,000 displaced, and destroyed an estimated $1.5 billion worth of property. \nGrowth, partly spurred by reconstruction, reached 5% in 2005 and more than 7% in 2006, the \nhighest recorded growth since 1978. The GDP growth rate was 6.4% for the second quarter of \n2007. \n \n6. \n$1 billion a year home\u2014the third highest foreign exchange earner for the country. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nlarge  share  of \nestablishments  and  employment  in  Sri  Lanka:  80\u201390%  of  the  total  number  of  enterprises  and \n75%  of  employment  (including  the  agriculture  sector).  At  the  sector  level,  SMEs  account  for \n65% of total tea production, 50% of apparel and garment manufacturing, more than 70% of the \npublic bus transportation sector, 80% of domestic trade activities, 45% of tourism and recreation \nservices,  and  50%  of  the  local  construction  industry.  Within  the  manufacturing  sector,  SMEs \n\nAbout 800,000 Sri Lankans work abroad (90% in the Middle East) and send more than \n\nSmall- and Medium-Sized Enterprise Sector  \n\nSmall-  and  medium-sized  enterprises \n\n(SMEs)  account \n\nfor  a \n\n\f 2 \n\nProblems Affecting the SME Sector  \n\naccount  for  about  96%  of  industrial  units,  36%  of  industrial  employment,  and  20%  of  value \nadded.  Enterprises  employing  5\u201329  workers  are  predominant  in  terms  of  the  numbers  of \nestablishments among SMEs. The typical unregistered firm employs family labor, supplemented \nby  2\u20133  hired  workers.  However,  the  industrial  value-added  figure  is  only  20%  of  the  national \ntotal.  \n \n8. \nDespite their potential importance, the performance of SMEs is not easy to measure in \nSri Lanka, as definitions of SMEs have varied considerably over time and between institutions. \nConventionally, employment numbers are used to classify SMEs. In Sri Lanka, enterprises are \ndivided into (i) small-scale enterprises with 5\u201349 employees, (ii) medium-scale enterprises with \n50\u2013149  employees,  and  (iii)  large-scale  enterprises  with  more  than  150  employees.  On  this \nbasis, and in terms of the International Standard Industrial Classification of industries, SMEs are \nfound in all subsectors of the economy, with a concentration in the manufacturing sector.  \n \n9. \nHowever, the definition adopted by various banks suggests the need for a more liberal \nenterprise fixed asset value, excluding land and buildings, of SLRs100 million (about $1 million) \nto capture the full extent of SMEs in Sri Lanka. \n \nC. \n \n10.  More than 80% of the SMEs in Sri Lanka have difficulty accessing financial services and \nsecuring financing. This is mainly due to (i) a strong risk-adverse bias of banks with respect to \nSME  lending;  (ii)  the  absence  of  a  diversified  financial  sector  capable of  serving  SMEs,  partly \ncaused by weaknesses in the judicial system as it applies to registering and enforcing security \ninterests;1  (iii)  concentration  of  SME  lending  in  Colombo,  Gampaha,  and  Kalutara;  and  (iv) \nlimited availability of medium to long-term credit. \n \n11. \nSME loan sizes are small. Relative to larger firms that borrow in larger amounts, banks \nincur  higher  administrative  and  processing  costs  on  their  SME  portfolios.  The  available \ninformation, track record, and reputation of a potential SME borrower is also likely to be limited, \nas  is  the  financial  accounting  system\u2014adding  further  to  the  costs  of  loan  processing  and \nincreasing  the  uncertainty  and,  consequently,  the  credit  risk.  The  probability  of  failure  is  high, \neven for well-conceived new ventures. Therefore, banks offer lending rates that are significantly \nhigher than for large enterprises. The higher lending rates limit SMEs\u2019 access to credit from the \nformal financial sector.  \n \nTo  address  the  various  constraints  experienced  by  the  SME  sector  and  to  create  the \n12. \nenabling  environment,  the  Government  commissioned  a  task  force  in  2001  to  study  and \nrecommend  actions  to stimulate  the  SME  sector  (Appendix  1  contains  an  overview  of  the  key \nrecommendations).  This  resulted  in  the  presentation  of  a  white  paper  in  20022  and  the \nestablishment of an SME Authority by an act of parliament in March 2006.  \n \n13. \nThe  Government\u2019s  development  agenda,  outlined  in  its  discussion  paper  \u201cMahinda \nChintana\u201d,3  provides  a  10-year  development  framework  (2006\u20132016).  It  embodies  combining \nmarket-based economic policies, including foreign direct investments, with support for domestic \nenterprises. To achieve high growth rates, emphasis is on investments in infrastructure and the \nknowledge economy, with focus on regional development.

To  address  regional  inequalities,  the  Government  has \ntaken  forward  its  commitment  for  facilitating  regional  public  infrastructure  development. \nResources  have  also  been  earmarked  in  the  budget  for  promoting  value  addition  in  SME \nproduce through research and development. Import duty has also been removed on machinery \nand equipment for sectors such as tea, rubber, and coconut coir. \n \nD. \n \nThe  past  two  decades  witnessed  significant  financial  reforms  in  Sri  Lanka.  Reforms \n14. \nThese comprised interest rate deregulation, restructuring of state-owned banks, allowing entry \nof  private  sector  financial  institutions,  easing  restrictions  on  foreign  financial  institutions, \nreducing  directed  lending,  and  a  shift  in  the  focus  of  banking  sector  supervision  from  micro-\nintervention towards prudential regulations. As of 30 June 2006, the Sri Lankan financial sector \nconsisted  of  (i)  23  licensed  commercial  banks  (11  domestic  private  banks  and  12  foreign \nbanks);  (ii)  14  licensed  specialized  banks  (6  regional  development  banks,  1  national  savings \nbank,  2  state-sponsored  long-term  lending  institutions,  2  housing  finance  institutions,  and  3 \nprivate savings and development banks); (iii) 28 registered finance companies; (iv) 13 insurance \ncompanies; and (v) 2 public pension funds.  \n \n15. \nThe  banking  sector  is  the  dominant  subsector,  accounting  for  about  57.5%  of  the  total \nassets of Sri Lanka\u2019s financial system. Even though a large number of licensed banks exist in \nthe country, the stability of the financial system is primarily dependent on the performance and \nfinancial  strength  of  the  six  largest  licensed  commercial  banks,  consisting  of  the  two  state-\nowned banks and the four large domestic private commercial banks.   \n \n16. \nThe two state-owned banks, People\u2019s Bank and Bank of Ceylon, play an important role \nin the domestic banking sector\u2014holding over 40% of commercial banking assets. Although the \nmarket  shares  of  People\u2019s  Bank  and  Bank  of  Ceylon  have  significantly  dropped  in  the  last  5 \nyears, while the share of private banks\u2019 total assets grew from 34.5% in 1998 to 43% by the end \nof  2005,4  the  state  banks  have  nationwide  branch  networks  and  have  mandates  to  meet  the \npolicy  objectives  of  providing  financial  services  throughout  the  country  and  targeting \ngovernment  priority  sectors  rather  than  pursuing  purely  commercial  objectives.  However,  they \nremain highly inefficient and undercapitalized.   \n \n17. \nNonetheless,  with  continued  reforms  being  undertaken,  the  nonperforming  loan  (NPL) \nratios of the state-owned banks declined from 18% in 2003 to 8% in June 2006, and reached \nsimilar levels to those of domestic banks. Capital adequacy ratios have also improved to 8% of \nthe total assets, and steps have been taken to further enhance the regulatory and supervisory \nframework\u2014including plans to adopt the Basel II capital accord by 2008. \n \nCommercial interests and competition for deposit and loan customers have led a number \n18. \nof the commercial banks to lend more aggressively to SMEs. Banks such as Sampath, Hatton \nNational Bank, and Commercial Bank of Ceylon are playing a lead role in this regard. Although \nencouraging,  these  resource  mobilization  activities  will  primarily  fund  activities  that  carry  less \nrelative  risks  for  banks,  such  as  housing  and  car  loans,  and  then  be  available  for  lending  to \nSMEs.  Their  volume  is  also  limited,  given  the  relatively  high  short-term  interest  rates. \nAdditionally,  high  unit  transaction  costs  in  processing  relatively  small  SME  loans  remains  a \nproblem. Appendix 2 contains details and the structure of the financial sector in Sri Lanka. \n \n\n                                                      \n4 International Monetary Fund. 4 April 2006. Financial Sector Quarterly Update. Washington: IMF.  \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nThe Leasing Sector in Asia \n\nE. \n \n19. \nIn most developing countries, capital markets are relatively undeveloped and banks are \noften unable or unwilling to undertake term lending. Banks prefer to lend to larger, established \nin \nbusinesses  with  well-developed  balance  sheets  and  credit  histories.  Operations \nmicroenterprises  and  small  businesses  are  cash  flow  oriented  but  rarely  have  organized \nhistorical financial records or the assets needed for collateral for conventional bank financing.5 \nAs  such,  in  developing  countries  in  general  but  in  Asia  in  particular,  there  is  an  often  unmet \nneed for lease financing from SMEs. \n \n20. \nThe  leasing  industry  in  Asia  makes  an  important  contribution  to  the  region\u2019s  economic \ndevelopment  by  providing  a  financing  tool  to  both  large  enterprises  and  SMEs.  In  doing  so,  it \nincreases the level of private investment in capital equipment. The proposition that underlies the \nconcept of leasing is that an enterprise earns profit from the use of assets rather than ownership \nof  assets.  In  developing  countries  with  unclear  property  rights,  poorly  functioning  asset \nregistries, and weak laws of secured transaction, leasing can provide an attractive alternative to \nboth lessees without collateral and lessors wishing to improve the possibility of repossession if \nnecessary. \n \n21. \nBy supporting policy reforms and contributing private sector investment, ADB has played \na  critical  role  in  launching  the  leasing  industries  in  a  number  of  Asian  countries  such  as \nBangladesh,  India,  Indonesia,  Pakistan,  and  Philippines.  However,  the  leasing  industries  in \nmost  of  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  remain  underdeveloped.  A  recent  study \ncommissioned  by  ADB6  on  the  leasing  industry  in  13  DMCs  indicated  that  the  total  annual \nleasing volume in these countries is less than $7 billion compared to a global industry of over \n$500 billion, and accounts for an average penetration of 0.4% of GDP7 versus more than 1.0% \nin developed countries. \n \nF. \n \n22. \nSri  Lanka  recorded  a  leasing  penetration  of  approximately  2.7%  of  GDP  in  2006, \naccording  to  the  Leasing  Association  of  Sri  Lanka.  This  is  significantly  larger  than  that  of  any \nother DMC in the region, mainly because the leasing sector in Sri Lanka developed much earlier \nthan  in  other  DMCs  in  the  region,  and  local  banks  were  very  reluctant  to  extend  credit  to \nSMEs\u2014enabling leasing companies to fill the gap. \n \nSri Lanka\u2019s leasing industry is driven by 72 entities, which include 20 specialized leasing \n23. \ncompanies  (SLCs),  28  finance  companies,  15  commercial  banks,  and  9  licensed  banks.8  The \nannual  total  disbursements  of  finance  leases  of  all  registered  leasing  firms  increased  to \nSLRs78.8 billion ($0.70 billion) as of 31 March 2007 from SLRs64 billion ($0.62 billion) in 2006.9 \nOf the 20 SLCs, 7 companies accounted for 83% of the total assets.10 The total assets of these \nSLCs  increased  by  25%  to  SLRs67  billion  from  the  year  earlier,  while  total  finance  leases \nincreased by 11% to SLRs29 billion. \n\nThe Leasing Industry in Sri Lanka \n\n                                                      \n5  World  Bank.  2002.

Annual Report 2006, Colombo: Central Bank of Sri Lanka. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nThe  pinnacle  years  in  the  Sri  Lankan  leasing  industry  were  2005  and  2006,  recording \n24. \n20%  growth  in  the  inception  of  new  businesses.  Leasing  companies  reported  increases  in \nprofitability  from  a  low  of  25%  to  200%  in  2006.  Most  of  the  new  market  entrants  were  bank \nsubsidiaries rather than specialist leasing companies, creating fear among existing companies \nthat the newcomers were largely aggressive, opportunistic, and ready to dominate the market\u2014\nbut unlikely to stay if there was a market downturn. The market became divided between formal \nleasing  companies  and  informal  companies  that  use  leasing  and  hire  purchase11  to  disguise \ntheir intent to diversify their ability to lend. \n \n25. \nA  high  concentration  of  the  leasing  portfolio  of  SLCs  is  in  vehicle  financing  (81%). \nHowever,  the  risks  associated  with  possible  defaults  are  largely  mitigated  by  the  nature  of \nfinance leases, where the vehicle is considered the security and SLCs have absolute ownership \nof such vehicles. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) does not consider this concentration a \nmajor risk to the industry, as vehicles financed are used for purposes such as public transport, \ngoods transport, and personal use by clients. However, CBSL is encouraging SLCs to diversify \ntheir  leasing  portfolios  by  providing  facilities  for  the  purchase  of  capital  equipment  such  as \nmachinery. \n \n26. \nThe NPL volumes reported by the seven largest SLCs have shown a decreasing trend \nrecently.12 The NPL ratio of SLCs reached 2.9% (30 June 2006). The share of NPLs relating to \nleases continued to decline and reached 6.1% as of 30 June 2006. Appendix 3 contains further \ninformation on the leasing sector in Sri Lanka. \n \nG. \n \n\nADB\u2019s Sector and Country Strategy and Assistance to the Leasing Sector \n\n1. \n\nSector Strategy \n\n \n27. \nADB has been actively promoting the leasing industry in Asia. It has provided a number \nof technical assistance (TA) projects to support the emergence of leasing, which has proved its \neffectiveness\u2014particularly in countries where the banking sector was not able to offer loans with \nadequate tenor to secure the acquisition of capital goods.  \n \nIn June 2005, ADB commissioned an internal research paper on the leasing industry in \n28. \nits  DMCs.  The  paper  identified  the  following  opportunities  for  ADB  interventions:  (i)  the  non-\nautomobile  equipment  segment  remains  underfunded,  (ii)  sustainable  local  currency  medium-\nterm funding is insufficient, (iii) increased focus is needed on SMEs and rural enterprises, and \n(iv) successful development of leasing sectors should be replicated in new geographical areas. \nADB developed this initiative to increase SMEs\u2019 access to finance, and support rapid growth of \nthe leasing sector in Sri Lanka. \n \n\n2. \n\nCountry Strategy  \n\n \nADB\u2019s  country  and  strategy  program  2004\u20132008  for  Sri  Lanka13  acknowledges  the \n29. \nimportance  of  private  sector  development  as  a  key  way  of  accelerating  GDP  growth,  creating \njobs, and raising efficiency and productivity in all sectors.  \n\n                                                      \n11 Hire purchase is a means of obtaining the use of an asset before payment is completed.

In this \nrespect, ADB\u2019s strategy is two-pronged:  \n \n\nthe  country  and  strategy  program  states  ADB\u2019s  support \n\nto \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPromote an enabling environment for private sector development using ADB\u2019s \npublic sector window.  \nDirectly invest in private sector companies using loans and equity.  \n\nADB\u2019s Private Sector Development Strategy \n\nThe  country  strategy  and  program  update  2006\u2013200814  also  emphasized  the  need  for \n\n \n31. \nADB to promote SME development and microfinance.  \n \nThe  proposed  loans  would  also  align  with  ADB\u2019s  current  poverty  reduction  strategy,15 \n32. \nwhich  states  that  ADB  seeks  to  promote  \u201csound  and  efficient  banking  systems  and  capital \nmarkets,\u201d  since  these  are  seen  as  \u201cindispensable  for  macroeconomic  stability,  mobilizing \nsavings, and ensuring availability of long-term financing, an essential requirement for pro-poor \ngrowth.\u201d  \n \nH. \n \nADB\u2019s  private  sector  development  strategy16  specifically  refers  to  ADB\u2019s  role  in \n33. \nstrengthening  DMC  capital  markets,  including  the  leasing  sector,  and  notes  the  critical \nimportance  of  well-functioning  financial  systems  for  the  private  sector.  Many  DMCs  need  to \nstrengthen  their  financial  institutions  and  create  diversified  financial  markets  that  can  finance \nprivate  sector-led  growth.  ADB  has  supported  financial  sector  reform  programs  through  public \nsector operations and/or direct investments in financial intermediaries in several DMCs (footnote \n8). \n \n34. \nThe  strategy  notes  that  ADB  will  complement  funding  with  capacity  building  and \ngovernance  strengthening  for  financial  institutions.  It  will  support  policy  reform  to  enhance \nregulation  and  supervision,  develop  sound  financial  systems,  and  deepen  and  broaden \nsecurities markets (footnote 8). The proposed loans are consistent with this strategy.  \n \nI. \n \n35. \nADB\u2019s approach to facilitating financial sector development in the short to medium term \nis to (i) promote good governance over the financial markets by improving the understanding of \nkey  governance  principles  and  best  practices,  building  capacity  for  good  governance,  and \ninstitutionalization  of  good  governance  principles  through  organizational  restructuring;  (ii) \nmobilize financial resources from commercial sources, and when necessary, with the support of \nADB\u2019s  guarantee  facility,  for  relending  to  private  sector  companies  through  domestic  financial \ninstitutions;  and  (iii)  develop  a  network  of  specialized  financial  institutions  (e.g.,  cooperatives, \nnongovernment organizations, and credit funds) and mainstream suitable credit facilities among \nexisting \n(including \nmicroenterprises, small- and medium-scale industries, retail low cost housing, and rural areas). \n \n\nADB\u2019s Financial Sector and SME Strategy for Sri Lanka \n\nthe  weaker  economic  sectors \n\nintermediaries \n\nfinancial \n\ntarget \n\nto \n\n                                                      \n14 ADB. 2005.

Continuing  ADB  support  in  this  area  has \nincluded development of contractual savings institutions, alternative sources of medium to long-\nterm  funds,  the  insurance  industry  and  pension  and  provident  funds,  and  liberalization  of \ninvestments of these institutions to include private securities in the capital market. \n \n37. \nThe  following  initiatives  are  expected  to  deepen  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  the \nfinancial markets as well as enhance corporate governance: (i) developing securitized debt and \nequities  markets  under  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Development  Program \n(ii) \nstrengthening  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission;  and  (iii)  the  introduction  of  a \nsecuritization bill and amendment of the Securities and Exchange Commission Act (1991) under \nthe  ongoing  Financial  Markets  Program  for  Private  Sector  Development  Program.19  The \nongoing  Fiscal  Management  Reform  Program20  is  also  helping  to  create  an  enabling \nenvironment  to  foster  mobilization  of  tax  revenues,  improve  the  effectiveness  of  public \nexpenditures,  accelerate  fiscal  decentralization,  and  improve  coordination  to  place  public \nfinances  on  a  sustainable  path.  These  structural  measures  are  long-term  initiatives  whose \nimpact  will  only  gradually  take  hold  after  consistent  implementation.  ADB  is  also  providing \nextensive support for infrastructure development that will enhance the competitiveness of SMEs \nand provide the basis for a higher GDP growth rate. \n \n38. \nIn  addition  to  policies  introduced  by  the  SME  policy  unit  at  the  National  Enterprise \nDevelopment  Authority,  the  ADB-financed  SME  Sector  Development  Program21  established \npolices  to  reduce  the  cost  of  operating  and  financing  SMEs\u2014including  reduction  of  corporate \nincome tax for SMEs, abolition of turnover tax on banking and financing activities, harmonization \nof tax incentives, and the abolition of stamp duty on letters of credit.

It  commenced  operations  on  31  May  1996  and  is  a  fully  owned \nsubsidiary of People\u2019s Bank, which is the second largest bank in the country and owned by the \nGovernment. PLC was initially established to carry out finance leasing for customers of People\u2019s \nBank. To date, it has a network of 18 branches across Sri Lanka and has access to the branch \nnetwork of People\u2019s Bank, which is the largest in the country. \n \n40. \nIn 1996, PLC became  a participative credit institution for a concessionary line of credit \nbacked by the Government of India and given to the Government of Sri Lanka, through People\u2019s \nBank.  By  using  this  line  of  credit,  long-term  credit  is  extended  to  purchase  capital  goods  of \nIndian  origin.  Having  access  to  this  funding  mechanism  has  been  instrumental  for  PLC  to \nbecome  a  dominant  player  in  financing  public  transport  vehicles.  Unlike  other  leasing \ncompanies, PLC has targeted the passenger bus transportation sector in Sri Lanka, which has \nbeen plagued by underinvestment for several years.  \n \n41. \nPLC was one of the first SLCs to be selected as a participating finance institution for the \nADB-funded  Tea  Development  Project,22  which  started  in  1999  and  was  completed  in \nDecember  2005.  The  project  was  designed  to  assist  the  Government  in  (i)  increasing  the \nincome  of  tea  smallholders  within  a  sustainable  system,  and  (ii)  improvement  of  the \nenvironment.  The  project  focused  on  institutional  reforms  to  increase  the  efficiency  and \neffectiveness of tea-related institutions, and to direct more funds for replanting. It provided credit \nfinancing channeled through participating financial institutions for (i) replanting, (ii) rehabilitation \nand modernization of tea factories, (iii) commercial production of high quality planting materials, \nand  (iv)  facilities  for  collection  and  transportation  of  green  leaf.  The  project  also  strengthened \ntea  smallholder  development  societies  and  producer  associations,  improved  workers\u2019  housing \nand sanitary facilities, provided rural feeder roads, and produced afforestation. \n \n42.  More  recently,  PLC  became  a  participating  finance  institution  for  ADB\u2019s  Plantation \nDevelopment  Project,23  which  aims  to  develop  the  plantation  sector  of  Sri  Lanka.  Under  this \ncredit scheme, regional plantation companies and their subsidiaries and sub-lessees are eligible \nto borrow loans. The project commenced in 2003 and will end in 2009. \n \nIn  November  2005,  PLC  established  the  Islamic  Finance  Services  Unit\u2014functioning \n43. \nunder Shariah Law\u2014with the objective of venturing into the untapped market for Islamic finance \nin Sri Lanka. This is the first such unit to be set up by any leasing company in Sri Lanka. The \nkey  difference  between  Islamic  and  conventional  finance  is  the  role  of  interest.

The  credit  facility \nagreement was recently signed between the Government and AFD to borrow \u20ac10 million. The \nproject has the following components: (i) Construction Sector Development Project (\u20ac9 million), \nand (ii) the creation of an advanced construction training academy (\u20ac1 million). \n \nB. \n \nCLC,  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  third  largest  specialized  leasing  company,  was  established  in  1988. \n46. \nInitially,  the  principal  shareholders  were  Commercial  Bank  of  Ceylon  Limited  and  Singer \n(Sri Lanka).  In  May  1989,  Chemanex  Limited  was  admitted  as  the  third  principal  shareholder. \nThe company was converted to a public company in June 1992 and CLC is listed on Colombo \nStock Exchange.

Facilitated  by  the  Strategic  Enterprise  Management  Authority,  the  mission  made  a \npresentation on ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations to about 20 SOEs, including People\u2019s Bank and \nPLC. Meetings were also held between ADB and PLC as a follow-up to the presentation. \n \n48. \nThe loan to CLC was discussed in detail with the company during an ADB mission to Sri \nLanka in June 2007. The mission met with CLC, which conveyed interest in obtaining financial \nassistance  from  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  initial  contact  with  CLC  was  arranged  by  the  Maldives  Finance \nLeasing  Company,  which  had  received  financing  from  ADB  via  the  South  Asian SME  Leasing \nFacility approved in March 2007 (footnote 14). \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nProposed Loans \n\nB. \n \n49. \nADB  assistance  to  both  leasing  companies  will  be  in  the  form  of  secured  loans  in  US \ndollars. The tenor of both loans will be 5 years and principal repayments will be amortizing. The \nproceeds  of  the  loans  to  both  companies  will  specifically  fund  SME  clients  of  their  leasing \nbusiness.  The  loans  will  be  secured  by  a  charge  on  a  portfolio  of  already  existing  lease \nreceivables of each individual company \n \nSince  both  loans  from  ADB  will  be  denominated  in  US  dollars,  ADB  has  discussed  in \n50. \ndetail  how  the  companies  intend  to  hedge  themselves  against  possible  currency  risks.  Both \ncompanies  will  retain  the  funds  borrowed  from  ADB  and  place  them  in  a  foreign  currency \ndeposit with a local bank without converting them to local currency and then borrow Sri Lanka \nrupees  against  this  deposit.  They  have  followed  the  same  funding  strategy  with  all  their  other \noutstanding foreign currency loan commitments.  \n \n51. \nThe proposed loans will be sourced from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and will carry \nan interest rate based on the London interbank offered rate plus a margin determined by ADB\u2019s \nPricing and Credit Enhancement Committee. The committee will also determine the amount of \nupfront and commitment fees.  \n \nC. \n \n52. \n \n\nPricing will be determined by the Credit Enhancement and Pricing Committee of ADB.  \n\nPricing \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n \n\n \n\nJustification for ADB Participation \n\n1. \n\nPrimary Objective \n\na. \n\nStrengthen the Leasing Industry \n\n \nThe  proposed  ADB  assistance  is  expected  to  strengthen  the  leasing  industry,  and \n53. \nexpand the funding resources and financial services available to the SME sector in Sri Lanka. \nThe  activity  of  leasing  companies  in  Sri  Lanka  is  constrained  by  the  need  to  borrow  at  short \nmaturity  to  fund  a  business  that  lends  at  a  longer  maturity.  The  underdeveloped  nature  of \ncorporate  debt  market  has  made  nonbank  leasing  firms  heavily  dependent  on  commercial \nbanks for their funding through short-term borrowings and commercial paper. This has resulted \nin maturity mismatches in asset and liabilities, and higher cost of funds for these institutions. \n \n\nb. \n\nPromote SME Growth \n\n \n54. \nThe proposed loans from ADB to the two companies will provide them access to long-\nterm funds, and enable them to promote alternative financing instruments to SME entrepreneurs \nto promote their operations and profitability and enhance their competitiveness. \n \n55. \nThe  Project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  Sri  Lanka.  It  will  promote  private \nsector participation in SME development. The demonstration effects related to long-term funding \nwill be positive. \n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nThe Project also complements ADB\u2019s public sector approach, as exemplified by ADB\u2019s \n56. \nrecent financial markets loan (footnote 21). This program is intended to facilitate participation of \nthe  private  sector,  including  SMEs,  in  the  Sri  Lankan  economy  by  supporting  government \nreforms to eliminate impediments to and develop opportunities for their involvement.  \n \n\nc. \n\nImprove Broader Capital Markets Development \n\n \n57. \nLeasing  companies  can  also  boost  capital  markets  development.  Once  they  have \nestablished an operating history, they can tap and foster equity markets. Their demand for term \ndebt  broadens  the  term  lending  options  for  banks,  finance  houses,  pension  funds,  and \ninsurance  companies.  They  can  also  issue  bonds  or  other  marketable  instruments.  Finally, \nleasing  companies  can  securitize  their  lease  receivables,  taking  some  assets  off  the  balance \nsheet to achieve higher leverage and better returns and adding another tradable instrument to \nlocal capital markets. ADB is currently in discussions with LOLC, which received an earlier loan \nfrom ADB,24 regarding possible securitization of part of their lease portfolio whereby ADB would \nprovide a guarantee to guarantee the issue and/or purchase the mezzanine tranche of such a \nstructured transaction. This would represent one of the first true sale securitization deals in the \ncapital markets of Sri Lanka. \n \n\nd. \n\nRationale for Adopting Subsovereign Modality in the Case of PLC \n\n \n58. \nThe  proposed  nonsovereign  loan  to  a  government-owned  entity  such  as  PLC  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s policy to provide financial assistance to public sector enterprises without \ngovernment  guarantees,  provided  that  they  satisfy  the  criteria  of  autonomy  and  managerial \nfreedom in operating the enterprise concerned. As outlined in ADB\u2019s Innovation and Efficiency \nInitiative,25 numerous SOEs are creditworthy and have the long-term financial viability to borrow \nwithout  government  guarantees.  They  constitute  a  \u201cthird  generation\u201d  of  potential  ADB  clients, \nincreasingly  important  as  borrowers  separate  from  the  sovereign.  These  entities  play  an \nimportant role in creating employment and providing basic public services. Giving them access \nto affordable long-term credit is critical to promoting economic growth. PLC has been the market \nleader  in  the  leasing  industry  in  Sri  Lanka  for  the  past  5  years  and  has  been  competing  with \nmore  than  70  private  sector  owned  entities.  It  has  experienced  management,  which  has \nconsistently  shown  strong  financial  performance,  and  has  built  up  sizeable  experience  and \nexposure  in  SME  financing.  It  clearly  fits  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Innovation  and  Efficiency \nInitiative to provide nonsovereign financing to SOEs with a strong balance sheet, track record, \nand private sector focus. \n \n\n2. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n \n59. \nAssuming an average lease size of $50,000, it is expected that about 400 SMEs will be \nassisted through lease financing, which would result in additional capital formation, value added, \nemployment, and foreign exchange earnings/savings and promotion of new entrepreneurs. This \nis fully in line with the focus of the Government, which has given priority to the development of \nenterprises by new entrepreneurs and of the SME sector in general.  \n \n60.  Moreover, a robust leasing industry has the potential to contribute to the development of \ncapital  markets  by  introducing  SMEs  to  formal  financial  markets  and  providing  demand  from \nleasing companies for capital markets funding. \n\n                                                      \n24 ADB. 2007.

The development impact will be measured in \nthree  distinct  categories:  (i)  private  sector  development,  (ii)  business  performance,  and  (iii) \neconomic sustainability. \n \nB. \n \n62. \nEnvironment.  This  financing  is  classified category  FI.  All  borrowers  will  be  required  to \nadopt  appropriate  environmental  management  systems  in  accordance  with  the  guidelines  in \nAppendix 11.  \n \n63. \nSocial Safeguards. This financing is classified category C. No involuntary resettlement \nor any impact on indigenous peoples is expected as a result of this financing. All sub-borrowers \nare extremely small and serve individuals and SMEs. Their clients are in the private sector and \ndo  not  have  the  power  to  trigger  involuntary  resettlement.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \nC. \n\nAnticorruption  Policy:  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n\nRecords, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n64. \nThe borrowers have been advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) and policies relating to the combating of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire  PLC  and  CLC  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls \nfollowing international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging  in  such  activities.  The  documentation  between  ADB  and  each  company  will  further \nallow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \nD. \n \n65. \nThe  borrowers  will  (i)  maintain  accounting,  management  information,  and  financial \ncontrol  systems  acceptable  to  ADB;  (ii)  maintain  independent  auditors  from  auditing  firms \nlicensed  to  operate  in  Sri  Lanka  and  acceptable  to  ADB  and  will  authorize  such  auditors  to \nsubmit  financial  statements  to  ADB  at  least  annually;  and  (iii)  permit  ADB  representatives \naccess  to  all  sites  where  its  activities  are  conducted  as  well  as  to  its  books,  accounts,  and \nrecords, and will permit ADB (if and when it deems necessary) to engage auditors at their own \nexpense to audit the accounts and accounting systems of each company. The deadline for the \nsubmission of audited accounts will be 120 days from the end of each year; and narrative and \nunaudited  financial  information,  including  a  balance  sheet  and  income  statement  of  the \ncompanies, must be submitted within 40 days from the end of the relevant quarter. \n \n\nVI. \n\nEXPOSURE LIMITS \n\n \n66. \nIf  approved,  these  loans  will  be  ADB\u2019s  seventh  and  eighth  nonsovereign  investment  in \nSri Lanka. They will represent 1% of ADB\u2019s total nonsovereign portfolio and will increase ADB\u2019s \nexpected  exposure  to  the  nonbank  financial  institutions  and  specialized  banks  from  6.1%  to \n6.4%,  and  its  aggregate  expected  exposure  to  Sri  Lanka  from  1.1%  to  1.6%.  The  proposed \nloans are within approved exposure limits.  \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n67. \nConsistent  with  the  provisions  of  the  Charter,  ADB  will  obtain  confirmation  from  the \nGovernment that it has no objection to ADB financing prior to any funding being made available. \n \n68. \nADB  will  enter  into  suitable  loan  and  security  documentation  and  other  required  legal \ndocuments,  following  approval  of  the  proposed  financing  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors.  These \nagreements will be on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n \n69. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve loans of (i) up to \n$10,000,000  to  People\u2019s  Leasing  Company  Limited  (PLC),  and  (ii)  up  to  $7,500,000  to \nCommercial Leasing Company Limited (CLC), from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, on such \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, or as \nmay be subsequently reported to the Board. \n \n \n \n\n \n31 October 2007 \n\nLiqun Jin \nVice President \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \nKey Recommendations \n \n(i) \n\nNATIONAL STRATEGY FOR SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISE \nSECTOR DEVELOPMENT IN SRI LANKA \n\nThe  Government  should  adopt  the  vision  for  the  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprise \n(SME)  sector  as  set  out  in  the  white  paper  to  provide  policy  direction  for  the  future \noverall strategy and plans for implementation. \nUse  the  definition  recommended  by  the  task  force  as  a  standard  for  data  collection, \npolicy analysis, and implementation of SME sector development programs. \nEstablish  a  high-powered  SME  policy  unit  at  the  Ministry  of  Enterprise  Development, \nIndustrial Policy, and Investment Promotion. \nEstablish an SME authority, a full-fledged autonomous institution for SME development. \nFacilitate  ongoing  restructuring  activities  of  the  Investment  Development  Board  with \nnecessary funding and administrative support. \nImprove and consolidate financial assistance available for SMEs. \nImplement  low-cost  credit  negotiation  and  project  monitoring  activities  initiated  by  the \nInvestment Development Board. \n\n(viii)  Encourage the active participation of venture capital companies and leasing companies \n\nto provide credit support for SMEs. \nDisburse loan and allied facilities with the assistance of business development services \n(BDS) providers. \nAmend  the  Loan  Recoveries  Act  (1990)  and  provide  opportunities  for  distressed \ncompanies to be restructured. \nInstall financial discipline in SMEs. \nEstablish technical service centers at district level. \n\nIntroduce a voucher scheme for SMEs to engage in research and development work. \n\nInitiate low-cost advertising and sales promotion programs for SMEs. \n\n(xi) \n(xii) \n(xiii)  Establish a technology development fund. \n(xiv) \n(xv)  Create an SME website. \n(xvi) \n(xvii)  Commission an annual survey and a magazine on SMEs. \n(xviii)  Maintain a comprehensive and up-to-date BDS database. \nIntroduce a voucher scheme for SMEs to use BDSs. \n(xix) \n(xx) \nIntroduce a simplified tax system for SMEs. \n(xxi)  Obtain World Trade Organization concessions for SME development. \n(xxii)  Organize productivity enhancement programs for SMEs. \n(xxiii)  Create industrial parks for SMEs in rural areas. \n(xxiv)  Form industry clusters on a subsector basis. \n(xxv)  Promote  subcontracting  with  proper \n\ntargeting \n\nto \n\ncapabilities. \n\nimprove  SMEs\u2019 \n\ntechnological \n\n(xxvi)  Launch  an  awareness  program  on  cleaner  production  targeted  at  SMEs,  focusing  on \n\ncost savings and efficiency benefits of cleaner production. \n\n(xxvii)  Enhance  the  capability  of  government  and  private  BDSs  to  assist  SMEs  in  cleaner \n\nproduction and environmental management. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n15\n\nDETAILS AND STRUCTURE OF THE SRI LANKAN FINANCIAL SECTOR \n\n \n1. \nThe financial sector in Sri Lanka includes most of the institutional elements of a modern \nfinancial  system,  reflecting  a  broad  range  of  reforms  introduced  since  the  early  1990s.  The \nbanking  sector  dominates  in  terms  of  assets  but  a  range  of  other  institutions  offers  financial \nservices.  At  the  end  of June  2006, the  Sri  Lankan  financial sector  consisted  of  (i)  23  licensed \ncommercial banks (LCBs), of which 11 are domestic private banks and 12 are foreign banks; (ii) \n14  licensed  specialized  banks  (LSBs),  of  which  6  are  regional  development  banks,  1  national \nsavings  bank,  2  state-sponsored  long-term  lending  institutions,  2  housing  finance  institutions, \nand  3  private  savings  and  development  banks;  (iii)  28  registered  finance  companies;  (iv)  13 \ninsurance companies; and (v) 2 public pension funds.   \n \nFrom June 2005 to June 2006, total assets of the financial institutions increased by 18%, \n2. \nreaching  SLRs3,706  billion  which  is  1.3  times  the  country\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP). \nLCBs  and  LSBs,  which  accounted  for  57.4%  of  the  total  assets  of  the  financial  system, \ncontinued  to  hold  a  dominant  position  in  the  financial  sector.  LCBs  contributed  58.6%  of  the \nasset growth of the financial system (Table A2). \n \n\nTable A2.1: Total Assets and Deposit Liabilities of the \nMain Institutions in the Financial System \nJune 2006a \n\nAssets \n\nSLRs  \nbillion \n473.9 \n2,644.4 \n2,073.2 \n1,647.0 \n329.9 \n97.1 \n571.2 \n456.0 \n46.7 \n68.5 \n343.7 \n32.0 \n26.8 \n5.2 \n280.2 \n62.5 \n107.5 \n110.2 \n31.5 \n25.3 \n1.5 \n4.7 \n3,462.0 \n \n\n% \nShare \n13.7 \n76.4 \n59.9 \n48.0 \n9.5 \n2.8 \n16.5 \n13.2 \n1.3 \n2.0 \n9.9 \n0.9 \n0.8 \n0.2 \n8.1 \n1.8 \n3.1 \n3.2 \n0.9 \n0.7 \n0.0 \n0.1 \n100.0 \n \n\n% Share \n\nDeposit Liabilities \nSLRs \nbillion \n \n1,355.5 \n1,355.5 \n1,068.0 \n237.8 \n52.8 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n29.0 \n29.0 \n24.2 \n4.8 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n1,384.5 \n \n\n \n97.9 \n97.9 \n77.0 \n17.2 \n3.7 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n2.1 \n2.1 \n1.7 \n0.3 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n100.0 \n \n\nFinancial  \nInstitution \n\nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka \nInstitutions Regulated by the Central Bank \n     Deposit Taking Institutions \n          Licensed Commercial Banks \n          Licensed Specialized Banks \n          Registered Finance Companies \n     Other Institutions \n          Employees\u2019 Provident Fundb \n          Primary Dealers \n          Specialized Leasing Companies \nInstitutions not Regulated by the Central Bank \n     Deposit Taking Institutions \n          Rural Banks \n          Thrift and Credit Cooperative Societies \n     Contractual Savings Institutions \n          Employees\u2019 Trust Fund \n          Private Provident Funds \n          Insurance Companies \n     Other Specialized Financial Institutions \n          Merchant Banks \n          Venture Capital Companies \n          Unit Trusts \n     Total \na  Provisional. \nb Administered by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. \nSource: Central Bank of Sri Lanka \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nLicensed  Commercial  Banks.  The  banking  sector  continued  to  be  the  dominant \n3. \nsubsector,  accounting  for  about  57.5%  of  the  total  assets  of  the  financial  system.  LCBs \naccounted for the majority share, at 48% of the entire financial system\u2019s assets and 77% of total \nbanking sector assets (Table A2). \n \n4. \nLCBs  have  broad  business  powers,  and  generally  have  subsidiaries  and  affiliates \nengaged  in  all  areas  of  the  financial  services  market.  The  three  state-owned  institutions\u2014\nPeople\u2019s Bank, Bank of Ceylon, and National Savings Bank\u2014have the largest branch networks \nand  number  of  deposit  accounts.  These  institutions  play  an  important  role  in  the  domestic \nbanking sector, given their mandates to meet the policy objectives of providing financial services \nthroughout the country and to target government priority sectors.  \n \nMajor private commercial banks have widened their networks to cover almost the entire \n5. \ncountry, with four leading private commercial banks\u2014Hatton National Bank, Commercial Bank \nof  Ceylon,  Seylon  Bank,  and  Sampath  Bank\u2014accounting  for  85%  of  the  assets,  90%  of  the \ndeposits,  and  85%  of  the  loans  granted.  While  there  are  11  foreign  banks  in  Sri  Lanka,  only \nHong  Kong  and  Shanghai  Banking  Corporation  (HSBC)  with  10  branches  and  Standard \nChartered  with  9  branches,  compete  in  the  retail  market.  Collectively,  these  foreign-owned \nbanks account for about 18% of commercial bank assets but only about 9% of loans\u2014reflecting \ntheir  much  higher  liquidity.  However,  these  indicators  understate  the  importance  of  foreign \nbanks, as they carry out the majority of trade finance activities in the country. Many medium to \nlarge businesses in Sri Lanka have a relationship with at least one of the foreign-owned banks, \nmainly because of the need for letters of credit from banks with an international reputation.  \n \nThe  performance  of  LCBs  improved  further  in  2006  in  terms  of  growth  of  assets, \n6. \nexpansion  in  delivery  channels,  improvements  in  risk  management,  risk  absorption  capacity, \nand  use  of  information  technology.  The  growth  of  total  assets  of  domestic  private  banks  and \nstate-owned  banks  was  45.3%  and  30.6%.  Assets  of  foreign-owned  banks  grew  at  a  rate  of \n24.2%. \n \n7. \nTotal assets grew by 31% in 2006, mainly attributed to the overall increase in loans and \nadvances  fuelled  by  expansion  of  credit  by  state  banks  and  domestic  private  LCBs.  State-\nowned  LCBs  recorded  the  highest  growth  in  loans  and  advances  of  44%,  followed  by  foreign \nLCBs with growth of 25%. \n \n8. \nLicensed Specialized Banks. The 14 LSBs, which all compete with commercial banks \nin  some  products,  were  established  to  provide  specific  services\u2014often  to  address  perceived \nmarket failures. Lending by LSBs was concentrated in housing, industrial, and financial sectors. \n \n9. \nNational Savings Bank is by far the largest LSB. It is the second largest deposit-taking \ninstitution  in  Sri  Lanka,  behind  Bank  of  Ceylon.  National  Savings  Bank  operates  largely  as  a \ndeposit-taking  institution,  providing  savings  accounts  through  its  112  branches  and  investing \nabout 80% of total assets in government debt.    \n \nLSBs  also  include  development  financing  companies.  Sri  Lanka  has  two  primary \n10. \ndevelopment  finance  companies\u2014Development  Finance  Corporation  of  Ceylon  (now  DFCC) \nand  National  Development  Bank  (NDB).  NDB  and  DFCC  Bank  were  originally  state-owned \ndevelopment finance institutions. They were privatized in the 1990s with the help of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  and  the  Government  retained  a  minority  stake  in  each  institution. \nBoth DFCC and NDB have evolved to become universal and cohesive financial services groups \nwith  the  right  to  compete  with  commercial  banks.  They  depend  primarily  on  funding  from \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n17\n\nfinance \n\nThere  are  six  regional  development \n\nbilateral and multilateral agencies to support their development lending activities. Both NDB and \nDFCC have been highly profitable, and have much lower overhead costs than the commercial \nbanks. DFCC, NDB, Commercial Bank, and Sampath Bank are primarily engaged in lending to \nthe  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprise  (SME)  sector.  In  keeping  with  the  needs  of  SMEs, \nDFCC  and  NDB  have  been  scaling  up  training  facilities  and  creating  specialized  branches  or \ndivisions geared to serving SMEs.   \n \n11. \ninstitutions\u2014Wayamba,  Kandurate, \nSabaragamuwa,  Ruhuma,  Rajaratna,  and  Uva.  These  are  mainly  conduits  for  government \nsubsidized credit programs, small business lending, and micro-lending. Collectively, they have \n194 branches and assets of SLRs13.5 billion or just below 5% of the assets of all LSBs. There \nare also three small private savings and development banks including Samasa, established by \nthrift and credit societies, and the Ceylinco Group. The regional development finance institutions \nhave  been  mainly  ineffectual  because  of  a  lack  of  basic  lending  and  other  skills.  The \nGovernment  is  considering  merging  the  six  regional  institutions  with  the  recently  established \nLanka  Putra  Bank  to  serve  the  SME  sector  better.  However,  it  remains  to  be  seen  whether \nLanka Putra Bank can fulfill its mandate. Experience from specialized SME banks in Sri Lanka \nand  elsewhere  points  to  their  difficulties  in  delivering  designed  outcomes.  As  such,  SME \nfinancing cannot be divorced from the mainstream financial institutions.  \n \nPerformance Indicators. The banking sector in Sri Lanka is sounder and more resilient \n12. \nas a result of reforms undertaken over the past two decades. The benefits of reforms are borne \nout by banking sector performance indicators\u2014the ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) to total \nloans  has  fallen,  the  capital  adequacy  ratio  has  increased,  and  profitability  has  risen.  The \naverage capital adequacy ratio of commercial banks increased from 8.6% in 2001 to 11.9% in \n2006. NPLs,1 as a percentage of total loans, declined from 15.3% in 2001 to 6% in 2006 in the \nbanking sector. The quality of banking supervision has improved since 2002, with all banks now \nbeing examined on-site at least once in a 2-year cycle. Together with increased depth in off-site \nanalysis, this has greatly improved the ability of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to identify \nweaknesses  in  banks.  However,  the  implementation  of  remedial  measures  still  lacks \ndecisiveness and effectiveness. Prudential standards have been strengthened.       \n \nSpecialized  Leasing  Companies.  Specialized  leasing  companies  (SLCs)  recorded \n13. \nimproved  performance  in  2006  in  terms  of  profitability,  capital,  asset  quality,  and  compliance \nwith prudential regulations. There were 20 SLCs at the end of 2006. Of these, seven companies \naccounted for 83% of the total assets of SLCs. The total assets of SLCs increased by 25% from \n2005 to 2006 to SLRs67 billion, while total finance leases increased by 11% to SLRs29 billion \nover the same period. \n \n14. \nAs SLCs are not permitted to accept deposits from the public, they are mainly dependent \non  bank  borrowings  or  funds  obtained  through  the  issue  of  debt  securities.  Therefore,  at  the \nrequest of SLCs, CBSL has recommended an amendment to the Finance Leasing Act No. 56, \n2000, to permit SLCs to mobilize funds through the issue of debt instruments. However, if SLCs \nare  permitted  to  mobilize  funds  from  the  public,  more  prudential  norms  are  required  to \nsafeguard the interests of investors in particular, and the stability of financial system in general.  \n \n15. \nThe industry average of gearing ratio (debt to capital) of SLCs was about 4:1 against the \npermitted maximum ratio of 10:1, indicating a sound financial position. SLCs mainly depend on \nborrowings from banks and borrowings made against asset-backed securities. \n\n                                                      \n1 This refers to gross NPLs ratio unless otherwise specified.  \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nIn 2006, CBSL issued eight directions to SLCs relating to minimum capital, provision for \n16. \nbad and doubtful accommodation, single borrower limit, gearing ratio, accrued interest, reserve \nfund, financial statements, and corporate and operational information. \n \nA  high  concentration  of  the  leasing  portfolio  of  SLCs  is  in  vehicle  financing,  which \n17. \naccounts for 81%. However, the risks associated with possible defaults are largely mitigated by \nthe nature of finance leases, where the vehicle is considered security and SLCs have absolute \nownership of such vehicles. This concentration is not considered a major risk to the industry, as \nvehicles financed are used for public transport, goods transport, and personal use by a diverse \nclientele. However, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is encouraging SLCs to diversify their leasing \nportfolios by providing facilities for purchase of capital equipment such as machinery. \n \nFacilities granted in respect of leasing showed a declining trend from 2003 to 2006, and \n18. \naccounted  for  64%  of  the  total  portfolio  of  all  SLCs  at  the  end  of  2006.  In  contrast,  facilities \ngranted  via  hire  purchase  by  SLCs  increased  and  amounted  to  19%  of  the  total  lease  facility \napprovals  of  SLCs  at  the  end  of  2006.  Tax  benefits  available  for  hire  purchase  largely \ncontributed  to  this  shift.  More  than  76%  of  the  hire  purchase  facilities  were  in  respect  of \nvehicles.  The  combined  share  of  both  leasing  and  hire  purchase  continued  to  increase,  and \naccounted for 83% of the total lease facility approvals of SLCs at the end of 2006. \n \nCredit Risk. The level of credit risk of the SLC sector depends largely on the quality of \n19. \nassets,  which  is  measured  by  the  volume  of  NPLs  and  the  NPL  ratio.  The  NPL  volumes \nreported  by  the  seven  largest  SLCs  have  shown  a  decreasing  trend  from  2003  to  2006.  The \nNPL  ratio  of  SLCs,  which  continued  to  decline,  reached  2.9%  by  30  June  2007.  The  share  of \nNPLs relating to leases continued to decline and reached 6.1% at the end of 2006.  \n \n20. \nOperational  and  other  Risks.  Sound  operating  systems,  internal  controls,  and  proper \nprocedures are critically important to ensure the financial soundness of an institution. CBSL is \nplanning to issue a code of corporate governance for voluntary compliance by SLCs. The SLCs \nare also required to report information on irregular lease facility approvals n a timely manner to \nthe Credit Information Bureau. \n \nFollowing  a  recommendation  in  the  2003  budget  speech,  SLCs  are  required  to  obtain \n21. \nratings for debt instruments they issue to the public that are not guaranteed by a rated financial \ninstitution and each of which exceeds SLRs100 million. This limit was subsequently increased to \nSLRs200 million. \n \n22. \nOverall  Performance  of  SLCs.  The  SLC  sector  recorded  satisfactory  performance \nduring  2006.  Net  profit  before  tax  for  2006  amounted  to  SLRs1.3  billion  and  recorded  44% \ngrowth, compared with the previous year. All SLCs, except one, operated profitably during 2006. \nThe overall profitability of SLCs was reflected in their return on assets (ROA) which increased \nfrom 3.3% in 2005 to 3.7% in 2006, and return on equity (ROE) which increased from 18.1% in \n2005 to 19.3% in 2006. \n \nReform  Challenges.  Recent  indicators  point  to  improved  bank  soundness  and \n23. \nperformance in Sri Lanka. However, the reform process remains incomplete. Some segments of \nthe  banking  sector  and  individual  banks  remain  vulnerable.  In  particular,  the  performance  of \nstate-owned banks has generally been weaker than that of private and foreign banks. Improving \nthe performance of state-owned banks should remain a high priority on the reform agenda. The \nkey  to  financial sector  development  in  Sri  Lanka  is  continuation  of  the  broad  thrust of  reforms \nthat began in the 1990s to strengthen the government infrastructure and institutional framework, \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n19\n\nwhile decreasing direct government intervention. Sustainable progress is dependent on further \nimprovements  in  the  legal  framework  for  financial  services  and  commercial  transactions  more \ngenerally, building infrastructure, and strengthening and enforcing prudential norms.   \n \nThe high cost of credit remains a significant policy concern. The spread between deposit \n24. \nand  lending  rates  has  widened.  However,  improved  margins  are  needed  by  weaker  banks  to \nearn  enough  to  cover  their  accumulated  loan  losses  and high  operating  expenses.  Until  weak \nbanks (both state-owned and private sector) are restructured or exit the market, competition will \nbe  limited;  margins  will  remain  high;  and  the  relatively  more  efficient  banks,  even  if \nuncompetitive by international standards, will be highly profitable.  \n \n25.  Major potential reform areas include the following: (i) completion of financial sector legal \nreforms, including a securitization bill and anti-money laundering statute; (ii) reform of the state-\nowned  financial  institutions,  addressing  not  only  asset  quality  and  capital  issues,  but \nmodernization  so  that  Sri  Lankans  will  be  able  to  take  full  advantage  of  electronic  payments, \nATMs,  and  credit  and  debit  cards;  (iii)  stringent  enforcement  of  prudential  standards  for  both \npublic  and  private  sector  banks  to  avoid  market  distortions,  higher  costs  for  consumers,  and \nextraordinary  profits  for  well-run  banks  arising  from  weak  banks\u2019  lack  of  competitiveness;  and \n(iv)  addressing  the  infrastructure  weakness  for  financial  services,  including  the  introduction  of \nmodern insolvency provisions through revision of the Companies Act (1982). \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nTHE LEASING SECTOR IN SRI LANKA \n\nBackground \n\nPortfolio Concentration \n\n \nA. \n \nFrom the late 1970s, finance companies in Sri Lanka offered some leasing within their \n1. \nrange of financial products. However, the major growth in finance leasing occurred following the \nformation of two specialized leasing companies (SLCs) sponsored by the International Finance \nCorporation\u2014Lanka Orient Leasing Company (LOLC) in 1980 and Mercantile Leasing in 1983. \nAt  the  end  of  1985,  these  companies  accounted  for  77%  of  lease  transactions.1  They  were \ngiven tax holidays for 5 years from their formation (footnote 1).  \n \n2. \nUntil 2001, leasing companies were largely unregulated and mainly specialist by nature. \nA new leasing act was introduced in 2001, permitting new leasing companies to be established \nas  long  as  they  met  a  minimum  capital  requirement  of  SLRs75  million  ($0.75  million).2  This \nprompted a number of leasing companies to enter the industry. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  Sri  Lankan  leasing  sector  has  played  an  important  role  in  the  development  of  the \ntransport  sector,  especially  in  rural  areas.  Passenger  and  commercial  vehicles  are  the  main \ncategory  of  assets  financed  by  leasing,  with  a  70%  share  of  the  total  portfolio  in  2004  (down \nfrom  77%  in  2003).  Over  75%  of  leasing  companies  in  Sri  Lanka  still  concentrate  on  vehicle \nleasing.  Only  a  few  have  diversified  into  other  products  such  as  financing  warehouses, \nhospitals,  educational  institutions,  and  office  equipment.  Over  50%  of  leases  were  utilized  to \npurchase secondhand vehicles.  \n \n4. \nThe Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) is calling for the leasing industry to diversify into \nother areas and to target small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing. The leasing of \nnon-vehicle equipment has been hampered by the absence of a clear legal process with regard \nto the repossession of equipment, and the short commercial life of so much modern equipment \n(unlike  vehicles,  which  have  a  ready  secondhand  value).  However,  it  is  typical  for  vehicles  to \ndominate  the  leasing  industry,  outside  a  small  number  of  developed  markets.  Factories  often \nhave less need for leasing in Sri Lanka, as they receive favorable credit lines from development \nfinance institutions. However, machinery required for the tea industry is a potential avenue for \ndevelopment.  \n \nC. \n \n5. \nMost of the recent entrants into the Sri Lankan leasing industry are subsidiaries of banks \nrather  than  specialist  leasing  companies.  There  is  some  resentment  among  specialist  leasing \ncompanies  to  these  banking  entrants,  which  are  considered  fair-weather.  Moreover,  as \nindependent  specialist  leasing  companies  are  dependent  on  banks  for  funding,  there  is  a \nconcern that loan requests may be rejected for competitive motives.  \n \nD. \n \n6. \nLitigation  to  recover  bad  debts  is  a  protracted  and  costly  process  in  Sri  Lanka.  An \narbitration procedure designed to improve this process is not as successful as had been hoped, \n\nLegal Recourse and Repossession Laws \n\nEntry of Banks \n\n                                                      \n1   ADB. 1986.

Manila. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n21\n\nRegulation and Tax Considerations \n\nwith  procedures  often  proving  even  more  unwieldy  and  expensive.3  Leasing  companies  are \nexcluded from Sri Lanka\u2019s Debt Recovery Act (1990), which enables other financial institutions \nto  repossess  and  sell  securities  without  court  intervention.  Weaknesses  in  the  guarantee  and \nrepossession  laws  hamper  growth  of  the  leasing  sector,  especially  outside  the  better \nunderstood urban automotive sector. \n \nE. \n \nCBSL issued seven directions in 2006 pertaining to minimum capital, provision for bad \n7. \nand  doubtful  lease  facilities,  single  borrower  limit,  gearing  ratio,  reserve  fund,  financial \nstatements,  and  corporate  and  operational  information.  Leasing  companies  also  have  moral \nobligations to follow best practices enunciated in the Sri Lanka Accounting/Auditing Standards \nAct No. 15, 1995, through a monitoring board.  \n \n8. \n \n\nThe following regulatory/legal documents govern the leasing industry in Sri Lanka: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\nInland revenue acts and other tax laws, including value-added tax (VAT).  \nRegulations  issued  by  the  registrar  of  motor  vehicles  relating  to  leasing  of \nvehicles. \nProcedures/arrangements  commonly  adopted  by  the  Leasing  Association  of  Sri \nLanka;  Credit  Information  Bureau  of  Sri  Lanka;  and  Financial  Ombudsman \nScheme under the purview of Consumer Affairs Authority Act No. 9, 2003. \nConsumer Credit Act No. 29, 1982, in respect of hire purchase activities. \nCredit  agency  functions  under  the  Mortgage  Act  No.  6,  1949,  and  the  Trust \nReceipt Ordinance No. 12, 1947. \n\n \n9. \nOver  recent  years,  there  have  been  a  number  of  significant  changes  in  the  fiscal \ntreatment of leasing. A VAT regime was introduced in 2002, with the leasing sector subject to \ninput  and  output  taxes.  The  input  and  output  taxes  have  been  aligned  at  15%.  It  has  been \nargued that these changes have had the effect of making leases less competitive.4 \n \n10. \nIn 2006, through the   Leasing Association of Sri Lanka, SLCs requested CBSL to permit \nthe mobilization of funds from the public via the issuance of debt instruments. CBSL agreed to \nthis  change  and  has  proposed  an  amendment  to  the  Finance  Leasing  Act  No.  56,  2000. \nHowever,  if  SLCs  are  permitted  to  mobilize  funds  from  the  public,  more  prudential  norms  are \nrequired to safeguard the interests of investors in particular, and the stability of financial system \nin general. It is expected that the proposed changes to the Finance Leasing Act will allow SLCs \nto raise deposits from the public to come into effect in 2008. \n \nF. \n \n11. \n \n\nThe primary features of the tax treatment for leasing transactions are presented below. \n\nTax Treatment of Leasing Transactions \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nLessor can claim capital allowances on the cost of the leased asset. \nLessee can claim rentals as allowable expenses. \nGenerally, rentals are subject to VAT unless specifically exempted. \nImport and supply of leased assets are subject to VAT but the lessor can claim \nVAT input credit with some restrictions. \n\n                                                      \n3  Paul, Lisa. 2007.

Sri Lanka. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n(v) \n\nLeasing  agreements  and  receipts  are  subject  to  stamp  duty,  debit  tax  on  the \nprocurement of leased assets, and income tax on profits. \nEconomic service charge is payable on the turnover. \n\n(vi) \n(vii)  Hire  purchase  interest  and  other  fee-based  incomes  are  liable  to  financial \n\nservices VAT on the value addition. \n\n(viii)  Financial service VAT on the value addition is at the rate of 20%. \n(ix) \n\nAsset  disposal  income,  down  payments,  and  all  other  receipts  are  subject  to \nVAT. \nLuxury motor vehicles and other luxury assets are subject to higher VAT rate of \n30%. \nCapital  allowance  on  plant  and  machinery  is  claimable  in  8  years,  which  is  a \ndeterrent to invest through leasing. \n\n(xi) \n\n(x) \n\n(xii)  Deferred  taxation  treatment  according  to  revised  accounting  standards  has \n\nimpacted leasing business. \n\nIssues and Concerns affecting the Leasing Sector \n\nThe  Sri  Lankan  leasing  industry  would  benefit  from  improvements  in  the  process  of \n\n \nG. \n \n12. \nThe  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  is  also  considering  changes  in  legislation  that  might \nhamper  the  industry:  (i)  reducing  depreciation  allowances  from  25.1%  to  12.5%;  and  (ii) \ncharging  leasing  companies  a  tax  of  the  higher  of  1%  of  turnover  or  SLRs50  million  ($0.5 \nmillion). The chair of LOLC argues that \u201cincreases in the VAT rate on leasing, special VAT rates \non  leasing  companies,  economic  service  charges,  and  changes  to  depreciation  rates  on \nvehicles and machinery are likely to make leasing an unattractive financing option to our core \ncustomer  base  of  small-  and  medium-sized  business  enterprises.  Furthermore,  these  fiscal \ndisincentives could effectively undermine the collective efforts of the leasing companies to serve \nthe small and medium entrepreneurs who are expected to make a substantial contribution to the \nnational economy\u201d (footnote 4) \n \n13. \nasset recovery, greater self-regulation, and the removal of VAT charges on leasing. \n \n14. \nVehicles  leased  in  the  Western  Province  and  other  areas  have  ended  up  in  the  North \nand  East  areas,  which  are  under  the  control  of  the  Tamil  Tigers.  Because  of  the  escalated \nconflict,  leasing  companies  are  unable  to  visit  these  parts  of  the  country  to  trace  leased \nvehicles. \n \nCommercial/development  banks,  motor  vehicle  agents/dealers,  consumer  goods \n15. \nimporters,  and  independent  entrepreneurs  formed  new  leasing/finance  companies\u2014adding \ncompetition  in  the  industry.  As  a  result,  the  margins  enjoyed  by  the  leasing  companies  are \nexpected to erode. \n \n16.  Machinery/equipment  items  have  a  very  poor  resale  value.  As  a  result,  lessors  face  a \nvery  high  credit  risk  in  the  event  of  a  default.  The  proceeds  of  resale  would  be  insufficient  to \ncover the amount the lessor is due. This results in the lessor seeking legal remedies to mitigate \nlosses.  The  lessor  has  to  face  severe  difficulties  to  exercise  its  repossession  rights.  To \novercome  this  issue,  a  suitable  exclusion  clause  needs  to  be  introduced  to  the  criminal \nprocedure code. \n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n23\n\nGlobal Ranking of the Leasing Industry in Sri Lanka \n\nUnder  the  current  regulatory  regime,  the  lessor  does  not  have  the  comfort  of  initiating \n17. \nthe  action  against  the  guarantors  in  the  same  action.  Thus,  an  amendment  needs  to  be \nintroduced in the Finance Leasing Act to accommodate guarantors as well. \n \nThe  principal  Finance  Leasing  Act  is  to  be  amended  to  safeguard  the  interest  of  the \n18. \nlessor  to  prevent  a  lessee  selling,  disposing,  or  mortgaging  the  machinery/equipment  item  to \nthird parties. \n \nThe  import  and  supply  of  agricultural  equipment/machinery  is  free  of  VAT.  However, \n19. \nlease  rentals  on  agricultural  machinery  are  liable  for  VAT.  As  such,  the  lessee  is very  often  a \nfarmer who is expected to pay an additional 15% as VAT on the lease rental. Such an additional \ncost would not be payable on an alternative form of financing, such as a loan. \n \nH. \n \nAccording  to  the  global  leasing  report,5  the  Sri  Lankan  leasing  industry  has  performed \n20. \nvery  satisfactorily  in  the  last  2  years.  It  was  the  42nd  largest  market  (previous  year  45th)  as \nmeasured by new volume of business disbursements. \n \nI. \n \n21. \nThe  Leasing  Association  of  Sri  Lanka  was  established  in  1980.  There  are  currently  53 \nmember companies, chaired by the CEO of PLC. The principal objectives are to promote, foster, \nprotect,  safeguard,  represent,  and  further  the  interests  of  the  leasing  industry;  and  to  regulate \nand ensure the proper conduct of business by its members. \n \n22. \nOne of the most significant achievements of the Leasing Association in the recent past \nhas  been  the  agreement  of  CBSL  to  amend  the  Finance  Leasing  Act,  enabling  registered \nleasing  companies  to  raise  funds  directly  from  the  public.  This  is  considered  a  major \nbreakthrough,  as  it  will reduce  the  reliance  of  leasing  companies  on  bank  funding and  reduce \nthe cost of raising capital by offering low-cost deposits to the public. \n \n\nRole of the Leasing Association of Sri Lanka \n\n                                                      \n5 Paul, Lisa. 2007.

The  Sri  Lanka  Leasing  Facility  seeks  to  enhance  small-  and  medium-sized \nenterprise (SME) development by addressing barriers to growth faced by SMEs. The main thrust of the \nProject  is  to  enhance  access  to  finance  of  SMEs  that  normally  do  not  have  easy  access  to  banking \nservices  and  products.  By  adopting  this  approach,  the  Project  will  facilitate  the  development  of  a \ncompetitive  SME  sector  that  is  capable  of  growth  and  expansion,  and  indirectly  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction. Furthermore, a dynamic SME sector will generate employment, contribute to the reduction of \ndirect  government  budget  support  to  SMEs,  and  free  up  resources  for  infrastructure  and  social \ndevelopment. All these factors will lead to reduced poverty.       \n \n2. \nand rural labor and will thus support income generation.  \n \nTo  facilitate  good  governance,  the  loan  to  People\u2019s  Leasing  Company  Limited  (PLC)  will  help \nstrengthen the company\u2019s corporate governance structures by requiring the establishment of an audit \nand compensation committee and the inclusion of two independent directors on the board of PLC (on a \nbest effort basis). This will contribute to the flow of improved services from the targeted lenders to the \nSMEs.  By  paying  particular  attention  to  the  development  of  rural  SMEs,  the  Project  will  improve  the \nincome  of  rural  households  and  increase  employment  opportunities  for  rural  residents,  including \nwomen,  by  establishing  new  SMEs  or  expanding  existing  SMEs\u2014thereby \nfostering  social \ndevelopment. \n \n \nC. \n\nDesign Features.
