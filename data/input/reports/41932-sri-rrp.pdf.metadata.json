The  activity  of  leasing  companies  in  Sri  Lanka  is \nconstrained  by  the  need  to  borrow  at  short  maturity  to  fund  a \nbusiness  that  lends  at  a  longer  maturity.  The  underdeveloped \nnature of the corporate debt market in Sri Lanka has made nonbank \nleasing  firms  heavily  dependent  on  commercial  banks  for  their \nfunding through short-term borrowings and commercial paper. This \nhas  resulted  in  maturity  mismatches  in  asset  and  liabilities  and \nhigher cost of funds for these institutions. \n \nThe proposed loans from ADB to the two companies will give them \naccess to long-term funds\u2014enabling them to promote alternative \nand more competitive financing instruments to SME entrepreneurs \nto  promote  their  operations  and  profitability  and  enhance  their \ncompetitiveness.  \n   \nUse of Proceeds  The  proposed  loans  will  be  used to  provide  leasing  facilities  to \nSMEs, especially to support business in rural areas in Sri Lanka. \n   \nSponsors and  (i)  PLC  was  established  in  August  1995  as  a  fully  owned \nShareholding  subsidiary of People\u2019s Bank, the second largest state-owned \nStructure  bank in Sri Lanka. PLC is incorporated as a private limited \nliability company. It has been the market leader in the leasing \nsector in Sri Lanka for the past 5 years. \n \n(ii)  CLC, Sri Lanka\u2019s third largest specialized leasing company, \nwas established in 1988. Initially, the principal shareholders \nwere Commercial Bank of Ceylon Limited and Singer (Sri \nLanka). In May 1989, Chemanex Limited was admitted as the \nthird principal shareholder. The company was converted to a ", "ii     \npublic company in June 1992 and is listed on the Colombo \nStock Exchange.  \n \nJustification  The companies\u2019 focus on SMEs will improve funding availability to \nsections of the Sri Lankan economy left underserved by commercial \nbanks.  \n  \nFrom a development perspective, a well-functioning leasing industry \nis an important financing tool for SMEs. The lack of assets that can \nbe used as collateral for bank loans particularly constrains SMEs. \nWhen credit is available from informal sources, it tends to be short-\nterm and too costly for investment financing. Leasing and supplier \ncredit are often the only source of credit available to SMEs. By \noffering leasing companies debt with maturity similar to the duration \nof leases, ADB will (i) improve the competitiveness of the leasing \nsector, and (ii) promote the development of SMEs in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s country strategy for Sri Lanka. \n \nBy strengthening the leasing sector, this project can also boost \ncapital  markets  development.  Once  leasing  companies  have \nestablished  an  operating  history,  they  can  tap  equity  and  debt \nmarkets.  As  a  follow-up  to  an  earlier  loan  provided  by  ADB  to \nanother  leasing  company  in  Sri  Lanka  (Lanka  Orix  Leasing \nCompany Limited [LOLC]), ADB is in discussions with LOLC to \nassist it in the securitization of part of its lease portfolio. \n \nIt is expected that about 400 SMEs will be assisted through lease \nfinancing, which would result in additional capital formation, value \nadded, employment and foreign exchange earnings/savings, and \npromotion of new entrepreneurs. This is fully in line with the focus of \nthe  Government  of  Sri  Lanka,  which  has  given  priority  to  the \ndevelopment of enterprises by new entrepreneurs and of the SME \nsector in general.  \n   \nLoan Terms  The proposed loans will be in US dollars. The maximum tenor of \nboth loans will not exceed 5 years. The interest rate will be the \nmarket rate for this type of borrower and instrument. The proposed \nloans will have the benefit of security over certain assets of the \nborrowers. \n   \nEnvironmental and  Both companies have been classified category FI with respect to \nSocial Safeguards  ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), and category C with respect to \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  Policy  on \nIndigenous  Peoples  (1998).  No  involuntary  resettlement  or  any \nimpact  on  indigenous  peoples  is  expected  from  the  activities \nfinanced by ADB\u2019s loans.  \n \n \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed \nloans of (i) up to $10 million to People\u2019s Leasing Company Limited (PLC), and (ii) up to $7.5 \nmillion to Commercial Leasing Company Limited (CLC).  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Economy  \n \n2.  Sri Lanka is a trade-oriented economy, partly because of its lack of natural resources. \nWholesale and retail trade (trade in exports, imports, and domestic goods and services) is the \nlargest single subsector, accounting for 21.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2005. The \ncombined services sector\u2014which includes transport, communications, financial services, and \ntourism\u2014generates more than 55% of GDP. Telecommunications, the most dynamic subsector, \nhas consistently recorded a double-digit annual growth rates since 1998.  \n \n3.  Manufacturing  accounts  for  60% of  total  industrial output.  The sector  also  includes \nmining, electricity, water, and construction. Privately owned export-oriented factories produce \nover  95%  of  manufacturing  output.  The  manufacturing  base  is  dominated  by  the  garment \nindustry, although the production of food and beverages, as well as chemical and rubber-based \ngoods, is also considerable. Although its significance has declined in the recent years, the \nagricultural sector remains important, directly accounting for around 17% of national output and \nemploying over one third of the workforce.  \n \n4.  Although privatization has reduced the role of the public sector in manufacturing, the \nstate continues to dominate the financial sector and utilities, and has a quasi-monopoly in \nhealthcare and education. It is also the largest property owner (90% of all land). The role of the \nGovernment of Sri Lanka (the Government) in the employment market is also substantial. Over \n1 million people are employed in the civil service and semigovernmental bodies, meaning that \nSri Lanka has one of the highest ratios of public employees to population in Asia. Expenditure \non civil servants and the huge political establishment accounts for around one third of the \nGovernment\u2019s recurrent expenditure, equivalent to almost 6% of GDP in 2005. \n \n5.  In late December 2004, a major tsunami claimed about 31,000 lives, left more than \n6,300 missing and 443,000 displaced, and destroyed an estimated $1.5 billion worth of property. \nGrowth, partly spurred by reconstruction, reached 5% in 2005 and more than 7% in 2006, the \nhighest recorded growth since 1978. The GDP growth rate was 6.4% for the second quarter of \n2007. \n \n6.  About 800,000 Sri Lankans work abroad (90% in the Middle East) and send more than \n$1 billion a year home\u2014the third highest foreign exchange earner for the country. \n \nB.  Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprise Sector  \n \n7.  Small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  account  for  a  large  share  of \nestablishments and employment in Sri Lanka: 80\u201390% of the total number of enterprises and \n75% of employment (including the agriculture sector). At the sector level, SMEs account for \n65% of total tea production, 50% of apparel and garment manufacturing, more than 70% of the \npublic bus transportation sector, 80% of domestic trade activities, 45% of tourism and recreation \nservices, and 50% of the local construction industry. Within the manufacturing sector, SMEs ", "2   \naccount for about 96% of industrial units, 36% of industrial employment, and 20% of value \nadded.  Enterprises  employing  5\u201329  workers  are  predominant  in  terms  of  the  numbers  of \nestablishments among SMEs. The typical unregistered firm employs family labor, supplemented \nby 2\u20133 hired workers. However, the industrial value-added figure is only 20% of the national \ntotal.  \n \n8.  Despite their potential importance, the performance of SMEs is not easy to measure in \nSri Lanka, as definitions of SMEs have varied considerably over time and between institutions. \nConventionally, employment numbers are used to classify SMEs. In Sri Lanka, enterprises are \ndivided into (i) small-scale enterprises with 5\u201349 employees, (ii) medium-scale enterprises with \n50\u2013149 employees, and (iii) large-scale enterprises with more than 150 employees. On this \nbasis, and in terms of the International Standard Industrial Classification of industries, SMEs are \nfound in all subsectors of the economy, with a concentration in the manufacturing sector.  \n \n9.  However, the definition adopted by various banks suggests the need for a more liberal \nenterprise fixed asset value, excluding land and buildings, of SLRs100 million (about $1 million) \nto capture the full extent of SMEs in Sri Lanka. \n \nC.  Problems Affecting the SME Sector  \n \n10.  More than 80% of the SMEs in Sri Lanka have difficulty accessing financial services and \nsecuring financing. This is mainly due to (i) a strong risk-adverse bias of banks with respect to \nSME lending; (ii) the absence of a diversified financial sector capable of serving SMEs, partly \ncaused by weaknesses in the judicial system as it applies to registering and enforcing security \ninterests;1 (iii) concentration of SME lending in Colombo, Gampaha, and Kalutara; and (iv) \nlimited availability of medium to long-term credit. \n \n11.  SME loan sizes are small. Relative to larger firms that borrow in larger amounts, banks \nincur  higher  administrative  and  processing  costs  on  their  SME  portfolios.  The  available \ninformation, track record, and reputation of a potential SME borrower is also likely to be limited, \nas is the financial accounting system\u2014adding further to the costs of loan processing and \nincreasing the uncertainty and, consequently, the credit risk. The probability of failure is high, \neven for well-conceived new ventures. Therefore, banks offer lending rates that are significantly \nhigher than for large enterprises. The higher lending rates limit SMEs\u2019 access to credit from the \nformal financial sector.  \n \n12.  To address the various constraints experienced by the SME sector and to create the \nenabling  environment,  the  Government  commissioned  a  task  force  in  2001  to  study  and \nrecommend actions to stimulate the SME sector (Appendix 1 contains an overview of the key \nrecommendations).  This  resulted  in  the  presentation  of  a  white  paper  in  20022  and  the \nestablishment of an SME Authority by an act of parliament in March 2006.  \n \n13.  The  Government\u2019s  development  agenda,  outlined  in  its  discussion  paper  \u201cMahinda \nChintana\u201d,3 provides a 10-year development framework (2006\u20132016). It embodies combining \nmarket-based economic policies, including foreign direct investments, with support for domestic \nenterprises. To achieve high growth rates, emphasis is on investments in infrastructure and the \nknowledge economy, with focus on regional development. A greater role for the private sector \n                                                      \n1 ADB. 2005. Sri Lanka Financial Sector Assessment. Manila. \n2 Available: http://www.ips.lk/publications/series/gov_reports/sme_white_paper/sme_white_paper.pdf  \n3 Available: http://www.treasury.gov.lk/EPPRM/npd/pdfdocs/budget2007/MahindaChintana  \nTenYearDevelopmentPlan.pdf  ", "  3\nunderlines the development agenda. To address regional inequalities, the Government has \ntaken  forward  its  commitment  for  facilitating  regional  public  infrastructure  development. \nResources have also been earmarked in the budget for promoting value addition in SME \nproduce through research and development. Import duty has also been removed on machinery \nand equipment for sectors such as tea, rubber, and coconut coir. \n \nD.  The Financial Sector in Sri Lanka \n \n14.  The past two decades witnessed significant financial reforms in Sri Lanka. Reforms \nThese comprised interest rate deregulation, restructuring of state-owned banks, allowing entry \nof  private  sector  financial  institutions,  easing  restrictions  on  foreign  financial  institutions, \nreducing directed lending, and a shift in the focus of banking sector supervision from micro-\nintervention towards prudential regulations. As of 30 June 2006, the Sri Lankan financial sector \nconsisted of (i) 23 licensed commercial banks (11 domestic private banks and 12 foreign \nbanks); (ii) 14 licensed specialized banks (6 regional development banks, 1 national savings \nbank, 2 state-sponsored long-term lending institutions, 2 housing finance institutions, and 3 \nprivate savings and development banks); (iii) 28 registered finance companies; (iv) 13 insurance \ncompanies; and (v) 2 public pension funds.  \n \n15.  The banking sector is the dominant subsector, accounting for about 57.5% of the total \nassets of Sri Lanka\u2019s financial system. Even though a large number of licensed banks exist in \nthe country, the stability of the financial system is primarily dependent on the performance and \nfinancial strength of the six largest licensed commercial banks, consisting of the two state-\nowned banks and the four large domestic private commercial banks.   \n \n16.  The two state-owned banks, People\u2019s Bank and Bank of Ceylon, play an important role \nin the domestic banking sector\u2014holding over 40% of commercial banking assets. Although the \nmarket shares of People\u2019s Bank and Bank of Ceylon have significantly dropped in the last 5 \nyears, while the share of private banks\u2019 total assets grew from 34.5% in 1998 to 43% by the end \nof 2005,4 the state banks have nationwide branch networks and have mandates to meet the \npolicy  objectives  of  providing  financial  services  throughout  the  country  and  targeting \ngovernment priority sectors rather than pursuing purely commercial objectives. However, they \nremain highly inefficient and undercapitalized.   \n \n17.  Nonetheless, with continued reforms being undertaken, the nonperforming loan (NPL) \nratios of the state-owned banks declined from 18% in 2003 to 8% in June 2006, and reached \nsimilar levels to those of domestic banks. Capital adequacy ratios have also improved to 8% of \nthe total assets, and steps have been taken to further enhance the regulatory and supervisory \nframework\u2014including plans to adopt the Basel II capital accord by 2008. \n \n18.  Commercial interests and competition for deposit and loan customers have led a number \nof the commercial banks to lend more aggressively to SMEs. Banks such as Sampath, Hatton \nNational Bank, and Commercial Bank of Ceylon are playing a lead role in this regard. Although \nencouraging, these resource mobilization activities will primarily fund activities that carry less \nrelative risks for banks, such as housing and car loans, and then be available for lending to \nSMEs.  Their  volume  is  also  limited,  given  the  relatively  high  short-term  interest  rates. \nAdditionally, high unit transaction costs in processing relatively small SME loans remains a \nproblem. Appendix 2 contains details and the structure of the financial sector in Sri Lanka. \n \n                                                      \n4 International Monetary Fund. 4 April 2006. Financial Sector Quarterly Update. Washington: IMF.  \n ", "4   \nE.  The Leasing Sector in Asia \n \n19.  In most developing countries, capital markets are relatively undeveloped and banks are \noften unable or unwilling to undertake term lending. Banks prefer to lend to larger, established \nbusinesses  with  well-developed  balance  sheets  and  credit  histories.  Operations  in \nmicroenterprises  and  small  businesses  are  cash  flow  oriented  but  rarely  have  organized \nhistorical financial records or the assets needed for collateral for conventional bank financing.5 \nAs such, in developing countries in general but in Asia in particular, there is an often unmet \nneed for lease financing from SMEs. \n \n20.  The leasing industry in Asia makes an important contribution to the region\u2019s economic \ndevelopment by providing a financing tool to both large enterprises and SMEs. In doing so, it \nincreases the level of private investment in capital equipment. The proposition that underlies the \nconcept of leasing is that an enterprise earns profit from the use of assets rather than ownership \nof  assets.  In  developing  countries  with  unclear  property  rights,  poorly  functioning  asset \nregistries, and weak laws of secured transaction, leasing can provide an attractive alternative to \nboth lessees without collateral and lessors wishing to improve the possibility of repossession if \nnecessary. \n \n21.  By supporting policy reforms and contributing private sector investment, ADB has played \na  critical  role  in  launching  the  leasing  industries  in  a  number  of  Asian  countries  such  as \nBangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Philippines. However, the leasing industries in \nmost of ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) remain underdeveloped. A recent study \ncommissioned by ADB6 on the leasing industry in 13 DMCs indicated that the total annual \nleasing volume in these countries is less than $7 billion compared to a global industry of over \n$500 billion, and accounts for an average penetration of 0.4% of GDP7 versus more than 1.0% \nin developed countries. \n \nF.  The Leasing Industry in Sri Lanka \n \n22.  Sri  Lanka  recorded  a  leasing  penetration  of  approximately  2.7%  of  GDP  in  2006, \naccording to the Leasing Association of Sri Lanka. This is significantly larger than that of any \nother DMC in the region, mainly because the leasing sector in Sri Lanka developed much earlier \nthan in other DMCs in the region, and local banks were very reluctant to extend credit to \nSMEs\u2014enabling leasing companies to fill the gap. \n \n23.  Sri Lanka\u2019s leasing industry is driven by 72 entities, which include 20 specialized leasing \ncompanies (SLCs), 28 finance companies, 15 commercial banks, and 9 licensed banks.8 The \nannual  total  disbursements  of  finance  leases  of  all  registered  leasing  firms  increased  to \nSLRs78.8 billion ($0.70 billion) as of 31 March 2007 from SLRs64 billion ($0.62 billion) in 2006.9 \nOf the 20 SLCs, 7 companies accounted for 83% of the total assets.10 The total assets of these \nSLCs increased by 25% to SLRs67 billion from the year earlier, while total finance leases \nincreased by 11% to SLRs29 billion. \n                                                      \n5  World  Bank.  2002.

The pinnacle years in the Sri Lankan leasing industry were 2005 and 2006, recording \n20% growth in the inception of new businesses. Leasing companies reported increases in \nprofitability from a low of 25% to 200% in 2006. Most of the new market entrants were bank \nsubsidiaries rather than specialist leasing companies, creating fear among existing companies \nthat the newcomers were largely aggressive, opportunistic, and ready to dominate the market\u2014\nbut unlikely to stay if there was a market downturn. The market became divided between formal \nleasing companies and informal companies that use leasing and hire purchase11 to disguise \ntheir intent to diversify their ability to lend. \n \n25.  A high concentration of the leasing portfolio of SLCs is in vehicle financing (81%). \nHowever, the risks associated with possible defaults are largely mitigated by the nature of \nfinance leases, where the vehicle is considered the security and SLCs have absolute ownership \nof such vehicles. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) does not consider this concentration a \nmajor risk to the industry, as vehicles financed are used for purposes such as public transport, \ngoods transport, and personal use by clients. However, CBSL is encouraging SLCs to diversify \ntheir leasing portfolios by providing facilities for the purchase of capital equipment such as \nmachinery. \n \n26.  The NPL volumes reported by the seven largest SLCs have shown a decreasing trend \nrecently.12 The NPL ratio of SLCs reached 2.9% (30 June 2006). The share of NPLs relating to \nleases continued to decline and reached 6.1% as of 30 June 2006. Appendix 3 contains further \ninformation on the leasing sector in Sri Lanka. \n \nG.  ADB\u2019s Sector and Country Strategy and Assistance to the Leasing Sector \n \n1.  Sector Strategy \n \n27.  ADB has been actively promoting the leasing industry in Asia. It has provided a number \nof technical assistance (TA) projects to support the emergence of leasing, which has proved its \neffectiveness\u2014particularly in countries where the banking sector was not able to offer loans with \nadequate tenor to secure the acquisition of capital goods.  \n \n28.  In June 2005, ADB commissioned an internal research paper on the leasing industry in \nits DMCs. The paper identified the following opportunities for ADB interventions: (i) the non-\nautomobile equipment segment remains underfunded, (ii) sustainable local currency medium-\nterm funding is insufficient, (iii) increased focus is needed on SMEs and rural enterprises, and \n(iv) successful development of leasing sectors should be replicated in new geographical areas. \nADB developed this initiative to increase SMEs\u2019 access to finance, and support rapid growth of \nthe leasing sector in Sri Lanka. \n \n2.  Country Strategy  \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s  country  and  strategy  program  2004\u20132008  for  Sri  Lanka13  acknowledges  the \nimportance of private sector development as a key way of accelerating GDP growth, creating \njobs, and raising efficiency and productivity in all sectors.  \n                                                      \n11 Hire purchase is a means of obtaining the use of an asset before payment is completed.

In this \nrespect, ADB\u2019s strategy is two-pronged:  \n \n(i)  Promote an enabling environment for private sector development using ADB\u2019s \npublic sector window.  \n(ii)  Directly invest in private sector companies using loans and equity.  \n \n31.  The country strategy and program update 2006\u2013200814 also emphasized the need for \nADB to promote SME development and microfinance.  \n \n32.  The proposed loans would also align with ADB\u2019s current poverty reduction strategy,15 \nwhich states that ADB seeks to promote \u201csound and efficient banking systems and capital \nmarkets,\u201d  since  these  are  seen  as  \u201cindispensable  for  macroeconomic  stability,  mobilizing \nsavings, and ensuring availability of long-term financing, an essential requirement for pro-poor \ngrowth.\u201d  \n \nH.  ADB\u2019s Private Sector Development Strategy \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  development  strategy16  specifically  refers  to  ADB\u2019s  role  in \nstrengthening  DMC  capital  markets,  including  the  leasing  sector,  and  notes  the  critical \nimportance of well-functioning financial systems for the private sector. Many DMCs need to \nstrengthen their financial institutions and create diversified financial markets that can finance \nprivate sector-led growth. ADB has supported financial sector reform programs through public \nsector operations and/or direct investments in financial intermediaries in several DMCs (footnote \n8). \n \n34.  The  strategy  notes  that  ADB  will  complement  funding  with  capacity  building  and \ngovernance strengthening for financial institutions. It will support policy reform to enhance \nregulation  and  supervision,  develop  sound  financial  systems,  and  deepen  and  broaden \nsecurities markets (footnote 8). The proposed loans are consistent with this strategy.  \n \nI.  ADB\u2019s Financial Sector and SME Strategy for Sri Lanka \n \n35.  ADB\u2019s approach to facilitating financial sector development in the short to medium term \nis to (i) promote good governance over the financial markets by improving the understanding of \nkey governance principles and best practices, building capacity for good governance, and \ninstitutionalization  of  good  governance  principles  through  organizational  restructuring;  (ii) \nmobilize financial resources from commercial sources, and when necessary, with the support of \nADB\u2019s guarantee facility, for relending to private sector companies through domestic financial \ninstitutions; and (iii) develop a network of specialized financial institutions (e.g., cooperatives, \nnongovernment organizations, and credit funds) and mainstream suitable credit facilities among \nexisting  financial  intermediaries  to  target  the  weaker  economic  sectors  (including \nmicroenterprises, small- and medium-scale industries, retail low cost housing, and rural areas). \n \n                                                      \n14 ADB. 2005.

ADB  has  provided  sustained  support  for  SME  sector\u2014through  broader  financial \nmarkets and fiscal improvement programs as well as SME-focused interventions.17 Long-term \nstructural issues, such as development of the capital market and availability of alternative \nfinancial sources of medium to long-term funds to the private sector, are being addressed \nthrough the above mentioned ADB SME projects. Continuing ADB support in this area has \nincluded development of contractual savings institutions, alternative sources of medium to long-\nterm  funds,  the  insurance  industry  and  pension  and  provident  funds,  and  liberalization  of \ninvestments of these institutions to include private securities in the capital market. \n \n37.  The  following  initiatives  are  expected  to  deepen  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  the \nfinancial markets as well as enhance corporate governance: (i) developing securitized debt and \nequities  markets  under  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Development  Program  (1990);18  (ii) \nstrengthening  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission;  and  (iii)  the  introduction  of  a \nsecuritization bill and amendment of the Securities and Exchange Commission Act (1991) under \nthe  ongoing  Financial  Markets  Program  for  Private  Sector  Development  Program.19  The \nongoing  Fiscal  Management  Reform  Program20  is  also  helping  to  create  an  enabling \nenvironment  to  foster  mobilization  of  tax  revenues,  improve  the  effectiveness  of  public \nexpenditures,  accelerate  fiscal  decentralization,  and  improve  coordination  to  place  public \nfinances on a sustainable path. These structural measures are long-term initiatives whose \nimpact will only gradually take hold after consistent implementation. ADB is also providing \nextensive support for infrastructure development that will enhance the competitiveness of SMEs \nand provide the basis for a higher GDP growth rate. \n \n38.  In addition to policies introduced by the SME policy unit at the National Enterprise \nDevelopment Authority, the ADB-financed SME Sector Development Program21 established \npolices to reduce the cost of operating and financing SMEs\u2014including reduction of corporate \nincome tax for SMEs, abolition of turnover tax on banking and financing activities, harmonization \nof tax incentives, and the abolition of stamp duty on letters of credit.

An integrated approach for enhancing SMEs\u2019 access to \nfinance and business development services has also been initiated. \n \nIII.  THE BORROWERS \n \nA.  People\u2019s Leasing Company Limited  \n \n39.  PLC  is  a  specialized  leasing  company,  incorporated  on  22  August  1995,  with \nheadquarters in Colombo. It commenced operations on 31 May 1996 and is a fully owned \nsubsidiary of People\u2019s Bank, which is the second largest bank in the country and owned by the \nGovernment. PLC was initially established to carry out finance leasing for customers of People\u2019s \nBank. To date, it has a network of 18 branches across Sri Lanka and has access to the branch \nnetwork of People\u2019s Bank, which is the largest in the country. \n \n40.  In 1996, PLC became a participative credit institution for a concessionary line of credit \nbacked by the Government of India and given to the Government of Sri Lanka, through People\u2019s \nBank. By using this line of credit, long-term credit is extended to purchase capital goods of \nIndian origin. Having access to this funding mechanism has been instrumental for PLC to \nbecome  a  dominant  player  in  financing  public  transport  vehicles.  Unlike  other  leasing \ncompanies, PLC has targeted the passenger bus transportation sector in Sri Lanka, which has \nbeen plagued by underinvestment for several years.  \n \n41.  PLC was one of the first SLCs to be selected as a participating finance institution for the \nADB-funded  Tea  Development  Project,22  which  started  in  1999  and  was  completed  in \nDecember 2005. The project was designed to assist the Government in (i) increasing the \nincome  of  tea  smallholders  within  a  sustainable  system,  and  (ii)  improvement  of  the \nenvironment.  The  project  focused  on  institutional  reforms  to  increase  the  efficiency  and \neffectiveness of tea-related institutions, and to direct more funds for replanting. It provided credit \nfinancing channeled through participating financial institutions for (i) replanting, (ii) rehabilitation \nand modernization of tea factories, (iii) commercial production of high quality planting materials, \nand (iv) facilities for collection and transportation of green leaf. The project also strengthened \ntea smallholder development societies and producer associations, improved workers\u2019 housing \nand sanitary facilities, provided rural feeder roads, and produced afforestation. \n \n42.  More  recently,  PLC  became  a  participating  finance  institution  for  ADB\u2019s  Plantation \nDevelopment Project,23 which aims to develop the plantation sector of Sri Lanka. Under this \ncredit scheme, regional plantation companies and their subsidiaries and sub-lessees are eligible \nto borrow loans. The project commenced in 2003 and will end in 2009. \n \n43.  In November 2005, PLC established the Islamic Finance Services Unit\u2014functioning \nunder Shariah Law\u2014with the objective of venturing into the untapped market for Islamic finance \nin Sri Lanka. This is the first such unit to be set up by any leasing company in Sri Lanka. The \nkey difference between Islamic and conventional finance is the role of interest. Interest is \n                                                      \n22 ADB. 1998.

Since its establishment less than 2 years ago, the unit has seen \ndramatic growth with a current receivables portfolio of SLRs558 million.  \n \n44.  PLC is also a participating finance institution in the \u201ce-Friends 2\u201d fund, sponsored by the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation, which aims to provide low-cost funding and TA to \nfirms engaged in waste management, resource recovery, and pollution control.  \n \n45.  Finally, PLC is one of the participating finance institutions of a credit line sponsored by \nthe French Development Agency (AFD) under the Construction Sector Development Project to \nassist construction and public work related to post-tsunami reconstruction. The credit facility \nagreement was recently signed between the Government and AFD to borrow \u20ac10 million. The \nproject has the following components: (i) Construction Sector Development Project (\u20ac9 million), \nand (ii) the creation of an advanced construction training academy (\u20ac1 million). \n \nB.  Commercial Leasing Company Limited  \n \n46.  CLC, Sri Lanka\u2019s third largest specialized leasing company, was established in 1988. \nInitially,  the  principal  shareholders  were  Commercial  Bank  of  Ceylon  Limited  and  Singer \n(Sri Lanka). In May 1989, Chemanex Limited was admitted as the third principal shareholder. \nThe company was converted to a public company in June 1992 and CLC is listed on Colombo \nStock Exchange. The current shareholder structure is shown in Table 3. \n \nTable 3: Current Shareholder Structure\n \nShareholders   Current Ownership \n(%) \nChemanex Limited   36.7 \nSinger Sri Lanka Limited  30.0 \nCommercial Bank of Ceylon Limited  30.0 \nMinority shareholders   3.3 \n        Total  100.0 \nSource: Commercial Leasing Company Limited \n \n \nIV.  PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Project Selection \n \n47.  An ADB fact finding mission visited Sri Lanka in May 2007 to discuss the features of \nADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations  with  government  authorities  and  state-owned  enterprises \n(SOEs). Facilitated by the Strategic Enterprise Management Authority, the mission made a \npresentation on ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations to about 20 SOEs, including People\u2019s Bank and \nPLC. Meetings were also held between ADB and PLC as a follow-up to the presentation. \n \n48.  The loan to CLC was discussed in detail with the company during an ADB mission to Sri \nLanka in June 2007. The mission met with CLC, which conveyed interest in obtaining financial \nassistance from ADB. ADB\u2019s initial contact with CLC was arranged by the Maldives Finance \nLeasing Company, which had received financing from ADB via the South Asian SME Leasing \nFacility approved in March 2007 (footnote 14). \n \n \n \n ", "10  \nB.  Proposed Loans \n \n49.  ADB assistance to both leasing companies will be in the form of secured loans in US \ndollars. The tenor of both loans will be 5 years and principal repayments will be amortizing. The \nproceeds of the loans to both companies will specifically fund SME clients of their leasing \nbusiness.  The  loans  will  be  secured  by  a  charge  on  a  portfolio  of  already  existing  lease \nreceivables of each individual company \n \n50.  Since both loans from ADB will be denominated in US dollars, ADB has discussed in \ndetail how the companies intend to hedge themselves against possible currency risks. Both \ncompanies will retain the funds borrowed from ADB and place them in a foreign currency \ndeposit with a local bank without converting them to local currency and then borrow Sri Lanka \nrupees against this deposit. They have followed the same funding strategy with all their other \noutstanding foreign currency loan commitments.  \n \n51.  The proposed loans will be sourced from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and will carry \nan interest rate based on the London interbank offered rate plus a margin determined by ADB\u2019s \nPricing and Credit Enhancement Committee. The committee will also determine the amount of \nupfront and commitment fees.  \n \nC.  Pricing \n \n52.  Pricing will be determined by the Credit Enhancement and Pricing Committee of ADB.  \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND RISKS \n \nA.  Justification for ADB Participation \n \n1.  Primary Objective \n \na.  Strengthen the Leasing Industry \n \n53.  The  proposed  ADB  assistance  is  expected  to  strengthen  the  leasing  industry,  and \nexpand the funding resources and financial services available to the SME sector in Sri Lanka. \nThe activity of leasing companies in Sri Lanka is constrained by the need to borrow at short \nmaturity to fund a business that lends at a longer maturity. The underdeveloped nature of \ncorporate debt market has made nonbank leasing firms heavily dependent on commercial \nbanks for their funding through short-term borrowings and commercial paper. This has resulted \nin maturity mismatches in asset and liabilities, and higher cost of funds for these institutions. \n \nb.  Promote SME Growth \n \n54.  The proposed loans from ADB to the two companies will provide them access to long-\nterm funds, and enable them to promote alternative financing instruments to SME entrepreneurs \nto promote their operations and profitability and enhance their competitiveness. \n \n55.  The Project is in line with ADB\u2019s country strategy for Sri Lanka. It will promote private \nsector participation in SME development. The demonstration effects related to long-term funding \nwill be positive. \n ", "  11\n56.  The Project also complements ADB\u2019s public sector approach, as exemplified by ADB\u2019s \nrecent financial markets loan (footnote 21). This program is intended to facilitate participation of \nthe private sector, including SMEs, in the Sri Lankan economy by supporting government \nreforms to eliminate impediments to and develop opportunities for their involvement.  \n \nc.  Improve Broader Capital Markets Development \n \n57.  Leasing  companies  can  also  boost  capital  markets  development.  Once  they  have \nestablished an operating history, they can tap and foster equity markets. Their demand for term \ndebt  broadens  the  term  lending  options  for  banks,  finance  houses,  pension  funds,  and \ninsurance companies. They can also issue bonds or other marketable instruments. Finally, \nleasing companies can securitize their lease receivables, taking some assets off the balance \nsheet to achieve higher leverage and better returns and adding another tradable instrument to \nlocal capital markets. ADB is currently in discussions with LOLC, which received an earlier loan \nfrom ADB,24 regarding possible securitization of part of their lease portfolio whereby ADB would \nprovide a guarantee to guarantee the issue and/or purchase the mezzanine tranche of such a \nstructured transaction. This would represent one of the first true sale securitization deals in the \ncapital markets of Sri Lanka. \n \nd.  Rationale for Adopting Subsovereign Modality in the Case of PLC \n \n58.  The  proposed  nonsovereign  loan  to  a  government-owned  entity  such  as  PLC  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s policy to provide financial assistance to public sector enterprises without \ngovernment guarantees, provided that they satisfy the criteria of autonomy and managerial \nfreedom in operating the enterprise concerned. As outlined in ADB\u2019s Innovation and Efficiency \nInitiative,25 numerous SOEs are creditworthy and have the long-term financial viability to borrow \nwithout government guarantees. They constitute a \u201cthird generation\u201d of potential ADB clients, \nincreasingly  important  as  borrowers  separate  from  the  sovereign.  These  entities  play  an \nimportant role in creating employment and providing basic public services. Giving them access \nto affordable long-term credit is critical to promoting economic growth. PLC has been the market \nleader in the leasing industry in Sri Lanka for the past 5 years and has been competing with \nmore  than  70  private  sector  owned  entities.  It  has  experienced  management,  which  has \nconsistently shown strong financial performance, and has built up sizeable experience and \nexposure in SME financing. It clearly fits the requirements of ADB\u2019s Innovation and Efficiency \nInitiative to provide nonsovereign financing to SOEs with a strong balance sheet, track record, \nand private sector focus. \n \n2.  Development Impact \n \n59.  Assuming an average lease size of $50,000, it is expected that about 400 SMEs will be \nassisted through lease financing, which would result in additional capital formation, value added, \nemployment, and foreign exchange earnings/savings and promotion of new entrepreneurs. This \nis fully in line with the focus of the Government, which has given priority to the development of \nenterprises by new entrepreneurs and of the SME sector in general.  \n \n60.  Moreover, a robust leasing industry has the potential to contribute to the development of \ncapital markets by introducing SMEs to formal financial markets and providing demand from \nleasing companies for capital markets funding. \n                                                      \n24 ADB. 2007.

ADB has prepared a development impact framework (Appendix 10) to measure the \nexpected development impact of its intervention. The development impact will be measured in \nthree distinct categories: (i) private sector development, (ii) business performance, and (iii) \neconomic sustainability. \n \nB.  Environment and Social Safeguards \n \n62.  Environment. This financing is classified category FI. All borrowers will be required to \nadopt appropriate environmental management systems in accordance with the guidelines in \nAppendix 11.  \n \n63.  Social Safeguards. This financing is classified category C. No involuntary resettlement \nor any impact on indigenous peoples is expected as a result of this financing. All sub-borrowers \nare extremely small and serve individuals and SMEs. Their clients are in the private sector and \ndo not have the power to trigger involuntary resettlement. A summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \nC.  Anticorruption  Policy:  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n \n64.  The borrowers have been advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) and policies relating to the combating of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire PLC and CLC to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls \nfollowing international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The documentation between ADB and each company will further \nallow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \nD.  Records, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n65.  The  borrowers  will  (i)  maintain  accounting,  management  information,  and  financial \ncontrol  systems  acceptable  to  ADB;  (ii)  maintain  independent  auditors  from  auditing  firms \nlicensed to operate in Sri Lanka and acceptable to ADB and will authorize such auditors to \nsubmit financial statements to ADB at least annually; and (iii) permit ADB representatives \naccess to all sites where its activities are conducted as well as to its books, accounts, and \nrecords, and will permit ADB (if and when it deems necessary) to engage auditors at their own \nexpense to audit the accounts and accounting systems of each company. The deadline for the \nsubmission of audited accounts will be 120 days from the end of each year; and narrative and \nunaudited  financial  information,  including  a  balance  sheet  and  income  statement  of  the \ncompanies, must be submitted within 40 days from the end of the relevant quarter. \n \nVI.  EXPOSURE LIMITS \n \n66.  If approved, these loans will be ADB\u2019s seventh and eighth nonsovereign investment in \nSri Lanka. They will represent 1% of ADB\u2019s total nonsovereign portfolio and will increase ADB\u2019s \nexpected exposure to the nonbank financial institutions and specialized banks from 6.1% to \n6.4%, and its aggregate expected exposure to Sri Lanka from 1.1% to 1.6%. The proposed \nloans are within approved exposure limits.  ", "  13\nVII.  ASSURANCES \n \n67.  Consistent with the provisions of the Charter, ADB will obtain confirmation from the \nGovernment that it has no objection to ADB financing prior to any funding being made available. \n \n68.  ADB will enter into suitable loan and security documentation and other required legal \ndocuments, following approval of the proposed financing by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors. These \nagreements will be on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n69.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve loans of (i) up to \n$10,000,000  to  People\u2019s  Leasing  Company  Limited  (PLC),  and  (ii)  up  to  $7,500,000  to \nCommercial Leasing Company Limited (CLC), from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, on such \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, or as \nmay be subsequently reported to the Board. \n \n \n \n  Liqun Jin \n31 October 2007  Vice President \n \n \n ", "14  Appendix 1 \nNATIONAL STRATEGY FOR SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISE \nSECTOR DEVELOPMENT IN SRI LANKA \n \nKey Recommendations \n \n(i)  The Government should adopt the vision for the small- and medium-sized enterprise \n(SME) sector as set out in the white paper to provide policy direction for the future \noverall strategy and plans for implementation. \n(ii)  Use the definition recommended by the task force as a standard for data collection, \npolicy analysis, and implementation of SME sector development programs. \n(iii)  Establish a high-powered SME policy unit at the Ministry of Enterprise Development, \nIndustrial Policy, and Investment Promotion. \n(iv)  Establish an SME authority, a full-fledged autonomous institution for SME development. \n(v)  Facilitate ongoing restructuring activities of the Investment Development Board with \nnecessary funding and administrative support. \n(vi)  Improve and consolidate financial assistance available for SMEs. \n(vii)  Implement low-cost credit negotiation and project monitoring activities initiated by the \nInvestment Development Board. \n(viii)  Encourage the active participation of venture capital companies and leasing companies \nto provide credit support for SMEs. \n(ix)  Disburse loan and allied facilities with the assistance of business development services \n(BDS) providers. \n(x)  Amend  the  Loan  Recoveries  Act  (1990)  and  provide  opportunities  for  distressed \ncompanies to be restructured. \n(xi)  Install financial discipline in SMEs. \n(xii)  Establish technical service centers at district level. \n(xiii)  Establish a technology development fund. \n(xiv)  Introduce a voucher scheme for SMEs to engage in research and development work. \n(xv)  Create an SME website. \n(xvi)  Initiate low-cost advertising and sales promotion programs for SMEs. \n(xvii)  Commission an annual survey and a magazine on SMEs. \n(xviii)  Maintain a comprehensive and up-to-date BDS database. \n(xix)  Introduce a voucher scheme for SMEs to use BDSs. \n(xx)  Introduce a simplified tax system for SMEs. \n(xxi)  Obtain World Trade Organization concessions for SME development. \n(xxii)  Organize productivity enhancement programs for SMEs. \n(xxiii)  Create industrial parks for SMEs in rural areas. \n(xxiv)  Form industry clusters on a subsector basis. \n(xxv)  Promote  subcontracting  with  proper  targeting  to  improve  SMEs\u2019  technological \ncapabilities. \n(xxvi)  Launch an awareness program on cleaner production targeted at SMEs, focusing on \ncost savings and efficiency benefits of cleaner production. \n(xxvii)  Enhance the capability of government and private BDSs to assist SMEs in cleaner \nproduction and environmental management. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 2  15\nDETAILS AND STRUCTURE OF THE SRI LANKAN FINANCIAL SECTOR \n \n1.  The financial sector in Sri Lanka includes most of the institutional elements of a modern \nfinancial system, reflecting a broad range of reforms introduced since the early 1990s. The \nbanking sector dominates in terms of assets but a range of other institutions offers financial \nservices. At the end of June 2006, the Sri Lankan financial sector consisted of (i) 23 licensed \ncommercial banks (LCBs), of which 11 are domestic private banks and 12 are foreign banks; (ii) \n14 licensed specialized banks (LSBs), of which 6 are regional development banks, 1 national \nsavings bank, 2 state-sponsored long-term lending institutions, 2 housing finance institutions, \nand 3 private savings and development banks; (iii) 28 registered finance companies; (iv) 13 \ninsurance companies; and (v) 2 public pension funds.   \n \n2.  From June 2005 to June 2006, total assets of the financial institutions increased by 18%, \nreaching SLRs3,706 billion which is 1.3 times the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). \nLCBs  and  LSBs,  which  accounted  for  57.4%  of  the  total  assets  of  the  financial  system, \ncontinued to hold a dominant position in the financial sector. LCBs contributed 58.6% of the \nasset growth of the financial system (Table A2). \n \nTable A2.1: Total Assets and Deposit Liabilities of the \nMain Institutions in the Financial System \nJune 2006a \nFinancial   Assets  Deposit Liabilities \nInstitution  SLRs   %  SLRs  % Share \nbillion  Share  billion \nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka  473.9  13.7     \nInstitutions Regulated by the Central Bank  2,644.4  76.4  1,355.5  97.9 \n     Deposit Taking Institutions  2,073.2  59.9  1,355.5  97.9 \n          Licensed Commercial Banks  1,647.0  48.0  1,068.0  77.0 \n          Licensed Specialized Banks  329.9  9.5  237.8  17.2 \n          Registered Finance Companies  97.1  2.8  52.8  3.7 \n     Other Institutions  571.2  16.5  \u2014  \u2014 \n          Employees\u2019 Provident Fundb  456.0  13.2  \u2014  \u2014 \n          Primary Dealers  46.7  1.3  \u2014  \u2014 \n          Specialized Leasing Companies  68.5  2.0  \u2014  \u2014 \nInstitutions not Regulated by the Central Bank  343.7  9.9  29.0  2.1 \n     Deposit Taking Institutions  32.0  0.9  29.0  2.1 \n          Rural Banks  26.8  0.8  24.2  1.7 \n          Thrift and Credit Cooperative Societies  5.2  0.2  4.8  0.3 \n     Contractual Savings Institutions  280.2  8.1  \u2014  \u2014 \n          Employees\u2019 Trust Fund  62.5  1.8  \u2014  \u2014 \n          Private Provident Funds  107.5  3.1  \u2014  \u2014 \n          Insurance Companies  110.2  3.2  \u2014  \u2014 \n     Other Specialized Financial Institutions  31.5  0.9  \u2014  \u2014 \n          Merchant Banks  25.3  0.7  \u2014  \u2014 \n          Venture Capital Companies  1.5  0.0  \u2014  \u2014 \n          Unit Trusts  4.7  0.1  \u2014  \u2014 \n     Total  3,462.0  100.0  1,384.5  100.0 \na  Provisional.         \nb Administered by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. \nSource: Central Bank of Sri Lanka \n \n \n \n ", "16  Appendix 2 \n3.  Licensed  Commercial  Banks.  The  banking  sector  continued  to  be  the  dominant \nsubsector,  accounting  for  about  57.5%  of  the  total  assets  of  the  financial  system.  LCBs \naccounted for the majority share, at 48% of the entire financial system\u2019s assets and 77% of total \nbanking sector assets (Table A2). \n \n4.  LCBs  have  broad  business  powers,  and  generally  have  subsidiaries  and  affiliates \nengaged in all areas of the financial services market. The three state-owned institutions\u2014\nPeople\u2019s Bank, Bank of Ceylon, and National Savings Bank\u2014have the largest branch networks \nand number of deposit accounts. These institutions play an important role in the domestic \nbanking sector, given their mandates to meet the policy objectives of providing financial services \nthroughout the country and to target government priority sectors.  \n \n5.  Major private commercial banks have widened their networks to cover almost the entire \ncountry, with four leading private commercial banks\u2014Hatton National Bank, Commercial Bank \nof Ceylon, Seylon Bank, and Sampath Bank\u2014accounting for 85% of the assets, 90% of the \ndeposits, and 85% of the loans granted. While there are 11 foreign banks in Sri Lanka, only \nHong  Kong  and  Shanghai  Banking  Corporation  (HSBC)  with  10  branches  and  Standard \nChartered with 9 branches, compete in the retail market. Collectively, these foreign-owned \nbanks account for about 18% of commercial bank assets but only about 9% of loans\u2014reflecting \ntheir much higher liquidity. However, these indicators understate the importance of foreign \nbanks, as they carry out the majority of trade finance activities in the country. Many medium to \nlarge businesses in Sri Lanka have a relationship with at least one of the foreign-owned banks, \nmainly because of the need for letters of credit from banks with an international reputation.  \n \n6.  The  performance  of  LCBs  improved  further  in  2006  in  terms  of  growth  of  assets, \nexpansion in delivery channels, improvements in risk management, risk absorption capacity, \nand use of information technology. The growth of total assets of domestic private banks and \nstate-owned banks was 45.3% and 30.6%. Assets of foreign-owned banks grew at a rate of \n24.2%. \n \n7.  Total assets grew by 31% in 2006, mainly attributed to the overall increase in loans and \nadvances fuelled by expansion of credit by state banks and domestic private LCBs. State-\nowned LCBs recorded the highest growth in loans and advances of 44%, followed by foreign \nLCBs with growth of 25%. \n \n8.  Licensed Specialized Banks. The 14 LSBs, which all compete with commercial banks \nin some products, were established to provide specific services\u2014often to address perceived \nmarket failures. Lending by LSBs was concentrated in housing, industrial, and financial sectors. \n \n9.  National Savings Bank is by far the largest LSB. It is the second largest deposit-taking \ninstitution in Sri Lanka, behind Bank of Ceylon. National Savings Bank operates largely as a \ndeposit-taking institution, providing savings accounts through its 112 branches and investing \nabout 80% of total assets in government debt.    \n \n10.  LSBs  also  include  development  financing  companies.  Sri  Lanka  has  two  primary \ndevelopment finance companies\u2014Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (now DFCC) \nand National Development Bank (NDB). NDB and DFCC Bank were originally state-owned \ndevelopment finance institutions. They were privatized in the 1990s with the help of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), and the Government retained a minority stake in each institution. \nBoth DFCC and NDB have evolved to become universal and cohesive financial services groups \nwith  the  right  to  compete  with  commercial  banks.  They  depend  primarily  on  funding  from ", "Appendix 2  17\nbilateral and multilateral agencies to support their development lending activities. Both NDB and \nDFCC have been highly profitable, and have much lower overhead costs than the commercial \nbanks. DFCC, NDB, Commercial Bank, and Sampath Bank are primarily engaged in lending to \nthe small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector. In keeping with the needs of SMEs, \nDFCC and NDB have been scaling up training facilities and creating specialized branches or \ndivisions geared to serving SMEs.   \n \n11.  There  are  six  regional  development  finance  institutions\u2014Wayamba,  Kandurate, \nSabaragamuwa,  Ruhuma,  Rajaratna,  and  Uva.  These  are  mainly  conduits  for  government \nsubsidized credit programs, small business lending, and micro-lending. Collectively, they have \n194 branches and assets of SLRs13.5 billion or just below 5% of the assets of all LSBs. There \nare also three small private savings and development banks including Samasa, established by \nthrift and credit societies, and the Ceylinco Group. The regional development finance institutions \nhave  been  mainly  ineffectual  because  of  a  lack  of  basic  lending  and  other  skills.  The \nGovernment is considering merging the six regional institutions with the recently established \nLanka Putra Bank to serve the SME sector better. However, it remains to be seen whether \nLanka Putra Bank can fulfill its mandate. Experience from specialized SME banks in Sri Lanka \nand  elsewhere  points  to  their  difficulties  in  delivering  designed  outcomes.  As  such,  SME \nfinancing cannot be divorced from the mainstream financial institutions.  \n \n12.  Performance Indicators. The banking sector in Sri Lanka is sounder and more resilient \nas a result of reforms undertaken over the past two decades. The benefits of reforms are borne \nout by banking sector performance indicators\u2014the ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) to total \nloans has fallen, the capital adequacy ratio has increased, and profitability has risen. The \naverage capital adequacy ratio of commercial banks increased from 8.6% in 2001 to 11.9% in \n2006. NPLs,1 as a percentage of total loans, declined from 15.3% in 2001 to 6% in 2006 in the \nbanking sector. The quality of banking supervision has improved since 2002, with all banks now \nbeing examined on-site at least once in a 2-year cycle. Together with increased depth in off-site \nanalysis, this has greatly improved the ability of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to identify \nweaknesses  in  banks.  However,  the  implementation  of  remedial  measures  still  lacks \ndecisiveness and effectiveness. Prudential standards have been strengthened.       \n \n13.  Specialized  Leasing  Companies.  Specialized  leasing  companies  (SLCs)  recorded \nimproved performance in 2006 in terms of profitability, capital, asset quality, and compliance \nwith prudential regulations. There were 20 SLCs at the end of 2006. Of these, seven companies \naccounted for 83% of the total assets of SLCs. The total assets of SLCs increased by 25% from \n2005 to 2006 to SLRs67 billion, while total finance leases increased by 11% to SLRs29 billion \nover the same period. \n \n14.  As SLCs are not permitted to accept deposits from the public, they are mainly dependent \non bank borrowings or funds obtained through the issue of debt securities. Therefore, at the \nrequest of SLCs, CBSL has recommended an amendment to the Finance Leasing Act No. 56, \n2000, to permit SLCs to mobilize funds through the issue of debt instruments. However, if SLCs \nare  permitted  to  mobilize  funds  from  the  public,  more  prudential  norms  are  required  to \nsafeguard the interests of investors in particular, and the stability of financial system in general.  \n \n15.  The industry average of gearing ratio (debt to capital) of SLCs was about 4:1 against the \npermitted maximum ratio of 10:1, indicating a sound financial position. SLCs mainly depend on \nborrowings from banks and borrowings made against asset-backed securities. \n                                                      \n1 This refers to gross NPLs ratio unless otherwise specified.  \n ", "18  Appendix 2 \n16.  In 2006, CBSL issued eight directions to SLCs relating to minimum capital, provision for \nbad and doubtful accommodation, single borrower limit, gearing ratio, accrued interest, reserve \nfund, financial statements, and corporate and operational information. \n \n17.  A high concentration of the leasing portfolio of SLCs is in vehicle financing, which \naccounts for 81%. However, the risks associated with possible defaults are largely mitigated by \nthe nature of finance leases, where the vehicle is considered security and SLCs have absolute \nownership of such vehicles. This concentration is not considered a major risk to the industry, as \nvehicles financed are used for public transport, goods transport, and personal use by a diverse \nclientele. However, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is encouraging SLCs to diversify their leasing \nportfolios by providing facilities for purchase of capital equipment such as machinery. \n \n18.  Facilities granted in respect of leasing showed a declining trend from 2003 to 2006, and \naccounted for 64% of the total portfolio of all SLCs at the end of 2006. In contrast, facilities \ngranted via hire purchase by SLCs increased and amounted to 19% of the total lease facility \napprovals  of  SLCs  at  the  end  of  2006.  Tax  benefits  available  for  hire  purchase  largely \ncontributed to  this shift.  More  than  76%  of  the  hire  purchase  facilities  were  in  respect  of \nvehicles. The combined share of both leasing and hire purchase continued to increase, and \naccounted for 83% of the total lease facility approvals of SLCs at the end of 2006. \n \n19.  Credit Risk. The level of credit risk of the SLC sector depends largely on the quality of \nassets, which is measured by the volume of NPLs and the NPL ratio. The NPL volumes \nreported by the seven largest SLCs have shown a decreasing trend from 2003 to 2006. The \nNPL ratio of SLCs, which continued to decline, reached 2.9% by 30 June 2007. The share of \nNPLs relating to leases continued to decline and reached 6.1% at the end of 2006.  \n \n20.  Operational and other Risks. Sound operating systems, internal controls, and proper \nprocedures are critically important to ensure the financial soundness of an institution. CBSL is \nplanning to issue a code of corporate governance for voluntary compliance by SLCs. The SLCs \nare also required to report information on irregular lease facility approvals n a timely manner to \nthe Credit Information Bureau. \n \n21.  Following a recommendation in the 2003 budget speech, SLCs are required to obtain \nratings for debt instruments they issue to the public that are not guaranteed by a rated financial \ninstitution and each of which exceeds SLRs100 million. This limit was subsequently increased to \nSLRs200 million. \n \n22.  Overall  Performance  of  SLCs.  The  SLC  sector  recorded  satisfactory  performance \nduring 2006. Net profit before tax for 2006 amounted to SLRs1.3 billion and recorded 44% \ngrowth, compared with the previous year. All SLCs, except one, operated profitably during 2006. \nThe overall profitability of SLCs was reflected in their return on assets (ROA) which increased \nfrom 3.3% in 2005 to 3.7% in 2006, and return on equity (ROE) which increased from 18.1% in \n2005 to 19.3% in 2006. \n \n23.  Reform  Challenges.  Recent  indicators  point  to  improved  bank  soundness  and \nperformance in Sri Lanka. However, the reform process remains incomplete. Some segments of \nthe banking sector and individual banks remain vulnerable. In particular, the performance of \nstate-owned banks has generally been weaker than that of private and foreign banks. Improving \nthe performance of state-owned banks should remain a high priority on the reform agenda. The \nkey to financial sector development in Sri Lanka is continuation of the broad thrust of reforms \nthat began in the 1990s to strengthen the government infrastructure and institutional framework, ", "Appendix 2  19\nwhile decreasing direct government intervention. Sustainable progress is dependent on further \nimprovements in the legal framework for financial services and commercial transactions more \ngenerally, building infrastructure, and strengthening and enforcing prudential norms.   \n \n24.  The high cost of credit remains a significant policy concern. The spread between deposit \nand lending rates has widened. However, improved margins are needed by weaker banks to \nearn enough to cover their accumulated loan losses and high operating expenses. Until weak \nbanks (both state-owned and private sector) are restructured or exit the market, competition will \nbe  limited;  margins  will  remain  high;  and  the  relatively  more  efficient  banks,  even  if \nuncompetitive by international standards, will be highly profitable.  \n \n25.  Major potential reform areas include the following: (i) completion of financial sector legal \nreforms, including a securitization bill and anti-money laundering statute; (ii) reform of the state-\nowned  financial  institutions,  addressing  not  only  asset  quality  and  capital  issues,  but \nmodernization so that Sri Lankans will be able to take full advantage of electronic payments, \nATMs, and credit and debit cards; (iii) stringent enforcement of prudential standards for both \npublic and private sector banks to avoid market distortions, higher costs for consumers, and \nextraordinary profits for well-run banks arising from weak banks\u2019 lack of competitiveness; and \n(iv) addressing the infrastructure weakness for financial services, including the introduction of \nmodern insolvency provisions through revision of the Companies Act (1982). \n \n \n \n ", "20  Appendix 3 \nTHE LEASING SECTOR IN SRI LANKA \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  From the late 1970s, finance companies in Sri Lanka offered some leasing within their \nrange of financial products. However, the major growth in finance leasing occurred following the \nformation of two specialized leasing companies (SLCs) sponsored by the International Finance \nCorporation\u2014Lanka Orient Leasing Company (LOLC) in 1980 and Mercantile Leasing in 1983. \nAt the end of 1985, these companies accounted for 77% of lease transactions.1 They were \ngiven tax holidays for 5 years from their formation (footnote 1).  \n \n2.  Until 2001, leasing companies were largely unregulated and mainly specialist by nature. \nA new leasing act was introduced in 2001, permitting new leasing companies to be established \nas long as they met a minimum capital requirement of SLRs75 million ($0.75 million).2 This \nprompted a number of leasing companies to enter the industry. \n \nB.  Portfolio Concentration \n \n3.  The Sri Lankan leasing sector has played an important role in the development of the \ntransport sector, especially in rural areas. Passenger and commercial vehicles are the main \ncategory of assets financed by leasing, with a 70% share of the total portfolio in 2004 (down \nfrom 77% in 2003). Over 75% of leasing companies in Sri Lanka still concentrate on vehicle \nleasing.  Only  a  few  have  diversified  into  other  products  such  as  financing  warehouses, \nhospitals, educational institutions, and office equipment. Over 50% of leases were utilized to \npurchase secondhand vehicles.  \n \n4.  The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) is calling for the leasing industry to diversify into \nother areas and to target small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing. The leasing of \nnon-vehicle equipment has been hampered by the absence of a clear legal process with regard \nto the repossession of equipment, and the short commercial life of so much modern equipment \n(unlike vehicles, which have a ready secondhand value). However, it is typical for vehicles to \ndominate the leasing industry, outside a small number of developed markets. Factories often \nhave less need for leasing in Sri Lanka, as they receive favorable credit lines from development \nfinance institutions. However, machinery required for the tea industry is a potential avenue for \ndevelopment.  \n \nC.  Entry of Banks \n \n5.  Most of the recent entrants into the Sri Lankan leasing industry are subsidiaries of banks \nrather than specialist leasing companies. There is some resentment among specialist leasing \ncompanies  to  these  banking  entrants,  which  are  considered  fair-weather.  Moreover,  as \nindependent  specialist  leasing  companies  are  dependent  on  banks  for  funding,  there  is  a \nconcern that loan requests may be rejected for competitive motives.  \n \nD.  Legal Recourse and Repossession Laws \n \n6.  Litigation to recover bad debts is a protracted and costly process in Sri Lanka. An \narbitration procedure designed to improve this process is not as successful as had been hoped, \n                                                      \n1  ADB. 1986. A Study of Leasing in Selected Developing Member Countries. Singapore.  \n2  ADB. 2005, Financial Assessment Report for Sri Lanka. Manila. ", "Appendix 3  21\nwith procedures often proving even more unwieldy and expensive.3 Leasing companies are \nexcluded from Sri Lanka\u2019s Debt Recovery Act (1990), which enables other financial institutions \nto repossess and sell securities without court intervention. Weaknesses in the guarantee and \nrepossession  laws  hamper  growth  of  the  leasing  sector,  especially  outside  the  better \nunderstood urban automotive sector. \n \nE.  Regulation and Tax Considerations \n \n7.  CBSL issued seven directions in 2006 pertaining to minimum capital, provision for bad \nand  doubtful  lease  facilities,  single  borrower  limit,  gearing  ratio,  reserve  fund,  financial \nstatements, and corporate and operational information. Leasing companies also have moral \nobligations to follow best practices enunciated in the Sri Lanka Accounting/Auditing Standards \nAct No. 15, 1995, through a monitoring board.  \n \n8.  The following regulatory/legal documents govern the leasing industry in Sri Lanka: \n \n(i)  Inland revenue acts and other tax laws, including value-added tax (VAT).  \n(ii)  Regulations  issued  by  the  registrar  of  motor  vehicles  relating  to  leasing  of \nvehicles. \n(iii)  Procedures/arrangements commonly adopted by the Leasing Association of Sri \nLanka;  Credit  Information  Bureau  of  Sri  Lanka;  and  Financial  Ombudsman \nScheme under the purview of Consumer Affairs Authority Act No. 9, 2003. \n(iv)  Consumer Credit Act No. 29, 1982, in respect of hire purchase activities. \n(v)  Credit agency functions under the Mortgage Act No. 6, 1949, and the Trust \nReceipt Ordinance No. 12, 1947. \n \n9.  Over  recent  years,  there  have  been  a  number  of  significant  changes  in  the  fiscal \ntreatment of leasing. A VAT regime was introduced in 2002, with the leasing sector subject to \ninput and output taxes. The input and output taxes have been aligned at 15%. It has been \nargued that these changes have had the effect of making leases less competitive.4 \n \n10.  In 2006, through the   Leasing Association of Sri Lanka, SLCs requested CBSL to permit \nthe mobilization of funds from the public via the issuance of debt instruments. CBSL agreed to \nthis  change  and  has  proposed  an  amendment  to  the  Finance  Leasing  Act  No.  56,  2000. \nHowever, if SLCs are permitted to mobilize funds from the public, more prudential norms are \nrequired to safeguard the interests of investors in particular, and the stability of financial system \nin general. It is expected that the proposed changes to the Finance Leasing Act will allow SLCs \nto raise deposits from the public to come into effect in 2008. \n \nF.  Tax Treatment of Leasing Transactions \n \n11.  The primary features of the tax treatment for leasing transactions are presented below. \n \n(i)  Lessor can claim capital allowances on the cost of the leased asset. \n(ii)  Lessee can claim rentals as allowable expenses. \n(iii)  Generally, rentals are subject to VAT unless specifically exempted. \n(iv)  Import and supply of leased assets are subject to VAT but the lessor can claim \nVAT input credit with some restrictions. \n                                                      \n3  Paul, Lisa. 2007.

Sri Lanka. \n ", "22  Appendix 3 \n(v)  Leasing agreements and receipts are subject to stamp duty, debit tax on the \nprocurement of leased assets, and income tax on profits. \n(vi)  Economic service charge is payable on the turnover. \n(vii)  Hire  purchase  interest  and  other  fee-based  incomes  are  liable  to  financial \nservices VAT on the value addition. \n(viii)  Financial service VAT on the value addition is at the rate of 20%. \n(ix)  Asset disposal income, down payments, and all other receipts are subject to \nVAT. \n(x)  Luxury motor vehicles and other luxury assets are subject to higher VAT rate of \n30%. \n(xi)  Capital allowance on plant and machinery is claimable in 8 years, which is a \ndeterrent to invest through leasing. \n(xii)  Deferred  taxation  treatment  according  to  revised  accounting  standards  has \nimpacted leasing business. \n \nG.  Issues and Concerns affecting the Leasing Sector \n \n12.  The Government of Sri Lanka is also considering changes in legislation that might \nhamper  the  industry:  (i)  reducing  depreciation  allowances  from  25.1%  to  12.5%;  and  (ii) \ncharging leasing companies a tax of the higher of 1% of turnover or SLRs50 million ($0.5 \nmillion). The chair of LOLC argues that \u201cincreases in the VAT rate on leasing, special VAT rates \non  leasing  companies,  economic  service  charges,  and  changes  to  depreciation  rates  on \nvehicles and machinery are likely to make leasing an unattractive financing option to our core \ncustomer base of small- and medium-sized business enterprises. Furthermore, these fiscal \ndisincentives could effectively undermine the collective efforts of the leasing companies to serve \nthe small and medium entrepreneurs who are expected to make a substantial contribution to the \nnational economy\u201d (footnote 4) \n \n13.  The Sri Lankan leasing industry would benefit from improvements in the process of \nasset recovery, greater self-regulation, and the removal of VAT charges on leasing. \n \n14.  Vehicles leased in the Western Province and other areas have ended up in the North \nand East areas, which are under the control of the Tamil Tigers. Because of the escalated \nconflict,  leasing  companies  are  unable  to  visit  these  parts  of  the  country  to  trace  leased \nvehicles. \n \n15.  Commercial/development  banks,  motor  vehicle  agents/dealers,  consumer  goods \nimporters,  and  independent  entrepreneurs  formed  new  leasing/finance  companies\u2014adding \ncompetition in the industry. As a result, the margins enjoyed by the leasing companies are \nexpected to erode. \n \n16.  Machinery/equipment items have a very poor resale value. As a result, lessors face a \nvery high credit risk in the event of a default. The proceeds of resale would be insufficient to \ncover the amount the lessor is due. This results in the lessor seeking legal remedies to mitigate \nlosses.  The  lessor  has  to  face  severe  difficulties  to  exercise  its  repossession  rights.  To \novercome  this  issue,  a  suitable  exclusion  clause  needs  to  be  introduced  to  the  criminal \nprocedure code. \n ", "Appendix 3  23\n17.  Under the current regulatory regime, the lessor does not have the comfort of initiating \nthe  action  against  the  guarantors  in  the  same  action.  Thus,  an  amendment  needs  to  be \nintroduced in the Finance Leasing Act to accommodate guarantors as well. \n \n18.  The principal Finance Leasing Act is to be amended to safeguard the interest of the \nlessor to prevent a lessee selling, disposing, or mortgaging the machinery/equipment item to \nthird parties. \n \n19.  The import and supply of agricultural equipment/machinery is free of VAT. However, \nlease rentals on agricultural machinery are liable for VAT. As such, the lessee is very often a \nfarmer who is expected to pay an additional 15% as VAT on the lease rental. Such an additional \ncost would not be payable on an alternative form of financing, such as a loan. \n \nH.  Global Ranking of the Leasing Industry in Sri Lanka \n \n20.  According to the global leasing report,5 the Sri Lankan leasing industry has performed \nvery satisfactorily in the last 2 years. It was the 42nd largest market (previous year 45th) as \nmeasured by new volume of business disbursements. \n \nI.  Role of the Leasing Association of Sri Lanka \n \n21.  The Leasing Association of Sri Lanka was established in 1980. There are currently 53 \nmember companies, chaired by the CEO of PLC. The principal objectives are to promote, foster, \nprotect, safeguard, represent, and further the interests of the leasing industry; and to regulate \nand ensure the proper conduct of business by its members. \n \n22.  One of the most significant achievements of the Leasing Association in the recent past \nhas been the agreement of CBSL to amend the Finance Leasing Act, enabling registered \nleasing  companies  to  raise  funds  directly  from  the  public.  This  is  considered  a  major \nbreakthrough, as it will reduce the reliance of leasing companies on bank funding and reduce \nthe cost of raising capital by offering low-cost deposits to the public. \n \n                                                      \n5 Paul, Lisa. 2007.

Poverty Analysis                                         Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues. The Sri Lanka Leasing Facility seeks to enhance small- and medium-sized \nenterprise (SME) development by addressing barriers to growth faced by SMEs. The main thrust of the \nProject is to enhance access to finance of SMEs that normally do not have easy access to banking \nservices and products. By adopting this approach, the Project will facilitate the development of a \ncompetitive SME sector that is capable of growth and expansion, and indirectly contribute to poverty \nreduction. Furthermore, a dynamic SME sector will generate employment, contribute to the reduction of \ndirect  government  budget  support  to  SMEs,  and  free  up  resources  for  infrastructure  and  social \ndevelopment. All these factors will lead to reduced poverty.       \n \n2.  Design Features. Pro-poor. The Project creates employment opportunities for unskilled urban \nand rural labor and will thus support income generation.  \n \nTo  facilitate  good  governance,  the  loan  to  People\u2019s  Leasing  Company  Limited  (PLC)  will  help \nstrengthen the company\u2019s corporate governance structures by requiring the establishment of an audit \nand compensation committee and the inclusion of two independent directors on the board of PLC (on a \nbest effort basis). This will contribute to the flow of improved services from the targeted lenders to the \nSMEs. By paying particular attention to the development of rural SMEs, the Project will improve the \nincome  of  rural  households  and  increase employment  opportunities  for  rural  residents,  including \nwomen,  by  establishing  new  SMEs  or  expanding  existing  SMEs\u2014thereby  fostering  social \ndevelopment. \n \n \nC.

By so doing, women who generally receive no wage income \nas  household  workers  will  be  given the  opportunity  to  be  employed  and  to  establish  their  own \nbusinesses.  Furthermore,  the  improvement  of  the  corporate  governance  structure  of  PLC,  as  a \ngovernment-owned  enterprise  focusing  on  SME  development,  will  also  improve  opportunities  for \nwomen to gain access to skill development in both urban and rural areas \n \n2.
