THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nfrom the ordinary capital resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (A loan), and (ii) a \nproposed loan funded through the participation of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) Infrastructure Fund (B loan) under the Inclusive Financing Facility, both to the Kingdom \nof Cambodia for the Agricultural Value Chain Competitiveness and Safety Enhancement Project. \nThe report also describes (i) the proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), and (ii) the proposed administration of a grant to be provided \nby  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR),  both  for  the  Agricultural  Value  Chain \nCompetitiveness and Safety Enhancement Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loans, \nI, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the AFD \nloan and JFPR grant. \n \n2.  The project will strengthen value chains of competitive agricultural products (CAPs)\u2014 \ncassava, mangoes, cashew nuts, vegetables, and native chickens\u2014in the provinces of Kampong \nCham, Kampong Thom, Oddar Meanchey, Preah Vihear, Siem Reap, and Tboung Khmum.1 The \nproject  will  (i)  facilitate  access  to  credit  for  agro-enterprises  and  agricultural  cooperatives;                 \n(ii)  promote  viable  market  links  among  agro-enterprises  and  agricultural  cooperatives,  and \nenhance food safety and quality; and (iii) improve farm-to-market connectivity. The project will \nbenefit  about  230  agricultural  cooperatives  (about  27,000  households)  and  about  50 \nagribusinesses in the project areas. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Limited  value  addition  to  agriculture.  Cambodia  has  a  narrow  economic  base \ndominated by agriculture, construction, garments, and tourism. Given the large rural population \n(76.2% of the total population), the government continues to support agriculture as a priority \nsector, promoting agro-based industrial development as a driver of economic diversification. \nWhile agriculture still accounted for 22.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) and 31.2% of \ntotal employment in 2019, the sector\u2019s performance has been weak with an average growth rate \nof 1.7% during 2010\u20132019.2 Rice has been favored to ensure national food security and it remains \nthe predominant crop, accounting for 70% of the country\u2019s cultivated land and 60% of agriculture \noutput. The rice-centric sector policy helped to achieve rice self-sufficiency; however, it hindered \nagricultural  diversification,  value  addition,  and  commercialization.  Despite  its  potential,  the \ncountry\u2019s export of agro-based products is mostly in raw form and depends heavily on a few crops \nsuch as rice and rubber. Only 10% of the total agricultural outputs are processed within the \ncountry.3 The value of manufactured agro-based products remains only at 4% of GDP. Most \nformal agro-processing businesses are concentrated in rice milling and primary processing of \n \n1  These five value chains are selected considering export orientation, import substitution, value addition, and impact \non income enhancement. Cashew, cassava, and mangoes are important crops for processing and export; vegetables \nwill strengthen import substitution; and native chickens will have high income-generation impact. \n2  ADB. 2020. Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific. Manila. Agricultural growth has been gradually declining over the \ndecade mainly because of the reduction in the long-term labor productivity in rice production, low international \ncommodity prices in major traditional commodities (e.g., rice, rubber, and cotton), and adverse weather conditions. \nWomen account for 74.0% of the agricultural workforce and produce 80.0% of Cambodia\u2019s food. However, only \n12.4% of women own land and 10.0% of female farmers have access to agriculture extension services. (ADB. 2013. \nGender Equality in the Labor Market in Cambodia. Manila.) \n3  Government of Cambodia. 2015.

As a result, Cambodia has been losing economic opportunities that can arise \nfrom agricultural value addition. \n \n4.  Impact of coronavirus disease. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has  \nseverely disrupted agricultural supply chains due to restrictions on the movement of people and \ngoods, causing lost income and market opportunities for farmers and agribusinesses.4 While a \nshortage of staple crops is not anticipated, the impact of COVID-19 will affect the food security \nand nutrition of the households that lost jobs and livelihoods.5 While agriculture cannot fully \nabsorb laid off workers, most of whom are from tourism and garment sectors, and returning \nmigrant workers, it will play a key role in providing rural livelihoods and diversifying income \nsources through agricultural diversification and commercialization, including agro-processing.  \n \n5.  Poor access to finance. Credit to agriculture and agribusinesses together accounted for \nonly 9.4% of formal finance in Cambodia in 2018, and access to finance is the major bottleneck \nfor Cambodian agribusinesses.6 First, they cannot meet high collateral requirements. Despite the \ngovernment\u2019s  promotion  of  cash  flow-based  lending,  financial  institutions  require  collateral \nbecause of agribusinesses\u2019 poor cash flows. Second, financial institutions tend to provide high-\ninterest and short-term loans because of the risks associated with agriculture and agribusinesses \nthat are small and informal and deal with price-volatile agricultural products.7 Lack of credit history \nand low financial literacy are other reasons for their poor financial access. Addressing the \nconstrained access to finance is critical to spur post-pandemic recovery. \n \n6.  Weak value chain links and lack of enabling business environment. Value chain links \nare still nascent except for rice and a few other products led by large international agribusinesses. \nMost agro-enterprises cannot maximize their operation because of the difficulty in sourcing raw \nmaterials of sufficient quality and volume from small, fragmented farmers. Farmers also lack the \ncapacity to produce in-demand, high-value crops because they lack access to quality seeds and \nbreeds, extension services, credit, and market information.8 Furthermore, despite the increasing \ndemand in modern retail and export markets, agro-enterprises face difficulties in meeting food \nsafety standards because of their weak quality control and the lack of support services such as \nfood safety testing. None of the agro-product safety testing laboratories under the Ministry of \nAgriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) currently meets international standards due to low \nstaff capacity, poor testing equipment, and limited budget for operation and maintenance (O&M).9 \nAgro-enterprises bear the high cost and longer time needed to have their products tested abroad \nto sell to those markets. \n \n7.  Weak and deteriorating farm-to-market road network. Cambodia ranked 98th of 160 \ncountries in the World Bank\u2019s logistics performance index (2018). Competitive agricultural value \nchains (AVCs) and agribusiness operations require efficient transportation and infrastructure \nsystems, particularly rural roads and the links to provincial and national roads that connect rural \nareas with the main urban centers and marketplaces. However, the condition of rural roads in \nCambodia is still poor. On average, only about 5% of the rural roads of the project provinces are \npaved. Almost all remaining rural roads are surfaced with laterite, which easily deteriorates from \n \n4  ADB lowered its projection for GDP growth in 2020 to \u20134.0% (September 2020) from a forecast of 2.3% (April 2020). \n(ADB. 2020.

Strategic  fit.  The  project  is  aligned  with  key  government  strategies  including  the \nRectangular Strategy Phase IV.11 To minimize the adverse economic and social impacts of \nCOVID-19,  the  government  has  taken  measures  including  supporting  crops  and  livestock \nproduction, and domestic food processing of staple food products; and establishing a public small \nand medium-sized enterprise (SME) credit guarantee scheme to improve access to finance for \nSMEs. The project is aligned with the government\u2019s economic recovery efforts. It will also support \nthe third pillar of green, inclusive, and sustainable growth of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nfor Cambodia, 2019\u22122023, and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table 1).12 \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Operational   \nPriorities  Project interventions \nAddressing remaining  The project will increase jobs and economic opportunities and diversify income \npoverty and reducing  opportunities for farmers and migrant workers returning because of the \ninequalities  coronavirus disease, thereby contributing to reducing rural\u2013urban inequality. \nAccelerating progress in  The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. The project will include \ngender equality  measures to improve women\u2019s access to finance, ensure greater participation of \nwomen, and integrate gender-responsive design in project-related infrastructure. \nTackling climate change,  The project will promote climate change adaptation and mitigation and \nbuilding climate and disaster  environmental sustainability by supporting (i) water- and energy-saving technology \nresilience, and enhancing  and operations in on-farm production and processing, (ii) good agricultural \nenvironmental sustainability  practices, and (iii) climate-proofed engineering designs for farm-to-market roads. \nPromoting rural development  The project will strengthen the value chains of competitive agricultural products \nand food security  and contribute to agricultural diversification, commercialization, trade, and \nincreased economic opportunities built upon primary agricultural production. \nFostering regional  The project will foster international and regional trade in agro-products through \ncooperation and integration  increased tradable agro-products and food, upgrading of agro-product and food \nsafety testing laboratories, improved safety control capacity by agricultural \ncooperatives and agro-enterprises, and better farm-to-market connectivity. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nB.

The equity capital loan credit line will provide borrowers with \nsupplemental equity on a subordinated basis in cases where the borrower lacks equity to qualify \nfor the primary loan (i.e., AVC loans). The credit guarantee fund will provide guarantees to PFIs\u2019 \nprovision of AVC loans and equity capital loans to reduce their risk exposure. In addition, the \nproject, in cooperation with PFIs, will help the agro-enterprises and agricultural cooperatives \nstrengthen their business planning and loan applications. The project will also pilot a green \nfinancing scheme to be financed by the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund.17 \n \n11.  Output 2: Agricultural value chain linkage and safety strengthened. This output will \naddress key bottlenecks in the value chains by (i) engaging and supporting about 230 participating \nagricultural cooperatives (PACs)18 to improve their production capacity through demonstration \nfarms  and  small  agricultural  infrastructure  support  and  to  establish  inclusive  business \npartnerships (IBPs) with participating agro-enterprises (PAEs) to be engaged for sustainable \nvalue chain linkages;19 (ii) building the capacity of PACs and PAEs on food safety control and \nsupporting them to obtain agro-product safety assurance certificates;20 (iii) supporting research \nand development on crop seed varieties and poultry breeds, and multiplying and disseminating \nhigh-yield,  drought-resilient,  and  disease-resistant  crop  seeds  and  planting  materials;                         \n(iv)  upgrading  agro-product  safety  testing  laboratories  for  International  Organization  for \nStandardization 17025 accreditation;21 and (v) enhancing digitalization of government\u2019s services \nthrough an integrated agricultural data platform, multichannel extension services, and piloting of \na traceability system. The project will also support developing a strategic plan for agro-food safety \ntesting  laboratory  system  upgrading  and  operation  plans  as  a  condition  for  item  (iv);  and \n \n14 Beneficiary agro-enterprises have operations in, or source agro-products from, the six project provinces. However, \ngiven the growing need for access to finance after COVID-19, the geographic coverage and target AVCs may be \nexpanded, while support for agricultural cooperatives will be limited to the six project provinces. A majority of the \nbeneficiary agro-enterprises and agricultural cooperatives of output 1 are expected to be from project participating \nagro-enterprises and participating agricultural cooperatives. \n15 Sathapana Bank and the Agricultural and Rural Development Bank have been selected as PFIs for their substantial \nportfolio in agriculture and SME lending, and their interest and willingness to participate in the project. Other financial \ninstitutions may be added as PFIs during the project implementation as needed. \n16 Four types of AVC loans comprise: (i) farm production loans for contract growers, (ii) short- to medium-term business \nloans, (iii) inventory procurement loans, and (iv) long-term business loans. Details are in the Project Administration \nManual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB will provide technical assistance to design the green financing mechanism. (ADB. 2018. Green and Innovative \nFinance Initiative for Scaling Up Southeast Asian Infrastructure. Manila [TA 9621-REG]). The ASEAN Infrastructure \nFund will provide financing to pilot the scheme under the proposed project. \n18 There are currently 240 registered agricultural cooperatives and several unregistered farmers groups in the six \nproject provinces. Of these, 230 will be selected and new ones to be added if needed as the PACs based on criteria \nincluding minimum years of operation and minimum proportion of female members. Details are provided in the Project \nAdministration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Of the 230 target PACs, 60 will \nspecialize in cashew, 100 in cassava, 10 in mangoes, and 60 in vegetable production. Poultry farmers are individuals. \n19 The IBP is a mutually beneficial business partnership between PACs (or farmers groups) and PAEs that source raw \nmaterials from the PACs. The roles and responsibilities of PAEs and PACs under an IBP are provided in the Project \nAdministration Manual. The IBPs are expected to improve PACs\u2019 access to finance by providing the PFIs assurance \nof the PACs\u2019 business viability, together with sales agreements and contract farming. \n20 Certificates include Cambodian Good Agricultural Practices (CamGAP), CamOrganic and Good Animal Husbandry \nPractices (GAHP) for PACs, and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points \n(HACCP) for PAEs. \n21 The laboratories the project will support include the National Agriculture Laboratory for pesticide residue analysis (for \nmangoes and vegetables), the Cambodia Laboratory of Agricultural Products and Foods for mycotoxin analysis (for \ncashew nuts), and the National Animal Health and Production Research Institute for antibiotics analysis (for meat). \n ", "5 \ndeveloping a strategic plan for digitalization of MAFF services as a condition for item (v). \n \n12.  Output 3: Agricultural value chain connectivity enhanced. This output will improve \nabout 110 kilometers of farm-to-market roads (FMRs) in the project areas.22 Laterite roads will be \nupgraded with double bituminous surface treatment. Climate change adaptation measures have \nbeen incorporated into the design of FMRs.23 Improved FMRs will enhance connectivity among \nvalue chain actors of the CAPs by reducing transport time and cost, increasing the volume of \ntransportation, and reducing road maintenance costs.

They include (i) the Climate-Friendly Agribusiness Value \nChain Sector Project, which exemplified implementation arrangements for multisector projects; \n(ii) the Skills for Competitiveness Project, which covers skills development for agro-industry; and \n(iii) the Third Rural Roads Improvement Project, covering two of the project provinces.25 ADB also \ncoordinates with other development partners in the agriculture, natural resources, and rural \ndevelopment  (ANR)  sector  in  Cambodia.26 The  project  will  complement  ongoing  technical \nassistance by the Japan International Cooperation Agency for one of the agro-product safety \ntesting laboratories through financing equipment, works, and supplies to upgrade the facility. \n \n14.  The project has also incorporated lessons from ADB\u2019s experience. To overcome weak \ngovernment capacity and overlapping roles within and across government agencies, the proposed \nimplementation  arrangements  include  clear  delineation  of  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the \nexecuting and implementing agencies, a strong coordination mechanism, and substantive support \nfrom the project management and implementation units. To address the limited private sector \ninvestment in ANR projects, the project is designed to facilitate private sector engagement.27 \nGiven the importance of partnership with suitable financial institutions, the project has selected \nthe PFIs based on their strong agriculture and SME lending portfolio in Cambodia (footnote 15). \n \n15.  The  project  will  add  value  to  the  ANR  sector  in  Cambodia.  First,  the  project  will \ndemonstrate an approach to promoting private sector-driven AVC development. Second, the \nproject  will  introduce  three mutually  reinforcing  financial  schemes to promote  financing for \n \n22 While the Cambodian Road Law classifies such roads as rural roads, the term \u201cfarm-to-market road\u201d is used in this \ndocument to emphasize the nature of rural roads supported by the project. \n23 Funded by the Nordic Development Fund to incorporate climate change proofing to the road design and improve \nproject readiness, the detailed engineering designs have been completed for all six envisaged FMR subprojects. \n24 The project will follow the practices of ADB\u2019s rural roads improvement projects in Cambodia. Under the Second Rural \nRoads Improvement Project, a rural roads asset management system and asset management tools are being \ndeveloped and will be completed by the end of 2020. (ADB. 2014.

Technical due diligence included a review of (i) technologies and practices used in agro-\nprocessing and primary production, (ii) technologies and operations of agro-product safety testing \nlaboratories, (iii) applications of information and communication technology in MAFF\u2019s operation \nand services, and (iv) the FMR design. The findings were reflected in the design of works, \nselection of consulting services and technologies, and areas for capacity building. Climate change \nmitigation measures will include the promotion of water- and energy-saving technology and \noperations in on-farm production and processing, and good agricultural practices. Climate change \nadaptation measures for output 3 comprise (i) raising embankment levels to minimize increased \nseasonal flood risks, (ii) increasing the number of pipe culverts and box culverts to allow cross \ndrainage of flash floods, and (iii) concrete-surfacing to mitigate flood risks from the Mekong River. \n \n24.  Safe working under COVID-19 conditions. Given that the impact of COVID-19 is \nevolving, project implementation will be responsive and flexible in meeting emerging needs and \nnew best practices in construction and project management. The executing and implementing \nagencies,  project  implementation  consultants,  and  contractors  will  incorporate  emerging \ninternational construction best practice for managing COVID-19 risk in works and will follow \ngovernment guidance on working safely in COVID-19 conditions. \n \n ", "9 \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n25.  Cost\u2013benefit analysis was used to assess the economic viability of investment in the five \nCAP value chains (para. 2) over 25 years. Most benefits were derived from (i) increased yields \nand reduced post-harvest loss from the use of the quality inputs and seeds, training on good \nagricultural  practices,  and  improved  post-harvest  techniques;  and  (ii)  increased  volume  of \nprocessing because of the increased processing capacities. The economic internal rate of return \nis 20.63%. Economic viability of investment in the FMRs was assessed based on economic \nbenefits expected from the costs and time saved in operating different types of vehicles over 25 \nyears. The analysis confirmed the economic viability of the FMR investment with an economic \ninternal rate of return of 15.4%. Although it was not quantified, the improved FMRs will benefit the \ntargeted value chains because the FMRs selected are in the core areas of the value chains. \n \n26.  For  output  1,  capital  adequacy,  asset  quality,  management,  earnings,  liquidity,  and \nsensitivity analysis confirmed that both PFIs meet the eligibility requirements, have satisfactory \nfinancial performance, and show satisfactory performance prospects based on their projected \nfinancial position.31 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n27.  Incremental recurrent cost analyses were conducted for outputs 2 and 3 to assess the \ngovernment\u2019s capacity to meet the additional O&M requirements. While increased revenues are \nexpected from the upgraded laboratories, the MAFF will continue to allocate budget to ensure \nproper O&M of the laboratories. The project will also finance a 5-year service contract to ensure \nthe maintenance of equipment during project implementation. The project will support the MAFF \nin  developing  a  business  and  operational  plan  to  improve  the  sustainability  of  laboratory \noperations. For output 3, the analysis shows an expected budget shortfall of 20% in the overall \nO&M requirement of the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD). However, the MRD has already \ninitiated discussions with the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) to increase the budgetary \nallocation for rural roads and is developing an asset management system that will allow more \nrational and cost-effective rural road network maintenance (footnote 24). \n \nD.  Governance \n \n28.  Financial management. ADB assessed the financial management of MAFF, MEF, and \nMRD.  The  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial management risk  is  substantial mainly  due  to                \n(i) complex implementation arrangements, (ii) project staff\u2019s lack of experience in accounting and \nfinancial management, (iii) lack of information technology software and equipment, and (iv) weak \ninternal  audit.  The  mitigation  measures  include  (i)  engagement  of  financial  management \nconsultants, (ii) capacity building on financial management and internal audit for project staff, and \n(iii) use of information technology software. Financial due diligence on the two PFIs confirmed \ntheir systems and policies are adequate to manage the project credit lines. \n \n29.  Procurement. The procurement classification for the project is assessed as low risk. \nProcurement of goods and works and recruitment of consultants will be undertaken following \nADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations \n \n31 Financial Due Diligence Report for Agricultural and Rural Development Bank and Financial Due Diligence Report for \nSathapana Bank (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nfor ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The project is eligible for universal \nprocurement.32  \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 29).  \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n31.  Poverty and social development. The project is classified general intervention.33 The \ntargeted  direct  beneficiaries  are  230  PACs  (about  27,000  households)  and  about  50 \nagribusinesses in the project areas. The average poverty rate in the project areas is about 20%. \nOddar Meanchey Province has the highest poverty rate (28.9%) and Tboung Khmum Province \nhas the lowest (13.6%). The average size of household land holdings is less than 2 hectares and \nabout 13% of households have less than 1 hectare. Commune registrations show that, on \naverage, 13% of households in the project areas do not own any cultivated land. One IBP criterion \nis for the PAC to include at least 10% of its members from the poor and low-income households. \n \n32.  Gender and development. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. \nWomen comprise the majority of seasonal and permanent unskilled workers in mango, vegetable, \nand cashew processing; while male labor dominates poultry and cassava processing. While men \nand women do not have equal decision-making power over family income, assets, and economic \nactivities, women are gaining prominence in agricultural cooperatives and hold about 30% of \nmanagement roles in potential PACs. The project promotes women\u2019s participation in PAEs, PACs, \nand as farmers by (i) developing and delivering outreach, education, and community activities to \nincrease the proportion of PAEs owned by women and female borrowers\u2019 access to subloans;     \n(ii) supporting women-led PACs in obtaining agro-product safety certificates; (iii) undertaking a \nneeds assessment and delivering training, including on gender sensitization, access to finance, \nimproved  planting  materials  and  breeds,  demonstration  farming,  and  leadership  skills;  and            \n(iv) delivering road safety training along the improved roads.34 Further, the project will support the \ntwo PFIs in developing inclusive and gender-responsive loan application criteria and guidelines \nto enable successful loan applications from women-owned PAEs and female borrowers. MAFF \nand PFIs will appoint gender focal points to implement and monitor the gender action plan. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n33.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.35 \n \n34.  Environment (category B). ADB prepared an initial environmental examination and an \nenvironmental management plan based on the feasibility studies for output 2 and detailed \n \n32 ADB. 2013.

ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) will be applied to safeguards assessment of \nall project activities whether they are financed by ADB or AFD. Meaningful consultation and disclosure requirements \nwill follow those outlined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). ADB will monitor safeguard compliance as \npart of its supervision missions, which AFD may join.  \n ", "11 \nengineering designs for output 3.36 An environmental and social management system (ESMS) \nwas developed for output 1.37 The ESMS sets out safeguard screening, review, and management \nprocedures with environmental thresholds to help the PFIs categorize interventions to be funded \nby subloans. The project will not finance activities identified under outputs 1 and 2 that are              \n(i) classified as category A for environment or category A or B for involuntary resettlement or \nindigenous peoples, or (ii) against the prohibited investment activities list set out in Appendix 5 of \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n35.  The  project  activities  under  outputs  1  and  2  are  small  in  scale  and  limited  to  the \nimprovement  of  agricultural  facilities.  Environmental  impacts  are  expected  to  be  minor  to \nmoderate and site-specific. The proposed paving and drainage improvements of the FMRs under \noutput 3 will have localized impacts during construction, including increased noise, dust, and \ntraffic, and there may be an increase in road traffic and speed during operation. All identified \nimpacts can be mitigated as presented in the environmental management plan. The project is \nexpected to provide some environmental benefits, including raising farmers\u2019 awareness of the \nresponsible use of agricultural chemicals and climate-resilient farming practices, and improving \nlaboratory waste management, flood resilience, and community safety on project roads. \n \n36.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  is  not  expected  to  have  any \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts.38 For output 3, ADB conducted due diligence for the six FMR \nsubprojects  based  on  the  detailed  engineering  designs.  The  MRD  prepared  a  community \nparticipation framework with sufficient budget to guide impact screening and address any potential \nimpacts of the FMR subprojects during implementation.39 Social safeguard screening criteria are \nincluded in the ESMS, the IBP agreement template, and the PAM. Meaningful information \ndissemination and consultations were conducted with 1,146 people, including 526 women, in the \nsix project provinces and will continue throughout the project implementation. \n \n37.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project is not expected to directly or indirectly \naffect the dignity, human rights, livelihood systems, or culture of indigenous peoples, nor does it \naffect the territories or natural or cultural resources that indigenous peoples own, use, occupy, or \nclaim as their ancestral domain. \n \n38.  The MAFF, MEF, and MRD have experience with ADB projects and, together with the \nPFIs,  showed  strong  commitment  to  safeguards  compliance  for  the  project.  The  project \nimplementation consultants will support all relevant agencies to ensure safeguard compliance. \nConsultations  with  stakeholders  and  affected  persons  will  continue  during  implementation. \nProject-related complaints will be addressed in a timely manner through a grievance redress \nmechanism established at the project management unit. \n \nG.
