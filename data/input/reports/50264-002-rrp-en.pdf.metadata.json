The  project  will \nbenefit  about  230  agricultural  cooperatives  (about  27,000  households)  and  about  50 \nagribusinesses in the project areas. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nLimited  value  addition  to  agriculture.  Cambodia  has  a  narrow  economic  base \ndominated by agriculture, construction, garments, and tourism. Given the large rural population \n(76.2%  of  the  total  population),  the  government  continues  to  support  agriculture  as  a  priority \nsector,  promoting  agro-based  industrial  development  as  a  driver  of  economic  diversification. \nWhile agriculture still accounted for 22.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) and 31.2% of \ntotal employment in 2019, the sector\u2019s performance has been weak with an average growth rate \nof 1.7% during 2010\u20132019.2 Rice has been favored to ensure national food security and it remains \nthe predominant crop, accounting for 70% of the country\u2019s cultivated land and 60% of agriculture \noutput. The rice-centric sector policy helped to achieve rice self-sufficiency; however, it hindered \nagricultural  diversification,  value  addition,  and  commercialization.  Despite  its  potential,  the \ncountry\u2019s export of agro-based products is mostly in raw form and depends heavily on a few crops \nsuch  as  rice  and  rubber.  Only  10%  of  the  total  agricultural  outputs  are  processed  within  the \ncountry.3 The  value  of  manufactured  agro-based  products  remains  only  at  4%  of  GDP.  Most \nformal  agro-processing  businesses  are  concentrated  in  rice  milling  and  primary  processing  of \n\n \n\n1  These five value chains are selected considering export orientation, import substitution, value addition, and impact \non income enhancement. Cashew, cassava, and mangoes are important crops for processing and export; vegetables \nwill strengthen import substitution; and native chickens will have high income-generation impact. \n\n2  ADB. 2020. Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific. Manila. Agricultural growth has been gradually declining over the \ndecade  mainly  because  of  the  reduction  in  the  long-term  labor  productivity  in  rice  production,  low  international \ncommodity prices in major traditional commodities (e.g., rice, rubber, and cotton), and adverse weather conditions. \nWomen  account  for  74.0%  of  the  agricultural  workforce  and  produce  80.0%  of  Cambodia\u2019s  food.  However,  only \n12.4% of women own land and 10.0% of female farmers have access to agriculture extension services. (ADB. 2013. \nGender Equality in the Labor Market in Cambodia. Manila.) \n\n3  Government  of  Cambodia.  2015.

As a result, Cambodia has been losing economic opportunities that can arise \nfrom agricultural value addition. \n \n4. \nImpact  of  coronavirus  disease.  The  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  has  \nseverely disrupted agricultural supply chains due to restrictions on the movement of people and \ngoods, causing lost income and market opportunities for farmers and agribusinesses.4 While a \nshortage of staple crops is not anticipated, the impact of COVID-19 will affect the food security \nand  nutrition  of  the  households  that  lost  jobs  and  livelihoods. 5 While  agriculture  cannot  fully \nabsorb  laid  off  workers,  most  of  whom  are  from  tourism  and  garment  sectors,  and  returning \nmigrant  workers,  it  will  play  a  key  role  in  providing  rural  livelihoods  and  diversifying  income \nsources through agricultural diversification and commercialization, including agro-processing.  \n \nPoor access to finance. Credit to agriculture and agribusinesses together accounted for \n5. \nonly 9.4% of formal finance in Cambodia in 2018, and access to finance is the major bottleneck \nfor Cambodian agribusinesses.6 First, they cannot meet high collateral requirements. Despite the \ngovernment\u2019s  promotion  of  cash  flow-based  lending,  financial  institutions  require  collateral \nbecause of agribusinesses\u2019 poor cash flows. Second, financial institutions tend to provide high-\ninterest and short-term loans because of the risks associated with agriculture and agribusinesses \nthat are small and informal and deal with price-volatile agricultural products.7 Lack of credit history \nand  low  financial  literacy  are  other  reasons  for  their  poor  financial  access.  Addressing  the \nconstrained access to finance is critical to spur post-pandemic recovery. \n \n6. \nWeak value chain links and lack of enabling business environment. Value chain links \nare still nascent except for rice and a few other products led by large international agribusinesses. \nMost agro-enterprises cannot maximize their operation because of the difficulty in sourcing raw \nmaterials of sufficient quality and volume from small, fragmented farmers. Farmers also lack the \ncapacity to produce in-demand, high-value crops because they lack access to quality seeds and \nbreeds, extension services, credit, and market information.8 Furthermore, despite the increasing \ndemand  in modern retail  and  export  markets,  agro-enterprises face  difficulties  in meeting food \nsafety standards because of their weak quality control and the lack of support services such as \nfood  safety  testing.  None  of  the  agro-product  safety  testing  laboratories  under  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries  (MAFF)  currently  meets  international  standards  due  to  low \nstaff capacity, poor testing equipment, and limited budget for operation and maintenance (O&M).9 \nAgro-enterprises bear the high cost and longer time needed to have their products tested abroad \nto sell to those markets. \n \nWeak and deteriorating farm-to-market road network. Cambodia ranked 98th of 160 \n7. \ncountries in the World Bank\u2019s logistics performance index (2018). Competitive agricultural value \nchains  (AVCs)  and  agribusiness  operations  require  efficient  transportation  and  infrastructure \nsystems, particularly rural roads and the links to provincial and national roads that connect rural \nareas  with  the main  urban  centers  and marketplaces.  However, the  condition  of  rural  roads  in \nCambodia is still poor. On average, only about 5% of the rural roads of the project provinces are \npaved. Almost all remaining rural roads are surfaced with laterite, which easily deteriorates from \n\n \n\n4  ADB lowered its projection for GDP growth in 2020 to \u20134.0% (September 2020) from a forecast of 2.3% (April 2020). \n(ADB. 2020.

The  project  is  aligned  with  key  government  strategies  including  the \n8. \nRectangular  Strategy  Phase  IV. 11 To  minimize  the  adverse  economic  and  social  impacts  of \nCOVID-19,  the  government  has  taken  measures  including  supporting  crops  and  livestock \nproduction, and domestic food processing of staple food products; and establishing a public small \nand medium-sized enterprise (SME) credit guarantee scheme to improve access to finance for \nSMEs. The project is aligned with the government\u2019s economic recovery efforts. It will also support \nthe third pillar of green, inclusive, and sustainable growth of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nfor Cambodia, 2019\u22122023, and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table 1).12 \n \n\nStrategy 2030 Operational \nPriorities \nAddressing remaining \npoverty and reducing \ninequalities \nAccelerating progress in \ngender equality \n\nTackling climate change, \nbuilding climate and disaster \nresilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability \nPromoting rural development \nand food security \n\nFostering regional \ncooperation and integration \n\nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \n\n \nProject interventions \n\nThe project will increase jobs and economic opportunities and diversify income \nopportunities for farmers and migrant workers returning because of the \ncoronavirus disease, thereby contributing to reducing rural\u2013urban inequality. \nThe project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. The project will include \nmeasures to improve women\u2019s access to finance, ensure greater participation of \nwomen, and integrate gender-responsive design in project-related infrastructure. \nThe project will promote climate change adaptation and mitigation and \nenvironmental sustainability by supporting (i) water- and energy-saving technology \nand operations in on-farm production and processing, (ii) good agricultural \npractices, and (iii) climate-proofed engineering designs for farm-to-market roads. \nThe project will strengthen the value chains of competitive agricultural products \nand contribute to agricultural diversification, commercialization, trade, and \nincreased economic opportunities built upon primary agricultural production. \nThe project will foster international and regional trade in agro-products through \nincreased tradable agro-products and food, upgrading of agro-product and food \nsafety testing laboratories, improved safety control capacity by agricultural \ncooperatives and agro-enterprises, and better farm-to-market connectivity. \n\nProject Description \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) inclusive and sustainable development \nin  agriculture  sector  achieved;  and  (ii)  private  sector  developed  by  promoting  SMEs  and \nentrepreneurship (footnote 11).

The  equity  capital  loan  credit  line  will  provide  borrowers  with \nsupplemental equity on a subordinated basis in cases where the borrower lacks equity to qualify \nfor the primary loan (i.e., AVC loans). The credit guarantee fund will provide guarantees to PFIs\u2019 \nprovision  of  AVC  loans  and  equity  capital  loans  to  reduce  their  risk  exposure.  In  addition,  the \nproject,  in  cooperation  with  PFIs,  will  help  the  agro-enterprises  and  agricultural  cooperatives \nstrengthen  their  business  planning  and  loan  applications.  The  project  will  also  pilot  a  green \nfinancing scheme to be financed by the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund.17 \n \nOutput 2: Agricultural value chain linkage and safety strengthened. This output will \n11. \naddress key bottlenecks in the value chains by (i) engaging and supporting about 230 participating \nagricultural  cooperatives  (PACs)18 to  improve  their  production  capacity  through  demonstration \nfarms  and  small  agricultural  infrastructure  support  and  to  establish  inclusive  business \npartnerships  (IBPs)  with  participating  agro-enterprises  (PAEs)  to  be  engaged  for  sustainable \nvalue  chain  linkages;19 (ii)  building  the  capacity  of  PACs  and  PAEs  on  food  safety  control  and \nsupporting them to obtain agro-product safety assurance certificates;20 (iii) supporting research \nand development on crop seed varieties and poultry breeds, and multiplying and disseminating \nhigh-yield,  drought-resilient,  and  disease-resistant  crop  seeds  and  planting  materials;                         \n(iv)  upgrading  agro-product  safety  testing  laboratories  for  International  Organization  for \nStandardization 17025 accreditation;21 and (v) enhancing digitalization of government\u2019s services \nthrough an integrated agricultural data platform, multichannel extension services, and piloting of \na traceability system. The project will also support developing a strategic plan for agro-food safety \ntesting  laboratory  system  upgrading  and  operation  plans  as  a  condition  for  item  (iv);  and \n\n \n\n14 Beneficiary agro-enterprises have operations in, or source agro-products from, the six project provinces. However, \ngiven the growing need for access to finance after COVID-19, the geographic coverage and target AVCs may be \nexpanded, while support for agricultural cooperatives will be limited to the six project provinces. A majority of the \nbeneficiary agro-enterprises and agricultural cooperatives of output 1 are expected to be from project participating \nagro-enterprises and participating agricultural cooperatives. \n\n15 Sathapana Bank and the Agricultural and Rural Development Bank have been selected as PFIs for their substantial \nportfolio in agriculture and SME lending, and their interest and willingness to participate in the project. Other financial \ninstitutions may be added as PFIs during the project implementation as needed. \n\n16 Four types of AVC loans comprise: (i) farm production loans for contract growers, (ii) short- to medium-term business \nloans, (iii) inventory procurement loans, and (iv) long-term business loans. Details are in the Project Administration \nManual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n17 ADB will provide technical assistance to design the green financing mechanism. (ADB. 2018. Green and Innovative \nFinance Initiative for Scaling Up Southeast Asian Infrastructure. Manila [TA 9621-REG]). The ASEAN Infrastructure \nFund will provide financing to pilot the scheme under the proposed project. \n\n18 There  are  currently  240  registered  agricultural  cooperatives  and  several  unregistered  farmers  groups  in  the  six \nproject provinces. Of these, 230 will be selected and new ones to be added if needed as the PACs based on criteria \nincluding minimum years of operation and minimum proportion of female members. Details are provided in the Project \nAdministration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Of the 230 target PACs, 60 will \nspecialize in cashew, 100 in cassava, 10 in mangoes, and 60 in vegetable production. Poultry farmers are individuals. \n19 The IBP is a mutually beneficial business partnership between PACs (or farmers groups) and PAEs that source raw \nmaterials from the PACs. The roles and responsibilities of PAEs and PACs under an IBP are provided in the Project \nAdministration Manual. The IBPs are expected to improve PACs\u2019 access to finance by providing the PFIs assurance \nof the PACs\u2019 business viability, together with sales agreements and contract farming. \n\n20 Certificates include Cambodian Good Agricultural Practices (CamGAP), CamOrganic and Good Animal Husbandry \nPractices (GAHP) for PACs, and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points \n(HACCP) for PAEs. \n\n21 The laboratories the project will support include the National Agriculture Laboratory for pesticide residue analysis (for \nmangoes and vegetables), the Cambodia Laboratory of Agricultural Products and Foods for mycotoxin analysis (for \ncashew nuts), and the National Animal Health and Production Research Institute for antibiotics analysis (for meat). \n\n\fValue Added by ADB \n\ndeveloping a strategic plan for digitalization of MAFF services as a condition for item (v). \n \n12. \nOutput  3:  Agricultural  value  chain  connectivity  enhanced.  This  output  will  improve \nabout 110 kilometers of farm-to-market roads (FMRs) in the project areas.22 Laterite roads will be \nupgraded with double bituminous surface treatment. Climate change adaptation measures have \nbeen incorporated into the design of FMRs.23 Improved FMRs will enhance connectivity among \nvalue  chain  actors  of  the  CAPs  by  reducing  transport  time  and  cost,  increasing  the  volume  of \ntransportation, and reducing road maintenance costs. The project communities will be trained in \nroad  safety.  The  project  will  ensure  that there  is  sufficient  budget  to  operate  and  maintain the \nimproved FMRs.24 \n \nC. \n \n13. \nThe  project  will  complement  other  ADB  projects  to  promote  rural  development  and \nenhance  rural  income  opportunities.  They  include  (i)  the  Climate-Friendly  Agribusiness  Value \nChain Sector Project, which exemplified implementation arrangements for multisector projects; \n(ii) the Skills for Competitiveness Project, which covers skills development for agro-industry; and \n(iii) the Third Rural Roads Improvement Project, covering two of the project provinces.25 ADB also \ncoordinates  with  other  development  partners  in  the  agriculture,  natural  resources,  and  rural \ndevelopment  (ANR)  sector  in  Cambodia. 26  The  project  will  complement  ongoing  technical \nassistance  by  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  for  one  of  the  agro-product  safety \ntesting laboratories through financing equipment, works, and supplies to upgrade the facility. \n \n14. \nThe  project  has  also  incorporated  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  experience.  To  overcome  weak \ngovernment capacity and overlapping roles within and across government agencies, the proposed \nimplementation  arrangements  include  clear  delineation  of  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the \nexecuting and implementing agencies, a strong coordination mechanism, and substantive support \nfrom  the  project  management  and  implementation  units.  To  address  the  limited  private  sector \ninvestment  in  ANR  projects,  the  project  is  designed  to  facilitate  private  sector  engagement.27 \nGiven the importance of partnership with suitable financial institutions, the project has selected \nthe PFIs based on their strong agriculture and SME lending portfolio in Cambodia (footnote 15). \n \nThe  project  will  add  value  to  the  ANR  sector  in  Cambodia.  First,  the  project  will \n15. \ndemonstrate  an  approach  to  promoting  private  sector-driven  AVC  development.  Second,  the \nproject  will  introduce  three  mutually  reinforcing  financial  schemes  to  promote  financing  for \n\n \n\n22 While the Cambodian Road Law classifies such roads as rural roads, the term \u201cfarm-to-market road\u201d is used in this \n\ndocument to emphasize the nature of rural roads supported by the project. \n\n23 Funded by the Nordic Development Fund to incorporate climate change proofing to the road design and improve \nproject readiness, the detailed engineering designs have been completed for all six envisaged FMR subprojects. \n24 The project will follow the practices of ADB\u2019s rural roads improvement projects in Cambodia. Under the Second Rural \nRoads  Improvement  Project,  a  rural  roads  asset  management  system  and  asset  management  tools  are  being \ndeveloped and will be completed by the end of 2020.

The  findings  were  reflected  in  the  design  of  works, \nselection of consulting services and technologies, and areas for capacity building. Climate change \nmitigation  measures  will  include  the  promotion  of  water-  and  energy-saving  technology  and \noperations in on-farm production and processing, and good agricultural practices. Climate change \nadaptation measures for output 3 comprise (i) raising embankment levels to minimize increased \nseasonal flood risks, (ii) increasing the number of pipe culverts and box culverts to allow cross \ndrainage of flash floods, and (iii) concrete-surfacing to mitigate flood risks from the Mekong River. \n \nSafe  working  under  COVID-19  conditions.  Given  that  the  impact  of  COVID-19  is \n24. \nevolving, project implementation will be responsive and flexible in meeting emerging needs and \nnew  best  practices  in  construction  and  project  management.  The  executing  and  implementing \nagencies,  project  implementation  consultants,  and  contractors  will  incorporate  emerging \ninternational  construction  best  practice  for  managing  COVID-19  risk  in  works  and  will  follow \ngovernment guidance on working safely in COVID-19 conditions. \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fSustainability \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\nB. \n \n25. \nCost\u2013benefit analysis was used to assess the economic viability of investment in the five \nCAP value chains (para. 2) over 25 years. Most benefits were derived from (i) increased yields \nand  reduced  post-harvest  loss  from  the  use  of  the  quality  inputs  and  seeds,  training  on  good \nagricultural  practices,  and  improved  post-harvest  techniques;  and  (ii)  increased  volume  of \nprocessing because of the increased processing capacities. The economic internal rate of return \nis  20.63%.  Economic  viability  of  investment  in  the  FMRs  was  assessed  based  on  economic \nbenefits expected from the costs and time saved in operating different types of vehicles over 25 \nyears. The analysis confirmed the economic viability of the FMR investment with an economic \ninternal rate of return of 15.4%. Although it was not quantified, the improved FMRs will benefit the \ntargeted value chains because the FMRs selected are in the core areas of the value chains. \n \n26. \nFor  output  1,  capital  adequacy,  asset  quality,  management,  earnings,  liquidity,  and \nsensitivity analysis confirmed that both PFIs meet the eligibility requirements, have satisfactory \nfinancial  performance,  and  show  satisfactory  performance  prospects  based  on  their  projected \nfinancial position.31 \n \nC. \n \nIncremental recurrent  cost  analyses  were  conducted for  outputs  2  and  3  to  assess the \n27. \ngovernment\u2019s capacity to meet the additional O&M requirements. While increased revenues are \nexpected  from the  upgraded  laboratories, the MAFF  will  continue to  allocate  budget  to  ensure \nproper O&M of the laboratories. The project will also finance a 5-year service contract to ensure \nthe maintenance of equipment during project implementation. The project will support the MAFF \nin  developing  a  business  and  operational  plan  to  improve  the  sustainability  of  laboratory \noperations. For output 3, the analysis shows an expected budget shortfall of 20% in the overall \nO&M requirement of the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD). However, the MRD has already \ninitiated discussions with the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) to increase the budgetary \nallocation  for rural roads  and  is  developing  an  asset management  system  that  will  allow  more \nrational and cost-effective rural road network maintenance (footnote 24). \n \nD. \n \n28. \nFinancial management. ADB assessed the financial management of MAFF, MEF, and \nMRD.  The  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  substantial  mainly  due  to                \n(i) complex implementation arrangements, (ii) project staff\u2019s lack of experience in accounting and \nfinancial management, (iii) lack of information technology software and equipment, and (iv) weak \ninternal  audit.  The  mitigation  measures  include  (i)  engagement  of  financial  management \nconsultants, (ii) capacity building on financial management and internal audit for project staff, and \n(iii) use of information technology software. Financial due diligence on the two PFIs confirmed \ntheir systems and policies are adequate to manage the project credit lines. \n \n29. \nProcurement.  The  procurement  classification  for  the  project  is  assessed  as  low  risk. \nProcurement  of  goods  and  works  and  recruitment  of  consultants  will  be  undertaken  following \nADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations \n\nGovernance \n\n31 Financial Due Diligence Report for Agricultural and Rural Development Bank and Financial Due Diligence Report for \n\nSathapana Bank (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nfor  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  project  is  eligible  for  universal \nprocurement.32  \n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n30. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 29).  \n \nE. \n \nPoverty  and  social  development.  The  project  is  classified  general  intervention.33 The \n31. \ntargeted  direct  beneficiaries  are  230  PACs  (about  27,000  households)  and  about  50 \nagribusinesses in the project areas. The average poverty rate in the project areas is about 20%. \nOddar Meanchey Province has the highest poverty rate (28.9%) and Tboung Khmum Province \nhas the lowest (13.6%). The average size of household land holdings is less than 2 hectares and \nabout  13%  of  households  have  less  than  1  hectare.  Commune  registrations  show  that,  on \naverage, 13% of households in the project areas do not own any cultivated land. One IBP criterion \nis for the PAC to include at least 10% of its members from the poor and low-income households. \n \n32. \nGender and development. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. \nWomen comprise the majority of seasonal and permanent unskilled workers in mango, vegetable, \nand cashew processing; while male labor dominates poultry and cassava processing. While men \nand women do not have equal decision-making power over family income, assets, and economic \nactivities,  women  are  gaining  prominence  in  agricultural  cooperatives  and  hold  about  30%  of \nmanagement roles in potential PACs. The project promotes women\u2019s participation in PAEs, PACs, \nand as farmers by (i) developing and delivering outreach, education, and community activities to \nincrease the proportion of PAEs owned by women and female borrowers\u2019 access to subloans;     \n(ii) supporting women-led PACs in obtaining agro-product safety certificates; (iii) undertaking a \nneeds assessment and delivering training, including on gender sensitization, access to finance, \nimproved  planting  materials  and  breeds,  demonstration  farming,  and  leadership  skills;  and            \n(iv) delivering road safety training along the improved roads.34 Further, the project will support the \ntwo PFIs in developing inclusive and gender-responsive loan application criteria and guidelines \nto enable successful loan applications from women-owned PAEs and female borrowers. MAFF \nand PFIs will appoint gender focal points to implement and monitor the gender action plan. \n \nF. \n \n33. \ncategories are as follows.35 \n \n34. \nEnvironment (category B).

The  project  will  not  finance  activities  identified  under  outputs  1  and  2  that  are              \n(i)  classified  as  category  A  for  environment  or  category  A  or  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  or \nindigenous peoples, or (ii) against the prohibited investment activities list set out in Appendix 5 of \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \nThe  project  activities  under  outputs  1  and  2  are  small  in  scale  and  limited  to  the \n35. \nimprovement  of  agricultural  facilities.  Environmental  impacts  are  expected  to  be  minor  to \nmoderate and site-specific. The proposed paving and drainage improvements of the FMRs under \noutput  3  will  have  localized  impacts  during  construction,  including  increased  noise,  dust,  and \ntraffic,  and  there  may  be  an  increase  in  road  traffic  and  speed  during  operation.  All  identified \nimpacts  can  be mitigated  as  presented  in  the  environmental  management  plan.  The  project  is \nexpected  to  provide  some  environmental  benefits,  including  raising  farmers\u2019  awareness  of  the \nresponsible use of agricultural chemicals and climate-resilient farming practices, and improving \nlaboratory waste management, flood resilience, and community safety on project roads. \n \n36. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  is  not  expected  to  have  any \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts.38 For output 3, ADB conducted due diligence for the six FMR \nsubprojects  based  on  the  detailed  engineering  designs.  The  MRD  prepared  a  community \nparticipation framework with sufficient budget to guide impact screening and address any potential \nimpacts of the FMR subprojects during implementation.39 Social safeguard screening criteria are \nincluded  in  the  ESMS,  the  IBP  agreement  template,  and  the  PAM.  Meaningful  information \ndissemination and consultations were conducted with 1,146 people, including 526 women, in the \nsix project provinces and will continue throughout the project implementation. \n \n37. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  project  is  not  expected  to  directly  or  indirectly \naffect the dignity, human rights, livelihood systems, or culture of indigenous peoples, nor does it \naffect the territories or natural or cultural resources that indigenous peoples own, use, occupy, or \nclaim as their ancestral domain. \n \nThe  MAFF,  MEF,  and  MRD  have  experience  with  ADB  projects  and,  together  with  the \n38. \nPFIs,  showed  strong  commitment  to  safeguards  compliance  for  the  project.  The  project \nimplementation  consultants  will  support  all  relevant  agencies  to  ensure safeguard  compliance. \nConsultations  with  stakeholders  and  affected  persons  will  continue  during  implementation. \nProject-related  complaints  will  be  addressed  in  a  timely  manner  through  a  grievance  redress \nmechanism established at the project management unit. \n \nG. \n \n39. \ndetail in the risk assessment and management plan.40 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan  \n\n \n\n \n\n36 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 Due diligence section on the PFIs is provided in Environmental and Social Management System (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n38 Social  Safeguards  Due  Diligence  Report\u2014Output  2,  and  Social  Safeguards  Due  Diligence  Report\u2014Output  3 \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n39 Community Participation Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents on Appendix 2). \n40 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nRisks \nPrivate investment and business \nexpansion in agriculture slow down \nbecause of COVID-19 or other \nhindrances. \nThe government\u2019s budget allocation is \ninsufficient for operation and \nmaintenance of facilities and services \nfinanced by the project (e.g., farm-to-\nmarket roads and agro-product and \nfood testing laboratories). \nThe executing and implementing \nagencies\u2019 financial management is \nweak because of lack of capacity and \nequipment and complex project \narrangement. \n\nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \nThe  project  will  facilitate  business  development  and  market  expansion  of \nparticipating  agricultural  cooperatives  and  participating  agro-enterprises \nthrough  a  comprehensive  development  package  of  credit,  technical \nassistance, and related government infrastructure and services. \nThe  project  will  (i)  help  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry and  Fisheries \nprepare and adopt a strategic plan for upgrading its laboratory system; (ii) \nfinance  a  5-year  service  contract  for  the  maintenance  of  laboratory \nequipment; and (iii) use an asset management system to be developed by \nthe end of 2020 to ensure the cost-effective operation and maintenance of \nrural roads. \nThe  project  will  (i)  build  capacity  on  project  management,  financial \nmanagement, internal audit, and use of information systems; (ii) help adopt \ninformation  technology  equipment  to  support  project  implementation;  and \n(iii) engage consultants to support project implementation. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n40. \nThe government and MAFF have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB requirements, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, financial management, and disbursement \nas described in detail in the PAM and loan documents.
