I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nin the amount of $450 million, comprising (i) an A-loan of up to $150 million; and (ii) a B-loan of \nup to $300 million to be funded by participating financial institutions, to Ooredoo Myanmar \nLimited, for the Nationwide Telecommunications Project in Myanmar.1 The report also describes \nthe proposed technical assistance (TA), to be funded by the Canadian Climate Fund for the \nPrivate Sector in Asia under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and administered \nby  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  for  Renewable  Energy  for  the  Nationwide \nTelecommunications Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Universal  access  to  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  is  critical  in \nfostering  a  country\u2019s  socioeconomic growth  by  improving  business  opportunities  and  trade \nfacilitation; reducing urban\u2013rural and gender gaps; and enhancing the delivery of public services \nsuch as health, education, and security. After decades of isolation, Myanmar remains one of the \npoorest  and  least-connected  countries  in  Southeast  Asia.  The  lack  of  investment  in  ICT \ninfrastructure was apparent in the low penetration level of telecommunication services\u2014in 2013, \nonly 7 in 100 persons had access to a mobile phone, 0.5 in 100 had fixed-line telephone \naccess, and 0.7 in 100 had a broadband internet subscription. Due to lack of investment and \ncompetition, the cost of having a mobile connection was prohibitively expensive for the average \ncitizen, and coverage was biased toward larger cities even though the majority of the population \nlives in rural areas. A digital gender gap also exists in terms of basic access and usage of \nmobile phone and internet services. This disparity denies women the significant benefits and \nopportunities from participating in today\u2019s global information society. As part of its wide-ranging \nreforms, the Government of Myanmar has prioritized the availability, affordability, and quality of \nbasic ICT infrastructure throughout the country to support inclusive socioeconomic growth and \npoverty reduction. \n \n3.  With assistance from the World Bank Group, the government has undertaken significant \nICT  reforms  such  as  organizational  restructuring  of  the  incumbent  operator  and  regulator, \nintroduction of competition, and opening-up of the sector to foreign investment. In February \n2014, following one of the most competitive international tenders with over 90 applicants, the \ngovernment awarded a telecom operating and associated spectrum license to both Qatar\u2019s \nOoredoo Group and Norway\u2019s Telenor Group.2 The licenses were awarded based on several \nfactors such as the bidder\u2019s technical and financial capability of rolling out a telecom network \nacross the country under a tight time frame, and its commitment to offer affordable prices to the \npopulation. The ambitious targets under the licenses have been set to expand universal access \nto over 90% of the population, which will result in an estimated 35 million people in Myanmar \nconnecting through mobile services for the very first time. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Telenor Group is one of two international telecom operators in Myanmar.   ", "2 \n \n4.  ADB and the International Finance Corporation identified the opportunity to help fund the \nsubstantial ICT infrastructure costs required to build Ooredoo\u2019s nationwide telecom network. \nMultilateral support is needed given the capital-intensive nature of building a greenfield telecom \nnetwork and the lack of international banks willing to lend into Myanmar at this time. Through \nthe B loan program, ADB will also lead in catalyzing commercial cofinancing during Ooredoo\u2019s \nrollout phase.  \n \n2.  Project Design \n5.  The  project  consists  of  rolling  out  an  advanced  third-generation 3  mobile \ntelecommunication network across the country. The rollout has already begun in several major \ncities and townships, and Ooredoo officially launched its services in August 2014 as the first \ninternational operator to begin commercial operations. With the third generation, Myanmar will \nleapfrog several generations of mobile technology by ensuring greater speed and capacity for \ndata  transfer  and  thus  enabling  mobile  broadband  internet,  e-mail,  and  enriched  mobile \napplications in addition to conventional voice and text services. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIn addition, Ooredoo will also develop several mobile applications for banking, agriculture, and \nhealth, which will enhance access to basic services for the people of Myanmar. The project will \nbe developed under a 15-year operating and associated spectrum license on a build\u2013own\u2013\noperate basis that authorizes Ooredoo to provide a full range of fixed and mobile telecom \nservices nationwide. To supplement the nationwide network rollout, ADB has also designed a \nTA project to help the borrower and other industry stakeholders reduce reliance on diesel \ngeneration by adopting renewable energy technologies for telecom towers and thereby avoid \ncarbon emissions. \n \n3.  [Ooredoo QSC] and Borrower \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nThe Ooredoo Group is a leading international communications company delivering mobile, \nfixed, and broadband internet services to a customer base of more than 107 million people \nacross 15 countries in Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa.4 The shares of [Ooredoo QSC] \nare listed on the Qatar Exchange and the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, and the [Ooredoo \nQSC] was named Best Mobile Operator of the Year at the World Communication Awards in \n2013. \n \n7.  [Ooredoo QSC] has distinguished itself from other global telecom operators through its \ncommitment to reducing the digital gender divide across its global operations. It is a partner of \nthe World Economic Forum\u2019s Gender Parity Programme, a member of the Groupe Sp\u00e9ciale \nMobile Association\u2019s5 Connected Women Programme, and works closely with the Cherie Blair \nFoundation for Women. In addition, the company\u2019s chairman is a member of the World Bank \nGroup  Advisory  Council  on  Gender  and  Development,  a  major  global  body  dedicated  to \npromoting gender equality around the world. \n                                                \n3  Better known as 3G \n4  Ooredoo Group has a presence in markets such as Algeria, Indonesia, Iraq, Kuwait, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, the Maldives, Oman, Palestine, the Philippines, Qatar, and Tunisia. \n5  Better known as GSMA ", "3 \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n9.  Impact. The impact of the project will increase access to quality telecommunication \nservices, and develop the required ICT infrastructure in Myanmar that will facilitate inclusive \ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  project  will  specifically  advance  inclusive  sustainable \ndevelopment  by  promoting  the  use  of  ICT  in  support  of  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s \nempowerment. In today\u2019s global information society, women are coming online later and more \nslowly than men, and are therefore missing out on the substantial new digital opportunities \narising from mobile and internet access. ICT gender gaps go beyond basic access. Women are \ngiven fewer opportunities for ICT skills training, are offered proportionally less-senior and lower-\npaying ICT jobs and fewer business opportunities, and online gender content is lacking. The \nproject  aims  to  reduce  the  gender  gap  by  increasing  basic  access,  promotion,  training, \nemployment, health services, and greater online content for women (footnote 1).6 \n \n10.  Outcome. The project's outcome is provision of affordable mobile telecommunication \nservices improved and gender inclusiveness increased, with targets set for women\u2019s access, \nemployment, and business opportunities. \n \n11.  Outputs.  The  project\u2019s  outputs  involve  (i)  third-generation,  nationwide, \ntelecommunications network extended; (ii) developing and making available to end users mobile \napplications  for  health  (including  maternal),  banking,  and  agriculture  services;  and \n(iii) supporting and delivering conferences and an ICT community group that reduce the digital \ngender gap. \n \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n12.  Consistency with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020. ADB\u2019s assistance for the project is aligned \nwith its Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which identifies infrastructure as one of the five core \nareas to improve and maximize development impact.7 Under the Midterm Review of Strategy \n2020, ADB\u2019s infrastructure operations also emphasize private sector engagement, investment in \ncommunication connectivity, and inclusive growth especially for rural areas.  \n \n13.  Consistency with the country strategy. The assistance is aligned with ADB\u2019s interim \ncountry partnership strategy, 2012\u20132014,8 which has been extended to 2016.9 The project \nenhances connectivity and improves access to markets and basic services. It promotes private \nsector development, creates opportunities and jobs, improves rural livelihoods, and will boost \ndomestic and cross-border trade and investment. \n \nD.

Table 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements.10 \n \nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  With assistance from the World Bank Group, the Post and \nTelecommunications Department, under the Ministry of Communications and \nInformation Technology, will transition into an independent regulator called the \nMyanmar Telecommunications Commission by the end of 2015. A new \nTelecommunication Law was passed in October 2013 and fulfills the basic \nelements of a liberalized telecommunications regulatory framework set out by \nthe World Trade Organization. The state-owned telecom operator, Myanmar \nPost and Telecommunications, will be restructured into a commercial entity \nand privatized. The project will be developed under an initial 15-year operating \nand associated spectrum license on a build\u2013own\u2013operate basis. \nManagement  The project will be managed by Ooredoo Group, a leading international \ntelecommunications company that delivers mobile, fixed, and broadband \ninternet services to a customer base of 107 million across 15 countries in Asia, \nthe Middle East, and North Africa. \nImplementation period  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nNetwork rollout  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nEnergy supply  Poor electricity supply and transmission infrastructure is a huge challenge for \na telecom network that needs to operate 24 hours a day throughout the year. \nThe country has an electrification rate of less than 30%, one of the lowest in \nAsia, and in rural areas only 16% of the population has access to the electrical \ngrid. Telecom operators heavily depend on diesel generators at their tower \nsites for running core network equipment. This exposes them to fuel price \nvolatility and logistical transport issues, and causes greenhouse gas \nemissions. To mitigate the risk and associated emissions, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank is proposing technical assistance to help the borrower and \nother industry stakeholders reduce reliance on diesel generation by adopting \nrenewable energy technologies.  \nRevenue structure  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nPerformance monitoring  The borrower will report key performance indicators, including output and \noutcome indicators. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Ooredoo Myanmar Limited. \n \nF.

The  assistance  will \nprovide tangible transfer of technology, knowledge, and skills to Myanmar and help the country \novercome cost hurdles and risks associated with deploying renewable energy technologies.  \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n20.  The presence of strong international private sector companies such as Ooredoo in the \ntelecommunications sector will have a transformational impact because it will ensure sound \ndevelopment of the sector, provide significant opportunities in associated areas and sectors \n(e.g., finance and energy), and be an important driver for continued reform in support of the \nfundamental socioeconomic transformation the country is undertaking. \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  support  the  government\u2019s  reforms  and  the  country\u2019s  overall \ntransformation to a more liberalized economy by providing financial support to one of the first \nprivate  telecom  operators  in  the  country.  Multilateral  support  is  needed  given  the  capital-\nintensive nature of building a greenfield telecom network and the lack of international banks \nwilling to lend into Myanmar at this time. \n \n22.  ADB will provide a perspective on many issues and challenges associated with building \na network in Myanmar, e.g., weak environmental and social regulation, lack of physical transport \ninfrastructure,  shortage  of  electricity  supply  and  transmission,  and  insufficient  skills  and \ninstitutional capacity. \n \n23.  Through its B loan product, ADB\u2019s assistance will help catalyze international commercial \nbank financing for the network rollout that otherwise would not be available due to the perceived \npolitical risks and limitations of investing in Myanmar. \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s  TA  will  help  build  the  capacity  of  private  and  public  sector  stakeholders  to \nimplement green power solutions for telecom towers in rural Myanmar, helping overcome one of \nthe major barriers to the network rollout while avoiding significant greenhouse gas emissions. \n \nC.  Risks \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nD.  Technical Assistance \n \n31.  Currently, telecom operators depend heavily on diesel generators at most telecom tower \nsites in Myanmar for running core network equipment. These diesel generators consume an \nestimated 25 million liters of diesel annually, and this is expected to increase to 116 million liters \nby 2017, which represents over 300,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions.11 The Capacity \nDevelopment TA for renewable energy associated with the proposed project will tackle this \nissue by helping build the capacity of private and public sector stakeholders to adopt renewable \nenergy solutions at tower sites to ensure the long-term sustainability of the industry. The TA is a \njoint effort of PSOD and SDCC and will be financed on a grant basis of up to $1 million by the \nCanadian  Climate  Fund  for  the  Private  Sector  in  Asia  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing \n                                                \n11 Groupe Sp\u00e9ciale Mobile Association. 2014.

The commercial feasibility of renewable energy \nfor telecom towers will be demonstrated through several pilot projects utilizing different types of \nrenewable technology in different regions of the country. One of the pilots will be a community \naccess project that capitalizes on a unique rural electrification opportunity to provide clean \nenergy to a remote village by using excess power from a telecom tower.12 The TA will transfer \nskills  and  build  capacity  through  the  development  of  pilot  project  case  studies,  training \nworkshops, and knowledge products. The overall objective of the TA is to deploy renewable \nenergy solutions to at least 1,500 rural sites in Myanmar to reduce diesel-burning generation \nand avoid 10,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.13 The TA will be implemented \nbetween June 2015 and December 2016.  \n \nIV.
