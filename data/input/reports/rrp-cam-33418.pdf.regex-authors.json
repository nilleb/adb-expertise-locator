The Convention on Biological Diversity, 1992 defines biological diversity \nas the variability among living organisms from all sources including, among others, terrestrial, \nmarine, and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; the \nterm includes diversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems. \n       \nBiosphere reserves. Areas of terrestrial and coastal or marine ecosystems, or a combination \nthereof, that are recognized internationally within the framework of the Man and the Biosphere \nProgramme of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). \nBiosphere reserves are nominated by national governments and remain under their jurisdiction. \nThe reserves must meet a minimal set of criteria and adhere to a minimal set of conditions \nbefore being admitted to UNESCO's World Network of Biosphere Reserves. Each reserve is \nintended  to  fulfill  three  complementary  functions:  (i)  a  conservation  function  (preserve \nlandscapes, ecosystems, species, and genetic variation); (ii) a development function (foster \nsustainable  economic  and  human  development);  and  (iii)  a  logistic  function  (support \ndemonstration projects, environmental education and training, and research and monitoring \nrelated to local, national, and global issues of conservation and sustainable development). \nBiosphere reserves contain one or more core areas, which are securely protected sites; a \nclearly identified buffer zone; and a flexible transition area. \n \nUNESCO. 2002. The MAB Programme. \nAvailable: http://www.unesco.org/mab/ \n       \nBuffer zone. A zone that usually surrounds or adjoins core areas, and is used for cooperative \nactivities  compatible  with  sound  ecological  practices,  including  environmental  education, \nrecreation, ecotourism, and applied and basic research. In the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve \n(TSBR), the buffer zone\u2014an area of about 540,000 hectares (ha)\u2014surrounds the core areas up \nto the outer limit of the flooded forest. \n       \nCommunity  management. The community-based management of local natural resources, \nincluding certain designated fishing areas, with support from relevant authorities, and institutions \nand organizations. \n       \nCore areas. Securely protected sites for conserving biodiversity, monitoring minimally disturbed \necosystems, and undertaking nondestructive research and other low-impact uses such as \neducation. In the TSBR, the core areas are located in Prek Toal (21,342 ha), Battambang; \nBoeng Tonle Chhmar (Moat Kla) (14,560 ha), Kompong Thom; and Stung Sen (6,355 ha). The \ncore areas are characterized by a preserved flooded forest, rich river systems, and biodiversity. \nNearly  100  water  bird  species  are  found  there,  a  dozen  of  which  are  of  international \nsignificance. In addition to fish stocks, the areas are known for species such as crocodiles, \nturtles, macaques, capped langurs, otters, and water snakes. \n ", "       \nFishing gear. Any equipment used for fishing. The Department of Fisheries in the Ministry of \nAgriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries describes over 200 different techniques and gear in use on \nthe Tonle Sap and ranging from large-scale gear such as barrage traps and bag nets; middle-\nscale gear such as arrow-shaped traps, drift seine nets, rafted mounted lift nets, and scooping \nnets; to family-scale gear such as gill nets, small traps, single longlines, small dip nets, and cast \nnets. Almost all are developed locally. \n       \nFishing  lots.  Fishing  lots  are  exclusive  geographic  areas  that  are  awarded  through  a \ncompetitive, public bidding system for a period of 2 consecutive years, with the auction fee \npayable for each of the two fishing seasons. In 2000, there were 175 fishing lots throughout \nCambodia. They range in size from 2,000 ha to 50,000 ha and may include lake areas, river \nareas, and flooded forest. The largest are found on the Tonle Sap. The operator of each lot has \nthe right to harvest fish according to the burden book for the lot. The burden book describes the \nopen  season,  the  payment  schedule,  permissible  fishing  gears,  the  boundaries,  the  main \ngeographic features, and the designated public fishing areas. Over half of the fishing lot area \nwas withdrawn from the system recently and designated for community-based management. \n       \nFish sanctuaries. Eight fish sanctuaries have been established on the Tonle Sap. They are set \naside to protect fish stocks, improve fish recruitment, and provide dry season refuge areas for \nnonmigratory fish. Year-round, fishing activities, including small-scale fishing, are  prohibited \nalthough fishing for scientific purposes is allowed. Seven of the sanctuaries are inside the \npermanent lake, and one is near the mouth of the Tonle Sap River. Most of the sanctuaries are \nfound in the deeper parts of the lake, and none is in the flooded forest. \n       \nFlooded forest. A descriptive term for the particular natural vegetation that originally covered \nmost of the Tonle Sap floodplain. It is now characterized by low forest and shrubs that still \naccount for the productivity of the Tonle Sap. \n       \nSeasonal inundation. Flooding that can be as low as 8 meters (m) above mean sea level \n(amsl) or as high as 12 m amsl. \n       \nTransition area. An area in which existing stakeholders work together in a variety of economic \nand other activities to manage and develop sustainably a biosphere reserve's natural resources. \nIn the TSBR, the transition area of about 900,000 ha lies between the outer boundary of the \nbuffer zone and Highways No. 5 and No. 6.  \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.

The summary \nIEE is a supplementary appendix. \n   \nProject  In  the  last  20  years,  transactions  involving  the  Tonle  Sap's  natural \nDescription  resources, especially its fisheries, have been characterized by inequity, \nfraud,  widespread  corruption,  environmental  degradation  from \nunsustainable patterns of exploitation, and escalating conflict. The Project \nwill  enhance  systems  and  develop  the  capacity  for  natural  resource \nmanagement coordination and planning, community-based management \nof natural resources, and conservation of biodiversity in the Tonle Sap \nBiosphere Reserve (TSBR). Without those improvements, investments in \nthe Tonle Sap region will become progressively less productive. \n   \nRationale  The Tonle Sap is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia and has \ndefined Cambodia's national identity. Fish from the Tonle Sap provide \n40\u201370% of the protein intake of Cambodia's population. The lake is of \nglobal significance and was nominated as a biosphere reserve in October \n1997 under the Man and the Biosphere Program of the United Nations \nEducational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization.  Yet,  the  natural \nresources of the Tonle Sap are a source of conflict among stakeholders. \nInequality of access rights, growing population pressure, severe poverty, \ninsufficient  or  nonexistent  rights  of  tenure,  and  cultural  and  ethnic \ndifferences place the lake's ecosystem and the population that depends \non it at risk. The 25 years of strife brought about by the Khmer Rouge \nhave  diminished  the  ability  to  tackle  these  issues  at  all  levels  of \nCambodian  society.  In  recent  years,  many  have  become  increasingly \nconcerned that development and unsustainable exploitation of the Tonle \nSap's natural richness, especially clearing of the flooded forest for cash \ncropping  and  illegal  fishing,  threaten  the  Tonle  Sap.  King  Norodom \nSihanouk has warned that Cambodia faces environmental disaster if the \nfragile ecosystem of the lake is further degraded. Management of the \nTSBR is a great challenge for the Government. Analysis of problems and \nopportunities reveals that: (i) natural resource management coordination \nand planning for the TSBR is weak; (ii) communities, which have been \ndesignated  as  key  players,  are  not  organized  for  natural  resource \nmanagement in the TSBR; and (iii) management capacity to conserve \nbiodiversity in the TSBR is inadequate. \n   \nObjective  The goal of the Project is sustainable management and conservation of \nnatural resources and biodiversity in the Tonle Sap basin. The objective is \nto  enhance  systems  and  develop  the  capacity  for  natural  resource \nmanagement  coordination  and  planning,  community-based  natural \nresource management, and biodiversity conservation in the TSBR. \n ", "iv \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  project  cost,  including  contingencies,  taxes,  and  duties,  is \nestimated at $19.4 million equivalent, consisting of a foreign exchange of \n$8.8 million (about 45%) and local currency of $10.6 million equivalent \n(about 55%). \n   \nFinancing Plan  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a loan of $10.9 million \nequivalent from its Special Funds resources to finance about 56% of the \nproject cost. A Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant in the amount of \nabout $3.9 million was formulated with the proposed loan. In addition, the \nUnited  Nations  Development  Programme\u2019s  (UNDP\u2019s)  Capacity  21 \nprogram will provide about $623,000 as a grant. The Government will \nfinance about $3.9 million equivalent in local currency. \n   \nLoan Amount and  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of various currencies equivalent to \nTerms  $10.9 million from its Special Funds resources. The loan will have a term \nof 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n   \nPeriod of  Until 30 June 2008 \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2007 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The overall project implementation period is 5 years. A project steering \nArrangements  committee has been established to advise on implementation, provide a \nmechanism for resolving implementation problems that go beyond single \nministerial  mandates,  and  review  progress.  A  project  monitoring  and \ncoordination  office  has  been  formed  in  the  TSBR  Secretariat  in  the \nCambodia National Mekong Committee. Project implementation offices \nhave  been  set  up  in  the  Department  of  Fisheries  in  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries; the Ministry of Environment; and the \nTSBR Secretariat. UNDP's office in Phnom Penh will implement the GEF \nand Capacity 21 grants. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries \n   \nProcurement  Goods and related services, and civil works to be financed from the loan \nproceeds  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines for \nProcurement.  Vehicles,  equipment,  and  material  will  be  procured  by \ninternational competitive bidding where the cost is more than $500,000, \nor by international shopping where the cost is from $100,000 to $500,000. \nVehicles,  equipment,  and  material  valued  at  less  than  $100,000 \nequivalent  may  be  procured  under  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB) \nprocedures. Minor items estimated to cost less than $50,000 may be \npurchased directly. Civil works to be financed from the proceeds are small \nand scattered and may be procured under LCB procedures. \n   \n   \n   \n   ", "v \nConsulting  International and domestic consultants will support project implementation \nServices  and capacity building. The consultants financed by ADB will be recruited \nthrough a consulting firm in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic  consultants.  The  Project  will  also  contract  out  services  to \ninternational  organizations,  international  and  domestic  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), and other local institutions. To the extent possible, \nprocurement will be on the basis of competitive procedures. But where \nthe number of service providers is limited, direct selection will be applied, \nwith the prior approval of ADB. Where direct selection does not apply, \nconsultants will be recruited using ADB's quality and cost-based selection \nmethod. \n   \nProject Benefits  Project benefits will stem from improved coordination and planning for \nand Beneficiaries  natural resource management, organization of communities for natural \nresource  management,  and  conservation  of  biodiversity.  Project \nbeneficiaries are members of the communities that will be targeted in the \nfive  provinces  adjoining  the  Tonle  Sap\u2014Battambang,  Kompong \nChhnang, Kompong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap. Because of the social \ndislocation  that  Cambodia  has  suffered,  working  cooperatively  is  not \neasy. By promoting the cohesion of communities, the Project will raise \ntheir efficiency and ability to capture investment and enhance the benefits \nthat they derive from fisheries by improving management, protecting core \nareas, and reducing the decline of more valuable species in the medium \nterm.  Clarification  of  natural  resource use rights will also reduce the \nconflicts affecting these communities. Other project beneficiaries are the \nnational, provincial, district, and field staff, as well as NGOs, who will \nreceive a significant amount of interdisciplinary and on-the-job training \nthat cuts across professional and social boundaries, including gender. At \nthe global level, mankind will benefit from the conservation of globally \nsignificant biodiversity, as will all Cambodians who depend on fish for \nprotein. \n   \nRisks and  Risks that can be mitigated under the Project pertain to the regulatory \nAssumptions  framework  for  inland  fisheries,  project  coverage,  sectoral  interests, \ncommunity self-regulation, and manpower availability and supervision. \nThe principal assumptions are a strong Government sense of ownership \nof and commitment to the Project and the desire of the communities to \nself-regulate. \n   \nTechnical  ADB will provide a technical assistance (TA) grant in the amount of \nAssistance  $540,000 for Improving the Regulatory and Management Framework for \nInland Fisheries. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. \n ", "v\ni\n \n   ", "     \nv\nii\n \n ", "v\niii\n \n   ", "     \nix\n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Tonle Sap Environmental Management Project (Appendix \n1).1 The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Improving the Regulatory \nand Management Framework for Inland Fisheries, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, \nI, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  The Tonle Sap \n2.  The Tonle Sap or Great Lake of Cambodia is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast \nAsia, covering an area of 250,000\u2013300,000 hectares (ha) during the dry season. Owing to a \nunique hydrological phenomenon, the Tonle Sap River draining the lake reverses its flow during \nthe wet season when the waters of the Mekong River flow into the lake to inundate 1.0\u20131.6 \nmillion ha for several months each year.2 The extensive wetlands born of this cycle are home to \na high biodiversity of fish, reptile, bird, mammal, and plant species.3 This biological richness is \nreflected in the enormous productivity of the Tonle Sap as a fishing area: the lake supports one \nof the most productive capture fisheries in the world,4 and provides 40\u201370% of the protein intake \nof Cambodia's population.5 The fisheries, together with the flooded forest and agricultural lands \nof the inundated area, have underpinned human activity since ancient times. Indeed, the Tonle \nSap and the associated cultural heritage of Angkor have defined Cambodia's national identity.6 \nToday, the land, water, and biotic resources of the Tonle Sap directly benefit 11% of the \nCambodian population and, indirectly, many more in terms of food security.7 The lake also \nbenefits the lower Mekong Basin as  a feeding and spawning area for both migratory and \nnonmigratory fish. It is of global significance for biodiversity conservation (Appendix 2). \n \n3.  Because of its biodiversity, economic, and cultural values, the Tonle Sap is a source of \nconflict,  at  times  violent.  Inequality  of  access  rights,  growing  population  pressure,  severe \npoverty, insufficient or nonexistent rights to land tenure, and ethnic differences place the lake's \necosystem and the population that depends on it at risk. Unfortunately, 25 years of strife \nbrought about by the Khmer Rouge have diminished at all levels of Cambodian society the \nability to tackle these issues. In recent years, concern over the Tonle Sap has grown; King \n                                                 \n1  The Project is included in the Country Strategy and Program, 2003\u20132005 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfor Cambodia (Appendix 2). \n2  Consequently, the water level of the lake varies from 1\u20132 meters (m) above mean sea level (amsl) during the dry \nseason to 8\u201311 m amsl during the wet season. \n3  Many fish species migrate between the Mekong River and the Tonle Sap, utilizing the river for spawning and the \nflooded forest for growth and maturation. \n4  The Tonle Sap yields about 230,000 tons (t) of fish per annum, valued at $150 million\u2013$200 million (based on \nlanding data), of which about 25% is exported, primarily to Thailand. The monetary value of the catch increases \nthrough the marketing chain to $250 million\u2013$500 million. Cambodia\u2019s freshwater capture fisheries production of \nover 400,000 t per year is the fourth largest in the world after the People's Republic of China (PRC), India, and \nBangladesh. Some believe this to be an underestimate: in 2000, the National Institute of Statistics estimated \nproduction at 442,000 t. Freshwater capture fisheries contribute 5\u201310% of Cambodia's gross domestic product. \n5  Nationwide fish consumption ranges from 40 to 70 kilograms (kg) per person per year. It is widely believed that the \nTonle Sap provides two thirds of fish consumed in Cambodia. \n6  It is on the northwestern shore of the Tonle Sap that Khmer kings built their capital from the 9th to the 13th century. \n7  Cambodia's population numbers about 11.5 million. The population living in the five provinces surrounding the \nTonle Sap numbers about 2.9 million. \n ", "2\nNorodom Sihanouk has warned that Cambodia faces environmental disaster if the fragile \necosystem of the lake is degraded further. \n \n4.  In recognition of the lake's importance, a Royal Decree designated the Tonle Sap as a \nMultiple-Use Protected Area in November 1993. Furthermore, the lake was nominated as  a \nBiosphere Reserve in October 1997 under the Man and the Biosphere Program of the United \nNations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), when it joined other \nnatural wonders of the world holding that status.8 But management of the Tonle Sap Biosphere \nReserve (TSBR) is a great challenge for the Government.9 At least, it needs to improve the \nregulatory and management framework for inland fisheries, build consensus and capacity for \nintegrated environmental management in line agencies, organize and empower communities to \nmanage natural resources, and develop the capability for biodiversity conservation.10 \n \n2.  Natural Resource Management Coordination and Planning \n5.  The  principal  policy  instruments  for  natural  resource  management  are  the National \nEnvironmental  Action  Plan,  1998\u20132003;11  Governance  Action  Plan,  2001;  Second \nSocioeconomic Development Plan, 2001\u20132005 (prepared  ADB assistance);12 and the draft \nNational Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan. Other relevant legislation includes the Law on \nEnvironmental  Protection  and  Natural  Resource  Management,  the  Fiat  Law  on  Fisheries \nManagement  and  Administration  that  is  being  revised,  and  the  Royal  Decree  on  the \nEstablishment  and  Management  of  the  Tonle  Sap  Biosphere  Reserve  of  April  2001. \nNevertheless, these instruments have not brought about sound management of the Tonle Sap. \nThere are no integrated policies at the national level and no systems or capacity for their \ndevelopment. The Government's recent achievements in decentralization also need support. \n \n6.  The  primary  interagency  institution  is  the  Cambodia  National  Mekong  Committee \n(CNMC),  with  a  membership  of  10  ministries  and  a  linkage  with  the  Mekong  River \nCommission.13  In  response  to  the  growing  need  for  coordination  and  planning,  a  TSBR \nSecretariat was established in CNMC by subdecree in September 2001.14 Establishment in \nCNMC affirms the TSBR Secretariat's legitimacy as the coordinating body for the Tonle Sap \nand, thereby, its influence in all sectors of Government. The primary Government agencies \nresponsible for managing natural resources in the TSBR are the Department of Fisheries (DOF) \n                                                 \n8  These numbered 408 in May 2002. \n9  The Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve (TSBR) aims to fulfill three complementary functions. They are: (i) conservation \nof landscapes, ecosystems, and species diversity; (ii) culturally, socially, and ecologically sustainable development; \nand (iii) research, monitoring, and education. Management of the TSBR should be based on zoning into core \nareas, a buffer zone, and a transition area. \n10 Cambodia's obligations vis-\u00e0-vis the Tonle Sap are embodied in more than 10 treaties and conventions, including \nthe Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat (the Ramsar Convention), \n1971; the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), 1979; and \nthe Convention on Biological Diversity, 1992. One of the core areas of the TSBR, Boeng Tonle Chhmar, was \ndesignated as one of the country's three Ramsar sites in 1999. \n11 The Tonle Sap is flagged as a priority in the National Environmental Action Plan, 1998\u20132002. \n12 The National Assembly passed the Second Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2001\u20132005 on 17 June 2002. The \nSenate approved it on 8 July 2002. \n13 CNMC's role is to advise the Government on all matters related to the formulation of water policy, strategy, \nmanagement, preservation, investigation, planning, and restoration and the development of the water and other \nnatural resources of the Mekong River Basin within Cambodia. \n14 The Subdecree on the Establishment, Role, and Functions of the Secretariat of the TSBR of September 2001 \nstructured the TSBR Secretariat into three divisions for policy, strategy, and networking; research, monitoring, and \ndata management; and administration and training. The TSBR Secretariat's staff numbers 6 out of a total planned \ncomplement of 15. \n   ", "      3 \nin the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF), and the Ministry of Environment \n(MOE). However, their policies are uncoordinated and broad in focus. For example, the draft \nFisheries Law (prepared with assistance from the World Bank) provides long-term goals for \nmanaging fisheries in the Tonle Sap but it remains to be completed. Associated legislation, \ncomplemented and influenced by a fisheries management framework, is essential. \n \n3.  Community and Lot Fisheries \n7.  On the Tonle Sap, fishing is carried out for commercial and subsistence purposes. \nCommercial fisheries have been organized under a system of exclusive spatial and temporal \nuse  rights  of  auctioned  (large-scale)  lots.15  However,  the  system  focuses  on  revenue \ngeneration, instead of sustainable resource extraction and equitable rural development, and has \nexacerbated  conflict  in  proportion  with  increasing  population  pressures16  and  economic \ndemands.17 What is more, managing the fishing lot system has always been difficult because of \nthe  opacity  of  the  auction  system  and  the  unrestricted  power  of  fishing  lot  operators.  In \nresponse, in October 2000, a Prime Ministerial decree released 56% (or 500,000 ha) of the \nformer fishing lot area to communities for management.18 There are now more than 160 \ndesignated community fisheries (or 300 management units) in the fishing lot area released from \ncommercial fisheries. (The identification of areas for community management has resulted in \nmany cases in the less productive grounds being released.) Community-based management of \nfisheries resources is bound to play an essential role in better sector performance.19 But policy \nreform  is  no  guarantee  of  better  management  without  accompanying  improvements  in \ntransparency, information, and implementation. The fishing lots were released to communities \nwithout regulatory or management structure, funding, or training to support the establishment of \ncommunity fisheries in these areas. The lots have become, de facto, open access areas. The \nresults  are  confusion  over  access  rights,  alleged  uncontrolled  exploitation,  rampant \nirresponsible fishing, and further conflict. \n \n8.  On the Tonle Sap, fishers inhabit floating villages (which move with changing water \nlevels) or raised houses in resident communities along the lakeshore.20 Outside the inundated \narea, in the five provinces adjoining the Tonle Sap, livelihood systems are based on low-yield, \nrain-fed paddy production in the wet season. At this level of subsistence, communities are \ndriven to supplement livelihoods with firewood collection or illegal dry season crop production. \nAs a result, the flooded forest that provides the basis for the Tonle Sap's productive fisheries is \ndisappearing in the face of short-term, low-productivity, and low-value activities. \n \n                                                 \n15 The lots, which until recently numbered 57 and occupied about 940,000 ha of the most productive fishing areas \n(including those on the Tonle Sap River), are based on auctions of the resource in a defined area every 2 years. \n16 Cambodia has a fast-growing population (4% per annum during 1994\u20131998) of which 54% are under the age of 20. \n17 Even so, the Government should benefit from the vast potential rent to be derived from the fishing lots. However, in \n2000, DOF collected less than $3 million in concession fees. \n18 In conjunction with local authorities, they are to manage, conserve, and use the fisheries sustainably. \n19 The benefits of community-based management follow: (i) fishers cooperate in planning to increase or conserve fish \nstocks; (ii) fishers share the costs and benefits of improved management; (iii) there is better conflict management; \n(iv) the position of fishers vis-\u00e0-vis other stakeholders is enhanced by their being organized; (v) fishers and the \nGovernment are willing to share data on and their understanding of the fisheries resources; (vi) fishers are \nencouraged to adopt a longer perspective; and (vii) enforcement of rules is more effective since they have a high \nlevel of acceptance: accordingly, compliance and self-regulation are high. \n20 Together, they make up 25% of the 1.2 million people living in the area bounded by Highways No. 5 and No. 6. It is \nnot possible to distinguish between fishers and farmers. Most people are engaged in both activities. \n ", "4\n4.  Poverty and the Tonle Sap \n9.  Five  provinces  adjoin  the  Tonle  Sap.  They  are  Battambang,  Kompong  Chhnang, \nKompong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap. Despite the vast natural wealth of the  Tonle Sap, \npoverty is widespread: about 38% of the population living in the five provinces fall under the \nofficial poverty line, the highest proportion in the country.21 Around 50% of the villages have 40\u2013\n60% of households living below the poverty line, with a peak of 80% in some rural areas of Siem \nReap and Kompong Chhnang. Poverty is related to extended instability and conflict, and the \nresultant harm to the population; most of Cambodia experienced more peace and economic \ngrowth after 1993, but only since 1998 have areas northwest of the Tonle Sap enjoyed their first \nreal respite from war. Many internally displaced persons, repatriated refugees, internal migrants, \nand demobilized soldiers are busy reestablishing their livelihoods in what remains a fractured \nsociety.22 \n \n10.  The inhabitants of the Tonle Sap region receive little schooling. Statistics report an adult \nliteracy rate of about 46% (a figure considered to be inflated as it includes the partially literate), \ncompared with the national average of 63%. The school attendance of children aged 5\u201314 years \nis only 63%, compared with the national average of 67%. Lack of education limits the ability to \nrecognize and take opportunities. Low literacy levels, lack of access to environmental education \nmaterials (such as posters and books), and dearth of basic information (such as copies of laws, \nsubdecrees, proclamations, and directives or circulars) are not propitious to decision making for \nnatural resource management. \n \n11.  Women constitute about 51% of the population in the Tonle Sap region. Significantly, \nthey also head about 15\u201330% of households. Female heads of households must both earn \nincome  and  look  after  young  families.  They  have  few  opportunities  for  participating  in \ncommunity  decision  making  since  Khmer  tradition  ascribes  a  passive  role  to  women. \nNevertheless,  the  gender  division  of  labor  is  changing  overall:  women  and  men  play \nprogressively interchangeable roles because women are increasingly called upon to meet \nhousehold needs. In the floating villages, they construct fishing gear and process and sell fish. \nIn land-based villages, they are actively involved in rice and vegetable production, trading, and \nforest-based activities (including firewood collection), and also in fish processing and sale. In the \nlatter villages, there is nonetheless a growing trend toward landlessness for households with \nfemale  heads  because  of  lack  of  capital  and  sudden  shocks,  including  health  problems. \nNonparticipation in community decision making, scarce opportunities for self-development, and \ninadequate access to financial services keep the women poor. \n \n12.  The ethnic minorities of the Tonle Sap region are the Vietnamese and Muslim Cham. \nEven  though  most  of  the  Vietnamese  were  born  in  Cambodia,  they  do  not  have  Khmer \nnationality and are classified as immigrants. This status and the historical animosity between \nthem  and  the  Khmers  constrain  the  Vietnamese  contribution  to  community-based  natural \nresource management.23 Still, they are among the most innovative of fishers. The Cham too are \nfishers. But they do not experience segregation despite their conspicuous identity. \n \n                                                 \n21 The poverty line is the per capita expenditure needed to secure an intake of 2,100 calories per day. \n22 Social cohesion between groups is still low. Intrinsically, Khmer society lacks organized groups or structures above \nthe family group. The traditionally hierarchical nature of working arrangements, ethnic differences, collective \ntrauma from the Khmer Rouge regime, migration associated with seasonal flooding, as well as income disparities \ndemand special efforts at community organization. \n23 The Vietnamese number about 100,000 nationwide. The Cham, who have lived in Cambodia since the 15th \ncentury, number 300,000\u2013400,000 in total. \n   ", "      5 \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities24 \n13.  Analysis of key problems and opportunities reveals that: (i) natural resource management \ncoordination and planning for the TSBR is weak; (ii) communities that have been designated as \nkey  players  are  not  organized  for  natural  resource  management  in  the  TSBR;  and  (iii) \nmanagement capacity for biodiversity conservation in the TSBR is inadequate (Appendix 3). \n \n1.  Fish Stocks and Habitats \n14.  Incomplete  and  fragmented  data  has  hidden  the  decline  of  inland  fisheries.  Still, \nestimates of annual fish catches have improved since 1998 because of Danish International \nDevelopment Agency and Mekong River Commission assistance to DOF. Total catch may not \nbe falling due to the ever-increasing fishing effort (though the catch per fisher is). However, the \nshare of large and medium-size, higher-value fish has declined because of the longer time such \nfish need to reach maturity; intensive fishing; and inadequate regulation of fishing techniques \nand gear. Thus, a higher proportion of the total catch now comprises small fish used for \nfishmeal and fermented fish paste production. Crucially, in addition to the irresponsible fishing \ntechniques used, the flooded forest that provides breeding and feeding grounds for all fish and \nmuch of the lake's primary productivity is being destroyed. The flooded forest originally covered \nmore than 1 million ha; it had shrunk to about 610,000 ha by the 1960s and now covers only \nabout 362,000 ha (much of which consists of shrubland and secondary scrub with few trees). \nAlthough clearing and dry season burning for agricultural purposes is significant, the main \nproblem is firewood collection for both domestic use and local industries.25 \n \n15.  The  Tonle  Sap  is  most  likely  being  exploited  beyond  sustainable  limits.  Further \ndeterioration may have unpredictable consequences because capture fisheries do not usually \ndecline at regular linear rates; they can collapse suddenly due to irreversible damage to parts of \nthe  ecosystem  or  overfishing.  Such  a  collapse  would  have  serious  social  and  welfare \nconsequences: fish provides most of the protein in the diet of Cambodians and its sales \nsupplement income for the purchase of rice, especially in times of distress brought about by \ndrought, pest outbreaks, or floods.26 Many of the large indigenous species of fish such as the \ngiant Mekong River catfish (Pangasianodon gigas) and aquatic mammals such as the Irrawaddy \ndolphin  (Orcaella brevirostris) are already endangered. Also, collection of eggs and chicks \naggravates the threat to several species of waterfowl of global significance.27 The impact of \nintroduced exotic species such as giant mimosa (Mimosa pigra), water hyacinth (Eichhornia \ncrassipes), nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and some carps on the native flora and fauna of \nthe Tonle Sap is unknown; however, their potential threat should be researched. \n \n2.  Natural Resource Management Coordination and Planning \n16.  Policy  on  natural  resource  management  has  emphasized  sectoral  priorities,  but \ninterministerial coordination is weak. The existing framework shows many problems including \noverlapping  mandates,  uneven  implementation,  inadequate  monitoring  and  enforcement, \n                                                 \n24 See also Feast or Famine? Solutions to Cambodia's Fisheries Conflicts. 2001. A Report by the Fisheries Action \nCoalition Team in Collaboration with the Environmental Justice Foundation. \n25 Firewood and charcoal remain the main source of energy for up to 97% of households nationally, particularly in the \nrural areas. The demand for firewood and charcoal is predicted to grow. The Cambodia Fuelwood Saving Project in \nKompong Chhnang, funded by the Food and Agriculture of the United Nations (FAO), demonstrated that efficiency \nimprovements of up to 50% are attainable through improved design of cooking stoves. \n26 Rice is a feature of the Cambodian diet. Fishers need 5\u20137 kg of fish to buy 1 kg of rice. \n27 Estimates of the numbers taken annually reach many thousands. \n ", "6\ninconsistent  permit  and  registration  systems,  irregularities  in  financial  management,  and \nabsence of consistent mechanisms to declare and manage core areas. The Government has no \ncoordinated management plan for multiple use of the lake and the need to develop common \npolicy objectives for managing the TSBR is acutely felt. There is hope that the TSBR Secretariat \nwill  facilitate  coordination  and  fortify  cooperation  among  national  agencies,  provincial \nauthorities,  and  civil  society.  The  secretariat\u2019s  authority  is  equal  to  that  of  a  ministerial \ndepartment. Its purposes are to: (i) serve as an information clearinghouse open to all; (ii) \nconduct a nationwide awareness and mobilization campaign for the protection and sustainable \nuse of the Tonle Sap and its watershed; and (iii) effect cross-sectoral policy and strategy \ncoordination. However, the secretariat is new and must be strengthened. \n \n3.  Community Fisheries \n17.  Fish  stock  depletion  and  habitat  destruction  could  be  slowed,  even  reversed,  if \ncommunities had a sense of ownership and could self-regulate better.28 But community-level \nmanagement systems and capacity are weak or nonexistent. Conflict resolution mechanisms \ncannot prevent violent interventions because communities and individuals have few incentives \nto act responsibly. Legal instruments such as the Fisheries Law and the Wildlife Protection Law \nhave been drafted but await public consultation and approval by the National Assembly.29 \nCommunity fisheries have been created by prime ministerial decree, not because of stakeholder \nparticipation and empowerment. By the same token, DOF's Community Fisheries Development \nOffice (CFDO) was established only recently and offers no standards and guidelines from which \ncommunity fisheries could develop local approaches to natural resource management that \naccommodate  ecosystem-wide  considerations.  The  Government's  endeavors  to  engage \ncommunities in natural resource management should shift further from a fish-production focus to \na people focus, where the needs and aspirations of the communities are listened to and valued. \n \n4.  Resource Tenure \n18.  The Land Law (prepared with ADB assistance) addresses outstanding issues on land \npolicy by establishing basic access of rural people to private tenure over land. In the five project \nprovinces,  with  large  areas  having  natural  resources  used  by  communities,  a  system  for \ndefining the user rights of communities is also required. In instances, such rights will be both \nspatial and temporal: different communities will often share rights over forestry and fisheries. \nThe World Bank has begun to implement a land-titling project; however, the Tonle Sap region is \nnot one of its priorities. Conflict over fisheries is escalating; it will become worse if communities \ndo not have documentation certifying the right of occupancy or use of natural resources. Conflict \ncan be reduced by mapping, physical demarcation where relevant, and land use planning.30 But \nthe socialization of boundaries is complex and requires long-term commitment. \n                                                 \n28 Generally, management of natural resources by strengthened communities leads to equitable distribution of \nbenefits and sustainable use. Still, this assumes that overexploitation has not locked natural resources into terminal \ndecline and made concern for food security paramount to the detriment of the environment. \n29 The broad objectives of the Wildlife Protection Law are to provide a clear regulatory framework for management, \nuse, and conservation of wildlife and habitat; establish the management authorities for wildlife issues and specify \ntheir duties and functions; define the prohibited and permitted activities and procedures regarding wildlife use; list \nthe offenses, penalties and enforcement procedures; implement certain provisions of CITES; establish the lists of \nendangered and vulnerable wildlife species in Cambodia; and promote education and awareness of wildlife issues. \nIf the law comes into effect and is enforced, the regulation framework for wildlife conservation will suffice for most \nspecies and areas of the TSBR. However, key biodiversity areas will require vigilance and a targeted enforcement \nprogram. They are the three core areas of the TSBR and additional areas that may need to be identified, given the \nmigratory nature of some wildlife species. \n30 Maps help local people to locate their own resources and management needs. \n   ", "      7 \n \n5.  Policy Framework \n19.  The primary focus of the Fisheries Law as regards inland fisheries management is the \nfishing lot system. But policy needs to consider the sustainability of fisheries and the equitable \nsharing of its benefits. It should also give weight to the biodiversity of the core areas and buffer \nzone. Importantly, policy should be developed using participatory techniques. Its technical focus \nshould include concern for: (i) the conservation and protection of aquatic habitats on the \nfloodplains; (ii) enforcement of fisheries legislation to avoid overharvesting; (iii) monitoring of fish \ncatch and the status of fish and wildlife habitats; (iv) community land rights and land use within \nthe buffer zone; (v) technical reevaluation of the location of existing fish sanctuaries and fishing \nlot boundaries; and (vi) making up the fishing lot system more transparent. \n \n20.  Subdecrees, proclamations, and directives or circulars will be required to implement the \nFisheries Law. All need to be drafted for relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, and equity. Those \nthat relate to community fisheries management and reform of the auction system and burden \nbooks are expected to be implemented before adoption of the Fisheries Law. The subdecree on \nestablishment of community fisheries, for example, has been circulated for public comment and \nredrafted for submission to the Council of Ministers. It proposes to establish a framework for \ncommunity-based management, in cooperation with technical institutions and others entities. \nThe subdecree relating to the auction system and reform of the burden books is expected to \nimprove management of the remaining lots and make the process more transparent. But the \nagenda  for  reform  is  placing  a  considerable  burden  on  DOF,  which  already  suffers  from \ninstitutional weaknesses and low levels of capacity.31 Urgently, the subdecree on establishing \ncommunity fisheries needs to be reexamined from the following perspectives: \n(i)  Limiting community-based fisheries management to family-scale fishing. \nThe definition of family-scale fishing in the Fisheries Law has become obsolete \nand does not provide a realistic tool for present-day fisheries management. Most \nfamily-scale fishers complain that they cannot catch enough fish and must use \nmiddle-scale fishing gear. Their activities would therefore be officially excluded \nfrom  community-based  management  areas  and  they  would  in  all  likelihood \ncontinue to fish there illegally. The definition of family-scale fishing should be \nreviewed  promptly  to  decriminalize  people  attempting  to  provide  for  their \nfamilies. The  proposed  subdecree  does  not  provide  incentives  to  embrace \ncommunity fisheries. Community-based fisheries management should include all \nforms of fisheries and involve all stakeholders within the framework of a 5-year \nTonle Sap fisheries management plan. \n(ii)  Excluding  participants  other  than  Khmer  nationals.  The  status  of  the \nVietnamese minority, born in Cambodia but without valid documentation showing \nCambodian nationality, is not clear. Such households live on and fish in the Tonle \nSap and would need to participate in community fisheries management. The \nstatus of this minority should be examined and ways should be found to address \ntheir need for access and full participation in community fisheries. \n(iii)  The requirements for registration. The registration formalities required from \ncommunity fisheries need to be simplified with respect to statutes and bylaws. \n \n21.  Work on the regulatory framework is also hampered by the absence  of a fisheries \nmanagement plan for the Tonle Sap and an institutional anchor for it. The preparation and \n                                                 \n31 In 2000, only 33 fishery officers out of a total staff of 1,557 held postgraduate degrees. About 310 held first degrees \nand 479 held diplomas or had received certificate-level training. Salaries do not provide encouragement. \n ", "8\nregular updating of fisheries management plans is a legal requirement in many countries: it \ncomplements and influences the regulatory framework in a dynamic and adaptive manner. \n \n6.  Vulnerable Groups \n22.  Vulnerable groups in the Tonle Sap region include the distinct Vietnamese and Cham \nminorities, widows, and other female heads of households. Poverty does not distinguish gender, \nbut households headed by women or those lacking male labor are disadvantaged and have \nlimited  opportunities  compared  with  poor  households  with  male  heads.  In  such  situations, \nwidows not only have to satisfy the household\u2019s needs but must also care for young children. \nThis group alone represents 14.6% of total households in the rural areas of the five provinces \nadjoining the Tonle Sap.32 It is necessary to engage these groups in managing the Tonle Sap: \ntheir vulnerability marginalizes them from decision making and undervalues their contribution to \nthe economy. These stakeholders would also include the population living in the core areas, for \nwhom  no  resettlement  is  envisaged  under  the  Royal  Decree  on  the  Establishment  and \nManagement of the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT33 \nA.  Objective \n23.  The  goal  of  the  Project  is  sustainable  management  and  conservation  of  natural \nresources and biodiversity in the Tonle Sap basin. Its objective is to enhance systems and \ndevelop the capacity for natural resource management coordination and planning, community-\nbased natural resource management, and biodiversity conservation in the TSBR (Appendix 1). \n \n24.  The project area encompasses the TSBR and parts of the five adjoining provinces. It \ncomprises the core areas, the buffer zone, and the transition area that extends to and is \nultimately bounded by Highways No. 5 and No. 6. In 1998, about 2.9 million people lived in the \nproject area, of whom about 38% were below the poverty line. About 10% depended wholly on \nfishing and about 40% had fishing as a secondary occupation. More than 1.2 million people \nlived in the area bordered by the highways; the population of the core areas was estimated at \n4,200 and that of the buffer zone at 66,000.34 \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n25.  To accomplish its objective, the Project has three closely interrelated components: \n(i) strengthening natural resource management coordination and planning for the TSBR; (ii) \norganizing  communities  for  natural  resource  management  in  the  TSBR;  and  (iii)  building \nmanagement capacity for biodiversity conservation in the TSBR. \n \n                                                 \n32 Siem Reap Province, for instance, has a high percentage of households headed by females (30%), of which 63% \nare headed by widows. \n33 See also Asian Development Bank. 2001. Environments in Transition: Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, Viet Nam. \nThe strategy advocated for supporting sound management of the Tonle Sap rests on four building blocks: (i) a \npolicy  of  gradually  improving  the  system  of  fisheries  management  on  the  lake;  (ii)  consideration  of  the \ninterdependence of activities in the inundated zone and those in further fields; (iii) recognition of the multiplicity of \nprojects assisted by funding agencies around the Tonle Sap, and the extent to which synergy can be generated \namong the various initiatives; and (iv) greater institutional coherence in managing the Tonle Sap. \n34 The estimated populations in the core areas were 2,970 in Prek Toal, 695 in Boeng Tonle Chhmar (Moat Kla), and \n545 in Stung Sen. These numbers are expected to total 5,655 in 2010. \n   ", "      9 \n1.  Strengthening Natural Resource Management Coordination and Planning \nfor the TSBR \n26.  Establishing  a  Coordination  Framework  and  Information  Dissemination \nMechanisms. The Project will strengthen the TSBR Secretariat. It will create the capacity to \naddress legal and coordination issues in the TSBR, rationalize the designation of the various \nprotected  areas  in  the  TSBR,  and  formulate  common  policy  objectives  for  managing  the \nTSBR.35  The  issues  include  agricultural  and  fisheries  practices  (especially  pesticides), \nhazardous goods transport, solid waste management, and ecotourism. The common policy \nobjectives will be formulated by the TSBR Secretariat through quarterly interministerial meetings \ncalled and chaired by CNMC.36 The Project will also develop a TSBR Environmental Information \nDatabase (TSBR-ED) to support the secretariat's role as an information clearinghouse open to \nall. UNESCO will be appointed by direct selection to develop the TSBR-ED (Appendix 5).37 \nUNESCO will also be appointed by direct selection to formulate and implement a national \nenvironmental education and awareness campaign (Appendix 6).38 \n \n27.  Mapping the TSBR. The Project will prepare orthophotomaps at scale 1:5,000 from new \naerial photographs at scale 1:25,000.39 With the help of aerial photographs, orthophotomaps, \nand additional satellite imagery as required, the TSBR will be mapped to delineate biosphere \nzonation (i.e., core areas, buffer zone, and transition area); boundaries of commercial and \ncommunity fishing lots, fish sanctuaries, and administrative regions; and physiographic features \n(i.e., inundated areas, vegetation types, and agricultural areas).40 \n \n28.  Improving Regulation and Management Planning. The Project will prepare, complete, \nor, as necessary, amend the Fisheries Law and the subdecrees, proclamations, and directives \nor circulars associated with it, giving early attention to the subdecree on community fisheries.41 \nIt will also prepare a 5-year Tonle Sap fisheries management plan and set standards and \nguidelines  for  formulating  community  and  commercial  fisheries  management  plans,  to  be \ndisseminated by DOF.42 The Tonle Sap fisheries management plan will ni clude measures \nurgently needed to halt destructive practices. Later, under the Project, the management plans \nwill be integrated in the common policy objectives to underpin sustainable management and \n                                                 \n35 The  common  policy  objectives  will  delineate  an  interministerial  vision  for  sustainable  management  and \nconservation of natural resources and biodiversity. \n36 This will require: (i) defining the common policy objectives; (ii) identifying stakeholders; (iii) developing the most \nefficient strategy to elicit  comments from and disseminating information to each group of stakeholders; (iv) \nconsulting at the ministerial level to ensure that sectoral interests are considered and made consistent with other \nnational policies; (v) consulting at the provincial level to ensure that the common policy objectives are relevant and \nimplementable; and (vi) disseminating the common policy objectives to stakeholders. \n37 UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Programme has a major physical presence through the World Network of \nBiosphere Reserves. UNESCO will build linkages with the TSBR Secretariat through web site development, \nperiodic newsletters, and special publications. \n38 UNESCO will work with MOE, the National Commission for UNESCO, schoolteachers, and nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) to develop the campaign. UNESCO will organize environmental tours; short and interactive \nlectures on environment, ecology, hydrology, and the natural wonders of the Tonle Sap; drawing and painting \ncompetitions; exhibition of pictures; and participatory activities such as tree planting. \n39 Because weather conditions make it impractical to fly conventional aerial photography when the lake is at its lowest \nlevel, a mixture of conventional aerial and laser photography will be used. \n40 This project activity should be carried out in full consultation with the Ministry of Land Management, Urban \nPlanning, and Construction. \n41 The new fisheries legislation will be completed with reference to FAO's Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. \n42 To  embody  local  approaches  to  natural  resource  management  and  yet  accommodate  ecosystem-wide \nconsiderations, such plans could: (i) define the rights and obligations of the community; (ii) develop procedures for \ncommunities and legal authorities to cooperate in natural resource management and conflict resolution; (iii) \ndevelop systems to share information; and (iv) map out approaches to community funding of pilot projects. \n ", "10\nconservation of natural resources and biodiversity in the TSBR. To implement the management \nplan  and  make  possible  its  updating,  the  Project  will  establish  a  Tonle  Sap  fisheries \nmanagement task force within DOF and build it with on-the-job training. The Project will also \nassist CFDO to better fulfill its role of organizing communities for natural resource management. \n \n2.  Organizing Communities for Natural Resource Management in the TSBR43 \n29.  Formulating  an  Implementation  Structure.  The  Project  will  review  previous \napproaches to the community organization  for natural resource management in the TSBR, \nrefine a preferred approach in consultation with nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and \ndetail project activities to organize communities for natural resource management. In each \nproject province, it will also train staff of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries \n(DAFF), the Department of Environment (DOE), and the NGOs needed to support community-\nbased natural resource management. After collecting baseline information on the communities, \nthe Project will define a methodology for prioritizing them. The criteria may include expressions \nof interest, commitment, extent of environmental degradation, and occurrence of conflict.44 \n \n30.  Empowering Communities. The trained provincial staff and trained NGOs will then \nactivate  commune  councils  and  appropriate  village-level  structures  (such  as  the  village \ndevelopment  committees)  for  community-based  natural  resource  management.  Using  the \northophotomaps,  through  a  participatory  process  facilitated  by  the  contracted  NGOs,  the \nboundaries of community fisheries and forestry areas will be mapped. Boundaries that do not \nbring equitable social and economic benefits to the communities will be revised by agreement \namong the stakeholders, with an eye to environmental protection. The community organization \nactivities that they will implement in about 10\u201312 communities per province per year will \ncomprise workshops, training of trainers, and social networking. Led by the community fisheries \ndevelopment units, the provincial offices of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, and DOEs, in \nconsultation  with  NGOs,  will  also  encourage  communities  to  formulate  natural  resource \nmanagement plans (Appendix 7). \n \n31.  Evaluating Technical Packages in Support of Sustainable Livelihoods. The Project \nwill survey previous and ongoing approaches to the development of technical packages based \non sustainable natural resource management and recommend selected packages for replication \nor further development. These may include: (i) enhancing fish productivity through hatcheries or \nimproved fishing gear design; (ii) enhancing forestry productivity through nurseries, agroforestry, \nand  roadside  or  village  plantings;  (iii)  improved  technologies  for  value-adding for fish and \nforestry products; and (iv) disseminating fuel-efficient stoves.45 \n                                                 \n43 FAO will be engaged by direct selection to provide long-term advisory support to this component. With finance from \nthe Government of Belgium, since 1995, FAO has pioneered a project for Participatory Natural Resources \nManagement in the Tonle Sap Region. The first phase (1995\u20131998) conducted research and data collection on the \nflora and fauna of the flooded forest ecosystem as well as the socioeconomics of fishing and border zone \nagricultural communities. Forest resource management trials were initiated. The second phase (1998\u20132001) \nfocused on developing and implementing forest resources management by local communities within the Tonle Sap \necosystem but including activities in the surrounding rain-fed agriculture and upland areas. The project's activities \nfor community-based natural resource management have focused on community forestry mainly in upland forest \nareas, but some sites have also been involved in community organization in flooded forest areas within the TSBR. \nA  third  phase  (2001\u20132003)  focuses  on  expanding  successful  trials  for  community-based  natural  resource \nmanagement and beginning trials with community fisheries, taking advantage of recent reforms in fisheries \nmanagement. Throughout, emphasis has been on supporting provincial line agencies. \n44 The fishing lot released for community fisheries in Banteay Meanchey will be considered in the selection process. \nAny project activity in that lot would be handled from Battambang. \n45 Possibilities may exist for broad-scale application of select packages with financial support from the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction. \n   ", "      11 \n \n3.  Building Management Capacity for Biodiversity Conservation in the TSBR \n32.  Enhancing Management Capacity. The Project will establish and equip protected area \nmanagement  units  in  Battambang  and  Kompong  Thom  towns  building  on  existing  MOE \nfacilities. In the three core areas of the TSBR, the Project will also establish and equip core area \nmanagement centers that will additionally serve as visitor centers. The Project will institute a \nprocess for identifying additional core areas within the TSBR, including areas important for \npreserving  biodiversity  such  as  fish  sanctuaries.  This  will  necessitate  establishment  of \nstandardized procedures for specifying the types of protected areas within the TSBR, reviewing \nthe existing core areas and fish sanctuaries, and harmonizing specifications. Supporting these \nactivities will be a training needs analysis, and implementation of staff training programs in \nprotected area and biodiversity management. \n \n33.  Developing Systems for Monitoring and Management. The Project will design and \nimplement  a  biodiversity  monitoring  system  for  the  TSBR,  targeting  in  particular  indicator \nspecies of water birds and fish. It will establish a rapid response mechanism for seasonal \nprotection  of  biodiversity,  especially  in  fish  sanctuaries  and  Prek  Toal,  but  also  at  other \npromising sites in the TSBR.46 Further, it will develop a strategy and carry out an awareness \ncampaign for the control of exotic species, and conduct trials for eradicating or managing them. \nThe Project will also develop and implement a strategy to better enforce laws and regulations in \nand around the core areas and other important sites that may be identified in the TSBR to \nprotect  biodiversity  and  natural  habitats. Lastly, the Project will identify income-generation \nactivities that directly threaten biodiversity in the core areas and develop alternative livelihoods \nfor both migrants and permanent inhabitants so as to modify those activities. \n \n34.  Promoting Biodiversity Conservation Awareness, Education, and Outreach. The \nProject will develop and implement an environmental awareness, education, and outreach \nprogram (EAEOP) for the TSBR that builds on previous, ongoing, and planned activities of \nGovernment agencies and NGOs. The EAEOP will include the provision of about four floating \nenvironmental education centers for regular extension services to villages around the TSBR.47 \nThe Project will also ensure that the Department of Education and Communication in MOE \nliaises with the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports (MOEYS) to integrate the EAEOP into \nselected schools as part of the cluster schools program. Further, efforts will be made to include \nenvironmental  awareness  in  the  programs  of  religious  groups  and  promote  the  National \nEnvironment Day to the population of the Tonle Sap region. \n \nC.  Special Features \n35.  Strategic Planning. Sustainable  management and conservation of natural resources \nand biodiversity should be considered from the perspective of the basin feeding the Tonle Sap. \nIn keeping with this outlook, the Project initiates a framework within which subsequent projects \ncould address generic management and conservation concerns, propagate community-based \nnatural resource management, promote sustainable livelihoods,  pioneer stewardship of core \n                                                 \n46 Prek Toal is probably the most significant water bird nesting ground in Southeast Asia. \n47 The Project will replicate the floating environmental center (Greater Environment Chong Khneas Office [GECKO]) \nfunded under FAO's project for Participatory Natural Resources Management in the Tonle Sap Region. GECKO is \nmoored at Chong Khneas and moves around as necessary. It is used to: (i) extend environmental education to \ncommunities, particularly schoolchildren; (ii) build the capacity of schoolteachers in environmental education; (iii) \nmake tourists more aware of the environment; and (iv) generate educational and publicity materials for free \ndissemination and sale. \n ", "12\nareas by communities, upgrade basinwide research and database development, or encourage \nextension services in place of regulation. Infrastructure for waste management, water supply \nand  sanitation,  multipurpose  landing  sites,  ecotourism,  and  expanded  rural  credit  and \nmicrofinance may also be appropriate. \n \n36.  Cofinancing. The Project will leverage grant funding from the  Global Environment \nFacility  (GEF)  and  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme\u2019s  (UNDP\u2019s)  Capacity  21 \nprogram to promote complementarity of operations and sharing of experience (Appendix 8). \nGEF aims to meet the incremental cost of achieving global benefits, or the cost of an alternative \nproject to that which a country would have undertaken in its own interest. Its contribution to the \nProject will build management capacity for biodiversity conservation in the TSBR.48 UNDP's \nCapacity 21 program aims to build capacity for sustainable development. Its contribution to the \nProject will strengthen the ability of staff of CFDO and provincial line agencies to engage \ncommunities in natural resource management. \n \n37.  Social  Participation.  The  Project  will  promote  community  organization  for  natural \nresource management. Using a process approach, trained provincial staff of the DAFF; DOE; \nand contracted NGOs will select communities willing to participate in project activities. The \ncommunities will be trained in group activities. The poorer sections of the communities and \nwomen, particularly those who head households, will be encouraged to take part. \n \n38.  Specific Targeting of Beneficiaries. The Project will provide full opportunities for \nwomen,  especially  those  who  head  households,  to  participate  in  community  organization, \nrepresentation, training, training of trainers, and decision-making. The target is to allocate 40% \nof seats in community organizations to women depending on specific local situations and needs. \nSubgroups of women will be organized at village level for training and capacity building for \nparticipation and leadership. \n \n39.  Surveys on Livelihood Attributes. Community information collected in the process of \nprioritizing targets will serve for project monitoring and evaluation. The information will define \nthe communities in terms of natural resource base, social stratification, poverty, livelihood \nsystems, conflict, agricultural production, food insecurity, indebtedness, organization, gender \nissues, and access to economic resources. After 2 years, an external research institute will be \ncontracted  to  carry  out  an  evaluation.  Using  participatory  techniques  and  the  baseline \ninformation, the institute will assess progress in community organization. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n40.  The total project cost, including contingencies, taxes, and duties, is estimated at $19.4 \nmillion equivalent, consisting of foreign exchange of $8.8 million (about 45%) and local currency \nof $10.6 million equivalent (about 55%). GEF will cofinance the Project in the amount of about \n$3.9 million through  a grant to be implemented by UNDP. In addition, UNDP's Capacity 21 \nprogram will provide about $623,000 as grant.49 The Government will finance about $3.9 million \nequivalent in local currency (Appendix 9). \n \n \n \n                                                 \n48 The World Conservation Society wishes to cofinance, in the amount of $200,000, project activities to develop \nsystems for monitoring and management. \n49 Cofinancing by UNDP is contingent on approval of the loan by ADB and cofinancing by GEF. \n   ", "      13 \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nForeign  Local  Total \nComponent \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

Financing Plan \n41.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $10.9 million equivalent from its Special Funds \nresources to finance about $6.6 million in foreign exchange costs (about 75% of total foreign \nexchange costs) and $4.3 million equivalent of local currency costs (about 41% of total local \ncurrency costs). The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with \nan interest charge of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year during the \nremaining term. The Government's contribution will be $3.9 million equivalent (about 20% of the \ntotal project cost). \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Foreign Exchange  Local Currency  Total Cost  Percent \nADBa  6.57  4.34  10.91  56.3 \nGovernment of Cambodia  0.00  3.91  3.91  20.2 \nGEF  2.05  1.88  3.93  20.3 \nUNDP (Capacity 21)  0.15  0.46  0.61  3.2 \n    Total  8.77  10.59  19.36  100.0 \nNote: Figures may not add up due to rounding. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, GEF = Global Environment Facility, UNDP = United Nations Development \nProgramme. \na Includes interest charged during construction. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n42.  Project Management. A project steering committee (PSC) chaired by the minister of \nMAFF has been established to advise on project implementation, provide a mechanism for \nresolving implementation problems that go beyond single ministerial mandates, and review \nprogress. The members of the PSC are the minister of MAFF, the minister of MOE, the minister \nof the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the chairman of CNMC, and the governors of the five \nproject provinces, or their representatives. Meetings will take place every 6 months and, if \npossible, concurrent with CNMC board meetings. \n \n ", "14\n43.  MAFF will be the Executing Agency for the Project (Appendix 10). It will implement the \nbulk of project activities that relate to strengthening natural resource management coordination \nand planning for the TSBR and organizing communities for natural resource management in the \nTSBR. In recent years, it has developed technical and project management skills through \npractical  experience  in  projects  assisted  by  ADB  and  other  entities.  MAFF  also  has  an \nestablished network of representation in the five project provinces bordering the Tonle Sap. \nMOE will implement the activities that relate to building management capacity for biodiversity \nconservation  in  the  TSBR.  CNMC  will  assume  an  important  monitoring  and  coordinating \nfunction and will be responsible for formulating common policy objectives for managing the \nTSBR through the TSBR Secretariat. The UNDP Country Office in Phnom Penh will implement \nthe GEF and Capacity 21 grants under the national execution modality. \n \n44.  A project monitoring and coordination office (PMCO) has been established to assume \nresponsibility for integrating operations. The PMCO is located in the TSBR Secretariat, and the \npermanent deputy (environment) of the secretariat has been appointed as project coordinator. \nAn international project management advisor, a domestic finance and administration consultant, \nand full-time administrative, financial, and secretarial staff will assist the project coordinator. The \nPMCO will be responsible for project coordination, including consolidating financial statements, \nharmonizing  equipment  specifications  and  procurement  procedures,  scheduling  project \nactivities, and general administration. The three divisions of the TSBR Secretariat will provide \nthe PMCO with day-to-day technical support. During the first year of the Project, the Policy, \nStrategy,  and  Networking  Division  within  the  TSBR  Secretariat  will  be  strengthened  to \ncoordinate legal and policy issues pertaining to the TSBR. It will coordinate activities with the \nlegal drafting groups in central line agencies. \n \n45.  Project implementation offices (PIOs) have been set up in DOF, the Department of \nNature Conservation and Protection within MOE, and the TSBR Secretariat. Senior members of \nstaff of these institutions have been appointed as PIO head and will be supported by full-time \nadministrative, financial, and secretarial staff to supervise and manage direct implementation \nactivities under the Project. As such, PIOs will be responsible for planning and budgeting project \nactivities and, as required, supervising and monitoring provincial-level field activities through \nproject implementation units (PIUs). In the PIO in DOF, a fisheries management adviser will \nassume responsibility for supervising project activities in DOF and its PIUs and elaborating the \nterms  of  reference  for  the  service  provider  for  component  2.  Within  3  months  of  loan \neffectiveness, the PIUs will be set up in each of the five project provinces in the Office of \nFisheries in DAFF, and in DOE. Senior members of staff of these institutions will be seconded \non a full-time basis as PIU head and will be supported by full-time administrative, financial, and \nsecretarial staff to implement activities in the provinces. \n \n46.  Implementation  Period.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years.  For \ncomponent 1,  activities  will  concentrate  in  the  first  year  on:  (i)  strengthening  the  TSBR \nSecretariat's structures and facilities; (ii) formulating common policy objectives for managing the \nTSBR; and (iii) improving the regulatory and management framework for inland fisheries. The \nfocus  in  the  second  year  will  be  on:  (i)  developing  the  TSBR-ED;  (ii)  formulating  and \nimplementing  a  national  environmental  education  and  awareness  campaign;  (iii)  preparing \northophotomaps; (iv) delineating biosphere zonation and boundaries; (v) refining and adopting \nthe  common  policy  objectives  formulated;  (vi)  setting  standards  and  guidelines\u2014for \ndissemination  by  DOF\u2014for  formulating  community  and  commercial  fisheries  management \nplans; and (vii) building the capacity of CFDO. \n \n   ", "      15 \n47.  For component 2, activities in the first year will center on reviewing previous approaches \nto  organizing  communities  for  natural  resource  management  and  refining  the  preferred \napproach.  They  will  build  up  from  the  second  year  by:  (i)  strengthening  provincial  office \nstructures and facilities; (ii) implementing a training program for staff of provincial line agencies; \n(iii) activating commune councils and appropriate village-level structures for natural resource \nmanagement; (iv) mobilizing NGOs to support community-based natural resource management \nand monitor progress; (v) surveying previous and ongoing approaches to the development of \ntechnical  packages  based  on  sustainable  natural  resource  management;  and  (vi) \nrecommending selected technical packages for sustainable natural resource management that \ncan  be  replicated  or  further  developed.  The  third  year  activities  will  revolve  around:  (i) \norganizing  communities  for  natural  resource  management;  (ii)  reviewing  boundaries  and \ndescribing community resource rights; and (iii) encouraging the formulation of natural resource \nmanagement plans at the local level. \n \n48.  For component 3, activities in the first year will entail identifying indicator species and \ndesigning  a  biodiversity  monitoring  system.  Project  activities  during  the  second  year  will \ncomprise: (i) establishing and equipping protected area management units and core area \nmanagement centers; (ii) instituting a process for identifying additional core areas and fish \nsanctuaries; (iii) conducting a training needs analysis for protected area management and \nbiodiversity conservation; (iv) implementing a biodiversity monitoring system; (v) establishing a \nrapid-response mechanism for seasonal protection of biodiversity; (vi) developing a strategy and \ncarrying  out  an  awareness  campaign  for  the  control  of  exotic  species  and  conducting \nmanagement trials; (vii) developing a strategy to enforce laws and regulations in and around the \ncore areas and other important sites; (viii) identifying income-generating activities that directly \nthreaten biodiversity in the core areas and developing alternative livelihoods to modify those \nactivities; (ix) developing and implementing an EAEOP for the TSBR; and (x) establishing \nfloating  environmental  education  centers.  In  the  third  year,  activities  will  focus  on:  (i) \nimplementing  the  staff  training  program  for  protected  area  management  and  biodiversity \nconservation; (ii) implementing the strategy to enforce laws and regulations in and around the \ncore areas and other important sites; and (iii) incorporating the EAEOP into selected schools \naround the TSBR (Appendix 11). \n \n49.  Procurement. Goods and related services, and civil works to be financed from the loan \nproceeds will be procured in accordance with ADB's  Guidelines for Procurement. Vehicles, \nequipment, and material will be procured by international competitive bidding where the cost is \nmore than $500,000, or by international shopping where the cost is from $100,000 to $500,000. \nVehicles, equipment, and material valued at less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured \nunder local competitive bidding procedures (LCB). Minor items estimated to cost less than \n$50,000 may be purchased directly. The civil works to be financed from the proceeds of the loan \nare small, scattered, and unlikely to attract international bidders. They may be procured under \nLCB procedures (Appendix 12). \n \n50.  Consulting Services. The Project will require 271 person-months of international and \n1,402 person-months of domestic consulting services, mainly in fisheries, natural resource \nmanagement,  environmental  protection,  environmental  education,  and  community \norganization.50 The consultants financed under the loan will be engaged through a consulting \nfirm in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  Procurement  will  be  based  on \n                                                 \n50 About 171 person-months of international and 1,032 person-months of domestic consulting services will be loan-\nfinanced. \n ", "16\ncompetitive procedures, but where the number of service providers is limited, direct selection \nwill  be  applied  with  the  prior  approval  of  ADB.  Where  direct  selection  does  not  apply, \nconsultants will be recruited using ADB's quality and cost-based selection method. The Project \nwill also contract out services to prequalified international and local NGOs and other institutions. \nThe  consultants  financed  by  the  cofinanciers  will  be  recruited  in  consultation  with  ADB \n(Appendix 13). \n \n51.  Advance  Action.  On  30  April  2002,  ADB  approved  advance  action  for  recruiting \nconsultants and procuring goods and related services, and civil works. The advance actions are \nin accordance with ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and ADB's  Guidelines for \nProcurement. The Government has been advised that approval of advance action does not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n52.  Anticorruption Measures. The Project will comply with ADB's anticorruption policy, \nparticularly  in  respect  of  the  sections  of  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants that relate to fraud and corruption. External auditors will \naudit the project accounts annually and the Executing Agency will ensure the timely submission \nof audited accounts. \n \n53.  Accounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting. All agencies involved in implementation will \nmaintain separate accounts for project-related disbursements. The PMCO will consolidate the \naccounts from all sources to MAFF, which will then review and submit them to the Ministry of \nEconomy and Finance and ADB. All project accounts will be audited independently annually. \nThe audit report will include, among others, a statement verifying that funds disbursed by ADB \nagainst the statement of expenditures (SOE) have been used as claimed. Project accounts, \ntogether with disbursement documentation, will be audited annually with all reports forwarded to \nADB and the Government within 9 months of the end of each fiscal year. The Government will \nopen an imprest account at the National Bank of Cambodia or any commercial bank designated \nby the Government. Second-generation imprest accounts will be opened in the name of CNMC, \nMAFF, and MOE, which will take direct responsibility for all administrative and accounting \nrequirements relating to the operation and use of such funds. The initial advance for the imprest \naccount will be the estimated expenditures for 6 months, with a ceiling of $1 million. SOE \nprocedures will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures with a total contract value not \nexceeding  the  equivalent  of  $100,000  and  to  liquidate  advances  covered  in  the  imprest \naccounts.  The  imprest  accounts  and  SOE  procedures  will  be  established,  operated,  and \nmaintained in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001). Both will \nbe audited as part of the regular audit of the project's account, with financial statements and \naudit opinion set out separately within 9 months from the end of the fiscal year. \n \n54.  Project Monitoring and Evaluation. Project performance and achievement of benefits \nwill be monitored based on the project framework. However, given the process nature of the \nProject, it is anticipated that the framework could evolve during implementation and entail \nmodification of outputs and activities. The PIUs will provide the PIOs with standardized quarterly \nreports during each year of implementation, detailing the physical and financial progress of \nactivities against targets and summarizing monitoring and evaluation results. In turn, the PIOs \nwill submit to the PMCO consolidated quarterly progress reports. The PMCO will submit to the \nGovernment  and  ADB  6-monthly  progress  reports  that  pay  close  attention  to  output \naccomplishment and improvement of activities. \n \n55.  Project Review. During the first 3 years of project implementation, ADB will carry out \nsemiannual  reviews.  In  the  third  year,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a \n   ", "      17 \ncomprehensive midterm review. GEF and UNDP grant reporting will comply with GEF and \nUNDP requirements, respectively. Within 3 months of the physical completion of the Project, the \nPMCO will make publicly available a project completion report in the standard ADB format. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n56.  A TA will be provided to improve the regulatory and management framework for inland \nfisheries, giving early attention to the subdecree on community fisheries. The total cost of the \nTA is estimated at $634,000, comprising foreign exchange of $396,000 and local currency of \n$238,000 equivalent. The Government has requested ADB to finance $540,000 equivalent, \nincluding the entire foreign exchange cost and $144,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will \nfinance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $94,000, largely through the \nprovision of office accommodation and remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff, as set \nout in the cost estimates and financing plan for the TA. The TA will be implemented over 12 \nmonths. The Executing Agency will be DOF. FAO will be selected directly to deliver the services \nrequired (Appendix 14). \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Environmental \n57.  By engaging many national actors, the Project will activate Cambodia's principal policy \ninstruments for natural resource management. It will also help Cambodia to meet the obligations \nthat are embodied in more than 10 treaties and conventions, and work toward the goals of \nUNESCO's Seville Strategy for Biosphere Reserves, 1995.51 \n \nB.  Policy \n58.  The reform of inland fisheries is placing a considerable burden on DOF. It is urgent to \nprovide a legal basis for sound management of fisheries resources, establish a policy and \ntechnical framework that incorporates principles of ecosystem-wide management, and define a \nshared interministerial vision for managing the TSBR. The Project will improve the regulatory \nand  management  framework  for  inland  fisheries.  It  will  also  create  capacity  in  the  TSBR \nSecretariat to address legal and policy issues, and advance through CNMC the formulation of \ncommon policy objectives for managing the TSBR. \n \nC.  Institutional \n59.  Sustainable  management  and  conservation  of  natural  resources  and  biodiversity \ndepends on having adequate capacity at all levels. At the national level, the Project will enhance \nmanagement systems and develop the capability to coordinate and plan for natural resource \nmanagement. At the provincial and district levels, it will nurture the capability of Government line \nagencies and NGOs to assist the communities in managing natural resources. At the local level, \nthe Project will organize and promote community participation in managing natural resources \nand develop Government line agencies\u2019 capability for biodiversity conservation. \n \n                                                 \n51 The goals of the Seville Strategy for Biosphere Reserves are to: (i) use biosphere reserves to conserve natural and \ncultural diversity; (ii) use biosphere reserves as models of land management and of approaches to sustainable \ndevelopment; (iii) use biosphere reserves for research, monitoring, education, and training; and (iv) implement the \nbiosphere reserve concept. \n ", "18\nD.  Social \n60.  Community  Organization.  Cambodia  has  suffered  social  dislocation  and  working \ncooperatively is not easy. The Project will promote the cohesion of communities and raise their \neconomic efficiency and ability to capture investment. In relation to governance, the Project will \nstimulate the decentralization achieved by the first commune-level elections of February 2002, \nwhich aimed to build democracy from the grassroots. \n \n61.  Poverty  Reduction.  The  Project  will  strengthen  the  self-reliance  of  the  poor  and \nvulnerable groups in communities by giving them a voice in determining future community \ndevelopment and activities in managing natural resources; encouraging them to participate in \nmapping and delineating of boundaries; enhancing their capacity to organize and manage \nnatural  resources;  and  conducting  surveys  and  making  recommendations  for  technical \npackages promoting viable, diversified, or alternative livelihoods. Female heads of households \nand widows will be encouraged to take part in training and group-based activities (Appendix 15). \n \n62.  Ethnic Minorities. The Project will give ethnic minorities opportunities to participate in \ncommunity  organization.  It  will  attempt\u2014through  commune  councils,  commune  chiefs, \nGovernment staff trained in participatory approaches, and NGOs\u2014to build relations of trust \nbetween the Khmers and the Vietnamese minority.52 The impact of participation on minorities \nwill be monitored. The TA will examine the rights of Vietnamese communities. \n \nE.  Economic \n63.  Inland fisheries contribute 5\u201310% of Cambodia's gross domestic product: a decline in \ntheir volume or value would have immediate drastic effects on Cambodia's economy. Aside from \nthe significance of the lake in the economy, impairment of its fisheries would deprive poor \npeople of their main source of protein and undermine their fragile food and health security.53 In \nshort, the replacement cost of the Tonle Sap's fisheries would be unaffordable.54 Economic \nbenefits from the Project need to be seen in this light. Other economic benefits that are not \neasily measured arise from the Project's capacity-building activities, which will continue to be \navailable  for  development  activities  in  the  future.  At  the  global  level,  loss  of  the  lake's \nbiodiversity would have irreparable consequences for future generations. \n \nF.  Risks \n64.  Regulatory Framework. Insufficient review of and delay in preparing, completing, or \namending the Fisheries Law and the subdecrees, proclamations, and directives or circulars \nassociated with it are risks. The TA will mitigate them. \n \n65.  Coverage. The Project will refine a preferred approach to community organization and \napply it in the five project provinces. Rapid expansion is a risk that the Project addresses in two \n                                                 \n52 Cooperation between the Khmers and the Cham minority is not problematic. \n53 The Tonle Sap's importance in respect of food security is certain to increase, given the growth pressure of a large \nunder-15-year-old population (nearing 50%). \n54 Policy makers often undervalue inland fisheries. A realistic method of approximating nonmarketed benefits from the \nTonle Sap would be to calculate the cost of an alternative for its original products or services, if it can be found. For \ninstance, given the importance of fish in the Cambodian diet, the cost of replacing this source of food should the \nTonle Sap\u2019s fisheries suddenly collapse would be at least that of providing in equal quantities 40\u201370% of the \nprotein intake of the country's population. \n   ", "      19 \nways: it will avail of the local expertise built up by FAO, and it will consider, in the phasing of \ncommunity organization, the willingness to participate. \n \n66.  Sectoral  Interests.  Sectoral  interests  may  hamper  interministerial  cooperation  for \nnatural resource management. For this reason, establishment of the TSBR Secretariat as \ncoordinating body, with a direct reporting line to CNMC, gives ground for optimism. The Project \nwill strengthen the TSBR Secretariat to further temper sectoral interests. \n \n67.  Community Self-Regulation. The Project will demonstrate community self-regulation \nas a viable alternative to command and control, bearing in mind that change cannot happen \novernight. Participation will arise out of a system that is fair and is seen to be so. To this intent, \nthe Project will make clear the benefits of community-based management of natural resources. \n \n68.  Mekong River. Dam construction on the Mekong River and its tributaries would affect \nfish migration and breeding patterns but also the level of flooding in the Tonle Sap. Concerns \nhave also been raised over plans to clear rapids and widen a shipping lane in the Mekong River \nto enable cargo boats to navigate between the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Thailand \nin the dry season. A permanent lowering of flood levels in the lake or an alteration in floods \nwould reduce the Project\u2019s benefits.55 This warrants international support to the Mekong River \nCommission's basin development plan and water utilization program. \n \n69.  Environmental Impact. The Project is classified under environment category B. An \ninitial environmental examination undertaken during project preparation concluded that the \nProject would have no negative impacts on the environment. \n \n70.  Availability of Human Resources. The availability and capacity of line agency staff for \nsocial networking may pose a limitation. To counter this risk, the Project will effect substantial \nstaff training in the first 12\u201318 months of implementation. It will also contract international \norganizations and NGOs with experience in Cambodia.56 \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n71.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)  Counterpart funds. The Government will provide counterpart funds for project \nimplementation on time. The Government will make timely submissions of annual \nbudgetary  appropriation  requests  and  ensure  prompt  disbursement  of \nappropriated funds during each year of project implementation. \n(ii)  Project framework. The Government and the Executing Agency will ensure that \nthey implement the Project in accordance with the project framework, as set out \nin Appendix 1 of this report, and within the time frame stipulated therein. \n(iii)  Regulatory framework. The Government will ensure that it prepares or amends \nthe Fisheries Law, including the subdecrees, proclamations, and directives or \ncirculars associated with the Fisheries Law, on time, in the form and substance \ndeveloped  by  the  TA.  Within  18  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  draft \namendment to the Fisheries Law developed pursuant to the TA will have been \n                                                 \n55 Data from 1940\u20132000 shows a clear correlation between water levels at peak flood and fish catch. \n56 One hundred local and 200 international NGOs are in Cambodia. Many carry out environment-related activities. \n ", "20\nsubmitted to the legislator. The Government will further ensure that within 6 \nmonths of the promulgation of the amended Fisheries Law, the implementing \nregulations or subdecrees to the amended Fisheries Law will have been issued. \n(iv)  Mapping. The Government and the Executing Agency will make available to \ninterested parties all mapping and database products. \n(v)  Gender. The Government will ensure that the Project provides full opportunities \nfor women, particularly female heads of households, to participate in community \norganization,  representation,  and  decision  making.  About  40%  of  seats  in \ncommunity organizations will be allocated to women. Women will be organized \nfor training and capacity building for participation and leadership. They will be \nselected  for  training  in  livelihood  development,  value-added  activities,  and \nestablishing linkages with ongoing microfinance programs. \n(vi)  Ethnic minorities. The Government will ensure that the Project benefits ethnic \nminorities by providing them opportunities to participate in training in community \norganization. The Project's impact on ethnic minorities will be observed during \nmonitoring and evaluation. \n(vii)  Project  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  Government  will  ensure  that \ncommunity data collected in the process of prioritizing targets serves as baseline \ninformation for project monitoring and evaluation. \n(viii)  External  auditors,  annual  auditing,  and  financial  statements.  External \nauditors will be engaged to audit project accounts. The annual audited accounts \nand financial statements, together with audit reports, in English, will be submitted \nto ADB within 9 months following the end of the Government's fiscal year. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n72.  Prior to loan effectiveness, the following will have been completed: \n(i)  TSBR Secretariat. Directives of the chairman of CNMC will have been issued for \nthe appointment of the necessary staff of the Policy, Strategy, and Networking \nDivision within the TSBR Secretariat, consisting of experts in fisheries, water \nresource management, land management, agronomy, environmental database \nmanagement, and law. \n(ii)  Counterpart staff. All necessary staff and facilities for the PSC, PMCO, and \nPIOs will have been appointed and provided. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n73.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  8,248,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Tonle  Sap \nEnvironmental  Management  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest \ncharge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to \nthe Board. \n \n \nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n \n18 October 2002 \n   ", "  Appendix 1  21 \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance \nDesign Summary  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nIndicators/Targets \nGoal       \n1.1  Sustainable  1.1  Systems and capacity  1.1  Project performance \nmanagement and  for natural resource  audit report \nconservation of natural  management and  1.2  Parameters of \nresources and  biodiversity  ecosystem (i.e., flooded \nbiodiversity in the Tonle  conservation are in  forest cover, hydrology, \nSap Basin  place and functioning  biodiversity) from \nproject monitoring and \nevaluation system \nObjective       \n1.1  To enhance systems  1.1  Natural resource  1.1  Project framework  ??

In response to a request from the Government of Cambodia, the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) provided technical assistance for preparing the Project.1 The objective was to \nprepare a detailed proposal for investment to develop and support community-based integrated \nmanagement systems for the fisheries, forestry, and agricultural resources of the Tonle Sap. In \nJuly 2001, the implementation consultant submitted a draft feasibility study. In November 2001, \nADB engaged individual consultants to reinforce the study with supplementary analyses. \n \n2.  An ADB mission visited Cambodia from 22 October to 5 November 2001. After reviewing \nthe problems facing the Tonle Sap, the Mission concluded that sustainable management and \nconservation  of  natural  resources  and  biodiversity  should  be  considered  from  the  basin's \nperspective. In keeping with this  outlook, the Mission recommended that a first project build \nmanagement systems and capacity and that provision be made for investment projects once \nthis has been achieved. For the Project, the Mission identified components and costs, executing \nand  implementing  agencies,  and  cofinanciers.  It  spelled  out  the  requirements  for  aid \ncoordination and finalized the terms of reference for the  supplementary project formulation \nactivities required. From 5 November to 14 December 2001, the individual consultants engaged \nby ADB described the Project envisaged, focusing on the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve. \nThereafter, on 17\u201318 December 2001, an ADB Mission visited Cambodia to take stock of the \nfindings. \n \n3.  The ADB Loan Fact-Finding Mission visited Cambodia from 25 February to 15 March \n2002 to  (i) update available information on all aspects of the proposed Project (including \ntechnical, financial, economic, legal, institutional, social, environmental, and policy matters); (ii) \nconsult with a cross-section of prospective beneficiaries and nongovernment organizations; (iii) \ndevote  attention  to  institutional  capacities,  project  costs,  and  financing  arrangements;  (iv) \nsecure the active involvement of the Government, as well as adequate and timely counterpart \nfunds for the Project; and  (v) clarify prospects for commitments to the Project from other \nsources. It examined the Project in the context of the Government's development objectives and \nADB's operational strategy for Cambodia, and refined the Project's design. \n \n4.  The ADB Loan Appraisal Mission visited Cambodia from 13 May to 5 June 2002 to \ncomplete the review and analysis of the loan proposal and the sector to which it relates, \nincluding the technical, financial, economic, legal, institutional, social, environmental, and other \naspects of the Project.2 \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1998.

In  support  of  the  technical  assistance,  ADB  agreed  that  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme (UNDP) execute GEF PDF-B grant technical assistance, for $350,000, to prepare a biodiversity \nconservation project in the Tonle Sap. UNDP would then take the lead in executing a Global Environment Facility \n(GEF) grant paralleling an ADB project. During project formulation, UNDP determined that Capacity 21 funding \ncould also be sought to build the capacity for sustainable development through participatory and institutional \nstrengthening approaches. \n2  The Mission was joined by D. Greboval, Senior Fishery Planning Officer, Food and Agriculture Organization of the \nUnited Nations (FAO); B. Koemlangan, Legal Officer; FAO; P.

It supports a \nhuge population through its enormous fisheries productivity and water supply and provides the \nlast refuge for some of Asia\u2019s most globally significant biodiversity.a However, human population \nand development pressures are increasing. In response, the Government established the Tonle \nSap Biosphere Reserve (TSBR) in February 2001 as a focal point of environmental management. \nNot surprisingly, the establishment of the TSBR has shed light on the numerous threats to the \nTonle Sap, the most immediate of which defined  the core problems to be addressed by the \nProject. \n(ii)  However, each threat to the Tonle Sap has multiple root causes, the severity of which conditions \nthe speed and manner in which they can be addressed. In recognition of the complexity of the \nagents of change, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) recognized that sustainable management \nand conservation of natural resources and biodiversity should be considered from the perspective \nof the basin feeding the Tonle Sap. In keeping with this outlook, the Project initiates a framework \nwithin  which  subsequent  projects  could  address  generic  management  and  conservation \nconcerns,  propagate  community-based  natural  resource  management,  promote  sustainable \nlivelihoods, pioneer stewardship of core areas by communities, upgrade basinwide research and \ndatabase development, or encourage extension services in place of regulation. Infrastructure for \nwaste management, water supply and sanitation, multipurpose landing sites, ecotourism, and \nexpanded rural credit and microfinance may also be appropriate. \n(iii)  ADB's  Country  Strategy  and  Program,  2003\u20132005  for  Cambodia  reflects  ADB's  sectorwide \napproach to the Tonle Sap Basin. ADB expects to pursue this approach over a 10-year horizon. \nUnder the program, the Project (2002) will enhance systems and develop the capacity for natural \nresource  management  coordination  and  planning,  community-based  natural  resource \nmanagement, and biodiversity conservation in the TSBR. Two other loans are also planned: \n(a)  Chong Kneas Environmental Improvement (2004). This project will complement and \nbuild  on  the  enhanced  systems  for  natural  resource  management  coordination  and \nplanning that are to be developed under the Project. Its objective will be to improve the \nsocial and natural environment at Chong Kneas by upgrading existing infrastructure (boat \nlanding and related facilities), providing communal services (water supply, sanitation, and \nwaste collection and disposal), and eliminating threats to the environment resulting from \nthe chaotic exercise of competing claims by residents, fisher folk, tourists, vendors, and \nboat operators to access via the currently inadequate port facilities. The project will \nimprove living conditions for residents of Chong Kneas, remove health hazards, and \nprovide increased opportunities for employment and development of new livelihoods and \nsmall enterprises. \n(b)  Tonle Sap Sustainable Livelihoods Sector (2005). This project will complement and \nbuild on the enhanced community capacity for natural resource management that is to be \ndeveloped under the Project. Its objective will be to reduce poverty in poor communities \nwithin  the  flooded  area  of  the  Tonle  Sap,  through  decentralized  and  participatory \nactivities to support rural development. The project will support community mobilization \nfor formulation of development plans and implementation of small-scale infrastructure to \nenhance rural incomes and thereby relieve pressures on the natural resources of the \nTonle Sap basin. In a complementary manner, the project will also provide alternative \nlivelihood activities and further develop the capacity for natural resource management. It \nwill adopt a process approach that strengthens the community\u2019s sense of ownership and \ncapacity through participatory planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. \n(iv)  ADB will augment its support for sustainable management and conservation by leveraging grant \nresources to enable improvements in the livelihoods of the poorest, for instance, through better \naccess  to  basic  and  facilitating  infrastructure  as  well  as  improved  access  to  information, \ntechnologies, and training. \n \na  Much of this biodiversity came to light only recently, following decades of insecurity and isolation in Cambodia. \n   ", "  Appendix 4  31 \nTHE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BIODIVERSITY OF THE TONLE SAP \n \n1.  The Tonle Sap covers an area of 250,000\u2013300,000 hectares (ha) in the dry season and \nis the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia. Its immense wetlands are the result of a unique \nhydrological phenomenon. When the level of the Mekong River rises, water flows up the Tonle \nSap River and spreads over the Tonle Sap floodplain, inundating 1.0\u20131.6 million ha. In the face \nof the loss of wetland habitat, the Tonle Sap floodplain's size (by far the greatest continuous \narea  of  savannah  swamp  forest  and  inundated  forest  in  the  entire  Asian  region),  habitat \ndiversity, and relative preservation are of exceptional importance. (Other wetland areas of \nCambodia and Southern Viet Nam are widely disturbed.) Almost 200 plant species have been \nrecorded in the Tonle Sap region. This huge wetland system with its habitat diversity supports \none of the world\u2019s most productive freshwater fisheries. The ecosystem is essential to the \nsurvival of the many globally significant species of birds, mammals, and reptiles found around \nthe lake during migration. The Tonle Sap and its floodplain are also important as a river system. \nThey regulate the discharge of the Mekong River and prevent flooding and saltwater intrusion \ninto the Mekong Delta. \n \nA.  Flora \n \n2.  The flooded forest of the Tonle Sap is the largest remaining example of this type of \nhabitat in Southeast Asia. Despite the common name, this flooded forest is in fact a diverse \nunity of habitats, including shrub lands, stunted swamp forests, gallery forests, and submerged \nand floating aquatic vegetation. About 200 plant species have been recorded and the flora as a \nwhole is distinct from that of other wetlands associated with the Mekong River, especially with \nregard  to  woody  species.  Some  restricted-range  tree  species  (Homalium  brevidens  and \nTerminalia cambodiana) are endemic to the Tonle Sap and the southern coastal zone of \nCambodia and have suffered from exploitation for charcoal production. The flora of the Tonle \nSap and its specific adaptations to withstand months of flooding are insufficiently studied and \nunderstood. \n \nB.  Fish \n \n3.  The  fisheries  of  the  Tonle  Sap  and  the  Tonle  Sap  River  account  for  15\u201320% of \nfreshwater capture fisheries in the lower Mekong Basin and represent 50\u201370% of the catch for \nCambodia. The fisheries productivity of the lake is known to be one of the highest in the world: \nnearly  10  times  more  productive  than  the  North  Atlantic  sea  fisheries  per  hectare.  This \nproductivity is generally attributed to the flooded forest. A total of 107 fish species has been \nrecorded for the lake only; the number of fish species occurring in the Tonle Sap River is \nprobably higher, and new species are regularly discovered and described. \n \nC.  Invertebrates \n \n4.  Invertebrates are an important component of the Tonle Sap's ecosystem. The available \ntaxonomic  information  is  incomplete  but  studies  so  far  have  identified  46  species  of \nzooplankton. The rich biodiversity of mollusks in the Tonle Sap has been described as striking \nand 57 species of benthic invertebrates have been identified. Boeung Tonle Chhmar, the Stung \nSen River, and Sangke River estuaries are areas with high concentrations of bivalves. Three \nspecies of bivalves (Cobicula bocourti, C. cyreniformes, C. moreletiana), two species of prawns \n(Macrobrachium rosenbergii, M. lanchesteri) and one species of crab (Somanniathelpusa sp.) \nhave been confirmed for the Tonle Sap. These freshwater invertebrates are an important source \nof food for people and aquatic wildlife. \n ", "32  Appendix 4 \n \nD.  Mammals \n \n5.  Some 46 mammal species are likely to occur in the Tonle Sap region. Some large \nspecies such as the Asiatic elephant and tiger used to migrate from upland areas to the Tonle \nSap through natural corridors. An agricultural belt cutting off the floodplain from upland forest \nareas now surrounds the floodplain. This isolation has resulted in a decrease in the number of \nmammal species occurring in the Tonle Sap. The current status of the mammal species directly \ndependent on the Tonle Sap is poorly documented, but number at least 15 species. \n \nE.  Birds \n \n6.  The Tonle Sap (mainly at Prek Toal, but also at Boeng Tonle Chhmar) sustains the \nlargest colonies of water birds in Indochina, and perhaps in Southeast Asia. Its floodplain is an \nimportant breeding area for ducks, jacanas, bustards, rails, herons and egrets, cormorants, \ndarters, ibises, pelicans, and storks. Some 225 species of birds have been recorded in the \nTonle Sap region since the 1960s. \n \nF.  Reptiles and Amphibians \n \n7.  The occurrence and distribution of amphibians and reptiles in Cambodia are not known \nwell and herpetologists still rely on historical literature. There are probably 42 species of reptiles \n(including 1 species of endemic water snake, 7 species of turtles or tortoises, and 1 species of \ncrocodile). \n \nG.  Threatened Species \n \n8.  Rapid human population growth and associated development pressures, and demand \nfor natural resources are affecting biodiversity (Table A2.1). Many species found in Cambodian \nwetlands are on the  International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources \n(IUCN) Red List, and 12 species are listed under the Convention on International Trade in \nEndangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, 1979. \nTable A4.1: Threatened Species Found in Cambodian Wetlands \nTaxonomic  Critically  Data \nEndangered  Vulnerable  Lower Risk  Total \nGroup  Endangered  Deficient \nBirds    2    5    7    9    0    23 \nDolphins and    0    0    0    0    2    2 \nPorpoises \nTurtles and    2    2    6    1    0    11 \nTerrapins \nOther    0    0    3    4    1    8 \nMammals \nFish    2    6    0    1    2    11 \nCrocodiles    1    0    1    0    0    2 \nand Snakes \nTotal    7    13    17    15    5    57 \nNote: Categories refer to the IUCN threat category. \nSource: 2000 IUCN Red List. \n   ", "  Appendix 4  33 \nH.  The Core Areas \n \n9.  The three core areas within the Tonle Sap floodplain were identified on the basis of their \nexceptional conservation value (Table A2.2). Prek Toal hosts important breeding colonies of \nlarge water birds. Boeng Tonle Chhmar boasts the highest habitat diversity on the floodplain, \nconsisting of a system of creeks, waterways, a permanent lake within the floodplain, and \nnumerous isolated permanent pools.

Background \n \n1.  In  September  2001,  the  Tonle  Sap  Biosphere  Reserve  (TSBR)  Secretariat  was \nestablished within the Cambodia National Mekong Committee to facilitate coordination and \nfortify cooperation among national agencies, provincial authorities, and civil society. However, \nno information exchange and management system serves its needs. Much data on the Tonle \nSap exists and new data is being collected continuously. However, this data is scattered among \ninstitutions, projects, and individuals and is in diverse forms: publications, technical reports, \nworkshop papers, seminar proceedings, and digital files. Access is difficult and there is no \nupdated directory or metadatabase for stakeholders to consult. What is more, data quality is \noften questionable because that there is no mechanism for validation and aggregation. In short, \nthere  is  no  comprehensive  environmental  information  database  that  offers  an  official  and \ncommon  service.  Developing  such  a  database  is  urgent  to  backstop  natural  resource \nmanagement coordination and planning for the TSBR. To this intent, the Project will establish in \nthe TSBR Secretariat an environmental information database (TSBR-ED) that will serve as an \ninformation clearinghouse open to all. Fittingly, the TSBR-ED will build on the  United Nations \nEducational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization's  (UNESCO) experience in environmental \ndata management, especially on its MABnet, and Biosphere Reserve Integrated Monitoring \ninitiative.1 \n \nB.  Approach to Database Development \n \n1.  Objective and Outputs \n \n2.  The  goal  of  the  Project  is  sustainable  management  and  conservation  of  natural \nresources and biodiversity in the Tonle Sap basin. Establishing the TSBR-ED will help to \naccomplish  the  objective  of  strengthened  natural  resource  management  coordination  and \nplanning for the TSBR. The needed outputs to establish the TSBR-ED are as follows: (i) building \nan  efficient  information  clearinghouse  mechanism;  (ii)  establishing  a  database  to  support \nmanagement planning, environmental assessment, and public information; (iii) establishing and \nmaintaining  a  TSBR  web  site;  (iv)  developing  TSBR  publications  on  environment  and \ndevelopment; and (v) establishing a documentation center. When it is established, the TSBR-\nED  will  constitute  an  important  tool  of  Government  agencies,  specialized  institutions, \nenvironmental education projects, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), the private sector, \nand the aid community. \n \n2.  Key Activities by Output \n \na.  Building an Efficient Information Clearinghouse Mechanism \n \n3.  The TSBR Secretariat needs an information clearinghouse mechanism. This mechanism \nshould  consist  of  well-prepared  work  plans,  information  services  and  products,  and  data \nmanagement  capacity,  buttressed  by  qualified  technical  staff  and  equipment.  A  series  of \n                                                 \n1  The Biosphere Reserve Integrated Monitoring initiative undertakes a biotic, biodiversity, socioeconomic, and \nintegrated monitoring in UNESCO's World Network of Biosphere Reserves. Its goal is to provide a platform for \nintegration of the resulting information and data, thus contributing to a better understanding of the changes that \ntake  place  in  the  areas  studied,  the  factors  triggering  those  changes,  and  the  options  for  planning  and \nmanagement. \n   ", "  Appendix 5  35 \ntechnical agreements will be established to facilitate exchange of data and information between \nstakeholders. Project activities will include elaborating agreements for information collection, \nmanagement, and exchange; designing and implementing technical work plans; identifying and \nrecruiting qualified technical staff; and installing the equipment required. \n \nb.  Establishing  a  Database  to  Support  Management  Planning, \nEnvironmental Assessment, and Public Information \n \n4  The database will integrate or link with existing databases and will be supported by a \ngeographic information system (GIS) and other technologies (Table A5). Efforts will be made to \nvalidate and aggregate data and databases to provide a common and official set on natural \nresource management in the Tonle Sap. The TSBR-ED, however, will not duplicate or replace \nother specialized databases. Rather, it will compile information from these sources. \nTable A5: Geographic Information Data Requirements \nLand Use and Land \nTopographic Data  Conservation Data  Special Data \nCover Data \nDistrict center  Land use (1993, MRC)  Distribution of water bird  Hydrology \n    species (MOE)   \nCommune center  Land cover of the Tonle    Water quality and water \n  Sap (1993, FAO)  Protected areas (MOE)  pollution \nVillage center       \n  Land cover of the Tonle  Biosphere Reserve  Floods \nDistrict boundaries  Sap (1997, MRC)  zonation (MOE)   \n    Rainfall \nCommune boundaries  Water bird census (MOE,   \n  WCS)  Population (1998,UNFPA) \nMajor roads, power supply     \nlines, and  Reptile census  Fishing lots (MAFF, MOE) \ncommunication     \nfacilities  Other wildlife surveys  Community fishing \n  grounds (MOE) \nRivers and drainage   \n  Rice field distribution \nContours of elevation and   \ndigital terrain data  Tourism development \n \nSocioeconomy \nFAO = Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, MAFF = Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and \nFisheries, MOE = Ministry of Environment, MRC = Mekong River Commission, UNFPA = United Nations Population \nFund, WCS = World Conservation Society. \n \n5.  The metadata necessary to establish the TSBR-ED, which will form a crucial part of the \noverall TSBR-ED and be used as main tool to stimulate information exchange, follows: \n(i)  directory of existing specialized databases, literature, and documentation on the \nTonle Sap region; \n(ii)  directory of NGOs working in the Tonle Sap region; \n(iii)  directory of international aid agencies involved in the Tonle Sap region; \n(iv)  directory of previous and ongoing projects in the Tonle Sap region; and \n(v)  directory of Tonle Sap literature. \n \n ", "36  Appendix 5 \nc.  Establishing and Maintaining a TSBR Web Site \n \n6.  The TSBR web site will serve as the official web-based information desk of the TSBR. \nAlthough Internet access for the general public in the Tonle Sap region is still very limited, it is \nexpected that Internet-based information and communication will develop rapidly in Cambodia \nand that the number of people who can access the TSBR web site will increase very quickly. \nProject activities will include: (i) providing detailed information on the Tonle Sap ecosystem, \nincluding its biodiversity, socioeconomic, and cultural characteristics; management settings; and \ndevelopment challenges; (ii) providing related public domain documents on natural resource \nmanagement, including the metadata identified, and developing a service to enable registered \nmembers  to  download  restricted  documents;  (iii)  linking  with  other  important  web  sites, \nparticularly those on biosphere reserve practices, including UNESCO's MABnet and Southeast \nAsian Biosphere Reserve Network (SeaBRnet); (iv) providing an interactive service to answer \ninquiries and a news desk to announce events on the TSBR; (v) incorporating educational \ninformation; and (vi) arranging an easy-to-maintain technical setup for the web site.2 \n \nd.  Developing TSBR Publications on Environment and Development \n \n7.  Some  public-oriented  publications  will  be  developed  in  the  TSBR-ED,  as  often  as \npossible in association with other projects in the Tonle Sap region. The publications will be in \nprinted  form  or  on  CD-ROM.  Related  project  activities  will  include  designing,  preparing, \npublishing, and distributing the following products: \n(i)  a bimonthly newsletter, titled Tonle Sap Update\u2014Bulletin of the TSBR. This will \nbe a simple product of 2\u20134 pages, focusing on management and development in \nthe Tonle Sap; \n(ii)  a Tonle Sap Environment and Development Data Report, prepared by the TSBR \nSecretariat,  with  the  support  of  the  TSBR-ED.  This  product  will  be  issued \nannually and will be used as Cambodia\u2019s official environmental data report for the \nTonle  Sap.  It  will  also  serve  as  a  long-standing  record  for  monitoring  and \nevaluation.  New  information  will  be  added  and  corrections  made  as \nimplementation of projects in the Tonle Sap region progresses, and \n(iii)  the five directories in para. 5. \n \ne.  Establishing a Documentation Center \n \n8.  The  TSBR-ED  will  house  a  documentation  center  to  collect  and  organize  related \ndocuments such as books, special publications, survey reports, workshop reports, seminar \nproceedings, and project documents. First and foremost, the documentation center will serve \nthe TSBR Secretariat and the executing and implementing agencies involved in the Project. It \nwill then be opened to other Government agencies, institutions, and NGOs. The documentation \ncenter will use UNESCO library software such as CDS-ISIS or WinISIS for management.3 \nProject activities will include documentation collection, categorization, indexing, management, \nand servicing. \n \n                                                 \n2  It is more cost-effective to use existing web site holders in Phnom Penh. It is also possible for UNESCO to host the \nweb pages, at least initially. \n3  This UNESCO software has been used in libraries and documentation centers around the world for more than 15 \nyears. Some training in its use will be given. \n   ", "  Appendix 5  37 \n3.  Other Considerations \n \n9.  Operational Strategy. The Project will aim to deliver TSBR-ED services as quickly as \npossible. The TSBR web site, the bimonthly newsletter, and the five directories will be moved \nrapidly into service. They will be consolidated and improved thereafter. Database development \nwill focus first on core data and extend gradually to other data attributes. \n \n10.  Client Targeting. Project beneficiaries will include Government agencies, bilateral and \nmultilateral institutions, NGOs, and the general public. They all need general information on the \nTonle Sap. Three categories will enjoy specific TSBR-ED services: \n(i)  Government  and  donor  agencies.  This  category  includes  line  ministries \nconcerned with the Tonle Sap, provincial government offices, and the agencies \ninvolved in the Tonle Sap region. Given the responsibility of these bodies in \nmanagement  and  development  planning,  policy  work,  law  interpretation  and \nenforcement,  and  governance,  the  TSBR-ED\u2019s  main  tasks  for  this  group  of \nbeneficiaries will include: (a) collecting and providing the major national and \ninternational legal and policy documents of relevance to the Tonle Sap and the \nTSBR;4 (b) collecting and facilitating exchange of documents on TSBR-related \nprojects or meetings supported by the Government and aid agencies with prior \nagreement with the agencies concerned;5 (c) providing basic but comprehensive \nand updated conservation, environmental, natural resource, and socioeconomic \ndata through established databases;6 and (d) providing a comprehensive index or \nmeta-database  about  other  existing  specialized  databases  hosted  by  other \norganizations, as well as literature and documentation. \n(ii)  Civil society. This category includes all sectors of society, in particular, local \nvillage councils, schools, and the private sector. Through the TSBR web site and \npublications,  the  TSBR-ED  will  provide  information  services  on:  (a)  the \nregulations and policies regarding natural resource management in the TSBR; \n(b) the values, characteristics, and sustainability of the Tonle Sap ecosystem; (c) \nthe  environmental  and  developmental  problems  encountered  and  the \nenvironmental status of the Tonle Sap; (d) previous and ongoing efforts for \nnatural resource management in the TSBR; (e) new development opportunities \nconcerning the TSBR; (f) traditional knowledge and best practices for natural \nresource  management,  as  well  as  examples  of  unsustainable  uses;  (g)  a \ndirectory of institutions and NGOs that may be contacted to support community \ndevelopment;  (h)  a  metadatabase  on  other  existing  specialized  databases, \nincluding  literature  and  documentation;  and  (j)  environmental  education  and \nawareness. \n(iii)  NGOs. Many NGOs work in the Tonle Sap region. They deal with a broad range \nof  issues,  including  wildlife  protection,  conservation,  research,  environment, \ncommunity organization and development, education, health, and empowerment \nof women. These NGOs will be substantial contributors of data for collection, \ndistribution, and verification. They will be a major group of clients targeted by the \n                                                 \n4  For instance, basic documents on the Seville Strategy for Biosphere Reserves, 1995; the Statutory Framework of \nthe World Network of Biosphere Reserves; the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild \nFauna and Flora (CITES), 1979; and the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as \nWaterfowl Habitat (the Ramsar Convention), 1971. \n5  Much data and information will not be in the public domain. Rules and policies for exchange and distribution will be \ndeveloped and applied. \n6  This data is usually descriptive. After establishment of the TSBR-ED, a basic GIS capacity will be made available \nfor additional information support, notably through annual publication of environmental data. \n ", "38  Appendix 5 \nTSBR-ED, together with university departments in Cambodia. In addition, the \nTSBR-ED will develop: (a) a directory of NGOs working in the Tonle Sap region; \n(b)  a  directory  of  aid  agencies  that  are  active  in  the  Tonle  Sap;  and  (c) \nmechanisms whereby NGOs can use the TSBR-ED as a conduit for exchanging \nexperience and making their expertise available. \n \n11.  Using and Linking with Existing Databases. The TSBR-ED will not duplicate existing \ndatabases. As much as it can, it will use existing data resources and pay particular attention to \nmetadatabase development. Its object will be to make information available. \n \n12.  Computer Technology. The TSBR-ED will not seek to take high-end and state-of-the-\nart equipment for routine database management and information distribution. Rather, it will use \ncommonly used technologies, such as the PC NT Server and Windows 2000 SQL Server, to \nback up its web and database service, and PC-based GIS, such as Arc-View and MapInfo, for \ngeographic data processing. This will ensure better maintenance, given the technical capacity of \nstaff  and  available  service  in  the  country.  Specific  data  processing  will  be  contracted  to \nprofessional data processing workshops in Cambodia or to other facilities in the region. This will \nensure that the TSBR Secretariat does not require too many staff or equipment. For the TSBR \nweb site, use will be made of commercial technical maintenance services. \n \n13.  Language. The TSBR-ED will use the Khmer and English languages. Attention will be \ngiven to Khmer versions of information products such as web pages, the bimonthly bulletin, and \nCD-ROMs. Arrangements will be made to translate scientific data into the Khmer language to \nmake it available for educational purposes. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  UNESCO will be appointed by direct selection to establish the TSBR-ED with assistance \nfrom its offices in Phnom Penh, Jakarta, and Paris. UNESCO's office in Phnom Penh will \ncoordinate execution. The TSBR Secretariat and UNESCO will prepare the work plan jointly and \ncarry out the detailed design and implementation of the TSBR-ED. Short-term expertise will be \nneeded for system design, standard setting and integration, development of data exchange \nmechanisms, and preparation of publications. For this, priority will be given to domestic experts. \nFor  specific  technical  tasks  such  as  field  data  collection,  data  processing,  technical \nmaintenance, publication design, and printing, subcontracts will be entered into. UNESCO's \nMan and the Biosphere Secretariat in the Division of Ecological Sciences and the Regional \nBureau of Sciences for Asia and Pacific will provide advisory services and supervise the quality \nof the TSBR-ED's services and products. \n \n   ", "  Appendix 6  39 \nFORMULATING AND IMPLEMENTING A NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION AND \nAWARENESS CAMPAIGN \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  Sustainable management and conservation of natural resources and biodiversity are a \npriority for Cambodia, which relies heavily on land, water, and biotic resources and is on the \nverge of rapid urban, industrial, and agricultural development. In such cases, environmental \npolicies should be fitted to the conditions and traditions of the country. Implementation will not \nbe successful without the active participation of all citizens, especially those who depend on \nnatural resources. \n \n2.  When Cambodia nominated in 1996 the Tonle Sap for designation by the United Nations \nEducational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO)  as  a  biosphere  reserve,  the \nGovernment recognized that the site should respond to the conservation, development, and \nlogistic functions of a biosphere reserve and that education and public awareness should be \ngiven importance. At the national level, information on conservation and sustainable use, as \npracticed in biosphere reserves, should be included in school programs and teaching manuals \nand in media efforts. At the local level, involvement of local communities should be encouraged, \ninformation for visitors should be produced, and environmental education centers should be \npromoted. \n \n3.  Since its creation in 1993, the Ministry of Environment (MOE) has worked toward such \nends.1  As  a  result,  an  Interministerial  Steering  Committee  for  Environmental  Education \n(IMSCEE) was established that year with assistance from the United Nations Development \nProgramme's (UNDP\u2019s) Environmental Technical Assistance Project (ETAP). UNESCO was \nassociated  with  related  environmental  education  activities,  particularly  with  developing \nenvironmental education materials for school curricula and producing teacher guides for primary \nand secondary schools. A special program for educating monks was also put in place. However, \nmany  of  these  activities  were  interrupted  when  ETAP  ended  in  1998.  Considering  the \nimportance of the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve (TSBR) and the severity of the threats against \nit, it is urgent that progress in environmental education and awareness continue and that a \nnational campaign be mounted in support. This would also help Cambodia to meet obligations \nunder the Convention on Biological Diversity, 1992 that stress the importance of education and \npublic awareness on biodiversity. \n \nB.  Approach to Campaign Formulation and Implementation \n \n1.  Objective and Outputs \n \n4.  The  goal  of  the  Project  is  sustainable  management  and  conservation  of  natural \nresources  and  biodiversity  in  the  Tonle  Sap  basin.  The  objective  that  formulation  and \nimplementation of a national environmental education and awareness campaign will help to \naccomplish is strengthened natural resource management coordination and planning for the \nTSBR, particularly by establishing a coordination framework and information dissemination \nmechanisms. The outputs needed to formulate and implement the campaign are as follows (i) \npublicizing  the  Tonle  Sap's  environmental  importance;  (ii)  integrating  concern  for  natural \nresources; and (iii) developing formal and nonformal environmental education. These outputs \n                                                 \n1  The Department of Environmental Education and Communication has 23 staff and four offices for education and \ntraining, communication, research and documentation, and administration. \n ", "40  Appendix 6 \nwill be defined by the target audience, i.e., the general public and the press, decision makers, \nschoolchildren (at primary and secondary levels), university students, and communities living in \nthe Tonle Sap region. \n \n2.  Key Activities by Output \n \na.  Publicizing the Tonle Sap's Environmental Importance \n \n5.  Encouraging the Press. The Cambodian Communication Institute, which is supported \nby UNESCO, will include information sessions on the environment and the Tonle Sap in its \ntraining courses. In addition, a document in the Khmer language will be distributed to the press \nto explain the significance of the TSBR and publicize efforts to enhance systems and develop \nthe capacity for natural resource management coordination and planning, community-based \nnatural resource management, and biodiversity conservation in the TSBR. Periodic information \nconferences for journalists will also be organized. Full use will be made of the TSBR web site to \nbe developed in the TSBR environmental information database (TSBR-ED). The activities will \nbe undertaken in close cooperation with the Ministry of Information. \n \n6.  Enhancing  Public  Awareness.  In  rural  areas,  access  to  television  is  still  limited. \nHowever, collective television watching is a common practice. A series of spots on the Tonle \nSap  will  be  produced  and  a  quiz  show  will  be  launched  on  the  subject  of  biodiversity \nconservation in the Tonle Sap. An image bank on the Tonle Sap will be created and made \navailable to the press. Radio programs will be encouraged for coverage in Cambodia is wide \nand reaches remote rural areas. Regular short broadcasts about environmental issues will be \nlaunched. To reach the general public, special events will be organized on the theme of the \nTonle Sap\u2014theater plays, contests, and traveling exhibits.2 Existing events such as the Water \nFestival, the National Environment Day, and the Clean Up Day will also present opportunities for \na special focus on the Tonle Sap.3 Participatory activities such as tree planting campaigns will \nbe  encouraged  and  should  receive  enough  press  coverage  to  have  a  pedagogic  impact. \nAdditionally, use of the pagoda network will provide a way to reach communities, especially in \nremote areas. Pagodas are present in almost every commune of the country. They are places \nwhere people meet and often include libraries and primary schools. UNESCO implemented a \nCommunity Temple Learning Center Program in Siem Reap and Battambang in 1994\u20131999. \nThe structure of that program proved to be particularly appropriate for non-formal education: \n20,000 people completed basic literacy courses, 1,500 completed skill training courses, and \n1,500 young children received basic instruction. This network will be used to disseminate \ninformation on the environment. The emerging network of community learning centers will also \nbe used. \n \nb.  Integrating Concern for Natural Resources \n \n7.  Informing Decision Makers. Establishment under the Project of a web site in the \nTSBR-ED and production of a bimonthly newsletter, titled Tonle Sap Update\u2014Bulletin of the \nTSBR will help to inform decision makers. The document\u2014prepared to explain the significance \nof the TSBR, and publicize efforts to enhance systems and develop the capacity for natural \nresource  management  coordination  and  planning,  community-based  natural  resource \nmanagement, and biodiversity conservation in the TSBR\u2014will be distributed to ministries and \n                                                 \n2  The exhibit on the Tonle Sap produced by Krousar Thmey, and supported by UNESCO, could serve as the basis \nfor traveling exhibits. \n3  One of the Peace Walks organized each year could be organized around the Tonle Sap, starting from Angkor. \n   ", "  Appendix 6  41 \ninstitutions at the national, provincial, and local levels. Workshops on issues and problems \nrelated to management of the Tonle Sap will be organized on an ad hoc basis. \n \n8.  Establishing a Forum for Discussion. The IMSCEE, which was established in 1996 \nand discontinued in December 1998, will be reactivated and the Ministry of Information will be \nadded to its original members.4 The IMSCEE will meet once a year to discuss environmental \neducation and awareness issues related to the Tonle Sap and to set targets. The TSBR \nSecretariat will act as its secretariat. \n \nc.  Developing Formal and Nonformal Environmental Education \n \n9.  Preparing Educational Materials. As part of ETAP (with assistance from UNESCO), a \nteacher\u2019s manual for primary schools was prepared and distributed in 1998. At the secondary \nschool level, five of the nine training modules prepared by UNESCO's Asia Pacific Center of \nEducational Innovation for Development in Bangkok were translated into the Khmer language \nand distributed through the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports. Recently, a set of posters \nproduced by UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Secretariat in Paris were translated into \nthe  Khmer  language  and  published.  They  are  now  being  tested  among  teachers.  Much \nadditional material, such as the School Teacher's Guide on the Environment or MOE's Green \nBook  remain  unpublished  or  not  distributed.  Previous  and  ongoing  work  in  preparing \neducational materials will be examined with a view to completing or extending it. The formal \nmonk  education  program  initiated  by  ETAP  will  also  be  continued  after  considering \nrecommendations from a national workshop held in 1998. Moreover, the status of a manual for \nBuddhist primary school teachers, which was being prepared then, will be examined for possible \ncompletion. In addition, awareness and use of the TSBR web site will be promoted in schools \nthat have access to the Internet. \n \n10.  Improving the Training of Teachers. Training of teachers remains a priority. Four \nteacher-training centers are located in Battambang, Kompong Chhnang, Kompong Thom, and \nSiem Reap. At least two training sessions per annum, each for 20 teachers, will be organized in \neach center. A field visit to the Tonle Sap will be part of the training. This means that 160 \nteachers (from primary and secondary schools) will be trained each year. The schools from \nwhich they originate will serve as pilot sites for the environmental education and awareness \ncampaign, taking into account the school cluster system. In addition, training and field visits will \nbe organized for teachers in schools within the TSBR, particularly those teaching in the floating \nvillages. \n \n11.  Fostering Nonformal Education Activities. Nongovernment organizations undertake \nmany nonformal education activities. Their activities will be studied with a view to extending or \nreplicating them. Teachers will be encouraged to include nonformal education activities to \ncomplement the formal school system. Schools in the TSBR will be involved in more interactive \nactivities, including production of material by children (including audiovisual material when \npossible) as well as drawing and painting competitions.  Field visits to the Tonle Sap will be \norganized for children. \n \n12.  Expanding Environmental Training at Phnom  Penh University. Two years ago, a \nDepartment of Environment was established in Phnom Penh University. Under the Project, its \nstudents will receive special training on hydrology and wetlands ecology. Field visits will also be \norganized to encourage students to undertake studies on the Tonle Sap. UNESCO, through its \n                                                 \n4  They were MOE; the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports; and the Ministry of Religion and Cults. \n ", "42  Appendix 6 \nWorld Network of Biosphere Reserves, will facilitate exchange of students between Cambodia \nand other countries of the Asian and Pacific region endowed with biosphere reserves.5 \n \n3.  Methodology \n \n13.  Wherever  possible,  project  activities  will  complement  ongoing  initiatives.6  For  that \nreason, a survey will assess existing networks, activities, and materials, and identify additional \nrequirements. This is especially important for teaching materials. Capacity building also implies \nthat  the  Project  will  make  maximum  use  of  national  counterparts  and  that  the  role  of \ninternational experts will be kept to a minimum. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  UNESCO will be appointed by direct selection to implement the national environmental \neducation and awareness campaign with the Department of Environmental Education and \nCommunication  within  MOE.  Designated  focal  points  will  be  identified  in  each  concerned \nministry  to  ensure  that  the  project  activities  defined  for  each  ministry  are  undertaken  on \nschedule. UNESCO\u2019s office in Phnom Penh will be responsible for implementation, in close \nassociation  with  UNESCO\u2019s  office  in  Bangkok.  UNESCO\u2019s office in Jakarta and the MAB \nSecretariat in Paris will backstop activities as appropriate. It is foreseen that the preparatory \nphase of the campaign will last 6 months and that the campaign itself will spread over the \nremaining project implementation period. \n                                                 \n5 The World Network fosters exchanges between biosphere reserves and facilitates cooperative activities, including \nscientific research and monitoring, environmental education, and specialist training. \n6  These include initiatives carried out by the floating environmental center (Greater Environment Chong Khneas \nOffice  [GECKO])  funded  under  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  of  the  United  Nation\u2019s  project  for \nParticipatory Natural Resources Management in the Tonle Sap Region: Osmose; the Wildlife Conservation \nSociety; the Cambodian Family Development Service; and Leucaena. \n   ", "  Appendix 7  43 \nGENERAL APPROACH TO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION \n \n1.  Project activities to organize communities for natural resource management in the Tonle \nSap Biosphere Reserve (TSBR) will concentrate in the first year on appointing, in each of the \nfive project provinces, the incremental staff required in the Department of Agriculture, Forestry, \nand Fisheries and the Department of Environment; improving office facilities; and identifying \nqualified nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to facilitate community organization. The Food \nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) will be appointed by direct selection to \nprovide long-term advisory support.1 \n \n2.  From  the  beginning  of  the  second  year,  in  each  project  province,  16  staff  of  the \nDepartment of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries; 4 staff of the Department of Environment, \nand 4\u20135 staff of the NGOs identified will be trained in participatory approaches, development of \ncriteria for selecting communities to organize, community organization, participatory land use \nplanning, and preparation of natural resource management plans.2 This staff will be sensitized \nto gender-and-development concerns. FAO will conduct the required training through on-the-job \ntraining, workshops, and seminars. \n \n3.  The Project will collect baseline information on communities to prioritize them, taking \naccount of the particular needs of structures already  set up for community-based natural \nresource management.3 Information on communities collected in the process of prioritizing \ntargets will also serve for project monitoring and evaluation. \n \n4.  Organizing communities for natural resource management will begin with training and \nadvice to promote their cohesion. The rights, responsibilities, and customs of each community \nstructure will be elaborated and individual responsibilities will be clarified. By the beginning of \nthe second year, the process of boundary definition and delineation will have begun using \nground survey techniques and the orthophotomaps produced under the Project, as they become \navailable.  Areas  of  communal  use,  including  designated  protection  areas  and  local  fish \nsanctuaries, will be delineated and boundaries proposed for agreement through a participatory \nconsultative process. Local techniques for demarcating key boundaries will be applied. \n \n5.  Once the community structures are established, weekly meetings will be held with \nleaders, members of village communities, representatives of households with female heads, \nand representatives of poor households to familiarize them with the objective, components, and \noutputs of the Project; the 5-year Tonle Sap fisheries management plan; and the evolving \nregulatory framework. The meetings will also offer advice on their natural resource base, the \n                                                 \n1  Specifically, FAO will: (i) conduct, in consultation with NGOs and in a spirit of shared decision making, a review of \nprevious approaches to community organization that have been applied in the Project area, for example by FAO \nand the Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit; (ii) refine, in consultation with NGOs, the preferred \napproach with reference to the indicative approach given here; (iii) detail, in consultation with NGOs, project \nactivities to organize communities for natural resource management; (iv) marshal staff of the provincial line \nagencies and the NGOs required in the field; and (v) generally manage the process of organizing communities for \nnatural resource management in the TSBR. In refining the preferred approach, FAO will prepare a comprehensive \nmethodology and work plan and establish an integrated management system comprising management tools such \nas hierarchy of objectives, tree analysis, stakeholder analysis, project (logical) framework, work breakdown \nstructure, bar chart, Gantt chart, organization responsibility chart, and individual task chart. \n2  Preferably, at least half of the staff from each Department of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries will be drawn from \nthe Community Fisheries Development Unit. \n3  This baseline information will relate, for instance, to livelihoods, income earning activities, levels of conflict over \naccess to natural resources, conflict resolution mechanisms, nature of indebtedness, households with female \nheads, ethnic minorities, gender divisions of labor, patterns of control over fisheries activities, and training and \nextension needs. \n ", "44  Appendix 7 \nrights of different groups of users (which will need to be identified and documented using a \nvariety of methods), their roles and responsibilities as community members, the benefits of \nequal participation by women, the need to form community bylaws, and conflict resolution \nmechanisms. These weekly meetings will require that staff travel to the villages at times that suit \nthe  schedules  of  each  community.  Approximately  6  months  will  be  required  before  the \ncommunity agrees on the approach to community-based natural resource management and \nsufficient capacity is created among community leaders for them to undertake such functions as \npatrolling, monitoring, accounting, and bookkeeping. Thereafter, staff will continue to interact to \nencourage communities to formulate natural resource management plans and build the capacity \nof women to participate in decision making. \n \n6.  Toward the end of the second year, staff in each project province will hold a participatory \nworkshop to publicize the results of community organization and encourage feedback. From the \nthird year, the Project will extend its reach to other communities. At the same time, however, \nstaff  will  have  to  backstop  the  communities  organized  earlier.  Project  staff  will  need  to \ncontinuously work in the field in training and extension at the village level, training women\u2019s \ngroups for full participation, developing the knowledge and skills of the members of community \nfisheries and community forestry groups, training the community in participatory demarcation of \narea boundaries, developing dynamic rules and regulations that will reflect changing scenarios \nas  community-based  management  systems  become  stronger,  developing  resource \ndemarcation, and evolving strategies for natural resource management over time. \n \n   ", "  Appendix 8  45 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES SECTOR \nAmount \nProject Title  Duration  Source  Objectives  Area of Operation \n(million) \nEnvironment and Natural Resources     \nManagement of  Ongoing  MRC,  To study socioeconomics and    $2.3  National \nthe Freshwater  Denmark  community organization for improved \nCapture Fisheries  management \nof Cambodia \nAssessment of  Ongoing  MRC  To collect data on ecology and    \u2014  Mekong region \nMekong Fisheries  socioeconomics for use in planning \nwater management projects and in the \ndesign of fisheries management \nsystems \nAquaculture of  Ongoing  MRC  To develop aquaculture systems to    \u2014  Mekong region \nIndigenous  explore the feasibility of breeding \nMekong Fish  indigenous fish species \nSpecies \nStrengthening  2001\u20132004  MRC  To establish databases for (i) national    \u2014  Tonle Sap \nInland Fisheries  Mekong Basin capture and culture \nManagement  fisheries, and (ii) regional capture and \nSystems  culture fisheries;

THE REGULATORY AND MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK FOR INLAND \nFISHERIES \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The Government of Cambodia marked a bold step forward when, in October 2000, it \nreleased a large part of the Tonle Sap's fishing lots for community management. This decision \ngave impetus to the reform of the regulatory framework for inland fisheries. Work toward a new \nlaw on fishery conservation, management, and development had begun in August 1999 (with \nassistance from the World Bank) and a draft was made available in August 2001. Nevertheless, \nmost observers have felt, in light of the far-reaching implications of that law and the sensitive \nnature of any change affecting community fisheries, that stakeholders should subject the draft to \ncritical review. Much additional harmonized legislation also needs to be formulated and the \nDepartment of Fisheries (DOF) in the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF) is \nstruggling to keep up with the menu of regulatory reform in a transparent and consultative way, \nespecially in the absence of a management plan for the Tonle Sap. \n \nB.  Issues \n \n2.  The fishing lot system was introduced in colonial times and has tended  to dominate \ninland  fisheries.1  While  a  potentially  powerful  and  effective  fisheries  and  natural  resource \nmanagement tool, the fishing lot system has become increasingly inequitable, divisive, and \ndestructive. On 24 October 2000, in the face of long-running conflict between local communities \nand fishing lot operators, a Prime Ministerial decree released 56% of the total fishing lot area \nfrom private holdings and turned them over to communities for management.2 In the long term, \nthis change should benefit the population living near inland water bodies, improve fish habitats, \nand lead to sustainable management of fisheries and other natural resources. But the reform \nprocess was driven by prime ministerial decree, and not the result of policy development. The \nidentification and delineation of areas of fishing lots for community-based management have \nbeen difficult. Communities have not always been sufficiently involved in this process nor \nproperly informed of changes, and there are reports of irregularities. In certain locations, local \nauthorities  and  armed  forces  interfere  with  legitimate  resource  users  from  communities \nattempting to fish in these lots, even to the extent of arresting them and taking them to court. As \nthe process of redefinition evolves, rapid changes are also occurring in practices that impact \nfisheries and other natural resources. The reform process is also placing a considerable burden \non DOF, which suffers from low levels of capacity. Aside from its stated objective for fisheries \nmanagement, ti has little management vision and focuses, understandably, on maintaining \nexisting procedures and methods.3 What is more, the absence of a fisheries management plan \nfor  the  Tonle  Sap  hampers  the  work  on  the  draft  Fisheries  Law  and  the  subdecrees, \nproclamations, and directives or circulars associated with it. \n                                                 \n1  Fishing lots are auctioned every 2 years to individuals who operate the lots themselves or sublease them to others. \n2  To facilitate this radical change, DOF then established a Community Fisheries Development Office, charged with \npromoting and supporting community-based management of natural resources. \n3  DOF's objective is to manage Cambodia's fisheries in a sustainable manner to improve the livelihood and nutrition \nof the people and to increase aquaculture production. \n ", "Appendix 14     63 \n1.  Improving the Regulatory Framework \n \n3.  There is an urgent need to provide a sound legal basis for fisheries, especially inland. \nSeveral subdecrees already have been prepared and some may be implemented before the \nadoption of the Fisheries Law. However, hasty enactment should be avoided. Some existing \ndrafts have been criticized and need to be reviewed for relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, and \nequity so as to achieve sustainable management and conservation of natural resources and \nbiodiversity. Among these are subdecrees that have special relevance to the Tonle Sap, such \nas those on community fisheries and management of fishing lots. Their preparation should be \norganic and grow out of experience, local practice, potentialities, and needs. In general, a \npositive approach to ensuring compliance with the law is preferable to a negative approach that \nrequires policing action. Experience demonstrates that negative approaches encourage bribery \nand extortion, not compliance. The need to consult stakeholders should also be recognized \nearly in the drafting and review process: consultation at both national and local levels should be \nstandard operating procedure. \n \n2.  Improving the Management Framework \n \n4.  A 5-year Tonle Sap fisheries management plan is essential to sustainable management \nand conservation of natural resources and biodiversity: most management issues transcend \nlocal  responsibilities  or  competences,  with  repercussions  on  the  ecosystem.  A  fisheries \nmanagement plan will provide a policy and technical framework and incorporate principles for \necosystem management, inasmuch as fishing takes place in different zones (i.e., community \nfisheries, fishing lots, protected areas, and open waters). It will also feed into the common policy \nobjectives for the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve (TSBR) that are to be formulated by the TSBR \nSecretariat in the Cambodia National Mekong Committee. At the local level, the plan will provide \nthe framework for developing commercial and community fisheries management plans. The \npreparation and regular updating of fisheries management plans are a legal requirement in \nmany countries: such plans complement and influence the regulatory framework in a dynamic \nand adaptive manner.1 \n \nC.  The Technical Assistance \n \n1.  Objective \n \n5.  The goal of the technical assistance (TA) is sustainable management and conservation \nof natural resources and biodiversity in the Tonle Sap basin. Its objective is to improve the \nregulatory  and  management  framework  for  inland  fisheries,  with  special  attention  to  the \nsubdecree on community fisheries. \n \n2.  Methodology \n \n6.  To improve the regulatory framework, the methodology for the TA will follow a step-by-\nstep  process  of  stocktaking,  drafting,  and  validation  involving  stakeholders  at  national, \nprovincial,  and  local  levels.  Stocktaking  will  involve  organizing  four  national  technical \nconsultations. Validation will involve organizing four national consultations aimed at discussing \nand validating draft reports. To improve the management framework, the methodology for the \nTA will lay stress on close collaboration with a Tonle Sap Fisheries Management Task Force to \n                                                 \n1  Indeed, the Master Plan for Fisheries (2001-2011) in Cambodia (prepared with assistance from the World Bank) \nrefers explicitly to the need to develop management plans for Cambodia's main fisheries bodies. \n ", "64  Appendix 14 \nbe nominated before inception of the TA. It will also emphasize hands-on training of counterpart \nstaff,  simultaneous  presence  of  specialists,  thorough  preparation,  and  maintaining  the \nmomentum of the delivery of key activities. \n \n3.  Key Activities by Output \n \na.  Improving the Regulatory Framework \n \n7.  Key activities relate to the following: \n(i)  Mobilizing specialists and conducting basic research on information (including \nidentifying and collating laws and subdecrees); \n(ii)  Reviewing  the  management  of  commercial,  community,  and  other  important \nfisheries in the Tonle Sap; \n(iii)  Laying  out  an  approach  to  improving  the  regulatory  framework  for  inland \nfisheries;  drafting  a  preliminary  report  setting  out  the  scope  of  the  existing \nregulatory  framework,  challenges,  and  opportunities;  and  making  initial \nrecommendations at a legal consultative and training forum; \n(iii)  Articulating a time frame for the review of draft laws, subdecrees, proclamations, \nand  directives  or  circulars  related  to  inland  fisheries,  in  particular  a  draft \nsubdecree  or  amendment  to  any  subdecree  on  community  fisheries \nmanagement; \n(v)  Refining the approach to improving the regulatory framework for inland fisheries \nbased on responses at the legal consultative and training forum; \n(v)  Conducting further consultations culminating in a legal consultative and training \nforum in which draft laws, subdecrees, proclamations, and directives or circulars \nrelated to inland fisheries, as amended after the consultative process, will be \npresented; \n(vii)  Drafting a final report setting out final draft laws, subdecrees, proclamations, and \ndirectives or circulars related to inland fisheries; and \n(viii)  Consolidating training to increase legislative awareness in DOF. \n \nb.  Improving the Management Framework \n \n8.  Key activities relate to the following: \n(i)  Establishing a Tonle Sap Fisheries Management Task Force in DOF; \n(ii)  Reviewing and evaluating documentation and information on fisheries resources; \npast and current fisheries management frameworks and practices, especially \nwith respect to access conditions, fishing regulations, monitoring, compliance, \nand enforcement; national and sectoral policies and priorities, taking into account \nall sectors relevant to the management of the Tonle Sap; development trends; \ncommunity organization; livelihood systems; and other socioeconomic aspects \nrelevant to the management of the Tonle Sap's fisheries; \n(iii)  Conducting  consultations  on  community  fisheries  management,  commercial \nfisheries management, and Tonle Sap fisheries management in general; \n(iv)  Preparing a draft diagnosis, and broad-based and fisheries-specific management \nprinciples; \n(v)  Validating the draft diagnosis and management principles through consultation \nand fieldwork; \n(vi)  Organizing  provincial-level  group  discussions  on  the  draft  diagnosis  and \nmanagement principles with representative stakeholders; \n ", "Appendix 14     65 \n(vii)  Conducting complementary consultations for further elaboration of the Tonle Sap \nfisheries management plan; \n(viii)  Drafting a 5-year Tonle Sap fisheries management plan (including guidelines for \ncommunity fisheries management and a code of conduct); \n(ix)  Organizing group discussions on the Tonle Sap fisheries management plan at \nlocal, provincial, and national levels with representative stakeholders; and \n(x)  Finalizing the Tonle Sap fisheries management plan and transmitting it to the \nTSBR Secretariat. \n \n4.  Cost Estimates \n \n9.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $634,000, comprising a foreign exchange cost of \n$396,000 and a local currency cost of $238,000 equivalent. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $540,000 equivalent, including the entire foreign exchange cost and $144,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent \nto  $94,000,  largely  providing  office  accommodation  and  remuneration  and  per  diem  of \ncounterpart staff, as laid out in the cost estimates and financing plan for the TA. \n \n5.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  The TA will require about 19 person-months of international and about 41 person-\nmonths of domestic expertise with legal and management experience in the fisheries sector, \nparticularly inland fisheries.2 The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) \nwill be appointed by direct selection to deliver the services required.3 The TA will be managed \nas a collaborative exercise by ADB and FAO following the long-standing working arrangements \nbetween them.4 The methodology and terms of reference for the TA are specific and clearly \nidentified. Hence, ADB's procedures for simplified technical proposals will be used as the basis \nfor contract negotiation. In the event that it is necessary to engage experts outside of FAO, the \nexperts will be engaged in accordance with ADB's  Guidelines on the  Use of Consultants. \nEquipment will be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. To facilitate \nimplementation, DOF will provide logistical support to FAO, including adequately furnished \noffice space and access to communications facilities. DOF will also provide copies of relevant \nlaws, regulations, policies, reports, and other documents. FAO's team will be based in Phnom \nPenh, but will be expected to travel to the five project provinces, particularly during stakeholder \nconsultations. The Executing Agency for the TA will be DOF. \n \n11.  DOF will establish a Tonle Sap Fisheries Management Task Force headed by the \ndirector  of  DOF  and  comprising  representatives  of  MAFF;  the  Community  Fisheries \nDevelopment Office in DOF; the Policy, Strategy, and Networking Division to be strengthened in \nthe  TSBR  Secretariat;  the  offices  of  fisheries  in  the  five  project  provinces\u2014Battambang, \nKompong Chhnang, Kompong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap; and the Legal Committee in \n                                                 \n2  The team will comprise international and domestic fisheries experts with experience in fisheries law, fisheries \nmanagement, fisheries biology, resource planning and inland fisheries, community organization, and training. \n3  FAO is well qualified to undertake the tasks required. Its Legal Office has considerable experience in giving legal \nadvisory services. These services include assistance to prepare laws, regulations, agreements, and other legal \ntexts; advice on institutional structures and compliance with international law; and capacity building through \nparticipatory training of national officials. Its Fisheries Department has considerable experience in promoting \nefficient, sustainable, and responsible fisheries. \n4  The main elements of these working arrangements are described in a Memorandum of Understanding between \nADB and FAO appended to Doc. R77-81 (4 August 1981). \n ", "66  Appendix 14 \nMAFF. The experts will report to the Task Force and seek its guidance. The Task Force will play \na key role in organizing the technical consultations, legal validation consultations, and the \nenvisaged provincial workshops. Members of the Task Force are expected to be the core group \nof persons who will benefit from on-the-job training under the TA. At the end of the TA, the Task \nForce  will  continue  to  meet  regularly  to  monitor  fisheries  management,  advise  on  the \nimplementation  of  legal  instruments  and  various  elements  of  the  Tonle  Sap  fisheries \nmanagement plan, and prepare 5-yearly updates of the plan. \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months from January 2003. FAO will produce (i) an \ninception  report  within  4  weeks  of  the  commencement  of  the  TA;  (ii)  a  draft  regulatory \nframework report and a draft Tonle Sap fisheries management plan report 16 weeks after \ncommencement; (iii) a final regulatory framework report and a Tonle Sap fisheries management \nplan report 1 year after commencement; and (iv) an assignment completion report, outlining \nprogress and any steps to be taken at the end of the TA. On its part, DOF will complete a TA \ncompletion questionnaire to report on the value-added of the TA and describe how it will build \non it. \n \n ", "  Appendix 14  67 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nIndicators/Targets \nGoal       \nSustainable management and  Regulatory and management  Technical assistance (TA)   \nconservation of natural  framework for inland fisheries  performance audit report \nresources and biodiversity in  is in place, functioning, and \nthe Tonle Sap Basin  regularly reviewed. \nObjective       \nTo improve the regulatory and  A regulatory framework is  Project framework  The Government is committed \nmanagement framework for  developed.    to reforming the regulatory \ninland fisheries    TA completion report  and management framework \nA 5-year Tonle Sap fisheries    for inland fisheries. \nmanagement plan is prepared.

Introduction \n \n1.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  be  delivered  by  a  multidisciplinary  team  of \ninternational and domestic experts following a consultative process at provincial and national \nlevels. The experts will work in close collaboration with the Department of Fisheries (DOF). \nEmphasis will be given to hands-on training of counterparts to ensure that the skills imparted \nare put to productive use. The activities will be phased and coordinated in a manner that will \nallow, to the extent possible, simultaneous presence of the experts in the field, adequate \npreparation of the key activities, and maintenance of momentum in delivery of the TA. \n \n2.  The TA will be implemented in two phases over 12 months. In the first phase (6 months), \nthe experts will: (i) identify, review, and evaluate all relevant available data and information \nrelating to the Tonle Sap\u2019s fisheries; (ii) set out a timeframe for the review of draft laws and \nsubsidiary legislation, in particular the draft subdecree on community fisheries management; \nand  (iii)  organize  preliminary  stakeholder  consultation.  The  second  phase  (6  months)  will \ninvolve: (i) preparation and review of a draft Tonle Sap fisheries management plan and legal \ntexts through a consultative process including further stakeholder participation; (ii) submission of \na final draft Tonle Sap fisheries management plan and legal texts to relevant government \nauthorities; and (iii) preparation, review, and submission of systems for public access and \ndissemination of legal information. \n \nB.  Activities \n \n1.  Initial Activities \n \n3.  The  experts  will:  (i)  compile,  review,  and  evaluate  existing  documentation  and \ninformation on past and current fisheries management frameworks and practices, especially \nwith respect to access conditions, fishing regulations, monitoring, compliance and enforcement, \nnational and sectoral policies and priorities, taking into account all sectors relevant to the \nmanagement  of  the  Tonle  Sap;  regional  development  trends,  community  organization, \nlivelihoods and other socioeconomic aspects relevant to the management of the Tonle Sap's \nfisheries; the effectiveness of current fisheries laws and regulations (including draft laws) in (a) \nthe  formulation  and  implementation  of  national  fisheries  policies  (b)  the  management, \ndevelopment, and regulation of the fisheries sector, particularly the inland fisheries sector; (c) \ncommunity-based fisheries management; (d) monitoring, compliance, and enforcement; and (e) \nother relevant matters; (ii) set out a time frame for the review of draft laws and subsidiary \nlegislation, in particular the draft subdecree on community fisheries management; and (iii) \nfacilitate preliminary stakeholder consultation. \n \n2.  Improving the Regulatory Framework \n \n4.  In the first phase of developing a sound regulatory framework for inland fisheries, the \nexperts will facilitate: (i) consultative processes that will review the management of commercial, \ncommunity, and other important fisheries in the Tonle Sap; (ii) prepare an inception report that \nwill (a) set out the scope of the existing regulatory framework, challenges, and opportunities, \nand (b) present a time frame for the review of draft laws, subdecrees, proclamations, and \ndirectives or circulars related to inland fisheries, in particular a draft subdecree or amendment to \nany subdecree on community fisheries management. Commentaries at the legal consultative \nand training forum will be used to refine the approach to improving the regulatory framework. \n ", "  Appendix 14  71 \nThe first phase will culminate in the interim report describing preliminary findings and presenting \nrecommendations  for  revisions  considered  necessary  in  the  work  plan.  The  preliminary \nrecommendations will include draft laws, decrees or amendments to laws, and subsidiary \nlegislation) to be presented at a legal consultative and training forum. \n \n5.  The second phase will involve (i) further consultations culminating in a legal consultative \nand training forum where the draft fisheries law or subsidiary legislation as amended after the \nfirst consultative process will be presented; (ii) follow-up activities including production of a final \nreport setting out draft final fisheries legal texts with necessary subsidiary legislation, and \nsubmission of final legal texts to relevant authorities; (iii) a draft regulatory framework report and \na final regulatory framework report; and (iv) consolidation of consultation and training, and \ndevelopment of public access and information systems to increase legislative awareness and to \nfacilitate enforcement. \n \n3.  Improving the Management Framework \n \n6.  The  initial  activities  in  developing  a  5-year  Tonle  Sap  fisheries  management  plan \n(inclusive of community fisheries documentation) will include: (i) establishment of a Tonle Sap \nFisheries Management Task Force in DOF; (ii) review and evaluation of documentation and \ninformation on (a) fisheries resources; (b) past and current fisheries management frameworks \nand practices, especially with respect to access conditions, fishing regulations, monitoring, \ncompliance  and  enforcement;  (c)  national  and  sectoral  policies  and  priorities,  taking  into \naccount all sectors relevant to the management of the Tonle Sap; (d) development trends, \ncommunity organization, livelihood systems, and other socioeconomic aspects relevant to the \nmanagement  of  the  Tonle  Sap's  fisheries;  (iii)  the  conduct  of  a  consultative  process  on \ncommunity  fisheries  management  and  fishing  lot  management  mechanisms;  and  (iv) \npreparation of a draft diagnosis and validation of the draft diagnosis through consultation and \nfieldwork as appropriate. \n \n7.  The  second  phase  will  involve  the  following  activities  (i)  organization  of  group \ndiscussions of the draft diagnosis and plan principles with representative stakeholders (to be \nundertaken  at  provincial  level);  (ii)  complementary  consultation  as  required  for  further \nelaboration of the plan; (iii) finalization of a draft Tonle Sap fisheries management plan; (iv) \norganization of group discussions on the Tonle Sap fisheries management plan at the provincial \nand national levels with representative stakeholders; and (v) finalization of the Tonle Sap \nfisheries management plan in DOF and transmission to the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve \nSecretariat. \n ", "72  Appendix 15 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY1 \n \n1.  About 36% of Cambodia's 11.4 million people2 lived below the poverty line in 1997.3 The \n1998 census revealed that the five project provinces of Battambang, Kompong Chhnang, \nKompong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap have the highest incidence of poverty (38%); about 2.9 \nmillion  people  live  there  (Table  A15.1),  of  whom  more  than  1.2  million people (250,000 \nhouseholds) live in the area bordered by Highways No. 5 and No. 6.4 \nTable A15.1: Population of the Tonle Sap \nProvince  Population  Men  Women \nCambodia    11,437,656    5,511,408    5,926,268 \n  Battambang    793,129    388,599    404,530 \n  Kompong Chhnang    417,693    197,691    220,002 \n  Kompong Thom    569,060    272,844    296,216 \n  Pursat    360,445    172,890    187,555 \n  Siem Reap    696,164    336,685    359,479 \n  Tonle Sap Total    2,836,491    1,368,709    1,467,782 \nSource: General Population Census of Cambodia, 1998. \n \n2.  Poverty Profile. The socioeconomic problems affecting the five project provinces are \ncommon to most, if not all, rural areas in central and northern Cambodia. They fall into seven \nmain categories: (i) inadequate food and water and low productivity; (ii) poor health services and \nhealth status;5 (iii) low-quality shelter; (iv) low education and lack of training; (v) poor access; (vi) \nlack of savings and capital; and (vii) lack of technology and access to extension and training. \nHowever, the five provinces show some of the lowest poverty indicators (Table A15.2). \nTable A15.2: Poverty Indicators of the Tonle Sap \n(%) \nKompong  Kompong \nIndicator  Battambang  Pursat  Siem Reap \nChhnang  Thom \nHouseholds with female \n21.7  26.8  28.8  24.2  27.6 \nheads \nPrimary education not \n68.8  69.9  70.7  68.3  73.2 \ncompleted \nAccess to piped water \n3.7  0.8  1.7  2.9  0.6 \n(rural) \nAccess to electricity (rural) \n0.0  2.0  0.4  9.6  3.0 \nCooking with wood (rural) \n97.4  96.7  96.4  95.4  97.2 \nMigration within province \n70.0  78.5  82.0  76.0  82.7 \nSource: General Population Census of Cambodia, 1998. \n                                                 \n1  See also ADB. 2000. Cambodia: Enabling a Socioeconomic Renaissance. Manila. \n2 The last official census, conducted in 1962, estimated Cambodia's population at 5.7 million. At current rates, the \npopulation will rise to around 14 million by 2005. \n3  A consumption-based absolute poverty line for Cambodia has been defined as adequate income to buy a daily \n2,100-calorie food basket plus a small allowance for nonfood expenditure. This is measured at KR54,050 per \ncapita per month, or about $0.45 a day, well below the World Bank's $1 a day measure of extreme poverty. \n4  It also has the second highest average population density (52 persons per square kilometer). \n5  Abdominal  diseases  prevail  and  deepen  poverty  owing  to  increased  health  care  expenditures  and  related \nindebtedness as well as missed opportunities for earning income. \n ", "  Appendix 15  73 \n3.  Vulnerable Groups. Vulnerable groups exist in the five project provinces. They include \nwidows  and  female  heads  of  households,  the  physically  and  mentally  handicapped,  the \norphaned, landless, and the aged with no young to support them. Many demobilized soldiers \nalso seek to reintegrate in the communities. Poverty does not distinguish gender; however, \nhouseholds headed by women or households without male labor are particularly disadvantaged \n(Table A15.3). \nTable A15.3: Women and Employment in the Tonle Sap \nItems   Number   Percent \nEmployment Status     \nEmployed    564,284  69.86 \nUnemployed    9,732  1.20 \nNever employed    27,670  3.43 \nHomemaker    113,226  14.02 \nStudent    25,294  3.13 \nDependent    57,951  7.17 \nIncome recipient    6,886  0.85 \nOther    2,692  0.33 \n  Total    807,735   \nType of Employment     \nAgriculture, forestry, and hunting    478,009  83.27 \nFishing    10,140  1.77 \nManufacturing    7,896  1.38 \nWholesale and retail trade    52,818  9.20 \nPublic administration and defense    3,492  0.61 \nEducation    6,432  1.12 \nHealth and social work    2,333  0.41 \nOther community, social, and personal services    3,533  1.62 \n  Total    574,016   \nSource: General Population Census of Cambodia, 1998. \n \n4.  Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy.  There  is  a  strong  correlation \nbetween sound natural resource management and poverty reduction. The plight of the poor, \nincluding vulnerable groups, can be improved by widening their access to natural resources and \ndoing so is critical to improve living standards in the  Tonle Sap region. Conversely, sound \nmanagement of natural resources is required for sustainable development. In the last 20 years, \ntransactions involving the Tonle Sap's natural resources, especially its fisheries, have been \ncharacterized  by  inequity,  fraud,  widespread  corruption,  environmental  degradation  from \nunsustainable patterns of exploitation, and escalating conflict. Predictably, the livelihoods of the \npoor  have  become  more  precarious.  Under  the  Project,  measures  to  strengthen  natural \nresource management coordination and planning will help to maintain the base on which the \ntarget population, including the poor, depends; measures to organize communities for natural \nresource management will assist communities to improve livelihood systems; and measures to \nbuild management capacity for biodiversity conservation will help to retain the many benefits \nprovided by the Tonle Sap's natural resources (Table A15.4). Enhancing management systems \nand  building  capacity  will  achieve  the  improvements  desired.  The  design  of  the  Project \nincorporates three specific strategies to involve the poor and vulnerable groups and give them a \nvoice: \n(i)  Participation. Participation increases the sense of ownership and commitment \nto interventions and there is a correlation between its breadth and the stability of \nthe partnerships and institutions formed. Project activities to strengthen natural \n ", "74  Appendix 15 \nresource management coordination and planning will include raising stakeholder \nawareness  of  the  Tonle  Sap's  environmental  importance  through  a  national \nenvironmental education and awareness campaign; and improving regulation \nand  management  planning,  specifically  the  regulatory  and  management \nframework for inland fisheries, in consultation with stakeholders at the provincial \nand local levels. Inputs from consultations will be integrated in the common policy \nobjectives formulated to underpin sustainable management and conservation of \nnatural resources and biodiversity in the Tonle Sap. Project activities to organize \ncommunities for natural resource management will be founded on participation: \ndevolved  natural  resource  management  will  reflect  substance  and  show  a \ngenuine shift in authority to local people. Measures will include prioritizing target \ncommunities  by  their  expression  of  interest,  commitment,  the  extent  of \nenvironmental  degradation,  and  occurrence  of  conflict;  activating  commune \ncouncils  and  appropriate  village-level structures for community-based natural \nresource  management;  mapping  the  boundaries  of  community  fisheries  and \nforestry areas, using orthophotomaps, through a participatory process facilitated \nby  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs);  and  encouraging  communities  to \nformulate  plans  for  managing  natural  resources.  These  measures  will  be \nundertaken after the most suitable approach to community organization has been \ntailored. To build management capacity for biodiversity conservation, measures \nwill include developing alternative livelihoods in the core areas, both for migrants \nand permanent inhabitants, and developing and implementing an environmental \nawareness, education, and outreach program. \n(ii)  Gender. No project is gender-neutral and all can adopt gender-inclusive design \nfeatures that integrate gender and development concerns. In the five project \nprovinces, nearly 20% of household heads are women. (In Siem Reap, it is about \n30%.)6  Project  activities  to  organize  communities  for  natural  resource \nmanagement will include measures facilitating the full participation of women in \ndecision making by (a) gender sensitization, (b) inclusion of up to 40% women \nmembers at various levels in community organizations depending on specific \nsituations and needs, and (c) building the capacity of women\u2019s subgroups at \nvillage  level  for  effective  participation  in  community  organizations,  at  times \ndetermined by women to suit their requirements. \n(iii)  Ethnic  minorities.  In  Cambodia,  inland  fisheries  have  a  sensitive  ethnic \ndimension.  The  stake  of  the  Vietnamese  and  Cham  minorities  has  to  be \nconsidered when designing management options that involve partnerships with \nresource users. To strengthen coordination and planning for natural resource \nmanagement,  measures  to  improve  regulation  and  management  planning, \nspecifically the regulatory and management framework for inland fisheries, will \nexamine the issue of the rights of Vietnamese communities in the five project \nprovinces, whose livelihoods depend on the Tonle Sap. Project activities to \norganize communities for natural resource management will include measures to \ngive the Vietnamese and Cham communities in the five provinces opportunities \nto participate in community organizations. Through commune councils, commune \nchiefs, Government staff trained in participatory approaches, and NGOs, these \nmeasures will attempt to build relations of trust between the Khmers and the \nVietnamese minority. The Project's impact on ethnic minorities will be observed \nduring project monitoring and evaluation. \n                                                 \n6  See also ADB. 2001.

Poverty is pervasive and the poor depend on natural resources for subsistence. The Government has \nrecognized the need to engage communities in natural resource management. Provided management systems and \ncapacity for natural resource management are built at national, provincial, and community levels, the sector can \ncontribute substantially to poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis \n \nProposed Classification: Poverty Intervention  Thematic: Environment Protection \nPoverty around the Tonle Sap is widespread. About 50% of villages have 40\u201360% of households living below the \npoverty line. Poverty is related to lack of space for local people to participate and benefit. Households with female \nheads, households headed by widows, and ethnic minorities are particularly poor and disadvantaged. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder Analysis Prepared:  Yes \nStakeholders  number  millions.  They  include  local  people,  ethnic  minorities,  local  governments,  as  well  as \nGovernment agencies such as the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries. The roles and responsibilities of \nstakeholders have been analyzed and delineated. \nParticipation Strategy:  Yes \nThe participation strategy aims to involve the poor and vulnerable groups and to give them a voice. Measures to this \neffect are woven into the design of the Project. They include raising stakeholder awareness of the Tonle Sap's \nenvironmental importance and organizing communities for natural resource management plans. \n \nD.

Any equipment used for fishing. The Department of Fisheries in the Ministry of \nAgriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries describes over 200 different techniques and gear in use on \nthe Tonle Sap and ranging from large-scale gear such as barrage traps and bag nets; middle-\nscale gear such as arrow-shaped traps, drift seine nets, rafted mounted lift nets, and scooping \nnets; to family-scale gear such as gill nets, small traps, single longlines, small dip nets, and cast \nnets. Almost all are developed locally. \n       \nFishing  lots.  Fishing  lots  are  exclusive  geographic  areas  that  are  awarded  through  a \ncompetitive, public bidding system for a period of 2 consecutive years, with the auction fee \npayable for each of the two fishing seasons. In 2000, there were 175 fishing lots throughout \nCambodia. They range in size from 2,000 ha to 50,000 ha and may include lake areas, river \nareas, and flooded forest. The largest are found on the Tonle Sap. The operator of each lot has \nthe right to harvest fish according to the burden book for the lot. The burden book describes the \nopen  season,  the  payment  schedule,  permissible  fishing  gears,  the  boundaries,  the  main \ngeographic features, and the designated public fishing areas. Over half of the fishing lot area \nwas withdrawn from the system recently and designated for community-based management. \n       \nFish sanctuaries. Eight fish sanctuaries have been established on the Tonle Sap. They are set \naside to protect fish stocks, improve fish recruitment, and provide dry season refuge areas for \nnonmigratory fish. Year-round, fishing activities, including small-scale fishing, are  prohibited \nalthough fishing for scientific purposes is allowed. Seven of the sanctuaries are inside the \npermanent lake, and one is near the mouth of the Tonle Sap River. Most of the sanctuaries are \nfound in the deeper parts of the lake, and none is in the flooded forest. \n       \nFlooded forest. A descriptive term for the particular natural vegetation that originally covered \nmost of the Tonle Sap floodplain. It is now characterized by low forest and shrubs that still \naccount for the productivity of the Tonle Sap. \n       \nSeasonal inundation. Flooding that can be as low as 8 meters (m) above mean sea level \n(amsl) or as high as 12 m amsl. \n       \nTransition area. An area in which existing stakeholders work together in a variety of economic \nand other activities to manage and develop sustainably a biosphere reserve's natural resources. \nIn the TSBR, the transition area of about 900,000 ha lies between the outer boundary of the \nbuffer zone and Highways No. 5 and No. 6.  \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.
