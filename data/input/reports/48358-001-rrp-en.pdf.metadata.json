The report also describes the proposed technical assistance (TA) for the \nShanxi Inclusive Agricultural Value Chain Development Project; and if the Board approves the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.  \n\nThe project will help the Shanxi Provincial Government (SPG) increase income-generating \n2. \nopportunities (IGOs) from selected local specialty agricultural products, to alleviate poverty and \nnarrow  rural\u2212urban  income  disparity,  by  strengthening  agricultural  value  chains  (AVCs)  and \npiloting inclusive business mechanism. \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nShanxi is in the northern PRC, forming a highland with mountains in the east and south. \n3. \nThe province is known for rich mineral resources, including coal. In 2015, the provincial per capita \ngross domestic product of CNY34,919 was among the five lowest in the PRC.1 Rural households \nhave a per capita disposable income that is 36.6% of urban households\u2019 per capita disposable \nincome. The provincial poverty incidence remains substantial (9.6%), as compared to the national \naverage of 5.7%. \n\n4. \nShanxi is undergoing a significant transformation from a coal-dependent economy, and is \na  key  example  of  the  PRC  government\u2019s  efforts  to  reduce  rural\u2013urban  income  inequality  and \npoverty. Shanxi is the second-largest coal producer in the PRC, supplying one-fourth of domestic \ncoal production.2 For the last 3 decades, the province has experienced rapid economic growth by \nliterally fueling the economic growth of coastal regions of the PRC. However, this coal-dependent \ngrowth  has  made  the  provincial  economy  vulnerable  to  fluctuations  in  external  coal  price  and \ndemand. The coal price decline that began in 2011 has made Shanxi\u2019s coal industry financially \nunfeasible, and forced the province to reduce production during 2016\u20132020 by at least 100 million \ntons, which is more than 10% of 2015 production level.3 This is expected to significantly impact \nthe rural population employed in the coal industry. Transforming the coal-dependent economy to \na broad-based economy that creates viable IGOs for the rural population has become an urgent \ntask for Shanxi Province. \n\nThe  agriculture  sector  is  the  key  to  transforming  the  economy  and  addressing  income \n5. \ndisparity and poverty. Agriculture is an important means of livelihood for the rural population in \nShanxi Province\u2014in 2015, 16.5 million rural inhabitants (45% of the provincial population) relied \non  agriculture  as  an  income  source. 4  Despite  this,  the  sector  contributed  only  6.1%  to  the \nprovincial  gross  domestic  product,  the  lowest  of  all  provinces  in  the  PRC  (excluding  coastal \nprovinces and municipalities with limited agricultural production). This is due to low productivity \nand low value addition in the agriculture sector, which thus creates insufficient IGOs for the rural \npopulation. \n\n6. \nSmall-scale  and  low-value  addition  in  agriculture.  The  agriculture  sector  comprises \nvarious stakeholders, including farmers, cooperatives, and agribusiness companies  involved in \n                                                \n1  National Bureau of Statistics of China. 2016. China Statistical Yearbook. Beijing. \n2  https://www.worldcoal.com/coal/06052016/china-coal-production-continues-to-fall-2016-731/. \n3  The province produced 944 million tons of raw coal in 2015, but lost CNY9.42 billion (CNY10 per ton of coal sold). \n4  An average of 30% of the rural household income in Shanxi Province is generated from agricultural activities. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nprocessing,  marketing,  and/or  distribution.  Those  stakeholders  form  loose  cooperation  in  the \nprovince. Poor performance of the agriculture sector in Shanxi stems from these underdeveloped \nvalue chains, which limits the ability to increase value addition and expand agricultural production. \nThese weak value chains result primarily from the absence of agribusiness companies capable \nof  leading  the  chains\u2014particularly  processors  that  link  the  small  farmers  to  the  markets. \nAgribusiness  companies  in  the  province  lack  adequate  business  strategies  and  production \nfacilities of sufficient size; when combined with a lack of collateral, this makes it difficult for those \ncompanies  to  access  finance,  and  prevents  them  from  expanding  operations  and  realizing \neconomies of scale. Primary production bases are small and scattered, making it difficult for those \ncompanies to source sufficient volumes of quality raw materials in a timely manner. It is crucial to \nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  agribusiness  companies  to  lead  the  AVCs,  which  will  improve  the \nagriculture sector\u2019s performance in the province. \n\n7. \nLimited viable employment generation for poor and low-income people. Although it \nis  important  to  nurture  the  leading  agribusiness  companies,  their  capacity  to  generate \nemployment that would benefit poor and low-income people depends on their business strategies, \nwhich are in turn impacted by the government\u2019s industrial policy. Since 2012, the government has \npromoted agricultural industrialization by supporting \u201cdragon-head enterprises,\u201d which are defined \nas  companies  that  have  the  potential  to  drive  agricultural  and  rural  economic  restructuring; \nincrease efficiency in agricultural production; and eventually increase farmer incomes.5 Despite \nthis effort, limited IGOs have been created for poor and low-income people. To reduce income \ndisparity  and  eradicate  poverty,  agribusiness  companies  need  to  adopt  pro-poor  business \nstrategies. \n\nStrategic  fit.  Supporting  inclusive  economic  growth  is  a  strategic  priority  for  the  Asian \n8. \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in its country partnership strategy for the PRC.6 SPG requested ADB \nassistance in eradicating extreme poverty and improving livelihoods in the poverty-stricken areas \nof Shanxi Province, by tapping the potential of the agriculture sector in developing  rural IGOs. \nSPG  particularly  requested  help  in  implementing  the  PRC\u2019s  new  rural  development  policy  to \npromote agriculture-based industry for local specialty agricultural products, as part of the Shanxi \nPoverty Alleviation and Rural Development Program. This project supports the improvement of \nmarket  connectivity  and  value-chain  linkages,  which  is  one  of  the  four  priority  areas  of  ADB\u2019s \nOperational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources.7 The improvement of rural livelihoods, \nand particularly eradicating extreme poverty by 2020, is a key priority under the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth \nFive-Year Plan on National Economic and Social Development, 2016\u20132020.8 \n\nLessons. The project design incorporates lessons from relevant projects financed by ADB \n9. \nand  others  in  the  PRC,  including  (i)  enabling  farmers  and  agribusiness  companies  to  finance \nlonger-term investment to increase production, improve productivity, and enhance value addition; \n(ii) engaging agribusiness companies to generate IGOs; (iii) helping farmers improve access to \nmarkets, and improve product quality control through cooperation with agribusiness companies; \n\n                                                \n5  According to the State Council in 2012, dragon head enterprises are defined as private or state-owned enterprises \nresponsible for opening new markets, innovating in science and technology, driving farm households, and advancing \nregional economic development. Sixteen of the 19 project agribusiness companies and cooperative  (PACs) have \ndragon-head enterprise status granted by the national, provincial, municipal, and/or county governments. \n\n6  ADB.  2016.

These  outputs  will  primarily  be  implemented  (with \ngovernment support) by the 19 project agribusiness companies and cooperative (PACs) that are \ncapable of leading value chains of different specialized agricultural products in different parts of \nthe  province.  The  19  PACs  are  divided  into  two  groups:  9  PACs  that  will  be  engaged  to \ndemonstrate  model  AVCs  under  output  1  (PAC1s),  and  10  PACs  that  will  be  engaged  to \ndemonstrate model inclusive businesses under output 2 (PAC2s). \n\n12. \nOutput  1:  Agricultural  value  chains  strengthened.  Nine  PAC1s  (five  companies \nproducing,  processing,  and/or  marketing  fruits,  vegetable,  mushrooms,  and  wine;  and  four \noperating livestock and poultry farms) will demonstrate respective value  chain strengthening\u2014\nthrough investment and capacity building\u2014that provides possible approaches to overcoming the \nlimitations of agriculture in the province, in terms of scale of operation and extent of value addition. \nInvestment components will help PAC1s scale up and/or upgrade their primary production bases, \nprocessing facilities and cold storage facilities, animal sheds, a biogas digester, and research and \ndevelopment  facilities  based  on  their  respective  investment  designs. 12  Non-investment \ncomponents  will  comprise  (i)  technical  support  for  PAC1s,  including  training  and  advisory \nservices; (ii) preparation of the AVC action plans for six PAC1s based on PAC-wise value chain \nanalyses  and  implementation  of  the  AVC  plans  to  demonstrate  model  AVCs;13 (iii)  training  for \nagribusiness companies, cooperatives, farmers, and relevant government agencies on the value \nchain  approach;  (iv)  training  for  cooperatives  and  farmers  on  institutional  and  financial \nmanagement;  and  cooperation  arrangements  in  production,  processing,  and  contracting;  (v) \nawareness-raising  and training  for  service  providers  such  as  financial  institutions  and  logistics \nservices providers on business opportunities in AVC; and (vi) study tours on best practices on \nAVCs.14 This  project  will  be  the  first  ADB  sovereign  project  in  the  PRC  to  take  a  value  chain \n\n                                                \n9  Recent  projects  include  ADB.  2016.

During  project  implementation,  action  plans  will  be \nprepared for up to eight PAC1s (not all 11 PACs will have plans prepared because of consulting services budget \nlimitations). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\napproach,  in  which  agribusiness  companies  will  be  guided  by  value  chain  analyses  in \nimplementing  the  project.15 Business  opportunity  training  is  expected  to  facilitate  value  chain \nfinancing by financial institutions in Shanxi Province and ease access to financing for farmers and \nagribusiness companies in the medium term. \n\n13. \nOutput  2:  Inclusive  business  mechanism  piloted.  Ten  PAC2s  will  demonstrate \ninclusive  business  models\u2014through  investment  and  capacity  building\u2014that  will  generate \nsubstantive employment that targets poor and low-income people. They include eight companies \nproducing, processing, and/or trading various products (e.g., coarse grains, mushrooms, fruits, \nvegetables, seedlings, and herbal plants); and two companies operating a livestock farm and a \npoultry  farm.  This  output  will  also  establish  and  pilot-test  the  localized  inclusive  business \nmechanism (LIBM). The  investment component will  help  PAC2s  scale  up  and/or  improve  their \nprimary production bases, processing workshops, storages, animal sheds, a biogas digester, and \nproduct  quality  control  facilities  based  on  PAC-specific  investment  designs; 16  and  further \ndemonstrate  inclusive  business  models  based  on  inclusive  business  action  plans.17 The  non-\ninvestment  component  will  comprise  (i)  technical  support  to  PAC2s,  including  training  and \nadvisory  services;18 (ii)  support  to  SPG  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  LIBM,  which \nentails company appraisal, incubation, monitoring, evaluation, and recognition, to systematically \npromote inclusive business; (iii) preparation of inclusive business action plans for all PAC2s and \nassistance  in  their  implementation;  (iv)  LIBM  training  for  the  Shanxi  Poverty  Alleviation  and \nDevelopment  Office  and  the  Shanxi  Provincial  Agriculture  Department;  (v)  training  for \nagribusiness  companies  on  the  inclusive  business  approach;  (vi)  preparation  and  sharing  of \nexperiences and a policy brief on the LIBM with SPG and the government for their consideration \nto incorporate the LIBM in the PRC\u2019s Fourteenth Five-Year Plan; (vii) study tours on best practices \non inclusive business; and (viii) dissemination of LIBM implementation achievements. \n\nInclusive  business  approach.19 Inclusive  business  refers  to  a  business  model  that  is \n14. \ncommercially viable and provides scaled up, innovative, and systemic solutions to the relevant \nproblems of poor and low-income people. Inclusive business has become a global initiative that \ntackles poverty and persistent inequality through private sector engagement, and national-level \naction has been called for. This project will be the first donor-funded sovereign project in the PRC \nto  implement  an  inclusive  business  approach.  The  approach  has  been  selected  specifically  to \ngenerate  employment  opportunities  for  farmers,  and  particularly  poor  and  low-income  people. \nProject design features include PAC selection based on inclusive business criteria (footnote 16); \ndevelopment  of  inclusive  business  action  plans,  which  ensures  the  qualification  of  PAC2s  for \ninclusive  business  and  intended  social  impacts;  inclusive  business  advisory  services  to  the \n\n                                                \n15 Value chain analysis involves breaking a chain into its constituent parts to better understand its structure and function. \n\nIt has been widely used in business, development, and academia, and for different sectors. \n\n16 The selection was made during project preparation based on an assessment of the companies\u2019 current operation \nand performance  and  project investment  plans  using  an  inclusive  business  appraisal  tool  that  rates markets  and \nvalue chains, financial performance, and the investment\u2019s social impact and innovation, and aggregates the scores \ninto  a  single  index  to  identify  inclusive  businesses.  Development  of  the  inclusive  business  scoring  tool  and  its \napplication  for company  selection  (Annex  1  of  the  PAM)  was  supported by  ADB.  2013.  Technical  Assistance  for \nInclusive Business Support. Manila (TA 8550-REG). \n\n17 Inclusive  business  models  in  agribusiness  firms  are  characterized  by  three  major  social  impact  channels:  (i) \ngeneration  of  employment  and  IGOs  on  a  large  scale  through  business  expansion,  (ii)  better  payment  than \ncompetitors by sourcing higher-value products or paying better prices, and (iii) improvement of livelihoods through \nreduced risks and better living conditions. \n\n18 Technical Report on Inclusive Business (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 The  Group  of  Twenty  (G20)  and  the  international  development  agencies  agreed  on  the  G20  Inclusive  Business \nFramework to propose a way forward for governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders.

The loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year;  and  such  other \nterms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement.21 \n\n17. \nSPG will onlend majority of the loan proceeds to the project county governments (PCGs) \nthrough the relevant municipal governments on the same terms and conditions as those of the \nADB loan to the government. The PCGs will further onlend the loan proceeds to the 19 PACs with \ninterest rates not less than the central government policy lending rate with a term of 5\u20138 years \nand grace period of 2\u20133 years depending on the activity. The loan proceeds repaid by PACs will \nbe re-loaned for investment in other agribusiness companies and/or cooperatives in the project \ncounties during the loan term. \n\n18. \nThe summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to \nworks,  equipment,  materials,  consulting  services,  and  training,  including  taxes  and  duties  for \neligible  ADB-financed  expenditures.  SPG  will  make  counterpart  funds  available  for  training, \nproject management, contingencies, and financing charges. Each PAC will provide a specified \nportion of subproject costs, and all cost overruns, from their own budgetary resources. \n\n                                                \n20 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Based on the straight-line repayment method, the average maturity is 12.75 years; a maturity premium is not payable \n\nto ADB.

The executing agency is SPG. Although the PPMO has \nexperience with an ADB project, loan implementation consultants to be financed by the TA will be \nnecessary  for  proper  management  of  the  project.  The  outputs  and  activities,  cost  estimates, \nfinancing  plan,  and  implementation  arrangements  of  the  TA  are  described  in  the  attached  TA \nreport.23 The TA is estimated to cost $300,000 to be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The TA implementation period is the same as \nthe project implementation period. \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nClimate change. A climate vulnerability assessment and management report found the \n22. \nthreat posed to project viability by climate change as medium to low. Climate projections suggest \nthat  temperature  and  precipitation will  increase  during  2041\u20132060 compared with  the  baseline \nperiod (1961\u20131960). Extreme weather events (e.g., droughts, severe storms) will likely become \nmore  intense  and frequent  in  Shanxi  Province.  Adaptation  measures  were  incorporated  in the \nproject design to (i) cope with anticipated climate change impacts, and (ii) manage the emission \nof  greenhouse  gases  from  project  activities.  The  adaptation  measures  include  those  for  the \nprotection  of  livestock,  crops,  and  facilities  from  excessive  heat  or  cold,  including  through \nupgraded greenhouse structures; improved disease control; and water-saving measures to cope \nwith increased water demands for crops and trees, and drought. The mitigation measures include \nadoption  of  energy-saving  technologies,  livestock  waste  biogas  recovery  or  fermentation \ntechnologies;  upgraded  insulation  for  all  buildings;  light-emitting  diode  lighting  and  energy-\nefficiency  equipment;  and  green  belts  with  trees  and  grass  for  shading  and  increasing  rainfall \nabsorption  and  drainage  capacity.  The  adaptation  and  mitigation  measures  have  been \nincorporated in the project design. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n23. \nThe economic analysis indicated that the project is viable with an economic internal rate \nof return of 23.3% and an economic net present value of  CNY1,888 million. The analysis also \nconfirms the economic viability of all subprojects, with economic internal rates of return ranging \nfrom 9.2% to 36.5%, above the economic opportunity cost of capital of 9%. Sensitivity analysis \nconfirmed the project is economically viable even under negative scenarios. The financial analysis \nconfirmed  the  project\u2019s  financial  viability  and  sustainability.  The  financial  evaluation  found  all \nsubprojects and the entire project were financially viable, with financial internal rates of return of \n4.4% to 34.2%, above the weighted average cost of capital. The entity financial analysis showed \nthat  all  PACs  will  be  able  to  maintain  reasonable  financial  performance  over  time  based  on \nfinancial ratios computed from their respective projected financial statements.24 \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nThe financial management assessment was conducted for SPG, PCGs, and PACs; and \nconcluded that, in light of the mitigation measures, the prevailing structure and system of project \n\n                                                \n23 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\ffinancial management is appropriate. The overall project financial management risk is moderate \non a pre-mitigation basis. The assessment recommended an action plan to mitigate the identified \nfinancial management risks, including training on ADB financial management requirements such \nas loan disbursement; this is to be implemented by SPG during the project. The procurement risk \nassessment  indicated  that  (i)  SPG  and  the  PCGs  have  the  experience  to  undertake  public \nprocurement of consulting services, goods, and works; and (ii) monitoring and internal controls \nregarding  procurement  are  generally  in  place,  but  PACs  lack  experience  on  foreign-funded \nprojects. Mitigation measures will include (i) early engagement of a procurement agent and project \nimplementation  consultant,  and  (ii)  provision  of  training  on  ADB  procurement  policies  and \nprocedures  during  the  project.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  SPG,  and  PACs.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n\nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n25. \nPoverty  and  social.  The  project  is  classified  as  targeted  intervention-geographic  for \npoverty  reduction,  emphasizing  generation  of IGOs for farmers  in  poverty-stricken  areas.  Poor \nand low-income people comprise significant portions of the project beneficiaries. A total of 73,250 \nhouseholds with 209,100 persons, of whom 49% are women and 54% are low-income people, \nare expected to benefit from cooperation with PACs, including as employees, contractual farmers, \nraw material suppliers, and recipients of subsidized inputs and services. The inclusive business \napproach  is  expected  to  enhance  the  socioeconomic  benefits  for  low-income  people  and \ncontribute to inclusive social development and poverty reduction in the project areas. A poverty \nand social analysis has been undertaken and a social development action plan prepared, with \nspecific  targets  committed  to  by  PACs.  Consultations  have  been  held  with  farmers  and \nstakeholders during project preparation, and consultation and participation measures for project \nimplementation have been included in the social development action plan. \n\nGender.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  following  the \n26. \nGuidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects.25 The project is expected to \nbenefit women significantly (majority of the agricultural workforce are women). A gender action \nplan has been prepared based on gender analyses to ensure the project contributes to improved \ngender equality. The gender action plan includes specific targets: (i) women are to (a) hold 40%\u2013\n50% of jobs in PACs\u2019 operations; (b) make up 45%\u201350% of beneficiaries in contract farming and \nraw material supply to PACs; (c) hold 30% of jobs in construction; (d) have workplace facilities \nseparate from those for men; (e) make up 30% of project staff; (f) account for 50% of farmers \ninvolved in consultation, participation, and capacity building; and (ii) gender-disaggregated data \nare to be collected for monitoring. Key gender indicators have been included in the design and \nmonitoring framework. \n\nCapacity  for  implementation  and  monitoring  of  social  measures.  The  PPMO  has \n27. \nexperience in implementing projects, including an ADB-financed agriculture project.26 However, it \ndoes not have experience with projects that require monitoring of social measures compliance by \na  private  company.  To  implement  social  measures  properly,  (i)  the  PPMO,  the  county  project \nmanagement offices, and PACs will each appoint a staff member as a social focal point, who will \nbe  provided  training  on  social  measures;  and  (ii)  an  external  social  expert  will  be  recruited  to \n\n                                                \n25 ADB. 2012.

An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  report  and  an \n29. \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) have been prepared; these were based on the approved \ndomestic feasibility study reports, environmental assessments, and site visits. Consultations were \nheld with affected people and government agencies, and the outcomes integrated in the project \ndesign. The  draft IEE  was  disclosed on  the  ADB  website  on  28  June  2017.  SPG,  through the \nPPMO,  will  be  responsible  for  the  EMP  implementation  and  compliance,  including  inspection, \nmonitoring,  reporting,  and  initiating  corrective  actions  or  measures.  The  PCGs  serving  as \nimplementing  agencies  lack  prior  experience  with  ADB  safeguard  procedures,  and  loan \nimplementation consultants and a capacity building program have been included in the project \ndesign. The IEE will be updated as needed during detailed project design preparation. \n\n30. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  achieve  environmental  benefits,  including  improved \nmanagement  of  wastewater,  livestock  manure,  and  agricultural  chemicals;  and  increased \nefficiency of water resource use in existing and new facilities. Anticipated construction impacts \ninclude  localized  and  temporary  air,  dust,  noise,  vibration,  and  erosion  impacts.  Potential \noperational risks include the unsustainable use of groundwater or surface water, and increased \nuse  of  agricultural  chemicals.  The  risk  of  indirect,  cumulative,  and/or  induced  impacts  was \nassessed. Mitigation measures have been described in the EMP; these included the preparation \nof subproject water management plans, waste treatment systems, and improved management of \npesticides and fertilizers. All project activities will be located on lands already zoned and modified \nfor development and that support existing PAC facilities. The livestock subprojects comply with \ndomestic  requirements  for  minimum  distances  from  residential  areas.  The  IEE  concludes  that \neffective EMP implementation, together with the prescribed training, will result in residual impacts \nwithin the limits of PRC and/or international standards as defined in the EMP. \n\n31. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  will  not  involve  involuntary  land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts, but will involve voluntary land use by PACs, affecting a total \nof 19,857 mu (1,324 hectares) of land.28 The land use rights for most of this land (19,315 mu) \nhave been leased from 1,819 households, while the remaining 542 mu is state-owned land. Due \ndiligence  has  concluded  that  the  land  use  agreements  have  followed  required  procedures: \nfarmers were informed and consulted regarding the land use; agreements were voluntary; farmers \nwill  benefit  fairly  from  rents  as  well  as  other  benefits,  such  as  employment  to  be  provided  by \nPACs;  and  the  project  will  not  have  adverse  impacts  on  the  farmers.  Due  diligence  has  also \nconfirmed  that  no  issues  will  trigger  involuntary  resettlement  requirements  under  the  ADB \nSafeguard Policy Statement. With the help of an external social expert (who will serve under the \nproject), SPG has agreed to monitor land leases, resolve any issues, and report findings annually \nduring project implementation. \n\n                                                \n27 ADB.

Risks  (which  were  all  rated  low  or  moderate)  and  mitigation \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.29 \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe  government  and  SPG  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \n34. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n\n35. \nThe government  and  SPG  have  agreed  with ADB  on  certain  covenants for the  project, \nwhich  are  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  Withdrawals  from  the  ADB  loan \naccount will not be made for any onlending to a PAC until it has signed an onlending agreement \nwith the relevant PCG. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n36. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $90,000,000 \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Shanxi Inclusive Agricultural Value Chain Development \nProject, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof  20  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented \nto the Board. \n\n29 August 2017 \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n                                                \n29 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nIncome-\ngenerating \nopportunities \n(IGOs) from \nselected local \nspecialty \nagricultural \nproducts \nincreased \n\nOutputs \n1.
