Past \nneglect of the road network has meant that much of the rural \npopulation live in areas that are cut off from the economic and \nin \nsocial  mainstream.  About \nChhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh live in rural areas, and the \nmajority  of  rural  habitations  do  not  have  an  all-weather road \nconnection.  The poverty head count rates in these states are \namong the highest in India.  \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  reduce  poverty  and  deprivation,  and \nsupport  economic  growth  by  providing  enhanced  access  to \nmarkets,  employment  opportunities,  and  social  services, \nincluding health and education. The objective will be achieved \nby (i) providing rural habitations in  Chhattisgarh  and  Madhya \nPradesh  with  all-weather road connections; and (ii) improving \nthe  efficiency  and  sustainability  of  rural  roads  by  providing \nsupport  for  capacity  building,  research  and  development; \ndeveloping  financing  and  implementation  arrangements  for \nmaintaining  rural  roads  throughout  their  economic  life;  and \nimproving safety on rural roads. \n \nUsing  the  sector  lending  modality  of  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB), the Project will finance the construction of about \n11,000  kilometers  (km)  of  rural  roads  \u2014  about  5,500  km  in \nChhattisgarh  and  5,500  km  in  Madhya  Pradesh.  A  sample  of \nabout  1,000  km  of  subprojects  has  been  prepared  in  detail. \nThe  Government  will  prepare  additional  subprojects  during \nproject  implementation  in  accordance  with  agreed  upon \nselection and approval procedures. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n \nEnvironment Assessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nObjective  \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nfor \n\nroad  asset  management  will  establish \nSupport \ndecentralized  systems  and  capacity  for  maintaining  the  rural \nroads  network  in  Chhattisgarh  and  Madhya  Pradesh,  secure \nthe necessary financing for maintenance, and assist the state \ngovernments  to  enter  into  contractual  commitments  to  road \nmaintenance  initially  covering  at  least  the  first  10  years  of \noperations.  Road  safety  audit  will  be \nintroduced  and \ncommunity-based approaches to road safety will be developed \nto accompany project investments in road connectivity. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $571 million \nequivalent comprising foreign exchange of $269.1 million, and \nlocal currency of $301.9 million equivalent. \n \n\n($ million) \n\n% \n\nSource \n\nTotal \nCost \n400.0 \n171.0 \n571.0 \n\nForeign \nExchange \n229.4 \n39.7 \n269.1 \n\nLocal \nCurrency  \n170.6 \n131.3 \n301.9 \n\n70 \n30 \n100 \n\nADB \nGovernment \n  Total \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \n \nA  loan  of  $400 million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility. \nThe loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 \nyears,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  front-end  fee  of  0.5%,  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such  other \nterms and conditions as set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements.  \n \nThe  Government  will  provide  the  Loan  proceeds  in  local \ncurrency to MORD and the state governments of CG and MP \non  a  grant  basis.

The Project is expected to \nreduction  and \nimpacts  on  poverty \nhave  significant \nsocioeconomic  development  by \nin \nagricultural incomes; (ii) growth in other sources of income and \nemployment  in  the  immediate  influence  areas  of  the  road \nconnectivity improvements; (iii) access to employment through \nlabor mobility; (iv) reduced  prices to consumers and users of \nservices; (v) improved health and longevity through access to \nbetter  health  services;  (vi)  improved  educational  attainment \nteachers,  and  educational \ndue \nsupervisors;  (vii)  improvements  in  production  through  access \nto  extension  services;  and  (viii)  greater  opportunity  for  rural \npeople  to  participate  in  the  wider  society.  The  quantified \neconomic benefits consist of (i) vehicle operating cost savings, \n(ii)  passenger  time  savings,  and  (iii)  reduced  spoilage  of \nagricultural produce.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of \nthe  sample  subprojects  is  26.6%.  The  beneficiaries  of  the \nProject  will  include  the  bulk  of  the  rural  population  of  the  two \nstates: \nincluding \nowners/operators  of  buses  and  trucks,  passengers  of  the \nvarious  vehicle  categories,  labor,  and  the  Government;  (ii) \nthose  benefiting  indirectly  because  they  live  in  the  area  of \ninfluence  of  the  roads;  and  (iii)  those  benefiting  indirectly \nthrough  the  wider  impacts  of  higher  economic  growth  in  their \ndistricts and in the states as a whole. \n \nIn  conjunction  with  the  Project,  technical  assistance  (TA)  is \nproposed  to  assist  in  preparing  the  Rural  Roads  Sector  II \nProject.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $1.25  million \nequivalent.  The  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  will \nfinance $1 million equivalent, on a grant basis, covering all the \nforeign  exchange  costs  ($327,800)  and  part  of  the  local \ncurrency costs. A consulting firm will be engaged using ADB\u2019s \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures,  and  individual \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.

The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  preparing  the  Rural  Roads  Sector  II  Project,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nThe Road Sector \n\n2. \nIndia\u2019s  highway  network  consists  of  about  58,112  kilometers  (km)  of  national  highways, \nabout 64,200 km of state highways and major district roads (MDRs), and about 2.7 million km of \nrural roads. National highways provide the high-density links between states. They comprise only \n1.7%  of  the  network  but  carry  about  40%  of  traffic.  State  highways  link  national  highways with \ndistrict headquarters, important towns, and minor ports; and MDRs run within districts, connecting \nareas of production with markets, and rural areas to district headquarters and to state highways \nand national highways. MDRs comprise about 19% of the network and carry about 40% of traffic. \nRural  roads  link  rural  communities  with  the  highway  network,  providing  access  to  higher \nagricultural incomes, employment opportunities, and social services.  Rural roads are considered \na  key  element  of  rural  development  and  poverty  reduction.  They  represent  about  80%  of  the \nnetwork and carry about 20% of traffic. Analysis of the roads subsector is in Appendix 1. \n \n3. \nThe sustained underinvestment in road infrastructure in India has affected all levels of the \nroad network.1 At the same time, traffic on all modes has been growing at around 10% per year in \nthe past decade. In the road sector, freight traffic increased at about 12% per year and passenger \ntraffic at about 8%. The rapid growth in traffic has led to congestion, road deterioration and high \ncosts  of  transport.  As  a  result  there  is  considerable  suppressed  demand.  The  potential \ncontribution of efficient road transport to the economy will only be realized if the level of services \nand the capacity of the road infrastructure increase to meet the demand.  \n \n4. \nA task force on infrastructure, set up by the Prime Minister in 1998, identified the need to \ntriple  or  quadruple  the  ongoing  rate  of  investment  in  transport  infrastructure,  which  had  again \nfallen well below 1% of the gross domestic product (GDP). As a first step, the task force backed a \n13,000 km National Highway Development Project for establishing an integrated national highway \nnetwork. This involved upgrading to 4 or 6 lanes in heavily trafficked sections the links between \nthe  major  metropolitan  towns  and  two  central  transverse  routes,  one  north-south  and  the  other \neast-west.  Executing  the  project  was  entrusted  to  the  National  Highways  Authority  of  India  for \ncompletion  by  2010.  Despite  severe  fiscal  constraints,  budgets  for  other  transport  infrastructure \nhave  also  been  raised  substantially  in  the  last  few  years,  and  many  states  have  initiated  major \nnew efforts to upgrade trunk road infrastructure and increase the pace of rural road expansion.  \n \nThroughout the road sector, service quality and capacity have been further compromised \n5. \ndue  to  lack  of  adequate  maintenance  of  existing  road  assets.  Maintenance  has  suffered  from \ninadequate financing, lack of planning, and weaknesses in execution. As a result, deterioration of \nroad infrastructure has led eventually to the need for reconstruction at a higher cost which places \nfurther strain on the available funds. \n\n                                                 \n1   Since  the  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan,  1980-1985,  annual  investment  in  roads  varied  between  0.6%  and  1.5%  of  gross \n\ndomestic product, with an average of 1.1%. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nNational Rural Roads Program \n\nAbout 70% of India\u2019s population live in rural areas, and about 40% of rural habitations2 are \n6. \nnot  connected  to  all-weather  roads  (330,000  out  of  825,000  habitations).  Many  villages  still  rely \non  earth  tracks  that  are  unsuitable  for  motorized  traffic  and  become  impassable  during  rainy \nseason.  Even  where  all-weather  connections  have  been  provided  in  the  past,  the  standard  of \nrural roads is low, maintenance is poor, and many roads are in need of rehabilitation.  \n \nWhile the determinants of poverty vary between states, there is a strong link between lack \n7. \nof road connectivity and poverty in India. For example, the three states with the highest proportion \nof poor people in their populations (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Orissa) are also among the most \ndisadvantaged in terms of road connectivity.3 There is also a strong link between improvement in \nroad connectivity and poverty reduction. Recent studies have indicated that public expenditure on \nrural roads in India has had a greater poverty reduction impact than expenditure on agricultural \nresearch,  irrigation,  power,  education,  health,  soil  and  water  conservation,  and  existing \nantipoverty programs. For every Rs1 million (about $21,000 equivalent) spent on rural roads, 124 \npeople were lifted out of poverty.4  \n \n8. \nTo  address  the  problem  of  lack  of  rural  road  connectivity,  in  2000  the  Government \nestablished a national rural roads program known as Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (Prime \nMinister\u2019s  Rural  Roads  Program  [PMGSY]).  Its  objective  is  to  provide  good  all-weather  road \nconnections5  to  all  habitations  with  a  population  of  1,000  or  more  by  the  year  2003  and  to  all \nhabitations with a population of 500 or more by 2007. In hilly or desert areas, or scheduled tribe \n(ST)  areas  as  defined  in  Schedule  V  of  the  Constitution  of  India,  the  objective  is  to  connect  all \nhabitations with a population of at least 250 by 2007. On this basis, PMGSY has identified more \nthan 160,000 unconnected habitations requiring new road connectivity investments. Details of the \neligible habitations are in Appendix 2. \n \nPMGSY  is  funded  by  the  central  Government,  with  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development \n9. \n(MORD)  acting  as  overall  coordinating  ministry.  State  governments  have  responsibility  for \nplanning  and  implementing  at  the  state  level  as  well  as  for  funding,  planning,  and  executing \nmaintenance. The estimated total cost of PMGSY from 2002 to 2007 is about Rs550 billion (about \n$11 billion equivalent). About 32% is to be funded from a 50% share of the cess on high-speed \ndiesel.6 The balance of 68% of funding remains to be identified. The Government has requested \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other external agencies to finance part of the program.  \n\n                                                 \n2   A  habitation  is  a  cluster  of  houses  in  a  compact  and  contiguous  area.  A  single  village  may  have  more  than  one \n\nhabitation, each habitation being separated from any other. \n\n3   According  to  Planning  Commission  estimates,  in  1999-2000  the  proportion  of  poor  people  in  total  state  population \nwas  42.6%  in  Bihar,  37.4%  in  Madhya  Pradesh  (MP),  and  47.2%  in  Orissa,  compared  with  a national average of \n26%. Based on statistics in National Human Development Report 2001, the level of road connectivity for habitations \nwith less than 1,000 persons in 1996-1997 was 40.7% in Bihar, 22.3% in MP, and 44% in Orissa, compared with a \nnational average of 49.2%. \n\n4   Fan, S., P. Hazell and S. Thorat. 2000. Government Spending, Growth and Poverty in Rural India, American Journal \n\n5   PMGSY  defines  an  all-weather  road  as  one  that  is  negotiable  in  all  weathers,  and  has  adequate  cross-drainage \n\nof Agricultural Economics 82 (4). \n\nstructures to effectively drain the roadbed.  \n\n6  The  Central  Road  Fund  Act,  2000  introduced  an  additional  excise  duty  (cess)  of  Rs1.00  per  liter  on  petrol  and \nRs1.00 on high-speed diesel, to be allocated as follows: (i) 50% of cess on high-speed diesel to the development of \nrural roads; and (ii) 50% of cess on high-speed diesel and 100% of cess on petrol to be assigned to maintenance of \nnational  highways,  road  bridges  under/over  railway  lines  and  safety  work  at  unmanned  railway  crossings,  and \ndevelopment and maintenance of state roads. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nAt the national level, PMGSY is administered by MORD through the National Rural Roads \n10. \nDevelopment  Agency  (NRRDA).  At  the  state  level,  the  government  nominates  a  nodal \ndepartment  to  execute  the  program.  This  is  typically  the  rural  development  department  or  the \npublic  works  department.  This  department  is  required  to  appoint  project  implementation  units \n(PIUs)  at  the  district  level  to  be  responsible  for  program  implementation  and  to  identify  or \nestablish  a  state-level  autonomous  agency  with  a  distinct  legal  status  to  receive  funds  from \nMORD.  All  PMGSY  road  investments  are  executed  by  private  contractors  engaged  through \ncompetitive tendering.  \n \n11. \nIn consultation with the states, MORD has established PMGSY guidelines for the states in \nimplementing PMGSY. 7 They provide the following guiding principles and definitions for PMGSY:  \n(i) improvements are limited to roads categorized as other district roads and village roads forming \npart  of  the  core  rural  roads  network  of  through  routes  and  link  routes;8  (ii)  new  all-weather \nconnectivity  has  precedence  over  improvement  of  existing  fair-weather  connectivity,  and \nupgrading  fair-weather  through  routes  has  precedence  over  upgrading  fair-weather link routes; \nand  (iii)  among  eligible  roads  of  similar  type,  precedence  is  given  to  those  serving  a  larger \npopulation.  The  guidelines  also  establish  (i)  the  technical  specifications  and  geometric  design \nstandards for PMGSY roads to ensure that all roads built will be of sound design with adequate \ndrainage, in accordance with Indian Road Congress standards; and (ii) a three-tier quality control \nsystem  consisting  of  the  PIU  or  executive  engineer,  independent  quality  monitoring  at  the  state \nlevel, and independent quality monitoring at the national level.   \n \n12. \nThe PMGSY guidelines also establish the approach to planning PMGSY at state, district, \nand block levels, including use of the Manual for Preparation of District Roads Plan. The manual \nexplains the procedures for drawing up each district\u2019s plan for connecting all eligible habitations, \nwith  choice  of  routing  for  each  eligible  habitation  to  be  determined  by  weighting  socioeconomic \nand  infrastructure  variables  so  as  to  select  the  route  that  will  maximize  the  socioeconomic \nbenefits  of  the  new  connection.  The  preparation  of  plans  requires  extensive  community \nconsultation. Plans are first prepared at block level for approval by the intermediate panchayat.9 \nBlock plans are consolidated into district plans for approval by the zilla panchayat. \n \n13. \nIn  each  of  the  fiscal  years  2000/01  and  2001/02,  MORD  earmarked  Rs25  billion  ($0.5 \nbillion  equivalent)  for  PMGSY.  As  of  June  2002,  Rs50  billion  ($1  billion  equivalent)  had  been \ndisbursed  to  participating  states  and  road  works  were  at  various  stages  of  implementation.  By \nFebruary 2003, 88% of the 13,070 road works in the 2000/01 allocation and 10% of the 10,932 \nroad works in the 2001/02 allocation had been completed.  \n \n14. \nThe PMGSY guidelines require states seeking PMGSY financing to identify suitable zilla \nor intermediate panchayat institutions for undertaking maintenance of the rural roads developed \nunder  PMGSY,  and  to  hand  over  PMGSY  roads  to  such  institutions.10 The state government is \nalso  required  to  provide  an  undertaking  to  remit  to  these  institutions  the  costs  of the requisite \nmaintenance  through  either  budget  allocations  or  alternative  sources  of  funding.  The  guidelines \n\n                                                 \n7   PMGSY Guidelines No. P-12025/8/2001-RC(Pt), Government of India, MORD, revised 15 January 2003. \n8   The core network is that minimal network of roads needed to provide all eligible habitations access to basic social \nand economic services through at least a single all-weather road. Through routes are those that collect traffic from \nseveral  link  roads  or  a  long  chain  of  habitations  and  lead  it  to  marketing  centers  either  directly  or  through  higher \ncategory  roads.  Link  routes  are  roads  connecting  a  single  habitation  or  group  of  habitations  to  through  routes  or \ndistrict roads leading to market centers.  \n\n9  A panchayat is a body of directly elected people responsible for development of activities in an area. There are three \nlevels  of  panchayat,  comprising  gram  panchayat  at  village  level,  intermediate  panchayat  at  block  level,  and  zilla \npanchayat at district level. \n\n10 Following  the  73rd  Constitutional  Amendment  in  1992,  state  governments  are  to  assign  responsibility  for   \n\nmaintenance of rural roads to panchayats and to remit necessary financial resources for this purpose. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nindicate that establishing and implementing satisfactory mechanisms to provide funding and other \nassistance for maintaining PMGSY assets will be a key requirement for states to be considered \nfor future assistance under the PMGSY. \n \n\n3. \n\nRural Roads Improvement in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh \n\n15. \nThe  states  of  Chhattisgarh  (CG)  and  Madhya  Pradesh  (MP),  which  are  the  focus  of  the \nproposed Project, are among the most needy in rural road connectivity. Recent estimates show \nthat  less  than  half  of  all  habitations  with  more  than  500  persons  have  an  all-weather  road \nconnection.  The  total  number  of  unconnected  habitations  identified  for  new  connectivity \ninvestments under PMGSY is 15,608 in CG and 9,502 in MP (Appendix 2), together equivalent to \n15% of the national total. It is estimated that to provide these habitations with new connectivity, \nmore than 80,000 km of all-weather rural roads will have to be built in each state.  \n \n16. \nThe  state  governments  of  CG  and  MP  attach  high  priority  to  PMGSY.  This  has  been \nreflected in their favorable performance during the first 2 years of PMGSY compared with other \nstates.  In  the  first  annual  PMGSY  program  in  2000/01,  113  road  works  valued  at  Rs920  million \n($20 million equivalent) were undertaken in CG and 413 works valued at Rs2.2 billion ($47 million \nequivalent) in MP. Based on good implementation performance  under the first annual program,11 \nPMGSY activities in the two states were expanded in the second annual program in 2001/02 to \ncover 270 works for Rs1.85 billion ($40 million equivalent) in CG and 890 works for Rs5.1 billion \n($110  million  equivalent)  in  MP.  Both  states  are  making  good  progress  in  implementing  the \n2001/02 annual program, and are planning a similar volume of additional works in 2002/03. Both \nstates have received good and improving ratings from national independent quality monitors up to \nDecember 2002. Of 297 works inspected in CG, 76% were rated good or very good, and only 4% \nwere rated poor. Of 664 works inspected in MP, 88% were rated good or very good, and only 1% \nwas rated poor. MP\u2019s overall quality rating was among the best for all states.  Over the course of \nsuccessive inspections, the ratings of both states have shown an improving trend.  \n \n17. \nSmall-size  private  transport  operators  account  for  nearly  all  passenger  and  freight \nservices  on  rural  roads.  Due  to  competition  among  such  operators,  it  is  expected  that  a \nsubstantial proportion of the vehicle operating cost savings due to rural roads improvements will \nbe passed on from operators to users.  \n \n18. \nRoad  crashes  in  India  conservatively  account  for  70,000  fatalities  and  approximately \n400,000 serious injuries each year. The result is a financial burden estimated to be in excess of \n2% of GDP, equal to $9 billion yearly. The rate of fatalities per 10,000 registered vehicles in India \nhas reached 16.3, one of the highest levels in the world. In CG and MP, where the level of vehicle \nownership  is  relatively  low  compared  with  the  population,  the  rates  are  13.6  and  12.4 \nrespectively. The PMGSY rural road connectivity program is expected to contribute to increased \nvehicle ownership and travel by villagers and to increased exposure and risk of road user injury. \nRoad safety measures to mitigate these risks will have to be developed alongside PMGSY since \nthere are no well-established road safety programs in CG and MP.  \n \n\n                                                 \n11 By  the  end  of  2002,  the  2000/01  annual  program  showed  completion  of  53%  of  works  and  81%  of  contract \n\nexpenditure in Chhattisgarh, and 39% of works and 65% of expenditure in Madhya Pradesh. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nChallenges \n\n19.  While  considerable  progress  has  been  made  in  the  first  2  years  of  PMGSY,  several \nimportant  challenges  need  to  be  addressed  to  realize  the  full  potential  of  improved  rural  roads \nconnectivity in as efficient and sustainable a manner as possible. The main challenges are to  (i) \nensure the sustainability of investments by establishing a sound approach to maintenance of the \nPMGSY  rural  roads  network,  including  securing  the  required  levels  of  maintenance  financing, \nbuilding  capacity,  and  systems  at  state  and  zilla  panchayat  level;  and  establishing  sound \napproaches  to  executing  maintenance;  (ii)  refine  the  subproject  selection  criteria  to  ensure \nnetwork efficiency by developing the necessary through routes for link roads to connect with the \nstate  and  national  road  network,  and  to  take  into  account  economic  viability,  remoteness,  and \nextent  of  poverty;  (iii)  establish  efficient  implementation  arrangements  that  avoid  creating  an \noverhang of unwanted public sector staff when PMGSY has been completed; and (iv) identify and \nintroduce  road  safety  measures  to  accompany  PMGSY  road  investments  so  as  to  mitigate  the \nrisks of increased vehicle speeds leading to increased road accidents.  \n \n\n2. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\nThe road sector in India has received substantial external assistance in the past. Although \n20. \nADB has not previously supported rural roads in India, it has provided loans amounting to about \n$1.8 billion for highways from 1988 to 2002, including seven projects for national highways and \none for state roads.12 The World Bank has provided 16 loans amounting to about $3.5 billion for \nupgrading  national  highways,  improving  state  highways,  constructing  and  rehabilitating  rural \nroads, and one urban transport project. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) has \nprovided five loans amounting to $0.3 billion to upgrade national highways and construct a bridge. \nThe  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  has  financed  technical  assistance  supporting  several \nADB road projects, including engineering support and institutional strengthening as part of ADB\u2019s \nproject for improving state roads in MP,13 and preparatory technical assistance for the proposed \nProject (para. 25). A summary of external assistance to the road sector is in Appendix 3. \n \nADB\u2019s  support  for  the  road  sector  has  been  developed  in  close  collaboration  with  the \n21. \nDepartment  for  International  Development  (UK)  (DFID),  JBIC,  and  World  Bank.  ADB  and  the \nWorld  Bank  have  adopted  a  Coordinated  Assistance  Strategy  for  the  Road  Sector,  which  was \nprepared  jointly  in  March  2001  and  updated  in  January  2002.  They  hold  regular  tripartite \nmeetings with the Government to discuss progress and issues in the sector. ADB has also met \nregularly with the World Bank team preparing a proposed project to support PMGSY in the states \nof Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Rajastan, and Uttar Pradesh, and the two banks have shared \ntheir respective project preparatory studies. DFID has been considering providing future support \nto PMGSY, and ADB has met regularly with DFID for coordination and information sharing. JBIC \nand ADB are exploring possible cofinancing of road projects in India. \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons \n\n22. \nImplementing ADB\u2019s first three national highways projects was delayed by operational and \ninstitutional  shortcomings.  The  problems  were  addressed  in  the  subsequent  national  highways \nprojects,  by  (i)  allowing  advance  procurement  of  civil  works  and  recruitment  of  supervision \n                                                 \n12  ADB support for the road sector in India has included nine loans totaling $1,823 million and 37 TAs totaling $14.815 \n\n13 ADB. 2002.

Taking  into  account  improvements  in  performance,  and  recognizing  the  important \ncontribution  of  highways  to  poverty  reduction  and  growth,  and  the  contributions  that  ADB  has \nmade  to  institutional  and  policy  reform  in  the  road  sector,  the  Country  Strategy  and  Program \n(CSP)  for  2003-2006  includes  11  more  loans  for  the  road  sector.  For  the  first  time,  the  CSP \nincludes  two  projects  for  rural  roads.  The  CSP  envisages  a  programmatic  approach  to  ADB \nsupport for highways, whereby accomplishment of institutional and policy reforms agreed upon in \none project will trigger processing and approval of the next related project. \n \nA  recent  ADB  study  examined  the  impact  of  rural  roads  on  poverty  reduction,  from  six \n23. \ncase  studies  of  completed  rural  roads  in  Indonesia,  Philippines,  and  Sri  Lanka.14  The  study \nconfirmed  that,  in  all  cases,  the  poor  benefited  substantially  from  improved  access  to services \nand  information,  and  from  improved  access  to  livelihood  opportunities.  The  extent  to  which  the \npoor  benefited  from  cheaper  transport  services  depended  on  the  level  of  competition  among \ntransport  operators.  The  sustainability  of  impacts  depended  on  adequate  maintenance  of  the \nroads.  Overall,  the  study  confirmed  that  roads  are  a  critical  enabling  factor  for  improving  living \nconditions  in  rural  areas,  but  found  that  the  extent  to  which  the  poor  benefit  also  depends  on \nfactors outside of the road subsector, such as the distribution of assets and the skills base of the \npoor.  The  study  recommended  that  future  rural  roads  projects  should  incorporate  baseline \nsurveys  and  benefit  monitoring  to  improve  understanding  of  the  poverty  reduction  and \nsocioeconom ic impacts.   \n \n\n4. \n\nAsian Development Bank Sector Strategy \n\n24. \nThe  theme  of  ADB\u2019s  CSP  is  mainstreaming  poverty  reduction.  In  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s priorities for the Tenth Five-Year Plan 2002-2007, this is to be addressed primarily \nby  supporting  economic  growth,  including  both  high  growth  and  equitable,  pro-poor  growth. \nGrowth has been identified as the major channel through which poverty can be reduced in India. \nThe  CSP  points  to  emerging  consensus  over  the  importance  of  infrastructure  in  poverty \nreduction,  through  both  its  indirect  impact  on  growth  leading  to  increased  incomes  and \nemployment,  and  its  direct  contributions  to  incomes  and  employment  and  reducing  human \npoverty by improving access to social services. The CSP also identifies the need for infrastructure \nprojects  to  incorporate  institutional  reforms  to  improve  sustainability,  particularly  by  establishing \nsound approaches to maintenance. The proposed Project combines each of the main thrusts of \nthe  CSP.  By  connecting  rural  habitations  to  the  state  and  national  road  networks,  the  final  link \nbetween rural producers and their distant urban markets will be completed, leading to both high \ngrowth  and  growth  that  poor  rural  people  will  participate  in  and  benefit  from  disproportionately. \nRural  roads  improvements  will  also  provide  poor  rural  people  with  better  access  to  social \nservices. The Project incorporates improved approaches to maintenance of rural roads to ensure \nthe investments are sustainable. \n \n\n5. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n25. \nIn  2002  the  Government  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  series  of  loans  to  assist  in \nimplementing  PMGSY,  beginning  with  the  proposed  Project  in  CG  and  MP.  At  that  time  ADB \nidentified  the  need  to  provide  reliable  implementation  arrangements  for  the  proposed  large \ninvestments  in  rural  roads,  and  to  incorporate  provision  for  maintenance  to  ensure  the \n\n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2002.

To  facilitate  project  preparation,  ADB  provided  small-scale \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  financed  by  the  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  for  preparing  a \nsample  of  about  1,000  km  of  roads.    The  TA  covered  (i)  economic  studies,  (ii)  engineering,  (iii) \ninstitutional and policies studies, (iv) environmental analysis, and (v) social analysis.15  \n \n26. \nDuring project formulation, agreement was reached with MORD, the state government of \nChhattisgarh  and  the  state  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  to  (i)  improve  the  criteria  for \nsubproject selection to incorporate network planning considerations, economic return thresholds, \nand safeguard provisions; (ii) address the issue of prioritization between through routes and link \nroutes  in  the  PMGSY  guidelines;  (iii)  establish  a  dedicated  rural  roads  development  agency  to \nimplement the proposed Project in CG; (iv) commit required levels of financing for maintenance, \n(v)  establish  reliable  approaches  to  planning  and  executing  maintenance,  and  enter  into  long-\nterm  maintenance  contracts  for  all  PMGSY  roads;  and  (vi)  incorporate  road  safety  measures  to \naccompany PMGSY road connectivity improvements. The policy matrix is in Appendix 4.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nObjective \n\n \nA. \n \n27. \nThe  Project  aims  to  reduce  poverty  and  deprivation,  and  support  economic  growth  by \nproviding enhanced access to markets, employment opportunities, and social services, including \nhealth  and  education.  The  objective  will  be  attained  by  (i)  providing  rural  habitations  in  CG  and \nMP  with  all-weather  road  connections;  (ii)  improving  the  efficiency  and  sustainability  of  PMGSY \nby providing support for capacity building, research and development; developing financing and \nimplementation arrangements for maintaining PMGSY roads throughout their economic life; and \nimproving safety on rural roads in CG and MP.  The Project framework is in Appendix 5. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n28. \nThe  Project  will  finance  the  construction  of  about  11,000  km  of  rural  roads:  about  5,500 \nkm in CG and 5,500 km in MP. Consulting services will be provided to support preparation and \nimplementation  of  road  construction  subprojects,  to  establish  sustainable  asset  management \nsystems  for  the  PMGSY  rural  roads  networks  in  CG  and  MP,  and  build  capacity  and  provide \ntraining. Consulting services will support the development of road safety audit under PMGSY and \ncommunity-based approaches to road safety to accompany project road connectivity investments. \n \n\n1. \n\nRoad Connectivity Component \n\n29. \nThe  Project  will  finance  improvements  of  rural  roads  that  are  part  of  the  Government\u2019s \nnational rural roads program under PMGSY to provide all habitations of at least 500 persons with \nall-weather  roads  by  2007.  It  will  support  improvements  in  CG  and  MP,  in  accordance  with  the \nPMGSY  core  networks  of  these  states.  Details  of  the  sector  investment  plan  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n \nThe  road  connectivity  component  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  sector  lending  modality.  This  is \n30. \nconsidered justified since (i) under PMGSY the Union and state governments have prepared well-\n\n                                                 \n15  ADB. 2002.

A total of 174 sample subprojects \ncovering 1,046 km of all-weather roads were prepared in 14 districts of CG and 11 districts of MP. \nStudies  examined  the  technical,  economic,  and  financial  feasibility  of  each  sample  subproject, \nand  identified  environmental  and  social  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  required.  A  technical \ndescription of sample subprojects is in Appendix 6.  \n \n32. \nAdditional  subprojects  will  be  prepared  for  approval  during  project  implementation,  in \naccordance with the selection criteria and approval procedures given in Appendix  7. Subprojects \nwill be required to meet the eligibility criteria for inclusion under PMGSY, and will be grouped in \narea clusters comprising priority link roads together with the through roads required to connect to \nthe state road network. The selection criteria establish requirements for subprojects in terms of (i) \neligibility \nin  accordance  with  PMGSY  guidelines;  (ii) \npreparedness  and  adherence  to  technical  specifications;  (iii)  road  safety  audit  of  subproject \ndesigns; (iv) economic returns; and (v) compliance with ADB safeguard policies and guidelines on \nsocial impacts, land acquisition and resettlement, gender, indigenous peoples, and environmental \naspects.  \n \n33. \nThe  road  connectivity  investments  will  be  implemented  in  four  annual  batches. \nExpenditures in each batch will be shared equally by CG and MP. The first batch will consist of \nthe  roughly  1,000  km  of  sample  subprojects  that  were  prepared  with  TA  assistance  (para.  25). \nAbout  10,000  km  of  additional  subprojects  will  be  implemented  in  the  second,  third,  and  fourth \nbatches, with about 3,300 km in each batch. The approval procedures require the implementing \nagencies (para. 50) to prepare the annual batches of additional subprojects well in time to provide \nADB  with  completed  checklists  summarizing  the  eligibility,  preparation  status,  and  compliance \nwith safeguards of each subproject. The loan-financed consulting services will assist in preparing \nthe additional subprojects and in implementing all subprojects.  \n \n\nfor  road  connectivity \n\ninvestment \n\n2. \n\nAsset Management and Capacity Building Component \n\n34. \nThe  Project  will  assist  the  governments  of  CG  and  MP  to  establish  the  procedures, \nfinancing  arrangements,  and  institutional  capacity  to  ensure  the  sustainability  over  their  useful \neconomic  lives  of  road  assets  created  under  PMGSY.  Consulting  services  will  assist  state \ngovernments  and  zilla  panchayats  (footnote  9)  in  establishing  road  maintenance  budgeting, \nplanning and management systems; will develop standard performance-based contracts for road \nmaintenance;  and  will  support  capacity  building  and  provide  on-the-job training. The assistance \nwill  enable  the  state  governments  and  zilla  panchayats  to  serve  as  strategic  managers  of  their \nPMGSY  rural  roads  networks,  with  detailed  professional  and  technical  studies  and  supervision, \nand all civil works outsourced to the private sector. The Project will also finance the procurement \nof vehicles and equipment needed for managing road maintenance at the district level. \n \nOn the basis of the policy dialogue during project preparation, the state governments have \n35. \nentered  into  commitments  to  provide  the  levels  of  annual  financing  required  for  sustainable \nmaintenance, as reflected in the Loan covenants: (i) the government of CG will annually provide \nin its state budget financing to maintain the PMGSY rural roads network, from about Rs96 million \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\n($2.1 million equivalent) in 2006/07 to about Rs956 million ($20.6 million equivalent) in 2010/11; \n(ii) the government of MP will make annual budget allocations and also earmark its income from \nmandi  cess,  for  financing  the  maintenance  of  all  PMGSY  roads,  from  about  Rs80  million  ($1.7 \nmillion  equivalent)  in  2006/07  to  about  Rs1.02  billion  ($22.0  million  equivalent)  in  2012/13; (iii) \nboth  states  will  exercise  the  option  under  the  PMGSY  construction  contracts  to  retain  the \ncontractor to maintain the roads built for the initial period of 5 years operations after completion of \nconstruction  of  each  road  (para.  96);  and  (iv)  before  the  end  of  the  initial  5-year maintenance \nperiods,  both  states  will  assign  responsibility  for  maintaining  PMGSY  roads  to  zilla  panchayats \nand assign the state financing for PMGSY roads [(items (ii) and (iii)] to them; (v) drawing on the \nstandard  performance-based  contracts  developed  under  consulting  services  (para.  34),  zilla \npanchayats in both states will enter into further maintenance contracts to start upon completion of \nthe initial 5-year maintenance periods and to cover maintenance of all PMGSY roads for further \nperiods of not less than 5 years (para. 99); and (vi) the increases in maintenance financing will be \nprovided  through  additional  budget  appropriations  or  increases  in  mandi  cess16  by  the  state \ngovernments,  and  will  not  be  financed  by  reducing  budgets  for  maintaining  other  roads. \nConsulting services will also assist the states to develop proposals for zilla panchayats to collect \na community contribution for the cost of road maintenance. Within the limits of affordability to rural \ncommunities,  this  will  introduce  a  user-pays  approach  to  road  maintenance,  and  in  so  doing \nstrengthen communities\u2019 sense of ownership over the road assets created. \n \nAdditional  support  will  be  provided  for  PMGSY  training  and  capacity  building  at  national \n36. \nlevel through NRRDA. This will focus on improving management skills for PIU and zilla panchayat \nstaff  by  developing  systems  for  managing  road  maintenance,  providing  training  by  consultants \nand domestic training institutions, and providing for study visits in India and outside India. \n \n37. \nIn  accordance  with  the  programmatic  approach  for  highway  sector  lending  adopted  in \nADB\u2019s  India  CSP,  the  Project  includes  an  assurance  to  address  the  critical  overall  issue  of \nproviding  for  road  maintenance  in  the  overall  PMGSY  program.  This  is  intended  to  serve  as  a \ntrigger  for  processing  of  the  proposed  Rural  Roads  Sector  II  Project,  tentatively  scheduled  for \n2005.  By  that  time,  to  strengthen  the  overall  sustainability  of  PMGSY,  MORD  will  have \nprogressed in its dialogue with the states participating in PMGSY with regard to making adequate \nplans  and  financing  arrangements  and  commitments  to  properly  maintain  their  PMGSY  road \nnetwork over its useful economic life (para. 102).  \n \n38. \nTo  mitigate  the  risk  of  road  crashes  and  injury,  the  Project  will  support  NRRDA  in  its \nongoing work to develop road safety audit for PMGSY, and will help to introduce community road \nsafety  programs  in  CG  and  MP.  As  part  of  consulting  services  for  the  road  connectivity \ncomponent (para. 55), a road safety audit will be conducted for all road connectivity subprojects, \nand  measures  to  mitigate  accident  hazards  will  be  incorporated  in  the  subproject  designs. \nGovernment-financed consulting services will develop road safety audit procedures to eventually \nbe specified by NRRDA for inclusion in the appropriate stages of the PMGSY road construction \nprocess, and develop a community-level approach to rural road safety in CG and MP, targeting \nroad users living in the project road areas of influence, initially those closest to state and national \nhighways.  The  community  rural  road  safety  program  will  begin  with  a  start-up  phase  where \ncampaign  products  will  be  developed  before  moving  to  an  expanded  implementation  phase \nwhere village-level panchayats will conduct campaigns to reach program sustainability. Capacity \nbuilding, research, and evaluation will be undertaken as the program develops to provide a model \nfor other jurisdictions.  \n\n                                                 \n16  Mandi Cess, a tax on sales of produce through agricultural marketing boards, will be used in MP. Since agricultural \nproducers  will  be  among  the  main  users  of  PMGSY  roads  and  will  benefit  roughly  in  proportion  to  the  volumes  of \nproduce they transport to market, this is considered an appropriate funding source.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n39. \nBoth  road  safety  audit  and  community  road  safety  are  consistent  with  the  national  road \nsafety  policy  and  strategic  road  safety  implementation  directions  for  the  states.  The  latter \nrepresents a new road safety initiative in India where a scientific and programmatic approach has \nnot  previously  been  evident.  The  rural  road  safety  subcomponent  is  expected  to  contribute  to \nstrengthening road safety provisions within PMGSY (details are in Supplementary Appendix B). \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n40. \nThe  Project  will  establish  both  the  financial  and  contractual  commitments  necessary to \nensure that assets created will be adequately maintained. In addition to establishing the capacity \nfor planning and managing rural road maintenance under the Project, the two state governments \nhave  committed  the  estimated  levels  of  financing  required  for  proper  maintenance  of  their \nPMGSY  road  networks,  and  will  enter  into  contractual  commitments  under  the  construction \ncontracts  and  subsequent  maintenance  contracts  to  maintain  these  networks  for  at  least  10 \nyears.  \n \n41. \nThe  subproject  selection  criteria  incorporate  provisions  for  enhancing  poverty  reduction \nimpact in very poor and remote areas. Due to previous isolation from the rest of the economy and \nlow  initial  starting  point  for  economic  development,  it  is  often  difficult  to  reliably  quantify the full \neconomic benefits of improving roads in such areas. At the same time, they may be among the \nareas  that  need  improved  road  connectivity  most.17  To  address  their  needs,  up  to  15%  of \nexpenditures on each annual batch of road connectivity subprojects in each state will be allocated \nto  such  areas  on  the  basis  of  a  weighting  of  socioeconomic  indicators  of  economic  potential, \nincidence of poverty, and difficulty of access.  \n \n42. \nThe Project offers a unique opportunity to document the impacts of rural roads on poverty \nreduction and human development in India since (i) it will construct a large number of rural roads; \n(ii) each road subproject will generally be completed and opened to traffic in about a year, so that \nduring  the  project  implementation  period  it  will  be  possible  to  examine  impacts  for  the  period \nimmediately  before  improvement  to  3-4  years  after  improvement;  and  (iii)  existing  PMGSY \nplanning  and  monitoring  procedures  already  provide  a  useful  initial  database  for  all  roads,  and \nPIUs  have  close  contacts  and  cooperation  with  panchayat  institutions  and  communities  being \nassisted.  The  consulting  services  for  the  road  connectivity  component  will  include  a  monitoring \nstudy to document the socioeconomic impact of the component in CG and MP. This will be based \non  preparation  of  pre-improvement  baseline  data  for  project  roads  and  control  roads,  annual \nupdating of data, and periodic review and community consultations to track and verify the change \nprocess due to the improved road connectivity. This will include support for training and capacity \nbuilding  for  state-level  research  institutions.  Outline  terms  of  reference  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix C. \n \n43. \nDrawing  upon  the  successful  implementation  arrangements  identified  in  MP,  during \nproject  formulation  the  CG  government  became  the  second  state  to  establish  a  rural  roads \ndevelopment  agency  to  be  responsible  for  implementing  PMGSY  in  the  state.  The  agency  was \nestablished  as  a  nonprofit  organization  under  the  Firms  and  Societies  Act  and  has  sufficient \nautonomy to be able to concentrate on ensuring effective, efficient implementation of PMGSY. Its \nstaff comprise a small group of professionals who will manage and oversee the implementation \nactivities.  Road  construction  and  supervision  will  be  outsourced  to  contractors  and  consultants. \nThese  arrangements  are  expected  to  enhance  PMGSY  implementation  performance  and  avoid \nthe problem of staff overhang when PMGSY is completed in CG. \n\n                                                 \n17  In fact, PMGSY treats road connectivity as a universal basic need for all habitations of eligible size. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\n \n44. \nAs an additional feature, the Project includes road safety measures targeted at mitigating \nthe accident risks associated with project road connectivity improvements. The measures may be \nexpected  to  be  highly  pro-poor  since  more  than  half  of  accident  victims  are  pedestrians.  It  will \nalso  help  establish  a  basis  for  wider  application  of  road  safety  measures  linked  to  specific  road \nconnectivity  investments,  including  for  PMGSY,  other  highways  projects  in  India,  and  for  ADB \nroad sector lending in general. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n45. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $571 million  equivalent  inclusive  of  taxes, \nduties,  and  interest  and  other  charges  on  the  loan  during  construction  (Table  1).  The  foreign \nexchange cost is estimated at $269.1 million (47%). The local currency cost (including taxes and \nduties) is estimated at $301.9 million equivalent (53%). Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 8. \n \n \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n\nItem \n \nRoad Connectivity Component b \nAsset Management and Capacity Building Component c \nFront End Fee \nInterest During Construction \n \n \na In mid-2003 prices. \nb \n\nTotald \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n225.8 \n3.6 \n2.0 \n37.7 \n269.1 \n\nLocal \n\nCurrency  Totala \n \n523.1 \n8.2 \n2.0 \n37.7 \n571.0 \n\n \n297.3 \n4.6 \n \n \n301.9 \n\nIncluding  civil  works,  project  implementation  consultants,  and  independent  monitoring  of  land  acquisition.

The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  a  front-end  fee  of  0.5%,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreements.  The  Government  has  provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on \nthe basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n47. \nThe loan will finance the foreign exchange cost \u2013 excluding the front-end fee, interest and \nother  charges  on  the  Loan  during  construction18\u2013  and  $170.6 million of the local currency cost. \nThe  Government  will  finance  the  foreign  exchange  costs  comprising  the  front-end fee, interest \nand other charges on the loan during construction, and the local currency costs of $131.3 million. \nThe  Government  will  provide  the  Loan  proceeds  in  local  currency  to  MORD  and  the  state \n\n                                                 \n18  Front-end fee, interest during construction, and commitment fees will be paid separately by the Government. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\ngovernments  of  CG  and  MP  on  a  grant  basis.  The  Government  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange \nrisk on the Loan.19 The financing plan for the Project is in Table 2.  \n \n48. \nFinancing  of  the  local  currency  cost  is  justified  since  the  Project  is  important  for \naddressing  ADB\u2019s  strategic  objective  of  poverty  reduction  in  India.  PMGSY  is  one  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  main  programs  for  poverty  reduction,  and  the  rural  roads  infrastructure  it  is \ndeveloping will contribute significantly to a host of other poverty reduction activities, and increase \nthe  effectiveness  of  other  ADB  assistance  to  reduce  poverty  in  India.  Having  determined  the \nimportance  of  rural  roads  for  poverty  reduction,  the  Government  has  initiated  a  very  large \nprogram that it can only partially finance from fuel taxes and budgetary sources. Financing from \nADB and other external sources is required to make good the severe deficit in rural connectivity \nwithin the present decade.  \n \n \n\nSource \n\nForeign Exchange  Local Currency \n\nTotal \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \n \n\n \n229.4 \n39.7 \n269.1 \n\n \n170.6 \n131.3 \n301.9 \n\n \n\n400.0 \n171.0 \n571.0 \n\n% \n\n70 \n30 \n100 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment  a \n \nTotal \n a \n\nIncluding taxes and duties, front-end fee, interest during construction, and commitment fees. \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n49. \nThe  Executing  Agencies  (EAs)  for  the  Project  will  be  MORD  at  the  central  level and the \nrespective state governments at the state level. MORD will be responsible for overall supervision \nand  execution  of  the  Project,  particularly  the  road  connectivity  component,  and  support  for \ncapacity  building  at  the  central  level.  The  state  governments,  through  their  respective  rural \ndevelopment  departments,  will  be  responsible  for  executing  the  Project  at  the  state  level.20 The \nMORD joint secretary will chair a project coordination committee, to be set up by the Government \nwithin  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  committee  will  monitor  the  use  of  loan  funds  and \noverall  implementation  performance.  The  committee  members  will  comprise  senior  officials  of \nMORD, the Department of Economic Affairs, NRRDA, and the governments of CG and MP. The \nrespective  state-level  standing  committees  as  set  up  under  the  PMGSY  guidelines  will  assist  in \noverseeing and monitoring timely completion of the Project. Both committees will meet quarterly. \nThe implementation setup is shown in Appendix 9. \n \nAt the national level, PMGSY is administered by MORD through the National Rural Roads \n50. \nDevelopment  Agency  (NRRDA).  At  state  level,  the  implementing  agencies  (IAs)  for  the  Project \nwill be the Chhattisgarh Rural Roads Development Agency (CGRRDA) and the Madhya Pradesh \n\n                                                 \n19  As  required  under  the  PMGSY  guidelines,  the  proceeds  will  be  provided  directly  by  MORD  to  the  implementing \n\nagencies (para. 50) established by the governments of CG and MP for that purpose. \n\n20  This  will  be  Chhattisgarh  Rural  Roads  Development  Agency  for  CG  and  Madhya  Pradesh  Rural  Development \n\nAuthority for MP. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\nRural Roads Development Authority (MPRRDA).21 CGRRDA and MPRRDA will each be headed \nby  a  chief  executive  officer  (CEO)  who  will  be  the  state-level  project  director  for  overall \ncoordination  of  implementation,  including  planning,  management,  consultant  selection,  and \nprocurement.  The  CEO  will  be  supported  by  experienced  personnel  at  headquarters  and  in  the \nPIUs established to support PMGSY implementation. In MP there are 27 PIUs, each covering 1\u20133 \ndistricts.22 In CG there are 16 PIUs, each covering one district.  \n \n51. \nTo  monitor  project  performance  and  use  of  funds  at  the  state  level,  and  to  ensure \ncoordination among the key agencies involved, the two state governments will each establish a \nstate-level  project  implementation  committee  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  These \ncommittees will meet on a monthly basis, chaired by the CEO of the IA, with representation from \nthe respective state rural development department,23 PIUs, and consultants. As  necessary, other \nstate  agencies,  may  be  invited  to  this  committee  to  assist  in  implementing  the  Project  in  areas \nsuch as forestry, land acquisition etc.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n52. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  inclusive  of  preconstruction activities. The \nscheduled completion date for civil works is December 2007. The first batch of subprojects (the \nsample subprojects) will be ready for contract award in July 2004. The IAs will prepare detailed \nimplementation schedules for the remaining three batches of subprojects to be agreed during the \nInception Mission. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 10.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n53. \nProcurement  to  be  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works contracts over $3 million will be procured through \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB),  and  those  estimated  to  cost  $3 million  or  less  will  be \nprocured  through  local  competitive bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to ADB. LCB contract \npackages will be in the range of $1 million\u20133 million, except that packages in the range of $0.5 \nmillion\u20131 million will be permitted for up to 10% of estimated expenditures on each annual batch \nof road connectivity subprojects in each state. 24 Civil works will be procured among prequalified \nbidders.  In  the  case  of  LCB,  prequalification  will  be  based  on  the  single-stage,  two-envelope \nsystem.  Equipment  will  be  procured  by  ICB  for  contracts  for  an  estimated  value  of  more  than \n$500,000,  international  shopping  for  contracts  estimated  at  $100,000\u2013500,000,  and  direct \npurchase  arrangement  for  contracts  valued  at  less  than  $100,000.  Indicative  contract  packages \nfor  sample  subprojects  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D.  Contract  packages  for  additional \nsubprojects  will  be  decided  during  implementation,  based  on  the  approach  used  for  the  sample \nsubprojects.  \n \n\n                                                 \n21  MPRRDA was established in 2000 as a nonprofit organization under the Firms and Societies Act for the purpose of \nimplementing PMGSY. Its staff focus on planning and managing PMGSY. Design, supervision,  and  civil  works  are \noutsourced to private consultants and contractors. Outsourcing was adopted both to ensure the quality and value for \nmoney of works undertaken and to avoid creating a large establishment that would become underemployed once the \nmain  PMGSY  activities  are  completed.  In  addition  to  statutory  audit  by  the  Auditor  and  Comptroller  General, \nMPRRDA  prepares  commercial  accounts  and  is  audited  by  private  sector  auditors.  CGRRDA  was  established  in \n2003 on a similar basis to MPRRDA. \n\n22  There  are  45  districts  in  MP.  The  number  of  PIUs  reflects  MP\u2019s  large  size  and  poor  accessibility  by  road  in  rural \n\n23  The  Chhattisgarh  Department  of  Panchayat  and  Rural  Development  and  Madhya  Pradesh  Rural  Development \n\n24  This exception will address the possibility of needing smaller packages in some more remote areas. \n\nareas.  \n\nDepartment. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nTo  support  timely  contract  approvals  while  ensuring  sound  practice  and  accountability, \n54. \npost  facto  approval  procedures  will  be  adopted  for  LCB  civil  works  contracts.25 For the first five \ncontract packages under LCB in each state, the IA will submit the procurement documents and \nbid  evaluation  for  ADB  review  and  approval  before  awarding  the  contract.  If  ADB  finds  the \nprocurement documents and bid evaluation for the first five contract packages satisfactory, the IA \nwill proceed with procurement procedures and contract award for subsequent contract packages \nwithout  prior  ADB  review  and  approval.  In  these  cases  the  following  post  facto  approval \nprocedures  will  apply:  (i)  the  IA  will  retain  a  record  of  all  procurement  documentation,  including \ncopies of the signed contract and the bid evaluation report, to be available for inspection; (ii) at \nthe time of each contract award the IA will provide ADB with a certified summary sheet reporting \non the main aspects of the bid evaluation and contract award; (iii) the procurement processes and \ncontract  awards  will  be  audited  annually  as  part  of  the  performance  audit  (para.  61);  and  (iv)  if \nany contract award is found to be unacceptable, ADB may refuse to finance the contract. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nInternational  and  domestic  consulting  services  will  assist  the  EAs  and  the  IAs  to \n55. \nimplement  the  Project.  Project  implementation  consultants  (PICs)  will  assist  the  two  IAs  in  (i) \npreparing  additional  subprojects;  (ii)  supervising  civil  works;  (iii)  implementing  land  acquisition \nplans and mitigating other social impacts as required; (iv) grievance redress for resolution of any \ndisputes  in  respect  of  land  acquisition  or  any  other  social  impacts;  and  (v)  implementing  and \nmonitoring  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs).  Three  PICs  will  be  recruited  in  CG  and \nthree in  MP,  and  each  PIC  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  four  annual  batches  of  the \nProject for an area covering about a third of the respective state. Each PIC is expected to cover \nabout  six  PIUs  in  CG  and  about  nine  in  MP.  The  PICs  will  be  recruited  from consulting firms \nbased  in  India  with  substantial  international  experience.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  PICs \nare  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E.  A  project  management  consultant  (PMC)  will  assist  MORD \nthrough NRRDA in (i) overall project management and coordination at the national level; and (ii) \ndeveloping  and  implementing  support  for  capacity  building  and  training  for  PMGSY  and  related \nagencies  such  as  NRRDA  at  the  national  level  and  the  IAs  and  panchayats  at  the  state  levels. \nThe PMC will assist the  two state EAs in (i) screening and processing additional subprojects for \nsubmission to ADB; (ii) procuring training services; (iii) project management and coordination at \nstate  levels,  including  overseeing  compliance  with  safeguard  policies  (in  relation  to  land \nacquisition/ resettlement, environment, gender, social impacts, HIV/AIDs,26 child labor, etc.); (iv) \nestablishing  road  maintenance  budgeting,  planning  and  management  systems  for  use  by  zilla \npanchayats,  developing  standard  performance  based  contracts  for  road  maintenance,  and \nproviding  capacity  building  support  for  zilla  panchayats  and  on-the-job  training  to  the  PIU \npersonnel  and  zilla  panchayats;  (v)  project  performance  management  and  monitoring;  and  (vi) \nmonitoring  of  socioeconomic  impacts  (para.  42).  The  PMC  will  be  recruited  from  international \nfirms  in  association  with  domestic  experts.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  PMC  are  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  F.  Government-financed  road  safety  consulting  services  will  assist \nMORD to incorporate road safety audit within PMGSY, and assist the two state governments to \ndevelop community-based road safety activities.  \n \nThe  state  governments  will  recruit  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  to  conduct \n56. \nindependent monitoring and verification of land acquisition and indigenous peoples aspects of the \nProject. Outline terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix G. In addition consultants will \nbe recruited to carry out performance audits annually (para. 61). \n \n\n                                                 \n25  Such procedures are consistent with PAI 3.04 para. 10. \n26 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\nLoan-financed consultants will be engaged using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection \n57. \nprocedures for recruiting firms under full technical proposals and ADB\u2019s procedures for recruiting \nindividual consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants,  and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  ADB  endorsed  advance \naction  for  recruiting  consulting  services  on  the  understanding  that  such  approval  would  not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n58. \nLoan  disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook, \nJanuary 2001, and Interim Guidelines for Disbursement Operations, LIBOR-Based Loan Product, \nJuly 2002. For ICB civil works, procurement of equipment and consulting services, loan funds will \nbe  disbursed  using  direct  payment  and  reimbursement  procedures.  For  LCB  civil  works, \nreimbursement  procedures  will  be  through  the  imprest  account.  MORD  will  operate  an  imprest \naccount  at  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  with  an  initial  advance of $20  million.  Thereafter  the  total \nimprest at any time will not exceed estimated expenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the \nloan amount, whichever is lower. Each IA will operate a second generation imprest account in a \nbank acceptable to ADB in the state, with an initial advance of $9 million. Thereafter the amount \nin each second generation imprest account at any time will not exceed estimated expenditures for \nthe next 6 months or 5% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. MORD will be responsible for \nmonitoring  the  two  IAs\u2019  imprest  accounts,  including  monthly  reconciliation  of  accounts  and \npreparation of withdrawal applications for liquidation/replenishment of the accounts. Statement of \nexpenditure (SOE) procedures will be used for individual payments of less than $100,000. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n59. \nThe  EAs  and  IAs  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  the \ngoods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  the  expenditures  incurred  for  the  Project \nand  the  subprojects,  and  use  of  local  funds.  These  project  accounts  and  related  financial \nstatements will be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by independent \nprivate auditors acceptable to ADB. The Government will submit to ADB within 9 months after the \nend  of  each  fiscal  year  consolidated  annual  audited  reports  and  related  financial  statements  of \nthe Project, identifying separate accounts of subprojects as required for CG and MP. The audit of \nthe imprest account and second generation imprest accounts and SOE will be carried out as part \nof  the  regular  annual  audit.  The  auditor\u2019s  opinion  of  that  part  of  the  examination  relating  to  the \nimprest accounts and SOE should be separately set out in the auditor\u2019s report. \n \n60. \nSince the PMGSY guidelines require state governments to engage chartered accountants \nof standing to audit PMGSY accounts, wherever possible the same auditors that audit CGRRDA \nand MPRRDA will audit project and subproject accounts in each state subject to these auditors\u2019 \nacceptability to ADB.  \n \n61. \nFor  transparency  in  all  procurement-related  activities,  and  objective  and  independent \nassessment  of  such  activities,  all  procurement  activities  will  be  subject  to  independent \nperformance  audits.  Loan-financed  consulting  services  recruited  through  ICB  will  conduct  the \nperformance  audit  annually.  ADB  will  also  conduct  project  procurement  audits  during \nimplementation as part of its regular review process. \n \nThe  IAs  will  submit  to  MORD,  through  the  relevant  state  government,  monthly  progress \n62. \nreports  of  subproject  implementation  under  the  road  connectivity  component,  in  such  form  and \ndetail  as  required.  Likewise,  the  state  governments  will  submit  to  MORD  quarterly  progress \nreports  for  the  asset  management  and  capacity  building  component  and  the  road  safety \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nsubcomponent. Based on these reports, MORD, with assistance from NRRDA, will further submit \nto ADB consolidated overall project performance reports on a quarterly basis. The quarterly report \nwill  summarize  the  information  in  the  detailed  reports,  including  basic  data,  use  of  funds, \nachievement  of  immediate  development  objectives,  compliance  with  covenants,  implementation \nprogress, and major issues and problems.  \n \n63.  Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the Government will submit to ADB \na project completion report with a detailed evaluation of the project design, costs, contractors\u2019 and \nconsultants\u2019 performance, social and economic impact, economic rate of return, and other details \nfor each state as may be requested by ADB.  \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n64.  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, MORD through the IAs will establish a capability for \nsystematic project performance monitoring (PPM) and analysis throughout the life of the Project, \nintegrated with their management information system. The PPM will be developed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Project Performance Management System Handbook. Initially, the PPM will develop \nand  conduct  a  \u201cquick  and  easy\u201d  rapid  sample  survey  to  establish  a  baseline  for  subsequent \nperformance monitoring. Thereafter, surveys will be conducted annually. The scope of the survey, \nquantity  and  quality  of  data,  and  frequency  for  collection  will  be  guided  primarily  by  the  project \nmanagement\u2019s  need  for  progressive  rapid  feedback  on  implementation  status,  as  well  as  early \nwarning of impending situations that might jeopardize attainment of the development objectives. \nThe  key  indicators  and  assumptions  outlined  at  the  output  and  development  objective  (i.e., \npurpose and goal) levels in the project framework will form the core of the data required for rapid \nassessment. The monitoring data on traffic levels, and poverty and socioeconomic impacts will be \nbased on the reports of the impact monitoring study to be carried out by the PMC (para. 42). \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n65. \nIn addition to regular reviews by ADB staff, there will be a detailed midterm review (MTR) \nof  the  Project.  The  MTR  will  identify  any  problems  or  weaknesses  in  implementation \narrangements, and agree on any changes needed to achieve the project objectives. Based on the \nproject  schedule,  the  MTR  will  be  carried  out  around  June  2005.  Two  months  before  the  MTR, \nthe Government will submit to ADB a detailed progress report on project implementation. Terms \nof  reference  for  the  MTR  will  be  included  in  the  project  administration  memorandum  to  be \nprepared by ADB\u2019s inception mission for the Project. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n66. \nAn  accompanying  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  be  provided  for  the \nRural Roads Sector II Project. The TA will cover (i) preparation of further investment for improving \nrural  roads  under  PMGSY,  including  a  review  of  poverty  reduction  impacts  of  PMGSY; \n(ii) institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  requirements;  and  (iii) formulation  of \nassociated support for road safety.  The EA for the TA will be MORD.  The total cost of the TA is \nestimated  at  $1.25  million  equivalent.  The  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  will  finance  $1 \nmillion equivalent, on a grant basis, including all the foreign exchange costs ($327,800) and part \nof  the  local  currency  costs.  The  proposed  in-kind contribution of  $250,000 equivalent from  the \nGovernment  of  India  will  cover  the  costs  of  office  accommodation,  transport,  and  counterpart \nstaff. The outline terms of reference and cost estimates are in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n67. \nThe  TA  will  be  carried  out  by  a  firm  of  international  consultants  in  association  with \ndomestic  consultants,  together  with  individual  international  and  domestic  consultants.  Their \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nexpertise  will  cover  road  engineering,  institutional  strengthening,  poverty  analysis,  transport \neconomics,  social  analysis,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  environmental  assessment. \nThe  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based selection procedures. \nThe  individual  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AN D RISKS \n\nA. \n\nPolicy and Institutional Improvements \n\n68. \nThe  proposed  support  for  asset  management  and  capacity  building,  including  the \ncommitment  of  required  levels  of  maintenance  financing  and  establishment  of  systems  and \ncapacity within zilla panchayats, will help ensure that created rural roads assets will be sustained \nover  their  useful  economic  lives.  Since  PMGSY  is  expected  to  eventually  create  new  assets  of \n$11  billion,  the  asset  management  improvements  under  the  Project  in  CG  and  MP  and  the \nprogrammatic approach of leveraging similar improvements throughout PMGSY, are expected to \nbe significant to the overall success of PMGSY. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n69. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated by comparing the with-project \nand  without-project  scenarios  for  about  800  km  of  subproject  roads  in  19  districts.  Without  the \nProject,  transport  costs  to  and  from  rural  habitations  will  remain  very  high.  With  the  Project, \ntransport costs will be significantly reduced, leading to savings for existing traffic, rapid growth in \ngenerated traffic, and a shift in traffic composition toward more efficient, motorized modes. There \nwill also be reduced spoilage of agricultural produce on the way to the market. \n \n70. \nClassified  traffic  counts  were  provided  by  the  governments  of  CG  and  MP  and  verified \nthrough field surveys and traffic surveys. Traffic on most subproject roads averaged around 100 \nvehicles per day: 40-50% motorized and 50-60% nonmotorized. For existing traffic, growth rates \nfor  freight  were  based  on  an  analysis  of  gross  domestic  product  and  the  income  elasticity  of \ntransport  demand.  Passenger  traffic  growth  rates  were  based  on  population  growth  rate,  per \ncapita  income  growth,  and  the  income  elasticity  of  transport  demand.  The  traffic  growth  rates \nadopted  varied  between  4  and  9%  per  annum,  depending  on  the  vehicle  type.  Based  on  the \naverage  vehicle  composition  for  the  sample  subproject  roads,  overall  traffic  growth  rate  was \napproximately  7%  for  2003-2010  and  6.3%  for  2010-2024. Estimates of generated traffic were \nbased  on  the  reduction  in  vehicle  operating  costs  by  vehicle  type  and  the  associated  price \nelasticity  of  demand.  Additional  traffic  induced  by  the  expansion  of  local  economic activity was \nconservatively  estimated  from  analysis  of  before-  and  after-improvement surveys for completed \nPMGSY roads, after allowing for existing traffic and generated traffic.  \n \n71. \nThe economic costs of the Project include the resource costs for construction, operation \nand  maintenance,  and  the  social  costs  of  compensation  for  land  acquisition.  The  economic \nbenefits were quantified in terms of (i) vehicle operating cost savings, (ii) passenger time savings, \nand (iii) reduced spoilage of agricultural produce.  \n \nThe  estimated  overall  EIRR  for  the  sample  subprojects  is  26.6%.  The  EIRRs  for  the  19 \n72. \ndistrict  clusters  of  sample  subprojects  ranged  from  13.0%  to  60.9%.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows \nthat  the  Project  will  be  economically  viable under adverse scenarios, including increased costs, \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\ndecreased  benefits,  and  implementation  delays.  The  economic  analysis  is  summarized  in \nAppendix 11. Further details are in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \nC. \n\nSocial Impact \n\n1. \n\nPoverty and Socioeconomic Impacts \n\n73. \nThe 2001 census reported that CG had a population of 20.8 million, of whom 16.6 million \nor  80%  lived  in  rural  areas.  MP\u2019s  population  was  81.2  million,  with  60.9  million  or  75%  in  rural \nareas.  The  combined  population  of  the  two  states  was  equivalent  to  10%  of  the  national \npopulation.  With  a  combined  poverty  head  count  rate  of  37.4%  in  1999-200027 MP and CG are \namong  the  poorest  states  in  India.28  Based  on  a  range  of  poverty  and  human  development \nindicators\u2014including  poverty  rate,  life  expectancy,  infant  mortality\u2014there  is  little  doubt  that \npeople living in these two states suffer from levels of poverty, disadvantage, and deprivation that \nare well above the national average.29  \n \nRural  inaccessibility  is  one  of  the  major  reasons  for  poverty  and  deprivation  in  the  two \n74. \nstates. Their large rural populations are widely dispersed, making road connectivity a particularly \ncritical  factor  for  people  to  avail  themselves  of  economic  opportunities  and  social  services.30 \nHowever,  past  neglect  of  the  road  network  has  been  especially  severe  in  these  states.  Studies \nconducted  during  the  preparation  of  ADB\u2019s  recently  approved  MP  State  Roads  Sector \nDevelopment Project (footnote 13) found that outdated institutional arrangements had led to most \nof  the  state  road  sector  budget  being  spent  on  personnel  costs  instead  of  on  maintaining  and \ndeveloping the roads. The 2001 National Human Development Report found that in 1996/97  only \n22% of habitations under 1,000 persons in MP had road connections, the lowest road connectivity \namong the states. \n \n75. \nThe Project is categorized as a poverty intervention. By focusing on states that are among \nIndia\u2019s poorest and by serving the rural parts of these states where poverty is highest, the Project \nis carefully targeted at areas that are predominantly poor. By providing rural habitations with good \nall-weather road connections for the first time, the Project will address one of the main underlying \ncauses of poverty and deprivation in CG and MP. By building in strong provisions to ensure the \nsustainability  of  the  roads  to  be  built,  the  Project  will  provide  a  lasting  instrument  for  enabling \npeople  to  lift  themselves  out  of  poverty.  As  is  well  documented,31 such support will have direct \nimpacts  on  poverty  reduction  in  the  immediate  project  influence  areas  by  providing  people  with \naccess to economic opportunities, links to better priced markets, employment opportunities, and \nbetter quality social and other services, as well as short-term project-related employment. Equally \nimportant,  it  will  have  important  indirect  impacts  on  poverty  reduction.  Improved  transport \nefficiency and extension of the transport network will contribute to overall economic growth in the \ntwo states, leading to increases in incomes and employment opportunities and generating higher \ntax  revenues  to  support  the  state  governments\u2019  other  programs  for  economic  growth,  poverty \nreduction, and human development.  \n \n                                                 \n27  Government of India. 2001. Poverty Estimates for 1999-2000. Press Information Bureau.  \n28  Until 2000, CG was part of MP. Most available poverty and human indicators refer to the former MP inclusive of CG.  \n29  The states\u2019 poverty head count rate is 37.4%, compared with the national average of 26%. Life expectancy of 56.8 \nyears for men and 57.2 years compares with the national averages of 62.4 years for men and 63.4 years for women. \nTheir infant mortality rate of 90 deaths per 1,000 live births compares with a national average of 70. They also have a \nsubstantially higher proportion of scheduled tribes (STs) and scheduled castes (SCs). In MP 35.3% of the population \nare STs or SCs, compared with 24.5% nationally. The proportion of STs and SCs in CG is believed to be higher than \nthat in MP. \n\n30  In 2001 the population density of MP was 192 per km 2, compared with 324 nationally.  \n31  An extensive range of sources is cited in the India Country Strategy and Program. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\nDuring project formulation, case studies were conducted to compare before and after, and \n76. \nwith and without rural roads improvements completed over the past 5 years in MP and CG. The \nresults are summarized in Appendix  12.  Further  details  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  J.  The \ncase studies confirm the mechanisms through which the Project may be expected to contribute to \npoverty  reduction,  including  (i)  growth  in  agricultural  incomes  due  to  access  to  higher  priced \nmarkets,  ability  for  the  first  time  to  transport  horticultural  and  other  higher  value  produce  to \nmarkets,  and  reduced  spoilage;  (ii)  growth  of  the  local  economy,  leading  to  increased  incomes \nand employment opportunities; (iii) the ability to travel to take up jobs outside of the habitation or \nresidence; (iv) reduction in prices of consumer goods and services due to lower transport cost; (v) \nimproved health and longevity due to access to hospitals and health services (including access to \nhospitals  at  time  of  delivery);  (vi)  improved  education  due  to  improved  access  to  schools \n(including  postprimary  schooling),  improved  capacity  to  attract  qualified  school  teachers,  and \nmore  frequent  supervision  visits  by  school  inspectors;  (vii)  improved  access  to  agricultural, \nveterinary, and extension services; and (viii) improved opportunities for participating in the wider \nsociety outside of people\u2019s home villages.  \n \nThe beneficiaries of the Project will be the bulk of the rural population of the two states: (i) \n77. \ndirect users of road transport, including owners/operators of buses and trucks, passengers of the \nvarious  vehicle  categories,  labor,  and  the  Government;  (ii)  those  benefiting  indirectly  because \nthey live in the area of influence of the roads; and (iii) those benefiting indirectly through the wider \nimpacts of higher economic growth in their districts and in the states as a whole. \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Impact Ratio \n\nDistribution  analysis  was  undertaken  to  assess  the  extent  that  the  direct  economic \n78. \nbenefits  quantified  in  the  economic  analysis  (para.  71)  would  accrue  to  poor  people,  and  to \nestimate the poverty impact ratio for the sample subprojects. Initially estimates were made of the \ndistribution  of  the  quantified  benefits  to  the  various  categories  of  road  users  (bus  and  truck \noperators/owners; bus passengers; car, utility, and motorcycle owners, drivers, and passengers; \nand users of bicycles and animal-drawn vehicles). A user survey was then conducted to establish \nthe proportion of the poor among passenger users, freight users, and vehicle owners/operators. \nThe poor represented 80% of all passengers using transport facilities, about 50% of people using \nfreight  services,  and  75%  of  owners  of  nonmotorized  vehicles  such  as  bicycles.  The  estimated \npoverty  impact  ratio  was  1.32,  indicating  that  the  total  net  economic  benefits  reaching  the  poor \nwill exceed the total net economic benefits of the Project.32 This strongly indicates that the Project \nis  highly  pro-poor.  This  analysis  is  explained  in  detail  in  Appendix  11  and  Supplementary \nAppendix I. \n \n\n3. \n\nGender \n\nGender  assessment  conducted  as  part  of  the  socioeconomic  and  poverty  analysis \n79. \nimpacts found that transport connectivity can contribute in establishing the conditions for raising \nthe  social,  educational,  and  health  status  of  women.  Better  transport  services  open  up \nopportunities for more girls to attend postprimary schools outside the village. They also contribute \nto safe motherhood by providing access to better health services outside the village and reducing \nthe  obstacles  to  improved  health  services  within  the  village.  Women  interviewed  referred  to  the \npsychological benefit of being able to maintain more frequent contact with their families in distant \nlocations.  The  extent  that  potential  gender  benefits  are  realized  will  be  affected  by  social  and \n\n                                                 \n32  The  poor  will  receive  most  of  the  gross  economic  benefits,  but  contribute  only  a  small  share  of  gross  investment \n\ncosts.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\ncultural factors, such as cultural constraints that may restrict female mobility beyond the village, \nand poor people\u2019s perceptions of the opportunity cost of educating girls compared with boys. \n \n\n4. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n80. \nA  social  assessment  and  a  20%  sample  survey  of  households  were  undertaken  for  33 \nsample  subprojects  with  a  combined  length  of  247  km.  In  CG,  nine  subprojects  in  two  districts \n(Bastar and Mahasamund), with a length of 105 km, were covered. In MP, 24 subprojects in four \ndistricts  (Bhopal,  Sehore,  Guna,  and  Sidhi),  with  a  length  of  142  km,  were  covered.  Field \nverification  confirmed  that  the  width  of  the  existing  roads,  originally  built  by  panchayat/village \nauthorities  on  revenue  (government)  land,  will  be  sufficient  to  accommodate  the  7.5  m  right-of-\nway to be improved through the Project. As a result, construction of the project roads will require \nminimal acquisition of land, only for shoulder adjustment and drainage.   \n \n81. \nThe subprojects surveyed in CG require acquisition of 22 hectares from 192 households. \nAbout  32  households  will  experience  loss  of  10-15%  of  frontage  of  structures  due  to  road \nwidening through the village. In MP the subprojects surveyed require acquisition of 4 hectares of \nland  for  minor  adjustments  in  road  shoulders  and  drainage.  An  estimated  429  households  will \nlose  agricultural  land.  The  average  loss  of  agricultural  land  will  be  only  3.15  square meters per \nhousehold, compared with an average farm size of 2 hectares. On average only three families per \nkm will be affected.  \n \n82. \nBased  on  the  social  assessment,  a  land  acquisition  plan  (LAP)  was  prepared  for  the \nsample  subprojects.  The  plan  is  guided  by  the  Government\u2019s  land  acquisition  laws/regulations \nand ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement and other social safeguard guidelines. It stipulates \neligibility and provisions for various types of losses (land, crops/trees, and structures).  In India, \nparticularly  under  PMGSY,  due  to  the  economic  benefits  and  increased  value  of  land  property \nfrom  improved  roads,  voluntary  land  contribution  by  affected  households  is  common  practice  in \nacquiring land for improvement of rural roads. The Project will provide three options for mitigating \nimpacts:  (i)  voluntary  land  contribution,  (ii)  replacement  land,  and  (iii)  cash  compensation.  The \nentitlement  matrix  establishes  the  parameters  for  mitigating  the  range  of  losses  likely  to  be \nexperienced by the households. Households headed by females and other vulnerable households \nwill  be  eligible  for  further  cash  assistance.  The  summary  LAP  for  sample  subprojects  is  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  K.  For  additional  subprojects  requiring  land  acquisition,  a  land \nacquisition  framework  (LAF)  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements  for  sector \nloans. The LAF presents the policy and procedures for preparing LAPs in accordance with ADB\u2019s \npolicy on involuntary resettlement. The LAF is in Supplementary Appendix L.  \n \n83.  More  than  25%  of  the  population  of  the  project  influence  area  are  indigenous \npeoples/STs. In the past, STs depended on forest resources for food. Most are now subsistence \nfarmers. Nearly 40% of people in the influence area of the subprojects in  Sidhi are STs. For the \nother sample subprojects the proportion of STs in the influence area is generally less than 10%. \nBecause  of  poor  transport  infrastructure,  many  STs  have  limited  access  to  regular  market \neconomy,  agricultural  extension,  and  health  and  education  services.  Lack  of  market  access, \nhealth  problems,  and  illiteracy  remain  the  principal  causes  of  their  poverty  and  vulnerability.  By \nimproving  access,  the  sample  subprojects  will  help  reduce  poverty  and  improve  the  human \ndevelopment  status  of  STs .  No  negative  impacts  are  expected.  Land  acquisition  will  not  be \nrequired  for  the  sample  subprojects  in  areas  with  a  high  proportion  of  STs  as  the  road \nconnectivity improvements will be on the existing road alignments. For any additional subprojects \nthat could have adverse impacts on STs, an indigenous peoples development framework (IPDF) \nwas  developed  to  guide  subproject  preparation  (Supplementary  Appendix  M).  The  framework \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21 \n\nwas  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements  for  sector  loans  and  ADB\u2019s  indigenous \npeoples policy.   \n \n84. \nThe PICs will include expertise to  assist the states in implementing the LAPs and IPDPs. \nNGOs  will  be  separately  recruited  to  independently  monitor  and  verify  implementation  of  LAPs \nand IPDPs (para. 56).33 \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\n85. \nThe  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  for  the  sample  subprojects  found  that  there \nwill be only minor negative environmental impacts associated with the project road investments. \nThe environmental monitoring and management plan included in the IEE provides for mitigation \nof  such  adverse  impacts.  The  mitigation  measures  will  be  incorporated  into  the  subproject \ndesigns  and  followed  during  Project  construction,  operation  and  maintenance;  the  IAs,  assisted \nby  the  PICs,  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  implementation  of  the  measures.  The  IEE \nconcluded  that  the  mitigation  measures  are  manageable,  and  therefore  a  full  environmental \nimpact assessment is not required. The summary IEE is in Supplementary Appendix N.  \n \n86. \nAssisted  by  the  PICs,  the  IAs  will  prepare  an  overall  IEE  for  each  annual  batch  of \nadditional  subprojects  in  their  respective  states,  focusing  on  any  environmental  problems \nidentified and mitigation required. \n \nE. \n\nProject Risks \n\nThe  risk  of  nonsustainability  of  the  Project  due  to  inadequate  maintenance  will  be \n87. \naddressed  by  the  asset  management  and  capacity  building  component.  This  component  will \nestablish  systems  for  planning  and  executing  road  maintenance  under  contract,  and  the  state \ngovernments  have  agreed  to  earmark  sufficient  funding  to  meet  the  estimated  maintenance \ncosts.  The  component  will  also  ensure  that  the  state  governments  enter  into  contractual \ncommitments  to  maintain  the  entire  PMGSY  rural  roads  network,  including  the  project  road \ninvestments, for at least 10 years of operations.   \n \nThe  risk  of  implementation  delays  has  been  addressed  by  establishing  a  rural  roads \n88. \ndevelopment  agency  in  each  state  to  act  as  IA.  The  IA  will  have  authority  to  decide  on \nimplementation  including  procurement,  suitably  qualified  core  staff  to  manage  implementation \neffectively,  and  sufficient  resources  to  engage  consultants  and  contractors  to  perform  the  main \nengineering  and  civil  works  tasks.  The  performance  of  the  MPRRDA  in  terms  of  quantity  and \nquality of PMGSY roads constructed has confirmed the advantage of this arrangement compared \nwith  implementation  by  state  government  departments.  To  avoid  the  risk  of  overextending  the \nimplementation  capacity  of  the  IAs,  consultants,  and  contractors,  the  level  of  annual  road \nconnectivity  expenditure  under  the  Project  will  be  similar  to  that  already  achieved  by  the  two \nstates under PMGSY. \n \n89. \nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  investment  component  suggests  no  significant  economic \nrisks. The criteria for selecting subprojects will ensure that each package of subprojects will have \nan  EIRR  of  at  least  10-12%.  Sensitivity  tests  and  risk  analysis  show  that  the  project  will  be \neconomically viable even under a combination of adverse scenarios.  \n \nThe risk of adverse social and environmental impacts has been addressed in the criteria \n90. \nand  procedures  for  subproject  selection  and  preparation.

Any increases in the actual amounts to be provided will be met \nby  the  governments  of  CG  and  MP  through  additional  budget  allocations,  or  other  alternative \nsources of financing such as Mandi Cess in the case of MP. \n \n98. \nThe governments of CG and MP will ensure that the financing of maintenance of PMGSY \nroads as provided under para. 97 will not involve reduction of budgets for maintaining other roads \nunder the responsibility of CG and MP that are not included under the PMGSY.  \n \n99. \nAs also required under the PMGSY guidelines, except as ADB may otherwise agree, CG \nand MP will require the IAs (through the PIUs) to transfer maintenance of the PMGSY roads to \ndesignated zilla panchayats before the end of the initial 5-year maintenance period for each such \nroad. The governments of CG and MP will also allocate the requisite funds to zilla panchayats for  \nsuch maintenance in accordance with para. 97.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23 \n\n100.  The  governments  of  CG  and  MP  will  ensure  that  zilla  panchayats  enter  into  further \nmaintenance  contracts  with  competitively  procured  contractors  (on  the  basis  of  the  standard \nperformance-based contracts for road maintenance to be prepared by PMC). The contracts will \nbegin  upon  completion  of  the  initial  5-year  maintenance  period  under  the  related  construction \ncontracts and will cover routine maintenance and renewal of all PMGSY roads for further periods \nof not less than 5 years. \n \n101.  Within  3  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  governments  of  CG  and  MP  will  introduce  a \nsimple planning, costing, and expenditure control system for routine and periodic maintenance of \nPMGSY roads by the designated zilla panchayats. \n \n102.  Within  18  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  MORD  will  have  progressed  in  its  dialogue  with \nthe states participating in PMGSY with regard to making adequate plans, financing arrangements, \nand commitments to properly maintain the PMGSY network over its useful economic life.  \n \n\n3. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n103.  As  part  of  the  MTR,  MORD,  the  governments  of  CG  and  MP,  and  ADB  will  review  the \noutcomes  of  the  startup  phase  of  the  community  road  safety  program  to  consolidate  the \ninstitutional mechanism, financing modalities, and detailed implementing arrangements to ensure \nsustainable road safety programs for the roads to be developed under PMGSY and the Project at \nthe national and state levels. \n \n\n4. \n\nLand Acquisition  \n\n104.  The governments of CG and MP will ensure that the IAs will implement the provisions of \nthe LAP for sample subprojects as agreed upon with ADB and in accordance with the framework \nset out in the LAP and in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s policy on \ninvoluntary  resettlement.  During  implementation,  the  IAs  will  prepare  and  implement  LAPs  for \nadditional subprojects in accordance with the principles and procedures set out in the LAF, to be \nsubmitted to ADB for approval before awarding civil works contracts. If changes to an agreed LAP \nare  required,  the  IA  will  seek  ADB  approval  for  such  changes  before  awarding  any  civil  works \ncontracts for subprojects included in the LAP. \n \n105.  The  governments  of  CG  and  MP  will  ensure  that  the  IAs  will  not  award  any  civil  works \ncontract unless they have, subject to provisions of paragraphs 106-107 and 116-118, acquired or \nmade available the land and rights to land free from any encumbrances, and cleared the utilities, \ntrees  and  any  other  obstruction  from  such  land,  required  for  commencement  of  construction \nactivities in accordance with the schedule agreed under the related civil works contract. \n \n106.  The governments of CG and MP will ensure that the settlement of issues, as applicable, \nrelating to land acquisition and resettlement compensation payments will include (i) payments of \nfull  compensation/replacement  land  or  value  of  land/structure  (residential/commercial)  to  legal \ntitleholders; (ii) payment of full replacement value of structure (residential/commercial) to affected \ninformal settlers/roadside squatters; and (iii) payment of other additional benefits and provision of \nassistance in accordance with the LAP provisions, including income restoration assistance during \nproject  implementation  and  additional  assistance  to  vulnerable  groups  such  as  STs,  SCs,  and \nhouseholds headed by women. \n \n107.  The  governments  of  CG  and  MP  will  ensure  that  IAs  will  disclose  approved  LAPs  for \nadditional subprojects and make available the information to the affected people and communities \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nbefore awarding civil work contracts, and confirm that summary LAPs will be posted on the ADB \nweb site.  \n \n108.  The governments of CG and MP will ensure that the IAs will recruit PICs with expertise in \nsocial development, land acquisition, and resettlement to help prepare, implement, and supervise \nLAPs for all subprojects.  \n \n\n5. \n\nExecution of Civil Works Contracts \n\n109.  The  governments  of  CG  and  MP  will  (i)  acquire  or  make  available  on  a  timely  basis  the \nland  and  rights  in  land,  free  from  any  encumbrances;  and  (ii)  clear  the  utilities,  trees  and  any \nother obstruction from such land, on a timely basis, i.e., strictly in accordance with the schedule \nas agreed under the related civil works contract, as required for construction activities relating to \neach section of the related civil works contract under the subproject. \n \n110.  The  governments  of  CG  and  MP  will  ensure  that  subsequent  to  award  of  civil  works \ncontract  under  any  subproject,  no  section  or  part  thereof  under  the  civil  works  contract  will  be \nhanded  over  to  the  contractor  unless  the  provisions  for  settlement  of  land  acquisition  and \ncompensation,  disclosure  and  environmental  safeguards  (paras.  106,  107  and  116-118)  have \nbeen complied with. \n \n\n6. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n111.  Wherever  applicable,  the  subprojects  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \npolicy on indigenous people, as amended from time to time, and the IPDF.   \n \n112.  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, the governments of CG and MP, through the IAs, \nwill recruit NGOs to independently monitor and verify the implementation of LAPs and IPDPs, and \nany voluntary contributions of land under the Project.  \n \n113.  The  governments  of  CG  and  MP  will  ensure  through  specific  provisions  in  the  bid \ndocuments  and  the  civil  works  contracts  financed  under  the  Project  that  the  contractors  will  (i) \ndisseminate information at work sites on the risks of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS \nas  part  of  the  health  and  safety  measures  for  those  employed  during  construction;  (ii)  follow \nlegally  mandated  provisions  on  health,  sanitation,  and  appropriate  working  conditions,  including \naccommodation,  where  appropriate,  for  construction  workers  at  camp  sites;  (iii)  comply  with  all \napplicable  labor  laws,  not  employ  child  labor  for  construction  and  maintenance  activities,  and \nprovide  appropriate  facilities  for  children  of  labor  in  construction  camp  sites;  (iv) provide equal \nopportunity  for  women  for  road  construction  activities,  and  not  differentiate  wages  for  men  and \nwomen for work of equal value.   \n \n114.  The governments of CG and MP will ensure that compliance with provisions in para. 113 \nis  monitored  by  the  IAs.  The  civil  works  contracts  will  also  provide  for  their  termination  by  the \nemployer for breach of any provision. \n \n115.  The  governments  of  CG  and  MP  will  ensure  acceptance  of  the  Project  through  effective \ncommunity  participation  in  selecting  and  implementing  subprojects  in  accordance  with  the \nPMGSY guidelines. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25 \n\n7. \n\nEnvironment  \n\n116.  The  governments  of  CP  and  MP  will  ensure  that  (i)  subprojects  will  be  implemented  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements  as  set  forth  in  the  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines (2003), as amended from time to time, and (ii) all environmental mitigation measures \nidentified in the IEEs for all subprojects are incorporated into the subproject designs and followed \nduring project construction, operation and maintenance.  \n \n117.  The IAs will prepare and implement IEEs including EMPs and mitigation measures, if any, \nfor  all  additional  subprojects,  with  detailed  assessments  for  subprojects  that  will  pass  through \nforestland  or  forested  areas  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines \n(2003), as amended from time to time. \n \n118.  The  governments  of  CG  and  MP  will  require  the  IAs  to  implement  the  Project  in \naccordance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding wildlife and  protected areas/forest \nareas  for  subprojects  that  would  involve  roads  passing  through  forest  areas  and  address  these \nunder the relevant IEE for such subprojects. No construction work will be undertaken on sections \nof  subprojects  that  pass  through  a  forest  reserve  unless  clearance  is  granted  by  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forest,  and  no  subproject  will  be  located  within  an \nenvironmentally  sensitive  area  such  as  a  wildlife  sanctuary,  national  park,  or  other  areas  with \nthat  are  declared  as  national  parks,  sanctuaries,  or \nsignificant  ecological \nnational/international cultural heritage. \n \n\nfunctions \n\n8. \n\nSubproject Selection \n\n119.  MORD  will  ensure  that  the  subprojects  follow  the  eligibility  criteria  and  are  promptly \nprocessed for approval by ADB as described in detail in Appendix 7.  \n \nB. \n\nCondition for Loan Disbursement \n\n120.  The Government will have paid the front-end fee on the loan. \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n121. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB \nand  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  $400,000,000  to  India  for  the  Rural  Roads \nSector  I  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term of 25 years, including a grace period \nof 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n\n \n27 October 2003 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n26\n\nAppendix 1 \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nSUBSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nIndia\u2019s  transport  system  is  one  of  the  largest  in  the  world.  It  serves  a  land  area  of  3.3 \n1. \nmillion square  kilometers  (km)  and  consists  of  roads,  railways,  and  air  services.  Inland  water \ntransport  plays  a  small  role  in  some  states  and  has  a  total  traffic  share  of  0.15%.  In  the  past, \nrailways were the predominant transport mode. In 1960 railways carried 85% of goods traffic (in \nton km) and 51% of passenger traffic (in passenger km). By 2001, the figures had declined to \n32%  of  goods  and  13%  of  passenger  traffic.  Road  transport  is  now  the  dominant  mode  and \naccounts for 68% of goods traffic (in ton km) and 87% of passenger traffic (in passenger km).  \n \nB. \n\nRoads Subsector, Government Strategy, and Road Sector Institutions  \n\n1. \n\nThe Roads Subsector and the Importance of Rural Roads \n\nThe road network can be subdivided into three main categories: (i) national highways, (ii) \n2. \nstate highways and major district roads (MDRs), and (iii) rural roads. In the country as a whole, \nnational  highways account for  about  58,112  km  or  2%;  state  highways  and  MDRs for around \n607,119 km or 18%; and rural roads for  about 2,650,000 km or 88% of the total road network. \nAlthough national highways comprise only 2% of the road network, they carry about 40% of the \ntotal road traffic. The  state  highways  and  MDRs  provide  linkages  with  the  national  highways, \ndistrict  headquarters,  important  towns,  tourist  centers,  and  minor  ports.  The  MDRs  within \ndistricts  connect  areas  of  production  with  markets,  rural  areas  to  district  headquarters,  and  to \nstate and national highways. \n \n3. \nThe road network is inadequate at the national, state, and district levels. It is unable to \nhandle high traffic density at many places and has poor riding quality.  Widespread overloading \nof  freight  vehicles  damages the road pavement.  Use  of  the road pavement by both motorized \nand nonmotorized vehicles (bicycles, animal-drawn vehicles, etc.) causes congestion and high \nlevels of traffic accidents. In rural areas, roads become impassable during the rainy season due \nto missing bridges, and inadequate, defective, or missing drainage culverts. One main reason \nfor  the  poor  state  of  the  road  network  is  lack  of  adequate  funding  for  maintenance  and  for \nimproving the quality of the network.   \n \n4. \nImproving  the  road  transport  network  is  important  for  the  economic  development  and \nsocial  integration  of  the  country.  Over  70%  of  India\u2019s  population  live  in  rural  areas.  Providing \nrural  areas  with  all-weather  roads  is  a  key  component  of  rural  development  and  economic \ngrowth, and will significantly improve the quality of life of the majority of the people. Roads have \nconsiderable  impacts  on  poverty  reduction  for  they  lead  to  higher  agricultural  incomes, \nincreased  productive  employment  opportunities, and  improved access to economic and social \nservices.1 \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Strategy  \n\n5. \nThe main objective of the road sector in the Government\u2019s Tenth Plan (2002-2007) is the \nbalanced  development  of  the  total  road  network,  which  includes  widening  roads,  improving  \nriding  quality,  strengthening  road  safety  measures,  and  establishing  wayside amenities.  Two \nmajor investment initiatives will be implemented. The first is the National Highway Development \n\n                                                 \n1   Asian Development Bank. 2002. Impact of Rural Roads on Poverty Reduction: A Case Study-Based Analysis.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n27\n\nProject  comprising  the  5,846  km  golden  quadrilateral  linking  Delhi,  Mumbai,  Chennai,  and \nKolkata;  and  the  7,300  km  north-south,  east-west corridors from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and \nSilchar  to  Porbandar.  This  project,  which  is  being  being  implemented  by  National  Highway \nAuthority of India,2 envisages creating four/six-lanes on the existing network  at a cost of Rs540 \nbillion  ($11  billion).  Financing  comes  from  earmarked  cess  on  petrol  and  diesel,  multilateral \nfunding,  budgetary  allocations,  and  market  borrowing.  The  second  major  initiative  is  the \nPradhan  Mantri  Gram  Sadak  Yojana  (PMGSY) 3  which  has  the  overall  objective  of  connecting \nrural  habitations  with  populations of 500 or more  to  all-weather  roads by 2007. The estimated \ncost  is  around  Rs600  billion  ($12  billion).  Financing  is  being  provided  from  earmarked  cess, \nmultilateral funding, and budgetary allocations.  \n \nC. \n\nRural Roads Subsector Profile  \n\n1. \n\nRural Roads Network and Traffic \n\n6. \nThe  rural  road  network  consists  of  zilla  panchayat roads,  gram  panchayat roads, and \ncommunity  roads.  There  are  five  major  surface  types:  (i)  track,  (ii)  earth,  (iii)  gravel,  (iv) \nwaterbound  macadam,  and  (v)  blacktop.  Neither  track  nor  earth  roads  are  passable  in  all-\nweather  conditions.  Gravel  and  waterbound  macadam  roads  often become impassable during \nheavy rains. The majority of the network of rural roads is under-developed, of low standard and \npoor quality, structurally weak, poorly maintained, and extremely deteriorated.   \n \n7. \nMadhya Pradesh  (MP)  has  a  total  road  network  of  202,240  km,  of  which  57,205  km  is \nsurfaced. There are 4,717 km of national highways, 7,923 km of state highways, 30,070 km of \ndistrict  roads,  and  159,530  km  of  rural  roads.  Around 80% of  all  roads  in  MP  are single lane \n(3.75  m  carriageway),  14%  intermediate  lane  (5.5  m)  and  only  2%  are  2-lane  (7  m) or more. \nApproximately  37%  of  roads  are  blacktop;  42%,  waterbound  macadam;  and  21%  have  no \nsurface  treatment.  The  Public  Works  Department  of  the  Government  of  MP is responsible for \n25,033  km,  while  the  remaining  134,497  km  of  roads  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Madhya \nPradesh Rural Development Department, and the panchayats.  \n \n8. \nChhattisgarh (CG) has about 50,000 km of roads, of which national highways make up \n1,827  km;  state highways,  3,611  km;  MDRs,  2,118  km;  other  district  roads,  27,526  km;  and \ntracks, about 15,000 km. Excluding tracks, only 30% of the total road network has a bituminous \nsurface.  Of  the  total  road  network  35,000  km  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Public  Works \nDepartment.  The  remainder  falls  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Chhattisgarh  Department  of \nPanchayat and Rural Development, and the panchayats.  \n \n9. \nRural roads are essentially low-volume roads with wide variations in traffic volume and \ncomposition.  Traffic  is  motorized  and  nonmotorized  (bicycles,  animal-drawn  vehicles,  etc.). \nTraffic  counts  in  2002  in  MP  showed  motorized  traffic  volumes  averaging  51  vehicles  per  day \nand  non-motorized  traffic  averaging  69  vehicles  per  day.  The  average  traffic  compositions  for \nmotorized traffic showed between 37%  and 45% motorcycles, 20% cars, and 10% trucks. The \nremaining traffic  was  composed mainly  of  tractors.  Of  the  nonmotorized  traffic, approximately \n83% were bicycles and the remainder were animal-drawn vehicles. Similar traffic counts in 2002 \nin CG showed motorized traffic between 35 and 80 vehicles per day.   \n \n\n                                                 \n2   In addition, the National Highways Authority of India is also creating four lanes on another 1,000 km of  highways , \n\n400 km roads connected to ports and 600 km for other projects , at a cost of Rs40 billion. \n\n3  Prime Minister\u2019s Rural Roads Program. \n\n\f \n\n28\n\nAppendix 1 \n\n2. \n\nVehicle Fleet and Transport Services \n\n10. \nThe  vehicle  fleet  in  India  totaled  around  50  million  vehicles  in  1999-2000.  Buses \naccounted for 1%; trucks, 5%; cars and  jeeps, 13%; and motorcycles and scooters, 71%. The \nremainder was mostly auto-rickshaws (three-wheelers) and agricultural tractors. The number of \nautomobiles has been growing at approximately 9% a year, and heavy commercial vehicles, at \n7.5% over the last 9 years. \n \nIn  MP,  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Transport  Department  is  responsible  for  licensing, \n11. \nregistering and regulating motor vehicles, drivers, and passenger and freight transport. In 2001 \nover  2.9  million  motor  vehicles  were  registered:  74%  motorcycles,  5%  cars  and  jeeps,  3% \ncommercial  trucks,  2%  buses  and  minibuses,  2%  two-  and  three-wheeler  public  transport \nvehicles, 9% tractors, and 5% others. Between 1990 and 1998 the registered vehicles increased \nat an average rate of 10.7% per annum. \n \n12. \nIn  CG,  the  Transport  Department  is  responsible  for  motor  vehicle  regulation  and  driver \nlicensing.  It  has  eight  regional  transport  offices.  In  2001-2002,  978,000  motor  vehicles  were \nregistered:    80%  motorcycles,  4%  cars  and  jeeps,  14%  commercial  vehicles, and 2% buses, \nmini-buses, and other passenger vehicles.  \n \nBoth  freight  and  passenger  services  are  operated  by  private  operators  and  state  road \n13. \ntransport  undertakings  (SRTUs).4  Freight  services  are  predominantly  owned  by  individual \nprivate  operators  with  1-3  trucks  per  operator.  Private  truck  operators  are  estimated  to  be \nhandling  over  80%  of  total  freight  traffic.  The  SRTUs  handle  less  than  20%  of  the  total  traffic \nwith a truck strength that was estimated at around 671 trucks at the end of the Annual Plan for \n2000-2001.  Similarly,  passenger  transport  services  are  supplied  by  both  SRTUs  and  private \noperators. However, following liberalization, the share of SRTUs operating passenger transport \nservices  has  declined.  The  share  of  the  private  sector  in  the  total  number  of  buses  has \nincreased from 57% in 1980/81 to 77% in 1997. Taking into account the traffic carried by other \ncommercial  and  personal  vehicles,  the  share  of  the  private  sector  in  total  passenger  traffic  is \nestimated at about 90%.  \n \nPassenger  fares  for  public  transport  and  freight  rates  in  rural  areas  are  competitive.5 \n14. \nThey  are  determined  through  market  competition  and  are  not  regulated.  The  majority  of \noperators  of  passenger  services  and  freight  transport  on  rural  roads  provide  services as an \nextension  of  their  other  economic  activities,  to  supplement  their  incomes. For example,  many \nfreight  operators  are  farmers  with  their  own  tractor  or  pickup  truck  who  offer  services  for \ntransporting agricultural produce to market. As the incomes of rural farmers are low, there is a \nhigh  degree  of  competitiveness  in  freight  rates  to  obtain  additional  income  from  this  source  of \nemployment. In the rural passenger transport market, many individual operators owning jeeps, \npickups  and  other  vehicle  types  compete  in  taking  passengers  to  local  markets  and  other \nfacilities. Most rural passenger transport operators are farmers who offer passenger services as \na side-line. Therefore, services are often erratic and usually have no fixed schedule.       \n \n\n                                                 \n4   There are 62 SRTUs throughout India. \n5   In  contrast,  for  state  roads  there  are  factors  limiting  the  competitiveness  of  passenger  transport  and  freight \ntransport.  For example  on  state  roads  in  Chhattisgarh  passenger  fares  are  set  by  the  Chhattisgarh  Transport \nDepartment.  The  fare  schedules  are  set  by  vehicle  class  for  buses,  taxis,  and  minibuses.  Freight  rates  on state \nroads are fairly competitive, but there are isolated areas where rates are not competitive, and have been set by the \nShippers Association. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n29\n\n3. \n\nRoad Maintenance and Funding \n\n15. \nThe major part of the rural road network is in extremely poor condition.  Rural roads that \nare paved are often worn out only a few years after paving.  Even basic maintenance practices \nare  lacking.  For  rural  roads,  sys tematic  planning,  execution,  and  financing  schemes  for \nmaintenance are almost nonexistent.  \n \n16. \nFollowing the 73rd Constitutional Amendment, maintenance of rural roads is to become \nthe  responsibility  of  the  panchayat institutions.  Maintenance  responsibilities  for  all rural roads \nthat have been constructed or upgraded are to be transferred to the concerned panchayats. The \nstate  authorities  are  to  remit  state  government  funds  to  the  identified  panchayats  for  the \nrequisite maintenance.  \n \n17. \nIn November 2000 Parliament passed the Central Road Fund Act whereby the Central \nRoad  Fund  will  allocate  to  development  of  rural  roads 50%  (approximately  Rs25  billion  per \nannum)  of  the  excise  duties  (cess)  raised  on  high-speed  diesel.  The  fund  is  dedicated \nexclusively  to  road  development.  State  governments  and  panchayats  are  responsible  for \nfinancing  maintenance.6  The  PMGSY  guidelines  require  states  to  commit  to  providing \nmaintenance funds as a condition for continued funding of construction under PMGSY.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n6  The  2003/04  budget  has  increased  the  levy  of  diesel  cess  by  a  further  Rs0.50  per  liter,  of  which  50%  or  an \n\nestimated Rs10 billion per annum will be assigned to PMGSY. \n\n\f          30        Appendix 2\n\nHABITATIONS ELIGIBLE FOR ROAD CONNECTIVITY WORKS

The \nproject roads will be built along the alignments of the existing earth/gravel roads that are in poor \ncondition. The majority of these roads are impassable for 3-4 months during the wet season. As \nthey  presently  carry  a  low  volume  of  traffic\u2014on  average  less  than  50 motorized vehicles per \nday\u2014and projected traffic for them after 20 years will still be below 1,000, the project roads are  \nclassified as low-traffic roads. \n \nA. \n \nThe  design  criteria  adopted  are  in  accordance  with  the Indian Roads Congress  (IRC) \n2.   \npublication Rural Roads Manual (IRC:SP:20-2002) and other IRC design codes that have been \nfollowed by the Prime Minister\u2019s Rural Roads Program (PMGSY). The standards are consistent \nwith standard international practices adopted by the American Association of State Highway and \nTransportation  Officials  design  standards  and  Transport  Research  Laboratory  Overseas  Road \nNote 31: Guide to the Structural Design of Bitumen-Surfaced Roads in Tropical and Subtropical \nCountries, and are found appropriate. \n \nPMGSY only requires that roads should be negotiable in all kinds of weather. The choice \n3. \nof surfacing takes into account factors such as traffic, soil type, and rainfall. Under the Project, \nthe  subprojects  must  meet  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  threshold  to  ensure  they  are \neconomically  justified.  In  many  cases,  bitumen  surfacing  will  be  the  most  economic  option, \nparticularly  because  (i)  the  unit  construction  cost  of  $40,000-45,000  per  kilometer  is  low;  (ii) \nunder  monsoon  conditions  there  are  risks  that  gravel-surfaced roads will be washed away by \nrains; and (iii) gravel roads require frequent maintenance if they are to realize their potential life, \nbut  there  are  uncertainties  about  establishing  a  permanent  capacity  sufficient  for  carrying out \nrequired activities. \n \nB. \n \n4. \n \n\nThe major improvements on the project roads follow: \n\nGeneral Design Consideration \n\nwiden  the  existing  roadway  to  7.5  meters  (m)\u2014efforts  will  be  made  to  confine \nwidening within the existing right-of-way to minimize adverse environmental and \nsocial impacts; \n\nprovide 3.75 m wide carriageway with granular subbase, waterbound macadam \nas base, overlaid with bitumen; \n\nprovide 3.75 m shoulder (1.875 m on each side); \n\nraise  the  embankment  to  provide  a  minimum  subgrade  level  of  0.5  m  above \nnatural  ground  level  or  0.6  m  above  highest  flood  level  to  meet  hydraulic \nrequirements; \n\nimprove horizontal and vertical alignment to allow a design speed of 50 km/h on \nlevel  terrain;  the  existing  alignment  will  be  followed  in  most  cases  to  minimize \nresettlement; \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n  \n\n\f \n\n40\n\nAppendix 6 \n\n(vi) \n \n(vii) \n\nprovide adequate road safety features through a safety audit; \n\nprovide  proper  cross-drainage  structures,  where  necessary,  to  ensure  all-\nweather connectivity; conduits for future irrigation pipes will be provided;   \n\nprovide road furniture including signs, kilometer posts, etc.; and \n\nestablish tree plantations along the roads where appropriate.  \n\n \n(viii) \n  \n(ix) \n \nEstimated Cost of Sample Subprojects \n\nC. \n \n5. \nThe project roads are rural roads designed to meet a very low level of traffic volume and \nminimum  all-weather  connectivity.  The  unit  cost  of  existing  PMGSY  roads  is  generally  low\u2014in \nthe vicinity of $30,000 per km for projects cleared for implementation in 2000-2003 in Madhya \nPradesh and Chhattisgarh. The roads are mostly new construction requiring earthwork.  \n \nAs  improved  design  criteria  will  be  adopted  for  the  subproject,  civil  works  cost  under \n6. \nADB funding is expected to increase. The estimated unit cost per km of the sample subprojects \n(approximately  500  km  in  each  state)  is  $44,200  in  Chhattisgarh  and  $41,400  in  Madhya \nPradesh  (see  Table).  The  increase  in  costs  is  mainly  due  to  increase  in  cross-drainage works \nand the quantity of earthwork to meet the requirements of the improved design criteria.  \n\n \nEstimated Unit Costs per km of Sample Subprojects  \n($) \n \nChhattisgarh \n\nMadhya Pradesh  \n\nItem \n \nRoad (earthwork, pavement) \nCross-drainage works   \n\nTotal Cost \n\n \n\n36,200 \n  8,000 \n44,200 \n\n35,500 \n  5,900 \n41,400 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 7  \n\n41\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA AND APPROVAL PROCESS FOR SUBPROJECTS \n\nA. \n\nSubproject Selection \n\nSelection of road connectivity subprojects by the Ministry of Rural Development (MORD) \n1. \nwill  be  subject  to  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approval.  The  criteria  for  selecting  \nsubprojects follow: \n \n\n(i)  Subprojects will cover rural roads that lack an all-weather road connection. \n\n(ii)  Subprojects will be eligible for construction or upgrading in accordance with the \nPradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) guidelines, and be included in the \nrespective district core network. \n\n(iii) \n\nIdentification of priority link roads will be based on a ranking using criteria defined \nin  the  PMGSY  guidelines:  (a)  provide  new  connectivity  to  unconnected \nhabitations  with  a  population  greater  than  1,000  (500  in  the  case  of  scheduled \nareas as given in the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of India); and (b) provide \nnew connectivity  to  unconnected  habitations  with  a  population  greater  than  500 \n(250 in the case of scheduled areas as given in Fifth Schedule to the Constitution \nof India). \n\n(iv)  Subprojects will be ranked using an area approach, selecting packages of roads \nthat contain (a) the link road that connects the highest priority habitation; (b) the \nthrough  road  that  serves  the  link  road;  and  (c)  other  eligible  link  roads  that \nconnect to the through route. \n\n(v)  Subprojects  will  be  technically  feasible,  and  a  detailed  project  report  will  be \n\nprepared. \n\n(vi)  Road  safety  audit  of  the  subproject  will  have  been  conducted  and  necessary \n\nroad safety mitigation measures incorporated in the subproject designs. \n\n(vii) \n\nFor each selected package of road subprojects [see (iv)], economic analysis will \nbe prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of \nProjects as amended from time to time and the estimated economic internal rate \nof  return  (EIRR)  of  the  package  will  be  at  least  10-12%,  except that each state \nmay  assign  up  to  15%  of  annual  project  road  construction  expenditure  to \npackages  in  very  poor  and  remote  areas  on  the  basis  of  a  weighting  of \nsocioeconomic  indicators  of  economic  potential,  incidence  of  poverty,  and \ndifficulty of access, as acceptable to ADB. \n\n(viii)  Subprojects  will  be  socially  sound,  and  minimize  the  need  for  land  acquisition, \n\nand include measures to mitigate any social impacts they will cause. \n\n(ix)  An  initial  social  assessment  (ISA)  for  the  subproject  will  have  been  prepared  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis, as amended \nfrom time to time. \n\n(x) \n\nIf  a  subproject  involves  any  land  acquisition,  it  will  be  included  in  a  land \nacquisition plan (LAP) to be prepared following the measures set forth in the land \nacquisition  framework  (LAF)  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement, 1995, as amended from time to time, and submitted to \nADB for review and approval before civil works contracts are awarded. \n\n(xi) \n\nIf  any  indigenous  peoples/scheduled  tribes  are  likely  to  be  significantly  affected \nby  a  subproject,  an  indigenous  people\u2019s  development  plan  (IPDP)  following  the \nmeasures  set  forth  in  the  IPDP  framework  will  be  prepared  in accordance with \n\n\f \n\n42\n\nAppendix 7 \n\nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples, 1998, as amended from time to time,  and \nsubmitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  before  civil  works  contracts  are \nawarded. \n\n(xii)  Subprojects  will  be  environmentally  sound,  and  none  will  be  located  within  an \nenvironmentally  sensitive  area,  such  as  a  wildlife  sanctuary,  national  parks,  or \nother area having significant ecological functions. \n\n(xiii)  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  report  will  have  been  prepared  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines,  2003,  as \namended from time to time. \n\n(xiv)   Sufficient government counterpart funding will be allocated by the Government or \nstate governments, as required to implement the subproject as scheduled. \n\n(xv)  All necessary central and state government approvals will have been obtained. \n\n \nB. \n\nApproval Process for Subprojects \n\n2. \nAll  subprojects  must  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  guidelines,  and  satisfy  ADB\u2019s \nprocedures  for  subproject  preparation,  including  the  technical,  operational,  environmental, \nsocial, and resettlement dimensions. In respect of the sample subprojects, these requirements \nwere  met  during  project  preparation.  For  additional  subprojects  the  requirement  will  be  met \nduring project implementation.  \n \n3. \nTwo  months  before  starting  procurement  action  for  the  additional  subprojects  for \ninclusion  in  the  second,  third,  and  fourth  annual  batches,  the  implementing  agencies  (IAs) \nthrough  MORD  will  submit  to  ADB  for  approval  a  report  providing  details  of  the  compliance of \neach proposed subproject in the batch with the selection criteria (para. 1). The approval process \nfor each batch of additional subprojects will be as follows: \n \n\n(i)  With the assistance of project implementation consultants (PICs), the IA prepares \na consolidated report indicating the compliance of each proposed subproject with \nthe selection criteria, including an overall IEE for all subprojects, which will focus \non any environmental problems identified and mitigation required, and including \nan ISA, LAP, and, if necessary, IPDP for each area.1  \n\n(ii)  With the assistance of the project management consultant (PMC),  the National \nRural  Roads  Development  Agency  (NRRDA)  of  MORD  as  per  PMGSY \nGuidelines,  screens  the  report,  arranges  for  any  refinements  to  meet  ADB \nrequirements,  and  prepares  a  summary  checklist  summarizing  the  eligibility, \npreparation status, and safeguard compliance of each subproject. \n\n(iii)  Subject to addressing any modification as required under clause (iv) above, the \n\nIA submits the report and checklist through MORD to ADB for approval. \n\n(iv) \n\nThe ADB approves the proposed subprojects, subject to any further modifications \nrequired. \n\n(v)  Subject to addressing any modification as required under clause (iv) above, the \n\nIA proceeds with procurement for the subprojects approved by ADB. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1 Each PIC will be responsible for providing the IA with a report covering the districts under its responsibility, including \nan IEE, ISA, LAP, and, if necessary, IPDP. The IA will then prepare a consolidated report for all subprojects in the \nstate, including a consolidated IEE, ISA, LAP, and, if necessary, IPDP. \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n43 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nItem \n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN  \n($ million) \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n(%) \n\n \nADB \n\n \nGovt \n\n \n1.

Under  the  Project,  road  subprojects,  which  will  typically  be  about  3-8  km  long,  will  be \nselected  and  implemented  in  clusters  of  adjacent  roads  within  districts.  Due  to  the  sector \nlending  approach,  a  sample  of  about  1,000  km  was  selected  for  detailed  preparation  before \nBoard  consideration,  with  the  remaining  10,000  km  to  be  similarly  prepared  during  project \nimplementation.  The  economic  analysis  examined  794  km  of  sample  subprojects  comprising \n375 km in CG and 419 km in MP, equivalent to about 7% of the total roads to be built under the \nProject.  \n \n2. \nIn  the  economic  evaluation,  the  without-project  case  represents  the  current  situation \nwhereby  villages  are  served  by  rudimentary  earth  roads.  The  with-project  case  represents \nimprovement to all-weather standard. Road improvement will reduce operating costs, leading to \nincreased  economic  activity  and  growth  in  traffic.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR) \ncompared the annual streams of economic capital and operating costs and benefits. All costs, \nbenefits, and revenues were expressed in 2003 constant prices. The analysis period is for the \nconstruction  period  followed  by  20  years  of  operation.  The  detailed  assumptions  for  the \neconomic analysis and distribution analysis are in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n1. \n\nTraffic Volumes and Traffic Forecasts \n\n \n3. \nClassified  traffic  counts  for  the  project  roads  in  2002  were  obtained  from  the  two  state \ngovernments.  Field  surveys  and  traffic  surveys  were  carried  out  in  2003  to  verify  the  traffic \ncount, and convert them to an annual average daily traffic (ADT) basis. The traffic counts were \nseparated  into  motorized  traffic  (cars/utility,  buses,  trucks,  tractors,  and  motorcycles)  and \nnonmotorized  traffic  (bicycles  and  animal-drawn vehicles). Traffic volumes on most subproject \nroads averaged around 100 vehicles per day, of which about 40-50% were motorized and 50-\n60% nonmotorized.  \n \n4. \nDifferent traffic categories were distinguished for forecasting purposes: (i) normal traffic, \n(ii)  generated  traffic,  and  (iii)  induced  traffic.  Normal  traffic  is  traffic  that  would  use  the  sample \nsubproject roads irrespective of whether they are improved. Generated traffic is traffic that did \nnot  use  the  road  before  improvement  but  will  be  attracted  after  improvement  due  to  the \nreduction in travel cost or in travel time. Induced traffic is additional traffic caused by growth in \nlocal economic development as a result of road improvement.  \n \n5. \nFor normal traffic, the forecast growth rates for freight traffic were based on analysis of \ngross  domestic  product  and  the  income  elasticity  of  transport  demand.  Forecast  growth  of \npassenger traffic was based on the population growth rate, per capita income growth, and the \nincome elasticity of transport demand. The adopted traffic growth rates varied between 4% and \n9%  per  annum  depending  on  vehicle  type.  Based  on  the  average  vehicle  composition  for  the \ntotal  sample  of  subproject  roads,  the  forecast  overall  growth  rate  was  approximately  7%  for \n2003-2010 and 6.3% beyond 2010.  \n\n\f \n\n      \n\nAppendix 11       \n\n47\n\nGenerated and induced traffic were considered for motorized vehicles only. Both traffic \n6. \ntypes will be attracted to the improved subproject roads. Generated traffic was estimated using \nthe  price  elasticity  of  demand.1  In  the  first  year  after  improvement,  generated  traffic  was \nestimated  at  30-60%  of  normal  traffic,  depending  on  vehicle  type  and  the  respective  price \nelasticity  of  demand.  To  assess  the  induced  traffic  potential  of  the  subproject  roads,  traffic \nsurveys  were  conducted  for  30  similar  rural  road  improvements  in  CG  and  MP  that  had  been \ncompleted and has been opened to traffic for 1-2 years. The actual traffic in the opening years \nwas  compared  with  what  would  be  expected  on  the  basis  of  the  original  traffic  before \nimprovement,  normal  traffic  growth,  and  estimated  generated  traffic.  Sudden  jumps  in  traffic \nvolumes were observed, to the extent that actual traffic was often more than 150% greater than \nforecast normal traffic. A conservative estimate for induced traffic assumed that that this would \neventually  equal  100%  of  base  year  traffic,  but  would  be  phased  in  over  the  first  5  years \noperations,  since  changes  in  economic  development  in  the  areas  served  by  subproject  roads \nwill be gradual. \n \n\n2. \n\nCosts \n\n7. \nThe  economic  costs  of  the  subprojects  were  derived  from  the  financial  costs.  They \ninclude  construction  and  maintenance  costs,  and  exclude  price  contingencies,  taxes,  duties, \nand  interest  during  construction.  A  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.90  was  applied  to  financial \ncosts of nontraded inputs to calculate economic prices. A shadow wage rate factor (SWRF) of \n0.7 was used to obtain the economic costs of unskilled labor. The subprojects were expected to \nhave an average economic life of 20 years.  \n \n\n3. \n\nBenefits \n\n8. \nThe  major  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  were  quantified  in  terms  of  (i) vehicle \noperating cost savings arising from the improved road surface, (ii) time savings due to reduced \njourney  time  on  improved  roads,  and  (iii)  savings  in  the  marketable  surplus  of  agricultural \nproducts due to reduction in spoilage of goods traveling along the project roads.   \n \n9. \nBenefits  for  normal,  generated,  and  induced  traffic  were  estimated  using  the  Roads \nEconomic  Decision  model  for  economic  evaluation  of  low-volume  roads.  The  model  predicts \npavement  deterioration  and  estimates  yearly  vehicle  operating  costs  over  the  life  of  the \ninvestment.  The  model  also  calculates  the  time  savings  attributable  to  each  vehicle  type.  The \nbenefits to generated and induced traffic were calculated by assuming that the demand curve is \nlinear with respect to cost, and the benefit per unit of traffic is half that of normal traffic.  \n \n\n4. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\nThe economic evaluation discounted the stream of costs and benefits over 2004-2024, \n10. \nvalued in 2003 prices. The EIRR was calculated for each district cluster of sample subprojects, \nbased  on  estimates  for  individual  sample  subprojects,  and  for  the  sample  subprojects  as  a \nwhole.  The  EIRR  for  the  sample  subprojects  as  a  whole  was  26.6%.  The  EIRRs  for  district \nclusters  of  subprojects  and  for  the  sample  subprojects  as  a  whole,  are  summarized  in  Table \nA11.1. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   At a price elasticity of demand of one, a 10% decrease in transport cost will give rise to a 10% increase in traffic. \n\n\fTable A11.1: Summary of Net Present Value and Economic Internal Rate of Return \nfor the Sample Subproject Roads \n\nNumber \nof Roads \n \n\n Length \n(km) \n\nNPV \n(Rs Million) \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n\n \n\n \n\n48\n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\nDistrict \n \n\nState \n \nMadhya Pradesh  Betul \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nBhopal \nGuna \nJhabua \nMorena \nSehore \nSeoni \nSidi \nUjjain \n \n\n \n\n \n\nState Total \n\nMahasamund \n\n \nChhattisgarh \n\n \nBastar \n  Bilaspur \n  Durg \n  Kawardaha \n  Korba \n\n77 \n \n4 \n8 \n8 \n5 \n7 \n5 \n6 \n4 \n2 \n5 \n \n54 \n \n131 \nSource: TA  3914-IND, Rural Road Sector Development Project. \n \n\n  Raigarh \n  Raipur \n  Rajnandgaon \n  Sarguja \n \n \n\nOverall Total \n\nState Total \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5. \n\nSensitivity and Risk Analysis \n\n10 \n7 \n10 \n12 \n6 \n4 \n14 \n4 \n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n44.95 \n24.18 \n48.60 \n54.11 \n50.68 \n26.29 \n60.38 \n50.41 \n59.19 \n\n418.79 \n \n44.57 \n28.51 \n44.65 \n31.30 \n29.95 \n60.50 \n44.94 \n32.90 \n28.00 \n30.13 \n \n375.45 \n \n794.24 \n\n \n\n \n\n48.96 \n38.47 \n27.08 \n144.16 \n94.65 \n30.27 \n323.59 \n128.37 \n10.02 \n\n845.57 \n \n74.36 \n13.62 \n182.19 \n135.19 \n46.38 \n118.36 \n113.85 \n107.68 \n97.93 \n241.62 \n \n\n1,131.18 \n\n \n\n1,976.75 \n\n19.1 \n21.3 \n15.6 \n30.1 \n23.6 \n20.0 \n46.9 \n25.1 \n13.0 \n \n24.3 \n \n25.9 \n15.0 \n31.0 \n35.8 \n21.3 \n21.1 \n28.4 \n30.3 \n33.4 \n60.9 \n \n29.0 \n \n26.6 \n\nThe sensitivity of the EIRR for the total sample subprojects was analyzed with respect to \n11. \nchanges  in  the  benefit  and  cost  streams.

The \neconomic  analysis  model  performed  the  risk  analysis  based  on  triangular  probability \ndistributions  for  the  main  input  parameters.  This  enables  analysis  to  be  made  based  on  the \nuncertainty  present  in  the  estimates  of  the  input  parameters  to  generate  results  that  show  all \npossible outcomes. Risk analysis  was  undertaken  for  the  total  sample  of  subproject  roads2 by \nrunning  a  simulation  in  which  possible  values  of  the  variables  were  randomly  sampled  1,000 \ntimes using a Monte Carlo nonstratified technique. The results are summarized in Table A11.3. \nUnder the tests conducted there is only a 3.8% probability that the EIRR will fall below 12%. \n \n\nTable A11.3: Risk Analysis for Total Sample of Subprojects \n\nScenario \nBase EIRR \nProbability of EIRR less than 12% \nMinimum EIRR estimate \nMaximum EIRR estimate \nMedian EIRR estimate \n\n(%) \n26.6 \n3.8 \n5.1 \n64.6 \n25.1 \n\n \nC. \n\nDistribution Analysis and Poverty Impact Ratio \n\n14. \nDistribution analysis was used to disaggregate the estimated economic benefits among \npassenger  and  freight  users,  vehicle  owners/operators,  labor,3  and  the  government.  The \nassessment  of  the  poverty  impact  ratio  (PIR)  examined  how  much  each  of  the  different \nstakeholders would benefit from the project, and what proportion for each group of stakeholders \nis poor. The starting point  was  to  estimate  the  share  of  benefits  accruing  to  each  category  of \nvehicles,  including  passenger  and  freight  vehicles  as  well  as  nonmotorized  traffic.  It  was \nnecessary to identify not only the beneficiaries (owners/operators, road users, etc.) but also the \nproportion  of  each  beneficiary  category  that  is  poor.  It  was  also  necessary  to  estimate  (i)  how \n                                                 \n2   Additionally, individual road subprojects were also analyzed and results are detailed in Supplementary Appendix I. \n3   As some of subproject capital expenditure and maintenance costs will be spent on local labor, unskilled laborers \nwill gain net benefits to the extent that their paid wages are higher than their opportunity cost of labor (reflected in \nthe SWRF).  \n\n\f \n\n50\n\nAppendix 11 \n\nmuch of the benefits for each vehicle category in the analysis will be passed on to the user of \nthe vehicle, and (ii) the ownership of each vehicle category. For this purpose, field surveys were \nundertaken  of  passengers,  drivers,  and  farmers  in  sample  subproject  districts  in  CG  and  MP. \nFrom  these  surveys  a  series  of  assumptions  were  developed  regarding  benefits  that  will  be \npassed on to users of transport services. Distribution analysis was used to estimate a poverty \nimpact ratio (PIR) based on assumptions of how much of the benefits to each class of user will \nbe  passed  on  to  the  poor.  The  assumptions  were  made  from  the  information  collected  in  field \nsurveys and other relevant data. The assumptions are described in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n15. \nTable A11.4 shows the distribution of benefits for the total sample of subproject roads in \npresent value terms, using a discount rate of 12%, and the calculation of the PIR. The estimated \nPIR was 1.32, indicating that the total net economic benefits reaching the poor will exceed the \noverall total net economic benefits.4 This indicates that the Project is highly pro-poor. \n \n\nTable A11.4: Distribution of Net Benefits (Rs million) and Estimation of  \nPoverty Impact Ratio \n\nFinancial \nPresent \nValue \n \n \n0 \n\n \n \n\nEconomic \nPresent \nValue \n\nEconomic \nLess \nFinancial \n\nPassenger \nUsers \n\n \n \n\nLabor \n\nGovt/ \nEconomy \n\n \nNet \n\nFreight \nUsers \n\nVehicle \nOwners \n \n \n376.52  2,292.19 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n3,822.14 \n\n3,822.14 \n\n1,063.37 \n\n \n\n90.06 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n(1,694.40) \n(322.98) \n(103.60) \n \n\n(2,120.98) \n\n(1,491.88) \n(280.99) \n(72.51) \n \n\n1,976.76 \n\n \n \n202.52 \n41.99 \n31.09 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n31.09 \n \n31.09 \n\n \n \n202.52 \n41.99 \n \n \n334.57 \n\n4,097.74 \n\n1,063.37 \n\n376.52  2,292.19 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nGains and Losses \nProportion of the Poor (%) \nNet Benefits for the Poor \n\n1,063.37 \n80 \n850.69 \n\n376.52  2,292.19 \n\n50 \n\n75 \n\n186.26  1,719.14 \n\n31.09 \n80 \n24.87 \n\n(1,786.41) \n10 \n(178.64) \n\n1,976.76 \n \n2,604.33 \n\n \n \n\n1.32 \nNote: The net loss to the government/economy of negative 1,786.41 is calculated as the sum of negative 2,120.98 and +334.57.  \nSource: TA 3914-IND, Rural Road Sector Development Project; ADB staff estimates. \n\n \n \n\n \nPoverty Impact Ratio \n\n \n\n \nA  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  PIR  was  prepared  to  test  the  impact  of  changes  in  key \n16. \nassumptions.

The  Project  is  part  of  the  Pradhan  Mantri  Gram  Sadak  Yojana \n(PMGSY),  a  national  program  also  known  as  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Rural  Roads  Project. \nPMGSY, which began in 2001, aims to reduce poverty in rural areas by providing all-weather \nconnectivity to habitations with a population of 1,000 or more by 2003, and to habitations with \n500 or more by 2007. A special provision is to include settlements with populations over 250 \npeople  in  hilly,  desert,  and  tribal  areas.  The  roads  range  from  1  to  22  km  and  will  link \npreviously isolated villages to provincial, state, and national road networks.   \n \nProject areas are currently isolated for up to 4 months during monsoon season. The situation \ncontributes to poverty by reducing access to social services\u2014notably health and education\u2014\nveterinary and agricultural support services, markets, and various affirmative  action  programs \nfor  disadvantaged  groups.  Where  all-weather  connectivity  is  provided,  all  socioeconomic \ngroups  benefit.  Studies  comparing  completed  PMGSY  roads  with  unimproved  roads  (control \nsample)  provide  indications  of  the  benefits  the  Project  will  bring  to  the  rural  population  in  the \nproject area.  \n \nAgricultural  diversification  has  rapidly  followed  the  provision  of  all-weather  roads  to  district \nmarkets, potentially increasing the incomes of farmers in all income groups. Milk and vegetable \nproduction  can  potentially  increase  annual  incomes  of  marginal  farmers  by  Rs4,000-8,000 a \nyear, of small farmers by Rs20,000 or more, and of farmers with medium-size or large holdings \nby Rs50,000 or more.  Increased nonagricultural investment  mainly by the non-poor,  occurred \nin enterprises ranging from small shops and service businesses to transport enterprises. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSocial service delivery, access, and social status of the villages have improved, with increased \nattendance  by  teachers  and  health  personnel,  and  more  frequent  supplies  for  various \ngovernment  poverty  relief  programs.  Access  to  social  services  beyond  the  village  improved \nbecause  improved  transportation  services  made  distant  services  accessible  on  a  daily,  year-\nround basis. Attendance at middle and high schools outside the village increased. All groups, \nincluding  the  poorest,  commented  on  the  benefit  that  the  upgrading  had  on  increasing  the \nsocial status of the village and the families living there. \n\nGender  Impacts :  Improved  connectivity  and  transportation  improved  the  conditions  and \nopportunities  for  raising  the  social,  educational,  and  health  status  of  girls  and  women,  and \npreconditions  for  safe  motherhood.  In  one  village  it  was  recorded  that  more  girls  were  being \nsent  to  high  school  outside  the  village  when  transport  services  improved.  Women  also \nbenefited from more frequent contact with their families in distant locations. \n\nPoverty  Impacts :  Control  studies  (conducted  close  to  project  locations  during  project \npreparation)  of  communities  provided  with  upgraded  all-weather  roads  in  recent  years \nconfirmed that the Project will decrease poverty by removing economic and social development \nbarriers created by isolation. The studies showed that in both states quality and frequency of \nservice delivery within the villages improved and access to social services beyond the village\u2014\nincluding health, education, finance, veterinary and agricultural support services \u2014and various \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nthat \n\nimproved  connectivity \n\nincreased  opportunities \n\npoverty relief and affirmative action programs for disadvantaged groups became available on a \ndaily, year-round basis. Attendance at middle and high schools outside the village increased, \nparticularly  among  girls,  who  were  permitted,  in  increasing  numbers,  to  continue  education \nbeyond the primary level when transport became available. The social status of the village and \nthe  families  who  lived  there  improved.  Improved  transport  services  and  traveling  conditions \nincreased  opportunities  for  those  dependent  on  wage  labor  to  seek  employment  in  nearby \ntowns, and more opportunities to commute between the workplace and village. Some landless \nhouseholds benefited from new opportunities to make small investments such as raising cows \nand operating roadside stalls.    \n \nThe studies showed that economic diversification occurs rapidly following the provision of all-\nweather  road  access  to  district  markets,  increasing  the  incomes  of  farmers  in  all  income \ngroups.  Production  and  marketing  of  high-value  perishable  products  such  as  milk  and \nvegetables  became  possible  on  a  commercial  basis,  thus  potentially  increasing  annual \nincomes  of  marginal  farmers  by  Rs15,000  a  year  or  more,  of  small  farmers  by  Rs20,000  or \nmore, and farmers with medium -size or large holdings by Rs50,000 or more. Landless laborers \nreported \nto  access  higher-paid, \nnonagricultural work, and enabled many laborers to commute instead of live in squatter camps \nfar  from  their  homes.  The  landless  poor  also  increased  their  incomes  by  making  small \ninvestments such as raising cows and operating roadside stalls. Overall, connectivity increased \ninvestments  in  nonagricultural  micro-enterprises and larger investments in transport services. \nCommunities  with  all-weather  road  access  are  more  likely  to  attract  assistance  from  existing \nand proposed district poverty reduction projects. \n \nB.  \n \n      The Madhya Pradesh Human Development Report (1998), which was compiled before the \ndivision of MP in 2000 to create the new state of CG, ranks MP (including CG) 15th out of 16 \nmajor states in terms of human development indices.1 An ADB study of poverty data nationwide \nranks  MP  7th  out  of  16  major  states  on  the  basis  of  rural  poverty  head  count  statistics.2  The \nlatest state government data for MP show that 37.4% of the state population and 37.6% of the \nrural  population  were  living  below  the  poverty  line  in  1999-2000,  compared  with  national \naverages of 26% and 27.1%, respectively. \n \nOn  the  basis  of  poverty-line  data,  the  rural  population  of  these  states  rank  among  the  seven \npoorest states in India.3 The estimated proportion of families living below the poverty line in the \ndistrict project areas is 49-76% in MP and 50-58% in CG, which is considerably higher than the \n1999-2000  state  average  for  MP  of  32.28%. 4  The  Project  will  be  assisting  people  living  in \nisolated and remote areas where economic opportunities and services are scarce. The project \npreparatory studies indicate poverty rates in these areas are well above the rural averages for \nMP and CG. On the MP deprivation index, the districts range from 0.389 in peri-urban Bhopal \nto  0.533  in  rural  Guna. 5  Major  factors  underlying  poverty  in  the  project  areas  are  (i)  physical \nisolation and lack of transport connectivity, as well as (ii) landlessness; (iii) uneconomic size of \nlandholding; (iv) effects of drought and lack of access to irrigation; and (iv) social exclusion due \nto  low  caste  or  tribal  status.  Rural  poverty  is  generally  associated  with  deprivation  of  assets, \n\nPoverty Intervention \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                                 \n1   Madhya Pradesh Human Development Report 1998.

The social and economic inequality \nof  men  and  women  is  a  further  dimension  of  poverty,  one  that  is  more  pronounced  in  rural \nMadhya  Pradesh.  Women's  economic  and  educational  opportunities  are  restricted  by  early \nmarriage  and  seclusion  or  restricted  mobility.  Codes  of  female  propriety  outweigh  the \nconsiderations of efficiency and productivity, so even poor men use bicycles to transport fuel, \nmilk  and  other  goods,  but  all  women  (except  for  those  who  can  afford  to  remain  secluded  in \ntheir homes) must walk, and carry water and fuel and fodder on their heads.   \n \nC.  \n  \n \nDuring project preparation, participatory consultations were conducted with all stakeholders in \nall project locations. The project beneficiaries were unanimous in their desire for the project to \nproceed, and keenly aware of its prospective benefits to them. The Project is featured in and \ncomplements the development plans of both states to reduce poverty, including their DPIPs,6 \nimprove the quality of life of the rural poor, and increase rural productivity. Nongovernment \norganizations  will  be  involved  in  monitoring  the  implementation  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement plan. \n \nD.  \n \n\nPotential Issues \n\nIssues \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nOutput  \n\nSignificant/ \nNon- \nsignificant/ \nnone \n\nLand \nacquisition \nand \nresettlement \n\nGender \n\nNo \n\nLAP, LAF \n\nNon- \nsignificant \n\nSignificant   No  resettlement  is  required  but  a  land \nacquisition  plan  (LAP)  has  been  prepared \nfor  sample  subprojects  and  a \nland \nacquisition  framework  (LAF)  for  additional \nsubprojects.
