Of  these,  about\n370,000  people,  or  74,000  poor  families,  are  expected  to  move  above\nthe  poverty  line  in  11  districts  in  six  provinces  of  Indonesia:  Central\nKalimantan,  East  Kalimantan,  South  Kalimantan,  Central  Sulawesi,\nNorth  Sulawesi,  and  Southeast  Sulawesi.  Community-based  savings\nand loan organizations (CBSLOs) will be formed and trained to support\nmicroenterprises and small enterprises, and needed rural infrastructure\nwill  be  provided  to  promote  rural  urban  linkages.  The  Project  will\nrevitalize poverty reduction efforts in the rural sector by supporting the\nGovernment\u2019s  program  to  devolve  development  resources  to  local\ngovernments  and  strengthening  the  institutional  and  human  resource\ncapacity necessary to enable rural communities nationwide to plan and\nmanage  local  development  initiatives.  About  40  more  districts  from  20\nnew  provinces  will  benefit  from  the  institutional  and  capacity-building\nprogram to support the Government decentralization efforts.\n\nClassification\n\nPrimary: Poverty reduction\nSecondary: Human resources development\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nCategory  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination  was  undertaken  and\nthe summary is presented as a supplementary appendix.\n\nRationale\n\nGovernment\u2019s  successful  poverty \nreduction  program  suffered  a\nsignificant  set  back  due  to  the  recent  economic  crisis.  Although  the\nincidence  of  poverty  has  since  returned  to  its  pre-crisis  level  of  18.2\npercent, the crisis demonstrated that economic shocks could cause high\nsurges  in  the  incidence  of  poverty.  It  also  highlighted  the  need  for  a\nlong-term  strategy  based  on  social  inclusion  and  addressing  capability\ndeprivation of the poor to make a significant impact on poverty. Lack of\nformal  financial  services  and  institutional  support  from  districts  and\nurban  business  communities  are  particularly  common  impediments  to\nincreasing  rural  enterprise  development.  The  Project  aims  to  remove\nthese constraints. Past experience indicates that decentralized decision\nmaking  and  devolving \nlocal  government\nsignificantly  decreases  the  cost  of  development  implementation  and\nincreases \nlocal\nthe  direct  benefits  of  development  projects \ncommunities. From that perspective, the Project is intended to support\nthe  Government\u2019s  renewed  efforts  since  April  1999  to  decentralize\ndecision  making  and  devolve  development \nlocal\ngovernments and communities. Two new laws that were passed in 1999\ngrant autonomy to district and village governments, in effect giving them\ntheir  own  resources  with  which  to  plan  and  manage  their  own\ndevelopment  based  on  local  needs.  Such  decision-making  powers\nunderscore  the  need  for  adequate  institutional  capacity  to  effect  the\ndemocratic  processes  of  decision  making  now  entrusted  to  local\ngovernments  and  communities.  Under  this  framework,  the  Project  is\naimed  at  supporting  formal  and  informal  training  and  decision-making\nprocesses  that  would  give  local  communities  and  government  the\n\nresources  directly \n\nresources \n\nfor \n\nto \n\nto \n\n\fObjectives and\nScope \n\niii\n\nrequired institutional capacity to better utilize the resources for poverty\nreduction and improvement of the quality of life in their communities.\n\nThe development goal is to increase the real incomes of the poor and in\nparticular,  rural  communities  on  the  periphery  of  regional  growth\ncenters.  The  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i)  empower  rural\ncommunities  by  strengthening  their  capacity  to  plan  and  manage  their\nown  development  activities,  and  (ii)  support  investments,  foster  rural-\nurban linkages, and establish rural infrastructure to promote agricultural\nproductivity and off-farm business enterprises.\n\nto \n\nThe  Project  will  have  four  components.  Part  A  will  support  (i)  an\ninstitutional  development  process \nimprove  community-based\nplanning mechanisms to help local government and village communities\nplan  and  implement  development  programs  according  to  the  new\ndecentralization  laws,  (ii)  human  resource  development  to  support\nformal degree training for 1,773 staff of the Directorate General of Rural\nCommunity Empowerment (DGRCE) and local governments involved in\ncommunity  development,  and  (iii)  a  village  grant  to  support  the\ncommunity  training  program.  Part  B  will  support  the  establishment  of\nCBSLOs in the targeted areas of Kalimantan and Sulawesi (about 750\nvillage  communities)  so  that  the  targeted  communities  would  have  the\ncapacity  to  obtain  and  service  loans  from  financial  institutions  for\nmicroenterprise development. A credit line of $15.0 million from the loan\nthrough  regional  development  banks  or  Bank\nwill  be  provided \nPembangunan Daerah  (BPDs).  Part  C  will  support  the  construction  of\nrural \nlink  poor\ncommunities  to  markets.  Part  D  will  provide  support  for  project\nmanagement and monitoring.\n\ntargeted  communities \n\ninfrastructure \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nto \n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe  estimated  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  $170.2  million  equivalent,\ncomprising  about  $45.5  million  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $124.7\nmillion equivalent in local currency costs.\n\nFinancing Plan1\n\n                                                                                                                ($ million)\n\nSource\nAsian Development Bank\n       OCR\n       ADF\n\nSubtotal\n\nGovernment\n\nTotal\n\n27.3\n18.2\n45.5\n\n0.0\n\n45.5\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nPercent\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n65.0\n50.0\n115.0\n\n55.2\n\n68\n\n32\n\n37.7\n31.8\n69.5\n\n55.2\n\nADF = Asian Development Fund, OCR = ordinary capital resources.\n\n124.7\n\n170.2\n\n100\n\n Loan Amounts and\nTerms\n\nTwo  loans  comprising  (i)  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial Drawing Rights 38,752,000 from the Asian Development Bank\u2019s\n(ADB\u2019s) Special Funds resources (SFR), with an amortization period of\n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge at\n\n                                                \n1  Based  on  80  percent  financing  of  total  Project  cost  for  the  first  three  years  of  Project  implementation  and  60\n\npercent financing for the remaining three years.\n\n\fAllocation and\nRelending Terms\n\niv\n\nthe rate of 1 percent during the grace period and 1.5 percent thereafter,\nand  (ii)  the  loan  of  $65  million  equivalent  from  its  ordinary  capital\nresources (OCR), with interest to be determined in accordance with the\nADB pool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans, with a\nmaturity of 25 years, including a grace period of 6 years, a front-end fee\nof  1  percent  of  the  OCR  loan  amount,  and  an  annual  commitment\ncharge of 0.75 percent.\n\nMost    of    the    proceeds    of    the    ADB    loans    will    finance    capacity\nbuilding  and  training  for  communities  and  community  institutions  and\nlocal government workers; support the formation of CBSLOs in the rural\nareas for microenterprise and small enterprise investments and provide\nformal credit to CBSLOs through BPDs; and finance rural infrastructure\nto  link  rural  enterprises  to  markets  at  urban  growth  centers.  The\nMinistry  of  Finance  will  relend  a  part  of  the  OCR  funds  to  six  BPDs\nunder  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  at  an  interest  rate  of  not  less  than\nthe reference rate (defined as the average rate of interest prevailing for\n90-day  rupiah-denominated  Bank  Indonesia  Certificate  [SBI]  over  the\nmost recent three months). The interest rate will be reviewed annually\nby  ADB  and  the  Government.  The  BPD  will  onlend  to  CBSLOs  at  an\ninterest  rate  equivalent  to  the  interest  rate  payable  by  BPD  under  the\nrelevant  subsidiary  loan  agreement  plus  a  maximum  of  8  percent\nmargin, which is currently  about  20  percent.  The  interest  rate  charged\nby each CBSLO to its borrowing members would be set by its members\nbut  would  probably  be  between  30  and  33  percent,  corresponding\napproximately to the market rates prevailing in the project area.\n\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2007\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nThe Directorate General of Rural Community Empowerment (DGRCE)\nof the Ministry of Home Affairs and Regional Autonomy.\n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nProcurement\n\nAs  Executing  Agency,  DGRCE,  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project\nimplementation and coordination with the implementing agencies (IAs).\nIt  will  establish  a  project  management  office  (PMO)  in  Jakarta.  Each\nparticipating  province  will  coordinate  and  monitor  project-related\nactivities  in  several  districts,  and  will  establish  a  project  coordination\noffice  (PCO).  Project  implementation  at  the  district  level  will  be  the\nresponsibility  of  the  district  government,  which  will  serve  as  the  IA  in\neach  district.  Each  district  will  establish  a  project  implementation  unit\n(PIU)  for  this  purpose.  A  project  steering  committee  will  be  set  up  for\npolicy coordination at the national level. Each participating province will\nestablish  a  provincial  advisory  group  to  provide  full  liaison  and\ncoordination  with  their  PCOs  and  PIUs.  Each  participating  district  will\nestablish  a  district  advisory  group  to  advise  on  measures  to  address\nproblems affecting project implementation.\n\nGoods and services financed by ADB under the Project will be procured\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Simple  and\ntechnically  non-complicated  civil  works  costing  up  to  $50,000  will  be\nconstructed by villagers through community participation in accordance\nwith procedures acceptable to ADB, while relatively complex civil works\ncosting  up  to  $500,000  will  be  carried  out  on  the  basis  of  local\ncompetitive bidding (LCB). Utility vehicles, motorcycles, computers, and\n\n\fv\n\noffice equipment will be procured by international shopping or, if valued\nunder $100,000 equivalent, by direct purchase.\n\nConsulting Services About  1,054  person-months  of  consulting  services  (236  international,\nand  818  domestic)  for  supporting  project  implementation  will  be\nrequired.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Recruitment,  training,  and\nfielding  of  local  trainers  and  facilitators  will  be  contracted  to  qualified\nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  in  accordance  with  procedures\nacceptable to ADB.\n\n31 December 2006\n\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date\n\nProject Benefits\nand Beneficiaries\n\nThe Project will directly increase the incomes of poor families, through\nmicroenterprise  and  small  scale  enterprise  development  in  the  rural\nareas,  and  improve  linkages  to  markets,  social  and  health  services  by\nimproving  rural  infrastructure.  About  370,000  people,  or  74,000  poor\nfamilies, will increase their incomes to levels above the poverty line. The\nProject will directly benefit about 550,000 people, or 110,000 families, in\nthe  project  area,  equivalent  to  4  percent  of  the  population,  through\ncapacity  building  for  local  government,  employment,  and  enterprise\ndevelopment.  About  1.1  million  people,  or  220,000  families,  in  11\ndistricts  will  benefit  from  improved  rural  infrastructure  enabling  them\naccess  not  only  to  markets  in  nearby  urban  centers  for  their  products\nbut  also  to  social  and  health  services.  The  financial  internal  rate  of\nreturn  from  the  microenterprises  and  small  scale  enterprises  is\nestimated  at  45  percent,  which  adequately  covers  the  33  percent\ninterest rate on capital investment. The economic internal rate of return\nis estimated at about 17 percent. Nonquantifiable benefits are expected\nfrom the capacity-building component of the Project: strengthened rural\ncommunity  and \ntrained\ncommunity  development  workers.  Women  will  benefit  directly  from\ntraining \nfor\nservices \ncommunities  and \nmicroenterprises, most of which are expected to be women-owned.\n\ninstitutions  and  better \n\nlocal  government \n\nfinancial \n\nlocal \n\nfor \n\nAdvisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  financial  management\nsystem  will  assist  the  DGRCE  to  develop  a  system  for  disbursement,\nmonitoring,  and  accounting  of  funds  in  11  districts  in  six  provinces  to\nensure  accountability  and  transparency.  The  TA  will  provide  a  total  of\n51  person-months  of  international  (23)  and  domestic  (28)  consulting\nservices, inclusive of 12 months of NGO consortium services. The total\ncost of the TA is estimated at $1.4 million equivalent. The Government\nhas  requested  that    $1.1  million  be  financed  by  ADB  on  a  grant  basis\nfrom the Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility (ACCSF).The grant was\nprovided,  given  the  strong  focus  of  the  TA  on  good  governance  and\nin  support  of  poverty  reduction.

Subsequent discussions between the Government and ADB resulted in\nan  agreement  to  combine  the  two  studies  to  formulate  the  proposed  Project.  A  Loan\nReconnaissance  Mission  on  21-25  February  2000  discussed  with  Government  officials  a\nnumber of issues related to the design and processing of the combined Project. A Loan Fact-\nFinding  Mission  was  conducted  on  21  March-14  April  2000  and  an  Appraisal  Mission  on  5-26\nJune  2000.4  During  loan  fact-finding,  representatives  of  multilateral  and  bilateral  funding\nagencies  were  consulted  to  inform  them  about  the  Project  and  to  exchange  views  on\ndecentralization,  microfinance,  and  poverty  reduction.  This  report  is  based  on  the  findings  of\nthese  missions;  the  consultants\u2019  feasibility  study  reports;  socioeconomic  baseline  surveys;  an\ninitial  environmental  report;  and  consultations  with  national,  regional,  and  local  governments,\nregional development banks (BPDs), beneficiaries, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs),\nand  consultants.  Workshops  conducted  with  the  target  communities  helped  in  determining  the\ndesign,  scope,  and  implementation  arrangements  for  the  Project.  The  project  framework  is  in\nAppendix 1.\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1. \n\nPoverty in the Rural Sector\n\n3.\nPrior  to  the  economic  crisis  in  mid-1997,  Indonesia  had  a  sound  record  of  rapid\neconomic  growth,  steadily  rising  development  indicators,  and  an  impressive  reduction  in  the\nincidence of poverty. Official figures show that poverty declined steadily over a 20-year period,\nfrom  40  percent  in  1976  to  11.3  percent  in  February  1996.5    The  record  is  impressive,  but\nbecause  of  its  large  population  base,  in  absolute  terms,  Indonesia  has  the  largest  number  of\npoor people among the countries of Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Two thirds of the\nIndonesian poor are rural residents.\n\n                                                \n1  Starting on 23 August 2000, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Regional Autonomy have been merged\n\nto become the Ministry of Home Affairs and Regional Autonomy.\n\n2  TA  2858-INO:  Capacity  Building  for  Community  Development  Project,  for  $970,000,  approved  on  8  September\n\n1997.\n\n3  TA 3088-INO: Development of Rural-Urban Linkage Project, for $890,000, approved on 15 October 1998.\n4  The ADB team comprised A. T. Perez, Mission Leader; S.T. Chew, Senior Poverty Reduction Coordinator; W.H.\nMenninger,  Senior  Project  Engineer;  M.  K.  Mitchell,  Project  Economist;  N.  K.  Jain,  Programs  Economist;  O.\nTiwana, Counsel; L. Kulp, Economist (Social Sectors); M. Sultana, Social Development Specialist; and J. Tokeshi,\nProject Economist, Rural Finance.\n\n5  The consumption basket was revised in 1998. Under the revision, the incidence of poverty in 1996 was estimated\n\nat 17.7: 13.7 in the urban areas and 19.9 in the rural areas.\n\n\f2\n\nAs  a  result  of  the  economic  crisis  since  the  latter  half  of  1997,  spiraling  inflation  and\n4.\nlosses  of  employment  opportunities  plunged  a  large  proportion  of  the  population  into  transient\npoverty.  The  incidence  of  poverty  peaked  in  December  1998  at  24.2  percent6  (21.9  percent\nurban and 25.7 percent rural). However, starting in March 1999, Indonesia entered a period of\nprice  deflation,  particularly  in  the  price  of  rice.  This,  combined  with  the  slow  rise  in  nominal\nwages,  reversed  the  trend  and  the  incidence  of  poverty  began  to  abate.  By  August  1999,  the\nlatest available official measurement of poverty indicated that poverty had returned to near pre-\ncrisis  levels  of  18.2  percent  (15.1  percent  urban  and  20.2  percent  rural).  The  crisis  amply\ndemonstrated  that  economic  shocks  can  cause  dramatically  high  surges  in  the  incidence  of\npoverty costly to political and social stability, and long-term development. To make a significant\nimpact  on  rural  poverty,  combating  poverty  in  Indonesia  must  therefore  involve  prioritizing\ndevelopment  goals  \u2013  developing  a  well  thought-out  and  long-term  strategy  based  on  social\ninclusion \u2013 and addressing capability deprivation among the poor.\n\n5.\nGrowth in the rural economy has contributed significantly to Indonesia\u2019s stable economic\ngrowth  and  in  the  decline  of  poverty  over  the  past  two  decades.  Growth  in  the  rural  sector\nincreased  the  demand  for  labor  and  resulted  in  greater  employment  and  higher  real  wages  in\nthe  economy.  A  recent  study  of  the  real  wage  data  for  Indonesia  demonstrates  that  in  the\n1990s,  poverty  declines  were  inversely  related  to  real  wage  increases.7    Between  1990\nand1993, when real agricultural wages in Java increased by 19.2 percent, the number of poor\npeople declined by 4.8 percent. The relationship was even stronger during 1993-1996 when real\nwages  increased  by  14.2  percent  and  poverty  declined  by  13.1  percent.  Conversely,  as  real\nwages declined sharply during the economic crisis, poverty incidence increased equally sharply.\nMirroring  the  poverty  trends,  underemployment  (working  less  than  35  hours  a  week)  has\nremained  a  truly  rural  phenomenon.  A  recent  study  by  the  International  Labour  Organization\nfound that, while underemployment affected nearly 60 percent of employed farm workers, only\n25  percent  of  nonagricultural  workers  were  underemployed  in  1998.8  Furthermore,  a  larger\nproportion  of  underemployed  rural  workers  were  actively  seeking  work  compared  with  their\nurban  counterparts.  Improvements  in  real  wages  and  rapid  creation  of  jobs  for  unskilled  and\nsemi-skilled workers are thus key to a long-term strategy for poverty reduction.\n\n6.\nThe  economic  crisis  significantly  aggravated  the  poverty  situation,  but  the  political\nturmoil  that  followed  showed  the  weakness  of  focusing  on  income  alone  and  not  addressing\nalso  the  issues  of  social  exclusion,9  which  left  the  country  susceptible  to  political  unrest.  The\nconcept of social exclusion provides a good framework for discussing the factors affecting the\ncapability deprivation of the rural poor. The rural poor have been excluded from many activities\nthat  could  otherwise  allow  them  to  improve  their  income  and  quality  of  life.  The  political\nprocesses  in  rural  communities  have  largely  been  driven  by  appointed  officials.  Decisions  on\ndevelopment  priorities  emanating  from  central  ministries  not  only  exclude  the  poor  from  the\nprocess  of  setting  development  priorities,  but  also  provide  no  accountability  check  on  the\nperformance of the responsible authorities. Given the remoteness of many rural areas, the poor\ncan be physically excluded from markets, financial services, and social services (like health care\nand  education)  because  the  transaction  cost  to  gain  access  to  these  markets  or  services  is\nbeyond their means. The rural poor are also excluded from a broad body of information ranging\n\n                                                \n6  Based on the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, using the 1998 methodology.\n7  Papanek, G. and B.

Overly  centralized  planning  structures  tend  to\nfavor over-generalized selection criteria so that local demands and needs of socially vulnerable\ngroups are often overlooked. As a result of exclusion, many poverty-reduction programs are not\ndesigned with sufficient sensitivity to the poor so that services often miss their intended targets.\nMany programs are unsustainable for lack of local demand and ownership. In an effort to make\nthe system inclusive, bottom-up planning was introduced in Indonesia in 1981: village proposals\nwere  formulated  by  village  committees  representing  each  sector.  However,  studies  show  that\nonly 5-10 percent of the proposals generated at the village level and forwarded to higher levels\nwere funded. The reasons given for this lack of success included the lack of human resources\nto conduct the participatory processes adequately, lack of local planning skills, and dominance\nof district sectoral agencies in decision making.\n\n8.\nPoor  rural  communities  were  cut  off  from  economic  growth  in  the  past.  They  are,  as\nnoted  above,  physically  excluded  or  inadequately  linked  to  the  transportation  and  marketing\nnetworks that serve growth centers. Hence, lack of adequate rural infrastructure is a good proxy\nfor  the  many  related  constraints  faced  by  such  communities,  including  the  lack  of  social\nservices. Experience shows that communities can be relied upon to identify crucial linkages to\nmarkets,  and  are  capable  of  planning  and  implementing  the  construction  of  small  scale  rural\ninfrastructure.  Leaving  the  decision-making  powers  with  communities,  which  can  also  have  a\nsubstantial role in constructing infrastructure, fosters community ownership and transparency in\nimplementing  project  activities.  Similar  insights  were  drawn  from  experience  elsewhere  in\nAsia\u2014lack  of  rural  infrastructure  underlies  the  disadvantaged  economic  position  of  the  rural\npoor.10 In a recent World Bank survey of poverty in Indonesia, the poor unanimously cited lack\nof  income  generation  opportunities  as  an  underlying  cause  of  their  disadvantaged  economic\nposition.11  In  short,  groups  that  are  physically  excluded  from  the  mainstream  economy  are\ndeprived of the opportunity to expand their capabilities and remain trapped in a cycle of poverty.\n\n2.\n\nFinancial Institutions\n\n9.\nThe  communities  in  the  rural  areas  targeted  by  the  Project  show  a  wide  range  of\ncapabilities  to  produce  goods  and  services.  However,  lack  of  credit  and  lack  of  social\npreparation  suppress  the  entrepreneurial  initiatives  of  the  poor.  The  vast  majority  of\ncommunities,  especially  their  poorer  members,  have  no  access  to  formal  financial  services.\nEven schemes such as those operated by Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) through its village unit\nnetwork  do  not  reach  most  villages  and  tend  to  cater  to  those  with  incomes  well  above  the\npoverty line. It may also be noted that where BRI operates in the rural areas of Kalimantan and\nSulawesi, it has a complete or near monopoly which, naturally, it is reluctant to share. Another\nsuccessful approach to finance is the privately based credit unions (para. 13), but these are not\nyet  active  in  the  project  area.  Although  there  are  savings  groups  (arisan)  in  the  project  area,\nalmost always they are organized by women, whose members by choice are limited to 25 to 30.\nThe money from such a savings group is not enough to meet the business capital needs of all\nmembers or the needs for their children\u2019s education. As a result, a larger group \u2013 community-\n\n                                                \n10 TA 5767-REG: A Study of Rural Asia, for $1.8 million, approved on 29 December 1997.\n11 The World Bank survey of poverty in Indonesia (1999) was part of a global research effort entitled Consultations\n    with the Poor.\n\n\f4\n\nbased savings and loan organization (CBSLO), composed of men and women, and open to all\nmembers  of  the  community  has  been  designed  to  address  the  need  for  rural  financial\ninstitutions  in  the  project  area.  Special  care  will  be  taken  to  ensure  that  poor  members  of  the\ncommunity  are  accorded  equal  opportunity  to  become  members  of,  and  benefit  from,  CBSLO\nactivities.\n\n10.\nAt  present,  the  services  of  commercial  banks  are  not  available  in  the  project  area.\nNevertheless, six regional development banks (BPDs), have expressed interest in participating\nin  the  Project.12  In  the  past,  BPDs  were  essentially  involved  with  the  financing  of  local\ngovernment  and  government  employees\u2019  salaries,  together  with  collateral-backed  commercial\nlending  and  some  subsidized  credit  schemes.  Recently,  their  role  has  started  to  change  and\nthey are becoming more involved in the commercial development of their respective provinces.\nPotentially, they could develop into very useful alternative financial institutions as wholesalers of\ncredit  to  small  organizations  such  as  CBSLOs  in  the  project  area.  The  BPDs  recognize  that\ntaking  part  in  a  project  of  this  nature  is  challenging,  and  could  lead  to  a  much  stronger\ncontribution  to  the  development  of  financial  services  and  an  improvement  in  their  skills  in\nlending on a commercial risk-bearing basis. The BPDs have solid financial expertise; however,\nthey will need training in risk assessment in relation to small organizations engaged in savings\nand lending, such as the envisaged CBSLOs. As part of this training, the BPDs will be exposed\nto existing, successful primary credit unions or similar organizations to experience at firsthand\nthe process of initial formation and first stage development, the membership rules that have to\nbe established, and possible legal structures. From this process, they will develop the skills not\nonly for taking part in the project but also for continuing such activities after project completion.\n\nIt  is  noted  that  the  six  BPDs  have  limited  experience  in  providing  wholesale  credit  to\n11.\nnonbank organizations whose members are the ultimate borrowers. These funds were obtained\nfrom  Bank  Indonesia.  One  BPD,  BPD  South  Kalimantan,  has  had  broader  and  longer\nexperience in wholesaling credit, being a participant in the ADB Microcredit Project13 since the\nstart of the Project in 1994. Although the BPDs have their main headquarters in the provincial\ncapitals, they have a branch or subbranch in almost all of the project districts.\n\n12.\nMany  NGOs  have  been  effective  in  facilitating  social  preparation  of  communities  and\nformation  of  self-help  groups  able  to  access  formal  credit  and  to  plan  and  implement  village\nrural infrastructure projects, assisted by ADB, the World Bank and Japan Bank for International\nCooperation (JBIC). Such experience will be useful in forming the CBSLOs proposed under the\nProject. The participation of NGO facilitators has been incorporated in the project design. The\nconsultants who prepared the feasibility study identified 166 NGOs14 in six provinces.15 Between\nfour  and  eight  have  been  assessed  as  suitable  to  serve  as  facilitators  in  three  Sulawesi\nprovinces.  The  capability  of  NGOs  in  three  Kalimantan  provinces  will  be  assessed  during\nimplementation.\n\n13.\nThe  formation  of  any  savings  and  loan  organization  or  credit  union  such  as  the\nenvisaged CBSLOs depends, first and foremost, on the commitment of the membership. Hence,\n\n                                                \n12 The six are BPD Central Sulawesi, BPD North Sulawesi, BPD Southeast Sulawesi, BPD Central Kalimantan, BPD\nEast Kalimantan, and BPD South Kalimantan. The name identifies the province that owns the BPD and where it is\nlocated.\n\n13 Loan 1327-INO, for $25.7 million, approved on 25 October 1994.\n14 TA 3088-INO: Development of Rural-Urban Linkages Project, for $890,000, approved on 15 October 1998. Of the\ntotal, 11 NGOs each are found in East Kalimantan and Central Kalimantan, 12 in South Kalimantan, 23 in North\nSulawesi, 72 in Central Sulawesi, and 37 in South East Sulawesi.\n\n15 The six provinces are Central Sulawesi, North Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi, Central Kalimantan, East Kaliman-\n\ntan, and South Kalimantan.\n\n\f5\n\nthe  beginning  of  the  process  requires  an  extensive  introduction  of  prospective  members\n(including  poor  and  women  members)  to  the  concept  and  the  objectives  involved.  Visits  to\nexisting  organizations  or  by  members  of  such  organizations  can  help  enormously.  The\nintroduction  and  training  process  are  best  conducted  by  those  who  have  direct  experience\nelsewhere, especially NGOs or others independent of government. Indonesia has had a strong\ncooperative  movement  for  about  30  years.  The  Credit  Union  Federation  is  the  national-level\norganization of the Indonesian credit union movement. It has 27 regional chapters nationwide,\nincluding  three  regional  credit  unions  in  the  project  area:  one  each  in  North  Sulawesi,  South\nSulawesi,  and  Central  Sulawesi.  They  comprise  53  local  credit  unions  with  a  total  savings  of\nRp4,852  million  ($585,000  equivalent).  Although  there  are  no  credit  unions  in  the  three\nKalimantan  provinces,  there  is  one  regional  chapter  in  West  Kalimantan,  which  has  27  local\ncredit unions with savings of Rp14,288 million ($517,000 equivalent).\n\n14.\nThe basic rules and principles that a savings and loan organization (such as the CBSLO)\nneed to incorporate into its founding documentation can easily be drawn from the Credit Union\nFederation with wide experience in the field, but the members themselves should have the final\nsay. The same applies to procedures for making and recording savings, and later loans, as the\norganization  develops.  The  level  of  deposits,  membership,  and  activity  required  before\ndrawdown can be made by CBSLO will be subject to project guidelines, but will also depend on\nthe agreement reached with the BPD itself.\n\n3.\n\nWomen in Development\n\n15. Women  in  the  rural  areas  of  the  Project  contribute  to  economic  development  in  many\nways.  They  are  involved  in  agricultural  work,  participating  in  production  and  postharvest\nactivities. To augment farm income, women conduct petty trading by selling snacks and meals\nthey  prepare  at  home,  and  selling  vegetables  and  fruits  from  their  gardens.  Many  are  also\ninvolved  in  cottage  industries  such  as  making  rattan  mats  and  finishing  local  semiprecious\nstones.  They  also  seek  employment  as  farm  workers  or  daily  work  as  laborers  in  local\nconstruction  projects.  However,  women  in  the  project  area  suffer  from  low  wages  and  lack  of\naccess  to  capital,  skills  training,  appropriate  technology,  extension  services,  and  market\nfacilities.  Due  to  lack  of  access  to  formal  credit,  women  depend  on  private  moneylenders  and\nborrow  funds  at  exorbitant  interest  rates.  As  noted,  the  resources  of  the  small arisan  savings\ngroup are not sufficient to meet all of its members needs; however, the social capital that has\nbeen developed in forming these groups can be tapped in forming CBSLOs.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n16.\nIn the mid-1990s, the Government committed itself to eradicating poverty. At the start of\nthe  sixth  Five-Year  Development  Plan  (REPELITA  VI),  FY1994/95-1998/99,  the  Government\nlaunched  a  special  program,  the  Inpres Desa Tertinggal  (Presidential  Instructions  for  Less\nDeveloped  Villages  [IDT]),16  which  supported  infrastructure  development  and  economic\nactivities  in  targeted  IDT  villages.  The  program  benefited  about  28,000  villages  with  an\nestimated  13  million  people  or  about  half  of  the  population  identified  to  be  living  below  the\npoverty  line.  The  IDT  program  consisted  of  direct  grant,  village  infrastructure  and  technical\nguidance.  MOHA  supported  by  BAPPENAS  (National  Development  Planning  Agency)\nadministered  the  direct  grant  scheme  and  the  infrastructure  support  program.  Grants  of  Rp20\nmillion ($8,500 equivalent at that time) were given to each IDT village per year, depending on\nthe  village  populations,  for  three  years  to  help  create  and  expand  economic  opportunities  for\n\n                                                \n16 Through Presidential Instruction No. 5/1993.\n\n\f6\n\npoor community members. The village infrastructure program sought to increase market access\nand  break  the  isolation  of  IDT  villages,  improve  health  standards,  promote  employment\nopportunities, build the capacity of village institutions, and improve the capability of villagers to\nplan, implement, and maintain village infrastructure. The IDT program had some difficulties due\nto insufficient institutional support and shortage of sustainable financial services, but its impact\nhas been recognized.\n\n17.\nLaws  22  and  25  which  were  passed  in  1999,  hold  the  promise  of  a  decentralized\nadministrative system that will strengthen institutional links between civil society as represented\nby  elected  village  bodies  and  the  subdistrict  and  district  governments.17  They  are  necessary\nmeasures  to  address  regional  economic  disparities  and  to  transfer  resources  for  development\nprograms. When fully implemented, the laws will convert Indonesia\u2019s districts into autonomous\nareas  with  fully  elected  government  authority  to  address  the  interests  of  their  rural\nconstituencies.  Village  communities  themselves  would  be  given  new  powers  as  indigenous\nautonomous  areas  to  elect  through  democratic  processes  representatives  for  village  councils,\nreplacing the previously  government-appointed village heads and committees. These changes\nare  expected  to  spawn  local  government-sponsored  development  initiatives  more  attuned  to\nlocal  community  needs.  Viewed  in  the  context  of  social  exclusion,  the  two  laws  constitute  a\ncritically important initiative. They give communities, including the poor within the communities,\nthe power to hold local leaders accountable.\n\n18.\nThe Government\u2019s development priorities are contained in its medium-term development\nprogram  (PROPENAS),  which  describes  the  Government  agenda  for  2001-2005.  PROPENAS\ncontains five broad development objectives aimed at (i) ensuring national cohesion and social\nstability, (ii) achieving good governance and rule of law, (iii) accelerating economic recovery and\nstrengthening  the  foundations  for  sustained  growth,  (iv)  developing  the  social  sectors  and\nhuman  welfare,  and  (v)  strengthening  regional  autonomy,  rural  and  urban  development  and\nstructural  poverty  programs.  PROPENAS  also  addresses  a  range  of  cross-cutting  issues\ncovering  poverty,  gender,  and  environmental  sustainability.  Economic  recovery,  good\ngovernance,  infrastructure  rehabilitation  to  support  production,  regional  autonomy  through\ndecentralization, poverty reduction, and women in development, which are key components of\nthe  Government\u2019s  medium-term  strategy  and  which  address  cross-cutting  issues,  are  also\nmajor concerns of the Project.\n\n19.\nIn preparing to implement the two laws on decentralization in 2001, the Government is\nreorganizing and restructuring the entire administrative system. The mandates of key ministries\nformerly  responsible  for  regional  government  administration,  including  MOHA,  have  been\nchanged to accord with the provisions of the laws. MOHA\u2019s new mandate is to facilitate the role\nof  regional  governments  as  they  assume  their  new  responsibilities  and  is  confined  to  policy\nmatters stemming from the new relationship between the regional and the Central governments.\nIn effect, MOHA will have a much-reduced role in regional government affairs.\n\n20.\nThe MOHA reorganization has involved specific changes in the function and staff of the\nDirectorate General of Rural Community Development (DGRCD).  First, DGRCD was renamed\nDirectorate-General  of  Rural  Community  Empowerment  (DGRCE).  The  new  name  reflects\nDGRCE\u2019s new mission to support and facilitate (rather than lead, as was previously the case)\ncommunity development planning and coordinate with local government and sectoral agencies\nin  implementing  programs.    Second,  as  of  January  2001,  DGRCE  staff  serving  at  provincial,\ndistrict,  and  subdistrict  levels  will  become  the  staff  of  the  respective  levels  of  regional\n\n                                                \n17 Law No. 22/1999 on Regional Government and Law No. 25/1999 on Fiscal Balance.\n\n\f7\n\ngovernment.  The  devolved  staff,  particularly  those  currently  serving  at  the  districts  and\nsubdistricts  are  expected  to  retain  their  functions  as  the  interface  between  the  district  and\nsubdistrict government administration and the village community.\n\nThe Government has assigned to MOHA the task of reorienting and retraining DGRCE\n21.\nstaff  and  the  devolved  staff  for  their  new  responsibilities  as  the  sponsors  of  community\ndevelopment  interests  in  the  central  and  regional  government  administration,  respectively.  In\nturn,  Central  Government  will  assist  the  regional  governments  as  they  assume  their  new\nresponsibilities and absorb the new staff, particularly at the districts and subdistricts where they\nare currently the weakest. These are the levels where, at present, the existing DGRCE staffing\nlevels are only 43 percent of the 81 positions gazetted per district, and where the educational\nattainment of the staff is generally lower than that in other agencies of the same level. Most of\nthe  field  staff  are  graduates  of  technical  high  schools.  The  new  responsibilities  entrusted  to\nDGRCE  staff  at  these  levels  may  be  beyond  their  skills  level  to  undertake  well.  DGRCE  staff\nhave fewer women than men at both the provincial and central levels: an average of 22 percent\ncovering the three provinces in Kalimantan and 25 percent for the three provinces in Sulawesi,\ncompared with about 34 percent at the central level.\n\n22.\nTo augment its limited staff resources, DGRCE has used NGO community facilitators to\nassist  in  promoting  community  participation,  increasing  income,  and  implementing  rural\ndevelopment projects. Considerable human resource and institutional strengthening efforts are\nrequired  for  the  central-to-regional-government  resource  transfer  to  bear  fruit,  and  should  be\nviewed  as  a  priority  in  forging  the  new  relationship  and  instituting  good  governance  practices.\nThe Government\u2019s request for ADB assistance in addressing this issue in the context of a rural\ndevelopment project reflects well its commitment to effecting the new decentralized system.\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\nThe  major  internationally  funded  projects  directed  at  reducing  poverty  under  the  IDT\n23.\nprogram  through  rural  infrastructure  development  and  microfinance  are  those  supported  by\nADB,  World  Bank,  and  JBIC.  A  summary  of  the  progress  made  is  presented  in  the\nsupplementary appendix.\n\n24.\nThe  first  phase  of  the  Government  of  Japan-financed  Rural  Areas  Infrastructure\nDevelopment Project, which started in 1995, supported infrastructure development in 3,447 IDT\nvillages  in  21  provinces  outside  Java  and  Bali.  The  second  phase  began  in  1997  and  is\nestimated  to  have  provided  infrastructure  to  7,500  IDT  villages  outside  Java  and  Bali.  The\nsecond phase was extended to three years due to the economic crisis. The third phase will be\nimplemented  during  2000-2003  in  about  2,500  villages  in  550  subdistricts.  Most  of  the  funds\nwere  used  for  improving  access  road  infrastructure  in  a  cluster  of  neighboring  villages,  and\nwater  supply  and  sanitation  facilities.  Although  the  village  infrastructure  development  took  the\ndistrict  as  the  unit  of  planning,  the  subproject  proposals  originated  from  the  village  and  were\napproved  at  the  district  level.  Community-based  organizations  were  used  to  construct  village\nsubprojects, assisted by contractors who supplied skilled labor, and equipment, and carried out\nworks beyond the capacity of the local people. The third phase would place more emphasis on\nthe  planning  process  and  implementation  of  subprojects  than  on  the  simple  outcome  of  the\nconstruction  of  the  infrastructure,  through  the  active  participation  of  local  community\norganizations.  The  process  approach  will  focus  on  capacity  building  for  local  community\norganizations  and  community  development.  Underlying  the  reorientation  of  the  approaches  in\nthe third phase is the experience in the first two phases, which demonstrated the key role that\ncommunity involvement in decision making plays in the success of the project. The third phase,\n\n\f8\n\nin  addition  to  constructing  access  infrastructure,  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  will\nfinance agriculture production, postharvest, processing, and marketing support.\n\n25.\nThe World Bank has implemented two village infrastructure projects (VIPs). VIP I begun\nin  1995  and  completed  in  1996,  benefited  1,230  IDT  villages  in  Java.  VIP  II,  which  began  in\n1997, benefited an additional 4,500 IDT villages in Java and Sumatra. The key features of the\nVIP  strategy  include  village  participation,  decentralization,  and  transparency.  Each  village\nreceived a one-time grant of Rp120 million ($54,000 equivalent for VIP I and $50,000 for VIP II\nat the corresponding periods) to build infrastructure of its choice from a menu. About 87 percent\nof  the  village  grant  under  VIP  I  was  used  for  road  and  bridge  works,  and  the  remaining  13\npercent  for  drinking  water  and  sanitation.  Except  for  Rp20  million  advanced  for  materials,  the\ngrant was disbursed based on work progress. Villagers were empowered to decide priority uses\nof  the  grant  and  implemented  the  subproject  themselves  with  limited  reliance  on  contractors.\nThe  services  of  domestic  engineers  were  provided  for  planning,  designing,  and  implementing\nthe subprojects. The implementation of the first project was assessed to be highly satisfactory.\nThe second project is still being evaluated.\n\n26.\nThe  World  Bank\u2019s  Kecamatan  Development  Project  (KDP),  approved  in  1998,  adapts\nthe VIP principles but differs from it in three ways: (i) the KDP provides a block grant to each\nselected subdistrict, which will select from among competing investment proposals submitted by\nvillages; (ii) the KDP funds economic activities, in addition to infrastructure, which are financed\nthrough credit at market rates at a maximum of Rp150 million ($18,000 equivalent) per group,\nand (iii) the KDP provides NGO facilitators in addition to engineering assistance.\n\nIn  1999,  ADB  approved  the  Community  and  Local  Government  Support  Sector\n27.\nDevelopment Program, involving a policy loan of $200 million and an investment project loan of\n$120 million. The investment project loan provides village grants to poorer districts for improving\nbasic  services  through  labor-intensive  infrastructure  development  and  improvement.  The\namount of the block grant ranges from Rp8 million ($1,000 equivalent) to RP 80 million ($10,000\nequivalent)  depending  on  the  population  of  the  village.  The  implementation  of  the  program  is\nprogressing satisfactorily. The first 37 districts in Java have been identified and a second batch\nof 15 districts in Sumatra is under consideration.\n\nADB  has  two  ongoing  microfinance  projects  in  Indonesia.  The  Microcredit  Project18\n28.\n(MCP) targets the poor and near poor for microenterprise development by providing credit and\nmobilizing savings in five provinces.19 MCP targets primarily non-IDT villages. Credit is provided\nthrough five BPDs, including BPD South Kalimantan, which onlend to small financial institutions\nand group organizations. NGO facilitators provided training. Most subborrowers are individuals,\nbut self-help group subborrowers are also included. The poor are targeted by the loan size (less\nthan  Rp500,000)  and  through  NGOs.  The  Rural  Income  Generation  Project  (RIGP)20  differs\nfrom the MCP in emphasizing the provision of microfinance services to poor people living below\nthe  poverty  line,  and  in  giving  priority  to  IDT  villages  through  credit  provided  by  Bank  Rakyat\nIndonesia.  Under  the  RIGP,  rural  savings  are  also  mobilized,  and  training  is  provided  by  the\nAgency  for  Agricultural  Education  and  Training.  Field  extension  workers  and  NGO  facilitators\nassist  in  forming  self-help  groups  and  preparing  business  proposals.  The  MCP  has\ndemonstrated  significant  benefits  to  the  final  borrowers  and  in  developing  skills  in  the  small\nfinancial  intermediaries.  The  RIGP  has  demonstrated  that  a  large  number  of  self-help  groups\n\n                                                \n18  Loan 1327-INO, for $25.7 million, approved on 25 October 1994.\n19  MCP\u2019s five provinces are West Java, Central Java, East Java, South Kalimantan, and West Nusa Tenggara.\n20  Loan 1583-INO, for $78.6 million, approved on 25 November 1997.\n\n\f9\n\ncan  be  rapidly  mobilized  and  that  facilitators  can  play  an  effective  role  in  the  process.\nImplementation of the two projects is considered satisfactory.\n\nfacilitators.  Labor \n\n29.\nThe block grant approach in Indonesia is well-tested in externally funded programs. The\nWorld Bank and JBIC have successfully implemented it in a number of recent projects. Under a\nseries of VIPs, communities or villages identified the needed roads, water supply facilities, etc.,\nto be built, which they constructed themselves, assisted by project field engineers and later by\nNGO \nthe  participating  villages  was  utilized,  which  generated\nemployment.  Regarding  credit  lines  to  BPDs,  ADB  has  more  than  five  years  of  successful\nexperience  involving  BPDs  in  providing  credit.  In  the  ADB  MCP,  five  BPDs,  including  BPD\nSouth  Kalimantan,  successfully  provided  village  subborrowers  with  credit  for  microenterprise\ndevelopment  in  five  provinces,  among  others,  through  small  nonbank  financial  institutions.\nThese institutions are similar to the CBSLOs that will be formed under the Project. Since such\nnonbank financial institutions do not exist in the project area, the challenge to the Project is to\nestablish viable savings and loan organizations.\n\nfrom \n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n30.\nFormulating  the  Project  has  benefited  from  the  experience  and  lessons  learned  from\nmany completed or ongoing projects assisted by the ADB,21 JBIC, and World Bank. A summary\nof valuable lessons learned follows:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nMore  active  participation  of  traditional  rural  communities  in  the  mainstream\nformal  economy  should  begin  with  empowerment  of  the  communities  through\nsocial  mobilization,  organization,  and  improved  access  to  adjoining  growth\ncenters where there is a market for the goods and services that the villages can\nproduce.\n\nEmphasis  on  developing  human  resources  at  the  local  level  is  the  key  to\ncommunity empowerment.\n\nThe villages that receive block grants should have considerable control over the\ndetails  of  how  their  grants  are  spent.  The  block  grant  system  is  demonstrably\nsuccessful  in  spurring  communities  to  prioritize  their  needs  and  to  allocate\navailable  resources  to  these  activities  reflecting  their  priorities  and  potential\n(KDP, footnote 21).\n\nIncreased participation of ordinary people, including poor people, in the decision-\nmaking  process  and  the  corresponding  pressure  from  them  for  transparency\nhave  greatly  assisted  in  combating  the  dangers  from  malfeasance  and\ncorruption.  Election  of  local  officials  allows  communities  to  hold  the  officials\naccountable.\n\n(v) \n\nIf  the  villages  have  to  compete  for  infrastructure  funds,  the  rules  of  competition\nshould favor small-scale labor-intensive projects that will provide facilities for use\nby  the  local  communities.  Substantial  savings  are  made  using  village-based\n\n                                                \n21  ADB  loans:  Loan  1605-INO: Central Sulawesi Integrated Area Development and Conservation Project,  for  $32.0\nmillion,  approved  on  27  January  1998;  Loan  1678-INO:  Community and Local Government Support Sector\nDevelopment Program, for $120 million, approved on 25 March 1999.

BPDs  have  successfully  onlent  credit \nmicrofinance subborrowers in two ongoing ADB projects.\n\n(ix) \n\nThere  is  extensive  reliance  on  NGO  community  facilitators  in  all  projects.  The\nfacilitators  can  play  a  useful  role  in  guiding  and  empowering  communities\nthrough  the  transition,  and  in  training  community-based  organizations  in\nmicroenterprise  management,  saving  and \nlending  practices,  participatory\nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  marketing,  and  applied  technology.  Further,  NGO\nparticipation  improves  transparency  and  can  give  a  voice  to  poor  marginalized\ngroups who might otherwise be excluded.\n\n(x) \n\nThe  management  of  the  project  should  not  be  top-heavy;  instead  it  should  be\nwidely dispersed to encourage ownership and to be responsive to the needs of\nthe project beneficiaries.\n\nE. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n31.\nADB has had an interim operational strategy for operations in Indonesia since the start\nof  the  crisis  in  1997.  However,  a  new  country  operational  strategy  being  prepared  will  reflect\nADB\u2019s overarching objective of poverty reduction and the Government\u2019s strategic priorities. The\ncountry assistance plan (CAP) for Indonesia for 2000 identified several key areas for support in\nthe  rural  sector.  Among  the  key  investment  activities  emphasized,  the  Project  supports  the\ndevelopment  of  a  diversified  rural  economic  base,  creation  and  strengthening  of  rural-urban\nlinkages,  improvement  of  institutional  capacity,  and  enhancement  of  the  quality  of  human\nresources  for  community  development.  Apart  from  directly  creating  employment  and  reducing\nrural  poverty,  the  Project  is  designed  to  play  a  pivotal  role  in  empowering  and  preparing\nprimarily  poor  rural  communities  to  benefit  from  the  ensuing  decentralization  of  government\nadministrative and financial functions.\n\n32.\nIn  line  with  the  country  strategy,  the  Project  will  promote  (i)  increased  beneficiary\nparticipation,  (ii)  enhanced  capacity  of  local  governments  and  strengthened  community-based\nservice delivery systems, and (iii) reduced gender disparity. The Project is fully consistent with\nADB\u2019s country and sector strategy and will contribute to achieving ADB\u2019s and the Government\u2019s\nobjective of reducing core poverty.\n\n                                                \n22 Loan 3888-IND: Village Infrastructure Project, for $72.5 million, approved on 29 June 1995.\n\n\f11\n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nPolicy  dialogue  focused  on  the  decentralization  process  and  flow  of  funds;  devolution\n\n33.\nand training needs; and the role of NGOs and increased participation of women.\n\n1. \n\nDecentralization Process and Flow of Funds\n\nLengthy  discussions  were  held  with  the  Government  on  the  implications  of  the\n34.\ndecentralization  process  for  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  Project,  particularly,  the\nproblems  decentralization  might  pose  concerning  the  flow  of  funds  and  the  arrangements  for\ncounterpart  funding.  The  Government  and  the  Mission  agreed  that  loan  funds  and  the\nnecessary  counterpart  funds  will  be  made  available  to  the  Project  through  annual  budgets\nearmarked for financing project activities throughout the implementation period.\n\n2.\n\nDevolution of Staff to Local Government and Training Needs\n\n35.\nThe  planned  devolution  of  staff  from  national  to  provincial  and  district  authorities,\nalthough  formally  agreed  upon  in  some  cases,  still  needs  to  be  realized  in  terms  of  regional\ngovernment  decision  making.  Discussions  with  local  government  officials  highlighted  the  need\nfor  increasing  the  number  of  staff  and  meeting  their  training  needs,  particularly  at  the  district\nlevel. At present, the existing staff at the district levels in the project area are only 43 percent of\nthe 81 positions gazetted per district, and the educational attainment of staff is generally lower\nthan  that  in  other  agencies  of  the  same  level.  To  address  the  considerable  training  needs  of\ndevolved staff, and existing and future employees, the formal degree-training program under the\nProject was expanded.\n\n3.\n\nRole of  NGOs and Increased Participation of Women\n\n36.\nIn the interim, while capacity building and training of DGRCE staff are taking place, the\nGovernment  will  engage  the  services  of  local  NGO  facilitators  in  the  six  provinces  to  assist  in\npromoting the participation of a broad spectrum of village participants in the Project, particularly\nthe  poor,  women,  and  indigenous  people.  The  facilitators  will  also  assist  in  training  the\ncommunity-based  organizations  in  microenterprise  development  and  marketing  of  products;\nsavings  and  lending  activities;  participatory  monitoring  and  evaluation;  and  construction  and\nmaintenance of rural infrastructure. The Project will contribute to strengthening the capacity of\nlocal NGOs through training by consultants to be employed under the Project, and will increase\nthe  availability  of  community-based  facilitators  with  expertise  in  microenterprises,  community-\nbased  organizations,  and  development  of  physical  infrastructure.  Furthermore,  to  address  the\nGovernment policy of increasing the participation of women beneficiaries and women staff in the\nProject,  the  Government  and  the  Mission  agreed  to  target  increased  participation  of  women\nbeneficiaries  in  community  training  and  microenterprise  development,  and  in  the  proportion  of\nwomen  staff  receiving  training  for  diploma,  tertiary  and  graduate  degrees  and  appointment  to\nhigh positions in the district government.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n37.\nThe Project is designed to address the significant shortcomings that have led to social\nexclusion  of  the  rural  poor  and  a  continuation  of  their  capability  deprivation.  First,  as  local\ncommunities  become  involved  in  the  development  planning  and  implementation  process,  a\n\n\f12\n\nmajor  challenge  concerns  the  lack  of  institutional  capacity  to  effect  planning  and  allocation  of\nresources for community development. The major constraints include the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nWeak human resources at the community, subdistrict, and district levels of government\nwhere  the  link  between  civil  society  and  government  needs  to  be  strong  to  utilize\nresources  intended  for  rural  areas.  For  lack  of  resources  and  skills,  many  village\ncommunity  leaders  in  the  project  areas  are  unable  to  effectively  plan  or  communicate\ntheir  community  development  needs.  Their  primary  spokespersons  in  the  government\nhierarchy, the DGRCE staff in the subdistrict, are spread too thin or lack the necessary\nresources, skills, and incentives to serve their constituent villages adequately.\n\nDomination  by  sectoral  agencies.  In  the  subdistrict,  major  development  priorities  are\nusually  set  by  sectoral  agencies,  often  with  little  or  no  consultation  with  local\ncommunities.\n\nInsufficient  resource  allocation.  At  present,  the  allocation  (about  $1,250  per  year)\nreceived by villages for planning development activities is inadequate for preparing more\nthan lists of items proposed by villagers for local rural infrastructure. Village participation\nin effect would be no more than a few meetings conducted for that purpose. Under Law\n25,  the  amount  will  likely  increase  with  the  increased  budget  allocations  to  elected\ndistrict  governments.  However,  the  villagers  will  need  new  mechanisms  to  ensure  that\nthe  planning  process  goes  beyond  mere  listing  of  their  wishes,  and  measures  to\nenhance  the  transparency  of  their  decision  making  and  accountability  for  using\nresources.\n\n38.\nGiven these constraints, skilled human resources, and new institutions and mechanisms\nsupportive  of  community  development  and  anchored  in  grassroots  democracy  and  social\ninclusion of the poor, will need to rapidly evolve to realize the good intentions of the new laws. A\nfocused  effort  and  allocation  of  resources  will  be  needed  to  encourage  local  government  and\nvillage  communities  to  assume  their  new  responsibilities.  Toward  this  end,  the  Project  will\nsupport formal and informal training of local government staff and villagers, and a development\nplanning  process  aimed  at  improved  identification  of  and  resource  allocation  for  local\ndevelopment needs. The process will be based on participatory approaches whereby villagers\nthemselves will have the opportunity to identify local problems and propose solutions, organize\nthemselves to implement those solutions, and monitor the results. The Project will thus lay the\ngroundwork  for  local  government  and  communities  to  institute  socially  inclusive  mechanisms\nthrough  which  they  can  have  a  voice  and  choice  in  decision  making  concerning  how  public\nresources will be used for their benefit. Past initiatives with similar objectives have failed for lack\nof such local institutional capacity and mechanisms.\n\nThe second set of challenges revolves around significant but not intractable constraints\n39.\nto rural economic growth opportunities for the poor in Kalimantan and Sulawesi, caused by the\nexclusion  of  rural  communities  from  regional  growth  centers  (i.e.,  markets),  from  financial\nservices, and from information necessary to actually access those markets. For lack of capital,\nmany poor villagers who wish to engage in off-farm income-generation activities are unable to\ndo  so.  The  feasibility  study  identified  48  types  of  microenterprises  that  villagers  would  like  to\ninvest in if they had access to affordable credit. Through the development planning process to\nbe  supported  under  the  Project,  communities  will  be  encouraged  to  invest  in  microenterprises\nand  provided  access  to  formal  financial  services  after  raising  capital  from  their  savings.  Many\nareas  and  village  communities  lack  access  roads  and  other  rural  infrastructure  (e.g.,  bridges,\njetties,  and  markets)  to  establish  commercial  linkages  to  regional  centers  and  benefit  from\nspillover effects of their growth. The Project will support construction of rural infrastructure that\n\n\f13\n\nwill  improve  the  commercial  links  between  the  target  villages  and  the  growth  centers  in  the\nproject area.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n1. \n\nObjectives\n\n40.\n  By  addressing  a  range  of  social  exclusion  issues  that  lead  to  capability  deprivation\namong  the  poor,  the  Project  aims  to  increase  the  real  incomes  of  the  poor,  particularly  the\npoorer  rural  communities  in  the  peripheral  areas  of  regional  growth  centers.  The  objectives  of\nthe  Project  are  to  (i)  empower  rural  communities  by  strengthening  their  capacity  to  plan  and\nmanage  their  own  development  activities  in  a  socially  inclusive  manner,  and  (ii)  support\ninvestments  and  foster  rural  urban  linkages  by  establishing  rural  infrastructure  to  promote\nagricultural productivity and off-farm business enterprises.\n\n2. \n\nScope\n\n41.\n\n The Project will comprise four components:\n\na.\n\nCapacity Building for Decentralized Development Planning (Part A)\n\n42.\nPart A seeks to empower communities and strengthen the capacity of village and local\nofficials under a decentralized framework. It will support capacity building for communities and\ncommunity  institutions,  local  government  workers  (district,  subdistrict,  and  village  levels),  and\nnational and provincial officials to develop new skills, that they will need to function effectively\nunder  the  new  administrative  and  financial  setup  for  the  decentralized  government  system.\nEmpowerment will be achieved through the following subcomponents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nInstitutional  development.  This  subcomponent  will  (a)  introduce  a  planning\nprocess  and  related  training  and  other  institutional  capacity-building  activities  to\nencourage and help communities to develop and test community-based planning\nmechanisms and to formulate and propose village development plans for funding\nby  project  implementation  units  (PIUs);  (b)  establish  intervillage  community\ndevelopment  working  groups  (Kelompok Kerja Pembangunan Masyarakat) to\nfacilitate and advocate development proposals promoting linkage of neighboring\nvillages  that  require  PIU  funding  support;  and  (c)  skills  training  for  local\ngovernment  staff  to  enhance  their  capability  to  facilitate,  monitor,  and  support\nlocal community development initiatives.\n\nHuman  resources  development.  This  subcomponent  will  support  formal  degree\ntraining for 1,773 staff of DGRCE and local government dealing with community\ndevelopment, including those at district and subdistrict levels, to form a nucleus\nof  skilled  staff  dealing  with  decentralized  development  planning.  The  proportion\nof  women  trained  will  be  at  least  30  percent  of  the  total  for  the  diploma,  25\npercent  for  the  bachelor\u2019s  degree  program,  and  20  percent  for  the  master\u2019s\ndegree program. The domestic master\u2019s degree program includes specialization\nin  rural  development  planning,  rural  community  development,  and  public\nadministration,  while  the  international  master\u2019s  degree  program  includes  social\nplanning and development, and development management. DGRCE will ensure\nthat  staff  who  have  participated  in  the  formal  domestic  and  foreign  degree\ntraining  programs  will  be  assigned  to  a  Project  position  relevant  to  the  training,\nfor  at  least  twice  the  length  of  the  period  of  the  training  received.  About  90\n\n\f14\n\nofficials  will  conduct  a  short-term  comparative  study  of  decentralization,\ncommunity  and  village  planning,  CBSLO \nformation,  and  microenterprise\ndevelopment in other countries of the region (Appendix 2).\n\n(iii) \n\nProvision  of  village  grants  to  support  the  community  training  program.  This\nsubcomponent  will  provide  a  one-time  village  grant  to  each  community  after\nsuccessfully developing a village plan, at the end of the capacity building training\nprogram  (para.  42  [i]).  The  grant  will  finance  a  specific  rural  infrastructure\nproposal  identified  in  the  village  plans  and  approved  by  the  elected  village\ncouncil.23  The  grant  (about  Rp65  million  or  $7,800  per  village)  will  include  a\nportion  (about  7.5  percent)  to  cover  administration  costs  related  to  the  village\ndevelopment  planning  process.  Construction  will  be  fully  undertaken  with\nvillagers labor, while the materials will be purchased by the PIUs.\n\nb. \n\nDevelopment of Rural Financial Institutions (Part B)\n\nPart B will support the formation of savings and loan organizations, support investments,\n43.\nand promote economic growth in poor rural communities. This will be done through the following\nsubcomponents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii)\n\nDevelopment  of  community-based  savings  and  loan  organizations.  The  Project\nwill encourage interested members of the community during the CBSLO training\nprogram to form CBSLOs to mobilize savings, provide financial services among\nmembers,  and  manage  small  loans  under  the  Project  for  the  enterprise\ninvestments.  The  formation  process  will  involve  extensive  discussions  and\nanalysis of the need for financial services and intensive training for members and\nofficers on their responsibilities. Officers will be elected from among the members\nand trained to prepare simple annual profit and loss statements. CBSLOs will be\nrequired  to  register  as  legal  entities.  If  participants  are  interested,  CBSLOs  can\nbe formed in about 750 participating villages. Many key participants will assist in\nforming  the  750  CBSLOs  separately.  A  total  of  36  subdistricts,  representing  11\ndistricts,  will  be  involved.  Each  subdistrict  will  be  allowed  to  form  only  six\nCBSLOs a  year. For  some, that will mean forming 18 CBSLOs for a three-year\nperiod, and for others, forming 24 CBSLOs for a four-year period.\n\nProviding financial services. Following the formation of CBSLOs, savings will be\nmobilized  and  lending  among  members  will  be  encouraged  to  raise  the  capital\nbase of CBSLOs to support economic activities in the community. Each CBSLO\nwill  serve  as  the  new  focal  point  for  providing  needed  financial  services  to\nmembers  of  the  village,  which  is  lacking  at  present.  About  $15.0  million24  from\nthe  ordinary  capital  resources  loan  proceeds  will  be  relent  by  the  Ministry  of\nFinance  (MOF)  to  six  BPDs,  which  will  serve  as  executing  banks  for  the  credit.\nCapacity  building  for  BPDs  will  be  provided  to  strengthen  their  capability  to\nprovide microfinance services to approximately 750 target villages. BPD staff will\nassist  the  team  of  NGO  facilitators  in  training  of  CBSLO  officers  and  members\npreparatory to actual borrowing. A BPD will onlend to a CBSLO which will then\n\n                                                \n23  As provided by Law 22.\n24 The feasibility study consultants have calculated the demand for credit based on the estimated number of CBSLOs\nto  be  formed  under  the  Project.  If  each  of  the  750  CBSLOs  would  have  at  least  100  members,  there  would  be\n75,000  potential  borrowers.  On  a  conservative  estimate,  if  each  member  borrows  a  minimum  of  $200  once\n(equivalent  to  the  loan  size  targeted  for  the  poor  borrowers),  a  $15  million  credit  line  (75,000  x  $200  =\n$15,000,000) will be required.\n\n\f15\n\nonlend  to  its  members  at  market  rates.  Each  BPD  will  onlend  the  proceeds  of\neach  withdrawal  to  eligible  CBSLOs  within  three  months  of  such  withdrawal.  In\nthe  event  of  full  repayment  by  CBSLOs,  the  BPD  will  onlend  the  proceeds  of\nsuch repayment to other eligible CBSLOs, and will continue to do so for at least\ntwo years after project completion.\n\nc. \n\nImprovement of Rural Infrastructure (Part C)\n\nPart  C  will  provide  needed  rural  infrastructure  in  the  project  area  to  link  poor\n44.\ncommunities  to  markets  in  the  urban  centers.  The  rural  infrastructure  will  increase  access  to\nmarkets  and  services  and  reduce  the  disproportionately  high  transaction  costs  faced  by  poor\nfarmers  and  small  entrepreneurs.  It  will  support  and  invigorate  agricultural  production  and\nmicroenterprises in the less developed rural areas. The infrastructure facilities will be selected\nusing a participatory approach that considers the needs of the villages or the common good for\nvillage  clusters.  Civil  works  to  be  constructed  or  rehabilitated  will  range  from  simple\ninfrastructure that can be carried out by the community to more complex infrastructure requiring\nheavy  equipment  and  the  services  of  licensed  construction  contractors.  The  latter  type  of\ninfrastructure will require the services of district government public works officials and the PIUs\nfor  investigations,  survey,  design,  and  technical  specifications.  In  all  cases,  labor  from  the\nparticipating  villages  will  be  utilized  to  generate  employment  and  strengthen  the  skills  of\nbeneficiaries  in  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  completed  infrastructure.  Under  a\nmemorandum  of  agreement  between  each  village  and  the  PIU,  routine  maintenance  of  all\ncompleted infrastructure will be done by villagers. Examples of infrastructure are access and on-\nfarm  roads,  bridges  and  jetties,  fish  auction  and  village  markets,  rural  water  supply,  and\ndrainage to control flooding (Appendix 3).\n\nd.\n\nProject Management and Monitoring (Part D)\n\nPart  D  will  provide  administrative  support,  technical  guidance,  and  monitoring  and\n45.\nsupervision related to project implementation, including establishment of a project performance\nmonitoring  system  (PPMS)  and  use  of  consultants  and  NGO  facilitators  and  NGO  district\nmonitors for selected project activities. The PPMS will (i) monitor and evaluate project activities,\nincluding  assessment  of  poverty  reduction  and  social,  environmental,  financial,  and  economic\nimpacts; (ii) develop a computerized management information system (MIS) to assist in day-to-\nday  management  of  project  activities;  and  (iii)  conduct  regular  monitoring  and  evaluation\nreviews.  Three  management  teams  will  be  formed  at  the  project  management  office  (PMO):\n(i) one  team  will  provide  guidance  on  overall  management,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and\ntraining activity in an advisory capacity to project management and will establish the PPMS and\nMIS;  (ii)  a  second  team  will  provide  guidance  and  support  for  implementing  capacity  building\nunder  part  A;  and  (iii)  a  third  team  will  provide  guidance  and  support  in  forming  CBSLOs  and\ndeveloping micro enterprises development under part B and supervising construction under part\nC.  District  NGO  monitors  will  also  be  engaged  for  oversight  activities  under  part  D,  e.g.,\nreviewing procurement and assessing quality and standard of construction.\n\n3. \n\nProject Area\n\na.\n\nProvinces, Districts, Subdistricts, and Villages\n\n \n46.\nThe  four  project  components  will  be  fully  implemented  in  11  districts  in  six  core\nprovinces  in  eastern  Indonesia:  Central  Kalimantan,  East  Kalimantan,  and  South  Kalimantan,\nand Central Sulawesi, North Sulawesi, and Southeast Sulawesi (map, page vi). However, part A\n\n\f16\n\ncomprising capacity building for decentralized development planning, will first be pilot-tested in\nthe  six  provinces.  During  this  period,  the  community-based  planning  mechanism  and  the\ntraining program will be developed and tested. Following a midterm evaluation three years after\nthe  start  of  implementation,  the  geographic  coverage  of  part  A  may  be  extended  to  the\nremaining  20  provinces  that  show  commitment,  on  a  voluntary  basis.  These  provinces,  which\nhave been designated as expansion provinces, would benefit from the experience and lessons\nlearned in conducting village training in the six core provinces.\n\nAt project formulation which began in 1998, the assistance of the World Bank and JBIC\n47.\nwas concentrated on the islands of Java, Bali, and Sumatra, and was aimed at reducing poverty\nby constructing or rehabilitating rural infrastructure in the rural areas, such as roads, and water\nsupply and sanitation facilities. To avoid duplication of efforts and overlaps, the Government and\nADB  agreed  that  the  proposed  Project  would  focus  its  assistance  on  the  outer  islands  of\nSulawesi  and  Kalimantan.  In  this  manner,  the  Project  would  also  support  the  Government\u2019s\npolicy  of  promoting  balanced  regional  development  by  focusing  assistance  on  the  less\ndeveloped  eastern  region  and  reducing  poverty.  Because  by  1998  the  World  Bank  and  JBIC\ncoverage had extended even to Sulawesi and Kalimantan, it was agreed that only subdistricts\nthat were not covered by the other aid agencies would be selected for the Project.\n\n48.\nThe  rural  infrastructure  component  of  the  Project  follows  the  strategy  of  linking  poor\nvillages  to  growth  centers  and  growth  corridors  to  access  markets  in  these  areas.  Growth\ncenters  are  towns  and  cities  where  above-average  growth  has  taken  place  in  recent  years.\nGrowth corridors comprise long sections of main roads linking subdistricts to growth centers and\nalong  which  some  villages  develop  economic  activities.  Examples  of  growth  corridors  are  the\nmain  road  connecting  Banjarmasin  to  Kapuas  and  Barito,  and  the  main  road  connecting  Palu\nand  Poso.  Using  rapid  rural  appraisal  and  SUSENAS25  data,  72  subdistricts  were  selected  on\nthe following criteria: (i) contain at least 1,500 households, (ii) contain IDT villages to reach the\nlargest  number  of  poor  people,  (iii)  possess  potential  linkage  to  regional  growth  centers  and\ngrowth  corridors,  (iv)  have  moderate  year-round  accessibility,  and  (v)  avoid  overlap  by  not\nparticipating in the World Bank and JBIC rural infrastructure projects.\n\n49.\nThe following criteria will be used to target poor villages. To be eligible, a village will (i)\ninvolving  microfinance  or  rural\nforeign-assisted  projects \nnot  be  covered  by  ongoing \ninfrastructure during the project implementation period; (ii) be in a cluster of about 3-10 villages\nand within a reasonable distance from a growth center; (iii) have an existing commercial link to\ngrowth  centers,  including  at  least  10  percent  of  households  with  commercial  activities  selling\ngoods  or  services  at  such  growth  centers;  and  (iv)  be  in  the  bottom  third  of  the  participating\nsubdistrict in terms of proportion of poor. To select the villages, workshops will be conducted at\nthe  subdistrict  level  involving  PIU  staff,  NGOs,  village  chiefs,  and  community  representatives\nfrom village dusun (village subunits or settlements). Details of the overall strategy for targeting\nthe poor are described in paras. 88 and 89.\n\nb. \n\nCommunity Empowerment\n\nCapacity  building  for  the  villages  under  part  A  is  aimed  at  community  empowerment,\n50.\nwhich  is  a  long-term  process.  Under  this  Project,  several  strategies  will  be  used  to  empower\nformation,  social  mobilization,  human\nvillage  communities,  especially \ndevelopment \nthe  participatory  approach.\nCommunities  are  not  homogeneous  and  to  ensure  the  participation  of  women  and  men  in  the\nvillage development planning process, groups will be formed in each dusun comprising people\n\nthe  poor:  group \ntraining,  and  village-level  planning \n\nthrough \n\n                                                \n25 National socioeconomic survey.\n\n\f17\n\nfrom  similar  socioeconomic  background  and  by  gender.  The  process  of  community\nempowerment  starts  with  social  mobilization,  followed  by  human  development  training  and\nvillage planning. Each village will make its own development plan based on its perceived needs.\nEach  group  will  conduct  a  situation  analysis  and  participatory  appraisal.  The  outputs  will  be\ncombined to develop a village plan and village map. The village plan will contain, among others,\nthe  schedule  for  constructing  or  rehabilitating  village  infrastructure  prioritized  over  a  period  of\ntime. A detailed social assessment of the Project is provided in the supplementary appendix.\n\nc.\n\nTargeting Poor People\n\n51.\nThe  Project  will  target  poor  households  with  annual  income  of  less  than  Rp670,000\n($100).  The  rapid  rural  appraisal  conducted  during  the  feasibility  study  have  identified  poor\nhouseholds that can afford only two meals a day; whose members are landless, sharecroppers,\nfisherfolks without boats; are headed by women; and are involved in subsistence farming, and\nsmall  trading  and  selling  of  home-cooked  food  and  beverages.  A  survey  of  potential\nbeneficiaries in the six provinces indicated that at least two thirds of the population are very poor\nand  poor.  On  the  two  islands,  the  typical  family  depends  on  subsistence  agriculture.  In\nKalimantan,  the  typical  family  has  a  bicycle  to  take  produce  to  the  market  and  to  serve  the\ntransport needs of the members. The house is made of wood with a wooden floor but is poorly\nmaintained. Many houses have a pressed earthen floor. Many families use firewood for cooking\nand have access to a sealed well and pump for potable water, although the majority in the same\nvillage have only open wells. In Sulawesi, the typical family also relies on subsistence farming,\nbut  earns  supplementary  income  from  handicrafts  made  at  home.  The  house  is  traditionally\nraised above the ground and is made of timber. The house has wooden-slat windows. Firewood\nis also used extensively for cooking, and a kerosene stove is for special occasions. There are\npumps in the village, but the family uses an open well for drinking water.\n\nThe  following  strategy  will  be  used  in  targeting  poor  households:26  (i)  villages  with  a\n52.\nmajority of poor people will be targeted; (ii); village development plans will explicitly identify the\nneeds  and  concerns  of  poor  people;  (iii)  village  planning  committees  will  include  at  least  two\nrepresentatives of the poor; (iv) to allow participation of poor people with low literacy, two thirds\nof the trainees in the community training program to be designed will be from poor households;\n(v)  two  thirds  of  the  total  borrowers  from  the  CBSLOs  will  be  from  poor  households;  (vi)  no\nminimum  savings  levels  will  be  established  in  opening  a  CBSLO  savings  account  to  avoid\nexcluding  the  poor;  (vii)  CBSLO  lending  terms  and  repayment  period  will  be  set  at  sufficiently\nlow  levels  to  allow  poor  borrowers  to  gain  experience  in  using  credit  (the  CBSLO  will  set  the\nlevel and repayment period as an explicit part of the membership guidelines to encourage the\nparticipation of the poor); (viii) proposals for rural infrastructure projects under part C will include\nan explanation of the benefit for the poor; and (ix) poverty impact indicators are included in the\nbaseline surveys and in the MIS under the Project to provide data for monitoring and targeting\nthe participation of the poor in project activities.\n\nd.\n\nTargeting the Full Participation of Women\n\nThe following strategy will be used in targeting the full participation of women under the\n53.\nProject:  (i)  organize  women  into  separate  groups  to  (a)  ensure  their  active  participation,  (b)\nprovide them with a forum to discuss issues related to their economic activities and livelihood,\nand  (c)  address  their  special  needs;  (ii)  ensure  that  women  comprise  at  least  half  of  the\n\n                                                \n26 Poor households will be mobilized to form groups in each dusun: one group for women and another for men. Social\nmobilization  and  human  development  training  will  follow  to  ensure  their  participation  in  the  village  development\nplanning process.\n\n\f18\n\nparticipants  in  the  community  training  and  at  least  half  of  the  participants  in  the  CBSLO\nformation and microenterprise training; (iii) ensure that women comprise at least half of the total\nCBSLO members; (iv) encourage women to run for CBSLO and Kelompok Kerja Pembangunan\nMasyarakat (KKPM) elective offices; (v) promote women\u2019s participation in all aspects of CBSLO\noperations,  including  formulating  lending  policies;  and  (vi)  ensure  that  each  CBSLO  will  adopt\nspecial measures to develop loan products that address the demands of women entrepreneurs\nand  poor  women.  A  separate  strategy  will  be  used  to  target  the  increased  participation  of\nwomen  at  the  village  and  local  government  levels  and  through  the  use  of  NGO  facilitators:  (i)\nencourage women to apply for vacant government staff positions in the project area; (ii) provide\nformal training for DGRCE staff, with women comprising at least 30 percent of the diploma-level\ntrainees, 25 percent of the undergraduate trainees, and 20 percent of the graduate trainees; (iii)\nensure that village planning committees will include at least two women representatives; and (iv)\nensure that half of the NGO facilitators to be employed in the Project are women.\n\nC. \n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  over  six  years  is  estimated  at  $170.2  million  equivalent,\n54.\nincluding  physical  and  price  contingencies,  interest  during  construction,  taxes,  and  duties.  Of\nthe  total  cost,  $45.5  million  or  27  percent  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $124.7  million\nequivalent or 73 percent is the local currency cost. A summary of the cost estimates is in Table\n1 and detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 4.\n\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\n Cost\n\nItem\n\nA.

Although  Indonesia\u2019s  economic\nrecovery  is  continuing,  the  economic  situation  remains  difficult.  Public  debt  has  ballooned  to\nabout  93  percent  of  gross  domestic  product,  excluding  the  Government\u2019s  contingent  liabilities.\nConsequently,  the  Government\u2019s  debt  service  burden  has  risen  sharply.  Given  the  anticipated\ntightness in the fiscal situation, the Government expressed its difficulty, at least in the short run,\nin  providing  40  percent  share  of  the  cost  in  project  financing  from  its  budgetary  sources.  The\nWorld Bank currently provides 75 percent of project costs on a three-year rolling average and a\nfurther  increase  in  its  share  is  understood  to  be  under  World  Bank\u2019s  consideration.  JBIC\ncurrently provides about 85 percent of project costs. Under these circumstances, it is proposed\nthat ADB\u2019s share of the project cost be increased to 80 percent for the first three years of project\nimplementation and revert to 60 percent after the third year. The temporary relaxation of ADB\u2019s\ncost-sharing limit for project financing is being sought as a purely temporary measure to assist\nIndonesia tide over its fiscal difficulties and to support Indonesia\u2019s incipient economic recovery.\nA  similar  financing  arrangement  is  being  proposed  for  all  project  loans  for  Indonesia  to  be\nconsidered  by  the  Board  in  2000.  This  proposal  is  in  accordance  with  the  graduation  policy,\nwhich  allows  ADB  financing  to  exceed  the  country  cost-sharing  limit  under  exceptional\ncircumstances and where justified on country and project grounds (para. 86). 27\n\n56.\nIt is proposed that ADB provide two loans comprising  (i) the loan in various currencies\nequivalent to Special Drawing Rights 38,752,000 from its Special Funds resources (SFR), with\nan amortization period of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge\nat the rate of 1 percent during the grace period and 1.5 percent thereafter,28 and (ii) the loan of\n$65 million equivalent from its ordinary capital resources (OCR), with interest to be determined\nin accordance with the ADB pool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans, with a\nmaturity of 25 years, including a grace period of 6 years, a front-end fee of 1 percent of the OCR\nloan  amount,  and  an  annual  commitment  charge  of  0.75  percent.  The  proposed  ADB  loans\nconstitute 68 percent of the total project cost and will collectively finance the foreign exchange\ncost of $45.5 million and a part of the local currency cost of up to $69.5 million equivalent. The\nBorrower will be the Republic of Indonesia. The Government will finance the remaining cost of\nthe Project amounting to about $55.2 million or 32 percent of the total project costs. A summary\nof the financing plan is in Table 2.\n\nSource\nAsian Development Bank\n    Ordinary Capital Resources\n    Asian Development Fund\n        Total\n\nGovernment\n\n             Total\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\n27.3\n18.2\n45.5\n\n   0.0\n\n45.5\n\n37.7\n31.8\n69.5\n\n55.2\n\n124.7\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n65.0\n50.0\n115.0\n\n55.2\n\n170.2\n\nPercent\n\n68\n\n32\n\n100\n\n                                                \n27  R204-98: A Graduation Policy for the Bank, 23 November.\n28  Unlike OCR funds, Special Funds resources have no commitment charge and no front-end fee.\n\n\f20\n\n57.\nThe  provision  of  SFR  to  the  Project  is  justified  in  view  of  the  very  strong  focus  on\nreducing poverty in rural areas and its significant support for the Government\u2018s major efforts on\ncapacity building to ensure the smooth transfer of administrative and fiscal responsibilities from\nthe Central level to local governments. The SFR will be used to support investment in process-\noriented activities that involve a broad spectrum of local government and village participants in\npreparing  and  implementing  village  development  plans,  and  in  developing  the  capacity  of\ncommunities to decide on the use of local funds for local-level development. These features will\nensure  that  Project-funded  activities  will  be  demand-driven  with  strong  ownership  by  local\ncommunities.\n\nE.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n58.\nThe  Directorate  General  of  Rural  Community  Empowerment  will  be  the  Executing\nAgency. Its role under the Project is consistent with its new mission under the decentralization\nframework to support and facilitate community development planning and coordinating with local\ngovernments and sector agencies in implementing economic growth programs.\n\n59.\nSix BPDs will serve as Implementing Agencies under the Project. Since they are taking\nfull  credit  risk  for  onlending  project  funds  to  CBSLOs,  they  are  also  referred  to  as  Executing\nBanks.  Although  the  six  BPDs\u2019  experience  in  microcredit  activities  ranges  from  limited  to\nadequate,  they  are  keen  to  participate  in  the  Project  in  view  of  their  changing  role  to  actively\ndevelop financial services in the rural areas of their respective provinces. One of the six BPDs is\na  participant  in  the  ADB-assisted  Microcredit  Project  and  has  gained  experience  in  providing\nwholesale  credit  to  nonbank  financial  institutions,  which  in  turn  onlend  funds  to  members,  an\narrangement similar to that proposed for CBSLOs and its members cum borrowers.\n\nF.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nProject Organization and Coordination\n\n \n \n60.\nThe  key  implementation  responsibility  under  the  Project  will  devolve  to  the  district\ngovernment  as  required  by  the  decentralization  laws.  Within  one  month  of  loan  effectiveness,\neach district will establish a PIU for day-to-day management of the Project. The project manager\nat each PIU will be appointed by the district chief (BUPATI).  Each district will establish a district\nadvisory group (DAG) within three months of loan effectiveness, to provide advice on measures\nfor addressing issues affecting timely implementation of the Project. Each DAG will be chaired\nby  the  district  chief  and  will  have  the  following  as  members:  the  chairperson  of  the  district\nparliament  concerned  and  representatives  from  the  district  planning  agency,  selected  district\ntechnical  support  agencies  (agriculture,  fisheries,  livestock,  trade  and  industry,  etc.),  BPD,\ndistrict women\u2019s group, and local credit unions.\n\n61.\nEach province will appoint a provincial project manager to provide support and advice to\nthe  participating  districts.  Selection  of  the  participating  districts  and  subdistricts  has  aimed  at\nlinking  clusters  of  poor  rural  communities  to  markets  located  at  the  nearby  urban  areas  or\ngrowth centers. Each participating province will establish a provincial coordination office (PCO),\nwithin one month of loan effectiveness, to serve primarily as a coordination center, for reporting\nfinancial  and  physical  progress  coming  from  a  number  of  districts,  and  for  backstopping  the\nproject  activities  of  the  local  governments.  Within  three  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  each\nparticipating  province  will  establish  a  provincial  advisory  group  (PAG)  to  be  chaired  by  the\ngovernor  of  the  province  and  will  comprise  the  following:  chairperson  of  the  provincial\nparliament,  the  head  of  the  provincial  planning  agency  (BAPPEDA),  heads  of  provincial\n\n\f21\n\ntechnical  support  agencies  (agriculture,  fisheries,  livestock,  trade  and  industry,  etc.),  and\nrepresentatives of concerned BPDs, women\u2019s groups, and local credit unions.  Each PAG will\nadvise  on  strengthening  selected  agencies  to  provide  support  for  project  activities  in\nparticipating  provinces  and  districts,  and  on  issues  relating  to  project  coordination.  The  DAGs\nand PAGs will meet as necessary and at least once every three months.\n\n62.\nUnder  the  decentralization  framework,  DGRCE  needs  to  strengthen  its  institutional\ncapacity  to  serve  in  its  new  role  and  function  to  facilitate  and  monitor  the  progress  of\nimplementation  of  a  decentralized  and  village  demand-driven  Project.    With  the  day-to-day\nmanagement  of  the  Project  devolved  to  the  district  governments,  DGRCE  will  need  to\nstrengthen its own capability to establish and implement an effective monitoring and evaluation\nsystem. It will establish a project management office (PMO) in Jakarta, within one month of loan\neffectiveness. The PMO will be responsible for overall coordination and administration of project\nactivities,  particularly  for  (i)  submission  to  ADB  of  consolidated  progress  reports  and  other\nreports  submitted  by  each  PCO  and  PIU;  and  (ii)  timely  submission  to  ADB  of  unaudited  and\naudited accounts of the Project. The PMO will be headed by a full-time senior officer as project\nmanager, who will be assisted by two full-time assistant PMO project managers (APPMs), one\nAPPM to facilitate the implementation of part A of the Project and another APPM to facilitate the\nimplementation of part B and part C. The two APPMs will be assisted by two specialized teams,\ncomprising DGRCE staff,29 consultants, and NGO facilitators \u2013 one team for implementing part\nA and another for implementing part B and part C. To provide full liaison and coordination with\nall  national  agencies  and  departments  participating  in  the  Project,  a  national-level  project\nsteering committee (PSC) will be formed, within three months of loan effectiveness. The director\ngeneral  of  DGRCE  will  chair  the  PSC  and  will  include  as  members  representatives  from\nBAPPENAS;  the  ministries  of  finance,  agriculture,  industry  and  trade  and  cooperatives,  the\nCredit  Union  Federation  of  Indonesia,  and  as  appropriate,  local  governments.  The  PSC  will\naddress  and  resolve  major  policy  issues  affecting  the  Project  and  will  formulate  strategies  for\nproject implementation (Appendix 5).\n\n2. \n\nRegional Development Banks\n\nSix BPDs will serve as Executing Banks30 and will implement the credit subcomponent of\n63.\nthe Project to support CBSLO microenterprise development under part B (ii). These banks had\nbeen  set  up  in  each  province  between  1961  and  1965  to  promote  regional  development,\nincrease regional incomes, and help develop rural institutions. In 1967, BPDs were allowed to\naccept  demand  deposits,  grant  short-term  loans,  and  participate  in  equity  investments.  BPDs\nare owned by provincial and district governments. The Appraisal Mission assessed the financial\nconditions  of  the  six  BPDs,  for  1995  to  1999,  based  on  five  sets  of  financial  indicators  using\nCAMEL  rating.31  The  results  indicate  that  all  the  BPDs  have  \u201csatisfactory\u201d  CAMEL  ratings,\nexcept  for  BPD  Central  Sulawesi  (BPDCS)  and  BPD  North  Sulawesi  (BPDNS),  which  were\nrated  \u201cless  than  satisfactory\u201d.  However,  after  BPDNS  was  recapitalized  and  underwent\nstructural changes in 1999, it was rated \u201csatisfactory\u201d at end-1999. Bank Indonesia (BI), which\nalso  supervises  the  performance  of  the  BPDs,  had  rated  all  the  BPDs  in  March  2000  as\n\u201csatisfactory,\u201d  except  for  BPDCS,  which  received  \u201cless  than  satisfactory\u201d  because  of  its  high\nnonperforming loan (NPL) ratio (Appendix 6).\n\n                                                \n29 PMO staff should include a financial management specialist and a procurement specialist.\n30 The term refers to banks taking full risk in repaying credit relent to them by MOF for onlending to subborrowers.\n31 C = capital adequacy, A = asset quality, M = management, E = earning history, and L = liquidity. C is based on\ncapital  adequacy  ratio;  A,  on  productive  asset  ratio  and  provision  for  loan  loss;  M,  on  operational  efficiency  and\nother qualitative aspects of management; E, on return on assets and return on equity; and L, on net interbank ratio\nand loan-to-deposit ratio. There are four CAMEL ratings: good, satisfactory, less than satisfactory, and poor.\n\n\f22\n\nBI informed the Mission that considering the above rating, it conducted a \u201cfit and proper\n64.\ntest\u201d of senior officers and operational procedures of BPDCS. BPDCS received a passing mark,\nindicating  that  it  has  an  acceptable  set  of  officers  and  acceptable  operations.  BI  and  BPDCS\nagreed on measures (improved collection and writing off bad loans) to reduce the amount of its\nNPLs in one year to improve its BI rating. This satisfactory rating is a precondition before MOF\ncan relend ADB loan funds to BPDCS. The Mission examined the future financial viability of the\nsix  BPDs  by  conducting  financial  projections  based  on  CAMEL  rating  for  2001\u20132006.  The\nassumptions used are presented in detail in Appendix 6. The results indicate that all the BPDs\nwould  continue  to  have  long-term  viability,  including  BPDCS.  BPDCS  will  improve  its  CAMEL\nrating from \u201cless than satisfactory\u201d to \u201csatisfactory\u201d by year 2002 when the loan disbursement to\nCBSLOs  is  expected  to  take  place.  The  Mission  concluded  that  all  six  BPDs  are  qualified  to\nparticipate in the Project as Executing Banks.\n\n3. \n\nRelending and Onlending Terms\n\n65.\nThe Borrower would relend part of the ADB funds to the BPDs under a subsidiary loan\nagreement  under  the  following  terms  and  conditions:  (i)  an  amortization  period  of  10  years,\nincluding a grace period of 3 years; and (ii) an interest rate of not less than the reference rate\n(defined  as  the  average  rate  of  interest  prevailing  for  90-day  rupiah-denominated  Bank\nIndonesia  Certificate  [SBI]  over  the  most  recent  three  months).  The  interest  rate  will  be\nreviewed annually by ADB and the Government. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the\nBorrower. Each BPD will onlend the funds (taking the credit risk) to qualified CBSLOs that have\nregistered  as  a  legal  entity  and  fulfilled  other  conditions  as  required  by  the  BPD,  under  an\nonlending agreement between the BPD and each CBSLO. The CBSLOs will lend the funds to\ntheir members under a subborrower agreement between the CBSLO and the borrower.\n\n66.\nThe  BPD  will  onlend  to  CBSLOs  under  the  following  terms  and  conditions:  (i)  an\namortization  period  of  up  to  two  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  three  months;  and  (ii)  an\ninterest rate of not less than the interest rate payable by BPD under the relevant subsidiary loan\nagreement plus a maximum of 8 percent margin. Currently, the interest rate is about 20 percent,\nwhich  is  considered  sufficient  to  cover  the  credit  risk  and  operational  expenses.  The  interest\nrate charged by CBSLOs to their borrowing members would be set by the members themselves,\nbut  would  probably  be  30\u201333  percent  approximating  the  market  rates  prevailing  in  the  project\narea  (Appendix  7).  This  is  considered  sufficient  to  allow  CBSLOs  to  accumulate  capital.  The\ncredit risk associated with defaults by individual CBSLO members would accrue to the CBSLO,\nwhile  the  credit  risk  arising  from  a  CBSLO  default  would  accrue  to  the  BPD  concerned.  After\nsuccessful repayment, CBSLOs can seek additional loans from the BPDs.\n\n4.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nThe  proposed  Project  will  be  implemented  over  six  years  from  January  2001.  An\n67.\nindicative  implementation  schedule  is  in  Appendix  8.  The  two  training  programs,  each  for  six\nmonths,  can  be  conducted  in  the  same  village  in  sequence.  The  first  training  program  will\ninvolve capacity building training (under part A) for the whole village. After the first two months,\nthe  community  will  be  able  to  identify  the  constraints  they  face  in  increasing  income,  their\nneeds,  and a list of  profitable community microenterprises for the urban markets. At this time,\nthe  second  training  program  to  form  CBSLOs  under  part  B  of  the  Project  starts,  involving\ninterested members most of whom are microentrepreneurs. Interest will widen since part B will\naddress  their  need  for  credit  to  support  their  livelihood  and  microenterprise  activities.  Within\neight  months,  one  cycle  of  training,  involving  capacity  building  and  CBSLO  establishment,  will\nhave been completed. Villages that successfully complete part A training are eligible to receive\nthe  village  grant  (amounting  to  $7,800)  enabling  the  community  to  implement  by  themselves\n\n\f23\n\none  of  the  simple  rural  infrastructure  projects  (e.g.,  rehabilitation  of  an  access  road)  they\nidentified  in  their  village  development  plan.  Subsequently,  eligible  villages  will  be  assisted  to\nconstruct  medium  to  large  civil  works  (Types  I  and  II)  described  in  Appendix  3.  In  the  second\nyear of Project implementation, BPDs will provide credit for entrepreneurial activities to eligible\nCBSLOs,  which  have  shown  at  least  one  year  of  sustained  savings  by  members  and  a  good\nrecord  of  lending  to  members  using  their  own  savings.  Supervised  by  BPDs  and  PMD  staff,\neach CBSLO will be required to prepare a profit and loss statement (PLS) annually and conduct\nannual meetings to elect officers and to discuss the PLS for transparency.\n\n5.\n\nFlow of Funds\n\n68.\nUnder  approved  arrangements,  project  loan  funds  will  flow  directly  from  MOF  to  three\nlevels of management: the PMO in Jakarta, the PCO in the provincial capital, and the PIUs at\nthe district level. They will be provided as earmarked special funds allocation budgets. Funds for\nthe credit scheme of part B will be relent by MOF to the BPDs in six provinces for onlending to\nCBSLOs.  The  flow  of  funds  from  MOF  to  the  BPDs  will  be  governed  by  a  subsidiary  loan\nagreement  between  MOF  and  each  BPD  under  terms  and  conditions  acceptable  to  ADB\n(Appendix  9).  The  Government  provided  assurances  that  the  provision  of  funds  from  the\nproceeds of the loans, and the corresponding counterpart contributions necessary for financing\nProject  activities  would  continue  throughout  Project  implementation  through  the  earmarked\nspecial  funds  allocation,  notwithstanding  (i)  any  reallocation  of  authority  or  responsibility  for\nchanneling of external assistance, and for provision of corresponding counterpart contributions\nbetween the Central Government, the participating provinces, and the participating districts; or\n(ii)  any  requirement  for  provision  of  matching  counterpart  contributions  for  funding  project\nactivities from participating provinces or participating districts, arising from the implementation of\nthe provisions of Decentralization Laws 22 and 25.  The Government agreed to regularly update\nADB  on  the  process  of  decentralization  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the\ndecentralization  laws  and  any  relevant  implementation  regulations  issued,  and  to  take  into\naccount any views ADB expresses on them.32\n\n6.\n\nProcurement\n\nCivil works under the Project consist of construction or renovation of existing offices and\n69.\nconstruction  of  rural  infrastructure  \u2013  access  roads,  small  bridges  and  box  culverts,  village\nmarkets and jetties \u2013 which are widely dispersed throughout the project area. Except for about\n11 civil works contract packages estimated to cost less than $500,000, the rest of the packages\nwill  cost  less  than  $100,000.  Goods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  under  the  Project  will  be\nprocured in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. However, these contracts\n\n                                                \n32 The procedures and guidelines for Laws 22 and 25 have been developed and it is not necessary to link the design\nand  implementation  schedule  of  the  Project  to  the  full  implementation  of  these  two  laws.  The  implementing\nregulations  for  Law  22  provide  a  detailed  framework  for  distributing  administrative  functions  between  layers  of\ngovernment.  When  enacted,  the  implementing  regulations  for  Law  25,  would  elaborate  the  mechanisms  and\ndistribution  of  revenues  between  different  levels  of  government.  The  implementation  of  Law  25  may  be  directly\nrelevant to the Project to the extent that it envisages reallocation of fiscal responsibilities between the Central and\nregional  governments.  To  safeguard \nthe  reallocation  of\nresponsibilities,  the  Government  has  provided  specific  assurances.  Broadly,  the  Government  accepted  that  any\nsuch  reallocation  would  be  internal  to  the  Government  without  any  impact  on  project  implementation.  Specific\nassurances regarding provision of counterpart funds and repayment of the ADB loan are in paras. 119 (i) and (ii).\n\nfrom  any  uncertainties  regarding \n\nthe  Project \n\n\f24\n\nare not likely to attract international contractors.33 Local contractors capable of undertaking such\nworks  are  available.  Therefore,  to  ensure  quality,  the  civil  works  contracts  will  be  awarded  on\nthe basis of local competitive bidding (LCB) among prequalified contractors in accordance with\nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB. The PIU in each participating district will submit to\nADB the first set of draft LCB documents for prior review and approval before advertising for the\nrelevant contract. Furthermore, each of the 11 district PIUs will submit to ADB the first two LCB\ncontracts  for  prior  approval:  (i)  the  proposed  prequalification  documentation,  and  (ii)  the\nproposal for award of contract. ADB will be furnished with three copies of (i) an account of the\npublic  opening  of  bids,  (ii)  a  summary  and  evaluation  of  the  bids,  (iii)  the  proposal  for  award,\nand (iv) a draft contract or a draft letter of acceptance. Promptly after award of each contract,\nADB will be furnished with three copies of the contract as executed. ADB will have the right to\nreview  the  documentation  of  any  contract  awarded  under  LCB  procedures  and  to  refuse  to\nfinance  such  a  contract  if  it  concludes  that  prequalification  of  the  contractor  or  award  of  the\ncontract is inconsistent with the Government procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. Civil\nworks  for  pathways,  storage  sheds,  and  similar  structures  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of\n$50,000  or  less  may  involve  the  participation  of  local  communities  and  will  be  awarded  in\naccordance with procedures to be agreed upon between the PIU and the community concerned,\nand acceptable to ADB.\n\n70.\nUtility vehicles, motorcycles, computers, and other office equipment will be purchased by\nthe PMO, PCOs, and PIUs in their respective locations in Jakarta, and the provincial or district\ncapitals.  Purchase  of  vehicles  and  motorcycles  will  depend  on  the  availability  of  motor  outlets\nand service centers, either in the district or at the provincial capital. Depending on the total cost\nof the package, about 91 vehicles and 304 motorcycles will be purchased through international\nshopping  for  contracts  below  $500,000,  or  direct  purchase  for  contracts  valued  at  less  than\n$100,000. Indicative contract packages and procurement modes for major goods and services\nare shown in Appendix 10.\n\n7. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n71.\nConsulting  services  will  provide  the  needed  expertise  to  assist  in  implementing  the\nProject.  International  consulting  firms,  in  association  with  domestic  consulting  firms,  will  be\nrecruited  based  on  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. A total of about 1,054 person-\nmonths  of  consulting  services  will  be  required:  236  (approximately  22  percent  of  the  total)\ninternational, and 818  (approximately 78 percent of the total) domestic. The consulting services\nwill  be  divided  into  four  packages,  one  package  each  for  parts  A,  B,  C,  and  D  components.\nPackage  1  will  comprise  about  283  person-months  of  international  and  domestic  consultants;\npackage 2, about 285; package 3, about 272; and package 4, about 214. The list of consultants\nrequired is in Appendix 11, while the outline terms of reference are in Appendix 12.\n\n72.\nThe contracts for packages 1, 2, 3, and 4 will include provisions allowing consultants to\ncontract  the  services  of  NGO  facilitators  for  capacity  building  training  and  forming  CBSLOs  in\ntargeted villages, subdistricts, and districts; and NGO field monitors for oversight activities at the\ndistrict  level.  NGO  facilitators  and  NGO  field  monitors  will  be  selected  and  engaged  through\nsubcontract by the consultants concerned in accordance with competitive selection criteria and\n\n                                                \n33 Eleven districts in the six provinces will select 11 core subprojects to start implementation in the first two years. It is\nexpected that the core subprojects will include rehabilitation of road links and construction of bridges/box culverts\non those road links to move commerce and improve transportation links for general purposes. The roads will serve\nseveral villages and be connected to the commercial areas of rural and/or urban centers. The maximum length of\nroad would be about 2-3 km and would include 2-3 drainage crossings (bridges or box culverts).\n\n\f25\n\nprocedures acceptable to ADB, including prior review and approval of such selection criteria by\nADB. In addition, the PMO will invite universities or research institutions to bid for a number of\nstudies involving poverty monitoring and impact studies, and environmental studies\n\n8.\n\nAdvance Action\n\n73.\nAdvance action on the preparation of tender documents to reduce the time needed for\nengaging  and  fielding  consultants  for  the  Project  is  deemed  essential  to  avoid  any  delays  in\nproject  start-up.  The  Government  requested  ADB  approval  of  advance  action  in  selecting\nconsultants to enable the Government to invite proposals from consultants immediately after the\nProject  is  approved.  Approval  of  advance  action  was  given  by  Management  at  the  Loan  and\nTechnical  Assistance  Coordination  Committee.  The  Mission  has  advised  the  Government  that\nadvance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project. Advance action for engagement of\nconsultants will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n\n9.\n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\n74.\nMaintenance  will  be  required  for  all  rural  infrastructure  subprojects,  including  those\nconstructed with grant funds from part A. Routine maintenance will be carried out by the villages\nconcerned,  using  a  memorandum  of  agreement  between  the  PIU  and  the  concerned  village\norganizations. Most of the maintenance will involve spreading gravel and repairing potholes in\nroad  surfaces,  painting,  cutting  grass/weeds,  trimming  trees,  cleaning  side  ditches,  placing\nculverts, etc. The Project will finance the cost of the materials for the village organizations based\non a survey of needs carried out by the rural infrastructure engineers and villagers, and deliver\nthe materials on an as-needed basis. The recurrent costs for O&M of civil works will be financed\nby the Project on a declining basis as follows: 100 percent in years 1 and 2, 80 percent in year\n3, 60 percent in year 4, 50 percent in year 5, and none starting year 6 and onward.\n\n10.\n\nSpecial Accounts\n\n75.\nTo  expedite  the  disbursement  of  loan  proceeds,  the  Project  will  open  two  imprest\naccounts (special accounts), which will be established and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on Imprest Fund and Statement of Expenditures Procedures.  At  the  request  of  the\nGovernment,  ADB  will  deposit  an  initial  amount  not  exceeding  $1.5  million  equivalent  in  an\nimprest  account  from  the  OCR  loan  funds,  and  will  deposit  into  a  second  imprest  account  the\namount not exceeding $1.0 million from the ADF loan funds. Funds for the credit subcomponent\nunder  part  B  of  the  Project  will  be  drawn  from  time  to  time  from  the  imprest  account  for  OCR\nfunds.  The  statement  of  expenditures    (SOE)  procedures  will  be  used  for  reimbursing  eligible\nexpenditures not exceeding $50,000 equivalent.\n\n11.\n\nProject Accounts, Audits, and Reports\n\n76.\nThe  PMO,  PCOs,  and  PIUs  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  to  identify  goods  and\nservices financed out of the loan proceeds and disclose the use thereof in the Project. The PMO\nwill  have  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  for  the  various  subcomponents,  including\nspecial accounts and the statement of expenditures, audited annually, in accordance with sound\nauditing principles by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. It was agreed that a part of the\nloan  funds  amounting  to  about  $100,000  would  be  used  by  the  Government  in  selecting  and\nengaging  the  services  of  qualified  independent  auditors  in  accordance  with  competitive\nselection  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  This  measure  will  ensure  the  timely  submission  of\naudited financial accounts to ADB. Certified copies of such audited accounts and the reports of\nthe  auditors  relating  thereto  will  be  submitted  within  nine  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal\n\n\f26\n\nyear. The Mission reminded Government representatives and DGRCE of the new ADB policy on\nsubmission  of  audited  accounts:  a  formal  warning  will  be  issued  for  accounts  more  than  6\nmonths overdue and disbursements will be suspended if the accounts are 12 months overdue.\nA  framework  for  monthly  reporting  by  electronic  mail  from  the  PMO  to  ADB  using  a  format\nsimilar  to  ADB\u2019s  project  performance  report  will  be  established  at  inception.  In  addition,  the\nPMO will prepare semiannual and annual progress reports during the implementation period, a\nmidterm  evaluation  report,  and  a  project  completion  report  three  months  after  project\ncompletion. The PMO will engage two teams of consultants to prepare the midterm report and\nthe project completion report.\n\n77.\nEach BPD will also maintain suitable subsidiary books and records to clearly indicate the\ndrawdowns  from  the  line  of  credit  from  MOF  and  progress  in  utilization  of  the  credit  line,\ncovering onlending to CBSLOs and repayments or arrears of CBSLOs. The BPD will submit to\nthe PMO and ADB semiannual reports for joint reporting on the Project. The reports will include\nprogress  made  and  problems  encountered  during  the  period  under  review,  steps  taken  to\nremedy the problems, the proposed program including training for BPD staff and participation in\ntraining  for  CBSLO  members,  and  expected  disbursements  during  the  following  period.  Each\nBPD will have its accounts and financial statements (balance sheets, statement of income and\nexpenses,  and  related  statements)  audited  annually,  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing\nstandards,  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  MOF  and  ADB.  Certified  copies  of  such\nreports and the reports of the auditors related thereto will be submitted within nine months after\nthe  end  of  each  fiscal  year.  Each  BPD  will  also  prepare  annual  progress  reports,  a  midterm\nevaluation report, and a completion report three months after project completion. The domestic\nconsultants building the capacity of BPDs in microfinance will assist in preparing the outline of\nthe progress reports.\n\n78.\nTo  safeguard  their  continued  satisfactory  performance,  the  Government  through  Bank\nIndonesia  will regularly monitor the financial conditions of the six BPDs. It has been agreed that\nin  the  event  any  BPD  fails  to  maintain  a  satisfactory  rating  for  three  consecutive  months,  the\nGovernment, through Bank Indonesia, will immediately review the operations of the concerned\nBPD,  and  in  the  meantime  suspend  any  further  disbursements  under  the  relevant  subsidiary\nloan  agreements  until  remedial  measures  agreed  upon  by  Bank  Indonesia  and  the  concerned\nBPD have been implemented.\n\n12.\n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation\n\nAn integrated system of data collection and analysis based on PPMS will be designed by\n79.\nconsultants  and  implemented  to  monitor  progress  in  achieving  the  Project\u2019s  objectives.  The\nPPMS will provide the Government and ADB with the necessary data to monitor project inputs,\nactivities, outputs, and objective indicators as provided in the project framework; and to assess\nthe technical, social, environmental, financial, and economic aspects of the Project. The PPMS\nwill  also  provide  for  the  establishment  and  monitoring  of  a  computerized  management\ninformation  system  to  assist  in  the  day-to-day  management  of  project  activities.  DGRCE  will\nestablish the PPMS at its headquarters and maintain it after project completion.\n\n13. \n\nAnticorruption Measures\n\n80.\nThe  Mission  explained  the  ADB  anticorruption  policy,  particularly  the  section  on  fraud\nand  corruption,  as  stated  in  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement  and Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants.  It  was  noted  that  effective  project  implementation  encompasses  all  aspects  of\nproject execution. In that regard, good governance practices and ethical standards are expected\nof all project staff, especially those involved in bidding and execution of contracts, and project-\n\n\f27\n\nfunded consultants and NGOs. The Project itself is designed to promote greater transparency,\naccountability,  and  direct  participation  of  village-level  beneficiaries,  thus  dramatically  reducing\nopportunities for corruption.\n\n14.\n\nMidterm Review\n\n81.\nA  comprehensive  midterm  review  will  be  conducted  at  the  end  of  year  3  of  project\nimplementation to assess the progress of physical implementation of the various components:\ncivil  works  awards;  procurement  of  consulting  services,  vehicles,  and  equipment;  contract\nawards  and  disbursement  projections;  and  to  determine  the  need  for  any  change  in  project\nscope.  Specifically,  the  performance  of  capacity  building  and  human  resources  development\nunder part A will be assessed to determine if geographic coverage may be extended from the\nsix core provinces to 20 new expansion provinces, that show commitment on a voluntary basis.\nThe review will also examine closely whether the targets set for the full participation of women,\nindigenous communities, and the poor are being met or not and whether upward revisions of the\ntargets  are  warranted.  The  review  will  also  determine  if  both  the  geographic  and  individual\ntargeting  mechanisms  described  are  adequate  to  bring  the  proportion  of  poor  beneficiaries  to\ntwo thirds of the total project beneficiaries to achieve project objectives. A team of international\nconsultants will be engaged for two months to conduct the midterm review.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironment\n\nThe  Project  has  minimal  negative  environmental  impact  and  is  rated  as  Category  B\n82.\nbased on ADB\u2019s classification system. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared\nto assess two categories of activities likely to have potential environmental impact.\n\nThe  first  relates  to  rural  infrastructure  construction.  A  screening  of  24  typical  types  of\n83.\nproposed infrastructure construction indicates that only six types (involving Type 1 civil works)\nwarrant  concerns  about  possible  adverse  but  mitigable  impacts.  The  most  probable  impacts\nwould  be  safety  during  construction,  handling  and  rerouting  of  water,  disposal  of  waste  and\neffluent  into  waterways,  and  new  road  alignments  that  might  traverse  or  skirt  cemeteries  or\nenvironmentally sensitive areas such as protected forests. For such activities, specific terms of\nreference  will  be  included  in  the  construction  contracts  to  ensure  that  standard  government\nenvironmental procedures (ANDAL) are followed and proper environmental mitigation measures\nare  incorporated  in  the  engineering  design.  The  Project  has  a  provisional  sum  in  the\nconsultants\u2019 contract  to permit contracting for environmental studies and services and engaging\nthe  appropriate  environment  specialists  to  prepare  terms  of  reference  for  such  contracts,\nconduct initial environmental impact evaluation, review proposals from contractors, and develop\nan environmental management and impact monitoring plan.\n\n84.\nThe second category comprises 48 types of microenterprises that may be funded under\npart B. Most enterprises are handicrafts and home processing of food products, and individually\nare  environmentally  benign.  Thirteen  are  assessed  as  having  potential  adverse  environmental\nimpacts, with half having slight impacts. The concern is that a geographic concentration of these\ntypes of microenterprises \u2013 handicrafts and furniture production using raw materials from nearby\nforests  \u2013  could,  in  the  aggregate,  generate  negative  or  indirect  environmental  impacts.  The\nProject  will  thus  use  the  environmental  studies  contract  for  technical  assistance  to  prepare\nguidelines to be used in the training program for CBSLOs and for the six BPDs to screen loan\nproposals  from  CBSLOs.  For  activities  with  possible  aggregate  effects,  the  guidelines  will\ninclude criteria to establish the basis for rejecting the proposals. A consultant will be engaged\n\n\f28\n\nsix months after the start of project implementation to prepare the environmental management\nand monitoring plan, which will be submitted to ADB for approval before any rural infrastructure\nand any microenterprise subprojects are approved.  The Government will ensure that any rural\ninfrastructure subprojects and entrepreneurial activities that have potentially significant adverse\nenvironmental  impacts,  as  determined  by  an  IEE,  will  be  excluded  from  financing  under  the\nProject.\n\n2. \n\nSocial Analysis\n\n85.\nThe Project is to be implemented in six provinces in various agroecological zones: from\nsettled  agriculture  in  North  Sulawesi  to  upland  and  sometimes  swidden  cultivation  in  Central\nSulawesi,  mixed  tree-crop  farming  in  Southeast  Sulawesi,  and  lowland  river-based  agriculture\nand  aquaculture  in  South  Kalimantan.  This  implies  a  large  range  of  settlement  patterns  and\nproduction techniques.  The areas range from the mono-ethnic groups in North Sulawesi to the\ncomplex but established Christian and Muslim communities in Central Sulawesi, coastal Malays\nand riverine Dayaks in Kalimantan, a mix of old communities and new settlements in Southeast\nSulawesi, a receiving area of the overflow from the historically disaster-prone South Sulawesi.34\nThus,  the  project  area  is  diverse  in  the  nature  of  resources  to  be  developed  and  in  terms  of\npeoples, what they do, and how they do it.\n\n The districts have been selected because they are poor, and relatively isolated by virtue\n86.\nof distance, difficult geography, and poor infrastructure.  As a result of this isolation they have\nrelatively limited access to information about a range of subjects, from production technologies\nto prices.  In marketing they tend to be price takers, dependent on either the village trader or a\nfew  itinerant  buyers.  They  have  also  been  relatively  underserved  by  government  and\ndevelopment  projects  and \nterms  of  basic  education  and  health  services.  Under\ndecentralization, their future access to basic services and development will depend on how well\nthey are able to articulate their needs and priorities to local government. The new situation will\nbe a significant departure from their experience to date, which has been largely as recipients of\nassistance  that,  from  a  local  perspective,  occurred  at  unpredictable  times  and  of  a  type  and\nquantity  only  loosely  linked  to  local  needs  and  conditions.  Significant  capacity  building  will  be\nrequired to link these populations, not only economically but politically, to their local leaders and\ndecisions makers.\n\nin \n\n87.\nThe status of women and how they occupy their time differ across the project provinces\nand districts.  With the expansion of the education system in the provinces, the participation rate\nof girls and boys in basic education has increased. In some districts, Banjar in South Kalimantan\nand Donggala in Southeast Sulawesi, girls access to education is limited compared with that of\nboys.  In  other  areas  \u2013  Minahasa  in  North  Sulawesi  and  Kendari  in  Southeast  Sulawesi  \u2013  the\nreverse  is  true  and  school  participation  rate  of  girls  in  junior  secondary  school  is  about  10\npercent  higher  than  that  of  boys.  But  these  are  relatively  late  developments,  since  the  1990s,\nand therefore the majority of the adult female population is characterized by levels of education\nand levels of literacy lower than those of men. This, combined with other social cultural norms,\nimplies  that  women  have  far  less  access  in  economic  and  civil  life  than  men.  Nonetheless,\nwomen are active in the labor force.35 Their participation is significantly lower than the national\naverage in East Kalimantan and North Sulawesi implying that some cultural factors at work may\nbe keeping women at home. At the same time, the proportion of women seeking work in North\n                                                \n34 Southeast Sulawesi was originally a sparsely populated corner of South Sulawesi until it became a province of its\nown  right  in  the  1960s;  it  has  seen  waves  of  in-migration  in  the  wake  of  various  calamities  in  South  Sulawesi\nincluding famine, the last of which occurred in the 1970s.\n\n35 Labor force participation is the proportion of women who worked or desired to work in the reference period where\n\nwork is defined to include both formal and informal sectors and unpaid family labor.\n\n\f29\n\nSulawesi  is  well  over  the  national  average  and  indicates  a  high  unmet  demand  for  income-\ngenerating activities for women. In general, women are economically active in agriculture, food\nprocessing, crafts, and petty trade.\n\nThe Project targets primarily the poor through a three-pronged strategy. The Project will\n88.\n(i)  help  the  poor  secure  their  livelihood  through  improved  infrastructure  and  microfinance\nservices,  (ii)  empower  the  poor  in  village  economic  and  social  life  through  village-level  social\nmobilization, and (iii) influence the political process by increasing the capacity of local officials to\nrespond to the needs of the poor. The poor are selected through a combination of (i) geographic\ntargeting,  and  (ii)  targeting  of  poor  individuals  in  the  community.  Geographic  targeting  selects\nvillages  with  a  poverty  incidence  of  up  to  58  percent,  while  individual  targeting  is  used  to\nincrease  the  proportion  of  the  total  number  of  poor  beneficiaries  to  two  thirds  of  the  total\nbeneficiaries. The strategy for targeting the poor is elaborated in the supplementary appendix.\n\n89.\nGeographic targeting is accomplished by using the IDT classification of villages having\nlow  levels  of  infrastructure,  which  is  highly  correlated  with  poverty,  combined  with  the  use  of\nlocal  knowledge-based  criteria.  Individual  targeting  is  carried  out  by  NGO  village  facilitators\nhired  under  the  Project.  The  participation  of  the  poor  will  be  further  ensured  by  using  criteria\nfavoring their participation in the Project: (i) minimum representation of the poor on the village\nplanning  boards,  (ii)  inclusion  of  a  poverty  impact  assessment  to  be  carried  out  for  all\ninfrastructure  proposed  for  construction  under  the  Project  to  be  carried  out  by  the  NGO\nfacilitator, and (iii) incorporation of guidelines in the CBSLO charter for targeting poor members\nof the community. In this manner, the Project will increase the proportion of poor beneficiaries to\ntwo  thirds  of  the  total  beneficiaries.  Training  the  local  government  officials  will  increase  the\nresponsiveness  of  local  governments  responsible  for  design  and  implementation  of  a  poverty\nreduction  program  to  the  needs  of  the  poor.  The  construction  of  local  and  village-level\ninfrastructure  will  help  raise  the  productivity  of  the  poor.  The  formation  of  CBSLOs  will  fill  the\nunmet  need of the  poor for  access to savings facilities while enabling access to flexible credit\ndesigned for their needs.\n\n90.\nThe Project seeks to empower women in the community\u2019s dialogue with Government to\nensure their views and needs are articulated and represented. This is done by promoting their\nparticipation  in  the  development  process  and  requiring  a  minimum  level  of  representation  of\nwomen in the village development councils. Experienced female NGO village facilitators will be\nhired.  In  the  government,  women  tend  to  be  underrepresented  at  decision-making  levels\nimplying gender bias or gender blindness in the development process. The Project will  assess\ngender balance in the Executing Agency and increase the pool of women eligible for promotion\nthrough the formal education training program. As women are economically active in the project\narea in a variety of activities ranging from small livestock to agriculture processing, handicrafts,\nand petty trade, bringing microfinance services closer to the village will enable them to save and\nborrow  more  securely,  and  hence,  increase  their  bargaining  power  while  reducing  their\ndependence on traditional moneylenders. The formation and training of CBSLOs will be such as\nto facilitate the participation of women. Training will be designed for people of low literacy levels.\nVillage facilitators will pay attention to promoting women\u2019s participation both as members and in\nCBSLO  management.  CBSLO  member  rules  will  be  designed  to  be  women  friendly,  and  no\nminimum  initial  savings  level  that  might  prove  to  be  a  barrier  to  joining  will  be  established.\nLending levels and terms will be sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of women who tend to be\nsmall entrepreneurs requiring small or short-term working capital.\n\n\f H.\n\nTechnical Assistance\n\n30\n\n91.\nThe  Government  noted  that  the  implementation  of  the  Project  and  the  two  new\ndecentralization  laws  would  start  simultaneously  in  January  2001.  The  need  to  upgrade  and\nstrengthen the institutional capacity of the district and village governments was underscored to\nsimultaneously prepare and set up the administrative structures and monitoring arrangement for\naccountability and transparency related to their new responsibilities. At issue is the need to set\nup a system for disbursement and monitoring of project funds to facilitate compliance with the\nspecific  financial  monitoring  and  other  reporting  requirements  of  the  Project  and  the\nGovernment. The purpose of the TA is to assist the Executing Agency in developing a system of\ndisbursing, monitoring, and accounting of project funds in 11 districts in six provinces. The total\ncost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $1.4  million  equivalent,  of  which  $0.5  million  will  be  the  foreign\nexchange cost and $0.9 million equivalent will be the local currency cost. Of the total cost, the\nGovernment has requested that $1.1 million, comprising all the foreign exchange costs and $0.6\nmillion equivalent of the local currency costs, be financed by ADB on a grant basis from ACCSF,\nfunded by the Government of Japan. The grant financing of $1.1 million constitute 80 percent of\nthe total TA cost. The Government will finance $0.3 million equivalent or 20 percent of the total\nTA cost, mostly in kind. The grant was provided considering the strong focus of the TA on good\ngovernance and sound fiscal management in support of poverty reduction (Appendix 13).\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\nThe financial analysis focused mainly on the financial viability of representative livelihood\n92.\nenterprises  engaged  in  by  members  of  CBSLOs,  under  the  rural  financial  institutions\nsubcomponent in part B. This, in turn, served as the basis for determining the financial viability\nof the representative microenterprises under the Project. As it is difficult to quantify the benefits\nfrom capacity-building investments carried out under part A, the economic analysis was carried\nout  only  for  part  B  taken  as  a  whole.  The  analysis  is  based  on  the  economic  benefits  derived\nfrom  the  representative  microenterprises  and  investment  costs  on  village-level  training,\nconsulting services for community development, domestic technicians, CBSLO formation, rural\ninfrastructure  improvement,  rural  infrastructure  operation  and  maintenance,  and  project\nmanagement.\n\n1.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n93.\nFor the financial analysis, 12 microenterprise models were chosen as representative of\npossible livelihood projects that CBSLO members may engage in.  The microenterprises were\nselected mainly for the possible type and range of investment costs that CBSLO members may\nrequire, within the limits of their financial capability and capacity to undertake such projects. The\nrepresentative  microenterprises  included  investments  in:  (i)  agricultural  activities  such  as\nchicken, vegetable, and cocoa production; (ii) food processing such as pineapple candy, palm\nsugar,  and  kerupuk  (crackers)  processing;  (iii)  handicraft  making  such  as  the  production  of\nfurniture, handbags, and palm leaf thatching; and (iv) service enterprises including investments\nin  welding  shops,  stores  and  restaurants,  and  transportation  services.  These  representative\nmicroenterprises  require  minimal  capital  investments  and  are  easy  to  implement,  given  the\nlimited skills, types of resources available, and low level of education of prospective investors.\n\n\f31\n\nThe  benefit-cost  ratio  (BCR)  for  each  microenterprise  was  estimated  to  determine  its\n94.\nviability. The analysis indicated that each representative microenterprise was financially sound,\nwith  calculated  BCRs  greater  than  one.  A  summary  of  the  investment  and  financial  models  of\neach  of  these  individual  microenterprises  is  presented  in  Table  3.  Returns  to  labor  are\ncalculated by dividing revenue less all costs except labor by the amount of labor required.\n\nTable 3: Summary of Microenterprise Investments, Net Income, and BCR\n\nMicroenterprise\n\nCapital\nInvestment\n(Rp)\n\nRevenue\n(Rp)\n\nProduction\nCost\n(Rp)\n\nNet Income\n(Rp)\n\nBCRa\n\nReturn to\nLabor b\n(Rp/day)\n\nA.

The analysis indicates that\nagricultural production activities required substantial decreases in output prices (10-25 percent)\nor  increases  in  production  costs  (14-36  percent)  compared  with  other  types  of  investment\nactivities to maintain a BCR equal to one. Food processing and most service enterprises were\nfound  to  be  sensitive  to  changes  in  output  prices  and  production  costs.  The  results  of  the\nswitching value calculations are in Table A14.1, Appendix 14.\n\n96.\nBased  on  the  calculated  streams  of  incremental  benefits  and  investment  costs,  the\ncalculated  FIRR  before  debt  service  for  the  microenterprises  is  45  percent,  which  adequately\ncovers  the  33  percent  interest  rate  on  capital  investment.  This  calculation  is  made  over  a  six-\nyear period taken as the life cycle for the small enterprises used as examples.\n\n2.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nThe economic analysis required a comparison of economic viability in with\u2013 and without\u2013\n97.\nProject situations based on estimates of (i) project investments, (ii) incremental costs associated\nwith  O&M  of  rural  infrastructure,  and  (iii)  incremental  costs  and  benefits  associated  with\nmicroenterprise  production  activities.  The  economic  evaluation  was  carried  out  for  those\naspects of the Project directly related to the preparation or undertaking of economic activities in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects. All investments in parts B\nand  C,  60  percent  of  total  investments  in  part  D,  and  all  investments  in  part  A  related  to\n\n\f32\n\ncommunity  development  \u2013  consulting  services,  village-level  training,  and  facilitators  \u2013  were\nincluded in the analysis.\n\n98.\nThe  resulting  net  present  value  showed  that  part  B  is  expected  to  generate\napproximately  Rp102  billion  (about  $14.6  billion)  for  the  economy.  The  Project  is  expected  to\nrealize an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of about 17 percent.\n\n99.\n Switching values indicate that the EIRR is not highly sensitive to decreases in prices of\nmicroenterprise products or to increases in project investment costs. For the EIRR to fall to 12\npercent, the level assumed to be the economic opportunity cost of capital, prices need to fall by\n23  percent  while  investment  costs  need  to  increase  by  about  30  percent.  Both  price  and\ninvestment costs need to decrease and increase, respectively, by about 13 percent to maintain\nan EIRR equal to 12 percent  (Appendix 14).\n\n100.\nThe  Project  will  benefit  both  economic  and  social  development  by  ensuring  that  the\ntargeted  districts,  villages,  and  individuals  have  the  benefit  of  improved  local  administrative\ncapability,  support  for  participatory  planning  and  implementation  of  improvements  in  rural\ninfrastructure,  and  access  to  financial  services  and  microenterprise  support.  The  poor  in\nparticular  will  benefit \nthe\nempowerment of rural village communities.\n\nimproved  economic  opportunities  grounded \n\nfrom  much \n\nin \n\nB.\n\nEnvironment\n\nthe \n\nIEE  assessed \n\n101. Since \ntwo  categories  of  project  activities  (civil  works  and\nentrepreneurial  activities)  could  have  potential  environmental  impact,  an  environmental\nmanagement and monitoring plan will be prepared. The services of an environmental specialist\nwill  be  engaged  at  the  start  of  project  implementation  to  prepare  the  plan.  Private  sector\ncontractors,  the  PIU,  and  village  staff  involved  in  the  construction  of  civil  works  under  part  C,\nand CBSLO and BPD officials involved in the processing and approval of subborrower loans for\nentrepreneurial  activities  under  part  B  will  actively  participate  in  managing  and  monitoring  the\nenvironment. This will ensure that any potential environmental impact is minimized and project\nactivities fully conform to the environmental guidelines of the Government and ADB.\n\nC.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n102.\nThe Project is designed to link underserved villages commercially to growth centers and\nto  institute  a  process  whereby  all  villagers,  including  the  poor,  are  able  to  plan  village-level\ndevelopment and form self-help savings and loan organizations. In this regard, the Project has\nseveral  important  social  features.  It  targets  IDT  villages:  almost  all  the  72  subdistricts  to  be\ncovered by the  Project have a preponderance of IDT villages, which is the best available proxy\nat  the  design  stage  to  locate  the  Project  in  poor  rural  areas  in  the  six  provinces.  Based  on\ninformation  obtained  during  the  feasibility  study  and  a  sample  of  village  socioeconomic\nprofiles,36 it is estimated that over half of the 750 villages to be covered are IDT villages. Most\nhouseholds in these villages are at or below the poverty line, estimated at Rp670,000 (less than\n$100)  per  annum  in  year  2000  values.  Interviews  conducted  during  the  TA  feasibility  studies\nperiod and during the Loan Fact-Finding and Appraisal Missions confirmed that many, if not the\nmajority, of project participants would be those at or below the poverty line.\n\n                                                \n36 A sample of about 30 village profiles was obtained during field reconnaissance.\n\n\f33\n\nTo  ensure  that  more  reliable  and  poverty-sensitive  criteria  are  used  and  to  provide  an\n103.\nopportunity for the DGRCE field staff and for potential target beneficiaries to participate in the\nselection process, it was decided not to finalize village selection during the project design stage.\nRather, the villages would be selected in year 1 of project implementation, following a rapid rural\nappraisal  of  each  subdistrict  and  consultation  (using  focus  group  interview  techniques)  with  a\nsample of potential beneficiaries.\n\n104.\nThe Project will make a significant investment in process-oriented activities to involve a\nbroad  spectrum  of  local  government  and  village  participants  in  identifying,  preparing,  and\nimplementing  village  development  plans  and  in  forming  and  operating  the  CBSLOs.  Such\nactivities will account for about 20 percent of the total project cost. The investment is expected\nto  generate  significant  positive,  although  intangible,  social  impacts:  inclusion  of  target\nbeneficiaries alongside local government officials in making key decisions concerning the use of\nfunds  for  local  development  at  the  level  where  they  matter  most.  This  feature  will  ensure  that\nProject-funded  activities  will  be  demand-driven  and  \u201cowned\u201d  by  local  communities,  thus\nunderscoring  the  purpose  of  the  decentralization  laws.  More  specifically,  through  the\ncommunity-based  planning  mechanisms,  Kelompok  Kerja  Pembangunan  Masyarakat  and\nCBSLOs, village participants would develop and apply planning and management skills for local\ndevelopment. It is expected that these villagers, if not themselves poor people, would also be in\na position to advocate and address the interests of the poor and any disadvantaged groups in\nthe  village  institutional  context  as  well  as  within  the  new  local  government  framework.  The\nProject would thus empower the targeted rural communities by providing them the capabilities to\nput social meaning into the government decentralization process.\n\n1.\n\nGender Considerations\n\n105. Reconnaissance  studies  and  other  information  gathered  during  the  feasibility  studies\nindicate  that  women  and  particularly  relatively  poor  women  form  the  majority  of  micro-\nentrepreneurs and savers in rural communities in the six provinces. Women from several ethnic\ngroups in Sulawesi have established a strong tradition in producing and selling in local markets\nhandicrafts  such  as  mats,  stone  jewelry  (with  distinctive  designs  of  their  ethnic  groups),  and\nprocessed foods from their home gardens. This observation is mirrored in the list of proposals\nobtained from feedback interviews with potential target beneficiaries \u2013 the majority involved food\nor  product  processing  and  small  businesses  commonly  operated  by  women.  These  findings\nprovide  assurance  that  women  will  benefit  directly  from  the  Project\u2019s  investments  in\nmicroenterprise  development,  provided  care  is  taken  that  this  assumption  is  borne  out  during\nproject implementation, and that poor women are not outcompeted by better-off members of the\nCBSLOs in seeking loan support. Training for CBSLOs will emphasize inclusion of women in all\naspects of operations. Lending policies will be tailored to the demand of women entrepreneurs\nand  skewed  in  favor  of  poor  women.  The  project  consultants  will  work  out  the  details  during\nimplementation of the CBSLOs formation subcomponent.\n\n2.\n\nIndigenous People\u2019s Plan\n\n106. An  indigenous  people\u2019s  plan  was  prepared.  The  Mission  assessed  the  Project  as\nessentially  neutral  for  indigenous  people.  It  will  not  have  a  negative  effect  on  their  cultural  or\npolitical  norms  or  affect  their  access  to  land  or  other  resources.  The  empowerment  process\nunder part A will be beneficial to marginal communities that wish to participate and which may\nhave been neglected in the previous centrally planned development process. Local communities\nwill  be  given  greater  opportunities  and  increased  skills  to  plan,  manage,  and  decide  on  the\ncontent and direction of their own development plans. Part of the subdistrict development plan\nwill  be  identifying  and  mapping  marginal  or  isolated  communities  and  groups.  In  general,  the\n\n\f34\n\nProject  is  expected  to  bring  positive  benefits  to  indigenous  people  by  giving  them  access  to\nmainstream services and to improved governance practices (Appendix 15).\n\nD. \n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n1. \n\nPoverty Reduction\n\n107.\nThe  Project  targets  the  poor  by  helping  them  secure  their  livelihood  through  improved\nmicrofinance services and rural infrastructure, empowering them in village economic and social\nlife  through  village-level  social  mobilization,  and  influencing  the  political  process  by  increasing\nthe  capacity  of  local  officials  to  respond  to  the  needs  of  the  poor.  The  Project  promotes  the\nparticipation  of  women  at  every  step  of  this  process  and  brings  microfinance  services  to  the\nvillage,  enabling  women  to  save  and  obtain  credit  more  securely,  and  thus  reduce  their\ndependence  on  moneylenders.  The  Project  will  also  benefit  about  4,500  community  leaders\ntrained in participatory approaches, management skills, and financial management.\n\nThe Project aims to reduce poverty by increasing the incomes of about 425,000 people,\n108.\nor 85,000 families, through microenterprise and small enterprise development. Of these, about\n370,000 people, or 74,000 families, are expected to move above the poverty line. The Project\nwill directly benefit about 550,000 people, or 110,000 families, in the project area, equivalent to\n4  percent  of  the  population,  through  capacity  building  for  local  government,  employment,  and\nenterprise  development.  About  1.1  million  people,  or  220,000  families,  in  750  villages  in  11\ndistricts  will  benefit  from  improved  rural  infrastructure  enabling  them  access  to  markets  in\nnearby urban centers or growth corridors for their products and to social and health services. An\nestimated  185,000  jobs  will  be  generated  from  project  activities.  The  Project  will  extend  the\ngeographic scope of its community training and community empowerment, under part A, to an\nadditional  40  districts  from  20  expansion  provinces  following  successful  midterm  evaluation  of\nthe  Project.  The  community-based  planning  mechanism  introduced  are  key  to  instituting  good\ngovernance practices in the community development process.\n\n2.\n\nNonquantifiable Benefits\n\nThe  Project  addresses  social  exclusion  issues  that  when  resolved,  will  bring  non-\n109.\nquantifiable  benefits  to  the  rural  communities  and  the  poor.  The  community-based  planning\nmechanisms to  be  introduced under  part A will involve democratic practices and processes to\nanchor  decision  making  over  what  and  how  resources  would  be  used  for  communal  benefit.\nParticipants will be elected by villagers and proposals for the village development plans will be\nconsidered and approved by elected representatives (village-level and community-level), in an\nintervillage  forum.  These  mechanisms  are  key  to  instituting  good  governance  practices  in  the\ncommunity  development  process.  In  that  respect,  the  Project  will  help  effect  the  democratic\nunderpinnings  of  decentralized  government  as  promulgated  by  the  two  decentralization  laws.\nThe  trainees  will  include  government  officials  in  the  subdistricts  and  districts  where  these\nprocesses  currently  are  weakest.  The  Project  is  envisaged  to  strengthen  the  village\ncommunities\u2019  ability  to  articulate  and  lobby  for  support  for  their  development  plans  as  well  as\ntheir  respective  district  governments\u2019  ability  to  respond  to  their  demands.  As  the  Project  will\ntarget  poor  villages,  this  capacity-building  process  will  directly  benefit  the  poor  by  providing\nthem  a  means  to  draw  the  attention  of  local  government  and  resources  to  their  development\nneeds.  Furthermore,  the  Project  criteria  that  women  be  adequately  represented  in  the\ninstitutions  and  training  activities  to  be  sponsored  will  mean  that  women  as  well  as  men\nparticipate in and benefit from the process.\n\n\f35\n\nIncreased  opportunities  for  diploma  and  degree  training  under  the  human  resource\n110.\ndevelopment  subcomponent  will  widen  the  base  of  trained  local  government  workers.  About\n1,634  staff  in  subdistricts  and  districts  will  be  trained  for  a  three-year  diploma  or  a  four-year\nbachelor\u2019s  degree  under  the  Project.  This  should  improve  their  capability  for  community\ndevelopment  work,  with  subsequent  positive  impacts  on  their  morale  and  productivity.  For\nanother 139 senior officials who would receive postgraduate training locally and overseas, the\nopportunity to attend universities will widen their experience and provide new insights into how\ndevelopment  planning  is  carried  out  in  Indonesia  and  in  the  region.  It  will  also  allow  them  to\nlearn from the experiences of others.\n\n111.\nThe  formation  of  community  members  into  CBSLOs,  together  with  associated  training\nand support, will empower them by ensuring their representation and participation in sustainable\nvillage development and resource management activities. Membership in the CBSLOs will also\n(i) improve access of the participants to financial services for livelihood or supplemental income-\ngenerating activities; (ii) strengthen their income-earning capacities; and (iii) equip them with the\nnecessary  skills  in  small  enterprise  management  and  entrepreneurship  in  a  wider  variety  of\noccupations, thus widening their financial options. The heightened awareness of women of their\nimportant role in the success of project initiatives, the enhancement of their skills for livelihood\ndevelopment  activities  and  credit  and  savings  mobilization,  and  their  empowerment  for\ncommunity  leadership  and  resource  management  activities  are  anticipated  to  be  important\nproject  achievements.  Similarly,  for  both  men  and  women,  improvement  in  confidence  and\nmorale with direct participation in both planning and implementing village plans and the Project\ncan produce lasting change.\n\nThe provision of basic social infrastructure facilities (e.g., potable water supply, drainage,\n112.\nand community halls) will improve the general health of the community residents as a result of\nbetter  personal  hygiene  and  sanitation.  Most  of  all,  investments  in  rural  roads  will  open\nopportunities for poor people in villages to market their produce at better prices and to access\nproducts  and  services.  Probably  no  other  single  form  of  investment  creates  the  same  level  of\nnonquantifiable  benefits  as  small  rural  roads  connecting  villages  to  the  major  transport  and\ncommunication systems.\n\nE. \n\nRisks\n\n113.\nIf  implemented  as  planned,  decentralization  of  administrative  and  financial  functions  is\nexpected  to  improve  project  implementation  in  line  with  the  envisaged  improvement  in  the\nefficiency  of  delivery  of  public  services.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  assist  in  the  general\ndemocratization  process  through  the  capacity-building  program  under  part  A  of  the  Project,\nwhich is the essential adjunct to decentralization. Increasing participation by ordinary (including\npoor)  people  in  the  decision-making  process  and  the  corresponding  pressure  from  them  for\ntransparency will greatly assist in combating the dangers from malfeasance and corruption.\n\n114.\nThe  prevailing  ambiguity  about  the  precise  nature  of  the  division  of  administrative  and\nfinancial  responsibilities  between  different  levels  of  government  for  implementing  rural\ndevelopment  programs  poses  two  types  of  risk  in  project  implementation.  First,  would  the\nCentral  Government  leave  the  entire  counterpart  financial  responsibility  for  implementing  the\nProject  on  the  participating  province  or  districts?  Second,  given  the  ensuing  changes  in  the\nsystem of fiscal transfers from the Central to the regional governments, including the channeling\nof  external  assistance,  would  the  participating  provinces  and  districts  be  expected  to  shoulder\nthe financial burden of servicing and repaying the ADB loans for the Project? The Government\nhas  provided  assurances  that  limit  the  uncertainties  in  the  financial  and  institutional\narrangements for project implementation that may arise from the division of administrative and\n\n\f36\n\nfinancial  responsibilities  between  different  levels  of  government.  The  Government  assured  the\nADB Appraisal Mission that such changes are internal to the Government and that the Central\nGovernment  as \nfinancial\ncommitment to the Project.\n\nthe  Borrower  would  remain  responsible \n\nthe  counterpart \n\nfor \n\n115. As  with  most  projects,  the  timely  availability  of  counterpart  funds  will  be  necessary  for\nsuccess  as  well  as  the  availability  of  counterpart  personnel  at  national,  provincial,  and  district\nlevels.  The  Government\u2019s  continued  commitment  to  improving  the  capacity  of  regional\ngovernments  and  to  poverty  reduction  should  ensure  that  the  necessary  resources  are\nforthcoming.  The  Government  has  agreed  that  annual  budgets  will  be  provided  to  the  Project\nthrough  special  allocations  to  ensure  timeliness  of  funds  needed  for  implementation,  and  an\nexpanded  formal  education  program  will  widen  the  base  of  trained  local  workers  at  subdistrict\nand  district  levels,  thus  addressing  the  concerns  about  availability  and  quality  of  counterpart\nstaff.\n\n116. Within  the  Project  itself,  there  will  always  be  risks  associated  with  investment  in\nmicroenterprises  even  though  their  finances  appear  reasonably  robust.  Much  also  will  depend\non the organization and capacity of the CBSLOs and especially on the commitment of CBSLO\nmembers. For this reason, the Project has provided for NGO facilitators, most of whom will be\ndrawn  from  NGOs  in  the  area  concerned,  including  existing  credit  unions  where  available,  to\nprovide  in-depth  contact  and  discussion  encouraging  prospective  beneficiaries  to  actively\nparticipate in CBSLO formation. The Mission at appraisal had assessed that suitable NGOs and\nNGO facilitators are available in the project area.\n\nThe  financial  and  economic  risks  associated  with  microenterprise  development  are\n117.\ninevitably  present,  but  the  financial  and  economic  analyses  indicate  a  reasonable  degree  of\nrobustness.\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n118.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents.\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\n119.\n\nThe Government will ensure that\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nnecessary  annual  amounts  will  be  provided  to  the  Project  through  special\nallocations  to  the  PMO,  the  PCOs  and  the  PIUs,  except  for  the  funds  for  the\ncredit component, which the Government will relend to the BPDs under separate\nsubsidiary loan agreements;

The  rural  infrastructure,  in  most\ncases, will be for the common good. It will link a village to nearby villages and connect all to the\ngrowth  centers.    The  various  infrastructure  subprojects  will  be  selected  using  a  participatory\napproach that considers the needs of the villages or the common good of a cluster of villages.\n\nB. \n\nTypes of Infrastructure Subprojects\n\n2.\n\nThe Mission considers three types of infrastructure subprojects relevant to the Project:\n\nType I\n\nType II\n\nType III\n\nRehabilitate access roads\nVillage markets\nVillage offices\nSea walls\nMedium-size warehouses\n\nNew roads\nBridges/box culverts\nJetties\nDeep tubewells for\n    water supply1\nLarge warehouses\nElectric distribution \n    lines to national electric\n    company (PLN)\nFish auction markets\n \n\nPathways\nDrying floors\nStorage sheds\nPump houses\nCommunity latrines\nVillage drains\nMeeting halls\nBus shelters\nVillage roads\nTerracing\nShallow wells\nCulverts\nWater distribution pipes\n\n3.\n\nThe types of rural infrastructure and actual construction procedures are as follows:\n\nType  I.  Contracted  works  using  only  district  licensed  construction  contractors  who  will\n4.\nsupply  the  heavy  equipment,  expertise,  and  materials  required.    However,  the  contractor  will\nengage a large complement of village labor from the villages concerned.  Type I subprojects are\nrelatively complex and will require the services of the district public works offices in association\nwith  the  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  for  investigations,  survey,  design,  and  technical\nspecifications. District-level public works officers will assist the PIUs in awarding contracts and\nsupervising  the  work.  Type  I  civil  works  are  expected  to  cost  about  $100,000-$250,000  using\nlocal competitive bidding (LCB) procedures and local labor, except for the 11 core subprojects\nestimated to cost $500,000 or less.\n\n5.\nType  II.  Contracted  works  using  prequalified  licensed  construction  contractors  who  will\nsupply  the  heavy  equipment  and  expertise.  However,  only  village  labor  for  the  villages\nconcerned will be employed.  Materials will be purchased by the PIU and supplied directly to the\nvillages concerned.  Type II subprojects are moderately complex and will require the services of\nthe district public works offices for design and technical specifications, and to assist the PIUs in\nawarding  contracts  and  supervising  the  work.  They  cost  about  $50,000-$100,000  using  LCB\nprocedures and local labor.\n\n                                                \n1 These deepwells will provide drinking water to several villages. Deep tubewells for irrigation or other enterprises will\n\nbe conducted through the credit program with Bank Pembangunan Daerah (regional development bank).\n\n\f44045\n\nAppendix 3, page 2\n\n6.\nType  III.  These  are  simple,  selp-help  projects  and  will  use  only  village  labor  under  the\ncontrol  of  a  construction  supervisor.  The  PIUs  will  directly  supply  materials  to  the  villages\nconcerned.  Laborers and supervisors will be paid for their labor at a lower labor scale, i.e., 70\npercent  of  the  average  subdistrict  labor  rate.    Thus,  villagers  will  have  a  minimum  30  percent\nstakeholders equity in the civil works.  The works will be contracted, through a memorandum of\nagreement between the PIUs and the village, most probably as a lump sum contract or possibly\na  daily  rate  contract.  The  village  laborers  will  be  paid  by  the  village  organization  with  funds\nprovided by the PIU and monitored by PIU staff.  Type III civil works are expected to cost less\nthan $50,000.\n\n7.\n\nIn all three types of subprojects, the affected villagers will be the primary source of labor.\n\nC. \n\nSelection Criteria for Rural Infrastructure Subprojects\n\nAppropriate  rural  infrastructure  subprojects  at  the  village  level  will  be  selected  on  the\n\n8.\nfollowing criteria:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\nThe subproject is located in a project subdistrict.\nA new community planning organization has been established and is functioning\nin the participating village.\nThe subproject is for the common good of the participating villages.\nThe  subproject  is  on  the  priority  list  of  work  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  and\ncommerce  in  the  participating  villages  and  is  connected  to  the  development  of\nnearby villages with commercial links to urban growth centers.\nFor type I and type II subprojects, the PIU and affected villages will enter into a\nmemorandum  of  agreement  defining  the  responsibilities  of  all  parties,  including\npublic works offices and others.\nFor  type  III  subprojects,  the  PIU  and  the  villagers  will  enter  into  a  similar\nmemorandum of agreement.\nThe  infrastructure  will  serve  more  than  one  village  and  link,  in  some  way,  rural\nurban commercial centers.\nInvestigations,  surveys,  designs,  drawings,  technical  specifications,  and  cost\nestimates can be prepared in about three months and approved by the PIU and\nvillage organizations concerned.\nConcerned  government  agencies,  district  planning  agency  and  district  public\nworks office, have been consulted and have agreed to the intervention.\nPrior  to  starting  construction,  rural  infrastructure  engineers  are  engaged  at  the\ndistrict  level  and  nongovernment  organization  construction  specialists  are\nengaged to supervise the works.\nType I subprojects should range in cost between $100,000 and $250,000; type II\nsubprojects,  about  $50,000-$100,000;  and  type  III  subprojects,  less  than\n$50,000.\nThe  concerned  village  organization  enters  into  an  operations  and  maintenance\nmemorandum of agreement with the PIU.  Materials will be provided by the PIU\nand the villages will provide labor, free of charge on a self-help basis.\n\n(xiii)  Subprojects  with  potentially  adverse  environmental  impacts,  as  determined  by\nan initial environmental examination, and which cannot be easily mitigated will be\nexcluded from the Project.\n\n\f44046\n\nAppendix 3, page 3\n\nD. \n\nSelection of 11 Core Subprojects in 11 Districts\n\n9.\nEleven districts in the six provinces will select 11 core subprojects to start implementing\nthe Project in the first two years.  The subprojects will aim to assist commercial activities, as well\nas  improve  the  lives  of  the  people  in  the  villages  concerned,  and  should  be  aimed  for  the\ncommon  good.  The  core  subprojects  are  expected  to  include  rehabilitation  of  road  links  and\nconstruction of bridges/box culverts on those road links so as to move commerce and improve\ntransportation  links  for  general  purposes.  The  roads  will  serve  several  villages  and  be\nconnected  to  the  commercial  areas  of  growth  centers.    The  maximum  length  of  road  will  be\nabout  2-3  kilometers  and  will  include  2-3  drainage  crossings  (bridges  or  box  culverts).  Each\nsubproject is expected to cost $500,000 or less.\n\n\f44047\n\nAppendix 4, page 1\n\nCOST ESTIMATES\n\nTable A4.1:  Project Cost Summary, by Component\n($'000)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\n\n%\nForeign\n\n% Total\nBase\nExchange Costs\n\n      Component\n\nA.

CBSLOs  will  be  formed  in  each  participating  village  to\nmobilize savings, provide financial services among the members, and manage small loans for\nenterprise  development.  The  six  BPDs  are  BPD  Central  Kalimantan,  BPD  East  Kalimantan,\nBPD  South  Kalimantan,  BPD  Central  Sulawesi,  BPD  North  Sulawesi,  and  BPD  Southeast\nSulawesi.\n\n2.\nThe BPDs are owned by the provincial and local governments. They were established in\n1961-1965  to  promote  regional  development,  increase  regional  income  sources,  and  help\ndevelop rural financial institutions. In 1967, an act allowed the BPDs to accept demand deposit,\ngrant  short-term  loans,  and  participate  in  equity  investments,  thereby  expanding  their  powers\nand enabling them to compete with regular commercial banks. The BPDs have headquarters in\nthe  provincial  capital,  and  branches  in  the  districts.  Not  all  BPDs  have  branches  in  the\nsubdistrict.  BPD  South  Kalimantan  has  a  strong  background  in  microfinance  gained  from  the\nADB\u2019s  Microfinance  Project;  the  five  other  BPDs  have  been  involved  in  Government-funded\nmicrofinance schemes.\n\nB. \n\nPerformance of the Six BPDs\n\n1. \n\nFinancial Indicators\n\n3.\nThe assets of the six BPDs increased by 15.8 percent annually during the last five years.\nTheir combined total assets amounted to Rp1,582.4 billion ($226 million equivalent) at the end\nof  1999.  The  growth  in  assets  is  attributed  to  the  BPDs\u2019  profitable  operation  as  well  as  to\nadditional capital infusion to one BPD from the owners.\n\n4.\nIn terms of profitability, all six BPD performed well during the past five years, except for\nBPD  North  Sulawesi,  which  barely  made  a  profit  and  did  not  meet  the  acceptable  return  on\nequity (ROE) for three years. As a result, BPD North Sulawesi was recapitalized and underwent\nmajor  structural  changes  in  1999.  Its  profitability  slightly  improved  by  the  end  of  1999  when  it\nposted a 9 percent ROE. The total assets, total equity, and net income after tax of the six BPDs\nfrom 1995 to 1999 are in Table A6.1.\n\n5.\nCombined  with  the  growth  in  assets,  the  six  BPDs  have  increased  their  interbank\nplacements and reduced their loans receivable. On the average, the six BPDs loan portfolio is\nonly 34 percent of their total productive assets. A substantial portion of their productive assets is\nin  interbank  placements  rather  than  in  loans  receivable.  Interbank  placements  are  temporary\ninvestments  and  are  also  a  liquidity  buffer.  Because  of  the  financial  crisis  in  1997,  it  was\nrelatively  safer  to  put  money  in  other  banks  than  to  extend  loans.  However,  the  demand  for\nloans  is  expected  to  increase  and  so  the  loan  portfolio  is  also  expected  to  grow,  as  the\nIndonesian  economy  recovers  from  the  shock  of  1997  and  interest  rates  continue  on  a\ndowntrend.  Table  A6.2  shows  the  distribution  of  the  productive  assets  of  the  six  BPDs  by  the\nend of 1999.\n\nIn terms of growth, the combined loan portfolio of the six BPDs increased in 1996 and\n6.\n1997,  but  contracted  by  3.9  percent  in  1998,  compared  with  the  1995  level.  Only  BPD  South\nKalimantan and BPD Southeast Sulawesi were able to significantly increase their loan portfolio.\nAll six BPDs were affected by the financial crisis and experienced collection problems. During\nthe crisis, lending activities slowed down but lending showed signs of picking up in 1999. Table\nA6.3 shows the loan portfolio of six BPDs during the last five years.\n\n\f44053\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\nTable A6.1: Financial Indicators for Six BPDs\n(Rp million)\n\n   Item\n\n                 1995\n\n            1996\n\n           1997\n\n         1998\n\n          1999\n\n879,901\n\n306,619\n\n119,033\n\n146,566\n\n215,010\n\n52,969\n\n39,704\n\n111,186\n\n16,833\n\n42,345\n\n20,414\n\n19,541\n\n1,121\n\n2,932\n\n21,125\n\n3,253\n\n7,706\n\n3,350\n\n2,064\n\n4,142\n\n610\n\n950,868\n\n287,035\n\n153,806\n\n176,135\n\n204,887\n\n83,521\n\n45,484\n\n120,560\n\n20,502\n\n43,958\n\n21,962\n\n18,121\n\n12,216\n\n3,801\n\n19,576\n\n3,831\n\n6,231\n\n3,427\n\n2,864\n\n2,256\n\n967\n\n1,003,615\n\n1,313,340\n\n1,582,458\n\n308,968\n\n194,234\n\n188,985\n\n184,437\n\n87,516\n\n39,475\n\n141,581\n\n31,571\n\n51,472\n\n22,118\n\n19,047\n\n13,708\n\n3,665\n\n21,228\n\n6,646\n\n6,586\n\n2,460\n\n3,150\n\n1,916\n\n470\n\n350,590\n\n269,040\n\n256,620\n\n261,056\n\n125,725\n\n50,309\n\n195,703\n\n63,120\n\n49,430\n\n26,706\n\n29,971\n\n19,008\n\n7,468\n\n49,126\n\n25,015\n\n6,246\n\n6,060\n\n7,349\n\n2,027\n\n2,429\n\n491,343\n\n349,960\n\n298,839\n\n274,119\n\n121,552\n\n46,645\n\n266,169\n\n78,419\n\n70,661\n\n29,732\n\n55,802\n\n21,769\n\n9,786\n\n65,721\n\n23,597\n\n23,346\n\n5,278\n\n7,782\n\n3,878\n\n1,840\n\nTotal Assets\n\nEast Kalimantan\n\nSouth Kalimantan\n\nCentral Kalimantan\n\nNorth Sulawesi\n\nSoutheast Sulawesi\n\nCentral Sulawesi\n\nEquity\n\nSouth Kalimantan\n\nEast Kalimantan\n\nCentral Kalimantan\n\nNorth Sulawesi\n\nSoutheast Sulawesi\n\nCentral Sulawesi\n\nNet Income After Tax\n\nSouth Kalimantan\n\nEast Kalimantan\n\nCentral Kalimantan\n\nSoutheast Sulawesi\n\nNorth Sulawesi\n\nCentral Sulawesi\n\nNet  Income to Average\n\nTotal Assets (%)\n\nNet  Income to Average\n\nEquity (%)\n\nAverage Compounded Growth Rate of Total Assets\n\nAverage Compounded Growth Rate of  Total Equity\n\n15.8 % per annum\n\n24.4% per annum\n\n4.8\n\n38\n\n2.1\n\n16.9\n\n2.2\n\n16.2\n\n4.2\n\n29.1\n\n4.5\n\n28.5\n\nTable A6.2: Productive Assets of the Six BPDs\nas of 31 December 1999\n(Rp million)\n\n   BPDa\n\nPlacements\n\nReceivable\n\n& Bonds\n\nTotal\n\n       Percent\n\nNet Interbank\n\nLoans\n\nInvestments\n\nTotal\nEast Kalimantan\nSouth Kalimantan\nCentral Kalimantan\nNorth Sulawesi\nSoutheast Sulawesi\nCentral Sulawesi\na  Regional development bank.\n\n825,658\n164,597\n177,508\n328,012\n82,023\n27,907\n45,611\n\n439,809\n72,874\n96,172\n94,787\n101,468\n14,936\n59,572\n\n2. \n\nDeposit Generation\n\n21,765\n666\n1,216\n485\n19,064\n-\n334\n\n1,287,232         34\n\n238,137         30.6\n274,896         35\n423,284         22.4\n202,555         50.1\n42,843         34.9\n105,517         56.5\n\nThe  ability  of  the  BPDs  to  sustain  or  generate  deposits  from  the  public  reflects  public\n7.\nconfidence  in  the  banks.

The Bank requires all BPDs to make proper provisions for possible\nlosses  from  their  productive  assets  so  that  their  financial  statements  will  reflect  their  true\nfinancial condition.\n\n9.\nThe  Mission\u2019s  analysis  of  the  quality  of  assets  of  the  BPDs  indicates  a  rating  ranging\nfrom satisfactory to excellent, except for BPD Central Sulawesi which scored poorly because of\nits  large  nonperforming  loan  portfolio  \u2014  equivalent  to  more  than  half  of  its  Rp15  billion  loan\naccounts by the end of 1999. BPD Central Sulawesi informed the Mission that it has not written\noff  these  accounts  because  of  the  ongoing  efforts  to  collect  on  them  or  to  foreclose  them.\nHowever, in computing the PAR, these past due loans are treated as lost for conservatism. The\nrating of the BPDs in terms of productive assets ratio is shown in Table A6.5.\n\nTable A6.5: Productive Assets Ratioa\n(percent)\n\n    BPDb\n\n    1999\n\n    1998\n\n    1997\n\n       1996\n\n       1995\n\nCentral Kalimantan\nSouth Kalimantan\nEast Kalimantan\nNorth Sulawesi\nCentral Sulawesi\nSoutheast Sulawesi\na Good:   0 \u2013 4.0%,  satisfactory:   4.1% \u2013 6.0%,  less than satisfactory:   6.1% \u2013 8.0%,  poor:   8.1% up.\nb  Regional development bank.\n\n3.8\n2.1\n6.3\n2.6\n18.9\n3.2\n\n8.1\n2.3\n12.4\n14.9\n19.0\n4.6\n\n10.1\n1.9\n6.7\n21.2\n14.8\n4.0\n\n7.5\n1.6\n6.4\n19.4\n11.2\n2.7\n\n4.4\n2.1\n4.9\n4.7\n8.4\n2.8\n\n\f44055\n\nAppendix 6, page 4\n\nC. \n\nMission\u2019s Assessment of the Financial Conditions of Six BPDs\n\n1. \n\nCAMEL Rating\n\n10.\nThe Mission used the CAMEL instrument in assessing the financial conditions of the six\nBPDs because it reconciles the short-term and long-term measures of performance. CAMEL is\nthe  acronym  for  capital  adequacy,  asset  quality,  management,  earnings  history,  and  liquidity\nmanagement.  CAMEL  was  created  in  1979  to  enable  North  American  bank  regulators  to\nmeasure the financial and management soundness of US commercial lending institutions, using\nkey ratios, indicators, and institutional policies and procedures.\n\n11.\nThe average CAMEL scores of the six BPDs for 1995-1999 indicate that they were either\nin  good  or  satisfactory  financial  condition,  except  for  BPD  Central  Sulawesi,  which  obtained  a\n\u201cless  than  satisfactory\u201d  rating  (Tables  A6.6  and  A6.7).  The  main  reason  for  this  rating  was  its\nhigh  ratio  of  nonperforming  loans  (para.  21).  In  1999,  BPD  North  Sulawesi  was  recapitalized\nand  underwent  structural  changes.  As  a  result,  it  obtained  a  \u201csatisfactory\u201d  rating  at  the  end  of\n1999.\n\nTable A6.6: Five-Year Average CAMEL Rating of Six Regional Development Banks\n(1995-1999)\n\n \n\n  Central\n\nSouth\n\nEast\n\nNorth\n\nCentral\n\nSoutheast\n\n4.0\n2.1\n2.1\n3.8\n3.3\n\nKalimantan Kalimantan Kalimantan Sulawesi\n\n   Criterion\n Capital Adequacy\n Asset Quality\n Management a\n Earnings\n Liquidity\n Overall Rating Based on\n  Weighted Criteria b\n2.5\na The ratings for six BPDs are based on Mission\u2019s estimates of BPD management for 1999.\nb Good: 3.2-4.0, Satisfactory: 2.6 - less than 3.2, Less than satisfactory: 2.2 -  less than 2.6, Poor: 0- less than\n  2.2.\nSource: Mission estimates based on BPD data.\n\nSulawesi\n4.0\n1.0\n2.2\n3.9\n3.0\n\nSulawesi\n4.0\n3.4\n3.1\n4.0\n3.4\n\n4.0\n1.9\n2.8\n4.0\n3.3\n\n4.0\n3.7\n3.1\n4.0\n3.0\n\n3.4\n1.8\n2.7\n2.8\n3.7\n\n3.6\n\n2.7\n\n3.6\n\n3.0\n\n2.9\n\n12.\nA comparison of the CAMEL rating by Bank Indonesia covering the six BPDs in March\n2000 and the Mission estimates based on BPD data in June 2000 during appraisal are in Table\nA6.7.

The  results  indicate  that  BPD  Central  Sulawesi  will  continue  to  be  a\nviable  bank.  With  more  persistent,  regular,  and  determined  effort  to  collect  loan  accounts,  its\nfinancial position can be significantly improved.\n\n4.\n\nEffect of Proposed Relending by MOF to Six BPDs\n\nThe respective capital1 of all the six BPDs will remain adequate even after disbursement\n15.\nof  the  entire  $2.5  million  MOF  credit  loan  to  each  BPD.  Among  the  six  BPDs,  BPD  Central\nSulawesi has the smallest capital at Rp9.8 billion ($1.4 million). Its capital adequacy ratio, which\nstood  at  38  percent  at  the  end  of  1999,  would  have  increased  to  41  percent  by  year  2001\nwithout  the  MOF  credit  loan.  With  the  $2.5  million  loan,  its  capital  adequacy  ratio  can  still  be\nmaintained within the 34-38 percent level, which is considered more than sufficient. Its loan-to-\ndeposit ratio will increase from 43 percent to 104 percent, which is within acceptable standards,\nafter it has onlent the funds to the project CBSLOs.\n\nD.\n\nBank Indonesia\u2019s Assessment of the Six BPDs\n\nBank  Indonesia  assessment  of  the  six  BPDs  in  March  2000  indicates  that  all  are\n16.\nfinancially sound. However, BPD Central Sulawesi received a rating of \u201cless than satisfactory\u201d\nmainly because of its high ratio of nonperforming loans. This BPD continues to operate normally\nand accept deposits from the public.\n\n17.\nThe  Mission  was  informed  that,  considering  the  above  rating,  Bank  Indonesia  had\nconducted a \u201cfit and proper test\u201d of senior officers and operational procedures of BPD Central\nSulawesi.  The  result  of  the  test  gave  BPD  Central  Sulawesi  a  passing  mark.  Bank  Indonesia\nand BPD Central Sulawesi have agreed on measures to reduce the amount of nonperforming\nloans in one year to improve the BPD\u2019s Bank Indonesia classification.\n\nE. \n\nFinancial Projections for BPDs\n\n18.\nThe  Mission  examined  the  future  financial  viability  of  the  six  BPDs  based  on  CAMEL\nrating for 2001\u20132006. The assumptions used common to all the BPDs are summarized in Table\nA6.8.  The  BPDs  were  assumed  to  maintain  a  cash  balance  equivalent  to  1  month  operating\nexpenses plus 5 percent of demand liabilities. Excess funds were assumed to be placed in other\nbanks as call loans or plain deposits.\n\nBased on historical data for each BPD as well as in the aggregate, the Mission projected\n19.\nthe growth rates of the loan portfolio as well as the demand liabilities of the BPDs. BPD Central\nSulawesi  was  able  to  increase  its  loan  portfolio  by  36.3  percent  in  1996,  but  posted  negative\ngrowth rates in 1997 and 1998 due to the Asian financial crisis. It posted a 3 percent growth rate\nin 1999. Assuming economic recovery in Central Sulawesi Province, the BPD may be capable\nof  duplicating  the  36  percent  growth  rate  of  its  loan  portfolio  in  1996.  However,  using\nconservative  projections,  the  Mission  assumed  a  gradual  increase  of  10  percent  in  2000,  15\npercent in 2001, 20 percent in 2002, and increases of 2 percent thereafter.\n\n                                                \n1 Including retained earnings.\n\n\f44057\n\nAppendix 6, page 6\n\nTable A6.8: Assumptions Common to All BPDs\n\nItem\nInterest Income\n     Lending Interest Rate\n     Average Interest Rate on Net Interbank Balances\n     Administrative Charges on Loan Processing and other Recurring\n         Income Expressed as a Percent of Interest Income\nInterest Expense\n     Demand Deposits\n     Savings Deposits\n     Time Deposits\n     CERD Loana\nDeposit with Bank Indonesia as a Percent of Deposit Liabilities\na CERD = Community Empowerment for Rural Development.\n\nRate in\nPercent\n\n22\n  8\n\n  2\n\n  0\n  5\n  8\n14\n  5\n\n20.\nFor deposit liabilities, the Mission assumed that the annual growth in demand deposits of\nBPD Central Sulawesi will be 9.6 percent that for savings deposit will be 17.2 percent, and that\nfor  time  deposit,  19.1  percent.  For  the  five  other  BPDs,  the  assumptions  used  to  project  the\ngrowth of its loan portfolio and demand deposits are in Table A6.9.\n\nTable A6.9: Growth Rates of Loan Portfolio and Demand Liabilities\n(2000-2006)\n\n   BPDa\n\n       Loan Portfolio\n\nDemand\nDeposit\n\nAnnual Increase (percent)\nSavings\nDeposit\n\nTime Deposit\n\nCentral Kalimantan\n\nSouth Kalimantan\nEast Kalimantan\nNorth Sulawesi\nCentral Sulawesi\nSoutheast Sulawesi\n\n2000-2003  \u2013  20%  then  decreasing\nby 2% annually\n2000-2006 \u2013 20%\n2000-2006 \u2013 20%\n10, 15, 20, +2% p.a. thereafter\n10, 15, 20, +2% p.a. thereafter\n2000-2006 \u2013 20%\n\n10\n\n20\n10\n10\n\n20\n\n9.6\n\n20\n\n20\n20\n17\n17.2\n15\n\n20\n\n20\n20\n10\n19.1\n20\n\na  Regional development bank.\n\n21.\nThe results indicate that all six BPDs are viable in the long term. BPD Central Sulawesi,\nwhich  received  a  \u201cless  than  satisfactory\u201d  rating  in  1999,  is  projected  to  obtain  a  \u201csatisfactory\u201d\nrating in 2001 and 2002, the latter coinciding with the expected disbursement from the project\ncredit line in 2002.\n\nF. \n\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\n22.\nThe Mission concludes that five of the six BPDs are in reasonable financial condition and\nhave good management in place. In the case of BPD Central Sulawesi, management appears\nto  be  \u201csatisfactory,\u201d  but  an  improvement  in  performance  (reflected  in  the  CAMEL  rating)  will\nneed to take place. The Mission considers all the six BPDs qualified to participate in the Project\nas  Executing  Banks  but  BPD  Central  Sulawesi  must  improve  its  Bank  Indonesia  rating  to\n\u201csatisfactory\u201d before it can borrow credit funds from the Project. This condition is included in the\nLoan Agreement. During project implementation, loan releases from the Project to the six BPDs\nwill also depend on their maintaining a satisfactory rating from Bank Indonesia. Analysis of the\nviability of six BPDs based on financial projections indicates that they are all viable in the long\nterm.

The TA\nwill  help  the  participating  district  governments  to  put  in  place  an  appropriate  financial\nmanagement  system  when \nfor  Rural\nDevelopment  Project  (CERDP).  The  CERDP  aims  to  increase  the  real  incomes  of  the  poor,\nparticularly  the  rural  communities  in  the  peripheral  areas  of  regional  growth  centers.  The\nobjectives of the Project are to (i) empower rural communities by strengthening their capacity to\nplan  and  manage  their  own  development,  and  (ii)  support  investments  and  foster  rural  urban\nlinkages  by  constructing  rural  infrastructure  to  promote  agricultural  productivity  and  off-farm\nbusiness enterprises.\n\nthe  Community  Empowerment \n\nimplement \n\nthey \n\n2.\nLast  year,  as  part  of  the  Government  of  Indonesia\u2019s  ongoing  effort  to  strengthen\ngrassroots  democracy  and  decentralize  the  government  system,  two  laws  (Laws  22  and  25)\nwere  passed  to  give  autonomy  to  local  governments.  The  implementation  of  the  two  laws  will\nrequire  structures  and  administrative  procedures  to  be  put  in  place  at  the  district  and  village\nlevels  to  ensure  proper  transfer  and  use  of  development  and  other  financial  resources.  While\nthe  new  Ministry  of  Regional  Autonomy  (MORA)  has  started  the  process  of  formulating  new\nrules and regulations for transfer of fiscal responsibilities to the local government, the Ministry of\nHome  Affairs  (MOHA)  is  tasked  with  applying  and  simplifying  administrative  rules  and\nregulations  for  local  government.  Implementation  of  the  Project  requires  that  the  new\nadministrative structures be in place before project funds are disbursed, but MOHA will not be\nable  to  fulfill  its  responsibility  as  the  Executing  Agency  as  it  lacks  institutional  capacity.  The\nproposed  TA  will  assist  MOHA  and  the  local  governments  in  six  provinces  targeted  by  the\nProject to develop, pilot, and train relevant staff to set up the required financial monitoring and\nrelated administrative procedures.\n\n3.\nThe  objectives  of  the  TA  are  to  (i)  develop,  test,  and  set  up  the  structure  and\nadministrative procedures for disbursing, monitoring, and accounting for funds for implementing\nthe CERDP; and (ii) train district and village officials on the new financial management system\nfor transparent accounting of project funds. The TA covers (i) developing appropriate structures\nand  administrative  procedures  for  disbursing,  monitoring,  and  accounting  for  funds  under  the\nProject;  (ii)  developing  simple  training  manuals  and  modules  for  use  by  nongovernment\norganization  facilitators  in  training  local  government  officials;  (iii)  developing  and  testing  a\ncomputerized management information system (MIS) combined with monitoring the progress of\nproject  implementation  in  the  day-to-day  management  of  project  activities  and  financial\nmonitoring system for use by CERDP; (iv) conducting training workshops for district and village\nofficials participating in the CERDP in 11 districts in six provinces for one year to disseminate\nthe new financial management system, emphasizing the features that ensure transparency and\naccountability; and (v) preparing a TA completion report.\n\nB. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n4.\nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1.4  million  equivalent,  of  which  $0.5  million  will  be  the\nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $0.9  million  equivalent  the  local  currency  cost.  Of  this  cost,  $1.1\nmillion comprising the foreign exchange costs and $0.6 million equivalent of the local currency\ncosts will be financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), on a grant basis from the Asian\nCurrency  Crisis  Support  Facility,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  grant  financing  of\n\n\f44070\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\n$1.1 million constitutes 80 percent of the total TA cost. The Government will finance $0.3 million\nor 20 percent of the total TA cost, mostly in kind (Table A13).\n\nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n5.\nThe Executing Agency of the TA will be DGRCE. The steering committee for the CERDP\nwill also oversee the implementation of the TA and review the TA reports. DGRCE will provide\ncounterpart staff in areas complementary to those of the consultant team.\n\n6.\nADB will engage the services of a team of consultants and domestic NGO facilitators in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.

As  it  is  difficult  to  quantify  the  benefits  from  the  capacity\nbuilding component under part A of the Project, the economic analysis was carried out for part B\ntaken as a whole. The analysis was based on the economic benefits derived from representative\nmicroenterprises and investment costs on village-level training, consulting services for community\ndevelopment,  domestic  technicians,  community-based  savings  and  loan  organization  (CBSLO)\nformation,  rural  infrastructure  improvement,  rural  infrastructure  operation  and  maintenance,  and\nproject  management.  Costs  in  the  economic  analysis  included  physical  contingencies,  but\nexcluded  price  contingencies,  taxes,  duties,  and  subsidies.  Economic  costs  and  benefits  are\nexpressed in the domestic price numeraire.\n\nB. \n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n1.\n\nRepresentative Microenterprises\n\nTwelve  microenterprise  models  were  identified  and  chosen  as  representative  of  possible\n2.\nlivelihood  projects  that  CBSLO  members  may  engage  in.  The  representative  microenterprises\nincluded: (i) agricultural activities (chicken, vegetable, and cocoa production); (ii) food processing\n(pineapple candy, palm sugar, and kerupuk [crackers]); (iii) handicraft making (furniture, handbag,\nand palm leaf thatching); and (iv) service enterprises (welding shops, stores and restaurants, and\ntransportation services) (Table A14.1). These microenterprises require minimal capital investments\nand are easy to implement, given the limited skills, types of resources available, and low level of\neducation  of  prospective  investors.  The  financial  analysis  covered  six  years,  comprising  an\nestablishment period of one year and an operation period of five years. The financial assessment\nconsisted  of  the  following  calculations:  (i)  investment  cost,  (ii)  working  capital  requirement,  (iii)\nannual  operating  cost,  (iv)  profit  and  loss  forecast,  and  (v)  cash  flow  for  financial  planning.    The\nbenefit-cost ratio (BCR) for each microenterprise was estimated to determine their viability.\n\n3.\nThe  analysis  indicated  that  each  of  the  representative  microenterprises  was  financially\nsound  and  had  a  calculated  BCR  greater  than  one.  A  summary  of  the  investment  and  financial\nmodels for the microenterprises is in para. 95 of the RRP. Return to labor is calculated by dividing\nrevenue less all costs except labor by the amount of labor required.\n\n2.\n\nSwitching Values\n\nAs  the  microenterprises  are  highly  vulnerable  to  significant  changes  in  output  and  input\n4.\nprices, switching values were calculated to determine how much output prices must decrease and\nproduction  costs  must  increase  to  make  the  BCR  equal  to  1.  The  analysis  indicates  that\nagricultural production activities require substantial decreases in output prices (12-25 percent), or\nincreases in production costs (14-36 percent), compared with other types of investment activities to\nmaintain a BCR equal to 1. Food processing and most service enterprises were found to be more\nsensitive  to  changes  in  output  prices  and  production  costs.  The  results  of  the  switching  values\ncalculations are in Table A14.1.\n\n3.\n\nFinancial Analysis of  Microenterprises\n\n5.\nTo determine the net benefits attributed to the microenterprises, an analysis of the with- and\nwithout-project situations was undertaken to provide the basis for estimating the financial internal\nrate of return (FIRR) of the microenterprises as a whole. Under the with-project situation, a total of\n\n\f44072\n\nAppendix 14, page 2\n\n750 community-based savings and loan organizations (CBSLOs) is assumed to be established in\nareas  covered  under  the  Project  over  the  six-year  period  of  analysis.  Correspondingly,  each\nCBSLO was assumed to have at least 50 microenterprise borrowers. It was further assumed that\nmembers will borrow every other year, after having fully repaid their current loan obligations.\n\nTable A14.1: Switching Values Necessary to Generate B-C Ratio = 1.0\n\nDecrease in\nOutput Price (%)\n\nIncrease in\nCosts (%)\n\nDecrease in Output\nPrice and Increase\nin Costs (%)\n\nMicroenterprise\n\nI.

However, the number of borrowers was\nsubstantially reduced to reflect the significantly lesser number of investors qualified to borrow from\nboth  formal  and  informal  credit  sources  due  to  lack  of  creditworthiness.  Discussions  by  the  TA\nconsultants with staff of regional development banks indicated that under without project situation,\nthe  following  proportion  of  borrowers,  relative  to  the  total  borrowers  under  with-project  situation,\nmay  be  assured  for  each  type  of  investment:  (i)  agricultural  activities,  about  20  percent  of  total\nborrowers  assumed  under  the  with-project  situation;  (ii)  food  and  beverage  processing,  about  10\npercent; (iii) handicraft making, 10 percent; and (iv) services, five percent. Based on the calculated\nstreams  of  incremental  benefits  and  investment  costs,  the  FIRR  before  debt  service  for  the\nmicroenterprises is estimated at 45 percent, which adequately covers the 33 percent interest rate\non capital investment. This calculation is made over a six-year period taken as the life cycle for the\nsmall enterprises used as examples.\n\nC.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n7.\n The economic analysis also required a comparison of the Project's economic viability with\nand  without  the  Project,  based  on  estimates  of  (i)  project  investments,  (ii)  incremental  costs\nassociated with the operation and maintenance (O&M) of rural infrastructure, and (iii) incremental\ncosts and benefits associated with microenterprise production activities. The economic evaluation\nwas  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects.  All\ninvestments  in  parts  B  and  C,  together  with  60  percent  of  total  investments  in  part  D,  and  all\ninvestments in part A related to community development, such as consulting services, village-level\ntraining, and facilitators, were included in the analysis. Investment and O&M costs were converted\nto  economic  values  by  a  standard  conversion  factor  (SCF)  of  0.95.  All  costs  were  expressed  in\n2000 constant prices. The economic life of the Project was assumed at 15 years. The project area\nexhibits  significant  unemployment  and  underemployment.  Most  of  the  unemployed  workforce  is\nrelatively unskilled. The opportunity cost of unskilled labor was assumed to be lower than the wage\nrate, with a shadow wage rate of 0.75.\n\n\f44073\n\nAppendix 14, page 3\n\nAs  all  microenterprise  outputs  and  production  inputs  were  assumed  to  be  nontradeable,\n8.\ntheir  corresponding  market  prices,  adjusted  by  an  SCF  of  0.95,  were  used  in  the  economic\nvaluation. The incremental benefit streams derived from the financial analysis of the representative\nmicroenterprises, served as the basis for estimating the incremental economic benefits generated\nby  part  B  of  the  Project.  All  benefits  were  likewise  expressed  in  2000  constant  terms  and  were\nprojected over a 15-year period. The resulting net present value showed that part B is expected to\ngenerate  approximately  Rp250  billion  for  the  economy.  The  Project  is  expected  to  realize  an\neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  about  17  percent.

Switching  values,  indicate  that  the  overall  project  EIRR  is  not\nhighly  sensitive  to  decreases  in  the  prices  of  microenterprise  products  or  to  increases  in  project\ninvestment  costs.  For  the  EIRR  to  fall  to  12  percent,  the  level  assumed  to  be  the  economic\nopportunity  cost  of  capital,  prices  need  to  fall  by  26  percent  while  investment  costs  need  to\nincrease  by  about  35  percent.  Both  price  and  investment  costs  need  to  decrease  and  increase,\nrespectively, by about 15 percent to maintain an EIRR equal to 12 percent.\n\n\f44074\n\nAppendix 15, page 1\n\nINDIGENOUS PEOPLE PLAN\n\n1.\nFor the purposes of the Project's Indigenous People Plan, indigenous people are those who\nmeet the Government definition of \"isolated communities.\" Under Ministerial Decree 5/1994, isolated\ncommunities are described as groups of people who live or wander in dispersed, isolated areas and\nfollow  a  sociocultural  system  which  is  \"isolated\"  and  \"left  behind\"  in  comparison  with  the  rest  of\nIndonesian  society.  \"Isolated\"  is  understood  in  terms  of  both  geography  and  culture,  while  \"left\nbehind\"  is  understood  in  terms  of  such  measures  as  health,  education,  housing,  clothing,  and\nlivelihood.  Some  characteristics  of  isolated  communities,  according  to  the  National  Development\nPlanning  Agency  (BAPPENAS)  are  as  follows:    (i)  a  nomadic  or  seminomadic  lifestyle,  or  living  in\nsmall, dispersed bands; (ii) livelihood system strongly dependent on the natural environment, such\nas hunting, gathering, fishing, or swidden agriculture; (iii) inadequate standards of personal hygiene\nor  cleanliness  of  environment;  (iv)  meager  or  no  clothing;  (v)  low  standard  of  housing;    (vi)  very\nlimited  knowledge  and  low  use  of  technology;  (vii)  belief  system  that  is  animistic;  and  (viii)  strong\nattachment to their cultural and belief systems, which makes them culturally closed.\n\nThese communities or groups also have in common many of the following traits relevant to\n2.\nthe  concept  of  indigenous  people:    \"Priority  in  time  with  respect  to  the  occupation  and  use  of  a\nspecific  territory.  The  voluntary  perpetuation  of  cultural  distinctiveness,  which  may  include  the\naspects of language, social organization, religion and spiritual values, modes of production, laws and\ninstitutions. Self Identification as well as recognition by other groups, or by the State authorities, as a\ndistinct collective group; and an experience of subjugation, dispossession, marginalization, exclusion\nor discrimination, whether or not these conditions persist.\"\n\nThe  Ministry  of  Social  Affairs  is  responsible  for  the  development  of  communities  that  have\n3. \nbeen  classified  as  \u201cisolated  communities,\u201d  through  the  Directorate  General  of  Social  Welfare\nDevelopment under the Directorate for Isolated Communities. Implementation of isolated community\ndevelopment programs under the directorate includes settlement in place of origin, resettlement, and\ncoordination  and  cooperation  of  technical  agencies  to  facilitate  their  accessing  and  mainstreaming\ninto general development activities.  While indigenous people cannot be identified on the basis of an\nofficial list of \"Isolated Communities,\" nor enumerated by reference to official census records, agency\nrecords  can  be  used  to  identify  districts  where  indigenous  people  are  likely  to  be  located.    The\nMission identified seven districts among the nine proposed project districts where the ministry has or\nhad isolated community development in the past, and which are therefore considered to potentially\ncontain  a  concentration  of  indigenous  people.  This  list  will  be  used  to  facilitate  identification  and,\ntherefore, participation and access of indigenous people to benefits from the Project (Table A15).\n\nTable A15: Indigenous People in the Project Area\n\nProject District\n\nIndigenous People\n\nIndigenous Ethnic Groups\n\nKapuas\nBarito Utara\n\nTanah Laut\nBanjar\nBolaan Mengondow\nMinahasa\nPoso\nDongala\nKendari\nX = refers to presence of indigenous people\n\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\n\nDayak Ngaiu Danum, Dayak Naiu\nDayak Dusun Malang, Dayak Taboyan, Dayak\nUt Danum\nDayak Bukit\nDayak Bukit, Dayak Kaharupan\n\nRampi, Wana, Rana\nTolare, Tajio, Pendala, Sajuan, Lanje, Kori\nBajo and Tolaki\n\n\f44075\n\nAppendix 15, page 2\n\n  There  is  a  large  number  of  major  and  minor  groups  in  the  project  area,  that  have  been\n4. \nrecognized by the Ministry of Social Affairs as meeting this requirement, and who have been defined\nby themselves or by outside authorities as indigenous people. These groups have traditionally been\nunable  to  participate  fully  in  development  activities  because  of  problems  associated  with  isolation\nand,  sometimes,  cultural  stereotyping  and  negative  bias  on  the  part  of  the  authorities.  The  direct\ngrant component of the Government IDT program for poverty reduction from 1993 to 1997 provided\nonly  one  of  three  rounds  of  grants  to  villages  with  less  than  100  households.  The  village\ninfrastructure programs being assisted by Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and the\nWorld  Bank  exclude  villages  of  50  households  or  less,  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Kecamatan\nDevelopment Program (KDP) similarly excludes small villages and subdistricts. This serves to limit\nthe  access  of  indigenous  people  to  mainstream  development  activities.    To  avoid  the  problem  of\nexclusion of small villages and indigenous people under the Project, no minimum village size will be\nset. All established villages will be considered as eligible to participate in the Project.\n\n5. \nDuring  implementation,  the  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  at  the  district  level  will  be\nresponsible  for  identifying  subdistricts  containing  indigenous  people  within  its  jurisdiction,  in\nconsultation  with  institutions  and  organizations  responsible  or  directly  associated  with  isolated\ncommunities \u2013 Departments of Social Affairs, Education, Forestry, BAPPEDA, at district levels, and\nmissionary  groups  and  those  working  in  environmental  conservation  projects.  While  selection  of\nvillages remains with the district PIUs, participating districts will be encouraged to include those with\nconcentrations of indigenous people.  Selection and participation of indigenous communities will be\nmonitored.\n\nThe  Project  is  expected  to  bring  positive  benefits  to  indigenous  people  through  access  to\n6. \nmainstream  services  and  improved  governance.  All  participation  is  voluntary,  communities  are  not\nrequired to participate if they do not choose to. The indigenous communities must approve all works,\nand  activities  that  require  resettlement  will  not  be  funded.  The  development  of  capability  for\nparticipatory planning and implementation at both the district and village levels, and implementation\nof participatory monitoring will help ensure that local development planning reflects local interest.  In\naddition to preventing the exclusion of indigenous people on the basis of settlement size, the Project\nwill enable their participation, through the requirement that nongovernment organization facilitators to\nbe engaged under the Project speak the dominant language of the district and priority be given to\ncandidates from the subdistrict of assignment. \n\n7. \n The Project promotes responsive local planning and administration. As a result, in areas with\nlarge populations of indigenous people, the improvement in capability for local planning will permit a\ngreater  voice  for  participation  of  otherwise  marginalized  groups,  and  will  legitimize  social-ethnic\ndiversity by strengthening local institutions.\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 15 September 2000)\n", "Currency Unit\nRp1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013\n=\n=\n", "Rupiah (Rp)\n$0.0001126\nRp8,880\n", "For the purpose of calculations in this report, a rate of Rp8,000 = $1.00 was used.
