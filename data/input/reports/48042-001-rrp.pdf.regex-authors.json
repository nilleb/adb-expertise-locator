THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Panj\u2013Amu River Basin Sector Project.1 The report \nalso describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the European Union \n(EU) for the Panj\u2013Amu River Basin Sector Project. If the Board approves the proposed grant, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant \nto be provided by the EU. \n \n2.  The proposed project will increase agricultural productivity in the Panj\u2013Amu River Basin \nthrough improving access to and use of water at farm, scheme, and river levels.2 It will support \nthe government\u2019s strategy, which aims to increase per capita income and reduce poverty among \nrural and pastoral communities. The project will also improve food security, substitute imports \nfor wheat, improve self-sufficiency, and increase exports of high-value products such as fruit \nand  nuts.  The  project  will  also  create  more  economic  opportunities  for  agribusiness \ndevelopment, particularly for input suppliers and processors of agricultural produce. The project \nis included in the country operations business plan for Afghanistan, 2016\u20132018 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). 3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sector issues. Afghanistan is one of the least developed countries in the world. The \npoverty head count rate is 39% and 33% of the population is food insecure.4 The average gross \ndomestic product per capita during 2011\u20132015 was $634, making Afghanistan to rank 168th out \nof 183 countries reviewed by the World Bank.5 Agriculture is Afghanistan\u2019s major source of \nlivelihood,  employs  79%  of  the  national  workforce,  and  is  a  significant  source  of  national \nincome. Agriculture contributes significantly to Afghanistan\u2019s gross domestic product, although \nthis has decreased from 38% in 2002 to 22% in 2014.6 The country's major staple crop is wheat, \nrepresenting 60% of Afghans\u2019 daily dietary intake. With total production of 5.37 million tons in \n2015, Afghanistan relies on import to meet its requirement with import dependency of 16% of \ntotal food demand and the average 2011\u20132015 level of dependency is growing at 11% per \nannum. Food insecurity is prevalent throughout the country, but most critical in the northern \nprovinces of Badakhshan and Bamyan, where the food insecurity index is as high as 73%.7 \n \n4.  Afghanistan is a dry country with low precipitation as snow falls in winter, while crops \nrequire water in the summer. Limited access to irrigation water is a key constraint to agricultural \nproductivity,  besides  low-quality  inputs  and traditional  agricultural  practices. While the  vast \nmajority of Afghans depend on agriculture for living, only 12% (or 64.4 million hectares [ha]) of \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The EU provided and administered project preparatory technical assistance for the feasibility study for the Panj\u2013\nAmu River Basin Project. \n3  ADB. 2015.

", "2 \nthe country\u2019s terrain is arable. The rain-fed area is currently 3.7 million ha and the irrigated area \nis 3.8 million ha, each representing about 5% to 6% of the total arable land. Of the total irrigated \narea, around 2.2 million ha are single or double cropped, with the balance of 1.6 million ha \nbeing irrigated if and when water is available, at intervals of 2 to 6 years. \n \n5.  Sporadic irrigation has been the primary cause for crop yields below the world average. \nFor example, the average wheat yield was 2 tons/ha in 2013 (world average is 3.27 tons/ha) \nand the average rice yield was 2.5 tons/ha in 2013 (world average is 4.5 tons/ha) (footnote 6). \nIrrigated crop yields are significantly greater than rain-fed yields. For example, the irrigated \nwheat yield is 2.5 times that of rain-fed. With irrigated areas producing 69% of the total wheat \noutput, irrigation water is a  critical high-value factor for yield improvement. While water is \navailable,  improving  access  to  irrigation  on  existing  irrigation  systems  faces  two  critical \nconstraints: (i) the inequitable distribution of water both between and within schemes, and (ii) \nthe dilapidated and inefficient state of irrigation infrastructure. \n \n6.  Climate change impacts. Afghanistan is considered highly vulnerable to the adverse \neffects of climate change.8 Current models indicate significant warming across all regions of the \ncountry and a decrease in precipitation, particularly spring rainfall.9 The anticipated rise in \naverage temperatures may result in higher frequency of floods and droughts. Improving the \nirrigation infrastructure proposed under the project\u2014to protect irrigation schemes from flood \nevents and to improve water distribution to downstream users, particularly in dry years, as well \nas watershed management\u2014will address key climate change adaptation needs identified in the \nIntended  Nationally  Determined  Contribution  submitted  to  the  United  Nations  Framework \nConvention on Climate Change.10 \n \n7.  Panj\u2013Amu Basin overview. The Panj\u2013Amu Basin is located in the northeast of the \ncountry, on the border with Tajikistan, covering the provinces of Badakhshan, Baghlan, Kunduz, \nTakhar, and part of Bamyan. It is part of the Amu River Basin, parts of which lie in Afghanistan \n(30%), Kyrgyzstan (2%), Tajikistan (61%), Turkmenistan (1%), and Uzbekistan (6%). It is the \nsecond-largest of Afghanistan's five basins, covering 14% of the land area of Afghanistan. It has \nthe highest mean annual surface water flow of all basins (22 billion cubic meters or 39% of the \nnational total) and the highest precipitation (393 millimeters/year).11 With a population of 4.2 \nmillion (15% of total), per capita water availability is the highest of all five basins, at 7,412 cubic \nmeters per year, well above the water stress threshold. In spite of this, water is not always \navailable in the right place at the right time (i.e., in the tail ends of canals and in downstream \nschemes in the summer) due to inadequate water distribution structures and water allocation \nregimes. While agriculture is by far the main water user in the basin (over 98% of water use), \nthe basin has the lowest irrigated land area of all basins with 0.45 million ha under irrigation, \naccounting for 12% total 3.80 million ha of irrigated land countrywide. Of this, only 0.18 million \nha is intensively irrigated while the remaining is irrigated only if and when water is available.12 \nThe basin is the largest wheat producer of all basins, with over 1.28 million tons (of which one \nmillion ton in irrigated area) and the largest rice producer with 263,000 tons produced in 2015. \n                                                \n8  Rated as extreme in the Verisk Maplecroft Climate Change Vulnerability Index 2015. \n9  M.

As such, irrigation development is a key factor \nfor  the  basin  to  maintain  its  leading  position  in  the  production  of  staple  food  and  its \ndiversification into higher-value crops. \n \n8.  Opportunities.  Improving  water  availability  for  irrigated  agriculture,  particularly  to \ndownstream  and tail-end  areas through  improved  water  distribution,  will  have  a  significant \nimpact on agricultural productivity, increasing yields of wheat and rice, in particular, which will \nresult in improved food security, reduced poverty, and import substitution (saving scarce foreign \nexchange). Improved water availability will also increase crop diversification into higher-value \ncrops, including vegetables, fruits, and nuts, which make up 52% of total national agricultural \nexports of $720 million. When compared with total imports of $7.96 billion, this is a narrow \nexport base, which can be improved with project interventions. \n \n9.  Government's sector strategy. The strategic framework, approved in 2006,13 guides \nthe water sector operation. The policy indicates that (i) communities are responsible for the \nplanning and management of basin water resources, supported by the Ministry of Energy and \nWater (MEW); (ii) water users\u2019 associations (WUAs) have a key role in rehabilitating small and \nmedium irrigation schemes; and (iii) user-pay principle enables cost recovery. To support this \npolicy, in 2009, a revised water law was enacted, which stipulates that (i) the river basin \nmanagement approach for water resources planning would be followed, led by MEW through \nthe establishment of sub-basin agencies (SBAs) and river basin agencies (RBAs); (ii) service \nproviders (including WUAs) can charge for water delivery; and (iii) ownership and operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of schemes will be handed over to WUAs and irrigation associations. The \nNational Water and Natural Resources Development Program (NWNRDP)14 approved in 2010 \nacts  as  the  government\u2019s  sector  development  plan.  The  key  implementing  agencies  of \nNWNRDP  are  MEW  and  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Livestock,  and  Irrigation  (MAIL).  The \nprogram targets improved irrigation for 300,000 ha; establishing and strengthening SBAs, RBAs, \ncouncils, and WUAs; and restoring 28,000 ha of rangeland through community management. \nThe National Irrigation Program, 2016\u2013202515 builds on the NWNRDP and, with a budget of \n$1.5 billion, aims to achieve self-sufficiency in wheat through (i) improved irrigation services; (ii) \nenhanced extension services; and (iii) improved on-farm water management, operation, and \nmaintenance. \n \n10.  NWNRDP implementation results as of 2015 suggest that the 2006 policy framework \nand the 2009 revised water law are appropriate for sector needs, but can be improved further by \nclarifying  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  MEW  and  MAIL,  and  ensuring  the  long-term \nsustainability of infrastructure through regular maintenance. The proposed project supports this \nthrough the establishment and strengthening of WUAs, and development of O&M policy (para. \n32). NWNRDP results also confirm the adequate institutional capacity of the implementing \nagencies (MEW and MAIL), which are also the implementing agencies of the project. MEW and \nMAIL  have  implemented  a  number  of  sector  projects  of  similar  nature.  The  project  will \nprovide additional capacity building in procurement and financial management, environmental \nimpact assessment, and social analysis in accordance with ADB procedures.  \n \n                                                \n13 Government of Afghanistan. 2006.

The project is consistent with ADB's interim country partnership strategy, 2014\u2013201516 \nwhich supports the government\u2019s strategic priorities. The project is aligned with ADB's water \noperational  plan,  2011\u20132020;17 and  operational  plan  for  agriculture  and  natural  resources, \n2015\u20132020.18 \n \n12.  The project reflects lessons from previous and ongoing development partner-funded \nwater  sector  projects  in  support  of  the  government\u2019s  sector  policies  and  strategies.  Key \ninitiatives include the ADB-financed Water Resources Development Investment Program, 2009\u2013\n2018;  Panj\u2013Amu  River  Basin  Program,  2009\u20132016,  financed  by  the  EU;  Irrigation  and \nWatershed  Management  Program,  2012\u20132017,  financed  by  the  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational  Development;  and  World  Bank-financed  Emergency  Irrigation  Rehabilitation \nProgram, 2004\u20132011; Technical Assistance for Water Sector Capacity Building, 2009\u20132011; \nIrrigation Restoration and Development Project, 2011\u20132017; and On-Farm Water Management \nProject, 2011\u20132016.19 Key lessons call for the need to (i) increase government ownership, (ii) \navoid setting up parallel management structures, (iii) set up realistic implementation plans, (iv)  \nkeep interventions simple yet effective, and (v) embed community-based water management \nwithin schemes for effective water distribution and long-term O&M.20 The project follows the \nfragile and conflict-affected states approach in that it includes (i) sector financing, which allows \nflexibility in subproject selection and implementation given security concerns; (ii) streamlined \nproject management office structure, which helps long-term programmatic sector interventions; \nand (iii) community participation in procurement and involvement of local elders throughout \nsubproject cycles, which minimizes interruptions of works contracts. The project readiness is \nenhanced by the use of advance contracting and financing of taxes and duties on eligible \nproject expenditures.21 \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n13.  The impacts of the project will be aligned with increased per capita income and reduced \npoverty among rural and pastoral communities.22 The outcome will be increased agricultural \nproductivity in the Panj\u2013Amu River Basin. \n \nC.  Outputs \n14.  Output 1: Water allocation and availability improved. This output will include the \nfollowing activities: (i) rehabilitating and upgrading head works and main canals in 21 priority \nirrigation schemes covering estimated total command area of 74,500 ha in the three northern \nprovinces  of  Badakhshan,  Kunduz,  and  Takhar;23 (ii)  establishing  and  strengthening  the \ncapacity of approximately 112 WUAs to operate and maintain conveyance infrastructure in \nthese schemes; 24 and (iii) enhancing the capacity of MEW, RBAs, and SBAs for effective water \nallocation between schemes to benefit downstream users.

This output will include the following activities: \n(i) rehabilitating secondary and tertiary canals in schemes identified for improvement under \noutput 1 to secure an integrated approach; (ii) establishing and strengthening the capacity of \napproximately 105 irrigation associations  to operate and manage irrigation infrastructure in \nthese schemes; and (iii) improving on-farm water management and agronomic techniques (such \nas land leveling, bed and furrow irrigation, and intercropping) with approximately 6,300 farmers \nhaving improved knowledge from 21 demonstration plots. \n \n16.  Output 3: Watersheds properly managed and protected. This output will include the \nfollowing activities: (i) preparing a community-based natural resource management technical \nmanual and guidebook; (ii) training  staff  of the departments of agriculture, irrigation, and \nlivestock (DAILs) as master trainers who will conduct training of communities; (iii) identifying \napproximately 21 watershed and/or rangeland sites for restoration and protection; (iv) creating \ncatchment  management  associations  for  these  sites;  and  (v)  preparing  and  implementing \nnatural resource management plans for these sites. These activities will help restore 10,500 ha \nof forestry and/or rangeland in the vicinity of 21 prioritized schemes and protect irrigation \nstructures under outputs 1 and 2 from flash floods and sedimentation.  \n \n17.  Using an integrated approach on each of the 21 priority schemes, MEW will undertake \nthe rehabilitation of headworks and main canals while MAIL will undertake the rehabilitation of \nsecondary and tertiary canals, on-farm work, and watershed protection in the vicinity of the \nschemes. The project will provide technical resources to implementing agencies to ensure \nproper irrigation management and transfer (IMT). Specifically, the project will assist the drafting, \nnegotiation, and conclusion of pre-construction O&M agreements and hand-over and/or IMT \nagreements between SBAs and WUAs (output 1), between DAILs and irrigation associations \n(output 2), and between DAILs and catchment management associations (output 3). \n \nD.

Manila. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n21.  The project is designed to ensure long-term sustainability. To make infrastructure last its \neconomic life, a number of design measures are included in the project. First, gated headworks \nwill  protect  other  infrastructure  in  schemes  by  reducing  flood  damage  from  future  climate \nchange and variability. Second, for headworks and main canals, O&M will be delegated to \nWUAs and, where such works are outside WUAs\u2019 scope, SBAs will be responsible for O&M. \nThird,  for  secondary  and  tertiary  canal  infrastructure,  O&M  will  be  delegated  to  irrigation \nassociations.27 Fourth, watersheds adjacent to schemes will be rehabilitated and protected, \nreducing runoff, thus decreasing siltation of irrigation canals and lowering the risk of damage to \ninfrastructure by flash flooding. Fifth, improved water distribution within and between schemes \nwill be ensured through the better functioning of WUAs and irrigation associations for equitable \nwater distribution within schemes (particularly middle and tail reaches receiving fair shares). The \nRBAs and SBAs working with the WUAs will ensure that water is distributed fairly between \nschemes. In so doing, downstream schemes will also experience benefits even if they receive \nno direct project investment. Finally, training farmers on improved on-farm water management \nand agronomic techniques (such as land leveling, bed and furrow irrigation, and intercropping) \nwill  also  help  leverage  infrastructure  investment  by  ensuring  that  irrigation  water  is  used \nefficiently.   \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n22.  The project will benefit approximately 55,000 farming households (over 400,000 people). \nProject benefits are multifaceted. First, farm household income is expected to increase as a \nresult of increased cropping intensities, higher crop yields, and crop diversification. The analysis \nof three representative subprojects indicates that incremental household incomes will have an \naverage increase of $123 (for head reach) and $615 (for tail reach) per annum. Second, \nincremental crop labor will create an equivalent of 8,994 full-time rural jobs per annum valued at \n$8.7 million, and project construction works are expected to generate an equivalent of 1,700 full-\ntime rural jobs for 6 years with an estimated value of $1.6 million. Most of this labor income \ngoes to local workers drawn from poor households, which may or may not have land within the \nproject command area. Third, more economic opportunities will be created for downstream \n(input  suppliers)  and  upstream  (processors  of  and  market  intermediaries  for  agricultural \nproducts) industries in the agricultural supply chain. \n \n                                                \n27 Irrigation management and transfer to SBAs, WUAs, and irrigation associations will be effected through written \nagreements. \n ", "8 \n23.  The calculated economic internal rates of return for all three representative subprojects \nare greater than the opportunity cost of capital of 12% in both the base case and the sensitivity \ncases; 18% for Laqi, 23% for Sharawan, and 24% for Seyaab. These representative economic \nindicators suggest that, overall, the project is economically viable. However, it is important to \nnote that the rates of returns are highly sensitive to a decrease in project benefits and it is \nimperative that (i) the overall project and subprojects should be implemented as scheduled, (ii) \nagricultural  extension  support  be  financed  under  output  2  in  parallel  with  the  civil  works \nimplementation,  and  (iii)  project  costs  be  utilized  within  the  range  of  estimated  bills  of \nquantities.28 \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  Assessments have identified risks related to the country's public financial management \nsystem  in  the  areas  of  internal  control,  procurement management, financial  reporting,  and \nexternal auditing.29 Action plans have been agreed with MEW and MAIL to strengthen their \nfinancial management and procurement. The project management offices in MEW and MAIL, \nimplementing ongoing ADB- and World Bank-financed projects, have adequate experience and \nwill be able to effectively implement the project once incremental staff are recruited. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to MOF, MEW, and MAIL. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.  Poverty. The project will benefit low-income and marginal smallholders (with household \nlandholding of 1.0\u20132.0 ha). The target provinces have some of the highest food insecurity levels \nin  the  country:  73.0% for  Badakhshan,  34.8% for Takhar,  and  27.5% for  Kunduz.  Project \ninterventions will increase production of wheat by 23,000 tons per year, significantly improving \nthe food security of project beneficiaries. The production of rice will also increase by 25,000 tons \nper year. Incremental household income and jobs created during project implementation will \nsignificantly contribute to local poverty reduction.  \n \n26.   Social  and  gender.    The  project  is  categorized  as  some  gender  benefit.  Gender \nactivities will be mainstreamed in the project. It will directly benefit farmers, including poor \nhouseholds, through increases in agricultural production and farm incomes. More equitable \nwater  distribution  within  and between  schemes  will  reduce  conflict  over  water  and  reduce \nincome inequality. In setting up WUAs and irrigation associations, water users will be briefed on \nthe importance of female participation. Natural resource management plans for watersheds will \nbe prepared with due regard for the role of women related to income-generating activities. \nTraining for women will be conducted by female trainers to ensure willingness to participate. \nThe project will ease women\u2019s water-fetching and laundry chores with water access points \ninstalled along canals. In addition, structures such as offtakes will be adapted as footbridges \nalong the canals to facilitate movement of humans and farm produce.30 \n                                                \n28 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan; and Procurement Capacity Assessment: Ministry of Energy and \nWater; and Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n30 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n27.  Environment (category B). An environmental assessment and review framework and \ninitial environmental examinations for three representative subprojects were disclosed on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite  in  July  2016.  Site-specific  environmental  impacts  may  occur  in  each  of  these \nsubprojects during the construction phase. Adequate mitigation measures are included in and \nwill  be  implemented  through  environmental  management  plans.  ADB  conducted  public \nconsultations  for  the  representative  subprojects  in  February  2016.  The  review  framework \nensures project compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) by specifying the \nenvironmental safeguards procedures required for subprojects prepared during implementation. \nEach  subproject  will  be  screened  for  environmental  classification.  Subprojects  classified \ncategory A will not be financed. Category B subprojects will require an initial environmental \nexamination, including an environmental management plan, and incorporation of environmental \nmanagement plan measures into civil works contracts. Category C subprojects will require \nsummaries of environmental implications in their feasibility studies. Adequate resources have \nbeen  allocated  for  environmental  safeguards  preparation,  implementation,  monitoring,  and \nreporting.31 \n \n28.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Afghanistan is inhabited by ethnic groups across its \n34 provinces. None of these groups are considered indigenous peoples as defined in ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement for operational purposes.  \n \n29.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). A land acquisition and resettlement framework \nfor the entire project has been prepared to guide the preparation of subproject land acquisition \nand resettlement plans (LARPs). Subprojects classified category A will not be financed. Draft \nLARPs for three representative subprojects have been prepared, which will be updated once the \ndetailed designs have been completed. The three draft LARPs confirm that there is no land \nacquisition requirement and no physical displacement. The only resettlement issues are the \nremoval of an estimated 201 trees, mostly non-fruit variety. Right-of-way is a new concept in \nAfghanistan and these trees are apparently grown on the public right-of-way, although privately \nused by the users. The current security situation did not allow for a detailed socioeconomic \nsurvey, but will be carried out for updating the draft LARPs. Appropriate mitigation measures for \ncompensation have been proposed in the entitlement matrix of the LARPs. The land acquisition \nand resettlement framework and the LARPs were disclosed on the ADB website in July 2016.32 \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n31.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand grant agreements. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the grant documents. \n \n32.  Operations and maintenance. The government will ensure that, for structures outside \nthe capacity of community-based O&M, adequate funds are allocated from the government\u2019s \nbudget to finance the O&M activities of SBAs. For community-based O&M, the government will \nensure  that  pre-construction  O&M  agreements  are  signed  before  any  irrigation  civil  works \ncommence, and hand-over and/or IMT agreements are signed before any irrigation civil works \nare commissioned, by and between SBAs and WUAs (for headworks and main canals), by and \nbetween DAILs and irrigation associations (for secondary and tertiary canals), and by and \nbetween  DAILs  and  catchment  management  associations  (for  watershed  protection  and/or \nrestoration), to ensure long-term sustainability. For the sector as a whole, the government will \nensure that O&M and IMT policies\u2014which highlight technical and financial responsibilities and \nstrategies of the government and other stakeholders\u2014are prepared, approved, and issued no \nlater than 30 June 2017.  \n \nV.
