INTRODUCTION \n1.  This is the Compliance Review Panel's (CRP) Report on the eligibility of a request for \ncompliance review filed by the Joint Organization of the Affected Communities (JO), on the \nColombo-Matara Highway under the Southern Transport Development Project (Project).  \n \n2.  CRP registered the request on 6 December 2004. The request is enclosed as Appendix \n1. This report is provided to the ADB Board of Directors, in accordance with paragraph 34 of the \nCRP Operating Procedures.  \n \nII.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT \nA.  Scope \n3.  The Project (Loan No. 1711-SRI) consists of (i) a highway component, linking Colombo \nwith Matara, the district capital of the south and (ii) a road safety component. The Project also \nsupports policy and institutional reform. The primary objectives are to further the economic \ndevelopment of the southern region and to help reduce the high rate of road accidents. The \nProject\u2019s secondary objective is to reduce poverty. \n \n4.  The Project was envisaged in the late 1980s and different traces of the 128 km long road \nwere discussed and studied. The highway will ultimately have four and possibly six lanes, \nalthough it is intended that the initial configuration to be constructed under this Project will be \ntwo lanes. However, land will be acquired now for the ultimate four/six lane facility. The Project \nhas also about 15 km of access roads to existing network. A map showing the highway is in \nAppendix 2. \n \nB.  Agencies and Financing  \n5.  The total cost of the Project was estimated at $296 million, with main project financing \nfrom  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  (40%),  ADB  (30%)  and  the \nGovernment of Sri Lanka (GoSL) (25%) as the borrower. The Nordic Development Fund and \nthe Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency are contributing to the road safety \ncomponent. JBIC and ADB finance the northern part of 67 km and southern part of 62 km \nrespectively. The Project is currently under construction with the Road Development Authority \n(RDA) as the executing agency for the highway component.  \n \nC.  Status of Project  \n6.  The loan was approved by the Board in November 1999 with a scheduled completion \ndate of 31 December 2005. However, the loan was not declared effective until 30 October 2002, \ndue  to  delays  in  compliance  with  the  conditions  of  loan  effectiveness,  in  particular  the \nsubmission of a satisfactory resettlement plan. As of 15 December 2004, about $27.4 million or \n27.4% of the ADB loan has been disbursed and project completion is close to 20%. About 80% \nof the contract awards under the ADB loan have been made. The loan closing date is scheduled \non 31 December 2006.   \n \n7.  The  JBIC-financed  northern  part  of  the  highway  is  also  subject  to  ADB  policy \nrequirements,  in  particular  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  and  environmental  impact \nmitigation.  \n ", "2   \n \n8.  Under the ADB component, a stretch of 8 km in the area where one group of the \nrequesters reside, is not yet under construction. Under the JBIC section, no construction award \nhas been awarded, but is expected early in 2005.  \n \n9.   RDA studied a trace called the \u201cOriginal Trace\u201d (OT) prior to ADB\u2019s involvement. Under \nan ADB-financed feasibility study the so called \u201cCombined Trace\u201d (CT) was suggested. At the \ntime of Board approval the CT was to be considered for preliminary and final design based on \nmore detailed mapping. Since loan approval, the trace was changed to what is now called the \n\u201cFinal Trace\u201d (FT), inter alia, to accommodate comments of the Central Environmental Agency \nof Sri Lanka. This change is the cause of the previous and current complaints.  \n \nD.  Requests under the previous Inspection Policy  \n10.  An organization of residents along the northern JBIC-financed part of the highway, called \nGama Surakeema Sanvidhanaya (GSS) claimed that they were negatively affected by the \nProject as a result of ADB\u2019s violations of a number of its policies. On this basis the GSS \nrequested on 6 December 2001 an inspection of the Project. A second similar request was filed \nby another local organization in the southern ADB-financed part of the highway, called United \nSociety for Protection of Akmeemana (USPA).  \n \n11.  After considering the requests and the response of Management, the Board Inspection \nCommittee (BIC) concluded that there was insufficient basis to recommend an inspection to the \nBoard and the Board did not authorize an inspection. The BIC recommended to the Board that \nManagement make strenuous efforts to use its good offices to bring about effective mediation \nand a satisfactory resolution to the outstanding resettlement issues. \n \nIII.  REQUEST FOR COMPLIANCE REVIEW \nA.  Requesters \n12.  This Request was filed by the Joint Organization of the Affected Communities (JO) as an \numbrella  organization  for  USPA  and  GSS.  The  requesters  are  Sarath  Athukorale,  L.D.L. \nPathmasiri and A.A.D. Sunil Ranjith Dayaratne, and 25 other identified project-affected people \nwho have asked that their identity be kept confidential. Evidence of authority representation of \nthe 25 people by JO has been checked and found satisfactory. \n \nB.  Request \n13.  The  Request  was  filed  after  the  complaint  submitted  by  JO  entered  step  7  of  the \nconsultation process in the consultation phase of the ADB Accountability Mechanism referred to \nin the paragraph 14 of the CRP Operating Procedures. Parallel process of both consultation and \ncompliance review is allowed at this stage.  \n \n14.  The request was first filed with the CRP on 14 November 2004, but lacked the \"requisite \nbasic information\" referred to in paragraph 30 of the CRP Operating Procedures.  Subsequent \nemail correspondence between the CRP and JO followed on 18 November 2004, 1 December \n2004, and 2 December 2004 before the request was registered. \n \n15.  The Requesters claim that the Report and Recommendation to the President and its \nattached documentation were for a trace known as the CT. At least, 40% of this trace has since \n ", "  3\nbeen altered by the RDA to a trace referred to as the FT, for which the required studies and \nconsultations may not have been done according to ADB policies.  \n \n16.  The Requesters claim to be suffering from, or will be suffering from, harm as a result of \nalleged noncompliance by ADB of its operational policies and procedures under the Project as \nfollows: loss of homes; loss of livelihoods; damage to the environment; degradation to wetlands; \ndispersion of integrated communities; damage to 5 temples; negative effects of resettlement; \nand human rights violations.  \n \n17.  The Requesters have specifically stated alleged violations of ADB's operational policies \nand  procedures  which  have  caused  harm  to  them,  including  environment;  involuntary \nresettlement;  incorporation  of  social  dimensions  in  ADB  operations;  governance;  economic \nanalysis;  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation;  gender  and  development  in  ADB  operations; \nprocessing of loan proposals; formulation and implementation of loan covenants; procurement \nof goods and services; and anticorruption.  \n \n18.  The Requesters seek remedies from ADB, including: \n \n(i)  payment of full compensation for resettlement; \n \n(ii)  conduct of gender analysis; \n \n(iii)  reconsideration of the best alignment for the road trace in order to minimize the \nnumber of persons to be resettled; \n \n(iv)  conduct of an initial social assessment for the FT; \n \n(v)  provision of adequate land to persons for replacement; \n \n(vi)  completion of an environmental impact assessment for the FT; \n \n(vii)  full consultation with affected people after completion of the new assessment \ndocuments; and \n \n(viii)  as  first  steps,  suspension  of  disbursements  under  the  credit,  and  a  full \ninvestigation of the highway by an independent committee. \n  \nIV.  ASSESSMENT AND FINDINGS \nA.  Conduct of Eligibility Assessment \n19.  The CRP obtained from the Special Project Facilitator (SPF) material related to the \ncomplaint in the consultation phase. The CRP has, however, not received any information on \nSPF's assessment of the eligibility other than the complaint is deemed eligible.   \n \n20.  The  CRP  recognizes  that,  as  allowed  under  the  accountability  policy,  the  SPF  will \ncontinue its process of facilitation with the Requesters even as this compliance review goes \nforward. \n \n \n ", "4   \n21.   The CRP conducted a desk-based review of relevant material from ADB management \nand public sources and met with ADB Board of Directors representing the borrower and ADB \nstaff. The CRP also carried out an eligibility review mission in Sri Lanka from 6 to 10 December \n2004 where the mission met with Requesters and other project-affected people, GoSL and \nexecuting agency officials as well as ADB and JBIC resident missions. The CRP reviewed the \nsituation at various Project sites and discussed with stakeholders including the requesters.  \n \n22.  The CRP held a plenary meeting from 14 to 16 December 2004 to consider the eligibility \nof the request. \n \nB.  Findings \n23.  The CRP views that the satisfactory conduct of its compliance review would necessitate \nthe termination of the so called \u201ccompliance review\u201d initiated in April 2004 by the South Asia \nDepartment (SARD). SARD\u2019s review unfortunately entails both contacts with Requesters on \ncompliance issues and a potentially publicly released report at the same time when the CRP is \nhandling the matter. The OCRP was requested to convey that view to Management in the \ninterest of avoiding confusion for the Requesters and a successful completion of the work of the \nAccountability Mechanism. \n \n24.  The CRP found that the request was not subject to any exclusions under paragraph 26 \nof the operating procedures, specifically: \n \n(i)  under  paragraph  26(v)  while  the  same  project  had  been  subject  to  a  prior \ninspection request, in this case new evidence has been provided to the CRP, \ninter alia:  \n \n(a)  new  information  on  issues  of  adequacy  of  environmental  and  social \nassessments for the FT; \n(b)  Management  response  during  the  previous  inspection  requests  built  \npartly on a court case irrelevant to the FT; and \n(c)  clarifications on what constitutes a corridor and its width. \n \n(ii)  under paragraph 26(iii) the allegations of corruption in the Project will be referred \nto the Office of the Auditor General; and  \n \n(iii)  under paragraph 26(ii) the allegations of procurement irregularities under the \nProject will be referred to the Central Operations Services Office.  \n \n25.  The CRP found that the requesters had claimed likely direct and material harm owing to \nthe actions and omissions of the ADB, including: \n \n(i)  loss of homes; \n(ii)  loss of livelihoods; \n(iii)  damage to the environment; \n(iv)  dispersion of integrated communities; \n(v)  damage to religious centers (temples); and \n(vi)  other negative effects of resettlement. \n ", "  5\n26.  The CRP, in the course of its desk-based review and site visit, found that the claimed \nharm was linked to those requesting the compliance review. \n \n27.  The CRP found that the direct and material harm cited by the Requesters is likely to be \nlinked to ADB\u2019s alleged failure to follow its operational policies and procedures in formulating, \nprocessing or implementing the Project. \n \n28.  The CRP identified a number of specific operational policies and procedures, cited by \nthe Requesters during the site visit, that may have been violated, which, inter alia, will be taken \nup in full during a compliance review: \n \n(i)  environment; \n(ii)  involuntary resettlement; \n(iii)  governance; \n(iv)  economic analysis; \n(v)  incorporation of social dimensions in ADB operations; \n(vi)  processing of loan proposals; and  \n(vii)  formulation and implementation of loan covenants. \n \nC.  Conclusion \n29.  Based on the above, the CRP determines that the Request is eligible. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n30.  As the CRP finds that the request is eligible, the CRP recommends that the Board \nauthorize a compliance review. \n \n \n \n \n \n/S/ Augustinus Rumansara \nChair, Compliance Review Panel \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 1 \n \n \nThe Secretary,  \nCompliance Review Panel, \nAsian Development Bank, \nManila,           Date of this request: 14th November 2004 \nPhilippines \n \nDear Secretary, \n \nSubmission of Request for Compliance Review:  \nSouthern Transport Development Project Sri Lanka, Loan SRI 1711 \n \nThe  Joint  Organization  of  the  Affected  Communities  on  Colombo  Matara  Highway \nrequest the Compliance Review Panel to help us by examining ADB\u2019s compliance with \nits own policies and procedures with regard to the project mentioned above.   \n \nThe Special Project Facilitator and the Office of the Special Project Facilitator should \ncontinue to handle and process the Complaint received on 9th June 2004, declared eligible \non 5th July 2004 and for which there is a Course of Action approved by the ADB \nPresident.  We do not wish the submission of this Request to be seen or acted upon as a \nrequest to stop the OSPF from following up on the Complaint. \n \nThe  Joint  Organization  members  include  Unified  Society  for  the  Protection  of \nAkmeemana  (USPA),  Gama  Surakeema  Sanvidhaniya  (GSS),  and  many  individuals \nalong the Colombo Matara Highway.  The President who is also an Affected Person is a \nsignatory to this Request together with Officials of USPA and GSS.   In support of the \nRequesters a few members of the Societies have also signed to confirm their agreement.   \n \nUSPA and GSS are groups of people who are complaining about the Highway and \nseeking resolution of the problems caused by the Highway. The Requesters are the \nmembers of the Organisations and Societies. \n \nWe are familiar with the Operating Procedures of the CRP, and understand that the CRP \nwill first examine whether this request meets its eligibility requirements. \n \nWe are aware that the ADB has failed to follow its policies/procedures, especially with \nregard to Environmental Impact, Involuntary Resettlement, Social Impact, Economic \nAnalysis and Environmental Monitoring, and that in doing so; we have suffered and are \nsuffering significant damage that we can describe.  \n \nWe have prepared the attached list of the Policies and Guidelines that we consider to be \nbreached.  We believe there are many more and the CRP process will investigate all the \nbreaches and not just those we have listed. \n \n         \n \nCRP Request    1 ", "Appendix 1 \nThe  specific  damage  related  to  these  policy  violations  is  described  in  the  attached \ndocument headed \u201cHarm to Requesters\u201d. \n \n \nRemedies \n \nWe would like ADB to help to remedy the harm in the following way. \n \nThe first step would be the suspension of disbursements of the loan by ADB.    \n \nThis suspension is important as the GoSL is likely to dispossess many of the requesters \nand their neighbours of their Homes and Lands within the next few weeks. Human \nRights are being breached at the request and the direction of ADB.  Some of these \nRights are incorporated in ADB Policies, others are the subject of International Law \nfor example the \u201cRight to a Healthy Environment\u201d and  \u201cRight to Equality\u201d.  The \nmaterial in this request indicates that ADB should not be lending until the Project is \nbrought into compliance. \n  \nWith the project disbursements suspended, the CRP should recommend that ADB require \na  full  investigation  of  the  Expressway  by  an  Independent  Committee  with  suitable \ntechnical skills with Representatives of the Requesters as members of the Committee. \nThis Committee should recommend a trace which ensures that the project meets the \ncriteria  which  were  applied  in  selecting  the  Combined  Trace  (CT)  as  well  as  the \nguidelines and policies of ADB and JBIC and the laws of Sri Lanka.  We recommend that \nthe trace be the Combined Trace, as the CT would meet all the Social, Environmental and \nEconomic policies and guidelines of the ADB.  However if the Committee can find a \ntrace equal to or better than the CT this would be acceptable. \n \nThe Committee having recommended a trace the following would be necessary. \n \n1.  Scoping is done and Terms of Reference for an EIA be established in cooperation \nwith the Requesters. \n \n2.  An EIA Report.  This should compare the Recommended Trace with the \nCombined Trace in all aspects covered by the EIA. \n \n3.  An SIA on the Recommended Trace. \n \n4.  An economic analysis of the Recommended Trace to check if it is viable in line \nwith ADB guidelines. \n \n5.  A full EIA process as required by the laws of Sri Lanka which would include an \nopportunity for all the Affected Persons and relevant experts to be heard. \n \n6.  Compliance of all ADB Guidelines for project formulation and approval including \npublic participation. \n \nShould the Committee recommend the Combined Trace then the above tasks have \nalready been completed. \n \nCRP Request    2", "  Appendix 1 \nThe Project is rife with Corruption a fact that has been reported to the ADB \nAuditor General\u2019s department, but who failed to do a proper investigation. \n \nOur request is that ADB should suspend disbursements for the Project until the \nProject Proponent and the Government of Sri Lanka ensure that:- \n \nThe Project complies with all ADB Policies and Operations Manuals especially those \npertaining  to  Resettlement,  Environment,  Indigenous  People,  Benefit  Monitoring  & \nEvaluation,  Incorporation  of  Social  Dimensions,  Governance,  Economic  Analysis, \nProcessing of Loan Proposals, Procurement of Goods & Services and Anti-corruption. \n \n \nWe have previously attempted to take care of our concerns with the Bank staff.  We \nattached a list of Contacts with the Bank to the SPF Complaint  (Appendix 14). \n \nWe  had  requested  an  Inspection  previously  and  this  was  rejected.    We  have  \u201cnew \nevidence\u201d as attached in \u201cInspection New Evidence\u201d. \n \nWe also attempted to find a solution with the Special Project Facilitator. This is a brief \nrecord of what happened \n \nWe submitted our complaint by delivering it to the Sri Lankan Resident Office, and by \nemail on 8th June 2004.   SPF confirmed having received on the Complaint on 9th June \n2004. \n \nOn 5th July we were advised that our complaint was eligible. \n \nThe process of Review and Findings was completed on 17th September 2004.  This is 52 \ndays beyond the 49 days permitted by the ADB Accountability Procedures.  OSPF \ndeclared this extra time was because the Government of Sri Lanka was trying to find a \nsolution through the Prime Minister\u2019s Committee.  This Committee has nothing to do \nwith the OSPF or its proceedings as has been clearly demonstrated by its report and \nactions.  This delay is a breach of ADB Policies. \n \nIt  should  also  be  noted  that  through  errors  in  ADB  the  report  did  not  reach  the \nComplainants till 28th September.   \n \nThe OSPF Report and Recommendations confirms many of the breaches of Policy as \nspecified in the attached list.  The OSPF recognized that there is no EIA, there is no SIA, \nand there are none of the required studies for the trace.  They have further gone on to \nconfirm that there are breaches of the Loan Agreement which have existed for several \nyears. \n \nThe OSPF has produced a Course of Action which has been approved by the President.  \nIt contained a trumped up charge by the RDA against the Complainants for which there is \nevidence showing the accusation to be completely false.  Subject to the removal of that \nitem and some minor adjustments requested by the Complainants the Course of Action \nwas accepted. \n \nCRP Request    3 ", "Appendix 1 \nThe Complainants will continue to use the facilities of the OSPF to find a solution in line \nwith the remedies requested. \n \nThe delay forced into the process by the OSPF is unacceptable as the RDA used the time \nto harass the Complainants and SARD to attempt to cover their policy breaches. Whilst \nthe OSPF have been advised of some of these incidents they have not been able to halt \nthe RDA\u2019s activities.  The recommendation by OSPF to RDA was ignored underlining \nthe RDA and SARD\u2019s unwillingness to follow the OSPF process. This delay is being \nused to make corrections more difficult.   \n \nThe delay is also reminiscent of the delays on the Inspection Process requested by ADB \nManagement and granted by the Inspection Committee.  The RDA used these delays to \nenforce its wishes on the Affected Persons. \n \nA letter has been sent to the SPF regarding delays, which was also copied to the CRP \nOffice.   \n \nWe are referring our complaint to the CRP because there are breaches of Policy and \nProcedure that should be investigated.  Despite the Project breaching ADB Policy in \nmany ways the ADB still continues to push for the project to be delivered.   \n \nWe represent an organization and a large group of people, please contact us through the \naddress and contact information as described below. \n \nContact can be made with:- \n \nMr Sarath Athukorale, \nPresident, \nJoint Organisation of the Affected Communities of the Colombo Matara Highway \nNo 1 Baddegodahena  Watte, \nWeedagama, \nBandaragama, \nSri Lanka \n \nBy email to joacmh@sltnet.lk  \n \nMr A.A.D Sunil Ranjith Dayaratne \nSecretary \nGama Surakeema Sanvidhaniya,  \n\u201cPasan Niwasa\u201d, \nGelanigama,       \nBandaragama      \nSri Lanka \n \nBy email to ggama@mail.ewisl.net \nCRP Request    4", "  Appendix 1 \n \nAccountability Mechanism  Southern Expressway \n \nRequest to the Compliance Review Panel. ADB \n \n \n \nCRP Request    5 ", "  Appendix 1 \nRequest for Compliance Review:   \nSouthern Transport Development Project  \n \nHarm being suffered by the Requesters. \n \nWe are, or are likely to be, directly affected materially and adversely by the ADB assisted \nproject known as the Southern Transport Development Project in Sri Lanka. \n \nHomes - We have lost or will lose our homes, our land and our livelihoods as a direct \nresult of the Expressway being built through our homes and lands and destroying our \ncommunities. \nThe ADB RRP and its attached documentation were for a trace known as the Combined \nTrace (CT).  At least 40% of this trace has since been altered by the Road Development \nAuthority (RDA) to a trace referred to as the Final Trace (FT).  The alterations are most \nsignificant in the North near Bandaragama and in the South near Akmeemana.  This \nchange  has  multiplied  the  housing  loss  and  is  destroying  the  social  and  religious \ncohesiveness and economic self-sufficiency of our villages. \nThere are 1,315 homes at least being destroyed along the Final Trace.  The ADB RRP \nhad estimated 810 as per the Combined Trace and expected this number to be reduced \nwhen the final trace was drawn.  The EIA stated the CT would destroy 622 houses.  The \nRDA has recently told the media that 4,000 homes will be damaged.  Further details have \nnot been released to the Public. \nOf the 1,315 homes to be destroyed by the FT 270 are in the Northern Deviation and 470 \nare in the Southern Deviation.  The CT that was approved in the loan documentation \nwould have destroyed only 40 and 50 homes respectively.  This is an eight-fold increase \nin these two deviations alone. \nEnvironment - The recent judgment in the Supreme Court confirmed that environmental \nstudies and consequently agricultural, irrigation, social studies, economic analysis, etc., \nhave not been done on the FT.  This has resulted in unquantified and unforeseen damage. \nThe facts below illustrate this further. \nLivelihoods of many Farmers\u2019 have been irreplaceably lost with the change of Trace.  \nThe FT runs through productive paddy fields rather than abandoned ones as well as tea \nand rubber estates.  Replacement agricultural land has not been provided to the majority \nof farmers.  Many of us are suffering with loss of our homes as well as loss of our \nproductive lands.  This impacts severely on our future lives as compensation will not feed \nour families for generations as our lands have done. \nThe estimate of lands to be directly lost is nearly 1000 hectares of which 300 hectares are \nPaddy fields.  The majority of the rest is rubber, tea and fruit and vegetable gardens, \nwhich contribute significantly to our economic well-being.  The water flows and the \nwater table itself will also be damaged and make fertile areas that are outside those \nacquired unproductive.  The choice of the FT going through productive lands has caused \nmaterial loss for many of us both directly and indirectly. \nWetlands - Our environment will also be considerably degraded.  An example is the \nPanape Wetland close to Bandaragama.  This wetland was not in any of the areas \nCRP Request Harm    1 ", "Appendix 1 \nstudied.  It is very important as an area of high bio-diversity and flood protection.  The \nFT goes through Panape along with other wetlands and huge tracts of productive Paddy \nFields.  This trace will cause irreparable damage to this area of high biodiversity.  If the \nPanape is left untouched as it has been for years it will be one of the places close to \nColombo where people will be able to come and appreciate nature. The Panape is rich \nin biodiversity and would also be preserved for scientific study. \nOne of the reasons for changing the trace was concern for wetlands, notably Bolgoda \nrecreational area in the North and Koggala in the South.   However Wetland Experts \nvalue the Panape Wetland, the paddy fields and the other wetlands along the Final Trace \nmore highly than the area of wetlands the CT was passing through. \nSocial Structure - Hitherto integrated communities will be dispersed.  We have extended \nfamily structures and up to 4 generations live within walking distance of each other. We \nwill now be displaced and forced to live away from each other. \nTemples - In the Bandaragama deviation there are 5 temples that will be damaged.  \nPreviously on the CT there were none to be affected.  One of the Temples has an \nOrphanage and two have Meditation Centres.  The loss of parts of our Temples and the \nseverance of community from the temple is destroying the religious and cultural base of \nour  society.    Running  an  Expressway  close  to  a  temple  means  that  the  peaceful \natmosphere, which is of intrinsic value to a temple, will be destroyed.   There will be \nvibrations from the Expressway and constant noise of traffic.  As the affected Monks say, \nsound barriers will not restore the peaceful environment.  This means that Bana and Pirith \nwill not be able to be practiced in a tranquil setting, as they should be.  Affidavits from \nthe Monks regarding the damage to the Temples are attached to the SPF Complaint \nAppendix 10(a). \nSome of our members took the change of trace to the Court of Appeal.  The Court \nappointed a Judicial Committee of three retired Supreme Court Judges chaired by a \nretired Chief Justice to investigate the change of trace.  They took evidence directly for \nseveral days and spent two days visiting the various traces.  The Committee strongly \nnoted the lack of information to the affected people and damage to a Temple in particular. \nA copy of the Judicial Committee Report is attached.  It is pertinent to note that on the \napproved Combined Trace no temples were to be affected. \nResettlement Practice - Direct harm has been caused to many of the Affected People by \nthe way Involuntary Resettlement has been carried out.   None of the people have access \nto the Resettlement Plan and their Entitlements.  The ADB informed us in 2001 that the \nplan  was  available  in  Sinhala,  but  the  Sinhala  translation  promised  to  the  Chief \nRepresentative of JBIC in May 2004 is still not available to the people. \nThe Resettlement is being done in a very cruel and harsh manner contrary to the ADB \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy.  Many people are suffering, particularly the disabled, \nthe women and the elderly.  People are being forced onto Resettlement sites without even \nwater and electricity.    \nAffected Persons are told that they will get no compensation if they do not do as the RDA \ninsists.  Many have been forced to destroy their homes and live in wooden shacks, even \nelderly and widows are forced to break their houses and live in the kitchen or bathroom \nCRP Request Harm  2", "  Appendix 1 \nonly as the rest of the house is destroyed.  Wells have been filled in, toilets destroyed, and \nthe families left without any water or toilet facilities. \nAs a matter of practice throughout the trace full compensation has not been paid prior to \neviction.  Some are forced to fall into debt when they relocate, some to live in half built \nhomes awaiting the money. \nAs the Resettlement sites in some cases are a long way from their homes many are also \nlosing their livelihoods.  No attempt has been made to replace these livelihoods.  The \nlabouring work being done on construction of the Expressway has been given to people \nfrom outside the area.  We were informed and have since checked, and found this to be \ntrue.  The labourers were employed by a company owned by the brother of the former \nMinister who was put in charge of the STDP by the previous Prime Minister. \nThe RDA\u2019s failure to inform and involve people has resulted in resistance in many places \nalong the trace.  They are now penalising these people by terrorising and forcing them out \nof their properties.  They are neither fully compensated nor are there properly prepared \nresettlement sites or places to go.  \nDetails of the way that Resettlement has been done can be found in the Additional \nEvidence supplied to the SPF.  This was the result of site visits and interviews by Friends \nof the Earth Japan in the presence of the Chief Representative of the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation.  These were carried out mainly in the ADB section, as well as \nthe one site in the JBIC section. \n \n \nFurther details of the harm being suffered can be provided. \n \n \nHarm is due to ADB\u2019s Actions and Omissions \n \nADB has a series of Safeguard and other Policies which ADB Management is duty bound \nto follow.  Many breaches of these have occurred and continue to occur.  The harm we \nare suffering is because ADB Management has not complied with these Policies. \n \nThe  Final  Trace  has  not  been  covered  by  an  EIA.  The  FT  is  outside  the  corridor \nrecommended in the RRP and approved by the Board in 1999.  There have been no \nSocial Studies on the 48km of the Final Trace that are deviations from the Combined \nTrace.  The viability of the Combined Trace was a marginal 12.2% with costs increased \nby 10% and benefits reduced by 10%.  Costs have more than doubled compared to those \nused in the Economic Analysis of the RRP.  Benefits have been reduced by much more \nthan 10% by moving the trace away from the sources of traffic.  No reappraisal of the \nProject has been done that is publicly available.  The Final Trace has more than doubled \nresettlement.  The actual number of homes for which resettlement is necessary is not \nbeing disclosed by the RDA only those within the Acquisition line of the Expressway.  \nThose to be resettled because of underpasses overpasses or interchanges are not counted, \nnor their compensation assessed. \n \nIn  2001  ADB  Management  was  advised  of  the  harsh  and  inhumane  way  that \nResettlement was being done.  The methods used for Resettlement have not improved.  \nThe direct breaches of the Involuntary Resettlement Policy were advised to ADB and \nCRP Request Harm    3 ", "Appendix 1 \nthey  have  ignored  all  these.    Neither  the  Resident  Mission  nor  any  of  the  visiting \nMissions have monitored Resettlement practices otherwise the suffering that is being \nforced  on  those  who  have  been  removed  from  their  homes,  their  lands  and  their \nlivelihoods would not be continuing.  No information is supplied to those being resettled, \nneither  a  Resettlement  Plan,  an  Entitlement  Matrix,  not  even  an  analysis  of  the \nCompensation they are receiving.  No information for them to understand their rights or \neven whether they have been robbed by the Resettlement Officers. \n \nAll the above are breaches of ADB Policies.  From 2001 the ADB has been advised of \nthis.  In August 2001 President Chino was advised directly.  An Inspection request in \nOctober  2001  gave  details  of  the  breaches.    Inaccurate  information  given  by  ADB \nManagement  to  the  Board  Inspection  Committee  denied  us  this  Inspection.      This \ninaccurate information shows ADB Management\u2019s complicity in the harm being done.  \nADB Management denials and active assistance to the Government of Sri Lanka is a \ndirect cause of our suffering.   \n \nIf the ADB had ensured compliance with policies, then we would not be suffering harm.   \n \nHuman  Rights  violations  are  being  committed  within  ADB\u2019s  knowledge  and \nconnivance.  ADB is party to those violations.  This is clearly against Policy. \n \nThere are breaches of covenants of the Loan Agreement of which ADB management \nis aware. Disbursements of the Loan could have been suspended if not terminated.  \nADB Management has taken no action. \n \nThe  disbursement  of  funds  whilst  the  breaches  occur  permits  the  RDA  and  other \nauthorities to continue to do harm to us.  The granting of permission by ADB to the \nGovernment of Sri Lanka to sign a contract with Kumagai Gumi when the contract was \nfor a trace that was not permissible within ADB\u2019s policies and cases were still in the \nCourts is causing harm to us.  All these omissions and actions make ADB the direct and \nindirect cause of harm to us. \n \n \nCRP Request Harm  4", "  Appendix 1 \nSouthern Transport Development Project  CRP Request \n \nInspection New Evidence \n \nPrevious ADB Inspection actions with regard to this request \n \nGama Surakeema Sanvidhaniya (GSS) requested an Inspection in 2001.  The Board \nInspection Committee (BIC) recognised it was not frivolous and met the requirements \nfor an inspection.   \n \nCopies  of  the  requests  and  covering  letter  were  attached  to  the  SPF  Complaint \nAppendix 3(a) and 3 (b).  NB All references to Appendices are to the SPF Complaint. \n \nIn line with the 1995 Inspection Policy the Board Inspection Committee (BIC) asked \nfor a response to the request from Management.  After considerable delay permitted \nby  BIC  without  any  consideration  of  the  requesters\u2019  position,  they  received  a \nresponse.  The response was legalistic and contained many factual errors.  Without \nseeking  any  input  from  the  Requesters  the  BIC  decided  on  the  basis  of  the \nManagement Response to reject the Inspection Request.    \n \nAs required by the Inspection Policy the rejection had to be reviewed by a member of \nthe Inspection Roster.  He produced a report stating that he disagreed with BIC \nand recommended that an Inspection be carried out. \n \nHowever the ADB Board accepted the recommendation of the BIC to reject the \nInspection  Request,  disregarding  the  Roster  Member\u2019s  conclusion.    The  report \ncontaining all the details on this request was issued by BIC in March 2002. \n \nThe original inspection request raised a number of other ADB policy violations in \nSTDP, in addition to the issue of the EIA and the alteration of the traces. The ADB \nshould have inspected those violations but did not.   \n \nAnother organisation, Unified Society for the Protection of Akmeemana (USPA) \nrequested  an  Inspection  in  2001,  copies  were  attached  to  the  SPF  Complaint \nAppendix 4(a) and 4(b).  This request followed a similar pattern with Management \nmaintaining the same errors in their Management Response.  BIC decided against the \nInspection and again the Roster Member recommended an Inspection should be done.  \nThe details of this request are in the report of the Board Inspection Committee dated \nApril 2002. \n \nVarious other societies and individuals requested an Inspection during this same time.  \nThe Board Inspection Committee directly rejected these and no detailed reports were \nissued on these.   \n \nThe failure of the inspection process to solve the problems of those affected by the \nproject was one of the main reasons that ADB was forced to fully and properly review \nthe Inspection process. \n \nAt the Annual General Meeting of ADB in Shanghai in 2002 a representative of GSS \nadvised the President of ADB and the Senior Management of the many errors in the \nManagement Response to GSS.  The details of the errors were handed in summary \nCRP Inspection New Evidence  1", "Appendix 1 \nform to them (SPF Appendix 3 (c)).  The USPA report was not yet available so that \nwas not discussed.   \n \nADB Management responded to the GSS list of errors on 26th July 2002 with a further \nset of inaccurate statements SPF Appendix 3(d).  GSS replied to this demonstrating \nthe inaccuracies of Management in their report using the various documents of ADB \nSPF  Appendix  3(e).    The  President  of  ADB  and  ADB  Management  refused  to \nconsider this document. \n \nA list of the errors in the USPA Management Response were attached to the SPF \nComplaint Appendix 4(c). \n \nSince the rejection by BIC the Requesters have been taking actions through the Courts \nin Sri Lanka. \n \n \nNew Evidence \n \nWe  are  submitting  the  following  \u201cnew  evidence\u201d  so  as  to  comply  with  the \nAccountability Function\u2019s requirement that claims disposed of once cannot be brought \nbefore the new mechanism unless there is \u201cnew evidence\u201d. We consider the following \nto be New Evidence and to be more than sufficient for an unbiased recommendation \nfor a full inquiry and the project disbursements to be suspended.  As the USPA and \nGSS  inspection  rulings  were  similar  and  the  Court  Actions  produced  a  single \nJudgement we combine the New Evidence below. \n \nJudicial Committee (SPF Appendix 8) \n \nMembers of GSS and USPA filed action in the Court of Appeal against the RDA and \nCEA.  The Bench of Judges could see there was a large volume of evidence which \nrequired considerable time to hear, and that site visits would most likely be necessary. \nTherefore they set up a Judicial Committee with the agreement of all parties.  The \nCourt appointed three retired Supreme Court Judges with the eminent Chief Justice \nParinda Ranasinghe to chair the Committee.  Costs of the Committee were equally \nshared by State and petitioners.  The villagers of Akmeemana and Bandaragama had \nto fund Rs.100,000/= between them. \n \nThe Committee had many days of hearings with all the parties present and represented \nby Counsel.  They heard from many of the 50 petitioners and also their neighbours.  \nExperts spoke on behalf of the RDA and CEA.  The Committee spent two days \naccompanied by Counsel, the RDA, CEA, their experts and some of the petitioners \nvisiting the sites under the guidance of first the RDA and then the Petitioners.  All \nparties were given full opportunity to present their information except the evidence of \none of the main wetland experts in Sri Lanka whose presence was rejected by the \nCEA. \n \nThe ADB had imposed a deadline for submission of the Resettlement Implementation \nPlan (RIP) which constrained the Committee as the completion of their report had to \nprecede the submission of the RIP.  Members of GSS & USPA visited ADB Colombo \nOffice and asked them to extend the deadline by a week or two to give the Committee \ntime to do a full investigation.  This request was turned down and the Committee had \nto  rush  their  investigations.    This  is  Further  (and  New)  Evidence  of  ADB\u2019s \nCRP Inspection New Evidence  2", "  Appendix 1 \nunwillingness to co-operate in identifying and correcting the errors on this project and \nbringing it into compliance. \n \nThe Judicial Committee concluded that: \n \n\u201cThe word \u201calteration\u201d cannot and must not be construed to encompass only \nchanges that are made voluntarily by a project proponent.  Alterations made in \npursuance  of  a  direction  made  by  one  in  authority  too  need  subsequent \nexamination and affirmation.\u201d \n \n\u201cThe alterations affected in this case are in fact changes of a substantial \ncharacter, nature and extent.  They need to be approved afresh.\u201d \n \n\u201c\u2026the deviations, both at Bandaragama and at Akmeemana, can only be \nconsidered feasible and desirable if the procedure set out in the NEA and \nregulation 17 relating to \u2018alterations\u2019 are complied with,\u2026.\u201d \n \nThese  decisions  made  by  the  Judicial  Committee  identify  that  the  EIA  process \nrequired for approval was necessary for the alterations. \n \nThis is New Evidence confirming that the FT is an \u201calteration\u201d and that it lacks \napproval under the National Environmental Act. \n \nSupreme Court Judgement (SPF Appendix 9) \n \nAffected persons from both the Northern and Southern Deviations filed action in \nCourts against the RDA, CEA and associated parties.  The judgement was issued on \n20th January 2004 and is New Evidence.   \n \n1.  It is a Supreme Court Judgement on the Expressway that was delivered after \nthe Inspection Request was denied.   \n2.  It is a new confirmation, by the Highest Court in Sri Lanka, of the contention \nof the Requesters that the RDA was constructing on an unstudied trace, which \nfact was disputed by the ADB at the time of the Previous Request.    \n \nThe Judgement, delivered by the Supreme Court, gave clear decisions on several \npoints which are relevant to the Breaches of ADB guidelines and to statements by \nADB Management in its Response. \n \nThe Supreme Court judgement stated: - \n \n(1) That the deviations (\u201calterations\u201d) were not covered in the studies done for the \nEIA \n(2) That the petitioners in the case were affected by the Final Trace (FT), and not \nby the Original Trace (OT) nor Combined Trace (CT).   \n(3) It found that the \u201cfinal alignment\u201d did not include \u201cthe petitioner\u2019s area.\u201d   \n(4) That the RDA altered the route (to the Final Trace), after the CEA approved \nan earlier trace. The court held that the deviations were \u201calterations\u201d and as \nsuch the National Environmental Act required a Supplementary EIA to \nbe done. \nCRP Inspection New Evidence  3", "Appendix 1 \n(5) That the CEA could not delegate its power to approve the deviation \n(\u201calteration\u201d) to the RDA; thus only the CEA could approve the Final Trace.   \nWhich it had not. \n(6) That the people affected by the deviations were entitled to prior notice and \nto be heard \n(7) That the Rights of the Petitioners under the Constitution of Sri Lanka had \nbeen violated.  \n(8) That the Principles of Natural Justice had not been adhered to. \n \n**It should be noted that the Supreme Court has ruled that the deviations have \nnot been legally approved.  This is a breach of the ADB Policies.  \n \n**The Court has ruled that the Affected Persons had not been given prior notice \nor been heard.  This is also a breach of ADB Policies.  \n \n**The Supreme Court ruled that the deviations (\u201calterations\u201d) had not been studied in \nthe EIA and required that a supplementary EIA be conducted.   ADB Policies \nrequire that national environmental laws are adhered to and that projects with \nsignificant changes (as in this case), be re-appraised with new environmental and \nsocial documentation produced and approved as the case may be. \n \n \n1999 case on EIA - ADB Management misrepresented facts \n \nIn 1999 the Public Interest Law Foundation (PILF) took a case to the Court of Appeal \nregarding the Southern Expressway.  This was nothing to do with the CEA ruling on \ntraces, nor was it brought by the requesters. \n \nThe Board Inspection Committee denying our inspection requests gave as one of the \nreasons \u201cThe RRP made clear that the final trace to be followed depended on a ruling \nby the CEA, which reverted the \u2018combined trace\u2019 to the \u2018original trace\u2019.  The CEA \nwas subsequently challenged in court for this but upheld by both the Court of \nAppeal[s] and the Supreme Court (as cited in the Management\u2019s Response).  This \nmaterial development had not been disclosed by the Requester.\u201d (Our emphasis) \n \nThis statement by the BIC is incorrect for the following reasons \n \n1.  The Court of Appeal and Supreme Court case did not challenge the traces, it \nchallenged the inadequacy of the EIA in researching alternatives to an \nExpressway. \n2.  The requesters were not parties to this case and were not even aware of the \ndetails of this case when the Inspection Request was made. \n3.  The judgement in fact stated that the Combined Trace was the approved one. \n   \nThe requesters could not have known, indeed never expected, that the BIC would \nmisunderstand the judgement especially as the legal premise and grounds had been \nclarified to ADB Counsel.  Exposure of this must be New Evidence. \n \nFollowing the preparation of the Inspection Request, at the meeting of some of the \nRequesters and others with a Mission from ADB Manila on 10th December 2001, \nADB Counsel mentioned the PILF case judgement.    As the Requesters were not \ninvolved in the case they were not aware of the details of the judgement.  Therefore \nCRP Inspection New Evidence  4", "  Appendix 1 \nthey asked the lawyer who brought the action to clarify the matter with the ADB \nCounsel.  This was done.  It is difficult to comprehend how the judgement, with \nclarification of the issues provided to the Counsel, was subsequently so misinterpreted \nby ADB. \n \n1.  ADB Management had a copy of the judgement, which is also annexed to the \nManagement Response. (SPF Appendix 4).  ADB Management could not have \nread into it any issue about the traces. \n \n2.  ADB Management acted in bad faith.   The lawyer who brought the PILF \naction informed ADB Counsel Mr. Arjun Goswami and the secretary to the \nBIC by fax. Significant excerpt is\u2026 \n \n\u201cThe EIA was challenged by PILF on the basis that it had failed and \nneglected to address \u201cenvironmentally friendly alternatives\u201d \nadequately.  In particular several alternatives, including a hinterland \nroadway, the expansion of the coastline railway and combinations of \nthese as well as the TSM option had not been considered. The court \nruled that alternatives had been considered on the basis of what the \n\u2018experts\u2019 said in the EIA.\u201d  \n \n3.  ADB Management was aware from the judgement that the requesters were not \nparties, further the lawyer who brought the case had stated this in his fax to \nMr. Goswami\u2026 \n \n\u201cThe communities who have petitioned the ADB\u2019s inspection \nprocedure were not parties to that case and hence their rights and \ninterests remain unaffected by that decision.\u201d \n \n4.  The Judgement of the Court of Appeal in the PILF case confirmed the choice \nof the combined trace stating\u2026  \n \n\u201cNeedless to say, under judicial review procedure, it is not open to me \nto substitute my own views for that of the CEA which has thought it fit \nto accept the recommendation of the experts\u2026..Southern Expressway \nwhich is depicted as the \u2018combined trace\u2019. \u2026 as the best of all options \nor schemes.\u201d \n \nThe Combined Trace was the approved one.  The trace now being used in the areas \nrelevant to this request does not follow even one metre of the Combined Trace. \n \nWe as requesters were not aware that the ADB would misrepresent the facts of the \n1999 case.  We urge the SPF to read pages 3, 4 & 5 of the \u2018Management Denial \nResponse\u2019  (Attached as SPF Appendix 3 (e)) \n \nSupreme Court Judgement 2004 regarding PILF case. \n \nIn  the  Requesters  case  in  the  Appeal  Court  the  RDA  counsel  made  preliminary \nobjections that the case had already been adjudicated through the Judgement on the \nPILF case.  However this was not accepted and the cases proceeded in the Court of \nAppeal  and  finally  to  the  Supreme  Court.  The  Appeal  Court  did  not  find  the \nobjections of the RDA regarding the PILF case to be justified.  The Supreme Court \nCRP Inspection New Evidence  5", "Appendix 1 \nalso did not accept the argument. Thereby confirming that the PILF challenge on \nalternatives was nothing to do with the issue of a trace that did not conform with the \nlaws of Sri Lanka. The two issues were not related.  Please note that the question of \nalternative modes of transport was not raised in the Inspection Requests.   \n \nThis  is  New  Evidence,  ADB  Management  stated  that  the  PILF  case  had \nconclusively decided on the matter.  The Board Inspection Committee believed \nthem.   The Supreme Court judgement shows that the Management response was \nincorrect.  The Final Trace is a new trace, for which no EIA has been done. \n \nLocation of the trace \n \nIn our requests for inspection the location of the trace and the fact that we were not \ninformed of the new trace were central to the request.   \n \nThe ADB Management made out that the EIA covered a wide area, the Supreme \nCourt also heard arguments from the RDA and CEA with regard to \u201cProject Area\u201d \nand did not accept them.  This is conclusive, within Sri Lanka\u2019s legal framework, the \nEIA did not cover a wide area. \n \n \nMaps showing the actual position of the traces (SPF Appendix 5 & 6) \n \nThe Management Response was very clear that the \u201cProject was approved on the \nbasis of a 3-4 km wide corridor\u201d.  In many places the Management Response to GSS \nstated that the Requester\u2019s area was within this corridor.  (Paragraphs 43, 57, 58, 63, \n65, 66, 74, 77, 91, 95, 96, 97, 98 & 100.)  The Requesters of the GSS Inspection were \nand are not within the corridor.  \n \nWe  have  been  advised  that  the  only  evidence  the  Bank  Inspection  Committee \nconsiders acceptable to prove this is an official map showing the distances between \npoints.  No official map was available to the Requesters (or the Public) at the time of \nthe submission of the Inspection Request to show that the Final Trace was outside the \nCorridor.   \n \nMaps that the RDA had produced were only made available to the Courts during the \ncases.  They were not available to the Affected Persons before hand and were only \ngiven to the Courts directly by the RDA. Copies of these maps are attached to the SPF \nComplaint as Appendix 5. \n \nIn fact there are other maps that were shown to Court which would have been further \nproof of the distances. The RDA promised in Court, to give them to the petitioners, \nbut has not done so, despite written requests by the petitioners\u2019 lawyers. \n \nThe maps attached show the individual traces and give the distances along the trace.  \nFrom this it is clear that the supposed 3km band does not cover the Final Trace.  \nThe Final Trace is outside the band that the feasibility study had agreed as the basis \nfor the preparation of plans by the RDA and their consultants.  The actual studied area \nwas only 122 metres on the OT and 200 metres on the deviations recommended and \nincluded in the CT.   The SIA only covered the trace itself.   \n \nCRP Inspection New Evidence  6", "  Appendix 1 \nFor clarity a diagrammatic map of the Bandaragama deviation is attached showing the \ntraces and the 3 km band. (Map 4) \n \nObtaining of \u201cConsent\u201d and Intimidation by RDA (SPF Appendix 12 & 13) \n \nIn August 2002 the RDA required to prove to ADB the consent of those who would \nbe displaced.  They also wanted to carry out surveying of the Final Trace.  Because of \nthe injustices they had suffered the affected people were not willing to give up their \nrights to their property so surveying was refused.  The RDA then came with Police \nand  the  surveyors.  The  RDA  Officers  also  used  the  presence  of  the  Police  to \nintimidate householders into signing questionnaires, which were later completed by \nRDA officials.  Affidavits and Photographs are attached to the SPF Complaint. \n \nThe complicity of ADB, whilst not being provable is certainly indicated.  Two of our \nleading  members  were  attending  an  ADB  consultation  in  Kathmandu  on  the \nInspection Process.  Whilst they were there, their Homes and Lands and those of their \nneighbours were invaded.  The surveyors came with Police.  According to them they \nwere  instructed  by  a  phone  call  to  go  in  that  day.    The  ADB  staff  present  in \nKathmandu were advised of the actions of the RDA.   \n \nThe above is New Evidence of the actions of RDA and the possible complicity of \nADB.   The lack of action by the ADB after this leads one to believe that they were \nsilent but willing partners in this violation of basic Human Rights.  The completion of \nforms by RDA Officers, the intimidation to obtain signatures, the willingness of ADB \nto use this information despite knowing how it was obtained, all of this is outside \nADB policies.  It occurred in August 2002. \n \nADB Manila Review Mission Site Visit (SPF Appendix 15c & 15d) \n \nOn  22nd  May  2004,  the  Review  Mission  consisting  of  Ms  Mulquenny,  Ms \nJayewardene and Mr Tsuji visited the Bandaragama and Akmeeemana areas.  Mr \nCooney and Mr Rinker from the Resident Office accompanied them.  They were able \nto see the actual position of the Combined Trace, Original Trace and Final Trace.  In \nBandaragama by travelling the distance between the traces they were able to register \nthe distance between the Combined Trace at Rammukkana and the Final Trace at \nGelanigama, which was noted as 2.8km.  The distance between the Original Trace at \nWeedagama and the Final Trace at Gelanigama was noted as 0.6 km.  This is New \nEvidence of the actual distances between the traces as this exercise had not been done \nwith anyone from ADB till then. \n \nSocial Impact Assessment \n \nThe Social Impact Assessment only covered the CT, as is clear from the SIA itself.  \nThe SIA says that the questionnaire only covered the sample of houses actually \nalong the trace.  The details in the tables concerning demographics and homes \nreferred only to those on the trace itself.   \n \nThis information was enhanced by \u201cdiscussions\u201d with people on attitudes to the \nExpressway being close to their house.  These discussions were held in a 3km band \ncentred on the Combined Trace.  These discussions did not form part of the data in the \nSIA and hence could not have formed the basis for the Resettlement Plan. \n \nCRP Inspection New Evidence  7", "Appendix 1 \nThe SIA was not available to the Requesters until a formal application was made \nthrough counsel in the Appeal Court case.  This was long after the Inspection Request \nhad been denied.  Therefore the Social Impact Analysis is New Evidence on the \ncorridor used for the RRP and on which the approval of the loan was based. \n \nFeasibility Study \n \nThe feasibility study shows the reason for the CT being recommended as the only \nviable option in the EIA.  The feasibility study was available only to RDA and ADB, \nnot to the Requesters.  One section was provided to the Requesters with the Board \nInspection Committee report after the Inspection had been denied.  The page attached \nto the SPF complaint as Appendix 11 is therefore New Evidence. \n \nIt is pertinent to note here that the Feasibility Study is still not available to the \nrequesters due to the refusal by the GoSL to release it.  We think that the \nFeasibility Study will reveal much New Evidence. \n \nIn order for the CRP to ensure they are adequately informed they would need to \nensure that we are given a copy and are able to make our submissions on it. \n \nInvoluntary Resettlement (SPF Appendix 7) and Additional Evidence to the SPF \n \nSince the Inspection Request the RDA and the associated government officials and \nthe contractors have removed people from their homes.  The way this was done is \noutside the guidelines of the ADB.   \n \nNo Resettlement plan is available to the public.   The Joint Organisation has received \n(30th April) a copy from the Resident ADB Office thanks to our request made in \nManila on 17th March.  Copies are not available at the Divisional Secretaries Offices \nin Akmeemana or Bandaragama or at the RDA Resettlement Offices, despite written \nrequests  and  many  visits.    The  Sinhala  copy  of  the  plan  is  not  available  at  all \nDivisional Secretariats notwithstanding assurances by ADB that it was available.  \n(ADB  wrote  on  28th  Sept.  2001  in  response  to  GSS  letter  of  11th  Aug.2001.)  \nChairman RDA promised a Sinhala copy would be available within a month in June \n2004.  This is still not available 5 months later. \n \nAn extract of 12  pages in Sinhala was made available to GSS recently but omits vital \npages like the sequence of acquisition steps, details of entitlements, resettlement sites \netc.,  The English document is over 2 inches thick. \n \nDetails of the way people have had their homes destroyed without any payment of \ncompensation is noted in the information given to SPF.  Widows, disabled, children, \nold people, many have been left without shelter, without proper access to water and \nwithout sanitation.  The Government Officials have insisted on the home owners \ndestroying their homes saying that if they did not they will never get anything.  The \npowerless have little choice but to accept.  This is very far away from all the policies \nof ADB. \n \nIt is contrary to the terms of the Loan Agreement that the ADB and the GoSL signed.  \nThe ADB is not ensuring that the Involuntary Resettlement Policy is followed.  This \nwould not have been known or even contemplated by any sane person at the time of \nthe previous inspection request.  This is New Evidence \nCRP Inspection New Evidence  8", "  Appendix 1 \n \nResettlement Monitoring \n \nThe ADB employed a monitoring firm whose only action is putting more pressure on \npeople to leave their homes.  They have certainly not been acting as monitors.   \n \nThe monitors went to individuals, took photographs of their homes, gave exaggerated \nvalues for their properties and then asked if the people would accept such a sum.  The \nanswer was yes.   Subsequently the compensation offered by the RDA did not come \nanywhere close to the sum suggested by the monitors.  \n \nRequest by us for the Monitoring Report was made in Manila on 17th March 2004 and \nagain to Mr. John Cooney, Country Director, Sri Lanka on 28th April 2004 with no \nsuccess.  This is yet more new evidence of ADB\u2019s lack of Transparency. \n \nSPF Report and Recommendations confirmed there was no proper monitoring being \ndone. \n \nA recent survey by the respected NGO, Centre for Environmental Justice shows that \n73% of resettled families were not satisfied with the compensation they received.  \n95%  had  not  received  their  total  compensation  even  though  they  had  been \ndispossessed.

The majority of the planning of \nthe project and the problems deriving from it were done prior to that date and \ntherefore the previous policies will mainly be used as the basis for this document.  At \nthe end of this document we will include a section dealing with breaches that are \ncurrently occurring and fall under the above policies. \n \nOM Section 20/OP Environmental Considerations in Bank Operations \n \nThis project has been classified as Environmental Category A.  Category A projects \nare  \u201cProjects expected to have significant adverse environmental impacts.\"  ADB \nOM sec. 20/OP Para 2.  The bank policies require an environmental impact \nassessment  (EIA) for category A projects.  ADB OM sec. 20/OP Para 2. \n \nAn EIA was produced in 1999 and approved by the CEA.  In their approval they \nrecommended alterations to the trace.  The RDA made further alterations and is now \nusing a trace different to that in the EIA or that recommended by the CEA.  This trace \nis known as the Final Trace (FT) \n \nThe Supreme Court Judgement has confirmed that in the Final Trace (FT) there are \n\u201calterations\u201d to the trace and that the EIA does not cover these Alterations.  There is \ntherefore no EIA for the trace the STDP is now following.  This is a fundamental \nrequirement of ADB\u2019s policies. \n \nThe lack of an EIA is a violation of Bank Policy ADB OM sec. 20/OP Para 2. \n \n \nAccording to ADB policies,  \u201ca typical EIA Report includes the following major \nelements:  (i) description of the project,  (ii) description of the environment, (iii) \nanticipated environmental impacts and mitigation measures, (iv) alternatives, (v) \neconomic assessment, (vi) institutional  requirement  and  environmental monitoring \nprogramme, (vii)  public involvement and (viii) conclusion.  The report is prepared by \nthe borrower and reviewed/cleared by the EIA regulatory agency of the borrowing \ncountry and the bank\u201d ADB OM sec. 20/OP Para 2. fn2. \n \nAs you will see from the list of points below, the Bank approved a loan for a category \nA project without an adequate EIA.   This is a violation of the bank Policy on \nEnvironmental Considerations OM Section 20/OP. \n \na) The project, environment and the anticipated environmental impacts and mitigation \nmeasures, are not described in the EIAR as required in (i), (ii) and (iii) above. \n \nCRP Request Policy Breaches    1 ", "Appendix 1 \nThe EIAR described two different road alternatives, the Original and Combined \ntraces.  The trace on which the Expressway is to be constructed is a trace referred to \nas the Final Trace.  In many places and particularly in the Bandaragama and \nAkmeemana areas this is a new trace altogether.  Since there is no information on this \nnew trace in the EIAR it does not meet the requirement in (i), (ii),  (iii), (v) and (viii) \nabove.   \n \nThis is a violation of the Bank Policy ADB OM sec. 20/OP Para 2. \n \nb) Anticipated environmental impacts and mitigation measures not described in EIA \nas required in (iii) above. \n \nThe EIA did not cover all the significant flooding and environmental impacts.  The \ntrace has now been changed.  In the Northern section it will destroy the Panape Ela \nwetlands.   The EIA did not cover these as they were not on the trace which was \nsurveyed in 1996 and included in the 1999 EIA. In the Southern deviation it is going \nthough large hills, deep valleys and many watercourses.  None of these were included \nin the EIA.  Further this area is known as being at significant risk of landslides.  This \nis likely because of deep cutting of hills and at least requires mitigation measures.  \nThe Government department responsible for the avoidance and managing of \nlandslides, the National Building Research Organisation, having seen what is being \ndone has written to the Central Environmental Authority requiring an investigation \nand Mitigatory measures to be put in place.  This hazard was not considered in the \nEIAR \n \nThis is a violation of the Bank Policy ADB OM sec. 20/OP Para 2. \n \nc) Proper examination of alternatives required under section (iv) \n \nAs required the EIAR did not consider alternative modes of transportation in great \ndepth, such as improvements to the railway system.  Nor did it properly evaluate the \nuse of improving the current road and use of bypasses.  The criteria in judging an \nalternative, as defined in the Objectives of the Project, was that the project was to \nbuild a limited access Highway. EIA Ch. 3 Sec. 3.1)  \n \nThe lack of investigation of alternatives is a violation of the Bank Policy. \n \nd) Economic Assessment as required in (v) above is not adequate \n \nThe costs and benefits of the trace now being implemented will be significantly \ndifferent from either of the traces given in the EIAR.  Therefore the resultant EIRR \nwill be wrong.  An adequate assessment of the Trace being constructed has not been \ndone.  This is a violation of the Bank Policy. \n \ne) Public not involved in environmental assessment programme as required under \nsection (vii) above \n \nThe ADB policy describing an EIA states that a component of the EIA is public \ninvolvement. \n \nCRP Request Policy Breaches    2 ", "  Appendix 1 \n \ni).  The first stage of public involvement as required by the National \nEnvironmental Act is in \u201cScoping\u201d.  This is where representatives, village \nleaders, etc. of all those possibly to be affected are invited to a discussion.  \nThis was done for other traces not for the Final Trace.  Scoping was not \ndone on the alterations made to the Final Trace. \n \nii).  Notification of the EIA to the public was done only through the \nGovernment owned newspapers.  No attempt was made to advise the local \npeople who might be affected. \niii).  CEA Public meetings - two along a stretch of 128 Kilometres is \ninadequate.  Attendance for many would be almost impossible, for \nexample the people of Kurundugahetekma would take about 4 hours by \npublic transport to get to the meeting in Panadura, furthermore the cost \nwould also be a factor. \niv).  Those being affected were not advised that the EIA was available in the \nPradeshiya  Sabha  or  the Divisional Secretariat in Bandaragama or Galle.  \nEven if it were, a programme of educating the villagers on the rationale \nbehind the road should have been carried out prior to the final traces being \ndecided. \nv).  RDA senior officials told local villagers in the Bandaragama area that the \nExpressway was not coming through the Gelanigama area. \nvi).  The first people in the South heard was when Notices under the Land \nAcquisition Act were issued to them more than a year after the EIA was \nissued and long after the Loan was approved.  \nvii).  In the North some were told of its possibility more than one year after the \nEIA was issued and many, almost two years after it was issued.  \nviii).  The Divisional Secretary of Bandaragama, two years after the EIA was \nissued and approved told a newspaper published on April 22nd 2001 that \n\u201cThe problem is they have changed the route of the Expressway several \ntimes \u2026and [he] was therefore unable to identify those who would be \naffected.\u201d   \nix).  People were informed, they were not consulted, they were only told their \nhomes and lands would be lost. \n \nThe lack of involvement means the EIA does not meet the requirements of OM sec. \n20/OP Para 2, this is a violation of the Bank Policy. \n \nf) Much of the data was out of date as it had been compiled prior to December 1996. \n \nThe EIA was based mainly on data that had been collected prior to December 1996 \nand at the time of review in 1999 it was out of date.  It was inaccurate regarding all \nsocial data, for example, number of houses to be destroyed, costs of replacement \nhousing, agricultural production etc.  This is a violation of the Bank Policy. \n \ng) SEIA is inadequate \n \nAccording to Bank Policies a Summary Environmental Impact Assessment must be \nprepared ADB OM sec. 20/OP Para 3. \n \nThe SEIA was produced from the EIA but referred to the Combined Trace ignoring \nthe decision to change to the Original Trace in the Bandaragama area.  There is a \nCRP Request Policy Breaches    3 ", "Appendix 1 \nreference to the Original Trace in Paragraph 41, where it is considered unsuitable, as \nit would create \u201ca greater need for resettlement\u201d.   \n \n \nADB Management has contended that the SEIA covered a some three kilometre wide \nband.  The SEIA was based on the EIA which had studies of a 200 metre (or less) \ncorridor with some environmental data up to a 2 km wide band.  The SEIA has no \ndata from outside the EIA band other than very general comments like \u201c the project \nare is tropical, the environment is generally quiet\u201d.  The SEIA is therefore really only \ncovering a maximum of 2 km.  If the 3km band were accepted as being covered by the \nSEIA for ADB purposes, then the band \u201ccentred on the Combined Trace\u201d does not \ncover the Final Trace.  The FT is more than 1\u00bd km away (nearly 3 km in many \nplaces) from the Combined Trace, particularly in the Bandaragama area. \n \nThe lack of an SEIA for the area of the Final Trace is a violation of the Bank Policy. \n \nAs is clear from the points above the Bank approved a loan for a category A project \nwithout an adequate EIA or SEIA.   This is a violation of the bank Policy on \nEnvironmental Considerations mentioned above. \n \nh) SEIA presented to the Board and EIA do not cover Final Trace \n \nUnder Clause 4 of the OM20/OP there is a requirement to present the SEIA to the \nBoard 120 days before it considers the project.  The SEIA presented to the Board does \nnot cover the area of the Final Trace, an SEIA for another area cannot be said to fulfil \nthis requirement.   \n \nClause 4 also requires the EIA to be made available to the Board and to locally \naffected people and NGOs.  As there is no EIA for the FT this was not done. \n \nThe lack of an SIA and an EIA means the project does not meet the requirements of \nOM sec. 20/OP Para 4, this is a violation of the Bank Policy. \n \ni) Government environmental requirements must be complied with. \n \nParagraph 14 (i) of OM 20/OP requires that Government environmental requirements \nmust be met.  The Supreme Court Judgement stated that the requirements of the \nNational Environmental Act had not been met.  That the Alterations required approval \nbe done afresh.  As this was not done it cannot be said that the Government \nEnvironmental requirements had been met. \n \nThis is a violation of OM 20/OP Paragraph 14 (i). \n \nj) Alterations have changed the viability. \n \nParagraph 14 (ii)(b)  requires that any changes carried out during the detail design \nstage should not change the financial and economic viability of the project.  \nAlterations made during the detailed design stage have changed the viability.  Firstly \nby more than doubling the cost and secondly by reducing the benefit as a result of \nmoving the trace away from the sources of traffic which was the reason for the CT \naccording to the Feasibility Study. \nCRP Request Policy Breaches    4 ", "  Appendix 1 \n \n \nIf the Government did give such an assurance as is required under Para 14 (ii)  \n(b), then it was breached.  In any case the changes made violate the Policy of the \nBank. \n \nTO SUMMARISE \u2013 There is no EIA for the Final Trace the one approved by the \nCEA does not cover the area in which the Expressway is being constructed and is out \nof date.  There was no public consultation.  Many of the items required to be covered \nby an EIA were not covered.  The SEIA is based on the EIA with minimal additional \ninformation.  It does not cover the FT.  The legal governmental requirements of Sri \nLanka were not met. \n \nThese are violations of the bank's policy. \n \n \nOM Section 50/BP Involuntary Resettlement \n \nOM Section 50/BP Para 2 says, \"Involuntary resettlement should be an important \nconsideration in project identification.  For any project that requires relocating people \nresettlement should be an integral part of project design and should be dealt with from \nthe earliest stages of the project cycle, taking into account the following principles: \n \n(i) Involuntary resettlement should be avoided where feasible. \n \n(ii) When population displacement is unavoidable, it should be minimized by \nexploring all viable project options. \n \n(iii) If individuals or a community must lose their land...they should be...(c) assisted \nso that their economic and social future will generally be at least as favourable with \nthe project as without it.  Appropriate land, housing, infrastructure, and other \ncompensation, comparable to the without-project situation should be provided to the \nadversely affected population....\" \n \na)  Bank Policy requires resettlement to be avoided where possible.  A trace through \nabandoned paddy fields for much of its length beside high-tension cables has not \nbeen used.  This would have AVOIDED resettlement.  The Bolgoda Lake Leisure \narea used to excuse the move in the North is many kilometres away.  Subsequent \nexcuse of \u2018wetlands\u2019 is not justified according to wetland experts.  In the South \nthe Combined Trace does not touch the Koggala lagoon.  There are roads \nsurrounding the Lagoon.  The Combined Trace is outside those roads.  If any \nmove were needed to avoid some associated \u201cwetlands\u201d then a move of less than \n200 meters would have sufficed.   \n \nNot using the Combined Trace is a violation of OM Section 50/BP Para 2 sub (i). \n \nb)  A trace that would minimize the resettlement has not been used.  In the Northern \ndeviation Resettlement has been increased from 40 to 267.  In the Southern \ndeviation Resettlement has increased from 51 to 476.  An increase is confirmed in \nRRP Appendix E Para 41.  \u201cWhile the original RDA alternative would have many \nof the same environmental consequences as the project corridor, it would result in \na greater need of resettlement.\u201d \nCRP Request Policy Breaches    5 ", "Appendix 1 \n \nThe OT as marked on the ground and as described in the EIA would have less \nResettlement than the FT.  The FT has no financial, social, technical or \nenvironmental benefits to excuse the multiplied Resettlement. \n \nUse of the FT is a violation of OM Section 50/BP Para 2 sub (ii). \n \nc)  No land is being given to farmers to replace their lands being taken.  As their land \nis their cultural heritage and is a major source of income and food supply to their \nfamilies the non provision of alternate land means that appropriate land as \nrequired by policy is not being supplied. \n \nThis is a violation of OM Section 50/BP Para 2 sub (iii). \n \nd)  The payments of compensation made to people resettled in the Matara area in \nMarch 2001 and since in many many other areas is not in any way sufficient to \nensure their economic and social future would be at least as favourable as without \nthe project.  Many people are not even able to construct a home for themselves \nand are living in temporary sheds with no money to complete even a basic home.    \nFor details see the Additional Evidence given to the SPF on 26th June 2004.   \n \nThis is a violation of OM Section 50/BP Para 2 sub (iii). \n \ne)  Many Relocation sites have no water or electricity, in some cases not even the \nland is levelled or roads cut.  These are required under OM Section 50/BP Para 2 \nsub (iii) (b) \n \nThis is a violation of OM Section 50/BP Para 2 sub (iii). \n \nf)  OM Section 50/OP Paragraph 1 states \u201cAn initial social assessment (ISA) is \nrequired for every development project in order to identify the people who may be \nbeneficially or adversely affected by the project.\u201d \n \nNo ISA was carried out in the areas of the deviations now being used as the FT. \n \nThis is a violation of OM Section 50/OP Paragraph 1. \n \ng)  OM Section 50/OP Para 2 goes on to say  \"If the ISA identifies that resettlement is \nlikely to be involved in the project a resettlement plan should be prepared, \npreferably in conjunction with preparation of the project feasibility study.\" \n \nThe Resettlement Plan as attached to the RRP does not cover the FT.  It is based upon \nthe SIA, which covers the CT only.  This is a violation of the above policy. \n \nh)  The Policy requires that those involuntarily resettled should be equal or better off.  \nThose resettled all appear to be considerably worse off, even those over a year \nafter being resettled. \n \nThis is a violation of OM Section 50/OP Paragraph 2. \n \n \nCRP Request Policy Breaches    6 ", "  Appendix 1 \n \nOM Section 40/BP Formulation and Implementation of Loan Covenants  \n \nIn the Loan Agreement Schedule 6 there are a series of covenants regarding \nResettlement.  Most of these are being violated, most notably the requirement to \nmaintain the standard of living and compensation prior to their relocation.  The RDA \nand local government officials are consistently paying only part of the compensation \nbefore relocation.  Standards of living are much worse. \n \nOM Section 40/BP Paragraph 5 regarding non-compliance recommends as a \nminimum to seek corrective measures.  This is not being done and is a violation of \nOM section  40/BP paragraph 5. \n \n \nOM Section 47/BP Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations  \n \nWithin the area covered by the Road there is Poverty, many old people and Single \nWomen with household responsibilities.  \u201cIt is the Bank's Policy to focus on \npeople\u2026\u201d  OM Section 47/BP Paragraph 2.  None of the FT has been reviewed, \ninvestigated or specifically taken into account in the Planning of the Project.  The \nSocial Impact Assessment covered only the Combined Trace.   \n \nThis is a violation of OM Section 47/BP Para 2. \n \nParagraph 2 goes on to say that this focus will be done \u201c\u2026by giving specific \nconsideration to social dimensions\u2026\u201d.  \u201cThe specific social dimensions identified for \nsuch consideration are ..(ii) enhancement of the role of women in development, \u2026 \n(iv)  avoiding or mitigating the adverse effects of development on vulnerable groups.\u201d \n \nIn the Resettlement of Affected Persons along the Southern section many examples of \nharm being done to women, children and old people has been seen and continues to be \nseen.  These include the destruction of their homes, the failure to supply \naccomodation of any kind or give compensation.  For example a Widow and her \nfamily were left without a home, toilet facilities or access to water for months.  She \nwas forced to live in a shack of wooden posts covered with black polythene sheet \nalong with her three children.  After living like this for a long period the RDA \neventually constructed a house for her and she was rehoused. \n \nThese are violations of OM Section 47/BP Para 2. \n \nOM Section 47/BP Para 3 states \u201c\u2026 the Bank will seek to (i) help the poor by \nproviding \u2026 (b) improved access to \u2026 water supply, sanitation, \u2026\u201d  The RDA or \ntheir contractors have removed \u2018poor\u2019 from their houses, closed off their wells, buried \ntheir toilets and not replaced them, let alone given improved access. \n \nThis is a violation of OM Section 47/BP Para 3. \n \nParagraph 3 continues, \u201c\u2026 help women \u2026 increase \u2026 their share in the rewards of \ndevelopment.\u201d  The destruction of their homes without replacement or compensation \nwill not have done this. \n \nThis is a violation of OM Section 47/BP Para 3. \nCRP Request Policy Breaches    7 ", "Appendix 1 \n \nParagraph 4 (i) very specifically states that  \u201c...the Bank will encourage a sense of \nownership ... on the part of ... people adversely affected by adopting a participatory \ndevelopment process in which the stakeholders are provided opportunities to actively \ninfluence and share control over the project and decisions that affect them at all stages \nof the project cycle, beginning with project identification.\" \n \nNo consultation was done at the stage of project identification or planning for those \nAffected on the FT.  More than eighteen months after the decision on the trace was \ntaken some of the Affected Persons were told that they would have  \u2018to lose their land \nand houses\u2019.  They were told not to complain as this was of no use.  Others were not \ntold at all.   \n \nThis is a violation of the bank's policy for participation and consultation OM Section \n47/BP  Para  4 sub (i) . \n \nParagraph 4 (ii) \u201c.. the bank will conduct gender analysis  ...\u201d  This has not been done, \nnobody has visited the area to do this.  Representatives of the RDA visit houses along \nthe Trace and tell the occupants that they will be losing their houses.  Data has been \ncollected from a limited number who sign a document which could affects their rights.  \nThe lack of analysis is a violation of OM Section 47/BP Para 4 sub (ii). \n \nParagraph 4 (iii) \"...The Bank will conduct where necessary a social analysis during \nthe preparation, of a project so as to ensure that the project design and implementation \nreflect the needs, demands and absorption capacities of the affected people.\" \n \nA social analysis is necessary given the numbers of affected persons, but none has \nbeen carried out in the 40% of the Project which has been altered.  This is a violation \nof OM Section 47/BP Para  4  sub (iii). \n \nParagraph 6 states \u201cReviews will be undertaken during the initial years of project \nimplementation.... to assess the participation of stakeholders...\u201d  No such reviews have \nbeen carried out to our knowledge.  We as stakeholders have had to fight to be \ninformed or heard.  This is a violation of OM Section 47/BP Para 6. \n \n \nOM Section 47/OP Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations  \n \nParagraph 5 states \u201cThe process of identifying potential beneficiaries and people \nlikely to be adversely affected will start right at the stage of project identification.\u201d  \nAs the project was intended to be developed elsewhere the identification of those \nlikely to be affected was not started at the correct time, if started at all. \n \nThis is a violation of OM Section 47/OP Para 5. \n \nOM Section 47/OP Paragraph 6 states, \u201cAn Initial Social Assessment is required for \nevery development project in order to identify the people who may be \u2026 adversely \naffected\u2026\u201d  The project was intended to be done elsewhere, an ISA was not done on \nthe FT. \n \nThis is a violation of OM Section 47/OP Para 6. \nCRP Request Policy Breaches    8 ", "  Appendix 1 \n \n \nOM Section 47/OP Paragraph 7 states, \u201cThe Social Analysis must examine all socio-\neconomic facets that may be important \u2026\u201d  No Social Analysis was carried out on the \nFT. \n \nThis is a violation of OM Section 47/OP Para 7. \n \n \nOM Section 54/BP Governance \n \na) Accountability under section A Paragraph 5 states that the Public Officials are \naccountable for their actions.  We have been told by several senior RDA officials that \nthey are neither accountable nor responsible for the work they are doing.  As \nexamples:- all the following have declared themselves as following instructions \nthereby indicating that they are not responsible for the actions they are taking: Mr \nOpanayake who was the Project Engineer for the Northern Section of the Expressway \nduring most of its planning and now works on the Outer Colombo Highway Project,  \nMr Serasinghe who was in charge of the Resettlement for the Northern Section,  Mr \nImmaduwa, Land Officer of the RDA during the early part of the development. Mr \nMoses Project Engineer. \n \nParagraph 14 requires the Bank to \u201cfocus on (i) public sector management (i.e. the \noverall functioning of Government, including line ministries, departments and \nagencies.)\u201d.  The lack of focus on this is a violation of the bank's policy OM Section \n54/BP Para 14. \n \nb) Participation Section B Paragraph 7, says that Government structures should be \n\u201cflexible enough to offer beneficiaries and affected persons the opportunity to \nimprove the design and implementation of ... projects.\u201d  This is clearly not so in the \ncase of RDA as no participation has been permitted. \n \nParagraph 15 requires the Bank to \u201csupport (i) involvement of beneficiaries and \naffected groups in development programs and projects,\".  The lack of support is a \nviolation of Bank policy OM Section 54/BP Para 15. \n \nc) Paragraph 8 states that participation should include non-government organisation \n(NGOs).  No attempt was made to use the local NGOs to establish an optimal trace.  \nWe as NGOs receive no recognition from the RDA.  No attempt at any sort of \ndiscussion has been made with any of our constituent NGOs or ourselves. \n \nParagraph 15 also says, \u201cthe Bank will support  ...  (iv) cooperation with NGOs.\"  The \nlack of support is a violation of Bank policy OM Section 54/BP Para 15. \n \nd) Section D Transparency Paragraph 10, the ADB is certainly aware that the \navailability of information from the RDA and CEA has not been up to even the lowest \nstandard of disclosure.  The ADB, by accepting this, has violated its policy. \n \nA) All the RDA has supplied are blue leaflets outlining the compensation package in \nvery general terms. \n \nCRP Request Policy Breaches    9 ", "Appendix 1 \nB) No Resettlement Plan is available with either the Divisional Secretary or the Local \nRDA resettlement office.  Requests for this have been denied.  We, our societies and \nour representatives have asked the ADB to supply this or to arrange its supply.  One \ncopy has been supplied to us by ADB. \nC) Only two meetings in Bandaragama of the RDA with the Affected Persons have \nbeen held in the village after the initial announcement in Feb. 2001, the second was in \nAugust 2004. \n \nD) The CEA had two public meetings along a stretch of 128 Km. for discussions \nregarding the Expressway.  Notices were published only in the Government controlled \nNewspapers.  People who are to be Affected were not invited.  All those present were \nfrom the Combined Trace which is now not being used. \n \nE) The CEA letter approving the Expressway is not a public document and has to be \nspecially requested.  This letter materially affected us. \n \nF) GSS have not even had acknowledgement to their letter dated 18th July 2001 to the \nADB Resident Mission in Colombo. \n \nG) The fact that Affected People were informed long after the trace was decided and \nwere only informed that their properties would be acquired and not allowed to \ncomment, confirms there was no Transparency. \n \nH) People who have been dispossessed have not had access to the Resettlement \nImplementation Plan (RIP) or the entitlement matrix.  Neither have they been given a \nbreakdown of the compensation paid to them. \n \nI) The RIP is not available in Sinhala in any place, including the RDA head office, \neven though both ADB and RDA said in 2001 that copies were available in all \nDivisional Secretariats. \n \nParagraph 17 requires the Bank to \u201cfocus on disclosure of information.\u201d  The lack of \nfocus on this is a violation of the bank's policy OM Section 54/BP Para 16. \n \nThere is a focus on non-disclosure.  One of the fundamental documents in this is the \nFeasibility Report.  The ADB Management in making its case has used the Feasibility \nReport.  This presumably contains a lot about the Expressway that would allow an \nunderstanding and clarity in dealing with the issue.  A copy was requested on 18th \nMay 2003 and it took until 28th October 2003 to refuse it as apparently the GOSL had \nrefused to give its permission.  As the ADB is aware the GoSL has a disclosure bill in \npreparation  which mandates the disclosure of this sort of document.  It seems \nunlikely and certainly wrong that the ADB despite this rejects the publication.  It \nshould also be noted that in the revision of the disclosure policy this would be an item \nthat would not need Government permission to release.  With the focus on disclosure \nit seems strange that it is not released. \n \nEconomic Effect of Poor Governance \n \nThe Affected Persons have not been allowed to participate in the process, and \ntransparency has been poor particularly as there is a lack of Accountability amongst \nthe Senior Project Managers.   \nCRP Request Policy Breaches    10 ", "  Appendix 1 \n \n \nThe five deaths at a protest on the construction of the Katunayake Expressway \nunderlines the risks involved.  The protesters have been all too willing to protect their \nproperty.  One widow had discovered men in her house and challenged them.  They \nwere surveyors who had entered without her knowledge.  The Police locked her up \novernight.  Court Proceedings have still not been completed. \n \nLack of support for participation to affected groups \n \nThe Bank is required under OM Section 54/BP Para 15 to support Affected Persons.  \nOur society has written to your Sri Lanka Mission and not even received a reply.  \nLetters from over 150 Affected Persons to President Chino complaining have not been \nanswered, though 51 have definitely been received.   \nAfter copies were supplied to the Resident Mission they were still reluctant to reply.  \nThe Support has not been delivered.   \n \nThe Bank has violated its policy by not providing support. \n \n \nOM Section 36/BP Economic Analysis  \n \nOM Section 36/BP requires an Economic Analysis be carried out.  Bank Policy OM \nSection 36/OP states that \"... economic analysis of projects cover the following \nsteps...(iii) forecasting effective demand for project outputs, (iv) choosing least-cost \ndesign for meeting demand...(v) determining whether economic benefits provide an \nadequate return on economic costs,...\"  \n \na) Forecasting demand was done without proper consideration as required by point \n(iii). \n \nForecasts are incorrect as the traffic forecasts are made assuming the use of the \nCombined Trace which is closer to the coast where higher volumes of traffic exist.  \nThe reason for the consultants suggesting the Combined Trace was to pick up the \nincreased traffic volumes and make it economical.  The trace changes, both in the \nNorth and the South will reduce traffic therefore the model should be redone. \n \nThe shifting of the trace in the North caused the link of the Expressway to the coastal \nhighway via the Outer Colombo Highway to be cancelled.  This will reduce the traffic \nwilling to drive the additional 10 kms through villages on a two-lane road to join the \nExpressway.  Undoubtedly it will significantly reduce the traffic which would join \nfrom the Coast and be heading for Central Colombo or North Colombo.  Also traffic \njoining further South heading for Southern and Central Colombo. \n \nIn the South the entrance to Galle has been cancelled following the change to the \ntrace.  Access to the major hospital in the South has been removed.  These will reduce \nthe use and value of the Expressway to the many citizens in the South whom the \nSTDP is claiming to benefit. \n \nThe model does not seem to take account of the most logical junctions to be used by \nvehicles turning off the Highway for different parts of Colombo.  The majority will be \nheading for the Centre and will need to leave and enter at km10.31.  Only Port, \nCRP Request Policy Breaches    11 ", "Appendix 1 \nAirport and Kandy bound traffic will continue beyond this point.  Traffic leaving at \nkm 6.25 is likely to be small. \n \nThe traffic growth over the years leading up to the calculation of the volume growth \nwas driven significantly by duty free and part duty free concessions given to \ngovernment employees.  The growth has dropped to half following the removal of \nthese concessions. \n \nThe above points show that the bank violated the Policy on Economic Analysis. \n \nb) Choosing the least cost design is required as part of the economic analysis Point(iv) \n \nThe cheapest design has not been chosen.  In all the documentation the CT was shown \nas the cheapest.  The FT is costing more than double in Sri Lanka Rupee terms.  In \ndollar terms it is almost 50% more expensive.   No analysis has been done to show the \nFT is the cheapest.  The FT is more expensive and the demand will be lower.  \nHowever no clear analysis was done of the likely position.  This is a violation of \nBank's policy. \n \nc) \u2018Adequate Return\u2019 Computation is incorrect.  Point (v) \n \n(i) The costs for the chosen trace, the FT,  have not been computed or used in the \neconomic analysis. \n \n(ii) The cost of land and resettlement of Rs.1,265m  (RRP  page  73) includes only \nRs.300m  for  Residential/Commercial  Structures  (RRP Appendix F Page 28).  For \nresidences alone the EIA shows a figure of Rs.458m for the CT and Rs.691m for the \nOT  (EIA Chapter 6 Page 49).  This is calculated at Rs.850 per sq foot which is less \nthan one third of current building costs.   \n \n(iii) The Resettlement Implementation Plan gives a new cost for land and resettlement \nof Rs. 2,861, more than double that given in the RRP. We are told that even the \ncurrent budget for Resettlement is insufficient to meet the required compensation, and \nthe money has \u201crun out.\u201d The increase of 126% in the budget has not been updated in \nany publicly available economic analysis. \n \n(iv) In the computation a very high residual value of 80% for the road investment has \nbeen made.  This is even after twenty years.  Significant changes to the Expressway \nwill be needed long before the residual value has been brought to zero.  This decision \nsignificantly overvalues the road life remaining and affects the EIRR a great deal. \n \n(v) The revaluation of the loan repayments at the fast depreciating rate of exchange as \nrecommended under the guidelines Appendix 29 has not been done. \n \nGiven the above points it is clear the Economic Analysis is flawed and violates the \npolicies of the Bank. \n \nCRP Request Policy Breaches    12 ", "  Appendix 1 \n \n \nOM Section 22/BP  Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation \nIn order to ensure improvement in the effectiveness of the Bank's development and \nrelated investment policies, Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation has to be carried out.  \nParagraph 3 requires Benchmark Information to be collected. \n \nThis has not been done for 40% of the Project as is mentioned above.  OM Section \n22/OP Paragraph 1 allows this to be carried out in the early phases of project \nimplementation, but five years should not be necessary for that. \n \nThe bank's policy on Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation is being violated. \n \n \nOM Section 21/BP Gender and Development in Bank Operations \n \nOM Section 21/OP Para 2 states \u201cimproving the status of women is one of the five \nstrategic objectives of the Bank.\u201d  Para 4 states \u201cGender Planning - to formulate \nspecific strategies to bring about equal opportunities for men and women.  \nMainstreaming \u2013 to ensure that gender concerns and women\u2019s needs and perspectives \nare considered in all aspects of the Bank operations and that women participate in \ndevelopment activities.\u201d None of this has been considered, women are evicted from \ntheir homes along with their children.  No Bank Staff, Bank Contractors or \nConsultants, RDA staff or their Contractors or Consultants have done any survey, \nreview or any kind of research on Gender and Development on the Final Trace. \n \nThis is a violation of OM Section 21/OP. \n \nBank Policy is that gender considerations are addressed in all stages of the project \ncycle, Para 2.  OM Section 21/OP Para 7 states \u201c\u2026 gender analysis and WID \nconsiderations will be undertaken as a routine at all stages of the project cycle,\u2026\u201d  \nPara 8 requires an Initial Social Assessment for every project.  None has been done on \nthe FT.  This is a violation of Bank Policy. \n \n \nOM Section 34/BP Processing of Loan Proposals  \n \nIt is the bank's policy as stated in Para 2 and again in Para 7  \"to fully involve ... the \nproject beneficiaries\" and consequently the project affected persons  \"at all stages of \nthe project cycle beginning from project identification.\"  This has been violated as the \nBank has not involved them. \n \nPara 9 and 10 require an RRP to be prepared in line with the project to be \nimplemented, the one produced is inaccurate as it covers a different area from where \nit is being implemented.  Similarly it is clear that the one made available to the Public \nwas inaccurate. \n \n \nOM Section 38/BP Procurement of Goods and Services  \n \nWhilst the decisions under this section may be beyond the scope of CRP the \nprocedures are not excluded.  We see from the local newspapers that International \nCRP Request Policy Breaches    13 ", "Appendix 1 \nCompetitive Bidding procedures as laid down in Para 15 have not been followed.  \nThis is a violation of the above paragraph and Para 1 of Section 38/OP. \n \n \n \nOM Section 55/BP Anti-corruption \n \nUnder the process of acquisition of Land the RDA has promised large bonuses to \nlocal government officials if they manage to make arrangements for the acquisition of \nall the properties relevant to the trace.  The duty of these officials is to assist in the \nlawful acquisition and bonuses may induce them to misuse their position. \nThis is against ADB policy.  However RDA has denied this and we have been unable \nto obtain proof. \n \nThe construction company Kumagai Gumi has given goods and financial incentives to \nthe previous Project Director according to the Newspaper reports, which have not \nbeen denied.  Kumagai Gumi was disqualified in the pre-qualification review, but \nallowed to continue following a request to the Treasury Secretary by ADB. \n \nADB consultant Arthachariya interviewed affected persons and apparently advised \nthe SLRM of numbers of opposing households which are less than one tenth of the \nactual number.  This hurt the Affected People badly and helped the RDA and the \nADB as Arthacharya numbers were given to the ADB Board, to convince them that \nthere were very few opposing households.  We believe that the report was done \nfraudulently, the consequent report to the Board was also fraudulent.  We have been \nsuffering as a result of this Fraud carried out by ADB Management and one of their \nConsultants to hide the truth of the situation on STDP. \n \n \nOM Section F1/BP Environmental Considerations in ADB Operations \n \nOM Section F1/BP Para 4 states \u201cADB assists DMCs to protect the health and \nproductivity of the poor \u2026 maintaining the long term productivity of ecosystems and \nreducing their vulnerability to natural disasters.\u201d  The Expressway is being \nconstructed through large hills and deep valleys, cutting deep into these hills and \nfilling the deep valleys.  The results of this are self-evident, however the considerable \nsuffering of the people in these areas with loss of sources of water and danger from \nlandslides can be easily found from discussions with the residents. \n \nThe risk of landslides and floods was underlined with the disasters where there was \nconsiderable loss of life in areas close to the area of the Expressway. \n \nNo research has been done, no Mitigatory measures have been evaluated.  The CT, \nthe recommended and approved trace, was not through hills, it was in abandoned \npaddy fields for which the Mitigatory measures were well defined in the EIA and the \nSEIA.  \n \nParagraph 5 requires \u201cADB assists DMCs to strengthen ... and (vi) enhance education \npublic awareness and capacity building.\u201d  No such work is being done by the DMC \ngovernment or agencies connected with the GoSL or ADB. \n \nCRP Request Policy Breaches    14 ", "  Appendix 1 \n \nParagraph 8 states \u201cADB addresses the environmental aspects of its operations \nthrough systematic application of procedures for \u2026 (iv) monitoring and evaluation of \ncompliance with environmental requirements of loans;\u201d  If monitoring or evaluation \nwas being done the considerable problems visible in the construction work now being \nundertaken would not occur. \n \nOM Section F1/OP Environmental Considerations in ADB Operations \n \nParagraph 4 states \u201cADB requires environmental assessment \u2026 [it] is a process rather \nthan a one time report ... that take place throughout the project cycle.   Important \nconsiderations in undertaking environmental assessment include examining \nalternatives, identifying environmental impacts, \u2026 developing appropriate \nmanagement plans and monitoring requirements \u2026 and ensuring information \ndisclosure, meaningful public consultation and appropriate reporting of results.\u201d  This \nis not being done at all.  ADB requires this to be done, but failures reported to ADB \nare not acted upon. \n \nThis is a violation of the Environmental Safeguard Policy. \n \nPargraph 28 deals with \u201cUncertainties in Location and Alignments of Infrastructure.\u201d  \nThere is no process that has been advised to any of the Affected Persons of \u201c\u2026 the \nagreed process to be followed for environmental assessment \u2026\u201d \n \nAs this policy is new it may not have been included, but no attempt has been made to \napply it on this project. \n \n \nOM Section F2 Involuntary Resettlement \n \nWhilst the Project itself was approved and implementation started before the Policy \nwas issued there is a large volume of Resettlement that has been done after 29th \nOctober 2003.   \n \nPara 11 requires that \u201caffected people are entitled to compensation to at least restore \ntheir economic and social base\u201d.  This is not being done with most resettled people \nbeing reduced to poverty.  Some have improved, but this is the minority. \nParagraph 36 requires \u201c..affected people to be individually compensated before civil \nworks contracts are awarded or similar milestones occur.\u201d  This has not been done \nwith nearly 50% of those due for compensation not still compensated more than 1 \nyear after contracts were awarded.  Thee were no other relevant milestones. \n \nPara 45 says, \u201cPublic disclosure of resettlement plans \u2026 is mandatory.\u201d  Long after \nthe policy came into affect, long after resettlement commenced the Resettlement Plan \nis not available.   \n \nPara 45 also says that it must be \u201cin a language that they can understand\u201d the Sinhala \nversion is always being promised but never available.  In 2001 the RDA stated in a \nletter to ADB forwarded by ADB to GSS that a Sinhala version was available at every \nDivisional Secretary\u2019s Office.  In June the Chairman of RDA and other senior officers \nof RDA promised Friends of the Earth Japan in front of the Chief Representative of \nJBIC that the resettlement implementation plan would be available in SINHALA at all \nCRP Request Policy Breaches    15 ", "Appendix 1 \nDivisional Secretary\u2019s Offices within one month.  It is still not available two months \nlater. \n \nPara 46 requires Monitoring.  This cannot be happening otherwise the gross breaches \nof the Involuntary Resettlement guidelines and policies would not be so blatantly \nviolated. \n \nPara 48 requires \u201cThe CCO supported by RSES must ensure compliance with the \ninvoluntary resettlement policy\u2026\u201d  This is clearly not being done. \n \n \nOM Section J4 Loan Covenants \n \n\u201cADB is under an obligation to monitor and follow up these obligations contained in \nloan covenants.\u201d  ADB has not monitored these covenants otherwise we would not \nhave needed to advise SLRM that covenants were being breached, and had been \nbreached for a long time.   \n \nSchedule 6 to the Loan Agreement contains a series of covenants.  Clause 13(a) \nrequires that all compensation is paid prior to relocation.  This has not been done \nanywhere along the trace.  This has been violated consistently.  SLRM did not know \nabout this until Friends of the Earth Japan in the presence of the Chief Representative \nof JBIC interviewed some resettled people. \n \nClaus 12 of Schedule 6 states that the Borrower and RDA should follow the Bank\u2019s \nPolicy on Resettlement.  This has not been done.  SLRM and Manila office should \nhave insisted that the RDA correct the situation. \n \nParagraph 9 requires that all Land Acquisition was completed within 12 months of \nsigning the civil works contract.  As this was extremely unlikely when cases were \nbefore the Court ADB should not have permitted the signing of the Contract.  It is not \npossible they were not aware that cases were in Court. \n \nADB had not been monitoring as required by OM Section J4 Loan Covenants  \n \nUnder paragraph 6 of the OM on Loan Covenants there is a requirement to seek \ncorrective measures.  As these Covenants have been breached for a long period the \nADB by now should have reached the legal remedy stage, and yet they are still only at \nthe discussion stage. \n \nADB has not been seeking remedies for breaches as required by OM Section J4 Loan \nCovenants. \n \n \nThe above list of breaches and violations is not exhaustive but indicative of the \nvery large number and importance of the breaches and violations ADB has \ncommitted or allowed to be committed. \n \n \nCRP Request Policy Breaches    16 ", "  Appendix 2 \nMAP \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20041218025225Z", "ModDate": "D:20041218105707+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 5.0.5 (Windows)", "Author": "mav", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Title": "Microsoft Word - STDP Eligibility Report - 16 Dec. 2004.doc"}}
