If  approved,  the  Project  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first \nprivate  sector  project  to  provide  assistance  to  municipal  district  energy  systems  (DES).  It  will \nconstitute  ADB\u2019s  21st  nonsovereign  assistance  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nDistrict Energy System \n\n1. \n\nEnergy Efficiency in Heating and Cooling   \n\n2. \nUrban areas are responsible for about 75% of all energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemissions in the world. Buildings account for nearly 40% of GHG emissions worldwide, and close \nto  70%  in  cities  like  New  York  and  London.  Improving  energy  efficiency  in  buildings  with \nappropriate  technologies  determines  the  pattern  of  energy  use  for  many  years.  Substantial \nprogress is being made in increasing the energy efficiency of individual buildings. Beyond these \nimprovements, major opportunities are available through the broader rebuilding of an integrated \napproach of DES to the planning, construction and operation of these systems. The integration of \nenergy  generation  and  use  occurs  not  only  within  energy  end  users  (such  as  buildings  or \nindustrial  installations)  but  also  between  (a  variety  of)  energy  end  users.  Linking  buildings \ntogether using pipelines enables installation of a central plant that is more economically viable \nand environment friendly. Heated or chilled water is piped underground from the central plant to \nindividual buildings within a designated area for heating, cooling, or industrial use.   \n \n3. \nUse  of  DES,  including  integrated  centralized  combined  heat  and  power  (CHP),  is \nrecognized as one of the most significant ways to maximize the efficiency of heating and cooling \nand the electricity generation process. It provides the means to (i) use the waste heat and save \nenergy while displacing the need for additional heat generating plants; and (ii) share heat loads, \nthereby  using  the  plant  more  effectively  and  efficiently.  Typically  the  pipeline  network  is \ndeveloped  over  time  with  heat-only  boilers  used  in  the  early  years.  Later  when  the  network \ncoverage reaches a critical mass, the network is to be connected to centralized CHP plant, which \nallows  significant  reduction  of  fuel  consumption  based  on  recycling  of  surplus  heat  from  the \npower station. Furthermore, some of the heat from the CHP generator is utilized in an absorption \nchiller to produce cold water. The water is circulated through insulated mains to provide cooling \nto the various end users. An ice storage system can be added to this scheme to meet peak load \ndemands.1 \n \nSince  1983,  the  International  Energy  Agency  (IEA)2  has  promoted  DES  with  CHP  to \n4. \nreduce  GHG  emissions,  promote  sustainable  development,  and  reduce  vulnerability  to  supply \ndisruptions. Some countries, particularly in Scandinavia, have a significant penetration of district \n                                                 \n1   The ice store will be frozen at night using chillers driven by electricity from the CHP generators. The ice will be used \n\nto provide cooling during the day. \n\n2   District Heating and Cooling including the Integration of CHP has been one of seven building-related implementing \n\narrangements operating under the auspices of the IEA. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nheating\u2014more than 50% of the heat market. Increasingly, in many parts of the world the DES \nconcept is being implemented for cooling. In the United States and other countries where cooling \nis important, use of district cooling has grown significantly. \n \n\n2. \n\nDistrict Heating in the PRC \n\n5. \nIn  the  PRC,  heating  needs  for  households  and  industries  have  been  met  mainly  by \ncoal-fired stoves and heat-only boilers. Since household stoves have very low efficiency and are \nnot  convenient  or  safe,  the  PRC  started  implementing  a  unique  district  heating  system  in  the \n1950s.  It  involves  a  large  number  of  smaller  plants  directly  linked  to  localized  heat  networks, \nwhich  cover  a  relatively  small  area.  Under  the  centrally  planned  and  controlled  economy, \nproviding heating during the winter was considered a general welfare service, which was priced \nbelow the cost of providing services. \n \n6. \nSuccessful economic reforms and significant growth of the overall PRC economy have \naccelerated  urbanization  and  increased  heating  demand.  The  PRC  is  now  the  second  largest \ndistrict  heating  market  behind  the  Russian  Federation.  It  is  comparable  to  27  countries  of  the \nEuropean  Union  combined  and  5.5  times  larger  than  the  United  States  market.  Yet  district \nheating  represents  only  about  30%  of  the  floor  area  even  in  northern  cities,  leaving  a  large \nservice  area  still  served  by  decentralized  systems.  Compared  to  the  55%\u201360%  penetration  in \nEuropean  countries,  this  presents substantial opportunities  for  further  expansion.  Total  heated \nfloor area reached 2.5 billion m2 in 2005 and is expected to reach 3.6 billion m2 in 2010 and 7.5 \nbillion m2 in 2020. \n \nGrowing  demand  for  district  heating  has  highlighted  the  energy  inefficiency  and \n7. \nenvironmental concerns under the current heating system. In most cities, the operation is still run \nby municipally owned utility companies which have neglected minimum level of investment and \nmaintenance for lack of adequate finance. The aging pipeline network caused 233,000 general \nfailures in district heating networks in 140 cities and 1,400 serious breakdowns from 2001\u20132005. \nThe  majority  of  end  users  receive  heat  directly  from  the  heat  source  at  low  temperature.  The \noperations tend to be intermittent which further decreases the temperature of the circulating hot \nwater.  To  obtain  heated  water  sooner,  end  users  often  dispose  of  the  circulating  water.  This \ntogether  with  leakage  due  to  the  aging  pipeline  network  causes  significant  water  loss\u2014about \n8\u201330  times  higher  than  a  modern  DES  system.  Furthermore,  the  existing  heating  system  has \nrelatively  high  thermal  heat  losses  due  to  oversize  pipe  diameters,  pumps,  valves,  and \nsubstations.   \n \n8. \nHousehold  stoves  have  very  low  efficiency  (less  than  30%).  Under  the  current  district \nheating system, heat (hot water) is typically sourced by many small coal-fired heat-only boilers \n(as opposed to centralized CHP) with boiler house capacity of 2\u201314 megawatts (MW) or 3\u201320 \ntons  of  steam/hour,  which  are  also  inefficient  (40%\u201345%).  Because  stove  and  boiler \nsmokestacks are not tall and not equipped with adequate pollution control devices, they directly \ndisperse smoke into the air near residences, creating health problems. During the winter, black \nsmoke  commonly  floats  in  the  air,  and  fly  ash  covers  districts  in  northern  cities.  Despite  the \nGovernment  efforts  to  replace  small  boilers  with  central  heating  systems,  more  than  500,000 \nsmall coal-fired heat-only boilers are still in operation in the country. These heating systems, in \naddition to numerous coal-fired boilers and stoves used by individual households and industries, \nconsume almost half of the country's coal and are the largest single-point sources of urban air \npollution.  The  resulting  local,  national,  and  global  environmental  impact  could  be  substantial. \nSulfur  dioxide  (SO2)  and  particulates  produced  through  coal  combustion  are  two  major  air \npollutants, resulting in the formation of acid rain, which now falls on about 30% of the PRC's total \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nlandmass.  From  a  long-term  global  perspective,  the  main  environmental  problem  is  GHG \nemission.3 \n \n\n3. \n\nDistrict Cooling in the PRC \n\n9. \nIn  the  PRC,  air  conditioners  supply  the  cooling  needs  of  households  and  industries. \nEnergy  demand  for  cooling  is  growing  rapidly  to  support  the  living  standards  of  the  large \npopulation. During  the 1990s,  household  electricity  consumption  tripled,  growing  by  an  annual \naverage  of  14%.  Improving  the  energy  efficiency  of  air-conditioning  systems,  which  on  hot \nsummer days account for up to 40% of major cities' entire power load, is one of the most effective \nmeasures the municipalities can take to decrease energy usage and mitigate air pollution, given \nthat 82% of electricity is now produced by burning coal. District cooling is an untapped area of \nenergy  efficiency  in  the  PRC;  its  use  improves  energy  efficiency,  flexibility,  and  reliability  with \nsharing redundancy ensures minimum disruption. Economies of scale result in the need for less \nequipment by grouping of small equipments and sharing of redundant capacity, lower manpower \nrequirement, and also less maintenance costs. Each building can access the capacity needed \nand  reduce  its  initial  capital  investment,  operation,  and  management.  Furthermore,  space \nformerly occupied by ventilating and air-conditioning equipment will be available for commercial \nuse.   \n\n4. \n\nPolicies and Regulations \n\n10. \nIn  the  1980s,  the  PRC  Government  began  studying  and  making  efforts  to  address  the \nchallenges  of  prospective  energy  supply  shortages  and  environmental  degradation  stemming \nfrom  the  PRC\u2019s  fast-growing  economy.  The  Government  recognizes  district  heating  as  an \nimportant area for reform because of its significant impact on energy conservation, air pollution, \nand  standard  of  living.  Since  1986  the  PRC  has  strengthened  the  regulatory  framework  to \nencourage,  support,  and  develop  district  heating  emphasizing  on  CHP  as  the  preferred \ntechnology. Provisional Ordinance on Energy Saving and Management in 1986 demanded that \nurban  heating  should  choose  more  efficient  production  processes  or  advanced  equipments  to \nreplace inefficient systems. Soon after, the State Council issued Special Order No. 22 in 1986, \noutlining a policy encouraging the rebuilding of urban district heating using CHP to replace small \ncoal-fired heating boilers and household stoves.       \n \n11.  With  the  recent  energy  intensity4  increase  since 2001,  the  Government  recognizes  the \nurgent need to invest in and significantly improve energy efficiency. From its previous emphasis \non energy exploitation, the national energy policy now assigns top priority to energy conservation \nand  energy  efficiency.  Expanding  investment  in  energy  efficiency  projects  is  a  high  priority  for \nenvironmental sustainability and enterprise competitiveness. The Government seeks to promote \nmarket-based methods to deliver and finance energy efficiency projects in partnership with the \nprivate sector.   \n \n12. \nIn  2003,  the  Ministry  of  Construction  (MOC),  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission  (NDRC),  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration,  and  five  other  central \ngovernment  agencies  jointly  issued  a  document  (MOC[2003]-148)  for  heating  system  reform.   \nThe objectives are to (i) gradually transform current welfare-based heating services to be more \nmarket-oriented consistent with the PRC\u2019s socialist market economic development; (ii) continue \n                                                 \n3   Energy  consumption  accounts  for  more  than  80%  of  the  PRC\u2019s  GHG  emissions.  Emissions  of  carbon  from  coal \ncombustion are estimated to increase from 820 million tons in 2000 to more than 1.1 billion tons in 2010 and more \nthan 1.8 billion tons in 2020 if environmental issues are not properly addressed. Even then PRC\u2019s CO2 emissions \nper capita would amount to only 20% of that of OECD countries in 2010 and 30% in 2020. \n\n4   Energy intensity is calculated as units of energy per unit of GDP. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nto develop and implement more efficient heating technologies and energy-efficient buildings; and \n(iii)  develop  a  healthy  urban  heating  service  system  to  meet  demand  for  increased  quality  of \nliving  standards,  and  support  sustainable  urban  development  in  the  PRC.  Activities  include  (i) \ntransforming the welfare-based heating services system to a commodity-based heating service \nsystem; (ii) improving the efficiency of heat supply, transmission, distribution, and building heat \nconsumption; (iii) reducing the environmental impacts of urban heating; (iv) continuing to expand \neconomic, safe, environmentally compatible, and highly efficient central urban heating systems; \nand (v) accelerating reform, introducing competition, and developing a commercial urban heating \nservice market.   \n \n13. \nThe  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  strengthens  the  policy  orientation  to  energy \nconservation,  high-efficiency  use,  and  energy  security.  The  large  energy  efficiency  potential  is \nseen  as  a  great  opportunity  to  obtain  some  flexibility  in  the  PRC\u2019s  dependency  on  external \nsources  of  energy.  By  2010,  the  Government  aims  to  improve  energy  intensity  by  20%  and \nreduce  SO2  emissions  by  10%  compared  with  2005  levels.  Achieving  these  targets  requires \nmajor policy changes that would revitalize investment in energy efficiency throughout the PRC. A \nnumber of steps have been taken to support this target. During the 11th Five-Year Plan period \n(2006\u20132010), the PRC aims to increase heat supply from CHP in district heating systems from \n20% to 50% and increase district heating market penetration from 30% to 50%.   \n \nThe  Medium-  and  Long-Term  Energy  Conservation  Plan  highlights  key  sectors  and \n14. \nprovides  a  conceptual  road  map  for  improving  energy  efficiency.  The  plan  puts  forward  10 \nspecific types of energy efficiency projects, and identifies district heating and CHP generation as \none  of  the  key  fields  of  energy  conservation.  Specifically,  it  aims  to  replace  the  current  heat \nsupply  generated  by  scattered  small  coal-burning  boilers  with  district  heating  using  CHP  units \nwith environmental protection features. It plans to achieve annual energy savings of 35 million \ntons of coal equivalent (tce) by 2020.   \n \nIn  2007,  the  NDRC  and  MOC  jointly  issued  Interim  Measures  for  the  Price  Control  of \n15. \nUrban Heat Supply,5  which guides the pricing of heat supplies in urban administrative areas. It \nstates that the state further encourages private investors to invest in CHP and district heat supply \nfacilities,  constructions,  and  operations.  Urban  heat  price  comprises  the  cost  of  heat  supply, \ntaxes, and profit. The heat supplier can request tariff increases to maintain an adequate profit.   \n \n\n5. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\nUnder  the  central  Government\u2019s  guidance,  many  cities  are  obligated  to  close  down \n16. \ndecentralized  small  heat-only  boilers  completely  by  2010  and  connect  the  associated  heated \narea to the centralized DES. To replace small boilers with more energy\u2013efficient CHP generation \nfacilities, the pipeline network should be rehabilitated and expanded so that the CHP can be fully \nutilized. This will require an investment of CNY200 billion over the next 5 years. Many cities are \nhaving difficulty in securing adequate funding.   \n \n17. \nInvolving  the  private  sector  in  the  modernization  of  the  management  of  district  heating \nmanagement companies is acknowledged as a priority to achieve the energy\u2013saving objectives \nand profitability allowing further investment in infrastructure. The Government has taken active \nsteps  to  develop  more  uniform  policies  to  promote  a  market  orientation  and  the  use  of  more \nenergy\u2013efficient  technologies.  Moreover,  complementary  reforms  in  housing  and  construction, \nsuch as higher standards for heat efficiency in new buildings and a shift to individually owned \n\n                                                 \n5    Measures issued by NDRC have the force of law in the PRC.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nhousing  units,  was  implemented  in  order  to  improve  operator  revenues.  The  Government \nrecently  stepped  up  efforts  to  encourage  private  sector  participation  in  district  heating \ninfrastructure as one of the priorities in the restructuring of state-owned enterprises. In 2003 the \nGovernment  opened  up  the  district  heating  market  to  foreign  investors  to  obtain  operational \nknow-how and private sector capital. \n \nB. \n\nAsian Development Bank Operations \n\n1. \n\nCountry Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC6  is based on four development thrusts: \n18. \n(I) inclusive  growth  and  balanced  development,  (ii)  resource  efficiency  and  environmental \nsustainability, (iii) regional cooperation and public goods, and (iv) an environment conducive to \nprivate sector development.     \n \n19. \nThe PRC has been steadily transforming into a market economy, which has become the \nbasis and driving force for economic growth and job creation. In addition to ADB\u2019s policy advice \nto  the  Government  on  private  sector  development,  ADB  also  provides  project-based  financial \nassistance. ADB\u2019s private sector operations in the PRC have focused on the infrastructure and \nenergy sectors, the financial sector, and environmental improvements. In the infrastructure and \nenergy  sectors,  ADB  prioritizes  pioneering  projects  with  innovative  contractual  and  financial \nstructuring  to  encourage  private  sector  participation,  enhance  management  expertise,  and \nimprove corporate governance. As agreed with the Government, ADB private sector operations \nwill  identify  and  support  viable  projects  that  are  located  in  the  less-developed  central  and \nwestern regions, and explore the possibility of using proceeds of yuan-denominated bonds for \nlending to local borrowers.   \n \n\n2. \n\nMedium-Term Strategy II   \n\n20. \nADB\u2019s  Medium-Term  Strategy  II  (2006\u20132008)  seeks  more  directly  to  help  developing \nmember  countries  acquire  low-carbon  technologies,  and  to  implement  energy  efficiency  and \nrenewable energy projects to enable Asia to take the technology leap. Catalyzing investment to \nimprove  the  investment  climate,  expanding  private  sector  operations,  and  managing  the \nenvironment are also priorities. \n \n\n3. \n\nEnergy Sector Strategy \n\n21. \nADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy  supports,  as  operational  priorities,  (i)  poverty  reduction \nthrough such means as energy infrastructure development for sustainable economic growth and \nincreased access to energy for the poor, particularly in rural areas; (ii) private sector involvement \nthrough energy sector restructuring and the creation of an enabling environment for the private \nsector  to  invest  and  operate;  (iii)  regional  and  global  environmental  impact  through  measures \nthat  address  acid  rain  problems  and  promote  the  use  of  clean  energy;  and  (iv)  regional \ncooperation.  The  ongoing  review  of  ADB\u2019s  energy  policy  is  expected  to  recommend  a  greater \nfocus on energy efficiency. In its public sector operations, ADB is involved in a number of efforts \nto help improve the heating system in the PRC. \n \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n4. \n\nThe Energy Efficiency Initiative \n\n22. \nADB\u2019s  Energy  Efficiency  Initiative  (EEI)  aims  to  expand  ADB  operations  in  energy \nefficiency and clean energy to at least $1 billion a year, according to the general framework for \nthe  implementation  of  EEI.  The  EEI  task  force  identified  the  PRC  as  a  priority  developing \nmember country with the highest potential in the Asia and Pacific region for energy efficiency and \nclean energy investments. The task force has been holding consultative meetings in the PRC to \nlearn  firsthand  from  energy  efficiency  market  stakeholders  about  immediate  investment \nopportunities and barriers in the PRC market as a prerequisite for developing energy efficiency \nprojects.  EEI  consultations  confirmed  that  many  different  approaches  are  needed  to  access \nvarious segments with significant energy efficiency potential.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n\nProject Description \n\nThe Project involves the establishment, acquisition, rehabilitation, and operation of DES \n23. \nCHP technologies, where possible, to address operational inefficiency and financial constraints \nfaced  by  municipalities\u2014two  key  obstacles  to  DES  market  development  in  the  PRC.  The \nproposed  ADB  loan  will  support  the  investment  plan  of  Dalkia  SAS  (Dalkia,  the  Guarantor)  to \nrehabilitate and expand DES in municipalities through joint ventures with local partners across \nthe PRC. Those joint ventures will provide DES services to residential clients and industrial and \ncommercial  businesses.  The  impact  of  the  Project  is  twofold:  (i)  to  provide  access  to  clean, \nreliable,  safe,  and  high\u2013quality  heating  and  cooling  services  to  the  municipalities,  and  (ii)  to \nexpand  private  sector  investment  in  DES  projects  in  the  PRC,  thereby  achieving  large-scale \nenergy  efficiency  improvements  and  associated  reduction  in  the  growth  of  GHG  and  other \npollutants. \n \nB. \n\nDalkia Group \n\n24. \nFounded  in  1860,  Dalkia  is  the  world\u2019s  leading  DES  management  and  maintenance \ncompany  employing  more  than  50,000  people  in  40  countries.  The  company\u2019s  core  value  is \n\u201coptimizing  energy  in  cities\u201d.  With  energy\u2013efficient  and  environment\u2013friendly  solutions,  Dalkia \noptimizes  the  technical,  financial,  and  environmental  performance  of  the  facilities  which  it \nmanages  on  behalf  of  local  authorities  and  businesses.  Its  primary  business  is  that  of  an \noperating  engineer;  it  designs,  constructs,  operates  and  manages  energy  facilities  throughout \nthe  energy  chain  from  production  to  consumption.  Based  on  audited  financial  statements  for \nFY2006, Dalkia has the total equity of \u20ac2.1 billion and the total assets of \u20ac7.1 billion.   \n \n\n1. \n\nShareholders \n\n25. \nDalkia is owned by Veolia Environment (Veolia) (66%) and by \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France (EDF) \n(34%). Dalkia is one of Veolia\u2019s four divisional companies7  and is in charge of energy. In 2000, \nVeolia and EDF merged their energy service business, giving EDF a 34% stake in the company.     \n \n\n                                                 \n7   Veolia has four divisional companies by sector\u2013 energy (Dalkia), water, transport, and waste management. In 2006, \n\nDalkia's revenue made up 21.4% of Veolia's total revenue, and assets 17.8%. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\n2. \n\nOperations \n\n26. \nDalkia\u2019s main services include thermal and multitechnical services, heating and cooling \nnetworks,  industrial  utilities,  installation,  comprehensive  building  management,  industrial \nmaintenance, and public lighting services. It manages 96,000 sites worldwide with 83,400 MW of \ntotal  heating  capacity,  and  6,266  MW  of  power  production  capacity,  including  709  MW  of \nrenewable energy facilities.   \n \nFollowing the Government\u2019s 2003 policy to introduce private sector participation in DES, \n27. \nDalkia Asia Pte Ltd (Dalkia Asia), a subsidiary of Dalkia, launched its operations in the PRC as \none of the first foreign companies authorized to own and operate district heating networks.   \n \nDalkia will support the operation and maintenance of the joint ventures through technical \n28. \n(design,  operations,  information  technology,  maintenance),  legal  (contract  drafting,  deal \nstructuring), financial (equity contribution, financial guarantee), accounting (accounting tool and \nexpertise, tax advice), and human resource support (secondment of staff, sharing good practice, \ntraining).   \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment, Safety, and Health \n\nThe  Project \n\n29.  Municipal  DES  projects  including  CHP  abide  by  national,  provincial,  and  municipal \nenvironmental  laws.  Dalkia  duly  applies  for  all  permits  required  to  implement  the  projects  and \noperate project facilities. The design, construction, and operation are required by law to strictly \nfollow safety standards and practices that are well-established by professional institutions in the \nindustry worldwide. The controlling authorities periodically monitor safety aspects. The municipal \ngovernment  or  Dalkia  conducts  an  environmental  impact  assessment  for  all  projects  when \nrequired.  Due  diligence  was  conducted  on  the  environmental,  safety,  and  health  aspects  of \ncurrent operations of Dalkia\u2019s joint ventures to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies.   \n \n30. \nis  classified  as  environment  category  FI.  To  comply  with  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental  safeguards  requirements,  Dalkia  will  ensure  that  the  joint  ventures  set  up  an \nenvironmental  management  system  for  new  projects  to  be  funded  by  ADB  loans,  including \nenvironmental assessment and review procedures for potential investments acceptable to ADB. \nADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003)  and  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  the \nPRC\u2019s  environmental  laws  and  regulations  will  be  complied  with  and  implementation  of \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  will  be  monitored \nin  collaboration  with  municipal \nenvironmental protection bureaus. Such environmental mitigation measures will be included in \nprogress reports on project implementation with reporting requirements appropriate to subproject \nclassification, such as semiannual reports on environmental monitoring to be submitted to ADB \nfor review.   \n \n\n2. \n\nClean Development Mechanism \n\n31. \nEnergy savings provide opportunities to reduce GHG emissions such as CO2 and have \nthe potential to generate carbon credits under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The \nCDM is an offset arrangement under the Kyoto Protocol that allows buyers in the industrialized \ncountries with GHG reduction commitment to purchase carbon credits from developing countries, \nsuch as the PRC, to meet their commitment in achieving global GHG emission reduction. The \nProject will seek assistance from ADB\u2019s Carbon Market Initiative for this purpose. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nResettlement \n\n32. \nThe Project is classified as involuntary resettlement category B/C and indigenous people \ncategory C. CHP facilities will be constructed on land allocated by the municipal government and \nlocated in an area designated as a development zone. Expansion of district heating systems will \nbe  carried  out  under  existing  public  roads.  In  cases  where  a  new  CHP  facility  is  constructed, \nlaying  of  pipes  to  connect  to  the  existing  pipeline  network  may  require  very  limited  land \nacquisition or entail temporary site impacts. Land acquisition or changes in land use are normally \ncarried  out  by  the  municipal  governments  before  the  concessions  are  opened  to  the  private \nsector for competition. Dalkia thus has a limited direct role in land acquisition, and only in rare \ncases will Dalkia be directly involved in resettlement planning and implementation. Nonetheless, \nfor  ADB-financed  projects,  Dalkia,  together  with  the  relevant  joint  ventures,  will  work  with  the \nmunicipal  government  to  prepare  a  resettlement  plan  and  ensure  that  all  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement activities are undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \n(1995) requirements; national laws; and provincial, municipal and county level regulations and \nordinances. Prior to investing in concessions, Dalkia will assess the social impacts in accordance \nwith  ADB  social  development  and  safeguard  requirements.  In  cases  in  which  land  acquisition \nhas taken place in anticipation of its investments using ADB loan proceeds, Dalkia will undertake \ndue  diligence  to  ensure  no  issues  are  outstanding  regarding  the  municipal  governments\u2019 \nacquisition of rights to land or displacement of people or enterprises. The land acquisition and \nresettlement  framework  sets  out  the  procedures,  roles,  and  responsibilities  for  ensuring  that \nDalkia  fully  complies  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements  for  joint  ventures  that  will  utilize  ADB  loan \nproceeds.   \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Impacts \n\n33. \nThe Project will promote economic growth and environmental improvement in the PRC \nthrough  improved  energy  efficiency  in  DES.  The  impacts  of  improving  energy  efficiency  will \ndecrease  the  growth  rate  of  GHG  emissions,  increase  energy  services,  and  improve  energy \nsecurity.  Specifically,  the  Project  will  (i)  improve  environmental  conditions  through  improved \nenergy  efficiency,  support  Government  efforts  to  rebuild  more  energy-efficient  DES  in \nmunicipalities, and accelerate rehabilitation and expansion of DES infrastructure through private \nsector  participation;  (ii)  improve  access  to  clean,  reliable,  safe  and  high-quality  heating  and \ncooling  services  to  the  people  in  municipalities  in  the  PRC;  and  (iii)  demonstrate  that \npublic\u2013private partnership for DES projects are efficient, and thus encourage the private sector \nand municipalities to invest in DES projects beyond the Project\u2019s interventions. \n \nE. \n\nDevelopment Effectiveness \n\n34. \nThe  development  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  assessed  from  the  perspective  of \ndevelopment effectiveness and project framework, and its contribution to economic sustainability \nand private sector development in accordance with the guidelines for the implementation of the \nGood Practice Standards for Evaluation of Private Sector Investment Operations prepared by the \nMultilateral Development Banks\u2019 Evaluation Cooperation Group.8  The Project is deemed to be \ndevelopmentally  effective  and  its  performance  measurable.  A  summary  discussion  of  each  of \nthese assessment parameters follows. \n \n\n                                                 \n8  Multilateral  Development  Banks-Evaluation  Cooperation  Group.  2006.  MDB-ECG  Good  Practice  Standards  for \n\nEvaluation of Private Sector Investment Operations. Third Edition. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\n1. \n\nProject Performance \n\n35. \nThe  Project  will  be  assessed  against  its  specific  investment  capital,  construction,  and \noperational  and  financial  objectives.  Essentially,  effectiveness  will  be  measured  against  how \nsuccessfully the Project attracts private sector capital, secures DES concessions, and develops \nand  expands  municipal  DES;  and  how  much  heating  and  cooling  the  Project  supplies  to  end \nusers and industries. Financial profitability and sustainability of the Project will be measured by \nits timely debt repayment capacity. \n \n\nEconomic Sustainability \n\n36. \nThe Project will be assessed from an economic sustainability perspective on its ability to \ndevelop and implement municipal DES, supply municipal heating and cooling to the end users \nand  industries,  and  contribute  to  environmental  improvements  and  economic  growth.  The \nProject\u2019s successful implementation will impact the promotion of heating reform. \n \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\n \n2. \n\n \n3. \n\n37. \nThe  Project  will  be  assessed  and  measured  on  its  contribution  to  private  sector \ndevelopment.  The  focus  of  this  assessment  will  be  on  the  Project\u2019s  commercial  and  financial \nviability, and its demonstrative and catalytic effect on future private sector developments in DES \nitself and the economy as a whole. \n \n38. \nThe Project was not specifically assessed from the perspective of investment profitability, \nas a profitability assessment is better gauged and measured against a portfolio of similar loans \nand equity investments. Similarly, the Project was not assessed and measured against overall \noperational effectiveness, as this is a departmental consideration.   \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nLoan \n\nADB\u2019s proposed loan comprise an A Loan of up to CNY1.4 billion funded by ADB and a B \n39. \nloan  of  up  to  CNY1.4  billion  funded  by  international  or  local  banks,  to  the  joint  ventures \nestablished  by  Dalkia  Asia  and  local  partners.  The  loan  will  have  an  interest  rate  to  be \ndetermined  by  the  Pricing  and  Credit  Enhancement  Committee.  The  Borrowers  may  have  the \nright  to  convert  the  interest  rate  from  a  floating  rate  to  a  fixed  rate  and  vice  versa  on  terms \nagreed between ADB and the Borrowers. \n \n40. \nThe  B  loan  of  up  to  CNY1.4  billion  will  have  terms  and  conditions  agreed  upon  by  the \nBorrowers, the participating banks and ADB.  ADB will charge an arrangement fee  and annual \nadministration fee determined by the Pricing and Credit Enhancement Committee. \n \n41. \nThe financing documentation will contain financial and operational covenants, including \nregular financial and operational monitoring reports and requirements to meet minimum financial \nratios.   \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nJustification \n\n42. \nADB\u2019s assistance for the Project is justified on the basis of its development impacts and \ndemonstration effects. It supports the Government\u2019s development plans and ADB\u2019s operational \nstrategies, and provides value added of ADB participation in the Project: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nThe Project will provide access to clean, reliable, safe, and high-quality heating \nand  cooling  services  to  the  people  living  in  municipalities  where  adequate \nmunicipal DES infrastructure is lacking and demand is currently not fully met. The \nProject  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  strategic  priorities  for  energy  and  the \nenvironment  as  set  forth  in  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  as  well  as  Medium-  and \nLong-Term  Energy  Conservation  Plan  to  improve  the  energy  efficiency.  The \nProject will reduce particulates and SO2 from scattered small coal-fired heat-only \nboilers and inefficient district heating networks. This will have the most benefits for \nthe urban population, in particular the urban poor, who suffer severely from indoor \nand outdoor air pollution.   \n\nThe Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s private sector operations in the PRC, which \nhave  focused  on  private  sector  participation  in  the  infrastructure  and  energy \nsectors,  financial  sector,  and  environmental  improvements.  In  the  infrastructure \nand  energy  sectors,  ADB  prioritizes  pioneering  participation,  enhancing \nmanagement  expertise,  and  improving  corporate  governance.  This  Project  will \nprovide highly skilled employment and know-how transfer opportunity to the local \ncommunity.   \n\nThe Project will embody ADB\u2019s country strategy for the PRC, which emphasizes \nsupporting  environmental  improvement  and  private  sector  participation.  The \nProject  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy,  which  recommends  a \nto  address  regional  and  global \nreorientation  of  energy  sector  activities \nenvironmental impact. By introducing energy efficiency, the Project will contribute \nto  mitigating  climate  change.  The  Project  is  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  credit \nenhancement operations policy and EEI. \n\nAs the first private sector district energy project supported by ADB, the Project is \ndemonstrational  and  catalytic.  It  sets  a  model  for  private  sector  investment, \nincluding strengthening ties between the leading international investor and local \nmunicipalities and service providers, to fill in the gap between the substantial level \nof  investment  required  for  DES  projects  and  limited  financing  capacity.  ADB\u2019s \nparticipation  in  the  Project  is  expected  to  establish  more  confidence  in  future \nprivate sector participation in DES projects based on public\u2013private partnerships \nin the PRC. \n\nAnticorruption, Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n\nDalkia was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and policy \n43. \nrelating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire  Dalkia,  and  its  subsidiaries  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures \nand  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing \ncorruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism, and covenant with ADB to \n\n \nC. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nrefrain from engaging in such activities. The loan documentation between ADB and Dalkia will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n44. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed  loan.  No \nfunding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation.   \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n45. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB, \nand recommend that the Board approve a loan of up to CNY2,800,000,000 to the joint ventures \nestablished  by  Dalkia  Asia  and  local  partners  to  finance  the  Municipal  District  Energy \nInfrastructure Development Project, consisting of \n \n\nan A loan funded by ADB in an amount up to CNY1,400,000,000, to be provided \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources without government guarantee; and   \n\na  B  loan  funded  by  international  or  local  banks  in  an  amount  up  to \nCNY1,400,000,000 on terms and conditions to be mutually agreed upon between \nthe borrowers, the participating banks, and ADB, \n\n \nand on such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthis report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n \n
