The DPSP 2 is \nto  be  provided  as  a  single  tranche,  based  on  completed  prior  actions \ndemonstrating satisfactory progress.  \n \nTargeting Classification: General intervention \nSector: Law, economic management, and public policy \nSubsector: Economic management \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth, governance, private sector \ndevelopment \nSubthemes: Promoting macroeconomic stability, public governance, \nprivate sector investment \n \nCategory C       \n\n \nthe  Government\u2019s  medium-term  Philippine \nThe  broad  goals  of \ndevelopment  plan \n(MTPDP)  are  stimulating  higher  and  more \nsustainable economic  growth  (up  to  7%  per  annum  by  2009),  creating \njobs  (1  million  jobs  created  by  2009),  and  reducing  poverty.  Poverty \nrates  have  declined  in  the  past  two  decades,  but  increased  to  33%  of \nthe  population  in  2006  from  30%  in  2003.  The  critical  fiscal  situation \nthat emerged in 2002 compressed public investment and funding for the \nsocial sectors and hurt the poor. These problems were compounded by \npoor governance in public expenditure management (PEM), corruption \nin  procurement,  and  a  weak  investment  climate.  Increases  in  energy \nprices in 2006 contributed to the spike in poverty incidence in 2006. \n \nReforms  supporting  fiscal  consolidation;  strengthening  governance  in \nPEM;  reducing  corruption  in  key  government  agencies;  and  improving \nthe  investment  climate,  rural  development,  and  infrastructure  are \ncrucially  important  to  putting  economic  growth  on  a  more  sustainable \npath,  redirecting  spending  to  the  social  sectors,  and  contributing  to \npoverty \nreduction.  The  2007  ADB  study,  Philippines:  Critical \nDevelopment  Constraints,  reiterated  these  areas  as  core  to  growth  in \nthe Philippines and was used in formulating the subprogram 2. \n \nUnder  subprogram  1,  the  Government  implemented  a  series  of \nmeasures  to  address  the  fiscal  imbalance,  resulting  in  a  swift  and \nimpressive \nimproved \nmacroeconomic  stability  in  2006.  These  measures  provided  much \nneeded  fiscal  space for  increasing spending  on  the  social sectors  and \ninfrastructure in 2007. With increased spending for priority sectors, set \nwithin  a  medium-term  balanced  budget  framework,  the  Philippines \nenjoyed its best macroeconomic performance in more than 30 years: in \n\nfiscal  situation  and \n\nturnaround \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n \nBorrower \n \nThe Proposal \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nThe Program \nRationale \n\n \n\n\f \nii \n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\nto  medium-term \n\nfor  2008  builds  on  reforms \n\n2007  economic  growth  was  7.2%,  investment  growth  11.5%,  inflation \naveraged  2.6%,  and  the  national  government  deficit  at  0.2%  of  the \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP).  However,  the  sharp  slowdown  in  the \nUnited  States  economy,  volatility  in  its  financial  markets,  and  the \nunexpected surge in global food and oil prices at the start of 2008 are \nbeginning  to  affect  growth  conditions  in  the  Philippines  economy,  hurt \nthe  poor,  and  create  new  challenges \nfiscal \nsustainability. At the same time, the surge in food prices has refocused \nGovernment attention on improving the rural investment climate. \n \nThe  subprogram  2 \ninitiated  under \nsubprogram 1 for fiscal consolidation and strengthening of governance \nin  PEM  and  procurement.  Responding  to  recent  developments  in  the \nglobal economy, subprogram 2 broadens the reform program in the four \ncore areas to (i) improve fiscal sustainability, maintain macroeconomic \nstability,  and  improve  creditworthiness;  (ii)  enhance  governance  in \nPEM;(iii)  improve  the  investment  climate,  rural  development,  and \ninfrastructure;  and  (iv)  reduce  poverty  and  increase  social  inclusion.  It \nsets  the  groundwork  for  a  more  substantial  agenda  for  the  investment \nclimate, rural development, and poverty reduction under subprogram 3. \n \nThe  DPSP  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  parallel  development  policy  loan \nrepresent  a  joint  effort  of  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  to  support  and \ndeepen  a  common  reform  agenda  with  the  Government.  The  DPSP \nreflects the Government\u2019s commitment to its reforms over the medium-\nterm, and ADB\u2019s commitment over the medium-term to provide financial \nsupport to program implementation. The DPSP benefits from input from \nthe  governments  of  Australia  (Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment),  Japan  (Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation),  and \nthe  United  States \nInternational \nDevelopment);  and  the  World  Bank  through  preparation  of  its  second \ndevelopment policy loan, which is expected later in 2008. \n \nThe  subprogram  2  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  (i)  achieve \nand  sustain  higher  economic  growth,  and  (ii)  reduce  unemployment \nthrough  improved  investor  confidence.  To  achieve  these  objectives,  it \nwill undertake strategic reforms to \n \n(i) \n\nimprove  fiscal  sustainability,  maintain  macroeconomic  stability, \nand  improve  creditworthiness  by  enhancing  the  quality  of  fiscal \nmanagement  by  (a)  raising  tax  revenues  annually  for  the  next  2 \nyears  (2008\u20132009)  through  tax  policy  reforms;  (b)  strengthening \ntax  administration  and  enforcement,  and  reducing  revenue \nleakages  through  improved  governance;(c)  reducing  inefficient \nincreased  social  and  poverty-related \nspending \nspending; and (d) strengthening the debt management strategy to \nprudently manage government-contingent liabilities and risks; \n(ii)  enhance  governance  in  PEM  by  (a)  improving  PEM  from  budget \npreparation  to  budget  execution,  and  accounting,  recording,  and \nreporting; \n(b)  strengthening  performance  management  and \nimproving  public  service  delivery;  (c)  reforming  procurement;  and \n\n(United  States  Agency \n\nto  allow \n\nfor \n\nfor \n\n\f \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod and \nTranching \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nExecuting Agency  \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\niii \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\ntrade,  and  (b) \n\ninvestment  and \n\n(d)  implementing  anticorruption  and  enforcement  strategies  in \nrevenue-collecting agencies and key procurement agencies; \nimprove the investment climate and promote rural development by \n(a) clarifying and strengthening the legal and regulatory framework \ninfrastructure \nfor \ndevelopment  through  greater  public\u2013private  participation  and \ngreater coordination of public infrastructure investments; and \nreduce  poverty  and  increase  social  inclusion  by  improving  the \npolicy framework for social protection, sustaining real spending on \nhealth and education, improving targeting of programs, improving \nservice  delivery,  and  introducing  a  conditional  cash  transfer \nprogram  tied  to  family  performance  outcomes  in  child  education \nand health. \n\nfacilitating \n\nfor \n\nthe \n\nfacility \n\nlocal  currency  counterpart \n\n \nA  loan  of  $250,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will  be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nthe  Development  Policy  Support  Program, \nlending \nsubprogram  2.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term  including  a  grace \nperiod of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and such  other  terms  and  conditions set \nforth in the draft program loan agreement.  \n \nThe subprogram 2 period will be from April 2007 to October 2008, with \na  single  tranche  loan  of  $250  million  to  be  disbursed  when  the \nGovernment has met the conditions for loan effectiveness. Subprogram \n3 of the DPSP will be submitted for Board consideration approximately \n12  months  after  the  effectiveness  of  the  subprogram  2,  subject  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s readiness to continue with its reform agenda.  \n \nThe  Government  will  use \nfunds \ngenerated  by  the  loan  proceeds  to  meet  program  expenditures  and \nassociated  costs  of  reform,  and  to  help  maintain  current  social \nexpenditure and infrastructure spending. \n \nDepartment of Finance (DOF)  \n \nThe  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  (DBM)  will  be  the \nImplementing  Agency  responsible  for  implementing  the  subprogram  2. \nIt will be supported by relevant government line agencies, including the \nOffice  of \nthe  Ombudsman,  Department  of  Education  (DepEd), \nDepartment  of  Agriculture  (DOA),  Department  of  Health  (DOH), \nDepartment  of  Public  Works  and  Highways  (DPWH),  Department  of \nTrade and Industry (DTI) and the National Economic and Development \nAuthority  (NEDA).  The  DPSP  coordinating  committee  chaired  by  the \nDOF  undersecretary  and  comprising  officials  from  DOF,  DBM,  and \nNEDA, will be responsible for coordinating program implementation and \nsustaining  subprogram  2  actions  with  DBM  and  relevant  government \nline agencies involved in supporting the DPSP. The committee will meet \nquarterly  to  monitor  progress,  oversee  program  implementation,  and \nprovide guidance and direction to DOF and DBM.    \n \n\n \n\n\f \niv \n \n\nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\n \nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The loan proceeds \nwill  be  disbursed  to  the  Borrower  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans. \n \nThe  DPSP  will  provide  significant  benefits  and  have  a  positive  impact \non the poor because of the following:  \n(i)  \n\nfiscal  consolidation  achieved  and  progress  toward  medium-term \nfiscal  sustainability  will  promote  macroeconomic  stability,  and \nfoster  broad-based  economic  growth,  job  creation,  and  poverty \nreduction\u2014cornerstones  of  the  Government\u2019s  MTPDP  and  the \nPhilippine development forum; \n\n(ii)  an increase in tax revenues as a percentage of GDP will provide \nadditional resources for spending on social sectors and therefore \nhave a direct positive impact on the poor; \n\nframework  and  procurement \n\n(iii)  better  governance  and  efficiency  in  PEM  will  include  enhanced \ncredibility  in  the  budget,  implementation  of  the  medium-term \nreforms,  budget \nexpenditure \nexecution, and more systematic recording and reporting of budget \naccounts; \nlower transaction costs for business by reducing bureaucracy and \nimproving  trade  facilitation  will  open  new  opportunities,  increase \ninvestment  and  productivity,  boost \nincrease \nincomes, and create jobs; \n\nthe  economy, \n\n(iv) \n\n(v)  higher  infrastructure  spending  will  generate  long-term  growth, \n\n(vi) \n\nstimulate investment, create jobs, and raise incomes; \nimproved  social  sector  outcomes  as  a  result  of  increasing \nspending,  and  implementing  better-targeted  social  assistance \nprogram,  a  conditional  cash  transfer  program  linked  to  family \nperformance outcomes in child education and health; and \n\n(vii)   sustainable governance programs by institutionalizing governance \nprograms  such  as  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework, \nintegrity  development  reviews,  and  DOF\u2019s  anticorruption  revenue \ninitiatives  in  the  Bureau  of  Internal  Revenue  and  Bureau  of \nCustoms, will help support the sustainability of these initiatives. \n\nfiscal  consolidation, \n\n \nThe  DPSP  is  firmly  embedded  in  the  MTPDP,  the  Philippines \ndevelopment  forum,  and  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  sector  strategies \ncovering \nreform,  PEM, \nprocurement  reform,  investment  competitiveness,  rural  development, \nand  social  protection.  The  assumptions  underlying  the  DPSP  include \nthe following:  \n  \n(i) \n\nThe  economy  will  be  able  to  withstand  global  oil  and  food  price \nshocks. \n\ntax  administration \n\n(ii)  The  Government  will  stay  on  course  with  key  policy  reform \nmeasures, and continue to liaise effectively with Congress.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nv \n\nHowever, the DPSP has risks: \n  \n(i)  A sharp slowdown in the United States economy and turbulence in \nits  capital  markets  affect  growth  conditions  in  the  Philippines \neconomy.  The  surge  in  food  price  inflation  persists  in  2008, \nslowing  household  consumption  and  economic  growth,  and \nthreatening to increase poverty. This may stress the fiscal policy if \nthe  economy  slows  down  faster  than  expected.  ADB  staff \nestimates suggest that food price increases of 30% could increase \npoor families\u2019 spending on rice by up to P50 billion, including the \n7%  of  the  population  that  are  vulnerable  to  falling  into  poverty. \nHowever,  these  effects  may  be  mitigated  by  the  continued \nresilience  of  remittances,  which  are  up  by  14.5%  in  dollar  terms \n(20% in peso terms) in the first 4 months of 2008 over the same \nperiod in 2007, and continued robust tax revenue collections in the \nfirst semester of 2008 providing some space for additional budget \nspending. \n\n(ii)  However, with the economic stresses in 2008 and with an election \nin  2010,  the  Government  may  be  tempted  to  introduce  populist \npolicies that could threaten fiscal discipline in 2008 and 2009. \n(iii)  The  2010  presidential  elections  may  slow  implementation  of \nreforms.  However,  the  Government  has  full  ownership  of  the \nDPSP  reform  program,  which  is  embedded  in  the  Philippines \ndevelopment  forum  and  its  sector  strategies;  moreover  the  first \nDPSP  generation  is  expected  to  be  completed  before  the  next \nelections. \n\n(iv)  The  capacity  of  agencies \n\nimplement  reforms  may  be \nto \nconstrained  by  resources  and  other  emerging  priorities  in  2008. \nHowever, many development partners are supporting the reforms \nthrough technical assistance. \n\nfunding  program.  The  Government  will  provide \n\n \nPolicy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (PATA)  is  included  with  the \nsubprogram 2. The PATA is estimated to cost $1.15 million equivalent. \nADB  will  provide  $800,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB  technical \nassistance \nthe \nremaining $350,000 equivalent by providing counterpart staff and other \nfacilities. \n \nThe PATA  will support DBM in implementing and monitoring key PEM \nreforms,  with  the  focus  on  enhancing  budget  execution,  accounting, \nrecording,  and  reporting.  The  PATA  has  three  components.  Under \ncomponent  1,  it  will  support  DBM  with  its  budget  execution  reforms. \ninclude  assistance  with  streamlining  budget  execution \nActivities \nprocedures  and \nconducting  diagnostic \nassessments  of  spending  behavior  of  line  ministries,  strengthening \npayroll  and  allowance  internal  control  and  monitoring  procedures,  and \nimplementing the rollout of DBM\u2019s internal control and audit in selected \npilot  ministries.  The  second  component  will  build  on  the  results  of \ndiagnostic  work  on  the  government  financial  management  information \nsystem  (GFMIS),  which  the  DBM  will  undertake  in  2008  including \nimplementing the road map for developing an integrated GFMIS within \n\ninformation \n\nsystems, \n\n \n\n \nTechnical \nAssistance \n\n\fthe national Government. This component will support DBM in initiating \ndevelopment  of  the  GFMIS,  building  on  existing  information  systems \nsuch  as \nthe  electronic  national  government  accounting  system \n(eNGAS),  e-budget,  and  Philippine  government  electronic  portal \n(PhilGEPS).  This  component  will  help  DBM  establish  an  interagency \nworking group to oversee GFMIS reforms across government. The third \ncomponent will help DBM develop and implement change management \nstrategies  to  support  the  DBM  budget  reform  program  and  its  reform \nunit,  and  prepare  a  strategy  for  rollout  to  selected  line  ministries. \nAssistance  will  be  provided  to  selected  line  ministries  to  strengthen \ncapacity to provide timely posting of budget data on the DBM website.  \n \nA  team  of  international  and  national  consultants  will  implement  the \nPATA  activities.  ADB  will  engage  a  consulting  firm  or  individuals  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  A  total  of  50  (19  international  and  31 \nnational) person-months will be required.  \n\n \nvi \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of the Philippines for the Development Policy Support Program, Subprogram 2 \n(DPSP 2). 1 This report also describes proposed policy and advisory technical assistance (PATA) \nfor improving public expenditure management (PEM), and if the Board approves the proposed \nloan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will  approve  the  PATA.  The \nprogram design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Strategies and the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan \n\nIt \n\nthe \n\nfiscal \n\nidentifies \n\nimbalance; \n\nthe  reform  agenda  and  ways \n\n2. \nIn  2004,  the  Government  announced  the  Medium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan \n2004\u20132010 (MTPDP),2 setting out the country\u2019s development priorities, policy agenda, programs, \nand projects for the next 6 years. The key objectives of the MTPDP are to achieve higher and \nmore sustainable economic growth, create jobs, reduce poverty, and make progress toward the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs). \ninadequate \ninfrastructure;  rapid  urbanization  and  congestion,  especially  in  Metro  Manila;  increasing \nunemployment; and inefficient delivery of basic services as major challenges. \n \n3. \nIn 2005, the Government and the international development partners decided to convert \nthe  annual  Consultative  Group  meetings  into  the  Philippines  development  forum  (PDF).  The \nPDF  provides  an  opportunity  for  ongoing  dialogue,  involving  other  stakeholders,  such  as  civil \nsociety, the private sector, and the academic community. The Government convenes the PDF \nto  discuss \nthe  development  partners  can  assist  with \nimplementation.3 The PDF allows the development partners to enhance their policy engagement \nwith the Government and to provide an impetus to MTPDP implementation. Currently the PDF \nhas  seven  working  groups,  each  focusing  on  priority  areas  of  the  Government\u2019s  development \nagenda (Figure 1). In March 2006, the Government agreed with the World Bank to use the PDF \nagenda as the basis for a World Bank development policy loan. Shortly after the workshop, the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  was  invited  to  join  the  process  and  to  prepare  the  reform \nagenda  through  the  DPSP.  The  agenda  was  refined  and  modified  through  subsequent  PDF \nworkshops  in  2007  and  2008  to  reflect  the  Government\u2019s  new  priorities  and  medium-term \nchallenges. When the DPSP was first formulated in 2006, it was anchored in four core areas of \nthe  PDF:  fiscal  consolidation,  governance,  investment  climate  and  infrastructure,  and  social \nprogress.  At  the  request  of  the  Government,  subprograms  2  and  3  of  the  DPSP  will  continue \nwith these four areas and add rural development as part of the investment climate component \nreflecting the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s increased focus on improving the investment climate.  \n \nTo  help  implement  the  MTPDP  priorities,  the  Government  adopted  several  sector \n4. \nstrategies,  most  with  a  time-bound  implementation  plan  and  clearly  defined  ministerial \nresponsibilities;  some  are  supported  by  ADB  sector  programs  and  TA  (Figure  2).  The  fiscal \nconsolidation  strategy,  which  began  earlier  in  2004,  outlined  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal \nstabilization  and  consolidation  strategy  up  to  2010.  It  has  been  successful  in  reducing  the \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2007.

The key strategic goals are to achieve a balanced public budget by 2010; and increase \nprimary  expenditures  from  12.6%  of  GDP  in  2007  to  13.6%  by  2010,  and  tax  revenues  from \n14% in 2007 to 15% by 2010. The tax administration reform program was launched in 2006 with \nthe  establishment  of  a  senior  tax  administration  reform  group  to  oversee  the  program  at  the \nBureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). In 2007, the group produced an action plan for 2007\u20132010 \nand  began  implementation  of  the  first  phase  in  mid-2007,  beginning  with  cleaning  and \nexpanding  the  taxpayer  database  and  piloting  computerization  of  two  revenue  district  offices \n(RDOs).  In  addition,  BIR  and  the  development  partners  established  a  government  and  aid \ncoordination group for tax reform to support the reform program. ADB has actively participated \nin  this  group  and  in  2008  is  implementing  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  selected \ncomponents  of  BIR's  reform  agenda. 4  The  Government\u2019s  budget  and  procurement  reform \nagenda, under the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), is focused on implementing \nthe  medium-term  expenditure  framework  (MTEF),  the  organizational  performance  indicators \nframework (OPIF) to enhance management performance, and governance initiatives to improve \nbudget transparency. The Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) under DBM has set \nout a 3-year action plan for 2007\u20132010 to implement the 2003 procurement law. ADB is actively \nworking  with  GPPB  to  harmonize  Government  and  ADB  procurement  procedures,  and  to \nstrengthen  operations  of  the  Philippines  government  electronic  portal  (PhilGEPS),  which  is \nmandated  under  the  procurement  law  as  the  portal  for  posting  procurement  agencies\u2019  bid \nnotices and awards. With fiscal consolidation on track, the Government is now shifting its reform \nattention to microeconomic reforms. The National Competitiveness Council, formed in October \n2006, is mandated to help the Government develop a strategy to improve competitiveness. ADB \nhas  been  actively  engaged  with  the  council  to  develop  ways  to  institutionalize  a  regulatory \nreview  process  within  government.  The  council  drafted  and  advocated  a  framework  for \ninstitutionalizing a regulatory impact assessment within government; adoption of an action plan \nis included in subprogram 3 of the DPSP (para. 56 and 64). In 2007, the Government, with ADB \nassistance,  developed  and  issued  a  new  social  protection  definition  that  sets  out  the  core \ncomponents  as  labor  market  programs,  social  insurance,  social  welfare,  and  better  targeted \nsocial safety net programs. \n \nB. \n\nThe Government and Its Development Partners \n\n5. \nThe  DPSP,  structured  as  a  program  cluster,  aims  to  help  the  Government  achieve  its \nmedium-term  goals  of  sustained  high  economic  growth  of  6%\u20137%  per  annum,  lower \nunemployment, and reduce poverty, as highlighted in the development policy letter addressed to \nthe  ADB  President  (Appendix  2).  For  effective  development  results,  the  DPSP  focuses  on  a \nbroad policy agenda that addresses thematic and cross-cutting issues in five core areas: fiscal \nsustainability,  governance  in  PEM  and  anticorruption  in  the  key  revenue-raising  agencies,  the \ninvestment climate, rural development, and poverty reduction and social inclusion. These are all \nkey outcomes and outputs of the ADB country strategy and program.5 The DPSP  emphasizes \nthe  achievement  of  measurable  policy  outcomes  and  results,  while  leaving  detailed  policy \nprescriptions to programs and projects in individual sectors. In this way, the DPSP complements \nand  reinforces  ADB\u2019s  sector  loan  programs  and  projects  aligned  with  the  Government\u2019s \nstrategies (para. 6). For example, the DPSP sets out broad policy outcomes for improving PEM, \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB.  2007.

The DPSP also sets out a broad policy outcome for rural development including a trigger \non  development  of  a  strategy  but  leaves  the  details  to  the  development  of  the  strategy  and \nsubsequent  projects  to  ADB\u2019s  sector  programs,  such  as  the  proposed  integrated  natural \nresources  and  environmental  management  program,  currently  under  preparation, 8  which \nincludes development of an uplands strategy for watersheds. ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Agriculture, \nEnvironment, and Natural Resources Division leads the dialogue with the Government including \nthrough  the  PDF  working  group  on  rural  development.  The  close  alignment  between  the \nGovernment\u2019s reform agenda and the DPSP strengthens the Government\u2019s commitment to the \nreforms  under  the  DPSP.  The  DPSP  process  is  guiding  ADB\u2019s  activities  in  the  Philippines  in \n2008 and 2009. \n \n6. \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program 2005\u20132007 for the Philippines identified three key \npriorities for ADB assistance that ensured a strategically focused program. Program selectivity \nwas guided by country-specific constraints\u2014macroeconomic instability (fiscal consolidation and \nPEM),  investment  climate,  and  social  sector.  In  this  way,  ADB  operations  were  designed  to \naddress these constraints under three corresponding pillars in a comprehensive and integrated \napproach  to  development.  The  DPSP  operationalizes  the  strategy  by  providing  an  umbrella \noperation that complements and reinforces ADB\u2019s sector program loans and projects (Figure 2). \nUnder  the  first  pillar  of  macroeconomic  stability,  the  local  government  financing  and  budget \nreform  program  rolls  out  budget  reforms  and  financing  for  local  government  units  (LGUs).  A \nseries  of  TA  projects  on  tax  administration  and  public  financial  management  (TA  on  chart  of \naccounts  harmonization)  are  provided  for  capacity  development  in  these  areas.  Under  the \nsecond  pillar  of  the  investment  climate,  ADB\u2019s  strategic  focus  has  been  on  the  energy  sector \nand capital market development. The Power Sector Development Program loan9 has deepened \nthe market for energy with the establishment of the wholesale energy market and is expected to \nresult in privatization of almost 70% of the National Power Corporation\u2019s energy assets by the \nend  of  2008.  The  Financial  Market  Regulation  and  Intermediation  Program  loan  promotes \nimproved intermediation and efficiency.10 The Infrastructure for Rural Productivity Enhancement \nSector Project11 supports infrastructure development in the southern Philippines and is expected \nto  construct  from  800  to  1,000  km  of  rural  feeder  roads,  5,000  hectares  of  common  irrigation, \nand  about  100  portable  water  systems.  It  is  the  first  ADB  project  to  work  directly  with  95 \nmunicipalities  and  involves  substantial  capacity  building  of  LGUs.  In  addition,  ADB  has \ncontinuing  operations  in  the  urban,  rural,  and  water  sectors  such  as  coastal  fisheries  and \nresource management, agrarian reform, and infrastructure; these have had a positive affect on \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB.  2007.

The  implementation  of  the \nHealth Sector Development Program facilitated the Government\u2019s application of a programmatic \napproach  using  multiple  development  partners.13 The  secondary  education  project14 provided \nsupport  for  components  of  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  education  reform  and  decentralization \nprocess (footnote 12). \n \nThe  Medium-Term  Programmatic  Approach.  Key  features  of  the  DPSP  include  \n7. \n(i) three single tranche operations, with a well-defined, medium-term framework specified at the \noutset and including completed high-impact reforms prior to consideration by the ADB Board of \nDirectors; (ii) triggers for subsequent subprograms to ensure a continuous dialogue between the \nGovernment, development partners, and stakeholders; and (iii) a small number of well-targeted \npolicy  actions  designed  to  achieve  high-impact  outcomes  in  priority  sectors.  In  this  way,  the \nDPSP  provides  a  coherent  medium-term  reform  strategy  with  three  discrete  but  linked \nsubprograms  and  a  strong  emphasis  on  performance,  as  the  decision  on  whether  to  proceed \nwith  the  next  subprogram  is  contingent  on  overall  satisfactory  performance  of  the  triggers.  It \nrecognizes the necessity for flexibility in the reform measures, with provisions for incorporating \nlessons  and  responding  to  changes  in  the  external  environment  in  the  design  of  downstream \nsubprograms.15  \n \n8. \n \n\nThe DPSP has the following three phases: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nSubprogram  1.  Financed  by  ADB  ($250  million)  in  2007,  it  supported  the \nGovernment\u2019s  fiscal  consolidation  program  creating  the  basis  for  continuous \npolicy dialogue and engagement during 2007\u20132009. \nSubprogram  2.  The  present  phase,  to  be  financed  by  ADB  ($250  million), \nincreases  the  focus  on  strengthening  governance  in  PEM  and  procurement.  It \nbuilds on reforms initiated under subprogram 1 for fiscal consolidation, increases \nthe focus on strengthening governance in PEM and procurement, addresses new \nrisks  to  the  program,  and  incorporates  lessons  from  the  assessment  of \nimplementation of policy reforms in 2007 and 2008. \nSubprogram  3.  Expected  to  be  processed  in  2009  with  ADB  financing,  it  will \nincrease  the  focus  on  institutionalizing  governance  programs,  the  investment \nclimate,  and  the  social  sector.  With  fiscal  consolidation  achieved  under \nsubprogram 2, reforms will focus on PEM. Subprogram 3 will increase attention \nthe \nto \nanticorruption  revenue  programs  in  BIR  and  Bureau  of  Customs  (BOC),  and \nregulatory  reform.  It  is  expected  to  be  closely  aligned  to  ADB\u2019s  new  country \nstrategy and program for the Philippines for 2009\u20132011. \n\ninstitutionalizing  priority  programs  of \n\nthe  Government  such  as \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB.  2008.

The  DPSP  and  the  World \n9. \nBank\u2019s  parallel  development  policy  loan  comprise  a  joint  effort  of  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  to \nsupport  and  deepen  a  common  reform  agenda  with  the  Government.  The  DPSP  reflects  the \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  its  reforms  over  the  medium-term,  and  ADB\u2019s  commitment  over \nthe  medium-term  to  provide  financial  support  to  program  implementation.  In  formulating  the \nDPSP,  the  Government  and  ADB  have  drawn  on  the  Government\u2019s  agenda  as  articulated \nthrough  the  PDF  and  its  sector  strategies.  The  Government  of  Japan  is  currently  considering \ncofinancing  the  Subprograms  2  and  3.  The  World  Bank  is  preparing  its  second  development \npolicy loan, which is expected later in 2008. ADB and the World Bank have coordinated reviews \nof  subprogram  2  policy  triggers  with  the  Government.  Formulations  of  subprogram  2  and  the \npolicy triggers for subprogram 3 of the DPSP have benefited from input from the governments of \nAustralia  (Australian  Agency \nfor \nInternational \nInternational  Cooperation),  and  United  States  (United  States  Agency \nDevelopment);  as  well  as  the  World  Bank.  The  DPSP  and  its  support  for  coordinated  sector-\nspecific  interventions  are  part  of  efforts  to  align  and  harmonize  the  strategies  of  development \npartners  with  those  of  the  Government.  Appendix  3  provides  the  development  partner \ncoordination matrix. \n \n10. \nThe  DPSP  cluster  has  a  number  of  important  features.  First,  it  is  fully  based  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s  reform  agenda  and  this  promotes  full  ownership  and  participation.  Second, \ndesigned  as  a  program  cluster  with  subsequent  subprograms  linked  by  triggers  within  a \nmedium-term  framework,  it  encourages  continuous  engagement  by  the  development  partners \nover  the  medium  term.  Third,  the  fiscal  and  cross-cutting  policy  framework,  including  the  full \nimplementation  of  the  MTEF  and  piloted  internal  control  and  audit,  coordinates  well  with  the \nADB\u2019s  sector  reform  programs  such  as  the  proposed  governance  and justice  reform  program, \nwhich  are  designed  to  broaden  and  deepen  the  DPSP.  Fourth,  the  DPSP  emphasizes \ninstitutionalizing  procedures,  processes,  and  programs  to  ensure  effective  implementation, \nrather than focusing merely on conditions that often do not yield any clear results on the ground. \nThe Government commits to the DPSP in the development policy letter (Appendix 2). \n \n\nfor \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR  \n\nA. \n\nReview of the Economy, Investment Climate, and Millennium Development Goals \n\n11. \nBest  Macroeconomic  Performance  in  30  Years.  Data  from  the  National  Statistical \nCoordination Board indicates economic growth at 7.2% in 2007, the highest on record for almost \n30  years.  It  is  among  the  highest  growth  rates  in  the  Asian  region.  Growth  has  been  broad-\nbased with services the fastest growing sector with a growth rate of 8.2% in 2007, contributing \nto  56%  of  economic  growth,  followed  by  industry  and  agriculture.  On  the  demand  side, \nconsumption  remains  an  engine  of  growth  rising  by  5.9%  in  2007  contributing  to  65%  of \neconomic growth. \n \n12. \nThree  Features  of  the  Current  Economic  Growth  Performance.  First,  the  current \neconomic expansion is the longest in three decades, with economic growth averaging 5.1% per \nyear  since  2000,  compared  with  average  annual  growth  of  2%  in  the  1990s  (Appendix  4). \nSecond, the current economic expansion reflects improved economic fundamentals associated \nwith  historically  low  inflation  in  2007,  fiscal  consolidation,  declining  public  debt  as  a  share  of \nGDP, current account surplus, and higher total factor productivity growth. In contrast, previous \nexpansions  were  associated  with  sharp  macroeconomic  imbalances  including  high  inflation, \nincreasing  public  debt,  and  at  times  deterioration  in  the  balance  of  payments.  These  are  all \nfeatures  of  a  boom\u2013bust  business  cycle  not  based  on  economic  fundamentals.  Political \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\ninstability helped shorten economic expansion in the 1980s and 1990s. Third, remittances have \nplayed  an  important  part  in  current  economic  growth.  Remittances  reached  an  all-time  high  in \n2007,  with  $14.4  billion  recorded  through  the  banking  system,  or  a  growth  rate  of  13%  over \n2006.  Informal  remittances  are  estimated  at  $3  billion.  Remittances  have  kept  the  current \naccount  in  surplus  at  5  %  of  GDP  and  boosted  household  consumption  as  they  account  for \nmore  than  10%  of  household  incomes.  Remittances  posted  through  the  banking  system \naccelerated  to  $5.4  billion  (or  14.5%  year-on-year  growth  rate)  in  the  first  4  months  of  2008, \nallaying  fears  that  the  slowdown  in  the  United  States  (US)  economy  would  decrease \nremittances to the Philippines.  \n \n13. \nRecovery  of  Investment.  Investment  spending  picked  up  strongly  in 2007  for  the  first \ntime  in  10  years,  growing  by  11.8%,  well  above  its  average  annual  growth  rate  of  0.8%  from \n1997  to  2006  (Table  1).  The  upturn  was  driven  by  the  25%  growth  in  public  infrastructure \nspending in 2007. Private sector investment also grew strongly with private construction growing \nby a robust 15.9% compared with negative 1.4% in 2006. Spending on durable equipment grew \nby  4.4%.  Foreign  direct  investment  approvals  (a  measure  of  intended  investment)  doubled  in \n2007 over 2006. Overall, the investment to GDP ratio (in current prices) improved from 14.0% in \n2006 to 14.8% in 2007. Investment growth slowed to 6.6% (year-on-year) in the first quarter of \n2008, primarily due to a 9.5% contraction in public construction. Private construction remained \nrobust  growing  by  15.1%.  Also  encouraging  for  investment,  purchases  of  new  durable \nequipment grew by 8.2% in the first quarter of 2008, double the growth rate in 2007. \n \n14. \nDeterioration  of  the  External  Environment.  In  2008,  the  Philippines  economy  has \nbeen  affected  by  three  adverse  developments  in  the  external  environment:  (i)  impact  of  US \nfinancial  sector  turbulence,  (ii)  the  US  and  global  economic  slowdown,  and  (iii)  recent \ncommodity and fuel price increases. The sharp slowdown in the US economy and turbulence in \nits financial markets is affecting growth conditions in the Philippines. While the economic growth \nrates of the Philippines and other developing economies can and do diverge from the US growth \nrate,  volatility  in  the  US  is  transmitted  to  developing  economies.  The  direct  impact  of  the  US \nfinancial crisis is limited, but indirect effects are possible through restructuring of balance sheet \neffects of US banks. Possible effects include credit crunch and in recent months rising spreads \non sovereign and corporate bond issues. The unexpected recent surge in international food and \nenergy  prices  has  resulted  in  higher  domestic  inflation  in  2008.  Inflation  hit  a  17-year  high  of \n12.2% in July 2008 on a year-on-year basis, with rice prices up by 43%. ADB staff forecasts for \ninflation suggest a continuation of double-digit food price inflation through to the third quarter of \n2008.  The  economic  growth  rate  of  4.7%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2008  and  4.6%  in  the  second \nquarter of 2008 suggests that these adverse effects are beginning to affect the real economy. \nPrivate  consumption  slowed  from  5.8%  in  2007  to  3.4%  in  the  second  quarter  of  2008  and \nexports  in  value-added  terms  contracted.  These  adverse  developments  have  increased  the \ndownside  risks  to  the  balance  of  payments  and  public  debt  sustainability. 16 ,  17  While  the \nPhilippine central bank (Bangko Sentral ng Philipinas) has been operating a prudent monetary \n\n                                                 \n16  For  example,  a  recent  International  Monetary  Fund  report  simulated  the  impact  of  a  20%  increase  in  global \ncommodity prices on the stability of the Philippines\u2019 balance of payments, measured by foreign reserve coverage in \nmonths of imports. It shows that the simulated price increases would lower reserves between 0.5 and 0.8 months \nof imports, not enough to trigger a balance of payments problem. However, a larger price increase would increase \nthe  vulnerability  of  balance  of  payments.  International  Monetary  Fund.  2008.

The Government deficit fell to P12.4 billion in 2007 (0.2% \nof  GDP)  from  P64.8  billion  in  2006  (0.9%  of  GDP).  This  fiscal  performance  compares  with  a \n2.7% budget deficit in 2005 and 5.2% in 2003. The consolidated public sector budget essentially \nremained  in  balance  for  a  second  consecutive  year  surpassing  the  medium-term  target  of  a \nbalanced budget in 2010 (para. 17). The nonfinancial public sector debt to GDP ratio declined to \n67%, back to its level in the early 1990s (Figure 4). Unlike previous budgets, the reduction in the \ndeficit came about through increases in total revenues rather than suppression of expenditures \n(Appendix 5). In March 2006, PDF stakeholders cautioned against disproportionate reliance on \nexpenditure cuts rather than revenue collection. Noninterest expenditures increased by 19% in \nthe  2007  budget  over  2006  (2005  budget  reenacted),18 aided  by  a  reduction  in  debt  servicing \ncosts  of  P36  billion  from  lower  interest  rates  on  public  debt  and  the  peso  exchange  rate \nappreciation.  Spending  on  the  social  sectors  (health  and  education)  and  public  infrastructure \nwere  the  main  beneficiaries  of  the  boost  in  spending  in  2007,  with  spending  on  infrastructure \nrising  by  45.4%  assured  by  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  earmark  30%  of  incremental \nvalue-added  tax  revenue  collections  to  the  social  sectors.  On  the  revenue  side,  tax  revenue \ncollection increased by 9% over 2006, but fell short of its budget target of 17.3% (para. 18). To \nmeet  the  shortfall  in  revenues,  the  Government  accelerated  privatization  of  assets  raising  \nP90 billion in proceeds, up from P5 billion in 2006. More than 40% came from privatization of \nstate-owned  energy  assets.  One  important  consequence  of  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to \nfiscal discipline is improved investor confidence in the economy as reflected in the international \ncredit-rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s second improved credit rating for the Philippines in 12 \nmonths from \u201cnegative outlook\u201d in 2006, to \u201cstable outlook\u201d in 2007, to \u201cpositive outlook\u201d in 2008. \nFiscal discipline continued into 2008 with the budget deficit at P33.4 billion for the first 7 months \ncompared with P39 billion for the same period in 2007. \n \nIncome  Distribution.  The  sustained  economic \n16. \nexpansion  is  beginning  to  improve  the  Philippines'  stubbornly  high  unemployment  rate  for  the \nfirst time in a decade. Lower long-term economic growth coupled with relatively restrictive labor \nregulations meant higher longer-term unemployment in the Philippines compared to its regional \nneighbors.  In  2007,  the  unemployment  rate  fell  to  an  average  of  7.3%  from  7.9%  in  2006; \nhowever the economic slowdown in 2008 has raised the average unemployment rate. Progress \non  poverty  reduction  and  income  inequality  has  been  less  clear.  The  2006  family  income  and \nexpenditure survey indicates an increase of the poverty rate from 30% in 2003 to 33% in 2006. \nHowever, ADB staff assessments suggest that much of the increase in poverty is attributed to \nenergy  cost  increases  in  2006  rather  than  structural  changes  to  household  incomes  and \ndistribution  as  the  Gini  coefficient  did  not  change  significantly.  Hence,  the  spike  may  be \ntemporary  and  not  a  reversal  of  recent  trends.  Table  2  shows  that  both  poor  and  nonpoor \nfamilies  spent  a  larger  share  of  their  budgets  on  fuel,  energy,  and  transportation  in  2006 \ncompared  to  2003  (Supplementary  Appendix  B).  Recent  World  Bank  projections19 of  poverty \nincidence, measured by the $2 a day poverty line, indicate a reduction in poverty from 46.9% in \n2006  to  44.9%  in  2007  (Supplementary  Appendix  B).  However,  ADB  expects  a  new  spike  in \npoverty in 2008 due to the surge in food prices. ADB poverty impact simulations show that food \nprice inflation is estimated to raise food expenditures of the poor (those living below the poverty \nline) by as much as P50 billion in 2008, including the 7% of the population that are vulnerable to \n                                                 \n18  Congress failed to pass the proposed 2006 national government budget. Consequently, the Government reenacted \nthe 2005 budget for 2006, as permissible under the Philippines constitution. While, Congress approved a budget \nsupplement in mid-2006, overall the reenacted budget resulted in suppressed public spending in 2006.  \n\nUnemployment,  Poverty,  and \n\n19  World Bank. 2008.

In  2006  the  Government  advanced  the  target  to  achieve  a  balanced \nnational budget under the MTPDP by 2 years to 2008, based on the surge in tax revenues in the \n2006  budget  (tax  revenues  grew  1.3  percentage  points  of  GDP  in  2006).  The  2007  budget \ndeficit was recorded at 0.2% of GDP, making the 2008 target highly probable. However, much \nhas  changed  since  the  end  of  2007.  Global  developments  have  deteriorated  and  these  are \nbeginning  to  negatively  impact  the  Philippine  economy,  as  is  the  case  for  the  region.  The \nGovernment  has  decided,  and  development  partners  concur,  that  the  balanced  budget  target \nshould  be  reverted  back  to  2010  to  provide  flexibility  in  fiscal  policy  in  2008  in  the  event \nprograms  are  necessary  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  recent  increases  in  food  prices  on  the  poor \nand  to  maintain  priority  spending  programs  if  the  economy  slows  down.  The  Government  is \ntargeting a deficit of no more than 1% of GDP in 2008, 0.5% in 2009, and a balanced budget in \n2010.  The  2010  target  is  achievable,  but  requires  increased  efforts  to  raise  tax  revenues  to \nmeet the Government\u2019s fiscal program target of 15% of GDP by 2010 (para. 18). \n \n18. \nTax Revenue Performance. BIR cash collection in the first half of 2007 was up 5% over \nthe same period in 2006, and up 9% for the entire year, short of the 2007 budget target for BIR \nof a 17.3% increase over 2006. BOC also experienced a shortfall in collection from its budget \ntarget. Government and ADB assessments of revenue performance in 2007 show that the tax \nshortfall occurred in the first semester of 2007 because of a combination of tax administration, \nmacroeconomic,  and  governance  factors.  These  include  (i)  the  removal  of  the  70%  cap  on \nvalue-added tax credits that contributed to an estimated drop in value-added tax collections of \nP19 billion in the first semester, (ii) front loading of excise tax payments in the fourth quarter of \n2006 to avoid the excise tax hike in January 2007, significantly lowering excise tax collection in \nthe  first  quarter  of  2007,  (iii)  a  surge  in  smuggling  of  petroleum  through  the  Subic  special \neconomic  zone,  and  (iv)  faster  than  expected  appreciation  of  the  peso  exchange  rate  for  the \nyear, resulting in lower value-added tax and customs duties collected on imported products than \noriginally  budgeted.  The  prevalence  of  tax  exemptions 20  and  generous  taxable  income \ndeductions in the growth sectors of the economy limited growth-induced tax collection. Weak tax \nadministration  and  inefficiencies  in  the  tax  policy  indicate  that  BIR  has  been  unable  to  lift  tax \nrevenues  through  improvements  in  tax  efficiency  and  enforcement.  By  mid-2007,  the \n                                                 \n20  The  Department  of  Finance  estimates  tax  holidays  and  other  fiscal  incentives  result  in  foregone  tax  revenues  of \n\nabout P47 billion per year. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n12 \n \n\n \n\nGovernment  undertook  short-term  remedial  actions  that  partially  restored  tax  revenues  to  its \nbudget  targets  with  tax  revenue  collections  growing  by  13%\u201315%  in  the  second  semester  of \n2007  over  the  same  period  in  2006.21 The  recovery  in  tax  revenue  collections  continued  into \n2008 with BIR tax revenue collection rising by about 14% year-on-year for the first 6 months of \n2008, in line with 2008 budget targets and an improvement in the tax to GDP ratio estimated at \nabout 0.26% in 2008 (Figure 4). \n \n\nFigure 3: Public Sector Deficit and Debt\n(as % GDP)\n\nNFPS Debt \n\nNFPS deficit\n\n1990 \n\n1992 \n\n1994 \n\n1996\n\n1998\n\n2000\n\n2002\n\n2004\n\n2006 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, NFPS = nonfinancial public sector        \nSource: Bureau of Treasury, Department of Finance.

Senior  personnel  changes  at  BIR  were  also \nmade in the first semester of 2007 including the replacement of the BIR commissioner. \n\n \n\n \n\nDebt %\n\n110 \n\n100 \n\n90 \n\n80 \n\n70 \n\n60 \n\n50 \n\n40 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nSustaining  Priority  Spending. The Government is targeting an increase in the rate of \n19. \nnoninterest  expenditure  to  GDP  from  12.6%  in  2007  to  13.6%  by  2010.  Ensuring  priority \nspending is sustainable within a balanced budget framework over the medium term will require \nfurther  effort  to  raise  tax  revenues.  Reaching  the  Government\u2019s  revised  medium-term  tax \nrevenue  target  of  15%  of  GDP  by  2010  will  require  additional  reforms  to  tax  policy  and  tax \nadministration. The Department of Finance (DOF) is targeting an increase in tax administration \nefficiency that would add tax revenue collections of up to 0.3% of GDP per year from 2008 to \n2010. To accomplish this target, BIR has developed a comprehensive tax administration reform \nprogram up to 2010, but implementation has been delayed and is much slower than expected. \nThis  is  partly  due  to  the  complexity  of  the  reform  program  and  the  fact  that  BIR\u2019s  budgetary \nresources for long-term reforms are critically constrained as reflected in the continuous decline \nin BIR operating costs per employee since 2000 (Appendix 5). Staff resistance, vested interests, \nand corruption have also contributed to the slow start to reform as it is rolled out to the regional \ntax offices. Staff resistance and corruption are intertwined with BIR\u2019s resource constraints. For \nexample,  starting  salaries  of  legal  staff  at  BIR  is  P12,000  per  month  compared  with  P32,000 \n(plus  P24,000  allowances)  for  legal  staff  at  the  central  bank.  Thus,  the  Government  must \naddress longer-term resource constraints at BIR.22 A draft bill has been submitted to Congress \nthat if passed will allow BIR to set salaries closer to market values. In the short term, BIR should \nfocus  its  efforts  on  priority  areas  of  tax  administration  that  are  likely  to  achieve  the  biggest \nefficiency gains in the short to medium term. These include reforming and increasing the rates \nof  excise  taxes  in  2009,  and  rationalizing  investment  incentives  once  Congress  passes  the \nrevised bill (expected in 2008).23 The anticorruption revenue programs\u2014\u201crun after tax evaders\u201d \n(RATE)  in  BIR  and  \u201crun  after  tax  smugglers\u201d  (RATS)  in  BOC\u2014have  made  some  progress  in \nidentifying  tax  evasion  cases  and  increasing  tax  prosecutions.  But  BIR  and  BOC  will  need  to \ninstitutionalize  these  programs  within  their  organizations  to  ensure  they  become  effective \ndeterrents to tax evasion. At the same time, institutional linkages will need to be strengthened \nbetween  BIR,  Department  of  Justice,  and  Court  of  Tax  Appeals;  and  capacity  developed  to \nensure  effective,  coordinated  effort  in  tax  prosecution.  Strengthening  the  revenue-forecasting \ncapabilities  of  DOF  (and  the  Bureau  of  Treasury)  is  important  to  ensure  realistic  tax  revenue \nforecasts. In response to weak tax revenue performance in the first semester of 2007, ADB is \nproviding  TA  to  BIR  and  DOF  to  strengthen  revenue-enhancing  measures,  enforcement,  and \nprosecution of tax evaders (footnote 4).24 \n \n20. \nDebt Management. Fiscal savings of P36 billion from lower debt servicing costs in 2007 \nclearly demonstrate the importance to fiscal policy of effectively managing public debt and debt \nservicing  costs.  While  progress  has  been  made  in  debt  management,  particularly  lengthening \nthe  average  maturity  of  government  debt  and  maintaining  a  diverse  portfolio  of  obligations, \nmuch  needs  to  be  done  to  improve  the  institutional  framework  for  debt  management.  Current \ndebt management systems at DOF are compartmentalized with separate units in the Bureau of \n\n                                                 \n22  ADB.  2008.

Three  features  are  apparent  from  an  assessment  of  the  various \npublished indicators of governance and corruption in the Philippines. First, the Philippines had \ndeclining ranks in most governance and corruption indicators since 1998, bottoming out in 2004, \nand  improving  since  2005,  except  for  indicators  on  corruption  and  political  stability  (Table  3). \nSecond,  the  Philippines\u2019  scores  for  the  quality  of  legislative  and  regulatory  frameworks  are \nbetter  than  those  for  implementation  of  such  laws  and  service  delivery  (Figure  5).  Third,  on  a \nregional  basis,  Philippines\u2019  scores  for  most  indicators  are  good,  except  for  corruption  and \npolitical stability indicators (Table 4). \n \n\nTable 3: Update on Governance Indicators: the Philippines  \n\n \nYear \n\n1996 \n1998 \n2000 \n2002 \n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \nSource: World Bank. 2008.

Important  bureaucratic  improvements  demonstrate  that  the  Philippines \n22. \ncontinues  to  make  progress  in  targeted  areas  of  revenue  collection  and  expenditure  integrity \nunder the DPSP and other sector programs. Selected improvements include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  momentum  in  the  filing  of  tax  evasion  cases  increased  during  the  second \nyear of operation of the RATE and RATS programs. \nThe  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation  TA  grant  of  $21  million  to  DOF  and  the \nOffice  of  the  Ombudsman  (OMB)  has  helped  strengthen  governance  initiatives \nthrough capacity building of staff in techniques and processes for identifying tax \nevaders  and  smugglers.  The  number  of  corporate  income  tax  returns  filed \nincreased  by  12%  in  September  2007  over  the  2005  program  baseline.  The \nGovernment  recently  surpassed  the  threshold  for  eligibility  for  the  Millennium \nChallenge  Corporation  compact,  which  provides  the  Government  with  possible \naccess to substantial grants to support economic growth-enhancing initiatives. \nA  key  success  is  improved  efficiency  and  transparency  in  reform  of  public \nprocurement.  The  Philippine  Government  Electronic  Procurement  System \n(PhilGEPS),  the  centralized  electronic  government  procurement  system,  is \nmandated \nfor  use  by  all  government  agencies,  government-owned  and  \n-controlled corporations, and LGUs. It completed its first full year of operation in \n2007, with the objective to capture data on bid opportunities and awards starting \nwith  all  12  GPPB  member  departments,  which  includes  the  major  procuring \ndepartments like public works, transportation, education, and health. \nOMB  has  completed  an  additional  11 \nin \ngovernment  agencies.  It  has  developed  action  plans  and  established  integrity \ndevelopment  committees  in  government  agencies  perceived  as  being  the  most \ncorrupt  by  respondents  to  the  social  weather  survey  of  2006  (BIR,  BOC,  Land \nTransportation Office). \nGovernment-owned  power  sector  assets  worth  $7.7  billion  were  privatized  in \n2007 within a clear rules-based, transparent, and competitive framework. \n\nintegrity  development  reviews \n\n \n23. \nHowever,  perceptions  about  corruption  persist  and  the  Government  must  continue  to \nmake  credible  progress  in  governance  and  anticorruption  initiatives  in  its  revenue  and \nexpenditure management programs. In this regard, beginning to institutionalize these programs \nwithin government agencies to ensure they are sustainable over the longer term will be a crucial \nundertaking for the Government.  \n \nProcurement.  The  2006  country  procurement  assessment  report, 26  comparing  the \n24. \nPhilippines  public  procurement  system  with  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and \nDevelopment  (OECD)  benchmarks,  gave  the  Philippines  a  high  score  for  its  legislative  and \nregulatory framework, and good scores for integrity and transparency in the public procurement \nsystem,  institutional  framework,  and  management  capabilities.  But  the  Philippines  does  less \nwell in procurement operations, monitoring, and enforcement (Figure 5). GPPB, responsible for \nimplementing the law, with input from development partners developed a 3-year action plan to \nensure  that  (i)  the  law  is  fully  implemented,  and  (ii)  weaknesses  identified  in  the  country \nprocurement assessment report are addressed. The action plan includes a comprehensive set \nof measures to strengthen the institutional framework, capacity building of procurement officers, \nand  enforcement.  Most  recently  the  Government  issued  an  executive  order  to  establish  a \nprocurement transparency group comprising government representatives from key procurement \nagencies and civil society groups. The group will track and monitor the procurement process in \n\n                                                 \n26 GPPB. 2007. 2006 Country Procurement Assessment Report.

Implementing improved systems for PEM, including \nthe MTEF, which aligns the budget planning process with strategic objectives and priorities, is \nintegral  to  improving  PEM  efficiency,  and  therefore  sustainable  priority  spending.  Progress  is \nbeing  made.  DBM  continues  to  increase  use  of  the  MTEF  in  preparing  the  2008  budget \nincluding preparing a budget strategy paper and disseminating forward estimates for 3 years for \nall  22  departments.  The  OPIF  that  links  budget  allocations  to  management  performance \nindicators has been rolled out to all national government line departments. The second edition \nof  the  OPIF,  Performance  Budget  of  Departments  for  2008,  was  submitted  to  Congress  to \nsupport the 2008 budget proposal. The Government intends to roll out the OPIF to the rest of \ngovernment,  the  constitutional  office,  state  colleges  and  universities,  and  the  legislative  and \njudiciary.  Additional  measures  to  increase  PEM  transparency  and  accountability  were \nimplemented by posting budget releases and disbursements of priority programs and projects of \nselected  departments  as  well  as  payments  made  to  external  creditors  on  the  DBM  website. \nHowever, during implementation of subprogram 2 triggers for PEM, the Government, ADB, and \nother  development  partners  identified  several  core  areas  to  be  addressed,  beginning  with \nbudget preparation through to budget execution and reporting, which will require a much longer-\nterm and coordinated effort in capacity development (paras. 26-28). \n  \n26. \nBudget  Preparation  and  Credibility.  Initial  reviews  show  several  gaps  in  budget \npreparation including the need for strengthening the multiyear perspective in fiscal planning and \nbudgeting  and  key  to  this  is  rolling  out  the  MTEF  to  line  ministries  and  involving  them  in \ncomputing  the  forward  estimates  necessary  to  ensure  the  MTEF  is  institutionalized  within  the \ngovernment. The link between the forward estimates to budget ceilings must be strengthened to \nensure fiscal discipline in the medium term. Often in-year reallocations of the approved budget \nbetween  line  agencies  undermines  the  credibility  of  the  budget  composition,  defined  as  the \nextent  to  which  the  budget  is  realistic  and  is  implemented  as  intended.  Public  access  to  key \nfiscal  information  in  the  budget  documents  needs  to  be  improved,  including  presentation  of \nbudget documents for public consumption. Finally, revenue forecasts for budget preparation are \noften ambitiously set in most years in part arising from weaknesses in forecasting capabilities at \nDOF.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nBudget  Execution  and  Controls.  The  Government,  ADB,  and  other  development \n27. \npartners  have  identified  several  gaps  in  budget  execution  to  be  addressed  in  the  short  and \nlonger  term.  These  include  weaknesses  in  recording  and  management  of  cash  balances  as \nmore than one treasury account makes reconciling balances difficult; monthly (and even daily) \ncash  forecasting  capabilities  of  the  Bureau  of  Treasury  to  improve  predictability  of  the \navailability  of  funds  for  commitment  to  expenditures  during  the  budget  cycle;  payroll  controls, \ninternal  controls  for  nonsalary  expenditures,  and  internal  audits  within  line  ministries,  and \noversight  by  Commission  of  Audit.  DBM  is  in  the  process  of  establishing  internal  audit  units \nwithin  line  ministries.  Also  of  importance  are  the  rollout  of  the  program,  establishment  of  the \nindependence  of  the  internal  audit  units,  and  reporting  and  internal  audits  of  special  purpose \nfunds.  \n \nBudget  Accounting,  Recording,  and  Reporting.  Accounts  reconciliation  lacks \n28. \ntimeliness and in-year budget reports on obligations, cash releases and allotments, obligations, \nand  disbursements  are  not  timely,  and  thus  do  not  allow  effective  tracking  of  indicators  of \nbudget efficiency. The key underlying cause of weaknesses in budget execution, recording, and \nreporting is the absence of an integrated government financial management information system \n(GFMIS). The current manual recording of accounts payable results in frequent reporting delays \nfrom line ministries and regions to DBM. The Government is developing the initial components \nof  the  GFMIS  such  as  the  eBudget  (electronic  releasing  and  programming  of  the  budget), \neNGAS  (electronic  national  accounting  system),  and  PhilGEPS  (electronic  government \nprocurement system); but these are fragmented and, except for the PhilGEPS, coverage is low. \nIt  pretested  and  pilot  tested  the  e-Budget  system  in  the  first  quarter  of  2008  before  rollout  to \nregional offices. Completing the design and development of the GFMIS over the medium term \nwill  be  important  to  enhance  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  services  and  improve \ntransparency. \n \n\n3. \n\nInvestment Climate \n\n29. \nInvestment Growth. While investment showed healthy signs of recovery in 2007, much \nneeds  to  be  done  to  place  it  on  a  sustainable  path.  ADB  staff  estimates  suggest  that  the \nPhilippines  is  underinvesting  in  physical  capital  by  as  much  as  5  percentage  points  of  GDP \ncompared  with  its  long-run  equilibrium  rate.  The  Government\u2019s  increased  public  spending  on \ninfrastructure has increased the investment rate (Figure 6). It will need to continue this to reach \nrates  on  par  with  regional  neighbors  of  about  5%  of  GDP,  and  to  implement  measures  to \nincrease  private  investment,  such  as  improving  the  investment  climate  (lowering  regulatory \ncosts),  trade  facilitation,  and  rural  development;  and  establishing  a  transparent  framework  for \ninfrastructure  development,  including  improving  the  resource  efficiency  of  public  infrastructure \nspending as a corollary to fiscal consolidation efforts. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n18 \n \n\n \n\n0\n1990\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n-20\n\n-40\n\n-60\n\n. \n\nFigure 6: Investment Growth\n\npublic construction\n\nprivate construction\n\n1992\n\n1994\n\n1996\n\n1998\n\n2000\n\n2002\n\n2004\n\n2006\n\nSource: National Statistical Coordination Board\n\n \n\n \nRegulatory  Costs.  The  2007  Philippines:  Critical  Development  Constraints27 reiterates \n30. \nthe  importance  of  investment  (both  physical  and  human  capital)  to  sustain  high  economic \ngrowth in the long run. The report highlights several critical constraints to growth, including tight \nfiscal space; inadequate infrastructure, particularly in electricity and transport; and governance \nconcerns. The Doing Business 2008 report28 indicates the time and cost involved in launching a \nbusiness  in  the  Philippines  in  2007  did  not  improve  from  2006.  The  devolution  of  licensing \nfunctions  to  LGUs,  a  cumbersome  business  registry  system,  duplication  of  functions  between \nnational  agencies  and  LGUs,  and  proliferation  of  laws  related  to  fiscal  incentives  have \ncontributed  to  relatively  high  regulatory  costs.  The  Government  is  gradually  developing \nregulations in some sectors, but in an ad hoc manner as no government-wide system is in place \nto systematically review the regulatory impacts of proposals by decision makers.29 The National \nCompetitiveness  Council  has  drafted  and  advocated  a  framework  for  institutionalizing  a \nregulatory impact assessment within government and to guide the formulation of an action plan \n(paras. 56 and 64).  \n \n31. \nTrade  Facilitation.  In  the  early  1990s,  the  Philippines  undertook  major  trade  policy \nreforms including reducing average import tariff rates to about 8% in 2000, and dismantled most \n(but not all) nontariff barriers. Trade facilitation costs remain relatively  high. Depending on the \nproduct, exporters and importers must deal with several different government agencies to obtain \npermits. In all, about 40 different government agencies issue regulations or permits on exporting \nand  importing  goods.  Until  recently,  the  Department  of  Agriculture  had  five  separate  agencies \ndealing with certification of different kinds of commodities. The Philippines is not yet a member \nof  the  Kyoto  Protocol  for  Customs  that  promotes  transparency  and  efficiency  in  customs \nprocedures  and  operations.  Customs  has  not  yet  completed  the  full  rollout  of  Asycuda,  the \ncustoms  information  management  system,  which  promotes  arms-length  transactions  between \nimporters and customs officials, and produces timely trade and customs data collection. As an \narchipelago nation, relatively low trade facilitation costs are crucial for competitiveness (para 33). \n \n32. \nRural  Investment  Climate.  The  Critical  Development  Constraints  report  (footnote  28) \nhighlights  constraints  in  the  rural  economy  that  have  been  a  drag  on  investment  and  poverty \n                                                 \n27  ADB. 2007.

The  2007  midterm  progress  report  on  achievement  of  the  Millennium  Development \nGoals 30 reiterates  the  need  to  improve  the  rural  investment  climate,  especially  connectivity \nbetween farmers and urban markets and the creation of an enabling environment for developing \noff-farm income-generating activities, as key to lowering poverty in rural regions. Constraints to \nrural  investment  and  poverty  reduction  include  poor  rural  road  infrastructure,  costly  shipping, \nand logistics. Protection from imports is relatively high in the agriculture sector, and especially \nhigh for rice milling, coffee, pig raising, and sugar and sugar milling, resulting in higher costs to \ndownstream producers and consumers (Appendix 4). Recent international evidence is pointing \nto  the  positive  role  of  supermarkets  in  rural  economy  development  through  investments  in \nefficient procurement practices, distribution centers, contract farming, and export channels. The \nGovernment partially deregulated the retail sector in 2000, but remaining restrictions still deter \nforeign  investment.  The  recent  surge  in  food  prices  has  refocused  attention  on  the  inefficient \nsubsidy  programs  and  the  need  for  policies  to  improve  agricultural  productivity,  connectivity \nbetween  the  rural  and  urban  economies,  and  the  rural  investment  climate  and  infrastructure. \nADB assistance in this sector has helped address some of these rural investment climate issues, \ne.g.,  the  Infrastructure  for  Rural  Productivity  Enhancement  Sector  Project  (footnote  11).  ADB \nhas  programs  in  the  pipeline  including  project  preparatory  TA  for  the  proposed  integrated \nnatural resources and environmental management sector development program, which includes \nthe formulation of an uplands development strategy. \n \nInadequate  Infrastructure.  Studies  and  surveys  on  the  Philippines  indicate  trade \n33. \nfacilitation costs (from factory to port) are relatively high on a regional basis. The World Bank\u2019s \nlogistics  performance  index  ranks  Philippines  65  out  of  150  countries.31 A  breakdown  of  the \ncosts  shows  that  costs  related  to  infrastructure  (road,  rail,  and  domestic  shipping)  account  for \nthe  higher  costs.  The  logistics  survey  shows  that  the  Philippines  performs  well  in  terms  of \ncustoms  facilitation  (ranked  53  out  of  150  countries),  domestic  logistics  costs  (rank  19),  and \ninternational  shipments  (rank  63);  but  below  the  median  for  infrastructure  (rank  86).  Public \nspending  on  infrastructure  at  about  2.7%  of  GDP  in  2007  is  at  half  its  average  in  the  1990s. \nThus,  increasing  infrastructure  spending  is  crucial  to  lowering  domestic  and  foreign  trade \nfacilitation  costs  and  therefore  economic  growth.  In  2007,  the  National  Economic  and \nDevelopment  Agency  (NEDA),  the  Government  planning  agency,  identified  and  presented \nprojects at the PDF\u2014a positive step for increasing infrastructure investment. Much more needs \nto  be  done  to  encourage  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure,  including  public\u2013private \npartnerships, by reducing risks and uncertainty, clarifying rights and obligations in joint ventures \nbetween private and public sectors in infrastructure investments, and standardizing procedures. \nThe Bureau of Treasury law needs to be revised to ensure transparency of policies relating to \naward of concessions, issuance of public guarantees, and provision of public subsidies. This will \nincrease  the  confidence  of  private  operators  and  financiers  in  government  commitments. \nTransaction quality needs to be ensured through a transparent project preparation and bidding \nprocess,  and  timely  contract  completion  through  better  performance  management  by  project \nmanagers and appropriate links to incentives and sanctions to minimize cost overruns.  \n \n\n                                                 \n30  Asian  Development  Bank,  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  and  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme.  2007.

The \npoor are heavily concentrated in agriculture, or the nonwage (informal) sector. In contrast, the \nnonpoor  are  more  likely  to  be  in  wage  employment  in  the  nonagriculture  sector.  While  the \nnonpoor are more likely to benefit from remittances sent by family members working overseas, \nADB  staff  estimates  still  suggest  that  remittances  reduced  the  national  poverty  rate  by  \n5 percentage points (Supplementary Appendix B). Disparities in the incidence of poverty across \nregions are significant. A negative relationship exists between subnational per capita GDP and \npoverty  incidence.  Poverty  incidence  is  low  in  the  National  Capital  Region,  Central  and \nSouthern  Luzon,  Ilocos,  and  Central  Visayas,  where  per  capita  GDP  is  above  the  national \nmedian. Much higher poverty incidence is recorded in regions with relatively low per capita GDP, \nsuch  as  the  Autonomous  Region  of  Muslim  Mindanao,  Mindanao,  Bicol,  and  Eastern  and \nWestern  Visayas.  A  look  at  poverty  magnitude\u2014the  total  number  of  poor  people\u2014presents  a \nsomewhat different picture of regional disparities, as the areas with low poverty incidence tend \nto have larger populations, and vice versa. About one in five poor Filipinos live in the National \nCapital Region and the surrounding provinces (e.g., Batangas, Cavite, Laguna, Quezon, Rizal, \nZambales). \n \n35.  Millennium Development Goals. The 2007 midterm progress report on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (footnote 31) indicates that halfway to the 2015 target year, the Philippines \nhas  made  considerable  progress  in  some  areas  (particularly  in  reducing  poverty;  improving \ngender  equality;  reducing  child  mortality;  combating  HIV,  AIDS,  malaria,  and  other  diseases; \nand improving access to safe drinking water and sanitary toilet facilities). However, challenges \ncontinue  in  the  areas  of  universal  access  to  education,  maternal  mortality,  and  access  to \nreproductive health services. Access to primary education has dropped. The net enrolment rate \nfell  from  97%  in  2000  to  84%  in  the  2005/06  school  year,  representing  a  setback  to  the  2015 \ntarget  of  universal  access.  The  report  shows  uneven  progress  and  wide  disparities  across \nregions. Most of the lagging regions and provinces are in Mindanao, while the frontrunners are \nin  Luzon.  The  National  Capital  Region,  Ilocos  Region  (Region  1),  Cagayan  Valley  (Region  2), \nWestern Visayas (Region 6), Central Visayas (Region 7), and Southern Mindanao (Region 11) \nconsistently lead for most indicators. The rest of the country\u2019s regions lag in most of the targets. \nTable 5 presents a snapshot of Philippine progress compared with its regional neighbors.  \n \n\nTable 5: Progress on Millennium Development Goals: Regional Comparison \n\n1 \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIndonesia \n\nMalaysia \n\n\u2022   \u2207  \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\n\u2022   \u0398  \n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\u2022   \u0398  \n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\nPhilippines  \u0398   \u0398   \u2207   \u2207  \nThailand \n\n \n\ni\n\ng\ne\nw\nr\ne\nd\nn\nU\n\n \nn\ne\nr\nd\n\nl\ni\n\nh\nc\n \nt\nh\n\n \nt\nn\ne\nm\no\nr\nn\nE\n\nl\n\n \ny\nr\na\nm\n\ni\nr\n\nP\n\ni\n\n \ng\nn\nh\nc\na\ne\nR\n\n \n5\n \ne\nd\na\nr\ng\n\n \nn\no\ni\nt\ne\np\nm\no\nc\n\nl\n\n \ny\nr\na\nm\n\ni\nr\n\nP\n\n \nr\ne\nd\nn\ne\nG\n\n \ny\nr\na\nm\n\ni\nr\np\n\n \ny\na\nd\n/\n1\n$\n\n \ny\nt\nr\ne\nv\no\np\n\n \ny\nt\ni\nl\n\na\nt\nr\no\nm\n\ny\nt\ni\nl\n\na\nt\nr\no\nm\n\n \nt\nn\na\nf\nn\nI\n\nl\n\n \ne\nc\nn\ne\na\nv\ne\nr\np\n\n \n\nI\n\nV\nH\n\nl\n\ne\nc\nn\ne\na\nv\ne\nr\np\n\n \ny\nr\na\nd\nn\no\nc\ne\ns\n\n \n5\n \nr\ne\nd\nn\nU\n\n \ny\nr\na\ni\nt\nr\ne\nt\n\n \n \nr\nr\ne\ne\nd\nd\nn\nn\ne\ne\nG\nG\n\u2022   \u0398   \u0394 \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\n\u0394 \n\u0394 \n\u2022   \u2207  \n\u0394 \n\u0394 \n\u2022  \n\u0394 \n\u2022   \u2207  \n\n\u0394 \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\n \n\nB\nT\n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\n \nl\na\nr\nu\nr\n\ne\nt\na\nr\n\n \nn\na\nb\nr\nu\n\n \nn\na\nb\nr\nu\n\n \nr\ne\nt\na\nW\n\n \nh\nt\na\ne\nd\n \nB\nT\n\n \nn\no\ni\nt\na\nt\ni\nn\na\nS\n\n \nn\no\ni\nt\na\nt\ni\nn\na\nS\n\n \nl\na\nr\nu\nr\n \nr\ne\nt\na\nW\n\u2022   \u2207   \u0398   \u0398   \u0398  \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\u2022   \u2207   \u0398   \u0394  \u0398  \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u0394 \n\n\u2022  \n\nViet Nam \n\n\u2022  \n\u2022   \u2207   \u0394  \u2207   \u0398  \n\u2022  Early achiever;  \u0394 On track;  \u0398  Slow;  \u2207 No progress or regressing. \nSource:  Asian  Development  Bank,  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  and  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme. 2007.

Poverty  reduction  programs  should  focus  on  the \ndimensions of poverty highlighted in paras.  34 and 35. The Government will need to increase \ninvestment  in  education  and  infrastructure,  particularly  in  the  MDG  lagging  regions.  Targeted \npoverty reduction programs, such as the proposed conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, are \na  useful  way  to  link  social  assistance  with  human  capital  development.  The  success  of  this \ndemand-side  intervention  will,  to  a  large  extent,  depend  on  supply-side  readiness,  i.e.,  the \navailability of quality education and health services in the CCT program areas.  \n \nCatching Up with the MDGs. Fiscal austerity measures introduced from 2001 to 2006 \n37. \nto reduce the Government deficit disproportionately hurt social policy expenditures. This is one \nof the reasons the Philippines is having difficulty meeting some of its MDG targets, particularly \nthose in education and health. During 2001\u20132005, the share of central Government spending on \nthe  social  sector  was  22%  in  the  Philippines,  compared  with  45%  in  Thailand  and  37%  in \nMalaysia (footnote 32). The share of public expenditure on education fell from 3.0% of GDP in \n1991 to 2.7% in 2005, as compared to 6.2% in Malaysia and 4.2% in Thailand. In 2004, public \nexpenditure on health as a share of GDP  was 1.4% in the Philippines compared with 2.2% in \nMalaysia and 2.3% in Thailand.32 Weak governance and inequality in resource allocation have \nalso  contributed  to  poor  social  sector  outcomes.  The  Government  is  well  aware  of  these \nproblems and is committed to improving quality and access to basic education and health care, \nreversing recent declines in performance. The 2007 budget allocated substantial real increases \nto  the  social  sector  (6%  over  the  2006  budget).  The  proposed  budget  for  2008  increased \nallocations  to  the  education  and  health  sectors  by  about  11%.  The  increased  share  for  the \nDepartment  of  Education  (DepEd)  will  provide  larger  allocations  for  teacher  recruitment, \ntextbooks,  new  school  buildings,  and  repair  and  maintenance  of  existing  schools;  this  is  to \nwiden  coverage  and  improve  quality.  The  Government  intends  to  move  to  a  needs-based \nformula for allocating school funding. In the health sector, the Government adopted the Formula \nOne for Health implementation framework for health sector reforms in the medium term (2005\u2013\n2010).  The  overall  goal  is  to  improve  the  quality,  efficiency,  effectiveness,  and  equity  of  the \nhealth system, particularly for the poor. ADB\u2019s Health Sector Development Program (footnote 12) \noffers  one  example  of  how  systematic  provincial  public  expenditure  reviews  and  the  use  of \nprogrammatic initiatives can help effect improvements to local service delivery. \n \nSocial Protection. ADB actively participated in policy dialogue on social sector issues in \n38. \n2007 primarily through the PDF Working Group on MDGs and Social Progress. In a number of \nworking sessions in 2006 and 2007, the subgroup on social protection, led by the Department of \nSocial Welfare and Development (DSWD), refined the definition of social protection, using the \nADB  definition  as  a  model.  In  February  2007,  NEDA  issued  Social  Development  Committee \nResolution No. 1, series of 2007, on Adopting a Philippine Definition of Social Protection. The \nresolution recognizes the need for a common framework in designing and implementing social \nprotection programs, and sets out that social protection \u201cconstitutes policies and programs that \nseek to reduce poverty and vulnerability to risks and enhance the social status and rights of the \nmarginalized  by  promoting  and  protecting  livelihood  and  employment,  protecting  against \nhazards and sudden loss of income, and improving people\u2019s capacity to manage risks.\u201d The four \ncomponents of social protection are (i) labor market programs, or measures aimed at enhancing \nemployment  opportunities  and  protection,  and  the  rights  and  welfare  of  workers;  (ii)  social \ninsurance, or programs that seek to mitigate income risks by pooling resources and spreading \nrisks across time and classes; (iii) social welfare, or preventive and development interventions \nthat seek to support the minimum basic requirements of the poor; and (iv) social safety nets and \nstop-gap mechanisms, or urgent responses that address effects of economic shocks, disasters, \n\n                                                 \n32  United Nations Development Programme. 2007. Human Development Report. New York. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n22 \n \n\n \n\nand calamities on specific vulnerable groups. The resolution includes examples of each of these \ncomponents  and  recommends  that  all  concerned  government  entities  adopt  and  use  the \ndefinition. \n \nConditional  Cash  Transfer  Program.  With  the  aim  of  refining  targeted  programs  for \n39. \npoverty  reduction,  in  2007,  DSWD  designed  a  new  CCT  program,  known  as  the  Pantawid \nPamilyang  Pilipino  Program.  The  program  falls  under  the  social  welfare  category  of  the \nPhilippine definition of social protection. With more than a decade of implementation experience \nand  proven  results,  particularly  in  Latin  America,  CCT  programs  provide  income  support \nconditional  on  human  capital  investments,  such  as  sending  children  to  school  or  attending \nhealth  clinics,  thus  reducing  the  risk  of  future  poverty.  CCTs  have  additional  benefits  that \ninclude  reduced  child  labor  and,  as  cash  benefits  are  often  paid  directly  to  mothers,  the \nempowerment of women. The program goal is to build the human capital of children aged 0\u201314 \nfrom the poorest families. The cash grants will be linked to five conditions: (i) pregnant women \nreceive  pre-  and  postnatal  care  beginning  in  the  1st  trimester  of  pregnancy,  and  the  birth  is \nattended by a skilled health professional; (ii) parents attend parent effectiveness service classes; \nregular  preventive  health  checkups  and  vaccines;  \n(iii)  children  aged  0\u20135 \n(iv) children aged 3\u20135 attend day-care or preschool programs; and (v) children aged 6\u201314 are \nenrolled  in  school  and  demonstrate  at  least  an  85%  attendance  rate.  These  conditions  are \nselected to address the persistent human development bottlenecks, including high infant, child, \nand  maternal  mortality  rates;  malnutrition;  low  completion  rates  in  primary  education  and  low \nprogression to secondary education; and high prevalence of child labor. The CCT program was \npiloted  tested  from  June  to  December  2007  covering  6,000  households  in  the  provinces  of \nAgusan del Sur and Misamis Occidental, and the cities of Pasay and Caloocan. Two targeting \ninstruments  are  being  tested  in  the  prepilot:  the  community-based  monitoring  system  (CBMS) \nand  a  proxy  means  test.  DSWD  recognizes  that  using  uniform,  objective,  and  transparent \ncriteria to select beneficiaries is crucial for the success of the program. With the recent external \nprice  shocks,  the  Government  has  decided  to  scale  up  the  program  to  cover  321,000 \nhouseholds nationwide. \n \nC. \n\nLessons \n\nreceive \n\nIn  the  process  of  assessing  implementation  progress  of  triggers  for  subprogram  2 \n40. \n(Appendix 7), several lessons were identified for formulating subprogram 2 and designing policy \ntriggers for subprogram 3. These include the following:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nNumerical  targets  such  as  the  tax  revenue  to  GDP  ratio  should  be  cautiously \nused as triggers. Numerical targets that are ambitiously set and not supported by \na realistic reform timetable are likely to fail.  \nIf  necessary,  triggers  should  be  supported  by  TA,  such  as  the  subprogram  2 \nPEM triggers.  \nThe  Government  and  ADB  identified  gaps  in  Government  budget  execution, \ninternal  audit  and  controls,  and  reporting  underpinned  by  an  underdeveloped \ngovernment  computerized  accounts  system.  The  Government  asked  ADB  for \nlonger-term integrated TA to strengthen the Government\u2019s PEM framework. \nThe  program  cluster  with  triggers  contains  adequate  flexibility  to  respond  to \nlessons  identified  during  implementation  and  to  incorporate  new  Government \npolicy  priorities  such  as  the  CCT  program  (para.  39).  Once  rolled  out,  the  CCT \nprogram  will  be  an  important  vehicle  for  social  assistance  in  response  to \neconomic shocks, such as the recent surge in food price inflation. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  Government  has  implemented  several  important  fiscal,  governance,  and \nanticorruption programs, such as the MTEF in DBM, RATEs program at BIR, and \nthe OMB\u2019s integrity development reviews. Going forward, institutionalizing priority \nprograms within agencies will be important to ensure long-term sustainability. \nJudicial reform is important to increase judicial performance and credibility in tax \nprosecution cases. ADB is assisting tax prosecution through TA on tax revenue \ncollection.  This  will  complement  the  proposed  governance  and  justice  reform \nprogram,  which  lays  out  a  longer-term  reform  program  and  capacity  building  in \nthe justice subsector (footnote 7). \n\n \n41. \nAs  a  result,  subprogram  2  incorporates  several  new  important  policy  accomplishments \nthat  have  enhanced  the  Government\u2019s  agenda  in  the  four  core  areas,  as  well  as  addresses \nimplementation  difficulties  with  some  triggers  identified  during  implementation.  Subprogram  3 \nwill focus attention on institutionalizing priority programs of the Government with greater weight \non investment climate, poverty reduction, and PEM. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  subprogram  2  will  be  sustained  economic  expansion,  lower \n42. \nunemployment,  and  reduced  poverty  through  improved  fiscal  sustainability,  public  financial \nmanagement, a better investment climate, and improved delivery of public services. \n \n43. \nthe Government\u2019s reform agenda. These reforms are designed to accomplish the following:  \n \n\nThe DPSP cluster includes a series of policy reforms that underpin the key priorities of \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nto  budget  execution,  accounting, \n\nImprove  fiscal  sustainability,  maintain  macroeconomic  stability,  and \nimprove  creditworthiness  by  enhancing  the  quality  of  fiscal  management  by \n(a) increasing  tax  revenues  annually  for  the  next  2  years  (i.e.,  2008\u20132009) \nthrough tax policy reforms; (b) strengthening tax administration and enforcement, \nand  reducing  revenue  leakages  through  improved  governance;  (c)  reducing \ninefficient spending to permit increased social and poverty-related spending; and \n(d)  strengthening  the  debt  management  strategy  to  manage  government \ncontingent liabilities and risks prudently. \nEnhance  governance  in  PEM  by  (a)  improving  PEM  from  budget  preparation \nreporting;  \nthrough \n(b)  strengthening  performance  management  and  improving  public  service \ndelivery;  (c)  reforming  procurement;  and  (d)  implementing  anticorruption  and \nenforcement  strategies  for  revenue-collecting  agencies  and  key  procurement \nagencies.  \nrural  development  by  \nImprove \n(a)  clarifying  and  strengthening \nfor \ninvestments and trade, (b) facilitating infrastructure development through greater \npublic\u2013private  participation  and  greater  coordination  of  public  infrastructure \ninvestments, and (c) improving rural\u2013urban connectivity.  \nReduce  poverty  and  increase  social  inclusion  by  improving  the  policy \nframework for social protection, sustaining real spending on health and education, \nimproving targeting of programs, improving service delivery, and introducing the \nCCT program tied to performance outcomes in child education and health.  \n\ninvestment  climate  and  promote \n\nlegal  and  regulatory \n\nrecording,  and \n\nframework \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n24 \n \n\n \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\nB. \n \n44. \nThe  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  for  subprogram  1  of  the  DPSP \nidentified  11  policy  triggers  for  subprogram  2  (footnote  1).  In  the  process  of  assessing \nimplementation  progress,  the  Government  proposed  a  few  key  changes  (Appendix  7  provides \nan assessment of subprogram 2 triggers): \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nto \n\nfor \n\ntax \n\n14% \n\ngrowth \n\nrevenue \n\ncollection \n\nTax revenue to GDP. While the tax trigger is assessed as partially accomplished \nthe  \nrecovered \nas \n12  months  ending  June  2008  and  therefore  the  tax  revenue  to  GDP  ratio \nincreased  by  about  0.26%,  the  Government  asked  to  eliminate  this  numerical \ntrigger  and  shift  the  focus  to  remedial  actions  to  enhance  tax  collection  in \nsubprogram  2  and  priority  revenue-enhancing  measures  in  subprogram  3  to \nachieve  its  medium-term  revenue  targets.  In  this  way,  the  Philippine  DPSP  is \naligned  to  ADB\u2019s  approach  taken  in  Indonesia,  which  avoids  setting  numerical \ntargets  as  triggers  and  instead  focuses  on  broad  policy  measures  aimed  at \nenhancing revenue sustainability. Numerical targets are appropriately monitored \nthrough  the  design  and  monitoring  framework.33 The  Philippine  DPSP  specifies \nthe medium-term tax revenue to GDP target of 15% by 2010.   \nSocial  protection.  The  Government  recommended  adding  a  new  trigger  to \nreflect  emerging  policy  priorities  in  2007.  The  Government  views  strengthening \nprograms to the poor and vulnerable groups as a priority in view of the country\u2019s \nvulnerability  to  frequent  natural  disasters,  and  recent  exogenous  shocks  to  the \neconomy  such  as  the  surge  in  food  price  inflation.  In  this  context,  the \nGovernment  proposed  a  new  trigger  on  social  protection,  namely,  adopting  a \nnew definition of social protection to lay the groundwork for better programs and \nreforms over the medium term (para. 38).  \nSupport  for  the  procurement  reform.  During  2007,  the  Government  asked \nADB to increase attention on the procurement reform program and, in particular, \nsupport  for  its  transparency  measures.  As  a  result,  the  subprograms  2  and  3 \ninclude additional reform measures for procurement, including establishment and \noperationalization of the procurement transparency group. \n\n \n45. \nIn total, the Government and ADB are focusing on 11 policy triggers (Appendix 2, policy \nmatrix).  Most  are  supported  by  26  measures  to  clearly  outline  a  blueprint  for  government \nimplementing  agencies  to  follow  and  execute,  while  a  few  measures  have  definitive  outputs \n(e.g.,  establish  a  body,  action  plan,  and  capacity  building  and  training  programs).  The \nGovernment has made substantial progress in completing these measures. Of the 11 triggers, it \nhas  fully  or  substantially  accomplished  9,  and  partially  accomplished  2.  All  of  the  26  other \nmeasures were accomplished in 2007 and 2008. \n \n46. \nProgress in achieving the DPSP performance indicators and targets set out in the design \nand  monitoring  framework  for  subprogram  1  and  updated  for  subprogram  2  (Appendix  1)  has \nbeen substantial. Of the 18 performance indicators, 6 are assessed as early achievements (i.e., \nsurpassed or expected to surpass medium-term targets set for the end of the program cluster in \n2009),  8  are  on  track  to  achieve  medium-term  targets,  one  has  progressed  slowly,  two  have \n                                                 \n33  The Indonesian DPSP 3 includes a tax revenue policy trigger as follows: Improve value-added tax by reducing the \ntime for refunds. The trigger does not specify a numerical target, but is monitored through a performance target in \nthe design and monitoring framework that specifies. Reduce the time to obtain [value-added tax] refund from 12 to \n18  months.  ADB.  2007.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\nregressed  from  their  baselines  (tax  revenue  to  GDP  target  and  the  elementary  school  cohort \nsurvival rate), and updated data not yet available for the remaining indicator. As a result of the \nbetter than expected performance, the Government and ADB have agreed to increase 3 output \nindicators.  In  recognition  of  the  expanded  agenda  for  subprograms  2  and  3,  the  Government \nand ADB agreed to add 5 new indicators and targets (Appendix 1). \n \n47. \nIn the spirit of the DPSP cluster, which aims to support the Government\u2019s policy reform \nagenda  on  a  continuous  basis  rather  than  through  predetermined  rigid  conditions,  the \nGovernment  asked  that  the  substantial  progress  be  recognized.  Furthermore,  as  individual \nloans  under  the  DPSP  cluster  are  sequenced  to  provide  continuous  support  in  a  predictable \nmanner,  it  asked  ADB  and  the  development  partners  to  remain  fully  engaged  as  part  of  the \nongoing  dialogue,  support  and  continuously  monitor  implementation  and  completion  of  the \nremaining  policy  trigger,  and  provide  longer-term  TA  for  strengthening  PEM  capacity.  ADB\u2019s \nprogram cluster approach provides for such flexibility in reform programs that are implemented \nover time, by taking emerging circumstances into account. \n \n\n1. \n\nAccomplishments under Subprogram 2 \n\n48. \nSubprogram  2  focuses  on  four  of  the  seven  core  policy  areas  outlined  by  the  PDF: \nimprove  fiscal  sustainability,  maintain  macroeconomic  stability,  and  improve  creditworthiness; \nimprove governance in PEM and reduce corruption; strengthen the investment climate and rural \ndevelopment; and reduce poverty and increase social inclusion.  \n \n\na. \n\nImprove  Fiscal  Sustainability,  Maintain  Macroeconomic  Stability, \nand Improve Creditworthiness \n\n49. \nFiscal Discipline. The Government\u2019s immediate objectives are to balance the budget by \n2010  and  reduce  nonfinancial  public  sector  (NFPS)  debt  to  65%  of  GDP  by  2009.  In  2007  (i) \nreduction  of  the  national  government  deficit  to  0.2%  of  GDP  in  2007,  a  consolidated  public \nsector  surplus  in  2006,  and  a  deficit  of  0.1%  in  2007  surpassed  program  expectations  and \ncontributed significantly to the recent upgrade of the country\u2019s credit rating by Standard & Poor\u2019s \nin  early  2008;  and  (ii)  corresponding  with  the  improved  budget  situation,  nonfinancial  sector \npublic debt fell from 87% of GDP in 2005 to 74% in 2006 and 67% in 2007 on track to exceed \nthe Government\u2019s medium-term target of 65% of GDP by 2009, and return to debt levels of the \nearly 1990s. The national government debt decreased from 72% in 2005, to 64% in 2006, and \n59% in 2007. \n\n50. \nTax  Revenue  Sustainability.  While  tax  revenues  fell  short  of  budget  targets  in  2007, \nrecovery occurred in the second semester of 2007 and continued through to the first 6 months \nof  2008  to  partially  bring  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  tax  targets  back  on  track.  The \nrecovery in tax revenues was achieved by remedial actions including increased inspections and \nuse  of  legislative  instruments  such  as  tax  amnesties  to  recover  taxes  in  arrears.  During \nsubprogram  2,  the  Government  initiated  medium-term  actions  for  revenue  sustainability \nincluding DOF\u2019s submission of its revised investment incentives rationalization bill, which aims \nto  streamline  investment  incentives,  to  the  new  Congress  at  the  end  of  2007.  Congress  is \nexpected to pass the bill in 2008. While tax administration reforms were slow to begin, progress \nincludes  cleaning  the  taxpayer  database,  identifying  unregistered  corporations  (about  9,429 \nregistered at the Securities and Exchange Commission) and inactive taxpayers in the database \n(162,352 taxpayers), and beginning to address the backlog of registrations. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n26 \n \n\n \n\nDebt Management.

The  Government\u2019s  immediate  objectives  are \nto implement the MTEF and OPIF, and improve transparency in budget planning and execution. \nThe  2008  budget  is  based  on  a  more  refined  MTEF  drawn  from  an  improved  budget  strategy \npaper  and  forward  estimates  for  2008\u20132010  developed  with  all  22  departments  and  their \nattached  agencies.  The  indicative  budget  ceilings  for  departments  and  agencies  based  on \nforward estimates were issued for the first time. The MTEF promotes fiscal discipline by setting \nforward budget estimates for agencies (over 3 years), which promotes strategic prioritization of \nmedium-term  spending  objectives,  supported  by  the  budget  strategy  paper  that  analyses \nspending  constraints  and  options  for  government.  The  Government  continued  to  strengthen \npublic sector performance management through the rollout of the performance-based budgeting \nprocess  by  DBM  through  the  adoption  of  the  OPIF,  which  identifies  the  contribution  and \nalignment  of  programs  and  activities  of  line  agencies  to  their  major  final  outputs  that  directly \nsupport  national  and  sector  goals.  The  Government  has  now  rolled  out  the  OPIF  to  all  22 \ndepartments, incorporated OPIF implementation in the 2008 budget, and incorporated the OPIF \nin the 2009 budget call. The Government printed the second edition of the OPIF book for 2008. \n \n53. \nTransparency  in  Budget  Execution.  DBM  has  made  gradual  progress  in  improving \ntransparency in the budget with the following key measures in 2007 and 2008. DBM posted on \nits  website  detailed  2007  data  on  all  payments  to  contractors  for  central  offices  and  four  pilot \nregions of the DepEd, DOA, DOH, and DPWH. A link with the DPWH website was established \nas payments to contractors are uploaded on the DPWH website. The Government encountered \ndifficulties  implementing  this  policy  trigger  due  to  the  underdeveloped  government  financial \ninformation management system. Consequently, to accomplish this trigger DBM had to scan all \ndocuments  from  the  agencies  and  then  post  them  on  its  website,  requiring  considerable  time \nand human resources. This underpinned the necessity of developing an integrated GFMIS. The \npolicy  trigger  on  detailed  data  on  allotments  and  quarterly  cash  releases  by  central  offices  of \nDepEd,  DOA,  DOH,  and  DPWH.  disclosed  retroactively  on  the  DBM  website  encountered \nsimilar  difficulties.  Hence,  DBM  elected  to  publish  data  on  the  allotment  releases,  obligations, \nand disbursements on the major programs and projects of the four departments for 2007. To the \nextent that data could be secured on the outputs and impacts of these projects, these data were \nalso posted to signify the Government\u2019s thrust to greater results orientation and accountability. \nFinally,  DOH  submitted  its  2008  budget  proposal  to  DBM  based  on  a  new  budget  structure \nconsistent  with  its  major  final  output.  Three  other  departments  (DepEd,  DOA,  DPWH) \ndesignated to submit budget proposals on the new budget structure under subprogram 2 were \nunable to do so as DBM had not approved their rationalization plans. However, the Government \nremains committed to restructuring department budgets in line with major final outputs under the \nOPIF to improve the budget\u2019s readability and performance focus. \n \nProcurement. The following set of key measures was undertaken in 2007 and 2008 to \n54. \nimprove  transparency  and  efficiency  in  public  procurement.  The  PhilGEPS  completed  its  first \nyear of full operation, with all bid notices and more than 77% of all procurement results (award \nnotices,  failed  bids,  canceled  bids,  and  short-listed  bids)  posted\u2014a  major  achievement  in \nimproving  transparency  and  competition  in  procurement.  The  Government  issued  Executive \nOrder  662A  to  create  a  procurement  transparency  group  to  promote  public  monitoring  and \nenhance transparency of the public procurement system, as mandated under the procurement \n\n \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nlaw. The group comprises representatives from GPPB, key procurement agencies, and six civil \nsociety  organizations  (CSOs)  nominated  by  the  CSO  Forum,  a  voluntary  gathering  of  major \nCSOs.  The  six  CSOs  are  the  Bishops\u2013Businessmen  Conference,  Makati  Business  Club, \nTransparency and Accountability Network, Ateneo Government Watch, Confederation of Filipino \ntransparency  group  will  be \nConsultants,  and  Procurement  Watch  The  procurement \noperationalized  under  subprogram  3  and  will  start  with  tracking  procurement  of  selected \ninfrastructure  projects  from  the  time  the  bid  notice  is  posted  to  selection  of  the  winning  bid. \nGPPB  produced  a  3-year  action  plan  for  2007/10  with  concrete  measures  to  implement  the \n2003 procurement law. \n \n55. \nExpenditure  Integrity.  OMB  and  DBM  completed  integrity  development  reviews  in  \n11  agencies  in  2007,  in  addition  to  5  completed  under  subprogram  1.  The  reviews  use  a \ncorruption  diagnostic  instrument  that  examines  an  agency's  practices and  procedures  for  their \nvulnerability to corruption. OMB has placed resident officers in the departments to help develop \nand implement an action plan on a voluntary basis, as buy-in from the department is considered \nnecessary for successful implementation. To implement and monitor progress on action plans in \nthe  agencies,  OMB  has  established  integrity  development  committees  in  BIR,  BOC,  DOH, \nDPWH, LRA, and LTO. The committees include membership from the CSOs. All  six agencies \nare in different stages of implementing their action plans; DOH is currently the most advanced. \nFinally, subprogram 2 supports the Government\u2019s efforts to reduce revenue leakage through its \nanticorruption  and  collusion  initiatives  such  as  RATE,  RATS,  and  revenue  integrity  protection \nsystem  (RIPS).  As  of  December  2007,  cases  filed  with  the  Department  of  Justice  included  \n112 cases for tax evaders filed under the RATE program; 52 smuggling cases filed under RATS, \nof which 11 cases have been filed with the Court of Tax Appeals; and 70 cases filed under RIPS. \nAs  of  September  2007.  OMB  has  suspended  18  officials  charged  by  the  RIPS  program.  To \nimprove investigation and prosecution of tax and graft cases, the Government with assistance \nfrom  the  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation  has  strengthened  OMB  and  DOF,  and  as  a  result \nincreased  the  conviction  rate  of  cases  filed  by  OMB  before  the  anticorruption  court,  the \nSandiganbayan,  from  25%  in  September  2006  to  56%  for  2007.  An  objective  of  the  RATE \nprogram  is  to  increase  the  number  of  individual  and  corporate  tax  returns  filed  with  BIR.  By \nSeptember 2007, individual tax returns had increased by 4% from the baseline 487,594 returns \nreported  in  2005,  and  corporate  income  tax  returns  were  up  by  12%  in  2007  from  134,151  in \n2005. \n \n\nc. \n\nStrengthen the Investment Climate and Infrastructure \n\nInvestment Climate Reforms and Infrastructure. The Government\u2019s main objective is \n56. \nto  increase  the  share  of  investment  and  infrastructure  spending  in  the  GDP.  Reform  areas  of \ncritical  significance  targeted  under  the  DPSP  include  (i)  clarifying  and  strengthening  the  legal \nand  regulatory  framework  for  investments;  and  (ii)  facilitating  infrastructure  development,  and \npromoting  rural  development  through  a  better  investment  climate.  Subprogram  2  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s  efforts \nin  2007.  The  National \nCompetitiveness  Council  drafted  and  advocated  a  framework  for  addressing  bureaucracy \nthrough a regulatory review assessment with assistance from ADB TA on competitiveness. The \nframework  will  provide  the  basis  for  an  action  plan  to  institutionalize  regulatory  review \nassessments within government under subprogram 3. The Government issued Circular No. 137 \n(30 July 2007) mandating NEDA to approve national agency proposals for changes to fees and \ncharges, and streamlined visa procedures for foreign investors. The Department of Trade and \nIndustry continues to advocate for improvements in LGU business registration by publishing a \nhandbook on best practices. To improve the policy framework for infrastructure investments, the \n\ntransaction  costs \n\nreduce  business \n\nto \n\n \n\n\f \n\n28 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nNEDA  Infrastructure  Committee  submitted  a  list  of  priority  investment  projects  to  DBM  at  the \nstart of budget preparation. \n\nd. \n\nReduce Poverty and Increase Social Inclusion \n\n57. \nThe  DPSP  supports  the  Government\u2019s  agenda  to  improve  the  social  sectors  by \nincreasing  funding,  improving  governance  in  the  budget  process  and  procurement, \nengaging  civil  society  in  monitoring  procurement,  and  improving  targeting  of  poverty \nreduction programs. Reform areas of critical significance targeted under subprogram 2 include \n(i) NEDA issued Social Development Committee Resolution No. 1, series of 2007, on Adopting \na  Philippine  Definition  of  Social  Protection,  which  lays  the  foundation  for  reforming  social \nprotection programs and assistance (para. 38); (ii) the Government continued the rollout of the \nCBMS  for  poverty;  as  of  March  2008,  32  cities,  and  46  provinces  (21  provincewide)  had \nadopted the CBMS, and more than 11,758 barangays (communities) were at varying stages of \nimplementation;  and  (iii)  DSWD  designed  the  Pantawid  Pamilyang  Pilipino  Program,  a  CCT \nprogram  where  benefits  are  linked  to  meeting  selected  education,  health,  and  nutrition \nrequirements;  and  pilot  tested  it  from  June  to  December  2007  covering  6,000  of  the  poorest \nhouseholds in the provinces of Agusan del Sur and Misamis Occidental, and the cities of Pasay \nand Caloocan.  \n \n\n2. \n\nTriggers for Subprogram 3 \n\n58. \nThe  development  policy  letter  sets  out  the  Government  reform  agenda  for  the  next  \n1\u20132 years, building on the reform momentum of subprograms 1 and 2. Triggers for subprogram \n3 are described in Appendix 2. \n \n\na. \n\nImprove Fiscal Sustainability, Macroeconomic Stability, and \nCreditworthiness \n\n \n59. \nFiscal  Policy.  Subprogram  3  has  four  fiscal  triggers.  The  first  two  are  to  achieve  a \nnational government budget deficit of not more than 1% in 2008 and remain on track to achieve \na balanced consolidated public sector budget. Subprogram 3 recognizes that some flexibility in \nthe  budget  balances  is necessary  to  protect  priority  spending  in  the  social  sectors (education, \nhealth,  and  social  assistance)  and  infrastructure  in  the  event  the  economy  slows  down  faster \nthan  expected  and  the  surge  in  food  rice  inflation  has  a  material  impact  on  the  welfare  of  the \npoor. The third trigger is to establish the debt and risk management office as a middle office to \nintegrate debt management functions in DOF. \n \n60. \nTax  Administration.  The  fourth  trigger  is  to  complete  the  cleaning  of  the  corporate \ntaxpayer database initiated under subprogram 2, and make substantial progress in encoding the \nbacklog of tax registration and tax return files. \n \n61. \nImpact and Outcomes. By the end of 2009, the DPSP-supported program is expected \nto  have  improved  the  Philippines  macroeconomic  fundamentals  and  economic  growth  rate. \nFiscal  sustainability  will  have  improved  by  2010  as  reflected  by  the  balanced  national \ngovernment and consolidated public sector budgets. Public debt will have fallen, supported by \nthe  mobilization  of  additional  tax  revenues  of  0.9  percentage  points  of  GDP  over  this  period. \nCorresponding  with  revenue  mobilization,  public  expenditure  increased  by  1.0  percentage \npoints. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n29\n\nb. \n\nStrengthen Governance in Public Expenditure Management \n\n \n62. \nThere  are  six  triggers  to  support  institutionalization  of  governance  programs  focus  on \nkey aspects of developing an efficient PEM system, internal control, and greater transparency in \nprocurement.  The  first  trigger  will  continue  the  rollout  of  the  MTEF  by  ensuring  that  forward \nestimates produced by DBM include greater information on and linkage to program outputs from \ndepartments and agencies to strengthen the interrelationship between the MTEF and OPIF. A \nsupporting  milestone  includes  the  computerization  of  forward  estimates,  which  would  allow \ntimely computation of budget ceilings by line ministries. The second trigger will be DBM initiating \ndevelopment of the GFMIS starting with a diagnostics of the GFMIS scope and requirements. A \nsupporting  milestone  will  be  to  produce  a  longer-term  PEM  reform  program  supported  by  TA \nfrom  ADB  and  other  development  partners.  The  next  two  triggers  will  continue  progress  in \nimproving  transparency  in  procurement  with  greater  involvement  of  CSOs.  These  two  triggers \nrelate  to  expanding  the  coverage  of  the  PhilGEPS  to  three  non-GPPB  member  departments \n(Department  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources,  DENR,  DOA,  and  DSWD)  in  2009  in \ncompliance with the procurement law. This will require significant process changes in the three \ndepartments to ensure compliance with the PhilGEPS. The Government will expand coverage \nto  the  remaining  seven  national  departments  in  2010  (these  departments  have  relatively  low \nprocurement budgets). GPPB will operationalize the procurement transparency group and start \ntracking  selected  infrastructure  projects.  The  fifth  trigger  starts  reforms  of  internal  controls, \nformulation  of  national  guidelines  for  internal  control  standards,  and  pilots  of  the  guidelines  in \none  department  and  one  agency.  The  final  trigger  is  to  institutionalize  the  RATE  program  by \nstrengthening it with permanent staff, budget, operating procedures and guidelines, and training \nprogram. \n\nthe  delivery  of  public  services,  and \n\n \n63. \nImpact  and  Outcomes.  By  the  end  of  2009,  the  DPSP  is  expected  to  have  improved \nthe  budget  allocation  of  resources  and  efficiency  through  strengthened  institutional  and \nreporting frameworks by linking the medium-term development plan and/or priorities of national \ndepartments  with  the  budget  process  (via  the  MTEF).  This  will  improve  performance \nmanagement  and \ntransparency, \naccountability, and monitoring of public procurement. More departments will have an MTEF, and \ncompleted  the  rollout  of  the  OPIF  to  constitutional  bodies  (e.g.,  state  universities).  The \nGovernment made progress in developing the GFMIS to improve efficiency in budget execution, \nrecording, and reporting. Internal control will be established in two agencies with the rollout to \nother  line  ministries  beginning  in  2009.  All  publicly  bid  opportunities  and  awards  of  central \noffices of 22 national departments will be posted on the PhilGEPS. The anticorruption revenue \nprograms will continue to increase the number of tax returns. \n \n\nto  greater \n\nlead \n\nc. \n\nImprove Investment Climate and Infrastructure \n\n \nSubprogram  3  has  two  investment  policy  triggers.  The  first  trigger  is  to  promote  a \n64. \ngovernment-wide  approach  to  regulatory  reform  where  the  Government  will  adopt  and  begin \nimplementing  an  action  plan  for  institutionalizing  a  regulatory  review  within  Government.  The \naction  plan  will  include  establishment  of  an  oversight  agency  or  unit  mandated  to  advocate \nregulatory impact assessments across government. This will be a long-term effort. The second \ntrigger  assesses  bottlenecks  in  distribution  of  agriculture  products  from  farmer  to  supermarket \nand/or traditional market, and defines appropriate public sector options for addressing identified \nbottlenecks. This would prepare the foundation for a broader rural investment climate strategy \nand  support  proposed  ADB  sector  activities  in  its  uplands  strategy  and  watershed  projects. \nSupporting  milestones  include  the  Philippines  ratifies  the  Kyoto  Protocol  for  Customs,  and \nestablishes and operationalizes a single national electronic widow to improve trade facilitation. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n30 \n \n\n \n\nIn infrastructure policy, the medium-term objective is to establish a public\u2013private infrastructure \npartnership  project  preparation  facility.  In  the  interim,  the  Government  will  accomplish  the \nfollowing  milestones:  develop  a  set  of  standard  transaction  documents  for  public\u2013private \npartnerships; issue a set of guidelines to govern joint ventures between government and private \nsector  entities;  and  formulate  a  strategy  for  risk  assessment  and  management,  particularly  for \ninfrastructure projects approved by the Development Budget Coordination Committee. \n \n65. \nImpact and Outcomes. By the end of 2009, the DPSP-supported program is expected \nto have improved the Philippine investment climate. The investment to GDP ratio is expected to \nincrease  from  14%  GDP  in  2006  to  16%\u201317%  by  2009  and  the  share  of  public  investment  in \nGDP  to  increase  by  1\u20132  percentage  points.  This  progress  will  be  achieved  by  reducing  the \ntransaction  costs  of  doing  business  (as  reflected  in  reduced  number  of  days  to  start  up  a \nbusiness), lowering trade facilitation costs, and increasing private participation in infrastructure.  \n \n\nd. \n\nReduce Poverty and Increase Social Inclusion \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nSubprogram  3  has  one  social  policy  trigger.  The  Government  is  to  expand  the  CCT  to \n66. \n321,012  households.  Supporting  milestones  will  be  completion  of  the  CBMS  rollout  and \nproduction  of  a  poverty  monitoring  report  by  NEDA  for  submission  to  senior  government \npolicymakers.  \n \n67. \nImpact  and  Outcomes By the end of 2009, the DPSP will have improved systems for \npoverty  monitoring  and  targeting.  The  majority  of  LGUs  will  have  adopted  the  CBMS;  and \nGovernment MDG targets for elementary and high school survival rates, and child immunization \ncoverage  will  be  on  track  to  meet  the  2015  targets.  The  CCT  pilots  will  be  complete,  and  a \nsustainable CCT designed, and implementation under way.  \n \nC. \n \n68. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $250,000,000  to  finance  the  Subprogram  2, \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's \nLondon interbank-offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose  set  forth  in  the  draft  program  loan  agreement  presented  to  the  Board.  The  Government \nhas  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these \nchoices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or \nadvice from ADB. \n \n69. \nThe  ADB  funds  are  to  support  reforms  outlined  in  the  development  policy  letter  and \npolicy matrix (Appendix 2). The loan size was determined by the strength of the policy package, \nits  development  impact,  the  importance  of  the  sectors  covered,  adjustment  costs,  direct \nbudgetary  costs,  and  the  development  financing  needs  of  the  Government,  as  estimated  by \nDOF. Direct adjustment costs include (i) reductions in the revenue of the relevant agencies as a \nresult  of  reductions  in  red  tape  under  the  action  plan  for  institutionalizing  regulatory \nassessments; (ii) costs of carrying out improvements to the PEM systems, including the GFMIS, \nand  establishing  systems  for  disclosing  budget  releases  and  disbursements  on  the  DBM \nwebsite,  (iii)  costs  of  implementing  the  tax  administration  reform  program,  and  (iv)  costs  of \ninstitutionalizing the anticorruption programs in revenue-collecting agencies. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n31\n\nThe program loan reflects the development financing needs of the Government (Table 6). \n70. \nWhile  the  DPSP  supports  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  balance  the  national  government  and \nconsolidated public sector budgets by 2010, the DPSP also recognizes the need for flexibility in \nthe national government budget for 2008. The Government aims to increase development and \nsocial spending in 2008 and, given the need for additional funding to mitigate the effects of the \nslowdown  in  the  US  economy  and  the  surge  in  rice  prices  on  the  poor,  the  Government \nenvisages a targeted government deficit of no more than 1% of GDP in 2008 and 0.5% of GDP \nin 2009 with a balanced budget in 2010. According to DOF budget reports, the gross external \nfinancing requirements for 2008 are estimated at $2.8 billion. The Subprogram 2 proposed loan \namount of $250 million will help close the financing gap for 2008.  \n \n\nTable 6: Projected Government Financing Requirements for 2008 \n\n \n\nProposed Amounts in 2008 ($) \n\nFinancing Mix 2008 \n \n      Programmed gross external borrowings \n       of which: \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s proposed loan pipeline \n\nDPSP  \nLGU finance reform  \nGovernance and justice reform \nOther aid and commercial borrowingb \n\n \n2.5 billion \n \n \n250.0 million \n300.0 million \n100.0 million \n\n1.85 billion \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, DPSP = Development Policy Support Program, LGU = local \ngovernment unit,. \nSources: Department of Finance and Asian Development Bank.

DOF  will  be \nfor  overall  program \nimplementation  activities,  reporting  to  ADB,  administering  and  disbursing  the  Loan  proceeds, \nand  maintaining  accounts.  DBM  and  NEDA  shall  be  the  implementing  agency  responsible  for \nimplementing  subprogram  2,  and  shall  be  supported  by  the  relevant  line  agencies  including \nDepEd,  DA,  DOH,  DPWH,  DTI,  and  OMB.  The  DPSP  coordinating  committee  initiated  under \nsubprogram  1,  chaired  by  the  DOF  undersecretary  and  comprising  officials  from  DOF,  DBM, \nand NEDA, will be responsible for coordinating implementation and sustaining the DPSP policy \nactions together with DBM and relevant line agencies involved in supporting the DPSP (DepEd, \nDOA,  DOH,  DPWH,  and  OMB).  The  committee  will  meet  quarterly  to  monitor  progress  and \noversee  program  implementation.  ADB  may  be  invited  to  participate  in  the  meetings  as  an \nobserver.  DOF  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  program  implementation  activities,  and  will \nreport on implementation progress.   \n \n \n \n72. \nthe policy matrix were implemented between April 2007 and August 2008. \n \n \n \n \n\nThe subprogram 2 period is from 1 April 2007 to 30 October 2008. All actions included in \n\nImplementation Period \n\n2. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n32 \n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement  \n\n \n73. \nThe program loan of $250 million will be released in a single tranche upon satisfactory \ncompletion of all conditions in the subprogram 2 policy matrix (Appendix 2). The loan proceeds \nwill be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  no  more  than  180  days  before  the \neffectiveness  date  of  the  loan.  Items  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  8)  and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources are excluded. In accordance with the \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for \nProgram Loans (1998), the loan proceeds will be disbursed to the Republic of the Philippines as \nthe Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required if during each year that loan \nproceeds are expected to be disbursed the value of Philippines total imports minus imports from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during \nsuch  year.  The  Government  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal \nrequest.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required. \nDisbursements will be made under the simplified procedures for program loans. In accordance \nwith  the  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for  program  loans,  all \ngoods  and  services  produced  and  originating  in  ADB  member  countries  will  be  procured,  with \ndue  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard \npublic  procedures  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods \ncommonly  traded  on  the  international  commodity  market  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \nprocedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB.  \n \n74. \ncounterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the subprogram 2 loan.  \n \n\nThe  reform  needs  supported  under  the  DPSP  will  be  financed  by  local  currency \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n\n75. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Program  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Program. \n \n76. \nA  core  component  of  the  DPSP  cluster  focuses  on  governance  and  reduction  of \ncorruption in key national government agencies vulnerable to such practices. The DPSP cluster \nincludes  reforms  to  PEM  through  the  MTEF,  and  measures  to  improve  transparency  and \naccountability  in  the  budget  cycle  in  agencies  with  large  procurement  budgets  (e.g.,  DepEd, \nDOA,  DOH,  and  DPWH).  The  DPSP  supports  implementation  of  the  procurement  reform  law \nand  measures  to  improve  transparency  in  the  procurement  process  (para.  78).  The  DPSP \nsupports the work of OMB and DOF in reducing corruption in key revenue-collecting agencies of \nBIR and BOC through such anticorruption initiatives as the RATE, RATS, and RIPS programs \n(para.  56).  The  DPSP  cluster  supports  OMB\u2019s  integrity  development  reviews  of  key  national \ngovernment  agencies  as  a  way  of  identifying  weaknesses  in  national  government  agency \nsystems  and  procedures  that  may  increase  their  vulnerability  to  corruption,  and  implementing \naction  plans  to  address  these  vulnerabilities.  Subprogram  3  supports  the  Government \n\n \n\n\f \n\n33\n\ninstitutionalizing these governance and anticorruption programs within the relevant agencies to \nassure their longer-term sustainability and effectiveness. \n \n77. \nThe  country\u2019s  financial  management  systems  were  assessed  prior  to  subprogram  1  in \n2007 to better understand fiduciary risks and determine appropriate fiduciary arrangements for \nthe  purpose  of  the  DPSP.  This  assessment  was  updated  for  subprogram  2.  The  update  is \nbased  on  diagnostic  work  done  in  the  last  12  months  including  the  public  expenditure  and \nfinancial  accountability  assessment  led  by  the  World  Bank,  with  ADB  participation  during  the \nfirst  stage.  The  assessment  identified  core  areas  to  be  addressed  with  development  partner \nsupport.  Discussions  with  the  Government  during  implementation  of  the  PEM  triggers  under \nsubprogram 2 and its ongoing PEM reforms were also considered. Based on this assessment, \nthe  fiduciary  arrangements  proposed  for  the  DPSP  remain  acceptable.  The  assessment \nindicates  that  the  Government  has  made  progress  in  improving  systems  related  to  PEM, \nfinancial accountability, and procurement; although weaknesses remain and continued progress \non  implementing  the  Government\u2019s  program  to  improve  governance  and  reduce  corruption  is \nessential. The Government places significant emphasis on making progress in implementing the \nMTEF in line ministries and the OPIF; improving the credibility of the budget, its execution, and \nreporting;  as  well  as  implementing  other  transparency  measures.  In  this  regard,  the  proposed \nADB policy and advisory TA is designed to support the Government (DBM) to strengthen PEM \ncapacity. \n \n78. \nAssessments of the Philippines\u2019 public procurement reforms show substantial progress, \nas mandated by the procurement law and the issuance of implementing rules. The empowered \nGPPB  is  overseeing  implementation  to  make  sure  that  transparency,  efficiency,  and \naccountability  principles  of  the  law  are  carried  out.  The  PhilGEPs  system  has  completed  a \nsuccessful  first  full  year  of  operation  making  progress  in  improving  transparency.  The  2007 \ncountry procurement assessment report (footnote 27) gave the Philippines a high score for its \nlegislative and regulatory framework, but it does less well in procurement operations, monitoring, \nand enforcement. In response, GPPB with input from development partners developed a 3-year \naction plan to ensure full implementation of the law, and address weaknesses identified in the \nreport. A major reform is the establishment of a transparency group. \n \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n79. \nADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s  certification  for  withdrawal  applications.  Before  withdrawal,  the  Government  will \nopen  a  deposit  account  at  the  central  bank  (Bangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas)  to  receive  all  loan \nproceeds.  The  account  will  be  managed,  operated,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  terms \nsatisfactory to ADB. DOF will be required to submit quarterly progress reports as well as a final \nreport on the progress of subprogram 2 implementation. \n \n\n6. \n\nPerformance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n\n \n80. \nIn cooperation with the DPSP coordinating committee (para. 71) and other development \npartners, ADB will carry out periodic reviews of program implementation, and assess the impact \nof the DPSP. The Government will keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with \nother  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  that  have  implications  for  DPSP  implementation,  and \nprovide  ADB  with  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  ADB,  in \ncollaboration with the coordinating committee, will undertake a review of program performance \n8 months after loan effectiveness to review the outcome of subprogram 2 and begin preparation \nof  subprogram  3.  In  addition  to  the  review  report,  the  committee  will  submit  to  ADB  within  8 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n34 \n \n\n \n\nmonths  of  loan  effectiveness  of  the  subprogram  2,  a  review  report  that  assesses  compliance \nwith,  and  impact  of,  the  agreed  actions  under  subprogram  2  and  subject  to  the  Borrower\u2019s \nreadiness to continue with the DPSP cluster, defines requirements for adjustments to activities \nto be undertaken under the proposed subprogram 3 of the DPSP. In addition, participants in the \nPDF  (partner  agencies,  CSOs,  and  other  stakeholders)  will  be  encouraged  to  support  civil \nsociety monitoring of the DPSP reforms. \n \n81. \nThe  Government  and  its  development  partners  have  agreed  on  the  updated  outcome \nand  output  indicators  to  monitor  DPSP  implementation  and  evaluate  its  impact,  within  the \noverall DPSP framework (Appendix 1). \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n82. \nIn  connection  with  subprogram  2,  a  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (PATA) \ngrant  is  proposed  to  support  capacity  development  in  PEM.  The  PATA  is  estimated  to  cost \n$1,150,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide $800,000, to be financed by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram.  The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  $350,000  equivalent  by  providing \ncounterpart  staff  and  other  facilities.  A  team  of  international  and  national  consultants  will \nimplement the PATA activities. ADB will engage a consulting firm or individuals, in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. A total of 50 (19 international and 31 national) \nperson-months  of  consulting  will  be  required.  The  PATA  purpose,  outputs,  methodology, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  budget  are  in  Appendix  9,  and  the  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nExpected Impacts \n\nA. \n \n83. \n \n\nThe key benefits expected from the DPSP are as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nProgress  toward  medium-term  fiscal  sustainability  will  promote  macroeconomic \nstability  and  foster  broad-based  economic  growth,  job  creation,  and  poverty \nreduction, all of which are cornerstones of the Government\u2019s MTPDP and PDF. \nAn  increase  in  tax  revenues  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  will  provide  additional \nresources for spending on the social sectors and therefore have a direct positive \nimpact on the poor. \nBetter governance in PEM will improve prioritization and efficiency of spending in \nkey sectors such as the social sector. \nLower  transaction  costs  for  business,  because  of  the  reduction  in  bureaucracy \nwill  open  new  opportunities,  increase  investment  and  productivity,  boost  the \neconomy, increase incomes, and create jobs. \nHigher \ninvestment, create jobs, and raise incomes. \nImproved  social  sector  outcomes  will  result  from  increased  spending,  better \ntargeted  social  assistance  programs,  and  implementation  of  the  CCT  program \nlinked to better outcomes for child education and health.  \nSustainability  of  key  governance  programs  will  be  facilitated,  as  the  DPSP \nsupports the institutionalization of governance programs including the MTEF and \nintegrity  development  reviews.  DOF\u2019s  anticorruption  revenue  initiatives  in  BIR \nand BOC will help support the sustainability of these initiatives. \n\ninfrastructure  spending  will  generate \n\nlong-term  growth,  stimulate \n\n \n\n\f \n\n35\n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe DPSP is subject to the following risks. \n\nB. \n \n84. \n \n\n(i) \n\nA sharp slowdown in the US economy and turbulence in its capital markets affect \ngrowth conditions in the Philippines economy and negatively impact fiscal policy. \nThe surge in food price inflation persists in 2008, slowing household consumption \nand economic growth, and threatening to increase poverty. ADB staff estimates \nsuggest that food price increases of 30% could increase poor families\u2019 spending \non rice by up to P50 billion, including 7% of the population that are vulnerable to \nfalling  into  poverty.  However,  these  effects  may  be  mitigated  by  the  continued \nresilience  of  remittances,  which  are  up  by  14.5%  in  dollar  terms  (20%  in  peso \nterms)  in  the  first  4  months  of  2008  over  the  same  period  in  2007.  The  DPSP \nprovides fiscal flexibility by providing for the national government budget deficit of \nup to 1% of GDP in 2008. \n\n(iii) \n\n(ii)  With  the  economic  stresses  in  2008  and  an  election  in  2010,  the  Government \nmay be tempted to introduce populist policies that could threaten fiscal discipline \nin 2008 and 2009, and economic efficiency. \nThe  2010  presidential  elections  may  slow  implementation  of  reforms.  However, \nthe  Government  has  full  ownership  of  the  DPSP  reform  program,  which  is \nembedded  in  the  Philippines  development  forum  and  its  sector  strategies. \nMoreover  the  first  DPSP  generation  of  reforms  is  expected  to  be  completed \nbefore the next elections. \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n85. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nCounterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  development  needs  as  outlined \nunder the DPSP implementation arrangements. \nThe  policies  and  actions  taken  prior  to  the  date  of  subprogram  2  of  the  DPSP \nloan  agreement,  as  described  in  the  development  policy  letter  (including  the \npolicy matrix), will continue to be in effect for the duration of subprogram 2 and \nsubsequently. \n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n86. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$250,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for the Development  Policy Support Program, \nSubprogram  2  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of \n15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Program Loan Agreement presented \nto the Board. \n \n \n \n \n8 September 2008 \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n \nDesign \nSummary \nImpact  \n \n \n(i)   Sustainable \n\nhigher economic \ngrowth \n\n \n \n \n(ii)  Reduced \n\nunemployment \n\nOutcome \nImproved investor \nconfidence \n\nOutputs \n \n1.

Better economic management has contributed to this turnaround in the \neconomy.  However,  much needs to be done to increase the investment rate to sustain higher \neconomic growth above 6 % per annum over the medium term. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nLong-Term Economic Performance. Available data and discussions with stakeholders \nindicate  that  the  long-term  performance  of  the  economy  is  improving.  The  current  economic \nexpansion  is  the  longest  in  three  decades,  with  economic  growth  above  4%  per  annum  since \n2000 or averaging 5.1% per year, compared with an average annual growth rate of 2% in the \n1990s. Asian Development Bank (ADB) staff estimates indicate that the Philippines\u2019 potential or \nlong-term economic growth rate is increasing in line with structural change in the economy and \nis  estimated  at  about  6%  (Figure  A4.1).  In  terms  of  per  capita  income,  growth  has  averaged \n2.2% per annum since 2003, compared with an average annual rate of 0.3% per annum in the \n1990s and a negative 0.8% rate in the 1980s. While per capita income growth since 2003 is at it \nhighest rate in three decades, it remains below the regional average of 3.6%, primarily because \nof a much higher population growth rate than in neighboring countries. Higher and sustained per \ncapita income growth is necessary to reduce poverty. \n \n\na. Business Cycle and Potential Economic Growth \n\n \n\nb.

Economic growth since 2000 has closely followed \n3. \npotential  economic  growth  suggesting  the  expansion  is  based  on  improved  economic \nfundamentals. In particular, economic growth in the past 3 years is associated with historically \nlow \nfiscal \nconsolidation;  declining  public  debt  as  a  share  of  GDP  back  to  levels  of  the  early  1990s;  the \nlongest  ever  running  current  account  surplus;  and  higher  total  factor  productivity  growth  \n(para.  5).  In  contrast,  previous  expansions  were  associated  with  sharp  fluctuations  in  growth \naround  long-term  trends  and  substantial  macroeconomic  imbalances  including  high  inflation, \nincreasing public debt, and at times deterioration in the balance of payments\u2014all features of a \nboom\u2013bust business cycle not based on economic fundamentals. Political instability also helped \nshorten economic expansions in the 1980s and 1990s. \n \nto  better  economic \n4. \nfundamentals in the last decade. Selected examples of improved economic governance include \nthe major trade policy reforms undertaken since the early 1990s, improved competition policy in \nkey  areas  of  telecommunications,  air  transportation,  financial  sector,  and  most  recently  the \npower subsector and tax reforms. After years of endemic corruption and mismanaged monetary \npolicy, the central bank was reformed under new legislation in 1993 to become among the best \ngoverned and credible central banks in the region. With greater autonomy, professionalization of \nstaff,  and  development  of  appropriate  monetary  tools  including  inflation  targeting  adopted  in \n2000,  the  central  bank  has  successfully  lowered  inflation  to  well  under  10%  per  annum  \n(Figure  A4.2).  The  country\u2019s  macroeconomic  management  has  improved  when  benchmarked \nagainst  neighboring  economies  such  as  Indonesia,  with  inflation  and  national  government \ndeficits below regional averages in recent years (Table A4).  \n \n\nImproved  Economic  Management.

In contrast to previous growth spurts, total factor productivity \n(a  measure  of  improved  economic  efficiency)  as  a  driver  of  economic  growth,  increased \nsignificantly  over  the  last  decade  (Figure  A4.3).  From  2000  to  2006,  total  factor  productivity \ngrowth  averaged  2.4%  per  annum,  compared  with  an  average  zero  growth  in  the  1990s  and \nnegative productivity growth in the 1980s. The growth occurred across major economic sectors \nand  especially  surged  in  the  services  sector  associated  with  growth  in  high  value-added \ninformation technology services. Microeconomic reforms in the 1990s and 2000s contributed, as \nthe  economy  adjusted  to  trade  reforms  (i.e.,  lower  import  protection),  competition  reforms  in \nmajor  sectors  noted  earlier,  and  financial  sector  reforms.  Measures  of  import  protection  show \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n57\n\nthat  the  Philippine  economy  is  now  relatively  open  with  low  protection  in  manufacturing, \nalthough  pockets  of  high  protection  persist  in  agriculture  (rice,  corn,  coffee,  pork),  food \nprocessing (processed meats), and furniture production. \n \nRemittances.  Remittances hit record levels estimated at $14.4 billion sent through the \n6. \nbanking system in 2007 up from less than $5 billion in 2000. Remittances have kept the current \naccount in surplus at 5% of GDP, boosted household consumption, and contributed to reducing \nhousehold  debt.  Remittances  have  also  reduced  the  national  poverty  rate  by  5  percentage \npoints (Supplementary Appendix B).  \n \n7. \nInvestment.  Investment  grew  by  11.5%  in  real  terms  in  2007,  up  from  1.4%  in  2006. \nThe upturn was driven by increased public infrastructure spending, up by 29.5% in 2007. Private \nsector  investment  also  grew  strongly  with  private  construction  increasing  at  15.9%  compared \nwith negative 1.4% in 2006. Overall, the investment to GDP ratio improved from 14.0% in 2006 \nto 14.6% in 2007. The investment to GDP ratio is low compared to its precrisis average of 23%. \n \nChallenges  to  Sustaining  Economic  Growth.  In  the  short  term,  the  Philippine \n8. \neconomy is vulnerable to the sharp slowdown in the United States economy and turbulence in \nits  capital  markets;  the  recent  surge  in  international  food  prices  is  slowing  household \nconsumption. Over the medium term, however, the critical challenge facing the Philippines is to \nsustain a higher investment growth rate.  \n \nB. \n \nInvestment needs to grow by at least 10% per annum to sustain economic growth above \n9. \n6%. ADB staff estimates suggest that the Philippines is underinvesting in physical capital by as \nmuch  as  5  percentage  points  of  GDP  compared  with  its  long-run  equilibrium  rate.  The \nGovernment has increased public spending on infrastructure and this has lifted the investment \nrate; it will need to continue this and to implement measures in a number of areas to increase \nprivate investment. In an ADB survey on investment incentives, investors rated macroeconomic \nstability,  political  stability,  skilled  labor,  incentives,  openness,  bureaucracy,  legal  system,  and \nlaw  and  order  as  their  most  important  investment  decision  factors.  Therefore  cross-cutting \nmeasures  to  improve  the  investment  climate  include  maintaining  macroeconomic  stability; \nlowering  regulatory  costs;  improving  trade  facilitation;  promoting  rural  development  including \nconnectivity  with  urban  markets;  and  establishing  a  transparent  framework  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment, including improving the resource efficiency of public infrastructure spending as a \ncorollary to fiscal consolidation efforts. \n\nMedium-Term Investment Issues \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \na.

It  is  implementing  the  national  single  window,  which  will  allow \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n(iv) \n\nimporters to electronically track shipments through customs. The Department of \nAgriculture has consolidated five certification agencies into one, and will integrate \nthis with the national single window.

Over the medium term, the \nGovernment\u2019s  objective  is  to  establish  a  public\u2013private  partnership  project \npreparation facility to improve the quality of project preparation. In the interim, the \nGovernment  will  take  steps  to  establish  a  project  preparation  facility.  It  will \ndevelop  a  policy  framework  for  risk  management  and  guarantees  for  public\u2013\nprivate  partnerships  in  infrastructure  projects  approved  by  Development  and \nBudget  Coordination  Committee  and  develop  a  set  of  standard  transaction \ndocuments for public\u2013private partnerships.

While  much  has  been  done  to  put  fiscal  policy  on  a  sound  path,  critical \nissues  for  the  Government  over  the  medium  term  include  sustaining  priority  spending  through \nefforts  to  raise  revenues,  improve  efficiency  of  public  expenditure  management,  and  increase \neffectiveness of debt management. The Government has outlined a fiscal sustainability strategy \nsupported by the Development Policy Support Program (DPSP). \n \nA.  \n \n2. \nFrom an average of 2.8 % in 2007, consumer price inflation accelerated to 9.6% in May \n2008 year-on-year, well above the upper limit of the central bank\u2019s inflation target of 3%\u20135% for \n2008.  Core  inflation  (which  excludes  volatile  food  and  energy  prices)  reached  6.2%  in  \nMay  2008,  from  an  average  of  2.8%  in  2007.  The  rise in  food  prices\u201413.7%  in  May  year-on-\nyear\u2014accounted for 70% of inflation in the first 5 months of 2008 (Figure A5.1a). Available data \nsuggest  that  much  of  the  recent  surge  in  inflation  can  be  attributed  to  the  sharp  increase  in \ninternational  food  prices,  in  particular  prices  of  grains  (Figure  A5.2b).  The  appreciation  of  the \npeso to dollar exchange rate moderated the impact of imported food inflation on the domestic \neconomy  in  2007.  However,  with  increased  risks  of  the  peso  depreciating  this  year  (as  real \ninterest  rates  are  currently  negative),  the  exchange  rate  will  not  be  able  to  contain  imported \ninflation. If international food price inflation persists, further domestic inflation is expected in the \ncoming  months.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  staff  forecasts  for  inflation  suggest  the \npossibility  of  double-digit  food  price  inflation  during  the  second  quarter  of  2008.  Food  price \ninflation is estimated to raise food expenditures of the poor by P50 billion in 2008, including an \nadditional  7%  of  the  population  that  are  vulnerable  to  falling  into  poverty  as  a  consequence \n(Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n\n \nFigure A5.1: Inflation in the Philippines \n\n \n\n \n      a.

The  national  Government  has  posted  only  four  budget \n3. \nsurpluses in 37 years; three were in the 1990s. Fiscal indiscipline coupled with poor monetary \npolicy management (until 1993 when the central bank was reformed) were the main contributors \nto macro instability from the late 1970s to 2004 (Figure A4.2). In 2005, the Philippines emerged \nfrom  another  serious  fiscal  situation  (from  1998  to  2004)  when  budget  revenues  dropped \nsignificantly  leading  to  suppressed expenditure  in  the  social  sectors  and  substantial  decline  in \npublic  sector  real  wages.1 The  deficit  reached  5.2%  of  GDP  and  the  nonfinance  public  sector \ndebt exceeded 100% of GDP in the same year. The Government has restored macroeconomic \nstability  and  maintained  it  through  fiscal  discipline.  The  cornerstone  and  the  measure  with  the \nhighest revenue impact was the reform of value-added tax in November 2005, which extended \nthe value-added tax base to energy products, and increased the rate from 10% to 12% effective \nFebruary  2006.  Other  measures  supporting  fiscal  consolidation  include  increasing  (i)  excise \ntaxes on alcohol and tobacco products by 30% at the end of 2004 (although not fully indexed to \ninflation),  (ii)  the  corporate  income  tax  rate  from  32%  to  35%,  and  (iii)  electricity  tariffs.  As  a \nconsequence  of  these  reforms,  tax  revenues  grew  by  over  1.3  percentage  points  of  GDP  in \n2006,  the  national  government  deficit  fell  to  1.1%  of  GDP  from  2.7%  in  2005,  and  the \nconsolidated public sector budget (which includes the balances of the government-owned and  \n-controlled corporations) turned in a surplus for the first time in almost a decade, aided by the \nfinancial improvement of the National Power Corporation. Fiscal consolidation continued in 2007 \nwith the national government deficit falling to 0.2% of GDP and the consolidated public sector \ndeficit remaining in balance for a second consecutive year. Tax revenues in 2007 grew by 8%, \nshort  of  the  budget  target  of  14.8%.  Nevertheless,  total  revenues  grew  by  14%  aided  by \nproceeds from privatization of state-owned assets, demonstrating the Government\u2019s resolve in \nmaintaining fiscal discipline. \n \n4. \nThe reduction in the national government deficit by 2.3 percentage points in 2005 over \n2003  was  entirely  due  to  expenditure  suppression  (Table  A5.1).  In  2006,  revenues  played  a \nlarger  role  in  deficit  reduction,  accounting  for  85%  of  the  deficit  reduction  of  1.6  percentage \npoints over 2005. In 2007, revenues accounted for the entire reduction in the deficit from 1.1% \nof GDP in 2006 to 0.2% in 2007. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   For  a  detailed  discussion  on  the  fiscal  problem  and  consolidation  strategy  see  ADB.  2007.

Building  on  these  is  an  important  medium-\nterm  goal.  The  Government  is  committed  to  a  balanced  budget  by  2010.  In  the  context  of  a \nissues  are  \nmedium-term  balanced  budget \n(i) sustaining priority spending through efforts to increase revenues, (ii) improving efficiency of \npublic expenditure management, and (iii) increasing effectiveness of debt management. \n\nthree  major  medium-term \n\nframework, \n\nthe \n\n \n\nThe Government\u2019s goal is to raise national government noninterest expenditures by an \n6. \nadditional 1 percentage point of GDP over the next 3 years. This includes raising capital outlays \nby 1.2 percentage points to reach its target of 3.2% of GDP by 2010. To achieve these goals, \nthe Government targets an increase in tax revenues of 1.6 percentage points. The tax revenue \ntarget  is  achievable  but  requires  increased  efforts.  Revenue  management  is  challenged  by  \n(i) the proliferation of tax incentives in growth sectors of the economy that may have resulted in \nas  much  as  P47  billion  in  foregone  revenues;  (ii)  generous  income  tax  deductions  that  have \neroded  the  tax  base;  (iii)  poorly  structured  excise  tax  regime;  and  (iv)  weak  tax  administration \nincluding over half of regional tax offices using a manual operating system resulting in a backlog \nin processing of tens of thousands of income tax files and new tax registrations, weak systems \nfor  monitoring  tax  credits,  management  of  tax  arrears,  and  tax  audits.  The  Government  is \nsystematically addressing these issues. The Bureau of Internal Revenue has a comprehensive \ntax  administration  reform  program  up  to  2010  with  support  from  the  World  Bank,  Swedish \nInternational  Development  Agency  (SIDA),  and  ADB  (in  2008),  but  implementation  has  been \nslower  than  expected.  This  is  partly  due  to  the  complexity  of  the  reform  program  and  its \noutreach to all 79 revenue district offices (RDOs), but also because BIR is resource constrained \nemployee  \nas \n(Figure  A5.2e).  Over  the  longer  term,  the  Government  will  need  to  address  budget  resource \nallocations to BIR as it implements its tax reforms. \n\noperating \n\nreflected \n\ndecline \n\nbudget \n\ncosts \n\nper \n\nthe \n\nin \n\nin \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \nFigure A5.2: Fiscal Policy Performance \n \n\n  a.

The medium-term outlook for fiscal policy (Table A5) presents \n7. \nthe  Government\u2019s  baseline  scenario  based  on  assumptions  about  improvements  in  revenue \ncollections, economic growth ranging from 5% to 7% per annum from  2008 to 2010, relatively \nlow inflation around 5% after 2008, and continuing tax administration reforms supported by the \nDPSP. The fiscal deficit is projected to be less than 1% in 2008, 0.5% in 2009, and balanced in \n2010, consistent with the need to ensure debt sustainability. The fiscal consolidation is primarily \ndriven  by  an  improved  revenue  effort,  with  tax  revenues  projecting  to  rise  by  about  \n1.6  percentage  points  of  GDP  over  the  next  3  years.  Primary  expenditures  would  rise  by  \n1.6  percentage  points  and  capital  outlays  by  1.2  percentage  points.  The  national  government \nand  nonfinancial  public  sector  debt  would  continue  to  fall  below  50%  of  GDP  ensuring \nsustainable debt and providing a buffer in the event of future shocks to the economy. While the \nscenario is indicative, it does demonstrate the need to continue increasing revenue effort. \n \n8. \nMedium-term  sustainable  priority  spending  requires  improving  efficiency  in  public \nexpenditure  management  by  ensuring  a  balanced  public  expenditure  program  for  capital \nspending and recurrent expenditures, as well as for discretionary and nondiscretionary spending \nitems (interest payments and wages). This will require continuing to reorient spending to priority \nsectors  of  education,  health,  and  public  infrastructure.  Implementing  improved  systems  for \npublic  expenditure  management  including  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework,  which \naligns  the  budget  planning  process  with  strategic  objectives  and  priorities,  is  integral  to \nimproving  efficiency  in  public  expenditure  management.  Progress  is  being  made.  The \nDepartment of Budget and Management has incorporated the medium-term framework into the \n2008 budget including forward estimates for a 3-year rolling period produced for all 23 national \nagencies.  It  is  now  in  the  process  of  computerizing  the  computation  of  forward  estimates  and \nwill  roll  it  out  to  priority  line  ministries.  Recent  diagnostic  assessments  carried  out  by  the \nInternational Monetary Fund, World Bank, and ADB under the DPSP identify several core areas \nto be addressed with aid support beginning with budget preparation through to budget execution \nincluding  scope  to  improve  cash  management,  establish  internal  controls  and  audit,  and \nstrengthen budget reporting processes. Integral to this will be the development of an integrated \ngovernment  financial  management  system.  The  ADB-supported  Health  Sector  Development \nProgram  offers  one  example  of  how  systematic  provincial  public  expenditure  reviews  and  the \nuse of programmatic initiatives can help effect change.  \n \n9. \nDebt  Sustainability. Public debt as a share of GDP has declined to levels of the early \n1990s, but remains high by regional standards (Table A5 and Figure A5.2b). At the end of 2007, \nnational  financial  sector  public  debt,  which  includes  the  debt  of  government-owned  and  \n-controlled  corporations,  is  estimated  at  $118  billion  or  69%  of  GDP,  down  from  its  peak  of \n101% in 2003. National government debt accounts for the bulk of the national financial sector \npublic debt and is estimated at $89 billion or 59% of GDP in 2007, down from 64% in 2006. A \nprudent  borrowing  strategy,  economic  growth,  and  appreciation  of  the  peso  to  the  dollar \ncontributed to the rapid decline. Debt servicing costs as a share of national government budget \nexpenditures also declined from 29% in 2006 to 23% in 2007, thereby freeing up P36 billion for \npriority spending in 2007. However, at 4% of GDP, the Philippines\u2019 public debt servicing costs \nare  high  by  regional  standards  and  about  double  that  of  Indonesia  (Table  A4).  Overall  debt \nservice  burden  remains  manageable.  However,  external  debt  (accounting  for  40%  of  total \nnational government debt) is vulnerable to increased risks of depreciation in the peso to dollar \nexchange rate in 2008. Domestic debt servicing costs are vulnerable to rising interest rates on \nGovernment  securities  in  2008:  the  average  interest  rate  on  new  issues  of  364  day  Treasury \nbills  increased  from  5.2%  in  January  2008  to  6%  by  March  2008.  As  of  the  first  5  months  of \n2008,  interest  payments  on  national  government  debt  were  P133  billion,  well  within  the  2008 \nbudget target of P146 billion for the same period. \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n10. \nThe  Government  has  outlined  a  strategy  to  support  a  sustainable  adjustment  in  fiscal \npolicy  over  the  next  few  years  and  measures  to  improve  public  expenditure  management \nsupported by the DPSP. Activities include the following:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nContinue  to  implement  tax  policy  reforms  to  enhance  the  revenue  system  by \nbroadening  the  tax  base  and  rationalizing  income  tax  incentives.  A  revised  tax \nincentives  rationalization  bill  was  submitted  to  Congress  at  the  end  of  2007; \nCongress is expected to pass the bill in 2008. Its revenue effects will not begin to \nbe  realized  until  2009.  Other  measures  include  reforming  the  structure  and \nadministration of the excise tax on cigarettes, and raising the rates in 2009. \nStrengthen  tax  administration,  including  by  completing  the  update  of  taxpayer \nregistration; and improving registration processes, audit strategies, management \nof arrears, and tracking and monitoring of tax credits. \nIncrease spending on the social sectors and public infrastructure in the 2007 and \n2008 budgets. \nPilot  performance  contracts \ncorporations to identify monitorable targets. \nStrengthen  debt  management  systems  to  bring  them  in  line  with  international \nbest practice. \nContinue to implement a rolling 3-year, medium-term expenditure framework and \ncomputation of forward estimates. \nProgram  for  strengthening  budget  execution  including  initiating  development  of \nthe  government \ntechnical \nassistance from ADB, among others.  \n\nlarge  government-owned  and  -controlled \n\ninformation  system  with \n\nfinancial  management \n\nin \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n67 \n \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title:  Philippines/Development Policy Support Program, Subprogram 2 \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n \n\n \n\nPolicy-based program loan \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n \n\nSoutheast Asia Department/ \nGovernance, Finance, and Trade Division \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.    Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Philippines: The DPSP policy areas largely correspond with \nthose  of  the  Government  as  spelled  out  in  the  Medium-Term  Philippines  Development  Plan  (MTPDP)  2004\u20132010,  which \nfocuses on five core areas: (i) economic growth and job creation; (ii) energy dependency and power sector reforms; (iii) social \njustice  and  basic  needs;  (iv)  education  and  youth  opportunities;  and  (v)  anticorruption  measures  and  governance.  The \nMTPDP mission is to \u201cfight poverty by building prosperity for the greatest number of Filipino people.\u201d  \n \nThe Government has made substantial progress in addressing fiscal consolidation and is now shifting to ensuring sustainable \nfiscal policy by enhancing tax revenues over the longer term. This is necessary to increase social expenditures. In 2008 the \nGovernment will operate a budget deficit of no more than 1% of GDP, 0.5% of GDP in 2009, and balanced budget by 2010. \nThis  ensures  fiscal  discipline  while  at  the  same  time  provides  flexibility  on  fiscal  policy  to  protect  social  spending,  such  as \nduring the recent episode of food price inflation. The value-added tax reform is producing results, as well  as the intensified \ncollection  performance  by  the  Bureau  of  Internal  Revenue  and  Bureau  of  Customs  in  the  first  semester  of  2008.  The \nincreased revenue from reforms in 2006 was used to reduce public debt, and to finance infrastructure and social services in \n2007 and maintain this level of spending in 2008.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe sustained economic expansion is beginning to impact the Philippines' stubbornly high unemployment rate for the first time \nin a decade. Lower long-term economic growth coupled with relatively restrictive labor regulations meant higher longer-term \nunemployment in the Philippines compared with its regional neighbors. In 2007, the unemployment rate fell to an average of \n7.3% from 7.9% in 2006, although the economic slowdown in 2008 has raised the average unemployment rate. Progress on \npoverty reduction and income inequality has been less clear. The 2006 family income and expenditure survey indicates the \nheadcount poverty rate increased by 3 percentage points from 30% in 2003 to 33% in 2006. \n \n2. Design Features. With support through the DPSP, the Government is addressing these issues of poverty and vulnerability \nto  poverty  by  reforming  social  protection  programs,  introducing  the  conditional  cash  transfer  program,  and  increasing \nspending on the social sectors. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nThe  DPSP  supports  the  Government  to  address  these  issues  through  the  program\u2019s  social  sector  component.  The  DPSP \nsupports  increased  spending  on  the  social  sector  in  areas  where  the  Philippines  is  lagging  in  its  Millennium  Development \nGoals (MDGs) (e.g., education). It also supports the design and implementation of the conditional cash transfer program that \nlinks assistance with outcomes in family education and health. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nADB staff assessments suggest that much of the increase in poverty can be attributed to energy cost increases in 2006 rather \nthan structural changes to household incomes and distribution as the Gini coefficient did not changed significantly. Hence, the \nspike may be temporary and not a reversal of recent trends. However, a new spike in poverty us expected in 2008 due to the \nsurge in food prices. Mitigating these effects for households is the fact that remittances to the Philippines accelerated in the \nfirst 5 months of 2008. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nB.

Maintain the consolidated public sector \ndeficit at 2% of GDP in 2006 and on \ntrack to 1.4% of GDP in 2007 \n2.   Continue progress in reducing the \n\nnational government deficit to 1% of \nGDP in 2007 \n\n3.   Tax revenues on track to increase by \n\n0.5% of GDP in 2007 \n\n \nPerformance \n\n \nSurpassed  expectations.  consolidated  public  sector \nsurplus of 0.1% in 2006 and deficit of 0.1% in 2007 \n\nSurpassed  expectations.  National  government  deficit  of \n0.2% of GDP in 2007 \n\nPartially accomplished. Trigger dropped from Program. \nTax revenues up by 9% in 2007 resulting in a drop in the tax \nto  GDP  ratio  from  14.3%  in  2006  to  14%  in  2007.  The \nshortfall  occurred  in  the  first  semester  of  2007,  with  tax \nrevenue  collection  up  5.1%  for  the  same  period  in  2006. \nRemedial actions were undertaken in mid-2007 contributing \nto  a  recovery  in  tax  revenue  collection:  tax  revenues  grew \nbetween 13% and 15% in the second semester of 2007 and \n13.8%  in  the  first  semester  of  2008.  Overall,  for  the  12 \nmonths  ending  June  2008,  tax  revenues  grew  14%  on  a \nyear-on-year  basis.  With  nominal  GDP  growth  estimated \nbetween  10.4%  for  the  12  months  ending  June  2008  (and \n11.6%  in  the  first  semester  of  2008),  the  tax  to  GDP  ratio \nincreased  about  0.3  percentage  points.  Factors \nthat \ncontributed  to  the  shortfall  in  tax  revenues  in  the  first \nsemester  include  macroeconomic  factors  (peso  exchange \nrate  appreciation,  slower  growth  in  imports),  tax  policy \nchanges  (removal  of  the  cap  on  value-added  tax  credits), \ntax  administration  and  enforcement  weaknesses  (front \nloading  of  excise  tax  payments  at  the  end  of  2006,  and  a \nsurge  in  fuel  smuggling  out  of  the  Subic  special  economic \nzone). Weak tax administration and inefficiencies in the tax \npolicy  indicate  that  BIR  and  BOC  were  unable  to  increase \ntax  revenues  through  improvements  in  tax  efficiency  and \nenforcement.  Remedial  action  undertaken  in  mid-2007 \nincluded  removal  of  senior  BIR  personnel,  including  the \ncommissioner,  and  increased  use  of  legislative  instruments \n(tax  amnesties  and  abatements)  to  encourage  payment  of \ntax arrears and increase inspections. Technically, the trigger \nwas  not  accomplished  in  2007;  however,  progress  since \nAugust 2007 indicates the Government\u2019s commitment to tax \nrevenue enhancement and therefore partial accomplishment \nof  the  trigger.  With  hindsight,  the  formulation  of  the  trigger \nwas  inappropriate.  The  trigger  is  a  revenue  forecast  and \ntherefore  subject  to  change  based  on  changes  in  the \nunderlying  macroeconomic  assumptions  (nominal  GDP \ngrowth,  inflation,  peso  exchange  rate),  which  also  changed \nduring  2007.  The  tax  trigger  was  dropped  to  align  with  the \napproach  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  used  in  the \nIndonesian  DPSP,  which  avoids  numerical  targets  and \nforecasts  for  key  macroeconomic  policy  triggers  including \nrevenue  collection,  and \ninstead  monitors  performance \nthrough the DMF. \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nOriginal Triggers as Specified in \nSubprogram 1 Document, Table A2.2 of \nAppendix 2 \n4.

This process has started, including cleaning \nthe taxpayer database, identifying unregistered corporations \n(about  9,429  registered  at  SEC)  and  inactive  taxpayers  in \nthe  database  (162,352  taxpayers),  and  addressing  the \nbacklog  in  registrations.  BIR  has  begun  computerization  of \naround  30  RDOs  to  ensure  efficient  processing  of  income \ntax returns and tax registration. \n\ntheir \n\nrationalization  plans.  However, \n\nAccomplished.  Forward  estimates  for  2008\u20132010  were \nincorporated  into  the  budget  for  the  first  time.  This  process \nimproved \nthe  Government  with  much \nprovided \nunderstanding  of  fiscal  space  over  the  next  3  years \nespecially  for  discretionary  spending.  As  a  consequence, \ngreater amounts of the 2008 budget were channeled to the \npriority areas of infrastructure development, basic education, \nhealth services, and housing.  \nPartially  accomplished.  DOH  submitted  its  2008  budget \nproposal \nto  DBM  based  on  a  new  budget  structure \nconsistent  with  its  MFO.  The  new  presentation  of  budget \nallocations for programs and projects takes a more function-\nbased  approach  consistent  with  the  OPIF.  Three  other \ndepartments  (DepEd,  DOA,  DPWH),  designated  to  submit \nbudget  proposals  on  the  new  budget  structure  under \nsubprogram  2,  were  unable  to  do  so  as  DBM  had  not \napproved \nthe \nGovernment remains committed to restructuring department \nbudgets  in  line  with  the  MFOs  under  the  OPIF  to  improve \nthe budget\u2019s readability and performance focus. \nSubstantially  accomplished.  Scanned  documents  of  all \npayments to contractors of the central offices of the four line \ndepartments  and  four  pilot  regions  for  2007 were  uploaded \non the DBM website (www.dbm/fundreleases). The website \nincludes  a  link  to  DPWH  to  ensure  consistent  data  as  all \npayments  to  contractors  are  uploaded  on  the  DPWH \nwebsite.  The  inadequate  computerized  accounts  system \nmeant  that  DBM  had  to  scan  documents  onto  its  website \ntaking  up  considerable  personnel  time.  While  this  effort \nsubstantially  achieved  the  desired  outcome,  the  process \nwas  not  as  intended.  When  the  trigger  was  formulated,  the \nGovernment  and  development  partners  had  not \nfully \nassessed the infrastructure necessary to provide timely data \nfrom  the  relevant  agencies.  This  reiterates  the  need  to \ndevelop  the  GFMIS  beginning  under  subprogram  3  and \nproviding  longer-term  technical  assistance  to  DBM.  The \nGovernment remains committed to continuing to post budget \ndata as part of its efforts to improve budget transparency. \nPartially  accomplished.  This  policy  trigger  encountered \nsimilar  difficulties.  Hence,  DBM  published  data  on  the \nallotment  releases,  obligations,  and  disbursements  for  the \nmajor programs and projects of the four central departments \nfor  2007;  this  signifies  the  Government\u2019s  thrust  to  greater \ntransparency and accountability. \n\n\f     Appendix 7           71 \n\n \nPerformance \n\nSubstantially  accomplished.  All  certified  publicly  bid \nopportunities  of  10  of  the  12  departments  were  posted  on \nPhilGEPS.

The  core  objective  of  the  PATA  is  to  support  the \nGovernment  (Department  of  Budget  and  Management  [DBM])  to  implement  and  monitor  key \npublic  expenditure  management  (PEM)  reforms  with  a  focus  on  enhancing  budget  execution, \naccounting,  recording,  and  reporting.  The  PATA  requires  analytical  inputs  and  institutional \ncapacity building to DBM and selected line ministries with the rollout of PEM reforms. The scope \nof  the  PATA  parallels  the  DPSP,  covering  the  governance  and  PEM  component,  and  impact \nand outcomes listed in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n \n\n1. \n\nIssues \n\n \nMedium-term  sustainable  priority  spending  requires  improving  the  efficiency  of  PEM. \n2. \nKey  challenges  for  the  Government  are  to  balance  the  public  expenditure  program  between \ncapital  spending  and  recurrent  expenditures,  as  well  as  between  discretionary  and \nnondiscretionary  spending  items  (local  government  unit  [LGU]  transfers,  wages,  and  interest \npayments);  and  to  implement  improved  PEM  systems.  The  Government,  ADB,  and  other \ndevelopment partners identified several PEM issues from budget preparation through to budget \nexecution,  cash  management  and  forecasting,  accounting,  recording  and  reporting,  internal \ncontrol, and audit that will require a much longer term and coordinated effort in capacity building. \nIntegral  to  improved  budget  execution  is  developing  a  whole  of  government  approach  to \nfinancial  management  information  systems  building  on  existing,  fragmented  systems  such  as \nthe electronic national accounting system (eNGAS) and PhilGEPs. \n \nThe PATA supports a core element of the Government\u2019s PEM reform agenda. Under the \n3. \nDPSP  cluster  the  Government  is  committed  to  rolling  out  the  MTEF,  initiating  development  of \nthe GFMIS, piloting and then rolling out internal control and audit to national line agencies, and \nenhancing budget transparency and reporting. The PATA complements another ADB technical \nassistance (TA) on enhancing tax revenue collection including providing assistance to upgrade \nrevenue-forecasting capabilities at the Department of Finance. It complements activities of other \ndevelopment  partners,  including  the  World  Bank  and  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment.  The  World  Bank  has  a  small  grant  providing  support  to  DBM\u2019s  budget  strategy \npaper  and  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  is  assisting  with  computation  of \nforward  estimates  under  the  MTEF.  ADB  has  worked  closely  with  development  partners  in \npreparing the PATA, and will continue to do so during implementation to ensure efficient use of \nresources.   \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Technical Assistance \n\na. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n4. \nThe PATA will support the DPSP cluster by (i) enhancing budget execution, accounting, \nrecording, and reporting; and (ii) initiating the development of an integrated GFMIS, which is a \npolicy trigger for the DPSP subprogram 3. \n \n\n \n\n\f74 \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nImpacts of the PATA are an enhanced PEM system with improved budget transparency \n5. \nand  efficiency.  Over  the  longer  term,  these  reforms  will  improve  sustainability  of  priority \nspending.    \n \n\nb. \n\nMethodology and Key Activities \n\nThe key PATA activities are divided into three components: \n\n6. \n \nImplement  Public  Expenditure  Management  Reforms.  This  component  will  support \n7. \nDBM  with  its  budget  execution  reforms.  Activities  include  assistance  with  streamlining  budget \nexecution procedures and information systems; conducting diagnostic assessments of spending \nbehavior of line ministries; strengthening payroll and allowance internal control and monitoring \nprocedures, including for special purpose funds; and implementing the rollout of DBM\u2019s internal \ncontrol  and  audit  in  selected  pilot  ministries.  This  component  will  help  DBM  implement \nbudgetary  reforms  in  government  owned  and  controlled  corporations  (GOCCs),  including \nbudget process, internal controls, organizational structure, and assessment of subsidies and net \nlending  to  GOCCs.  The  component  will  provide  staff  capacity  training  in  improving  budget \nexecution.  \n \n8. \nDevelop  a  GFMIS.  This  component  will  build  on  the  results  of  diagnostic  work  on  a \nGFMIS  that  will  be  undertaken  by  DBM  in  2008  including  implementing  the  road  map  for \ndeveloping  an  integrated  GFMIS  within  the  national  government.  This  component  will  support \nDBM to initiate the development of the GFMIS building on existing information systems such as \nthe  electronic  national  accounting  system  (eNGAS),  e-budget,  and  PhilGEPS,  and  will  be  the \nbuilding blocks for subsequent TA. It will start with aligning the chart of accounts between DBM \nand  COA.  This  component  will  help  DBM  establish  an  interagency  working  group  to  oversee \nGFMIS reforms across government.  \n \nImplement Change Management. This component will develop and implement change \n9. \nmanagement  strategies  to  support  the  DBM  budget  reform  program  and  its  reform  unit,  and \nprepare a strategy for rollout to selected line ministries. Technical assistance will be provided to \nselected  line  ministries  to  strengthen  capacity  to  provide  timely  posting  of  budget  data  on  the \nDBM website.  \n \n \n\nCost and Financing \n\n3. \n\nThe PATA is estimated to cost $1,150,000 equivalent. ADB will provide a $800,000 grant \n10. \nfinanced by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government  will provide the remaining $350,000 \nequivalent by providing counterpart staff and facilities (Table A9). \n \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n11. \nDBM will be the executing agency, as it is responsible for national budget execution. It \nwill chair the interministerial working group on PEM; provide office space, counterpart staff, and \nother services to the consultants; and closely coordinate with line ministries and agencies and \nother  stakeholders  involved  in  PATA  implementation.  The  PATA  will  commence  in  the  first \nquarter  of  2009  and  be  completed  in  the  first  quarter  of  2010,  coinciding  with  the  third \nsubprogram.. DBM will procure equipment and software in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The equipment and software will be handed \nover to DBM upon completion of the TA.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n      Appendix 9 \n\n        \n\n75\n\nA  team  of  international  and  national  consultants  will  implement  the  PATA.  ADB  will \n12. \nengage a combination of a consulting firm and  individuals to implement all three components, \nthrough simplified technical proposals using quality- and cost-based selection for firms. ADB will \nengage  individual  consultants  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). A total of 50 (19 international and 31 national) person-\nmonths of consulting will be required.  \n \n13.  \nThe consultants will regularly provide written reports in English: (i) an inception report to \ninclude a comprehensive implementation plan will be submitted within 4 weeks after the PATA \nstarts; (ii) an interim report; (iii) progress reports; and (iv) a draft final report and, subsequently, \na final report to be submitted before the PATA ends. Specific timing and content of the reports \nwill be discussed with DBM. The reports will be submitted to DBM and ADB.  \n \n\nTable A9: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($\u2019000) \n\nTotal Cost \n \n \n \n\nInternational  \nLocal \n\nInternational Consultants \nNational Consultants \n\nRemuneration and Per Diem \ni. \nii. \nTravel \ni. \nii. \nReport Preparation and Communications \n\nAsian Development Bank Financing \n1. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n \n6. \n\nConsultants \na. \n \n \nb. \n \n \nc. \nWorkshops \nEquipment and Software a\\  \nStaff Capacity Training \nMiscellaneous Technical Assistance Administration \nAnd Support Costs \nContingency \n    Subtotal (A) \n\nItem \nA.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: ADB staff estimates \na\\ Equipment include up to 50 computers, 3 scanners, 3 printer/photocopiers, GFMIS software.  \n\nOffice Accommodation \nSecretarial and Related Services \nCounterpart Staff Remuneration and Per Diem \nMiscellaneous Administration \n\nGovernment Financing \n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n\n  Subtotal (B) \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n250.0 \n100.0 \n \n60.0 \n20.0 \n10.0 \n30.0 \n150.0 \n60.0 \n \n40.0 \n80.0 \n800.0 \n \n \n100.0 \n70.0 \n25.0 \n155.0 \n350.0 \n \n1,150.0 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 2 September 2008) \n", "Currency Unit\nP1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "peso (P) \n$0.02 \nP46.28 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nBIR \nBOC \nCCT \nCOA \nCSO \nDBM \nDOA \nDepEd \nDOF \nDOH \nDPSP \nDPWH \nDSWD \nGDP \nGFMIS \nGOCC \nGPPB \nLGU \nMDG \nMTEF \nMTPDP \nNEDA \nOMB \nOPIF \nPATA \nPDF \nPEM \nPhilGEPS \nRATE \nRATS \nRDOs \nRIPS \nTA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nBureau of Internal Revenue \nBureau of Customs \nconditional cash transfer \nCommission on Audit \ncivil society organization \nDepartment of Budget and Management \nDepartment of Agriculture \nDepartment of Education \nDepartment of Finance \nDepartment of Health \nDevelopment Policy Support Program \nDepartment of Public Works and Highways \nDepartment of Social Welfare and Development \ngross domestic product \ngovernment financial management information system  \ngovernment-owned and -controlled corporation \ngovernment procurement policy board \nlocal government unit \nMillennium Development Goal \nmedium-term expenditure framework \nmedium-term Philippine development plan \nNational Economic and Development Authority \nOffice of the Ombudsman \norganizational performance indicator framework \npolicy and advisory technical assistance \nPhilippines development forum \npublic expenditure management \nPhilippine Government Electronic Procurement System \nrun after tax evaders \nrun after tax smugglers \nrevenue district offices \nrevenue integrity protection system \ntechnical assistance \n", " \nNOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December. \nFY  before  a  calendar  year  denotes  the  year  in  which  the  fiscal  year  ends,  e.g., \nFY2008 ends on 31 December 2008. \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.  \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \n", "C.
