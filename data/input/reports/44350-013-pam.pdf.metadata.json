PROJECT DESCRIPTION \n1.  The proposed Transport Project Preparatory Facility (the Project) will improve the startup \nefficiency of priority transport projects in the road, railway, and port subsectors by (i) preparing \nthe  feasibility  study,  detailed  design,  and  procurement  documents,  and  (ii)  providing \nimplementation support during the inception stage of project implementation. The Project will \ncontribute to good portfolio performance of transport sector projects. \n2.  Sector Context. Sri Lanka occupies a strategic position in fast-growing South Asia, and \nis near the main sea lanes between Europe and Asia, which allowed Colombo to develop very \nearly  as  an  international  port  city,  and  subsequently  as  a  transshipment  point  for  cargo \noriginating or destined for the Indian sub-continent. The real GDP growth was 4.8 percent in \n2015, slightly higher than the previous year.  The strong growth in services, continued growth in \nagriculture, and positive (albeit declining) contribution from industry helped the country maintain \nits growth. However, a slowdown in public and private investment, as well as the negative \neffects of slowing world trade, prevented Sri Lanka from achieving even faster growth. To \nachieve  high,  inclusive,  and  sustained  growth,  the  country  needs  to  further  invest  on  its \ninternational and domestic transport infrastructures. \n3.  The government had good experience of using a technical assistance loan when it \nimplemented a road project preparatory facility (RPPF) between 2004 and 2015.1 The RPPF \nsignificantly improved the implementation readiness and portfolio performance of loans in the \nroad subsector. Through the proposed Transport Project Preparatory Facility, the government \nintends to continue the successful model in the road subsector with a focus on expressway \nnetwork development in both urban and rural areas, and replicate it to the railway and port \nsubsectors. \n4.  Impact and Outcome. The impact will be successfully implemented transport projects. \nThe outcome will be improved readiness of priority transport projects.   \n5.  Outputs. The outputs will be (i) feasibility studies and/or detailed designs of transport \nprojects are completed, and (ii) implementation support for transport projects is provided. The \nfacility  will  be  implemented  through  three  components:  road,  railway,  and  port.2  The \ncomponents may involve cross-cutting interventions in urban transport, regional cooperation \nand integration, multimodal transport connectivity, and other related areas. \n6.  Eligibility Criteria. All transport projects to be prepared under the TA loan should be in \nline with (i) the government\u2019s national strategy and sector development plans, and (ii) Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)\u2019s country partnership strategy for Sri Lanka. In accordance with the \ncriteria, a preliminary list of projects includes: (i) SASEC Port Access Elevated Highway, (ii) \nExpressway Development Project, (iii) Colombo Suburban Railway Project, and (iv) SASEC \nPort Development Project. Terms of reference for consulting services have been prepared for \nthe four covering engineering design, road safety, climate change mitigation and adaptation, \nregional  cooperation  and  integration,  multimodal  connection,  urban  transport,  social  and \nenvironmental safeguards and other related areas.  \n                                                \n1  ADB.  2004.

ADB funds will be allocated based on the annual budget \nestimates prepared by the IA. IA will process all other disbursement requests to ADB, including direct payment to contractors and \nconsultant fee. The imprest account will be liquidated and replenished according to the ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook. \n2.  From ADB to contractors as well as consultants. Payments above $200,000 for consultants, contracted by the IA, will be \npaid directly by ADB, which requires the IA's submission of approved invoices and documentation to ADB in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook.  \n   \n14 \n ", " \n \nV.  FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT \nA.  Financial Management Assessment \n15.  An updated financial management assessment (FMA) for RDA, SLR and SLPA was \nconducted in July 2016 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Management and \nAnalysis  of  Projects  and  the  Financial  Due  Diligence:  A  Methodology  Note.  The  FMA \nconsidered  the  capacity  of  the  implementing  agencies,  including  funds-flow  arrangements, \nstaffing, accounting and financial reporting systems, financial information systems, and internal \nand external auditing arrangements. Based on the assessment, the key financial management \nrisks identified are (i) accounting deficiencies (SLR), and (ii) financial sustainability (RDA, SLR \nand SLPA). The overall premitigation financial management risk of RDA, SLR and SLPA is \nmoderate.  Details  of  the  FMA  of  each  agency  are  mentioned  below.  Further  financial \nmanagement assessment will be conducted under the ensuing investment projects. Financial \nmanagement action plans will be developed with each executing agency during preparations of \ninvestment projects. \n1.  Road Development Authority \n16.  RDA has comprehensive experience in  implementing ADB-funded projects and has \nsatisfactory capacity in terms of project financial accounting and knowledge of ADB procedures. \nRDA has a dedicated project accounting and finance team with suitable qualified accountants: a \nproject accountant, an accounts assistant, four accounts clerks and a computer operator. RDA \nwill maintain separate project records and accounts to identify the financing resources received \nand expenditures made for the project, ensuring an adequate audit trail. RDA operates with the \nComputer Integrated Government Accounting System (CIGAS) for monthly cash reports under \nstatutory reporting. PIU,  PMUs under RDA use a combination of manual and off-the-shelf \npackages  for  accounting  and  recording  purposes  depending  on  the  size  of  the  projects \nimplemented. The government\u2019s Office of Auditor General annually audits the project financial \nstatements and related accounts in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. Audited \nproject financial statements for previous ADB-funded projects implemented by RDA were of \nadequate quality and there are no significant unresolved audit observations. \n17.  RDA\u2019s own audited statutory financial statements for the FY 2014 indicate that the entity \nis  functioning  primarily  with  treasury  grants,  but  has  adequate  financial  management  and \ninternal  controls.  The  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  Sri  Lanka \nAccounting Standards. RDA is primarily governed by financial regulations of the government. \nRDA has an internal audit department and ADB-funded projects are subject to internal audit. \nThe internal audit department should include this facility in their annual audit program.  \n18.  Timely availability of counterpart funds has been identified as an issue in previous \nprojects. To minimize the risk of implementation delays, ADB\u2019s direct payment procedure will be \nused for disbursement above $200,000 for consulting services. Furthermore the continuation of \nstaff throughout the implementation period is also essential. Frequent transfer of staff should be \nminimized. Continuous training should be given to the new staff and existing staff to minimize \nthis type of loss. \n19.  Financial management risks should be considered and updated throughout the life of the \nproject. Risk mitigation measures should also be updated accordingly. \n15 \n ", " \n \n2.  Sri Lanka Railways \n20.  SLR  was  established  as  a  government  department  by  Parliament  under  Railway \nOrdinance,  No.  9  of  1902  and  amendments  thereafter.  Though  SLR  has  rather  limited \nexperience in handling externally-financial projects, SLR has managed several Indian Line of \nCredit financed projects. Since this will be the first time that SLR will be involved in ADB\u2019s \noperation, training on financial management and ADB\u2019s disbursement processes, particularly on \nimprest fund and SOE procedures, will be provided. SLR has accounting division headed by the \nChief Finance Officer. Chief Finance Officer is supported by four chief accountants and three \ndeputy  chief  accountants  in  the  head  office  with  supporting  staff.  All  staff  are  permanent \ngovernment officers. SLR keeps all its financial transactions according to financial regulations of \nthe Government. It follows accrual basis accounting in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting \nStandards and is also consistent with International Accounting Standards. There is a separate \ninternal audit division which directly reports to the General Manager and closely works with the \naudit committee. The Government\u2019s Office of Auditor General is the external auditor of SLR. \nThe annual audit is carried out annually in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. \n21.  The 2011, 2012 and 2013 audit reports pointed out accounting deficiencies leading to \nerrors in carry forward balances in the financial statements. These include (i) delay in follow up \nof advance settlement after completion of the activities, (ii) entering into contracts with third \nparties without using agreements approved by the Attorney General, and (iii) non-reconciliation \nwith the control accounts. Vacancies in the positions of the accounting division and internal \naudit divisions may cause the delay in submission of the financial statements and audit reports.  \n22.  Timely availability of counterpart funds has been identified as an issue in previous \nprojects  in  Sri  Lanka.  Though  SLR  is  a  revenue-earning  department,  the  revenue  is  not \nsufficient to meet the necessary expenditure of SLR. To minimize the risk of implementation \ndelays, ADB\u2019s direct payment procedure will be used for disbursement above $200,000 for \nconsulting services. Furthermore the continuation of staff throughout the implementation period \nis also essential. Frequent transfer of staff should be minimized. Continuous training should be \ngiven to the new existing staff to minimize this type of loss. \n23.  Financial management risks should be considered and updated throughout the life of the \nproject. Risk mitigation measures should also be updated accordingly. \n3.  Sri Lanka Ports Authority \n24.  SLPA is established as a government entity by Parliament under Ports Authority Act No. \n51 of 1979 and amendments thereafter. SLPA has satisfactory capacity in project financial \naccounting  and  ADB  disbursement  processes.  SLPA  accounts  division  is  headed  by  the \nDirector (Finance). The Director is supported by deputy directors and assistant directors in the \nhead office supported by the support staff. All the staff are permanent SLPA officers. SLPA \nkeeps all its financial transactions according to financial regulations of the Government. It \nfollows accrual basis accounting in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards and is also \nconsistent with International Accounting Standards. The internal audit division of the SLPA is \nalso  under  the  Chief  Internal  Auditor.  The  Government\u2019s  Office  of  Auditor  General  is  the \nexternal auditor of SLPA. The annual audit is carried out annually in accordance with Sri Lanka \nAuditing Standards. \n25.  Accounting deficiencies were brought up by the auditors in their audits for the year 2012. \nIt includes non-confirmation of balances and timely availability of counterpart funds in previous \n16 \n ", " \n \nprojects in Sri Lanka. Though SLPA is a revenue earning department, the revenue is not \nsufficient to meet the necessary expenditure of SLPA. To minimize the risk of implementation \ndelays, ADB\u2019s direct payment procedure will be used for disbursement above $200,000 for \nconsulting services.  \n26.  Financial management risks should be considered and updated throughout the life of the \nproject. Risk mitigation measures should also be updated accordingly. \nB.  Disbursement \n27.  The Loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2015, as amended from time to time), and detailed arrangements agreed upon \nbetween the Government and ADB. 3 Online training for project staff on disbursement policies \nand procedures is available at: http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning. Project staff is \nencouraged to avail of this training to help ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. \nADB\u2019s disbursement procedures (direct payment, commitment, reimbursement, and/or imprest \nfund) will be used for withdrawal of project funds. A separate imprest account in US dollar at the \nCentral  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  and  a  sub-account  in  local  currency  will  be  established  and \nmaintained by each implementing agency. A local currency account for the related sub-account \nwill  also  be  established  and  administered  by  each  implementing  agency  to  facilitate \ndisbursement of local currency costs. \n28.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with the Loan Disbursement Handbook. The total outstanding advance to each \nimprest account should not exceed the estimate of ADB\u2019s share of expenditures to be paid \nthrough the imprest account for the forthcoming 6 months. The request for initial advance to the \nimprest account should be accompanied by an Estimate of Expenditure Sheet4 setting out the \nestimated expenditures for the first six months of project implementation, and submission of \nevidence satisfactory to ADB that the advance account has been duly opened. The imprest \naccounts are to be used exclusively for ADB\u2019s share of eligible expenditures. The IA who \nadministers the imprest account is accountable and responsible for proper use of advances to \nthe imprest account. \n29.  ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure will be utilized for reimbursement and \nliquidation and replenishment of advance to the imprest account. However, SLR can use SOE \nprocedure for payments less than $100,000. SOE records should be maintained and made \nreadily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review mission or upon ADB's request \nfor submission of supporting documents on a sampling basis, and for independent audit.5 \n30.  Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, the borrower should submit to \nADB  sufficient  evidence  of  the  authority  of  the  person(s)  who  will  sign  the  withdrawal \napplications on behalf of the borrower, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of \neach authorized person.  The minimum value per withdrawal application is in accordance with \nthe Loan Disbursement Handbook.  Individual payments below such amount should be paid (i) \nby the executing agencies/implementing agencies and subsequently claimed to ADB through \nreimbursement, or (ii) through the imprest fund procedure, unless otherwise accepted by ADB. \n                                                \n3  Available at: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Handbooks/Loan_Disbursement/loan-disbursement-final.pdf \n4  Available in Appendix 10B of the Loan Disbursement Handbook. \n5  SOE form is available in Appendix 9B of the Loan Disbursement Handbook. \n \n17 \n ", " \n \n31.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  preparing  disbursement \nprojections, (ii) collecting supporting documents, and (iii) preparing and sending withdrawal \napplications to ADB. \nC.  Accounting  \n32.  The implementing agencies will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books \nand records by funding source for all expenditures incurred on the project, following accrual-\nbased  accounting  that  is  according  to  the  international  standard  and  national  accounting \nstandards.  The  IAs  will  prepare  project  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s  accounting  laws  and  regulations  which  are  consistent  with  international \naccounting principles and practices. \nD.  Auditing and Public Disclosure \n33.  RDA,  SLR,  and  SLPA  will  cause  the  detailed  project  accounts  to  be  audited  in \naccordance with International Standards on Auditing by an independent auditor acceptable to \nADB.  The  audited  project  financial  statements  together  with  the  auditor\u2019s  opinion  will  be \npresented in the English language to ADB within 6 months from the end of the fiscal year by the \nimplementing agencies.  \n34.  The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and \naudit opinions which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate and \nfair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable \nfinancial reporting standards; (ii) whether the proceeds of the loan were used only for the \npurposes of the project or not; (iii) whether the borrower, executing agencies or implementing \nagencies in comply with the financial covenants contained in the legal agreements (where \napplicable). \n35.  Compliance  with  financial  reporting  and  auditing  requirements  will  be  monitored  by \nreview missions and during normal program supervision and followed up regularly with all \nconcerned, including the external auditor. \n36.  The Government,  executing  agencies  and  implementing  agencies  have  been  made \naware of ADB\u2019s approach to delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and \nacceptable quality of the audited project financial statements. 6 ADB reserves the right to require \na change in the auditor (in a manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for \nadditional support to be provided to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a \n                                                \n6 ADB\u2019s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  \n(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the \nexecuting agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received \nwithin  the  next  6  months,  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new \nreplenishment  of  imprest  accounts,  processing  of  new  reimbursement,  and  issuance  of  new \ncommitment letters will not be processed. \n(ii)  When audited project financial statements are not received within 6 months after the due date, ADB will \nwithhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment \nof imprest accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB \nwill (a) inform the executing agency of ADB\u2019s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if \nthe audit documents are not received within the next 6 months. \n(iii)  When audited project financial statements are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB \nmay suspend the loan. \n \n18 \n ", " \n \nmanner satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to \nverify the project\u2019s financial accounts to confirm that ADB\u2019s financing shar is used in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s policies and procedures. \n37.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka has applied a loan for the Transport \nPreparatory  Facility  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  this  loan  will  be  made \navailable for preparatory works of transport sector projects under Ministry of Higher Education \nand Highways (MOHEH), Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation (MOTCA) and Ministry of Port \nand Shipping (MOPS). \n \n2.  The executing agency (EA) for the project is MOHEH and the implementing agency (IA) \nis RDA. A Steering Committee (SC) chaired by MOHEH will be established, comprising RDA, \nMinistry of National Policies and Economic Affairs (represented by External Resources, National \nPlanning,  and  Project  Management  and  Monitoring  departments),  Ministry  of  Finance \n(represented by National Budget department), and Urban Development Authority, to coordinate \namong stakeholders and oversee project implementation from time to time. RDA will also \nestablish a project management unit (PMU) to implement the project. The PMU will coordinate \nand communicate the review comments to the consultant and will provide necessary guidance \nfrom time to time. \n \n3.  Under  this  loan,  the  Road  Development  Authority  (RDA),  MOHEH,  will  engage  an \ninternational consultancy firm  to: (a) carry out pre-feasibility study for selecting the possible new \nexpressways for the proposed expressway network (b) select the future expressways to be \nincluded  in  the  proposed  expressway  network,  for  feasibility  study,  detailed  engineering \ndesigns, land acquisition and resettlement, environment and procurement of civil works, (c) \ncarry out feasibility study for one of the proposed expressways having first priority in order to \nselect the final trace, (d) undertake detailed engineering designs for the selected expressway \nfinal trace, (e) assist in improving the design standards and construction technology, (f) deliver \ntraining  programs  about  the  planning  methodology,  design  standards  and  construction \ntechnology, and (g) improve road safety in the expanded expressway network.  \n \nB.  Background \n \n4.  The government of Sri Lanka has planned to have an Effective Expressway Network for \nseveral decades in order to achieve the expected economic development, to cope with the \nincreasing traffic demand, upgrade life condition of people and alleviating the poverty in distant \nareas of the country. As a result of this effort, Sri Lanka constructed several expressways, and \nmore under construction are under planning stage.  \n \n5.  Expressways in Operation \n \n(i)  Southern Expressway (E 01) from Kottawa to Godagama \u2013 126.1km \n(ii)  Outer Circular Highway (E 02) \u2013 From Kottawa to Kadawatha (Section 1&2) \u2013 \n19.9km \n(iii)  Colombo Katunayaka Expressway (E 03) \u2013 from Paliyagoda to Katunayaka \u2013 \n25.8km \n \n6.

Expressways in planning stage \n \n(i)  Central Expressway from Kadawatha to Meerigama (Section 1) \u2013 37km \n(ii)  Central Expressway from Meerigama to Kurunagala (Section 2) \u2013 39.8km \n(iii)  Central Expressway from\u2013 Pothuhera to Galagedara (Section 3 \u2013 Kandy Link) \u2013 \n32.5km  \n(iv)  Central Expressway from Kurunagala to Dambulla (Section 4)  - 61km  \n(v)  Ruwanpura Expressway from Kahathuduwa (On Southern Expressway) to \nPelmadulla via Rathnapura \u2013 73.5km \n \n8.  Expansion  of  Expressway  Network.  The  government  plans  to  further  extend \nexpressways to effectively connect major cities such as Jaffna, Trincomallee, Anudarapura, \nPuttalam,  Pollonnaruwa,  Mannar,  Badulla  and  Batticaloa  with  the  existing  network. \nTentative expressway routes are identified subject to further analysis in terms of  economic \ndevelopment of the country in the fields of industry, agriculture, tourism, fishing etc.; township \ndevelopment; social development of the country;  poverty alleviation; mitigation of environmental \nimpacts; resettlement and social consideration, fair distribution of income; ethnic cooperation \nand so on. \n \nC.  Scope of the Consulting Services \n \n1.  Conceptual Study \n9.  The Consultant should analyze alternatives of the expressway network expansion to \neffectively connect major cities, and identify optimal expressway alignments in consultation with \nthe MOHEH, RDA, and ADB, supported by the following reviews and preliminary surveys.  The \naim of this study is to identify an effective expressway network for Sri Lanka and select one \nexpressway with most priority for feasibility study and detailed design. \n \n(i)  Carry out desk study by reviewing existing road and transport studies including \nexpressway feasibility studies, and studies on other development projects recently \ncompleted  or  undergoing  in  Sri  Lanka,  to  gain  an  understanding  of  existing \ndevelopment  initiatives,  transport  needs,  etc.  and  to  determine  long  term \nrequirements of expressways. \n(ii)  Develop  a  traffic  model  using  a  software  acceptable  to  RDA  for  expressway \nnetwork and national road network in Sri Lanka. \n(iii)  Review existing surveys and data, (e.g. Traffic data) relating to all expressways, \nwhether completed, ongoing or planned. \n33 ", "Appendix 2 \n(iv)  The conceptual study will review those expressway alignments, taking into account \ntheir role in terms of the development objectives of the country.

Background, Objective, Scope, and Detailed Tasks of the Assignment \n \n1.  Background. Colombo \u2013 Katunayake Expressway (CKE) was completed and has been \noperational since 2013. Hence, there is considerable increase in the volume of traffic entering \nColombo city along the CKE. With the construction of the Colombo Port Development Project \nand Port City Project, traffic flow in the Colombo metropolitan area will further increase. The \nfuture Central Expressway will also contribute to congestion as it will be connected to the Outer \nCircular  Expressway  (OCH)  at  Kadawatha  and  part  of  this  traffic  will  enter  the  Colombo \nmetropolitan  area  via  New  Kelani  Bridge  (NKB),  increasing  the  volume  of  traffic  entering \nColombo city along the CKE. As CKE ends at NKB, which is at the periphery of the expressway \ntraffic has to merge with the local traffic to reach destinations within the city. Extension of the \nExpressway  Network  to  the  economic,  administrative  and  transport  hubs  in  Colombo  has \nbecome important to improve the overall transport efficiency within.  \n \n2.  Widening of existing roads has become economically unviable due to potentially large \nscale  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  requirements.  To  explore  and  assess  alternative \noptions,  the  government  has  undertaken  a  feasibility  study  and  preliminary  design  for  an \nelevated  highway  along  the  existing  road  corridors  within  Colombo.  However,  it  has  also \nrevealed that the construction of an elevated highway within an existing road corridor could \ncause an obstruction to traffic during the construction stage. Considering the above, Ministry of \nHigher Education and Highways has decided to construct an elevated highway from the New \nKelani Bridge to Fort via the proposed Port Access Elevated Highway. The proposed SASEC \nPort Access Elevated Highway traverses from Ingurukade junction and ends at Galle Face. The \ntotal length of the elevated road is 5.4 kilometers with four lanes. Entry/exit ramps at both ends \nof the road as well as at an appropriate location in Colombo port area will be constructed. The \nproject also includes widening of the existing four lane ground-level Port Access Road to six \nlanes, and other related facilities such as toll gates, weighing stations, and custom and port \ninspection facilities.  \n \n3.  A feasibility study comprising preliminary design and preliminary environmental impact \nassessment (EIA) has been completed by Katahira & Engineers International associated with \nBangladesh Consultants Ltd. and Engineering Consultants, with the financial assistance of the \nAsian Development Bank.    \n \n4.  Objective. The main objective is to prepare the SASEC Port Access Elevated Highway \nproject ready for investment and implementation. \n \n5.  Scope. The consultancy services include, but are not limited to: (i) assessing traffic \ncomposition and axle loads on the elevated road; (ii) review and updating of traffic demand \nforecast with due consideration of Colombo Port Development Plan and Port City project; (iii) \nreview and updating of the feasibility study and the preliminary design; (iv) preparing detailed \nengineering design of the elevated road including entry/exit ramps and related facilities; (v) \nconducting of economic analysis including toll rate survey; (vi) conducting of road safety audit; \n(vii) conducting of environmental and social impact analyses and prepare appropriate safeguard \nplanning documents; (viii) preparation of appropriate construction management and operation \nplan with due consideration of construction alternatives, to minimize the traffic congestion of port \n48 ", "Appendix 3 \nvehicles; and (ix) preparation of detailed engineering design for the expansion of the existing \nPort Access Road. The consultants will also  support procurement of civil  works upon the \ngovernment\u2019s request and provide supports to ADB missions during loan processing. \n \n6.  Implementation  Arrangements.  The  Ministry  of  Higher  Education  and  Highways \n(MOHEH) is the executing agency, and Road Development Authority (RDA) is the implementing \nagency.  A  Steering  Committee  chaired  by  MOHEH  will  be  established,  comprising  RDA, \nMinistry of National Policies and Economic Affairs (represented by External Resources, National \nPlanning,  and  Project  Management  and  Monitoring  departments),  Ministry  of  Finance \n(represented by National Budget department), Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and Sri Lanka \nCustoms, to coordinate among stakeholders and oversee project implementation from time to \ntime. RDA will also establish a project management unit (PMU) to implement the project. The \nPMU will coordinate and communicate the review comments to the consultant and will provide \nnecessary guidance from time to time. An authorized port engineer from SLPA will be assigned \nas a member of PMU. \n \n7.  Detailed Tasks. For each project road, the consultant will carry out the following tasks. \n \nTask 1.

Objective, Scope, and Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  The Government of Sri Lanka intends to improve the railway system in the Western \nProvince, the Colombo Metropolitan Region (CMR) with a population of 5.8 million (29% of Sri \nLanka\u2019s population), which generates 43% of the country\u2019s GDP. The population growth in CMR \nis expected to be 1.5% annually until 2035 and CMR is facing growing traffic congestion. The \nrailway system carries about 13% of the passenger transport within CMR. The government aims \nto substantially increase the share of railway in the overall passenger and freight traffic. \n \n2.  Background. The development of the railway network in Sri Lanka started in 1864. \nCurrently ten railway network, which consists of around 1,500 route-km, is operated by the \nDepartment of Sri Lanka Railways (SLR). Almost 90% of the railway network of the country is \nsingle track, with 126 km of double tracks, 14 km of three tracks and 3 km of four tracks with all \nmultiple lines located within the CMR. The network covers much of the CMR along four major \ncorridors, namely Main Line, Coastal Line, Kelani Valley Line and Puttlam Line totaling to 230 \nkm. Railway provides an important service during the peak period as it acts as a commuter \nservice from the outer suburbs to central Colombo.  \n \n3.  There are long distance trains and commuter trains operated in the CMR. Out of the four \nrailway lines radiating from Colombo and serving the CMR, the Main Line and the Coastal Line \nare well patronized especially during peak periods. The Puttlam Line and the Kelani Valley Line \nare single track and not as attractive due to low train speeds and frequencies. The Colombo \nFort to Maradana section has the highest passenger volume of 136,438 passengers per day, \nfollowed by the Maradana to Ragama section with 120,876 passengers per day. The train \nfrequency between Maradana and Fort is 228 trains per day, transporting on an average around \n950 passengers per train followed by the Maradana to Ragama section, with 150 trains per day \ncarrying on an average around 750 passengers per train. The Coastal Line is also fully utilized \nwith an average passenger volume of 800\u20131,100 per train. \n \n4.  The average speed on the Main Line in CMR during peak traffic periods is around 33 \nkilometers per hour (kph) while the speed during peak traffic periods on the coastal line is \naround 28 kph. The average speed in Kelani Velley line is around 26 kph. Long delays occur \ndue to failures in the signaling system (especially during rainy days), and the frequent failures \nalso  occur  in  the  outdated  communication  system.  The  poor  condition  of  the  tracks  also \ncontribute to long delays. High loading level is another issue on the Main Line and the Coast \nLine especially during the peak period. \n \n5.  The project will improve the capacity and operating speed of the railway network in the \nCMR by modernizing and upgrading track, signaling and telecommunication infrastructure; and \npotentially electrifying the suburban railway lines, focusing initially on the 64 km Veyangoda\u2013\nColombo Fort\u2013Panadura section. The project will also support procurement of fast and modern \ncommuter trains and modernization of rolling stock maintenance facilities, and upgrade railway \nstations to provide improved intermodal connectivity with other modes of public transport and \nthrough park-and-ride facilities at selected stations. The project will increase the capacity and \nattractiveness  of  the  railway  system,  thus  increasing  its  market  share  and  reducing  road \n61 ", "Appendix 4 \ncongestion by shifting passengers to rail transport. The project will be designed on a modular \nbasis to allow future expansion, e.g., until the Puttlam Line and Colombo Airport or until Galle, \nKanday and the Kelani Valley Line and Battaramulla, connect to Colombo Port.  \n \n6.  Objective. The main objective is to prepare the railway project(s) ready for investment \nand implementation by completing feasibility studies, detailed engineering, safeguards planning \ndocuments, and bidding documents. All designs prepared under this project shall enable future \nelectric operation of the railway network with overhead catenary system (OCS), although the \nOCS may not be installed in the individual projects at an initial stage. Preparation of engineering \nin the Veyangoda \u2013 Panadura section will be the last component of the designs. The prepared \nprojects and/or components shall be designed in a modular way with a clear prioritization of \ncomponents  to  schedule  implementation  in  accordance  with  financial  resources.  All \nimprovements on existing lines shall be designed in such a way that the disruption of ongoing \noperation will be minimized to a level acceptable to SLR. \n \n7.  Scope.  The  main  CMR  railway  corridors  to  be  considered  under  the  consultancy \nassignment are the corridors linking Colombo to Kandy and Galle (Main Line and Coastal Line), \nthe Puttlam Line towards Negambo and the Airport and the Kelani Valley line. New railway lines \nand  increasing  number  of  platforms  at  stations  may  also  be  identified.  The  required \ninterventions may include climate-resilient track rehabilitation, station upgrading, modernization \nof signaling and telecom system, railway electrification, rolling stocks, and maintenance facility \nto be identified under the ADB-funded TA for Colombo Suburban Railway Project.20 For the \npriority  projects,  the  consultant  will  prepare  feasibility  study,  detailed  engineering  design, \nsafeguard  planning  documents,  and  bidding  documents.  The  consultants  will  also  provide \nsupport to the procurement of civil works and equipment upon the government\u2019s request and \nprovide support to ADB missions for loan processing. \n \n8.  Implementation  Arrangements.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Civil  Aviation \n(MOT&CA)  is  the  executing  agency  for  the  railway  component  of  the  Transport  Project \nPreparatory  Facility.  MOT&CA  will  implement  the  railway  component  through  its  Project \nManagement  Unit  and  through  Department  of  Sri  Lanka  Railway  (SLR).  An  inter-ministry \nsteering  committee  chaired  by  the  Secretary  of  MOT&CA  will  oversee  and  guide  the \nimplementation.  MOT&CA  has  established  a  project  management  unit  to  engage  the \nconsultants, manage contracts, review consultant\u2019s reports and provide technical guidance as \nrequired.  \n \nB.  Detailed Tasks of the Assignment \n \n9.  For  each  priority  project,  the  consultant\u2019s  tasks  include,  but  are  not  limited  to  the \nfollowing. \n \nTask 1.
