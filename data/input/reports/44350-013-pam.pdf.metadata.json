The  Project  will \ncontribute to good portfolio performance of transport sector projects. \n\nSector Context. Sri Lanka occupies a strategic position in fast-growing South Asia, and \n2. \nis near the main sea lanes between Europe and Asia, which allowed Colombo to develop very \nearly  as  an  international  port  city,  and  subsequently  as  a  transshipment  point  for  cargo \noriginating  or  destined  for  the  Indian  sub-continent.  The  real  GDP  growth  was  4.8  percent  in \n2015, slightly higher than the previous year.  The strong growth in services, continued growth in \nagriculture, and positive (albeit declining) contribution from industry helped the country maintain \nits  growth.  However,  a  slowdown  in  public  and  private  investment,  as  well  as  the  negative \neffects  of  slowing  world  trade,  prevented  Sri  Lanka  from  achieving  even  faster  growth.  To \nachieve  high,  inclusive,  and  sustained  growth,  the  country  needs  to  further  invest  on  its \ninternational and domestic transport infrastructures. \n\n3. \nThe  government  had  good  experience  of  using  a  technical  assistance  loan  when  it \nimplemented  a  road  project  preparatory  facility  (RPPF)  between  2004  and  2015.1  The  RPPF \nsignificantly  improved  the  implementation  readiness  and  portfolio  performance  of  loans  in  the \nroad  subsector.  Through  the  proposed  Transport  Project  Preparatory  Facility,  the  government \nintends  to  continue  the  successful  model  in  the  road  subsector  with  a  focus  on  expressway \nnetwork  development  in  both  urban  and  rural  areas,  and  replicate  it  to  the  railway  and  port \nsubsectors. \n\nImpact and Outcome. The impact will be successfully implemented transport projects. \n\n4. \nThe outcome will be improved readiness of priority transport projects.   \n\n5. \nOutputs.  The  outputs  will  be  (i)  feasibility  studies  and/or  detailed  designs  of  transport \nprojects  are  completed, and (ii)  implementation support for  transport  projects  is  provided.  The \nfacility  will  be  implemented  through  three  components:  road,  railway,  and  port.2  The \ncomponents  may  involve  cross-cutting  interventions  in  urban  transport,  regional  cooperation \nand integration, multimodal transport connectivity, and other related areas. \n\nEligibility Criteria. All transport projects to be prepared under the TA loan should be in \n6. \nline  with  (i)  the  government\u2019s  national  strategy  and  sector  development  plans,  and  (ii)  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)\u2019s  country  partnership strategy for  Sri  Lanka.  In accordance  with the \ncriteria,  a  preliminary  list  of  projects  includes:  (i)  SASEC  Port  Access  Elevated  Highway,  (ii) \nExpressway  Development  Project,  (iii)  Colombo  Suburban  Railway  Project,  and  (iv)  SASEC \nPort  Development  Project. Terms  of  reference for  consulting  services have  been  prepared for \nthe  four  covering  engineering  design,  road  safety,  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation, \nregional  cooperation  and  integration,  multimodal  connection,  urban  transport,  social  and \nenvironmental safeguards and other related areas.  \n\n                                                \n1   ADB.  2004.

ADB  funds  will  be  allocated  based  on  the  annual  budget \nestimates prepared by the IA. IA will process all other disbursement requests to ADB, including direct payment to contractors and \nconsultant fee. The imprest account will be liquidated and replenished according to the ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook. \n2.  From ADB to contractors as well as consultants. Payments above $200,000 for consultants, contracted by the IA, will be \npaid directly by ADB, which requires the IA's submission of approved invoices and documentation to ADB in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook.  \n \n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\nV. \n\nFINANCIAL MANAGEMENT \n\nA. \n\nFinancial Management Assessment \n\nAn  updated  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  for  RDA,  SLR  and  SLPA  was \n15. \nconducted in July 2016 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Management and \nAnalysis  of  Projects  and  the  Financial  Due  Diligence:  A  Methodology  Note.  The  FMA \nconsidered  the  capacity  of  the  implementing  agencies,  including  funds-flow  arrangements, \nstaffing, accounting and financial reporting systems, financial information systems, and internal \nand external auditing arrangements. Based on the assessment, the key financial management \nrisks identified are (i) accounting deficiencies (SLR), and (ii) financial sustainability (RDA, SLR \nand  SLPA).  The  overall  premitigation  financial  management  risk  of  RDA,  SLR  and  SLPA  is \nmoderate.  Details  of  the  FMA  of  each  agency  are  mentioned  below.  Further  financial \nmanagement  assessment  will  be  conducted  under  the  ensuing  investment  projects.  Financial \nmanagement action plans will be developed with each executing agency during preparations of \ninvestment projects. \n\n1. \n\nRoad Development Authority \n\n16. \nRDA  has  comprehensive  experience  in  implementing  ADB-funded  projects  and  has \nsatisfactory capacity in terms of project financial accounting and knowledge of ADB procedures. \nRDA has a dedicated project accounting and finance team with suitable qualified accountants: a \nproject accountant, an accounts assistant, four accounts clerks and a computer operator. RDA \nwill maintain separate project records and accounts to identify the financing resources received \nand expenditures made for the project, ensuring an adequate audit trail. RDA operates with the \nComputer Integrated Government Accounting System (CIGAS) for monthly cash reports under \nstatutory  reporting.  PIU,  PMUs  under  RDA  use  a  combination  of  manual  and  off-the-shelf \npackages  for  accounting  and  recording  purposes  depending  on  the  size  of  the  projects \nimplemented. The government\u2019s Office of  Auditor  General  annually  audits  the  project financial \nstatements  and  related  accounts  in  accordance  with  Sri  Lanka  Auditing  Standards.  Audited \nproject  financial  statements  for  previous  ADB-funded  projects  implemented  by  RDA  were  of \nadequate quality and there are no significant unresolved audit observations. \n\n17. \nRDA\u2019s own audited statutory financial statements for the FY 2014 indicate that the entity \nis  functioning  primarily  with  treasury  grants,  but  has  adequate  financial  management  and \ninternal  controls.  The  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  Sri  Lanka \nAccounting  Standards.  RDA  is  primarily  governed  by  financial  regulations  of  the  government. \nRDA  has  an  internal  audit  department  and  ADB-funded  projects  are  subject  to  internal  audit. \nThe internal audit department should include this facility in their annual audit program.  \n\nTimely  availability  of  counterpart  funds  has  been  identified  as  an  issue  in  previous \n18. \nprojects. To minimize the risk of implementation delays, ADB\u2019s direct payment procedure will be \nused for disbursement above $200,000 for consulting services. Furthermore the continuation of \nstaff throughout the implementation period is also essential. Frequent transfer of staff should be \nminimized.  Continuous  training  should  be given  to the  new  staff  and existing  staff to  minimize \nthis type of loss. \n\nFinancial management risks should be considered and updated throughout the life of the \n\n19. \nproject. Risk mitigation measures should also be updated accordingly. \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n2. \n\nSri Lanka Railways \n\n20. \nSLR  was  established  as  a  government  department  by  Parliament  under  Railway \nOrdinance,  No.  9  of  1902  and  amendments  thereafter.  Though  SLR  has  rather  limited \nexperience  in  handling  externally-financial  projects,  SLR  has  managed  several  Indian  Line  of \nCredit  financed  projects.  Since  this  will  be  the  first  time  that  SLR  will  be  involved  in  ADB\u2019s \noperation, training on financial management and ADB\u2019s disbursement processes, particularly on \nimprest fund and SOE procedures, will be provided. SLR has accounting division headed by the \nChief  Finance  Officer.  Chief  Finance  Officer  is  supported  by  four  chief  accountants  and  three \ndeputy  chief  accountants  in  the  head  office  with  supporting  staff.  All  staff  are  permanent \ngovernment officers. SLR keeps all its financial transactions according to financial regulations of \nthe  Government.  It  follows  accrual  basis  accounting  in  accordance  with  Sri  Lanka  Accounting \nStandards and is also consistent with International Accounting Standards. There is a separate \ninternal audit division which directly reports to the General Manager and closely works with the \naudit  committee.  The  Government\u2019s  Office  of  Auditor  General  is  the  external  auditor  of  SLR. \nThe annual audit is carried out annually in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. \n\n21. \nThe  2011,  2012  and  2013  audit  reports  pointed  out  accounting  deficiencies  leading  to \nerrors in carry forward balances in the financial statements. These include (i) delay in follow up \nof  advance  settlement  after  completion  of  the  activities,  (ii)  entering  into  contracts  with  third \nparties without using agreements approved by the Attorney General, and (iii) non-reconciliation \nwith  the  control  accounts.  Vacancies  in  the  positions  of  the  accounting  division  and  internal \naudit divisions may cause the delay in submission of the financial statements and audit reports.  \n\nTimely  availability  of  counterpart  funds  has  been  identified  as  an  issue  in  previous \n22. \nprojects  in  Sri  Lanka.  Though  SLR  is  a  revenue-earning  department,  the  revenue  is  not \nsufficient  to  meet  the  necessary  expenditure  of  SLR.  To  minimize  the  risk  of  implementation \ndelays,  ADB\u2019s  direct  payment  procedure  will  be  used  for  disbursement  above  $200,000  for \nconsulting services. Furthermore the continuation of staff throughout the implementation period \nis also essential. Frequent transfer of staff should be minimized. Continuous training should be \ngiven to the new existing staff to minimize this type of loss. \n\nFinancial management risks should be considered and updated throughout the life of the \n\n23. \nproject. Risk mitigation measures should also be updated accordingly. \n\n3. \n\nSri Lanka Ports Authority \n\n24. \nSLPA is established as a government entity by Parliament under Ports Authority Act No. \n51  of  1979  and  amendments  thereafter.  SLPA  has  satisfactory  capacity  in  project  financial \naccounting  and  ADB  disbursement  processes.  SLPA  accounts  division  is  headed  by  the \nDirector (Finance). The Director is supported by deputy directors and assistant directors in the \nhead  office  supported  by  the  support  staff.  All  the  staff  are  permanent  SLPA  officers.  SLPA \nkeeps  all  its  financial  transactions  according  to  financial  regulations  of  the  Government.  It \nfollows accrual basis accounting in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards and is also \nconsistent  with  International  Accounting  Standards.  The  internal  audit  division  of  the  SLPA  is \nalso  under  the  Chief  Internal  Auditor.  The  Government\u2019s  Office  of  Auditor  General  is  the \nexternal auditor of SLPA. The annual audit is carried out annually in accordance with Sri Lanka \nAuditing Standards. \n\n25. \nAccounting deficiencies were brought up by the auditors in their audits for the year 2012. \nIt includes non-confirmation of balances and timely availability of counterpart funds in previous \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\nprojects  in  Sri  Lanka.  Though  SLPA  is  a  revenue  earning  department,  the  revenue  is  not \nsufficient  to meet  the  necessary  expenditure  of  SLPA.  To minimize the  risk  of  implementation \ndelays,  ADB\u2019s  direct  payment  procedure  will  be  used  for  disbursement  above  $200,000  for \nconsulting services.  \n\nFinancial management risks should be considered and updated throughout the life of the \n\n26. \nproject. Risk mitigation measures should also be updated accordingly. \n\nB. \n\nDisbursement \n\nThe  Loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \n27. \nHandbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon \nbetween the  Government  and  ADB.  3  Online  training for  project  staff  on  disbursement  policies \nand  procedures  is  available  at:  http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning.  Project  staff  is \nencouraged to avail of this training to help ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. \nADB\u2019s  disbursement  procedures  (direct  payment,  commitment,  reimbursement,  and/or  imprest \nfund) will be used for withdrawal of project funds. A separate imprest account in US dollar at the \nCentral  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  and  a  sub-account  in  local  currency  will  be  established  and \nmaintained by each implementing agency. A local currency account for the related sub-account \nwill  also  be  established  and  administered  by  each  implementing  agency  to  facilitate \ndisbursement of local currency costs. \n\n28. \nThe  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished  and  liquidated  in \naccordance  with  the  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  The  total  outstanding  advance  to  each \nimprest  account  should  not  exceed  the  estimate  of  ADB\u2019s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid \nthrough the imprest account for the forthcoming 6 months. The request for initial advance to the \nimprest account should be accompanied by an Estimate of Expenditure Sheet4 setting out the \nestimated  expenditures  for  the  first  six  months  of  project  implementation,  and  submission  of \nevidence  satisfactory  to  ADB  that  the  advance  account  has  been  duly  opened.  The  imprest \naccounts  are  to  be  used  exclusively  for  ADB\u2019s  share  of  eligible  expenditures.  The  IA  who \nadministers the imprest account is accountable and responsible for proper use of advances to \nthe imprest account. \n\n29. \nADB\u2019s statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure will be utilized for reimbursement and \nliquidation and replenishment of advance to the imprest account. However, SLR can use SOE \nprocedure  for  payments  less  than  $100,000.  SOE  records  should  be  maintained  and  made \nreadily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review mission or upon ADB's request \nfor submission of supporting documents on a sampling basis, and for independent audit.5 \n\n30. \nBefore the submission of the first withdrawal application, the borrower should submit to \nADB  sufficient  evidence  of  the  authority  of  the  person(s)  who  will  sign  the  withdrawal \napplications on behalf of the borrower, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of \neach authorized person.  The minimum value per withdrawal application is  in accordance with \nthe Loan Disbursement Handbook.  Individual payments below such amount should be paid (i) \nby  the  executing  agencies/implementing  agencies  and  subsequently  claimed  to  ADB  through \nreimbursement, or (ii) through the imprest fund procedure, unless otherwise accepted by ADB. \n\n                                                \n3   Available at: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Handbooks/Loan_Disbursement/loan-disbursement-final.pdf \n4   Available in Appendix 10B of the Loan Disbursement Handbook. \n5   SOE form is available in Appendix 9B of the Loan Disbursement Handbook. \n \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\nThe \n\nimplementing  agencies  will  be  responsible \n\nfor  (i)  preparing  disbursement \n31. \nprojections,  (ii)  collecting  supporting  documents,  and  (iii)  preparing  and  sending  withdrawal \napplications to ADB. \n\nC. \n\nAccounting  \n\n32. \nThe  implementing  agencies  will  maintain,  or  cause  to  be  maintained,  separate  books \nand  records  by  funding  source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project,  following  accrual-\nbased  accounting  that  is  according  to  the  international  standard  and  national  accounting \nstandards.

A  Steering  Committee  (SC)  chaired  by  MOHEH  will  be  established,  comprising  RDA, \nMinistry of National Policies and Economic Affairs (represented by External Resources, National \nPlanning,  and  Project  Management  and  Monitoring  departments),  Ministry  of  Finance \n(represented by National Budget department), and Urban Development Authority, to coordinate \namong  stakeholders  and  oversee  project  implementation  from  time  to  time.  RDA  will  also \nestablish a project management unit (PMU) to implement the project. The PMU will coordinate \nand communicate the review comments to the consultant and will provide necessary guidance \nfrom time to time. \n\n \n3. \nUnder  this  loan,  the  Road  Development  Authority  (RDA),  MOHEH,  will  engage  an \ninternational consultancy firm  to: (a) carry out pre-feasibility study for selecting the possible new \nexpressways  for  the  proposed  expressway  network  (b)  select  the  future  expressways  to  be \nincluded  in  the  proposed  expressway  network,  for  feasibility  study,  detailed  engineering \ndesigns,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  environment  and  procurement  of  civil  works,  (c) \ncarry  out  feasibility  study  for  one  of  the  proposed  expressways  having  first  priority  in  order  to \nselect  the  final  trace,  (d)  undertake  detailed  engineering  designs  for  the  selected  expressway \nfinal trace, (e) assist in improving the design standards and construction technology, (f) deliver \ntraining  programs  about  the  planning  methodology,  design  standards  and  construction \ntechnology, and (g) improve road safety in the expanded expressway network.  \n\nBackground \n\nB. \n \nThe government of Sri Lanka has planned to have an Effective Expressway Network for \n4. \nseveral  decades  in  order  to  achieve  the  expected  economic  development,  to  cope  with  the \nincreasing traffic demand, upgrade life condition of people and alleviating the poverty in distant \nareas of the country. As a result of this effort, Sri Lanka constructed several expressways, and \nmore under construction are under planning stage.  \n\n \n\n5. \n\n \nExpressways in Operation \n \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nSouthern Expressway (E 01) from Kottawa to Godagama \u2013 126.1km \nOuter Circular Highway (E 02) \u2013 From Kottawa to Kadawatha (Section 1&2) \u2013 \n19.9km \nColombo Katunayaka Expressway (E 03) \u2013 from Paliyagoda to Katunayaka \u2013 \n25.8km \n \n\n(iii) \n\n6. \n\nExpressways under Construction \n\n32 \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n \n7. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\nExtension of Southern Expressway Section I - from Godagama to Beliatta \u2013 \n30km \nExtension of Southern Expressway Section II - from Beliatta  to Wetiya \u2013 15km \nExtension of Southern Expressway Section III - from Wetiya to Andarawewa \u2013 \n26km \nExtension of Southern Expressway Section IV - from Mattala to Hambantota via \nAndarawewa \u2013 25.0km \nOuter Circular Highway (E 02) \u2013 From Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya (Section 3) \u2013 \n9.3km \n\nExpressways in planning stage \n\nCentral Expressway from Kadawatha to Meerigama (Section 1) \u2013 37km \nCentral Expressway from Meerigama to Kurunagala (Section 2) \u2013 39.8km \nCentral Expressway from\u2013 Pothuhera to Galagedara (Section 3 \u2013 Kandy Link) \u2013 \n32.5km  \nCentral Expressway from Kurunagala to Dambulla (Section 4)  - 61km  \nRuwanpura Expressway from Kahathuduwa (On Southern Expressway) to \nPelmadulla via Rathnapura \u2013 73.5km \n\nExpansion  of  Expressway  Network.  The  government  plans \n\n \n8. \nfurther  extend \nexpressways  to  effectively  connect  major  cities such  as  Jaffna,  Trincomallee,  Anudarapura, \nPuttalam,  Pollonnaruwa,  Mannar,  Badulla  and  Batticaloa  with  the  existing  network. \nTentative  expressway  routes  are  identified  subject  to  further  analysis  in  terms  of    economic \ndevelopment  of  the  country  in the fields  of  industry,  agriculture, tourism,  fishing  etc.;  township \ndevelopment; social development of the country;  poverty alleviation; mitigation of environmental \nimpacts;  resettlement  and  social  consideration,  fair  distribution  of  income;  ethnic  cooperation \nand so on. \n\nto \n\nC. \n \n\n \n\nScope of the Consulting Services \n\n1. \n\nConceptual Study \n\n9. \nThe  Consultant  should  analyze  alternatives  of  the  expressway  network  expansion  to \neffectively connect major cities, and identify optimal expressway alignments in consultation with \nthe MOHEH, RDA, and ADB, supported by the following reviews and preliminary surveys.  The \naim  of  this  study  is  to  identify  an  effective  expressway  network  for  Sri  Lanka  and  select  one \nexpressway with most priority for feasibility study and detailed design. \n \n\n(i)  Carry  out  desk  study  by  reviewing  existing  road  and  transport  studies  including \nexpressway feasibility studies, and studies on other development projects recently \ncompleted  or  undergoing  in  Sri  Lanka,  to  gain  an  understanding  of  existing \ndevelopment  initiatives,  transport  needs,  etc.  and  to  determine  long  term \nrequirements of expressways. \n\n(ii)  Develop  a  traffic  model  using  a  software  acceptable  to  RDA  for  expressway \n\nnetwork and national road network in Sri Lanka. \n\n(iii)  Review  existing  surveys  and  data,  (e.g.  Traffic  data)  relating  to  all  expressways, \n\nwhether completed, ongoing or planned. \n\n33 \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n(iv)  The conceptual study will review those expressway alignments, taking into account \ntheir  role  in  terms  of  the  development  objectives  of  the  country.  The  conceptual \nstudy will also take into account traffic volume, easy access to major cities, future \ntownship  developments,  traffic  diversion,  road  safety,  social  and  environmental \nconsiderations,  serving areas  that  contain significant  levels  of  unemployment  and \npoverty and the costs and benefits of construction of each option.  \n\n(v)  The output of the conceptual study will be a list of expressways with priority ranking \nthat needs to be studied further and that requires construction to form an Effective \nExpressway  Network  (criteria  for  selecting  expressways  should  be  approved  by \nSC).  The  list  will  be  considered  by  RDA,  ADB  and  the  consultants  at  a  tripartite \nmeeting. Out of the final list, the expressway alignment that is prioritizes the most \nwill be selected for the subsequent feasibility study. \n\n(vi)  Prepare  an  implementation  program  for  the  expressways  selected  under  the \n\nconceptual study based on prioritization by the EA and IA. \n\n2. \n\nFeasibility Study \n\n10. \nThe aim of the feasibility study is detailed investigations of the different alternative traces \nof the selected expressway and selection of the final trace of the expressway which will be used \nfor  the  detailed  engineering  designs.    The  Consultant  should  select  an  expressway  route  to \nconnect a major city, in consultation with the MOHEH, RDA, and ADB.

Elevated Highway Project \n\nBackground, Objective, Scope, and Detailed Tasks of the Assignment \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nBackground. Colombo \u2013 Katunayake Expressway (CKE) was completed and has been \noperational since 2013. Hence, there is considerable increase in the volume of traffic entering \nColombo city  along  the  CKE. With  the  construction  of  the  Colombo Port Development  Project \nand  Port  City  Project,  traffic  flow  in  the  Colombo  metropolitan  area  will  further  increase.  The \nfuture Central Expressway will also contribute to congestion as it will be connected to the Outer \nCircular  Expressway  (OCH)  at  Kadawatha  and  part  of  this  traffic  will  enter  the  Colombo \nmetropolitan  area  via  New  Kelani  Bridge  (NKB),  increasing  the  volume  of  traffic  entering \nColombo city along the CKE. As CKE ends at NKB, which is at the periphery of the expressway \ntraffic  has  to merge  with the  local  traffic to reach  destinations  within the  city.  Extension  of  the \nExpressway  Network  to  the  economic,  administrative  and  transport  hubs  in  Colombo  has \nbecome important to improve the overall transport efficiency within.  \n \n2. \nWidening  of  existing  roads  has  become  economically  unviable  due  to  potentially  large \nscale  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  requirements.  To  explore  and  assess  alternative \noptions,  the  government  has  undertaken  a  feasibility  study  and  preliminary  design  for  an \nelevated  highway  along  the  existing  road  corridors  within  Colombo.  However,  it  has  also \nrevealed  that  the  construction  of  an  elevated  highway  within  an  existing  road  corridor  could \ncause an obstruction to traffic during the construction stage. Considering the above, Ministry of \nHigher  Education  and  Highways  has  decided  to  construct  an  elevated  highway  from  the  New \nKelani  Bridge  to  Fort  via  the  proposed  Port  Access  Elevated  Highway.  The  proposed  SASEC \nPort Access Elevated Highway traverses from Ingurukade junction and ends at Galle Face. The \ntotal length of the elevated road is 5.4 kilometers with four lanes. Entry/exit ramps at both ends \nof the road as well as at an appropriate location in Colombo port area will be constructed. The \nproject  also  includes  widening  of  the  existing  four  lane  ground-level  Port  Access  Road  to  six \nlanes,  and  other  related  facilities  such  as  toll  gates,  weighing  stations,  and  custom  and  port \ninspection facilities.  \n \n3. \nA  feasibility  study  comprising  preliminary  design  and  preliminary  environmental  impact \nassessment  (EIA)  has  been  completed  by  Katahira  &  Engineers  International  associated  with \nBangladesh Consultants Ltd. and Engineering Consultants, with the financial assistance of the \nAsian Development Bank.    \n\n \nObjective. The main objective is to prepare the SASEC Port Access Elevated Highway \n\n4. \nproject ready for investment and implementation. \n \n5. \nScope.  The  consultancy  services  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  (i)  assessing  traffic \ncomposition  and  axle  loads  on  the  elevated  road;  (ii)  review  and  updating  of  traffic  demand \nforecast  with  due  consideration  of  Colombo  Port  Development  Plan  and  Port  City  project;  (iii) \nreview  and  updating  of  the  feasibility  study  and  the  preliminary  design;  (iv)  preparing  detailed \nengineering  design  of  the  elevated  road  including  entry/exit  ramps  and  related  facilities;  (v) \nconducting of economic analysis including toll rate survey; (vi) conducting of road safety audit; \n(vii) conducting of environmental and social impact analyses and prepare appropriate safeguard \nplanning  documents;  (viii)  preparation  of  appropriate  construction  management  and  operation \nplan with due consideration of construction alternatives, to minimize the traffic congestion of port \n\n48 \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\nvehicles;  and  (ix)  preparation  of  detailed  engineering  design  for  the  expansion  of  the  existing \nPort  Access  Road.  The  consultants  will  also  support  procurement  of  civil  works  upon  the \ngovernment\u2019s request and provide supports to ADB missions during loan processing. \n \nImplementation  Arrangements.  The  Ministry  of  Higher  Education  and  Highways \n6. \n(MOHEH) is the executing agency, and Road Development Authority (RDA) is the implementing \nagency.  A  Steering  Committee  chaired  by  MOHEH  will  be  established,  comprising  RDA, \nMinistry of National Policies and Economic Affairs (represented by External Resources, National \nPlanning,  and  Project  Management  and  Monitoring  departments),  Ministry  of  Finance \n(represented by National Budget department), Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and Sri Lanka \nCustoms,  to  coordinate  among  stakeholders  and  oversee  project  implementation  from  time  to \ntime.  RDA  will  also establish  a  project management  unit (PMU)  to implement the  project. The \nPMU will coordinate and communicate the review comments to the consultant and will provide \nnecessary guidance from time to time. An authorized port engineer from SLPA will be assigned \nas a member of PMU. \n \n7. \n \n\nDetailed Tasks. For each project road, the consultant will carry out the following tasks. \n\nReview, Inventory, Condition, and Traffic Surveys \n\nTask 1. \n(i)  Review  existing  reports  including  Traffic  and Transport  Study  Report,  Preliminary \nEngineering Design Report, Resettlement Assessment Report, Social Assessment \nReport and Environmental Assessment Report to identify gaps. \n\n(ii)  Prepare  a  survey  plan  for  the  client\u2019s  approval  to  collect  the  inventory,  condition, \ndesign  requirements  and  traffic  data  of  existing  roads  influencing  the  proposed \nroad.

The population growth in CMR \nis expected to be 1.5%  annually until 2035 and CMR  is facing growing traffic congestion.  The \nrailway system carries about 13% of the passenger transport within CMR. The government aims \nto substantially increase the share of railway in the overall passenger and freight traffic. \n \n2. \nBackground.  The  development  of  the  railway  network  in  Sri  Lanka  started  in  1864. \nCurrently  ten  railway  network,  which  consists  of  around  1,500  route-km,  is  operated  by  the \nDepartment of Sri Lanka Railways (SLR). Almost 90% of the railway network of the country is \nsingle track, with 126 km of double tracks, 14 km of three tracks and 3 km of four tracks with all \nmultiple lines located within the CMR. The network covers much of the CMR along four major \ncorridors, namely  Main Line, Coastal Line, Kelani Valley Line and Puttlam Line totaling to 230 \nkm.  Railway  provides  an  important  service  during  the  peak  period  as  it  acts  as  a  commuter \nservice from the outer suburbs to central Colombo.  \n \nThere are long distance trains and commuter trains operated in the CMR. Out of the four \n3. \nrailway lines radiating from Colombo and serving the CMR, the Main Line and the Coastal Line \nare well patronized especially during peak periods. The Puttlam Line and the Kelani Valley Line \nare  single  track  and  not  as  attractive  due  to  low  train  speeds  and  frequencies.  The  Colombo \nFort  to  Maradana  section  has  the  highest  passenger  volume  of  136,438  passengers  per  day, \nfollowed  by  the  Maradana  to  Ragama  section  with  120,876  passengers  per  day.  The  train \nfrequency between Maradana and Fort is 228 trains per day, transporting on an average around \n950 passengers per train followed by the Maradana to Ragama section, with 150 trains per day \ncarrying on an average around 750 passengers per train. The Coastal Line is also fully utilized \nwith an average passenger volume of 800\u20131,100 per train. \n \n4. \nThe  average  speed  on  the  Main  Line  in  CMR  during  peak  traffic  periods  is  around  33 \nkilometers  per  hour  (kph)  while  the  speed  during  peak  traffic  periods  on  the  coastal  line  is \naround  28  kph. The  average speed  in  Kelani  Velley  line  is  around  26  kph.  Long  delays  occur \ndue to failures in the signaling system (especially during rainy days), and the frequent failures \nalso  occur  in  the  outdated  communication  system.  The  poor  condition  of  the  tracks  also \ncontribute  to  long  delays.  High  loading  level  is  another  issue  on  the  Main  Line  and  the  Coast \nLine especially during the peak period. \n \n5. \nThe project will improve the capacity and operating speed of the railway network  in the \nCMR by modernizing and upgrading track, signaling and telecommunication infrastructure; and \npotentially  electrifying  the  suburban  railway  lines,  focusing  initially  on  the  64  km  Veyangoda\u2013\nColombo Fort\u2013Panadura section. The project will also support procurement of fast and modern \ncommuter trains and modernization of rolling stock maintenance facilities, and upgrade railway \nstations  to  provide  improved  intermodal  connectivity  with  other  modes  of  public  transport  and \nthrough  park-and-ride  facilities  at  selected  stations.  The  project  will  increase  the  capacity  and \nattractiveness  of  the  railway  system,  thus  increasing  its  market  share  and  reducing  road \n\n61 \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\nto  schedule \n\nimplementation \n\nin  accordance  with \n\ncongestion  by  shifting  passengers  to rail  transport.  The project  will  be  designed  on  a  modular \nbasis to allow future expansion, e.g., until the Puttlam Line and Colombo Airport or until Galle, \nKanday and the Kelani Valley Line and Battaramulla, connect to Colombo Port.  \n \nObjective. The main objective is to prepare the railway project(s) ready for investment \n6. \nand implementation by completing feasibility studies, detailed engineering, safeguards planning \ndocuments, and bidding documents. All designs prepared under this project shall enable future \nelectric  operation  of  the  railway  network  with  overhead  catenary  system  (OCS),  although  the \nOCS may not be installed in the individual projects at an initial stage. Preparation of engineering \nin the Veyangoda \u2013 Panadura section will be the last component of the designs. The prepared \nprojects  and/or  components  shall  be  designed  in  a  modular  way  with  a  clear  prioritization  of \ncomponents \nfinancial  resources.  All \nimprovements on existing lines shall be designed in such a way that the disruption of ongoing \noperation will be minimized to a level acceptable to SLR. \n \n7. \nScope.  The  main  CMR  railway  corridors  to  be  considered  under  the  consultancy \nassignment are the corridors linking Colombo to Kandy and Galle (Main Line and Coastal Line), \nthe Puttlam Line towards Negambo and the Airport and the Kelani Valley line. New railway lines \nand  increasing  number  of  platforms  at  stations  may  also  be  identified.  The  required \ninterventions may include climate-resilient track rehabilitation, station upgrading, modernization \nof signaling and telecom system, railway electrification, rolling stocks, and maintenance facility \nto  be  identified  under  the  ADB-funded  TA  for  Colombo  Suburban  Railway  Project.20  For  the \npriority  projects,  the  consultant  will  prepare  feasibility  study,  detailed  engineering  design, \nsafeguard  planning  documents,  and  bidding  documents.  The  consultants  will  also  provide \nsupport  to  the  procurement  of  civil  works  and  equipment  upon  the  government\u2019s  request  and \nprovide support to ADB missions for loan processing. \n \n8. \nImplementation  Arrangements.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Civil  Aviation \n(MOT&CA)  is  the  executing  agency  for  the  railway  component  of  the  Transport  Project \nPreparatory  Facility.  MOT&CA  will  implement  the  railway  component  through  its  Project \nManagement  Unit  and  through  Department  of  Sri  Lanka  Railway  (SLR).  An  inter-ministry \nsteering  committee  chaired  by  the  Secretary  of  MOT&CA  will  oversee  and  guide  the \nimplementation.  MOT&CA  has  established  a  project  management  unit  to  engage  the \nconsultants,  manage  contracts,  review  consultant\u2019s  reports  and  provide  technical  guidance  as \nrequired.  \n \nB. \n \n9. \nfollowing. \n \n\nFor  each  priority  project,  the  consultant\u2019s  tasks  include,  but  are  not  limited  to  the \n\nDetailed Tasks of the Assignment \n\nTask 1. \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nTechnical Feasibility \n\nCollect  and  review  all  available  relevant  studies,  reports,  materials,  documents, \nand information including findings from the PPTA.  \nCollect  all  necessary  information  of  existing,  ongoing  and  future  planned \ndevelopment  works  of government  and  private  sector  in  and  around the project \n\n                                                \n20  ADB  approved a  Project  Preparatory  Technical  Assistance (PPTA)  grant  for  $1  million on  18  December 2015 to \nassess  the  railway  system  in the  CMR  including  the  corridors  linking  to  Kandy  and  Galle,  proposed  new  railway \nlines and improvement of the Kelani Valley Line, and identify and prioritize interventions. \n\n \n\n62 \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nfacilities, \n\nsite  and  consult  all  relevant  agencies/stakeholders.

Identify whether \nthe  project  is  likely  to  lead  to  private  land  acquisition,  thus,  impact  on  non-\ntitleholders.  The  screening  exercise  will  also  include  a  due  diligence  of  past \nsocial  impacts,  viz.,  if  land  acquisition  has  been  accomplished  in anticipation  of \nthe ADB project. \nIdentify  whether  the  project  will  be  located  in,  or  pass  through,  areas  of \nsignificant indigenous people\u2019s settlements, and if this is the case propose how to \nspecifically include indigenous peoples in project planning and implementation in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  2009  (SPS).  If  relevant, \nmake an overview of population characteristics in the project area and anticipate \nproject impacts.  \nPrepare  and  complete  the  checklist for  involuntary  resettlement  and indigenous \npeople screening. \nSince  this  is  ADB\u2019s  first  project  with  SLR,  experience  of  recent  and  ongoing \nresettlement  activities  financed  by  ADB  and  similar  multilateral  development \nagencies  in  Sri  Lanka  should  be  reviewed.  After  review,  draft  a  resettlement \nframeworks  (RF)  as  necessary  that  meets  the  Government  and  ADB  policy \ncompliance  standards.  The  RF  should  define  categories for  impact,  eligibility  of \naffected  people  for  compensation  and  provide  an  entitlement  matrix  covering \ncompensation  and  other  assistance  for  all  types  of  impacts.  The  RF  should \nprovide  the  methodology  for  the  calculation  of  compensations  based  on \nreplacement cost to fully replace the asset. The entitlement matrix should focus \non assistance provided to non-titleholders in the urban context.  \n\n67 \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nFor  the whole program and should impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  be  identified \nduring the screening process, even if indicative, prepare an Indigenous Peoples \nPlanning Framework (IPPF) as necessary.  \nBoth  the  RF  and  IPPF  should  be  based  on  a  consultative  process  with  the \nexecuting  agency  and  ADB  and  draw  from  broad-level  consultations  with  the \ncommunities likely to be affected by the subprojects. \nPrepare  relevant  chapters  and  appendixes  of  the  feasibility  study  report  on \nresettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  planning.

Verify  legal  boundaries  of  the  RoW \nwith the relevant ministry. \nBased on the detailed design, conduct census survey of all affected people (APs) \nand an Inventory of Lost Assets.  \nConduct  a  socioeconomic  assessment  of  all  APs  residing/using  the  corridor  of \nimpact  to  collect  data  on  family  composition,  details  on  age  and  sex  of  all  the \nhousehold members, income levels and occupational pattern, vulnerability status, \nlegal  ownership  status  of  land  (private,  traditional  and  customary  rights,  lease), \nasset occupancy status and skills possessed.  \nAssess  whether  the  compensation  standards  for  all  types  of  assets,  crops,  and \ntrees  are  based  on  replacement  cost  and  describe  in  detail  the  valuation \nmethodology used. Undertake market surveys to compute replacement value of \nland.  \n\n(xii) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xiii)  Undertake market survey to assess the rental market in nearby areas to ensure \n\nsecurity of tenure for non-titleholders. \n\n(xiv)  Prepare a comprehensive income and livelihood restoration program, supported \nby adequate budget, to help APs improve, or at least restore, their incomes and \nlivelihoods. Identify specific measures for the affected poor, ethnic minorities, or \nother vulnerable households.  \n\n(xv)  Conduct in-depth consultations with the APs, ensuring the involvement of women \nin  the  process.  Consultations  should  take  the  form  of  public  meetings,  focus \ngroup  discussions  and  one-on-one  interviews.  Ensure  that  the  consultation \nprocess is  well  documented  and  demonstrate  how  the  concerns  of the  affected \npersons are included to the design of the RP.  \n\n(xvi)  Establish a cut-off date for eligibility criteria for non-title holders and ensure and \n\ndocument that it has been publicly disseminated.  \n\n(xvii)  Prepare  overall  budget \n\nfor  compensation,  resettlement  and  rehabilitation \n\nassistance.  \n\n(xviii)  Based  on  the  draft  R&R  entitlements  prepare  an  appropriate  action  plan  for \n\nadditional support required for the vulnerable \n\n(xix)  Organize  workshops  on  draft  R&R  policy  to  receive  feedback  from  identified \nstakeholders, including implementing agency, line agencies (specifically revenue, \nforest, tribal welfare, etc.), NGO and others. \n\n68 \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n(xx)  Assist  the  SLR  to  develop  a  computerized  database  management  system  for \nrecording APs and lost assets. The system should reflect the present impact on \nAPs and accordingly the entitlements for APs are planned. The system should be \nin  place  from  the  beginning  of  the  resettlement  survey.  Also,  develop  cadastral \nmapping of affected plots for construction of new alignments using inventory map \ndeveloped under the feasibility study. \n\n(xxi)  Assess  the  capacity  of  the  Government  in  implementing  the  proposed  RP  and \n\n(xxii) \n\nIPP, and recommend improvements and actions required. \nIf impacts on Indigenous Peoples are identified, prepare an Indigenous Peoples' \nDevelopment  Plan  to  minimize  adverse  impacts  on  tribal  communities  and  to \nenhance their access to project benefits on par with others. \n\n(xxiii)  Prepare  relevant  chapters  and  appendixes  of  the  detailed  design  report  on \nresettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  planning.  The  appendixes  should  include \nthe RP for each project where resettlement impacts have been identified; IPP for \neach project, where impacts on indigenous people have been identified.  \n\n \nTask 5. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nEnvironmental and Climate Change Risk Assessment \n\nCarry out an environmental assessment of the project in accordance with ADB's \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  2009  (SPS),  and  the  Government\u2019s  environmental \nregulations and policies. \nClassify  the  project  in  accordance  with  the  environmental  impact  assessment \nrequirements under the Central Environmental Authority, Ministry of Environment \nand  Forests  and  ADB\u2019s  screening  checklist  for  environmental  categorization \naccording to the SPS. \nDepending on the classifications, prepare IEE as per relevant guidelines of CEA \nand  ADB,  and  if  EIA  is  required,  prepare  TOR  that  is  acceptable  to  CEA.

Sri Lanka has been playing a significant role as a regional transport hub due \nto  its  strategic  location  within  the  vicinity  to  major  international  shipping  routes.  Low-cost \nlogistics is critical to its economic efficiency and transition to export-oriented economy. Logistic \ncosts  in  the  country  affect  both  competitiveness  of  exported  goods  and  consumer  price  of \nimported goods. Introduction of larger vessels and emergence of gigantic shipping line alliances \naggravated  competition  among  international  ports.  The  Sri  Lankan  port  sector  needs  to  keep \nstrengthening  its  capacity  and  competitiveness  by  improving  infrastructure,  operational \nefficiency, and institutions, to survive the competition. Following national economic growth and \nrapid growth of international container shipping demand, the needs to strengthen their capacity \nis urgent.  \n \n2. \nTo meet the development needs, the technical assistance for National Port Master Plan \n(NPMP)  will  be  provided  by  ADB  to  ensure  that  port  infrastructures  will  be  developed  and \noperated in an optimum manner with concomitance with urban areas and in line with long term \nplanning.  The  NPMP  will  identify  priority  projects,  promote  public  and  private  investment,  and \nboost economic efficiency improvement by reducing logistics cost along with restructuring of Sri \nLanka Ports Authority (SLPA). \n  \n3. \nThis  technical  assistance  loan  is  to  support  SLPA  to  prepare  for  development  of  port \nfacilities  following  the  NPMP.
