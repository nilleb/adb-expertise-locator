Following  a  stand-alone  project \nmodality, it will focus on three existing flood embankment systems (Dibrugarh, Kaziranga, and \nPalasbari) protecting key urban and productive rural areas along the Brahmaputra River. These \nareas are vulnerable to flooding because of infrastructure deterioration, riverbank erosion, and \nlimited involvement of local governments and stakeholders. A holistic risk management system \nwill be put into operation with the establishment of community disaster management committees \n(DMCs),  a  balanced  combination  of  structural  and  nonstructural  measures,  and  sustainability \nmechanisms  for  relevant  infrastructure.  International  advanced  practices  will  be  introduced, \nincluding  innovative  and  cost-effective  approaches  for  riverbank  erosion  management  and \nprogressive  knowledge  development  to  cope  with  flooding  and  riverbank  erosion.  Resilience \nagainst  the  possible  impacts  of  climate  change  will  be  strengthened,  which  may  increase  the \nfrequency and magnitude of water disasters in the region, thereby contributing to the efforts of \nclimate change adaptation. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nStrategic  context.  Flooding  is  a  major  recurrent  natural  calamity  in  India,  causing \n3. \nannual damage of $450 million on average. High flood risk discourages private investments in \nproductive  activities,  and  is  thus  a  key  contributor  to  persistent  regional  and  rural\u2013urban \ndisparity.  In  many  cases,  the  poorest  segment  of  the  society  suffers  the  greatest  risk  and \ndamage.  Vulnerability  is  particularly  high  in  eastern  and  northeastern  India  where  poverty  is \nhigh. The Government of India is promoting state level sector reforms through its National Water \nPolicy  revised  in  2002,  advocating  comprehensive  structural  and  nonstructural  measures \nintegrated  with  improved  catchment  management  within  a  long-term  planning  framework. \nStrengthening resilience against flooding is a key element of the government\u2019s Climate Change \nAction Plan defined in 2009.1  \n\n4. \nAssam  is  located  in  alluvial  plains  and  adjacent  low  hilly  terrain  of  Brahmaputra  River \nbasin. It is one of the lowest income states in India. Despite recent acceleration of its economic \ngrowth,  led  by  broad  economic  and  fiscal  reforms,  the  gap  between  the  state  and  national \naverage  income  has  been  widening.  Effective  flood  risk  management  remains  high  on  the \nstate\u2019s  development  agenda,  since  a  substantial  majority  of  its  urban  and  agriculture  area  is \nlocated in flood-prone areas, and suffers from devastating damages in high flood years. Yet the \ntask  is  quite  challenging,  given  massive  flood  discharges  of  the  Brahmaputra  River  and  its \nhighly dynamic morphology, caused by extreme rainfall and fragile subsoil in its catchment, and \nheavy  sediment  transport.  Addressing  the  problems  calls  for  a  comprehensive  long-term \nperspective and a sound policy and planning framework, as advocated by the government.    \n\n5. \nAssam  state  government,  through  the  Water  Resources  Department  (WRD),  has \nextended embankments and associated structures to protect about 50% of its flood-prone area. \nHowever, their effectiveness is constrained because of poor designs overlooking local drainage, \ninsufficient  maintenance,  failure  caused  by  river  erosion,  and  limited  stakeholder  participation. \n\n                                                 \n1   Government of India. 2008. National Action Plan on Climate Change. New Delhi. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nImproving the reliability  of  existing  embankment systems  with  assured  maintenance should  be \ngiven high priority. Where feasible, riverbank protection needs to be provided systematically and \nadaptively  in  response  to  the  dynamic  morphology.  Substantial  opportunities  exist  to  enhance \ncost-effectiveness  and  sustainability  through  new  technologies,  such  as  (i)  use  of  sand-filled \ngeotextile  containers  as  revetment  materials  to  provide  protection  with  lower  cost,  higher \nreliability,  and  faster  implementation;2 (ii)  flow-retarding  screens  to  induce  silt  deposition  along \neroding  bank  lines  as  another  low-cost  option;  and  (iii)  erosion-prediction  modeling  that  can \nfacilitate advance planning and implementation of mitigation measures. Nonstructural measures \n(such  as  risk  education,  mapping  and  warning,  and  flood  proofing)  should  also  be  introduced \nand  pursued  with  sound  knowledge  development  to  understand  complex  morphology  and \nfloodplain hydrology, and participatory mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability.  \n\nPolicy framework. The state government initiated economic reforms in the early 2000s \n6. \naimed at inclusive growth with stronger governance and public participation. A partnership with \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  was  established  in  strategic  sectors  including  fiscal \nmanagement,  power,  transport,  and  flood  management.  The  state  government  has  initiated \nreform steps including (i) establishing the state Water Resources Council (headed by the chief \nminister) and Board as sector apex bodies to guide the reform process; (ii) drafting a state water \npolicy with a view to setting up an integrated water resources management system; (iii) holistic \nFRERM as a prime element of the draft state water policy, setting out a sound strategy; and (iv) \nnotifying  the  National  Disaster  Management  Act  and  establishing  disaster  management \norganizations  (DMOs)  at  state  and  local  government  levels.  To  establish  and  demonstrate \nholistic and sustainable FRERM in partnership with ADB, in January 2010 the state government \nset up Assam Integrated FRERM Agency (AIFRERMA), an autonomous body anchored to WRD \nwith a multidisciplinary structure, stable leadership, high level oversight, and timely fund flow. A \nroad  map  to  consolidate  effective  operation  of  the  AIFRERMA  has  been  prepared,  covering \nstrategic planning, improved infrastructure quality, and sustainable maintenance.3 \n\n7. \nMultitranche  financing  facility  investment  plan.  The central government and Assam \nstate government  accorded  high  priority  to  extending  effective  FRERM  systems  in flood-prone \nareas in their Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2007\u20132012.4 This provided the basis for the investment \nprogram. However, in view of the absence of external assistance for the sector in the past and \nlimited staff experience, the initial engagement will take a focused approach on three selected \nand  appraised  subprojects  with  existing  embankments  protecting  critical  urban  and  productive \nrural areas. The subprojects cover 90 kilometers (7% of the total reach) of Brahmaputra River in \nthe state. Innovations and international best practices and lessons have been drawn, in terms of \n(i) knowledge  development;  (ii)  more  cost-effective,  adaptive,  and  sustainable  alternatives  in \nstructural  and  nonstructural  instruments;  and  (iii)  holistic  program  delivery  with  improved \ngovernance,  stakeholder  participation,  infrastructure  quality  control,  integration  with  disaster \nmanagement  and  livelihood  promotion  programs,  and  accountability  mechanisms  in  program \nmanagement.5 The  subprojects  form  a  concise  investment  plan  for  the  investment  program. \nWider  replication  is  envisaged  upon  successful  implementation  and  preparation  of  a  long-term \nsector investment plan, and progressive strengthening of the institutional and knowledge bases.   \n\n8. \nRationale  for  ADB  partnership  and  multitranche  financing  facility.  The investment \nprogram is consistent with ADB\u2019s assistance strategy for India, which has extended its operation \nin  water  resources  and  rural  infrastructure  in  states  willing  to  pursue  sector  reforms  in \n\n                                                 \n2   Boulders quarried from forests are conventionally used as revetment materials, which are becoming more costly.  \n3  The road map actions are in the Subsector Assessment (Summary): Flood Protection (Appendix 2).  \n4   Government  of  India,  Planning  Commission.  2008.  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan  2007-2012.  New  Delhi;  and \n\nGovernment of Assam. 2008. Eleventh Five-Year Plan 2007-2012. Guwahati.   \n5  Lessons learned and incorporated are shown in Lessons Learned (Appendix 2).   \n\n\fpartnership with ADB. Primarily focused on infrastructure and associated software for FRERM, \nwhich are also needed for climate change adaptation, it is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 20206 \nand Water for All Policy.7 From the perspective of the state, the investment program is needed \nas  the  first  step  toward  statewide  application  of  comprehensive  FRERM  over  the  longer  term. \nThe state set up AIFRERMA envisaging long-term partnership with ADB. Although designed as \na project loan with three appraised subprojects, the MFF modality is most suitable because of \nthe longer implementation period needed to provide a range of FRERM structures step by step, \nwith  strengthening  of  the  state  and  local  institutions  and  knowledge  base,  and  verification  of \ninnovative  measures.  The  multitranche  financing  facility  also  provides  better  opportunities  in \nterms of (i) higher implementation quality as a result of its structure to commit the future tranche \nbased  on  the  performance  of  the  ongoing  tranche  and  the  readiness  of  the  new  tranche,  (ii) \nprogressive  improvement  of  the  project  design  incorporating  lessons  and  findings,  and  (iii) \nprogress  of  incremental  institutional  reform  actions  that  can  be  more  strongly  pursued  during \ntranche  processing  with  higher  managerial  attention.  Longer-term  sector  involvement  is  also \nneeded to develop sound capacities of the institutions concerned.  \n\nThe investment program will institutionalize comprehensive risk management systems to \n\n9. \ncope with critical flooding and riverbank erosion in Assam. It will demonstrate the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nestablishment  of  a  sound  planning  framework  of  holistic  FRERM  as  a  basis  for \nstrategic and systematic implementation of sector programs; \ncomprehensive structural and nonstructural measures, introducing cost-effective, \nsustainable,  and  innovative  riverbank  protection  adaptive  to  natural  river \nprocesses, and nonstructural measures applied in a limited scale in Assam; \nfocused  support  for  institutional  development,  including  (a)  knowledge  base, \naccountable \n(b) autonomous  AIFRERMA  with  multidisciplinary \nimplementation  with  stable \nreforms  and  capacity \nstrengthening of the WRD; and \nintegration of disaster management and FRERM, with DMOs empowered to join \nimplementation process and the participation of women and vulnerable groups.   \n\nleadership,  and \n\nand \n\n(c) \n\n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact of the investment program will be reduced economic vulnerability and social \n10. \ndisruption  caused  by  flood  and  riverbank  erosion  in  Assam.  This  will  contribute  to  increased \neconomic growth and reduced poverty in the three priority subproject areas along 90 kilometers \nof the Brahmaputra River having vulnerable embankments protecting the livelihoods of 1 million \npeople  in  urban,  suburban,  and  productive  rural  areas. Its  outcome  is  enhanced  effectiveness \nand reliability of the state\u2019s FRERM systems providing enhanced resilience.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  outputs  of  the  investment  program  comprise  (i)  FRERM  planning,  institutional  and \n11. \nknowledge  bases;  (ii)  comprehensive  FRERM  systems  in  three  subproject  areas;  and  (iii) a \nmultidisciplinary  project  management  system.  The  investment  will  be  split  into  two  projects: \n(i) project  1  (years  1\u20134)  will  provide  immediately  required  investments  in  the  three  subproject \nareas8 while providing a basis for institutional outputs, and (ii) project 2 (years 4\u20137) will complete \nthe appraised investments with necessary refinement following the experience of project 1. The \noutputs for the investment program and project 1 are summarized in Table 1. \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2008.

At  each  subproject  level,  subproject  implementation  offices \n(SIOs)  are  established  augmenting  the  existing  WRD  field  offices  with  multidisciplinary  staff. \nThe  implementation  arrangements  for  project  1  are  summarized  in  Table  5  and  described  in \ndetail in the facility administration manual (FAM).  \n\nTable 5: Project 1 Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period a \nEstimated project completion date \nProject management \n(i)   Oversight body \n\nArrangements \nOctober 2010\u2013March 2014 \n31 March 2014 \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies \n(iv)  Project management unit \n\nProcurement  \n\nConsulting services  \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nGoverning council of AIFRERMA, chaired by the chief secretary, and \ncomprising an additional chief secretary and heads of relevant \ndepartments (agriculture, finance, fisheries, forestry and environment, \nplanning and coordination, revenue and disaster management, rural \ndevelopment, social welfare, and water resources) \nAIFRERMA  \nSIOs under AIFRERMA \nGuwahati, 24 staff in three multidisciplinary directorates \n$16.3 million \n3 contracts \nICB \u2013 goods \n$24.9 million \n9 contracts \nNCB \u2013 goods and civil works  \n$0.6 million \n11 contracts \nShopping \n753 person-months  $8.4 million \nQCBS \n308 person-months  $0.5 million \nCQS \nIndividual \n$0.1 million \n30 person-months \nAdvance contracting for procurement and consultant engagement  \nRetroactive financing for up to 20% of the loan amount for expenditures \nincurred 12 months before loan signing \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed between the government and ADB.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, AIFRERMA = Assam Integrated Flood and Riverbank Erosion Risk Management \nAgency, CQS = consultant qualification selection, ICB = international competitive bidding, NCB = national competitive \nbidding, QCBS = quality and cost based selection, SIO = subproject implementation office. \na  The implementation period of the investment program will be from October 2010 to March 2017. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n15. \nInstitutional  strengthening.  Separate  institutional  strengthening  technical  assistance \n(TA) for capacity development of community-based integrated FRERM in Assam is included as \na cluster TA subproject and will be implemented in combination with the investment program.10 \nThe  cluster  TA  subproject  aims  to  enhance  the  capacity  of  the  FRERM  institutions  to  put  into \noperation comprehensive FRERM systems and a community-based approach.11   \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to India for Advanced Project Preparedness for Poverty Reduction. Manila. \n11 The outputs of the TA comprise (i) institutional mechanisms to prepare and implement effective community-based \nflood  risk  management  programs;  and  (ii) modern  FRERM  systems,  tools,  and  guidelines  for  knowledge  base \ndevelopment,  structure  design  and  implementation,  nonstructural  measures,  and  safeguards  management.  The \nestimated  TA  cost  is  $750,000,  of  which  $600,000  is  financed  by  ADB  from  funds  provided  through  the \nMemorandum of Understanding between the Government of the United Kingdom and ADB on the Department for \nInternational Development\u2013ADB Partnership for India, 2009\u201313; the balance is provided by the central government \nand Assam state government.  \n\n\fA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n16. \nThe structural measures provided under the investment program include (i) renovation of \nflood  embankments  and  their  ancillary  facilities,  and  (ii)  riverbank  protection  where  ongoing \nerosion is threatening critical flood embankments and populated areas. Flood embankments will \nbe designed to provide protection against 100-year floods in urban areas and 25-year floods in \nrural  areas  in  accordance  with  the  intended  design  level  of  the  existing  structures.12 Ancillary \nfacilities  (such  as  sluice  gates)  will  be  provided  to  facilitate  optimal  water  management, \nincluding conservation of natural water bodies and drainage improvement. Riverbank protection \nwill  pursue  an  adaptive  approach  of  stabilizing  naturally  developed  bank  lines  through \nrevetments to minimize impacts on morphology. More cost-effective and sustainable innovations \nwill be applied, including the use of sand-filled geotextile containers, flow-retarding screens, and \nerosion-prediction  modeling  (para.  5).  The  effectiveness  of  geotextile  containers  and  erosion-\nprediction  modeling  was  demonstrated  in  an  ADB-financed  project  in  lower  Brahmaputra  in \nBangladesh,  and  reflected  in  the  country\u2019s  national  guidelines  for  riverbank  protection.13 The \ninvestment  program  will  consolidate  these  innovations  in  Assam  with  performance  monitoring \nand  evaluation.14 Based  on  this,  standardization  and  replication  in  other  flood-  and  erosion-\nprone areas in Assam and in other parts of India can be explored. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic Impacts and Sustainability \n\nIn \n\nthe \n\nEconomic  returns. \n\n17. \nthree  subproject  areas  (Dibrugarh,  Kaziranga,  and \nPalasbari),15 primary benefits include (i) reduced flood hazards, (ii) reduced land loss associated \nwith river erosion, and (iii) reduced cost of flood relief and rehabilitation. Investor confidence is \nalso expected to increase, leading to enhanced investments in rural and urban production. The \nestimated economic internal rates of return for all subproject level interventions (of the entire life \nof  the  investment  program)  are  18%\u201320%  for  the  three  subprojects,  and  17%  for  the  overall \ninvestment  program  (including  capacity  development).  Sensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  to \nassess  the  impacts  of  a  range  of  risks,  including  cost  overruns,  the  need  for  follow-on \nadaptation, 16 implementation  delay,  and  reduced  incremental  crop  production.  The  analysis \nshowed  that  project  returns  are  generally  robust.  The  greatest  risk  appears  to  be  the  cost \noverrun, of which the switching value is 44% for the Kaziranga subproject.  \n\n18. \nSustainable  maintenance  and  adaptation.  To be effective, the FRERM infrastructure \nrequires maintenance and adaptation. The state government has responsibility for FRERM (as a \npublic  good)  through  budgetary  expenditures,  although  recovery  through  increased  land \nrevenues  on  urban  and  agriculture  land  is  envisaged  in  the  longer  term. 17 The  investment \nprogram supports the sustainability of infrastructure through a multipronged approach, including \n(i) an  infrastructure  asset  management  information  system  to  be  established  starting  with  the \nselected  subprojects  and  eventually  covering  the  entire  state,  as  a  basis  of  sound  monitoring, \nplanning,  and  implementation  of  maintenance  and  adaptation;  (ii)  progressively  enhanced \n                                                 \n12  A 100-year flood is an extremely destructive flood that has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year. A 25-year \n\nflood has a 4% chance of occurring in any given year. \n\n13 ADB.  2002.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Jamuna-Meghna River Erosion Mitigation Project. Manila.  \n\n14 ADB also facilitated observation and consultation of experts from India (including Assam) and Bangladesh on the \n\napplication of these new technologies in the lower Brahmaputra (Jamuna) River in April 2010. \n\n15  Existing  embankments  in  these  areas  were constructed  in  the 1950s\u20131960s but  are  facing  the immediate  risk  of \n\nembankment breach induced by river erosion.  \n\n16  Adaptation is defined as providing additional works to cope with changes in morphological conditions. \n17 The  state  government  is  computerizing  land  records  with  the  objective  valuation  method,  supported  by  ADB  in \n\npublic resource management sector.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fallocation  of  the  annual  maintenance  budget  toward  the  full  requirement;18 (iii)  improved  and \ntransparent  management  of  fund  utilization,  including  disclosure  to  the  district  administration \nand DMOs concerned (including local DMCs) regarding fund allocation, procurement, and work \norders; (iv) mobilization of available state and central funding for routine maintenance, such as \nrural  employment  guarantee  programs;  (v)  delegation  of  maintenance  of  minor  infrastructure \nsuch as sluices and flood platforms to the DMCs concerned; and (vi) utilization of government \ncentral  flood  management  programs  for  major  maintenance  and  adaptation,  particularly  of \nriverbank protection structures requiring capital expenditures.19  \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n19. \nGood  governance  is  essential  for  ensuring  and  sustaining  the  intended  benefits.  The \nWRD\u2019s  financial  management  system  was  assessed  and  the  investment  program  has \nincorporated  measures  for  ensuring  accountability  and  transparency,  pursuing  participatory \nmanagement  of  process  and  outputs  with  quality  control  mechanisms. 20  Subprojects  are \nprepared  by  setting  out  clear  input  and  output  targets  in  their  implementation  plans.  DMOs \n(including  DMCs)  are  empowered  to  participate  in  implementation,  such  as  endorsing \nflood  risk  management  plans  and  periodic  work  plans.  Program \ncommunity-based \nexpenditures\u2014including  the  civil  work  scope,  quantity,  cost,  and  contractors\u2014will  be \nposted  at  the  subproject  sites,  monitored  by  trained  DMO  members  and  consultant  quality \nmonitors.  With  awareness  campaigns,  complaints  handling  officers  will  operate  grievance \nmechanisms. AIFRERMA will undertake annual financial audits of SIOs and the PMU through a \nchartered  accounting  firm,  and  establish  an  internal  third-party  technical  audit  mechanism  via \nexternally engaged experts with the support of consultants. The specific institutional measures \nare shown in Schedule 3 of the FFA and the FAM (Appendix 2).  \n\n20. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  state  government  including  AIFRERMA  and  the  WRD.  Policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM.21 \n\nD. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\n21. \nSome 32%\u201358% of the population in the three subproject areas falls below the poverty \nline\u2014most  of  these  people  live  on  less  than  $2  a  day.  The  investment  program,  through \nreduced  flood  loss  and  incremental  food  production,  will  enhance  the  annual  average \nagricultural net income of farm laborers by 27%\u201351% (Rs1,400\u2013Rs2,400) and marginal farmers \nby 28%\u201341% (Rs4,900\u2013Rs5,900). The social development strategy will mainstream stakeholder \nparticipation in community DMCs, linking them with existing state government poverty reduction \nprograms  and  providing  them  with  support  prepared  under  the  investment  program.  The \ninvestment  program  has  been  classified  \u201ceffective  gender  mainstreaming.\u201d  In  support  of  the \npolicy  principles  of  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  for  the  economic  and  social  empowerment  of \nwomen, a gender action plan for the investment program has been defined, which will enhance \nthe  role  of  women  in  project  institutions  (including  30%  women\u2019s  representation  in  DMCs); \nprovide  at  least  30%  program  benefits  to  women  in  accordance  with  the  Assam  Women  Act, \n\n                                                 \n18  Fund allocation was increased by 80% to $6 million over the 5 years up to FY2010, although this is only about 30% \n\nof the estimated requirement.  \n\n19 This  is  in  line  with  the  recommendation  of  the  special  task  force  formed  after  the  major  flood  in  eastern  and \n\nnortheastern India, including Assam, in 2004.   \n\n20 The WRD operates a financial and accounting system in accordance with the state financial rules and under the \nsupervision of the Finance Department. Under the investment program, a specialized financial unit will be set up \nwithin the PMU in AIFRERMA with assignment of finance cadre staff who will be trained in accounting policies and \nprocedures, including ADB disbursement systems.     \n\n21 Facility Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f2005; and strengthen the capacity of AIFRERMA, the WRD, and other project organizations in \naddressing gender development issues in promoting integrated FRERM.  \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nSocial  safeguards.  The  investment  program  has  been  classified  category  A  for \n22. \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  category  B  for  indigenous  peoples. While  its  structural  measures \nprimarily  involve  the  renovation  of  existing  flood  embankments,  strip  acquisition  of  land  is \nneeded  in  association  with  embankment  retirement  to  cope  with  riverbank  erosion,  widening, \nand  extension.  The  majority  of  acquired  lands  are  located  along  the  eroding  bank  line,  which \nwould  be  lost  without  project  works.  Project  1  will  require  acquisition  of  no  land  in  Dibrugarh \n(embankment  widening  on  the  existing  right-of-way  with  squatters,  affecting  310  households); \n20.6  hectares  in  Kaziranga  (for  inner  secondary  dyke,  affecting  80  households);  and  29.9 \nhectares in Palasbari subproject (for shifting, affecting 274 households). Full resettlement plans \nfor project 1 works of these subprojects were prepared and agreed. Indigenous peoples issues \nwere found insignificant for project 1, and any negative impact is addressed in the resettlement \nplans. For social safeguards issues for the subsequent project(s), a resettlement framework and \nindigenous  peoples  development framework  have  been prepared  and  agreed following  central \nand state government laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n\n23. \nUnder the investment program, all affected persons are entitled to compensation for land \nacquired and lost assets at their replacement cost. They will also be assisted in improving, or at \nleast restoring, their pre-intervention income and livelihood standards, and productive capacity. \nPayment for acquired lands, structures, and other eligible benefits will be fully made prior to the \ncommencement  of  civil  works  contracts.  In  case  of  significant  negative  impacts  on  indigenous \npeoples, an indigenous peoples development plan or actions will be prepared to ensure equal \nsharing  of  benefits.  The  AIFRERMA  PMU  will  supervise  preparation  and  implementation  of \nsocial  safeguards  plans  by  the  SIO  concerned,  with  the  support  of  consultants  and \nnongovernment organizations. The estimated cost is $7 million for the investment program.  \n\n24. \nEnvironment.  The  overall  negative  environmental  impacts  are  deemed  insignificant. \nNevertheless,  the  investment  program  has  been  classified  category  A  to  provide  the  rigorous \nassessments of the project\u2019s implications on diverse riverine environment. Environmental impact \nassessments  (EIAs)  were  carried  out  for  the  three  subprojects,  along  with  their  summary  EIA \n(SEIA).22 The EIAs cover the impacts of the entire investment program and will be updated prior \nto  project  2  as  necessary. 23 The  EIAs  noted  that  the  investment  program  will  have  overall \npositive  impacts  on  the  environment  and  is  overwhelmingly  supported  by  local  stakeholders, \nincluding  (i)  increased  security  against  flooding  and  riverbank  erosion,  protecting  vital  assets \nand enhancing production systems; (ii) an improved aquatic environment with the installment of \nsluice  gates  and  optimal  water  management;  and  (iii)  an  improved  disaster  risk  management \nsystem.  Key  potential  negative  impacts  include  (i)  possible  impacts  on  river  hydrology  and \nmorphology;  (ii)  impacts  from  future  climate  change,  earthquakes,  and  upstream  development \nworks; and (iii) construction-related impacts, including possible impacts on endangered species \nsuch as river dolphins, loss of trees, health hazards, and pollution from construction camps.  \n\nAmong  these,  no  significant  impacts  are  anticipated  on  hydrology  and  morphology,  as \n25. \nthe  project  will  renovate  embankments  that  have  existed  since  the  1950\u20131960s.  Riverbank \nprotection will adopt revetments and siltation screens that will not intervene against the existing \nchannel  flows.  Systematic  monitoring  will  be  put  in  place  and  mitigation  measures  will  be \n\n                                                 \n22 The SEIA was circulated to ADB Board of Directors on 1 July 2009.  \n23 An environmental assessment and review framework has also been prepared and agreed for the preparation and \n\nimplementation of minor CBFRM measures.     \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nprovided  in  case  unexpected  effects  are  observed.  Other  impacts  can  be  mitigated  through \nconstruction  site  management  and  tree  plantation  programs.  These  were  incorporated  in  the \nenvironmental management plan, which is estimated to cost $1.8 million. The AIFRERMA PMU \nand  SIOs  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  environmental  management  plan;  they  will \nengage environment experts and will be assisted by consultants. \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n26.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 6.24  The overall benefits \nof  the  investment  program  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  potential  costs  from  risks  and  are \ndetailed in the risk assessment and risk management plan.  \n\nTable 6: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nLimited institutional capacities \n\nDelayed implementation \n\n(i) Prior establishment of AIFRERMA with qualified CEO and other staff, \n(ii) focused implementation of three subprojects, and (iii) capacity building \nsupport through separate TA and consultants. \n(i) Advance procurement and engagement of consultants and NGOs; (ii) \nadvance initiation of land acquisition and resettlement; and (iii) compliance with \nreadiness checklist, including PMU establishment and staffing. \nFlood and riverbank erosion \n(i) Establishment of asset inventory and management information system, \nprotection infrastructure \n(ii) enhanced fund allocation and improved management, (iii) linkage to centrally \nsustainability \nfunded and local government programs, and (iv) mobilization of local resources. \nAIFRERMA  =  Assam  Integrated  Flood  and  Riverbank  Erosion  Risk  Management  Agency,  CEO  =  chief  executive \nofficer, NGO = nongovernment organization, PMU = project management unit, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n27. \nThe government and the state government through AIFRERMA have assured ADB that \nimplementation of the investment program shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including \nthose  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting \nservices, and disbursement as described in detail in the FAM and loan documents. \n \n28. \nThe government and the state government through AIFRERMA have given ADB certain \nundertakings  for  the  MFF,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  FFA.
