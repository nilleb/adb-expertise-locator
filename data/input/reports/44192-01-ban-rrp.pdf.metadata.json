The design and monitoring framework for the project is in Appendix 1. \n \n2. \nBangladesh and India will establish a cross-border interconnection between the western \nelectrical grid of Bangladesh and the eastern electrical grid of India to facilitate the exchange of \nelectricity between the two countries. In accordance with technical, operational, and economic \nconsiderations,  the  proposed  interconnection  will  include  about  125  kilometers  (km)  of  400 \nkilovolts (kV) double-circuit transmission line between the electrical substations at Baharampur \nin  India  and  Bheramara  in  Bangladesh,  a  400  kV  switching  station  at  Baharampur,  a  500-\nmegawatt  (MW)  back-to-back  high  voltage  direct  current  (HVDC)  substation  (400/230  kV)  at \nBheramara,  and  associated  infrastructure  on  both  sides.  The  interconnection  will  facilitate  an \ninitial  power  flow  of  500  MW  into  Bangladesh  from  the  Indian  grid  starting  in  2012,  with  a \nprovision to expand the power flow to 1,000 MW. This will help to address the significant power \nshortages in Bangladesh. The project only covers the part of the interconnection facilities to be \nestablished in Bangladesh. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe  Bangladesh  economy  has  grown  by  about  6%  a  year  on  average  since  2005  and \nthis  level  of  growth  is  expected  to  continue.  Despite  its  notable  macroeconomic  progress, \nBangladesh's electrification ratio is still very low, with only 47% of the population having access \nto electricity in 2009.1 Rapid economic growth is causing electricity demand to increase sharply \nas the country continues to industrialize and raise the living standards of its large population. In \n2009, the dependable power-generating capacity was only 3,800 MW, while the peak demand \nwas about 5,500 MW, implying a peak deficit of nearly 1,700 MW.2 This has been resulting in \nfrequent power cuts and voltage fluctuations. A World Bank study states that Bangladesh loses \nnearly  $1  billion  of  economic  output  a  year  due  to  power  outages  and  an  unreliable  energy \nsupply3. Bangladesh needs to diversify its energy sources as there are concerns over the long-\nterm  availability  of  domestic  natural  gas,  which  fuels  about  85%  of  the  national  power  sector \ngeneration capacity.4 \n \nTo  overcome  the  power  supply  crisis,  several  initiatives  have  been  taken  to  add  new \n4. \ngenerating capacity. The government has renewed attempts to mobilize private capital to build \npower  plants,  whose  investment  requirements  exceed  the  resources  available  in  the  public \nsector.  In  spite  of  past  success  in  mobilizing  private  capital  to  establish  large  power  stations, \ninternational financial markets remain volatile and there is strong worldwide demand for power \nplant  equipment  that  hampers  significant  capacity  addition  in  Bangladesh.  As  a  short-term \nmeasure, the government has allowed rental power plants of 50\u2013100 MW to be installed.  Other \ninitiatives by the government include the refurbishment of old gas turbines and the conversion of \nopen-cycle gas turbine generators to combined-cycle power plants, which is expected to result \n\n                                                 \n1  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources.

The  government  is  also  working  on  initiatives  to \nsource power from South Asia region.  \n \n5. \nIn  1997,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  facilitated  initial  dialogue  between \nBangladesh  and  India  to  identify  possible  exchanges  of  electricity.  However,  the  dialogue  did \nnot lead to definite results. In January 2010, a joint communiqu\u00e9 was signed heralding important \nbreakthroughs in cooperation between the two countries. This initiative between the two prime \nministers  will  enhance  regional  cooperation  in  South  Asia,  prioritizing  grid  connectivity  and \nexchange of power. Against the backdrop of a growing power crisis in Bangladesh, connecting \nthe  two  grids  will  demonstrate  the  substantial  economic  benefits  that  come  from  enhanced \nregional cooperation and help to address the energy gap in the region.5  \n \nThe project is in line with the recommendation  of a recent  sector assessment program \n6. \nevaluation  6  that  ADB  should  facilitate  power  transmission  connectivity  between  India  and \nBangladesh,  eventually  enabling  Bangladesh  to  harness  regional  energy  resources,  including \neventual  access  to  hydropower  from  Bhutan  and  Nepal.  The  project  will  support  regional \ncooperation  in  South  Asia  and  the  regional  cooperation  and  integration  objectives  under \nStrategy 2020.7 ADB has been supporting dialogue on South Asia regional energy cooperation \nthrough the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) regional energy trade \nstudy, which was concluded in early 20108. \n \n7. \nIn  India,  the  Central  Electricity  Authority  reported  a  countrywide  installed  capacity  of \n156,780  MW  as  of  January  2010.  To  meet  growing  domestic  demand,  India  has  plans  to \nincrease  its  capacity  by  64,000  MW  over  the  11th  Five  Year  Plan  period  (2007\u20132012)  and \n100,000  MW  in  the  12th  Five  Year  Plan  period  (2012\u20132017).  On  11  January  2010,  the \ngovernments  of  Bangladesh  and  India  entered  into  a  memorandum  of  understanding  to \ncooperate  in  the  power  sector  for  a  period  of  at  least  5  years.  In  further  discussions  to \nimplement  this  memorandum  of  understanding,  the  Government  of  India  has  expressed  its \nintent to make a minimum of 250 MW available for sale to the Bangladesh Power Development \nBoard  (BPDB)9 by  2012.10 An  additional  250  MW  could  be  sourced  from  the  Indian  electricity \nmarket,  subject  to  applicable  approvals.  The  proposed  project  will  help  BPDB  to  lower  the  \nexisting  deficit,  improve  the  power  supply,  and  reduce  the  dependence  on  inefficient  and \nexpensive  captive  and  rental  generation  facilities.  A  more  reliable  power  supply  will  benefit \nmanufacturing  and  service  industries  in  the  western  part  of  Bangladesh,  including  poor  and \nvulnerable  consumers  who  are  often  the  hardest  hit  by  inadequate  and  poor  quality  power \nsupply.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n8. \nThe  project  impact  will  be  enhanced  regional  cooperation  in  the  power  sector, \ncontributing  to  economic  development  growth  in  Bangladesh.  The  project  outcome  will  be  the \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2010. Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program: South Asia 2006\u20132008. Manila. \n6  ADB. 2009.

The  project  is  expected  to  alleviate  the  growing  power  crisis  in  Bangladesh  by  making \navailable  up  to  500  MW  of  additional  power  by  2012.  This  will  partially  meet  the  needs  of \nexisting  and  new  consumers  and  support  the  achievement  of  the  goal  of  electricity  for  all  by \n2020 in the National Energy Policy.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe physical outputs from the project will be a 40 km, 400 kV double circuit transmission \n9. \nline in Bangladesh, a 500 MW back-to-back HVDC substation (400 kV/230 kV) at Bheramara, \nand  a  230  kV  double  circuit  loop-in  loop-out  interconnection  at  Bheramara  to  link  with  the \ntransmission network in Bangladesh. In addition to these physical outputs, the project will train \nstaff of the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB), the executing agency for the project, \nto  manage grid  operations  efficiently  following the  installation  of  the  HVDC  system.  It  will  also \ntrain  staff  of  the  BPDB,  Power  Division,  and  Bangladesh  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  on \naspects of cross-border electricity trading.  \n \nD. \n \n10. \nThe project is estimated to cost $158.6 million.

It  will  be \nresponsible  for  supervising  implementation  and  monitoring  of  operational  performance  of  the \ninterconnection  in  Bangladesh.  To  ensure  effective  project  implementation,  the  PGCB  has \nestablished  a  project  management  unit,  headed  by  a  project  director.    A  steering  committee \nheaded  by  the  power  secretary  of  Bangladesh  will  be  constituted  to  review  the  progress  and \nachievements  of  the  project.  A  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  power  secretaries  of \nBangladesh and India, is in place to review the overall progress of the cooperation agreements. \nA  working  group,  chaired  by  the  joint  power  secretaries  of  both  countries,  will  monitor  and \ncoordinate  the  activities  of  the  cooperation  agreement  and  a  technical  team  will  manage  the \ntechnical aspects of the interconnection. \n \n13. \nGoods and works to be financed under the project  will be procured in accordance with \nADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Advance  procurement \naction  has  been  approved.  The  borrower  and  the  PGCB  have  been  advised  that  approval  of \nadvance procurement does not commit ADB to finance the project. The transmission lines and \nthe substation will be procured following international competitive bidding procedures. Success \nof the project also depends on the timely implementation of the interconnection facilities in India \nand  the  negotiation  of  firm  power  purchase  agreements.  Bids  for  two  packages  for  the \ninterconnection facilities in India have been received and are under evaluation. \n \n14. \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual (Appendix 2).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe  implementation  arrangements  for  the  project  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n \nArrangements \n1 February 2010\u201331 December 2012 \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated project completion date  30 June 2013 \nProject management \n(i) \n\nOversight body \n\nExecuting agency \nKey implementing agency \nProject management unit \nProject safeguard measures \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi)        Coordination with India on construction of  \n             interconnection facilities and negotiation of  \n             power purchase agreements \n\nProcurement \n\nInternational competitive \nbidding \n\nAspects  \nConsulting services (project \nmanagement)  \nRetroactive financing and advance \ncontracting \nDisbursement \n\nSteering committee chaired by secretary, Power \nDivision, Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral \nResources, Government of Bangladesh  \nPower Grid Company of Bangladesh \nPower Grid Company of Bangladesh \nBheramara in Kusthia District with 20 staff of PGCB  \nIndependent monitoring mechanism \nJoint steering committee chaired by secretary, Power \nDivision, Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral \nResources, Government of Bangladesh and \nsecretary, Ministry of Power, India.  \nA joint working group and technical team comprising \nrepresentatives from both sides has been set up. \nTwo contracts \n\nTotal cost is $123.9 \nmillion  \n\n$ 4.9 million \n\n24 person-months \n\nArrangements \nEntirely  financed \nby government  \nAll  eligible  contract  packages  and  eligible  expenditures  agreed \nbetween ADB and the borrower. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  ADB  and \nthe borrower. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, PGCB = Power Grid Company of Bangladesh.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n15. \nA stand-alone small-scale capacity development technical assistance (TA) financed from \nthe Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013IV) has been approved. The TA will finance the \ncost  of  engaging  three  international  consultants  for  5  person-months  to  advise  the  BPDB  on \ncross-border power purchase contracts and capacity building of the staff of the BPDB to procure \npower  from  India,  two  safeguard  specialists  for  4  person-months  for  the  review  and \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  and  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  and \nworking group consultations including those to finalize the operational management procedures. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n16. \nTo  facilitate  exchange  of  electricity  and  to  establish  an  efficient  electrical  grid \ninterconnection  between  Bangladesh  and  India,  two  possible  options  were  available.  These \nwere (i) connecting the northeastern region of  India with the eastern region of Bangladesh, or  \n(ii)  connecting  the  eastern  region  of  India  with  the  western  region  of  Bangladesh.  A  joint \ntechnical team comprising representatives from the power utilities of both countries concluded \nthat  the  second  option  was  more  robust  and  would  better  facilitate  the  export  of  power  to \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nBangladesh  from  various  generating  stations  in  India  as  well  as  the  export  of  power  from \nBangladesh  to  load  centers  in  India,  when  feasible.  The  mode  of  interconnection  at  400  kV \ncould either be synchronous or asynchronous. If a synchronous interconnection is adopted, both \ngrids  would  operate  at  the  same  frequency  and  careful  regulation  and  management  of  the \ntwo  countries  would  be  needed.  However,  an  asynchronous \nsystem  between \ninterconnection  would  facilitate  complete  control  of  the  exchange  of  power  between  the  two \ncountries  in  either  direction,  as  well  as  independent  operation  of  the  two  grids.  This  would \nobviate the need for additional upstream investment to protect assets from faults and surges in \nthe  other  system.  Accordingly,  based  on  technical,  operational,  and  economic  considerations, \nan  asynchronous  interconnection  with  an  HVDC  back-to-back  station  terminal  and  a  400-kV \ndouble circuit transmission interconnection line between the two countries has been adopted.    \n\nthe \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n17. \nFinancial  analysis  of  the  proposed  project  has  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with \nADB's  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.12 All  financial  costs  and  benefits  have \nbeen  expressed  at  constant  2010  prices.  Financial  viability  was  assessed  by  comparing  the \nincremental  costs  and  benefits  of  the  project.  The  incremental  benefits  were  calculated  based \non  the  PGCB's  revenue  stream.  Costs  used  to  determine  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return \ninclude capital investments, operation and maintenance costs, and taxes incurred to install and \noperate the project. The financial internal rate of return of the project is 6.0%, which compares \nfavorably with the estimated weighted average cost of capital of 2.9%, indicating that the project \nwill be financially viable. \n \nGiven that Bangladesh is currently facing a power deficit, cost savings due to prevented \n18. \npower  outages  are  a  direct  tangible  economic  benefit  of  the  project.  The  economic  analysis \nconducted for the project considered only power generation cost savings using power imported \nfrom  India  over  alternative  sources.  Least-cost  analysis  demonstrated  the  attractiveness  of \npower  imports.  The  project\u2019s  economic  feasibility  was  assessed  both  for  the  region  and  for \nBangladesh.  The  project  provided  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  31%  for  the \nregion  whereas  it  provided  an  EIRR  of  27%  for  Bangladesh.  These  estimates  were  based  on \nconservative assumptions of resource cost savings. A much higher EIRR would be achieved if \nprevented  outage  costs  were  used  for  economic  analysis. The  project provides  an  acceptable \nEIRR even if only 250 MW is delivered at the currently proposed rates. The project returns are \nstable  against  the  relevant  risk  factors  and  the  analysis  clearly  demonstrates  the  economic \nfeasibility of the project.   \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n1. \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Governance Measures \n\n19. \nThe  government  aims  to  create  a  corruption-free  environment  and  in  support  of  that \nobjective  it  established  the  Anticorruption  Commission  in  2004.  ADB  has  provided  TA  to  help \nthe  government  build  capacity  and  provide  support  for  an  integrated  anticorruption  strategy.13 \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n13 ADB.  2003.

In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by \nADB  in  connection  with  the  project  will  be  subject  to  prior  ADB  approval  and  will  include \nprovisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the \nexecuting  agencies  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as \nthey  relate  to  the  project.  The  government  will  ensure  that  the  PGCB  and  other  power  sector \nentities  have  operational  autonomy  and  that  no  organizational  changes  are  carried  out  that \nwould affect their ability to perform their obligations under the project. \n\nTable 4 summarizes major governance measures adopted for the project. \n\n \n \n\n20. \n \n\nArea \nProcurement \n\nTable 4: Governance Measures \n \n\nMeasures \n\n(i)  A project management unit has been established, headed by senior officers \n\nreporting directly to the managing director of the PGCB. \n\n(ii)  Bid specifications and packaging have been prepared to ensure maximum \n\ncompetition under international competitive bidding procedures. \n\n(iii)  Information on procurement will be disclosed on the PGCB website. \n\n(iv)  Procurement capacity support will be available at the resident mission to expedite \n\naction on procurement issues. \n\nFinancial management \nand audit \n\nestablished. \n\n(i)   Measurable financial performance indicators for the PGCB have been \n\n(ii)   Expenditures, other financial transactions, and safe custody of project-financed \n\nassets will be monitored by the accounting and control systems of the PGCB. \n\n(iii)  The internal audit reports will be provided to the audit committee of PGCB's \n\nboard. \n\n(iv)  Financial statements will be audited by independent auditors acceptable to ADB \n\nand regularly published and reported to the shareholders. \n\nThe PGCB will independently file tariff petitions with the BERC. \n\nADB will review and examine any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices relating to the project.  \n\nInstitutional and \ncorporate governance \nAnticorruption \n\nGrievance review \n\nA grievance redress mechanism will be established to address issues relating to \nproject implementation. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  BERC  =  Bangladesh  Energy  Regulatory  Commission,  BPDB  =  Bangladesh  Power \nDevelopment Board, PGCB = Power Grid Company of Bangladesh. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n21. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  PGCB.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual.14 \n \n\n                                                 \n14 Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n22. \nBangladesh  is  the  seventh  most  populous  country  in  the  world.  In  2006,  its  population \nwas  recorded  as  156  million,  with  116.2  million  living  in  rural  areas.15 The  mainstay  of  the \neconomy  is  agriculture,  which  employs  almost  60%  of  the  labor  force.  The  main  agricultural \nproducts  are  rice  and  sugarcane.  The  other  major  sector  is  manufacturing  which  has  been \nslowly growing and contributed 17% of the gross domestic product in 2007.16 \n \nDespite  recent  economic  growth,  Bangladesh  remains  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in \n23. \nthe  world  with  nearly  half  of  its  population  living  below  the  $1.25  poverty  line.  Natural  factors \nsuch as floods, cyclones, and other natural calamities contribute to this, but so do institutional \nand  governance  factors.  Lack  of  adequate  and  reliable  energy  sources,  especially  electricity, \nhave  played  a  vital  role  in  perpetuating  poverty.  The  consumption  of  commercial  energy  in \nBangladesh  is  one  of  the  lowest  in  the  world  at  about  200  kilograms  of  oil  equivalent  per \ncapita.17 Only 47% of the population, most of whom live in the cities (refer footnote 1), has any \naccess  to  electricity.  Even  with  access  to  electricity,  power  cuts  and  irregular  supply  cause \nproblems.  All  these  factors  have  severely  impacted  the  steady  growth  of  industries,  added  to \nenvironmental  pollution,  affected  the  delivery  of  essential  services,  including  health  and \neducation, and contributed to high poverty levels. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n24. \nThe project will generate employment for local people during construction. Availability of \nreliable  power  supply  will  enhance  the  production  capacity  of  existing  industries  and  facilitate \nthe  initiation  of  new  ones  as  well  as  create  employment  in  agriculture,  garments,  and  other \nbusinesses  that  depend  on  regular  power  supply.  It  is  expected  that  this  project  will  indirectly \ngenerate significant employment.  \n \nThe  risk  of  the  project  helping  to  spread  HIV  is  minimal,  but  if  potential  threats  are \n25. \nidentified during project implementation, information dissemination campaigns will be carried out \nin the project areas.   \n \nFrom the environment standpoint, the project is classified as category B, as it is unlikely \n26. \nthat  it  will  lead  to  any  adverse  irreversible  impacts.  The  PGCB  has  prepared  an  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE),  which  analyzed  data  collected  through  reviews  of  reports, \nsatellite photographs, discussions with stakeholders, and field visits to the project area. The IEE \nwas  prepared  following  the  requirements  of  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2010),  the \ngovernment's  environmental  impact  assessment  guidelines,  and  related  national  policies  and \nlegislation.  It  was  well  prepared  and  provides  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  to \naddress  any  impacts.  Potential  impacts  will  mostly  be  temporary.  The  Department  of \nEnvironment  has  granted  environmental  clearance  for  the  project.  Adequate  budgetary \nprovisions  for  implementation  of  the  EMP  have  been  made.  The  EMP  will  form  part  of  the \nbidding  documents  and  the  PGCB  will  supervise  both  the  construction  contracts  and  EMP \nimplementation. Regular implementation progress reports will be submitted to ADB. In the event \nof  any  change  of  alignment  or  the  identification  of  any  unanticipated  environmental  impact \nduring the course of project implementation, the PGCB will revise the EMP.  \n                                                 \n15 International Fund for Agricultural Development. 2008. \n\nhttp://www.ruralpovertyportal.org/web/guest/country/statistics/tags/bangladesh \n\n16 ADB. 2009.

The total land required \nis  45.84  hectares  of  which  only  0.22  hectares  will  be  acquired  from  private  owners.  The \nremaining  land  belongs  to  Bangladesh  Railways  and  the  government.  The  project  will  require \nphysical displacement of 12 dwelling units and one shop. In addition, 1,634 households will lose \ntheir  crops  and  trees.  People  who  are  displaced  will  be  given  compensation  for  their  affected \nassets, including crop compensation for the land at the tower locations, in accordance with the \nprovisions in the resettlement plan. The project authorities will make arrangements for training \nthe  displaced  people,  including  tailor-made  programs  for  skills  development.  Care  has  been \ntaken to disseminate all relevant information regarding the project and the views and opinions of \nthe  displaced  persons  were  taken  into  consideration  in  developing  the  entitlement  matrix.  If, \nduring  implementation,  additional  aspects  develop,  suitable  adjustments  will  be  made  in  the \nentitlement matrix in consultation with the affected displaced persons. With regard to indigenous \npeople, the project is categorized as category C.  \n \n28. \nThe associated transmission component that will be installed in India by the Power Grid \nCorporation  of  India  (PGCIL)  is  also  subject  to  due  diligence  and  must  be  implemented  in  a \nmanner  consistent  with  the  requirements  of  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  PGCIL  has \ndeveloped  its  own  environment  and  social  safeguard  policy  which  requires  it  to  conduct  due \ndiligence  and  ensure  implementation  of  all  necessary  mitigation  measures.  This  policy \ndocument  is  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  PGCB  will  be  requested  to  provide  ADB  with  PGCIL\u2019s \nsafeguard plans and monitoring reports for review.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n29. \nA major risk relates to the fact that a legally binding power purchase agreement has not \nyet  been  signed  or  negotiated.  Should  the  relevant  implementing  entities  in  India  and \nBangladesh  fail  to  reach  a  legally  binding  agreement  on  the  intended  delivery  of  at  least  250 \nMW  at  the  current  proposed  rates,  the  economic  value  of  the  facilities  constructed  in \nBangladesh and the project benefits might be severely affected. The same applies if the power \nsector  cooperation  agreement  between  the  two  countries  is  not  extended  beyond  the  initial \nperiod of 5 years. To mitigate this risk, it has been agreed that the relevant power sector entities \nin  India  and  Bangladesh  must  enter  into  a  memorandum  of  understanding  on  the  key \nparameters of the proposed power purchase arrangements prior to any withdrawal of ADB loan \nproceeds and that a legally binding power purchase agreement must have been signed within 6 \nmonths  thereafter,  on  terms  and  conditions  acceptable  to  ADB.    Major  risks  and  mitigating \nmeasures are summarized in Table 5.  \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nDelay, \ninterconnection facilities in India \n\nfailure \n\ncomplete \n\nto \n\nDelay, failure to enter into binding \npower  purchase  agreements  or \nnon extension of the cooperation \nagreement after January 2015 \n\nHVDC \n\nLimited \nimplementation \nBangladesh \n\ntechnology \nin \n\ncapacity \n\nMitigating Measures \nBulk  power  transmission  agreement  was  signed  between  PGCIL  and \nBPDB  for  implementation  and  operation  of  interconnection  facilities  in \nIndia  \nThe  Government  of  Bangladesh  is  aware  of  this  risk  and  expressed \ncomfort  with  the  documented  political  commitments  made  on  the  key \nparameters  of  the  power  sector  cooperation  by  the  two  governments. \nEntering  into  a  MOU,  followed  by  legally  enforceable  long-term \ncontracts between BPDB and Indian power utilities, will further mitigate \nthis risk. \nThis is mitigated by the decision to hire PGCIL as consultants to assist \nin  project  design,  bidding  support,  and  implementation  support  in \nBangladesh.

The  government \nwill  supplement  any  shortfall.  Costs  will  be  passed  on  to  consumers \nthrough the transmission tariff to be determined by BERC. \nADB  will  recruit  experienced  individual  consultants  under  the  small-\nscale capacity development TA to support the government and BPDB to \nnegotiate the contracts.  \n\nThe government has initiated a review of its gas pricing policy which is \nlikely  to  impact  existing  bulk  and  retail  electricity  tariffs.  Further,  most \nnew  power  plants  will  be  based  on  dual  fuel  technology  and  imported \nfuel would be comparatively more expensive than power to be procured \nfrom India under this arrangement.  \nThe  eastern  region  of  India  is  expected  to  add  significant  generation \ncapacity over the next 5 years to meet growth in demand. It is expected \nthat up to 500 MW will be available for supply to Bangladesh. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  BERC  =  Bangladesh  Energy  Regulatory  Commission,  BPDB  =  Bangladesh  Power \nDevelopment  Board,  HVDC  =  high  voltage  direct  current,  MW  =  megawatt,  MOU  =  memorandum  of  understanding, \nPGCIL = Power Grid Corporation of India, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n30. \nThe  government  and  the  PGCB  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \nwill conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n31. \nThe  government  and  the  PGCB  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. Effectiveness of the \nloan  and  project  agreements  is  conditional  upon  submission  of  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement, \nsatisfactory  to  ADB,  under  which  the  loan  proceeds  are  relent  to  PGCB.  Furthermore, \nwithdrawals  from  the  loan  account  are  conditional  upon  a  memorandum  of  understanding \nbetween  the  relevant  power  sector  entities  in  Bangladesh  and  India  on  the  key  parameters  of \nthe proposed power purchase arrangements. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n32. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR65,986,000  to  the  People's  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  \nBangladesh\u2013India  Electrical  Grid  Interconnection  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  \nwith  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum  thereafter;  for  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements presented to the Board. \n\nDate:  10 August 2010 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n           President \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n \n \n\nAppendix 1\n\n11\n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with \nBaselines  \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms  \n\n \n \n \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \n \nEnhanced regional \ncooperation in the \npower sector, \ncontributing to \neconomic growth \n\nOutcome \n \nSuccessful \ndevelopment and \noperation of a \ntransmission link \nbetween Bangladesh \nand India \n\n \n \nCountry economic outlook \nand government statistics \n \n \n \n \n \nADB Energy Outlook for \nAsia and the Pacifica  \n \n \nBPDB and annual energy \nsector reports for Bhutan, \nIndia, Maldives, Nepal, \nand Sri Lanka \n \n\nBPDB annual reports \n\n \n \nBPDB annual reports \n\n \n \nImprovement in gross \ndomestic product per \ncapita in Bangladesh to \nmore than 4% by 2015 \n(2008 baseline: $574 \nper capita at current \nprices)  \nPower consumption in \nBangladesh to improve \nby 2012 \n(2008 baseline:159 \nkWh per capita in \nBangladesh compared \nwith approximately 300 \nkWh per capita in South \nAsia)  \n \nAccess to power \nsources in the South \nAsia region  \n(2009 baseline: no \nexchange with any \nother country) \n\n \n \n500 MW of power \n(1,152\u20133,456 GWh) \navailable over the \ninterconnection to \nBangladesh \ncommencing 2012 \n(2009 baseline: no \ntransfer of power) \n \n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks  \n\nAssumptions \n \nSuccessful development of \nthe eastern electrical grid of \nIndia prepares the \nfoundation for regional \nelectricity interconnections \nand optimal power sourcing. \n \nPolitical and operational \nagreements arrived at \nbetween South Asian \ncountries on regional \nelectricity trading \n \n \n \n \n \nAdditional investments in \ntransmission capacity to \nfacilitate such power flows \n \n\nAssumptions \n \nAvailability of 250-500 MW \npower generation capacity to \nBangladesh on long-term \nbasis from India  \n \nPower interconnection \ninfrastructure and capacity \nbuilding successfully \ncompleted by 2012  \n \nRisks \nCost of delivered power is \nnot competitive compared to \noptions in Bangladesh. \n \nDelay in entering into power \npurchase agreements \n \nInadequate power \ngeneration capacity in the \neastern region of India \n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n     Appendix 1 \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \nOutputs \nPhysical Investment \n1.
