An  environmental  impact  assessment  was \nAssessment  undertaken. The summary environmental impact assessment was \ncirculated to the Board of Directors of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) and posted on the ADB website on 22 October 2007. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  consists  of  three  components:  one  each  in \nAlashankou land port, Kanas scenic region, and Yining City, which \nare  all  located  in  northern  or  northwestern  Xinjiang  Uygur \nAutonomous Region (Xinjiang), bordering with countries in Central \nAsia. The Project aims to strengthen cross-border trade, tourism \ndevelopment,  and  economic  growth  in  order  to  raise  living \nstandards while protecting the environment of the people living \nand working in one of the poorest and most remote parts of the \ncountry. The Yining component aims to (i) improve the existing \nroad infrastructure in order to assist commercial access to cross-\nborder trade and improve urban living conditions; and (ii) expand \nroads and utility services into new development areas to support \nindustrial  activity,  improve  the  local  economy,  and  increase \nemployment.  The  Alashankou  component  will  develop  new \ninfrastructure and upgrade existing infrastructure services in order \nto improve living conditions, encourage expansion of cross-border \ntrade,  expand  the  local  economy,  and  reduce  pollution.  The \nKanas component will provide new water supply, sanitation, solid \nwaste management, and road network infrastructure in order to \ndevelop  tourism  and  the  local  economy,  improve  the  living \nconditions  and  health  of  ethnic  minorities,  and  protect  the \nenvironment. The area includes a nationally designated tourist \ndestination. \n   \nRationale  The Project is the first ADB-financed municipal infrastructure and \nenvironmental  management  project  in  Xinjiang  to  support \nenvironmentally  sustainable  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction and facilitate regional trade between the PRC and the \nCentral  Asian  republics  (CARs).  Xinjiang  shares  borders  with \neight countries and is the gateway between the PRC and the \nCARs. As the historic Silk Road passes through it, Xinjiang has a \nwealth  of  history  and  ethnic  culture,  and  this  has  encouraged \ntourism  development.  The  region  is  also  rich  in  natural ", "ii   \nresources\u2014including  oil,  metals,  and  minerals\u2014that  provide  a \nsound  basis  for  economic  development.  Although  Xinjiang\u2019s \nforeign trade has grown rapidly since 1992, the province remains \none of the poorest in the country. To maximize growth potential \nand raise the living standard of the people (particularly that of the \nethnic  minorities),  the  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region \ngovernment (XUARG) in its Eleventh Five-Year Plan accorded \nhigh  priority  to  sustainable  economic  development  through \nconstruction and upgrade of infrastructure, particularly in major \nborder ports and cities.  \n \nGiven Xinjiang\u2019s location and abundance in resources, XUARG \nfocuses its development strategy on the province\u2019s potential role \nin  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC) \nProgram.  ADB  has  supported  regional  cross-border  trade \nfacilitation,  customs  cooperation  and  modernization,  and \ninfrastructure development through the CAREC Program since the \nlate  1990s.  This  Project,  and  the  recently  approved  Xinjiang \nRegional Road Development Project (Korla\u2013Kuqa Section) and \nthe  Xinjiang  Urban  Transport  and  Environmental  Improvement \nProject that is currently under preparation, fully support XUARG\u2019s \ndevelopment objectives, the CAREC program, and the CAREC \nTransport and Trade Facilitation Strategy (which is currently being \nprepared). Improvement of the road network and accessibility and \nstrengthening  of  environmental  protection  and  management  is \ncrucial to achieving and sustaining inclusive growth in Xinjiang\u2019s \nborder cities and areas. An efficient, safe, and environmentally \nsustainable road transport network, together with improved public \nutility and environmental infrastructure, is needed (i) to cope with \nthe increasing demand resulting from cross-border trade growth, \ntourism development, industrial development, and urbanization; \nand  (ii)  to  benefit  the  poor  and  ethnic  minorities.  Policy  and \ninstitutional  reforms  in  transport  planning,  traffic  management, \ninfrastructure  operations  and  maintenance,  and  environmental \nmanagement have been taken into consideration in the project \ndesign. \n \nThe Project aims to remove infrastructure constraints, address \nenvironmental  concerns,  and  promote  sustainable  economic \ngrowth  in  three  of  Xinjiang\u2019s  border  cities  and  areas  and  is \nconsistent  with  the  PRC\u2019s  development  priorities  for  the  poor \nwestern  region.  The  Project  covers  a  range  of  settlements\u2014a \nmedium-sized city, a small but rapidly expanding land port, and \nfour villages in a fast-growing tourist attraction area\u2014which will \nhave a demonstration role for other similar cities and areas on \nhow to plan and manage sustainable infrastructure development \nbefore rapid economic growth occurs in order to ensure protection \nof  the  environment.  The  Project  supports  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  which  aims  to  strengthen \ninclusiveness,  manage  the  environment,  promote  regional \ncooperation  and  integration,  catalyze  investment,  and  improve \ngovernance, and it also supports ADB\u2019s CAREC strategy. It is also \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  urban  sector  strategy  and  water  policy, \nwhich support infrastructure investment in settlements that are ", "    iii \ndynamic engines of economic growth and employment creation, \ninnovation, and entrepreneurship, and sources of social services. \n \nThe Project will be complemented by a grant of $150,000 from the \nGender  and  Development  Cooperation  Fund  to  support  (i) \nactivities  on  capacity  building  in  local  tourism,  and  (ii) \ndemonstration projects in health and hygiene for ethnic minority \nwomen in the Kanas component of the Project. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project is sustained socioeconomic growth and \nimproved living standards in the border areas of northern Xinjiang \n(Altay  Administrative  District,  Boertala  Mongolian  Autonomous \nPrefecture, and Yili Kazak Autonomous Prefecture). The outcome \nis  improved  municipal  infrastructure  and  a  better  living  and \necological  environment  in  Alashankou  land  port,  Kanas  scenic \nregion, and Yining City. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $190.9 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $25.2 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  Amount  % of \nSource \n($ million equivalent)  Total \nAsian Development Bank  105.0  55 \nYining City Government  39.2  21 \nBoertala Mongolian Autonomous  36.3  19 \nPrefecture Government \nAltay Prefecture Government  10.4  5 \nTotal  190.9  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \n  A loan of $105.0 million from the ordinary capital resources of \nADB will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government of the PRC will relend the loan proceeds to \nTerms  XUARG (the executing agency) on the same terms and conditions \nas the ADB loan. The loan proceeds then will be onlent to the \nAltay  Prefecture  government,  the  Boertala  Mongolian \nAutonomous  Prefecture  government,  and  the  Yining  City \ngovernment on the same terms and conditions as those of the \nADB loan. The end-borrowers will assume the foreign exchange \nand interest rate variation risks of the ADB loan. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  XUARG is the executing agency for the Project. A project leading \nArrangements  group (PLG) has been established to provide overall guidance \n ", "iv   \nand support to the preparation and implementation of the Project. \nA  Xinjiang  project  management  office  (PMO)  has  been \nestablished under the PLG to undertake and manage the day-to-\nday activities in connection with the Project. In each project city \nand area, a PLG and a PMO have been set up to liaise with the \nXinjiang PMO and to oversee and manage (i) the work undertaken \nby the implementing agencies, (ii) overall management of project \nfinance, and (iii) project implementation. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region government \n   \nProcurement  Goods, works, and services will be procured in accordance with \nADB's  guidelines  and  procedures.  International  competitive \nbidding, national competitive bidding, or shopping procedures will \nbe used for procurement, based on the circumstances of each \ncontract package. \n   \nConsulting Services  About 25 person-months of international consulting services and \n80 person-months of national consulting services will be provided \nto  support  the  PMOs  and  implementing  agencies  in  project \nimplementation,  and  in  management  and  institutional  capacity \nbuilding.  The  consultancy  services  will  cover  (i)  project \npreparation  and  management,  (ii)  the  project  performance \nmanagement system, (iii) transport planning and traffic control for \nYining  City,  (iv) financial  management,  (v)  social  development, \n(vi) environmental management, (vii) operation and maintenance, \nand (vii) institutional strengthening. Consultants will be recruited \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time). \n   \nProject Benefits and  Xinjiang is a low-income region, especially when compared with \nBeneficiaries  the coastal provinces. Within Xinjiang, Yining (home to 93% of all \nproject beneficiaries) is a low-income area with a mean per capita \nincome less than half that of the Xinjiang urban average. The \nProject will benefit about 471,400 people, 10% of whom are poor. \nMajor  socioeconomic  impacts  include  (i)  improvement  of  living \nstandards through the provision of essential public infrastructure, \n(ii) improvement  of  public  health  through  infrastructure  and \nenvironmental improvement, (iii) improvement of the quality and \naffordability of basic services, and (iv) significant job creation.  \n \nAbout  24%  of  the  beneficiaries  in  Alashankou  will  be  ethnic \nminorities; in Kanas the figure is 97%, and in Yining 82%. All \nhouseholds will be able to afford ongoing utility bills for the new or \nextended  services  (given  that  subsidies  exist  for  poor \nhouseholds),  but,  significantly,  switching  to  district  heating  will \nsave each household up to CNY45 ($6) each month. There will be \napproximately 2,180 full person-years of work (or about 4,718 full-\ntime  jobs)  over  the  construction  period.  Multiplier  effects  are \nexpected to create 7,549 additional full-time jobs. Three quarters \nof the construction jobs are assumed to be unskilled jobs and are \nlikely to be filled by currently unemployed persons. This translates \ninto CNY32.4 million ($4.35 million) of project costs that will return \nto the northwest Xinjiang economy. Operation and maintenance ", "    v \n(O&M) will create 572 additional full-time permanent jobs directly \nand 915 further jobs through multiplier effects, effectively directing \nabout CNY4 million ($0.54 million) per year in wages into the \nnorthwest Xinjiang economy. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks. \nConventional engineering designs with proven records of reliable \nperformance  will  be  adopted  for  (i)  road  construction,  (ii) \ninstallation of municipal services along roads, (iii) water supply \nand  wastewater  management,  (iv)  solid  waste  treatment,  (v) \nenvironmental sanitation, (vi) heating, (vii) landscaping, and (viii) \necological protective planting. During implementation, the project \nimplementation  consultant  will  support  the  PMOs  and \nimplementing  agencies  to  ensure  that  equipment  and  works \ncomply with the design requirements and quality assurances. \n \nThe  following  risks  could  affect  the  timely  implementation, \neconomic viability, and realization of benefits of the Project: (i) \nfailure to implement institutional strengthening for effective project \nimplementation  and  management;  (ii)  lack  of  proper  O&M  of \nproject  facilities;  (iii)  major  amendments  and  changes  to  the \nmaster  plans  in  the  project  cities  and/or  areas;  (iv)  delay  in \ncompletion of related projects such as the ring roads in Kanas and \nthe raw water source in Alashankou; (v) delay in the provision of \ncounterpart  funding;  (vi)  failure  to  establish  or  increase  water, \nwastewater,  and  heating  tariffs  in  Alashankou  to  meet  cost-\nrecovery  targets;  and  (vii)  unforeseen  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  issues  which  could  hamper  the  efficient \nimplementation  of  the  project  works  and  the  restoration  of \nlivelihoods of affected persons. \n \nRisks (i) and (ii) will be mitigated through provision of institutional \ncapacity building for the Xinjiang and city PMOs and implementing \nagencies with support from the loan implementation consultant. \nRisks  (iii)  and  (iv)  will  be  mitigated  by  synchronization  of  the \nproject design and implementation schedules with other planned \nprojects. The three project governments have provided specific \nloan  assurances  that  are  covenanted  in  the  Loan  Agreement. \nRisks  (v)  and  (vi)  will  be  mitigated  through  covenanted \nassurances from the three project governments on the provision \nof  counterpart  funding  and  from  the  Boertala  Mongolian \nAutonomous Prefecture government on regular tariff reviews and \nincreases. Risk (vii) will be mitigated by strengthening of internal \nmonitoring and supervision by the Xinjiang and city PMOs and the \nimplementing  agencies,  and  by  engagement  of  a  qualified \nexternal agency to monitor and evaluate resettlement. \n ", "     ", "     \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Xinjiang Municipal Infrastructure and Environmental \nImprovement Project. \n \n2.  The Government asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help improve municipal \ninfrastructure and the environment in Alashankou land port, Kanas scenic region, and Yining City \nin Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang) by (i) improving the existing road infrastructure \nand expanding roads and utility services into new development areas of Yining; (ii) developing new \nand upgrading existing infrastructure services in Alashankou; and (iii) providing water supply, \nsanitation, solid waste management, and road network infrastructure in Kanas. This report is based \non the results of the loan appraisal mission, as well as discussions with the central and local \ngovernments and community organizations. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. The problems and objectives tree analyses are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  The PRC has experienced significant economic progress since the Government initiated a \nseries of economic and social reforms in 1978. Rapid industrialization and urbanization have seen \nthe economy grow faster than in most other parts in the world, averaging more than 9% annually \nsince 1978 and over 10% annually during the period 2001\u20132006. Policies to open the country to \ninternational trade and investment have made the PRC one of the world's most open economies. \nGross domestic product (GDP) in 2006 was CNY20,940 billion ($2,785 billion), compared with \nCNY362.4 billion ($48.2 billion) in 1978. Per capita GDP in 2006 was CNY15,930 ($2,118). The \ncountry has reached the Millennium Development Goal of cutting the 1990 poverty rate by half and \nis on track to reach most of the other Millennium Development Goals.1 However, the western \nregion of the PRC, which is home to many of the country\u2019s poor and ethnic minorities, has not \nbenefited as much as the coastal regions from rapid economic growth and reforms.2 The western \nregion accounts for 71.5% of the country\u2019s total area and contains more than half of its natural \nresources  but  has  only  27.5%  of  the  country\u2019s  population  and  18.8%  of  the  country\u2019s  total \neconomic output as of 2006. About 50.8% of the 23.65 million poor people in the PRC live in this \nregion. \n \n4.  In 1999, the Government launched the western region development strategy, aimed at \npromoting balanced economic growth, stimulating economic development, and raising the living \nstandard of the population in the western region. While growth has quickened recently, the western \nregion still lags behind the coastal region. In 2005, the GDP per capita of the western region was \nonly 60% of the national average, and disposable income per capita was only 84% of the national \naverage. The provision of roads and municipal infrastructure and services has not kept pace with \nincreasing  demand,  and  this  hinders  outside  investment,  contributes  to  poor  environmental \nconditions, and limits opportunities to promote growth. \n \n5.  Despite massive investments in road infrastructure, the inadequate transportation and road \nnetwork still constitutes a major obstacle to production and consumption activities, domestic and \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2005. China's Progress Towards the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Beijing. By 2006, the number of poor people below the government's poverty line had fallen by \nabout 230 million to 21.5 million, or 2.3% of the rural population, and the number living on less than $1 per day had \nfallen by about 350 million to around 105 million, or about 10% of the rural population. \n2  The PRC\u2019s western region covers six provinces, five autonomous regions (including the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous \nRegion), and one municipality (Chongqing). ", "2   \ninternational trade, and sustainable economic growth in the western region. In 2005, the total road \nnetwork in the PRC reached 1.93 million kilometers (km), of which 0.78 million km were in the \nwestern region. Given increased incomes and prosperity and reduced tariffs on vehicles following \nthe PRC\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization, car ownership, which reached 21 vehicles \nper 1,000 people nationwide in 2005, is likely to continue its rapid increase. Rapid growth in vehicle \nnumbers  and  passenger  transport  has  put  increasing  pressure  on  the  road  network,  which \nnecessitates capacity expansion, transport planning, and improved road and traffic management. \nThese are all major areas of the Government\u2019s policy to ensure sustainable development while \nprotecting the environment. \n \n6.  Rapid urbanization and industrialization in the PRC have come at a high environmental cost. \nThe PRC\u2019s urban population has more than tripled from 190 million in 1980 to 577 million in 2006, \naccounting for 43.9% of the national population, and is expected to reach 47.0% by 2010. Many \ncities face environmental threats from pollution of surface and subsurface waters from untreated \nwastewater and solid waste. As of 2006, about 56% of urban wastewater was treated and the rest \nwas  discharged  untreated.3 The  Government\u2019s  latest  agenda  for  economic  reform  and  social \ndevelopment aims to (i) accelerate urbanization and the development of large, medium, and small \ncities and towns; and (ii) protect the environment by reducing air pollution by 20% and increasing \nwastewater treatment coverage to 70% by 2010. The growing urban population, industrialization, \nand  economic  development  will  continue  to  increase  the  demand  for  infrastructure  services, \nincluding roads, water supply, wastewater, and sanitation, which will severely strain the physical \nand financial capacity of most cities, particularly those in the western region. In the PRC\u2019s Eleventh \nFive-Year Plan (11FYP, 2006\u20132010), the Government has given priority to inclusive and balanced \nregional  development,  and  has  prioritized  addressing  environmental  protection  and  pollution \ncontrol  issues  through  policy  reform,  increased  investment,  and  improved  infrastructure \nmanagement, recognizing that these are essential for sustainable economic growth. Appendix 2 \nprovides a sector analysis. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  Project Background. The western region development policy continues to be a major \nthrust of the Government\u2019s 11FYP. The main focus is on (i) improving border port facilities, (ii) \nstrengthening  economic  cooperation  and  trade  with  neighboring  countries,  (iii)  improving \ninfrastructure  development,  and  (iv)  protecting  the  environment  and  encouraging  private \ninvestment.  ADB  is  actively  supporting  the  Government  development  initiative  and  has \nrecommended that, among other things, the western region development strategy should focus on \naccelerating  infrastructure  development  (transportation,  communications,  power,  and  water \nresources) and environmental management to lay a foundation for development.4  \n \n8.  Xinjiang covers 1.665 million square kilometers, about one sixth of the total area of the PRC \nand is the largest of its provinces and autonomous regions. It has a relatively small population of \nabout 20 million (about 1.5% of the population of the PRC), of whom about 38.0% are Han \nChinese and the rest are from 46 ethnic minority groups, the largest of which is the Uygur, \naccounting for 47.0%. Xinjiang shares 5,600 km of border with eight countries and is the gateway \nbetween  the  PRC  and  the  Central  Asian  republics  (CARs),5 with  which  it  has  many  cultural \n                                                 \n3  Ministry of Construction, PRC.

The PRC will receive from ADB $3 billion\u2013$4.5 billion of loans \nduring the period 2007\u20132009, more than 90% of which will be allocated to the central and western regions, with the top \nthree priorities being transport, municipal infrastructure, and environmental protection.  \n5  Xinjiang shares borders with Afghanistan, India, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, the Russian \nFederation, and Tajikistan. The Second Eurasia Continental Bridge railway line connects Rotterdam in western Europe \nto Lianyungang in East Asia, via Alashankou in Xinjiang. ", "    3 \nsimilarities and economic complementarities. As the historic Silk Road passes through it, Xinjiang \nhas a wealth of history and ethnic culture, and this has encouraged tourism development. It is also \nrich in natural resources including oil, metals, minerals, and products with low factor costs for labor \nand land, which provide a sound basis for development. While economic development has been \nrapid (with an annual growth rate of 9.8% in the last 5 years), Xinjiang remains one of the poorest \nand most remote parts of the country. Of its 22 cities and 68 counties, 27 are categorized as \nnational poverty cities or counties. In 2006, about 8.4% of Xinjiang\u2019s urban population had incomes \nbelow the official poverty line; this compares with the national average poverty incidence of 4.0%. \nFor the rural population the figure in 2006 was 10.0%, compared with the national average of \n3.2%.6 In 2005, Xinjiang\u2019s per capita disposable income of urban households was CNY7,990 \n($1,044), the lowest among the PRC\u2019s autonomous regions and provinces, 24.0% below the \nnational average, and 57.0% below that of Shanghai. The main factors which limit the economy are \n(i) the vast distances that separate Xinjiang from major markets, and (ii) inadequate and outdated \ninfrastructure facilities\u2014especially roads, water supply, and sanitation\u2014that cannot satisfy the \npresent demand and support potential growth. \n \n9.  The urban population in Xinjiang, which accounted for 37% of the total population in 2005, \nis expected to increase to 42% by 2010 and to 47% by 2015. Between 1995 and 2005, paved \nroads in urban areas in Xinjiang increased 60%, from 2,403 km to 3,849 km. This can barely cope \nwith the growth in vehicle and passenger transport. In the same period, the number of public \nvehicles for business transportation increased by 127%, from 3,324 to 7,553, and the number of \npassenger trips increased by 41%, from 1.831 million to 2.583 million person-times per day. \nVehicle  ownership  reached  33  vehicles  per  1,000  people.  Other  environment  infrastructure \nservices are also facing problems associated with growing demand. In 2005, 634 million cubic \nmeters of wastewater were discharged, 68% of which comes from municipal sources and 32% \nfrom industrial sources. Of these discharges, 59.3% of the industrial wastewater met the discharge \nstandards, and 55.3% of the municipal wastewater was treated, while the balance either did not \nmeet established standards or was untreated. In 2005, 3.44 million tons of garbage were collected \nand  disposed  of;  36%  of  this  waste  was  treated  in  nine  sanitary  landfill  sites.7 Significant \ninvestments  are  needed  to  expand  the  infrastructure  facilities  and  improve  environmental \nmanagement to ensure sustainable economic growth and raise the living standards of the poor \npeople in Xinjiang, particularly those in the border areas. \n \n10.  The Project covers three border cities and areas\u2014Alashankou land port, Kanas scenic \nregion, and Yining City\u2014which are fast-growing economic and tourism hubs in the northwestern \npart of Xinjiang. The present transport infrastructure and services cannot meet the increasing traffic \nand  utility  service  demands  in  these  areas.  The  incomplete  road  networks,  low  standard  of \ntransport infrastructure, and poor management and maintenance, all contribute to increasing traffic \ncongestion and accidents. Utility services do not exist or are old, fragile, and inadequate, resulting \nin poor standards and frequent failure of services. The investment needs far exceed the budget \nallocations of the local governments on capital investment and operation and maintenance (O&M) \nof these services. \n \n11.  Income from tourism in the PRC is expected to grow by 12% per annum in the 11FYP \nperiod. In Xinjiang, from 2000 to 2005, the annual number of tourists increased from 7.8 million to \n15.0 million, and the earnings from tourism increased from $0.9 billion to $1.8 billion. The growth in \ntourism in Xinjiang has contributed to economic development in its poorer areas. For example, in \n                                                 \n6  The national average official poverty lines for urban dwellers in 2005 was CNY1,860 per year, and for the rural \npopulation it was CNY683 per person per year; both these figures are lower than the international standard of $1 per \nperson per day. \n7  Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. 2005. Cities and Counties Construction Statistics Annual Report. Xinjiang; \nStatistical  Bureau  of  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region.  2006.  Xinjiang  Statistical  Yearbook.  Xinjiang:  China \nStatistics Press. \n ", "4   \n2005 the earnings from tourism in Altay Administrative District (where Kanas is located) were about \n$0.11 billion, 14% of the gross regional product of $0.76 billion. There will be barriers to further \ngrowth and damage to the currently clean environment if proper environmental infrastructure is not \nput in place. \n \n12.  The Alashankou land port, established in 1995, has a population of 29,000. It is the only \nland port in the western region with cross-border road and rail links as well as pipelines for \npetroleum products. Its link with Dostyk in Kazakhstan is part of the Second Eurasia Continental \nBridge railway line and the major trade route carrying materials and products between Xinjiang and \nindustrial and agricultural consumers and producers both within and outside of the PRC. In 2005, \nits total imports and exports reached $6.8 billion, the largest in Xinjiang (comprising over 90% of \nthe total for Xinjiang) and second largest in the PRC. Major export items are manufactured goods \nsuch as shoes and TV sets, while major import items are natural resources such as crude oil and \nrolled steel. The PRC signed a cross-border transportation agreement with Kazakhstan in 2005 to \nfacilitate cross-border trade. Import and export activities at the land port are increasing at 25% per \nyear.  To  ensure  the  land  port\u2019s  sustainable  growth,  and  in  order  to  overcome  major  trade \nfacilitation and development constraints due to inadequate infrastructure, the Project will include \nconstruction and upgrading of roads, water supply, and heating infrastructure and the provision of \nnew wastewater and solid waste treatment and management facilities. It will also include planting \nand irrigation of forests for ecological protection in a very harsh, dry, and windy semidesert climate. \nThis will also improve the economy of nearby border areas, which are generally underdeveloped, \nby benefiting the processing, tertiary, and agricultural sectors. \n \n13.  The Kanas scenic region is in the northern tip of Xinjiang, which borders Kazakhstan, the \nRussian Federation, and Mongolia. It is a nationally designated top-ranking tourist destination, \ncovers seven villages, and has a total population of about 4,400. Roads in the villages are in poor \ncondition and inaccessible for at least 7 months of the year, essentially isolating the residents. The \nrecent rapid increase in tourist numbers has led to rapid development of the region. Wastewater \nand refuse have polluted some of the pastures, rivers, and lakes. The project component, located \nin four villages, is needed in order to (i) improve the infrastructure and services to meet the \nresidents\u2019 basic needs and accessibility within the villages, and (ii) support sustainable economic \ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction  in  Kanas  through  tourism  development  while  ensuring  proper \nmanagement and protection of the environment.8 International tourism experts estimate that the \nmultiplier effect of the tourism industry in developing countries with abundant tourism resources \nresults in a ratio of indirect to direct economic benefits of about 4:3. \n \n14.  Yining City, with a population of 438,000, is located in the northwest of Xinjiang and is an \nimportant trade hub between the PRC and Central Asia. Upgrading of the road network is needed \nto support growth. Traffic management and road safety measures\u2014such as the segregation of \npedestrians  and  vehicles\u2014need  to  be  improved.  The  Project  includes  the  construction  and \nupgrading of both arterial roads and urban alleys to serve the needs of residents, improve air \nquality, and reduce accident rates. It will also provide associated infrastructure including water \nsupply, wastewater treatment, heating, telecommunications, and other municipal services under \nthe roads. \n \n15.  Project Rationale. Given Xinjiang\u2019s location and abundance in resources, the Xinjiang \nUygur Autonomous Region government (XUARG) focuses its development strategy on its potential \nrole  in  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Program.  ADB  has  been \nsupporting  regional  trade  facilitation  through  the  CAREC  Program  since  the  late  1990s. 9 \nAssistance  has  focused  on  regional  customs  cooperation,  customs  modernization,  trade \n                                                 \n8  The four villages are Baihaba (also referred to as North Akehaba and South Akehaba), Hemu, Kanas, and Tiereketi. \n9  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Logistics Development and Capacity Building \nin Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Manila. ", "    5 \nfacilitation, and infrastructure development, where a number of regional technical assistance (TA) \nprojects and loans in various countries are currently being implemented. ADB is working with other \ndevelopment partners to advance cross-border facilitation between the CARs. All the member \ncountries agreed on a CAREC action plan in 2006 at the CAREC Ministerial Conference in Urumqi \nand there is a timeline to implement the action plan. ADB is preparing a transport and trade \nfacilitation strategy for CAREC to combine transport infrastructure investment and management \nwith trade and transport facilitation initiatives. \n \n16.  Xinjiang\u2019s foreign trade has grown rapidly, especially since the CARs became independent \nin 1992. It has increased more than fourfold (an annual average growth rate of 28.5%) from $1.77 \nbillion in 2001 to $7.94 billion (exports of $5.04 billion and imports of $2.90 billion), or 24.3% of \nGDP, in 2005, the highest among the PRC\u2019s border provinces and regions. To maximize strong \ngrowth potential and raise the living standard of the people, in particular the ethnic minorities, the \nXUARG in its 11FYP accorded high priority to sustainable economic development, particularly in \nborder  cities  and  areas  with  tourism  potential,  through  construction  and  upgrading  of  the \ninfrastructure, while at the same time protecting the environment. This Project, and the recently \napproved Xinjiang Regional Road Development Project (Korla\u2013Kuqa Section) and the Xinjiang \nUrban Transport and Environmental Improvement Project that is currently under preparation, fully \nsupport  XUARG\u2019s  development  objectives  and  the  CAREC  transport  and  trade  facilitation \nstrategy.10 \n \n17.  Improvement of the road network and the strengthening of environmental protection and \nmanagement is crucial to achieving and sustaining inclusive growth in Xinjiang\u2019s border cities and \nareas. An efficient, safe, and environmentally sustainable road network, together with improved \npublic utility and environmental infrastructure, is needed to (i) cope with the increasing demand as \na result of cross-border trade growth, industrial development, and urbanization; and (ii) benefit the \npoor and ethnic minorities. Road and environmental infrastructure is also urgently needed in the \nKanas villages, which are lacking these facilities. Institutional strengthening of transport planning, \ntraffic management, municipal infrastructure, O&M, and environmental management is included in \nthe project design. \n \n18.  The  Project  is  designed  to  remove  infrastructure  constraints,  address  environmental \nconcerns, and promote sustainable economic growth in three of Xinjiang\u2019s border cities and areas, \nand is consistent with the PRC\u2019s development priorities for the poor western region. The provision \nof improved or new infrastructure facilities in Alashankou land port will support the development of \nthis small town into a larger land port with environmentally sustainable infrastructure services that \nwill facilitate the rapidly growing cross-border trade and create favorable conditions for trade-\nrelated investment. The Project will also support tourism development, especially in Kanas and \nYining, to promote economic growth and reduce poverty, while protecting the environment. Thus it \nwill have a demonstration effect for other similar border cities and land ports and areas with tourism \npotential on how to plan and manage sustainable infrastructure development, while protecting the \nenvironment. The Project supports ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, which aims to \nstrengthen inclusiveness, manage the environment, promote regional cooperation and integration, \ncatalyze investment, and improve governance, and also supports ADB\u2019s CAREC strategy. It is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  urban  sector  strategy  and  water  policy,  which  support  infrastructure \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Xinjiang Regional Road Improvement Project (Korla\u2013Kuqa Section). Manila (Loan \n2393); ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Xinjiang Urban Transport \nand  Environmental  Improvement  Project.  Manila  (TA  4930).  The  Xinjiang  Urban  Transport  and  Environmental \nImprovement Project that is currently under preparation covers five cities that were originally proposed as part of the \nProject. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region government agreed to split the original proposal into two to reduce \nthe number of components and the complexity of the projects. \n ", "6   \ninvestment in settlements that are dynamic engines of economic growth and employment creation, \ninnovation, and entrepreneurship, and are sources of social services. \n \n19.  Policy  Dialogue.  The  Project  will  build  on  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  on  (i) sustainable \neconomic growth and environmental management; (ii) regional cooperation in trade facilitation; (iii) \nintegrated urban transport planning; (iv) effective traffic management and road safety; and (v) \ninstitutional  development  of  the  project  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  including \nstrengthening governance and supporting public utility tariff reforms. Supplementary Appendix B \nprovides more policy dialogue detail. \n \n20.  To achieve long-term sustainable growth XUARG recognizes the need to balance economic \ndevelopment  and  social  and  environmental  concerns.  The  Project  will  introduce  measures  to \nprevent and control pollution through proper environmental planning and management and ensure \nenvironmentally sustainable economic growth. Most of Xinjiang suffers from water shortages and \noverexploitation of surface water and groundwater, and the reuse of treated effluent would help to \nprotect scarce water resources. The treated effluent should reach a discharge standard suitable for \nirrigation or industrial cooling and heating. This has been incorporated into the design of the \nAlashankou component. The Government of the PRC is actively promoting a recycling economy, \nwhich is supported under the Project through waste sorting and recycling in order to minimize \nmunicipal solid waste and extend the operational life of landfills. The Project will include education \nprograms on waste recycling and provide suitable recycling bins and facilities for residents and \ntourists in Kanas. \n \n21.  The western region lacks adequate transport infrastructure and trade logistics industries. \nGrowth  of  trade  between  Xinjiang  and  the  CARs  is  promoting  economic  diversification  and \nassisting enterprises, but a major obstacle to further growth is the high cost of trade across \nregions. In addition to improvement of the transport infrastructure, and in order to reduce transport \ntime and costs along the CAREC trade transport corridors, CAREC partners will need to focus on \npriority  transport  corridors,  logistics  improvement,  and  cross-border  harmonization.  The \nAlashankou component will support the CAREC program and the transport and trade facilitation \nstrategy through improved road infrastructure which will strengthen cross-border trade in the border \ncities and areas of Xinjiang. \n \n22.  Sustainable transport planning and policy reforms are crucial to ensure that the Project will \nbring added value and that the benefits will be passed on to road users. Urban transport planning \nmust take into account the links between land use, accessibility, transport services, social and \npoverty aspects, road accidents, road maintenance, and interagency cooperation. The master plan \nfor each of the project cities and areas is being updated to meet the needs of a growing economy. \nXUARG and the project city and area governments recognize that integration of urban planning \nand transport planning is important. The Project will assist Yining in strengthening its capacity to \nupdate and improve its urban development planning and transport master planning. \n \n23.  Traffic management issues include (i) increased number and severity of road accidents, (ii) \nconflict between pedestrians and motorists, (iii) nonmotorized transport operations, and (iv) public \ntransport efficiency. Road safety is a problem in the PRC and insufficient roads and inefficient \ntraffic management are the main causes. Poor traffic management also has health, environmental, \nand social consequences, and significant implications for national economic growth. The Project \nwill introduce appropriate road safety strategies in the project cities and areas, including (i) traffic \nengineering considerations in road design (focusing on existing major accident areas), (ii) traffic \nmanagement (focusing on signage and appropriate use of traffic signal controls), (iii) raising of \ngreater community and industry awareness in road safety, and (iv) dissemination of road safety \nknowledge. Reduction in the frequency, severity, and cost of road accidents will particularly benefit \nlow-income people\u2014including pedestrians, public bus users, and bicycle riders\u2014and increase the \neconomic benefit of the investment. The Project will improve the road surfaces and introduce traffic ", "    7 \nmanagement measures, specifically in Alashankou and Yining, to aid efficient energy consumption \nand minimize pollution. \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s municipal infrastructure projects emphasize the importance of capacity building to \nincrease organizational capability to ensure that (i) the project components are designed and \nconstructed in a cost-effective manner and are implemented in compliance with environmental and \nsocial safeguards, (ii) O&M procedures are in place to enable the completed facilities to perform as \ndesigned, (iii) there are adequate funding mechanisms for effective O&M so that project benefits \ncan be sustained in the long term, and (iv) there is overall improvement in the organizational \nperformance  in  the  delivery  of  municipal  and  environmental  protection  services.  Institutional \ndevelopment is important for the Project because (i) Xinjiang and the project cities and areas have \nno  experience  in  ADB  projects,  and  (ii)  the  Project  involves  a  variety  of  works  in  dispersed \nlocations involving many levels of personnel. The institutional development measures under the \nProject  have  taken  these  factors  into  consideration.  During  preparation  of  the  Project,  ADB \nprovided pre-project implementation training on ADB procedures and guidelines to XUARG and the \nimplementing agencies. ADB will provide further capacity-building measures during initial project \nimplementation.11 \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s  infrastructure  projects  support  various  aspects  of  corporate  governance  reform, \nincluding (i) structuring the enterprises along commercial lines and assisting in preparing business \nplans where feasible, (ii) strengthening the operations of the boards of directors of the enterprises, \nand  accountability  through  supervisory  boards,  (iii)  implementing  external  and  internal  audit \narrangements,  and  (iv)  improving  cost  recovery  through  tariff  reforms.  ADB  has  undertaken \nextensive dialogue with XUARG and the implementing agencies on lessons learned and training \nprovided on tariff reforms in other ADB-financed projects and the benefits of achieving financial \nsustainability for the agencies and utilities providing municipal services. XUARG has agreed to \nstrengthen tariff reforms, and the Project will provide the necessary support through capacity \ndevelopment.  XUARG  has  agreed  to  use  accounting  systems  that  accord  with  international \npractice  for  the  Project.  For  government  agencies  implementing  the  nonrevenue-earning \nsubcomponents,  the  Project  will  help  to  improve  governance  through  (i)  strengthening \norganizational structures to improve delivery of municipal services, (ii) supervising and monitoring, \nand (iii) effectively allocating resources for implementing and operating municipal infrastructure. \n \n26.  External Assistance. Since 1992, ADB has provided more than 20 loans totaling nearly \n$2.8 billion to the PRC for municipal infrastructure and environmental improvement projects. ADB \nhas also provided nearly $50 million for more than 70 TA studies to prepare these projects and to \nreview and study key issues in municipal transport, water resources, water supply, wastewater \ntreatment, and pollution control. ADB is providing a number of TA projects to the Government on \ndevelopment in the western region to facilitate regional cooperation with Central Asia (footnotes 4, \n9,  and  10).  External  assistance  to  Xinjiang  for  implementing  its  municipal  infrastructure  and \nenvironmental  improvement  has  been  provided  by  the  World  Bank  (Tarim  Basin  Water \nConservancy  and  Agriculture  Support,  Kuitun  to  Syimlake  Expressway,  and  Urumqi  Urban \nTransportation Improvement), the Government of Japan and Japanese banks (Xinjiang Cities \nIntegrated  Environment  Management,  Urumqi  Hetan  Road,  and  Yining  City  Integrated \nEnvironment  Management),  the  Saudi  Arabian  Development  Bank  (Aksu  City  Integrated \nEnvironment Management), the Government of the Republic of Korea (Korla Outer Ring Road), \nand several European governments. Appendix 3 provides details of the external assistance. \n \n27.  Lessons  Learned.  Lessons  learned  from  the  ADB-financed  and  World  Bank-financed \nurban transport projects highlight the importance of (i) a comprehensive and participatory approach \nto  project  preparation;  (ii)  a  planned  and  well-coordinated  resettlement  scheme  preceded  by \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2007.

These lessons have been taken \ninto consideration in the project design. \n \n28.  Lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  urban  development,  water  supply,  and \nsanitation projects include that (i) strategic master plans can play an important role in providing a \ncomprehensive framework for urban development and environmental management; (ii) increased \npublic  awareness  and  education  are  important  ways  to  improve  the  urban  environment  and \ntherefore public consultation and involvement and awareness training on environmental health and \nprotection should be provided for; (iii) the establishment of an effective internal and external \nmonitoring  mechanism  for  resettlement  implementation  is  important  to  ensure  effective \ncoordination  and  timely  implementation  of  land  approval,  compensation,  and  rehabilitation \nmeasures;  and  (iv)  financial  reforms,  in  particular  tariff  increases,  are  important  to  ensure \nsustainability and promote delivery of services in an efficient and responsive manner. These issues \nhave been reviewed during project processing and the relevant lessons have been incorporated \ninto the project design. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n29.  The impact of the Project is sustained socioeconomic growth and improved living standards \nin the border areas of north Xinjiang (Altay Administrative District, Boertala Mongolian Autonomous \nPrefecture  [BMAP],  and  Yili  Kazak  Autonomous  Prefecture).  The  outcome  of  the  Project  is \nimproved municipal infrastructure and a better living and ecological environment in Alashankou \nland port, Kanas scenic region, and Yining City. \n \nB.  Outputs \n30.  The  Project  has  three  components  broken  down  into  13  subcomponents.  The  three \ncomponents are (i) Yining City roads and municipal services (component I), (ii) Alashankou land \nport municipal infrastructure and environmental protection (component II), and (iii) Kanas scenic \nregion infrastructure and environmental protection (component III). The Yining component seeks to \nimprove the existing road infrastructure to assist commercial access to cross-border trade, improve \nurban living conditions, and expand roads and utility services into new development areas of the \ncity in order to support industrial activity, improve the local economy, and increase employment. \nThe  Alashankou  component  will  develop  new  and  upgrade  existing  infrastructure  services  to \nimprove basic living conditions, encourage expansion of cross-border trade, expand the local \neconomy, and protect the local environment from pollution. The Kanas component will provide new \nwater supply, sanitation, solid waste management, and road network infrastructure in order to \ndevelop  its  local  economy  and  tourism,  improve  the  living  conditions  and  health  of  ethnic \nminorities, and protect the environment.12 A summary description of the project components and \nsubcomponents follows. (Supplementary Appendixes C, D, and E provide technical details of the \ncomponents.) \n \n31.  Component I (Yining City roads and municipal services) includes (i) construction of four \nmain roads, reconstruction of 33 local roads, and improvement of associated infrastructure (water \nsupply, wastewater treatment, heating, telecommunications, and other municipal services); and \n                                                 \n12 The area includes a national top-ranked tourist destination. ", "    9 \n(ii) construction  and  installation  of  environmental  sanitation  facilities  (public  toilets,  garbage \ncollection stations, garbage collection containers, garbage trucks, street cleaning trucks, and snow \nclearing trucks). \n \n32.  Component II (Alashankou land port municipal infrastructure and environmental protection) \ncomprises (i) construction of 13 new roads and reconstruction of six existing roads, (ii) construction \nof a 60,000 cubic meters per day (m3/day) water treatment plant and associated raw water pipeline \nand water distribution pipelines, (iii) construction of a 21,000 m3/day wastewater treatment plant \nand associated effluent storage tank and collection pipeline, (iv) construction of heating stations \nand heating pipelines, (v) construction and installation of environmental sanitation and solid waste \ntreatment facilities (public toilets, garbage collection points, dustbins, garbage trucks, and a solid \nwaste landfill site), and (vi) planting and irrigation of ecological protective forests. \n \n33.  Component III (Kanas scenic region infrastructure and environmental protection) includes \n(i) construction of village roads and village parking areas, (ii) construction of a 300 m3/day water \nsupply system and associated connection and distribution pipelines, (iii) construction of a 200 \nm3/day  wastewater  treatment  system  and  associated  connection  and  collection  pipelines,  (iv) \nconstruction and installation of environmental sanitation and solid waste treatment facilities (public \ntoilets, garbage collection stations, dustbins, garbage trucks, and a solid waste landfill site), and \n(v) rehabilitation of vegetation along roadsides. \n \n34.  The Project also provides for institutional development and capacity building to ensure \neffective implementation of the Project and sustainable O&M of the project facilities. The capacity \nbuilding  will  include  project  management  consulting  services  and  training  during  loan \nimplementation  (para.  24).  This  will  help  the  implementing  agencies  to  (i)  become  efficient, \nfinancially sustainable entities; (ii) comply with relevant national policies for cost recovery, tariff, \nand enterprise reforms; (iii) develop sound O&M plans for future service provision; (iv) develop a \npublic awareness training program on environmental protection and social impact monitoring; and \n(v) improve the efficiency of traffic management. \n \nC.  Special Features \n35.  Support for a Remote and Poor Region. The Project is the first ADB-financed municipal \ninfrastructure development and environmental management project in Xinjiang, which is one of the \npoorest  and  most  remote  regions  in  the  PRC.  It  will  support  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction and facilitate regional trade between the PRC and the CARs, and this will raise the living \nstandards and improve the environment. It covers a range of settlements\u2014a medium-sized city, a \nsmall but rapidly expanding land port, and four villages in a fast-growing tourist attraction area\u2014\nand is aimed to serve as a pilot for similar activities in other cities and areas in Xinjiang. \n \n36.  Proactive Approach to Environmental Management. The Project will support XUARG in \npioneering  environmental  protection  planning  and  related  investments  before  rapid  economic \ngrowth and environmental degradation occur. This will ensure that the environment in one of the \nmost pristine regions of the PRC is protected. The aim is to avoid the pollution problems currently \nbeing faced by rapidly growing cities in the coastal provinces and the consequent significant \nnegative impacts on the economy, environment, and health of the population. The Alashankou \ncomponent will support water resource conservation through reuse of treated effluent for irrigation \nin a semidesert area. \n \n37.  Traffic  Planning  and  Management.  In  addition  to  improvement  of  the  existing  road \nnetwork and accessibility, the Yining component will improve city traffic management, including (i) \ntraffic planning and traffic control development, and (ii) a traffic management scheme focusing on \nsignage and traffic signals to improve traffic flow and road safety for vehicles and pedestrians. \n ", "10   \n38.

The Project will also be complemented by a grant \n($150,000), financed by the Gender and Development Fund, for the Kanas Women\u2019s Enterprise \nDevelopment  Project  (Appendix  4).  It  aims  to  support  capacity  building  in  local  tourism  and \ndemonstration projects in health and hygiene for ethnic minority women in the Kanas component of \nthe Project. The objectives of the grant are to (i) build local participation in the growing cultural \ntourism  opportunities  emerging  in  Kanas,  (ii)  support  small-scale  infrastructure  to  assist  in \nmarketing and storage of local products, and (iii) increase public participation in accessing the \nbenefits of health and hygiene infrastructure improvements provided by the Project. The Kanas \nproject management office (PMO) and implementing agency will implement and manage the grant \nproject.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n39.  The project investment cost is estimated at $190.9 million, including taxes and duties of \n$25.2 million.

Financing Plan \n40.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $105.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to finance 55% of the cost of the Project. The loan will cover (i) civil works, (ii) equipment \nand supplies, (iii) project consulting services and training, and (iv) financial charges on the loan \nduring construction. The Government will finance contingencies. The Altay Prefecture government, ", "    11 \nBMAP government, and Yining municipal government will provide counterpart funding through tax \nand nontax revenues, for which they have provided commitment letters to XUARG and ADB. The \nfinancing plan for the Project is summarized in Table 2, with details provided in Appendix 5. \nSupplementary Appendix F provides details of the cost estimates and financing plans for each \ncomponent. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision \nto borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, \nand (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in \nreliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n41.  The borrower of the loan is the PRC. The loan will be entirely made available to XUARG. \nDifferent portions of the loan proceeds will be made available to the concerned prefecture and/or \nmunicipal governments and then to the implementing agencies. The terms and conditions of the \nloan proceeds transferred within the government system will be the same as those of the ADB loan, \nwith the concerned prefecture and/or municipal governments bearing the interest and exchange \nrate variation risk. The BMAP government will onlend its portion of the loan to the Alashankou \nLand Port Construction Company Limited (ALPCC) under an onlending agreement which will \ncontain the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan, with ALPCC bearing the interest \nand exchange rate variation risk and the applicable obligations and requirements in the Project \nAgreement.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n42.  XUARG  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  Project.  A  project  leading  group  (PLG), \ncomprising senior government officials in concerned bureaus and commissions in Xinjiang, has \nbeen established to provide overall guidance and support to the preparation and implementation of \nthe Project. A Xinjiang PMO has been established under the PLG to undertake and manage the \nday-to-day activities in connection with the Project. In each project city and area, a PLG and a \nPMO have been set up to liaise with the Xinjiang PMO and to oversee and manage (i) the work \nundertaken  by  the  implementing  agency,  (ii)  overall  project  finance,  and  (iii)  project \nimplementation. The three implementing agencies are (i) the Yining City Construction Bureau, \nundertaking the Yining City roads and municipal services component; (ii) the ALPCC, undertaking \nthe Alashankou land port municipal infrastructure and environmental protection component; and \n(iii) the Kanas Environmental Protection Construction and Transportation Bureau, undertaking the \nKanas scenic region infrastructure and environmental protection component. Appendix 7 provides \ndetails of the overall project organization. Further details of the institutional arrangement and \nassessment are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n ", "12   \n2.  Implementation Period \n43.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years from mid-2008 to mid-2013 (Appendix 8). The \nestimate of the implementation period is based on the project scope, the construction technology \nrequirements, and the climate conditions. The schedule is considered realistic and achievable \nbecause (i) the executing agency has World Bank project implementation experience, (ii) the \nproject implementation structure is in place, and (iii) preparatory works are under way. ADB\u2019s \nsuccessful  experience  with  similar  projects  in  the  PRC,  combined  with  the  knowledge  and \nexperience of XUARG in municipal infrastructure and environmental improvement projects, also \nindicates that the schedule is realistic and achievable. \n \n3.  Procurement and Consulting Services \n44.  Goods, works, and services financed under the loan will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Preliminary  contract \npackages have been formulated in consultation with the implementing agencies and a procurement \ncapacity  assessment  of  the  executing  agency,  PMOs,  and  implementing  agencies  has  been \nundertaken (Supplementary Appendix H). Contracts for goods estimated to cost $1.0 million or \nmore and contracts for works estimated to cost $10.0 million or more will be procured using \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. Contracts for goods and works estimated to cost less \nthan  the  above  international  competitive  bidding  thresholds  but  more  than  $100,000  will  be \nprocured on the basis of national competitive bidding procedures in accordance with the PRC \nTendering and Bidding Law, subject to modifications agreed to with ADB. Contracts for goods and \nworks estimated to cost $100,000 or less will be procured using shopping procedures. More details \nof the procurement plan are provided in Appendix 9. \n \n45.  The Project includes provision for funding for international and national consulting services \nto support the Xinjiang and city PMOs and implementing agencies in project implementation and \nmanagement and institutional capacity building. A consulting firm will be engaged in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) using the \nstandard quality- and cost-based selection method (80% quality and 20% cost) and simplified \ntechnical proposal. The consulting services will cover (i) support of the Xinjiang and city PMOs and \nimplementing agencies in project preparation and management, (ii) development of the project \nperformance management system (PPMS), (iii) transport planning and traffic control for Yining \nPMO  and  implementing  agency,  (iv)  financial  management,  (v)  social  development,  (vi) \nenvironmental management, (vii) O&M, and (viii) institutional strengthening. Capacity building for \nthe PMOs and implementing agencies will be achieved through consultant inputs, training courses \nprovided by universities, specialized institutes and firms, in-country and/or overseas study visits, \nand  acquisition  of  additional  equipment  financed  from  the  loan.  To  assist  the  PMOs  and \nimplementing agencies in expediting project implementation, one international project management \nand  procurement  specialist  (1  person-month)  and  one  national  project  management  and \nprocurement specialist (2 person-months) will be engaged individually prior to recruitment of the \nconsulting  firm.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix I. \n \n4.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n46.  In  view  of the  short  construction season in Xinjiang,  and  in  order to  expedite  project \nimplementation, ADB has approved XUARG\u2019s request for advance contracting for recruitment of \nconsultants, training, and procurement of goods and civil works. ADB has also approved a request \nfor retroactive financing of eligible expenditures up to $21 million (equivalent to 20% of the ADB \nloan), incurred before loan effectiveness, but not more than 12 months before the signing of the ", "    13 \nLoan  Agreement. 13  Advance  contracting  will  include  (i)  prequalification  of  contractors, \n(ii) preparation of tender documents, (iii) evaluation of bids, and (iv) recruitment of consultants. All \nadvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines.  The  issuance  of  invitations  to  bid  under  advance  contracting  and \nretroactive  financing  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  The  Government,  XUARG,  and  the \nimplementing  agencies  have  also  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  and \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n5.  Governance and Anticorruption Policy \n47.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the executing agency, PMOs, and implementing agencies. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate any \nalleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and \nthe bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection \nwith the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the \nrecords and accounts of the executing agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. XUARG has indicated its commitment to fight \ncorruption and a number of anticorruption actions have been included as covenants in the loan and \nproject agreements. Under these covenants, XUARG will \n \n(i)  involve the agencies responsible for oversight of each implementing agency in bidding \nand construction in order to monitor construction quality control and supervise effective \nwork; \n(ii)  introduce a dual-signing system in which the civil works contract winner also signs an \nanticorruption agreement with the employer; \n(iii)  periodically  inspect  the  contractors\u2019  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and \nsettlements; and \n(iv)  engage the loan implementation consultant to support the Xinjiang and city PMOs and \nthe  implementing  agencies  to  ensure  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency in project operations. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n48.  The ADB loan funds will be disbursed in accordance with the procedures in ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  expedite  project \nimplementation through timely release of loan proceeds, XUARG will establish an imprest account \npromptly after loan effectiveness at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. Withdrawal application \nwill demonstrate, among other things, that the goods and/or services have been produced in or \nfrom ADB\u2019s members, and are eligible for ADB financing. The initial amount to be deposited to the \nimprest account will not exceed ADB\u2019s estimated share of eligible project expenditures to be \nfinanced through the imprest account for the next 6 months, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever \nis lower. The statement of expenditure procedure will be used for liquidation and replenishment of \nthe  imprest  account  and  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $200,000  per \nindividual payment. The payments in excess of statement of expenditure ceiling will be reimbursed, \nliquidated,  or  replenished  based  on  full  supporting  documentation  process.  Direct  payment \nprocedures may be used for large civil works and goods contracts. Following the recommendation \nof  the  financial  management  assessment  to  improve  the  internal  control  system  of  the \nimplementing  agencies,  XUARG  will  review  and  approve  all  withdrawal  applications  prior  to \n                                                 \n13 The advance action on the procurement and recruitment of consultants, and the posting of the general procurement \nnotice on the ADB website, will facilitate the start of the advance action process. ADB management approved advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing at the management review meeting on 23 November 2007. \n ", "14   \nsubmission to ADB. The flow of ADB loan funds will be from XUARG to the concerned prefecture \nand/or municipal governments and through the city PMOs to the implementing agencies.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n49.  The Xinjiang PMO will coordinate with the city PMOs to prepare semiannual progress \nreports indicating (i) progress made, (ii) problems encountered during the period under review, (iii) \nsteps taken or proposed to remedy the problems, (iv) the proposed program of activities, and (v) \nprogress expected in the next 3 months. The implementing agencies will keep records to allow the \nidentification  of  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds  following  accounting \nprinciples and practices prescribed by the Accounting Law of the PRC. This law requires that the \nfinancial statements generally follow recognized accounting standards. The implementing agencies \nwill set up and maintain separate project accounts and records. The financial statements of the \nproject accounts and the annual corporate financial statements for implementing agencies will be \nsubject to external audit by the audit bureau of the cities and areas concerned, XUARG audit \nbureau, and the state audit bureau. The audits will be carried out in accordance with PRC audit \nregulations and must meet ADB requirements. A separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the \nimprest account and statement of expenditure will be part of the audit reports. The implementing \nagencies\u2019 annual audited financial statements and audited project accounts will be submitted to \nADB no later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year throughout the implementation period. \nXUARG and the implementing agencies will submit reports and information to ADB concerning the \nuse of the loan proceeds, project implementation, and implementing agency performance. These \nreports will include (i) semiannual progress reports on project implementation, (ii) annual reports, \nand (iii) a project completion report not later than 3 months after the completion of the project \nfacilities. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n50.  The PPMS indicators, their relevance, and monitoring practicalities have been discussed \nwith  the  Xinjiang  and  city  PMOs  and  implementing  agencies  during  project  preparation.  The \nindicators are based on the monitoring indicators in the design and monitoring framework. At the \nstart of implementation of the Project, the Xinjiang and city PMOs and implementing agencies, with \nthe loan implementation consultant\u2019s assistance, will develop comprehensive PPMS procedures to \ngenerate data systematically on the inputs and outputs of the subcomponents, as well as the \nindicators to be used to measure the project impact. The Xinjiang and city PMOs will (i) refine the \nPPMS, (ii) confirm achievable targets, (iii) finalize monitoring and recording arrangements, and \n(iv) establish systems and procedures no later than 6 months after loan effectiveness. \n \n9.  Project Review \n51.  In addition to joint project reviews carried out at least once a year, ADB, XUARG, and the \nimplementing agencies will undertake a comprehensive midterm review 2 years after the start of \nproject  implementation.  This  will  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation \narrangements, resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and progress on the agenda for \npolicy reform and capacity-building measures. Feedback from the PPMS activities will be analyzed. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n52.  Social Aspects. Xinjiang is a low-income region compared with the coastal provinces. \nYining City (home to 93% of all project beneficiaries) is a low-income area with a mean per capita \nincome less than half that of the Xinjiang urban area average. The Project will benefit about \n471,400 people, 10% of whom are poor. Major socioeconomic impacts include (i) improvement of ", "    15 \nliving  standards  through  provision  of  essential  public  infrastructure,  (ii) improvement  of  public \nhealth through infrastructure and environmental upgrading, (iii) improvement of the quality and \naffordability of basic services, and (iv) significant job creation. Approximately half of the project \nbeneficiaries of the constructed infrastructure and environmental improvement will be women. \n \n53.  The poverty and social assessment has identified several major areas where the Project \nwill  benefit  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  groups.  Provision  of  water  supply  and  wastewater \ninfrastructure will have quantifiable impacts on public health in terms of savings made on medical \nconsultations and purchase of medicines. The Project will reduce the incidence of water- and \nvector-related diseases and improve the living conditions of the population. The health impact \nanalysis is in Supplementary Appendix J. The infrastructure improvements will reduce time spent \non  domestic  work  (largely  undertaken  by  women),  such  as  fetching  and  disposal  of  water, \ncleaning, and caring for children, the sick, and the elderly. Connections to district heating systems \nwill  enable  households  to  save  significantly  on  purchases  of  heating  coal.  Yining  City  offers \nsubsidies  for  various  public  utilities  to  poor  households  receiving  minimum  standard  of  living \nallowance. Jobs created through the Project, during both the construction and O&M phases, will (i) \nhelp address the significant unemployment in both Kanas and Yining, (ii) provide new skills to local \nworkers, and (iii) stimulate a number of secondary industries. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 10; details are in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n54.  The Project is classified as category A for resettlement. For the Yining component, which \nwill necessitate relatively large amounts of land acquisition and resettlement, a full resettlement \nplan has been prepared based on ADB resettlement policy and PRC guidelines. Under the Kanas \ncomponent,  upgraded  village  roads  will  follow  their  existing  alignments.  Consequently,  the \nresettlement impacts are very slight and a short resettlement plan has been prepared. Although the \nAlashankou component will occupy a large amount of state-owned land, the land is barren and no \npeople will be affected, therefore no resettlement plan is required. Land acquisition and house \ndemolition  in  Kanas  and  Yining  will  directly  affect  a  total  of  2,021  persons  comprising  354 \nhouseholds (1,857 persons), 100 small businesses, and an enterprise (164 persons). A budget of \n$9.86  million  has  been  allocated  for  all  activities  related  to  land  acquisition,  relocation,  and \ncompensation. The Yining and Kanas PMOs have endorsed and disclosed the resettlement plans \nto the affected persons and the resettlement plans were posted in the neighborhood committee \nand/or village offices in mid-October 2007. The summary resettlement plan is in Appendix 11. The \nYining and Kanas PMOs will employ a national external monitor to (i) review resettlement progress \nand the general welfare of those affected every 6 months, (ii) recommend ways to resolve any \nissues or problems, (iii) provide advice to implementing agencies and local officials, and (iv) submit \nreports on these matters to ADB. \n \n55.  Xinjiang is a region with a high number and proportion of ethnic minorities (24% of the \npopulation in Alashankou, 97% in Kanas, and 82% in Yining). The Project is classified as category \nA for ethnic minorities. The socioeconomic analysis has shown that ethnic minorities are more \nlikely to be poor than the general population in both Kanas and Yining, where land acquisition and \nresettlement will significantly affect ethnic minorities. In line with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples (1998) and PRC requirements, the Yining and Kanas PMOs have each prepared and \nendorsed an ethnic minority development plan (EMDP) for the respective component and have \ndisclosed  the  EMDPs  to  the  affected  persons  at  public  meetings  and  for  posting  in  the \nneighborhood committee and/or village offices in mid-October 2007. The EMDPs set out measures \nand identify the budget sources needed in order to enhance positive impacts and mitigate any \nnegative impacts ethnic minorities may experience. Importantly, the EMDPs also set out a detailed \nparticipation  plan  to  ensure  that  ethnic  minorities  are  heard  and  to  inform  project  design, \nimplementation, and actions to specifically target ethnic minorities. The summary EMDP is in \nAppendix 12. \n \n ", "16   \n56.  Financial Aspects. A financial analysis of the Project was undertaken for the revenue-\ngenerating  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  heating  subcomponents  in  Alashankou.  Financial \nsustainability  analysis  was  undertaken  for  the  nonrevenue-generating  roads,  environmental \nsanitation  and  solid  waste  management,  vegetation  recovery,  and  protective  forest \nsubcomponents. Financial projections take into account the impact on receivables and costs of \noperational improvements, reductions in unaccounted-for water, and gradual increase in tariffs. \nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the water supply subcomponent in Alashankou, \ncomputed on an after-tax basis, is 6.9%; for the wastewater subcomponent it is 5.8%, and for the \nheating subcomponent it is 11.2%. The FIRRs compare favorably with the weighted average cost \nof capital in real terms of 3.2% for the water supply and wastewater subcomponents and 3.1% for \nthe heating subcomponent. The sensitivity analyses include examination of the risk that project \ncosts will increase by 10.0%, or that revenues will decrease by 10.0% without implementation of \nthe required water, wastewater, and heating tariffs; the FIRR is 5.9% for water supply, 4.7% for \nwastewater, and 10.5% for heating. The summary financial analysis is in Appendix 13, and details \nare in Supplementary Appendix L. \n \n57.  The current water, wastewater and heating tariffs in Alashankou are sufficient to cover the \nO&M costs and depreciation of existing facilities. Tariffs will need to be increased when the ADB-\nfinanced  facilities  come  into  operation.  As  the  population  base  in  Alashankou  is  small,  tariff \nincreases to achieve full cost recovery will take time. The Government has assured that (i) tariffs \nwill be increased in phases, taking into account affordability factors; and (ii) subsidies will be \nprovided to ensure sustainable O&M of the project facilities. The Project will provide capacity \nbuilding  on  tariff  reforms  and  tariff  setting  in  Alashankou.  An  affordability  analysis  of  the \nsubcomponents showed that the combined full-cost water supply, wastewater, and heating tariffs \nare 4% of average household income in Alashankou. There are currently no tariffs on water and \nwastewater in Kanas. Provision of utility services in the project villages is fully financed by the \nGovernment through tourism revenues. As the majority of the residents in the project villages are \npoor, the Government has indicated that it will not charge tariffs on the villagers. Notwithstanding \nthat, the Project will provide capacity building on financial management to ensure that sufficient \nfunds are allocated for sustainable O&M of the project facilities. \n \n58.  Financial  sustainability  of  the  nonrevenue-generating  subcomponents  was  determined. \nAffordability  by  the  implementing  agencies  was  assessed  by  comparing  identified  financing \nsources with the annual funds required for capital expenditures during project implementation, and \nO&M and debt services during operation. Forecast debt service and O&M costs for the Yining, \nAlashankou, and Kanas components were compared as a percentage of relevant annual revenues. \nThese  were  found  to  be  6%  for  Yining,  1%  for  Alashankou,  and  2%  for  Kanas,  indicating \nacceptable fiscal risk, particularly in light of increasing government revenues. During the peak \nproject implementation period, counterpart funds for Yining will not exceed 6% of the annual capital \nexpenditure budget; the figure for Alashankou is 1%, and for Kanas 3%. The Project is considered \nboth financially viable and sustainable. \n \n59.  The results of the financial management assessment indicate that the executing agency \nhas a sound financial management system and adequate experience in managing projects funded \nby foreign financial institutions. The implementing agencies operate as bureaus or departments of \nthe  project  local  governments,  or  as  state-owned  enterprises.  Accounting  and  financial \nmanagement systems for financial reporting and accounting are developed and are adequate for \nthe purpose of loan implementation, although improvements to internal control might be required. \nAs the Alashankou implementing agency is a newly established company, accounting and financial \nmanagement capacities will be further improved through training and institutional development \nprovided under the Project. The Kanas implementing agency is not experienced in operating water \nand wastewater plants or solid waste facilities; the Project will support institutional strengthening by \nproviding training in utility management. Audit arrangements are generally adequate, although \naudits appear to be carried out only when the bureaus and/or departments undertake major ", "    17 \nengineering works. The implementing agencies will be required to submit independently audited \nannual  financial  statements  and  project  accounts  to  ADB  as  a  loan  covenant.  The  three \nimplementing  agencies  have  no  experience  with  externally  funded  projects;  training  for  the \nimplementing  agencies  on  ADB  procedures  and  requirements  related  to  procurement, \ndisbursement,  financial  reporting,  monitoring,  internal  control,  financial  management,  and \nanticorruption safeguards will therefore be provided under the Project. Supplementary Appendix M \nprovides details of the financial management assessment. \n \n60.  Economic  Aspects.  The  economic  analysis  for  the  Project  covers  (i)  the  economic \nrationale for public intervention, (ii) the goals of the investment plan, and (iii) the design of the plan. \nThe economic rationale is sound as the Project will (i) support XUARG to promote development in \ncities and towns in a more coordinated and cost-effective manner, and (ii) bring about more \nsustainable investments in infrastructure, which aim to support inclusive economic growth and \nimprove the quality of life. The economic analysis also evaluates the subcomponents relative to \nleast-cost  analysis  criteria  and  standard  benefit\u2013cost  analysis.  The  results  of  the  economic \nanalysis indicate that the three components are economically viable and that they stand up to \nsensitivity analyses where costs increase and benefits decrease. The economic internal rate of \nreturn under the base case for the Alashankou component is 15.7%, for Kanas 18.7%, and for \nYining  20.3%.  All  are  above  the  12.0%  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  under  various \nsensitivity analyses, including increase in costs and decrease in benefits; delay of implementation \nby 1 year does not have a significant impact. A summary economic analysis is in Appendix 14, \nwhile the detailed economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix N. \n \n61.  Environmental Aspects. The Project is classified as environment category A. Extensive \npublic consultations involving surveys, meetings with stakeholders, and focus-group discussions \nwere undertaken during project preparation. The summary environmental impact assessment was \ncirculated to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors and posted on the ADB website on 22 October 2007. \n \n62.  The Project will improve the living environment for the residents in Alashankou land port, \nKanas scenic region, and Yining City. Construction of the water treatment plant and use of water \nfrom a reservoir in Alashankou will prevent the overuse of groundwater and remove a factor that \nlimits the economic development of the land port. Provision of sanitation facilities\u2014including public \ntoilets,  garbage  bins,  garbage  storage  and  transfer  stations,  and  sanitary  landfills\u2014will  have \nenvironmental  and  public  health  benefits.  This  is  particularly  important  for  Kanas,  where  the \ntourism industry is growing rapidly. If sanitation facilities are not in place in time, there will be \nadverse environmental impacts in the natural reserve. \n \n63.  The project cities and areas presently lack an adequate road network. Construction of new \nroads will improve connectivity within the project cities and areas. Upgrading of existing dirt roads \nwill improve the currently dusty conditions during the dry season and muddy conditions during \nrainy  and  snow  seasons\u2014a  major  constraint  to  efficient  and  effective  transport  and  an \ninconvenience to the residents. The roadworks will also provide opportunities to install or upgrade \nmunicipal services\u2014including pipelines, cables, or conduits for water supply, wastewater collection, \npower, heating, and telecommunications\u2014and will bring environmental and social benefits to the \npopulation. \n \n64.  Importantly,  the  Project  provides  an  opportunity  for  XUARG  to  put  in  place  sound \nenvironmental management systems in border cities and towns before economic development \naccelerates, and establish adequate institutional capacity in environmental management to ensure \nenvironmental sustainability for future development. \n \n65.  During  construction,  dust  from  construction  sites,  noise  from  powered  mechanical \nequipment, wastewater, solid waste, and construction traffic are expected to be the major adverse \nimpacts. Good project management and effective mitigation measures have been recommended. \n ", "18   \nWith the implementation of these measures, the impacts will be mitigated to acceptable levels. An \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) has been developed for the design, construction, and \noperational  phases  of  the  Project.  The  EMP  includes  the  institutional  strengthening  for \nimplementing the mitigation measures and undertaking the monitoring requirements. The EMP will \nbe further developed as the Project progresses to provide more details so that all mitigation \nrequirements are met. \n \n66.  Project Risks and Mitigation Measures. The Project does not have any unusual technical \nrisks.  Conventional  engineering  designs  with  proven  records  of  reliable  performance  will  be \nadopted for road construction, installation of municipal services along roads, water supply and \nwastewater management, solid waste treatment, environmental sanitation, heating, landscaping, \nand  ecological  protective  planting.  During  project  implementation,  the  loan  implementation \nconsultant will support the PMOs and implementing agencies to ensure that equipment and works \ncomply with the design requirements and quality assurances. \n \n67.  The following risks could affect timely implementation, economic viability, and realization of \nbenefits  of  the  Project:  (i)  failure  to  implement  institutional  strengthening  for  effective  project \nimplementation  and  management;  (ii)  lack  of  proper  O&M  of  project  facilities;  (iii)  major \namendments  and  changes  to  the  master  plans  in  the  project  cities  and  areas;  (iv)  delay  in \ncompletion of related projects (such as the ring roads in Kanas) that will provide better access to \nthe villages, and a new reservoir in Alashankou as an alternate raw water source; (v) delay in the \nprovision of counterpart funding; (vi) failure to establish or increase water, wastewater, and heating \ntariffs in Alashankou to meet cost-recovery targets; and (vii) unforeseen land acquisition and \nresettlement issues, which could hamper the efficient implementation of the project works and \nrestoration of livelihoods of affected persons. \n \n68.  Risks (i) and (ii) will be mitigated through provision of institutional capacity building for the \nXinjiang  and  city  PMOs  and  implementing  agencies  with  support  of  the  loan  implementation \nconsultant.  Risks  (iii)  and  (iv)  will  be  mitigated  by  synchronization  of  the  project  design  and \nimplementation  schedules  with  other  planned  projects.  The  three  project  governments  have \nprovided specific loan assurances that are covenanted in the Loan Agreement. Risks (v) and (vi) \nwill  be  mitigated  through  covenanted  assurances  from  the  three  project  governments  on  the \nprovision of counterpart funding and from the BMAP government on regular tariff reviews and \nincreases. Risk (vii) will be mitigated by strengthening of the internal monitoring and supervision by \nthe Xinjiang and city PMOs and implementing agencies, and by engagement of a qualified external \nagency to monitor and evaluate resettlement. \n \nV.

Road \nmaintenance  and  traffic  management  now  suffer  from  underinvestment  relative  to  road \nconstruction, and pedestrian and nonmotorized transport is marginalized, posing safety hazards. \nGrowth of car ownership, an increase in road accidents, and the lack of parking management \ncompound the situation. Without prompt mitigation measures, the quality of life and the efficiency of \neconomies will be reduced. Capacity building and institutional development in urban planning and \nmanagement is important to ensuring sustainability of the infrastructure. Among the environmental \nprotection tasks in the Premier\u2019s 2007 Report on the Work of the Government,1 priority is given to \nthe  development  of  urban  public transport  systems,  employment  of  comprehensive  economic \nmeasures to facilitate environmental work, and increase of funding to support construction of \nfacilities for treating urban sewage and household wastes. \n \n2.  The PRC\u2019s western region has not benefited as much as the coastal regions from rapid \ngrowth and reforms. Infrastructure and service provision cannot match increasing demand, thereby \nhindering investment, degrading the environment, and limiting growth opportunities. In 1999, the \nGovernment  launched  the  western  region  development  strategy  to  promote  balanced  growth, \nstimulate development, and raise the living standard in the western region. This strategy is still a \nmajor thrust of its Eleventh Five-Year Plan (11FYP) for 2006\u20132010. The focus now is on (i) \nimproving border facilities, (ii) strengthening cooperation and trade with neighboring countries, (iii) \nimproving  infrastructure,  (iv)  protecting  the  environment,  and  (v)  encouraging  private  sector \ninvestment. The Asian Development Bank is actively supporting this initiative. \n \n3.  Sixty two percent of the population of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang), in the \nnorthwest of the PRC comes from 46 ethnic minority groups. Sharing 5,600 kilometers (km) of \nborder with eight countries, Xinjiang is the gateway between the PRC and the Central Asian \nrepublics, with which it has many cultural similarities and economic complementarities. Its history \nand ethnic culture has promoted tourism development and its rich natural resources provide a \nsound basis for development. Considering these advantages, in order to maximize the potential for \ngrowth and raise living standards, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region government focuses its \ndevelopment strategy on its potential role in the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \n(CAREC) Program, and in its 11FYP accorded high priority to sustainable economic development \nthrough construction and upgrade of the infrastructure in major border ports, while at the same time \nprotecting  the  environment.  Xinjiang\u2019s  border  cities  face  the  challenge  of  increasing  utility \ndemands, as do many other areas in the PRC. The lack of transportation planning leads to poor \nprovision  for  infrastructure  and  environmental  protection  and  has  an  impact  on  the  transport \nstrategy,  public  transport  provisions,  and  road  safety  considerations  for  pedestrians,  cyclists, \ndrivers, and passengers. Poor traffic management contributes to a reduction in accessibility and an \nincrease in traffic accidents. Old and fragile utilities and inadequate infrastructure provision result in \npoor standards and frequent service failures. \n \n4.  The Project will support the Government\u2019s poverty reduction policies through provision of \nsustainable municipal infrastructure and increased economic activities and employment, and will (i) \npromote its CAREC strategy, (ii) protect the environment by controlling and reducing pollution, and \n(iii) improve health and living conditions. The Project component areas are located near the border \nwith  Kazakhstan.  The  Alashankou  component  includes  wide-ranging  infrastructure  and \n                                                 \n1  PRC Government. 2007. Report on the Work of the Government. Beijing. ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nenvironmental improvements that will strengthen its position as a gateway for traffic to and from the \ncountries  of  Central  Asia.  Kanas,  with  a  top-ranked  nature  reserve,  requires  provision  of \ninfrastructure, environmental protection measures for four villages, and environmental restoration \nfrom damage caused by poor tourism management. The Yining component will include upgrade \nand expansion of the road network and associated utilities. \n \nB.  Roads \n \n5.  The road subcomponents will fulfill functional requirements of individual areas. Apart from \nimproving accessibility within the areas, they provide an opportunity for the extension of municipal \nservices to existing and proposed premises. Yining is a medium-sized city of 438,000 people and is \nundergoing  expansion  and  transformation.  In  2004,  its  passenger  trips  reached  19.1  million \npersons and freight traffic 456,000 tons. It has 17 arterial roads, 2.3 million square meters of paved \nroads, and 434 narrow and unpaved alleys. The road network includes radial and ring roads in the \nold district in a grid. The city government has decided to retain the characteristics of the old district \nand upgrade the road network to improve accessibility. The Project includes construction and \nupgrading of four arterial roads and paving of alleys in 33 areas within the old district, together with \nassociated utilities. Upgrading of two arterial roads that link to the ring road system will provide an \nopportunity to develop the new areas to the west of the old town. A new road and the extension of \nan existing arterial road will cater for a new railway station to the north. New and upgraded roads \nwill improve the traffic conditions and public transport. Road safety and traffic management are \nalso areas of concern. Capacity building in urban planning and traffic engineering will improve \ntraffic management capability.  \n \n6.  Alashankou land port\u2019s present population is under 30,000 people, with a target of 80,000 \nby 2020. The main employment is for services related to the land port, such as port management, \ncargo handling, processing of raw materials, and supporting facilities. Many roads built when the \nland port opened in 1990 are due for rehabilitation; most have no walkways and amenity strips. \nThe Project comprises 13 new roads and 6 upgraded roads on existing road base compacted by \nroad traffic, totaling 29.3 km in the central district, plus roadside utilities. The Northern Ring Road \nwill connect to a railway line; Youhao Road will be used for cross-border cargo traffic in the short \nterm, and the Western Ring Road will be used in the long term. The existing and proposed road \nnetwork in the master plan follows strictly a grid system without a clear network hierarchy; traffic \ncontrol will become difficult as traffic levels increase. The Project includes upgrading of existing \nroads  and  provision  of  new  roads  for  future  residential,  cargo  storage,  trade,  and  office \nadministration uses, and this will support cross-border trade.  \n \n7.  Kanas scenic region\u2019s road subcomponent covers three of the four villages under the \nProject, the master plans of which are being reviewed by the Altay Prefecture government. The \npresent roads\u2014unpaved, narrow, and in poor condition\u2014are dusty on sunny days and muddy on \nrainy days in summer and are completely blocked by ice in winter. Existing and new roads are \nproposed  to  be  paved  along  tracks  at  a  gentle  gradient  with  materials  in  harmony  with  the \nenvironment, enabling vehicles to serve the villages at all times. Street lighting will be installed. The \nProject also includes parking areas and stabilization of adjacent slopes. \n \nC.  Water Supply, Wastewater Treatment, Sanitation, and Waste Management \n \n8.  The water source in Alashankou is underground water. The annual quantity that can be \nreplenished is 4.67 million cubic meters (m3); the quantity now extracted is 5.18 million m3 due to \nrapid development. This overextraction has lowered the water level and the water quality has \ndeteriorated. The present water demand of the land port of 14,200 m3/day is forecast to reach \n60,000 m3/day by 2015; the supply from the present water treatment plant is only 5,000 m3/day. \nThe Project includes a water treatment plant and inlet distribution pipelines to meet the needs of \nthe land port\u2019s development and of the residents. The water supply for the Kanas subcomponent is \nin Tiereketi Village, among the hills upstream of the Haba River. The village has no water supply \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nsystem; farmers and herdsmen currently use spring water and unhygienic river water. As rainfall \nand snowfall is abundant and the Tiereketi River, a tributary of the Haba River, flows through the \nvillage, the underground and surface water resources can meet the demands of villagers and \ntourists in the coming years. The Project includes water extraction works, high-level water tanks, \nwater supply, and household connection pipelines to supply water to the villagers, who live at \nvarious levels in the river valley. \n \n9.  There is no wastewater treatment facility in Alashankou and the sewage pipes serve only \n70% of the demand. The Project includes interceptor pipes laid with the roads and a wastewater \ntreatment plant. The treated effluent will be carried to an effluent storage tank and used for \nirrigation of desert woodland. There are also no wastewater treatment facilities or sewage pipes in \nvillages in Kanas. The Project includes a buried wastewater treatment system, sewage pipes, and \nhousehold connection pipes in Tiereketi Village. The treated effluent will meet discharge standards \nfor irrigation of forests and pastures. \n \n10.  Yining\u2019s environmental sanitation subcomponent includes waste collection and disposal \nfacilities. Alashankou has no solid waste treatment, collection, or transfer facilities; garbage is \ndelivered to a location with high groundwater level and, without anti-seepage measures, it pollutes \nthe groundwater. The Project includes public toilets, garbage collection points, dustbins, garbage \ntrucks,  and  a  solid  waste  landfill  site.  In  Kanas,  along  with  tourism  development,  some \nenvironmental sanitation and refuse collection facilities have been built, but it is limited to a few \nreceiving  bases.  Most  villages  and  tourist  spots  have  no  dustbins,  refuse  collection  points, \nenvironmentally friendly toilets, or a proper landfill; the residents randomly bury or dispose of the \nrefuse, which pollutes the environment. The Project includes public toilets, garbage trucks, refuse \ncollection stations, dustbins, and a sanitary landfill. \n \nD.  Afforestation and Ecological Protection \n \n11.  Alashankou is in a semidesert area. In its urban area the landscaping ratio is less than 20%, \nbelow the 60% laid down in the master plan. The irrigation pipes are aging, and irrigation of the \nlandscaped areas strains the inadequate water sources. The wastewater treatment plant of the \nProject will discharge treated effluent to be used for irrigation of desert woodland, thereby avoiding \npollution of groundwater and conserving water sources. The Project also includes replacement of \nirrigation pipes and irrigation of ecological protective forests. In Kanas, vegetation along many of \nthe hilly roads has been damaged, exposing the underlying soil, causing landslides and erosion, \nand endangering traffic. The Project includes reinstatement of vegetation along these roads. \n \nE.  Tourism Development in Kanas \n \n12.  Broader tourism opportunities, including vacation, recreation, and education in addition to \nsightseeing, have been introduced into the industry in the PRC. Kanas has great potential for \ntourism development. It possesses beautiful snowy landscapes, rivers, lakes, and pastures, and \npreserved frescoes from 4th century BC to 13th century AD and ruins of various nomadic tribes. It \nis the only home of the Tuvans, a branch of 2,000 Mongols, who inherit traditional beliefs, language, \nand cultural customs, and who live with other ethnic minorities, particularly the Kazaks. Kanas \nattracted 760,000 tourist trips in 2006. Tourist numbers and tourism revenue have been increasing \nrapidly. The villages in Kanas are underdeveloped with poor roads and no proper wastewater and \nsanitation facilities. Rapid development has led to pollution of some pastures, rivers, and lakes by \nwastewater and refuse. The Project includes roads, parking areas, water supply and sewage \ntreatment systems, waste facilities and landfill, and vegetation reinstatement to meet the residents\u2019 \nbasic needs, reinstate polluted landscapes, and support poverty reduction through environmentally \nsustainable tourism development.

Background.  The  Kanas  scenic  region  component  is  focused  on  improving  basic \ninfrastructure  (roads,  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  environmental  sanitation,  and  solid \nwaste treatment) and environmental protection. The environmental protected area is one of the \npremier tourism sites in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and a priority development area for \nXinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the PRC\u2019s western region development strategy. With the \nprovision of improved roads, potable water, and sanitation, the Project will provide direct benefits to \ncommunities through (i) local employment during construction, (ii) increased year-round access, \n(iii)  potentially  decreased  transport  costs,  and  (iv)  improved  health.  This  grant  is  focused  on \nproviding strategic gender and development  support to the Project so that communities,  and \nparticularly ethnic minority women (who historically have had little interaction with the market \neconomy in the area), can gain long-term benefits from these improvements by participating in the \nnew  tourism  economy  through  small-enterprise  development  highlighting  their  unique  cultural \nheritage, and utilizing the improved basic infrastructure. The grant also supports capacity building \nand a role in implementation for the local branch of the Women\u2019s Federation, which is responsible \nfor training and mobilization on gender issues at the local level. \n \n2.  The poverty and social analysis for the Project has found that ethnic minority women in \nKanas currently are rarely involved in the market economy, but have great interest in participating \nand are important potential economic contributors to their families. This grant seeks to provide the \nnecessary  capacity  to  enable  women  to  participate  in  the  new  opportunities  that  the  project \ninfrastructure improvements will help create. It focuses on building capacity at the local level for \nmanagement and marketing of cultural tourism and integrating women\u2019s traditional knowledge on \nhandicrafts,  local  foods,  and  hospitality  management  to  support  livelihood  and  economic \ndevelopment. The grant supports demonstration projects in health and hygiene to help maximize \nthe  positive  impacts  of  the  improved  water  and  sanitation  infrastructure.  It  also  supports  the \ndevelopment of capacity of the Women\u2019s Federation and training materials on ethnic minorities and \ncultural tourism that can benefit other areas as well. \n \n3.  The grant is directly related to the Xinjiang Municipal Infrastructure and Environmental \nImprovement Project and responds to gender issues raised in the poverty and social analysis and \nethnic  minority  development  plan  conducted  for  the  Project.  It  supports  the  PRC\u2019s  goal  of \ndevelopment of the western region and support of balanced growth and poverty reduction in one of \nthe poorest and most remote regions of the PRC. It will also serve as an important pilot of the \ndevelopment of cultural tourism in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, where tourism is a major \ncontributor to the local economy. The grant directly addresses (i) the focal area in the country \npartnership strategy of promotion of rural development; and (ii) issues raised in the PRC country \ngender assessment of (a) encouragement of women\u2019s entrepreneurship, (b) empowerment of \nwomen to participate in community development, (c) gender mainstreaming in projects, and (d) \nsupport to women\u2019s organizations. The activities are in line with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \nPolicy on Gender and Development (1998), which, among other things, calls for bringing women\u2019s \nparticipation in decision-making and development activities into the mainstream. \n \n4.  Objective. The objective of the grant is to maximize the benefits of the infrastructure \nimprovements  from  the  Project  by  building  local  capacity  for  ethnic  minority  women\u2019s \nentrepreneurial activities in local tourism and awareness on health and hygiene issues. This will be \nachieved  through  (i)  capacity-building  training  on  issues  such  as  handicraft  fabrication,  food \nproduction,  marketing,  small  hostel  management,  cultural  heritage,  risks  in  community-based \ntourism,  and  communication;  (ii)  initiation  of  small  revolving  credit  funds  to  facilitate  small-\nenterprise inception; (iii) construction of three shops in the project area which will have the capacity \nto store foodstuffs, handicrafts, and other commodities produced in the area and serve as meeting \nareas for women to participate in the management and organization of marketing of cultural \nheritage to tourists; and (iv) three demonstration hygiene and sanitation projects in target villages \nfocusing on women and childcare. \n ", "32  Appendix 4 \n5.  Success indicators will include (i) participation in workshops; (ii) creation of entrepreneurial \nactivities in each of the villages; (iii) participation in demonstration projects, and (iv) creation of \ntraining materials, which can be replicated in other communities. \n \n6.  Implementation Arrangements.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nThe Xinjiang Municipal Infrastructure and Environmental Improvement Project will contribute to poverty reduction through \nremoving infrastructure constraints, addressing environmental concerns, promoting sustainable economic growth, and \nsupporting institutional reforms in three of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region\u2019s (Xinjiang\u2019s) border cities and areas: \nAlashankou land port, Kanas scenic region, and Yining City. Xinjiang is PRC's largest region (17% of total area), with a \nrelatively small population (20 million), 62% of whom belong to ethnic minorities. As the historic Silk Road passes \nthrough it, Xinjiang has a rich history and culture which has promoted tourism development. Despite these assets, it \nremains one of the poorest regions in the PRC, with 27 out of 22 cities and 68 counties classified as poor. In 2006, about \n8.4% of Xinjiang\u2019s urban population lived on incomes below the official poverty line, compared with the 4.0% national \naverage. The Project is in line with the PRC poverty reduction strategy for development of the western region, which \nseeks to decrease the gaps created by eastern PRC\u2019s rapid economic development and supports the government\u2019s \ndevelopment vision of xiaokang (moderately well-off) articulated in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (11FYP, 2006\u20132010) \naimed at maintaining high rates of growth, but channeling it towards poverty reduction and reducing disparities. The \nProject supports the PRC country partnership strategy priority areas of (i) strengthening inclusiveness through increasing \ninvestment to support rural development, (ii) promoting regional cooperation and integration, and (iii) managing the \nenvironment. The Project will do the following. \n(i)  Create jobs and employment opportunities. It is anticipated that 4,718 full-time jobs during the construction \nperiod and 7,549 follow-on multiplier effect jobs will be created. Of the construction jobs, 75% will be unskilled. \nThe loan assurances specifically address employment of vulnerable groups, ethnic minorities, and women. \n(ii)  Improve  living  standards.  Road  construction  will  facilitate  mobility,  access,  and  affordability  for  local \npopulations to key basic services and destinations. Water and sanitation improvements will improve health and \nsignificantly reduce time burdens, particularly for women. Heating improvements will increase quality of life and \nreduce health issues related to home heating fuels. \n(iii)  Protect the environment. The environment management plan (EMP) outlines clear actions for environmental \nprotection (land and water) during construction, and these are accounted for in the loan assurances. \n(iv)  Focus on ethnic minority areas. Xinjiang is predominantly an ethnic minority region. Yining City (with 93.0% of \nthe total beneficiaries) and Kanas scenic region are both majority ethnic minority areas (75.0% of the population \nin Yining City and 99.5% in Kanas). \n(v)  Provide skills training. The Project will include skills training (including for language, construction, livestock \nbreeding, agricultural expansion, and local tourism) in collaboration with other stakeholders, and through the \nresettlement plans and ethnic minority development plans (EMDPs). Vulnerable groups, ethnic minorities, and \nwomen are prioritized in the loan assurances. \n(vi) Support gender inclusion. Loan assurances will ensure the participation of women throughout the Project. In \naddition, a grant for the Kanas Women\u2019s Enterprise Development Project will ensure that women\u2019s involvement \nin decision-making and development activities is brought into the mainstream. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                    Targeting Classification:  Targeted Intervention\u2013 \nnon-income Millennium Development Goals \n1. Key Issues \nThe Project is classified as targeted intervention\u2014Millennium Development Goals. It will benefit 471,418 people, 10% of \nwhom are poor. Western China and Xinjiang have been identified in the PRC national development strategies as being \ngeographically disadvantaged with a higher incidence of poverty than other regions, calling for special efforts through \nprioritized allocation of resources. Yining City (the location of 93% of beneficiaries) has a high poverty rate with 15.7% of \nthe nonagricultural population entitled to the minimum standard of living subsidy. The average per capita income in \nYining of CNY311 is low compared to the Xinjiang urban average of CNY666. In Kanas poverty is high (20%), and 85% \nof households have a family income of less than CNY1,800 per month. According to the household survey, total mean \nfamily expenses equate to 91% of income. Nonincome poverty in Kanas is severe, and the cost of purchased goods is \nhigh due to the considerable transport costs. Alashankou has no minimum standard of living social welfare program. Its \naverage per capita income is high, due in part to the large percentage (46%) of single people working there and to the \nhigher than average wages offered to attract them to this remote location. The household survey indicates that the entire \nsampled population working in Alashankou is from elsewhere\u201450% from Boertala Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture \n ", "  Appendix 10  43 \nand 16% from elsewhere in Xinjiang. Incomes in Alashankou contribute to poverty alleviation at the points of origin of its \nworkers. Yining and Kanas currently have high levels of unemployment (8% in Yining and 7% in Kanas), well above the \nunder 4% target in the 11FYP. \nPoverty in the project area is largely rural and is most likely to affect those in the agricultural and livestock industries and \nto be experienced by ethnic minorities. The following three factors are mutually reinforcing: ethnic minorities (except \nUygurs) are more likely to live in rural (or peri-urban) areas, work in the primary sector, and have high dependency ratios. \nPoor people are not more likely to be undereducated, unemployed, or casual laborers. Benefits to poor people from the \nProject will be increased cash incomes\u2014through employment and livelihood expansion in sectors such as cultural \ntourism\u2014as a result of increased prices for agricultural products, decreased cost of inputs from improved roads and \nservices, and reduced costs for medical expenses due to improved wastewater and public sanitation infrastructure. \n2. Design Features \nThe design has attempted to reduce impacts on land acquisition and resettlement. Where necessary, the resettlement \nplans in consultation with local communities have outlined mitigation plans. Project assurances call for employment of \nlocal labor, especially vulnerable groups, ethnic minorities, and women. EMDPs outline strategies for mitigating adverse \nimpacts  and  promoting  positive  benefits  such  as  employment,  skills  training,  language  training,  and  training  for \ncontractors and workers on appropriate cultural understanding. Interpreters will facilitate the work of construction units. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Findings of Social Analysis \nThe  Project  will  provide  infrastructure  for  25,307  household  water,  57,870  wastewater,  62,253  heating,  31,765 \ntelecommunications, and 9,510 electricity connections and 19,424 garbage collection receptacles. Most beneficiaries will \nbe from ethnic minorities: 97% in Kanas, 82% in Yining, and 24% in Alashankou. \n \nImpacts on health and safety. Residents in Tiereketi village in Kanas currently get their water from the river. The water \nsupply subcomponent will improve health and safety and save time in the village. All villages in Kanas will benefit from \nimproved rubbish collection and disposal systems. Fifty five percent of households currently bury or burn their rubbish. \nHuman waste is disposed of directly onto the ground and not every household has a toilet. Improvements to village water \nsupply, wastewater disposal, and public sanitation (waste collection and sanitary toilets) will decrease the incidence of \ndisease. Over 50% of Kanas school children have missed at least one day of school in the last 12 months due to illness. \nHealth care expenditure is high. The project subcomponent with the biggest social impact in Alashankou is garbage \ncollection and treatment, with provision of a new sanitary landfill. Garbage is put into skips around the town but is blown \naround by the wind. Residents in the project areas of Yining have inadequate public utilities (water supply, wastewater, \nand public sanitation). The Yining subproject includes public toilets, garbage collection stations, dustbins, garbage \ncollection containers, garbage trucks, street cleaning trucks, and snow clearing trucks. Fifty nine percent of households \nbury or burn their rubbish; the incidence of respiratory illness is very high. Expansion of the public heating system will \nimprove respiratory health. \n \nAffordability. Water bills are low and represent one of the smallest items of expenditure measured by the household \nsurvey. In Yining, if a poor family cannot afford to pay the water bill, generally the fee is waived; therefore tap water is \nuniversally affordable since a debt will never accumulate. Poor households consume about a third less fuel than average \nhousehold consumption. Fuel cost is a significant item of expenditure for poor households (7.7% of income), compared \nwith just 3.8% for average households. The residential heating charge for Yining is CNY17.5 per month, which is \nsignificant for both average and poor households, and savings of CNY45.0 per month will accrue to average households \nand CNY25.0 to poor households. Garbage collection, wastewater, and water supply fees cost an average of CNY43.0 \nper month. The savings to be gained by connecting to district heating will effectively pay for these public utilities for the \naverage household. \n \nImpacts on employment. Approximately 4,718 full-time jobs will be created over the construction period and follow-on \nmultiplier effects are expected to create 7,549 full-time jobs. Currently unemployed persons are likely to fill 75% of \nconstruction jobs (assumed to be unskilled jobs). This translates into CNY32.4 million of costs returned to the northwest \nXinjiang economy. Operation and maintenance will create 572 additional full-time permanent jobs directly and 915 further \njobs through multiplier effects, effectively directing about CNY4 million per year in wages into local economies. \nB. Consultation and Participation \n1. The technical assistance project utilized several participation processes for input from a range of stakeholders in the \nproject areas. A socioeconomic survey at household level covered 608 households and information relating to 4,186 \npeople. Community meetings were held to discuss topics related to the technical assistance but not specifically covered \nin the socioeconomic survey. Key informant interviews were held with bureaus and nongovernment organizations to \ninform the project design. For the resettlement plans, separate socioeconomic surveys, community meetings, opinion \nsurveys,  and  specific  impact  studies  (500  people)  were  conducted.  Development  of  the  environmental  impact \nassessments and EMP involved two rounds of public consultations. EMDPs have been prepared collaboratively and \nextensively discussed with communities. The resettlement plans, EMDPs, and EMP set out detailed ongoing public \nparticipation plans. \n ", "44  Appendix 10 \n2.

A PID has been \nprepared for each subproject. Booklets outlining the resettlement plans were distributed to affected households and \ndisclosure meetings held. Copies of the booklet are available at the respective project management offices, and each \naffected village office. Each PID (available in Chinese and the local languages) contains (i) a map of the affected areas; \n(ii) description of the Project, its aims, and subcomponents; (iii) details of the works; (iv) a timetable of the project \nactivities, including estimated commencement and completion dates; (v) expected social, economic, and environmental \nimpacts; (vi) environmental and social safeguards; (vii) the compensation policy and entitlements; (viii) an outline of \nlivelihood restoration measures; (ix) the working of the compensation committee and grievance redress committee; (x) an \noutline of how consultation and participation with resettlement plans and communities will continue; and (xi) the project \ncommunications strategy, including how people can find out about business opportunities that may arise in conjunction \nwith the Project and where people can get further information about the Project. Resettlement plans and EMDPs indicate \nhow consultation will continue throughout implementation. \nC.  Gender and Development \n1. Key Issues. Aside from the economic and employment impacts, the social impacts of the Project are clearly gender \nbased. Improved water, wastewater, public toilet, and refuse collection services will benefit women in particular. The \npoverty and social assessment indicated that women strongly support the Project and anticipate benefits such as an \nimproved  living  environment,  new  employment  opportunities,  reduced  time  burdens,  and  reduced  incidence  of \npreventable illness. \n2. Actions.

Xinjiang Municipal Infrastructure and Environmental Improvement Project consists of three \ncomponents: (i) Yining City roads and municipal services (Yining component); (ii) Kanas scenic \nregion infrastructure and environmental protection (Kanas component); and (iii) Alashankou land \nport municipal infrastructure and environmental protection (Alashankou component). The Yining \ncomponent includes four main roads (13.23 kilometers [km]), reconstruction of 33 residential lanes \n(132.61 km) and environmental sanitation facilities such as public toilets, garbage collection units, \nand associated infrastructure. The Kanas component, which seeks to address the infrastructure \nproblems of the villages in Kanas, includes 24.28 km of roads, four parking lots, and water supply, \nwastewater treatment, and solid waste management systems. The Alashankou component will \ndevelop  infrastructure  facilities  for  the  land  port\u2014including  a  landfill  and  waste  management \nsystem\u2014to encourage expansion of cross-border trade and protect the local environment from \npollution. Based on the feasibility study report the Yining component will necessitate large amounts \nof land acquisition and resettlement compared with Kanas, where the impacts are insignificant. \nAlthough the Alashankou component will occupy a large amount of state-owned land, the land is \nbarren and no people will be affected. A full resettlement plan has been prepared for the Yining \ncomponent and a short resettlement plan has been prepared for the Kanas component, both in \ncompliance with Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). During \nproject  implementation  the  resettlement  plans  will  be  updated  based  on  detailed  engineering \ndesign, will be disclosed to affected persons, and submitted to ADB for approval prior to award of \ncivil works contracts. \n \nB.  Resettlement Impacts \n \n2.  To  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  close  consultation  with  local \nofficials, village committees, and affected persons have been undertaken during the resettlement \nplan preparation. The Project will affect seven villages of six townships and streets in Yining and \nKanas.  Land  acquisition  and/or  house  demolition  will  directly  affect  2,021  persons  or \n354 households  (1,857  persons),  100  small  businesses,  and  an  enterprise  (164  persons).  In \naddition,  551.21  mu  (Chinese  unit  of  area,  15  mu  =  1  hectare)  of  state-owned  land  will  be \npermanently occupied; 575.11 mu of collective land will be acquired, of which 433.47 mu (75.4%) \nis classified as cultivated and/or orchard land; 53.1 mu of grassland will be occupied temporarily \nduring construction; and 26,792.75 square meters (m2) of residential housing and 1,933.8 m2 of \nnonresidential buildings (1,855.8 m2 of shops and 78 m2 of enterprises) will be demolished. About \n100 small-business shops and a petrol station in Yining will be affected. Households (117) losing \nfarmland have a landholding size ranging between 3 mu and 7 mu and the land loss ranges \nbetween 0.06 mu and 7 mu.

Policy and Legal Framework \n \n3.  The resettlement plans have been prepared in compliance with the Land Administration \nLaw of the People\u2019s Republic of China (2004), relevant regulations of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous \nRegion and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy. Based on consultation with local governments \nand affected persons and general practices in the project area, the implementing agencies have \nadopted a set of resettlement principles and an entitlement matrix has been prepared for the \nProject.  Compensation  for  land  acquisition,  residential  housing,  and  nonresidential  buildings \n(shops  and  enterprises)  will  be  paid  to  all  users,  whether  titled  or  not.  For  land  acquisition, \ncompensation fees include land compensation, a resettlement subsidy, and compensation for \ncrops and trees. The land compensation will be paid to the affected villages and/or affected \npersons and the resettlement subsidy to the affected persons. The land acquisition compensation \nis rated at the land\u2019s average annual output value. For business, shop, and house demolition, \ncompensation will be paid to owners for rehabilitation of the affected persons. The compensation \npayments will be in cash according to the appraised value of the land and fixed property assets. \nCompensation for crops, trees, other facilities, and temporary impacts will be paid directly to \naffected  persons.  Income  losses  resulting  from  reduced  production  and/or  sales  and  wages \ncaused by the Project will be assessed and compensated for in cash. \n \nD.  Resettlement and Rehabilitation \n \n4.  To minimize the resettlement impacts to affected persons and restore their living standards, \ndetailed programs of restoration and relocation have been arranged in each resettlement plan. \nPeople  can  choose  the  available  programs  according  to  their  requirements.  Based  on  the \neconomic characteristics of affected villages, different schemes for income restoration will be \ncarried out. Since the resettlement impacts of the Kanas component are very slight, the affected \nvillages will be compensated in cash. For villages seriously affected by the Yining component, \nadditional strategies and measures, including low-yield land improvement and livestock raising, will \nbe taken. Assistance measures\u2014such as the provision of employment in project construction, \nprovision of skills training, and employment information\u2014will be provided to all affected persons \n(50% of whom are women). Through these measures, it is envisaged that all affected persons can \nmaintain or acquire more stable incomes to restore and raise their living standards. For residential \nhousing demolition, the affected households will receive compensation at replacement costs for the \nlost structures and attachments without depreciation. The affected households can rebuild their \nhouses by themselves with free house plots provided according to their wishes. Salvage of the \nstructural materials will be allowed and a relocation subsidy will be provided. For nonresidential \nbuildings  and  structures  (small-business  shops  and  enterprises),  the  affected  owners  will  be \ncompensated with cash at replacement costs for the lost structures. The affected shops and \nenterprises  can  be  either  moved  back  and  rebuilt  on  the  existing  backyard  of  shops  along \nupgraded roads or built on free sites provided by the project management office (PMO), depending \non the practicality of moving back and their wishes. In addition, special attention will be paid to \nvulnerable groups for their resettlement and rehabilitation; they will receive the following additional \nassistance: (i) the establishment of special supporting funds in each component, (ii) the provision \nof potential employment opportunities, and (iii) skills training. \n \nE.  Resettlement Cost and Fund Management \n \n5.  The cost estimate for land acquisition and resettlement of the Yining component and Kanas \ncomponent is CNY73.43 million (in early 2007 prices), including contingencies and land taxes, and \nthis is equivalent to $9.86 million.1 The city PMOs will fund land acquisition and resettlement costs, \nincluded as part of the total project cost. According to the compensation policies and standards \ndefined in the resettlement plans, the payment and use of compensation funds will be carried out \nunder the supervision of the internal monitoring agencies, with regular audit review and regular \n                                                 \n1  The exchange rate is estimated at CNY7.45 = $1. \n ", "48  Appendix 11 \nreview by the external monitoring agency. Detailed measurement surveys will be conducted in the \nvillages, small shops, and enterprises. The compensation contracts will be negotiated and signed \nwith village committees, households, small-business shops, and enterprises. On this basis, the \nfinal costs might be adjusted. \n \nF.  Information Disclosure, Participation, and Grievances \n \n6.  The affected persons have been informed about the major elements of land acquisition and \nresettlement through consultation during the planning stage and information disclosure sessions \nwith the affected persons, villages, and county governments during the project preparation stage. \nDuring  meetings,  interviews,  focus-group  discussions,  public  consultation  workshops,  and \ncommunity consultation meetings, local representatives have participated in the planning and their \nconcerns integrated into the resettlement plans. The draft resettlement plans were distributed and \ndisclosed to the affected counties, townships, villages, and affected persons in mid-October 2007, \nprior  to  ADB's  management  review  meeting.  Resettlement  information  booklets  that  were \ndisseminated to the affected persons in August 2007 confirm (i) the project affected areas, (ii) the \nimplementation schedule and framework, (iii) compensation standards for land acquisition and \nother assets, (iv) relocation assistance, (v) the livelihood rehabilitation strategy, and (vi) dispute \nresolution procedures. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005), the final \nresettlement plans were posted on the ADB website on 17 December 2007. The PMO will set up \nproject resettlement agencies to supervise implementation, continue public consultations, monitor \nprogress, and deal with grievances. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangement and Schedule \n \n7.  Xinjiang PMO will assume overall responsibility for the implementation of resettlement. Each \ncity and area PMO under it coordinates the planning, implementation, financing, and reporting of \nland acquisition and resettlement. The implementing agencies are the Yining Construction Bureau \nfor the Yining component and the Kanas Environmental Protection Construction and Transportation \nBureau for the Kanas component. The implementing agencies will take primary responsibility for the \nresettlement consultation, implementation, and timely delivery of entitlements. To ensure smooth \nimplementation,  staff  in  charge  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  undertake  training  on \nresettlement  implementation  organized  by  the  Xinjiang  PMO.  The  resettlement  implementation \nschedule  for  the  Yining  component  and  Kanas  component  has  been  prepared  based  on  the \npreparation and construction timetable. No land acquisition or demolition will start until resettlement \nplans are updated based on detailed designs and approved by ADB. It is anticipated that land \nacquisition and house demolition will start in March 2008 and be completed by the end of 2010. \n \nH.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n8.  Internal and external monitoring of resettlement implementation will be conducted. Each \nPMO will carry out internal supervision and monitoring to ensure compliance with the provisions of \nthe resettlement plan. Xinjiang PMO and the city and area PMOs will engage an independent \nagency for semi-annual monitoring and annual evaluation for the Yining component and annual \nmonitoring and evaluation for the Kanas component of land acquisition and resettlement until 2 \nyears after the completion of land acquisition and resettlement. The independent agency will \nmonitor  and  evaluate  the  progress  of  resettlement  implementation,  payment,  and  dispute \nresolution. It will identify the impacts for affected persons on (i) whether they have received the \napproved compensation and entitlements on time, and (ii) whether their living standard and income \nlevel have been restored to pre-project status. A baseline survey will be carried out before land \nacquisition and house demolition starts. External monitoring reports will be forwarded directly to the \nPMO and ADB. \n ", "  Appendix 12  49 \nSUMMARY ETHNIC MINORITY DEVELOPMENT PLAN \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The Yining City and Kanas scenic region ethnic minority development plans (EMDPs) \nensure that ethnic minorities will benefit equitably from the Project and that any negative impacts \nwill be reduced or mitigated. Provisions to improve the economic conditions of ethnic minorities \nhave been integrated into the project design and project assurances. Special mitigation measures \nare included in the resettlement plans to ensure that ethnic minority communities affected by land \nacquisition  benefit  from  the  Project.  Government  policies  and  programs  for  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment further protect and enhance project benefits. The EMDPs are based on relevant laws \nand regulations of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s) Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \nB.  Project Descriptions \n \n2.  The Yining City roads and municipal services component includes (i) road construction and \nassociated  infrastructure,  and  (ii)  environmental  sanitation  facilities.  The  Kanas  scenic  region \ninfrastructure and environmental protection component includes (i) road reconstruction and parking \nlots, (ii) water supply and wastewater treatment facility construction, (iii) provision of infrastructure \nfor sanitation and solid waste treatment (toilets, solid waste collection trucks and depots, and a \nsolid waste landfill), and (iv) revegetation of the environment and plants destroyed or damaged as \na result of past road construction. \n \nC.  Socioeconomic Profiles \n \n3.  As PRC\u2019s largest autonomous region or province, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region \n(Xinjiang) is a low-income region with a small population (20 million), made up of 62% ethnic \nminorities, the largest of which are the Uygur. Located on the PRC\u2019s western border, Yining City is \nthe capital of the Yili Kazak Autonomous Prefecture. Previously part of the northern pass of the Silk \nRoad, today the prefecture has become an important trading port and international connection \npoint with more than 2,000 kilometers of international border and eight land ports. Kanas scenic \nregion is close to the northwest border of the PRC. It is a premier tourism site and a priority \ndevelopment area for Xinjiang and the PRC\u2019s western region development strategy. Tourism has \nrapidly developed with an average yearly increase of almost 64% since 1997, resulting in 760,000 \ntourist trips in 2006, generating a total of CNY0.46 billion in tourism revenue. \n \n4.  In  2006,  the  population  of  Yining  City  was  471,418,  and  62%  of  these  people  were \nnonagricultural.  Thirty  two  ethnic  minority  groups\u2014including  Uygur,  Kazak,  Hui,  Russian, \nMongolian, Xibo, Kirgiz, Tajik, and Tatar\u2014living primarily in mixed communities account for two \nthirds of Yining\u2019s population. The poverty rate is high, with 15.7% of the nonagricultural population \nentitled to the minimum standard of living subsidy. The average per capita income in Yining of \nCNY311 is low compared to the Xinjiang urban average of CNY666.  \n \n5.  The population of the four main project affected villages of Kanas, Tiereketi, Hemu, and \nBaihaba1 is approximately 3,629 and is 99.5% ethnic minority\u2014Kazak (49.5%), Mongolian Tuwa \n(48.4%), and Hui (1.7%). The people are pastoralists, living in villages for the winter and tents on \nremote grazing lands in the summer. Poverty is high (20%), and 85% of households have a family \nincome of less than CNY1,800 per month. According to the household survey, total mean family \nexpenses per month equate to 91% of income. Small-scale tourism is increasingly being entered \ninto, but important barriers\u2014such as poor infrastructure and language skills\u2014have limited the \nopportunities to date. Access to improved water supply and sanitation is low to nonexistent. \n \n                                                 \n1  Baihaba Village may also be referred to as North Akehaba Village and South Akehaba Village. \n ", "50  Appendix 12 \nD.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n \n6.  The EMDPs ensure that (i) ethnic minority people are given opportunities to participate in all \nstages and receive the benefits of the Project, and (ii) the strategies developed to mitigate against \nnegative  impacts  are  sensitive  to  the  culture  of  affected  minority  groups.  Project  assurances \naddress prioritization of ethnic minorities and vulnerable groups for employment opportunities. The \nskills and language training will help ensure sustainability of incomes and livelihoods. \n \n7.  Yining City. The poverty and social assessment indicates that the overall positive impacts \nof the Project (improved mobility and access, sanitation, and environmental protection) on ethnic \nminorities will be the same as on the Han population. The Project involves resettlement and \nrelocation due to demolition of houses and shops. Of the 255 affected person households, 70% are \nethnic minorities. The resettlement plan and the environmental management plan outline strategies \nfor mitigation of negative impacts that will be applicable to both ethnic minorities and Han people. \nIn cooperation with the Civil Affairs Department, the resettlement plan also outlines special funds \nwhich have been established to provide additional aid, including subsidies and medical care for \nvulnerable  and  ethnic  minority  groups.  The  project  management  office  has  agreed  to  the \nassurances obliging contractors to employ local labor, and workers from ethnic minorities will be \nparticularly targeted. Skills training in construction, tourism, and livestock and language training will \nbe provided in coordination with other government and local stakeholders. Attention to ethnic \nminority cultural issues will be addressed through awareness building with workers and prohibitions \non  construction  near  religious  sites  on  particular  days.  HIV/AIDS  information  and  education \nactivities  will  be  supported  by  the  Project  and  the  Yining  Center  for  Disease  Control.  The \nexpansion of bus and taxi services will pay attention to ensuring that public transportation is \navailable for the new relocation sites and improved roads (predominantly ethnic minority areas). \n \n8.  Kanas. The poverty and social assessment indicates that ethnic minorities will be the major \nbeneficiaries of improvements to the water supply and sanitation infrastructure, and that women\u2019s \nwork in domestic and community cleaning, and care of children, the sick, and elderly, will be \nreduced. The village roads will allow tourists access to the area and facilitate participation of \nvillagers in tourism activities which showcase their culture. Provision of carparks and public toilets \nwill ensure that tourists do not damage the environment, reducing the quality of life and resource \nbase for the residents. Revegetation of roadside areas (damaged during the road project which \nprovided  access  to  Buerjin  County)  and  further  greening  work  will  ensure  the  Project  has \nsustainable environmental benefits and does not contribute to the erosion of grasslands. More than \n1,310 construction jobs and 245 permanent operations-period jobs will be created in an area with \nhigh (almost 7%) unemployment. Project assurances address local employment and HIV/AIDS \nawareness issues. Impacts are expected to be gender neutral, with men benefiting more from \ntemporary job creation and women from reduced domestic and care work, opportunities for income \ngeneration from tourism growth, and project-related business initiatives. Ongoing improvements to \ngrassland management and stock breeding, to which the Project will contribute, will improve family \nincomes. A Gender and Development Fund grant for the Kanas Women\u2019s Enterprise Development \nProject will strengthen project outcomes for local women by building capacity at the local level for \nmanagement and marketing of local tourism and integrating women\u2019s traditional knowledge on \nhandicrafts and local foods for livelihood and tourism development. It also supports demonstration \nprojects  in  health  and  hygiene  to  maximize  the  impacts  of  improved  water  and  sanitation \ninfrastructure. \n \nE.  Consultation and Disclosure \n \n9.  During preparation, affected persons and ethnic minority populations living in Yining City \nand Kanas scenic region were extensively consulted about the likely impacts of the Project and \nparticipated  in  outlining  actions  to  improve  positive  outcomes.  Other  stakeholders  consulted \ninclude (i) heads of affected person households, (ii) village heads and villagers\u2019 representatives, \n(iii) local government agencies and departments, and (iv) women and vulnerable groups. From \n ", "  Appendix 12  51 \nJune to August 2007, consultative meetings were held in Yining, Kanas, Buerjin, and Urumqi to \ndiscuss and finalize the EMDPs. The EMDPs were endorsed and disclosed to the targeted villages, \ntownships, and subdistricts in mid-October 2007, and were posted on the ADB website on 12 \nDecember 2007. The participation and disclosure plan will use notices and meetings to deal with all \naspects  of  the  Project,  such  as  notification  of  employment  and  training  opportunities,  land \nacquisition details, EMDP actions, and general information and feedback sessions. During the \nproject implementation period, the project management offices will encourage affected persons to \nparticipate  in  the  extra  resettlement  activities  such  as  skills  training.  Ethnic  minorities  will \nparticipate in the formulation of compensation standards and relocation plans. To resolve any \ngrievances and ensure smooth construction and project implementation, a clear, transparent, and \nefficient complaint and appeal channel with redress mechanisms has been outlined. This will be \nthe same for grievances arising from both resettlement plan and EMDP implementation. Monitoring \nindicators related to participation and feedback have been incorporated into the plan. \n \nF.  Implementation and Institutional Arrangements \n \n10.  For the Yining component, the Yining municipal government and executing agency will be \nresponsible  for  implementing  the  EMDP.  The  Ethnic  Affairs  Bureau  will  provide  support  to \ncoordinate, advise, and monitor implementation progress. Implementation arrangements for the \nEMDPs  have  been  integrated  into  project  management,  or  are  part  of  ongoing  government \nprograms. Other agencies include the Center for Disease Control, Civil Affairs Bureau, Labor and \nSocial Security Bureau, and All China Women\u2019s Federation. The Yining Ethnic Affairs Bureau will \nprovide  oversight  and  review  of  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  reports,  and  provide \nrecommendations.  Township  governments  and  subdistrict  offices  will  assign  staff  for \nimplementation and coordination. The executing agency will have a member responsible for EMDP \nimplementation.  For  the  Kanas  component,  the  Kanas  scenic  region  management  committee \n(KSRMC) of Altay Prefecture will be the implementing agency for the Project. The KSRMC will \nimplement the EMDP, supported by the Civil Administration Bureau, Ethnic Affairs Administration \nCommission, and Women\u2019s Federation of Altay Prefecture. Implementing partners include the local \ntownships,  local  governments,  village  committees  and  project  contractors.  Local  government \nstaffing, related costs, and planned related projects are covered by their administrative budgets. \n \nG.  Budgeting and Financing Sources \n \n11.  The EMDP activities will not require a separate budget. The actions are included either as \npart of the project budgets or as part of local government development budgets. Local government \nagencies will collaborate with the executing agency, Yining City government and the KSRMC; the \nlocal government budgets cover their staffing and related costs. Project actions are costed under \nthe resettlement plans and project contracts. The Gender and Development Fund will provide \n$150,000 for the Kanas Women\u2019s Enterprise Development Project. \n \nH.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n12.  Regular monitoring and evaluation of the EMDPs will ensure the plans are implemented \nproperly. Objectives of the monitoring and evaluation plans with respect to ethnic minorities will be \n(i) to collect data and information to identify project impacts based on the development monitoring \nframework in the poverty and social assessment and the monitoring frameworks for resettlement, \nincluding qualitative information to describe social or poverty changes on ethnic minorities and their \ncommunities; and (ii) to ensure that appropriate approaches have been adopted and the goals \nhave been achieved. Yining City government and the KSRMC will undertake internal monitoring. \nIndependent organizations will be hired for each area in conjunction with the resettlement plan \nexternal monitoring agency to provide independent advice on progress, impacts, and outcomes. \nTerms of reference for external monitoring are appended to the EMDPs. The Yining component is \nscheduled  to  commence  in  2008 and  finish in  2012.  The  Kanas component  is  scheduled  to \ncommence in 2008 and finish in 2012. \n ", "52  Appendix 13 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  Financial  analysis  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s)  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2005).  An  assessment  of  financial \nperformance  has  been  completed  for  the  Yining  municipal  government,  Boertala  Mongolian \nAutonomous  Prefecture  (BMAP)  government,  and  Altay  Prefecture  government.  The  financial \nanalysis has been undertaken for the revenue generating subcomponents such as water supply, \nwastewater treatment, and heating supply. A financial sustainability analysis has been undertaken \nfor the nonrevenue-generating subcomponents such as the roads, vegetation recovery, solid waste \ntreatment, and protective forests. \n \nB.  Revenue Generating Subcomponents \n \n1.  Objective and Approach \n \n2.  The financial analysis examines (and identifies required) income streams over a projected \nperiod  and  assesses  these  against  the  costs  related  to  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M), \nincluding debt servicing. This is undertaken on a present value basis and measured by a financial \ninternal rate of return (FIRR). Assumptions have been made for the applicable subcomponent\u2019s \noperations, leading to a with-project and without-project analysis and stream of incremental costs \nand revenues over a 25-year period, including a 5-year implementation period. All analyses are in \nreal terms using mid-2007 prices. The base-case financial model FIRR is compared with the \nsubcomponent\u2019s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) to determine financial sustainability. A \nsensitivity analysis further assesses the impact of changes in cost and revenue assumptions on \nthe  base-case  FIRR.  This  therefore  allows  a  conclusion on  the  financial  sustainability  of  the \nproject-created  assets  to  be  made  as  well  as  identification  of  necessary  measures  for \nsustainability. \n \n2.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n \n3.  The WACC has been calculated in real terms for each subcomponent. Funding sources for \nthe water supply, wastewater, and heating supply infrastructure subcomponents are the ADB loan \nand  counterpart  funds  from  the  Yining  municipal  government,  BMAP  government,  and  Altay \nPrefecture government. The Ministry of Finance will relend the ADB loan to the BMAP government \nand Altay Prefecture government at 6.2% (London interbank offered rate of 5.6% and service \ncharge of 0.6%). The local inflation rate is 3% per annum and international inflation rate is 2%. The \nWACC has been determined to be 3.2% for the water supply and wastewater subcomponents and \n3.1% for the heating subcomponent for Alashankou land port. \n \n3.  Alashankou Land Port Existing and Projected Tariffs for the Financial Internal \nRate of Return Analysis \n \n4.  The Project\u2014which is in line with Government policy to achieve phased full cost recovery in \nwater, wastewater, and heating\u2014will recover the O&M costs of the water supply, wastewater, and \nheating  supply,  depreciation,  and  loan  repayments  from  user  charges.  The  existing  tariff  of \nCNY1.56 per cubic meter (m3) for the water supply, CNY1.50 per m3 for wastewater, and CNY34 \nper household per month for heating will be increased gradually until full cost recovery has been \nachieved.1 This  allows  for  affordable  tariffs  and  gives  sufficient  revenue  to  the  prefecture \ngovernment to operate the Project\u2019s facilities and finance replacement of short-lived assets. The \nwastewater tariffs will be levied as an amount for each m3 of water consumed. The wastewater fee \nwill be included on water supply bills as a separate additional item. The water supply, wastewater, \n                                                 \n1  Following Ministry of Construction guidance announced by the vice minister on 22 August 2006. ", "  Appendix 13  53 \nand heating tariffs will be increased annually during the implementation period so that subsidies \nwill be eliminated. In addition, the service coverage and tariff collection efficiency will be gradually \nimproved to increase revenues to the service providers. Charges are set higher for commercial and \nindustrial consumers to help ensure affordability for domestic users, especially for low-income \nhouseholds. \n \n5.  The  detailed  financial  projections  of  Alashankou  land  port  assume  that  the  BMAP \ngovernment will be able to gradually increase tariffs after project completion until full cost-recovery \nhas been achieved. BMAP shall undertake operational improvements\u2014such as reduction of the \nsystems  losses  and  unaccounted-for  water\u2014to  increase  water  revenue,  reduce  accounts \nreceivable, and undertake individual connections and metering prior to project completion. These \nmeasures  must  be  initiated  prior  to  project  completion  to  ensure  financial  sustainability  of \noperations. The Project addresses these operational improvements through loan assurances. The \ndetailed projections for the heating supply assume that additional generation capacity will be built \nand will be available by 2015. Heating revenues from 2012 have been based on increased tariffs \nand, after construction of the additional capacity, revenues have been derived from increased \nservice  coverage  and  tariffs.  The  cost  of  construction  of  the  additional  capacity  has  been \nconsidered in the financial analysis. \n \n6.  It is anticipated that the tariffs will be increased gradually to full cost-recovery levels for \nO&M  and  depreciation.  By  2009,  when  loan  repayment  begins,  tariffs  must  cover  interest \nrepayments. After 2014, tariffs should cover principal repayments to ensure that they can finance \noperations and  debt  repayment.  This  is  reasonable  since  the  Project  will  improve  (i)  service \ndelivery, (ii) efficiency gains, (iii) tariff restructuring and reforms, and (iv) education and awareness \nof tariff increases. Table A13.1 shows the projected cost-recovery levels and projected tariffs \n(which are based on affordability) used in the financial analysis. The Government agrees to the \ngradual tariff increase. \n \nTable A13.1: Alashankou Land Port Projected Tariff and Cost Recovery Level \nItem  2012  2015  2016  2017  2018  2019  2020  2021  2022 \nAverage water supply tariff \n1.91  2.19  2.28  2.37  2.43  2.50  2.57  2.64  2.75 \n(CNY/m3) \nCost recovery (%)  52.00  54.00  53.00  58.00  63.00  69.00  75.00  82.00  97.00 \nAverage wastewater tariff \n1.75  1.98  2.12  2.26  2.42  2.58  2.71  2.84  2.98 \n(CNY/m3) \nCost recovery (%)  57.00  59.00  55.00  59.00  65.00  70.00  77.00  84.00  91.00 \nAverage heating charges \n36.80  37.54  38.29  30.06  39.84  40.63  41.45     \n(CNY/month) \nCost recovery (%)  54.00  54.00  50.00  60.00  73.00  87.00  105.00     \nm3 = cubic meter. \nSources: Boertala Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture, Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n4.  Kanas Scenic Region \n \n7.  Under the Project, a new water supply system and wastewater treatment plant will be \ndeveloped in Tiereketi Village in Kanas scenic region. Project completion will be 2012. As the \nmajority of the residents in the project villages are poor, Altay Prefecture government does not plan \nto collect tariffs from them. It will fully finance provision of utility services in the project villages \nthrough admission fees collected from tourists to Kanas Nature Reserve; these fees are projected \nto grow by 15% every year. Notwithstanding this, the Project will provide capacity building on \nfinancial management to ensure that sufficient funds will be allocated for sustainable O&M of the \nproject facilities. \n \n5.  Tariffs and Affordability \n \n8.  The assessment of affordability in Alashankou is based on the combined costs of water \nsupply, wastewater, and heating charges using the above cost-recovery tariffs. Based on the \n ", "54  Appendix 13 \nsocioeconomic  survey  results  of  household  income  and  estimated  water  consumption,  the \naffordability of households is analyzed. As shown in Table A13.2, households with an average \nmonthly  income  of  CNY1,795  will  pay  about  4\u20134.7%  of  their  income  based  on  actual  water \nconsumption, 70% of water consumed billed for wastewater, and heating charge, which covers \npayment for 6 months. The combined costs to households still remain around the affordability level \nof 5% of household income. \n \nTable A13.2: Affordability Analysis \nItem  2012  2013 2014 2015 2016 2017  2018  2019 2020  2021\nLow-Income Household                     \nIncome (CNY/month)  2,081.00  2,154.00 2,229.00 2,307.00 2,388.00 2,471.00  2,558.00  2,647.00 2,740.00  2,836.00\nWater consumption                     \n- per person (l/c/d)  120.00  120.00 120.00 120.00 120.00 150.00  150.00  150.00 150.00  150.00\n- number of persons per household  4.00  4.00 4.00 4.00 4.00 4.00  4.00  4.00 4.00  4.00\n- per household (m3/month)  14.40  14.40 14.40 14.40 14.40 18.00  18.00  18.00 18.00  18.00\nUnit tariffs                     \n- water tariff inclusive of VAT (CNY/m3)  1.91  2.01 2.10 2.19 2.28 2.37  2.43  2.50 2.57  2.64\n- wastewater charge (CNY/m3)  1.75  1.80 1.85 1.98 2.12 2.26  2.42  2.58 2.71  2.84\n- heating charge (CNY/month)  36.80  37.54 38.29 39.06 39.84 40.63  41.45  42.27 43.12  43.98\nMonthly Household Charges (CNY/month) \n - water supply  27.40  28.90 30.20 31.50 32.80 42.60  43.80  45.00 46.20  47.50\n - wastewater  25.20  26.00 26.70 28.50 30.50 40.70  43.50  46.50 48.70  51.10\n - heating  36.80  37.50 38.30 39.10 39.80 40.60  41.40  42.30 43.10  44.00\nTotal  89.50  92.40 95.20 99.10 103.10 124.00  128.70  133.70 138.00  142.60\nAs Percentage of Household Income (%) \n - water supply charges  1.30  1.30 1.40 1.40 1.40 1.70  1.70  1.70 1.70  1.70\n - wastewater charges  1.20  1.20 1.20 1.20 1.30 1.60  1.70  1.80 1.80  1.80\n - heating charges  1.80  1.70 1.70 1.70 1.70 1.60  1.60  1.60 1.60  1.60\n % of household income  4.30  4.30 4.30 4.30 4.30 5.00  5.00  5.00 5.00  5.00\nlpcd = liters per capita per day, m3 = cubic meter, VAT = value added tax. \nSources: Boertala Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture, Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n6.  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n \n9.  Base-case FIRRs and financial performance indicators for water supply, wastewater, and \nheating supply subcomponents in Alashankou land port are provided in Table A13.3. The after-tax \nFIRR for the base-case scenario for the water supply subcomponent is estimated at 6.9%, for \nwastewater 5.8%, and for heating supply 11.2%, and varies between 4.2% and 7.9% for the \nvarious sensitivity cases. The results compare favorably to the WACC of 3.2% for both water \nsupply and wastewater subcomponents and 3.1% for the heating supply, which assume gradual \ntariff increases at the onset of project implementation. The recommended tariff increases are \nrequired to cover the full cost of O&M, depreciation, interest, and principal during loan repayment. \nPeriodic tariff reviews and approval of appropriate tariff reforms by the prefecture government will \nbe required to reduce the risk of poor financial performance or of unexpected changes in tariff \nincome. The Project addresses tariff restructuring and review in loan assurances. \n \n10.  The financial analysis assumes that the BMAP government will be able to charge the \ngradual increase in tariffs until full cost-recovery has been achieved and undertake operational \nimprovements\u2014such as reduction of the systems losses and unaccounted-for water\u2014to increase \nwater revenue, reduce accounts receivable, and undertake individual connections and metering \nprior to project completion. These measures must be initiated prior to project completion to ensure \nfinancial sustainability of operations. \n \n11.  Financial analysis for the Kanas water supply and wastewater subcomponents did not yield \npositive FIRRs and net present values due to the very low affordability level of the households. The \n ", "  Appendix 13  55 \nGovernment will provide the necessary subsidy to ensure financial sustainability of operations. The \nrequired annual funds for O&M and debt service for these subcomponents were incorporated in the \nfiscal affordability analysis (Table A13.5). Furthermore, the Project will provide capacity building on \nasset and financial management to ensure adequate O&M occurs. \n \nTable A13.3: Alashankou Land Port Summary of the FIRR and Sensitivity Analysis \n  Water Supply    Wastewater    Heating Supply \nScenario  FIRR  NPV    FIRR  NPV    FIRR  NPV \n  (%)  (CNY million)   (%)  (CNY million)    (%)  (CNY million)\nBase Case  6.9  92.1    5.8  57.1    11.2  244.5 \nCase 2: 10% increase in costs  6.4  84.3    5.3  48.7    10.9  240.4 \nCase 3: 10% decrease in revenues  6.4  75.1    5.2  43.0    10.9  216.0 \nCase 4: 10% increase in costs and  5.9  67.3    4.7  34.3    10.5  212.0 \n10% decrease in revenues \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nC.

Nonrevenue-Generating Subcomponents \n \n13.  Financial  sustainability  of  the  nonrevenue-generating  subcomponents  during  both  the \nimplementation and operation phase has been determined. Fiscal affordability by the implementing \nagency has been assessed by comparing annual collections from the identified financing sources \nwith  the  annual  counterpart  funds  required  for  (i)  capital  expenditures  during  project \nimplementation, and (ii) recurrent costs for O&M and debt services of nonrevenue-generating \nsubcomponents  during  operation.  Interest  and  principal  repayments  for  the  ADB  loan  are \nestimated based on a grace period of 5 years and a maturity of 20 years. Table A13.5 shows the \nresults of the fiscal affordability analysis of the Yining municipal government, BMAP government, \nand Altay Prefecture government. \n \nTable A13.5: Fiscal Affordability Analysis (CNY million) \n  Implementation Period    Operational Period \n  Identified  Annual   \nTotal  Implemen- Annual  Operation  Annual \nSubproject  Annual  Counterpart  Affordability    Affordability \nCounterpart  tation  Debt  and  Funds \n  Funds  Funds  (%)    (%) \nFund  Period  Service  Maintenance  Required \nAvailable  Required \nYining  103  292  5  58 57    32  13  45  43\nAlashankou  84  270  5  54 65    17  12  29  35\nKanas  27  77  5  15 57    8  3  12  43\nSources: Yining municipal government, Boertala Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture and Altay Prefecture governments, \nand Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "56  Appendix 13 \n14.  The analysis indicates that, based on the identified fund sources during project preparation \n(including new budgets and allocations), all subcomponents have sufficient funds available for \ncounterpart funds during subcomponent implementation and for O&M costs and debt service \nduring the operation period. Annual forecasted debt service and O&M costs for nonrevenue-\ngenerating subcomponents are found to be about 2% of projected annual revenues in Yining, 4% \nin Alashankou, and 1% in Kanas. This indicates acceptable fiscal risk since it is expected that \nrevenues of the local governments will grow in line with economic development, providing more \nflexibility for the local governments to finance the subcomponents. \n \n15.  The Yining municipal government will provide about $39.2 million in counterpart funds \nduring implementation and $1.7 million per year during operation. The BMAP government will \nprovide about $36.3 million in counterpart funds during implementation and $1.6 million per year \nduring operation. The Altay Prefecture government will provide about $10.4 million in counterpart \nfunds during implementation and $0.5 million per year during operation.2 Assessment of budgets \nshows that each implementing agency has the necessary counterpart funds for its respective \nsubcomponents. During the peak implementation period, counterpart funds will not exceed 6% of \nthe Yining municipal government annual capital expenditure budget, 1% of the BMAP government \nannual capital expenditure budget and 3% of the Altay Prefecture government annual capital \nexpenditure budget. \n \n16.  Adequate maintenance is crucial to ensure the sustainability of the road subcomponents \nunder the Project where the local governments are responsible. A reliable funding mechanism for \nmaintenance and rehabilitation of roads must be designed. The establishment of a road fund \nshould be considered but it should encompass the whole road network of Yining, Alashankou, and \nKanas, not only the project roads. The establishment of such a fund will require legislation in order \nto achieve the goals. Possible sources for the road fund could be (i) a fuel levy, (ii) vehicle \nregistration and license fees, and (iii) road tolls. Though the identified annual funds (Table A13.5) \nwere  assured  to  be  available  to  the  Project,  there  are  still  other  competing  demands  for \ngovernment funds; thus each prefecture government should consider generating additional funds \nthrough direct maintenance charges and adopting measures to increase revenues. \n \nE.  Financial Management Assessment \n \n17.  Financial  management  assessment  of  the  executing  agency  (the  Xinjiang  Uygur \nAutonomous Region government) and the implementing agencies has been undertaken using the \nfinancial management questionnaire provided by ADB. It determines the accounting and financial \ncapacity needs during project implementation and operations after project completion. The Xinjiang \nUygur Autonomous Region government has a sound financial management system in place and \nhas  previous  experience  in  managing  foreign-assisted  projects,  confirming  that  their  financial \nmanagement practices are fully adequate for implementation of the Project. For the implementing \nagencies, each water, sanitation, and heating utility will be assisted to establish a sound financial \nmanagement system at the beginning of project implementation. Each utility will keep accounts in \naccordance with commercial accounting principles and be subject to an independent external audit \nby a suitably qualified firm of commercial auditors. Accounting will be in accordance with relevant \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  accounting  standards,  which  are  largely  in  accordance  with \ninternational norms. A capacity-building component to strengthen financial management has been \nincluded in the Project. \n \n18.  The staff will need training in project management and relevant ADB procedures during \nimplementation of the Project. With the help of international and national consultants, capacity will \nbe strengthened in (i) efficient operations of the water supply, wastewater, and heating facilities; \n(ii) functional  areas  covering  administration,  finance,  accounting,  and  business  planning;  and \n(iii) management information systems and cost management and control. \n                                                 \n2  Operation costs are estimated at 10% of total project costs. \n ", "  Appendix 14  57 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The economic analysis covers three components and 13 subcomponents. For the overall \nProject, the analysis covers (i) economic rationale for public intervention, (ii) the goals of the \ninvestment  plan,  and  (iii)  the  design  of  the  plan.  The  economic  analysis  also  evaluates  the \nsubcomponents  relative  to  least-cost  analysis  criteria  and  standard  benefit\u2013cost  analysis. \nEconomic analysis has been conducted in accordance with Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (1997) and Economic Analysis Retrospective \n2005: Strengthening Quality-at-Entry of ADB\u2019s Operations (2006). The detailed economic analysis \nand least-cost analysis are in Supplementary Appendix N. \n \nB.  Analysis of the Overall Project \n \n2.  Rationale for Public Intervention. The primary motivation for the Project results from the \nincreasing concern over the effects of population growth and economic growth on the inadequacy \nof  public  services  in  the  towns  and  cities  of  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  (Xinjiang). \nContinuing urbanization has resulted in increasing water shortages as well as major deficiencies in \nurban road networks and services. Furthermore, urban areas face environmental threats from \npollution of surface and subsurface waters from untreated wastewater and garbage. In 2005, the \nurban population in Xinjiang accounted for 37% of the total population. This is expected to increase \nto 42% by 2010 and 47% by 2015. \n \n3.  The strategic location of Xinjiang as a major transport corridor and as the gateway between \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China and the Central Asian countries1 is expected to spur economic \ndevelopment and contribute to tourism development. The region is also rich in natural resources \nincluding oil, metals, and minerals, which provide a sound basis for economic development. With \nthe expected rise in trade and tourism brought about by cooperation activities under the Central \nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation Program, development of necessary infrastructure support \nfacilities is critical to sustained economic growth and development. \n \n4.  The Project involves government intervention at several different levels. The Xinjiang Uygur \nAutonomous Region government is promoting development in the cities and towns in a more \ncoordinated and cost-effective manner by bringing about more sustainable investments in physical \nand environmental protection infrastructure that aims to improve the quality of life. Involvement of \nthe Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region government is justified since the development program \nspans several regions and cities. The municipal governments are coordinating and implementing \nthe elements of the master plans and making individual investments in the roads, water supply, \nsanitation, and wastewater works and will be involved in owning and managing some of the \ncompleted facilities. \n \n5.  Goals and Design of the Project. The Project is a direct response to Xinjiang\u2019s Eleventh \nFive-Year Plan (11FYP) to promote sustainable economic development, particularly in its border \ncities and areas, via construction and upgrading of the infrastructure in major border ports, while \nprotecting the environment. The 11FYP recognizes that achievement of these goals will require \nimprovement  of  the  basic  municipal  services  and  environmental  quality  in  these  areas.  All \nsubcomponents  in  the  proposed  Project  are  integral  components  in  the  11FYP.  Municipal \ngovernments are required to make investments in water supply, wastewater, ecological upgrading \nand solid waste management. The city and area government master plans are reasonably sound \nand are integrated with the overall planning process. \n \n                                                 \n1   The Second Eurasia Continental Bridge railway line connects Europe to East Asia through the Xinjiang Uygur \nAutonomous Region. \n ", "58  Appendix 14 \nC.  Demand Analysis \n \n6.  Traffic surveys have been carried out under the feasibility study reports. Traffic forecast has \nbeen  determined  based  on  socioeconomic  trends  that  have  taken  into  account  changes  in \nvariables such as gross domestic product (GDP), population, and vehicle ownership. The forecast \nGDP growth rates have been applied to the calibrated base-year matrices to produce passenger \nand freight vehicle flows. Traffic projections have also taken into account potential generated \ntraffic. It is concluded from a review of the demand forecast for the water supply, solid waste \nmanagement,  and  wastewater  and  heating  supply  carried  out  by  the  feasibility  study  report \nconsultants that the risk associated with demand forecast in the economic analysis would be \nminimal. This is because the Project will provide supply to meet existing demand or only a fraction \nof the total demand in the project cities and areas. \n \nD.  Evaluation of Individual Components \n \n7.  The least-cost analysis ensures that each subcomponent is optimally designed to meet the \ngoals of the Project, and does not involve unnecessary extra costs. The least-cost analysis has \ncovered all feasible options for a given subcomponent, including variations in technology and \nlocation. Since there is no unique least-cost plan to achieve the development targets, any plan that \nminimizes cost is acceptable in principle. For instance, water improvements may be achieved at \nleast cost through a centralized water supply, which needs to be connected to the main water \nsystem. To vastly reduce unaccounted-for water and eliminate subsidies over time, all customers in \neach of the subcomponents will have metered connections. The estimated average economic cost \nof each of the water supply and wastewater treatment subcomponents has been analyzed. The \npresent value of economic cost approach has been adopted for the roads, ecological upgrading, \nheating supply, and solid waste management subcomponents. Detailed calculation and discussion \nof the cost-effectiveness analysis is presented in Supplementary Appendix N. \n \n8.  In addition to being part of the 11FYP, each subcomponent is economically justified on its \nown. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) have been estimated for roads, water supply, solid \nwaste management, and heating supply subcomponents. The EIRRs are compared with economic \nopportunity cost of capital (EOCC), which is assumed to be 12%. Major benefits that have been \nquantified for each subcomponent include the following. \n \n(i)  Roads. (a) Savings in vehicle operating costs resulting from reduced travel distance and \nimproved  road  conditions,  (b)  savings  resulting  from  fewer  accidents,  (c)  reduced \nmaintenance costs, (d) savings in the value of passengers\u2019 time, (e) generated traffic \nresulting from reduced transportation costs, and (f) value of additional tourism in Kanas \nscenic region that is attributable to the subcomponent. \n(ii) Water supply. Health benefits are assumed as captured by the households\u2019 willingness to \npay.2 \n(iii) Environmental  sanitation.  (a)  Cost  of  illness  savings  (savings  in  medical  expenses) \nbrought about by the prevention of an increase in the incidence of waterborne diseases \narising from contamination of water; and (b) prevention of the associated increase in time \nlost from work leading to a loss of income, thus, less time lost to illness and also less time \nspent for the care of sick family members. \n(iv) Heating supply. (a) User cost savings, (b) household time savings for not refueling home \nfurnaces and handling of coal, and (c) local environmental benefits from improved air \nquality as a result of reduction in open burning of coal and reduced dust associated with \nhandling and storage of coal. Evaluation follows the benefit transfer method. \n                                                 \n2  Health benefits have been estimated but not considered in the economic internal rate of return calculations of water \nsupply subcomponents since they are an assumed part of willingness to pay. Health impact relates to deficiencies in \nsolid waste management facilities as well as other environmental factors. \n ", "  Appendix 14  59 \n9.  Water supply benefits are estimated using a willingness-to-pay approach. Water supply \ncustomers were asked to state their willingness to pay for service improvements and their revealed \nwillingness-to-pay is used to measure benefits to customers. The willingness-to-pay survey was \nconducted on a total of 100 households in Alashankou land port, which represents 10% of the total \nhousehold population in the district. Households\u2019 willingness-to-pay gathered from the results of \nthe  household  survey  has  been  analyzed  using  a  multivariate  regression  model.  The  mean \nwillingness-to-pay  multiplied  by  the  total  number  of  households  served  by  the  water  supply \nsubcomponent provides the gross benefit of the Project. The detailed estimation of the mean \nwillingness-to-pay is in Supplementary Appendix N. \n \n10.  The economic analysis has been conducted over 25 years, including project construction in \n2008 and completion in 2013. Economic benefits and costs are denominated in domestic price \nnumeraire at constant mid-2007 prices. Foreign currency costs have been converted into local \ncurrency costs using an exchange rate of CNY7.45 per $1 and adjusted based on purchasing \npower parity assumption. Project tradable components have been adjusted to economic prices \nusing a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.013 and nontradable components valued at domestic \nmarket prices. Project costs and benefits have been estimated on a without-project and with-\nproject basis. Transfer payments have been excluded. Standard sensitivity tests, and additional \ntests for a 1-year implementation delay and 20% increase in operation and maintenance costs, \nhave been conducted. \n \n11.  The economic costs include (i) the capital cost, including physical contingencies, land \nacquisition, resettlement, and environmental mitigation costs; and (ii) the cost of operation and \nmaintenance, including the cost of replacement of depreciated equipment. The land acquisition \nand resettlement costs have been based on their opportunity costs, i.e., the agricultural output \nforgone and the re-siting of displaced economic activities.3 Residual values have been treated as \nnegative costs at the end of the project life. \n \n12.

Overall Project Analysis and Conclusions \n \n15.  The above analysis indicates that the three components are economically viable and that \nthey  stand  up  to  sensitivity  tests  where  costs  increase  and  benefits  decrease.  The  cost  of \ninstitutional development has been incorporated into Yining\u2019s roads economic analysis while the \ncosts of toilets in the environmental sanitation subcomponents have been excluded from the \neconomic analysis. The EIRR for the whole Project has not been calculated due the diversity of the \nsubcomponents; only individual component EIRRs have been estimated as shown in Tables A14.1 \nto A14.3 above, which is 20.3% for Yining City, 15.7% for Alashankou land port, and 18.7% for \nKanas scenic region. The economic analysis demonstrates the economic viability of the three \ncomponents. The results of the sensitivity analysis confirm the robustness of the components\u2019 \neconomic  viability  against  changes  in  key  variables\u2014construction  costs,  operation  and \nmaintenance costs, benefits, and a 1-year delay in completion. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080331115707+08'00'", "Author": "MPA", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "xinjiang municipal infrastructure project, xinjiang municipal environmental project, xinjiang municipal improvement projects, xinjiang municipal china improvement projects, adb loan 4805, rrp: prc 39228", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20080424151614+08'00'", "Title": "Xinjiang Municipal Infrastructure and Environmental Improvement Project"}, "author_page": " \n \n \nVice President  C.
