THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Road Sector Governance and \nMaintenance Project.1 \n2.  The project will improve the delivery of public services in road asset management. It will \ncultivate  sustainable  and  efficient  road  asset  management  practices  by  strengthening \ngovernance and capacity for planning, financing, and implementing routine and periodic road \nmaintenance.2  The project will rehabilitate and maintain 327 kilometers (km) of national and \nlocal  roads  in  the  provinces  of  Attapu,  Salavan,  and  Xekong.  It  will  contribute  to  the \nachievement of the government\u2019s goal of improving road asset management. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sector  context.  As  a  landlocked  country,  the  Lao  PDR  depends  heavily  on  road \ntransport  for  economic  development.  The  road  subsector  dominates  its  transport  sector, \nrepresenting 98% of total passenger\u2013km traveled, and 86% of freight moved in the country.3 \nWhile the road network has expanded significantly in recent years, the growth in the number of \nvehicles has been faster. The road network in the Lao PDR consists of national, provincial, \ndistrict, and rural roads, with a total length of about 46,000 km and a density of about 7.4 km per \n1,000 persons, which is one of the highest in the region. Nonetheless, much of the road network, \nparticularly in the provinces, is in poor condition due to lack of proper maintenance. \n4.  The poor condition of the roads has led to frequent closures and has effectively cut off \ntransport connections, constraining the movement of people and goods and impeding economic \ndevelopment. The lack of well-managed and well-maintained roads hinders people\u2019s access to \nmarkets and basic services, significantly contributing to poverty. Inadequate road maintenance \nreduces the country\u2019s economic competitiveness and slows the pace of poverty reduction. \n5.  Improving the delivery of public services in road asset management is a long-term \nstrategic objective of the government. To achieve it, the government, with assistance from the \nWorld Bank and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, embarked on a \nlong-term plan in 2000 to improve road maintenance in the country, primarily by strengthening \nroad maintenance capacity and capability.4 Key outputs of the plan were the establishment of a \nRoad Maintenance Fund (RMF) and the development of an appropriate road maintenance \nmanagement system to help allocate funds and prioritize the maintenance of Lao PDR road \nassets. 5  In  2004\u20132010,  the  World  Bank  and  the  Swedish  International  Development \nCooperation Agency financed Road Maintenance Program Phase 1 and Phase 2 to further \nsupport road maintenance in the country. The Japan International Cooperation Agency currently \nfinances  the  Road  Management  Capability  Project  (2011\u20132016)  to  improve  governance, \nplanning, and management of sustainable road maintenance in Savannakhed and Vientiane \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance: ADB. 2014. Preparing the \nRoad Sector Governance and Maintenance Project. Manila (TA 8492-LAO). \n3  Lao PDR National Statistics Center. http://www.nsc.gov.la \n4  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5  The Lao PDR established the Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) to finance road maintenance. The RMF commenced \noperations in 2001. It is managed bythe Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) and is supervised by the \nRoad Maintenance Fund Advisory Board. ", "2 \nprovinces. In addition, the World Bank-financed Lao Road Sector Project (2010\u20132017) supports \nroad maintenance works of the provincial network in Houaphan and Phongsali provinces. \n6.  Key issues. The road sector is under the overall jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public \nWorks and Transport (MPWT). Following the decentralization policy in 2000, road maintenance \nresponsibilities of provincial road network have been delegated to the provincial departments of \nMPWT called provincial departments of public works and transport (DPWTs). As part of the \ndevolution policy, the assistance provided by development agencies has created a good system \nfor road asset management. Despite this, the devolution of road maintenance responsibilities \nhas continued to be constrained by inadequate governance, weak institutional capacity and \ninsufficient funding for road  asset management.  The key  challenges faced  by  MPWT and \nprovincial  DPWTs  for  undertaking  road  maintenance  activities  are  inadequate  governance \nprocedures for road maintenance planning, financial management, procurement, and contract \nsupervision, lack of staff\u2019s technical capacity and experience in road maintenance management, \nand financial constraints for undertaking road maintenance. Hence, strengthening governance \nand institutional capacity for road maintenance activities and supporting physical maintenance \nwork at the provincial level will facilitate efficient decentralization and effective delivery of road \nmaintenance to provide successful future road asset management in the country.  \n7.  The  road  network  is  deteriorating  rapidly  because  of  the  steady  growth  in  traffic, \ncombined with overloading of vehicles. Overloading control is crucial to maintain roads in good \ncondition during the design-life period of the road. The lack of effective axle load control has led \nto an increased number of overloaded trucks on the roads, which has resulted in the roads \ndeteriorating much quicker  than they  should. Related to  this  issue  is the  lack  of  effective \nregulation(s)  to  provide  updated  policies  and  procedures,  appropriate  institutional  setup, \nfeasible measures, and practical enforcement for monitoring axle load. This is one of the major \nroad maintenance governance issues that needs to be addressed.  \n8.  Insufficient financial resources constrain road maintenance activities. With respect to \nroad maintenance financing  in  Lao  PDR, the main funding  source  is  the  RMF.  The main \nrevenue source of the RMF is from the fuel levy, which accounts for 97% of total revenue.6 The \ntotal revenue of the RMF is about $48 million in 2013. All of the RMF revenue is used to fund \nroad maintenance in the country, with 90% of the RMF fund allocated to road maintenance of \nurban and national roads and 10% of the RMF fund allocated to maintenance of provincial and \nlocal roads. However, the funding level of the RMF is insufficient to meet road maintenance \nneeds, in particular for the provincial road network. The RMF regulation(s), which govern the \nfinancing mechanism and financial management of the RMF, need to be improved to increase \nRMF revenue level and strengthen governance of the RMF usage for ensuring sustainable road \nmaintenance funding. \n9.  Since the funding for road maintenance is limited, prioritization and monitoring of road \nmaintenance activities is crucial for effective road asset management. At present, no centralized \nrecord keeping system exists to provide such information. The absence of such record keeping \nsystem results in a governance issue, leading to difficulty in monitoring and audit of the road \nmaintenance  work.  The  establishment  of  a  road  asset  management  registry  system  with \nconsolidated  information  about  all  stages  of  road  maintenance  work  including  planning, \nbudgeting, procurement, and implementation will facilitate project prioritization and monitoring; \nand will improve governance and transparency.  \n10.  The  poor  road  condition  of  the  road  network  is  also  caused  by  outdated  road \n                                                \n6  Assessment on Road Maintenance Fund (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "3 \nconstruction and maintenance standards, design and construction deficiencies, and inadequate \ninstitutional capacity in road maintenance and road asset management practices. The absence \nof standardized road asset management manuals and updated road construction technical \nspecifications has resulted in poor road construction and maintenance quality as well as design \nand  construction  deficiencies.  Upgrading  and  standardization  of  road  asset  management \nmanuals  and  technical  specification  will  be  essential  to  improving  road  construction  and \nmaintenance standards, thus facilitating the upkeep of roads in good condition. \n11.  Weak  institutional  capacity  for  road  asset  management  contributes  to  poor  road \nconditions. The  project  will  implement  capacity  building  programs for  MPWT and  DPWTs, \nprivate contractors and local communities to strengthen human resource capacity in technical \nissues concerning road asset management planning, implementation and management. The \nstrengthening of institutional capacity will improve the delivery of road asset management by \nconcerned stakeholders.  \n12.  The project will rehabilitate and maintain 327 km of national and local roads in the \nprovinces of Attapu, Salavan, and Xekong. The three provinces are amongst the poorest rural \nprovinces in the country where large proportion of rural poor live. Much of the road network in \nthese three provinces lacks proper maintenance due to limited road maintenance funding. The \nselected road sections for rehabilitation and maintenance are priority in terms of improving \naccess for people in rural areas. Although vital for transport within the provinces of Attapu, \nSalavan, and Xekong, and to cross-border transport and trade, most of these road sections are \nunpaved and/or in poor condition and unable to provide all-year accessibility. The rehabilitation \nand maintenance of these road sections will provide reliable all-year road access from provincial \ntowns and agricultural rural areas to markets, employment centers, and social services in the \nthree provinces, improving socio-economic living conditions of the rural population in the project \nregions.       \n13.  Development coordination. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) collaborated closely \nwith the government and other development partners for the project design. The project builds \non the existing road asset management system and focuses on areas needing improvement. \nThe project design incorporates lessons from other road maintenance projects and innovations \nin road maintenance. This approach ensures nonduplication and harmonization of development \nassistance.  \n14.  Related  policies  and  strategies.  The  project  aligns  with  the  prevailing  Lao  PDR \ntransport policy and strategy, which focusses on \u201crecurrent works in transport infrastructure; \nroad maintenance and asset management.\u201d7 In light of this, the government is committed to \nachieving sustainable road maintenance. The MPWT has been tasked to identify areas needing \nimprovement  for  road  asset  management,  develop  adequate  measures,  review  existing \nregulations  and  laws,  and  propose  actions. This government  initiative  is  a  significant  step \ntowards enabling the Lao PDR to effectively utilize development assistance for better road asset \nmanagement. The project will complement the government\u2019s initiative and support the MPWT in \nrealizing sustainable road maintenance. \n15.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 for the Lao \nPDR and with the government\u2019s Seventh Five-Year National Socio-Economic Development Plan \n(2011\u20132015),  both  of  which  have  the  overarching  objective  of  promoting  inclusive  and \n                                                \n7  Government of the Lao PDR. 2014. Country Report of the Implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action.  \nVientiane. \n ", "4 \nsustainable economic growth and poverty reduction.8 ADB\u2019s 2011 Transport Sector Assessment, \nStrategy, and Road Map for the Lao PDR recognized the need to support road maintenance as \na key component of future ADB assistance to the country\u2019s transport sector.9 The project also \ncaptures the essence of ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative, which promotes a transport \nsystem that is accessible, safe, environment-friendly, and affordable.10 \n16.  Lessons. ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department (IED) identified assistance to the \nMPWT in tackling issues related to capacity development and road maintenance as the primary \narea where ADB performance could be improved.11 IED recently reaffirmed the importance of \nmaintaining the roads in good condition as a follow-up support to the Lao PDR\u2019s transport \nsector.12 Among the key lessons learned from ADB\u2019s experience and road maintenance projects \nfinanced by other development agencies are (i) policy actions on governance issues should be \nbased on realistic assessments of political will and appropriate timing ; (ii) capacity building \nrequires proper planning and adequate targeting; (iii) streamlined approaches to procurement \nfacilitate effective project implementation; and (iv) upfront support to the executing agency on \nADB procedures and information requirements are crucial for effective implementation. These \nlessons have been incorporated in the project design.    \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n17.  The expected impact of the project will be the improved delivery of public services in \nroad  asset  management.  The  outcome  will  be  that  sustainable  road  maintenance  is \nimplemented in the provinces of Attapu, Salavan, and Xekong. \n \nC.  Outputs \n18.  The project will have three outputs. \n \n19.  Output 1: Governance and practice for road asset management improved. This \noutput will provide measures to improve governance and practice. The measures are crucial to \ndelivering  successful  road  asset  management.  They  involve  the  (i)  revision  of  axle-load \nmonitoring regulation(s), (ii) revision of RMF regulation(s), (iii) development of a web-based \nroad  asset  management  registry  for  public  disclosure,  and  (iv) upgrade  of  road  asset \nmanagement manuals and technical specifications. \n \n20.  Output 2: Institutional capacity for road asset management strengthened. This \noutput will bolster national and provincial institutional capacity. It involves (i) strengthening the \ncapacity of the MPWT for road asset management, (ii) improving contractors\u2019 capacity for road \nmaintenance contract tendering and management, and (iii) improving community-based road \nmaintenance capacity. \n \n21.  Output 3: Road asset rehabilitation and maintenance completed. This output will \nrehabilitate and maintain 327 km of selected national and local roads in the provinces of Attapu \n                                                \n8 ADB. 2011.

Implementation Arrangements \n24.  The oversight body for the project will be a steering committee to be chaired by an \nMPWT vice minister. The steering committee will comprise vice governors from the provinces of \nAttapu, Salavan, and Xekong; officials from the MPWT, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Natural \nResources and Environment, and Ministry of Planning and Investment; and provincial DPWTs. \nA regional advisory committee comprising vice governors from Attapu, Salavan, and Xekong \nprovinces, and officials from provincial DPWTs will be established for consultation on provincial \nissues. The executing agency will be  the MPWT and the implementing agency will be  its \nDepartment of Roads (DOR). Provincial DPWTs in Attapu, Salavan, and Xekong will act as \nproject  implementing  units.  DOR  will  have  overall  coordination  responsibility  and  will  work \nclosely with the provincial DPWTs to implement the project. A project team within the MPWT \nand/or DOR will be established to implement the project. The project team will comprise a \nproject manager, three deputy project managers (one each from the target provinces), one \nsocial and environmental monitoring officer from the Public Works and Transport Institute, one \naxle-load and road safety officer from the MPWT\u2019s Department of Transport, and supporting \nstaff from DOR and provincial DPWTs.

The implementation period is April 2016 to March 2021. Civil works construction will start \nin the second quarter of 2017 and end in the first quarter of 2021. The project completion date \nwill be 31 March 2021, and the ADB loan will close on 30 September 2021. \n \n26.  All goods and works will be procured following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as \namended from time to time). Works valued at $3 million or above and goods valued at $1 million \nor above will be procured through international competitive bidding. The government\u2019s public \nprocurement legislation and regulations (as acceptable to ADB) will be applied for packages \nbelow the respective international competitive bidding thresholds; they will be procured using \nnational competitive bidding. For packages below $100,000, goods and works will be procured \nthrough shopping. All consultants will be recruited following ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The draft master bidding documents have \nbeen prepared following ADB\u2019s standard requests for proposals for consulting services, and \nADB\u2019s  standard  bidding  documents  for  goods  and  works  (large  and  small).  The  bidding \ndocuments will be finalized upon completion of the detailed engineering design, which will be \ndone by the project management consultant. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n27.  Work will entail rehabilitation and maintenance of national and local roads. The chosen \nrehabilitation and maintenance activities considered cost, durability, affordability, safety, and \nclimate resilience, and are deemed technically feasible. The maintenance technology involved is \nstraightforward and within the capacities of engineers and contractors available in the Lao PDR. \nAll  civil  works  designs are  compatible  with  standard  MPWT  parameters  and the  available \noperation and maintenance capacity. Contract packaging will attract contractors with suitable \nqualifications and ensure efficient procurement. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n28.  For the economic appraisal, the roads under the project are assumed to receive only \nroutine maintenance in the without-project scenario.16 The economic analysis compared the \nindividual roads\u2019 conditions in the with-project with the without-project scenarios to measure the \nbenefits  from  vehicle  operating  and  time  cost  savings  arising  from  the  project  road \nimprovements. Calculated using these quantified benefits, the project internal rate of return was \nfound to be 17.2% and the net present value of net benefits using a 12% discount rate is $ 5.4 \nmillion.  \n \n29.  Of the project\u2019s mix of national, provincial, and district roads, analysis indicated that \nusers of the local roads, all initially in poor condition, would receive the greater portion of total \nproject benefits. Given that the local roads link produce-growing hinterlands with provincial \n                                                \n16  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nand district markets as well as urban centers, this is a particularly desirable outcome from a \nredistributive as well as a growth perspective. \n \n30.  The executing agency and project owner is a government line ministry, and the project \nis neither revenue generating nor cost recovering by nature, hence the financial analysis \nfocuses on the financial sustainability of the project. The financial analysis assesses the \nexecuting agency\u2019s financial capacity to meet the recurrent costs of operating and maintaining \nthe developed facilities in a sustainable manner. The overall financial position was projected \nfor the fiscal years 2015\u20132025.17 The projection, based on historical income and expenditure \nstatements, confirms the project owner\u2019s financial ability to cover its current costs and sustain \nthe facilities developed under the project. Moreover, the government has assured that it will \nincrease  its  budget  allocation  for  the  MPWT  to  fund  the  incremental  recurrent  costs  of \noperating  and  maintaining  the  project.  The  project  is  considered  financially  sustainable. \nRelevant covenants are included in the draft loan agreement to ensure project sustainability. \n \nC.  Governance \n31.  The  risk  ratings  for  financial  management  and  procurement  are  moderate. \nAssessments of the MPWT\u2019s financial management and procurement capacity confirmed that \nproject implementation arrangements, which follow previous ADB transport-sector projects in \nthe Lao PDR, are appropriate. The MPWT has extensive experience in managing ADB and \nother externally funded projects, and has sufficient capacity to undertake international and \nnational competitive bidding for procurement. Its Department of Finance will adopt a project \nfinancial management system, including internal control procedures, used in ADB- and World \nBank-financed  road  projects.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  established  for  the \nproject, following the successful examples of other ADB-financed road improvement projects \nin the Lao PDR. While incumbent MPWT staff members have experience with ADB guidelines, \nthe implementation of the project will further strengthen the capacity of project staff and \nprovide  on-the-job  assistance  to  ensure  that  procurement,  financial  management,  and \ndisbursements undertaken are acceptable to ADB. An independent external financial auditor \nwill be hired for external auditing of the project accounts. Review missions and regular project \nsupervision  will  monitor  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  reporting  and  external  audit \nrequirements. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government, including the MPWT. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 15). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n32.  The project will result in better access to schools, markets, and health facilities.18 Six \ntraining courses in routine road maintenance and management will be provided to communities \nalong  project  roads,  with  women  comprising  50%  of  trainees.  The  training  sessions  and \nmaintenance tools to be provided to the communities are part of the community development \nsupport for generating local employment and will be carried out voluntarily; they are not part of \nthe government\u2019s routine maintenance activities. Social risks are involved, such as the risk of \nspreading communicable diseases, human trafficking, and an increase in road accidents. To \nmitigate these risks, an HIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness and prevention program, \nand a road safety program are included in the project. These will be designed and implemented \nin a gender-sensitive and culturally appropriate manner. \n                                                \n17  The fiscal year of the Government of the Lao PDR and its agencies ends on 30 September. \n18  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n33.  All safeguard documents were prepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) and will be posted on the ADB website in compliance with disclosure requirements.19 \nInitial consultations with residents, government officials, and civil society confirm broad support \nfor  the  project.  Consultation  with  these  groups  will  continue  throughout  the  project  cycle, \nfollowing the consultation and participation plan and stakeholder communications strategy in the \nproject  administration  manual.  The  project  includes  resources  to  assist  counterparts  in \nimplementing social and environmental safeguards effectively. Monitoring requirements and \nappropriate grievance redress mechanisms are outlined in the safeguards documents. \n \n34.  The project is not anticipated to cause significant adverse environmental impacts and \nhas been classified as environment category B in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared for each project road to \nmeet the requirements of the safeguard policy. The IEE has been disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \nExcept for National Road 18B, none of the roads passes through protected areas. National \nRoad 18B, which was opened to traffic about 10 years ago, traverses 54 km of the core zone of \nthe Dong Amphan National Protected Area (NPA). Only spot rehabilitation will be carried out for \nNational Road 18B due to the relatively good condition of much of the road length and will not \ninvolve widening and tree cutting. The environmental management plan will be incorporated into \nthe project\u2019s civil works contract documentation. Public consultations were conducted for the \nproject, and a grievance redress mechanism will be implemented to facilitate resolution of \nproject-related  environmental  impacts.  Based  on  the  Preliminary  Climate  Risk  Screening \nChecklist, the project is in the medium-risk category.20 Potential flood impacts, erosion, and \nclimate risks were considered during project preparation. Corresponding adaptation measures \nwere identified and included in the project cost estimates and in the design for the roadway, \ndrainage, erosion control, and maintenance, as well as in the institutional aspect. \n \n35.  The project will not entail any land acquisition or restriction of access to land resulting in \nphysical or economic displacement of people. The involuntary resettlement categorization is C. \nThe indigenous peoples categorization for the project is B. National Road 16 and Provincial \nRoad 7615 (Salavan Province) and Provincial Road 9001 (Attapu Province) are dominated by a \nnumber of ethnic groups, such as Hahak, Katu, Lavy, Shuay and Triang, while the Lao Loum \nare  dominant  along  the  remaining  four  project  roads.  An  indigenous  peoples  plan  (ethnic \ncommunities development plan) was prepared and uploaded on the ADB website.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n36.  The  overall  risk  is  assessed  as  medium.  The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 \nand described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21  \n \n \n                                                \n19 ADB. 2011.

ASSURANCES \n37.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and loan documents. The government has agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n38.
