The  Government  of  Viet  Nam  is  well  aware  of \nthe impact of inadequate transport infrastructure on economic growth. Failure to invest in major \npublic  transport  infrastructure  to  support  a  major  modal  shift  away  from  private  transport  in \nmajor  cities  will  constrain  economic  growth  and  accelerate  degradation  of  the  urban \nenvironment.  The  government  supports  transport  sector  investment  to  promote  economic \ngrowth and protect the environment through a low carbon growth path that reduces greenhouse \ngas  emissions. 2  The  2007\u20132010  Viet  Nam  country  strategy  and  program  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)3 supports  the  government's  investment  program  to  improve  urban \ntransport infrastructure and reduce transportation costs. \n \n3. \nHa Noi is Viet Nam\u2019s capital and the second-largest city in Viet Nam; the population of \nthe  greater  urban  area  is  about  6  million,  and  is  expected  to  reach  almost  8  million  by  2025. \nPrivate vehicles dominate transportation, with about 90% of transport modal share. Inadequate \nroad  infrastructure  results  in  heavy  congestion  during  peak  hours,  and  this  will  worsen  when \nmotorbike riders switch to cars as their household incomes improve. While the road network is \nexpanding  slowly,  the  growth  cannot  meet  the  expected  increase  in  demand,  and  most  inner \ncity areas face space limitations on road capacity expansion. Private transport is not sustainable \nas  the  principal  transportation  mode.  A  well-integrated  high  capacity  public  urban  transport \nsystem  is  essential  to  meet  the  demands  of  Ha  Noi,  and  a  metro  rail  system  is  the  most \nappropriate solution for densely populated inner city areas. Without investment in major public \ntransport infrastructure to support a significant modal shift to public transport, economic growth \nwill  be  severely  constrained  and  the  urban  environment  will  deteriorate  due  to  high  logistics \ncosts and severe congestion. Ha Noi is at an early stage of adoption of private motorization, so \ninvestment  in  major  public  transport  infrastructure  represents  an  effective  means  to  reduce \nfuture urban congestion.4 \n \nThe proposed project5 will develop a new double track metro rail line in Ha Noi,6 which is \n4. \none of four priority lines of a planned larger urban transportation system under the Ha Noi Urban \nTransport  Master  Plan  (HUTMP).  Metro  line  3  will  (i) facilitate  public  transport connectivity,  (ii) \ngreatly  enhance  access  in  five  districts  of  Ha  Noi,  and  (iii)  be  an  important  integral  part  of  an \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Viet Nam Socio-Economic Development Plan for 2011\u20132015   \n3  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program: Viet Nam, 2007\u20132010. Manila. \n4   The  same  situation  occurs  in  Ho  Chi  Minh  City,  and  a  metro  system  is  being  concurrently  developed,  for  which \nADB  has  provided  financing,  approving  a  multi-tranche  financing  facility  of  $540  million  on  14  December  2010.  \nADB. 2010.

Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Ha Noi Metro Rail System \n\nProject. Manila (TA 4900-VIE). \n\n\f2 \n\nimproved public transport system, which aims to achieve increased public modal share through \nlow-carbon transport that reduces greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n5. \nHa Noi public transport sector. The existing public transport system consists of a bus \nnetwork that  is  not  well  integrated  between  operators,  is  not  competitive  with  private  transport \nmodes, and has a current modal share of around 10%. Traffic planning and traffic management \nsystems  are  inadequate  to  effectively  control  city  traffic  demand  and  do  not  promote  public \ntransport  usage.  Rapid  growth  in  private  ownership  of  cars  and  motorbikes  has  led  to  heavy \ncongestion  along  major  routes  and  inner  city  areas  that  constrains  accessibility,  resulting  in  a \ndangerous  urban  environment  for  commuters.  As  traffic  levels  increase,  high  volume  public \ntransport modes are required to both alleviate existing congestion and meet expected long-term \ntransportation demand. However, the necessary infrastructure  improvements will be ineffective \nwithout  complementary  policy  and  regulatory  measures  to  both  promote  public  transport  and \ndiscourage private transport modes for city residents and suburban commuters. \n \n6. \nThe  HUTMP  will  (i)  establish  six  metro  lines  as  a  network  crisscrossing  the  central \nbusiness area and serving outer population centers, with  the initial phases of metro lines 1, 2, \n2A, and 3 expected to be operating by 2020; and (ii) strengthen and expand the bus system and \nmake traffic management system improvements, to support a modal shift from private to public \ntransport.  The  key  objective  of  the  plan  is  to  increase  public  transport\u2019s  modal  share  to  45%\u2013\n50%  of  demand. The  resulting  reduction  in the growth  of  private  vehicle  numbers  will  improve \nthe  urban  environment  for  city  residents  by  reducing  accidents,  air  and  noise  pollution;  and \nincreasing the number of pedestrian-friendly urban areas. \n \ntransport \n7. \nimprovements that are proposed up to 2020 are estimated to cost $5.8 billion, consisting of $5.2 \nbillion for four priority metro lines and $0.6 billion for other public transport improvements. The \ncentral government is providing financing for the infrastructure components, and the Ha Noi city \ngovernment  financing  the  operational  equipment  and  systems.  Annual  budgetary  allocations \ncan  meet  less  than  15%  of  the  HUTMP  financing  requirements,  so  this  shortfall  will  require \nfinancing from other sources, such as  international financial institutions and the private sector. \nRecurrent expenditures for public transport services are funded primarily from allocations under \nthe  Ha  Noi  city  budget,  but  sources  of  revenue  are  not  optimized.  Bus  fares  are  kept  low  to \ncompete  with  private  transport, 7  resulting  in  subsidies  for  the  existing  bus  services.  Cost \nrecovery  is  further  reduced  by  the  inefficient  institutional  arrangements  for  establishing, \nallocating,  and  operating  bus  routes.  Improving  public  transport  sustainability  requires  the \nestablishment of high capacity  metro lines to offer an efficient, affordable alternative to private \ntransport, and restriction of private vehicles through economic and other measures. \n \n8. \nThe  project  will  complement  ongoing  developments  in  interconnected  urban  transport \nsystems and public transport management reform, including proposed bus rapid transit lines, to \nmeet  user  demand  for  better  services.  Other  developments\u2014including  proposed  new  feeder \nbus links to the metro system, enhanced integration and accessibility at stations, \"park and ride\" \nfacilities, pedestrian-friendly access, and the institution of policy changes\u2014will be implemented \nconcurrently  through  a  proposed  loan  using  the  Clean  Technology  Fund  (CTF) 8  and  ADB \nfinancing in 2012. \n                                                \n7  Private  transport  costs  are  kept  artificially  low  due  to  pricing  of  private  vehicles,  parking,  and  vehicle  operating \n\nPublic  transport  financing  and  sustainability.  The  HUTMP  public \n\n8  The CTF is part of the multidonor global Climate Investment Fund, which supports low-carbon transport to promote \ngreenhouse gas emission reduction. Under the CTF, 2009  Clean Technology Fund Investment Plan for Vietnam, \nWashington, DC, approved 1 December, $50 million has been allocated from the CTF to support sustainable urban \n\ncosts. \n\n \n\n\f \nLessons.  For  large transport  infrastructure  projects  in Viet  Nam,  experience indicates9 \n9. \nstrong support is required to avoid implementation delays, ensure quality of works are achieved \nand  build  sustainable  institutions.  Poor  local  capacity  affects  timely  implementation  of  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement,  so  adequate  time  and  strengthening  are  important.  These  have \nbeen  incorporated  into  the  project  design  and  through  proposed  technical  assistance  from \ncofinancing partners and proposed ADB financing in 2012. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  the  establishment  of  an  integrated  sustainable  public \ntransport system in five districts of Ha Noi. The outcome will be competitive metro rail services \nalong the project corridor. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n(e.g., \n\ntrack  work, \n\nrolling  stock, \n\nThe  project  outputs  will  be:  (i)  metro  line  3  is  operational;  and  (ii)  improved \n\n11. \nimplementation capacity of Ha Noi Metropolitan Rail Transport Project Board (HRB).  \n \nThe  construction  of  metro  line  3  will  include:  (i)  all  civil  works  for  metro  line  310,  with  a \n12. \ntotal  length  of  12.5  km  (3.6  km  is  underground,  8.4  km  is  elevated,  and 500  m  in  a  transition \nramp) of a dual track rail metro line for phase 1 from Nhon to Ha Noi main railway station,11 and \nincluding  the  depot  with  ancillary  buildings  at  Nhon,  elevated  viaducts,  transition  tunnel  portal, \nbored tunnels, and 12 stations; and (ii) electrical and mechanical (E&M) systems, including all \ntraction  power,  signaling  and \nrailway  systems \ntelecommunications,  E&M  systems  and  facilities,  ticketing  system  and  ancillary  services,  and \nfacilities required to operate a modern metro line). \n \nImproved  implementation  capacity  to  HRB  will  be  provided  to  complete  the  detailed \n13. \ndesign,  procurement  assistance,  and  construction  supervision  for  all  civil  works  and  E&M \nsystems, to be funded by Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tr\u00e9sor (DGT).

The proposed capacity \ndevelopment  will  be  separately  financed  and  implemented  by  ADB, 14  and  will  provide  (i) \nadditional  project  implementation  support,  (ii)  capacity  building  and  training  of  HRB,  and  (iii) \nsustainable transport studies to improve metro integration with the public transport system and \ndetermine policy measures to support increased public transport usage. \n \n19. \nthe project administration manual (PAM).15 \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects  \n\nArrangements \n\nImplementation period \n\n1 July 2011\u201331 December 2015 \n\nEstimated completion date \n\n31 December 2015 \n\nFinancial completion date \n\n30 June 2016 \n\nManagement \n\n \n\n(i) Oversight body \n\nMinistry of Finance \n\n(ii) Executing agency \n\nHa Noi People's Committee \n\n(iii) Key implementing agency \n\nHa Noi Metropolitan Rail Transport Project Board \n\n(iv) Implementation unit \n\nProject Implementation Division 1 (32 staff) \n\nConsulting services \n\nNil \n\n \n\n \n\nInternational competitive bidding \n2 contracts  $232 million \n\nProcurement \n\nDisbursement \n\nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2010,  as \namended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed upon between the government and ADB. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n                                                \n13 The steering committee will include relevant government ministries and the equivalent HPC departments. \n14 The proposed ADB loan, Strengthening Sustainable Urban Transport for Ha Noi Metro Line 3, in the amount of $60 \nmillion  dollars,  will  include  $10  million  for  capacity  development,  which  has  been  agreed  by  the  HPC  and    is \nscheduled for ADB Board consideration in 2012.  \n\n15 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n20. \nThe  Ha  Noi  Urban  Transport  Master  Plan  identified  metro  line  3  as  a  priority  line,  and \nimplementation  is  being  coordinated  closely  with  three  other  metro  lines  being  concurrently \ndeveloped,  with  quarterly  financier  coordination  meetings  held  to  ensure  common  issues  are \nwell  integrated.  The  project  feasibility  study  was  completed  by  DGT-funded  consultants  and \napproved in April 2009 and the detailed design is expected to be completed by June 2011. The \nproject  is  technically  viable,  with  system  technology  choices  based  on  efficient  and  proven \ndesigns,  station  layouts  designed  for  future  integration,  depot  facilities  developed  to  maximize \nland usage and accommodate future extensions, and common technical standards adopted for \ninterlinked facilities between different metro lines. \n \n21. \nFully  integrated  facilities  will  allow  seamless  transfers  at  metro  line  3  stations  to  other \nmetro  lines  or  public  transportation  modes,  and  to  private  transport.  Suitable  integrated \nsustainable  urban  transport  measures  will  be  implemented  under  the  proposed  loan  in  2012, \nwhich  will  address  (i)  integrated  accessibility  at  stations;  (ii)  coordination  with  overall  public \ntransport,  including  bus  routes;  and  (iii)  necessary  policy  measures  to  support  modal  change. \nTo  enhance  metro  system  integration,  the  HPC  is  expected  to  establish  by  2012  a  public \ntransport authority with responsibility for planning, developing and regulating all public transport \nin  Ha  Noi.  Operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  metro  system  will  be  under  a  separate \nagency,  with  HPC  creating  a  steering  committee  in October  2010  to  establish  the metro O&M \nentity by the end of 2012. Options for private sector metro operation will be considered once the \nridership  has  become  stable  to  ensure  investor  risk  is  reduced  and  owner  guarantees  are  not \nrequired. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nThe  project  will  directly  benefit  public  transport  users  and  communities  in  five  districts \nand indirectly benefit all transport users in Ha Noi. The main benefits are derived from improved \naccess to better, safer, cheaper, more reliable, and faster transportation, with additional benefits \nfrom  road  accident  cost  reduction,  deferred  capital  costs  of  public  transport  and  reduced  road \nmaintenance  costs.  Greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  traffic  congestion  will  be  alleviated, \nproviding  social  benefits  that  include  improvements  to  air  quality,  access  to  government \nservices, and community quality of life. \n \n23. \nTransport demand forecasts were prepared for the economic analysis. These cover the \ngreater  Ha  Noi  region,  with  a  combined  population  of  6.4  million  in  2007.  Daily  demand  for \nmetro  line  3  is  forecast  to  be  157,000  loadings  at  opening  in  2016,  increasing  to  458,000 \nloadings  in  2030.The  project  has  an  estimated  economic  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  12.7%  and \neconomic  net  present  value  discounted  at  12%  is  $67.1  million.  While  the  EIRR  is  low,  it  is \ntypical of high-investment long-return projects; significant secondary benefits not included in the \nanalysis  are  logistics  improvements,  increases  in  property  values  and  tax  revenues,  and  the \nhigh  non-transport  congestion  costs  that  would  occur  without  the  project.  The  sensitivity  and \nswitching  value  analyses  show  that  the  EIRR  is  marginal,  even  with  changes  in  user  benefits \nand  in  project  costs  of  5%,  so  there  is  moderate  risk  that  the  entire  project  will  not  reach  the \nEIRR  threshold  of  12%.  While  civil  works  costs  are  at  high  risk  of  increasing  above  5%, \nparticularly for the underground section where actual ground conditions could vary, there is also \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fthe  potential  for  benefits:  the  development  of  the  Ha  Noi  road  network  is  unlikely  to  occur  as \nplanned, and the resultant constrained capacity would increase private vehicle operating costs. \n \nFor  the  financial  analysis,  operating  cost,  but  not  capital  cost, 16 is  covered  by  fare \n24. \nrevenue.  The  base  case  assumes  that,  by  the  start  of  operation,  reorganized  bus  routes  and \nother  integration  measures  to  optimize  public  transport  will  have  been  implemented.  At  the \nassumed fare of D3,300 per boarding, the forecast of strong patronage and annual fare revenue \nin  the  starting  year  (2016)  yields  a  fare  box  ratio17 that  equals  or  exceeds  1.  The  project  is \nanticipated  to  require  a  total  subsidy  over  the  project  life  of  $935  million  and  local  subsidy  of \n$597  million.  The  financial  rate  of  return  after  tax  is  1.8%,  which  exceeds  the  calculated \nweighted average cost of capital of 1.3%. If the urban public transport system optimization does \nnot  materialize,  the  starting  year  daily  fare  revenue  drops  by  40%,  and  the  local  subsidy \nrequired is $830 million, up 35% from the base case, which constitutes a substantial increase in \nthe subsidy burden on the central government. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n25. \nNational  and  local  governance  performance  in  Viet  Nam  has  improved  recently.  Public \nfinance  management  reform  has  brought  increased  disclosure  of  public  accounts,  higher \naccounting  standards,  and  progress  on  budgetary  rules.  The  November  2005  Law  on \nProcurement  and  regulations  in  2006  and  2008  have  established  national  bidding  documents. \nDialogue  continues  with the  government  with  a  view  to  harmonizing  national  and  international \nprocedures.  Measures  to  address  corruption  have  improved,  with  revisions  to  the  Anti-\nCorruption  Law  in  August  2007  that  established  a  national  anticorruption  steering  committee. \nThe  government  is  committed  to  reforming  national  institutions  to  reduce  malfeasance  waste \nand  improve  development  effectiveness.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to \ndate)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  HRB.  Specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nThe  project  will  use  international  competitive  bidding  to  improve  oversight  and  mitigate \n26. \ncorruption,  which \nimplementation  delays  are  avoided  through \ninformation  sharing.  The  bidding  process  will  be  further  enhanced  by  improved  transparency, \ninformation disclosure, oversight and monitoring, mitigation of fraud and collusion risks, handling \nof complaints, and sanctions and remedies. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nimproves  governance \n\nif \n\n27. \nThe  project  is  a  general  intervention  with  indirect  poverty  reduction  impacts.  Major \nbeneficiaries will be public and private transport users, with women, students in universities and \ncolleges along the metro, children, and older people expected to benefit the most from improved \ntransportation,  as  well  as  communities  in  districts  along  the  project  corridor.  Local  economies \nare  expected  to  improve  as  a  result  of  business  opportunities  created  through  improved  and \ncheaper  transport,  and  residents  will  further  benefit  through  improved  quality  of  life  resulting \nfrom reduced congestion and pollution. Other beneficiaries include workers and traders traveling \nbetween the western part of Ha Noi and the central business district and service or commercial \nestablishments near the metro stations. Project districts will benefit from temporary construction \njobs  and  local  employment  in  O&M.  Women  will  be  encouraged  to  work  and  will  be  treated \n                                                \n16 Under Railway Law 2005, the Ha Noi People\u2019s Committee will be responsible for financing rolling stock and E&M \nsystems,  land  and  resettlement,  and  incremental  administration,  so  the  central  government  will  relend  any \nborrowing for these items. All other project works will be provided as grants. \n\n17 Fare revenue divided by O&M cost. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nequitably. HRB will ensure that employment opportunities are announced to local communities \nand will also ensure that contractors conform to appropriate labor laws and standards, including \ntargets for women\u2019s employment. HRB will monitor the use of local labor and appropriate labor \nlaws  and  standards  within  the  first  3  months  of  the  commencement  of  each  construction \ncontract and take appropriate action to improve the employment and compliance if needed. \n \n28. \nThe potential adverse social impacts from the project are (i) increased risks of exposure \nto  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  of  women  and  children  during  construction  and  operation \ndue to the influx of construction workers, and (ii) increased commuter traffic. Safety risks for the \ncommunities  along  the  road  are  expected  to  increase  due  to  the  higher  concentration  of \npedestrians  near  stations.  These  risks  will  be  addressed  through  the  HIV/AIDS  and  human \ntrafficking  awareness  and  prevention  program  and  the  public  transport  safety  program,  to  be \nfunded separately. All civil works contracts under the project incorporate provisions and budgets \nrequiring  that  contractors  carry  out  these  programs,  in  coordination  with  the  government's \nprograms and other initiatives under the proposed capacity building loan. \n \nThe project has been classified as effective gender mainstreaming; a gender action plan \n29. \nhas  been  developed  that  effectively  mitigates  negative  impacts  and  includes  positive  design \nfeatures. The gender action plan will include but not be limited to: (i) use of employment targets \nfor  women  and  gender-specific  core  labor  standards  for  contracts  and  other  employment \ngeneration, (ii) consideration of gender-inclusive physical design features18 in infrastructure, and \n(iii) mitigation of the gender-related resettlement impacts. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n30. \nEnvironment.  The  project  has  been  classified  as  environment  category  A  and  an \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) has been prepared to meet the requirements of ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  An  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  covering  the  depot, \nviaduct and tunnel sections of the project has been prepared. The recommended environmental \nmitigation  measures  and  monitoring  activities  cover  the  preconstruction,  construction,  and \noperation  stages  of  the  project.  Major  issues  addressed  in  the  EMP  pertain  to  spoils  disposal \nand  impacts  on  air  quality  and  noise,  traffic,  culturally  significant  sites  and  undiscovered \narchaeological relics, groundwater quality, and the health and safety of workers and the public. \nThe  EMP  also  specifies  that  the  contractors  shall  develop  and  implement  environmental \nmanagement action plans in the form of specific management plans on dust and noise control, \ntraffic management, spoils disposal, spill management, occupational and community health and \nsafety,  and  emergency  response.  The  EMP  clearly  defines  the  institutional  arrangements  and \nresponsibilities for its implementation and includes an environmental  training program for HRB \nand  its  project  implementation  unit  to  develop  their  environmental  management  capacity. \nSeveral public consultations involving affected households and local officials in the project area \nwere  conducted  during  the  preparation  of  the  EIA.  The  results  of  these  consultations  are \ndocumented in the EIA, while environmental concerns raised are addressed in the EMP. \n \n31. \nA grievance redress mechanism based on existing legal provisions has been developed \nto  facilitate  resolution  of  complaints  regarding  the  project\u2019s  environmental,  resettlement,  and \nother \nthat  the  required  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures  are \nimplemented, HRB shall include the EMP in the bidding documents for civil works. The results \nof semiannual EMP implementation monitoring shall be submitted by HRB to ADB. An external \n\nimpacts.  To  ensure \n\n                                                \n18 Physical design features could include metro stations designed with universal access for women, disabled, elderly, \n\nand others; shopping and trading spaces; and women-only carriages. \n\n\fenvironmental  monitoring  expert  will  verify  the  monitoring  information  submitted  to  ADB  and \nassess if the EMP is being implemented as required. \n \n\n32. \nResettlement.  Resettlement  impacts  are  significant  and  the  project  is  classified  under \ncategory A. In the phase 1 Nhon depot area, there were 234 households (approximately 1,170 \npersons)  affected  by  the  acquisition  of  14  hectares  of  productive  land.  Resettlement  planning \nand  compensation  for  Nhon  Depot  phase  1  started  in  2006,  while  compensation  and  site \nclearing took place from March 2007 to January 2008. Resettlement due diligence was carried \nout and a corrective action plan has been prepared. A resettlement plan for Nhon Depot phase \n2,  the  access  line,  and  the  main  line  has  been  prepared  and  includes  provisions  ensuring \nwomen\u2019s  needs  are given  equal  consideration  as  those  of men.  For  the Nhon Depot  phase  2, \nthe access line, and the main line, it is estimated that there are about 150 displaced persons; 90% \nare households and 10% private companies and government institutions. \n\nIndigenous  people.  The  project  is  classified  under  category  C;  no  further  action  is \n\n33. \nrequired. \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\ninterfaces  and  difficult  construction \n\nThe  project  will  have  several  implementation  risks  as  it  involves  complex  design \n34. \nin \nstandards  with  multiple \nunderground  sections  where  archaeological \nfinds  or  unexploded  ordinance  may  be \nencountered.  Key  risks  include  that  the  metro  line  3  is  completed  in  isolation  of  other  metro \nlines,  and  that  the  operation  of  other  lines  is  not  well  integrated;  this  may  impact  the \nsustainability  of  the  transport  system,  as  the  viability  is  highly  reliant  on  achieving  estimated \npatronage. The risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. \n \n\ntechniques,  especially \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInadequate  public  transport  policies  result \nin  (i)  lack  of  integration  and  planning  of \nmetro  lines,  (ii)  inadequate  public  transport \nin  private \nservices,  and \ntransport usage. \n \nPublic  transport  systems  not  integrated \nbecause  (i)  measures  are  implemented \nineffectively,  and \nfare  pricing \n(ii) \nstructure is not affordable. \n\nincrease \n\nthe \n\n(iii) \n\nWeak  capacity  of  implementing  agency  to \nhandle  cost  increase,  complexity  delays, \nand other implementation issues \n\nLand acquisition delays \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe Ha Noi People\u2019s Committee will (i) expedite policy \nanalysis  and  approval  of \nthe  new  policies  and \nimplementing  regulations,  and  (ii)  provide  support  to \nimplement policy measures with CTF financing. \n\ntransport  authority \n\nThe  CTF-funded  project  in  2012  will  implement  key \nmeasures. \nA  public \nestablished. \nDemand \ndetermined through proposed separate studies. \n \nInternational  experts  will support project management, \ndesign auditing, and value analysis of detailed design. \n\nforecasting  and  pricing  policy  will  be \n\nfor  Ha  Noi  will  be \n\nFull  consultation  and  participation  of  potential  affected \npeoples  will  ensure  agreed  and  acceptable  solutions \nare found. \n\nCTF = Clean Technology Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fProcurement  and  safeguards  due  diligence  constitute  the  greatest  risk  during  project \n35. \nimplementation.  Safeguard  issues  pose  some  risk  as  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is \nrequired  for  all  underground  stations  and  some elevated  facilities.  The  HPC  is  responsible for \nensuring  that  bus  transport  is  significantly  developed  prior  to  the  operation  of  the  metro  lines \nand for policy changes to encourage the use of public over private transport. It is expected that \nbenefits and positive impacts will outweigh any mitigation costs. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n36. \nThe government and the HPC have assured ADB that implementation of the project will \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  PAM  and  loan  documents.
