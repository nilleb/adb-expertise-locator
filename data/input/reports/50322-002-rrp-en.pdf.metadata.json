This  will  reinforce  the  east\u2013west  linear  city \narrangement through connecting key areas following principles of transit-oriented development \n(TOD)  with  higher  density  mixed-use  and  pedestrian-friendly  center  areas  around  the  BRT \nstations. It will integrate nonmotorized transport (NMT) lanes and facilities along the corridor, and \na  series  of  small  roads  and  river  greenways  will  be  provided  to  ensure  safe  and  pleasant \npedestrian and bicycle access to the BRT stations while promoting low-carbon urban mobility and \nphysical activities that enhance public health. The project-supported greenways are designed as \n\u201csponge city\u201d green infrastructure, enhancing climate resilience and urban livability.1 The project \nwill improve the water supply and wastewater management systems to ensure safe and climate-\nresilient access to water supply and improved water quality. Capacity development will contribute \nto  the  preparation  of  action  plans  to  demonstrate  Yanji  as  a  low-carbon,  climate-resilient,  and \nhealthy city, contributing to the implementation of the Healthy China 2030 program,2 and lessons \nand knowledge will be shared with other developing member countries.\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT\n\n4. \nYanji  city  is  part  of  the  Yanbian  Korean  Autonomous  Prefecture  in  the  east  of  Jilin \nprovince, bordering the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the southeast and the Russian \nFederation  to  the  northeast.  Yanji  is  an  ancient  city  on  the  Buer  Hatong  River  surrounded  by \nhills,  and  its  easternmost  border  is  about  15  kilometers  (km)  from  the  sea.  Yanji\u2019s  total \npopulation  was  about  0.60  million  in  2018  (about  0.48  million  of  whom  are  urban)  with  about \n50.2% being ethnic Koreans, who are well-integrated and live in harmony with the Han Chinese.3 \nThe total land area is 1,748 square kilometers.4 In 2017, the city\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) \nwas CNY33.6 billion and GDP per capita was CNY61,431. The contributions to the GDP by main \nsectors  in  2017  were  agriculture  (1.4%  of  GDP  in  2017),  manufacturing  (36.8%),  and  services \nindustry  (61.8%).  Yanji  is  affected  by  the  regional  economic  decline  of  the  northeastern  PRC, \nand  the  city  relies  mainly  on  tourism  and  associated  services,  processing  of  agricultural \nproducts, and logistics services.\n\n1  Sponge city is a concept of comprehensive urban water resources management, in which greenways, parks, and \nwetlands maximize ecosystem services, including storm water management, using ecosystem-based adaptation. \n\n2  Government of the PRC, State Council. 2016. The Healthy China 2030. Beijing. \n3  Population information of 2018 was collected directly from all the districts, townships, and local communities. \n4  Chaoyangchuan township, previously administered by Longjing city, was included under the administration of Yanji \n\nin 2008, thus contributing to the rural population increase. \n\n\fKey development challenges. The city suffers from inadequate urban infrastructure and \n5. \nprovision of basic services that cause inconvenience and disruptions to daily life, especially for \nwomen.  This  includes  inefficient  public  transport,  traffic  congestion  and  poor  parking \nmanagement, urban and river flooding, and inefficient water supply and wastewater management. \n \n6. \nUrban  roads  suffer  from  traffic  congestion,  especially  during  rush  hours,  and  missing \nnetwork  links.  Many  elements  of  the  road  network  and  intersections  pose  safety  problems  for \nvehicles and people. There is a lack of safe bicycle lanes, sidewalks, and pedestrian crossings in \nmany  areas.  Many  cars  are  parked  on  sidewalks,  creating  obstacles  for  and  safety  risks  to \npedestrians. The increase of private cars leads to worsening traffic, increased air pollution and \nless healthy lifestyles with people walking less. In 2017 there were a total of 152,000 cars in Yanji, \nwhich is about 300 vehicles per 1,000 urban residents, and an increase from 96,000 units in 2012. \nTraffic  management  and  signal  control  is  outdated  with  suboptimal  and  unsafe  intersections, \nespecially in the congested urban core. The public transport system is inefficient, inconvenient, \nand unsafe; buses jam in bus stop areas and people get on and off on the streets. Further, there \nis an urgent need to upgrade and extend public transport into the periphery. Currently, 43 bus \nroutes traverse six roads with a total route length of 490 km and a daily ridership of about 243,000 \npassengers. The public transport system does not match the needs of a growing population and \nmay cause reduced ridership due to an increase in private vehicle use as people switch modes \nbecause of unreliable public transport service and bus shelters that lack weather protection. \n \n7. \nFlooding is a significant problem during the rainy season in June\u2013July, with flooding for \nabout 5 days per year on average in recent years. River flooding, flash floods, and urban flooding \nendanger  lives,  property,  and  livelihoods,  and  pose  disturbances  to  traffic  and  public  life.  The \ncombined sewer and drainage pipe system is outdated, with a total network length of 326 km, \ncomprising  110  km  of  sewers,  40  km  of  drainage  pipes,  and  176  km  of  combined  sewer  and \ndrainage pipes. Only 11.6% of the pipe network meets the domestically required 1-in-3 year flood \ndesign standard, causing pluvial flooding during heavy summer rains. The Chaoyang River urban \ncatchment area is currently exposed to flood risks of 1-in-20 year flood events. \n \n8. \nYanji city\u2019s water supply system is inefficient. It has two water reservoirs and two water \ntreatment plants with a total combined treatment capacity of 210,000 cubic meters (m3) per day; \n150,000  m3/day  of  treated  water  meets  national  water  quality  standards  and  is  provided  as \ncontinuous round-the-clock service to end users. The system covers about 98% of the urban area \nand population with 348 km of water distribution pipes, 91 booster pumps, and around 215,000 \nwater meters. The key challenge is the high level of nonrevenue water (NRW) which was 46% in \n2017, comprising 9% in commercial losses and 37% in physical water losses mainly because of \naging pipes that were laid in the 1930s and 1970s. It is difficult to detect leaks in deeply buried \npipes because of cold climate conditions and incomplete information on pipe locations because \nof missing and unreliable maps of the old pipe system and poor geographic information system \n(GIS) management. While  the  city  benefitted  from  a  previous  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nloan,  the  above  challenges  remain.5 Wastewater  is  collected  and  treated  at  two  wastewater \ntreatment plants with a combined capacity of 150,000 m3/day. Tariffs for domestic water users \nare CNY3.20/m3 for water supply and an additional CNY0.95/m3 for wastewater. \n \n9. \nStrategic fit. The project will support urban livability of a medium-sized city, contributing \nto ADB\u2019s strategic support to the PRC\u2019s revitalization and strengthening of the northeast including \n\n5  ADB.  People's  Republic  of  China:  Jilin  Urban  Environmental  Improvement  Project.  The  project  supported  water \n\ntreatment plants, transmission pipes, wastewater treatment plant, and central heating system improvement. \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nfour cities in East Heilongjiang, north of Yanji.6 Through its strategic and integrated approach, the \nproject will support (i) the thirteenth five-year plans of Jilin province and Yanji city, 2016\u20132020;    \n(ii) the PRC\u2019s National New-Type Urbanization Plan, 2014\u20132020, aligning with Yanji\u2019s investment \nprogram  as  one  of  the  PRC\u2019s  pilot  cities;7 and  (iii)  Yanji\u2019s  urban  and  economic  development \nmaster plan (2009\u20132030) and transport master plan.8 The proposed project is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan for the PRC, 2018\u20132020 and is aligned with ADB\u2019s (i) country \npartnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  2016\u20132020,  supporting  socially  inclusive,  environmentally \nsustainable, and economically competitive development; and (ii) ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational \npriority on livable cities, and support to upper middle-income countries by (a) providing integrated \nsolutions  for  a  livable  city  demonstrating  low-carbon  climate-resilient  healthy  city  development \ngenerating  synergies  and  cobenefits,  contributing  to  regional  public  goods,  (b)  enhancing \nresilience  to  climate  change  shocks  and  stresses  including  reducing  flood  risk  and  increasing \nwater safety and security, (c) strengthening institutional knowledge and capacity building, and (d) \nsharing best practices and innovation experiences for south\u2013south cooperation.9 \n \n10. \nLessons learned. The project continues the more than 23 years of strategic partnership \nbetween  Jilin  province  and  ADB  in  areas  of  masterplanning,  environmental  improvement  and \nurban  infrastructure,  among  others.  The  project  incorporates  lessons  from  independent \nevaluation reports and similar ADB projects in Jilin province.10 It will support the sustainability of \na previous ADB-financed project in Yanji (footnote 5) which supported (i) water supply system \nconstruction including a water treatment plant, raw water transmission pipes, water mains, and \ndistribution pipes; and (ii) central heating improvements, which led to significant improvement in \nair quality and public health because of the closure of about 330 inefficient coal-fired boilers, which \nresulted in an increase in class II air quality standards from 285 days in 2006 to 334 days in 2012. \nThe BRT component is expected to further improve air quality. Lessons were incorporated from \nsustainable  urban  transport  projects,  i.e.,  in  Gansu  Lanzhou,  Hubei  Yichang,  and  Shandong \nJinan, including the benefits of (i) integration of BRT with NMT improvements on enhanced BRT \nuse,  and  (ii)  overall  improved  urban  transport  sustainability  and  livability  from  reduced  air  and \nnoise  pollution  and  enhanced  traffic  flow  and  safety.11 Lessons  from  flood  risk  management \nprojects,  like  in  Jiangxi  Pingxiang,  include  that  green  sponge  city  infrastructure  yields  multiple \nbenefits such as effective flood defense and water infiltration and cleansing, increased biodiversity \nand enhanced recreation functions, and promotion of more walking and cycling.12 Lessons are \napplied  from  technical  assistance  projects  such  as  adequate  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  for \nfinancial  sustainability,  effective  urban  storm  water  management,  and  urban  climate  change \nadaptation.13 \n\n \n\n6  ADB.

This  output  will  improve  the  water supply \n15. \nsystem,  including  (i)  installing  about  330  flow  meters  for  hydraulic  zones  and  district  metering \narea management, and installing about 4,000 smart water meters in older residential areas; and \n(ii) upgrading and replacing about 32 km of water supply pipes, including building up hydraulic \nzones. This follows two already completed phases of an improvement program of the water supply \nsystem wholly carried out by the city-owned water group company. This is expected to reduce \nNRW from the current 46% to 37% during project implementation, conserving about 4.8 million \nm3 of water resources each year as a result of the project, as part of the water group company\u2019s \noverall plan to reduce NRW to 20% by 2030. Further NRW reductions will be enabled through a \ncapacity  development  and  utility  twinning  program  under  output  4,  and  proposed  further \ninvestments may be included in the contract packages of this output as appropriate.  \n \nOutput  4:  Capacity  in  low-carbon,  climate-resilient,  healthy  city  planning,  and \n16. \ninfrastructure  management  developed.  This  output  will  support  project  management  and \nquality assurance; external safeguards monitoring; and capacity development for inclusive and \ngender-sensitive  low-carbon,  climate-resilient,  and  healthy  city  planning  and  implementation \nincluding  smart-city  ICT  application  to  enhance  the  sustainability  of  the  project.  Activities  will \ninclude  support  to  and  capacity  development  in  (i)  project  implementation,  management,  and \nmonitoring;  (ii)  low-carbon  city  and  TOD  planning;  traffic  impact  assessment  and  evaluation; \nparking management planning; BRT operation capacity development and network planning; and \npedestrian,  bicycle  system,  and  universal  design  masterplan  preparation;  (iii)  urban  climate \nchange adaptation and sponge city action planning, open space planning, and hydraulic modeling \nand  simulation;  (iv)  healthy  and  age-friendly  city  master  planning  and  health  monitoring, \ncontributing to Healthy China 2030 (footnote 2); (v) water safety planning; NRW reduction and \nleakage identification and management; and development of an integrated water management \nsystem  including  smart  systems  using  cloud  data,  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition \n(SCADA), GIS, and asset management systems as part of smart-city applications; and (vi) GIS \nplatform  development  and  smart-city  implementation  action  planning.  Lessons  and  knowledge \nwill be shared with other developing member countries in the form of guidelines for replication \nand knowledge-sharing events in Yanji and reports to international and domestic conferences. \n \nC. \n \n17. \nADB provides an innovative, spatially integrated solution to low-carbon, climate-resilient, \nhealthy  city  planning,  and  infrastructure  investment  prioritization  and  finance  to  optimize \ncobenefits  across  sectors  aiming  at  urban  livability.  Specifically,  ADB  value  addition  includes          \n(i)  TOD-based  integrated  urban  planning  was  introduced  to  enable  higher  density  mixed-use, \npedestrian-friendly areas, which reduces traffic demand and promotes the use of public transport \nthrough  proximity  and  links  of  housing  with  commercial  businesses,  job  centers,  and  public \nservices, including health facilities and schools, which reduces air pollution and greenhouse gas \nemissions;  (ii)  best  practices  in  BRT  corridor  and  station  planning  and  design  were  provided \nbased on detailed surveys, which will be further enhanced by traffic impact assessment, traffic \nand  parking  management  plans,  and  investment  in  intelligent  transport  system  equipment;            \n(iii) a detailed digital hydraulic model was developed for the project and piloted as an expert tool \nthat simulates future storm scenarios and adaptation options integrating underground drainage \npipe  network  improvements  with  at-grade  sponge  city  green  infrastructure.  Improvements  to \ndrainage  and  flow  capacity,  combined  with  increased  stormwater  retention  and  infiltration \ncapacity,  were  quantified,  visualized,  and  evaluated  to  optimize  flood  risk  reduction  and \ninvestments  and  green  space  benefits;  and  (iv)  water  utility  corporate  governance  and  NRW \nreduction assessment and technology was introduced, and effective NRW will be implemented. \n \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n \n\n\fA health impact assessment (HIA) following the ADB Health Sector Group\u2019s guidance was \n18. \nprepared to assess and enhance expected health benefits of the project, e.g., water and air quality \nimprovements;  noise  reductions;  and  healthier  lifestyles  enabled  through  more  use  of  public \ntransport,  walking, cycling,  and  generally  more  physical  activity from  sponge  city  open  spaces \nand  river  greenways.  Health  benefits  were  further  facilitated  by  applying  universal  design \nprinciples  to  public  spaces  and  facilities,  benefitting  especially  elderly  and  physically  impaired \npeople, women, and children.16 A pilot healthy and age-friendly city action and monitoring plan \nwill  be  prepared  during  project  implementation  to  support  the  Healthy  China  2030  program \n(footnote 2). Further, smart-city infrastructure using high-level ICT and a big data platform using \nthe Internet of Things and artificial intelligence to integrate and manage data for the investment \ncomponents  and  aiming  at  higher  levels  of  cross-sector  integration  in  Yanji  was  introduced, \nincluding intelligent transport system equipment, smart water metering, and using data to alert of \nunusual consumption patterns that may be related to changing health, especially of the elderly. \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  \u20ac234.77  million  (Table  1).

Design  options \nwere compared and the best possible technologies with the lowest cost, environmental, and social \nimpacts  were  selected.  Baseline  data  was  collected  and  proposed  climate  change  adaptation \nmeasures  specialists  were  incorporated,  including  (i)  structural  measures  like  drainage  pipe \nsystem layout improvements, sponge city green infrastructure, and increasing the flow capacity \nof project rivers and creeks; and (ii) nonstructural measures. The proposed capacity development \nis based on a needs assessment for the successful implementation and sustainable operation of \nthe project and to support Yanji to become a model low-carbon, climate-resilient, healthy city. \n \nB. \n \nAn economic analysis for the project was prepared following ADB guidelines.18 Economic \n25. \nviability  of  the  project  was  confirmed  under  various  sensitivity  scenarios.  Benefits  considered \ninclude (i) improved public transport, reduced carbon emissions from modal switch from cars to \npublic transport and from clean-energy bus use, increased savings in vehicle operating costs and \ntravel time, reduced road traffic accidents, and health benefits; (ii) improved flood protection and \navoided damage; improved surface water quality; increased carbon sequestration; improved and \nexpanded  urban  green  spaces,  tree  planting,  and  landscaping;  and  reduced  wastewater \ntreatment  costs;  and  (iii)  improved  water  supply  and  water  use  efficiency,  and  reduced  water \nleakage.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  overall  project  was  calculated  at  27.1%, \nwhich is well above the 9.0% economic opportunity cost of capital. It drops to 25.4% if capital and \noperating costs increase by 10.0%, to 25.2% if benefits decrease by 10.0%, to 23.6% if the two \nassumptions are combined, to 24.4% with a 1-year delay in the benefits, and to 21.4% if the 1-\nyear delay in benefits is combined with a 10% cost increase and 10% benefit decrease. \n \nThe financial analysis is conducted to assess the financial viability and sustainability of the \n26. \nproposed project in accordance with ADB guidelines.19 The financial evaluation of the BRT as the \nrevenue-generating component results in a financial internal rate of return of 7.31%, exceeding \n\n18 ADB. 2017.

The \n\nthe average weighted cost of capital of 5.25%, and the sensitivity analysis indicated that it remains \nfinancially viable under all considered scenarios. The financial statements analyses demonstrate \nthat  the  project  implementation  unit  of  the  BRT  has  adequate  financial  capacity  to  cover  the \nincremental recurrent costs for operation and maintenance. The financial sustainability analysis \nindicated that the YCG (the end borrower) has sufficient financial resources to cover the recurrent \ncost and debt repayment. Therefore, the project is considered financially sustainable. \n \nC. \n \n27. \nProject  outcomes  and  outputs  will  be  maintained  over  the  project\u2019s  economic  life,  and \nmitigation  of  potential  risks,  i.e.,  suboptimal  BRT  operation  and  financial  management,  will  be \nthrough  comprehensive  capacity  building  and  institutional  strengthening  provided  by  output  4. \nThe YCG\u2019s suitable local government arrangement, with the development and reform commission \nleading the project management office, and its strength coordinating projects across departments \nwill be further strengthened. The healthy and green infrastructure will likely contribute to medium- \nand long-term sustainability of natural resources, reduced pollution, and enhanced biodiversity. \n \nD. \n \n28. \nFinancial management. The financial management premitigation risk is rated moderate \nbased on the assessed internal control environment, experience in implementing development \nprojects,  supervisory  procedures,  and \nfinancial  management \nassessment conducted for the YCG, transport bureau, housing and construction bureau, traffic \npolice department, Chaoyangchuan township government, and Yanji Water Group Company was \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management Technical Guidance Note,20 and covered funds \nflow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  internal  and  external \nauditing  arrangements,  and  financial  information  systems.  Risk  mitigation  measures  include \ntraining on financial management and disbursement for executing and implementing agency staff. \n \n29. \nProcurement. The overall assessment of the project procurement risk is moderate. The \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  bring  significant  experience  of  national  procurement. \nHowever, none of the agencies have previously been involved in procurement of projects funded \nby foreign entities such as by ADB. Proposed mitigation measures include training of staff of the \nimplementing agencies and other stakeholders during project implementation. \n \n30. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, the YCG, and the implementing agencies. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 17). \n \nE. \n \n31. \nIn  2018,  the  project  population  in  the  six  subdistricts  and  three  towns  of  Yanji,  where \ninvestments  are  located,  was  about  0.59  million,  of  which  0.48  million  or  81.4%  were  urban \ninhabitants, 0.11 million or 18.6% were rural inhabitants, 0.30 million or 50.9% were women, and \n0.31  million  or  52.5%  were  ethnic minorities.  According to  the  poverty  and  social  analysis, the \nmain cause of poverty is unemployment and underemployment because of insufficient new job \nopportunities created by unbalanced and inadequate industrial and agricultural development in \nYanji. A total of 13,137 poor and low-income people living in the project areas will benefit from \nthe project. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n20 ADB. 2015. Financial Management Technical Guidance Note: Financial Management Assessment. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe project will benefit about 0.59 million people through improved (i) urban mobility with \n32. \nBRT  and  NMT  systems;  (ii)  road  safety  through  traffic  management;  (iii)  public  health, \nenvironment, pollution (water, air, and noise), flood risk, sponge city greening, and water supply \nand  wastewater  management;  and  (iv)  employment,  with  about  1,683  new  jobs  during  project \nimplementation, comprising about 508 management and technically skilled positions and about \n1,175 unskilled positions. The project directly responds to issues raised by the poverty and social \nassessment  through  designs  that  are  sensitive  to  issues  of  gender  and  disabled  people, \nespecially in the BRT and NMT systems. The project will further enhance social inclusiveness, \nwith improved public facilities and environment benefitting all Yanji residents and tourists. A public \nawareness  and  education  program  is  included  in  the  social  and  gender  action  plan  (SGAP),21 \nparticularly to address risks and needs of vulnerable groups such as poor people and women. \n \nGender benefits. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming and will \n33. \nhave  significant  benefits  for  women,  who  are  primarily  burdened  with  household  and  family \nresponsibilities. Women are more concerned with water supply and sanitation quality, and also \nuse public transport more often than men as a result of their responsibilities, combining household \nwork  with  travel  to  a  workplace.  Women  consider  improvements  in  traffic  safety,  better  public \ntransport, and NMT as important benefits to enhance accessibility, safety, and comfort of public \ntransport. The majority of female respondents support the project as it will enhance their quality \nof life through improved urban environment and generation of job opportunities for themselves \nand  family  members.  The  SGAP  will  help  ensure  women\u2019s  participation  in  public  hearings; \nawareness raising;  and economic,  social,  and  decision-making  activities  related  to  the  project, \nincluding (i) job opportunities during construction of 20% (of which 25% are skilled and managerial \npositions) and operation of 30% (of which 30% are skilled and managerial positions); (ii) gender-\nresponsive  physical  design;  (iii)  awareness  raising  and  project-related  public  consultations  on \nenvironmental protection, road safety, and flood risk management (50%); (iv) capacity building of \ngovernment  staff  (40%);  and  (v)  inclusive  and  gender-sensitive  action  plans  on  a  low-carbon, \nclimate-resilient healthy city. SGAP implementation will be ensured by an assurance in the project \nagreement, through a social and gender development specialist to be engaged under output 4, \nand SGAP monitoring will be carried out twice a year by an external agency. \n \nF. \n \n34. \nsafeguard categories are as follows.22 \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  including \n35. \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) was prepared in accordance with the SPS on the basis \nof three domestic environmental impact assessment reports, a feasibility study report, site survey \nfindings, and technical due diligence and studies by ADB. The project is expected to have positive \nimpacts on the environment and reduce emissions and flood risk, while creating a more livable \ncity. Anticipated impacts during construction include short episodes of increased noise and dust \npollution during earthworks, site preparation, access road upgrade, and concrete mixing. Traffic \nmanagement during construction may lead to short-term disturbance and increased noise and air \npollution.  Other  potential  impacts  during  construction  include  soil  erosion,  surface  water \ncontamination, and potential occupational health and safety risks to workers. Construction-related \nimpacts are expected to be temporary and will be minimized by stringent site management and \nprocedural  provisions  in  the  EMP.  Environmental  protection  clauses  will  be  included  in  works \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS,  2009),  the  project\u2019s \n\nSafeguards \n\n21 Social and Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 ADB.

Potential impacts from operation are mainly air pollution, \nnoise,  wastewater,  and  waste  which  are  considered  in  the  IEE,  and  mitigation  measures  and \nmonitoring  are  included  in  the  EMP.  The  government  will  recruit  consultants  to  assist \nimplementation and compliance and conduct external monitoring. Meaningful consultations were \nconducted  during  project  preparation  with  all  relevant  stakeholders  and  the  findings  were \nincorporated in the project. Consultation will continue throughout implementation. Environmental \ncomplaints or disputes will be handled through a grievance redress mechanism established for \nthe project. The IEE and EMP were disclosed on the ADB website in May 2019. \n \n36. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). The project will permanently acquire 50.68 mu \nof land, comprising 28.64 mu of village collective cultivated land, 3.23 mu of an unused village-\nowned fish pond, and 18.81 mu of unused village collective land.23 Structure demolition impacts \nwill be limited to 200 square meters of an abandoned nonresidential structure owned by the village \ncollective  of  Yilan town. The  project  will  affect  80  households  with  268  people  and  not  involve \ndemolition of houses, shops, enterprises, or institutions. Agriculture is not the source of livelihood \nof  affected  people  losing  collective cultivated  lands,  and the  impacts  on household  incomes  is \nless than 5% for all 80 affected households. A draft resettlement plan was prepared following the \nlaws and regulations of the PRC, Jilin province, Yanji city, and the SPS. The local government \nwill  be  responsible  for  compensation  and  provision  of  support  and  assistance  prior  to  land \nacquisition activities. Due diligence of land acquisition and compensation confirmed that there are \nno past or present concerns related to impacts on involuntary resettlement for an area of the BRT \ncorridor  where  land  acquisition  was  completed  by  the  YCG  in  2018.  During  implementation, \ntraining on ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy and procedures will be provided to the project \nmanagement office and resettlement management staff. An external agency will be engaged for \nsemiannual external monitoring and evaluation. \n \n37. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  In  the  six  subdistricts  and  three  towns  where \ninvestments are located, there are 308,902 ethnic minority people, accounting for 52.4% of total \nproject  area  population,  among  which  50.9%  are  Korean  minorities.  The  poverty  and  social \nanalysis identified that ethnic Koreans are socially and economically not vulnerable. The project \nwill be implemented mostly in urban areas, where all minority groups are well integrated with the \nHan  population.  All  ethnic  minorities  and  groups  will  benefit  equally  from  the  project  and  no \nadverse impacts are envisaged. \n \n38. \nHealth impact assessment. A rapid HIA of the project was carried out according to ADB\u2019s \nframework  (footnote  16).  Cardiovascular  diseases,  hypertension,  and  diabetes  are  currently \nprevalent health burdens in Yanji, as well as injuries and casualties from traffic accidents. During \nconsultations, residents\u2019 concerns  were  lack  of  open  and  green  spaces, poor  pavements,  and \nsidewalks with parked cars causing lack of opportunities for physical activity. The HIA confirmed \nthat the project addresses key health concerns of residents and its contribution to improved public \nhealth. The BRT, NMT, and sponge city facilities will enable more physical exercise and walking, \nincluding for vulnerable groups, as they will provide a safer and more attractive environment for \npedestrians and cyclists. The project will reduce traffic accidents and exposure to air and water \npollution.  Sponge  city  green  infrastructure  will  provide  attractive  open  space  for  exercise  and \nimproved  livability,  improved  microclimate,  and  reduced  risk  of  flooding.  Capacity  building  to \nprepare a healthy city masterplan under output 4 will contribute to making Yanji a pilot healthy \nand age-friendly city with broad positive impacts. \n\n \n23 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nG. \n \n39. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nDelay in optimal bus rapid transit system \noperation and effective parking \nmanagement because of lack of capacity \nof the operator and limited willingness to \nenforce parking policies. \nPMO and PIU staff lack experience in \nimplementing ADB-financed projects, \nespecially on procurement and financial \nmanagement. \nPMOs and PIUs experience frequent \nturnover of trained staff. \nAbout 50% of YCG revenue comes from \nthe JPG. While fund transfers for project-\nrelated costs are predictable, this reliance \non JPG support may be a general risk to \nthe financial sustainability of YCG. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, JPG = Jilin provincial government, PIU = project implementation unit, PMO = project \nmanagement office, YCG = Yanji city government. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nThe YCG will ensure adequate staff and budget resources per the loan \ncovenants. The project will provide capacity development to improve \nmonitoring and management of bus rapid transit, flood risk, sponge city \ninfrastructure, water supply, drainage, and rivers. It will also provide \ninstitutional support for prudent operational practices and training. \nThe JPG and YCG implementing agencies have committed to fulfilling \nADB\u2019s requirements for procurement and financial management. The \ntendering agency and project implementation consultants will provide \ncapacity development on procurement and financial management. \nProject implementation consultants will provide training on ADB \nrequirements at regular intervals. \nA budget law from 2014 and ensuing regulations on local government \nfinancial management, and debt management and debt ceiling policies, \nhave been passed. Over the past 3 years, regulations were further \nstrengthened, and implementation has been monitored and enforced \nclosely by the JPG and the Ministry of Finance. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n40. \nThe government and the YCG have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB requirements, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, financial management, and disbursement \nas described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n41. \nwhich are set forth in the draft loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n\nThe government and the YCG have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n42. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n\u20ac117,480,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Jilin Yanji Low-Carbon Climate-Resilient \nHealthy City Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility; for a term of 25.5 years, including a grace period of 6 years; and such other terms and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements presented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n13 November 2019 \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nInclusive, environmentally sustainable, and competitive development of Yanji city achieved (Yanji City General Urban \nMaster Development Plan)a \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n13 \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \na.
