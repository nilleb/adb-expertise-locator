The summary IEE is in Appendix 7.  \n \nThe Project was developed within the context of the Government's \n6th National Development Plan, and focuses on poverty reduction; \ncommunity  development;  and  improvements  in  water  supply, \nland \nsanitation  services,  solid  waste  management,  and \nmanagement. The Project combines the three principal thrusts of \npolicy  improvements,  capacity  building,  and  investment  facilities. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  on  three  focus  islands  (Naifaru-\nLhaviyani,  Mahibadhoo-Alif  Dhaal,  and  Fonadhoo-Laamu  atolls). \nNaifaru and Fonadhoo islands were reported to have been highly \nimpacted  by  the  2004  tsunami.  The  Project  will  help  the \nGovernment  deliver  basic  infrastructure  services  to  the  outer \nislands  more  efficiently  through  institutional  reform,  and  will \nconsolidate  systems  to  recover  costs  and  provide  waste  and \nsanitation  management  services.  The  Project  has  a  strong \ncommunity-based  approach  to  implementation  and  will  provide \ntangible  support  to  optimize  participation  of  the  private  sector  by \nestablishing cooperatives for operation and maintenance. \n \nPoverty in the Maldives stems primarily from regional disparities in \nliving  conditions  related  to  remoteness  of  the  islands  and  lack  of \ninfrastructure  and  social  services \nisland \necosystems  are  among  the  most  vulnerable,  and  suffer  rapid \ndepletion  and  pollution  of  groundwater,  pollution  of  the  coastal \nenvironment  due  to  inadequate  sewage  and  solid  waste  disposal, \nand  marine  resource  depletion.  Environmental  degradation  can \nrender  an  island  uninhabitable,  increase  its  vulnerability  to  natural \ndisasters, and impact on key economic sectors, particularly tourism \nand fisheries. Problem analysis reveals that (i) basic infrastructure \nis  largely  inadequate  on  the  outer  islands  to  provide  safe  drinking \nwater, and to prevent groundwater, marine and terrestrial pollution, \nand  health  hazards;  (ii)  regional  planning  is  deficient  due  to  the \nabsence  of  implementing  basic  instruments  such  as  land-use  and \neconomic  planning,  and  environmental  management  for  resource \nprotection  and  health  preservation;  and  (iii)  management  capacity \nat the regional, atoll, and island levels requires strengthening.  \n\nthe  atolls.

The  Project\u2019s  objective \nimprove \nenvironmental  and  land  management  through  a  community-\ncentered  approach.  The  Project  has  three  closely  interrelated \n(ii) \ncomponents: \nstrengthening  planning  and  environmental  management;  and  (iii) \nbuilding management and implementation capacity in the Central \nRegions. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies, is estimated at $7.5 million equivalent. Of the total \ncost,  $5.38  million  (71%)  comprises  the  foreign  exchange  cost, \nand $2.12 million equivalent (29%) the local currency cost.  \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of  $6 \nmillion  equivalent  from  its  Asian  Development  Fund  resources. \nADB  will  finance  80%  of  the  costs,  including  the  entire  foreign \nexchange  cost  and  29%  of \nlocal  currency  cost.  The \nGovernment and the beneficiaries will finance the remaining $1.5 \nmillion equivalent of local costs. \n \n\nthe \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  $6  million  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB) \nSpecial  Funds  resources  will  be  provided.  The  loan  will  have  a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest \ncharge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe  Loan  Agreement.  The  Borrower  will  be  the  Government  of \nMaldives. \n \nUntil 31 March 2011 \n \n30 September 2010 \n\nimplementation  period \n\n \nThe  project \nis  5  years.  A  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) under the Ministry of Atolls Development \n(MOAD)  will  be  set  up  in  Mal\u00e9,  and  three  project  implementation \nunits  (PIUs)  will  be  set  up  on  each  of  the  three  project  focus \nislands.  A  national  project  steering  committee  will  be  established \nto  guide  policy  decisions  and  operational  issues.  A  regional \nproject  advisory  committee  will  be  established  on  each  of  the \nfocus  islands  to  advise  on  atoll  development  coordination.  Close \ncoordination  with  units  working  on  tsunami  recovery  will  be \nsought. \n \nMinistry of Finance and Treasury \n \n\n\fProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n  v\n\nfor \n\nfor \n\nthe  catchment  rehabilitation  under \n\nGoods,  related  services,  and  civil  works  to  be  financed  from  the \nloan proceeds will be procured in accordance with Guidelines for \nProcurement  by  the  ADB  and  its  Borrowers  and  Government \nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB. Procurement will be \ncarried out by the PIUs under the PMU\u2019s guidance. The sanitation \nschemes will be integrated into combined design and supervision, \nand  supply  and  construction  packages \ninternational \ncompetitive  bidding.  Equipment  packages  valued  at  $500,000 \nequivalent or less will be procured following international shopping \nprocedures acceptable to ADB, and packages valued at $100,000 \nequivalent or less will be under direct purchasing procedures. Civil \nworks  contracts \nthe \nrainwater tank component for values less than $15,000 equivalent \nwill \nin \nfollow  ADB's  Guide  on  Community  Participation \nProcurement. \n \nThe  Project  will  require  141  person-months\u2019  consulting  services \n(61  international,  and  80  domestic).  Consulting  services  are \nrequired to facilitate project implementation and to strengthen the \ninstitutional,  administrative,  and  financial  capacities  of  the  PMU \nand  PIUs.  One  consulting  firm  will  provide  services  for  the  PMU \nand  PIUs.  The  loan-financed  consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by the ADB \nand  its  Borrowers  using  a  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants. \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  9,500  people  on  the  three  focus \nislands,  raising  the  standard  of  living  by  providing  basic  needs. \nMore than 20,000 people in the Lhaviyani, Alifu Dhaal, and Laamu \natolls  are  expected  to  benefit  from  solid  waste  management \nimprovements,  and  approximately  100,000  people  in  the  central \nregional  growth  centers  will  benefit  from  improved  planning  and \nenvironmental management and improved institutional capacity to \nimplement  the  regional  development  program.  The  proposed \nsanitation  and  sewerage  improvements  will  significantly  reduce \npollution  on  the  focus  islands  and  their  immediate  surroundings, \nand will provide a proven mechanism for easy replication on other \nislands. \nImproved  solid  waste  management  will  provide \nsustainable  solid  waste  collection  and  disposal,  and  reduce \ncoastal and marine pollution. A higher quality of life will result from \nbetter environmental management. These schemes will potentially \nenhance public health by reducing the risk of contracting diarrheal \nand  waterborne  diseases.  Community  participation  will  benefit \nvulnerable  groups  and  allow  women  to  be  active  in  solid  waste \nmanagement.  Poor  households  will  be  encouraged  to  participate \nas project beneficiaries.  \n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n \n \n\nSkilled  and  experienced  staff  members  are  assumed  to  be \navailable for project activities. The problem of having only a small \nnumber of skilled staff members in key Government agencies has \nbeen  mitigated  in  project  design  through  consultancies  and \ntraining.  Improvement  of  atoll  administration  requires  that  (i)  all \nstaff members trained under the Project will not be transferred to \nother institutions, (ii) collection and analysis of environmental data \nand  drafting  of  land-use  plans  will  be  timely,  and  (iii)  MOAD  and \nPIUs  will  have  the  commitment,  and  receive  the  appropriate \namount of resources, to carry out their mandate. \n \nThe Project assumes that, as agreed with the Government, a legal \nframework  allowing  cooperatives  to  exist  as  legal  entities  and  to \nengage  in  multipurpose  activities  such  as  running  of  sanitation \nfacilities  will  be  accomplished  before \nloan  effectiveness. \nGovernment  support  will  be  required  to  ensure  that  island  chiefs \nencourage  the  proper  functioning  of  the  community  cooperative \non  their  islands.  Principal  assumptions  include  a  strong  sense  of \nownership  of  and  commitment  to  the  Project,  especially  by  the \nimplementing agency.  \n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of the Maldives for the Regional Development Project, Phase II \u2013 Environmental \nInfrastructure and Management.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nThe Maldives are a chain of 1,190 small low-lying coral islands grouped into 26 atolls in \nthe  Indian  Ocean:  198  islands  are  inhabited,  80  house  tourist  resorts,  and  only  33  are  over  1 \nsquare  kilometer.  The  islands  are  predominantly  coastal  entities,  and  their  ecosystems  are \namong  the  most  vulnerable  in  the  world.  The  Maldives\u2019s  fragile  coral  reefs  and  coasts,  which \ncomprise the main source of livelihood in the atolls, need to be protected.  \n \nThe Maldives have a narrow economic base that relies on two key sectors\u2014tourism and \n3. \nfisheries.  Economic  growth  has  been  strong  since  the  1990s;  it  was  8.5%  in  2003.  Although \nfisheries  declined  by  5%  from  2002  levels,  marine  exports  increased  by  over  35%,  reflecting \nstronger export prices and larger volume and accounting for the overall increase in total exports \nin 2003. Aside from marine products, most of what is consumed in the country is imported. The \ncombination of heavy reliance on tourism and fisheries, and high dependence on imports leaves \nthe country highly vulnerable to external shock.2 \n \nStrong economic growth has resulted in improving development indicators. In 2002, life \n4. \nexpectancy  was  67.2  years,  literacy  97.2%,  and  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  per  capita \n$4,798 (in purchasing power parity). Yet despite tremendous progress, a large proportion of the \npopulation  remains  poor,  primarily  due  to  regional  disparities  in  living  conditions  related  to \nremoteness of the islands and lack of infrastructure and social services on the outer islands.3  \n \n5. \nThe Maldives suffers income and non-income poverty. Using Rf15 ($1.17) per capita per \nday as the threshold, the resulting poverty headcount in 1998 was 43%.4 Although a significant \neffort  to  reduce  poverty  had  been  undertaken  by  the  Government  over  the  past  6  years,  the \nrecently  occurred  tsunami  disaster severely  impacted  more  than  25,000  people  or  10%  of  the \nMaldives  total  population.5  The  overall  picture  does  not  show  the  high  degree  of  regional \nincome inequality. The concentration of the tourism industry and the Government administrative \napparatus  in  Mal\u00e9  has  led  to  a  large  and  widening  gap  between  the  capital  and  the  outer \nislands.  An  estimated  70%  of  the  population  outside  Mal\u00e9  has  incomes  equivalent  to  only  the \nleast  wealthy  20%  in  Mal\u00e9.  The  ratio  of  incomes  in  Mal\u00e9  compared  with  the  atolls  is  2:1, \nincreasing  to  3:1  when  the  lowest  average  per  capita  income  is  considered.  High  degrees  of \ninequality exist in social and physical infrastructure and services, estimated at 4:1 on average. \n\n                                                 \n \n1   ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n\n\f 2 \n\nThe atolls have acute unemployment further affected by the recent disaster. Income sources are \nthreatened  by  environmental  degradation.  Most  people  lack  access  to  electricity,  transport, \ncommunications,  education,  health,  potable  drinking  water,  recreation  facilities,  and  selected \nconsumer goods. Quality of housing and the natural environment is uneven. Food insecurity and \nmalnutrition are widespread in the atolls. This is a challenge that the Government has sought to \naddress since the 1970s, by undertaking a comprehensive program of regional development to \nopen the entire archipelago to increased economic opportunities. Despite targeted Government \nefforts, marked regional disparities still exist.  \n \n6. \nUnique  geography  and  vulnerability  pose  two  key  development  challenges  for  the \ncountry.  First,  the  dispersion  of  the  population  across  the  archipelago  raises  the  cost  of \ndelivering  social  services,  as  economies  of  scale  are  difficult  to  achieve  in  service  provision. \nSecond,  some  inhabited  islands  have  become  ecologically  vulnerable,  while  others  have \nbecome  too  densely  populated.  The  greater  Mal\u00e9  area,  already  home  to  70,000  people  or \nalmost  a  quarter  of  the  population,  is  of  specific  concern.  The  continuing  inward  migration  to \nMal\u00e9,  in  response  to  ecological  vulnerability  of  the  outer  atolls,  better  job  opportunities,  and \nhigher quality of social and public services, has severely increased population pressure in the \nregion. A discussion of the institutional sector is in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nAs highlighted in the sixth National Development Plan,6 regional development is key to \n7. \neasing  the  development  pressure  on  Mal\u00e9  as  well  as  solving  equity  problems.  Private  sector \nactivities, which would spur economic growth, have been limited in the atolls due to lack of basic \ninfrastructure. While progress has been made in providing water and storage through rainwater \ntank programs on many islands in the Central Regions, investment in sanitation and solid waste \nmanagement  remains  low  and  has  sometimes  been  unsuccessful.  This  has  resulted  in \ndeteriorating  living  conditions  on  many  inhabited  islands  where  the  freshwater  lens  is  at  risk \nthrough  groundwater  pollution  and  high  salinity  levels.  Pollution  of  the  lagoons  is  widespread. \nThese  problems  are  particularly  serious  on  densely  populated  islands  such  as  Naifaru.  The \ntraditional approach to land management through land allocation has added a number of other \nfundamental  environmental  problems,  including  (i)  inefficient  use  of  scarce  land  resources,  (ii) \ncostly  and  overdesigned  utilities  and  infrastructure,  and  (iii)  badly  located  development  that \njeopardizes the conservation of freshwater and the marine environment.  \n \n8. \nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation.  Water  on  the  outer  islands  is  almost  entirely  supplied \nthrough a combination of groundwater extraction, mainly through domestic wells, and rainwater \ntanks, which are the principal source of drinking water. Increasing groundwater extraction levels, \nresulting  from  population  and  development  pressures,  are  depleting  the  freshwater  lens,  a \nsituation frequently exacerbated by the use of electric water pumps. This, in turn, leads to saline \nintrusion into the groundwater aquifer, thus restricting its resource value. As a result, individual \nhousehold  and  communal  rainwater  tanks  are  increasingly  needed  as  the  principal  source  of \ndrinking water. Communal tanks are necessary to provide water in times of drought and to meet \nthe  needs  of  families  unable  to  afford  or  accommodate  individual  tanks.  The  situation  was \nfurther  exacerbated  by  the  2004  tsunami  disaster  which  caused  damage  to  the  water  lens  in \nmany islands. The recovery of the aquifer is uncertain as it is the period of time this will take. \n \n\n                                                 \n6   The  Government\u2019s  vision  for  promoting  regional  development  is  based  on  a  diversified  economy.  This  process \ninvolves  a  gradual  shift  toward  a  decentralized  and  service-based  economy,  which  will  result  in  job  creation, \nimproved services and infrastructure, development of human capital, and efficient institutional support \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 3\n\nGroundwater resources are at risk of bacterial contamination caused by effluent leakage \n9. \nand pollutant migration from poorly constructed and maintained septic tanks and other disposal \nfacilities. In high-density island environments, the construction and operation and maintenance \n(O&M)  of  septic  tanks  are  complex,  and  a  small-bore  pipe  network  is  a  common  alternative. \nThese  small-bore  systems  are  generally  not  well  designed,  often  malfunction,  and  usually \nconvey  raw  sewage  directly  into  the  lagoon.  Assets  have  deteriorated  due  to  deferred \nmaintenance, a situation aggravated by the Government\u2019s necessary budget control measures. \nGovernment and community initiatives have not always been successful, and faulty systems are \nconducive  to  marine  pollution.  The  Maldives  Water  and  Sanitation  Authority  (MWSA),  with \nVoluntary  Service  Overseas  (VSO)  assistance,  has  developed  an  environmental  awareness \nprogram, used in selected atolls. However, resource constraints have prevented its widespread \napplication. \n \n10. \nSolid  Waste  Management.  The  outer  islands  have  no  formal  waste  management \nsystems, except for two landfill sites7 and the central landfill facility of Thilafushi,8 serving Mal\u00e9. \nMuch of the waste material is not separated, and hazardous and toxic materials are deposited in \ngarbage  dumps.  Dumps  sites  are  not  planned  and  designed  as  sustainable  landfill  sites,  and \nare  often  close  to  houses  and/or  lagoons.  Households  deposit  wastes  randomly,  and \nenvironmentally unsafe waste burning is common. Conventional approaches present a series of \nproblems,  including  the  need  for  substantial  areas  of  land,  which  must  be  separate  from \nresidential  and  sensitive  land-use  areas.  Marine  pollution,  particularly  lagoon  pollution,  and \nlong-term  risks  of  groundwater  through  leachate  drainage,  will  be  a  severe  risk.  Communities \nare  becoming  increasingly  conscious  of  the  need  for  environmentally  sound  management \npractices,  and  a  number  of  individual  island  initiatives  take  a  better  approach  to  solid  waste \ncollection and disposal, but the country still has no comprehensive and sustainable approach to \nsolid  waste  management.  The  need  to  expedite  adequate  practices  and  systems,  and  to \norganize the sector for efficient operation emerged to be particularly important in the aftermath \nof the tsunami. \n \n11. \nLand Management. The traditional approach to land management on the outer islands \n(including the Central Regions) through land allocation has resulted in a number of fundamental \nenvironmental problems, particularly on inhabited islands. These problems include (i) inefficient \nuse of scarce land resources, (ii) costly and overdesigned support utilities and infrastructure, (iii) \nbadly located built development that jeopardizes conservation of groundwater aquifers and the \ncoastal environment, and (iv) development of incompatible land-use facilities in close proximity. \nWhile  policy,  legislation,  and  environmental  impacts  have  been  extensively  assessed, \nimproperly  considered  development  and  inadequate  monitoring  and  enforcement  may  lead  to \nunsustainable development, such as garbage dumping in lagoons. The Government has taken \nland-use  planning  initiatives,  including  endorsement  of  preliminary  planning  guidelines  for \napplication  at  national  level,  and  formulation  of  land-use  plans  for  selected  islands  in  the \nnorthern  and  southern  regions.9  Further  institutional  strengthening  is  required  to  confirm  the \nland-use planning process, provide a comprehensive planning framework and guidelines for use \non  the  outer  islands,  and  prepare  land-use  plans  incorporating  aspirations  defined  in  the  atoll \nand island development plans.  \n\n                                                 \n7   The landfill sites were developed under the ADB-supported project Regional Development Project, Phase I (ADB. \n1999. Report and Recommendation to the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Republic \nof  the  Maldives  Regional  Development  Project.  Manila),  including  the  newly  opened  solid  waste  management \nfacility at Kuludhuffushi. \n\n8   According  to  the  State  of  Environment  report,  more  than  400  tons  of  waste  is  transported  daily  to  Thilafushi \n\n(Ministry of Home Affairs and Environment. 2002. State of Environment, 2000. Maldives). \n9   This was done in the context of the Regional Development Project, Phase I (footnote 7). \n\n\f 4 \n\nGovernance.  The  form  and  nature  of  governance  have  been  slow  to  reflect  regional \n12. \ndevelopment  initiatives  and  the  needs  and  aspirations  of  beneficiary  communities.  The \ntraditional \u201ctop down\u201d sectoral approach of Government line agencies has sometimes resulted in \ninefficient project investment. Community participation has been inadequate, and private sector \nmobilization  weak.  Community  organizations  are  traditionally  important.  Community  groups \nprovide  most  public  or  collective  services  available  on  distant  islands.  The  demand  for  good-\nquality  local  government  services  such  as  public  administration,  judiciary,  police,  water, \nsanitation,  electricity,  communication  has  been  rising  with  population  expansion,  higher \nincomes,  and  improved  education.  Providing  such  facilities  and  services  to  each  inhabited \nisland is, however, expensive, given the small populations. The Government is thus developing \nselected  focus  islands  to  serve  as  local  government  hubs  for  the  atolls.  The  Government \npromotes  community  participation  in  delivery  of  public  services  to  empower  atoll  communities \nand  to  increase  accountability  and  ownership  of  the  communities  delivering  the  services. \nWherever possible, the Government aims to concentrate the delivery of local public services to \nimprove  access,  convenience  of  use,  and  efficiency  of  land  use  on  the  space-scarce  focus \nislands.  \n \n13. \nPolicy  Dialogue.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  integrated  policy  dialogue  with \nthe  Government  is  defined  within  the  comprehensive  National  Development  Framework  and, \ncomplementing  development  programs,  aims  to  help  stimulate  economic  development  and \nreduce poverty in a sustainable fashion through the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nIntegrate (among sectors and governments, and spatially) and coordinate public \nprograms by developing decentralized and multisectoral planning processes with \nparticipation  of  the  poor,  public-private  partnerships,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation. \nManage  and  conserve  natural  resources  by  continuing  water  quality  and \nsanitation programs, coastal zone management, and land-use planning to target \npublic infrastructure investments. Guide decentralized planning. \nPromote  environmentally,  socially,  and  economically  sustainable  activities  that \ncreate  jobs  for  the  poor,  by  improving  the  access  of  the  outer  islands  to \ninfrastructure  services,  particularly  energy,  water  and  sanitation,  and  transport, \nand by scaling up and replicating sustainable development and poverty reduction \npaths regionally. \n\n \n14. \nExternal  Agency  Coordination.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  will  be  implemented  in  an  integrated \nfashion to complement leverage programs of, and coordinate with, existing partners, especially \nin  areas  of  sustainable  and  integrated  regional  development,  support  to  development  of  local \nparticipatory  mechanisms,  and  environmental  management.  Aside  from  the  Government,  the \nmain partners include the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),10 World Bank, and \nIslamic  Development  Bank.  During  implementation  and  where  applicable,  activities  will  be \ncoordinated. Other relevant past and ongoing external assistance in social infrastructure is listed \nin Appendix 3. \n \nLessons  Learned.  Lessons  from  ADB  projects  in  the  Maldives  and  in  small  island \n15. \ncountries have been built into the Project. The Regional Phase Project, Phase I (foonote 6) is \nestimated  to  be  completed  by  31  December  2005.  Phase  II  will  benefit  from  the  positive \nlessons,  including,  among  others,  the  successful  operation  of  revolving  funds  for  rainwater \n\n                                                 \n10  UNDP  has  led  in  introducing  community-based  mechanisms  at  island  level,  which  assist  in  job  creation,  social \n\ndevelopment, and small-scale environmental improvements.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 5\n\ncatchment.  A  review  of  phase  I  highlighted  the  need  to  (i)  incorporate  mechanisms  to  ensure \nthat  O&M  are  integral  to  the  Project,  (ii)  incorporate  integrated  solid  waste  management \nprograms to minimize waste production and maximize waste reuse and recycling benefits; and \n(iii)  strengthen  staffing  in  the  regional  offices.  This  Project  will  incorporate  these  findings, \nstrengthen  local  coordination  and  management  of  services,  and  ensure  that  infrastructure  is \ndesigned and implemented to meet local community needs. To avoid divergence between social \ninfrastructure and community needs and aspirations, responsive mechanisms in project design \nand implementation must be established.  \n \nThe most effective way to improve the service quality is to build on island solidarity and \n16. \ndevelop  community  ownership  and  accountability.  Most \nlimited \nimplementation capacity due to scarce skilled and experienced staff. Project implementation is \ndelayed  due  to  a  lack  of  coordination  between  Government  agencies,  the  initial  phases  of \nappointing  consultants,  and  awarding  of  contracts.  Implementation  capacity  and  coordination \nmust be strengthened, and long-term training provided for project staff in the relevant agencies \nas well as at the atoll and island levels.  \n \n17. \n Project implementation will be integrated to complement and provide leverage to other \nexternal programs and to support the development of community-based initiatives. The Project \nincludes a number of features designed to support the Government\u2019s 6th National Development \nPlan  and  ADB\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement.  These  include  consolidation  and \nuse  of  participatory  mechanisms  at  the  local  level  to  ensure  that  the  poor  and  vulnerable  can \nparticipate  and  benefit.  Interisland  consortia  and  integrated  monitoring  and  evaluation  for  all \nprograms will be set up, local government management strengthened, and island development \nplans (IDPs) and atoll development plans (ADPs) prepared for each atoll. \n \n\nline  agencies  have \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nOutcome \n\ntherefore,  relieve  Mal\u00e9  of \n\nThe  Project  seeks  to  promote  regional  development  to  support  equitable  access  to \n18. \nsocial  services  and, \nintense  development  population  and \nenvironmental  pressures.  The  project  goal  is  to  increase  the  standard  of  living  in  the  Central \nRegions.11 The project objective is to improve environmental and land management through a \ncommunity-centered  approach.  The  Project  includes  a  balance  of  institutional,  infrastructure, \nand  environmental  improvements  in  the  focus  islands  and  their  region.  The  Project  will  help \nthe  environment,  support  community  and  private  sector \nsafeguard  public  health  and \nparticipation  in  waste  management  and  sanitation,  and  increase  public  awareness  of \nresponsible  environmental  management  practices.  The  Project  combines  policy  improvement, \ncapacity building, and investment in physical facilities.  \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nTo accomplish its objective, the Project has three closely interrelated components:  \n\n19. \n \n\n (i) \n\nPart A: Improving environmental infrastructure. This covers  \n(a) sanitation and sewerage improvements,  \n\n                                                 \n11  The  Central  Regions  were  particularly  affected  by  the  2004  tsunami.  While  this  project  will  provide  assistance  to \nareas affected by the tsunami and therefore complement activities undertaken by the Maldives TEAP (footnote 5), \nthe project aims to promote long-term development objectives, including institutional strengthening, policy dialogue, \nand environmental management. \n\n\f 6 \n\n(b) water supply, and  \n(c) integrated solid waste management.  \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii)  \n\nPart  B:  Strengthening  planning  and  environmental  management.  This \nincludes  \n(a) land-use planning and management,  \n(b) formulation of an economic development framework study for the \n      regional growth centers,  \n(c) developing an environmental awareness program, and  \n(d) environmental monitoring.  \n\n(iii)  \n\nPart C: Building management and implementation capacity. This covers  \n(a) community mobilization facilitation, and  \n(b) institutional strengthening for improved project management. \n\n \n\n1. \n\nPart A: Improving Environmental Infrastructure \n\n20. \nThis  component  is  geared  to  meet  the  needs  and  capacity  of  island  communities  and \nindividual households. Its activities will be included in the IDPs and ADPs, and infrastructure will \nonly  be  constructed  once  the  land-use  plans  have  been  approved  and  the  legal  framework  to \nestablish utility cooperatives issued.  \n \n\na. \n\n Sanitation and Sewage Treatment and Disposal  \n\nA  settled  sewerage  system  will  be  constructed  under  the  Project  for  Mahibadhoo  and \n21. \nFonadhoo. The system is considered to be the most cost-effective and technically sound way to \nprovide  sustainable  sanitation  arrangements,  as  population  densities  are  high;  flow  gradients \nare  small;  and  the  climate,  which  is  warm  with  high  humidity  and  seawater-laden  winds, \naccelerates  the  corrosion  of  mechanical,  electrical,  and  other  susceptible  equipment.  The \nsystem can be easily replicated on most outer islands.12 Solid wastes are retained in household \nseptic tanks13 while liquid wastes are discharged from tanks through small-bore sewers.  \n \nThe Project will provide reed bed facilities14 to treat liquid waste leaving the septic tanks \n22. \non the two selected islands. Reuse of treated effluent for agriculture will be the preferred option, \nif agricultural standards are achieved and demand is present.15 Recharging of the groundwater \naquifer  will  be  considered  when  the  reed  bed  treatment  achieves  World  Health  Organization \n(WHO)-recommended concentration levels for groundwater. The Project will provide a deep-sea \noutlet  for  the  effluent16  to  be  discharged  through,  if  required.  Provided  septage  areas  will  be \nsuitably  dried,  stabilized,  and  sterilized.  Sludge  and  vegetable  matter  will  be  composted  with \ngreen waste and used to improve the soil. Detailed design for Naifaru17 will be undertaken. An \nO&M strategy will be developed for the sanitation and solid waste management components,18 \n                                                 \n12  The schemes are based upon 2020 populations and a sewage flow of 225 cubic meters per day. \n13  Biological oxygen demand is reduced up to 60%, and suspended solids are virtually eliminated in the septic tanks. \n14 Reed bed plants assimilate pollutants and enhance evaporation, reducing the pollutants in solution and suspension \nand the total  amount of effluent. Fecal coliforms can be  reduced by  up to two orders of magnitude, and nitrogen \ngreatly reduced over longer retention times. \n\n15  Demand for agricultural-grade water is expected to be variable based on seasonal requirements.  \n16  The liquid effluent discharged to the sea will meet World Bank discharge standards.  \n17  Detailed design will be based on conventional or settled sewerage with reed bed treatment. \n18 The O&M strategy will include detailed methodology for tariff structure, collection, and administration. Building from \nwillingness-to-pay surveys and affordability data, user charges will be developed in a consultative and participatory \nmanner, accounting for income disparities and focusing on cost recovery for O&M.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 7\n\nproviding a solid foundation to collect user charges and administer the cooperative, ensuring the \nschemes\u2019 financial sustainability. Communities will be trained to lead in O&M.  \n \n\nb. \n\nWater Supply  \n\n23.  Water  supply  on  the  focus  islands  and  across  all  the  atolls  in  the  Central  Regions  is \ndeficient. The Project will support Ministry of Health (MOH) and UNDP like programs to provide \nindividual and communal storage rainwater tanks and improve roofs and gutters, by including a \nrainwater collection financing component to help households purchase rainwater storage tanks19 \nand/or  rehabilitate  or  improve  rainwater  harvesting  equipment.  Priority  will  be  given  to  lower \nincome  households  and  those  that  do  not  own  a  rainwater  tank.  Financing  facilities  for  the \npurchase  of  rainwater  storage  tanks  and/or  rainwater  harvesting  shall  be  provided  at \nconcessional  interest  rates,  to  cover  exclusively  administrative  costs  of  the  financial  facility. \nWater  catchment  improvements,  particularly  on  islands  with  reduced  potable  water  during  the \ndry  season,  will  be  maximized  through  the  community  awareness  program  for  environmental \nmanagement. \n \n\nc. \n\nIntegrated Solid Waste Management \n\n24. \nThe  principal  thrust  of  this  subcomponent  is  to  halt  and  reverse  environmental \ndegradation caused by inadequate solid waste management practices on the outer islands. The \ncomponent  will  help  achieve  the  long-term  goals  of  safeguarding  public  health  and  the \nenvironment, supporting community and private-sector participation in waste management, and \nincreasing public awareness of responsible waste management.  \n \n25. \nThe Project will support policy development initiatives of the Ministry of Environment and \nConstruction  (MEC)  by  conducting  a  waste  management  study  to  formulate  solid  waste \ncollection and disposal strategies at the atoll level, emphasizing the reuse and recycling of solid \nwaste, and the potential to maximize commercial value of solid waste and minimize the need for \nlandfill.  The  study\u2019s  results  will  be  used  to  formulate  a  national  solid  waste  management \nframework and serve as the basis to build physical infrastructure. The Project will provide solid \nwaste management centers in Naifaru, Mohibadoo, and Fonadhoo-Gan. Most waste generated \non  the  islands  and  atolls  will  either  be  reprocessed/stored  for  local  use,  or  stored  for \ntransshipment in the solid waste management centers.20 The centers will optimize the potential \nfor community involvement in O&M.  \n \nThe  Project  will  build  capacity  by  developing  and  implementing  public  awareness  and \n26. \ntraining campaigns to (i) establish and improve waste collection systems and cost recovery, and \n(ii) reduce waste generation and develop schemes for household composting at the island and \natoll  levels.  MEC  will  lead  in  preparing  and  realizing  the  solid  waste  management  awareness \nand training campaigns.21  \n \n\n                                                 \n19  This  initiative  was  particularly  successful  among  beneficiaries  under  the  Regional  Development  Project,  Phase  I \n\n(footnote 7).  \n\n20  The solid  waste management centers  will receive segregated  waste and manage it according to type: green and \ncompostable  material  will  be  processed  using  vessel  composting  technology,  recyclables  will  be  bailed  and \ntransported to a central facility for sale, and inert residuals will be reused locally. \n\n21  MEC will coordinate with other agencies active in the field of solid waste management and composting, such as the \n\nMinistry of Fisheries, Agriculture and Marine Resources (MOFAMR), to optimize this output\u2019s delivery. \n\n\f 8 \n\n2. \n\nPart B: Strengthening Planning and Environmental Management \n\na. \n\nLand-Use Planning and Management \n\nThe Project will build and strengthen capacity in land surveying and land-use planning of \n27. \nkey  Government  agencies  such  as  the  Maldives  Housing  and  Urban  Development  Board \n(MHUDB) and Ministry of Atolls Development (MOAD), and atoll officials. Capacity building will \nbe composed of (i) short-term training of local staff by an international consultant, focusing on \nformulation  of  land-use  plans;  and  (ii)  complementary  overseas  education,  in  the  form  of \npostgraduate degrees in town and country planning, to enhance overall capability for land use at \nthe atoll level. This component will provide the resource capacity to implement and operate the \nplanning guidelines,22 benefiting all atoll islands. This component will facilitate the preparation of \n24  land-use  plans  for  the  regional  growth  centers  identified  in  the  Central  Regions23  over  3 \nyears. The land-use plans will be carried out in a participatory manner, reflect community needs \nand  aspirations  as  defined  in  the  IDPs  and  incorporate  atoll-wide  development  objectives  as \ndefined in the ADPs.  \n \n\nb. \n\nRegional Economic Development \n\n28. \nThe Project will address constraints and opportunities for regional growth and economic \ndevelopment  through  a  case  study  in  economic  development  planning  for  regional  growth \ncenters.  The  study24  will  prepare  an  economic  development  framework.  The  first  phase,  for \nFonadhoo-Gan  in  Laamu  Atoll,  will  present  a  comprehensive  range  of  proposals  for \ndevelopment and job-creating activities, together with supporting implementation arrangements \nand  an  investment  program.  The  study  will  (i)  identify  economic  development  growth  sectors \nand  projects  for  improved  livelihoods,  (ii)  assess  skills  development  and  training  needs,  (iii) \nevaluate and guide investment opportunities for microfinance and household-level development \ninitiatives,  and  (iv)  help  vulnerable  groups.  The  study  will  support  Government  policy  and \nestablish an approach to atoll economic development. Building on the study\u2019s outcomes, studies \nfor the Lhaviyani and Alif Dhaal Atolls will be undertaken. These can then be used as a model \nfor other regions/atolls.  \n \n\nc. \n\nEnvironmental Awareness \n\n29. \nThe  Project  will  develop  and  implement  an  environmental  awareness,  education,  and \noutreach program for the selected regions, building on the experience of the jointly developed \nMWSA and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation \nTransformation  (PHAST)25  to  promote  environmental  awareness  and  hygiene.  As  part  of  the \nenvironmental  awareness  component,  the  Project  will  adopt  the  hygiene  improvement \nframework and train and support island development committees (IDCs), women\u2019s development \ncommittees (WDCs), and community leaders in planning, monitoring, and evaluating sanitation \nand  hygiene  improvement.  The  Project  will  incorporate  gender-appropriate  and  user-friendly \napproaches  for  boys,  girls,  men,  women,  and  out-of-school  children.  The  Project  will  help \n                                                 \n22 The Planning Guidelines for Land-Use Planning were approved by the President in March 2004.  \n23  A model land-use plan for Fonadhoo was prepared under the project preparatory technical assistance. \n24  The  study  will  coordinate  with  ongoing  ADB  assistance  and  the  World  Bank  Integrated  Human  Development \nProject,  and  will  build  on  findings  from  studies  supported  by  other  external  agencies  (2001,  Strategic  Economic \nPlan, Phase I, Government of Singapore; and 2004, Old, Exisiting and Potential Income Generation Activities in the \nMaldives,  Published  by  Ministry  of  Atolls  Development  with  the  assistance  of  UNDP  and    the  United  Nations \nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, Mal\u00e9). \n\n25  The PHAST methodology centers around training of trainers, mostly teachers  and extension trainers,  who,  using \n\nthe same basic information and teaching media, transmit the message to the island population. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 9\n\nprepare  an  environmental  awareness  package,  and  associated  supporting  materials  and \nmanuals. If practical, a nongovernment organization (NGO) will help design and implement the \nawareness  program.26  In  the  initial  phase,  the  program  will  deliver  training  to  Lhaviyani,  Alif \nDhaal,  and  Laamu  atolls,  followed  by  a  second  phase,  covering  the  remaining  atolls  in  the \nCentral Regions. \n \n\nd. \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring \n\nThe  Project  will  include  an  environmental  monitoring  program  to  establish  pattern  and \n30. \ntrends  in  groundwater  quality  and  salinity  levels.  Initially,  monitoring  will  be  conducted  on  the \nfocus  islands,  then,  after  staff  training,  on  the  remaining  inhabited  islands  in  the  Central \nRegions.  The  Project  will  help  prepare  a  study  to  obtain  basic  hydro-geological  data  to  define \nappropriate  minimum  spacing  between  gray  water  and  sewage  facilities  and  domestic  wells, \nand, therefore, prevent pollutant infiltration and groundwater contamination. Pollutant migration \nin  the  atoll  aquifer  will  be  investigated  to  guide  on-site  sanitation,  reuse  of  gray  water,  and \ndisposal of treated effluent as part of the sewage scheme.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPart C: Management and Implementation Capacity Building \n\na. \n\nCommunity Mobilization \n\n31. \nThe  Project  will  review  approaches  to  community  organization  for  environmental \nmanagement in the Maldives, refine a preferred approach in consultation with other international \nagencies,  and  detail  project  activities  to  organize  communities  for  O&M  of  water  utilities  and \nsolid waste management. In each region, the Project will train project implementation unit (PIU) \nstaff, IDC and WDC  members, and NGOs supporting community-based O&M activities. In the \ninitial phase, priority will be given to communities on the three focus islands. Later, communities \nmay  be  mobilized  and  organized  on  other  islands  where  opportunities  for  community-based \nO&M  of  the  utility  and  solid  waste  management  sector  are  identified.  After  collecting  baseline \ninformation on the communities, the Project will define a methodology for prioritization.27 Trained \nPIU  staff  and  IDC  and  WDC  members,  assisted  by  consultants,  will  then  activate  community \ncouncils and structures for community-based management. Details are in Appendix 4. \n \n\nb. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening  \n\n32. \nProject  implementation  will  require  dedicated  staff  assigned  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance \nand Treasury (MOFT), MOAD, and primary participating agencies (MWSA, MHUDB, and MEC). \nThe  Project  will  train  and  technically  support  the  participating  agencies  to  plan,  manage, \nmonitor,  and  evaluate  the  Project.  Coordination  and  implementation  capacity  building  will  be \nprovided  to  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  and  PIUs.  Capacity-building  skills  will  include \ncoordination,  project  monitoring  and  evaluation,  technical  and  quality  control  procedures, \nfinancial  management  and \ninformation  systems,  accounting, \nprocurement,  community  mobilization,  and  social  and  environmental  monitoring  and  planning. \nAssistance will also be given to providing administrative, financial, and technical skills required \n\nreporting,  management \n\n                                                 \n26  In addition to the overall PHAST component, the environmental awareness curricula may include (i) rain and water \nresources management, (ii) vegetation and groundwater resources, (iii) pumping and salinity, (iv) water resources \nand sewerage, (vi) solid waste, (vii) lagoon and beach protection and/or (viii) beach erosion. MWSA will coordinate \nwith agencies such as MEC in the finalization of the program. \n\n27  Community  organization  activities  implemented  in  three  to  five  communities  per  year  will  comprise  workshops, \ntraining  of  trainers,  and  networking.  The  criteria  may  include  expressions  of  interest,  commitment,  and  extent  of \nenvironmental degradation. \n\n\f 10 \n\nto manage community cooperatives and/or private utility companies, where proposed. Specific \ntraining for O&M of utilities will be provided to PMU and PIU staff and communities. Technical \ntraining packages and manuals for this purpose will be prepared under the Project.  \n \nThe  Project  will  help  MWSA  PIU  staff  strengthen  its  capacity  to  implement  the \n33. \nenvironmental  management  and  awareness  subcomponents  and  improve  long-term  resource \ncapability.28 MHUDB as the planning authority and MEC (Environment Section) will benefit from \ncapacity-building and training programs built into the Project.29 The programs should combine (i) \nshort-term  training  for  in-house  staff  and  (ii)  selected  overseas  higher  education  programs  for \nconcerned agencies. MOAD will submit for ADB's concurrence a 5-year strategic training plan \nwithin 3 months of fielding project management consultants and an annual training plan before \n31  October  of  each  year.  The  plan  will  specify  training  institutions,  methodologies,  targeted \npopulation, and expected outputs. In accordance with the gender action plan, 30% of trainees \nwill be women (Appendix 5). \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Protection \n\nresulting \n\nfrom  additional  extraction \n\nfor  nonconsumptive  purposes,  or \n\n34. \nBy  increasing  drinking  water,  the  Project  will  help  protect  the  freshwater  lens  from \noverextraction,  protect  public  health  from  potential  waterborne  contamination,  and  reduce  the \noverall demands on the fragile aquifer, particularly affected after the December 2004 tsunami. \nThe Project will include the installation of sanitation solutions,30 reducing potential groundwater \ncontamination. The environmental monitoring program will provide a mechanism to evaluate any \nfrom \nchanges \ncontamination due to wastewater disposal. If changes are significant, then measures to protect \nthe freshwater lens will be implemented. The solid waste collection and management program \nwill  help  stop  the  uncontrolled  disposal  of  garbage.  Incorporation  of  source  separation  and \nrecycling  will  help  raise  public  awareness  of  the  need  for  wise  stewardship  of  the  fragile  atoll \necosystem.  Community  efforts  to  remove  scattered  waste  from  the  islands  and  surrounding \nwater will make them more visually appealing. A comprehensive land-use management plan for \nthe area will help identify appropriate land uses, establish maximum densities, protect sensitive \nareas such as water catchment zones and wetlands, and disclose the islands\u2019 carrying capacity. \n \n35. \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  conducted  to  identify  potential  project \nimpacts. The environmental analysis focused on those impacts associated with improvements in \nsewage and sanitation systems, and solid waste management. The analysis focused on project \nelements that would enhance and protect the environment. The summary IEE is in Appendix 7. \nThe  conclusion  was  that  an  environmental  impact  assessment  is  not  needed.  Overall,  the \nProject will improve the natural and human environment and reverse the negative impact on the \ndynamics of the atoll system and its ecology. The Project will improve management and develop \nscarce resources, such as freshwater, that reflect the islands\u2019 carrying capacity. \n \n\n                                                 \n28 MWSA has limited human resources. Staff experience, nevertheless, includes implementation of settled sewerage \nand sanitation programs (including the formulation of guidelines on construction and O&M of septic tanks) and pilot \nreed bed  wastewater schemes. MEC, recently mandated to manage solid  waste, may have limited experience in \nthe  field,  but  will  be  coordinating  closely  with  MOFAMR,  and  specific  agencies  with  experience  in  solid  waste \ncollection (in Mal\u00e9) and composting. \n\n29  Close  coordination  of  the  project  requirements  will  take  place  with  the  on-going  ADB  Technical  Assistance  for \n\nCapacity Building for Regional Development.  \n\n30  Selection criteria for sanitation improvement on the islands are in Appendix 6. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 11\n\n2. \n\nResource Management \n\n36. \nThe  land-use  planning  and  management  component  will  significantly  improve  land \nmanagement  in  the  atolls  by  (i)  providing  a  proper  context  for  land  allocation,  (ii)  providing  a \ncontext  for  social  mobilization  and  participation  in  land  management,  (iii)  ensuring  sustainable \nlevels of development on inhabited islands, (iv) providing a context for the optimal and least-cost \nprovision  of  utilities  and  other  services,  and  (v)  ensuring  the  conservation  of  environmentally \nsensitive  areas  such  as  freshwater  aquifers  and  lagoons.  The  Project  will  complete  land-use \nplans that reflect the carrying capacity of the islands\u2019 natural systems, increase understanding of \nhow to balance development with environmental  protection, and provide the capacity for land-\nuse planning. The Project will strengthen Government capacity to develop the regions, including \nsupport for an economic development framework for regional development centers. The project \ncomponents  will  be  designed  for  replication.  Facilitating  sustainable  livelihoods  through \nenvironmental improvement, and providing basic infrastructure and social services are required \nfor regional development and poverty reduction.  \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n37. \nThe  total  project  cost,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  is  estimated  at  $7.5 \nmillion  equivalent.  Of  the  total  cost,  $5.38  million  (71%)  comprises  the  foreign  exchange  cost, \nand  $2.12  million  equivalent  (29%)  the  local  currency  cost.

The Borrower will be the Republic of the Maldives. The \nloan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of \n1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year during the remaining term, and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  Loan  Agreement.  ADB  will  finance  80%  of  the \ncosts,  including  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  29%  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The \nGovernment  and  the  beneficiaries31  will  finance  the  remaining  $1.5  million  equivalent  of  local \ncost. Interest during construction will be capitalized.

MOFT will be the Project's Executing Agency, and MOAD, the Implementing Agency. A \nnational project steering committee (NPSC) will be established to oversee the Project, and will \nconsist  of  senior-level  representatives  from  MOFT;  MOAD;  Ministry  of  Planning  and  National \nDevelopment;  MOH;  MEC;  MHUDB;  Ministry  of  Gender,  Family  Development  and  Social \nSecurity;  at  the  director  level  or  above,  and  representatives  of  the  atolls.  The  NPSC  will  be \nchaired  by  the  deputy  minister  of  MOAD;  the  deputy  director  general  of  MOAD  will  be  the \nsecretary. The NPSC will advise and guide the Project on policy decisions and operations. The \nNSPC  will  hold  its  first  meeting  within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness  and  meet  quarterly.  A \nregional project advisory committee (RPAC) will be established on each focus island to advise \non atoll development coordination. The RPAC shall consist of representatives from IDC, WDC, \nisland  office,  PIU  and  as  applicable,  the  local  NGOs  and  chaired  by  a  senior  officer  to  be \nappointed  by  the  Minister  of  Atolls  Development.  MOAD  will  set  up  a  PMU,  led  by  a  full-time \nproject  director  with  adequate  sector-related  and  managerial  experience,  and  communication \nskills. The project director will be charged exclusively with the Project\u2019s execution and will have \nno  other  duties  within  MOAD.  A  core  team  of  staff  members  from  MOAD  (deputy  project \ndirector, financial and accounting manager, social development specialist); MOH (environmental \nengineer); and MHUDB (land-use planner) will assist the PD. Supported by the PMU, the project \ndirector  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  coordinating  all  activities  under  the  Project;  (ii)  liaising  and \nreporting to ADB; (iii) managing the PMU account; (iv) managing finances and reporting project \naccounts; (iv) liaising with other government agencies; (v) developing training materials, policy \nmanuals,  and  technical  guidelines;  (vi)  monitoring  and  evaluating  PIUs;  and  (vi)  giving \nmanagement and policy support to the PIUs. \n \n\n                                                 \n31  Beneficiaries\u2019 contribution will be mostly in kind, covering labor costs for civil works.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 13\n\nThe  PMU  will  (i)  prepare  the  overall  project  implementation  plan  and  consolidated \n40. \nannual work plan, (ii) help the PIUs implement island and atoll development plans, (iii) supervise \nall  project  management  activities,  (iv)  organize  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities,  (v) \nsupervise the implementation of the gender action plan and other activities under the summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy, and (vi) prepare overall progress reports and the project \ncompletion report. \n \n41. \nEach focus island will have a PIU, with three sections: (i) environment and sanitation, (ii) \ngovernance  and  social  development,  and  (iii)  planning.  Qualified  staff  will  head  each  section. \nThe  PIU  will  be  headed  by  a  project  manager  working  from  the  region,  with  suitable \nqualifications and good managerial and communication skills. ADB endorsement will be sought. \nThe  PIUs  will  employ  full-time  at  least  one  accountant,  one  sanitation  and  environmental \ntechnical expert, and one social development specialist for the duration of the Project; and one \nland-use planner for at least the first 3 years of project implementation. Depending on the size \nof the region and the workload, additional technical staff may be deputed from line agencies and \nministries, thus transfer skills and technology to the regions and improve capability. The PIU will \nbe  active  in  developing  the  structure  of  the  regional  development  management  office  and \ncontribute to the technical and regional development functions. \n \n42. \nThe  PIU  will  help  the  Project  (i)  prepare  the  island  and  atoll  development  plans \nconcurrently with the required land-use plan, (ii) mobilize communities, (iii) coordinate between \nthe  Project  and  community,  (iv)  tender  works  and  services  for  project  subcomponents,  (v) \nimplement  construction  works,  (vi)  implement  the  gender  action  plan,  (vii)  account  for \nexpenditures,  (viii)  monitor  and  report  on  project  activities,  and  (ix)  prepare  project  progress \nreports.  PIU  staff  will  be  trained  at  the  beginning  of  the  Project  in  civil  works,  sanitation,  solid \nwaste management, planning, and regular project administrative responsibilities. Each PIU will \nhave an accounting section, directly under the project manager, to deal with procedural aspects \nand  recording  of  financial  transactions  and  to  prepare  liquidation  of  statements  and \nreplenishment requests to the PMU. \n \n43. \nThe  PMU  and  PIUs  will  be  supported  by  a  team  of  consultants  headed  by  a  project \nadvisor and team leader and deputy team leader.32 Other consultants supporting the Project will \ninclude  a  financial  management  and  procurement  specialist,  a  monitoring  and  evaluation \nspecialist,  a  land-use  planner,  and  a  social  development  specialist.  Detailed  training \nrequirements  will  be  assessed  at  the  beginning  of  the  Project,  providing  staff  from  the  PMU, \nPIUs,  atolls,  islands,  MOAD,  MHUDB,  and  MOFT,  and  other  stakeholders  with  timely  training \nopportunities at the atoll, regional, and national levels. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years. Implementation is expected to commence \n44. \nin the fourth quarter of 2005. Start-up activities will include the establishment of the national and \nregional  steering  committees,  recruitment  of  project  staff  and  consultants,  preparation  of  the \ntraining  assessment,  conducting  feasibility  studies,  and  procurement  of  immediately  required \nequipment. Physical works may not start until the first quarter of 2007 due to the need to draw \nup  land-use  plans  for  approval  and  to  prepare  detailed  engineering  designs  and  contract \ndocuments. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n\n                                                 \n32  The team leader (international) and deputy team leader (domestic) will be environmental engineers. \n\n\f 14 \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n45. \nProcurement will generally be carried out by the PIUs under the PMU\u2019s guidance. Goods \nand  related  services,  and  civil  works  to  be  financed  from  loan  proceeds  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  Guidelines  for  Procurement  under  Asian  Development  Bank  Loans  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  sanitation  schemes  will  be \nintegrated  into  a  combined  design and  supervision,  and  supply  and  construction packages  for \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Equipment  packages  valued  at  $500,000  equivalent  or  less \nwill be procured following international shopping procedures acceptable to ADB and packages \nvalued  at  $100,000  equivalent  or  less  will  be  under  direct  purchasing  procedures.  Civil  works \ncontracts for the catchment rehabilitation under the rainwater tank component will be small, with \nan average value in the range of $10,000 to $15,000 equivalent, and will follow ADB's Guide on \nCommunity  Participation  in  Procurement.  The  first  contract  of  this  type  within  each  of  the \nNorthern  Central,  Central  Region  and  Southern  Central  Region  will  be  subject  to  ADB\u2018s \napproval. The proposed procurement packages are in Appendix 10. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n46. \nAn estimated 141 person-months (61 international, 80 domestic) of consulting services \nare  needed.  Consulting  services  are  required  to  facilitate  project  implementation  and  to \nstrengthen  institutional,  administrative,  and  financial  capacities  of  the  PMU  and  PIUs.  Loan-\nfinanced consultants for the PMU and PIUs will be engaged through an international consulting \nfirm in accordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and \nIts  Borrowers,  using  a  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The proposed outline terms of \nreference are in Appendix 11. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n47. \nThe  PMU  will  prepare  disbursement  projections,  request  budgetary  allocations  for \ncounterpart funds, collect supporting documents, and prepare withdrawal applications and send \nthem  to  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  To  facilitate  the  timely \nrelease  of  loan  proceeds  and  counterpart  funds  and  to  expedite  project  implementation,  the \nGovernment  will,  immediately  after  loan  effectiveness,  open  and  maintain  a  project  imprest \naccount with the Maldives Monetary Authority, to be managed by the PMU. The total advances \nto the imprest account, including the initial advance, will not at any time exceed estimated ADB-\nfinanced expenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. To \nfacilitate project implementation and support the environmental infrastructure component, three \nsecond-generation  imprest  accounts  for  each  of  the  PIUs  will  be  established  at  a  commercial \nbank. The initial ceiling of the second-generation imprest account will be $20,000 equivalent, or \nthe estimated ADB-financed expenditures in each PIU in the next 6 months, whichever is lower. \nBecause  the  PIUs  have  limited  experience  with  implementing  externally  financed  investment \nprojects, the second-generation imprest accounts will be established only after the fielding of the \nproject-financed  financial  management  consultant.  The  PMU  will  ensure  that  all  imprest \naccounts  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook,  and  with  detailed  arrangements  agreed  to  by  the  Government \nand  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  procedures,  applicable  to  individual  payments  of \n$100,000 or less, will be used to liquidate advances from the imprest accounts.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 15\n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n48. \nThe  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  detailed  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation,  following  ADB  standard  procedures.  The  PMU  will  obtain  and  consolidate \nrelevant data from the PIUs, which will prepare project operating accounts and related financial \nstatements, and records of the statement of expenditure. Auditors acceptable to ADB will audit \nthe imprest account, second-generation imprest accounts, and statement of expenditures. The \nfinal audit report will include a separate audit opinion on these. The PIUs will agree to have their \nproject  operating  accounts  audited  by  the  PMU  before  receiving  any  funding  through  the \nProject. Audited financial statements and project accounts, together with the auditor\u2019s report, will \nbe  submitted  within  6  months  of  the  close  of  the  financial  year.  The  PMU  will  submit  to  ADB, \nwithin 3 months of the physical completion of the Project, a project completion report following \nstandard  ADB  procedures.  The  PMU  and  PIUs  will  have  an  adequate  number  of  suitably \nqualified accounting staff, including a senior officer. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n49. \nTo ensure that project components are managed efficiently and that project benefits are \nmaximized,  a  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)  has  been  developed.  It  will \nmonitor and evaluate project information and data to ensure that planned interventions achieve \nthe desired result and benefit the target population. The PPMS will establish a cause-and-effect \nrelationship between the Project and its impact. PPMS activities will be conducted periodically to \ngather  information  from  multiple  sources  to  determine  whether  the  input  deliveries  for \nimplementing  project  activities  have  rendered  expected  benefits  to  the  intended  beneficiaries. \nBeneficiaries  will  be  involved  in  project  monitoring  evaluation,  through  direct  reporting  to  PIU \nand  through  the  regional  project  advisory  committees  to  be  established  for  coordination  and \nmonitoring.  The  PPMS  also  seeks  to  detect  any  deficiencies  and  discrepancies  between  the \nproject plan and execution in using resources efficiently so that timely corrections can be made \nto update the Project and thus improve its benefits, outcomes, and impact. The indicators to be \nmonitored  will  have  been  formulated  and  agreed  upon  with  MOFT,  including  indicators \npertaining  to  physical  progress  and  institutional  reform  activities.  The  monitoring  process  will \nfocus  on,  but  not  limit  itself  to,  capacity  building  and  O&M.  The  PMU  will  gather  baseline \nphysical  and  socioeconomic  data  in  each  atoll  and  submit  a  detail  implementation  plan  for \nmonitoring performance and prepare benchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence \nwithin  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  Thereafter,  the  PMU  will  submit  semiannual  monitoring \nand evaluation reports to ADB throughout project implementation.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n50. \nThe PMU and PIUs will regularly review and evaluate project performance, while MOFT, \nMOAD,  and  ADB  will  jointly  assess  project  implementation  at  least  once  every  year. \nParticipating  island  communities,  island  and  atoll  offices,  and  PIUs  will  undertake  extensive \ninternal  project  monitoring.  The  Government,  PMU,  and  ADB  will  conduct  a  comprehensive \nmidterm review 2.5 years after the Project starts or after the first phase of the settled sewerage \nsystem  is  implemented,  whichever  is  sooner.  The  review  will  (i)  cover  the  scope,  design,  and \nimplementation  arrangements  of  the  Project;  (ii)  identify  changes  needed  since  the  time  of \nproject  appraisal;  (iii)  assess  implementation  performance  against  project  indicators;  (iv) \nestablish  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  and  (v)  identify  problems,  constraints,  and,  if \nnecessary,  recommend  changes  in  the  design  or  implementation  arrangements.  Within  3 \nmonths  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  PMU  will  make  publicly  available  a  project \ncompletion report in the standard ADB format.  \n\n\f 16 \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nExpected Project Benefits and Impacts \n\ninstitutional  strengthening  components  of \n\n51. \nPoverty  in  the  Maldives  stems  primarily  from  regional  disparities  in  living  conditions \nrelated to remoteness of the islands and lack of infrastructure and social services in the atolls \n(footnote  3).  Persistent  regional  income  and  non-income  inequality  must  be  reduced.  The \nProject is consistent with the Government\u2019s strategy to reduce poverty by promoting balanced \nand equitable development. The Project supports the development of regions, with focus islands \nas  growth  centers.  The  Project  will  provide  the  necessary  geographic  intervention  to  reduce \npoverty  in  the  Maldives  and  will  help  the  Government  achieve  the  Millennium  Development \nGoals  (MDGs).33  Details  on  the  action  program  and  performance  criteria  for  Regional \nDevelopment  and  the  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  are  in  Appendix  12  and \n13, respectively. \n \nThe Project will generate significant benefits at the household, community, island, atoll, \n52. \nand regional levels. Households and communities on focus islands will be direct beneficiaries of \nenvironmental infrastructure, and community mobilization components. Planning, environmental \nmanagement,  and \nthe  Project  will  benefit \ncommunities, islands, atolls, and regions, and strengthen planning and management capacities \nat  all  levels.  Benefits  will  include  (i)  protection  of  scarce  natural  resources  under  threat,  (ii) \nimprovement of quality of life for beneficiary households and communities, (iii) empowerment of \ncommunities, and (iv) economic benefits. \n \n53. \nEnvironment  and  natural  resources  protection.  Island  ecosystems  are  among  the \nmost  vulnerable  in  the  region.  Environmental  degradation  can  render  an  island  uninhabitable, \nincrease its vulnerability to natural disasters, and impact on key economic sectors, particularly \ntourism and fisheries. On the focus islands, unemployment is significant with only 50% of people \n15\u201364  years  old  are  employed.  Existing  income  sources  are  threatened  by  environmental \ndegradation.  Protecting  the  marine  environment  is  important  in  the  atolls  since  primary  fishing \nactivities  engage  18%  of  the  total  labor  force,  and  98%  of  fisheries  workers  are  in  the  atolls, \nwhere  this  sector  is  the  main  employer.  As  most  atoll  workers  are  employed  in  fishing, \nprotecting fisheries is central to any poverty strategy. The Project is a step toward meeting the \nneeds  of  current  and  future  communities.  Provision  of  rainwater  tanks  will  increase  the \navailability  of  clean  drinking  water.  Support  for  sanitation  and  sewerage  and  integrated  solid \nwaste  management  will  prevent  degradation  of  groundwater  resources  and  the  marine \nenvironment.  \n \n54. \nQuality  of  Life.  The  lack  of  basic  infrastructure  and  social  services  in  the  atolls \nexacerbates income and non-income poverty. Environmental infrastructure on the focus islands \nwill  provide  basic  needs  to  vulnerable  households  and  communities.  Rainwater  tanks  will \nprovide drinking water to an initial 2,000 households, constituting over 20% of the focus islands\u2019 \npopulation.  An  estimated  additional  5,500  tanks  will  be  provided  through  a  revolving  fund  by \n2020.  The  Project  will  target  poor  households,  who  do  not  have  rainwater  tanks  and  use  well \nwater (which can be contaminated with fecal coliforms) or public rainwater tanks.  \n \n\n                                                 \n33 The Project will help achieve MDG 1 (reduce the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day), MDG 7 \n(ensure  environmental  sustainability  and  reduce  the  proportion  of  people  without  sustainable  access  to  safe \ndrinking water), and MDG 6 (combat various diseases).  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 17\n\nThe  Project  is  expected  to  impact  on  public  health.  The  atoll  population  suffers  from  a \n55. \nhigh incidence of intestinal parasite infestation due to poor sanitation and lack of safe water, and \nabout  50\u201375%  of  children  below  5  are  affected.  Poor  sanitation  and  sewerage  spread  other \nwaterborne  diseases  such  as  diarrhea,  while  solid  waste  transmits  disease.  Households\u2014\nparticularly poor ones\u2014use much time and resources to collect water, manage solid waste, and \nattend  to  health  problems  caused  by  poor  waste  management.  Most  of  the  burden  falls  on \nwomen. The Project includes a gender action plan, which ensures that women will benefit from \nand implement the Project.  \n  \n56. \nImproved  coastal  and  lagoon  waters  will  protect  fish  and  other  marine  resources  on \nwhich  households  depend  for  daily  subsistence  and  nutrition,  especially  benefiting  the  poor, \nwomen,  and  children.  Environmental  infrastructure  on  the  focus  islands  is  expected  to  benefit \nover  9,000  residents,  particularly  the  poor,  who  comprise  over  60%  of  the  population.  The \nimprovements  to  water  supply,  sanitation  and  sewerage,  and  solid  waste  management  on  the \nfocus  islands  can  be  replicated  on  other  islands.  Environmental  infrastructure  will  result  in \nsaving  and  even  generating  resources,  which  will  improve  the  quality  of  life  and  strengthen \nlivelihood  opportunities.  For  example,  increasing  water  supply  alleviates  competing  water  use \nfor  agriculture.  Treated  sewage  water  can  be  used  for  irrigation,  and  sewage  sludge  and \nbiodegradable  solid  waste  for  compost  materials.  Expanding  production  in  backyard  gardens \nwill  help  vulnerable  households  increase  their  food  security  and  incomes.  The  Project\u2019s \ncomponents  will  create  jobs.  Project  design  ensures  pro-poor  and  non-gender-discriminatory \nemployment.  A  concerted  effort  to  provide  basic  infrastructure  for  environmental  improvement \nand  social  services,  environmental  management,  and  integrated  land-use  planning  and  area \ndevelopment can promote private sector activities, which will spur economic growth in the atolls. \n \n57. \nCommunity  Empowerment.  Pre-project  consultation  confirmed  the  importance  of \nstrong  links  with  the  community  in  project  implementation.  Through  the  Project\u2019s  community \nmobilization  component,  community  groups  will  establish  mechanisms \nfor  O&M  of \nenvironmental  infrastructure.34  Training  mechanisms  and  programs  built  into  the  Project  will \nstrengthen  communities\u2019  capacity.  Community  participation  will  be  consolidated  through  an \nenvironmental  awareness  program,  which  will  enable  project  beneficiaries  to  use  sustainable \npractices, and help conserve island and marine environments.35 \n \n58. \nCommunity participation will benefit vulnerable groups. Women have the potential to be \nactive  in  managing  solid  waste.  The  participation  of  beneficiaries  in  project  design  and \nimplementation will instill in them a sense of ownership. User charges will help establish a stake \nin  the  Project  among  users.  Information  and  education  campaigns  will  help  raise  community \nawareness on health, cleanliness, and the environment. These will reduce neglect and misuse \nof  public  assets  and  help  sustain  the  project  gains  in  the  long  run.  Strong  coordination  and \neffective partnership to reduce disparities, particularly in the atolls, can address the high cost of \ninfrastructure and social services.  \n \n59. \ninfrastructure  component  will  create \nquantifiable  benefits  (marketable  goods  and  services)  as  well  as  nonquantifiable  benefits \n(improved  health,  welfare,  and  amenities).  Surveys  of  willingness  to  pay  have  been  used  to \nderive consumer values for the outputs of two subcomponents. Market values are available for \n\nEconomic  Benefits.  The  environmental \n\n                                                 \n34 They can be the mechanism to organize direct community efforts to implement sanitation and sewerage, and solid \n\nwaste management schemes. \n\n35  The  programs  should  maximize  the  potential  for  direct  community  action,  particularly  by  schoolchildren,  in \n\nenvironmental improvement projects, such as \u201cclean-up\u201d campaigns. \n\n\f 18 \n\ntwo  of  the  three  subcomponents.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the  water \nsupply  subcomponent  is  35%,  and  the  average  EIRR  for  the  environmental  infrastructure \ncomponent  is  18.7%.  Projected  cash  flows  suggest  that  the  rainwater  tanks  and  solid  waste \nmanagement  centers  will  be  financially  sustainable,  including  replacement  costs  of  equipment \nas  well  as  O&M.  Though  the  surveys  did  not  demonstrate  full  cost  recovery  for  the  sanitation \nand sewage treatment subcomponent, they indicate provision of sufficient resources for O&M. \nThe economic and financial analyses are in Appendix 14. \n \nB. \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n60. \nThe success of the Project in meeting its goal assumes that the country\u2019s economy will \ncontinue  to develop  and  the  Government  will  successfully  implement  its  regional  development \nprogram.  \n \n61. \nImplementation  Risk.  Project  implementation  assumes  that  skilled  and  experienced \nstaff  is  available  for  project  activities.  Key  Government  agencies  do  not  have  enough  skilled \nstaff, but the project design will solve this problem through consultancies and training.  \n \n62. \nInstitutional Risk. Improving atoll administration assumes that (i) staff trained under the \nProject will not be transferred to other institutions; (ii) collection, analysis, and management of \nenvironmental data and drafting of land-use plans will be timely; and (iii) MOAD and the PIUs \nwill be committed to the Project and receive the resources to carry out their mandate.  \n \n63. \nOperation  and  Maintenance  Risk.  Unless  cooperatives  are  allowed  to  exist  as  legal \nentities  and  engage  in  multipurpose  activities,  sanitation  facilities  are  not  likely  to  be \nsustainable.  Once  the  draft  cooperative  regulation  becomes  effective,  communities  may \nestablish \nand \nutilities, \ntelecommunications.  The  cooperative  will  increase  community  self-development  and  reduce \ndependence  on  top-down  approaches.  However,  certain  island  chiefs  may  perceive  these \ncooperatives  as  infringing  upon  their  authority  and  may  not  encourage  the  creation  of  an \nenabling  environment  for  their  adequate  functioning.  The  Government  must  ensure  that \ncooperatives  can  operate  free  of  political  intervention,  adequate  regulation  is  enacted  and  the \nappropriate Government agency has the power to protect the environment and public interest. \nThe  Government  should  help  cooperatives  become  financially  sustainable  by  endorsing  and \nsupporting the proposed structure and administration system. \n \nCoordination  with  Tsunami  Recovery  Activities.  The  Government  must  ensure  that \n64. \nactivities  undertaken  through  the  Project  are  adequately  sequenced  with  the  overall  tsunami \nrecovery  effort.  Long-term  institutional  strengthening  objectives  under  the  Project  should  be \npursued within the regional development context.  \n \n\ncooperatives \n\npotentially \n\nelectricity \n\nincluding \n\nprovide \n\nto \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the Ministry of Finance and \n\n65. \nTreasury have given the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  within  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness,  (a)  a \nNPSC will have been established, and (b) each PIU  will have been established \nand fully staffed to the satisfaction of ADB;  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 19\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nRPACs will be established in each of the Focus Islands within 3 months of loan \neffectiveness; \nThe  Government  will  not  replace  the  PMU  project  director  or  any  of  the  PIU \nmanagers without ADB\u2019s prior approval; \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  no  physical  infrastructure  within  the  scope  of \nthe Project will be constructed on Mahibadhoo, Naifaru, and Fonadhoo until the \nGovernment,  through  MHUDB,  has  approved  their  land-use  plan.  The  technical \ncommittee established under MHUDB and mandated to approve land-use plans \nwill be required to assess them and either approve them or provide comments for \nreview and revision within 3 months of the plans\u2019 submission;  \nThe  Government  will  provide  support \nformulation.  The \nIDP \nGovernment  will  ensure  that,  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  each \nselected  island  will  have  (a)  its  IDP  formulated  and  properly  sanctioned  by  the \nauthorized agency, and (b) base maps completed to the satisfaction of ADB. The \nselected  islands  refer  to  those  islands  within  the  North  Central,  Central,  and \nSouth  Central  regions,  which  will  formulate  their  land-use  plans  through  the \nProject; \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  land-use  and  atoll  development  plans  will \nbe  formulated  consistently  and  cohesively,  and  that  they  integrate  the  islands\u2019 \nneeds and aspirations as reflected in the IDP; \nThe Government will help establish a cooperative within each island community, \nand  allow  the  cooperatives  to  plan,  design,  construct,  operate,  and  maintain \n(including  impose  tariff  charges  on  end  users)  public  utilities  and  their \ninfrastructure; \n\nfacilitate \n\nto \n\n(x) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  submit  to  the  Parliament,  within  2  years  of  loan \neffectiveness, the draft cooperative law, which will allow cooperatives to exist as \nlegal entities and assume the responsibility to, among other things, operate and \nmaintain public utilities; \nThe Government will ensure that no physical infrastructure in the Focus Islands \nis constructed for sanitation and solid waste management until an O&M strategy \nhas  been  drafted,  including  methodology  for  tariff  structure  and  tariff  collection \nand administration developed in a participatory and consultative manner; \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  throughout  project  implementation,  any \ninvoluntary  resettlements  will  be  mitigated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement,  Handbook  on  Resettlement,  and \nthe  proposed \nresettlement plan; \nThe Government will ensure that all environmental mitigation measures identified \nin  the  IEE  are  incorporated  into  the  project  design  and  implemented  during \nproject  construction  and  O&M, \nthe  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy,  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). The Government will also ensure \nthat  environmental  compliance  with  the  above  requirements  and  environmental \nmonitoring  results  collected  throughout  the  Project  are  reported  in  the  quarterly \nreports submitted to ADB; \nThe Government will ensure that women will occupy 25% of managerial positions \nin  the  PMU  and  PIUs.  The  Government  will  implement  the  agreed-on  gender \naction plan; \n\nin  accordance  with \n\n(xii) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xiii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  throughout  project  implementation,  adequate \nbudgetary allocations of the required counterpart funds are made and approved \nand released on time; \n\n\f 20 \n\n \nB. \n\n66. \n \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\n(iii)  \n\n(iv)  \n\n \n\n \n\n(xiv)  The Government will ensure that independent external auditors will audit project \naccounts,  including  the  imprest  accounts.  The  annual  audited  accounts  and \nfinancial  statements,  together  with  audit  reports,  will  be  submitted  within  6 \nmonths following the end of the relevant Government fiscal year; \nBefore  establishing  the  imprest  accounts,  the  Government  will  appoint  an \naccountant in the PMU and each PIU; \n\n(xv) \n\n(xvi)  Baseline information will be collected and submitted to ADB within the first year \n\nof project implementation. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe following conditions are to be complied with prior to loan effectiveness: \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  the  necessary  legal  framework,  through  a  legal \ninstrument to be issued by the President, to allow cooperatives to exist as legal \nentities and to assume, among other things, O&M of public utilities; \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  PIU  managers,  whose  time  will  be  fully \ndedicated to the Project, have been appointed to the satisfaction of ADB; \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  PMU  will  have  been  established  and  fully \nstaffed to the satisfaction of ADB. \nThe  Government  will  formally  approve  guidelines  that  will  define  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities  of  the  various  stakeholders  involved  developing  the  islands  and \natolls.  \n\nC. \n\nConditions for Loan Negotiation \n\nThe Government will ensure that the PMU project director, whose time will be dedicated \n\n67. \nto the Project, has been appointed to the satisfaction of ADB. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n68. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  3,903,000  to  the \nRepublic  of  the  Maldives  for  the  Regional  Development  Project,  Phase  II  \u2013  Environmental \nInfrastructure and Management, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at \nthe rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n \n \n \n\n5 April 2005 \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n  \n \n\nJoseph B.

Of  these,  MOAD  is  the  primary  agency  responsible  for \natoll  development,  and  also  for  regional  development  in  the  atolls.  The  function  of  MOAD  is \nchanging  from  atoll  administration  to  development,  in  keeping  with  the  regional  development \npolicies  of  the  Government.  Atoll  and  island  administrative  agencies  are  taking  on  new \nresponsibilities and functions. \n \nB. \n\nProject  Implementation  Capacity  of  Community  Based  Organizations,  Non-\nGovernmental Organizations, and the Private Sector.  \n\nThe choice of implementation modality may vary case by case, depending on the island, \n3. \nbut  the  focus  will  be  on  community-based  or  private  sector-based  solutions.  Different  island \ncommunities  have  varied  organizational  and  management  capacities  of  island  development \ncommittees  (IDCs),  island  offices,  and  the  private  sector.  Some  IDCs  have  demonstrated \nmanagement  and  technical  capacity  to  successfully  undertake  utility  management  in  the  long \nterm (e.g., electricity supply in Mahibadhoo), while others have do not have similar experiences \nin utility management (e.g., Naifaru). Many islands have other community-based organizations \n(such  as  district  associations,  youth  clubs,  or  social  development  clubs)  or  a  strong  private \nsector  that  undertake  community  activities  (such  as  education,  electricity  provision  and  cable \ntelevision) in lieu of the IDC or island office (e.g., Naifaru, Fonadhoo. and Gan-Laamu). \n \n4. \nThe lack of capacity of IDCs in planning and implementation of development projects will \nbe  a  serious  impediment  to  successful  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  IDCs  are  mainly \ninvolved  in  the  provision  of  social  services,  such  as  preschool  education,  electricity  provision, \ncommunity  rainwater  tanks,  and  harbor  development.  However,  these  projects  have  been \nmainly  carried  out  on  an  ad  hoc  basis,  with  a  focus  on  service  provision  rather  than  project \nsustainability and self-sustainability. Integrated community planning, supported by strengthened \nhuman  resource  capability  of  IDCs,  specifically  in  development  planning,  monitoring  and \nimplementation,  and  financial  management  and  administration,  is  required.  In  cases  where \n\n\f \n\n          Appendix 2 \n\n       27\n\n \n\n \n\ndevelopment  planning  has  taken  place,  to  some  extent,  implementation  by  IDCs  has  been \nconstrained by limited availability of development financing. Their lack of legal status is also a \nmajor  constraint  in  obtaining  loans  from  financial  institutions,  necessitating  a  Government \nguarantee,  which  may  not  be  forthcoming.  This  issue  needs  to  be  urgently  addressed,  if  the \nwater  and  sanitation  and  solid  waste  management  subcomponents  are  to  be  implemented  by \ncommunity-based  organizations  (CBOs).  MOAD  is  reported  to  be  working  to  develop  the \nlegislation  to  establish  IDCs  as  legal  entities.  Within  this  context,  the  formation  of  community \ncooperatives  to  implement  and  manage  small-scale  improvements  to  island  services  and \nutilities will be possible. However, the normal legal process may lag behind the implementation \nof  the  Project,  and  it  should  be  fast-tracked  to  ensure  the  feasibility  of  community-based \nimplementation.   \n \nOther  CBOs  involved  in  development-related  initiatives  are  typically  youth  clubs,  past \n5. \npupil\u2019s associations, environmental clubs, and sports clubs. However, these organizations lack \neven  the  semiformal  role  of  IDCs  and  women\u2019s  development  committees  (WDCs)  in \ndevelopment  planning  and  participation.  CBOs  are  typically  weak,  poorly  managed,  and \ninvolved in immediate community-related work, rather than long-term development activities. In \nislands with divisions between settlement districts, CBOs occasionally function as ad hoc district \norganizations  that  take  on  development  functions  of  the  IDC,  such  as  providing  preschool \nservices  and  electricity.  CBO  leadership  and  initiative  is  stronger  in  such  situations,  possibly \nbecause of the competitive spirit between districts, leading to greater community participation in \nsuch CBOs. Competition between CBOs for available public and private funds, and the drive to \ntake  on  bigger  projects  than  the  competing  CBO,  have  also  led  to  problems  such  as \nmismanagement  of  funds,  and  undertaking  of  inappropriate  large-scale  projects  that  end  up \nbeing a financial drain on community resources.   \n \n6. \nPrivate  sector  involvement  in  the  provision  of  social  services  is,  in  general,  poorly \ndeveloped in the atolls. While major private companies are involved in economic activities such \nas tourism and fisheries, other sectors, including the provision of social services and utilities, are \ntypically  on  a  small  scale,  and  have,  in  general,  not  been  sustained.  Past  initiatives  in  the \nprovision  of  health  services  by  private  parties  petered  out  due  to  expansion  of  the  national \nhealth  service  infrastructure.  Similarly,  private  sector  provision  of  education  services  and \ninfrastructure is limited,  and focused on specific sectors such as preschooling, and tuition and \nQur\u2019an classes. Private suppliers of electricity services and of cable TV services are also being \nforced out by entry of IDCs into such ventures. \n \nWhile  no  established  indicators  measure  the  success  of  IDCs,  other  CBOs,  and  the \n7. \nprivate  sector  in  undertaking  development  projects,  there  is  great  variation  on  the  level  of \ncommunity  development  between  and  within  the  atolls.  Such  variation  cannot  be  directly \nattributed  to  the  CBOs,  as  there  are  other  external  factors  such  as  Government\u2019s  national \npriorities;  sectoral  development  initiatives  taken  by  Government  agencies;  and  internal  factors \nsuch physical, natural, human, and supporting infrastructure characteristics that come into play.   \n \nC. \n \n8. \nFour  fundamental  weaknesses  in  the  policy  framework  have  been  identified:  (i) \ninadequate  policy  integration  among  Vision  2020;  sixth  National  Development  Plan;  Maldives \nEconomic Strategy; and sectoral, regional, atoll, and island development plans; (ii) inadequate \ndefinition  of  policy  and  planning  framework  for  regional  development;  (iii)  lack  of  operational \nobjectives,  target  setting,  and  establishment  of  measurable  performance  indicators  and \nbenchmarking to link the strategic policies to desired outputs; (iv) lack or real consensus of atoll \n\nOverlaps, Gaps, and Weaknesses in Institutional Framework \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nin  mandates  and \n\nA  number  of  overlaps,  gaps,  and  weaknesses \n\nand island stakeholder groups for the national population and development consolidation policy \nand its implementing mechanisms. \n \n9. \ninstitutional \narrangements  have  also  been  observed  in  land-use  planning,  environmental  management, \nsanitation, and water supply. Institutional analysis shows overlapping mandates and functions of \nthe  Maldives  Housing  and  Urban  Development  Board  (MHUDB),  MOAD,  and  the  Ministry  of \nPlanning  and  National  Development  (MPND),  given  that  all  three  have  some  capacity  for \nsurveying  and  land  planning.  Gaps  are  evident  in  that  land-use  planning  guidelines  and \nmonitoring mechanisms in the atolls are not articulated or established. The activities of MOAD in \nland-use  planning  in  the  islands  proceed  in  an  ad  hoc  manner  and  are  reported  to  be \ninconsistent. \n \n10. \nIn contrast to many other areas of environmental management, the Maldives Water and \nSanitation  Authority  (MWSA)  has  a  clear  mandate  and  responsibility  for  water  resources \nmanagement  and  supply,  including  establishing  the  regulatory  framework,  standards,  and \nenforcement arrangements for water resources use and management. There are no overlaps in \nmandate with other agencies. Weaknesses include the lack of \u201csoft\u201d institutional arrangements, \nlaws, or policies to administer water resources management, and lack of second-tier regulatory \ndevices  such  as  standards,  guidelines,  and  codes  of  practice.  The  technical  and  monitoring \nservices  provided  by  MWSA  to  atoll  and  island  populations  are  limited.  Although  broad-based \npolicies for water resources management and pollution control are expressed in environmental \nplanning  documents,  there  are  no  implementing  arrangements  to  address  them  under  the \nEnvironment  Law.  Thus,  there  is  a  gap  in  environmental  controls  and  monitoring  of  water \nresources management that is neither filled by MWSA, nor by the Environment Section of MEC. \n \n11. \nThe institutional arrangements for sanitation and solid waste disposal are also weak, and \npoorly articulated and implemented. In this respect, while there is no overlap in the mandate of \nthe MOH, MEC and MWSA, there are distinct overlaps in work programs and projects.  There is \nambiguity as which agency is assigned the primary responsibility for solid waste management. \nWater  supply  and  sanitation  management  cannot  be  separated  from  the  carrying  capacity  of \nislands and their ecosystems, and hence must be integrated into land-use planning. \n \n12. \nOverall  institutional  capacity  for  environmental  conservation  and  management  is \nconstrained  by  the  existence  of  a  large  number  of  institutions  mandated  with  the  sustainable \nuse, development, and conservation of terrestrial and marine resources. While the mandates for \nterrestrial  and  marine  resource  conservation  and  use  are  shared  by  different  agencies  (MEC, \nMOFAMR, MOAD, and MOFT), coordination among these agencies on policies, strategies, and \nprograms  needs  to  be  strengthened.  Gaps  in  the  institutional  structure  include  inadequate \nformal and nonformal vertical and horizontal linkages and mechanisms for coordinating policies, \nstrategies,  and  actions  with  respect  to  shared  mandates  and  harmonization  of  policies  and \nregulatory framework with respect to resource systems. \n \nD. \n \n13. \nThe institutional strengthening component is designed to support the Government\u2019s \npolicy of regional development and to build capacity at national and local levels to manage and \nimplement the Project. This component will focus on three major areas: (i) training and capacity \nbuilding  of  local  project  implementation  units  (PIUs);  (ii)  strengthening  capacity  of  national \nagencies to provide technical support; and (iii) provide support to regional development. \n \n\nInstitutional Strengthening \n\n\f \n\n \n\n          Appendix 2 \n\n       29\n\n \n\nTraining and Capacity Building of Local Project Implementation Units \n\n1. \n \n14. \nThis  component  primarily  addresses  capacity  building  in  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental  management  subcomponents  and  will  be  supported  by  building  project \nmanagement  and  implementation  capacity  at  the  atoll  and  island  offices.  This  will  be \naccomplished  by  (i)  establishing  the  regulatory  framework  and  institutional  arrangements \nnecessary for devolving environmental management to the local level (local government office, \nNGO,  CBO,  or  the  private  sector);  (ii)  training  atoll  and  island  office  staff,  and  staff  to  be \nappointed  in  the  PIUs  in  sector  policy,  project  planning,  and  management,  and  the  social, \ntechnical,  and  financial  aspects  of  project  implementation  modalities;  and  (iii)  providing  the \nrequired  resources,  and  technical  support  and  field  experience  to  PIU  staff  in  project \nimplementation. PMU and other line agency consultants and staff will provide the required on-\nthe-job training, field experience, and technical assistance. \n \n\n2. \n\nStrengthen Capacity of National Agencies to Provide Technical Support \n\n \n15. \nProject management  and implementation responsibilities fall primarily on three  national \nagencies,  MOAD,  MHUDB,  and  MWSA.  These  agencies  have  varying  responsibilities  in \nimplementing  project  subcomponents,  primary  among  these  being  the  establishment  of \nregulatory measures and guidelines, and technical support to local agencies (or parties) working \nwithin  these  guidelines.  The  Project  is  designed  to  provide  support  for  these  agencies  to \nundertake  these  roles,  through  (i)  providing  technical  assistance  to  develop  and  implementing \nthe  required  regulatory  measures  and  guidelines,  (ii)  assisting  line  agencies  to  build \nprofessional  and  technical  capacity  in  specific  areas  by  providing  opportunities  for  overseas \neducation  and  skills  development,  and  (iii)  providing  additional  resources  and  capability  to \nundertake the project components. \n \n\n3. \n\nProvide Support to Regional Development \n\n \n16. \nThe Project will lend support to regional development by assisting in the development of \nthe  social  constituency  for  regional  development  in  the  Central  Regions  through  social \nmobilization  and  institutional  strengthening  inputs.  Capacity  building  and  skills  development \ninputs  to  MOAD  and  atoll  and  island  offices  will  promote  and  facilitate  needs  based  regional \ndevelopment.  Support  will  be  provided  to  MPND  to  undertake  a  case  study  in  economic \ndevelopment  planning  in  a  selected  regional  growth  center  and  atoll  (e.g.,  Fonadhoo/Gan-\nLaamu  Atoll).  Capacity  building  of  CBOs  and  the  private  sector  in  project  implementation  and \nenvironmental  management  will  enhance  their  capacity  to  participate  actively  in  regional \ndevelopment initiatives. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE  \n \n\n                              Type of     Source                      Year             Amount \n\n                       \n\nStart    End            ($) \n\n30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nGrant \n\nGrant \n\nGrant \n\nGrant \n\nGrant \n\n         \n\nStudents \n\nGrant \nGrant \n\nGrant \nGrant \n\nDisposal Area \n\nDisposal Project \n\n Agriculture \n1.

An \ninternational  consultant  and  a  national  consultant  will  be  appointed  to  provide  advice  and \ndevelop  community  organization  packages,  the  former,  and  long-term  advisory  and  training \nsupport, in the case of the latter. \n \n2. \nIt  is  expected  that  from  the  third  quarter  of  the  first  year  of  implementation,  the  social \ndevelopment staff in the project management unit (PMU) and each of the PIUs, and staff of the \nNGOs identified will be trained in participatory approaches; development of criteria for selecting \ncommunities  to  organize;  community  organization;  participatory  land-use  planning;  and \npreparation  of  management  plans  for  structuring,  organizing,  and  running  a  cooperative.  This \nstaff  will  be  sensitized  to  concerns  about  gender  and  development.  The  international  and \nnational  consultants  will  conduct  the  required  training  through  on-the-job  training,  workshops, \nand seminars. \n \n3. \nThe  Project  will  collect  baseline  information  on  communities  to  prioritize  them,  taking \naccount of the particular needs of structures already set up for community-based management, \nsuch as the island development committees and women development committees. Information \non  communities  collected  in  the  process  of  prioritizing  targets  will  also  serve  for  project \nmonitoring and evaluation. Communities in the focus islands will be favored at initial stages of \nthe  program,  followed  by  the  communities  in  their  respective  atolls.  From  year  3  onward, \ncommunities in the remaining atolls will be assisted in community organization. \n \n4. \nOrganizing  communities  for  utilities  management  will  begin  with  training  and  advice  to \npromote  their  cohesion.  The  rights,  responsibilities,  and  customs  of  each  community  structure \nwill be elaborated and individual responsibilities clarified. Local techniques for demarcating key \nboundaries  will  be  applied.  Once  the  community  structures  are  established,  monthly  meetings \nwill  be  held  with  leaders,  representatives,  and  members  of  communities;  representatives  of \nhouseholds with female heads; and representatives of poor households to familiarize them with \nthe  objective, components,  and  outputs  of the  Project,  and the  evolving regulatory framework. \nThe  meetings  will  also  offer  advice  the  rights  of  different  groups  of  users,  their  roles  and \nresponsibilities  as  community  members,  the  benefits  of  equal  participation  by  women  and \nconflict  resolution  mechanisms,  as  well  as  provide  information  on  their  capacity  for  utility \nmanagement.  These  meetings  will  require  that  staff  travel  to  the  islands  at  times  that  suit  the \nschedules of each community.  \n \nIt  is  estimated  that  approximately  6  months  will  be  required  before  the  community \n5. \nfinalizes and agrees on the approach to community-based management, and sufficient capacity \nis  created  among  community  leaders  for  them  to  undertake  such  functions  as  monitoring, \naccounting, and bookkeeping. Inputs and outputs to be provided by the environmental engineer, \naccountant,  and  social  development  PIU  staff  will  be  identified  by  the  international  community \ndevelopment  consultant,  provided  in  the  form  of  a  program  to  be  piloted  in  the  focus  islands, \nand  refined  based  on  experience  with  the  assistance  of  the  international  team  leader  and \nfinancial  manager  specialist,  and  national  deputy  team  leader,  and  social  development \nspecialists.  Thereafter,  staff  will  continue  to  interact  to  encourage  communities  to  formulate \nmanagement plans and build the capacity of women to participate in decision making. On their \nside, the communities will monitor their own needs and increase in capacity and will report every \n\n\f     Appendix 4 \n\n \n\n33 \n\n3 months to the PIU staff. Indicators will be selected jointly among the community, PIU staff, and \nsupport  consultants.  Training  and  awareness  should  be  contain  modules  such  as  legal  status \nand formation of cooperatives, organization and structure for managing a cooperative, defining \nroles and responsibilities, and sensitizing toward the need to introduce user charges to ensure \nthe sustainability of the subcomponents.  \n \n6. \nPreferably  toward  the  end  of  the  second  year,  staff  on  each  project  island  will  hold  a \nparticipatory  workshop  to  publicize  the  results  of  community  organization  and  encourage \nfeedback.  From  the  third  year,  the  Project  will  extend  its  reach  to  other  communities.  At  the \nsame time, however, staff will have to backstop the communities organized earlier. Project staff \nwill  need  to  continuously  work  in  the  field  in  training  and  extension  at  the  community  level, \ntraining  women\u2019s  groups  for  full  participation,  developing  the  knowledge  and  skills  of  the \nmembers  of  community,  developing  dynamic  rules  that  will  reflect  changing  scenarios  as \ncommunity-based  management  systems  become  stronger,  and  evolving  strategies  for  utility \nmanagement over time.  \n \nIf  appropriate,  from  the  end  of  the  third  year,  communities  on  the  focus  islands  will \n7. \nreceive technical advice on how to operate and maintain the sanitation and sewage treatment \nschemes, as well as solid waste management center facilities. Based on the atoll-wide strategy \nstudy  undertaken  by  the  Project,  solid  waste  collection  and  management  training  will  be \nextended  to  other  islands.  Technical  training  packages  and  manuals  will  be  prepared  by  the \nteam leader in coordination with the deputy team leader, whereas the theoretical and on-the-job \ntraining will be provided by the PIU staff, initially supported by the team leader and deputy team \nleader.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nGENDER ACTION PLAN \n\n1. \nThe  uneven  regional  development  in  the  Maldives  has  increasingly  disadvantaged \nwomen. Women\u2019s participation in the labor force has fallen from 63% in 1977 to 37% in 2002.1 \nParticipation in decision  making remains low,  with  women  accounting for only 4.8%  of elected \nmembers  of  Parliament.  Traditional  attitudes,  low  access  to  higher  education,  and  limited \nemployment opportunities largely constrain women to unpaid tasks of family and community life. \n \nFocus  group  discussions  and  consultations  with  stakeholders  confirmed  the  major  role \n2. \nwomen  play  in  solid  waste  and  water  resource  management.  Women  spend  substantial  time \nsweeping  outdoors  and  fetching  water  from  wells  and  community  tanks.  Active  involvement  in \nmanaging  solid  waste  and  water  will  make  women  the  best  source  of  information  regarding \nquantity, quality, and reliability of water used, and the quantity and type of wastes generated by \nher  household.  Communication  and  interaction  with  women  is  more  effective  when  done  by \nother women. Women will be important beneficiaries of the Project and can play a valuable role \nin its implementation.  \n\n \n\n3. \nDuring the social mobilization of communities, the importance of women\u2019s participation will \nbe  explained  to  beneficiary  communities  in  village  meetings,  hygiene  education,  and  all  other \nproject  activities.  The  following  targets  will  be  achieved  in  the  implementation  of  urban  and \nenvironmental  infrastructure,  integrated  land  use  planning,  development  of  a  regional  growth \ncenter framework, and community mobilization:  \n \n\n(i)   Women  will  participate  actively  in  community  meetings  and  small  group  activities, \n\nwith women constituting 50% of participants.   \n\n(ii)   Half  the  members  of  the  executive  committees  of  island  development  committees \n\n(iii)  \n\n(iv)  \n\nwill be women. \nSeparate  discussions  will  be  undertaken  with  women\u2019s  groups  on  technologies, \nservice level of components of the Project, and social and infrastructure priorities for \nthe development of communities. If major differences occur between women\u2019s groups \nand  mixed  or  men\u2019s  groups,  project  facilitators  will  take  an  active  role  in  ensuring \nwomen's opinions and decisions are reflected in project implementation. \nIn designing awareness campaigns, the role of women in the household will be taken \ninto account. \n\n \n4. \nThe  Implementing  Agency,  Ministry  of  Atolls  Development  (MOAD),  will  actively  recruit \nqualified  women  in  all  levels  of  the  project  implementation  structure,  especially  in  project \nimplementation  units.  The  capacity-building  component  related  to  training  will  specify  how  the \nparticipation  of  women  will  be  encouraged.  The  following  targets  will  be  achieved  in  project \nimplementation and institutional strengthening: \n \n\n(i)  Women  will  constitute  25%  of  professional/technical  staff  implementing  and \n\nmonitoring the Project.  \n\n(ii)  At least 30% of government staff receiving training benefits will be women. \n\n \n5.  MOAD will be responsible for developing and implementing appropriate strategies and action \nplans  to  achieve  these  targets.  The  IA  will  monitor  these  targets  through  project  progress \nreports and the project performance management system. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  United Nations. 2002.

Their  significance  as  selection  criteria  varies  from  island  to  island  in  the  light  of \nexisting levels of development, and the options available: \n \n\nThe best use of fresh water resources with minimum loss to island; \nMinimum  impact  as  source  of  groundwater  pollution,  which  has  to  be  protected \nfor long-term use; \nBoth acceptable to the community and cultural practice; \nAffordable capital and running costs, bearing in mind the costs of paying for other \nutilities; \nMinimal impact, compatible with communal health and the costs to the island, on \nthe marine environment; \nApplication of any solutions to other islands in the Central Regions. \n\nThe following main considerations underlie the approach to sanitation on all islands: \n \n(i) \n\nSewage  and  grey  water  should  be  separated  at  source  and  disposed  of \nseparately; \nDischarge  of  sewage  to  groundwater  should  be  avoided  in  all  future  sanitation \nschemes, and current discharges minimized; \nPrioritize water recharge to aquifer from grey water and treated effluent sources \n(following  guidelines  determining  spacing  between  such  sources  and  domestic \nwells); \nAll  discharges  to  the  near  shore  lagoon  environment,  treated  or  otherwise, \nshould be avoided; \nSanitation schemes should be fully accepted by the community and as simple as \npossible; \nTraining  and  support  in  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  system  must  be \narranged as part of any project. \n\nThe following principles as a background to selections of the sanitation schemes, should \n\n \n3. \nbe adopted: \n \n\nIsland  groundwater  is  essential  to  the  continued  sustainability  of  the  atolls  and \nshould be protected from sewerage; \nLow  gradient  simplified  sewer  systems  are  appropriate  and  effective  for  most \nislands. These are designed to carry only liquid effluent, must be used only with \nseptic tanks at household or communal level; \nSeptic tank effluent should if possible be provided with some form of secondary \ntreatment  before  final  discharge,  or  piped  directly  to  deep-water  disposal.  No \ndirect discharge to the near shore lagoon environment should be permitted; \nDeep-sea discharge of treated effluent should be considered as an option where \nenvironmental standards can be satisfied; \nReuse  of  treated  effluent  for  agricultural  purposes  should  be  considered  as  an \noption where environmental standards can be satisfied; \nSeptage should be re-used after drying rather than disposal at sea. Composting \nwith green wastes would be preferable; \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n2. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n(vii) \n\nSewage  and  grey  water  must  be  separated  at  source  (at  household  level);  this \npractice is well established but should be reinforced and explained; \n\n(viii)  To  maintain  the  usability  of  groundwater  and  sustain  resources,  all  grey  water \n\nmust be reused by re-infiltration. \n\n \nSummary Review of Sewerage, Sewage Treatment and Disposal Options \n\nB.  \n \n4. \nThe design and construction of sewers on atolls have unique challenges due to the low \nlevel  and  low  gradient  of  the  terrain.  Adequate  gradients  to  allow  self-cleansing  conventional \nsewers to function are not readily available without using below sea-level pumped interceptors.  \nIn some cases in the  Maldives  where  population densities are  high  enough  and  space for  on-\nsite  sanitation  is  severely  limited,  then  self-cleansing  conventional  sewers  similar  to  that  used \non  Mal\u00e9,  can  be  the  best  solution.  Table  A6.1  provides  a  summary  of  sewerage  options, \nwhereas Table A6.2 presents a summary of acceptable sewage treatment and disposal options. \n \nTable A6.1: Summary Review Sewerage and Disposal Options \n \n\nCost level \n\nRelatively \nhigh. \n\nSuitability \nHigh, needs \nreliable power \nsupply.

The \nProject  is  classified  as  under  category  B  in  accordance  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nGuidelines  Assessment  Environmental.  The  Project  will  have  no  significant  negative \nenvironmental  effect. The  project  activities  with  marginal  environmental  impacts  and  proposed \nmitigation  measures  are  summarized  in  this  summary  IEE.  Overall,  the  Project  is  expected  to \nresult in substantial environmental benefits. The objective is the Project is to enhance regional \nplanning  and  improve  environmental  and  land  management  through  a  community-centered \napproach.  This  will  be  achieved  through  the  provision  of  (i)  basic  environmental  and  social \ninfrastructure  to  the  poor  on  a  least-cost  yet  sustainable  basis,  (ii)  planned  development  and \nexpansion  of  island  settlements,  and  (iii)  increased  environmental  awareness  and  capacity  for \naddressing local environmental management. \n \nB.  \n \n2. \ninclude  (i) improving  environmental \ninfrastructure,  (ii)  strengthening  planning  and  environmental  management,  and  (iii)  building \nmanagement  and  implementation  capacity  in  the  Central  Regions.  Facilities  will  be  provided \nbased  on  projected  population  needs  in  2020.  The  sanitation  and  sludge  management \ncomponent  will  comprise  integrated  settled  sewerage  schemes  for  the  two  focus  islands \n(Fonadhoo  and  Mahibadhoo),  consisting  of  a  combination  of  septic  tanks,  and  small-bore \nsewerage. Treatment options involve treatment in reed beds. This will be followed by recharge \non land as a water conservation measure, provided World Health Organization (WHO) drinking \nwater  standards  are  met,  direct  discharge  to  deep-sea  water,  provided  World  Bank  effluent \ndischarge standards are met, or reuse for agricultural purposes. Discharge to the sea has been \nconsidered as an appropriate option to follow treatment, as this would result in rapid dilution and \nassimilation of any remaining nutrients and would prevent existing lagoon pollution. Sludge from \nseptic  tanks  will  be  dried  in  special  drying  beds  and  further  used  for  composting  with  green \nwastes has been proposed. \n \n3. \nThe  solid  waste  management  component  will  pilot  an  integrated  scheme  on  the  three \nfocus  islands,  where  waste  segregation  is  to  be  conducted  at  household  level,  solid  waste \ncollection,  processing,  and  recycling  will  take  place  in  a  single  waste  management  center, \nfollowed  by  transshipment  of  wastes  of  commercial  value.  The  land-use  planning  and \ndevelopment  component  will  provide  land-use  plans  for  24  islands  and  focus  on  provision  of \nsustainable  levels  of  population  and  housing  growth;  optimal  patterns  of  infrastructure \ndevelopment;  and  conservation  of  the  groundwater  aquifer,  coastlines,  and  other  ecologically \nimportant areas.  \n \nC.  \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n4. \nThe  1,192  low-lying  coral  islands  of  the  Maldives  archipelago  extend  over  26  atolls \ncovering 115,300 square kilometers (km2). The islands stretch over a distance of 860 kilometers \n(km) north to south, and 130 km east to west. The average area of the 199 inhabited islands is \n57.8 hectares (ha) and only three islands exceed an area of 400.0 ha. The maximum elevation \nis below 3 meters (m) above mean sea level and most (80%) of the land is less than 1 m above \nmean high-tide level. Thirteen of the atolls lie within the three Central Regions. Inside the atolls, \n\n\f \n\n     Appendix 7 \n\n39\n\nwater  depth  is  generally  less  than  80  m.  The  islands  comprise  layers  of  unconsolidated  shell \nand  coral  sand  and  debris,  lying  on  coral  rock,  which  are  normally  less  than  10  m  below  the \nsurface.  Soils  are  thin  (20  centimeters  or  less)  freely  draining  and  highly  alkaline.  There  is \nabundant  calcium,  magnesium,  and  phosphorus,  and  sufficient  iron.  The  tropical  climate  is \ndominated  by  two  monsoon  periods.  Temperature  is  25\u221230  Celsius  (oC),  and  rainfall  is  about \n2,000 millimeters per annum. Water on the islands occurs almost entirely as groundwater within \nthe aquifer that overlies the coral rock. \n \nThe Maldives displays a pristine marine environment. The well-being of the coral reef is \n5. \nof  concern  at  national  and  international  levels.  Marine  biological  diversity  is  exceptional  and \nconsidered to be one of the world\u2019s richest ecosystems. There are 187 species of coral, 1,090 \nrecognized  species  of  fish,  and  almost  300  species  of  marine  algae.  There  are  also  seven \nspecies of dolphins, nine species of whales, and five species of turtles, all of which endangered. \nThe diversity of terrestrial ecosystems is limited by the smallness of the land areas, shallowness \nof the soil, and the high soil salinity.  In spite of this, more than 260 native species of flora are \nrecorded, and 18 species of birds are now protected under the Environmental Law. From 1995 \nto 1999, 25 protected marine areas were delineated in the Maldives. \n \nD.  \n \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nLocation \n\n1. \n \n6. \nThe  Project\u2019s  sanitation  and  sewage  schemes  are  on  islands  where  sewage  is \ndischarged into lagoons. Location of reed beds (below ground level), requiring large areas, and \nsludge  drying  beds  may  result  in  potential  odor  problems  in  a  confined  island  context.  The \nlocation  of  such  facilities  will  be  selected  in  consultation  with  authorities  and  the  local \npopulation.  A  buffer  zone  with  appropriate  vegetation  will  be  incorporated,  where  possible,  to \nattenuate nuisance and improve aesthetics. \n \n7. \nThe proposed waste management centers can give rise to noise, traffic, and unpleasant \nodors. In addition to avoiding residential areas, where possible, the site will be selected taking \ninto  account  prevailing  wind  directions.  The  center  should  be  in  the  coastal  area,  above  the \nmaximum  high-tide  level.  Deposition  bays  receiving  segregated  household  wastes  for  each  of \nthe schemes will be positioned conveniently to allow households easy access, while minimizing \nvisual impact and potential odor problems. \n \n\nDesign  \n\n2. \n \n8. \nPipe sizing and material selection to meet projected demands will be carefully selected \nto ensure no leakage, scheme impairment, or soil contamination. Accessibility for repair and de-\nblocking  activities  will  also  be  considered  for  engineering  design.  In  order  to  prevent  potential \ncontamination  resulting  from  inadequate  mixing  and  dispersion  of  sewage  effluent  discharge \ninto  deep-sea  water,  the  discharge  location  will  be  carefully  identified  based  on  variations  in \nmarine current direction, depth, tidal stage and season, as well as interflow between lagoon and \nsea.1  Monitoring  will  be  conducted  to  ensure  that  no  physical  or  chemical  imbalances  affect \nbiological and ecosystem activity. The waste management site will be equipped to prevent the \nspread of collected waste outside the containment area, and monitoring mechanisms will ensure \nappropriate waste segregation. \n\n                                                 \n1   A separate hydrological study will be undertaken. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nConstruction \n\n3.  \n \n9. \nThe  effects  of  trenching  for  settled  effluent  sewerage  system  will  be  minimal  at \nFonadhoo  and  Mahibadhoo,  as  the  depth  needed  is  shallow.  All  excavation  is  above \ngroundwater  level,  less  than  1.2  m  deep.  If  found  necessary,  dewatering  have  to  be  carefully \nmonitored. Use of small pumps and other efforts will be made to recharge any locally pumped \ngroundwater  to  prevent  induced  salinity  intrusion,  which  would  affect  household  wells  in  the \nvicinity.  Re-injection  or  re-infiltration  of  groundwater  removed  by  pumping  during  excavation \nworks to keep the ground dry during construction must be stipulated in the construction contract.  \n \n10. \nExcavation  and  anchoring  activities  in  the  lagoon  and  any  works  leading  to  the \nconstruction  of  a  marine  effluent  discharge  pipeline  could  lead  to  undesired  turbidity  and \nsedimentation.  Equipment  selection  will  take  this  factor  into  account.  Moreover,  works  will \npreferably  take  place  when  tidal  flushing  is  sufficient  to  avoid  damage  to  the  reef  or  lagoon \nenvironment. Access will be disrupted during construction activities. In addition, noise, vibration, \nand  dust  generation  are  likely  to  affect  the  population  during  construction.  Contractors\u2019 \ntemporary  plant,  equipment  storage,  and  living  quarters  can  also  be  short-term  environmental \nhazards.  Good  health  and  hygiene  practices  at  work  and  reduced  work  accidents  will  be \nachieved  by  means  of  an  occupational  health  and  safety  plan,  which  will  include  emergency \nplans,  personnel  basic  training,  first  aid  provisions,  a  comprehensive  domestic  solid  waste \nmanagement  plan,  and  sanitation  facilities  for  the  construction  camp.  The  supply  of  power  for \nthe  solid  waste  facility  schemes  will  involve  burial  of  power  cables  (or  suspension  of  power \ncables from poles), to be designed in a nonintrusive manner.  Water supply could be provided \nfrom an on-site shallow well located to minimize danger from leachate contamination. \n \n\nOperation  \n\n4. \n \n11. \nThe success of the sanitation systems hinges partly  on the  adequate  use of the septic \ntanks, whether domestic or communal. An important feature of good operation and maintenance \n(O&M) includes regular desludging of tanks, which could cause short-term odor problems. The \nappropriate functioning of reed beds and the overall sanitation scheme relies on preventing any \ntoxic  harmful  substances,  other  than  domestic  sewage,  from  entering  the  system.  Good \npractices  will  be  disseminated  through  a  dedicated  public  awareness  campaign.  Appropriate \noperation  and  maintenance  of  sewers,  sewage  pumping  stations,  or  reed  bed  treatment \nsystems will ensure no unpleasant odors are generated. Sludge disposal (composting enhancer \nor  fertilizer)  must  be  conducted  and  distributed  adequately  to  prevent  water  and  soil  pollution. \nDischarge from the desludging tanker onto drying beds may cause short-term odor impacts.   \n \n12.  Minor increases in road traffic caused by the disposal and collection of waste from bays \nare not expected to be significant in terms of road safety and/or noise generation. Operational \nproblems  from  odor  caused  by  temporarily  stored  putrescible  wastes  may  occur.  Leachate \ngeneration is unlikely to occur, provided waste is not stored for more than 1\u20132 weeks, Limited \ndanger of groundwater pollution is foreseen as the natural flow is seaward. Impermeable floor \nconcreting for the waste management center will prevent soil and groundwater pollution.  \n \nE.  \n \nTechnical  and  institutional  mitigation  measures  will  be  incorporated  in  the  detailed \n13. \ndesign of the Project. Measures of a planning, functional, institutional, and procedural character \nhave  to  be  included  in  the  site  selection  criteria,  tender  documents,  and  Occupational  Health \nSafety  Plan.  Mitigation  measures  related  to  construction  will  be  stated  in  the  contract  with  the \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring Plan and Institutional Requirements  \n\n\f \n\n     Appendix 7 \n\n41\n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure  \n\ncontractor,  who  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  its  own  environmental \nmanagement  plan.  The  project  management  unit,  Ministry  of  Atolls  Development,  will  be \nresponsible for monitoring and enforcement during construction. During the operational phase, \nthe Maldives Water and Sanitation Authority will be responsible for implementing environmental \nmeasures in the sector of water and sanitation, and Ministry of Construction and Public Works \nand  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Construction  (MEC)  will  be  responsible  for  implementing \nenvironmental  measures  in  the  solid  waste  management  sector.  MEC  will  be  responsible  for \noverseeing  overall  environmental  compliance  and  general  ecosystems  and  environmental \nmonitoring.  \n \n14.  MOAD will request two independent assessments of environmental performance during \nthe  project  period  by  a  random  sampling  of  project  schemes  and  will  focus  on  (i)  compliance \nwith environmental screening and related requirements, (ii) use of environmental guidelines for \nplanning  and  development,  (iii)  satisfactory  monitoring  by  the  island  office,  (iv)  satisfactory \nsupervision by the contractors; (v) good general level of project environmental performance, (vi) \nand  the  O&M  status  of  constructed  facilities. The  results  of  these  assessments  will  be  sent  to \nthe ADB for review. ADB will assess environmental compliance during its review missions. The \nenvironmental  monitoring  plan  includes  provisions  for  monitoring  (i)  groundwater  level,  (ii) \ngroundwater  quality  (salinity  and  anthropogenic  pollution),  (iii)  terrestrial  ecosystems  and \nbiodiversity, (iv) coastal erosion, (v) aquatic reef and lagoon ecosystems and biodiversity. \n \nF.  \n \n15.  Meetings  to  discuss  environmental  matters  were  held  with  residents,  including  women, \natoll  and  island  officials  for  each  of  the  focus  islands,  Government  agencies  and  the  United \nNations (UN) agencies in Male. For each island, the lack of an adequate sewerage system was \nseen  as  a  priority  concern,  together  with  the  problem  of  unmanaged  solid  waste.    Other \nsecondary  concerns  included  shortage  of  communal  rainwater  tank  storage,  and  the  need  for \nstreet paving. \n \nG.  \n \nOperationally, changes in sewage  disposal  practices from the current  discharge  of raw \n16. \nsewage directly or by infiltration into lagoons, to deep-sea discharge of treated sewage effluent \nor re-use by recharge, will have significant positive environmental impacts. The treated waste is \nrelatively  small  in  volume,  and  opportunity  for  dilution  is  large.  Nevertheless,  optimizing \ndischarge  location  will  mitigate  any  potential  negative  impact  on  the  marine  environment. \nReuse, recycling, and composting will be encouraged through the formulation of a solid waste \nmanagement strategy at the atoll level. Recommendations will be incorporated into the design \nof  the  solid  waste  management  centers,  in  this  way  preventing  soil  and  groundwater  table \npollution, as well as reducing or eradicating burning of waste and associated air pollution. \n \n17. \nThe  land-planning  component  offers  ample  opportunities  for  an  environmentally  aware \nuse  of  island  land  resources.  It  also  provides  an  opportunity  for  the  development  of  improved \nguidelines  for  the  use,  O&M  of  on-site  sanitation.  The  proposed  groundwater  pollution \ninvestigation  will  provide  valuable  guidance  for  spacing  drinking  water  and  sanitation  facilities. \nThere  are  some  minor  and  short-term  potentially  adverse  impacts  due  to  sanitation  and  solid \nwaste  management  center  construction,  which  are  controllable  through  enforcement  of \nappropriate construction contract conditions.  \n\nFindings, Recommendations, and Conclusions \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n4\n2\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n8\n \n\ni\n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n\nTable A8.1: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($ \u2018000) \nTotal Cost\nLC\n\nTotal\n\nFX\n\nFX\n\nADB Financed\nLC\n\nTotal\n\nGovernment\nLC\n\nTotal\n\n \n\nB.

The Government\u2019s sixth National Development Plan and Poverty Reduction Strategy places \nemphasis on balanced and equitable development. The Government\u2019s two-pronged strategy involves the development \nof  regional  centers  with  good  infrastructure  and  social  services  complemented  by  focus  islands  to  serve  as  service \nhubs and growth centers. In parallel, special targeted income support programs will be established.2 \n \nPoverty  reduction  requires  reducing  persistent  regional  income  inequality  and  non-income  disparities.  There  is  an \nacute  lack  of  employment  opportunities  in  the  atolls.  Existing  income  sources  are  also  threatened  due  to \nenvironmental  degradation.  With  regard  to  non-income  inequality,  there  is  a  lack  of  access  to  electricity,  transport, \ncommunications, education, health, potable drinking water, recreation facilities, and selected consumer goods; there is \nuneven  quality  of  housing  and  the  natural  environment;  and  there  is  widespread  incidence  of  food  security  and \nmalnutrition  in  the  atolls.  Facilitating  sustainable  livelihoods,  protecting  current  livelihood  sources  through \nenvironmental  improvement,  and  the  provision  of  basic  infrastructure  and  social  services  in  the  atolls  is  clearly \nrequired to reduce poverty. \n \nThe  Project  will  reduce  poverty  through  three  components:  (i)  improving  environmental  infrastructure  covering \nsanitation  and  sewerage  improvements,  provision  of  rainwater  tanks,  and  integrated  solid  waste  management;  (ii) \nstrengthening  planning  and  environmental  management  including  integrated  land-use  planning  and  management, \nformulation  of  an  economic  development  framework  study  for  regional  growth  centers,  developing  environmental \nawareness  programs,  and  environmental  monitoring;  and  (iii)  building  management  and  implementation  capacity \ncovering community mobilization facilitation, and institutional strengthening.  \n \nThe  country\u2019s  island  ecosystems  are  among  the  most  vulnerable.  Environmental  problems  are  rapidly  being \nmanifested  in  the  depletion  and  pollution  of  groundwater;  3  pollution  of  the  coastal  environment  due  to  inadequate \nsewage and solid waste disposal; and marine resource depletion. Addressing environmental issues is crucial in island, \natoll, and regional development. Environmental degradation can render an island uninhabitable, increase an island\u2019s \nvulnerability to natural disasters, and have impacts on key economic sectors particularly tourism and fisheries.4 The \nProject will develop sanitation and sewerage systems, and integrated solid  waste management in the focus islands. \nMany  islands  in  the  Maldives  have  run  out  of  groundwater,  and  the  little  that  they  have  is  either  saline  or \ncontaminated.  One  quarter  of  the  population  is  reported  to  have  no  access  to  safe  drinking  water,  and  half  of  the \npopulation depends on rainwater as their source of drinking water. While rainwater is considered safe, the quality of \nrainwater  tanks  affect  the  quality  of  water.  Households  with  no  rainwater  tanks  use  well  water  that  may  be \ncontaminated with  fecal  coliforms.  One  fifth  of  the  population  does not  use  sanitary  means of  excreta  disposal,  and \npoor hygiene has significant implications on health and the environment.5 Protecting environmentally sensitive areas \nand resources in the island and ensuring sustainable levels of development will be supported by the Project through \ndeveloping land-use plans in 24 islands. \n \nThe lack of capacities of local authorities and communities in the atolls and islands has constrained development. Due \nto this lack of capacity, the needs of communities in the atolls for social service and infrastructure development have \nbeen  determined  at  the  central  level.  Partnership  with  civil  society  and  other  stakeholders  will  be enhanced  through \nthe  Project.  It  will  facilitate  decentralized  decision  making  and  community  empowerment.  Strong  coordination  and \neffective  partnership  to  reduce  disparities,  particularly  in  the  atolls,  can  address  the  high  costs  of  infrastructure  and \nsocial services.  \n \nA concerted effort to provide basic infrastructure for environmental improvement, and social services; environmental \nmanagement; and integrated land-use planning and area development can promote private sector activities that will \nspur economic growth in the atolls. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

Poverty Analysis                                                                                                     Poverty Classification \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \n \nBoth income and non-income poverty exists in the Maldives. While there is no official poverty line, a vulnerability and \npoverty assessment assessed income poverty using three poverty lines Rf7.5 ($0.59), Rf10 ($0.78) and Rf15 ($1.17).6 \nUsing  these  thresholds, the  resulting poverty  headcounts are 15%, 22%,  and  43%,  respectively.  The overall  picture \ndoes  not  show  the  high  degree  of  regional  income  inequality  in  the  country.  An  estimated  70%  of  the  population \noutside Male have incomes equivalent to only the least wealthy 20% in Male. In comparison with Male, the country\u2019s \ncapital,  the  ratio  of  incomes  in  Male  compared  with  the  atolls  is  2:1,  with  the  ratio  increasing  to  3:1  when  lowest \naverage  per  capita  income  is  considered.  There  are  also  high  degrees  of  inequality  in  terms  of  social  and  physical \ninfrastructure  and  services.  This  inequality  is  estimated  at  4:1  on  average  between  Male  and  the  atolls.  In  addition, \npoverty may further increase following the tsunami disaster. \n \nThe  Project  will  be  undertaken  in  the  central,  north  central,  and  south  central  regions,  comprising  124 islands  in  13 \natolls.  Interventions  will  initially  concentrate  on  the  focus  islands  of  Fonadhoo-Gan,  Mahibadoo,  and  Naifaru  whose \npopulations  in  2000  were  3,984;  1,714;  and  3,707,  respectively.  These  areas  are  considerably  poorer  than  Male. \nBased on the 2000 census, while 44% of persons in Male had incomes less than Rf500 per month, the percentages in \nFonadhoo,  Mahibadhoo,  and  Naifaru  were  64.2%,  63.7%,  and  57.8%  respectively.  The  focus  islands  are \ncharacterized by high dependency ratios (80\u2212100 compared with 81 in Male); low levels of employment (52\u221255% on \naverage with females at lows of 33\u221236% compared with males at 72\u221277%); and lack of access to education beyond \ngrade 10. With the exception of Mahibadhoo, the focus islands experience negative net migration reflecting the lack of \njobs. \n \nThe  focus  islands  have  a  high  dependence  on  rainwater  as  a  source  of  drinking  water  (86\u221299%)  and  generally \nconsume  water  that  is  not  treated  (78-98%).  With  regard  to  sanitation,  in  Fonadhoo  and  Gan,  while  70%  and  45% \nhave toilets connect to septic tanks or latrines, 15% and 28% use areas of the beach as toilets. In Naifaru, 84% have \ntoilets connected directly to the sewer and to the sea, while 2.1% are connected to septic tanks or latrines.  \n \nDuring project preparation, a survey of 158 households which shows further non-income aspects of poverty related to \nthe interventions proposed under the Project. The survey shows that water shortages were experienced for 0.3 to 2 \nmonths  in  the  project  focus  islands.  Among  those  who  used  public  rainwater  tanks,  or  mosque  or  public  wells  as  a \nwater resource, an average of 2-3 trips per day were made to fetch water. Some respondents reported that there were \nproblems in drinking water quality such as taste, bad odor and color. Respondents proposed the provision of rainwater \ncatchments and tanks to more households. The survey reflects a lack of proper sanitation in the project focus islands. \nIn Fonadhoo and Mahibadhoo, most toilets are connected to septic tanks or latrines. However, there are households \nwithout toilet facilities in Fonadhoo and Gan. As many as 13% and 21% of respondents reported using the beach as \ntoilets in Fonadhoo and Gan, respectively. The surveys show that households strongly felt that groundwater is being \ndepleted  and  becoming  contaminated  due  to  bad  sewerage  systems.  Households  had  different  responses  to  the \nquestion  on  solid  waste  disposal.  In  Naifaru,  all  respondents  reported  discharging  into  designated  areas.  In \nMahibadhoo,  58%  reported  discharging  in  designated  areas  and  there  was  a  large  proportion  which  burned  solid \nwaste. In Fonadhoo and Gan, a large percentage\u201463% and 41%, respectively\u2014discharged solid waste on beaches \nor areas of dense vegetation. \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \n3  Soil is poor and highly porous, hence infiltration of rainwater is often immediate, with rainwater forming a lens that \nfloats on the saltwater table that rises and falls with the tide. This lens is the only source of water on small coral \nislands. Susceptible to rapid depletion and pollution caused by human activities. Exhaustion or contamination can \ncause irreparable damage rendering an island unfit for human habitation. \n\n4  About  18%  of  the  total  labor  force  is  engaged  in  primary  fishing  activities.  It  is  the  second  largest  Maldivian \nemployment  category  after  government.  The  vulnerability  and  poverty  assessment  analysis  on  the  distribution  of \nsectoral employment indicates that 98% of employment in the fisheries sector is found in the atolls, where it is the \nbiggest employer. Fishing remains the biggest employing activity in the outer island and is central to any poverty \nstrategy.  \n\n5  There  is  a  very  high  incidence  of  intestinal  parasite  infestation.  This  affects  50\u201375%  of  children  below  5,  and  is \n\nlinked to poor sanitation and to lack of potable and safe water supply on many islands.  \n\n6  United  Nations  Development  Programme  and  Ministry  of  Planning  and  National  Development.  1998.

Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nStakeholders  include  residents  in  the  islands,  island  level  community-based  organizations  (island  development \ncommittee,  women\u2019s  development  committee,  and  other  organizations  to  be  formed  for  maintaining  sewerage  and \nsanitation, and solid waste management facilities), atoll development committees, government agencies (ministries of \nfinance and treasury, atolls development, construction and public works, planning and national development; Maldives \nHousing  and  Urban  Development  Board;  Maldives  Water  and  Sanitation  Authority);  and  multilateral  organizations. \nRoles, responsibilities, and interests have been identified. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe Project is designed to undertake all components in a participatory manner, involving communities at the center of \nregional development. Communities do not have the strong absorptive capacity of communities needed to implement \nand sustain the project components. Civil society should partner with the Government. It is necessary to define a clear \nrole  for  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  so  that  the  sector  does  not  expand  in  an  ad  hoc,  uncoordinated \nmanner.  A  component  of  the  Project  will  facilitate  the  mobilization  of  communities  to  form  CBOs.  As  a  channel  for \nempowering people, community-based organizations can address a perceived need and common interest within the \ncommunity  bringing  large  benefits,  particularly  in  terms  of  social  capital  formation  (development  of  a  group-based \ncapacity to solve problems). Mobilizing CBOs and coordinating effective partnership with the Government will reduce \nthe high cost of infrastructure and social services in the atolls. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nUneven  regional  development  has  increasingly  disadvantaged  women.  Women  will  be  beneficiaries  in  the  Project \nprimarily  through  improved  living  conditions  at  home,  reduced  burden  for  solid  waste  management  and  water \ncollection,  and  reduced  risks  from  certain  diseases  and  related  costs.  Women  can  play  an  important  role  in \nimplementation.  The  Project  can  provide  women  access  to  decision-making  structures,  jobs,  income-generating \nactivities,  and  opportunities  to  instigate  and  manage  activities  related  to  the  Project\u2019s  components.  A  gender  action \nplan has been developed, describing targets to promote women\u2019s active involvement.   \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nE.

The Government has assured that should the \nProject result in unavoidable involuntary resettlement, a \nresettlement plan will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \npolicy on involuntary resettlement.  \nThe Project has been designed according to established \npractices on cost recovery.

The economic and financial analyses concentrate on evaluating the direct impact that the \nenvironmental  infrastructure  component  will  have  on  the  Central  Regions\u2019  economy  by  (i) \nimproving  sanitation  and  sewerage,  (ii)  supplying  safe  drinking  water,  and  (iii)  providing  an \nintegrated solid waste management system. In addition to these quantifiable benefits, the Project is \nexpected  to  have  substantial  nonquantifiable  benefits  due  to  improved  health,  welfare,  and \namenities, community mobilization, training, and gender-related activities.  \n \n2. \nThe  economic  analysis  has  been  conducted  following  the  Guidelines  for  the  Economic \nAnalysis  of  Projects  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  Financial  sustainability  of  the \nsubprojects  was  assessed  based  on  the  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and \nManagement  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank.  A  least-cost \nanalysis  was  undertaken  for  the  sanitation  and  sewage  treatment  subcomponent  while  a  cost-\nbenefit analysis was carried out for the sanitation and sewage treatment, solid waste management, \nand water supply subcomponents. The subprojects are evaluated over 20 years, with no salvage \nvalue assumed thereafter. \n \nB. \n \nQuantifiable  benefits  and  costs  were  examined  based  on  comparison  of  the  with-  and \n3. \nwithout-project  scenarios.  Financial  prices  used  in  the  analyses  were  identified  through  survey \ninformation  from  the  project  area,  as  described  in  the  feasibility  study,  or  provided  by  the \nGovernment. Economic prices were derived as follows: \n  \n\nApproach and Methodology \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nan exchange rate of $1 = Rf12.75 has been applied throughout; \nprices  are  based  on  2004  prices  and  adjusted  in  financial  costs  using  an  annual \ndomestic inflation rate of 1% and World Bank index projections for foreign costs; \neconomic analysis is made at constant 2004 prices; \neconomic analysis excludes taxes and duties; \neconomic  prices  use  the  domestic  price  numeraire  and  a  standard  exchange  rate \nfactor (SERF) of 1.11 is applied to the price of tradable goods; \nthe  economic  life  of  the  project  is  taken  as  20  years  including  5  years  project \nimplementation; and \nall plant, equipment, and furniture are assumed to be replaced on average every 10 \nyears through the project life. \n\nIn  addition,  it  must  be  highlighted  that  the  analyses  below  were  conducted  based  on \nwillingness  to  pay  collected  in  2004.  Although  tsunami  affected  communities  may  encounter \ndifficulties in paying user fees in the short term, their ability to pay is expected to be restored by the \ntime the Project is completed. \n\n \nEconomic Analysis \n\n1. \n\nC.  \n \n \n \n4. \nThe  water  supply  subcomponent  will  provide  a  rainwater  collection  credit  component \nprogram  to  assist  individual  households  in  the  Central  Regions  to  purchase  2,500-liter  rainwater \n\nWater Supply \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nstorage tanks, increasing the ability to meet their needs during dry periods.1 Credit will be provided \nin the form of a revolving fund and repaid by households at zero interest cost. The subcomponent \nwill  increase  the  stock  of  drinking  water  available  to  cover  dry  periods,  providing  11.5  additional \ndays of consumption at the observed daily per capita consumption of 36 liters in the target atolls. A \nstudy of rainfall patterns in Laamu Atoll2 indicates that dry periods of 4 or more days account for \n172 days per year distributed (Table 14.1). \n \n\nTable A14.1: Dry Periods and Opportunity Cost of Drinking Water \n \n\nItem \nDry Period Days \nDays Per Year \nMaldivian Rufiyaa per liter  \nProbability of Tank Supplies \n\n4 to 5 \n45.45 \n0.04 \n1.00 \n\n6 to 8 \n43.40 \n0.06 \n0.75 \n\nProbability \n9 to 11 \n20.00 \n0.08 \n0.50 \n\n12 to 14 \n22.10 \n0.10 \n0.25 \n\n15 days + \n41.20 \n0.10 \n0.00 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n5. \nEconomic benefit calculations were based on the following computations: (i) displaced cost \nof  desalinated  water  sold  ex-standpipe  at  Rf2  per  20  liter  container  (Rf0.1/liter)3  during  such  dry \nperiods,  and  (ii)  displaced  marginal  transportation  costs.  4  On  this  basis,  the  rainwater  tanks  will \nprove  strongly  viable.  Under  the  above  assumptions,  a  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  of \n29%, and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 26% were calculated for each individual tank. \nLags  between  repayment  of  loans  and  relending  by  the  fund  are  expected  to  be  short,  but  will \nreduce  the  overall  EIRR  to  24.9%.  Non-repayment  will  reduce  the  size  of  the  funds  for \nreinvestment rather than reduce the rate of return. \n \n6. \nIt  is  assumed  that  the  provision  of  safe  drinking  water  will  be  responsible  for  substantial \nimprovements  in  health,  the  economic  benefits  calculations  allow  for  further  computations  for    (i) \ndisplaced  waterborne  diseases  health  treatment  costs  (averaged  at  Rf400  in  surveyed  focus \nislands);  (ii)  displaced  loss  of  income  resulting  from  acute  diarrhea  and  waterborne  disease \nsymptoms,5 yielding an revised EIRR of 35%. \n \n7.  \nAssuming a 90% repayment rate with installments over 5 years, the funds provided by the \nproject  will directly finance 2,750  new  water tanks and reuse in the revolving fund is expected to \nfinance a further 10,000 over the 20-year project period. Under these circumstances, the FIRR for \neach  individual  beneficiary  will  be  much  higher,  up  to  60%  with  interest-free  installments  over  5 \nyears.  \n \n \n \n8. \nThe sewerage and sewage treatment subcomponent is designed to collect, treat, and safely \ndispose  of  domestic  wastewater  from  the  two  selected  islands.  A  least-cost  analysis  was  carried \n\nSanitation and Sewage Treatment and Disposal \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n1   Yearly water shortages range from 35.5% in Fonadhoo to 54% in Mahibadhoo. Periods can be up to 2 months. \n2   2001. Special Programme for Food Security in The Maldives, Food and Agriculture Organization, Male.  \n3   This price is assumed to apply in long dry periods. The value of tank water at the beginning of dry periods is less and \nassumed to be 40% of this level on the 4th and 5th days of dry spells, increasing to Rf 0.1/liter from the 12th dry day. \nIn  the  without-tank  case,  the  existing  storage  will  provide  water  for  the  first  few  days,  and  incremental  supply  is \nassumed  to  arise  from  the  4th  day.  At  the  36  liter  per  capita  consumption  rate  identified  in  project  preparation,  the \n2,500 liter tank would be emptied in 11 days, and the with-project combination of existing and new storage is assumed \nto be emptied by day 15, leaving 41 days per year without tank supplies. The tank is not always full when dry periods \nbegin and the probability of the tank being able to supply water is assumed to decline. \n\n4   Additional transportation costs are incurred. However, given that cost is not wholly attributable to water supplies and \n\ninvolves purchase of other goods, this is considered to be negligible. \n\n5   Diarrhea  and  waterborne  disease  are  reported  to  affect  9.5%  of  the  population.  Loss  of  workdays  due  to  the \n\nwaterborne diseases was reported in the socioeconomic surveys to be equal to 7%. \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n57 \n\nout  for  the  Naifaru6  sanitation  and  sewage  treatment  subcomponent,  where  the  following  options \nwere  examined:  (i)  settled  effluent  sewerage  system,  including  reed  beds  and  sea  outfall \nprincipally;  and  (ii)  a  conventional  sewerage  system,  including  a  sewer  network,  wastewater \ntreatment  package  plants  and  a  sea  outfall.  The  least-cost  analysis  demonstrated  that  the  first \noption was the best option. Based on engineering design criteria and the findings from the Naifaru \nstudy,  settled  sewerage  facilities  for  the  treatment  of  liquid  waste  for  Mahibadoo  and  Fonadhoo \nwere selected. \n \nCapital costs and incremental operation and maintenance (O&M) costs for each subproject \n9. \nhave  been  considered.  Cost-benefit  analysis  computations  for  the  settled  sewerage  systems  are \nbased  on  (i)  surveyed  willingness  to  pay;  and  (ii)  benefits  associated  with  the  provision  of \nalternative  sources  of  water  for  non-drinking  purposes,  such  as  irrigation,  livestock  drinking,  and \ntoilet flushing. Cost-benefit calculations appear weak when based exclusively on the willingness-to-\npay  survey  undertaken  during  the  survey.  This  reflects  (i)  the  absence  of  reported  charges  for \nsewerage  services  in  the  Maldives,7  and  thus,  the  absence  of  real  context  in  which  respondents \ncould frame their  answers  and; (ii) the  necessity to review  and  develop further  willingness-to-pay \nexpressions to account for the large proportion of the population that would be willing to pay more \nthat  Rf125,  given  that  when  solely  based  on  charges,  an  estimated  minimum  of  Rf300  (for \nMahibadoo) would be required to recover costs. \n \n\nTable A14.2: Sewerage Improvement: Willingness to Pay \n\n \n\nWillingness-to-Pay Rates \n(Rf per household per month) \nRf  >125 \nRf 65\u2013124 \nRf < 65 \n\nMahibadhoo \n(%) \n\nFonadhoo / Gan \n(%) \n\nCombined Systems \n(%) \n\n58.3 \n41.7 \n0.0 \n\n75.0 \n18.8 \n6.2 \n\n66.7 \n30.2 \n3.1 \n\nSource: Capacity Building for Regional Development Project, Phase II PPTA Survey. \n \nIslands  commonly  use  simple  irrigation8  in  home  gardens  with  multi-storey  cropping \n10. \nsystems, producing fruits and vegetables for household food security and for sale. When estimated \nbenefits gained from the reuse9 of treated water for irrigation of basic agriculture systems, such as \nhome  gardens  providing  essential  products  for  consumption  at  household  level,  hydroponics, \nlivestock  or  appropriate  household  needs  such  as  flushing  toilets,  are  used    in  the  cost-benefit \nanalysis  alongside  willingness-to-pay  values,  an  overall  EIRR  of  3.5%  is  obtained.    Improved \nsewerage and sanitation benefits include nonquantifiable benefits in terms of health, welfare, and \namenities,  requiring  sewerage  development  in  the  environmentally  fragile  context  of  small  coral \nislands with increasing populations. \n \n\n3. \n\nIntegrated Solid Waste Management  \n\n \n11. \n\nThe principal thrust of this subcomponent is to halt and reverse environmental degradation \n\n                                                 \n6   An  investment  proposal  was  initially  put  forward  for  this  island.  A  reduction  in  the  project  scope  and  resources  has \npostponed  investment  activities.  A  comparison  of  average  incremental  economic  costs  initially  computed  in  the \nfeasibility study showed settled sewerage values to be 85% of those for conventional sewerage.  \n\n7  In Male, sewerage tariffs are jointly charged with the water supply charges. This approach is not possible for the purely \n\nsewerage services proposed. \n\n8   Islands  commonly  use  simple  irrigation  in  home  gardens  with  multi-storey  cropping  systems,  producing  fruits  and \nvegetables  for  household  food  security  and  for  sale.  With  limited  land  and  water,  Government  is  promoting  higher \nvalue agriculture, including hydroponics. \n\n9   Market  information  or  WTP  data  regarding  benefits  from  water  reuse  could  not  be  obtained  for  the  Maldives  and \ntherefore  typical  information  from  existing  elsewhere  schemes  has  been  used.  This  includes  the  following \nassumptions: (i) losses to evaporation are less than 20%, (ii) estimated demand for treated water of at least 70%, (iii) \nMRf 0.01 per liter = value of treated water. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\ncaused  by  inadequate  solid  waste  management  practices  in  the  atolls.  Solid  waste  management \ncenters for Naifaru, Mohibadoo and Fonadhoo-Gan are envisaged under the Project, where most \nwaste  generated  in  the  islands  and  atolls  will  either  be  reprocessed  and  stored  for  local  use \n(composting of greens, recycling and reuse of inerts), or stored for transshipment. \n \n12. \nCost-benefit calculations were based on (i) the value of recycled materials and (ii) proposed \nuser  charges.  User  charge  values  were  obtained  from  Government  sources,  currently  in  the \nprocess  of  introducing  solid  waste  management  fees  of  Rf  50  per  household  per  month  in \ndevelopments  in  the  Northern  and  Southern  Regions,  indicating  an  overall  willingness  to  pay. \nAssuming that some unwillingness to pay, collection of charges were limited to 80%.  \n \n\nTable A14.3: EIRR and Sensitivity of Solid Waste Developments \n \n\nNaifaru \n\nMahibadhoo \n\nFonadhoo / Gan \n\n Item \n \nMain Parameters, 2005 \nHouseholds \nWaste Generated (tons) \nBase Case \nNPV @ 12 %        ($) \nEIRR \nCollection % @ Rf 50 \n\nCharge @ 80% collection \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n100% \n90% \nBase = 80% \n60% \n50% \n\nRf100 \nRf  60 \nRf  56 \nBase = Rf  50 \nRf  40 \nRf  31 \n\nPV of Cash Flows @ 12% \nValue of Recycled Waste \nHousehold Charges \nSite O&M Costs \nCapital Cost \nRevenue/Variable Cost \n\n  \n339 \n538 \n\nneg. \n\nneg. \nneg. \nneg. \nneg. \nneg. \n\n11.8% \nneg. \nneg. \nneg. \nneg. \nneg. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n683 \n1,162 \n\n62,821 \n29.4% \n\n40.0% \n34.8% \n29.4% \n18.2% \n12.0% \n\n70.9% \n37.9% \n34.6% \n29.4% \n20.6% \n11.7% \n\n115,635 \n130,472 \n(-145,633) \n(-100,025) \n169.0% \n\n(-83,389) \n\n(-27,959) \n8.2% \n\n(-39,593) \n9.0% \n\n \n921 \n1,107 \n\nCombined \nCenters \n  \n1,943 \n2,807 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n15.5% \n12.0% \n8.2% \n\n33.6% \n14.2% \n11.9% \n8.2% \n0.6% \n\nneg. \nneg. \n\nneg. \nneg. \n\n17.2% \n13.3% \n9.0% \n\n37.3% \n15.7% \n13.2% \n9.0% \n0.2% \n\n$ \n\n53,464 \n69,190 \n(-157,213) \n(-92,543) \n78.0% \n\nneg. \n\nneg. \n\n96,154 \n175,898 \n(-168,883) \n(-242,141) \n161.1% \n\n265,253 \n375,561 \n(-471,729) \n(-434,709) \n135.8% \n\n \n\nO&M  = operation and maintenance, PV = present value, Rf = Maldivian rufiyaa.    \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nNotes:  Capital  cost  includes  replacement  of  all  mechanical  and  electrical  equipment  after  ten  years.  Figures  in  bold \nindicate switching values\u2014the value at which the EIRR equals the opportunity cost of capital (12%). \n \nThe estimated average EIRR for this component is 9%. EIRRs are sensitive to changes in \n13. \ncharges  and  collection,  in  the  analyses  above  the  sensitivity  indexes  for  changes  in  rates  and \nchanges in the collection percentage are each around 3. The analysis for Naifaru suggests that this \nlevel  of  charge  and  collection  may  not  be  necessary  for  viable  operation  as  the  Naifaru  center, \nproducing and EIRR of 29% at these rates, which well beyond the needs of cost recovery. Neither \nof the other two sites, as proposed, is comparable. Fonadhoo\u2212Gan development includes transfer \nstations  serving  some  920  households  on  two  islands  but  can  be  extended  to  serve  more  of  the \n2,200  households  on  Laamu  Atoll.  Similarly,  the  present  designs  for  the  other  centers  are  not \nintended to  be final as the center's are  ultimately intended to serve the  atolls rather than  a small \nnumber  of  islands.    This  will  be  addressed  and  finalized  in  the  development  of  atoll  level  solid \nwaste  management  strategies  under  the  project.  Under  such  circumstances,  the  Mahibadhoo \nwaste management center would appear to be economically viable (EIRR = 12%) by doubling the \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n59 \n\nnumber of households served in the Alif Dhaal Atoll.  \n \n\n4. \n\nOverall Environmental Infrastructure Component \n\n \nThe  environmental  infrastructure  component  includes  subcomponents  with  differing \n14. \ndegrees of economic viability and an overall EIRR for the component of 18.7%. Two of the three \nsubcomponents are below the 12% opportunity cost of capital, but further development of the solid \nwaste subcomponent, facilitated by the Project, is likely to raise that activity above 12%.10 Neither \nthe planning and environmental management component nor the management and implementation \ncapacity-building  component  have  directly  quantifiable  benefits.  Their  benefits  are  in  the  form  of \nthe  increased  effectiveness  of  planning  and  implementation  of  Government  programs,  as  well  as \nincreased institutional capacity. The rainwater tanks subcomponent is the most viable and the least \nsensitive to adverse changes. The solid waste subcomponent is sensitive, with an sensitivity index \nof 6, but this indicates the potential for further development of the Mahibadhoo and Fonadhoo\u2212Gan \ncenters, as envisaged in the context of development of atoll strategies, to make these activities as \ncomparably viable as Naifaru's solid waste program. \n \n\nTable A14.4: Summary of EIRR and Sensitivity Indexes \n \n\n Item \n\n  \nWater Supply \nSolid Waste Management \nSanitation and Sewerage \nEnvironmental Infrastructure \n\nBase Case \n\nCosts + 10% \n\nBenefits - 10% \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n\nSI \n \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n\nSI \n \n\n35.0 \n9.0 \n3.5 \n18.7 \n\n31.3 \n3.6 \n2.0 \n16.4 \n\n1.1 \n6.0 \n1.9 \n1.6 \n \n\n31.0 \n3.0 \n1.1 \n16.0 \n\n1.2 \n6.7 \n2.1 \n1.8 \n\nCombined \nChanges \nEIRR \n(%) \n\n27.6 \n-3.9 \n0.6 \n13.8 \n\n \n\n \n\nFinancial Sustainability  \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, SI = sensitivity index.   \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD.  \n \n15. \nThough  full  cost  recovery  has  not  been  set  as  a  specific  target,  it  is  intended  that  O&M \ncosts be funded by users either through user charges or through communal O&M of facilities. The \nsurveyed willingness to pay for the sewage treatment subcomponent indicates that charges could \nraise  amounts  of  $35,000  to  $40,000  per  year  to  cover  the  estimated  annual  community  based \nO&M costs of $30,000 at Mahibadhoo and $40,000 at Fonadhoo. The rainwater tanks will be the \nresponsibility  of  each  individual  borrower  from  the  revolving  fund  and  it  is  expected  that  the  high \nvalue  of  the  water  storage  will  ensure  that  the  tanks  are  well  maintained.  Training  will  also  be \nprovided under the Project. The present values in Table A14.3 indicate that the projected revenues \nfor solid waste management at Naifaru and Fonadhoo\u2212Gan will exceed the O&M costs\u2014including \nreplacement  of  all  equipment  after  10  years\u2014by  over  60%.  The  atoll  strategies  to  be  developed \nunder  the  Project  will  ensure  that,  as  well  as  engineering  and  environmental  concerns,  financial \nissues are addressed. The three project activities requiring on-going O&M appear to be financially \nsustainable  without  project  or  Government  funding.  Detailed  methodology  for  tariff  structure  and \ntariff collection and administration will be developed under the Project for the sanitation and solid \nwaste management components. \n \n16. \nProposed  monthly  charges  to  households  of  Rf50  for  solid  waste  management  charges \nrepresent approximately 1% income for both Mahibadoo and Fonadhoo\u2212Gan, as are the proposed \n\n                                                 \n10 This likelihood is supported by the existence of more households to serve; capacity of centers to process their waste; \nresulting  increase  in  income  from  recycling  and  potential  income  from  charges;  and  high  sensitivity  of  the  EIRR  to \nchanges in benefits and income. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nrepayment  cost  of  the  rainwater  tanks,  also  estimated  at  Rf50.  However,  similar  expenditure  for \nNaifaru,  where  incomes  are  lower  than  average,  represents  a  larger  expenditure  percentage. \nBased  on  Rf 125  user charge for sanitation  and sewage treatment in  Mahibadoo  and  Fonadhoo, \naverage  expenditures  of  approximately  2.5%  have  been  computed.  The  affordability  analysis \nindicates that the charge levels are affordable to domestic users in the latter islands, based on the \ngenerally accepted principles that the sum of the charges for water, sanitation, and sewerage and \nsolid waste services should not exceed 6%. It is recommended that proposed charges of Rf125 for \nsewage treatment be reviewed under the Project. \n \n\nTable A14.5: Affordability Analysis \n\n \n\nItem \nAverage household monthly income (Rf) \nAverage Expenditure: Water Supply (%) \nAverage Expenditure: Solid Waste Management(%) \nAverage Expenditure: Sanitation & Sewage Treatment (%) \n         \n\nMahibadhoo \n4,620 \n\n1.1 \n1.1 \n2.7 \n\nFonadhoo  \n5,040 \n1 \n1 \n2.5 \n\nNaifaru \n2,310 \n\n2.2 \n2.2 \n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 = not available. \nSource: Capacity Building for Regional Development Project, Phase II PPTA Survey. \n\n \n\nUnquantified Benefits \n\nE. \n \n17. \nEnvironment  and  Water  Resources.  Rainwater  tank  storage  will  provide  additional  safe \ndrinking  water  and  protect  the  water  lens  by  reducing  water  extraction  and  sources  for \nreplenishment. Sanitation, sewage treatment, and integrated solid waste management will prevent \ndegradation of groundwater resources and the marine environment. \n \nHealth.  The  health  benefits  of  the  Project,  arising  from  a  reduction  in  costs11,  will  be \n18. \nsignificant. In addition to waterborne diseases, considered in the benefit analysis, integrated solid \nwaste management will reduce burning of waste, and pest incidence, leading to reduced incidence \nof respiratory and insect and rodent-related diseases.  \n \n19. \nInstitutional  Development,  Organizational  Benefits.  The  implementation  of  the  Project \nwill help improve the capacity of central and regional agencies, and provide a solid foundation for \nmobilization and organization of communities to undertake O&M functions.  \n \n20. \nEmployment.  The  direct  increase  in  jobs  through  the  creation  of  cooperatives  has  been \nmentioned.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  provide  environmental  improvements  and  enhanced \ncapacity for environmental management, necessary for preserving the marine environment of the \nMaldives. It is expected that such improvements will lead to employment through increased tourism \ndevelopment and sustain and promote fishing activities for income and food security.  \n \n21. \nGender. There are almost twice as many men as women in the Maldivian work force. The \nProject endeavors to enhance women\u2019s involvement, train  women and increase their contribution \nin income generating activities. The Project will provide opportunities for women to take a leading \nrole  in  O&M  of  utilities  and  increased  agricultural  production  resulting  from  increased  water \navailability. \n\n                                                 \n11  In 2001, health expenditure was estimated at $263 per capita, or 6.7% of (GDP). \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 14 April 2005)  \n", "Currency Unit\n", "rufiyaa (Rf) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "Rf1.00\n$1.00\n", "$0.077 \nRf12.96 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \natoll development plan  \neconomic internal rate of return \ngross domestic product \nIslamic Development Bank  \nisland development committee \nisland development plan  \ninitial environmental examination \ninternational shopping \nMinistry of Environment and Construction  \nMaldives Housing and Urban Development Board \nMinistry of Atolls Development \nMinistry of Fisheries, Agriculture and Marine Resources \nMinistry of Finance and Treasury \nMinistry of Health \nnational project steering committee \nMaldives Water and Sanitation Authority \noperation and maintenance \nParticipatory Hygiene and Sanitation Transformation \nproject implementation unit \nproject management unit \nproject performance management system \nregional project advisory committee \nTsunami Emergency Assistance Project \nUnited Nations Development Programme \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund \nwomen\u2019s development committee \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ADB \nADP \nEIRR \nGDP \nIsDB \nIDC \nIDP \nIEE \nIS \nMEC \nMHUDB \nMOAD \nMOFAMR \nMOFT \nMOH \nNPSC \nMWSA \nO&M \nPHAST \nPIU \nPMU \nPPMS \nRPAC \nTEAP \nUNDP \nUNICEF \nWDC \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \nCentral Regions  \n", " \n \nCommunity \nmanagement  \n", " \n \nCooperative  \n", " \n", " \n", "\u2014 \n", " \n\u2014 \n", " \n\u2014 \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "GLOSSARY \n", "Group  of  13  atolls,  part  of  the  Maldives,  between  1o  and  6 \noN,  72-74  oE.
