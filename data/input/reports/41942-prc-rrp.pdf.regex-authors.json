The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.    \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  ADB\u2019s Water and Wastewater Operations \n1.  Water Financing Program \n2.  Consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy,1 the principal objectives of ADB assistance in the \nwater and wastewater sectors are to (i) provide safe drinking water and sanitation facilities to \nimprove the health and productivity of large urban populations, (ii) address environmental issues \nin  the  water  sector,  (iii)  improve  financial  management  to  generate  internal  resources  for \ninvestment and ensure sustainable operations and maintenance, and (iv) enhance institutional \ncapacity to operate and maintain urban systems effectively. \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s Water for All policy was reviewed in 2006 by an independent review panel which \nmade five  main recommendations for ADB to improve implementation of the policy.2 The \nrecommendations, which were accepted by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, are as follows. \n \n(i)  Increase  commitments  and  develop  capacity.  ADB  should  double  its  water \ninvestments, together with capacity development and a major public-awareness \ncampaign. \n(ii)  Develop  long-term  partnerships  with  clients  and  stakeholders  in  developing \nmember countries (DMCs) and among donors. ADB should focus on building \nbroad-based support for the water policy\u2019s principles through regional and in-\ncountry  programs,  which  should  have  a  long-term  focus  rather  than  being \nproject-centered.  \n(iii)  Focus the implementation of integrated water resources management (IWRM) on \nstakeholder needs and ownership. ADB should provide continued support to \npromoting IWRM through training, planning, and implementation.  \n(iv)  Promote \"business unusual\" through innovations to increase access, affordability, \nefficiency,  and  cost  effectiveness.  ADB  should  implement  the  new  financial \ninstruments of its Innovation and Efficiency Initiative3, and clarify its policy on \nsubsidies. ADB should also work harder at expediting service delivery to the poor \nto  help  countries  meet  the  Millennium  Development  Goal  (MDG)  targets. \nAlternative  investment  modalities  with  shorter  gestation  periods  should  be \nexplored.  \n(v)  Improve ADB processes to ensure effective policy implementation. ADB should \nstreamline  its  internal  processes  to  integrate  the  water  policy  into  project \noperations in DMCs. \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001. Water for All. Manila. \n2   ADB. 2006. Comprehensive Review of ADB\u2019s Water Policy Implementation, Final Report and Recommendation.  \n    Manila. Available: http://www.adb.org/Water/Policy/panel-report.asp \n3   ADB. 2005. Innovation Efficiency Initiative. Manila. ", "2   \n4.  In March 2006, in response to the panel\u2019s recommendations and the Asia and Pacific \nregion\u2019s  burgeoning  need  for  water  investment,  reform,  and  capacity  development,  ADB \nmanagement announced the Water Financing Program (WFP) 2006\u201320104 that seeks to deliver \nwater investments of $12 billion through ADB\u2019s own resources over the period 2006\u20132010 \n(Appendix 2). On an annual basis, the WFP seeks to double investments from $1.2 billion in \n1999 (before adoption of the water policy) to over $2 billion. Water lending was projected to \nreach 25% of overall ADB lending on a 3-year moving average. In December 2006, ADB\u2019s \nBoard of Directors approved the establishment of the Water Financing Partnership Facility to \nsupport WFP implementation. Water investments were also prioritized in ADB\u2019s Medium-Term \nStrategy II, 2006-2008. 5\n \n5.  The WFP has three main areas of investment: rural, urban, and basin water. \n \n(i)  Rural water services. Rural water supply and sanitation, irrigation, and drainage \nservices to improve health and livelihoods.  \n(ii)  Urban  water  services.  Urban  water  supply,  sanitation  and  wastewater \nmanagement,  and  environmental  improvement  services  to  sustain  economic \ndevelopment.  \n(iii)  Basin  water  management.  Infrastructure  and  management  for  (a) \nmultifunctional water regulation and hydropower facilities developed in a river \nbasin context; (b) flood management; (c) the conservation and improvement of \nwatersheds, wetlands, and ecosystems; and (d) improved water governance. \n \n6.  The WFP also aims to offer a single-window approach for processing investments that \nhave  both  public  and  private  financing,  especially  in  urban  water  services.  Using  its  new \nfinancing modalities developed by the Innovation and Efficiency Initiative, a diverse range of \nfinancing and knowledge products will be made available for rural, urban, and basin water \ninvestments. \n \n2.  Country Strategy and Private Sector Operations in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina \n7.  The ADB country strategy for the PRC6 is based on five development objectives: (i) \npromoting equitable and inclusive growth, (ii) making markets work better, (iii) improving the \nenvironment,  (iv)  promoting  regional  cooperation,  and  (v)  private  sector  development  and \noperations. This is consistent with priorities highlighted in the ADB Medium-Term Strategy II \n(2006\u20132008), including (i) catalyzing investment to improve the investment climate and expand \nprivate  sector  operations,  (ii)  strengthening  inclusiveness  through  increasing  investment  to \nsupport rural development and social development interventions, and (iii) promoting regional \ncooperation  and  integration.  In  the  PRC,  ADB  is  enhancing  its  focus  on  rebalancing \ndevelopment between rural and urban areas, and between coastal and inland regions. There is \nmore emphasis on infrastructure projects in rural areas and the less-developed central and \nwestern regions. The Government and ADB are also working together to promote improvements \nto the urban environment. \n \n8.  The PRC has been steadily transforming to a market economy, which has become the \nbasis and driving force for economic growth and job creation. In addition to policy advice to the \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2006. Water Financing Program 2006-2010. Manila.

", "      3\nGovernment  on  private  sector  development,  ADB  also  provides  project-based  financial \nassistance. ADB\u2019s private sector operations in the PRC have focused on the infrastructure and \nenergy sectors, the financial sector, and environmental improvements. In the infrastructure and \nenergy sectors, ADB prioritizes pioneering projects with innovative contractual and financial \nstructuring to (i) encourage private sector participation, (ii) enhance management expertise, and \n(iii) improve corporate governance. The proposed project goes towards meeting these criteria of \nbeing a pioneering project that has not been previously tried by ADB and that will accelerate \nprivate sector participation in the water and sanitation sector in the PRC. \n \n9.  ADB has played a particularly significant role in promoting private sector involvement in \nthe PRC\u2019s water sector. In 1996, ADB technical assistance promoted private sector involvement \non a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis for water supply projects.7 This was followed by further \ntechnical assistance to help the Government prepare a pilot BOT project8 which resulted in the \nsuccessful preparation and implementation of the Chengdu Water Supply Project,9 which is now \nin commercial operation. \n \n3.  Experience and Strategy in Water and Wastewater Sectors in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China \n10.  The PRC is one of the main target countries of the WFP. The other target countries are \nIndia, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Viet Nam, which together with the PRC account for about 80% \nof  the  current  water  investments.  ADB  works  with  the  PRC  government  to  improve  living \nstandards  and  economic  productivity,  reduce  environmental  degradation,  and  promote \nsustainable development. ADB is financing urban wastewater, sewage treatment, water supply, \nand water resource management projects in line with its strategy to support environmental \nimprovement in the PRC. To maximize the development impact, especially among the urban \npoor, ADB's involvement has been targeted at densely populated urban areas. Since 1992, \nADB  has  provided  more  than  20  loans  totaling  $2.5  billion  to  the  PRC  for  municipal \ninfrastructure and environmental improvement projects. ADB also has provided nearly $45 \nmillion for more than 70 technical assistance studies to prepare these projects and to review \nand  study  key  issues  in  municipal  transport,  water  resources,  water  supply,  wastewater \ntreatment, and pollution control. It is anticipated that ADB's public sector operations in the PRC \nwill support six or seven urban wastewater management projects in 2006\u20132008. \n \nB.  Water and Wastewater Sectors in the People\u2019s Republic of China  \n11.  Reducing the pollution of rivers and lakes and improving the supply of clean drinking \nwater  is  part  of  any  pro-poor  development  strategy.  Poor  people  are  most  vulnerable  to \nenvironment-induced diseases and are least capable of paying for adequate medical attention \nfor digestive tract ailments associated with drinking polluted water. The pollution of rivers and \nlakes  reduces  already  scarce  drinking  water  sources.  Bottled  water  is  a  very  expensive \nalternative to potable tap water. The financial burden of buying bottled water falls most heavily \non the poor and can account for a disproportionately high portion of their limited income. Much \nremains to be done to reduce the adverse impact of water pollution on the poor and to end \nshortages of clean drinking water. \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1995.

In the PRC, only about 40% of urban wastewater is treated and the rest is discharged \nuntreated into rivers, lakes, and seas. More than 40% of the water in the seven major river \nbasins  does  not  meet  the  grade  III10  national  quality  standard.  Major  lakes  have  serious \neutrophication problems. \n \n13.  The pollution of rivers and lakes puts further pressure on already scarce water sources. \nWater resources and availability in the PRC vary significantly across regions and during the \nyear, and water scarcity is one of the biggest challenges facing the country. There are serious \nwater shortages in northern PRC. Per capita water availability ranges from 360 cubic meters \n(m3) to 750 m3, both of which are lower than the international definition of water scarcity of 1,000 \nm3 per person. Although more than 90% of urban households in large cities have access to \npiped water, this figure obscures shortages in many cities, particularly those in the water-scarce \nnorthern provinces. \n \n14.  Increased urbanization has placed pressure on water supply and wastewater treatment \nand has had a negative impact on water quality. The urban population in the PRC was about \n577 million in 2006 and is forecast to exceed 800 million in 2015. Inadequate facilities for \ntreating municipal wastewater have led to pollution of already scarce water sources. In 2006 the \ntotal drinking water coverage in the PRC was 83%, and sanitation coverage was 56%. More \ninvestment is needed to supply clean drinking water and to treat wastewater. The Government \nhas set an ambitious development target of extending water supply coverage to 95%, and \nwastewater treatment coverage to 70%, by 2010. 11  \n \nC.  Constraints and Opportunities for Project Preparation in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina \n15.  A key element for success in accelerating the achievement of MDG target 10 is the \ndevelopment of bankable projects at the local level, which are able to (i) leverage government \nfunds, and (ii) raise the balance of the investment capital required from other sources, including \ncommercial and development banks, and the private sector. However, the traditional project \ndevelopment  activities  of  the  government,  including  through  the  project  preparatory  and \nadvisory  technical  assistance  activities  supported  by  multilateral  and  bilateral  development \npartners, have not been efficient in terms of speed, flexibility, and project structuring to attract \nprivate sector investments. In addition, there are constraints in local government capacity, \ninclination, and mindset to independently develop such projects and efficiently implement them \nwith  a  proper  understanding  of  debt  structuring.  Consequently,  there  are  many  good \nopportunities that cannot be taken up due to insufficient or unsatisfactory project preparation. In \nfact, investors with strong interest in the sector cannot actually identify suitable projects in a \ntimely  manner  because  the  preliminary  project  information  is  insufficient,  or  its  quality  is \nunsatisfactory. These problems could threaten the momentum of the governments\u2019 initiative. \nATRIUM PDFCO responds to these issues with an innovative project development model, in \nwhich the needs of the Government, as well as the expectations of the private sector, are \naddressed in an appropriate manner through a private sector company structured as a program \ndevelopment facility. \n \n                                                 \n10  Grade III represents the minimum standard of suitable water for treated potable water supply. \n11  Ministry of Construction Report presented at the 6th Minister\u2019s Forum on Infrastructure Development for the Asia \nPacific Region held in Beijing, 28\u201329 August 2007. ", "      5\n16.  There is tremendous potential for urban infrastructure finance, fuelled by the PRC\u2019s \nstrong and sustained economic growth as well as increasing urbanization. ATRIUM PDFCO will \nlink infrastructure financiers to urban water supply, wastewater, and sanitation projects, and \naccelerate the economic development of the PRC. The company will contribute skills, resources, \nand experience to achieve high quality in the preparation of projects. ATRIUM PDFCO projects \nwill be able to expand and diversify the investor base for local governments and municipalities, \nand lower their cost of capital, by meeting international standards of project preparation and \nstructuring through the public tendering of projects.  \n \n17.  The  responsibility  for  developing  water  infrastructure  falls  on  local  municipalities. \nHowever, funding for water infrastructure in municipalities is limited, mainly because (i) they are \nconstrained by their limited financial budgets and overall infrastructure needs, (ii) they do not \nhave  direct  access  to  multilateral  or  other  external  financing  sources,  and  (iii)  some \nmunicipalities may not be able to meet the Government\u2019s counterpart funding requirements.  \n \n18.  Private sector funding can help to overcome some of these limitations for both the water \nsupply and wastewater treatment sectors. Private sector participation can also lead to more use \nof new technology and enhanced efficiency. The PRC\u2019s private sector now accounts for more \nthan 40% of gross domestic product (GDP), 60% of growth, and 75% of the new jobs being \ngenerated. Thus, the continued expansion of the private sector is also vital to the PRC\u2019s \nprospects of alleviating the poverty of its remaining poor people.12   \n \nD.  Government Policies and Plans \n19.  The  PRC  government  accords  priority  in  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  to \nresolving water pollution and the scarcity of water, especially in urban areas, as the PRC \ngovernment plans to develop small- and medium-sized cities to absorb surplus rural labor. \nParticular attention will be paid to investments in wastewater treatment plants and recycled \nwater facilities, with an estimated investment of $44 billion during the 5-year period.13 The PRC \ngovernment\u2019s  strategy  in  the  water  sector  focuses  on  (i)  strengthening  water  resource \nmanagement  and  developing  water  sources;  (ii) controlling  overextraction  of  groundwater \nresources; (iii) strengthening water pollution prevention and treatment, including construction of \nurban  water,  wastewater  treatment,  and  recycled  water  facilities;  (iv)  encouraging  water \nsavings; and (v) introducing appropriate pricing for water supply and wastewater treatment to \nmore  economic  levels.  To  complement  increased  investments  in  urban  water  supply  and \nwastewater treatment facilities, the PRC government will continue to encourage and support \nraising  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  to  commercial  levels,  which  will  improve  financial \nmanagement for water and wastewater projects, and encourage private sector participation. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Description   \n20.  The purpose of the investment is to facilitate the development of commercially viable \nprojects through PPPs in the water and sanitation sector in the PRC. The ATRIUM PDFCO will \nbe incorporated in Singapore with an initial share capital of $10 million. \n \n                                                 \n12   ADB. 2007. PRC Country Assistance Program Evaluation. Manila. \n13  SDRC, MOC, and SEPA. 2007. 11th Five-Year Plan for Urban Wastewater Treatment and Recycled Water \nFacilities Development.   \n ", "6   \n21.  ATRIUM  PDFCO  will  be  an  advisory  services  company  providing  the  necessary \nresources and expertise to identify and develop projects from the concept stage until they are \nsuccessfully tendered out as PPP projects. The services it will provide include feasibility studies, \nplanning, design, financial structuring, and other tender preparation activities that will result in \nsuccessful competitive tendering and the appointment of a successful bidder. The up-front effort \nof ATRIUM PDFCO will ensure that the projects are sustainable and commercially viable while \nfacilitating a high-quality and cost-effective solution.  ATRIUM PDFCO will be paid a fee for its \nservices.  \n \nB.  Project Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Development and Operations  \n22.  Based on local government requests and market demand, ATRIUM PDFCO will assist \nvarious local governments or municipalities to plan, design, structure, and tender PPP water \nand wastewater infrastructure projects. For each project, ATRIUM PDFCO will enter into a \nproject development agreement with the respective local government or municipality, which will \ndefine issues such as exclusivity, working scope, and payment terms.  \n \n23.  ATRIUM PDFCO envisages to assist in demonstrating local governments can attract \nprivate investments in the water and wastewater sector. It will be run as a profit-driven company \nin order to maintain its longer-term financial viability. ATRIUM PDFCO will be paid a fee by the \nsuccessful  bidder  in  a  tender  of  any  targeted  project.  The  success  fee  will  provide  for  a \ncomplete recovery of ATRIUM PDFCO\u2019s costs associated with such tender, plus a suitable \nmargin for profit. No up-front payment will be made by the local government or municipality. It is \nanticipated that the local governments or municipalities will find ATRIUM  PDFCO to be  a \nconvenient and efficient entity with which to develop financially viable water and wastewater \ninfrastructure projects. \n \n24.  Under arrangements that will be made prior to the engagement of ATRIUM PDFCO by \nany municipality or other client, ADB will be permitted to provide funding for the projects. Such \nfunding opportunities, if they materialize, will be subject to separate approval by the Board.  In \nthe same way, each of the Singaporean shareholders will be permitted to participate in the \ntender  for  the  projects  but  will  not  be  given  any  priority.    ATRIUM  PDFCO\u2019s  constitutive \ndocuments will preclude it from bidding  for, or financing, any of the ensuing projects.   \n \n25.  ADB will also carefully protect its reputation risk by requiring as a condition for taking its \nshareholding in the company that it institutes appropriate operational procedures to address \nconflict  of  interest  of  the  Singapore  shareholders  of  ATRIUM  PDFCO  during  the  project \nscreening and development stages.  Detailed conflict of interest procedures will be developed \nfor the company.14 ADB will ensure that ATRIUM PDFCO will follow systems and procedures, \nbroadly  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and Guidelines  for  Selection  of \nConsultants, that will ensure objectivity and impartiality in the screening of projects and that the \nbidding process is carried out by the municipalities in a transparent manner. ADB will use its \nchairmanship  of  the  audit  committee  to  ensure  that  any  potential  conflicts  of  interest  are \nappropriately managed, monitored and reported to the board, and that any material related-\nparty transaction will be subject to approval by ATRIUM PDFCO\u2019s board.  \n \n                                                 \n14 These will be wide-ranging and will, amongst other things, ensure that ATRIUM PDFCO will not, for example on \nbehalf of the relevant authority, evaluate any tender in which any of the Singaporean shareholders is a bidder. ", "      7\n2.  Selection Criteria and Due Diligence \n26.  The project selection criteria to be used by ATRIUM PDFCO are expected to include an \nassessment of the necessity and urgency of the project, the strength of municipal government \nsupport, and tariff affordability. Qualification criteria will be drawn up to guide project selection. \nATRIUM  PDFCO  will  thoroughly  evaluate  each  project,  focusing  on  financial  viability.  A \nsignificant portion of the evaluation work, which will include technical, legal, and financial due-\ndiligence before a proposal is submitted to the board of ATRIUM PDFCO for approval, will be \noutsourced to external consultants. During project preparation for tendering, projects will be \nreviewed periodically.  \n \nC.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n1.  Environmental and Social Aspects \n27.  The  investment  is  classified  as  environmental  category  C,  involuntary  resettlement \ncategory C and indigenous people category C. ATRIUM PDFCO will be only provide advisory \nservices, and its activities will have no environmental or social impact.  \n \n2.  Development Impacts \n28.  One of the key development impacts will be to expedite the delivery of urban water \nsupply,  sanitation,  and  wastewater  services  in  the  PRC,  and  thereby  accelerate  the \nachievement of MDG target 10 in the PRC. Over one third of the country\u2019s river systems are \nestimated to be polluted and more than 90% of the catchment areas around the cities are badly \ncontaminated. About 50% of water resources do not conform to PRC drinking water standards. \nInvestments in wastewater treatment will improve the environment and help arrest pollution of \nwater sources, facilitating delivery of water that meets national standards and reducing threats \nto public health. Poor people tend to suffer the most economically from increased medical costs \nor loss of income as a result of waterborne diseases. Investments in wastewater will reduce \nthese costs and contribute to improving the living conditions of the poor. \n \n29.  The Project will enhance capacity and ownership of local governments by supporting \nproject preparation, and targeting transparency, fairness, and high standards of ethics in project \ntendering. Access to water has been a major problem in some municipalities, particularly in \nnorthern PRC. An increase in the water supply will also enable increased industrial output. \nAccess to piped water supply increases productivity by eliminating time spent in fetching and \nqueuing for water, and this time can then be spent on other productive activities. For the urban \npoor, access to safe drinking water reduces the risk of waterborne diseases, thereby improving \nhealth and productivity.  \n \n30.  The project will promote private sector participation in urban water supply, sanitation, \nand wastewater management in the PRC, and thereby increase the amount of private capital \ninvested in the urban water sector, which is crucial for the sustainable and efficient delivery of \nbasic services as the resources available with government, especially at the local level are \nlimited \n \n3.  Development Effectiveness \na.  Project Performance \n \n ", "8   \n31.  ATRIUM  PDFCO\u2019s  operations  and  performance  will  be  assessed  against  specific \noperational and financial objectives. Effectiveness will be measured by (i) how successfully the \nProject attracts private sector capital, (ii) how it facilitates the development of municipal water \nand wastewater facility concessions, (iii) whether it helps in developing and expanding municipal \nwater and wastewater infrastructure facilities, (iv) how much water is supplied and wastewater is \ntreated by its facilitated investments, and (v) whether it improves the quality of urban life and \npublic health. ATRIUM PDFCO will also be judged by its financial profitability, sustainability, and \ntimely returns to investors. \n \nb.   Economic Sustainability \n \n32.  From an economic sustainability point of view, the ATRIUM PDFCO will be assessed on \nits ability to cost effectively (i) develop water infrastructure facilities; (ii) supply water to, and \ntreat  wastewater  from,  consumers;  and  (iii)  contribute  to  environmental  improvements  and \neconomic growth. Additional employment created as a result of implementation of facilitated \ninvestments will also be taken into account.  \n \n  c.   Private Sector Development \n \n33.  ATRIUM PDFCO will be assessed on how it contributes to capacity development in the \nlocal  and  municipal  governments  to  manage  private  sector  participation  in  the  water  and \nwastewater sectors. The focus will be on its commercial and financial viability, and also on its \ncatalytic effect on future private investments in the water and wastewater sectors, and on the \nbroader economy.  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Proposed Equity Investment \n34.  The proposed ADB investment will be up to $4.0 million equivalent, to be disbursed in \nstages, for a stake of up to 40% of the equity capital of ATRIUM PDFCO. Capital will be \ncontributed pro rata by the shareholders over a period of 5 years, based on the cash flow \nrequirements of ATRIUM PDFCO. ADB\u2019s shareholding in ATRIUM PDFCO will not exceed 40% \nat any time. \n \nB.  Justification \n35.  ADB\u2019s  investment  in  ATRIUM  PDFCO  is  justified  on  the  basis  of  its  development \nimpacts and significant demonstration effects. It is consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy,15 and the \nWFP 2006-2010, and supports ADB\u2019s operational strategies, as well as the need to boost \nprivate sector involvement in urban water supply, sanitation, and wastewater management in \nDMCs. These are more specifically discussed below. \n \n(i)  The project aims to contribute towards meeting MDG target 10 on water and \nsanitation in the PRC. The vast majority of the people in the world without safe \ndrinking water and proper sanitation, 700 million (two thirds) of those without safe \ndrinking water, and 2 billion (three quarters) of those without improved sanitation, \nlive in the Asia and Pacific region. In the PRC, 268 million people need to be \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2001. Water for All. Manila. ", "      9\nprovided  access  to  safe  drinking  water,  and  another  372  million  need  the \nprovision of sanitation, in order to reach MDG target 10 by 2015.  \n(ii)  In response to the huge unmet water needs of the Asia and Pacific region, and \nconsistent  with  the  recommendations  of  various  international  initiatives16  to \ndouble water investments, ADB has made water a core business area under its \nMedium-Term Strategy II.17 ADB envisages doubling its water investments to \nover $2 billion annually.18 This will represent a significant contribution towards \nthe achievement of the MDGs in the Asia and Pacific region.19   \n(iii)  The investment is consistent with ADB's WFP 2006\u20132010 which comprises a \nstrong  portfolio  of  loan  and  technical  assistance  projects.  It  focuses  on  the \ndelivery of substantial investment, reform, and capacity development in three key \nareas:  urban  water  services,  rural  water  services,  and  water  resources \nmanagement in river basins. \n(iv)  The project aims to boost private sector financing. Despite much international \nattention in past years to the importance of private sector financing, few public \nwater utilities in the PRC have easy access to private capital. Of all global private \nfunding for infrastructure, only 5% went to water supply and sanitation services, \nand since 2001, global private annual investment commitments have ranged \nbetween $1 billion and $2 billion a year, which is well below the peak level of the \nlate 1990s.   \n(v)  The investment in ATRIUM PDFCO is in line with ADB\u2019s vision of ADB as a \nknowledge-based  institution.  In  the  major  DMCs,  and  the  PRC  in  particular, \nfinancial resource is no longer the bottleneck for the development of water sector. \nThe major gaps between the demand for water infrastructure by municipalities \nand the supply of infrastructure investment and lending are due to insufficient or \nunsatisfactory  project  evaluation,  due  diligence,  tender  preparation,  risk \nallocation,  and  financial  structuring.  The  expertise  to  prepare  and  structure \ndifferent types of projects is in high demand in these markets. The incorporation \nof ATRIUM PDFCO, with successful experience from both ADB and Singapore, \nwill meet this demand in a commercially sustainable manner. The experience \nthrough ATRIUM PDFCO will also enrich ADB\u2019s own knowledge on private sector \noperations the water and wastewater sector in PRC. \n(vi)  The Project reflects the infrastructure focus of ADB\u2019s private sector operations in \nthe region. In the infrastructure sector, ADB prioritizes pioneering projects with \nbankable  contractual  and  financial  structuring  to  encourage  private  sector \nparticipation,  enhance  management  expertise,  and  improve  corporate \ngovernance. The service to be provided by ATRIUM PDFCO may foster a large \nnumber  of  urban  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  wastewater  projects  to  be \ndeveloped by the private sector, and ADB will therefore play a significant catalytic \nrole by investing in ATRIUM PDFCO. \n                                                 \n16 The World Panel for Financing Water Infrastructure in 2003 and the Gurria Task Force on Water Financing in 2006. \nThe Gurria Task Force was chaired by Angel Gurria and followed up on the recommendations of the World Panel \non Financing Water Infrastructure chaired by Michel Camdessus. It reported its findings to the 4th World Water \nForum in March 2006 in Mexico City. ADB was a member of the panel and the task force. \n17 ADB. 2006. Medium-Term Strategy II 2006\u20132008. Manila. \n18 To meet MDG target 10 on water and sanitation in the Asia and Pacific region, the Asia Water Watch 2015 study \nby ADB, World Health Organization, United Nations Development Program, and United Nations Economic and \nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific estimated that minimum annual investments of $8 billion are needed. \n19 MDG target 10 is to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and \nimproved sanitation. Investments in water are also crucial in meeting other MDG targets, such as those relating to \n(i) the incidence of poverty, (ii) the proportion of the poor who suffer from hunger, (iii) reducing child and maternal \nmortality, (iv) the incidence of major diseases, and (v) environmental sustainability. \n ", "10   \n(vii)  ATRIUM  PDFCO  will  itself  be  a  demonstration  project  on  the  merits  of \ninfrastructure PPPs in Asia. Currently, although many local governments in the \nregion are eager for private capital to be mobilized to provide essential services, \nthey  have  not  been  very  successful  in  attracting  private  investors.  This  has \nresulted  in  the  nondelivery  of  services  such  as  water  and  sanitation  to  the \npoorest people. ATRIUM PDFCO can demonstrate that local governments can \nattract private investors with minimum financial commitment from the national \ngovernments to deliver better basic services to their people, particularly the poor. \n \nC.  Anticorruption and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n36.  The  Singaporean  investors  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) and policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing \nof Terrorism (2003). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB will require the Singaporean investors to institute, maintain, and comply with \ninternal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for the purpose \nof  preventing  corruption  or  money  laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and \ncovenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The investment documentation \nbetween ADB and the investors will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential \nviolation of these undertakings.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n37.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of Singapore and the Government of PRC will be requested to confirm that it has \nno objection to the proposed assistance to ATRIUM PDFCO. No funding will be disbursed until \nADB receives such confirmation.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed equity investment would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  an  equity  investment  of  the  lesser  of  the  equivalent  in  Singapore  dollars  of \n$4,000,000 and 40% of the issued share capital of ATRIUM PDFCO Limited, on \nterms and conditions which are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthis report and as may be reported to the Board; and  \n \n(ii)  a waiver of (a) the single exposure limit; and (b) the requirement that ADB not be \nthe largest single shareholder in an investee company. \n \n \n  Haruhiko Kuroda \n  President \n \n \n27 November 2007", "Appendix 1     11      \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance  Data Sources/Reporting \nDesign Summary  Assumptions and Risks \nTargets/Indicators  Mechanisms \nImpact       \n     \nAssumption \n\u2022  Improved access to and  \u2022  Municipal and provincial  \u2022 Government reports and \nquality of urban water  level contribution to the  statistics  \u2022  Government continues to \nsupply, wastewater  Millennium Development    prioritize water and \ntreatment and sanitation  Goal targets on poverty,  \u2022 Media  wastewater investments \nthrough private sector  health, and the  in the national agenda \n \nparticipation contributing  environment by 2015 \nto improved health and    Risk \nproductivity in the PRC.  \u2022 Growth in municipal and \n\u2022 Macroeconomic outlook \n  provincial gross domestic \nmay deteriorate \nproducts \n \n\u2022  Private sector investment \nin the water sector \nincreases by at least 30% \nover the next 5 years. \n \n \n \n     \nOutcome \n\u2022 Improved access to safe  \u2022  Safe drinking water and  \u2022 Government reports  Assumption  \ndrinking water, and  proper sanitation made \n\u2022 ADB reports  \u2022 Government policies on \nsanitation for the people  in  available to up to 10 million \nwater and wastewater \nthe PRC, especially the  people by 2012   \ntariffs create an enabling \npoor \n\u2022 Up to 150 million cubic  environment for \n\u2022 Reduction in the pollution  meters per year of  promoting private sector \nof water in the rivers and  wastewater treatment  investment \nwater systems in the PRC  capacity built by 2012 \n \n\u2022 Expanded private sector  \u2022 Deepening of local \nparticipation through  currency financing, with \nincreased domestic and  larger volume and longer \ninternational commercial  tenor, for private sector \ninvestment and lending to  participation in water \nwater projects in the PRC.  projects and other private \nsector business. \n\u2022 Improved local bond \nmarket and finance market  \u2022 Increased use of the local \nfor mobilizing more capital  bond market to fund \nfor private sector projects.  private sector water \nprojects. \n \n \nOutputs       \n1.

", "    Appendix 2  13\nADB\u2019s WATER FINANCING PROGRAM \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) adopted its Water for All policy in January 2001. \nThe  policy  promotes  a  national  focus  on  water  sector  reform,  to  foster  the  integrated \nmanagement of water resources, and improve and expand the delivery of water services. ADB \nconducted  an  in-house  review  of  policy  implementation  in  2003,  and  commissioned  an \nindependent panel for a comprehensive policy implementation review in 2005.1\n \n2.  In  response  to  the  panel\u2019s  recommendations  and  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region\u2019s \nburgeoning need for water investment, reform, and capacity development, ADB management in \nMarch 2006 approved the launch of ADB\u2019s Water Financing Program (WFP) 2006\u20132010 to \ndouble water investments and achieve specific targeted outcomes. \n \n3.  Water  investments  were  also  prioritized  in  ADB\u2019s  Medium-Term  Strategy  II,  and  in \nDecember 2006, ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved the establishment of the Water Financing \nPartnership Facility (WFPF) to support WFP implementation. This followed the positive outcome \nof a review of WFPF\u2019s predecessor, the Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector,2 at the end of 5 \nyears. \n \nA.  The Region\u2019s Water Challenge \n4.  Rapid population growth, urbanization, and underperformance of existing water assets \nleave a large shortfall in meeting the region\u2019s water needs. According to official statistics that \ntend to present an overly positive situation, more than 600 million people in the Asia and Pacific \nregion are still without safe drinking water supplies and 1.8 billion have inadequate or no toilet \nfacilities. The actual numbers may be much higher. Investments to meet these basic human \nneeds, and to manage water resources and clean up water pollution, have fallen seriously \nbehind demand.  \n \n5.  The Asia Water Watch 20153 report published by ADB and partners in December 2005 \nestimated that minimum annual investments of $8 billion are needed over the next decade to \nmeet Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets for safe drinking water and sanitation alone \n(this estimate is based on official coverage statistics). Additional investments are also needed \nfor  irrigation  services,  river  basin  management,  flood  management  and  mitigation,  and \nwastewater management. \n \n6.  A panel led by Michel Camdessus in 2003 recommended a doubling of public and \nprivate water investments, and a taskforce led by Angel Gurria in 2006 pointed to a shortage of \nbankable water projects, mainly because of capacity constraints in local governments, water \nutilities,  and  river  basin  organizations.  The  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and \nDevelopment announced at the Stockholm World Water Week in August 2007 that it is about to \npublish research findings showing that infrastructure investment needs for water in the next 10 \nyears will be higher than for energy and transport investment.  \n \n7.  Per capita water availability in the Asia and Pacific region over the past decades has \nshrunk to half of the world average, and seasonal fluctuations are much more severe than in \n                                                 \n1  Available: http://www.adb.org/Water/Policy/review-panel.asp  \n2  Five RETA projects were approved for a total of $18.1 million during the period 2001\u20132006.   \n3  Asia Water Watch 2015. Available: http://www.adb.org/water/actions/REG/target-ten.asp\n ", "14    Appendix 2 \nregions with a temperate climate. Moreover, seasonal changes in water availability are expected \nto increase sharply as a result of climate change. Yet the region has only limited ability to \nmitigate the impact of these fluctuations, as its water storage capacity is low at 10%, compared \nwith 33% in North America. Meanwhile, water use in the region continues to increase at 2\u20133 \ntimes the population growth rate, which is putting enormous strain on water delivery services \nand the sustainable management of water resources.  \n \n8.  Investments in water are also crucial to meet the broader MDG targets of reducing \npoverty,  hunger,  child  and  maternal  mortality,  and  the  incidence  of  major  diseases,  and \nimproving environmental sustainability. This has led some developing member countries in \nSoutheast Asia to announce that they aim to accelerate investments to meet MDG target 10 on \nwater and sanitation by 2010. \n \n9.  Asia Water Watch 2015 documented evidence that governments can generate benefits \nof  up  to  $6  for  every  $1  invested  in  safe  drinking  water  and  sanitation.  Conversely,  it  is \nbecoming clear, although not yet sufficiently documented, that postponing much-needed water \ninvestments will significantly increase the costs of environmental clean-up and adversely impact \ngross domestic product (GDP) growth.  \n \nB.  Independent Panel Review \n \n10.  The  independent  review  panel  (footnote  1)  made  the  following  five  main \nrecommendations for ADB in 2006 to improve implementation of its Water for All policy: \n \n(i)  Increase commitments and develop capacity. ADB should double its water \ninvestments together with capacity development and a major public awareness \ncampaign. \n \n(ii)  Develop long-term partnerships with clients and stakeholders in the DMCs \nand among donors. ADB should focus on building broad-based support for the \nwater policy\u2019s principles through regional and in-country programs, which should \nhave a long-term focus rather than being project-centered.  \n \n(iii)  Focus  the  implementation  of  integrated  water  resources  management \n(IWRM) on stakeholder needs and ownership. ADB should provide continued \nsupport to promoting IWRM through training, planning, and implementation. ADB \nshould complete IWRM planning and implementation in five countries or five river \nbasins by the end of 2006 to showcase this priority.  \n \n(iv)  Promote  \"business  unusual\"  through  innovations  to  increase  access, \naffordability, efficiency, and cost effectiveness. ADB should implement the \nnew financial instruments of its innovation and efficiency initiative, and clarify its \npolicy on subsidies. ADB should also work harder at expediting service delivery \nto  the  poor  to  help  countries  meet  the  MDG  targets.  Alternative  investment \nmodalities with shorter gestation periods should be explored.  \n \n(v)  Improve processes to ensure effective policy implementation. ADB should \nstreamline  its  internal  processes  to  integrate  the  water  policy  into  project \noperations in the DMCs. ADB should also improve its skills-mix by recruiting \nmore specialists, by training staff, and by providing more incentives for improving \nwater operations. \n ", "Appendix 2      15 \nC.  ADB\u2019s Position \n \n11.  By launching the WFP and making water a core investment area under the Medium-\nTerm Strategy II, ADB management gave a clear and positive direction. The WFP seeks to \ndeliver water investments of $10 billion of ADB\u2019s own resources over the period 2006\u20132010. On \nan  annual  basis,  the  WFP  seeks  to  double  investments  from  $1.2  billion  in  1999  (before \nadoption of the water policy) to over $2 billion. Water lending was projected to reach 25% of \noverall ADB lending on a 3-year moving average.  \n \n12.  ADB will seek to mobilize and leverage cofinancing and investments from government \nclients (through counterpart financing), the private sector, and development partners to achieve \nthe WFP\u2019s targeted outcomes of : \n \n(i)  sustainable access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation for 200 million \npeople, \n(ii)  more productive and efficient irrigation and drainage services affecting 40 million \npeople, \n(iii)  reduced flood risk to 100 million people, \n(iv)  IWRM introduced in 25 river basins, and \n(v)  improved water governance.4 \n \n13.  The WFP has three main areas of investment: rural, urban, and basin water. \n \n(i)  Rural  water  services.  Rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  and  irrigation  and \ndrainage services to improve health and livelihoods.  \n(ii)  Urban  water  services.  Urban  water  supply,  sanitation  and  wastewater \nmanagement,  and  environmental  improvement  services  to  sustain  economic \ndevelopment.  \n(iii)  Basin  water  management.  Infrastructure  and  management  for  (a) \nmultifunctional water regulation and hydropower facilities developed in a river \nbasin context; (b) flood management; (c) the conservation and improvement of \nwatersheds, wetlands, and ecosystems; and (d) improved water governance. \n \n14.  The WFP also aims to offer a single-window approach for processing investments that \nhave  both  public  and  private  financing,  especially  in  urban  water  services.  Using  its  new \nfinancing modalities developed by the Innovation and Efficiency Initiative, a diverse range of \nfinancing and knowledge products will be made available for rural, urban, and basin water \ninvestments. \n \n15.  The WFP\u2019s main target countries are India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, and Viet Nam, which together account for about 80% of the current group of water \ninvestments. \n \n                                                 \n4  Targeted outcomes for improving water governance are being developed.    \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080104174754+08'00'", "Author": "Myla Villamor", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20080107154717+08'00'", "_ReviewCycleID": "1531399682", "Company": "Asian Development Bank", "SourceModified": "D:20080104094724", "Title": "Asia Training and Research Initiative on Urban Management Project Development Facility", "Keywords": "rrp: 41942 prc, asia training and research, urban management project development facility, water and sanitation, private sector development"}, "author_page": " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 21 November 2007) \n \n \nCurrency Unit \u2013  Singapore dollar (S$) \n \n  S$1.00 =  $0.6911 \n  $1.00 =  S$1.447 \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \nADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \nATRIUM  \u2013  Asia Training and Research Initiative on Urban Management \nBOT   \u2013  build-operate-transfer \nCFS  \u2013  complementary financing scheme \nDMC  \u2013  developing member country \nGDP  \u2013  gross domestic product \nIWRM  \u2013  integrated water resources management \nMDG  \u2013  Millennium Development Goal \nMTS  \u2013  Medium-Term Strategy \nPDFCO  \u2013  Project Development Facility Company Limited \nPPP  \u2013  public-private partnership \nPRC   \u2013  People\u2019s Republic of China \nPSOD  \u2013  Private Sector Operations Department \nSCE  \u2013  Singapore Cooperation Enterprise \nWFP  \u2013  Water Financing Program \n \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars, unless otherwise stated. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVice President  L.
