INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Solomon  Islands  Second  Road  Improvement  (Sector)  Project  (SIRIP  2)  was \napproved on 12 November 2009.1 The total cost of the project is $24.00 million and it will be \nfinanced by a $15.00 million grant from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), a $4.50 million \ngrant  from  Government  of  Australia  through  the  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (AusAID), a $3.34 million grant from the European Commission, and $1.16 million \nequivalent from the Government of Solomon Islands. The conditions of effectiveness of the \nADB2 grant were met by the government and the grant was declared effective on 10 March \n2010. The project is expected to close on 31 March 2012. \n \n2.  This paper seeks approval of the administration by ADB of new cofinancing grants \noffered by the Governments of Australia (A$300,000) and New Zealand (NZ$500,000) through \ntheir  international  development  agencies.  These  new  funds  have  been  offered  for  the \nrestoration of damaged transport infrastructure in west Guadalcanal caused by a series of \nfloods between January and March 2010. The restoration of damaged infrastructure will re-\nconnect a population of about 12,000 people in west Guadalcanal to food, medical supplies, \nschools, markets, and urban centers.  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND \n3.  SIRIP 2 aims to benefit about 41,000 people directly and to enhance the incomes of the \npoor and rural population. The project impact is expected to be economic growth and social \ndevelopment and a reduction in hardship and poverty. The outcome will be improved road \ntransport for economic and social activities. Outputs will include (i) an improved network of \nnational, provincial, and secondary roads; (ii) sound and sustainable road maintenance policies \nand practices; and (iii) more participation by communities and women in road maintenance. Key \nactivities will include (i) replacing or upgrading about 30 water crossings (bridges, culverts, and \nwet crossings); (ii) building about 20 kilometers (km) of associated bridge approaches, and, if \nnecessary,  relocating  sections  of  roads  for  climate  change  adaptation;  (iii)  upgrading  and \nsealing 10 km of road to prevent the loss of pavement materials during heavy rain and floods; \n(iv) community participation in road maintenance; and (v) continued capacity building begun \nunder the Solomon Islands Road Improvement (Sector) Project (SIRIP)  3 for national staff, \nconsultants, and contractors. \n \n4.  SIRIP 2 has two components: (i) civil works (road rehabilitation, road maintenance labor-\nbased, equipment-support methods and road maintenance); and (ii) consulting services (design \nand supervision, project management and capacity building). The Ministry of Infrastructure \nDevelopment (MID) is the executing agency for the project. The project is being implemented in \nGuadalcanal and Malaita provinces and, where funds allow, will also be extended to the seven \nother provinces, all of which have had insufficient investment in the past.4 \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2009.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grants and Administration of Grants to Solomon Islands for Second Road Improvement \n(Sector) Project. Manila. (Grants 0175-SOL, 0176-SOL and 0177-SOL) \n2  On 11 February and 8 March 2010, commitment letters from AusAID and European Commission respectively \nprovided satisfactory evidence that the recipient had obtained the approval of their respective grants, thereby \nsatisfying the conditions in declaring the ADB grant effective. \n3  ADB.  2007.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grants and Administration of Grants to Solomon Islands for Road Improvement (Sector) \nProject. Manila. (Grants 0048-SOL, 0049-SOL and 0050-SOL). \n4  The seven other provinces are Central, Choiseul, Isabel, Makira, Renbel, Temotu, and Western. \n ", "2 \n \n \n5.  Between January and March 2010, torrential rain and flood waters damaged bridge \napproaches on west Guadalcanal roads, disconnecting the road at several locations from the \ncapital, Honiara and severely disrupting transport services. The cost of reinstating the road and \nbridge  works,  including  consultancy  services  for  design  and  supervision,  is  approximately  \n$0.60 million. Because of a lack of funding, the Government of Solomon Islands, through MID, \nrequested its donor partners to assist with the required funds. \n \n6.  In response to MID's request, the Government of Australia through AusAID committed \nA$300,000  and  the  Government  of  New  Zealand  through  the  New  Zealand  Agency  for \nInternational Development (NZAID) committed NZ$500,000 to reinstate the road to restore \nconnectivity at the affected areas. The total additional funding amounts to $637,9945 and both \nAusAID and NZAID have requested that funds be specifically used to restore access to the \n12,000 people who have been cut off. These funds will be used to restore connections and \ninclude the costs of the civil works, consulting services, audit, bank charges and ADB's 5% \nadministration fee. The additional funds will increase the overall project cost from $24,000,000 \nto $24,637,994, an increase of 2.7%. The increase in overall project costs and the expansion of \nscope of works constitutes a minor change in scope. ADB, as the lead donor in transport \ninfrastructure in the Solomon Islands, will administer the AusAID and NZAID grants. MID will \nprocure all works and goods in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time) and will engage consultants in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of the grants \nadministered by ADB will be disbursed through direct payment in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). The detailed cost estimates by \nfinancier are attached as the Appendix.  \n \nIII.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n7.  I recommend that the Board approve on a no objection basis (i) the administration by \nADB  of  the  grant  not  exceeding  A$300,000  to  Solomon  Islands  to  be  provided  by  the \nGovernment  of  Australia;  and  (ii)  the  administration  by  ADB  of  the  grant  not  exceeding \nNZ$500,000 to Solomon Islands to be provided by the Government of New Zealand, in both \ncases for the Second Road Improvement (Sector) Project. \n                                                 \n5  $1.00 equated to A$1.0715 and NZ$1.3966 as of 12 April 2010. \n ", " \n \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLANa  \nORIGINAL 12 NOVEMBER 2009 \n($ million) \n \nGov\u2019t of \nItem  Gov\u2019t of  European  Solomon \nCost  ADB  Australiab  Commission  Islands \nA.
