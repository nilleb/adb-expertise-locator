THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Palau Public Utilities Corporation Reform Program, and (ii) a \nproposed policy-based loan (PBL) to the Republic of Palau for subprogram 1 of the Palau Public \nUtilities Corporation Reform Program. The report also describes proposed technical assistance \n(TA) for Strengthening Institutional Capacity of Palau Public Utilities Corporation, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe TA. \n \n2.  The program aims to strengthen state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in Palau by improving the \ncorporate governance and financial management of Palau\u2019s electricity and water utility company, \nPalau Public Utilities Corporation (PPUC), and providing an enabling environment for private \nsector participation in the electricity and water subsectors in Palau. The program will support the \ngovernment\u2019s long-term reforms in electricity and water and sanitation. The attached TA will \nsupport the implementation of ongoing and future energy and water and sanitation reforms and \nstrengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), PPUC, and Palau Energy Administration \n(PEA). \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Macroeconomic context. Palau consists of 340 islands, 10 of which are inhabited, with a \npopulation of about 18,400, almost 80% of whom live in Koror and Airai states. Development grants \nunder Palau\u2019s Compact of Free Association with the United States, expected to expire in fiscal \nyear (FY) 2024, contributed substantially to a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of $15,068 \nin FY2019. Palau depends heavily on revenues from tourism and services, which contribute almost \n55% of annual GDP and employ three-quarters of the country\u2019s formal workforce. Before the \ncoronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic,  Palau  had  maintained  an  annual  fiscal  surplus \naveraging the equivalent of 3.0% of GDP during FY2011\u2013FY2019, extending an impressive period \nof solid fiscal management that has resulted in annual surpluses since FY2011. This was facilitated \nby tax and revenue reforms that resulted in the tax-to-GDP ratio averaging 20.2% during FY2015\u2013\nFY2019, up from a 17.3% average during the preceding decade. Similarly, on the expenditure side, \nPalau has successfully controlled the public sector wage bill, which averaged 14.7% of GDP during \nFY2015\u2013FY2019, down from 17.1% of GDP on average in the decade prior. Public debt, estimated \nat the equivalent of about 32.5% of GDP in FY2019, was considered sustainable.1 \n \n4.  Coronavirus disease impact. With no tourist arrivals expected for at least 2 years, Palau\u2019s \neconomy is projected to contract by 9.5% in FY2020 and 12.8% in FY2021,2 compared with an \noriginal outlook of a return to growth by FY2021 after two years of decline.3 Estimates suggest that \ntotal tax revenue will decrease by $11 million in FY2020 (4% of GDP) and by $19 million in FY2021 \n(7% of GDP). With the drastic decline in revenues and increased health and social expenditures, \nfiscal deficits of $31.2 million (12.2% of GDP) in FY2020 and $53.4 million (23.8% of GDP) in \nFY2021 are projected. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated to rise from 32.5% in FY2019 to \n66.9% in FY2020 to help meet the projected financing gap. Furthermore, the decline in tourism will \n \n1  International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2020.

", "2 \nresult in increasing unemployment and poverty, particularly among women, who were mostly \nemployed in the tourism and hospitality sector. A sound macro-fiscal policy framework is seen to \nfacilitate a steady reduction in the fiscal deficit and debt burden after COVID-19. An independent \nassessment shows that if tourism and economic recovery can commence by FY2022, Palau can \nrevert to running a small but steadily rising fiscal surplus by FY2024, resulting in a gradual decline \nin the debt-to-GDP ratio to about 46.5% by FY2030.4 This is supported by the latest assessment \nof the International Monetary Fund (IMF) (footnote 1), which concludes that Palau\u2019s public debt will \nrise in the near-term but will remain sustainable, with concessional lending from development \npartners helping to mitigate debt risks. The IMF further notes that a track record of fiscal prudence \nallowed Palau to build buffers ahead of the pandemic. \n5. Achieving sustainable economic growth is complex and context-specific in the Pacific\ndeveloping member countries of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). However, the provision of\nmarket-augmented public goods such as electricity, water, and sanitation is a key determinant of\nthe quality of life for communities and, hence, the attractiveness of a country to private investment.\nWith COVID-19 and no tourism revenues, Palau is experiencing reduced demand for utility\nservices (electricity, water, and sewage) and lower revenues to sustain its public infrastructure.\n6. Sector context: water supply and sanitation. Palau has established, through ADB\nassistance, legal and regulatory frameworks for water and wastewater operations (WWO) on\ncommercial principles and at full cost recovery.5 About 96% of Palau\u2019s population has access to\npublic water supply systems. The Koror\u2013Airai water supply system services more than 96% of the\npopulation leaving in Koror-Airai. Water supply systems outside of Koror\u2013Airai are in poor condition\nand service delivery standards are low. Frequent water outages have a significant impact on\nwomen\u2019s time poverty. Palau has a sanitation policy and a sewerage master plan for Koror through\n2035. Priority investments identified in the Koror sewerage master plan are being delivered under\nthe ADB-financed Koror\u2013Airai Sanitation Project.6\n7. Energy sector. Since 2010, the government has implemented several significant reforms\nin the energy sector, including (i) signing into law the Palau Energy Act and creating its regulatory\nframework; (ii) setting a renewable energy target of 45% by 2025;7 and (iii) approving energy\nefficiency benchmarks and tariff methodology. However, Palau remains highly dependent on fossil\nfuel (diesel), which contributes to 95% of energy generation (compared with 5% of renewable\nenergy generation). This has resulted in a high cost of electricity production. Power generation,\ntransmission,  and  distribution  reliability  and  efficiency  are  below  Pacific  benchmarks  and\nundermined by aged assets and no maintenance and replacement.8 Unreliable power has a\ndisproportionate impact on women, who are responsible for most household tasks, and contributes\nto women\u2019s time poverty. Establishing a reliable and efficient grid with financially sustainable\nnetwork management will attract private sector investment in renewable energy and improve\nsector performance.\n4  Graduate School USA. 2020.

PPUC was established in 1994 as a government-\nowned utility for power generation, transmission, and distribution, and became responsible for the \nprovision of public WWO in 2013.9 Women are underrepresented at PPUC, and the company has \nmade little effort to undertake institutional gender mainstreaming initiatives or proactive actions to \nincrease women\u2019s employment. PEA, acting as the energy regulator, sets PPUC\u2019s tariffs based on \na cost-recovery methodology. In FY2016, PPUC almost achieved its target of full cost recovery for \nenergy and WWO, as total revenue rose to more than 90% of total operating expenses. However, \nin 2017, the Olbiil Era Kelulau10 froze tariffs for electricity and WWO because of political concerns \nabout perceived service costs and quality. Subsequently, PPUC has incurred significant losses \nand has insufficient revenue to cover its basic operations without government support.  \n \n9.  Deteriorating performance of the Palau Public Utilities Corporation. As Palau\u2019s largest \nSOE, PPUC\u2019s poor financial performance is a major burden on Palau\u2019s economy, imposing high \nrisks to both fiscal and financial sustainability. Since 2014, PPUC, the only SOE that has failed to \noperate commercially, has incurred losses of $21.9 million, or 8% of GDP.11 With operating losses \nof $6.87 million (2.6% of GDP),12 and its largest cash deficit (20% of revenues) in FY2019, PPUC \nmaintained its liquidity by deferring all maintenance works. Delayed metering and power grid \nupgrades have resulted in network losses up to 16%. These issues, combined with inadequate \nfinancial management (poor accounting systems, delayed reporting, and audit), has thrust PPUC \ninto a negative spiral of limited investments, poor efficiency, and debt. \n \n10.  Reliance on government support and widening fiscal risk. More than 85% of Palau\u2019s \npublic debt is owned by SOEs, and PPUC is a single largest borrower, with outstanding debt of \n$21.9 million (32% of SOEs\u2019 total debt, or 8% of GDP). With negative liquidity, PPUC requires \ncontinuous government support to remain solvent. PPUC is also heavily dependent on annual \nsubsidies for operation and maintenance and for replacing capital assets. Since 2013, PPUC has \nreceived more than $20 million (7.5% of GDP) in state subsidies, including operational subsidies \nof $14.65 million and an equity injection of $5.5 million.13 Without reforms, the government will \nneed to increase its subsidies to PPUC by at least 80% (equivalent to an additional 8% of GDP) \nover the next 5 years. \n \n11.  Poor corporate governance and transparency. Initiated in 2015, SOE corporatization is \nincomplete,  with  mixed  results  in  adopting  and  operationalizing  corporate  governance  and \ntransparency norms. The government\u2019s SOE oversight mechanism and transparency framework \nare not yet established, which inhibits timely disclosure of corporate statements by SOE boards \nand reduces performance quality and accountability. The SOE boards, including the PPUC board, \nare mostly focused on basic legal compliance and are rarely held accountable for performance. \nContinuous reliance on subsidies has led to heavy public sector influence on PPUC\u2019s governance, \naffecting the quality of financial disclosure. Lacking corporate board practices, gender diversity, \nand independent decision-making, PPUC has failed to develop a high-performance culture in \nsetting revenue and operational targets, resulting in poor creditworthiness. \n \n12.  Lack  of  private  investment  in  renewable  energy,  and  water  and  wastewater \noperations. PPUC is heavily dependent on public funds, with no access to private capital for \nenergy or WWO investments. With fuel expenses making up more than 65% of generation costs, \n \n9   Utilities Consolidation Act (2013). \n10  Olbiil Era Kelulau, Belau\u2019s National legislative body, is a bi-cameral National Congress made up of the House of \nDelegates and the Senate. \n11  PPUC Audited Statements, FY2014\u2013FY2018. \n12  PPUC Audited Statements, FY2019 (draft). \n13  From PPUC financial statements, FY2013\u2013FY2018.

The government has prioritized the transition \nto renewable energy by introducing long-term concessions for independent power producers \n(IPPs). While power purchase agreements (PPAs) are instrumental for hedging IPPs\u2019 operational \nrisks, PPUC\u2019s underperformance and negative liquidity is a key country risk in attracting IPPs. It is \nestimated that the government\u2019s contingent liability associated with PPAs to keep PPUC solvent \ncosts about 1% of GDP annually.14 Furthermore, Palau\u2019s grid has not been augmented and the \nnetwork has not been upgraded, as required to meet its renewable energy target of 45% by 2025. \n13. ADB\u2019s previous engagement and lessons. Lessons from ADB operations in Palau\nsuggest that (i) it is critical to allocate sufficient TA resources to support reforms given shortages\nand/or high turnover of qualified staff, and (ii) reform programs require more comprehensive (tariff\nand nontariff) dialogue with government stakeholders to ensure that agreed policy reforms can be\nimplemented in a changing political environment (footnote 5). Previous policy-based operations in\nthe  Pacific  also  show  that  (i)  strong  government  ownership  is  critical  to  achieving  results;\n(ii) sustained policy dialogue and coordination with development partners are important to advance\nreforms; and (iii) coordinated TA projects, provided in parallel with budget support programs, are\ncrucial  to  implement  the  reform  agenda.15 The  program  also  draws  upon  the  lessons  and\nrecommendations from a 2018 report by ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department on SOE\nreforms in ADB developing member countries, including lessons related to supporting government\noversight mechanisms for SOEs, SOE board issues, accountability, and governance risks.16\nB. Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition\n14. Government\u2019s reform agenda. Palau\u2019s strategy for development of water and sanitation\nis guided by Palau\u2019s Water Policy (2012) and the Water Policy and Sanitation Master Plan (2011\u2013\n2036).17 Both documents remain relevant. The government adopted a strong reform agenda in the\nutility and energy sectors by (i) prioritizing tariff reforms to introduce market-driven incentives for\nPPUC\u2019s sustainability, and (ii) leveraging private investments to meet the country\u2019s renewable\nenergy target of 45% by 2025. 18 An increase in renewable generation is expected to reduce the\noverall cost of electricity supply, lowering customers\u2019 tariff and phasing out subsidies. With the\nadverse impacts of COVID-19, utility reforms\u2014including tariffs and rationalized subsidies, good\ngovernance, and financial management\u2014are essential to ensure PPUC\u2019s positive contribution to\nthe economic efficiency, competitiveness, and security of utility services.\n15. The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and supports the following operational\npriorities: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; (ii) accelerating progress in\ngender equality; and (iii) strengthening governance and institutional capacity.19\n16. Program modality. The government has requested a programmatic approach comprising\ntwo  subprograms  to  support  the  PPUC\u2019s  reforms,  consistent  with  national  objectives. 20\nThe programmatic approach allows a longer horizon to effectively implement politically sensitive\nreforms in both energy and WWO. The sequencing of subprograms is intended to prioritize reforms\nunder subprogram 1 that will sustain PPUC\u2019s viability, financed by energy operations, which\naccount for more than 72% of PPUC\u2019s total revenues and 92% of its liquidity. Also, subprogram 1\n14  IMF. 2018. Article IV Review Mission to Republic of Palau. Washington, DC. \n15  ADB. 2019.

", "5 \nwill  focus  on  cross-sectoral  issues  of financial  management (reform area  2)  and corporate \ngovernance and transparency (reform area 3) to maximize synergies between energy and WWO. \nSubprogram 2 will build on achievements under subprogram 1 and focus mostly on WWO and \nremaining cross-sectoral reforms in reform areas 2 and 3. Both subprograms will support reforms \nin the following four areas. \n \n17.  Reform area 1: Tariff reforms managed. Energy tariff reforms are essential to improving \nPPUC\u2019s financial sustainability. PEA, under the Ministry of Public Infrastructure, Industries and \nCommerce, has approved (i) a new cost-recovery tariff regulation for PPUC\u2019s electricity tariffs, and \n(ii) guidelines for electricity tariff petition by PPUC. The new regulation will enable PPUC to \ngenerate  sufficient  revenue  to  cover  its  fixed  and  variable  costs  for  power  infrastructure \ndevelopment and maintenance. The new guidelines for electricity tariff petition include procedures \nfor (i) implementing a subsidy program for poor and low-income households with clear and explicit \ninstructions on types of subsidies, households\u2019 eligibility criteria, and procedures to apply for \nallocated  subsidies;  (ii)  launching  an  awareness-raising  campaign  for  poor  and  low-income \nhouseholds on the subsidy program, eligibility criteria, and the process of applying for subsidized \nelectricity consumption; and (iii) improving communication about the existing grievance redress \nmechanism for receiving and resolving complaints from customers. To comply with the new \nregulations, PPUC has prepared an electricity tariff petition based on a cost recovery method and \nsubmitted it to PEA.21 \n \n18.  Under subprogram 2, the government plans to expand PEA\u2019s mandate, enabling it to also \nassume a regulatory function for WWO; approve a new regulation for setting cost-recovery tariffs \nfor WWO; and issue guidelines for WWO tariff petition, including raising awareness of the WWO \nsubsidy program. Approval of the new cost-recovery tariff regulation and of tariff petition guidelines \nwill support the operational sustainability and reliability of WWO. \n \n19.  Reform area 2: PPUC\u2019s financial management enhanced. This output will enhance \nPPUC\u2019s financial management by establishing reporting and disclosure norms based on industry \nstandards. The PPUC board approved PPUC\u2019s accounting policy and procedures, compliant with \nUnited States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, to maintain its financial and accounting \nrecords  comprehensively  and  accurately.  The  new  accounting  policy  and  procedures  will \nstandardize PPUC\u2019s accounting function, measurement system, and procedures for presenting \ndisclosures. The PPUC board also approved the required corporate annual revenue model for \nelectricity operations during 2021\u20132023. This model will support PPUC\u2019s financial projections \nbased on its revenue requirements\u2014i.e., the total amount of revenue required to recover its costs \nof electricity supply, where such costs include prudent operation and maintenance costs and \nreasonable  rates  of  return  on  debt  and  equity  required  to  finance  capital  investments. \nPPUC\u2019s projected revenue requirement is determined by comparing PPUC\u2019s total revenue with its \noperating and capital costs in FY2021 to estimate the ability of existing tariffs to recover its costs. \nThe PPUC board also approved PPUC\u2019s revenue enhancement action plan for 2021. The action \nplan prioritizes two high-value emergency actions to restore PPUC\u2019s sustainability.22 The action \nplan  is  aligned  with  PPUC\u2019s  long-term,  least-cost  power  generation  and  transmission \nenhancement plan for 2021\u20132024, to be approved under subprogram 2 (para. 20). \n \n20.  Under subprogram 2, the government will focus on PPUC\u2019s WWO by approving (i) PPUC\u2019s \nannual revenue required model for WWO, and (ii) PPUC\u2019s WWO revenue enhancement action \n \n21  PEA is solely responsible for electricity tariffs in Palau.  \n22  The emergency actions are (i) installation of pre\u2013paid meters, which will improve PPUC\u2019s revenue, cash collection, \nand liquidity, reducing technical losses; and (ii) replacement of the critical control system at the Malakal Power \nStation, which will avoid the risk of disastrous shut down and contribute to the security and reliability of more than \nhalf of the electricity consumed in Palau. \n ", "6 \nplan for 2022. Going forward, PPUC will restore its sustainability and stabilize its investments and \nfinancing according to the long-term, least-cost power generation and transmission enhancement \nplan  for  2021\u20132024,  and  the  Water  Policy  and  Sanitation  Master  Plan,  2011\u20132036. 23 \nSubprogram 2 will also induce professional management by setting up a business analytics \nframework for PPUC for electricity and WWO. \n21. Reform area 3:  PPPUC\u2019s corporate governance and transparency strengthened.\nTo comply with the Palau SOE Policy (2015), the PPUC board approved a code of corporate\ngovernance based on Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Guidelines for\nCorporate Governance of SOEs.24 The corporate governance code aims to ensure that PPUC\u2019s\nboard members represent the interests of the corporation in an independent manner and in\naccordance with established international corporate governance standards.25 To comply with\ntransparency requirements, the PPUC board approved procedures for audit, risk, and compliance\nconsistent with international standards on auditing to establish oversight of (i) financial reporting\nintegrity; (ii) the independence, qualifications, and performance of the corporation\u2019s external\nindependent auditor and the performance of the internal auditor; (iii) evaluating risks in operations\nand investment decisions; and (iv) compliance with the legal and regulatory framework of Palau.\n22. To promote gender equality, the PPUC board approved PPUC\u2019s gender strategy for 2020\u2013\n2023, consistent with the Palau National Gender Mainstreaming Policy (2018). PPUC will take\naffirmative measures provided in this gender strategy to promote and apply the principles of gender\nequality in the workplace as well as in relations with customers. PPUC will support developing a\nskilled and diverse workforce that will contribute to efficient business processes and organizational\nproductivity. Furthermore, the PPUC board approved new corporate gender-sensitive human\nresources management procedures, including flexible working hours, introduction of parental\nleave,  and  protocols  to  protect  against  workplace  harassment  and  discrimination  (including\ngender-based discrimination and sexual harassment). The new human resources procedures will\nensure a supportive workplace environment for all employees irrespective of gender and free from\ndiscrimination and harassment related to gender, race, or age bias.\n23. Subprogram 2 will support PPUC\u2019s strengthened governance and transparency by the\nboard\u2019s approval of (i) PPUC\u2019s statement of corporate intent, performance reporting standards,\nand key targets (including on gender diversity); (ii) sustainable debt management procedures; and\n(iii) PPUC\u2019s  board  nomination  and  integrity  procedures  to  enhance  board  independence.\nUnder subprogram 2, the government plans to improve the governance and transparency of SOEs\nthrough the MOF\u2019s adoption of SOE performance monitoring policies and procedures.\n24. Reform area 4: Market access for private sector participation in energy sector\nimproved. The government has approved a new regulation to promote the development of\nrenewable energy facilities by IPPs, which mandates PEA to (i) set licensing requirements applying\nto IPPs, (ii) review and approve PPAs between PPUC (the off-taker) and IPPs, and (iii) administer\nthe process for soliciting renewable energy from the IPPs through a formal tender procedure.\nTo comply with the new regulations, PEA approved the PPUC\u2019s capacity plan, the objective of\nwhich is to confirm grid capacity availability for renewable energy producers and IPPs, and to\nestablish measures for expanding power transmission infrastructure.\n23  Footnote 16. \n24  OECD. 2015.

", "7 \n25.  Under subprogram 2, the government plans to expand and upgrade its capacity plan by \napproving PPUC\u2019s long-term least-cost generation and transmission enhancement plan (2021\u2013\n2025), which will phase out depreciated assets and prioritize renewable energy evacuation. \nTo manage the  potential  risk  of  contingent  liability,  the MOF  intends to  approve  disclosure \nprocedures for public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs), including energy PPPs, that are compliant with \nindustry good practices.26 \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s contribution to the program. ADB has been a major reform partner and has built \na  strong  relationship  with  the  government  in  supporting  PPUC\u2019s  corporate  reforms  and \nimplementing the policy reforms under subprogram 1.27The program complements and underpins \n \nADB\u2019s project loans and assistance in 2021\u20132022 for (i) power grid enhancement,28 (ii) disaster-\nresilient clean energy financing, 29 and (iii) an ongoing IPP transaction in renewable energy.30 \n \n27.  Development partner coordination. ADB coordinated with the IMF the program design \nand implementation of the policy reforms under subprogram 1. In its 2018 Article IV consultation \nstaff report (footnote 14), the IMF highlighted the need to reform PPUC to contain quasi-fiscal risks \nand support long-term fiscal sustainability. IMF\u2019s assessment letter confirms that the program \nwould not adversely impact the country\u2019s debt sustainability and would help Palau contain quasi-\nfiscal risks and support long-term fiscal sustainability.31 Discussions with the IMF were also \nconducted to ensure alignment of ADB and IMF assessments regarding Palau\u2019s broader macro-\nfiscal framework and prospects for recovery post-COVD-19. To cope with COVID-19 and finance \npandemic response measures, Palau prioritizes mobilization of concessional financing and grants \nfrom bilateral partners including Japan; Taipei,China; and the United States. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n28.  The program is aligned with Palau\u2019s development objectives: (i) SOEs\u2019 sustainability, \nincluding full-cost recovery of business and capital, achieved; and (ii) reliability and resiliency of \nenergy supply improved based on adequate regulatory framework and tariffs.32 Improving PPUC\u2019s \nfinancial performance and sustainability and increasing the reliability of electricity and WWO will \nbring incremental and non-incremental benefits to consumers in Palau. Incremental benefits will \narise from additional consumption of electricity by existing and new customers connected to the \npower grid. Non-incremental benefits will accrue from more affordable and cheaper supply, from \nrenewable generation replacing fossil fuel-based generation, and from reduced use of costly back-\nup power generators. Economic benefits will also accrue from improved WWO, especially among \nmore remote populations. The program will contribute to budgetary headroom estimated at \n$68.9 million (23.5% of GDP) over 10 years, enabling the government to invest in critical areas \nwith significant and positive impacts on economic growth and employment.33 \n \n \n26  The MOF will be supported by ADB. 2019.

Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n29.  The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to heavily impact Palau\u2019s economy, resulting in high \nprojected fiscal deficits of up to $53.4 million (23.8%) for FY2021, compared with an $8.5 million \nsurplus projected pre-pandemic.34 This sharp increase in the deficit has been driven by temporary \nexpenditures under the COVID Relief One Stop Shop Act (2020) and a fall in tax revenues. In July \n2020, ADB approved a $20 million concessional loan under its COVID-19 Pandemic Response \nOption modality, which, along with the disbursement of $15 million in contingent disaster financing, \nassisted Palau in fully meeting its development financing needs for FY2020.35 The proposed \nprogram is prioritized by the government as a key reform program, with the first subprogram of \n$5.0 million filling about 9.4% of the $53.4 million gross financing requirement for FY2021.36 The \ngovernment has engaged in initial discussions with the World Bank and the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation as potential financiers of budget support in FY2021 to mitigate adverse \nsocial impacts from the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Cofinancing would also prevent the government \nfrom drawing on its general fund deposit, which totals $31.2 million and which it needs to maintain \nan adequate fiscal buffer to enable immediate response to future disasters, to which Palau is highly \nvulnerable. \n \n30.  To support Palau\u2019s increasing development financing needs and help meet the costs of \nimplementing reforms, the government has requested a loan of $5 million from ADB\u2019s concessional \nordinary capital resources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2.0% per year during the grace period and \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The indicative \nloan amount for subprogram 2 is $5 million from ADB\u2019s concessional ordinary capital resources. \nAlthough the loan will inevitably lift the public debt ratio, it will not undermine its downward trend in \nthe medium term. The loan will not add significantly to the annual debt service obligations facing \nthe government. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n31.  The  MOF  is  the  program\u2019s  executing  agency  and  responsible  for  overall  program \nmonitoring and reporting. PPUC and PEA will be the implementing agencies. A program steering \ncommittee chaired by the minister of finance and comprising senior officials from PEA and the \nPPUC  board  will  meet  quarterly  to  review  progress  in  implementing  the  reforms. \nThe implementation period is May 2020\u2013October 2020 for subprogram 1 and February 2021\u2013\nFebruary 2022 for subprogram 2. All subprogram 1 policy actions have been accomplished. \nThe TA will prepare subprogram 2 and provide requisite analytical support to implement the policy \nactions. The proceeds of the PBL will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n32.  The attached TA will support (i) WWO tariff and regulatory reforms, (ii) PPUC\u2019s financial \nmanagement  and  governance,  (iii)  public\u2013private  partnership  transparency  and  disclosure, \n(iv) gender and social safeguards, and (v) workshops and trainings. \n \n \n34  The gross financing requirement (without grants) is projected at $99.3 million, compared with $37.3 million before \nCOVID-19. \n35  ADB. 2020.

Manila. \n36  The program represents 7.9% of Palau\u2019s outstanding public debt stock of nearly $126 million. \n ", "9 \n33.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6).37 The government and PPUC will provide \ncounterpart staff remuneration, office accommodation and supplies, local transport, and other \nlogistical support. The implementation arrangements for the TA will be aligned with those of the \nPBL. A total of 50 person-months of consultancy services (international and national) will be \nrequired intermittently. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or \nstaff instructions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n34.  Safeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), this program \nis classified category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.38 \nInvestment activities prohibited under ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement will be excluded. \n \n35.  Poverty and social. Access to modern, reliable, and affordable energy services under the \nprogram will have direct and indirect impacts on poverty reduction and inclusive economic growth. \nPalau  is  almost  100%  electrified,  but  utility  services  (electricity  and  water)  are  unreliable, \nwith unscheduled interruptions occurring regularly. The country has one of the highest energy \npoverty rates in the Pacific.39 Policy reforms undertaken by the government for subprogram 1 \ninclude cost-recovery tariff regulations and electricity tariff petition guidelines that provide for \nimproved access to the lifeline tariff subsidy program for poor and vulnerable consumers.40  \n \n36.  Gender. The program is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. Proactive gender \nmeasures under the program include a set of policy actions approved by the PPUC board \n(para. 22). COVID-19 is exacerbating the existing gender wage gap for women, particularly for \nhouseholds headed by women (34% of total Palauan households), which have a gender income \ngap of 18% compared with households headed by men. Given the increased economic challenges \nthat women and households headed by women are facing, a clear and fit-for-purpose electricity \nsubsidy program for poor and low-income households will better target those most in need. \nThe awareness-raising  campaign  on  the  subsidy  program,  eligibility  requirements,  and  the \napplication process (para. 17) will improve women\u2019s access to subsidies (as many women from \npoor or low-income households may not be aware of the program or eligibility criteria).  \n \n37.  Governance. Palau has made considerable progress in improving the legal and regulatory \nframework for public financial management, with transparent accounting, budgeting, and auditing \nsystems in place. The public budget documents present the basic and supplementary information \nrequired to support transparency of funds flow. The financial statements of all SOEs, including \nPPUC, are compliant with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles reporting standards and have \nbeen  audited  since  2010.  To  strengthen  PPUC\u2019s  fiscal  risk  management,  the  government \nmandated PEA to monitor PPA terms and conditions consistent with PPUC offtake capacity. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in the table and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.41 \n \n \n37  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n38  ADB.
