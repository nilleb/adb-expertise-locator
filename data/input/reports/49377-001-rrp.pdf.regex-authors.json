THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the Madhya Pradesh District Roads II Sector Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will improve about 1,500 kilometers (km) of major district roads (MDRs) in \nthe state of Madhya Pradesh, in line with the state\u2019s road development plan for 2013\u20132033.2 It \nwill involve upgrading MDRs to an intermediate lane width of 5.5 meters, or two lane widths of 7 \nmeters, depending on traffic requirements; reconstruction, widening, and strengthening culverts \nand bridges; and maintaining the improved road assets for 5 years after construction. The \nproject will also develop and introduce a cashless accident victim treatment facility in the state, \nand improve the accident response system. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  State  context.  The  present  boundaries  of  the  state  of  Madhya  Pradesh  were \nreconstituted in November 2000 after its division to create the state of Chhattisgarh. It is still the \nsecond-largest state in the country, with an area of about 308,000 square kilometers and a \npopulation of about 73 million.3 Madhya Pradesh is among the poorer states in the country with \nper capita income at about 70% of the national average.4 However, its gross state domestic \nproduct grew at a compound annual rate of about 8.4% during FY2005\u2013FY2015. The gross \nstate domestic product per capita increased at an average annual rate of 6.9% during the same \nperiod, fostered by a series of developments. These include the Pithampur\u2013Dhar\u2013Mhow region \nas a key node on the Delhi\u2013Mumbai Industrial Corridor, as well as many industrial areas and \nindustrial growth centers. However, agriculture still underpins the state's economy and about \n70%  of  the  people  live  in  rural  areas.  Because  industrial  development  and  agricultural \nproduction are dispersed, the road network is a vital element of the economic infrastructure.  \n \n4.  Road network. The state has a road network of about 127,000 km, of which about \n4,700 km are national highways, 11,000 km are state highways, and 20,000 km are MDRs. \nRural roads make up the balance of the road network. The number of annually registered \nvehicles in the state has increased at an average annual rate of 9.7% since 2003 to reach about \n8.8 million in 2013.5 The Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation (MPRDC) estimated \nthat annual vehicular growth in 2011\u20132021 will exceed 7%.6 Average daily traffic has been \nincreasing commensurately with vehicle ownership. The government estimated that more than \n$1.2 billion will be needed in 2013\u20132023 to meet the state\u2019s investment requirements for roads.7 \n \n5.  Road development program. The state is close to completing its program to upgrade \nthe  entire  state  highway  network  through  a  combination  of  budgetary  allocations,  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  support  through  three  previous  loans,  and  public\u2013private \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  MDRs form the third tier of the state road network, after national highways and state highways. \n3  Government of India. 2011.

", "2 \npartnerships.8 However, MDRs have received marginal attention, and major portions of them \nstill need to be upgraded. The Government of Madhya Pradesh has made improvements of \nMDRs an essential part of upgrading the state road core network, which is being carried out \nthrough  the  proposed  plan  in  Table  1.  ADB  approved  one  previous  loan  for  MDR \nimprovements.9  \n \nTable 1: Proposed Improvement Plan for Major District Roads \nMajor District Roads in Madhya Pradesh  Length (Kilometers) \nUnder construction by MPPWD  3,107 \nRecently completed or under construction by MPRDC  3,184 \nIn good condition  4,679 \nProposed under this project  1,500 \nProposed for New Development Bank   1,500 \nBalance to be constructed through other means  5,459 \nTotal  19,429 \nMPPWD  =  Madhya  Pradesh  Public  Works  Department;  MPRDC  =  Madhya  Pradesh  Road  Development \nCorporation. \nSource: MPRDC. \n \n6.  Project basis. Madhya Pradesh has a high incidence of poverty and needs substantial \ninvestments to meet its developmental needs. MDRs are a key link in the road network between \nrural  roads  and  the  state  highways.  Continued  development  of  this  network  will  foster \ninclusiveness by giving more of the state\u2019s population easier access to markets and basic \nservices. ADB has assisted the state government with three previous loans to improve state \nhighways and one loan for MDRs, and ADB\u2019s loans to the central line ministry have also been \nused for rural roads in the state.10 ADB\u2019s assistance to the state\u2019s road sector has provided an \nopportunity for ADB to build institutional capacity of MPRDC, as well as to participate in, and \nsubstantially complete, the development of all tiers of the state road network. Through this \nproject, ADB will help complete the state-wide road improvement program, stabilize and deepen \ninstitutional capacity, and improve road safety and accident response initiatives. The project is \nconsistent  with  the  strategic  objectives  in  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  India  to \ndevelop the state core road network, focus on lagging states, and (in the transport sector) \nincrease the movement of people and goods.11 The project is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan, 2016\u20132018, for India.12 \n \n7.  Modality. Sector lending13 is well suited for this project because (i) the project covers a \nnumber of MDRs distributed across the state; (ii) Madhya Pradesh has a sector development \n                                                \n8 ADB. 2002.

MPRDC, set up under \nan ADB technical assistance project (footnote 8), is crucial to this capacity. Incorporated in 2004, \nMPRDC was designated as a highway authority under the state\u2019s highway legislation to develop \nstate highways, MDRs, and other infrastructure. The chief minister of Madhya Pradesh is chair \nof the MPRDC board; the minister for the state\u2019s Public Works Department and the chief \nsecretary of the state are the vice-chairs. MPRDC has developed a strong managerial and \ntechnical team headed by its managing director, who is a senior officer of the government. \nMPRDC has substantive project implementation experience from previous ADB loans. Under \nthe sector loan, the approval of non-sample road subprojects will be based on satisfactory \ntechnical, economic, social, and environmental assessments.14 MPRDC and ADB will agree on \nthe eligibility criteria, which will be based on the respective criteria set out for the sample roads. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  impact  will  be  improved  mobility  and  accessibility,  which  is  aligned  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan.15 The outcome will be improved road transport efficiency \nand safety in Madhya Pradesh. \n \nC.  Outputs \n9.  The project outputs will be the following: \n(i)  Major district roads reconstructed and rehabilitated. About 1,400\u20131,500 km \nof  MDRs,  designed  to  all-weather  standards  and  road  safety,  will  be \nreconstructed  and  rehabilitated.  The  roads  will  be  constructed  with  concrete \npavements which will improve asset life and maintainability. The construction \ncontracts will include 5-year, performance-based maintenance obligations, which \nwill also improve the quality of assets created as the contractors will need to \nkeep in view the extended risk liability.  \n(ii)  Cashless accident victim treatment facility implemented. The facility will be a \ngroup insurance product that enables the treatment of road accident victims in \nproximate hospitals. This facility will be available in nonurban areas, initially in 3\u2013\n4 districts of the state, with insurance premiums being paid using ADB financing. \n(iii)  Accident response system improved. Hardware and networking improvements \nto  the  existing  accident  response  system  will  be  upgraded  to  increase  the \ncapacity and reach of the system, and enhance interfacing with other services. \nWhile Madhya Pradesh was one of the first states in India to establish such a \nsystem  and  provide  links  to  ambulances  throughout  the  state,  the  current \ninitiative will mainstream these systems. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n10.  The project is estimated to cost $500 million (Table 2). Detailed cost estimates by \nfinancier and by year are in the project administration manual (PAM).16 \n                                                \n14 Non-sample roads under the sector lending modality are those that are not prepared by MPRDC and appraised in \ndetail by ADB at the time of loan approval, but which will be prepared later by MPRDC and approved by ADB as \nper agreed frameworks. \n15 Government of India, Planning Commission. 2013.

The Government of India has requested a loan of $350,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. The \ngovernment has requested the straight-line repayment option. Based on these loan terms and \nthis repayment option, the average loan maturity is 15.25 years and the maturity premium \npayable to ADB is 0.10% per year.17 \n \n12.  The financing plan is in Table 3. The ADB loan will finance 70% of the project cost. The \nState Government of Madhya Pradesh has allocated counterpart financing for 30% of the cost. \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \n     Ordinary capital resources (loan)  350   70 \nGovernment (State Government of Madhya Pradesh)  150   30 \nTotal  500  100 \nSources: State Government of Madhya Pradesh and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The executing agency for the project will be the Public Works Department, Government \nof Madhya Pradesh, acting through MPRDC. MPRDC will be responsible for day-to-day project \nimplementation and management through its field offices at key locations, and will assign staff \nto work on the project. One or two full-time project managers will be assigned for each contract \npackage,  with  delegated  technical  and  administrative  authority  for  expeditious  project \n                                                \n17 The loan terms are subject to confirmation by the Government of India. \n ", "5 \nimplementation.  MPRDC  will  engage  construction  supervision  consultants  (CSCs)  as  the \nengineers for the construction contracts. All procurement of goods and works will be undertaken \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). All \nconsultants will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). \n \n14.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 16).  \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  November 2016\u2013September 2020 \nEstimated completion date  30 September 2020 (loan closing date: 31 March 2021) \nManagement \n(i)   Executing agency  Public Works Department, Government of Madhya Pradesh, acting through MPRDC \n(ii)   Implementation units  10 project implementation units of MPRDC at Seoni, Gwalior (2), Indore, Jabalpur, \nRewa (2), Sagar, Ujjain, and Shahdol.

During project preparation, MPRDC\u2019s preparation activities for the sample roads were \nwell advanced. Based on ADB\u2019s approval of advance contracting of civil works in December \n2015, the Government of India requested retroactive financing for all project components. Up to \n20% of the amount of the loan proceeds ($70 million) will be eligible for retroactive financing, \nprovided that expenditures are incurred on works, equipment, and consulting services for the \nproject during the 12 months before the signing of the loan and project agreements. These \nexpenditures  should  follow  agreed  procedures,  including  ADB  approval  of  contract-specific \nenvironmental management plans (EMPs). The Government of India, Government of Madhya \nPradesh, and MPRDC have been informed that approval of advance contracting and retroactive \nfinancing does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n16.  The project was prepared with the enhanced capacity MPRDC gained through the four \nprevious  ADB  loans  and  technical  assistance  (footnotes  8  and  9).  MPRDC\u2019s  consultants \nprepared detailed design documents for the roads proposed for ADB financing, incorporating \nADB requirements of economic, social, and environmental studies into the consultants\u2019 terms of \nreference. ADB engaged individual consultants to conduct an economic assessment and due \ndiligence on environmental and social safeguards to ensure that the consultants\u2019 work complies \nwith  ADB  requirements.  The  engineering  design  was  prepared  to  avoid  land  acquisition, \n ", "6 \nminimize  social  and  environmental  impacts,  incorporate  road  safety,  and  mitigate  climate \nchange risks. In addition, advance actions were taken to ensure that construction can start early. \nThese measures to improve project readiness will facilitate faster project implementation. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n17.  The economic evaluation of the project followed the standard practice of comparing life \ncycle costs with and without the project, using the net present value with a 12% discount rate \nand the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as decision criteria. The economic analysis was \nconducted with the highway development model 4, which estimates road agency costs and road \nuser costs to assess the economic viability of project roads using input data on traffic, road \ngeometry,  pavement  structure,  condition  and  material  characteristics  of  the  existing  road, \nmaintenance and road improvement costs, and vehicle operating costs. The value added from \nimproved transport links, resulting in new industries and employment, are captured through \nbenefits from generated traffic. \n \n18.  The economic analysis was conducted for nine sample MDRs totaling 238 km. The \nEIRR for the nine project roads averaged 17.3%, ranging from 13.0% for the Harfari\u2013Khaira\u2013\nMisirgawan  Road  to  23.5%  for  the  Dharna\u2013Asta\u2013Dondiwada\u2013Dharmakua  Road.  Overall, \nsample roads have an EIRR that satisfies the economic viability criteria of 12%. The sensitivity \nof the EIRR for the sample project roads together was analyzed with respect to changes in the \nbenefit and cost streams. The following sensitivity cases were examined: (i) construction costs \nincreased  by  10%,  (ii)  vehicle  operating  cost  and  travel  time  savings  reduced  by  10%, \n(iii) construction costs increased by 10% and vehicle operating cost and travel time savings \nreduced by 10%, (iv) a 2-year delay in road construction, (v) road maintenance costs increased \nby 100% in the project case, and (vi) value of time decreased by 20%. The results highlight the \nrobust economic viability of the sample roads in all sensitivity tests. All selected roads have an \nEIRR above 12% in all sensitivity tests, except for the Harfari\u2013Khaira\u2013Misirgawan Road under \nscenario (iii) for which the EIRR is 11.3%. The traffic growth rate in rural Madhya Pradesh is \nlikely to significantly exceed the normal traffic growth scenario considered because of generated \ntraffic and conservative growth assumptions. In addition to quantified benefits of maintenance \nsavings, vehicle operating costs savings, and time savings, the project road improvements will \nalso accelerate the economic growth of the rural areas of the state, which otherwise suffer from \npoor  connectivity.  The population  connected  through  project roads  will  benefit from  easier \naccess to social, health, and education facilities.18 \n \n19.  Financial sustainability. The state Public Works Department's budget allocation for \nmaintenance doubled from FY2010 to FY2015, and is expected to grow in line with the state's \ngross  domestic  product.  Current  allocations  for  maintenance  cover  about  80%  of  the \nrequirements, including the project incremental recurrent costs. The State Road Development \nPlan  has  introduced  measures  to  improve  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  road  network. \nMPRDC is separately piloting an operate\u2013maintain\u2013transfer system, with a concession period of \n7\u201310 years, to provide some toll revenue to support road maintenance. For the project roads, \nthe  use  of  concrete  pavements  and  inclusion  of  maintenance  element  for  5  years  from \ncompletion of construction will improve asset construction quality as well as maintenance. \n \n                                                \n18 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nC.  Governance \n20.  Institutional capacity. The executing agency, MPRDC, is wholly owned by the State \nGovernment  of  Madhya  Pradesh.  Its  board  includes  the  highest  levels  of  political  and \nadministrative officers in the state. MPRDC has been the implementing agency for four previous \nADB loans and is familiar with ADB procedures and has strong institutional capacity. In addition \nto its headquarters in Bhopal, MPRDC has many divisional offices across the state and also \nmanages many public\u2013private partnership projects. \n  \n21.  Financial  management. An assessment of MPRDC\u2019s accounting systems, financial \nreporting, and external audit procedures, has concluded that MPRDC has adequate capacity in \nproject  financial  accounting  and  ADB  disbursement  procedures  because  of  its  significant \nexperience with ADB-funded projects. MPRDC follows double-entry, accrual-based accounting \nand  prepares  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  the  accounting  standards  of  India. \nMPRDC  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records  by  funding  source  for  all \nexpenditures incurred on the project. Project accounts will follow accounting principles and \npractices prescribed by the accounting laws and regulations of the Government of India. An \ninternal audit is carried out by a firm of chartered accountants appointed by MPRDC.  An \nexternal audit is conducted by independent auditors from the panel appointed by the comptroller \nand auditor general in accordance with auditing standards issued by the Government of India. \nThe overall financial management risk is assessed as low.19 \n \n22.

MPRDC  has  extensive  experience  in  procurement  and  consultant \nrecruitment for ADB projects, as well as in the use of various forms of public\u2013private partnership \nfor  road  projects.  Goods  and  works  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). All civil works will be procured through \ninternational competitive bidding. All consulting firms will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) using quality- and \ncost-based  selection,  with  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20  as  agreed  with  the  Government. \nProcurement  actions for  18  works  contracts  packages  are  already  ongoing;  the remaining \npackages  will  be  bid  out  by  the  fourth  quarter  of  2016.  Recruitment  of  the  supervision \nconsultants  for  the  three  construction  supervision  consultant  packages  has  begun  and \nshortlisting was completed as part of advance action. The procurement plan for the project is in \nthe PAM.20 \n \n23.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the Government of India and MPRDC. Specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n24.  Madhya Pradesh is one of the less developed states with a human development index of \n0.375, which is below the national average.21 Agriculture is the main sector in the local economy. \nA social impact assessment involving 1,926 households found that poor road conditions were \npreventing safe and reliable travel, especially during the rainy season. Better roads will increase \nnew  economic  and  job  opportunities  by  improving  links  to  commercial  facilities.

Access to public and social service facilities (such as \ngovernment agencies, health centers, and schools) will also be enhanced. Project beneficiaries \ninclude local residents, road users, businesses, commercial services, and government workers. \nThe project roads cover 19 districts in the state where about 30.1 million people live. The \nbidding documents include provisions for the civil works contracts to comply with core labor \nstandards. Details are in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy.22  \n \n25.  Gender. During the social study, 21 focus group discussions were held with women only. \nThe  discussions  revealed  that  women  are  not  actively  engaged  in  family  and  community \ndecision-making processes. Women indicated that poor road conditions were preventing safe \nand reliable travel. Improved road conditions are expected to provide better access to health \nservices, higher levels of education, and social interactions, as well as better public and private \ntransport options. Gender-sensitive features include (i) integrating safety and other features for \nthe elderly, women, children, and people with disabilities into road design, such as well-marked \ncrossings,  raised  pedestrian  walkways,  hard  shoulders,  soft  shoulders,  or  covered  drains \ndepending on the available right-of-way and local needs; (ii) giving preference to local women \nand vulnerable households for road maintenance jobs during the 5-year maintenance period, \nwhich is estimated to generate about 136 person-years of employment, and ensuring that \nprovisions for equal wages for equal work by male and female skilled and unskilled labor in \nproject works are in the bidding documents; (iii) providing training to all maintenance workers; \n(iv) collecting sex-disaggregated data and pedestrian data for the cashless accident victim \ntreatment facility being developed; and (v) collecting sex-disaggregated data and improving \npublic awareness targeting rural communities for the accident response system. \n \n26.  HIV/AIDS. Adult HIV prevalence in India was 0.27% in 2011. New infections declined by \n57% from 2000 to 2011, and AIDS-related deaths dropped  by 29% from 2007 to 2011.23 \nAccording to India\u2019s National AIDS Control Organisation, HIV infection is typically concentrated \namong the poor and marginalized groups (including such high-risk groups as sex workers, drug \nusers, migrant laborers, and truck drivers). Madhya Pradesh is a low-prevalence state. Based \non the poverty and social assessment, the project will not increase HIV/AIDS incidence as all \nimproved  roads  will  be  along  the  existing  corridor.  Contractors  will  carry  out  HIV/AIDS \nawareness for laborers at work sites, monitored by the CSCs.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n27.  Environmental impact. The project is categorized B for the environment, according to \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The scope of work under the sample subprojects \ninvolves improvement and maintenance of existing MDRs. Adequate rights-of-way is available \nfor  all  the  sample  subprojects,  and  no  significant,  long-term,  or  irreversible  environmental \nimpacts are expected. A consolidated initial environmental examination report, with contract \npackage-specific  EMPs,  has  been  prepared  for  the  nine  sample  subprojects  and  will  be \ndisclosed on the ADB website. For the sector project, an environmental assessment and review \nframework has been prepared to guide compliance with environment safeguard requirements \nunder the acts and policies of the Government of India and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \nNo category A subprojects will be financed under the project. Anticipated environmental impacts \nduring construction of the sample subprojects entail typical issues related to road construction, \n                                                \n22 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n23 Government of India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. 2011.

Potential  operational \nimpacts such as noise, pollution, and safety issues caused by increased traffic are expected to \nbe insignificant. Mitigation measures to address all construction- and operation-related impacts \nhave been included in the contract package-specific EMPs. The EMPs will form part of the \nbidding documents and be mandatory for implementation by the contractor. Consultations have \nbeen conducted with stakeholders and affected persons, during the project preparation stage, \nand their concerns have been incorporated in the initial environmental examination and EMP. A \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  has  been  established  to  continue  receiving  feedback  and \ncomplaints, if any, from affected parties and addressing them during construction and operation. \n \n28.  One environment safeguards officer will be assigned at the MPRDC and another one will \nbe  recruited  to  support  this  officer.  During  implementation,  each  of  the  10  project \nimplementation  units  of  MPRDC  will  have  an  environment  safeguard  focal  person.  During \ninception and preconstruction, ADB and the CSC will conduct initial workshops for MPRDC staff, \nother CSC staff, and the contractors. Additional training will be conducted during construction as \nnecessary.  \n \n29.  Involuntary resettlement. The project is categorized B for resettlement, according to \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The project uses the most feasible technical design to avoid \nland acquisition and involuntary resettlement. Roads will be improved within the existing right-of-\nway. The sample subprojects are representative of the kinds of impact likely to be encountered \nin non-sample roads. Stakeholders and affected persons were consulted during preparation of \nthe sample subprojects, and project information was disclosed. A resettlement plan has been \nprepared for the nine households that will experience temporary impacts to their livelihoods, \nduring  construction,  on  three  of the  sample  subprojects.  A  due  diligence  report  has  been \nprepared for the remaining six sample subprojects to verify that there will be no impact. For the \nsector project, a resettlement framework has been prepared in accordance with the acts and \npolicies of the Government of India and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The framework will \nguide the screening and planning for all subsequent subprojects. Displaced persons will be \ncompensated at replacement cost (rates for different categories of loss and special assistance \nare in the framework). If any changes, additional land requirements, or involuntary resettlement \nimpacts are identified during implementation, a resettlement plan will be prepared or updated. \nADB\u2019s prior approval will be obtained before further implementation of the relevant section of the \nsubproject. MPRDC has implemented five ADB projects since 2002 (footnotes 8 and 9). One \ndedicated staff in MPRDC will oversee the project; each of MPRDC\u2019s 10 project implementation \nunits will have a social safeguard focal person. During inception and preconstruction, ADB and \nthe CSC will conduct initial workshops for MPRDC staff, other CSC staff, and the contractors. \nAdditional training will be conducted during the construction stage as necessary. \n \n30.  Indigenous people. The project is categorized C for indigenous people, according to \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Madhya Pradesh has a significant tribal population, which \nconstitutes more than one-fifth of its total population. The state is home to 46 \u201cscheduled \ntribes.\u201d24 The tribal population is largely concentrated in and around the forest area. All project \nroads will be improved within the existing alignment and no new roads are being constructed. \nThe poverty and social assessment survey confirmed that the socioeconomic impacts will not \ndiffer between tribal groups and nontribal groups. No category A subprojects will be financed \n                                                \n24 Tribes or tribal communities recognized under the Constitution of India through applicable legislation. \n ", "10 \nunder the project. An indigenous peoples planning framework has been prepared to guide \nscreening of the impact of non-sample subprojects. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.25 The assessment indicates that the overall \nrisk is low considering the mitigation measures, and the integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs.  \n \nTable 5: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInitial delays in  MPRDC  has  prepared  the  detailed  design  for  the  nine  sample  roads  and  has  completed \nproject  safeguard-related surveys and reviews. Detailed project reports for the non-sample roads were \nimplementation  completed by August 2016. For sample roads, consultant recruitment for construction supervision \nis in progress. Procurement for works contracts started in June 2016. Project designs have been \nprepared to avoid land acquisition. However, because of the large number of non-sample roads, \nthe risk after mitigation is still medium. \nInadequate  Engineers  and  construction  supervision  consultants  will  be  engaged  for  quality  checks  in \nquality checking  accordance  with  contracts.  ADB  will  undertake  frequent  review  missions  to  ensure  timely \nand monitoring  undertaking  and  implementing  quality  of  contracts.  Ten  project  implementation  units  are \n  envisaged, distributed around the state near work sites. These units will be supported by three \nfirms of construction supervision consultants. The introduction of 5-year, performance-based \nmaintenance in works contracts will increase contractor accountability for construction quality. \nDespite these steps, quality control and checking will be best addressed by field staff. This is the \nfirst time that concrete pavements are being used on this scale on district roads. As the roads are \ndispersed geographically throughout the state, the level of risk after mitigation is still medium. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MPRDC = Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n32.  The Government of India, the State Government of Madhya Pradesh, and MPRDC have \nassured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies \nincluding  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement, \nconsulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \nThe  national  and  state  governments  and  the  MPRDC  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n33.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$350,000,000 to India for the Madhya Pradesh District Roads II Sector Project, from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n5 September 2016 \n                                                \n25 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nI mpact the Project Is aligned with: \nMobility and accessibility improved (Twelfth Five Year Plan)a \n \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By 2021     \nRoad transport  a.
