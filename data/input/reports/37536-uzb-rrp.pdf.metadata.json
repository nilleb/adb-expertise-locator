An initial environmental examination was undertaken. The summary \nis presented in Supplementary Appendix S. \n \nLand  degradation  is  a  serious  economic,  social,  and  environmental  problem  in \nUzbekistan  and  the  rest  of  Central  Asia.  It  directly  affects  the  livelihoods  of  the \nrural  population  by  reducing  land  productivity,  and  by  causing  agricultural \nproduction losses estimated at $2 billion a year for the region.  \n \nThe Project will address the rapidly worsening and expanding land degradation in \nnine  districts  in  Bukhara,  Kashkadarya,  and  Navoi  provinces.  The  project  area, \ncovering  162,300  hectares  (ha)  of  irrigated  land,  suffers  from  increased  soil \nsalinity  and  shallow  groundwater  table\u2014the  most  serious  forms  of  land \ndegradation.  Crop  yields  in  these  areas  reportedly  have  declined  by  30%  since \n1991.  These  problems  are  caused  by  (i)  poor  water  management,  (ii) \ndeteriorating  irrigation  and  drainage  (I&D)  infrastructure,  and  (iii)  a  policy \nenvironment  that  constrains  production  growth  and  reduces  incentives  to  invest \nin  land  improvement.  Worsening  land  degradation  directly  affects  a  rural \npopulation of 1.4 million in the project districts. \n \nTo  help  the  Government  halt  and  reverse  land  degradation,  the  Project  will  (i) \ndevelop  and  disseminate  improved  land  reclamation  practices  adapted  to  local \nconditions;  (ii)  strengthen  institutions  to  address  land  degradation  issues  at \ncentral,  provincial,  and  community  levels;  and  (iii)  improve  land  and  water \nmanagement  infrastructure  to  enhance  water  control  and  efficiency.  Through \nagreed policy reforms, the Project also will help to increase farmers\u2019 incentives to \nraise land productivity and invest in land, as well as improve rural governance.  \n  \nAgriculture  remains  the  major  source  of  livelihood  for  rural  communities,  which \nare  home  to  60%  of  the  population,  and  is  critical  to  attaining  inclusive  and \nsustainable growth  for  the  economy.  The  Government  has  prioritized  improving \nagricultural  productivity,  particularly  maximizing  export  revenues  and  achieving \nfood  security.  However,  rapidly  worsening  land  degradation  is  threatening  the \nperformance of the agriculture sector.  \n \nThe  proposed  Project  would  target  areas  that  experience  the  most  severe  land \ndegradation in Uzbekistan. The Project design harnesses the experience of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  lessons  gained  from  relevant  land \nmanagement  and  agriculture  projects  in  Uzbekistan,  the  subregion,  and \nelsewhere. \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  Project  is  based  on  the  premise,  derived  from  ADB  experience  and \nsupported  by  the  Government,  that  an  enabling  policy  environment  that \npromotes  and  encourages  farmers\u2019  incentives  is  needed  to  support  sustainable \nland  management.  This  is  the  principle  behind  the  ongoing  agriculture  sector \nreform initiative, spearheaded by ADB and the World Bank, which focuses on (i) \nreducing  the  mandatory  state  procurement  quota  on  cotton  and  wheat;  (ii) \nimproving  pricing;  (iii)  ensuring  timely  payments  to  farmers;  and  (iv)  liberalizing \nmarketing of these commodities, thereby ensuring greater freedom and improved \nprofitability  of  producers.  This  approach  will  be  extended  and  deepened  in  the \nproject  districts,  enabling  farmers  to  benefit  directly  from  increased  crop \nproduction  and  to  develop  the  financial  capacity  to  invest  in  land  improvement. \nThe Project also recognizes that incentives to look after their farmland must go \nhand  in  hand  with  improved  and  more  secure  access  to  land.  Additionally, \ninstitutions  responsible  for  land  management  must  be  strengthened  and  their \ncapacity  developed,  including  their  knowledge  and  skills  to  implement  custom \nsolutions  to  the  worsening  land  degradation.  Land  and  water  management \ninfrastructure, which has deteriorated seriously since independence in 1991, also \nmust  be  improved  through  cost-effective  investments,  taking  into  account  the \nneed for sustained operation and management in the future. \n \nThe  Project  builds  on  the  agriculture  sector  reform  initiatives  that  ADB  has \nmaintained  in  Uzbekistan  since  its  first  project  in  2002.  It  will  help  Uzbekistan \naddress  its  land  degradation  problems  in  a  multipronged  manner,  covering \nincentives,  institutions,  and  infrastructure.  Through  cofinancing  with  the  Global \nEnvironment  Facility  (GEF),  the  Project  also  aims  to  allow  long-term  planning \nand  implementation  of  corrective  interventions  to  prevent  and  control  land \ndegradation beyond the project area. \n \nThe expected impact of the Project is increased income of farmers in the project \narea. The project outcome would be improved quality and sustainable productivity \nof land, leading to higher crop yields and enhanced ecological sustainability in the \nproject areas.  \n \nThe intended outcome will be produced through investments to rehabilitate land \nand  water  infrastructure,  as  well  as  the  application  of  improved  land  and  water \nmanagement  practices.  These  will  be  carried  out  in  an  enabling  policy  and \ninstitutional environment, which hinges on five key reforms: (i) increased freedom \non  farming  decisions  (reduced  state  procurement  quota),  (ii)  fair  and  improved \npricing  of  state-procured  commodities,  (iii)  timely  payments  to  farmers,  (iv) \nliberalized  markets,  and  (v)  secure  access  to  land.  The  intended  aims  of  these \nreforms  are  clarified  in  the  Assurances  section,  and  the  specific  measures  are \nincorporated in the Project and the associated technical assistance (TA) to help \nthe  Government  implement  the  reforms.  In  addition,  the  capacity  of  the \ninstitutions responsible for the reforms and the farmers, the ultimate beneficiaries \nand caretakers of land and water resources, will be developed.  \n \nThe  Project  comprises  (i)  land  and  agricultural  improvements  that  will  promote \nthe  dissemination  of  appropriately  designed  land  reclamation  and  agronomic \npractices, as well as modern farm business management; (ii) capacity building for \n\nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nland  and  water  management  institutions,  which  will  strengthen  the  ability  at  the \ncentral,  provincial,  and  community  levels  to  introduce  integrated  land  and  water \nresources  management,  upgrade  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  practices, \nsupport  water  users\u2019  associations  (WUA),  and  involve  beneficiary  farmers  in \nplanning and construction supervision of on-farm works; (iii) rehabilitation of land \nmanagement infrastructure of main and on-farm systems to ensure efficient land \nand  water  management,  and  equitable  delivery  of  irrigation  water  to  individual \nprivate  farms;  and  (iv)  project  management  that  will  establish  project  offices,  as \nwell  as  units  for  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  social  and  environmental \nperformance. A GEF grant ($3.0 million) is proposed to promote innovative land \nmanagement,  enhance  the  replicability  of  the  Project,  and  generate  additional \nglobal environmental benefits. If GEF financing is not confirmed, only the project \nactivities  financed  by  the  two  ADB  loans,  as  described  above,  will  be \nimplemented. \n \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $76.18  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of \n$11.59 million.  \n \nADB will provide a blend of two loans to finance the Project: (i) a loan for $32.6 \nmillion  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR),  and  (ii)  a  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR 18,515,000 ($27.6 million) from the Special Funds \n(SF) resources. The OCR loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \nof  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.75%  per  year,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the OCR  loan \nagreement. A portion of the OCR loan not exceeding $16.7 million will be used to \nfinance  on-farm  I&D  rehabilitation  works,  and  the  costs  will  be  recovered  fully \nfrom the beneficiary farmers through WUAs. The loan from the SF resources will \nhave a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of \n1.0%  per  year  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  year  thereafter,  and  other \nterms and conditions set forth in the SF loan agreement. \n \nUntil 31 March 2013 \n\n \n30 September 2012 \n \n \n \nMinistry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) \n\n \nThe Project will be implemented over 6 years, starting in October 2006. A high-\nlevel  project  steering  committee,  with  a  deputy  prime  minister  as  chairman,  will \nprovide policy guidance. The deputy minister of water resources in MAWR will be \ndesignated  as  project  director  with  overall \nfor  project \nimplementation.  A  project  management  office  (PMO)  will  be  established  within \nMAWR to manage project activities, and to liaise with ADB and the coordinating \nbodies. Project implementation units (PIU) will be established in each of the three \nproject provinces to implement the Project. \n\nresponsibility \n\n \n\n \n\n \nProject \nInvestment Plan  \n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated \nProject \nCompletion Date \n\nExecuting \nAgency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting \nServices \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n\n(ii) land  and  water  management  methodologies; \n\nA full-time project manager will administer and manage the PMO, while a project \nsite  manager  will  oversee  each  PIU.  The  Government  will  nominate  the  project \nmanager,  who  will  be  endorsed  by  ADB.  A  panel  of  experts  appointed  by  the \nGovernment will select the project site managers and key staff based on merit.  \n \nThe  Project  will  procure  machinery,  equipment,  civil  works,  services,  vehicles, \noffice  equipment,  and  materials.  All  procurement  will  be  undertaken \nin \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines.  \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  131  person-months  of  international  consulting  services \nand 857 person-months of domestic consulting services in (i) institutional capacity \nbuilding; \n(iii)  design, \nprocurement,  and  construction  supervision;  and  (iv)  project  management, \nmonitoring,  and  evaluation.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with \nthe  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  Asian  Development  Bank  and  its \nBorrowers, using the quality- and cost-based selection method. \n \nThe  main  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  are  expected  to  result  from  (i) \navoidance  of  production  losses  due  to  reduced  land  degradation  and  improved \nmanagement;  (ii) increased  cotton  and  wheat  yields  and  production,  resulting \nfrom  policy,  institutional,  and  technical  interventions;  and  (iii)  higher  and  more \nsustainable \nincentives  and  productivity \nfrom  production \nenhancements. The economic internal rate of return of the project investments is \nestimated at 21.5% with a net present value of $26.78 million, indicating positive \nreturns to the economy. An overall annual increase of 31,200 tons of cotton and \n13,800 tons of wheat is projected in the project areas. In response to local market \ndemand,  a  small  expansion  in  fodder  crops,  vegetables,  and  fruit  also  is \nexpected,  and  will  increase  slightly  the  cropping  intensity  on  private  farms.  In \naddition,  project  interventions  will  halt  further  land  degradation  in  the  area, \nestimated at 13,000 ha over the next 15 years.  \n \nAfter  project  implementation,  household  incomes  in  the  project  area  will  rise  by \n15%  in  Kashkadarya,  23%  in  Navoi,  and  30%  in  Bukhara.  In-kind  consumption \ngrowth  will  average  10\u201315%  in  the  project  area.  At  project  completion, \nproductivity growth and higher income and consumption of poor households will \nreduce  poverty  incidence  (i)  from  37.3%  to  35%  in  Kashkadarya  Province,  (ii) \nfrom 28.3% to 24.2% in Navoi Province, and (iii) from 27.3% to 22.5% in Bukhara \nProvince.  Further,  an  analysis  of  the  policy  reforms  associated  with  the  Project, \nusing  a  policy  analysis  matrix  approach,  indicates  a  positive  impact  on  exports \nand Government revenues. \n \n\nincomes \n\nfarmer \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nvii\n\nIn  particular, \n\nThe  Project  aims  to  achieve  enduring  behavior  changes\u2014in  addressing  land \ndegradation and implementing agriculture sector reforms\u2014at all levels, including \nin  national  and  local  governments,  and  among  beneficiaries.  To  achieve  and \nsustain such changes, the Government\u2019s strong commitment and political will are \nessential.  The  Government  has  demonstrated  its  commitment  to  implementing \nagriculture sector reforms slowly, but consistently. Despite some initial delays, the \nGovernment  has  raised  production  incentives  gradually  through  (i)  accelerated \nfarm privatization, (ii) decreased net transfers from agriculture, (iii) reduced state \nprocurement quotas, (iv) higher procurement prices, and (v) gradual liberalization \nof  the  cotton  trade.  It  also  has  developed  a  new  simplified  tax  code  for \nagriculture.  Therefore,  the  risk  that  the  Government  might  turn  away  from  its \ncommitment to reforming the agriculture sector and addressing land degradation \nin a comprehensive manner is considered low. \n \nADB and World Bank continue to collaborate closely in monitoring and assessing \nthe  progress  of  reforms.  Alongside  the  Project,  the  associated  TA  will  help  the \nGovernment and stakeholders to assess the progress, outcomes and impacts of \nthe \nreforms.  This  will  promote  awareness  and  understanding  among \nstakeholders,  thereby  building  alliances  that  will  support  and  advocate  enduring \nbehavior changes.  \n \nInstitutions  with  adequate  capacity  and  legal  authorities  also  must  support  the \nintended  behavior  changes. \nfor \nsustainable  land  management  must  be  provided  with  clear  mandates  and \nenhanced  capacity.  The  Project  recognizes  the  risk  of  falling  short  in  delivering \nthe  intended  results  due  to  institutional  weaknesses.  Accordingly,  it  aims  to \ndevelop \ninstitutional \nstrengthening  activities,  notably  for  water  sector  institutions,  WUAs,  and  land \nmanagement  institutions.  The  proposed  Project  and  associated  TA  will  build  on \nthe  progress  from  these  activities,  while  the  proposed  GEF  grant  will  support \nnational level planning and institutional strengthening. \n \nOne  potential  risk  involves  the  inadequate  maintenance  of  the  rehabilitated  I&D \nschemes due to the lack of financial resources and/or technical skills. The Project \naddresses this risk in two ways. First, it will select, through systematic screening \nand  consultation  with  stakeholders,  schemes  with  low  O&M  costs.  Second,  the \nProject  will  help  develop  participatory  design,  implementation,  and  O&M  of  the \nselected schemes through WUAs, utilizing the extensive experience of the ADB-\nfinanced  Ak  Altin  Agricultural  Development  Project  in  WUA  development  and \ntraining,  in  close  collaboration  with  other  funding  agencies.  The  reform  agenda \nthat  will  be  implemented  under  the  Project  also  will  support  institutional \nstrengthening of MAWR and WUAs, and raise farmers\u2019 incomes to enable them \nto invest in sustainable water management and improved O&M. \n \nAs  for  project  implementation  risks,  the  proposed  Executing  Agency  has  been \nimplementing \nthree  ADB  projects,  and  has  demonstrated  adequate \nimplementation  capacity.  The  scope  and  nature  of  physical  works  under  the \nProject  are  also  generally  simple.  Thus,  the  risk  of  the  Project  encountering \nimplementation delays and difficulties is considered low. \n \n\ninstitutions  based  on  several  ongoing  ADB-assisted \n\ninstitutions  responsible \n\nthe \n\n \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fviii \n\nTechnical \nAssistance \n \n\n \n\n \n\nreforms; \n\nthe  agreed \n\nimplementing \n\nformulating,  prioritizing,  and \n\nA TA entitled Implementation and Monitoring of Policy Reforms in the Agriculture \nSector will be provided to assist the Government at central and provincial levels in \n(i) \n(ii) \nstrengthening  the  relevant  institutions;  (iii)  preparing  legislation  to  reverse  the \nconstraints  on  agricultural  productivity  and  rural  incomes;  (iv)  monitoring  the \nimplementation  of  reforms  and  their  impact  on  farm  incomes,  rural  poverty,  and \nGovernment revenues; and (v) planning the expansion of sector reforms.  \n \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,000,000  equivalent,  of  which  $800,000  will  be \nfinanced  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  ($200,000)  and  the  Poverty  Reduction \nCooperation  Fund  administered  by  ADB  ($600,000)  on  a  grant  basis.  The \nGovernment  will  finance  the  remaining  $200,000  by  providing  offices,  logistical \nsupport, and counterpart staff. The Ministry of Economy will be the TA Executing \nAgency.

\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Land Improvement Project. The report also describes the \nproposed technical assistance (TA) for implementation and monitoring of policy reforms in the \nagriculture sector. If the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approves the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by Board, will approve the TA.1  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \n2. \nAt  the  request  of  the  Government  of  Uzbekistan,  ADB  approved  a  TA  to  prepare  the \nLand  Improvement  Project.  The  TA  was  carried  out  from  January  to  August  2005.  This \ndocument  is  based  on  the  consultants\u2019  studies,  surveys,  and  reports;  the  findings  of  ADB \nmissions; and discussions with government agencies, stakeholders, and beneficiaries. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nUzbekistan  is  a  low-income  country  with  gross  national  income  per  person  of  $420  in \n2003. The Government estimates that Uzbekistan's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 4.2% in \n2002, 4.4% in 2003, and 7.7% in 2004. During 2000\u20132004, agriculture accounted for about 29% \nof GDP, 25% of export earnings, and 33% of the national employment. About 15 million people, \nor 60% of the population of 25.6 million, live in rural areas and depend solely on agriculture for \ntheir livelihoods. Cotton, which dominated the country\u2019s agriculture sector during the Soviet era, \ncontinues to do so, though to a lesser extent. The country is the world\u2019s sixth largest producer of \ncotton,  which  remains  a  major  source  of  export  and  tax  revenues.  Since  independence,  the \nGovernment has promoted wheat production, and wheat self-sufficiency was achieved in 1997.  \n \n4. \nThe agriculture sector continues to be an important source of income for the economy. \nGovernment policy consistently has aimed to (i) maximize agriculture exports; (ii) achieve food \nsecurity  and  self-sufficiency  in  wheat;  and  (iii)  redistribute  revenues  from  agriculture  to  other \nsectors,  such  as  health,  industry,  and  infrastructure.  The  transfers  from  the  agriculture  sector \nare made possible by a policy framework that gives the Government control over the production \nand marketing of cotton and wheat through planning, foreign exchange and trade controls, and \ndirected credits.2 State procurement contracts (quotas) are set, subsidized credit and inputs are \nprovided to finance cotton and wheat production, and farmers are required to sell 50% of their \noutput  to  the  Government  at  fixed  prices  below  international  prices.  Since  2002,  the \nGovernment  has  undertaken  sector  reforms  (paras.  10\u201311)  with  the  support  of  international \ndevelopment partners, including ADB (paras. 15\u201317). \n \n5. \nIrrigation is vital to agriculture in Uzbekistan, which has an arid climate. The expansion \nof irrigated areas started in the 1950s, when huge schemes were constructed to irrigate semi-\ndesert  areas.  Many  people  from  densely  populated  parts  of  the  country  were  mobilized  to \nsupport the development of these schemes, as well as agro-processing industries. An excessive \namount  of  water  was  taken  from  the  Amu  Darya  and  Syr  Darya  rivers  for  this  large-scale \nirrigation  program,  with  little  attention  to  efficient  use  of  the  water.  This  contributed  to  soil \nsalinization,  land  degradation,  and  the  Aral  Sea  environmental  disaster.  Since  independence, \nfarm  restructuring  and  the  emergence  of  private  farms  have  presented  new  challenges  to \n\n                                                 \n1   The project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2004.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  Agriculture  Sector  Review  Planning  Project. \nManila.  The  TA  reviewed  the  performance  of  the  sector,  taxation,  transfers,  and  subsidies.  The  World  Bank\u2019s \nsector work (para. 17) estimated the net transfers from the cotton subsector at 1.4% of GDP in 2004.   \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nirrigated agriculture. These have included the need for institutions, operation and maintenance \n(O&M)  procedures,  and  water  control  and  distribution  structures  to  provide  adequate  and \nefficient water supplies to thousands of small private farms.  \n \nThe  farming  community  is  organized  into  three  main  producer  types:  (i)  shirkats \n6. \n(cooperative  farms),  (ii)  private  farms,  and  (iii)  dekhan  farms.3 Under  the  large  Soviet  state \nfarms,  workers  received  a  fixed  wage.  With  the  collapse  of  the  former  Soviet  Union,  the \nGovernment  started  transforming  these  farms  into  enterprises  that  could  manage  their  land \nbetter.  During  the  1990s,  1,100  state  farms  and  940  collective  farms4 were  reorganized  into \nsmaller  cooperative  farms  (shirkats),  where  workers  hold  a  share  of  the  farm  assets.  Shirkats \nhave performed poorly, with many incurring substantial financial losses. In 1997, private farms \nreceived  independent  jurisdictional  status.  As  farm  privatization  accelerated,  125,000  private \nfarms  cultivating  2.9  million  hectares  (ha)  were  established  in  2004.  Under  the  Government's \nreform program, farm privatization is scheduled for completion by 2007. The number of dekhan \nfarms also has increased from 2.3 million in 1991 to 4.3 million in 2004. Dekhan farms produce \n17% of the country\u2019s grains and most of it fruits and vegetables, while providing cash income for \nthe  rural  population.  Land  use  rights  of  dekhan  farms  are  clearly  established  (e.g.,  long-term \nlease and free cropping patterns). However, the land use rights of private farms are linked to the \nfulfillment  of  state  procurement  quotas  for  cotton  and  wheat,  and  often  do  not  reflect  the  land \nquality  and  farm  infrastructure.  Land  use  contracts  are  rarely  registered,  allowing  local \nauthorities to evict farmers if they do not fulfill state quotas. These factors limit land use security \nand investment in land improvement, and are disincentive for farmers and rural business.  \n \n7. \nOverall,  the  performance  of  the  agriculture  sector  has  fallen  short  of  its  potential. \nAgriculture output dropped 16% from 1990 to 1996, though it has grown modestly since and has \nrebounded  to  1990  levels. 5 The  poor  productivity  in  the  sector  is  reflected  in  low  irrigation \nefficiency,  extensive  land  degradation,  and  low  yields.  The  average  withdrawal  of  irrigation \nwater per hectare is 14,000 cubic meter (m3), compared with 9,000\u201310,000 m3/ha in countries \nwith similar climate.6 The heavy water usage has not translated into high yields, as the average \nyields\u20142.25  tons  (t)/ha  for  cotton  and  4.2  t/ha  for  wheat\u2014are  low.  More  than  60%  of  water \ndiverted  for  irrigation  fails  to  reach  the  fields,  overloading  the  drainage  network  with  water \nlosses. The Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) estimates that about 20,000 \nha  of  irrigable  land  are  abandoned  each  year  due  to  the  progressive  failure  of  the  drainage \nsystems, rise in soil salinity, and land degradation, as well as declining crop yields.  \n \n8. \nAgriculture sector policies, such as mandatory production targets and state control of the \nproduction  system,  are  also  among  the  underlying  causes  for  deteriorating  land  and  water \nresources.  As  farmers  are  forced  to  adhere  to  short-term  production  targets,  inadequate \nattention  is  paid  to  farm-level  investments  for  increasing  longer-term  productivity.  Land \ndegradation  causes  an estimated  $31  million in  annual crop  production  losses  in Uzbekistan.7 \nMoreover,  salinization  and  land  degradation  have  been  recognized  as  key  environmental \nproblems.  The  most  adverse  impact  of  land  degradation  is  being  experienced  in  Navoi, \nBukhara, and Kashkadarya provinces, and in the Fergana Valley.  \n \n\n                                                 \n3  Dekhan farms are small inheritable households plots (0.15\u20130.35 ha) free in crop selection and marketing. \n4  State  farms  (sovkhoz)  are  state-operated  agricultural  estates  specialized  for  large-scale  production.  Collective \n\nfarms (kolkhoz) are large cooperative agricultural enterprises operated on state-owned land. \n\n5  World Bank. 2003. Country Economic Memorandum. Washington, DC. \n6  World Bank. 2000. Republic of Uzbekistan Irrigation and Drainage Sector Study. Washington, DC. \n7  The Central Asia Scientific-Research Institute for Irrigation estimates that cotton yields decline 20\u201330% on slightly \n\nsalinized land, 40\u201360% on moderately salinized land, and up to 80% on severely salinized land. \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n3\n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nreforms  since  2001.  At \n\nKey  Constraints.  Sector8 and  farm  problems  are  reflected  in  (i)  low  productivity  and \n9. \nreturns  from  cotton  and  wheat  production,  (ii)  limited  crop  diversification,  and  (iii)  continuing \ndeterioration of land and water. At the same time, mandatory production targets for cotton and \nwheat,  the  involvement  of  local  governments  in  private  farming  production  and  financing,  and \nbelow-market procurement prices are major disincentives for private farmers to increase yields, \ndiversify  cropping  patterns,  and  improve  farm  management.  This  also  highlights  the  need  for \nlocal  governments  to  transform  from  enforcers  of  the  state-dominated  procurement  system  to \nfacilitators of a new market-based agriculture system, in line with the Government\u2019s agriculture \nsector strategy. Thus, technical solutions for land improvement will be ineffective unless critical \nissues of agriculture policy and local governance are addressed. \n \n10. \nGovernment Strategy. The Government has taken a gradual approach to the transition \nto a market economy, relying on state intervention and state planning. Although this approach \nhas  succeeded  in  avoiding  the  economic  collapse  that  has  befallen  other  former  Soviet \nrepublics,  it  has  created  economic  distortions.  Recognizing  these  distortions,  the  Government \nhas  undertaken  significant  macroeconomic  and  sector \nthe \nmacroeconomic  level,  the  exchange  rate  was  devalued  in  2003.  At  the  microeconomic  level, \nstate  procurement  quotas  for  cotton  and  wheat  have  decreased  from  70%  to  50%  of  the  total \nproduction since 2002. A further reduction of quotas from 50% to 25% is applied to ADB- and \nWorld  Bank-financed  projects.  Procurement  prices  are  being  increased  gradually.  The  cotton \nprocurement  price  was  increased  from  $50/t  in  2000  to  $224/t  in  2005, 9  while  wheat \nprocurement  prices  have  been  aligned  with  the  prices  in  Central  Asia.  In  March  2003, \nPresidential Decree No. 3226 established a framework for the development of private farming, \nand  reduction  of  the  Government\u2019s  control  over  agriculture,  promotion  of  market  principles  in \ninput  supply  and  output  marketing.  Since  2005,  farmers  have  been  allowed  to  sell  cotton \nexceeding  the  state  quota  to  foreign  traders,  or  to  the  Government  at  a  20%  premium  to  the \nprocurement  price.  The  Uzbekistan  Commodity  Exchange  was  established  in  2004,  providing \nan alternative marketing outlet. \n \n11. \nA  new  simplified  tax  code  for  agriculture  is  being  developed,  and  an  improved  land \ntaxation  mechanism  is  being  pilot  tested. 10 Combined  with  the  currency  devaluation,  these \nmeasures reduced implicit cotton taxation from 66% in 2000 to 31% in 2004.11 The centralized \nginning  system  has  been  restructured,  while  flour  mills,  grain  warehouses,  and  fertilizer \ndistribution centers are being privatized. Still, private investment and ownership have been slow \nto take root. The Government also has started replacing subsidized state credit with commercial \nbank  lending.  However,  the  farmers\u2019  lack  of  collateral,  because  their  land  leasehold  rights  are \nambiguous and are rarely accepted by banks for loan guarantees, has hampered this process.  \n \nDespite  these  policy  improvements,  implementation  of  some  reform  measures  at  the \n12. \nlocal level is slow. State institutions continue to be present throughout the sector's value chain. \nMoreover,  local  governments  still  control  farm  production,  provision  of  inputs  and  credit, \nmarketing of outputs, and monitoring of quota targets. Continued subsidies of farm inputs and \ncredit lead to inefficiencies and the diversion of inputs into the black market. However, the policy \ndialogue with the Government is yielding results. The Government accepts the need to deepen \nreforms  and  improve  incentives,  though  close  monitoring  of  policy  implementation  at  the  local \n                                                 \n8  Summary agriculture and water sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n9  Since 2002, prices are adjusted annually, using formulae established by the Government, ADB, World Bank, and \n\nInternational Monetary Fund. These are outlined in Presidential Decree No. 3114 of 20 August 2002. \n\n10  In Tashkent, Samarkand, and Surkhandarya provinces, the tax rate declined from 23% in 1999 to 14.6% in 2003. \n11  World Bank. 2005. Cotton Taxation in Uzbekistan: Opportunities for Reform. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nlevel is needed to ensure that incentives to improve land and water management are in place. \nThese  issues  will  be  addressed  under  the  agreed  reform  agenda,  and  monitored  through  the \ngrant-financed TA (para. 43). \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  funding  of  O&M  for  irrigation  and  drainage  (I&D)  infrastructure  has \n13. \nfallen dramatically since independence, accelerating the deterioration of the system.12 Pumping \nof  water  for  irrigation  consumes  about  20%  of  electricity  generated  in  Uzbekistan  and  70%  of \nthe Government budget for the sector. As a result, little money is left for I&D rehabilitation and \nmodernization. Due to the lack of incentives to conserve water and improve land management \npractices,  overuse of water\u2014with the consequent water logging and soil salinity\u2014affects more \nthan  47%  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  irrigated  area. 13  Overuse  of  chemicals  exacerbates  poor  soil \nconditions.  Rehabilitation  of  I&D  infrastructure  and  better  water  management  are  needed \nurgently to arrest the expanding land degradation and conserve water.  \n \n14. \nTo  address  water  management  constraints,  the  Government  is  moving  towards  a \ndecentralized  administration  of  water  resources.  Basin  irrigation  system  authorities  (BISA), \nbased  on  hydrological  boundaries,  have  been  established  to  rationalize  water  allocation.  In \naddition,  water  users  associations  (WUA)  are  being  established  rapidly,  and  responsibility  for \non-farm O&M is being transferred to these groups. A commitment has been made to introduce \nwater user charges to ensure funding of O&M of I&D systems.14 Water delivery fees are being \ninstituted  on  a  trial  basis,  and  bulk  water  charges  are  to  be  implemented  in  2006.  However, \nsince BISAs and WUAs do not have adequate expertise and resources to deliver the services \nneeded, further capacity building is required.  \n \nExternal  Assistance. 15 ADB,  a  major  supporter  of  sector  development,  is  financing \n15. \nthree ongoing projects designed to address low farm productivity, low farm incomes, and poor \nsector  growth.  The  Ak  Altin  Agricultural  Development  Project16 is  aimed  at  strengthening  rural \ninstitutions  to  support  private  farming  (e.g.,  rural  business  advisory  centers  and  WUAs),  and \nrehabilitating  irrigation  infrastructure.  The  Grain  Productivity  Improvement  Project 17 supports \ncapacity  building  of  institutions  in  wheat  breeding  and  research,  adoption  of  new  varieties, \nprivate  sector  development  in  input  supply,  improved  farming  practices,  and  environmentally \nsafe pest control. The Amu Zang Irrigation Rehabilitation Project18 finances the rehabilitation of \na pumping cascade, irrigation infrastructure, improved irrigation management, and development \nof private farms. These projects also support the implementation of sector policy reforms by pilot \ntesting and replicating reduced procurement quotas for cotton and wheat.  \n \nThe  Agriculture  Sector  Review  and  Planning  TA19 helped  the  Government  assess  the \n16. \ntaxes  imposed  on  the  cotton  subsector,  and  identify  key  strategic  directions  for  sustainable \nagricultural  development.  Another  TA 20  focused  on  an  integrated  cadastre  system  for  land \n                                                 \n12  In 2004, only 3.4% of the country\u2019s annual investments were in agriculture.  \n13  ADB. 2003.

ADB financed the TA for Combating Desertification in Asia,21 \nwhich assessed land degradation issues in Central Asia. ADB also financed the preparation of \nthe  Central  Asian  Countries  Initiative  for  Land  Management  (CACILM),22 which  supports  the \ndevelopment  and \nfor \ncomprehensive  and  integrated  approaches  to  sustainable  land  management  to  combat  land \ndegradation. The Uzbekistan National Working Group established under CACILM prepared the \nNPF,  which  outlines  the  Program  for  Sustainable  Land  Management,  and  includes  activities \nfinanced by this Project and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) (para. 27). \n  \n17. \nThe  World  Bank\u2019s  assistance  combines  physical  investments,  policy  reforms,  and \ninstitutional development. The Cotton Sub-sector Improvement Project23 pilot tested reforms in \nthe cotton subsector (e.g., lowering procurement quotas and establishing alternative marketing \nchannels);  the  Rural  Enterprise  Support  Project24 aims  to  improve  farm  productivity;  and  the \nDrainage, Irrigation and Wetland Improvement Project25 supports a reduction of drainage flows \ninto the Amu Darya River. The World Bank carried out recent sector study26 that complements \nADB's  sector  work.  This  study  argues  that  cotton  production  is  over-taxed,  creating \ndisincentives  for  farmers.  Further,  the  World  Bank  study  suggested  (i)  abolishing  the \ncompulsory  quotas  patterns,  (ii)  eliminating  the  ginning  monopoly;  and  (iii)  liberalizing  cotton \nmarketing.  The  European  Union  (EU)  supports  integrated  water  management,  and  is  pilot \ntesting land registration. United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provides \nassistance  in  water  management  and  farmers\u2019  business  training.  Food  and  Agriculture \nOrganization (FAO) is supporting the introduction of salt-tolerant crops and minimum tillage.  \n \n18. \nLessons.  Implementation  of  the  ADB-financed  Ak  Altin  Project  has  confirmed  farmers\u2019 \npositive  response  to  quota  reduction.  The  cotton  yield  within  the  project  area  grew  by  29% \nbetween  2004  and  2005,  exceeding  the  growth  rate  of  20%  in  adjacent  areas.  Likewise, \nincomes  of  farmers  within  the  project  area  were  15%  higher  than  those  in  neighboring  areas. \nThese  results  can  be  attributed  to  the  enhanced  incentives  available,  as  the  project\u2019s \ninfrastructure is not yet rehabilitated. However, farmers still wait up to 6 months for full payment \nfor  their  cotton,27 and  they  are  not  yet  selling  their  above  quota  cotton  to  other  buyers.  While \nthese initial difficulties point to the need to include the local authorities in the reform process, the \npositive outcomes in the Ak Altin area already are changing the mindset of the Government. \n \n19. \nLand  degradation  control  often  has  emphasized  top-down  engineering  solutions.  This \napproach typically has not involved participation of stakeholders, or attacked the root causes of \nthe  problem.  The  experience  of  ADB  and  other  development  agencies  throughout  the  region \nindicates that sustainable land management must (i) apply customized techniques that meet the \nspecific needs and capacities of the affected population in a flexible way; (ii) provide adequate \nprice  incentives,  free  of  government  intervention,  to  achieve  higher  farm  incomes  and  ensure \nsustainable  land  and  water  management;  and  (iii)  create  an  institutional  environment\u2014in  the \nform of land and water management, and land tenure arrangements\u2014that reinforce incentives \nfor  sustainable  land  management  based  on  market  principles.  The  most  crucial  lesson  is  to \nensure  the  creation  of  an  enabling  policy  environment  that  supports  enduring  changes  in  the \nbehavior  of  stakeholders  responsible  for  land  degradation. This  requirement  is  strongly  tied  to \n                                                 \n21  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance for Combating Desertification in Asia.

Further,  the \nWorld  Bank  experience  demonstrates  that  adequate  TA  grants  are  needed  to  support  project \nimplementation.  Initial  delays  in  implementing  reforms  on  the  ongoing  ADB  and  World  Bank \nprojects also suggest that sufficient resources need to be allocated for capacity building of local \ninstitutions, monitoring of the implementation of reforms, and raising public awareness. \n \n21. \nThese lessons have been incorporated in the project design: (i) analysis of the impact of \nthe  policy  initiatives  on  yields,  incomes,  and  revenues  has  been  prepared  and  discussed  with \nthe Government as part of extensive police dialogue; (ii) a geographically focused project has \nbeen  designed,  coupling  priority  policy  reforms  with  physical  interventions  to  achieve  tangible \noutcomes;  (iii)  support  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  institutions  at  the  provincial  and  district \nlevels,  as  well  as  of  private  farmers  and  WUAs,  has  been  incorporated;  and  (iv)  project \nperformance will be closely monitored and supervised based on clear indicators. To adequately \nfund these activities, TA- and GEF-financed grants (through CACILM) have been provided.   \n \n22. \nRationale.  Agriculture  remains  the  main  source  of  livelihood  for  rural  communities, \nwhich make up 60% of the population, and is critical to the inclusive and sustainable growth of \nthe Uzbekistan economy. Rapidly worsening land degradation is threatening the performance of \nthe agriculture sector and the livelihoods of a large proportion of the rural population. Given the \nimportance of the sector, the Government aims to increase farm productivity. However, unless \nthe depletion of the production base is reversed and land and water management are improved, \nthis goal will not be achieved. The design of the proposed Project, which focuses on the areas \nthat  experience  the  most  severe  land  degradation  in  Uzbekistan,  fully  reflects  the  experience \nand  lessons  gained  from  ADB\u2019s  past  and  ongoing  operations.  Such  lessons  suggest  that \nenabling  policies  that  promote  and  encourage  farmers\u2019  incentives  are  needed  to  support \nsustainable  land  management.  In  Uzbekistan,  these  policies  include  (i)  increased  freedom  on \nfarming decisions (i.e., reduced state procurement quota), (ii) fair and improved pricing of state-\nprocured commodities, (iii) timely payments to farmers, (iv) liberalized markets, and (v) secure \naccess to land. Reforms to production, pricing, and marketing have been undertaken since 2002 \nunder  ongoing  agriculture  sector  reforms  supported  by  ADB  and  World  Bank.  The  proposed \nProject  will  build  on,  expand,  and  deepen  these  reforms\u2014particularly  by  incorporating  a  new \ninitiative for improving access to land\u2014as clarified in the assurances (para. 62). Moreover, the \nProject will take specific actions to achieve good governance in agricultural production and land \nmanagement. Other experiences also indicate that institutions responsible for land management \nmust have the ability to design and implement custom solutions to land degradation. The Project \nincorporates these lessons through a strong policy agenda for improved land tenure (para. 25), \nas well as institutional strengthening to improve rural governance. Based on these lessons, the \nProject  will  bring  in  the  necessary  investments  to  rehabilitate  seriously  deteriorated  land  and \nwater  management  infrastructure  cost-effectively  taking  into  account  the  need  for  future \nsustained  O&M.  The  Project  also  aims  to  develop  long-term  planning  and  interventions  to \n\n                                                 \n28  World Bank. 2002.

ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  (2006\u20132010)  in  Uzbekistan29 recognizes  that \n23. \nthe key constraints to agricultural productivity include the state procurement system, and heavy \nintervention in inputs supply and marketing. It also recognizes the need to strengthen property \nrights,  market,  land,  and  water  management  institutions;  and  to  maintain  the  physical  state  of \nland  and  water  infrastructure.  By  focusing  on  rural  development,  ADB  can  help  Uzbekistan \nincome  opportunities,  and  environmental \nenhance  rural  governance,  employment  and \nsustainability,  thereby  contributing  to  a  reduction  in  rural  poverty.  The  country  strategy  and \nprogram\u2019s  four  strategic  priorities  are  (i)  accelerating  environmentally  sustainable  rural \ndevelopment through improved land and water management, agricultural productivity, and land \nadministration reform; (ii) supporting the private sector; (iii) promoting regional cooperation; and \n(iv)  building  human  capital.  Within  each  of  these  areas,  a  core  set  of  governance  and \ninstitutional outcomes are to be pursued. The Project is closely aligned with this strategy, as it \nfocuses on key land, water management, and environmental issues; as well as reforms to raise \nproduction incentives and improve rural governance. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\nA. \n \n24. \nThe  project  area  covers  162,300  ha  in  nine  districts:  Kamashi,  Guzar,  and  Kasan  in \nKashkadarya; Kyzyltepa, Khatirchi, and Navbakhor in Navoi; and Jandor, Bukhara, and Romitan \nin  Bukhara.  The  districts  were  selected  through  systematic  screening  and  stakeholder \nconsultation, based on the following criteria: (i) availability of irrigation water; (ii) high risk of land \ndegradation  without  interventions;  (iii)  high  potential  for  restoring  land  capability;  (iv)  low \ninvestment and O&M costs; (v) large number of poor households; and (vi) existence of relevant \nrural  organizations.  The  expected  impact  of  the  Project  is  increased  income  of  farmers  in  the \nproject  area.  The  project  outcome  would  be  improved  quality  and  sustainable  productivity  of \nland, leading to higher crop yields and enhanced ecological sustainability in the project areas. \n \nB. \n \n25. \nTo ensure this outcome, the loan and accompanying TA grant are designed to produce \npolicy, technical, and institutional changes. The outputs are (i) an enabling policy environment \nthat  supports  incentives  for  sustainable  land  management  (para.  22),  (ii)  improved  land  and \nwater management practices, (iii) strengthened capacity of water management institutions, (iv) \nrehabilitated \ninfrastructure,  and  (v)  operational  and  effective  project \nmanagement  and  monitoring  systems.  While  the  TA  focuses  on  the  implementation  and \nmonitoring of policy reforms, the Project will carry out the following: \n \n\nland  and  water \n\nOutputs \n\n(i) \n\nReform  initiatives  will  be  implemented  in  the  project  district,  introducing  (a) \nincreased  freedom  on  farm  decisions:  state  procurement  quota  for  cotton  and \nwheat  in  the  project  districts  will  be  reduced  to  25%  of  the  long-term  average \nproduction,  and  greater  freedom  on  cropping  patterns  will  be  allowed;  (b)  price \nreform:  the  procurement  prices  for  raw  cotton  and  wheat  will  reflect  changes  in \ninternational prices, inflation, and market-based exchange rates, and farmers will \nbe entitled to sell production exceeding their quota at their discretion; (c) payment \nreform:  farmers  will  receive  final  payment  for  raw  cotton  after  crop  delivery;  (d) \n\n                                                 \n29  ADB. 2006.

Manila \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n(ii)  \n\ninvolved \n\nto  ensure \n\ninstitutions  with \n\nmarket liberalization: farmers will be allowed to sell above-quota cotton and other \nnon-quota  produce  freely;  and  (e)  land  access  reform:  the  land  use  lease \ncontracts  between  the  Government  and  the  farmers  will  be  improved  to  ensure \nprotection from cancellations without legal process, and will be eligible for use as \ncollateral to access loans from commercial banks. \nLand  and  agricultural  improvements  will  introduce  improved  land  reclamation \npractices  and  on-farm  water  management.  The  Project  will  establish  three \ndemonstration  farms  to  promote  innovative  on-farm  technologies  (e.g.,  leveling, \nsubsoiling,  etc.),  and  to  demonstrate  enhanced  agronomic  practices  (e.g.,  crop \nrotations  and  minimum  tillage  to  reduce  inputs  and  increase  soil  fertility,  and \nintegrated  pest  management).  Local  scientific \nrelevant \nexperience  will  be \nthe  ownership,  replication,  and \nsustainability  of  these  operations. 30 The  loan  consultants  will  supplement  the \ncapacity  of  the  scientific  institutions.  These  improvement  practices,  initially \nimplemented  through  the  scientific  institutions,  will  be  scaled-up  with  the \nincreased involvement of the private sector, and financed through the GEF grant.  \n(iii)   Capacity of land and water management institutions, particularly BISAs, MAWR, \nand  WUAs,  will  be  strengthened  through  (a)  development  of  efficient  O&M \nprocedures  and  market-based  irrigation  delivery  fees,  (b)  adoption  of  an \nintegrated water management, and (c) financial and management training.  \n(iv)   Land  management  infrastructure  will  be  rehabilitated,  including  rehabilitation  of \non-farm  canals  and  drains  for  improved  land  and  water  management,  and \nequitable delivery of irrigation water to individual private farms, including 15,175 \nha in Navoi, 21,460 ha in Bukhara, and 24,150 ha in Kashkadarya. The cost of \non-farm  improvements  will  be  recovered  from  the  beneficiaries.  In  addition,  the \nmain  drainage  collectors  will  be  rehabilitated,  including  330  kilometers  (km)  in \nNavoi,  640  km  in  Bukhara,  and  500  km  in  Kashkadarya,  covering  an  area  of \n162,300  ha.  Rehabilitation  of  drainage  and  irrigation  structures  for  improved \nwater control and efficiency will be prioritized. \n\n(v)   Project  management  will  comprise  the  establishment  of  project  offices  and \nperformance monitoring and evaluation units, surveys, and water and soil quality \nmonitoring. A project management office (PMO) will be established at MAWR to \nmanage project activities. Three project implementation units (PIU) will be set up \nin Navoi, Bukhara, and Kashkadarya to implement the Project in their areas, and \nto maintain liaison with local and beneficiary organizations. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \nC. \n \n26. \nThe Project represents a shift in ADB\u2019s sector assistance from irrigation rehabilitation to \na comprehensive improvement in land and water management, focusing on the worsening and \nexpanding  land  degradation.  To  do  this,  the  Project  expands  and  deepens  the  ongoing, \nprogrammatic  approach  to  agriculture  sector  reforms  implemented  under  the  ADB-financed \nprojects  in  the  sector.  In  addition,  it  will  also  establish  a  supportive  policy  and  institutional \nframework  for  sustainable  land  management,  including  enhanced  security  of  land  tenure  and \nfarmers\u2019  access  to  commercial  credit.  To  help  the  Government  implement  these  reforms,  an \nassociated TA will provide expertise and resources to enhance local institutions\u2019 capacity, and \nto  monitor  the  reform  progress  (para.  43).  These  reforms  ensure  increased  freedom  in  farm \ndecisions  (i.e.,  what  to  grow  and  where  to  sell),  fair  and  timely  payments  of  state-procured \ncommodities,  and  secured  access  to  land  use  rights\u2014all  according  to  the  transparent  and \n\n                                                 \n30  The Tashkent Institute of Irrigation and Melioration and the Cotton Research Institute have agreed to participate. \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n9\n\npredictable  rule  of  good  local  governance.  The  Project\u2019s  contribution  to  achieving  good  local \ngovernance,  particularly  in  restricting  official  and  unofficial  interventions  of  local  authorities  in \nfarm management decisions, reflects the CSP\u2019s recognition of governance risks associated with \nlocal governments. Further, it is in line with the recommendations of ADB\u2019s Country Assistance \nProgram Evaluation for Uzbekistan for strategic approach to governance issues.31 \n \n27. \nA  grant  from  GEF  Operational  Program  15  on  Sustainable  Land  Management  is \nproposed  to  enhance  the  project  impact  at  national  and  subregional  levels.  ADB  submitted  a \nrequest  for  grant  financing  ($3.0  million)  to  the  GEF  Council  to  finance  additional  activities  to \nensure sustainable ecological productivity in the project area. If approved, ADB will administer \nthe  GEF  grant,  according  to  GEF-ADB  agreement,  to  promote  modern  land  management, \nenhance project replicability, and generate additional global environmental benefits. The GEF-\nfinanced  activities  will  (i)  address  regulatory  conditions  for  improved  land  management;  (ii) \nfoster  coordination  among  line  agencies  to  ensure  an  integrated,  participatory  approach  to \nproject  activities;  (iii)  involve  all  stakeholders  in  planning,  implementing,  and  monitoring  of \nsustainable land management; (iv) pilot test innovative technical systems and public and private \npartnerships;  and  (v)  include  monitoring  and  evaluation  to  increase  the  replicability  of  the \nProject. The GEF Council will review the proposal in June 2006. If approved, GEF financing will \nbegin  in  2007  and  will be  implemented  over  4  years.  If  GEF  does  not  approve  financing,  only \nthe project activities financed by the two ADB loans (para. 25) will be implemented. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n28. \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $76.18  million,  including  $11.59  million  for  taxes  and \nduties,  $8.60  million  for  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  $5.06  million  in  estimated \nfinancial charges during implementation. The project cost estimates are summarized in Table 1, \nwhile  the  detailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  detailed  cost  estimates  by \nfinancier are provided in Appendix 4 and Supplementary Appendix O. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmountsa \n\n1.

Manila.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nE. \n \n29. \nThe Government has requested a blend of two loans to finance the Project: (i) a loan of \n$32.6 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR), and (ii) a loan in various currencies \nequivalent to SDR 18,515,000 from the Special Funds (SF) resources.  \n \n30. \nThe OCR loan will finance a portion of the cost of the on-farm I&D rehabilitation works \nand  other  project  activities,  such  as  land  and  water  management  improvement,  institutional \nstrengthening,  and  project  management.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per year, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement (ordinary operations). A portion \nof the OCR loan not exceeding $16.7 million will be used to finance on-farm I&D rehabilitation \nworks,  and  will  be  recovered  from  the  beneficiary  farmers  through  WUAs  (para.  34).  The \nGovernment  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n31. \nThe  SF  loan  will  be  utilized  solely  to  finance  the  cost  of  the  main  and  inter-farm \nrehabilitation works. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, \nan  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  year  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  year  thereafter,  and \nother terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement (special operations).The beneficiaries \nalso will contribute $0.39 million towards the cost of the demonstration farms. The Government \nwill  finance  the  remainder  of  the  project  cost,  estimated  at  $15.58  million,  including  $11.59 \nmillion for taxes and duties. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \n \n\nSource \nA.  Asian Development Bank \n      1.  Ordinary Capital Resources \n      2.

MAWR will be the project Executing Agency. A high-level project steering committee will \nbe  established  and  meet  quarterly  to  provide  policy  guidance.  The  deputy  minister  of  water \nresources  in  MAWR  will  be  designated  as  project  director  with  responsibility  for  project \nimplementation. A PMO will be established within MAWR to manage project activities and liaise \nwith  ADB.  PIUs  will  be set  up  to  handle  project  implementation  in  the  three  project  provinces, \nand to liaise with local administrations and beneficiaries. A full-time manager will lead the PMO, \nwhile a site manager will oversee each PIU. The Government will nominate the PMO manager, \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n11\n\nwho will be endorsed by ADB. A panel of experts appointed by the Government will select the \nkey  staff  based  on  merit.  The  management  organization  chart  is  in  Appendix  8.  The  National \nWomen\u2019s  Committee  will  be  represented  in  the  PMO  to  implement  the  Gender  Action  Plan \n(GAP) presented in Appendix 13. A financial management assessment was undertaken during \nproject  preparation,  indicating  that  the  MAWR  has  satisfactory  management  capability  and \nsystems  for  financial  and  accounting  management,  reporting,  auditing,  and  internal  controls. \nThe financial management assessment of MAWR is in Supplementary Appendix R.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n33. \nThe Project will be implemented over 6 years, starting in October 2006. Project activities \nduring the first year will focus on fielding consultants, procuring equipment, and establishing the \nPMO and PIUs. Surveys, investigations, and preparation of designs and bidding documents will \nstart within 6 months of project implementation. In parallel, participatory community consultation \nwith  stakeholders  will  determine \nthe  scope  of  on-farm  rehabilitation  and  agricultural \ninterventions.  The  results  will  be  collated  in  the  design  processes.  The  project  civil  works  will \nbegin 24 months after the start. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n\n3. \n\nCost Recovery \n\n \nA  portion  of  the  OCR  loan  not  exceeding  $16.7  million  will  be  used  to  finance  on-farm \n34. \nI&D rehabilitation works, and will be recovered from the beneficiary farmers. Before beginning \non-farm civil works, the PMO, WUAs, and farmers jointly will review and agree on the scope and \ncosts of the rehabilitation works. Further, the WUAs and farmers will enter into agreements with \nthe  PMO  (on  behalf  of  the  Government),  indicating  their  approval  of  the  scope  of  works,  cost \nestimates,  and  readiness  to  recover  the  costs.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  these \nagreements are prepared and executed in a form and substance satisfactory to ADB. The PMO \nwill  maintain  the  records  on  the  selection  and  approval  of  the  agreements  for  ADB's  review. \nADB  will  pay  the  civil  works  contractors  directly.  A  commercial  bank  designated  by  the \nBorrower, and acceptable to ADB, will collect payments through the WUAs and deposit them in \na  special  account.32 The  average  rehabilitation  cost  is  estimated  at  $350/ha  or  $7,000/farm \nequivalent,  and  the  terms  of  repayment  will  be  decided  on  case-by-case  basis  during \nimplementation in consultation with farmers.  In  general,  repayments  will be  made  for  up  to  25 \nyears, including a grace period of 5 years, with the maximum interest of 8% per year, subject to \nchanges to be agreed upon during the midterm review of the Project.33 A financial analysis of a \ntypical  size farm  confirmed  that  farmers  will  have  the  capacity  to  repay.  The  proposed  flow  of \nfunds is in Supplementary Appendix T. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nGoods,  related  services,  and  civil  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n35. \nProcurement Guidelines. Major contracts for equipment costing $1,000,000 equivalent or more \nwill  be  awarded  through  ADB\u2019s  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB).  Contracts  estimated  at \nless  than  $1,000,000  will  be  awarded  using  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Shopping  will  be  allowed  for  contracts  valued  at  $100,000  equivalent  or \nless. The Executing Agency will certify to ADB that the goods and services financed by the loan \nare procured from ADB member countries. For works contracts costing less than $50,000, ADB \nmight agree to force account procedures, provided that MAWR can implement these works at a \n\n                                                 \n32  For these services, an administrative fee of up to 1.5% per year will be paid to the designated bank. \n33  The maximum repayment period of 25 years is based on the economic life of the Project, while the 5-year grace \n\nperiod takes into account the duration of construction and the benefits\u2019 built-up period. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nreasonable  cost.  ADB  must  approve  in  advance  the  awarding  of  all  contracts  and  substantial \ncontract variations. The procurement plan is in Appendix 7.  \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n36. \nThe Project will provide 131 person-months of international consulting services and 857 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  in  the  following  areas:  (i) land  and  water \nmanagement;  (ii) institutional  capacity  building;  (iii) design,  procurement,  and  construction \nsupervision; and (iv) project management, monitoring, and evaluation. At the start of the Project, \nMAWR and ADB will reassess the required inputs, based on the refined project schedule. The \nconsulting  services  will  be  provided  by  an  international  firm,  in  association  with  domestic \nconsultants  or  a  domestic  firm.  MAWR  will  engage  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers, using full \ntechnical proposals and quality- and cost-based selection. 34  \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n37. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loans  will  be  disbursed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook.  For  consulting  services,  civil  works,  and  equipment  following  ICB \nprocedures, loan funds will be disbursed directly. For civil works following NCB procedures and \nsmall expenditures related to the PMO and PIUs, reimbursement and imprest fund procedures \nwill be applied. After loan effectiveness, the PMO will open imprest accounts for each loan in a \ncommercial bank in Uzbekistan acceptable to ADB. The combined initial deposit to the imprest \naccounts will not exceed the estimated expenditures for 6 months of project implementation, or \n10%  of  both  loans,  whichever  is  lower.  ADB's  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  may  be \nused  to  reimburse  advances  made  into  the  imprest  account  for  eligible  expenditures,  with \nindividual payments amounting to $100,000 or less. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n38.  MAWR will maintain separate project accounts and financial statements, in accordance \nwith the provisions of the Loan Agreement, the recommendations of the financial management \nassessment  (FMA),  and  the  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of \nInvestment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB.  Further,  MAWR  will  have  them  audited  annually  by \nindependent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  MAWR  will  submit  to  ADB  certified  copies  of  the \nannual audited project accounts and financial statements, as well as the auditor\u2019s report, which \nwill include a separate opinion on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditures, \nand  management  letter,  all  in  English,  within  6  months  of  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year  during \nproject  implementation.  MAWR  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  requirement  for  timely  submission  of \naudited project accounts and financial statements, and the suspension of disbursements of the \nADB loan if it fails to comply with this requirement.  \n \n39.  MAWR,  through  the  PMO,  will  submit  quarterly  and  annual  reports  to  ADB,  indicating \nprogress  made,  problems  encountered,  steps  taken  to  remedy  the  problems,  program  of \nactivities,  and  expected  progress  during  the  remaining  period.  The  reports  will  incorporate  the \nproject performance monitoring data and relevant financial data. MAWR also will provide reports \nand information on the Project, such as ADB may reasonably request, including environmental \nimpacts,  dialogue  with  beneficiaries,  and  related  social  issues.  Within  3  months  after  project \n\n                                                 \n34  The outline terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 9.  \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n13\n\ncompletion, MAWR will submit to ADB a project completion report with detailed information on \nproject implementation, use of the loan proceeds, and accomplishment of the project objectives.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n40. \nTo  monitor  the  progress  of  physical  works,  the  Project  provides  for  a  comprehensive \nsystem of M&E that will be established in accordance with ADB guidelines within 1 year of loan \neffectiveness.  An  M&E  unit  will  be  established  in  the  PMO  to  monitor  project  performance, \nincluding environmental, poverty, gender, and social impacts, as specified in the Summary Initial \nEnvironmental  Examination  (SIEE)  and  the  poverty,  social,  and  gender  assessment  (PSGA). \nThe assessment will be based on the monitoring indicators in the project framework (Appendix \n1). Sample surveys, conducted at project completion, will be compared with baseline data. For \nperiodic monitoring, key indicators will be confirmed at project inception, with data incorporated \ninto  the  system  focusing  on  outcomes,  efficiency,  profitability,  and  quality.  The  TA  associated \nwith the Project will monitor the implementation of policy reforms, and assess their impacts.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n41. \nThe Government and ADB will review project implementation at least once a year. After \n3  years  of  implementation,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  carry  out  a  midterm  review  of  the \nProject  to  identify  problems  and  assess  the  need  to  modify  the  project  scope,  as  well  as \nimplementation and financing arrangements. The parameters for assessing the implementation \nmilestones  will  include  (i)  implementation  status,  (ii)  design  and  construction  standards,  (iii) \nphysical  progress  and  disbursements,  (iv)  status  of  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  (v) \nachievement  of  the  Project\u2019s  objectives,  (vi)  progress  of  policy  reforms,  and  (vii)  need  for  any \nchanges  in  the  project  scope  to  achieve  project  impact.  On  completion,  the  Project  will  be \nevaluated according to the terms of reference agreed upon by the Government and ADB.   \n \n\n10. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n \n42. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained  to,  and  discussed  with,  the \nGovernment  and  Executing  Agency.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors, \nsuppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  Combating \ncorruption  is  part  of  broader  work  on  good  governance  and  capacity  building  that  forms  and \nimportant  element  of  the  Project.  It  is  intended  to  ensure  enduring  behavior  changes  of  local \nauthorities, and enable transparent and equitable distribution of farm profits to support farmers\u2019 \nincentives  for  improved  land  management.  Measures  to  improve  local  governance,  empower \nfarmers \nfarm  production  decisions,  and  combat  corruption  are \nincorporated in the project design. Supplemented by institutional capacity building, these policy \nreforms will be implemented in the project districts to increase farmer\u2019s independence, improve \nland tenure security, and limit the interference of local authorities in business decisions (paras. \n25\u201326).  At  the  project  level,  the  financial  management  capacity  of  the  Executing  Agency  has \nbeen  assessed  as  satisfactory  (para.  32).  A  stand-alone  PMO  will  manage  the  Project  to \nmitigate the risks associated with weaknesses in government systems, and project accounts will \nbe audited externally each year (paras. 38 and 63). The project civil works have been packaged \n\nindependent \n\nto  make \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\ninto large contracts to attract reputable contractors and will require ADB\u2019s approval before being \nawarded. Since direct involvement of the intended beneficiaries in procurement is recognized as \nan effective measure to combat corruption, the planning and construction supervision of the on-\nfarm I&D rehabilitation works (28% of the loan amount) will be carried out in close consultation \nwith the participating farmers and WUAs, and the beneficiaries will confirm their agreement with \nthe  scope  and  cost  of  these  works  before  contracts  are  awarded.  The  accompanying  TA  also \nprovides for close participatory monitoring of project implementation.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n43. \nA  TA  grant  will  support  the  Government  in  implementing  and  monitoring  the  agreed \npolicy  reforms  (para.  62.),  TA  impacts  are  accelerated  agriculture  sector  reforms  and \ndissemination of reform knowledge that can be replicated within Uzbekistan. The TA outputs are \n(i) reduced quotas, register land use contracts, and liberalize agricultural markets in the project \ndistricts;  (ii)  an  implementation  plan  for  reforms;  and  (iii)  monitoring  of  reform  implementation, \nand proposals to expand reform initiatives. The TA will have three components: (i) design of the \nimplementation  of  reforms;  (ii)  support  to  institutions  in  implementing  the  agreed  reforms;  and \n(iii)  a  participatory  system  for  monitoring  the  implementation  and  impact  of  reforms  on \nGovernment  revenues,  farm  profitability,  and  poverty  reduction.35 The  TA  also  will  carry  out \nextensive consultation campaigns to disseminate reform information.  \n \n44. \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,000,000  equivalent.  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  will \nprovide  a  grant  for  $200,000,  while  the  Poverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund  administered  by \nADB will finance $600,000. The Government  will finance the remaining $200,000 by providing \noffices and logistical support. The TA will be implemented over 24 months, starting in October \n2006. The Ministry of Economy will be the TA Executing Agency. The TA will require 14 person-\nmonths  of  international  consulting  services  and  36  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nservices.  ADB  will  recruit  the  TA consultants  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines on  the  Use of \nConsultants. Simplified technical proposals and ADB's quality- and cost-based selection system \nwill be used. The detailed TA description and cost estimates are in Appendix 10. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic and Financial Impact \n\n \nA. \n \n45. \nThe  main  economic  benefits  are  expected  from  (i)  the  avoidance  of  production  losses \nthat would have occurred without the Project due to further land degradation; (ii) higher cotton \nand  wheat  yields  resulting  from  the  implementation  of  proposed  technical,  institutional,  and \npolicy interventions; and (iii) increased and sustainable farmer incomes derived from incentive \nand  productivity  improvements.  The  economic  analysis  was  based  on  an  estimated  25-year \nproject life. The project economic internal rate of return, excluding the impact attributable to the \npolicy reforms, is estimated at 21.5% with a net present value of $26.78 million.  \n \n46. \nProject interventions will mitigate the gradual loss of production due to land degradation. \nFor  60,785  ha,  the  full  rehabilitation  of  I&D  infrastructure,  combined  with  improved  land  and \nwater  management,  would  increase  crop  yields  and  cropping  intensity.  Cotton  yields  are \nexpected  to  rise  from  2.6  tons/ha  to  3.4  tons/ha  in  Navoi,  from  1.8  tons/ha  to  2.8  tons/ha  in \nBukhara,  and  from  2.2  tons/ha  to  3.2  tons/ha  in  Kashkadarya.  Another  64,850  ha  will  benefit \nfrom the rehabilitation of only off-farm infrastructure, with cotton yields increasing by 10% and \n\n                                                 \n35 Including collection and analysis of gender-disaggregated data. \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n15\n\nEnvironmental Impact and Assessment \n\nwheat  yields  by  16%. For  private  farms,  net  farm  incomes  are  expected  to  rise  by  $4,120  per \nyear. The Project also will increase the net value of production of dekhan farms\u2014from 23% in \nNavoi  to  30%  in  Kashkadarya.  A  farm  budget  analysis  illustrates  that,  with  the  higher  crop \nproduction and a 25% quota reduction, farmers will be able to meet the full on-farm investment. \n \n47. \nAn  analysis  of  the  policy  reforms  under  the  Project  indicates  a  positive  impact  on \nfarmers  and  the  Government.  Without  the  Project  and  reforms,  private  profit  is  low  ($94/ha), \nsuggesting  a  lack  of  incentives  for  productivity  improvements.  With  the  Project,  private  profits \nwould  increase  significantly  ($435/ha)  due  to  a  25%  quota  reduction  and  higher  prices.  If \ncombined with productivity improvements from better land management, profits would increase \neven further. Higher profits are expected to increase farmers\u2019 investments in land improvement, \nraising productivity and revenues further. By adopting the 25% quota reduction and allowing a \ngreater  proportion  of  the  land  to  be  planted  with  cotton\u2014the  crop  with  the  comparative \nadvantage\u2014cotton  production  is  expected  to  increase  15%  in  the  area  and  the  Project\u2019s \nefficiency in earning foreign exchange is expected to improve. Government revenues from the \nproject  areas  are  forecast  to  increase  by  20%  due  to  the  sale  and  export  of  additional \nproduction, increased tax collection, and savings from lower production subsidies. \n \nB. \n \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE), 36  conducted  during  project  preparation, \n48. \nconfirms  that  the  Project  will  have  considerable  positive  environmental  impacts.  The \nrehabilitation  of  main  drains  will  have  a  direct  and  positive  impact  on  groundwater  tables.  In \naddition,  the  rehabilitation  of  on-farm  I&D  infrastructure  for  33,890  ha  will  increase  irrigation \nefficiency,  decrease  water  losses,  and  reduce  groundwater  levels.  These  improvements  will \nreduce waterlogging and soil salinity significantly, and improve soil quality. The Project will not \nincrease the use of river water. Instead, it will improve water use efficiency, thereby benefiting \ndownstream  users  by  increasing  stream  flows.  Better  agriculture  and  land  management \npractices also will improve stream flow quality. \n \n49. \nThe  project  area  does  not  include  any  national  parks,  or  environmental  or  cultural \nmonuments. The flora and fauna in the area, which has been cultivated for more than 25 years, \nhave  been  impacted  by  human  activity.  As  no  species  are  registered  on  the  Species  Survival \nCommission\u2019s  Red  List, 37  none  is  recognized  as  endangered.  The  current  flora  and  fauna \nappear to be adapted to the irrigated agricultural environment. Since the Project will not extend \nto new areas, negative impacts on flora and fauna are not expected. The only potential negative \nimpacts  identified  in  the  IEE  are  due  to  rehabilitation  works,  though  these  are  considered \ninsignificant.  Mitigation  measures,  environmental  management,  and  monitoring  have  been \nintegrated into the project design and costs. These include (i) stockpiling of spoil from drains; (ii) \ndisposal  of  waste  material  from  repairs;  and  (iii)  provision  of  suitable  locations  for  contractors\u2019 \ncamps, which will meet national health, safety, and hygiene requirements. \n \nC. \n \nSocioeconomic  and  gender  analysis,  based  on  in-depth  interviews,  participatory  rural \n50. \nappraisal,  and  household  survey,  has  shown  that  the  Project  will  have  significant  positive \nimpacts  on  the  living  standards  of  the  rural  population.  Some  4,000  private  farms  and  about \n70,000 dekhan farms, established within the project area in the past 3\u20134 years, urgently need \nland improvements. Decreasing soil salinity and increasing soil fertility, as well as  building the \n                                                 \n36 The IEE is in Supplementary Appendix Q, while the summary SIEE is in Supplementary Appendix S. \n37 The list is in Supplementary Appendix Q. \n\nImpact on Living Standards \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\ncapacity  of  agricultural  service  providers  and  WUAs,  are  particularly  important.  About  85%  of \nthe  respondents  in  the  project  area  have  saline  land,  and  40%  have  land  affected  by  high \ngroundwater. Only 10% of private farmers believe that their land is in good condition. During the \nstudy,  farmers  reported  that  the  growth  of  farm  productivity  and  household  incomes  is \nconstrained  by  (i)  the  deteriorated  condition  of  I&D  systems,  (ii)  limited  access  to  credit  and \ninputs, and (iii) high leasing costs for machinery. As many as 97% of respondents indicated that \nland improvement is critical to raising their living standards. The Project also is expected to have \na significant impact on the women employed in the agriculture sector.  \n \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Reduction \n\n51. \nThe  household  survey  undertaken  during  project  preparation  showed  that  poverty \nincidence was similar in Navoi and Jandor district of Bukhara (28.3% and 27.3%, respectively), \nand  as  high  as  37.3%  in  Kashkadarya.  In  2004,  the  national  average  was  26.5%.  Average \nextreme poverty is 5% in the entire project area. Project households generate up to 70% of their \nincome  from  agriculture  and  in-kind  household  consumption  of  products  grown  on  household \nplots.  Most  of  the  poverty  determinants  are  related  to  agriculture,  and  are  explained  by  low \nincome  in  the  agriculture  sector.  This,  in  turn,  is  explained  by  policy  distortions,  deteriorated \nland conditions, and lack of resources and skills. \n  \nAfter  project  implementation,  household  incomes  will  increase  up  to  44.5%  in \n52. \nKashkadarya,  56.3%  in  Navoi,  and  71.3%  in  Bukhara.  Higher  incomes  of  private  and  dekhan \nfarms  will  increase  household  incomes  by  15%  in  Kashkadarya,  23%  in  Navoi,  and  30%  in \nJandor district of Bukhara. In-kind consumption growth will average 10\u201315% in the project area. \nIncome of poor households will increase by 16.0% in Kashkadarya, 12.5% in Navoi, and 18.0% \nin  Bukhara.  Productivity  growth,  combined  with  higher  income  and  consumption  of  poor \nhouseholds,  will  reduce  poverty  incidence  at  project  completion  (i)  from  37.3%  to  35.0%  in \nKashkadarya, (ii) from 28.3% to 24.2% in Navoi, and (iii) from 27.3% to 22.5% in Bukhara.  \n \n53. \nThe project impact on employment within the project area will be moderate (2%), due to \nthe low elasticity of demand for labor in the agriculture sector. Production intensification should \nincrease employment in household and dekhan plots. Employment is also expected to grow (by \n3\u20134%) among service providers, I&D maintenance enterprises, and the related segments of the \nlabor market (trading, services, handcraftsmanship, and agricultural production processing).  \n \n\n2. \n\nGender and Development \n\n54. \nDuring project preparation, a detailed PSGA was carried out (Appendix 11) and a Project \nParticipation  Plan  was  prepared  (Appendix  12).  Key  findings  of  the  gender  analysis  confirm \nwomen's  increasing  exclusion  from  the  farm  privatization  process.  Based  on  the  potential \ngender  impact  of  the  Project,  a  project-specific  GAP  will  promote  the  equal  participation  of  all \nstakeholders  as  project  beneficiaries.  Proposed  GAP  activities  aim  to  (i)  establish  quotas  for \nwomen's  representation  in  the  decision-making  processes,  model  farms,  and  WUAs;  (ii) \nintegrate  women's  needs  in  the  design  and  operation  of  project  infrastructure;  (iii)  establish \nquotas  for  the  participation  of  rural  women  farmers  in  training  activities;  and  (iv)  ensure  the \neffective  involvement  of  women  in  the  project  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  Women\u2019s \nCommittee of the Republic of Uzbekistan, which is represented in the PMO, will be involved in \nimplementing gender design features, and monitoring gender-relevant targets and indicators, in \ncollaboration with the Association of Women's NGOs.38 \n \n                                                 \n38 Established in 2003, the Association of Women's NGOs comprises of 53 local women\u2019s NGOs. \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n17\n\n3. \n\nRural Governance and Institutional Development \n\n55. \nThe  Project  will  link  the  physical  improvements  with  rural  governance  and  institutional \ndevelopment, and enhanced land security. The Project will introduce improved and transparent \nland  registration  procedures  and  contracts  to  enhance  farmers\u2019  security  of  land  tenure.  Rural \ninstitutions  to  be  developed  include  WUAs,  which  require  assistance  in  achieving  self-\nsustainability.  The  focus  of  their  development  will  be  on  improved  irrigation  management \nthrough  participatory  management  and  application.  Rural  women's  groups  also  need  to  be \ndeveloped  to  broaden  the  opportunities  for  women  to  participate  in  all  project  activities  at  the \nfield  and  management  level.  The  strongest  institutions  in  rural  areas  are  the  provincial  and \ndistrict  governors.  Their  support,  therefore,  is  essential  to  the  success  of  the  Project,  and  to \nimproved  rural  governance.  Through  the  TA  capacity  building  programs,  local  institutions\u2019 \nimplementing capacity will be enhanced to ensure their support for the Project.  \n \n\n4. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\nAll  rehabilitation  works  for  the  main  system  will  be  within  the  boundaries  of  existing \n56. \nstructures, or along existing canals and drains, which are within the Government\u2019s right-of-way. \nResults from field surveys and public consultations indicate that involuntary resettlement will not \nbe required for the main system works. The on-farm works include rehabilitation39 of minor on-\nfarm  structures  and  drains  on  leasehold  agricultural  land.  Participation  in  these  works  is \nvoluntary.  Farmers  and  WUAs  will  be  involved  in  the  design,  construction  quality  control,  and \nrelated activities of the on-farm rehabilitation program. On-farm construction will start only after \nindividual farmers have signed construction contracts.   \n \n\n5. \n\nImpact of the Project on Indigenous Peoples \n\nRisk Assessment  \n\n57. \nBased on the poverty and social assessment, no ethnic minority issues are anticipated in \nthe project areas. The ethnic composition is homogeneous, with Uzbeks accounting for 97.3% \nof the population in Kashkadarya and Navoi, and 99.5% in Bukhara. Project beneficiaries will be \ntreated  equally,  and  the  Project  will  reduce  rural  poverty  and  improve  incomes  of  all \nstakeholders. Therefore, the Project will not have any adverse impacts on indigenous peoples \nor ethnic minorities, and will not activate ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples.  \n \nD. \n \nPolicy  Reforms.  The  Project  aims  to  bring  about  the  enduring  changes  in  addressing \n58. \nland degradation and implementing agriculture sector reforms at all levels, including in national \nand  local  governments,  and  beneficiaries.  The  Government  has  demonstrated  its  commitment \nto  implementing  agriculture  sector  reforms  slowly,  but  consistently.  The  Government  gradually \nhas  raised  production  incentives  through  (i)  accelerated  farm  privatization,  (ii)  decreased  net \ntransfers from agriculture, (iii) reduced cotton and wheat procurement quotas, and (iv) gradual \nliberalization of the cotton trade. It has also developed a new simplified tax code for agriculture. \nTherefore, the risk that the Government might turn away from its commitment to reforming the \nagriculture  sector  and  addressing  land  degradation  in  a  comprehensive  manner  is  considered \nlow. ADB and the World Bank continue to collaborate closely in monitoring and assessing the \nprogress  of  reforms.  The  associated  TA  will  assess  the  outcomes  and  impacts  of  the  reforms \nand promote awareness and understanding among stakeholders.  \n \n\n                                                 \n39 The private farmers will decide whether their land needs improvements, and will select the type of on-farm works. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nInstitutions.  Institutions  with  adequate  capacity  and  legal  authority  must  support  the \n59. \nintended  behavior  changes.  In  particular,  the  institutions  responsible  for  sustainable  land \nmanagement  must  be  provided  with  clear  mandates  and  enhanced  capacity.  The  Project \nrecognizes  the  risk  of  falling  short  in  delivering  the  intended  results  due  to  institutional \nweaknesses.  Thus,  it  aims  to  develop  institutions  based  on  several  ongoing  ADB-assisted \ninstitutional  strengthening  activities,  notably  for  water  sector  institutions,  WUAs,  and  land \nmanagement  institutions.  The  proposed  Project  and  associated  TA  will  build  on  the  progress \nfrom  these  activities,  while  the  proposed  GEF  grant  will  support  national  level  planning  and \ninstitutional strengthening. \n \n60. \nProject Implementation. One potential risk involves the inadequate maintenance of the \nrehabilitated I&D schemes due to a lack of funds and technical skills. The Project addresses this \nin two ways: (i) schemes with low O&M costs have been selected through systematic screening \nand  consultation  with  stakeholders;  and  (ii)  the  Project  will  help  develop  participatory  design, \nimplementation, and O&M of the selected schemes through WUAs, utilizing the experience from \nthe ADB-financed Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project in WUA development and training, \nin close collaboration with other funding agencies. The reform agenda that will be implemented \nunder  the  Project  also  will  support  institutional  strengthening  of  MAWR  and  WUAs,  and  raise \nfarmers\u2019 incomes to enable them to invest in sustainable water management. \n \nOperation and Maintenance. There is discernable risk of the rehabilitated I&D schemes \n61. \nnot  being  maintained  adequately  due  to  the  lack  of  funds  and  technical  skills.  The  Project \naddresses  this  risk  by  (i) selecting,  through  systematic  screening  and  consultation,  schemes \nwith low O&M costs; and (ii) developing participatory design, implementation, and O&M of these \nschemes  through  WUAs  utilizing  the  experience  of  the  ADB  financed  Ak  Altin  Project  in  WUA \ndevelopment and training, in close collaboration with other funding agencies. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n62. \nhave been agreed with the Government: \n\nThe following conditions and assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents, \n\nfunds \n\ntimely  and  adequate  budgetary \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure \nfor \nmaintaining  the  normal  operation  of  the  project  I&D  systems,  and  will  continue \nproviding  capital  replacement  and  O&M  for  primary  and  secondary  canals  and \ndrains until the costs can be recovered from the beneficiaries. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  contractors  employed  under  the  Project  fully \ncomply  with  applicable  labor  laws  of  the  Government,  and  provide  adequate \nsafety  and  health  protection  of  workers  employed.  The  Government  will  ensure \nthat no minors will be employed for works financed with the proceeds of the loan, \nin compliance with the Government\u2019s legislation prohibiting child labor.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  within  6  months  from  the  beginning  of  project \nimplementation,  an  adequate  financing  and  accounting  control  system  will  be \nestablished  to  allow  the  PMO  and  the  PIUs  to  apply  international  accounting \nstandards  acceptable  to  ADB.  For  the  purpose  of  conducting  external  audit  of \naccounts,  the  loan  proceeds  may  be  used  to  finance  expenditure  for  private \nsector auditors and translation of auditors\u2019 reports into English, provided that (a) \nsuch auditors have qualifications, expertise, and terms of reference acceptable to \nADB; and (b) the recruitment process is acceptable to ADB. \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n19\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nfor \n\nits  responsibilities \n\nThe  Project  will  be  carried  out,  and  all  facilities  constructed,  operated, \nmaintained, and monitored, in accordance with the existing laws, regulations, and \nstandards  of  the  Government  concerning  environmental  protection,  and  ADB\u2019s \nenvironment policy; and the Government will ensure that MAWR implements the \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  requirements  as  outlined  in \nthe IEE. Further, the Government will assure that appropriate resources including \nbudgetary allocation are provided and the State Committee of Nature Protection \nfulfills \nimplementation  of  mitigation  measures  and \nmonitoring requirements, as outlined in the IEE. \nAll  civil  works  will  be  undertaken  on  Government  rights-of-way  and  no  persons \nwill be affected. In case that construction beyond the Government rights-of-way \nis  required  which  results  in  impacts  on  people,  the  Government  will  prepare  a \nresettlement plan based on detailed designs and in accordance with ADB's policy \non  involuntary  resettlement  policy.  The  plan  will  be  disclosed  to  all  affected \npersons  in  a  form  and  language  that  they  can  understand,  and  it  will  be \nsubmitted with the EA's endorsement to ADB for review and approval before any \ncivil works contract is awarded. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  GAP  is  implemented  in  a  timely  manner \nover the entire project period, and that adequate resources are allocated for this \npurpose. The GAP will aim at: (a) establishing quotas for women's representation \nin  the  decision-making  processes,  in  demonstration  farms,  and  WUAs;  (b) \nintegrating women's  needs  in  the  design  and  operation  of project infrastructure; \n(c)  establishing  targets  for  women  farmers'  participation  in  training;  and  (d) \nensuring  women's  effective  involvement  in  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the \nProject.  Implementation  of  the  GAP  will  be  closely  monitored,  and  the  progress \nreported in the quarterly reports to ADB.  \n\n(vii)  Commencing  from  the  cropping  season  of  2007,  the  Government  will  set  the \nmandatory state procurement quota for cotton and wheat in the project districts to \n25%  of  the  long-term  average  actual  production  achieved  during  2001\u20132005  to \nbe expressed in tons for each project district. Farmers will maintain their right to \nsell to the Government their over-quota production. \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Commencing  from  the  cropping  season  of  2007,  the  Government  shall  ensure \nthat  individual  farmers  in  the  project  districts  (a)  receive  final  payment  for  raw \ncotton after crop delivery, according to their contracts with the gins; and (b) are \nentitled to sell above-quota cotton at their discretion to any buyer in accordance \nwith the current legislation.  \nCommencing  from  the  2007  cropping  season,  the  procurement  prices  for  raw \ncotton and wheat and future price adjustments for these commodities will reflect \nchanges  in  international  border  prices,  inflation,  and  market-based  exchange \nrates.  For  raw  cotton,  the  procurement  price  will  be  in  accordance  with \nPresidential Decree No. UP/3114 of 20 August 2002 entitled \u201cThe mechanism for \nsetting-up procurement prices for cotton.\u201d \nCropping  patterns,  production,  marketing,  and  financial  activities  in  the  project \ndistricts will be carried out independently by the farmers (without interference of \nthe local authorities), and the sale of agriculture produce will be decided by the \nindividual  farmers,  pursuant  to  Presidential  Decree  No.  3226  of  24  March  2003 \nentitled \u201cOn the Most Important Directions of Deepening Agricultural Reforms.\u201d \nThe land use right lease between the Government and farmers in project districts \nwill  be  improved  and  registered  to ensure  protection  of  farmer\u2019s  land  use  rights \n(a)  from  outright  cancellations  of  these  contracts  and  eviction  from  farmland \nwithout  recourse  to  legal  process,  and  (b)  systems  of  fair  and  transparent \n\n(xi) \n\n(x) \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nwarnings  and  penalties  be  introduced  for  breaches  of  contract  conditions.  The \nGovernment shall ensure that the land lease contracts are inheritable and can be \nused as collateral to access loans from commercial banks, pursuant to the Land \nCode and the Central Bank Regulation No. 54 dated 10 January 2005.  \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n \nB. \n \n63. \nAs a condition for loan effectiveness, the Government will adopt resolutions confirming \nthat (i) the project-specific assurances stated in items vii to xi in para. 62 will be implemented, \nand (ii) the PMO has been established, including the appointment of manager and provision of \noffice and facilities. \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n64. \nthe ADB, and recommend that the Board approve  \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nthe loan of $32.6 million to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Land Improvement \nProject  from  ADB\u2019s  OCR,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term of 25 years, including a grace period \nof  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard; and \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR  18,515,000  to  the  Republic  of \nUzbekistan  for  the  Land  Improvement  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n30 June 2006  \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators \n\nSources and Reporting \nMechanisms \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\n \nDesign Summary \nImpact \n\n \n\nFarmers\u2019 incomes are \nincreased in nine \ndistricts in three \nprovinces of \nUzbekistan  \n \n\nPoverty incidence in the project \narea is reduced from 34.3% in \n2005 to 28.8% within 5 years \nof project completion \n\nAnnual net incomes on private \nfarms (30 ha) increase from \n$1,275 in 2005 to $2,900 within \n3 years of project completion \n\nAverage per capita income of \nhouseholds increases by 23% \nwithin 5 years of project \ncompletion \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOutcome \n\nAgricultural land quality \nand productivity in the \nproject area are \nimproved \n\nLand area with soil salinity \nand/or water logging decrease \nfrom 52,650 ha in 2005 to \n21,250 ha in 2011 \n\nCotton yields per ha increase \nfrom 2.0 t in 2005 to 3.0 t \nwithin 5 years of project \ncompletion \n\nWheat yields per ha increase \nfrom 2.0 t in 2005 to 3.5 t \nwithin 5 years of project \ncompletion \n\nAnnual soil and water \nquality monitoring by the \nState Hydro Geological \nMonitoring Expedition \n\n \n \nCotton and wheat quota \nreduction to 25% implemented \nin project area by 2007 \n\n \n \nGovernment resolution to \nimplement agreed \nreforms in project districts \n\nOutputs \n \n\n1.

The \nGovernment has adopted a gradual approach to this transition, with the state retaining a central \nrole  in  the  economic  life  of  the  country.  For  example,  the  introduction  of  structural  adjustment \nmeasures, including the privatization of state enterprises, has remained slow.  \n \n2. \nUzbekistan\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate increased from 4.2% in 2002 to \n4.4%  in  2003,  driven  by  a  robust  performance  of  the  agriculture  sector  and  a  rebound  of  the \ntrade sector,2 according to official estimates. The economic forecast for Uzbekistan shows that \nreal GDP growth might decline from 4.4% in 2005 to 4.0% (2006) and 3.9% (2007). In addition, \nprice trends for cotton, Uzbekistan\u2019s main export commodity, appear favorable in 2006\u20132007, as \na rundown of global stocks will lead to a gradual rise in prices. The textile sector\u2019s contribution \nto economic growth should increase, as new cotton processing facilities begin operations.3 \n \nB. \n\nSector Context \n\nContribution of the Agriculture Sector to the Economy. Agriculture is a key sector of \n3. \nthe economy, accounting for an estimated 29% of the GDP and about 25% of export earnings. \nThe  agriculture  sector  employs  up  to  33%  of  the  population.  Uzbekistan  is  the  world\u2019s  sixth \nlargest  cotton  producer,  and  more  than  80%  of  cotton  production  is  exported  as  raw  fiber. \nMoreover, agriculture is an important source of income for the rest of the economy, and annual \nnet  transfers  out  of  agriculture  are  significant.  These  transfers  are  made  possible  by  an \ninstitutional  and  policy  framework  that  gives  the  Government  control  over  the  production  and \nmarketing of the two major crops, cotton and wheat.  \n \n4. \nMain  Crops. Cotton and wheat are the two strategic crops. Cotton is grown on 41% of \nthe irrigated land, while wheat is cultivated on 42% of irrigated land. The Government imposes \nproduction  quotas  on  these  crops.  Other  crops  include  fodder  (9%  of  irrigated  land);  and \npotatoes, vegetables, and fruits (less than 8% of irrigated land).   \n \nLand  Resources. Uzbekistan has 44,410 million hectares (ha) of land resources.4 The \n5. \ncountry\u2019s physical geography can be divided into three zones: (i) desert (Kyzylkum), steppe, and \nsemi-arid  region,  covering  60%  of  the  country;  (ii)  fertile  valleys  (Ferghana  valley,  Samarkand \noasis),  which  border  the  Amu  Darya  and  Syr  Darya  rivers;  and  (iii)  mountainous  areas  in  the \neast,  with  peaks  4,500  meters  (m)  above  sea  level  (Tien  Shan  and  Gissaro-Alay  Ridges). \nUzbekistan\u2019s ability to maintain the economic potential of its land is increasingly threatened by \nsevere land degradation, resulting from (i) secondary salinization, (ii) waterlogging and flooding, \n(iii)  loss  of organic  matter,  (iv)  water  erosion  and  pollution;  and  (v)  aerial  transport  of  salt  and \ndust from the dry bed of the Aral Sea to irrigated lands.  \n \nLand  Degradation.  Land  degradation  is  widespread,  with  the  most  adverse  impacts \n6. \nbeing  experienced  in  the  provinces  of  Bukhara,  Navoi,  and  Kashkadarya,  as  well  as  in  the \nFergana  Valley.  While  erosion  from  water  and  wind  are  the  major  forms  of  land  degradation, \n                                                 \n1  The full description is presented in Supplementary Appendix A, Agriculture and Water Sector Review. \n2  ADB. 2004.

Rome.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nsecondary  salinization  is  one  of  the  most  important  factors.  Caused  mainly  by  the  over-\nirrigation, secondary salinization affects up to 47% of the irrigated area. Irrigable land is being \ndegraded  steadily.  Of  the  more  than  4.1  million  hectares  (ha)  of  irrigable  land,  an  estimated \n20,000  ha  are  abandoned  each  year.  The  abandonment  results  from  (i)  progressive  failure  of \nthe  irrigation  systems,  (ii)  inadequate  drainage,  and  (iii)  increasing  soil  salinity.  Due  to  lack  of \nmaintenance,  the  drainage  systems  also  have  deteriorated,  which  has  caused  water  tables  to \nrise  as  leaks  and  other  losses  from  the  irrigation  system  steadily  worsen.  Land  salinization \ncauses  an  estimated  $31  million  in  annual  crop  production  losses  in  Uzbekistan,  while  the \neconomic value of land abandoned due to high salinity is approximately $12 million.  \n \n7. \nWater  Resources.  The  climate  of  Uzbekistan  is  continental  and  arid.  Average  annual \nrainfall is 264 millimeters (mm), ranging from less than 97 mm in the northwest to 425 mm in the \nmountainous zone. Rainfall occurs during the winter season, mainly between October and April. \nThe two river basins in Uzbekistan\u2014the Amu Darya basin in the south and the Syr Darya basin \nin  the  north\u2014cover  86.5%  of  and  13.5%  of  the  country,  respectively,  and  form  the  Aral  Sea \nbasin. The estimated average surface runoff is (i) 22.33 cubic kilometers (km\u00b3)/year for the Syr \nDarya  River  basin  at  the  border  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Uzbekistan,  of  which \n11.8 km3/year is transit flow to Tajikistan; (ii) 11.54 km\u00b3/year for the Syr Darya River basin at the \nborder  between  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan,  of  which  10 km3/year \nto \nKazakhstan; and (iii) 22 km3/year for the Amu Darya River basin. The total river flow generated \ninside Uzbekistan is estimated at 9.54 km3/year.5 \n \n8. \nIrrigation  is  vital  to  Uzbekistan\u2019s  agriculture  because  of  its  climate.  The  design  of  the \nirrigation and drainage (I&D) infrastructure developed during the Soviet era was geared mainly \nto cotton production. Most I&D works were constructed according to sound technical standards. \nSince  the  late  1980s,  however,  funds  to  maintain  I&D  infrastructure  adequately  have  been \nlacking. During 2000\u20132003, maintenance of regular irrigation works covered only an estimated \n55\u201366%  of  actual  requirements.  More  than  60%  of  irrigated  land  depends  to  some  extent  on \nwater pumping, either for irrigation or drainage. Of the 5,100 pumping stations, more than 80% \nof  major,  50%  of  medium,  and  30%  of  small  pumping  stations  need  rehabilitation  or \nreplacement, according to estimates. Official figures indicate an irrigation efficiency rate of 60%. \nIn  many  areas,  however,  as  little  as  40%  of  the  water  reaches  the  field.  On  average,  at  least \n50% of irrigation water is lost in the system. \n \nC. \n\nInstitutions \n\ntransit \n\nflow \n\nis \n\nPublic  Institutions.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Water Resources  (MAWR)  of \n9. \nUzbekistan was established in 1996, and its organizational structure was approved in 2001. The \nmain  functions  of  MAWR  are  (i)  to  monitor  compliance  with  the  legislation  on  water, \ncooperatives  (shirkat),  and  private \nthe  development  and \nimplementation of branch and regional agriculture, as well as water management development \nprograms in conjunction with other Government ministries and agencies, state committees, and \nlocal  and  Government  state  bodies;  (iii)  to  coordinate  the  development  and  implementation  of \nmeasures  for  multisector  agriculture  and  rights  protection  of  rural  producers,  with  other \nministries,  agencies,  and  state  committees;  and  (iv)  to  develop  the  strategy  for  rural  industrial \nand  social  infrastructure.6 MAWR,  therefore,  is  the  national  institution  responsible  for  I&D.  As \nsuch,  it  has  offices  at  central,  province,  and  district  levels.  Following  the  2003  presidential \ndecree on deepening reforms in agriculture, MAWR is being reorganized. The decree promotes \n\nto  participate \n\nfarms;  (ii) \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n5  FAO. 1997. Aquastat Country Profile Uzbekistan. Rome. \n6 \n\nInformation on MAWR from the Portal of the State Authority (www.gov.uz). \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\f        Appendix 2     \n\n 27\n\n \n\nthe  introduction  of  a  basin-level  water  resource  management  system.  Before  2003,  the \ninstitutional  structure  of  the  water  management  system  was  based  on  administrative \nboundaries.  Now  the  Government  is  completing  the  restructuring  of  local  organizations  into \nwater management agencies based on 10 basins.  \n\n10. \nFinancing for the Sector. MAWR is a self-financing entity, receiving contributions from \nits provincial departments and organizations. A review of the last 3 years of income statements \nshows that the planned level of revenue for MAWR was around $1 million annually. However, \nonly 60\u201380% of the planned amount was received. Thus, MAWR had barely enough money for \nsalaries;  social  insurance;  business  trips;  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  buildings, \ncars,  equipment,  and  other  operating  expenses.  A  new  system  of  financing  cotton  and  wheat \nhas  been  introduced  for  private  farms.  Despite  the  low  annual  interest  rate  of  3%,  the \ncomplexity  of  the  credit  application  has  discouraged  many  farmers.  In  response  to  the  rapidly \ngrowing number of private farms, banks are expanding their branch network into rural areas.  \n\n11. \nProperty  Rights  and  Land  Tenure.  Uzbekistan  has  three  main  types  of  agricultural \nproducers: (i) shirkats (cooperative farms), (ii) private farms, and (iii) dekhan farms (household \nplots). With the restructuring of shirkats accelerating in recent years, private farms are expected \nto dominate the agriculture sector soon. Although the first private farms were created in 1992, \nmost  date  from  1996.  As  of  late  2004,  the  country  had  more  than  100,000  private  farms, \ncultivating about 1.6 million hectares (38% of irrigated land). Despite the rapid restructuring of \nshirkats into private farms, the registration of allocated land has not made similar progress. In \naddition,  during  the  restructuring  of  shirkats,  some  farmers  expressed  concern  that  the \ndistribution of land is neither fair nor transparent. Private property and written contracts are also \ndifficult to enforce. Finally, as the land tenure agreement between the leaseholder and the local \ngovernment  has  no  transferable  value,  it  cannot  be  used  as  collateral  to  obtain  credit  from \nbanks.  \n \nD. \n\nPolicy Environment \n\n12. \nThe Government\u2019s agricultural strategy is focused on three broad goals: (i) generation of \nforeign  exchange  earnings;  (ii)  improvement  in  food  security;  and  (iii)  promotion  of  rural \nemployment,  improvement  in  living  standards,  and  enhanced  social  stability.  The  Government \nintervenes  in  the  agriculture  sector  by  setting  production  targets  for  cotton  and  wheat,  fixing \noutput prices, and executing procurement quotas. In 2001, in line with the sector strategy and \nunder  pressure  from  funding  agencies,  the  Government  agreed  to  pilot  test  procurement  and \npricing  policy  reforms  in  six  districts  covered  by  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Ak  Altin \nAgricultural Development Project7 and the World Bank\u2019s Rural Enterprise Support Project. The \nreforms under these projects focused on (i) abolition or easing of wheat and cotton production \ntargets,  (ii)  reduction  in  the  mandatory  crop  procurement  quotas,  (iii)  abolition  of  joint \nresponsibility of farms and family groups for fulfilling procurement quotas, (iv) adjustment of the \nstate procurement prices based on movement of international prices and domestic inflation, and \n(v) gradual reduction in wheat and cotton procurement by the Government.  \n \nAgricultural  Taxation.  Before  1999,  the  Government  imposed  a  variety  of  agricultural \n13. \ntaxes, including profit tax, value-added tax (VAT), environment tax, water tax, property tax, land \ntax, and other local taxes and fees. On average, agricultural enterprises paid about 23% tax on \ntheir revenue, and 18% on their cost of production. In 1999, the Government introduced a single \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB.  2002.

This  applies  to  all  agricultural  producers \nexcept dekhan farmers, who pay land tax, water tax, and property tax. Since the introduction of \nthe  new  unified  land  tax  in  Tashkent  and  Samarkand  oblasts,  the  overall  tax  burden  declined \nfrom 23% in 1999 to 14.6% in 2003. \n \n14.  Water Sector Priorities. The rehabilitation of key water management facilities is one of \nthe  Government\u2019s  top  national  priorities.  The  Government  recognizes  that  rehabilitation  is \nrequired to protect the livelihoods of many rural people, and to maintain the basic resource and \ninfrastructure  foundation.  Without  such  rehabilitation,  ongoing  reforms  to  increase  agricultural \nproduction and to increase farm income would be compromised. In 2001, with the assistance of \nthe World Bank, the Government prepared a strategy for the irrigation and drainage subsector. \nA two-phase approach was proposed. The first phase comprised a public investment program to \nrehabilitate priority works of the main and inter-farm I&D systems. The second phase covered \nthe  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  all  I&D  infrastructure  in  Uzbekistan,  and  would  include \nimprovements to the on-farm infrastructure funded mainly by water users\u2019 association (WUAs) \nand farmers.  \n \nE. \n\nBinding Constraints to Sector Performance \n\n15. \nSince  1991,  the  cotton  subsector  has  been  in  decline,  with  cotton  planting  area  and \nproductivity steadily falling. Cotton area has declined from 1.75 million ha in 1991 to 1.4 million \nhectares in 2003, while cotton yields have fallen from about 2.55 tons (t)/ha in the early 1990s to \na current average of 2.25 t/ha. This reduced cotton output from 4.5 million tons in 1991 to 3.2 \nmillion  tons  in  2004.  Some  of  the  binding  constraints  to  sustainable  development  in  the \nagriculture  sector  can  be  grouped  into  three  broad  categories:  incentives,  infrastructure,  and \ninstitutions. \n \n16. \nIncentives. The Government\u2019s restrictive pricing and procurement policies give farmers \nlittle  incentive  to  increase  their  productivity  and  efficiency.  Rigid  control  is  largely  limited  to \ncotton and wheat marketing, with the Government acquiring almost all cotton and 50% of wheat. \nShirkats  and  private  farmers  growing  cotton  and  wheat  also  are  required  to  sell  a  significant \nproportion  of  their  produce  to  the  Government  at  fixed  prices. 8  Implicit  taxes,  through \nsuppressed  cotton  and  wheat  prices,  are  a  major  source  of  financial  transfers  from  the \nagriculture sector. These implicit taxes include the non-repayment of VAT on the sales of seed \ncotton,  and  the  inefficient  Government  monopoly  of  cotton  processing  and  marketing.  This \npricing  policy  and  tax  burden  significantly  reduces  the  gross  incomes  of  private  farmers  and \nshirkats, which are required to meet compulsory production quotas for cotton and wheat. VAT, \nwhich is applied by Government, was reduced from 16% to 13% as of 5 July 2005. \n \n17. \nIn addition, the cropping pattern imposed by the Government is highly detrimental to soil \nfertility. As cotton and wheat tend to exhaust the soil, a significant proportion of the area (30%\u2013\n40%)  could  be  planted  with  lucerne  and  other  leguminous  crops  to  replenish  soil  nutrition, \nabsorb salts, and supply feed for livestock.  \n \nShirkats  and  private  farms  deliver  their  cotton  and  wheat  quotas  to  Government-\n18. \ncontrolled  purchasing  centers.  After  the  crop  is  delivered  and  inspected,  farms  are  paid  via \naccount transfers through local banks (a detailed description of the full cotton marketing chain is \npresented  in  a  recent  World  Bank  report 9 ).  In  2002,  however,  the  Government  made  a \n\n                                                 \n8  Farmers are required to sell 50% of their raw cotton and wheat at fixed prices to the Government. \n9  World Bank. 2003. Uzbekistan Cotton Policy Note (draft). Washington. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\f        Appendix 2     \n\n 29\n\n \n\ncommitment to liberalize cotton marketing gradually10 with the aim of developing a competitive \nmarket  in  the  procurement,  processing,  distribution,  and  export  of  cotton.  In  2002,  20,000  t  of \ncotton  were  sold  through  an  auction  system  established  by  the  commodities  exchange.  The \nquantities  of  cotton  marketed  through  this  exchange  are  expected  to  expand  rapidly  in  the \nfuture. Wheat marketing is less regulated, with a number of private mills purchasing non-quota \nwheat from farmers. \n \n19. \nEven  though  the  state  procurement  prices  were  increased  recently  to  more  closely \nreflect  world  market  prices,  and  procurement  quotas  are  being  relaxed  gradually,  the  current \npolicies  are  still  very  restrictive  and  severely  limit  a  farmer\u2019s  ability  to  allocate  resources  to \nalternative  farm  enterprises  in  a  productive  and  profitable  manner.  Farmers  who  fail  to  meet \nproduction  targets  can  face  punishments  from  local  authorities,  including  lower  prices  and \npossible eviction from their land. Farmers, therefore, have very little incentive to increase their \nproductivity and efficiency under these restrictive pricing and procurement policies. \n \n20. \nInfrastructure. The Government has been unable to provide sufficient funds for capital \ninvestment and operation and maintenance (O&M) to ensure that I&D infrastructure remains in \nsatisfactory condition. Since the mid 1990s, only about 40% of the funds needed for O&M have \nbeen  allocated  in  the  budget.  Between  1995  and  2002,  Government  financing  of  water  sector \nfell  from  2.9%  of  GDP  to  1.8%  (i.e.,  60%  reduction),  while  the  resources  allocated  for  capital \ninvestment  in  the  water  sector  also  declined  from  0.9%  of  GDP  to  0.6%. 11  As  a  result, \nconsiderable deferred capital and O&M expenditure (estimated at more than 40% of total asset \nvalue)  is  urgently  required  to  return  the  system  to  a  satisfactory  standard.  On-farm  I&D \ninfrastructure  is  also  in  very  poor  condition,  as  the  low  net  returns  from  cotton  and  wheat \nproduction  over  the  past  decade  have  reduced  the  financial  resources  available  to  maintain \nthese systems.  \n \n21. \nThe  cost  recovery  mechanism  for  O&M  of  I&D  infrastructure  is  ineffective  and  almost \nentirely  dependent  on  Government  budget  allocations,  which  have  been  diminishing  in  recent \nyears.  The  vast  majority  of  farmers  receive  irrigation  water  for  free.  This  lack  of  funding  and \nneglect of basic maintenance requirements have jeopardized the future sustainability of irrigated \nagriculture.  \n \n22. \nThe  decline  in  the  condition  of  I&D  infrastructure  contributes  to  the  depletion  of  the \nagricultural resource base, as well as to environmental degradation. The continued deterioration \nof  I&D  infrastructure,  which  could  lead  to  the  collapse  of  some  of  these  systems,  also \nendangers  the  livelihoods  of  millions  of  rural  people  who  depend  on  the  efficient  operation  of \nthese  large-scale  irrigation  systems.  Moreover,  unless  this  deterioration  is  arrested,  it  will \nundermine  the  ongoing  agriculture  sector  reform  program,  which  cannot  succeed  without  the \neffective  functioning  of  basic  I&D  infrastructure.  It  also  will  harm  the  livelihoods  of  the  future \nfarming generations. \n \n23. \nInstitutions.  One  of  the  key  limitations  to  the  accelerated  development  of  private \nfarming is the lack of adequate support services, such as input supply, machinery services, and \ncredit facilities. The quantity and timing of farm inputs is often unreliable. Machinery services are \nalso  frequently  not  available  in  a  timely  manner,  which  undermines  crop  productivity. \nGovernment  agencies  and  banks  are  responsible  for  financing  and  rationing  90%  of  input \nsupplies. Inputs for cotton and wheat are rationed according to production plans, and their use \n\n                                                 \n10  Letter of Intent of the Government of Uzbekistan on Policy Reforms to the IMF, 29 July 2002. \n11  Center for Economic Research, Uzbekistan. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nfor other crops is strictly forbidden.

Rural \nincomes  are  estimated  to  have  dropped  to  less  than  5%  of  urban  wage  rates.  The  increasing \ndisparity  has  resulted  from  a  combination  of  falling  rural  incomes  and  the  need  for  the  farm \nsector  to  absorb  a  high  proportion  of  the  growth  in  the  working  population.  Furthermore,  the \nprivate  agribusiness  sector  remains  poorly  developed,  largely  due  to  the  unclear  business \nenvironment. Private rural businesses involved in trading, processing, or construction generally \nare limited to small-scale operations with modest capital investment. \n \n25. \nThe  main  binding  constraint  seems  to  be  the  system  of  incentives,  such  as  the  state \nproduction  quota,  restrictive  crop  procurement,  and  pricing  policies.  These  policies  and \npractices  do  not  provide  sufficient  motivation  and  freedom  of  choice  for  private  farmers  to \nincrease  investments  in  their  land  to  realize  productivity  gains,  implement  more  sustainable \ncropping systems, and choose higher value products. Hence, the proposed Land Improvement \nProject emphasizes policy reforms. The other key  binding constraint that the proposed Project \nwill address is the deterioration of land and water infrastructure, and the lack of effective O&M \ncost  recovery  mechanisms.  Thus,  the  Project  will  include  a  component  on  rehabilitating  such \ninfrastructure, coupled with the adoption of improved on-farm management practices, as well as \na component on strengthening land and water institutions. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n \nMAJOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE AGRICULTURE AND WATER SECTORS \n\n     Appendix 3 \n \n\n31\n\n \n\n \n\n \nProject \n\n \nCotton Subsector Improvement \n\nRural Enterprise Support Project \n(Appraisal) \nDrainage, Irrigation, and Wetlands \nImprovement \n\nFunding \nSource \n\n \nWorld Bank\n\nAmount  \n($ million) \n \n \n66.0 \n\n \nYear \n\n \n1995\u20132005 \n\nWorld Bank\n\n36.0 \n\n2001\u20132006 \n\nWorld Bank\n\n60.0 \n\n2003\u20132010 \n\nAk Altin Agricultural Development \n\n36.0 \n\n2000\u20132006 \n\nThe Grain Productivity Improvement  \n\n26.0 \n\n2004\u20132009 \n\nAmu Zhang Irrigation Rehabilitation \n\n73.0 \n\n2004\u20132009 \n\nIrrigated Agriculture and Food Industry \nDevelopment \nRegional Agricultural Development \n\nSupply of O&M Equipment to the MAWR  \n\nPRC \n\n1.6 \n\n2.4 \n\n5.1 \n\n1997\u20132001 \n\n1997\u20132001 \n\n2005\u20132006 \n\nADB \n\nADB \n\nADB \n\nEU \n\nEU \n\nIntegrated Water Management \n\nSDC/IWMI \n\n4.8 \n\n2001\u20132008 \n\nSpecial \n\nRegional \nProgram \nNatural Resources Management \n\nInitiative  Water \n\nUSAID \n\n10.0 \n\n2002\u20132005 \n\nUSAID \n\n25.0 \n\n2000\u20132005 \n\n \nLocation \n \n \nNational \n \nFive Districts \n \nThree Districts in \nSouth \nKarakalpakstan \nAk Altin \n \nTashkent, \nSamarkand, Jizzak \nSukhandarya \n \nNational \n\n \n \nNavoi, Bukhara, \nKashkadarya, and \nother oblasts \nKyrgyz Republic, \nTajikistan, and \nUzbekistan \n \n \nKyrgyz Republic, \nTajikistan, and \nUzbekistan (various \nprovinces) \nKyrgyz Republic, \nTajikistan, and \nUzbekistan  \n\nWater User Associations Support \n\nUSAID \n\n25.0 \n\n2004\u20132009 \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n370.9 \n\n \n\n \n\nADB  \u2013  Asian  Development  Bank;  EU  \u2013  European  Union;  IWMI  \u2013  International  Water  Management  Institute;  PRC  \u2013 \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China; SDC \u2013 Swiss Development Corporation; USAID \u2013 United States Agency for International \nDevelopment; WB \u2013 World Bank \n \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n            COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN  \n \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \nTable A4.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Category \n \n(SUM\nmillion)\nForeign\n\nLocal\n\nLocal\n\nTotal\n\n($'000)\nForeign\n\nTotal\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\n% % Total\nBase\nCosts\n\n3\n2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ni\n\nExpenditure Accounts\n\nI.\n\nInvestment Costs\nA.

To  achieve  the  sector  goal  of  accelerated,  environmentally \nsustainable  development,  key  constraints  must  be  removed  to  reverse  natural  resource \ndepletion, improve land and water management, and improve productivity.  \n \n2. \nRapidly  worsening  land  degradation  is  threatening  the  performance  of  the  agriculture \nsector. Land degradation causes an estimated $31 million in annual crop production losses in \nUzbekistan.  If  land  degradation  is  not  arrested,  and  irrigation  and  drainage  (I&D)  facilities  are \nallowed  to  deteriorate  further,  the  cropped  area  could  shrink  by  up  to  25%  over  the  next  30 \nyears,  according  to  estimates.  As  a  result,  crop  yields  will  continue  to  decline,  and  the \nlivelihoods  of  a  large  proportion  of  the  poor  rural  population\u2014and  of  the  subsequent  rural \ngenerations\u2014will be jeopardized.  \n \n3. \nPublic sector involvement is necessary to address market and institutional failures in the \nagriculture sector. Through this Project, the Government will implement key policy reforms and \naddress  institutional  constraints,  including  (i)  reducing  production  quotas  to  improve  farmers\u2019 \nincentives in project areas, (ii) reducing interventions by local authorities into farming activities, \nand (iii) improving land tenure rights. \n \n4. \nADB\u2019s  Role.  The  new  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  strategy  and  program \n(2006\u20132010) 2  in  Uzbekistan  recognizes  that  the  main  constraints  to  increasing  agricultural \nproductivity  are  (i)  the  state  procurement  system,  and  (ii)  state  intervention  in  inputs  and \nmarketing. It also recognizes the need to strengthen land rights, as well as market and land and \nwater  management  institutions,  and  to  maintain  the  physical  state  of  land  and  water \ninfrastructure.  This  Project  is  complemented  by  other  ADB  activities  in  Uzbekistan,  which \nsupport  the  ongoing  policy  and  institutional  reforms  (e.g.,  alternative  procurement  quota \nsystems and the formulation of a water delivery cost recovery policy).  \n \nB. \n\nFinancial and Economic Impact and Feasibility \n\n1. \n\nExpected Benefits \n\nEconomic and financial analysis of the \u201cwith project\u201d and \u201cwithout project\u201d scenarios was \n5. \ncarried out to assess the economic impact and viability of the Project. This analysis also aimed \nto  determine  the  financial  impact  on  farmers,  as  well  as  the  impact  of  project-related  reforms. \nThe  main  economic  benefits  are  expected  from  (i)  avoidance  of  production  losses  that  would \nhave  occurred  without  the  Project  due  to  further  land  degradation;  (ii)  increased  productivity \nfrom a more efficient alignment of cotton, wheat, and other cropping patterns; and higher cotton \nand  wheat  yields  resulting  from  the  implementation  of  proposed  technical,  institutional,  and \npolicy  interventions;  (iii)  higher  and  more  sustainable  farmer  incomes  derived  from  price \nincentives and profitability improvements; and (iv) an increase in net Government revenue from \nthe project area. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The  full  description  is  presented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  N,  Financial  and  Economic  Analysis;  and \n\nSupplementary Appendix O, Detailed Cost Tables. \n\n2   ADB. 2006.

The sum \nwas used as the unit of account, at the official exchange rate of SUM1,207 to $1 (March 2006). \nBasic assumptions used in the analysis include: \n \n\nThe use of a domestic price numeraire. \n\n(i) \n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\nThe  project  implementation  period  is  over  6  years,  and  the  project  life \n(following project completion) is estimated at 25 years.  \n\nEconomic prices for traded goods (i.e., wheat, cotton, and chemical fertilizers) \nwere  derived  from  World  Bank  commodity  price  projections3 for  2015.  Prices \nwere  converted  to  2006  constant  prices  using  the  manufacturing  unit  values \nindex,  and  were  adjusted  for  insurance,  freight,  processing,  transport,  and \nhandling to determine economic farm gate prices. Economic prices for cotton \nwere  derived  on  an  export  parity  basis,  while  the  economic  prices  for  wheat \nand fertilizers were calculated on an import parity basis.  \n\nFor imported goods and services, a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.18 was \nused.  In  view  of  the  high  subsidy  levels  of  machinery  services,  a  conversion \nfactor of 1.33 was used for converting financial prices to economic values. \n\nA shadow wage rate factor of 0.80 was used to reflect rural employment rates. \n\nThe unified land tax has been included in the farm budget financial analysis. \nAverage  land  tax  within  the  subproject  area  is  estimated  to  range  from \nSUM8,000 per hectares (ha) to SUM11,000 per ha.   \n\nTaxes and duties were omitted in the economic valuation. \n\n \n7. \nWithout  Project  (Current)  Yield  Assumptions. The current \u201cwithout project\u201d cropping \npattern comprises 58.2% cotton and 38.7% wheat (weighted average in the project districts), as \nshown in Table A5.1. Current yields in the project area were based on data collected from the \nproject  districts,  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Water  Resources  (MAWR),  and  household \nsocioeconomic  surveys.  The  weighted  average  yield  for  cotton  is  2.01t/ha  and  2.11t/ha  for \nwheat.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n3  World  Bank.  2004.

In  the  \u201cwith  project\u201d  scenario,  the  base  case  for  the \nfinancial  and  economic  analysis  assumes  that  the  farmers  benefit  from  rehabilitated  irrigation \nand drainage infrastructure, as well as improved agricultural and water management practices. \nBesides this base case, further analysis also has been carried out on the policy reforms. \n \n9. \nQuota Assumptions. The level of production quotas has been calculated based on the \ncurrent weighted average yields, which is in line with the approach used on the ongoing ADB-\nfinanced  Ak  Altin  Agricultural  Development  Project,4 Grain  Productivity  Improvement  Project,5 \nand Amu Zang Irrigation Rehabilitation Project.6 Cotton and wheat production under 50% quotas \nare estimated as percentages of the present (without the project) weighted average yields (e.g., \n2.01 t/ha for cotton and 2.11 t/ha for wheat), and are assumed to be 50% less under the 25% \nquota scenario. The formula used for these calculations is:  \n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2002.

EIRRs were calculated for each of \nthe subproject areas, and all are above 12%. These analyses were carried out on the base case \n(para.  8).  The  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  show  that  the  project\u2019s  economic  viability  is \nsensitive to declines in crop yields, drops in world prices for cotton, quota relaxation, and delays \nin physical works. As the economic impact of the Project hinges on the policy reforms, namely \nthe relaxation of production quotas, the expected economic impact is discussed in the section \non impact of policy reforms. \n \n\n4. \n\nFinancial Impact on Farmers \n\n12. \nProject area interventions will mitigate the gradual loss of production due to further land \ndegradation.  Over  the  past  15  years,  an  estimated  12,000  ha  (or  11%  of  the  irrigable  project \narea) has been abandoned. Without the rehabilitation of I&D infrastructure, another 13,000 ha of \nland could go out of production over the next 15 years. \n \n\n                                                 \n7  Estimates  are  based  on  the  World  Bank.  2005.  Cotton  Taxation  in  Uzbekistan.  Washington,  DC.  The  direct \n\nsubsidies are calculated pro rata for the cotton area within Land Improvement Project.  \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\nFor  60,780  ha  of  the  project  area,  the  full  rehabilitation  of  I&D  infrastructure,  coupled \n13. \nwith  improved  land  and  water  management,  are  expected  to  lead  to  improved  crop  yields, \nhigher cropping intensity, and an expansion of the irrigated area. Cotton yields are expected to \nincrease from 2.6 t/ha to 3.4 t/ha in Navoi, 1.8 t/ha to 2.8 tons/ha in Bukhara, 2.2 t/ha to 3.2 t/ha \nin Kasan, and 1.5 t/ha to 2.7 t/ha in Kamashi and Guzar. In the areas where rehabilitation works \ncover only off-farm infrastructure, the Project is expected to benefit an additional 75,404 ha. For \nthis  area,  cotton  yields  are  expected  to  increase  by  about  10%  and  wheat  yields  by  16%. \nModest  increases  in  cropping  intensity  are  expected  from  expanded  horticulture  and  fodder \ncrops for local markets. \n \n14. \nFor  each  subproject  area,  farm  budgets  were  prepared  for  private  farms  (30  ha)  and \ndekhan  farms  (0.25  ha).  These  farm  models  were  based  on  the  crop  budgets  and  cropping \npatterns  derived  from  detailed  information  on  crop  areas,  crop  yields,  input  use,  labor  and \nmachinery  requirements,  and  input  and  output  prices  collected  for  private  and  dekhan  farms \nduring the agro-economic survey. For private farms, net farm incomes are expected to increase \nby an average of $4,120 per year, or $3,940 after operation and maintenance (O&M) fees. The \nProject will have a positive impact on the net value of production of dekhan farms with increases \nranging  from  23%  in  Navoi  to  30%  in  Kashkadarya.  Annual  O&M  costs  for  the  on-farm \ninfrastructure were estimated at $68/ha, and $12/ha is assumed to be needed to cover part of \nthe O&M costs for the main and inter-farm systems.  \n \n15. \nAffordability.  The  farm  budget  analysis  demonstrates  that  the  increased  crop \nproduction,  combined  with  the  quota  reduction  from  50%  to  25%,  will  enable  farmers  to  meet \nthe  on-farm  investment  and  O&M  costs.  On  the  basis  of  this  analysis,  an  assessment  was \nundertaken of the farmers\u2019 capacity to pay I&D fees sufficient to meet (i) O&M costs for on-farm \ncivil works, (ii) O&M costs for part of main and inter-farm civil works (i.e., excluding pumping), \nand (iii) betterment levy to meet 100% of the on-farm rehabilitation costs. In the \u201cfuture with the \nproject\u201c situation, the annual O&M expenditure required for on-farm infrastructure was estimated \nat SUM75,500 per hectare, with SUM13,300 per hectare assumed to be needed to cover part of \nthe  O&M  costs  for  the  main  and  inter-farm  systems.  Regarding  the  farmers\u2019  capacity  to  meet \nthese  future  O&M  costs,  I&D  fees  were  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  the  additional  net  farm \nreturns (before I&D fees) for both types of farm. Currently, the water users\u2019 association (WUAs) \nis charging only nominal fees, and this is assumed to continue in the \u201cwith project\u201d situation. As \nan  indicator  of  farmers\u2019  capacity  to  pay,  the  general  rule  is  that  I&D  fees  (as  a  percentage  of \nadditional net farm income before I&D fees) should not exceed 50%. The analysis suggests that \nfarmers might have the capacity, in theory, to meet O&M costs. However, this is not likely to be \nsufficient,  given  the  substantial  constraints  private  farmers  face  in  the  current  \u201ccontrol  and \ncommand\u201d  farming  environment.  These  constraints  include  restricted  credit  facilities,  delayed \npayments,  and  lack  of  alternative  marketing  facilities,  as  well  as  procurement  quotas  and  low \nfarm  gate  prices  for  cotton  and  wheat.  The  results  of  this  analysis  highlight  the  importance  of \ncomplementing on-farm productivity improvements with policy reforms. \n \n\n5. \n\nImpact of Policy Reforms \n\n16. \nThe  analysis  of  the  policy  reform  measures  associated  with  the  Project,  using  a  policy \nanalysis matrix8 approach, indicates a positive impact on farmers and the Government. Four key \nindicators  were  used:  (i)  private  profit  and  loss,  (ii)  economic  profit  and  loss,  (iii)  domestic \nresource cost (DRC) ratio, and (iv) private resource cost (PRC) ratios.  \n\n                                                 \n8   See  Harrigan  et  al.  1992.

Manila. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n \n39\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n17. \nThe  private  (farmer)  profits  and  losses  reflect  the  results  of  the  Land  Improvement \nProject  (LIP)  farm  budget  analyses.  In  the  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  scenario,  private  profit  is  low \n(SUM103,000/ha), indicating that farmers do not have a strong incentive to expand or improve \nproductivity.  This  situation  will  deteriorate  further  without  the  project,  and  will  likely  generate \nlosses  if  costs  that  were  not  accounted  for  are  included.  This  would  make  the  introduction  of \nland improvements even more difficult in the future. However, private profits would increase with \nthe  relaxation  of  quotas,  which  would  raise  the  prices  farmers  receive,  and  reallocation  of \nresources  to  cotton.  Combined  with  productivity  improvements  from  drainage  technology,  this \nwould  enable  profits  to  improve  further.  For  example,  under  the  25%  quota  and  full  land \nimprovement  package,  private  profit  is  estimated  at  SUM478,000/ha  ($396/ha  equivalent). \nHigher private profits would increase the incentives for farmers to invest in land improvement, \nraising productivity and revenues further.  \n \nThe economic profit and losses also reflect the LIP farm budget analyses. The \u201cwithout \n18. \nproject\u201d  scenario  shows  a  higher  economic \nreturn \n(SUM217,000/ha or $195.50/ha). Still, this is marginally efficient in terms of its foreign exchange \nearning capacity. Quota relaxation would allow farmers to grow more cotton and receive prices \nthat  are  closer  to  economic  prices,  increasing  allocative  and  productive  efficiency.  Land \nimprovement technologies also increase economic efficiency: under the 25% quota and full land \nimprovement package economic profit is SUM717,000/ha or $594.03/ha.  \n \n19. \n DRCs for cotton in the \u201cwithout project\u201d scenario and for all project options are below 1 \nand  greater  than  0,  indicating  that  the  project  area  has  a  comparative  advantage  in  cotton.9 \nDRCs  move  closer  to  0  with  quota  relaxation  and  with  land  improvement  technology,  again \nshowing  greater  efficiency  under  the  25%  quota  and  full  land  improvement  package  option. \nCalculation  of  DRCs  in  financial  terms,  the  PRC  ratio,  indicates  low  output  prices  and  value \nadded  compared  with  factor  and  other  costs,  and  low  competitive  advantage  of  farmers.  The \nresults of the summary policy analysis for selected LIP scenarios are in Table A5.3. \n \n\nreturn  compared  with  private \n\nTable A5.3: Effects of LIP Technologies and Quota Reductions \non Economic and Private Performance of Cotton \n \n\n \n \nIndicators \n\n (SUM '000/ha) \n\nPrivate Profits/Loss  \nEconomic Profit/Loss  \n(SUM '000/ha) \nPrivate Resource Cost Ratio \nDomestic Resource Cost Ratio \nha - hectare \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n\n \nPresent \nSituation \n\n50%  \nQuota \n103.0 \n\n217.0 \n0.7 \n0.4 \n\n \nFuture \nWithout \nProject \n\n50%  \nQuota \n26.0 \n\n119.0 \n0.9 \n0.6 \n\nWith \nProject  \nOff-farm \nRehab. \nOnly \n50%  \nQuota \n144.0 \n\n310.0 \n0.7 \n0.3 \n\nWith \nProject  \nOff-farm \nRehab. \nOnly \n25%  \nQuota \n385.0 \n\n553.0 \n0.5 \n0.2 \n\nWith \nProject  \nFull  \nRehab. \n\nWith \nProject \nFull \nRehab. \n\n50%  \nQuota \n291.0 \n\n553.0 \n0.6 \n0.2 \n\n25%  \nQuota \n478.0 \n\n717.0 \n0.4 \n0.2 \n\n                                                 \n9   DRCs are based on economic prices, and have removed any price distortions. Economically profitable enterprises \nhave  a  high  value  added  in  relation  to  domestic  factor  costs.  DRCs  greater  than  1  show  low  comparative \nadvantage. DRCs between 0 and 1 show underlying comparative advantage.  \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\nThe  analysis  also  shows  that  an  efficiency  policy  objective,  rather  than  a  food  security \n20. \npolicy objective, would achieve greater financial profit and economic efficiency by growing more \ncotton  and  less  wheat.  Further,  the  Government  and  the  economy  would  benefit  from  greater \nefficiency in foreign exchange earning capacity, raising the capacity to import, for example, food \nfrom  countries  with  a  comparative  advantage  in  growing  wheat.  For  the  25%  quota  reduction \nand land improvement in the LIP areas, wheat production was unchanged.  \n \n21. \nThe adoption of a 25% quota would increase the efficiency of the project areas to earn \nforeign  exchange,  reduce  the  need  for  subsidies,  and  increase  Government  revenues.  The \nanalysis indicates that the 25% quota reduction would not compromise wheat production in LIP \nareas, and would increase cotton production by 15%.10 In addition, Government revenue would \nincrease  20%  due  to  the  sale  and  export  of  additional  cotton  production,  increased  tax \ncollection, and savings from lower subsidies. \n \n\n6. \n\nDistribution and Poverty Impact  \n\nThe Project\u2019s impact on employment within the project area will be moderate (2%), due \n22. \nto  the  low  elasticity  of  workforce  demand  in  the  agriculture  sector.  However,  continued \ncommercialization should increase employment in household and dekhan plots. Employment is \nalso  expected  to  grow  (by  3\u20134%)  among  service  providers  for  agricultural  operators,  I&D \ninfrastructure  maintenance  enterprises,  and  related  segments  of  the  labor  market  (trading, \nservices, agricultural production processing, etc.). \n \n23. \nThe  distribution  of  project  effects  among  the  main  stakeholders\u2014cooperative  farmers, \nprivate  farmers,  private  traders,  state  enterprises,  and  local  government  and  national \ngovernments\u2014also  was  analyzed  qualitatively  within  the  broader  context  of  the  agricultural \npolicy  reforms.  Table  A5.4  shows  the  Project\u2019s  anticipated  effects,  assuming  the  reforms  are \ncarried  to  improve  access  to  markets,  inputs,  and  credits;  improve  producer  land  rights;  and \npromote the transfer of irrigation management to WUAs. \n \n\nTable A5.4: Project Effect on Key Stakeholders \n\nProject Outputs  \n\nPolicy Reforms at the \nProject and Sector \nLevels \n\nImprovements in Land \nand Water \nManagement Practices\n\nRehabilitation of \nLand Management \nInfrastructure \n\n \n\nStakeholders \n\nPrivate Farmers \n\nGains from productivity \nand yield increases  \n\nGains if WUA becomes \nfinancially viable \n\nGain from improved \nland quality and timely \ndelivery of irrigation \nwater \n\nGain from price \nincreases \n\nGain from freedom to \nchoose most profitable \ncrop combination  \n\nGain through increased \nincentive to invest in \nproductivity and land \nimprovement \n\nPrivate Traders \n\nGain assuming \nexpansion in private \nprocessing and trading \n\nGain from increased \nmarketed surplus due to \nimproved land and \n\nGain from increased \nmarketed surplus due \nto improved land and \n\n                                                 \n10  The Ak Altin area cotton yields and sales to the Government increased by 30% from 2002, and wheat yields have \n\nrisen by 95% compared with 2003, even before the rehabilitation of I&D infrastructure. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n \n41\n\n \n\nProject Outputs  \n\nStakeholders \n\nPolicy Reforms at the \nProject and Sector \nLevels \n\ndue to increase in off-\nquota crop production \n\nImprovements in Land \nand Water \nManagement Practices\nwater management \n\nRehabilitation of \nLand Management \nInfrastructure \nwater management \n\nLocal Government \n\nGains through higher \nrevenue from taxes  \n\nLoss of influence of \ndistrict authorities as \nquotas reduced \n\nLoss of influence of \ndistrict authorities as \nquotas reduced \n\nLoss of direct authority \nover water management \n\n  \n\nGains through higher \nrevenue from taxes  \n\n \n\n \n\nNational Government \n\nGains through higher \nrevenue from taxes and \nexport of cotton \n\n \n\nGains from lower fiscal \nburden from inputs and \ncredit subsidies, and \nO&M \n\nGains from lower O&M \ncosts due to efficient \nand  improved main \nsystem network \n\nGains from lower \nexpenditure on O&M \n\nGains through higher \nrevenue from taxes and \nexport of cotton \n\n \nGains through \nincreased income tax \ncollection with higher \ngrowth and economic \nactivity in the long term \n \n\nO&M \u2013 operation and maintenance; WUA \u2013 water users' association \nSource: ADB estimates.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n\nPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n \n2007\nIII\nII\n\n2009\nII\nIII\n\n2008\nII\nIII\n\n2006\nIII\n\nIV I\n\nIV I\n\nIV I\n\n2010\nII\nIII\n\nIV I\n\nIV I\n\n2011\nII\nIII\n\n2012\nII\n\nIV I\n\nComponents/Activities\n\nA.

The \nProject  will  cover  nine  districts  in  Bukhara,  Kashkadarya,  and  Navoi  provinces,  which \nexperience  the  most  adverse  impacts  of  land  degradation.  The  Project  will  improve  farmers\u2019 \nlivelihood through higher yields, enhance land productivity, and increase incomes.  \n \n2. \nThe  Government  also  agreed  to  expand  and  deepen  the  reforms  outlined  in  the \nPresidential  Decree  of  24  March  2004,  and  to  improve  security  of  land  tenure  and  farmers\u2019 \naccess to commercial credit in the project areas. However, during implementation of other ADB-\nfinanced  projects,  some  constraints  were  identified.  These  included  a  lack  of  (i)  common \nunderstanding  and  approach  to  policy  reforms  at  the  central  and  provincial  levels,  (ii) \ncollaborative/participatory  policy  reform  review  and  evaluation  measures,  (iii)  comprehensive \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  mechanism,  and  (iv)  key  stakeholder  awareness  of  the  impact  of \nreforms  on  their  farming  and  financial  operations.  Therefore,  technical  assistance  (TA)  is \nproposed to address these issues. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nTo expand and deepen the reform process beyond the ongoing ADB-financed projects, \nthe implementation and outcomes of the reforms in the LIP areas must be monitored carefully, \nevaluated  and  discussed  among  all  key  stakeholders.  The  TA  will  (i) \nthe \nimplementation of the reform package agreed under the Project; (ii) raise the awareness of local \ngovernment  and  rural  communities  regarding  the  implemented  reforms;  (iii)  monitor  their \nimpacts  on  Government  revenues  and  expenditures,  and  on  rural  livelihood  and  poverty,  in  a \ntransparent  and  participatory  manner;  and  (iv)  propose  measures  for  improving  reform \neffectiveness.  \n \nOne  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  accelerated  agriculture  sector  reforms,  as  a  result  of  the \n4. \nimplementation  of  the  agreed  reforms.  Another  impact  will  be  widespread  dissemination  and \nsharing  of  reform  knowledge,  which  can  be  replicated  in  wider  geographical  context  within \nUzbekistan  and  in  Central  Asia.  The  TA  outcome  will  be  the  acceptance  of  the  participatory \nreform processes. The TA will have three components, each implemented as a separate phase \nof the TA.  \n \n5. \nPhase  1:  Analysis  and  Design  of  Reform  Measures,  and  Dialogue  with  Key \nStakeholders and International Funding Agencies. The main tasks will include (i) developing \nmethods  to  measure  progress  of  quota  reduction  at  district  and  farm  levels;  (ii)  designing \nmeasures to improve land use contracts in the project area\u2014and their use as collateral for bank \ncredit\u2014and  a  time-bound  program  for  registration  of  these  contracts;  and  (iii)  assessing  the \nliberalization of marketing of agricultural products. Following the initial review and analysis, the \nTA  will  establish  an  open  and  participatory  forum  to  review  and  assess  regularly  the  progress \nand  impacts  of  reforms.  This  forum  will  involve  national,  provincial,  and  district  governments; \nfarmers;  and  civil  society.  A  dialogue  with  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies  (World  Bank, \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  European  Bank  of  Reconstruction  and  Development \n(EBRD),  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID),  etc.)  will  be  initiated  to  ensure  a \ncoordinated approach to agriculture sector reforms and poverty reduction. This will be followed \n\nfacilitate \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n49\n\nby  a  joint  assessment  of  (i)  costs  and  benefits  associated  with  each  policy  reform  to  key \nstakeholders,  including  national,  local,  and  farmer  communities;  (ii)  anticipated  impact  on  the \nrural poor; and (iii) preparation of a timetable for implementation.  \n \nPhase  2:  Implementation  of  Agreed  Policy  Reform  Agenda.  Assistance  will  be \n6. \nprovided  to  the  central,  provincial,  and  district  governments  to  implement  the  agreed  policy \nreform agenda on a sustainable basis. This will be carried out through stakeholder consultations \nat all levels, including poorer farmers and particularly female-headed farms. Consultation at the \nfarm  and  local  government  levels  will  receive  greater  emphasis  to  ascertain  the  desired \ngrassroots  reform  needs.  A  comparative  analysis  of  the  governance  and  institutions  in  the \nproject  districts  will  be  carried  out,  and  assistance  will  be  provided  in  capacity  building  of \nimplementing  agencies  to  ensure  a  common  interpretation  of  the  policy  reforms.  The  TA  also \nwill  support  the  Government  in  improving  land  registration  legislation,  as  well  as  in  drawing \nimplementation  programs  to  ensure  that  reforms  with  immediate  impact  on  poverty  can  be \nimplemented in an effective and timely manner.  \n \nPhase  3:  Monitoring  the  Impact  of  Reforms  and  Stakeholder  Consultation.  To \n7. \nassess the impact of the project and policy reforms on farm incomes and poverty reduction, the \nfollowing tasks will be carried out: (i) establishment of a participatory system for monitoring and \nevaluation  of  the  impact  of  policy  reforms  on  poverty,  which  will  involve  consultation  with  key \nthe \nstakeholders,  civil  society,  and  elected  representatives;  (ii) \nimplementation of policy reforms and their impact on governance, Government revenues, farm \nprofitability,  and  poverty  reduction; 1  and  (iii)    identification  of  nongovernment  organization \n(NGOs)  or  other  independent  agencies  that  could  take  over  the  monitoring  process  after  TA \ncompletion. In particular, the TA will monitor (i) progress in terminating the involvement of local \nauthorities  in  farm  operations,  management,  and  marketing;  (ii) registration  of  land  use  rights; \n(iii)  impact  of  reforms  on  rural  incomes;  and  (iv)  proposals  for  expansion  of  reform  initiatives \nbased on an assessment of the impact of implemented reforms.  \n \n8. \nThe  TA  outputs  will  include  (i)  agreed  measures  to  reduce  quotas,  register  land  use \ncontracts, and liberalize agricultural markets in the project districts; (ii) implementation plan for \nreforms; and (iii) monitoring design, implementation plan, and reports. The TA will also design \nand carry out policy consultation campaigns, national and district workshops, emphasizing legal \nand financial aspects, as well as gender-related impacts,2 of the reform process. \n  \nC. \n \n9. \nThe  TA  will be  implemented  over  24  months,  starting  in  October  2006.  The  Ministry  of \nEconomy  will  be  the  TA  Executing  Agency.  The  TA  consultants  will  work  closely  with  the \nMinistry  of  Agriculture  and  Water  Resources  (MAWR)  and  other  key  stakeholders.  Other \nGovernment  institutions  that  might  participate  in  TA  implementation  include  National  Bank  of \nUzbekistan,  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  the  Ministry  of  Justice.  The  consultants  also  will  interact \nwith  the  ADB-financed  Ak  Altin  Development  Project3 and  Amu  Zhang  Irrigation  Rehabilitation \nProject4, as well as relevant ongoing projects of other international agencies (e.g., World Bank), \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\ninitial  monitoring  of \n\n                                                 \n1  Including collection and analysis of gender-disaggregated data. \n2  A project-specific gender action plan has been developed under LIP to promote the equal participation of male and \n\nfemale stakeholders in the Project. \n\n3  ADB.  2002.

Intensive consultations will \nbe conducted with civil society organizations and private sector organizations. \n \n10. \nThe TA will require 14 person-months of international consulting services and 36 person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services.  The  international  consultant  inputs  will  include  a \nmonitoring and evaluation specialist/team leader (6 person-months), an institutions specialist (3 \nperson-months),  a  social  development  specialist  (3  person-months),  and  a  credit  specialist  (2 \nperson-months).  The  domestic  consultant  inputs  will  comprise  a  monitoring  and  evaluation \nspecialist/deputy team leader (24 person-months), a legal specialist (3 person-months), a water \nusers\u2019 association (WUA) specialist (2 person-months), a credit specialist (3 person-months), a \ngender specialist (2 person-months), and a public awareness specialist (2 person-months). The \nrecruitment  of  the  TA  consultants  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. Simplified technical proposals and ADB's quality- and cost-based selection system \nwill be used to choose consultants. \n  \nD. \n\nReporting \n\n \n\nEstimated Costs \n\n11. \nThe  consultants  will  submit  an  inception  report  1  month  after  starting  work  on  the  TA. \nThe  consultants  also  will  submit  a  final  report  for  phase  I,  bimonthly  progress  reports,  and  a \ncomprehensive  draft  final  report  at  the  end  of  the  10th  month  of  phase  III,  followed  by  a  final \nreport  at  the  end  of  TA  implementation.  Each  report,  which  will  be  published  in  English  and \nRussian,  will  include  a  section  on  the  Government\u2019s  progress  toward  meeting  loan  covenants \nand  policy  reforms.  All  public  consultation  and  dissemination  materials  will  be  published  in \nEnglish, Russian, and Uzbek. \n  \nE. \n \n12. \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,000,000  equivalent.  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  will \nprovide  a  grant  for  $200,000,  while  the  Poverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund  (PRF) \nadministered by ADB will finance $600,000. As phase 3 will be completed after the PRF cutoff \ndate of December 2007, it will be financed by the ADB TA funding program. The Government \nwill finance the remaining $200,000 by providing offices, logistical support, and counterpart staff. \nThe estimated breakdown of the costs is in Table A10.  \n \nF. \n \n\nDescription of Tasks \n\n1. \n\nPhase 1: Analysis and Design of Reform Measures, and Dialogue with Key \nStakeholders and International Funding Agencies \n\n \n13. \nfarming decisions, and incomes.

To achieve this, the TA will \n\nHelp the Government undertake stakeholder consultations on the reform agenda, \nat  all  levels,  including  farmers.  Consultation  at  the  farm  and  local  government \nlevels  will  receive  greater  emphasis  to  ascertain  the  grassroots  reform  needs. \nBased  on  the  stakeholders\u2019  feedback,  necessary  changes  to  the  policies  and \ntheir implementation will be proposed. \nSupport  the  Government  in  identifying  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  the \ninstitutions and agencies that will be involved in implementing the policy reforms. \nAssist  the  Government  in  undertaking  the  required  capacity  building  to  enable \nimplementing  agencies  to  understand  how  each  policy  should  be  implemented, \nand to ensure a common interpretation of the policy reforms. \nSupport  the  Government  in  drawing  up  relevant  regulations  and  programs  to \nensure the effective implementation of the proposed policy reforms. \nAssist in identifying the resources required to implement each policy initiative.   \n\n3. \n\nPhase 3: Monitoring the Impacts of Policy Reform \n\n \n15. \n \n\nThe consultants will: \n\nEstablish  a  system  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  agreed  policy  reforms  that \nconcentrates on the project districts, and involves participatory consultation with \nkey stakeholders, including civil society and elected representatives.

About  15  million  people,  or  60%  of  the  population  of \n25.6  million,  live  in  rural  areas  and  depend  solely  on  the  agriculture  sector  for  their  livelihoods.  Some  3  million \ndekhan  farms  (small  inheritable  households  plots  free  in  farms  crop  selection  and  marketing)  grow  agricultural \nproducts on small plots (from 0.15 to 0.35 hectare (ha)), thus contributing significantly to household budgets. Despite \nthe expected 15% decrease in agriculture sector employment from 2005 to 2010, agriculture  will continue to be an \nessential sector of the national economy. It will absorb more than a fourth of the 300,000 young people who enter the \nlabor  market  annually.  While  Uzbekistan  does  not  have  an  official  definition  of  poverty,  the  Government  has  been \naddressing  poverty-related  issues  in  collaboration  with  international  funding  agencies.  In  2003,  two  major  studies \nwere  carried  out:  the  World  Bank-funded  Living  Standard  Assessment  (LSA);  and  the  study  entitled  Linking \nMacroeconomic  Growth  Policy  to  Poverty  Reduction,  funded  by  United  Nations  Development  Program  (UNDP). \nThese studies formed the basis for the formulation of the Medium-Term Strategy for Improving the Living Standards \nof  the  People  of  Uzbekistan  (SILSP),  funded  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  They  also  contributed  to  the \nfinalization of the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) in June 2005. \n \nThe  World  Bank\u2019s  LSA  found  the  incidence  of  rural  poverty  in  Uzbekistan  was  30.5%  in  2001.  The  percentage  of \npoor  households  was  18.7%  (Navoi  oblast),  13.4%  (Bukhara),  and  62.6%  (Kashkadarya).  Data  in  the  I-PRSP \nindicate that the average poverty incidence in Uzbekistan has decreased from 27.5% in 2001 to 26.2% in 2003. The \nSILSP and I-PRSP emphasize the critical role of agriculture in reducing poverty in rural areas, where 70% of the poor \nreside.  These  documents  emphasize  the  need  to  address  poverty  by  (i)  increasing  agricultural  productivity,  (ii) \nimproving irrigation and drainage (I&D) systems, (iii) developing a free market of commodities and agricultural input \nresources (fertilizers and machinery), (iv) developing water users\u2019 association (WUAs), and (v) implementing market \nreforms. Agricultural development is one of the Government\u2019s priorities. Planned reforms include the liberalization of \nthe  agriculture  sector  by  reducing  Government-order  target  output  of  cotton  and  wheat,  and  transferring  land  to \nprivate farms. The I-PRSP provides for an increase of private farmers from 102,000 in 2004 to 151,000 in 2010, and \nfor  restructuring  77%  of  agricultural  land  for  private  farmers  (against  47%  in  2004).  By  2010,  private  farmers  are \nexpected to contribute 26.6% of the country\u2019s agricultural output, compared  with 17.3% in 2004 and 3.5% in 1998. \nThe  I-PRSP  emphasizes  that  the  decrease  in  crop  yields  and  crop  areas  resulting  from  land  salinization  and \ndegradation now affects about 50% of the irrigated land area, with an immediate impact on the living standards of the \npopulation.  Land  conditions  continue  to  deteriorate  in  Uzbekistan.  During  the  Soviet  era  and  the  time  of  collective \nfarms (shirkats), shirkat workers were not motivated to produce results from their work. Following independence, the \nfleet  of  tractors  and  other  agricultural  machinery  decreased  40\u201370%  between  1997  and  2003.  Rehabilitation  of \ndrainage  networks  has  been  limited,  and  construction  of  new  drains  has  not  materialized,  due  to  a  lack  of \nGovernment funding for operation and maintenance (O&M), rehabilitation, and upgrading. \n \nThe  relatively  new  Government  policy  of  restructuring  shirkat  land  into  farmland  managed  by  private/leasehold \nfarmers is improving farmers\u2019 motivation to enhance land management. However, thousands of new private farmers \nlack resources and machinery and equipment to undertake the necessary agricultural and land improvement tasks, \nbecause  their  crops  are  purchased  under  Government  order  at  approximately  30%  of  world  prices.  This  has \ndecreased the viable income of cotton farms. In the project area, about 85% of private farmers surveyed have saline \nland; 40% of private farmers have land affected by high groundwater table; and 20% of private farmers have low soil \nfertility. Land degradation has contributed to a decrease in all crop yields of almost 50%, which strongly influences \nhousehold income and poverty levels. \n \nThe  legacy  of  the  Soviet  era  centrally  planned  system  and  state  procurement  quotas  also  has  affected  the  use  of \njuvenile laborb Under pressure to meet state quotas, local officials order schools and universities closedc during the \ncotton harvest, and students are sent to work in the fieldsd Pupils are paid for their labor, though their actual wages \nafter  deduction  of  costs  (e.g.,  food  and  accommodation)  are  unclear.  However,  due  to  farm  restructuring,  the \nsituation  is  changing.  Private  farmers,  who  seek  to  reduce  production  costs,  are  hesitant  to  use  inefficient  juvenile \nlabor and pay  for students\u2019 food and accommodation. Due to the agreed  policy reforms  (e.g., quota reductione and \nlimited intervention of local authorities in private farming) and rapid farm privatization, the use of juvenile labor in the \nproject areas is expected to be reduced greatly. Specific assurances regarding the use of juvenile labor in the project \narea are included in the legal documents. \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\nTargeting Classification:  General intervention \n\nThe  population  in  the  project  districts  is  about  1,400,000.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  sample  survey  of  1,800 \nhouseholds (April 2005), using consumption level as key poverty indicator, poverty incidence in the project area was \n37.3% (Kashkadarya),  28.3% (Navoi), and 27.3% (Jandor rayon  of Bukhara  oblast). The extreme poverty rate  was \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\nabout  5%.  As  of  March  2005,  the  poverty  levels  in  monetary  terms  were  $9.5  (Kashkadarya),  $10.8  (Navoi),  and \n$10.4  (Bukhara)  per  capita  per  month.  During  the  same  period,  the  minimum  food  basket  price  that  ensures  per \ncapita consumption at 1,500 kcal per day (extreme poverty line) was $6.3. \n\nIn March 2005, the Kashkadarya oblast\u2019s average household  income  was $87,  and the average  per capita  income \nwas $13. The average total household income and average per capita income amounted to $100and $18 (Navoi) and \n$87 and $15 (Bukhara). The average per capita income of the poor households was 1.5\u20132 times lower than that of \nnon-poor  households,  i.e.,  $11  (Kashkadarya),  $10.5  (Navoi),  and  $8.7  (Bukhara)  per  month.  Day  wage  labor  and \nsocial transfers (pensions and social benefits) are the main sources of income for low-income households. Pensions \nand  social  transfers  as  a  percentage  of  the  incomes  of  poor  households  is  23%  (Kashkadarya),  35%  (Navoi),  and \n26% (Bukhara). Poor households spend more than 60% of their household income for foodstuffs, while the level of \nmeat consumption meets recommended standards in only  14% of households. The staple foods are  carbohydrate-\ncontaining foodstuffs (flour, potato) and fats (vegetable oil). The number of poor households spending for education \nis  20%  lower  than  that  of  the  non-poor  households.  In  monetary  terms,  poor  households  spend  50%  less  for \neducation  than  non-poor  households.  Poor  households  also  spend  50%  less  income  for  medical  treatment,  and \nallocate only 5% of their total expenditures for medical treatment (compared with 10% for non-poor households). In \nmonetary terms, poor households spend three times less on medicines and doctors than non-poor households.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFor non-income poverty indicators, poor and non-poor households have limited access to municipal services, such as \nclean  potable  water  and  public  sanitary  facilities.  Access  to  piped  water  is  limited  to  12%  of  households \n(Kashkadarya), 28% (Navoi), and 2% (Bukhara). Many settlements have no medical clinics, or they are in such poor \nconditions and have such limited funding that they cannot operate effectively. Rural areas have few drugstores, with \nlimited choice of medicines and excessively high prices. Access to basic medical services has been identified as a \ncritical  need  for  more  than  25%  households.  The  education  level  of  poor  households  is  close  to  the  average \neducational level of the population. However, the percentage of members with a secondary, vocational, and/or higher \neducation is 1.2 to 1.5 times lower in poor households. The availability of agricultural land and the quality of that land \nare important factors in determining the well-being for households, given the lack of employment opportunities in rural \nareas.  Direct  and  indirect  benefits  from  agricultural  ventures  accounted  for  70%  of  total  household  income  in  the \nproject  area.  Most  of  the  poverty  determinants,  which  are  related  to  farming,  are  caused  by  low  income  in  the \nagriculture sector. While low income is explained largely by increased land deterioration and decreasing yields, the \nlack of skills and resources among farmers and agricultural workers also contributes to low income levels. \n\n \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n\n  Yes          \n\n   No  \n\nDuring  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  consultations  and  loan  fact-finding,  a  broad  range  of  stakeholders \nwere  identified  and  consulted  at  central  and  local  government  levels,  including  grassroots  consultations  with  local \ncommunities  in  the  project  area.  During  the  preparation  of  the  Poverty,  Social  and  Gender  Analysis  (May  2005),  a \nsample survey was carried out with 1,800 households. This provided an opportunity to inform the stakeholders about \nthe  Project\u2019s  outcome  and  impact.  In  addition,  40  in-depth  interviews  were  organized  with  experts,  private  farmers, \nand  local  self-governance  bodies.  Four  rural  participatory  rapid  assessments  were  carried  out,  and  included  group \ndiscussions  with  the  general  public  and  experts  to  identify  key  social  problems  and  discuss  issues  related  to  living \nstandards, employment, and income generation. When the data was collected and analyzed, the specific needs and \nconstraints faced by women and other vulnerable groups were emphasized. The agro-economic study in the project \narea provided additional performance analyses and needs assessments of 80 private farms, 80 dehkan farms, and \n10 shirkat farms. Key project stakeholders are poor and non-poor agricultural operators, women, agricultural workers, \nagricultural input suppliers, agricultural service providers, financial institutions for agriculture, construction companies, \ncentral  and  local  authorities,  and  land  and  water  resource  management  institutions.  Key  vulnerable  groups  in  the \nproject  area  include  women,  the  unemployed  (mostly  people  who  lost  their  jobs  as  a  result  of  the  restructuring  of \nshirkats into private farms), and families with household land plots. \nIs there a participation strategy? \nThe  project-specific  participation  plan  (Appendix  12)  aims  to  involve  all  stakeholders  in  the  implementation  of  the \nLand  Improvement  Project  (LIP),  and  in  any  consultative  and/or  participatory  process  aimed  at  assessing  the \nProject\u2019s impact on poverty reduction. The stakeholders include Government authorities at central and oblast level; \noblast agricultural and water management agencies; river irrigation system management agencies (RISMA); research \nand  development  institutes;  civil  society  organizations,  including  WUAs  and  nongovernment  organization  (NGOs); \nand  project  beneficiaries  (shirkat  farms,  private  farms,  and  dehkan  farms).  Participation  will  be  encouraged  by \nemphasizing  consultation,  sharing  information,  empowerment  and/or  shared  control,  collaboration  and/or  shared \ndecision  making,  and  negotiations  during  project  implementation.  Participation  methods  will  include  workshops  and \nmeetings,  as  well  as  qualitative  and  quantitative  surveys  (projects  outset  and  project  completion).  To  expand  and \ndeepen  the  reform  process  beyond  the  LIP,  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  (Appendix  10)  will  (i)  facilitate  the \nimplementation of the reform package agreed under the LIP project, (ii) raise the awareness of local government and \nrural communities regarding the implemented reforms, (iii) monitor the impacts on Government revenue and on rural \nlivelihood  and  poverty  in  a  transparent  and  participatory  manner,  and  (iv)  propose  measures  for  improving  reform \neffectiveness.  \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n55\n\nD. \n\nGender Development \n\n \n\nIn Uzbekistan, women\u2019s contribution to the country\u2019s economy is important. The labor force participation rate is estimated \nat 60% among men and 31% among women. These estimates do not include those doing unpaid work in the family or on \nsmall  subsistence  plots.  In  2005,  the  proportion  of  women  among  the  officially  unemployed  was  61.5%,  compared  to \n38.5% for men. The average duration of job searches is higher among women than among men. As a result, 67.7% of \nthose  unemployed  for  more  than  1  year  are  women.  In  urban  areas,  employed  women  are  concentrated  within  low-\nincome sectors of the national economy, mostly state-funded and/or low-skill jobs. In agriculture, women tend to do low-\nproductivity manual work, such as cotton picking. This type of work is also often seasonal. Women with young children \nare  much  less  likely  to  participate  in  the  labor  force,  or  are  more  likely  to  have  their  employment  choice  limited  to \nhousehold  production  activities  (small  plots).  Women\u2019s  opportunities  to  participate  are  limited  due  to  the  limited \navailability of child care facilities. Furthermore, women traditionally are responsible for household tasks and children. The \ntraditional gender division of labor results in women\u2019s wages averaging 70% of men\u2019s wages. This continues to worsen, \nas  the  percentage  of  young  women  seeking  professional  degrees  is  decreasing  and  limited  to  traditional  disciplines,  a \npractice  that  exposes  them  to  the  risks  of  unemployment  and/or  accepting  low-paid  jobs.  In  rural  areas,  the  shift  from \ncollective farms to joint stock shareholding companies (shirkats) has resulted in labor retrenchment, which has affected \nwomen  significantly.  The  liquidation  of  collective  farms  in  favor  of  private  farms  organized  as  farmers\u2019  associations \n(PDFA)  and/or  WUA  has  consolidated  farm  management  as  a  male  occupation.  Women\u2019s  claim  to  private  farms  is \nlimited. The available data suggests that women represent only 4.8% of private farmers. Farm management appears to \nhave become a male occupation. This implies that women are being excluded from key employment opportunities in the \nrestructuring  process,  as  well  as  from  positions  of  authority  that  could  help  empower  them  in  local  communities.  Their \nlow  representation  among  private  farmers  seems  likely  to  be  due  partly  to  their  lack  of  appropriate  agricultural  and \nbusiness skills, and also to cultural stereotypes that are particularly strong in rural areas. Lack of influence over decisions \nregarding  the  distribution  of  land  also  might  mean  that  women  get  poorer  quality  plots.  While  the  actual  labor  input  of \nwomen  into  farming  activities  in  cotton  production,  on  private  subsidiary  plots,  and  household  plots  remains  extremely \nhigh, they are increasingly incorporated into the workforce as unpaid laborers or as casual laborers earning piece-wage \nrates. In addition, decreased access to municipal services and potable water affects the status of rural women farmers. \n\nDuring  project  preparation,  a  detailed  poverty,  social,  and  gender  analysis  was  carried  out.  Key  findings  of  the  gender \nanalysis and follow-up discussions during loan fact-finding confirmed women's increasing exclusion from the benefits and \nopportunities  derived  from  the  ongoing  farm  privatization  process.  Based  on  LIP\u2019s  potential  gender  impact,  a  project-\nspecific  Gender  Action  Plan  (GAP)  has  been  developed  (Appendix  13)  to  promote  the  equal  participation  of  male  and \nfemale  stakeholders  as  agents  and  beneficiaries  of  the  Project.  Proposed  activities  aim  to  (i)  establish  quotas  for \nwomen's  representation  within  decision-making  processes  and  structures  of  model  farms  and  WUAs,  (ii)  integrate \nwomen's needs and constraints in the design and operation of project infrastructure, (iii) establish quotas for rural women \nfarmers' participation in training activities, and (iv) ensure women's effective involvement in the monitoring and evaluation \nof project impacts. The Women\u2019s Committee, which will be represented in the project management office (PMO), will be \nresponsible  for  implementing  gender  design  features,  as  well  as  monitoring  gender-relevant  targets  and  indicators,  in \ncollaboration  with  the  Association  of  Women's  NGOs.  The  GAP  is  consistent  with  the  National  Platform  of  Action  on \nImproving Women\u2019s Status, adopted in 1998, and the Presidential  Decree entitled \u201cOn additional measures to support \nthe activity of Women\u2019s Committee of Uzbekistan\u201d, adopted in 2004. \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes     \n\n   No \n\nE. \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks  \n\n \n\nItem \n\nResettlement \n\nAffordability \n\nLabor \n\nSignificance \n\n Significant \nNot significant \n None \n\n Significant \nNot significant \n None \n\nSignificant \nNot significant \n None \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n Significant \nNot significant \n  None \n\nNo  \n\n \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nPlan \nRequired \n\nThe rehabilitation of the land improvement and irrigation system and \nthe construction of new ones do not require resettlement.  \n\n Yes  \n No  \n\nAs  many  as  97%  of  respondents  consider  the  improvement  of  their \nland condition extremely important for improving the living standards \nof the project area population.

In  practice,  local \nauthorities  have  been  reluctant  to  do  so  and  often  delay  the  re-\nregistration  process.  As  a  result,  private  farmers  have  to  pay  an \nexaggerated  incorrect  amount  as  land  and  water  tax  to  meet  target \ncrop  yields  that  are  based  on  an  overestimated  land  area,  and \nconsequently are exposed to a high risk of eviction from their private \nfarm plot.  \n\nPlan \nRequired \n\n Yes \n  No  \n\na  Uzbekistan  did  not  conclude  a  poverty  partnership  agreement,  but  adopted  its  National  Strategy  for  Improving  the \n\nLiving Standards of the People (funded by ADB TA), and the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. \n\nb  Article 77 of the Uzbek Labor Code, dedicated to child labor, mandates that the minimum working age is 14.

Proposed  activities  aim  to  (a)  establish  quotas  for \nwomen's  representation  in  the  decision-making  processes  and  structures  of  model  farms  and  water  users\u2019  association  (WUAs);  (b) \nintegrate women's needs and constraints in the design and operation of project-related infrastructure; (c) establish quotas for rural women \nfarmers'  participation  in  training  activities;  and  (d)  ensure  women's  effective  involvement  in  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  project \nimpacts. The National Women\u2019s Committee (NWC), which will be represented in the project management office (PMO), will be involved in \nthe implementation of gender design features, as well as the monitoring of gender-relevant targets and indicators, in collaboration with the \nAssociation  of  Women's  nongovernment  organization  (NGOs).  The  GAP  is  consistent  with  the  National  Platform  of  Action  on  Improving \nWomen\u2019s  Status,  adopted  in  1998,  and  the  Presidential  Decree  entitled  \u201cOn  additional  measures  to  support  the  activity  of  Women\u2019s \nCommittee of Uzbekistan\u201d, adopted in 2004. It will be implemented through the recruitment of a gender and development specialist at the \nPMO,  the  identification  of  the  NWC  gender  focal  points  in  the  three  project  implementation  unit  (PIU),  and  the  support  of  trainers  and \ntraining centers, as needed. GAP indicators and targets are reflected in the Project Framework matrix, and will be monitored through the \nLIP project performance monitoring system.
