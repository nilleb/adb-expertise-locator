These facilities \nwere part of ADB\u2019s Small and Medium Enterprise Development Support Project.  \n \n  This  project  performance  evaluation  report  reviews  the  nonsovereign \ncomponents of the above project involving the provision of a PCG to one financial \ninstitution to support its lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and a \nproposed equity investment in a CIB. The rationale and objectives of both components \nwere to improve the enabling environment for SMEs and their ability to access finance.  \n \n  The PCG facility was a revolving local currency, credit-enhancement facility \ndesigned to support participating financial institutions (PFIs) lending to SMEs. The \nfacility  was  set  up  to  guarantee  agreed  credit  risk  amounts  associated  with  PFIs\u2019 \nportfolios of loans and other credit exposure to their SME borrowers. In September \n2006, ADB approved Security Bank Corporation (SBC) as the first and only PFI under the \nPCG facility, with ADB and SBC operating on a 50\u201350 loss-sharing basis. The SBC facility \nwas for P500 million (50% of the total PCG amount), of which P100 million was \nallocated to Universal Robina Corporation (URC). All transactions for URC distributors \nwere structured as domestic standby letters of credit. The first transaction to URC was \nmade in January 2008. The maximum utilization of P98.8 million was achieved in \nFebruary 2010, and the last transaction matured in February 2011. No default or \ninvocation of ADB\u2019s guarantee has been recorded.   \n \n  In February 2011, ADB cancelled the unallocated balance of the P500 million \nPCG facility and the proposed $1 million equity investment in the CIB. The PCG facility \nwas terminated in April 2012 at the end of the availability period due to the low level \nof utilization. The equity transaction was cancelled because the established corporation \ndeviated from the ownership structure and oversight arrangements originally approved \nby ADB\u2019s Board. At the time of ADB Board approval, it had been envisaged the equity \ninvestment  would  be  made  to  a  nonsovereign  entity,  but  the  credit  bureau  was \nestablished by the government as a majority state-owned enterprise, and was ineligible \nfor ADB\u2019s nonsovereign funding. \n \n  The project is rated unsuccessful overall, based on unsatisfactory ratings for its \ndevelopment impact and outcome and ADB work quality, and a less than satisfactory \nrating for ADB investment profitability and ADB additionality. \n \n  The development impact and outcome of the project is rated unsatisfactory \nbased  on  component  ratings  for  private  sector  development;  business  success; \n     ", " \nxii  Small and Medium Enterprise Development Support Project \n \n \ncontribution to economic development; and environmental, social health, and safety \nperformance. The  facility\u2019s  overall  effect  on  private  sector  development  is  rated \nunsatisfactory since the expectation that it would be utilized by a number of PFIs, cover \na range of SMEs across sectors, and support different financial instruments was not \nrealized. Only half of the facility (P500 million) was allocated to only one intermediary \n(SBC), which financed smaller distributors of one food manufacturer for up to P100 \nmillion. The investment in the CIB never took place. The project\u2019s business success is \nrated less than satisfactory since less than 10% of the allotted funds were utilized. The \nPCG facility impacted a select few SMEs, which is a positive accomplishment. However, \ngiven the small size of the facility relative to SBC and its limited utilization by SBC, its \nimpact on SMEs by improving access to finance was minimal. Economic sustainability is \nrated unsatisfactory for the same reasons. Although it is possible, the intervention \ncould have generated some new jobs, its limited scale made a minimal contribution to \nthe local economy. On environmental, social, health, and safety performance, ADB\u2019s \ninvestment is rated satisfactory given SBC\u2019s compliance with environmental standards, \npractices  and  procedures,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples\u2019 \nsafeguards.  \n \n  Although  there  were  no  defaults  or  invocation  of  ADB\u2019s  guarantee,  the \ninvestment profitability based on average utilization and relative to capital allocation \nrequirements is rated less than satisfactory.  \n \n  ADB's work quality is rated unsatisfactory based on component ratings for \nscreening, appraisal, and structuring of the project, monitoring and supervision, and \nADB\u2019s role and contribution. ADB's performance in screening, appraisal, and structuring \nis  rated  unsatisfactory  because  of  the  low  utilization  (only  one  intermediary \nparticipated in the project) and the fact that ADB did not implement the first loss \nprovision in the guarantee agreement. The shortfalls in monitoring and supervision of \nthe facility are illustrated by the lack of new PFIs being selected and its low utilization. \nThere  was  considerable  delay  in  following  up  the  request  of  SBC  to  increase  its \nallocation to URC, which contributed to underutilization. The constant changing of ADB \nstaff  contacts  meant  there  was  no  real  continuity  of  supervision.  Since  overall \nmonitoring and supervision was not proactive in detecting problems or issues, it is \nrated unsatisfactory. ADB\u2019s role and contribution is rated less than satisfactory. Efforts \nto raise awareness and use of the facility by other Philippine banks and other clients of \nSBC were below expectations. No additional intermediaries were identified prior to \napproval, leading to considerable underutilization of the project.   \n \n  ADB\u2019s additionality is rated less than satisfactory. This rating would have been \nhigher if the facility had been adopted by at least a few PFIs or benefited a wider set of \nSME clients of SBC.  \n \n  The assessment offers these lessons: \n(i)  More work should have been undertaken to establish an adequate \npipeline of PFIs at the outset. \n(ii)  Pricing needs to be market related and fully reflect project risks. Where \nmarket comparators do not exist, more exhaustive studies and analyses \nof the effective demand for guarantees should have taken place. ", "Executive Summary     xiii \n \n(iii)  The  impact  of  ADB  staff  changes  on  the  monitoring  process  was \nunderestimated.  Although  the  need  for  effective  monitoring  was \nstressed in the report and recommendation of the President (RRP), its \noutcome was far from satisfactory.  \n(iv)  Better due diligence of the financial intermediary for the PCG should \nhave  taken  place  as  ADB  neither  fully  considered  SBC\u2019s  risk  rating \nprocess nor understood its processes and procedures. \n(v)  Better due diligence should have been undertaken for the proposed \nequity  investment  in  the  CIB,  and  the  risks  of  the  government \nestablishing  a  state-owned  corporation,  rather  than  a  private \ncorporation  adequately  flagged  in  the  RRP,  to  avoid  unnecessarily \nlocking up ADB headroom.  \n \nRecommended actions for future projects:  \n(i)  ADB  should  improve  its  due  diligence  and  screening,  and  identify, \nselect, and sign up a number of PFIs before approval. \n(ii)  ADB transactions should be made more replicable, and ADB should \ngrant more autonomy in decision making to the PFIs, establish there is \nsufficient  demand  for  the  proposed  project,  adopt  more  rigorous \nmarket-based pricing, and encourage its wider use to cover guarantees \nfor term lending by SMEs as well as for covering domestic standby \nletters of credit. \n(iii)  ADB needs to improve its monitoring of project implementation and be \nmore  flexible  in  responding  to  changes  needed  during  project \nimplementation.  \n       ", "", "CHAPTER 1 \nThe Project \n     \n \n \n \nA.  Project Background \n1.  In  August  2005,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Board  of  Directors  In August 2005, \napproved a partial credit guarantee (PCG) facility of P1 billion, a JPY2.75 billion ($25  ADB Board of \nmillion equivalent) loan guaranteed by the Republic of the Philippines to the Small \nDirectors \nBusiness Guarantee and Finance Corporation, and an equity investment of up to $1 \napproved a \nmillion in a proposed credit information bureau (CIB). These facilities were part of \npartial credit \nADB\u2019s Small and Medium Enterprise Development Support Project, which responded to \na request from the Government of the Philippines for assistance in implementing its  guarantee (PCG) \nsmall and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development plan, 2004\u20132010.1  facility of P1 \n \nbillion \n2.  Prior  to  this  approval,  ADB  had  financed  a  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance in 2003 to assess the status of SMEs in the Philippines, which included an \nanalysis of the government\u2019s development policies and actions, and the issues and \nconstraints  facing  the  SME  sector.  The  study  found  that  despite  SMEs\u2019  vital \ncontributions to the economy, their effective operations and growth were constrained \nby poor access to finance.2  \n \n3.

The PCG facility \nwas based on the concept of ADB risk participation with PFIs to stimulate lending to \nSMEs.

Under the facility, ADB set a limit of P1 \nbillion to be allocated among selected PFIs, two to five were originally targeted. The \nfinancial structure was based on a 50\u201350 risk-sharing arrangement between ADB and \nthe selected PFIs, who were required to cover the remaining risk of up to P1 billion. \nOther features of the facility are contained in Appendix 1.   \n \nC.  Progress Highlights \nThe PCG facility  6.  In September 2006, ADB\u2019s guarantee committee approved the inclusion of \nSecurity Bank Corporation (SBC) as its first PFI under the PCG facility, with ADB and SBC \nfor SBC was \noperating on a 50\u201350 loss-sharing basis.

The PCG \nmaximum  facility for SBC was approved for a maximum amount of P500 million (50% of the total \nPCG amount), of which P100 million was allocated to Universal Robina Corporation \namount of P500 \n(URC) as the principal for its distributors.3 Participants were URC\u2019s branded distributors, \nmillion  \nwhich were locally incorporated SMEs with sales turnover not exceeding P1 billion per \nyear.  \n \n7.  ADB and SBC completed all documentation and compliance requirements in \nthe second half of 2007. The first transaction under the facility took place in January \n2008, and utilization increased to its maximum level of P98.8 million (of a P100.0 \nmillion limit) in February 2010. Thereafter, no new clients were added, and utilization \ndropped with the maturity or expiry of underlying exposures. The last transaction \nmatured  in  February  2011.  Under  the  P100  million  limit  for  URC  distributors,  16 \nqualifying SME URC wholesalers received credit.

The project is evaluated using the criteria defined in ADB\u2019s guidelines.6 The \nproject rationale and objectives set out  in section B of this chapter  outline those \nenvisaged during the approval of the project. The investment is evaluated according to \n(i) development outcomes and impact, (ii) ADB investment profitability, (iii) ADB work \nquality, and (iv) ADB additionality.  \n \nB.  Project Rationale and Objectives \n11.  The rationale and objectives of the PCG facility were to improve the enabling \nThe PCG facility \nenvironment for SMEs and facilitate  their increased access to finance. This facility \nwas intended to  supported the Government of the Philippines\u2019 policies and plans to create at least 6 \nencourage banks  million jobs in 6 years by promoting SMEs, tripling financing available, and developing \nland for agribusiness. The facility was designed to support the needs of SMEs, and it \nto lend to SME \nfocused on enhancing access to long-term capital by PFIs and SMEs. The facility was \nborrowers based \ndesigned to encourage PFIs to allocate credit to SMEs through the use of innovative \non cash flows  risk-sharing arrangements.  \n \n12.  The PCG facility was intended to encourage banks to change the basis of their \nlending to SME borrowers from securing loans according to the value and quality of \ncollateral based on fixed and movable assets, to collateral based on SME cash flows. \nThis arrangement would have addressed the problem of limited access to finance \nresulting from banks\u2019 more conventional collateral-based lending approach based on \nfixed and movable assets.  \n \n13.  PCG-guaranteed exposures carry a zero risk weight in computing regulatory \ncapital requirements on banks.7 PFIs were expected to increase their lending capacity \nwithout  needing  more  capital,  exceeding  exposure  limits,  or  breaching  prudent \nunderwriting criteria. The PCG facility was envisioned by ADB to help banks improve \ntheir capital efficiency and loan portfolio diversity. These developments were expected \nto make commercial banks more willing and able to lend to SMEs.  \n                                                      \n6  ADB. 2014. Guidelines for Preparing Performance Evaluation Reports on Nonsovereign Operations. Manila. \n7 The credit risk weights, for each asset class under BSP\u2019s implementation of the Basel II capital adequacy \nframework,  have  been  defined  in  BSP\u2019s  new  risk-based  capital  adequacy  framework.  Under  this \narrangement, when a bank\u2019s exposure is guaranteed by a qualified guarantor\u2014in this case ADB, which has \nan AAA external credit rating\u2014the bank is allowed to apply the risk weight of the guarantor to the \nguaranteed portion of the credit exposure throughout the term of the guarantee. This reduces the capital \nrequirements for the facility. \n     ", "     Evaluation      5 \n \n14.  The proposed equity investment in the CIB was a complementary facility that \nwas intended to improve the enabling environment for SMEs. The investment had been \ntargeted for the end of 2005, when legislation was expected to have been passed and \ninvestments finalized by all sponsors. The main product of the CIB was to have been \nconsolidated  credit  information  that  would  have  allowed  the  CIB  to  improve  the \nsharing and dissemination of information through a credit information system that was \nintended to: (i) improve the ability of lenders to identify good borrowers; (ii) create a \nbetter  risk  management  process;  (iii)  increase  lending;  (iv)  extend  credit  to \nunderserviced sectors of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises; and (v) strengthen \ncredit discipline, leading to the lowering of defaults.   \n \nC.  Development Impact and Outcomes \n   \n  1.  Overview \n \n15.  The overall development impact and outcome is rated unsatisfactory based on \ncomponent  ratings  of  unsatisfactory  for  private  sector  development,  less than \nsatisfactory  for  business  success,  unsatisfactory  for  contribution  to  economic \ndevelopment,  and  satisfactory  for  environmental,  social,  health,  and  safety \nperformance.  \n   \n  2.  Private Sector Development \n \n16.  Private  sector  development  is  assessed  under  two  categories  (i)  beyond \ncompany impacts and (ii) direct company impacts. Based on component ratings of \nunsatisfactory  for  both  of  these  categories,  private  sector  development  is  rated \nunsatisfactory. Appendix 2 summarizes the private sector development indicators and \nratings. \n \na.  Beyond Company Impacts \n \n17.  The beyond company impacts of the project are discussed according to: (i) \nenhanced  lending  to  SMEs,  (ii)  demonstration  or  catalytic  impact,  and  (iii) \nestablishment of and support for the CIB. \n \ni.  Enhanced Lending to SMEs \n   \n18.  The  PCG  facility,  which  was  part  of  the  broader  intervention  for  SME \nThe project\u2019s \ndevelopment as envisaged in the RRP, had ambitious objectives to (i) improve access by \nintended \nSMEs to financing to promote their operations, profitability, and competitiveness and \noutcomes were \n(ii)  contribute  to  private  sector  development  and  sustainable  economic  and \nto increase PFI \nemployment  growth  in  the  Philippines.  The  project\u2019s  intended  outcomes  were  to \nincrease PFI lending to SMEs (in terms of borrowers and lending volume) and introduce  lending to SMEs \nnew and innovative products in the Philippine banking system to improve SME access \nto  finance.  The  project  had  a  tenor  of  5  years,  and  the  maximum  tenor  of  the \nguarantees was 3 years. The facility therefore had the potential to create a significant \ndevelopment impact on SMEs. The ADB Board observed that finding new SMEs and \ndeveloping their institutional capacity was more important to the success of the project \nthan increasing the size of the credit line being offered to SMEs.   \n ", " \n6  Small and Medium Enterprise Development Support Project \n \n \n19.  SBC  was  the  only  participating  banking  institution,  DSLCs  were  the  only \nguaranteed financial instrument, and URC wholesale distributors were the only types of \nSMEs supported under the project. Facility utilization peaked at nearly P100 million in \nFebruary 2010, which represented only about 10% of the approved limit.8 This amount \nwas well below ADB\u2019s expectations, considering the facility had an availability period of \n5 years. The lack of demand for the product could be attributed to various reasons, \nincluding: (i) ADB\u2019s lack of success in identifying more financial institutions that could \nhave benefited from such a facility, (ii) ADB delays in responding to SBC\u2018s requests for \nan increase in the limit for URC distributors when the P100 million limit was reached, \nand  (iii)  SBC\u2019s  lack  of  understanding  that  the  facility  could  have  been  used  for \nguaranteeing SME term lending facilities as well as DSLCs. Also, even though SBC tried \nto get its other distributor clients to use the remaining P400 million of the facility, \nmany of the distributors did not bank with SBC and were unwilling to change their \nbanking arrangements. SBC issued 65 DSLCs amounting to P430 million, but this only \namounted to about 0.1% of the estimated SME lending of all commercial banks in the \nPhilippines, which had outstanding balances of P408 billion at the end of 2011.    \n \nii.  Demonstration or Catalytic Impact   \n \nThe PCG facility  20.  The PCG facility was expected to have a catalytic effect based on its uptake by \nvarious  PFIs  to  service  a  variety  of  SMEs  and  satisfy  a  number  of  financing \nwas expected to \nrequirements. However, utilization was very low and of limited extent and scope. SBC \nhave a catalytic \nwas the only PFI that participated in the project, and only one of its clients (URC\u2019s \neffect based on  branded  distributors)  participated  in  the  project,  accounting  for  less  than  10% \nits uptake by  utilization of the entire approved limit. Once the P100 million limit was reached, SBC \nstopped using the facility for URC distributors  because of slow response times on \nvarious PFIs to \nrequests made to ADB to increase the limit allocated for URC from P100 million to P250 \nservice a variety \nmillion.  Another  reason  for  the  low  utilization  was  the  reorganization  of  URC\u2019s \nof SMEs and  distribution  network,  which  reduced  the  number  of  distributors  and  encouraged \nexclusive arrangements with larger distributors. Demand for the facility from SBC and \nsatisfy a number \nURC fell, leading to limited demonstration impacts.  The approach of guaranteeing \nof financing \nDSLCs has been continued by SBC using its own resources after closure of the ADB \nrequirements  transaction.   \n \niii.  Establishment and Support for the Credit Information Bureau  \n \n21.  The proposed equity investment in the CIB was cancelled in February 2011 \nbecause the ownership structure deviated from the originally approved structure in the \nRRP.  The  Credit  Information  Corporation  (CIC)  was  established  in  2008  as  a \ngovernment-owned and controlled corporation with 60% of its shares owned by the \npublic sector. In the RRP it was envisaged that the CIC would be established as a \nmajority privately owned corporation. The actual CIC ownership structure reflected the \nwishes of the government to have a majority (60%) ownership initially, but to gradually \nreduce its share by 20% over 5 years. It is not clear why this risk was not picked up \nduring the initial due diligence, as it meant that the CIC would not be eligible for \nnonsovereign equity funding. At approval, the target date for the ADB investment was \nthe end of 2005, as soon as legislation had been passed and investments finalized by \nall sponsors.  \n                                                      \n8  P98.4 million was utilized out of the of the approved ADB limit of P1 billion for allocation among selected \nPFIs.    ", "     Evaluation      7 \n \n \nGuardianship  of  the  CIC  is  assigned  to  the  Philippines  Securities  and  Exchange \nCommission and not the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) as originally proposed in the \nRRP. Legislation was passed in 2008, and the Securities and Exchange Commission \nsubmitted the proposed rules and guidelines for the establishment of the CIC to the \nCongressional Oversight Committee for review in May 2009. The CIC regulations were \napproved in January 2010, and the board of CIC was set up in 2010 with the chair of \nthe  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  as  its  head.  In  November  2012,  the \nInternational Finance Corporation and CIC signed an agreement for the provision of \nadvisory services to support the establishment of a credit information system in line \nwith international best practice standards. The assistance is scheduled for completion \nby December 2014, at which time the CIC is expected to be fully operational. As the \ninvestment never happened, the proposed equity investment by ADB in the CIC did not \ncontribute to improving the enabling environment for SMEs. \n \n22.  In the absence of the PCG\u2019s greater utilization and wider adoption through the \ninclusion of other PFIs and different instruments under the amount allocated to SBC, \nthe  facility\u2019s  impact  on  private  sector  development  was  limited  and  well  below \nexpectations. Furthermore, the investment in the CIB never happened (para. 21). Hence, \nthe beyond company impact is rated unsatisfactory. \n     \nb.  Direct Company Impacts \n \n23.  SBC was the only one bank that participated in the project. The expected direct  SBC was the only \ncompany impacts of the PCG facility on SBC were an increase in its lending to SMEs and \none bank that \nan improvement in its operating standards. These impacts should be assessed within \nparticipated in \nthe context of the size of the PCG facility, which was underutilized, and the lack of PFIs \nparticipating in the project.   the project \n \n24.  From 2006 to 2011,9 the outstanding balances of SBC\u2019s loans to micro, small, \nand medium-sized enterprises were fairly constant at about 12% of its customer loans. \nOutstanding balances increased from P4 billion to P11 billion, a compound annual \ngrowth rate of 23%. For micro and small enterprises, however, outstanding balances \ndecreased from P2.3 million at the end of 2006 to P2.0 billion at the end of 2011.10 \nGrowth was clearly occurring within the medium-sized enterprise sector, and the PCF \nfacility was designed to support this growth. However, the amount guaranteed under \nthe project was small relative to the scale of lending, and it was restricted to one kind \nof SME: the URC distributors. SBC was unaware that the facility could also be used to \nguarantee other SME term loans.   \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s PCG had limited impact on SBC operations and its corporate governance \nfor three reasons. (i) ADB imposed a P100 million limit on guarantees for the loans \ninitiated by the primary borrower (URC) since it was an unknown entity at the time of \napproval. The limit was reached in 2010, and it took ADB about 15 months to respond \nto requests by SBC for an increase, at which time internal financing had been provided \nto continue the loan program for URC. The PCG facility was set up to cover PFIs\u2019 \nselected SME exposures, with recourse to the underlying SME assets and not the PFIs\u2019 \nassets.  However,  during  the  course  of  the  project,  there  was  a  change  in  PSOD \n                                                      \n9   Data for 2011 was the latest available. A number of requests were made to SBC for later figures, but they \nwere not provided. \n10  See footnote number 9. ", " \n8  Small and Medium Enterprise Development Support Project \n \n \nmanagement preference in taking financial intermediary risk rather than risk associated \nwith SMEs (ii) Newly formed Office of Risk Management requested SBC to share its risk \nrating model, but because of confidentiality issues, some of the required data was not \nshared  by  SBC  with  ADB.  This  lack  of  disclosure  might  have  contributed  to \nunderutilization of the  facility and resulted in ADB not aggressively pursuing  new \nopportunities and (iii) SBC did not fully understand the potential of the project and \nonly used the facility to provide guarantees for DSLCs. SBC never realized it could also \nuse ADB\u2019s PCG to guarantee general SME term lending, and this also limited the use of \nthe facility.   \n \n26.  Before the project, many of the SME distributors benefiting from the PCG \nfacility had not previously borrowed from SBC. Although SBC indicated it may have \nfinanced the distributors even without the ADB facility, it became more comfortable \nwith these SMEs and extended other credit facilities to them. The PCG facility improved \nSME access to finance (e.g., general lines of credit, bill purchase limits, and short-term \nreceivables financing), which supported the growth of the distributors\u2019 businesses. In \nsome cases, credit was given to other businesses of the borrowers\u2019 sponsor. ADB had \nno appreciable impact on SBC\u2019s risk systems or corporate governance because of its \nlimited interaction with SBC as a result of frequent staff changes within ADB and the \nvery low utilization of the facility.   \n \n27.  Since exposure under the PCG facility carries zero risk weight in computing \nregulatory capital requirements, SBC increased its lending capacity  under  the PCG \nwithout the need for additional capital. This effect was minimal, however, given the \nsmall size and limited utilization of the facility, and the fact that SBC had acceptable \ncapital adequacy ratios well above BSP requirements and those adopted under Basel II. \n \n28.  Transfer of skills to SBC personnel was minimal. While SBC staff learned about \nADB procedures and processes, frequently changing project contacts within ADB and \ndelays in responding resulted in limited skills transfer for SBC staff. \n \n29.  A select few SMEs benefited from the project (with most securing their first \nloans through PCG cover), but SBC was unable to utilize the full allotted facility limit \nand could not leverage its experience with URC to develop a wider client base to use \nthe facility. Due to the relatively small size of the project, it did not have any effect on \nSBC\u2019s capital efficiency. The direct impact on SBC is therefore rated unsatisfactory.  \n \nc.  Overall Assessment of Private Sector Development  \nADB\u2019s   \nexpectation that 30.  ADB\u2019s PCG facility was designed to enhance the financing capacity of SMEs, but \nit was restricted to one bank (SBC) and one instrument (DSLCs). The P1 billion allocated \nthe facility \nfor the facility was small compared to the needs of the sector. ADB\u2019s expectation that \nwould be \nthe facility would be utilized by a number of PFIs and cover a range of SMEs across \nutilized by a sectors was not realized. \nnumber of PFIs  \n31.  Only half of the facility (P500 million) was disbursed, and this disbursement \nand cover a \nwas only allocated to one PFI (SBC). Of this, only P100 million was utilized (10% of the \nrange of SMEs \ntotal facility) by URC distributors. This limited set of borrowers significantly reduced the \nacross sectors \nfacility\u2019s demonstration or multiplier potential. Involving other PFIs and encouraging \nwas not realized SBC to link the facility with other similar financing arrangements would have raised ", "     Evaluation      9 \n \nawareness, encouraged utilization, and allowed faster recycling of ADB\u2019s committed \ncapital over the life of the PCG facility. In the absence of these measures, the facility\u2019s \noverall effect on private sector development is rated unsatisfactory.  \n \n3.  Business Success \n \n32.  The profitability of SBC and the impact that the PCG facility made on a few  There were no \nSMEs are positive accomplishments. There were no defaults or invocation of ADB\u2019s  defaults or \nguarantee. Nevertheless, its business success is rated less than satisfactory because of \ninvocation of \nthe small size of the investment and SBC\u2019s limited use of the facility. The PCG facility is \n \ntherefore unlikely to have made any significant impact on SBC\u2019s profitability.   ADB\u2019s guarantee\n \n33.  The PCG facility\u2019s financial performance and return on invested capital for SBC \nhas been reviewed in the context of the facility\u2019s impact on the intermediary PFI and \nthe SMEs that benefited from enhanced access to credit. However, this assessment is \nconstrained  by  the  small  size  of  the  facility,  its  low  utilization  relative  to  other \noperations of SBC, and the lack of financial information available on the beneficiary \nSMEs.  \n   \n34.  Since SBC\u2019s exposure to the SME market is limited (about 12% of its customer \nloans  outstanding  on  average)  and  because  the  PCG  facility  made  only  a  small \ncontribution to its earnings, it is inappropriate to assess the impact of the PCG facility \non SBC\u2019s profitability. In terms of the impact on SME beneficiaries, information from \nSBC has shown the facility helped some to increase their sales turnover and profits.11 \nMany small distributors at the outset became much larger over time, and a number \nmerged or grew into regional wholesale distributors.  \n \n35.  In terms of SBC\u2019s return on investment capital and financial performance, a \nseparate assessment is impractical given the small size of the facility. As a proxy, SBC\u2019s \nprofitability, which has been consistently above average among banks in Philippines, is \nused to estimate the return on invested capital.12 Average annual return on assets for \nSBC was 2.8% from 2006 to 2012, while the average annual return on shareholder \nequity was 22.9% over the same period. \n   \n  The PCG facility \n4.  Contribution to Economic Development  was used by only \n \none bank, \n36.  Economic sustainability is rated unsatisfactory. The PCG facility would have \nbenefited only \ngenerated new jobs, but because of its limited scale, this impact remained significantly \nbelow  expectations  and  contributed  minimally  to  the  development  of  the  local  one set of SMEs, \neconomy. The PCG facility was used by only one bank, benefited only one set of SMEs,  and achieved \nand achieved only about 10% utilization. While the PCG structure supported local \nonly about 10% \ncurrency lending to SMEs, it has not been replicated since. The PCG\u2019s contribution to \nutilization \neconomic development has been marginal.  \n                                                      \n11 Higher sales turnover and profits can be inferred from the changes in URC\u2019s policy toward its distributors, \nwhich included phasing out smaller distributors and consolidating business with fewer distributors with \nregional coverage. This suggests higher volumes of URC business for these entities. The extent to which \nthis was directly linked with the impacts of the PCG facility cannot be determined. \n12 In its full rating report for SBC in October 2011, Fitch Ratings mentioned that SBC\u2019s profitability, measured \nas return on assets, has historically averaged above 2.5%, or more than double the 1.1% of local peer \nbanks. In 2012, SBC was the top private domestic universal bank in terms of its return on shareholders\u2019 \nequity (22%) and its return on assets (3.3%). Security Bank 2012 Annual Report.   ", " \n10  Small and Medium Enterprise Development Support Project \n \n \n \n5.  Environment, Social, Health, and Safety \n \n37.  The ADB PCG facility for SBC was categorized as a financial intermediary under \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). As a result, subprojects would likely not have had \nsignificant  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  or  indigenous \npeoples. The classification is generally based on what business beneficiaries pursue, and \nthe  SMEs  supported  by  the  PCG  were  mainly  engaged  in  trading  activities.  The \nSupplemental Deed (No.1) to the Guarantee Facility Deed indicated that each qualifying \nSME had to be in full compliance with applicable environmental and social safeguard \nlaws and regulations and not engaged in any activities or businesses prohibited in \nADB\u2019s  exclusion  list.  No  violation  of  Philippine  environment  laws  or  ADB\u2019s  list  of \nprohibited investments was reported.  \n \n38.  SBC has its own environmental policy that requires an environmental clearance \ncertificate on projects where necessary under government regulations. Given SBC\u2019s \ncompliance  with  environmental  standards,  practices  and  procedures,  involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples\u2019  safeguards,  ADB\u2019s  investment  is  rated \nsatisfactory.  \n \nD.  ADB Investment Profitability \n39.  ADB  investment  profitability  on  guarantees  is  evaluated  by  comparing  the \npricing of the guarantee to other ADB portfolio guarantees with similar project and \ncountry  risk  profiles  at  approval.  For  this  project,  however,  there  were  no  other \napprovals with similar project and country risk profiles. The pricing of the guarantees \nwas negotiated with SBC at the time of documentation, and it was supposed to have \nbeen based on the prevailing risks identified during due diligence and comparable fees \nderived elsewhere. There were no  defaults or invocation of ADB\u2019s  guarantee.  The \nfacility  was  grossly  underutilized.    ADB  investment  profitability  is  rated less than \nsatisfactory.  \n \nE.  ADB Work Quality \n40.  ADB's work quality is rated unsatisfactory in terms of its screening, appraisal, \nand structuring of the project as well as its monitoring and supervision. For ADB\u2019s role \nand contribution, the rating is less than satisfactory.  \n \n1.  Screening, Appraisal, and Structuring of the Project \nTime constraints \n \nduring approval \n41.  Due diligence was weak. Only one bank was advanced for participation at the \nmeant that ADB time of appraisal, and since time was limited, a decision was made to defer selection of \ndecided to other PFIs until after approval. There was a failure of ADB to sell the concept to other \nbanks. ADB had initial meetings with several banks,13 including SBC, prior to Board \nidentify other \napproval, but these discussions were not advanced, although ADB shared the project \nPFIs after project \nterm sheet with them. The private sector loan was processed alongside other public \napproval sector components as part of a larger assistance program prepared by ADB. Time \n                                                      \n13  Citibank, Standard Chartered, Unionbank, Planters Bank, and Banco De Oro. ", "     Evaluation     11 \n \nconstraints during approval meant that ADB decided to identify other PFIs after project \napproval.14 Unfortunately, there was not much follow-up by ADB afterwards. The first \nloss provision included in the RRP was never implemented as the guarantee agreement \nbetween SBC and ADB was silent on the issue. SBC considered the first loss provision to \nbe unworkable and requested ADB to drop the provision in the guarantee agreement. \nA first loss provision would have been more appropriate for SBC\u2019s term loans rather \nthan  the  domestic  letters  of  credit  guarantees  under  the  project.  The  guarantee \nagreement was eventually signed 1 year after Board approval, and it did not include \nthe first loss provision. Much of the delay occurred because of SBC\u2019s unfamiliarity with \nADB procedures and operations and the inadequate follow-up by ADB.     \n \n42.  The  concept  of  the  PCG  facility  was  aligned  with  government  and  ADB \nobjectives for encouraging SME sector development. The decision to select SBC as the \nfirst bank under the facility in 2006 was made on the basis of limited screening.  \nAlthough SBC had an acceptable credit profile, was profitable, and had an adequate \ncapital structure, its SME financing had been relatively small.15 At appraisal, SBC was \nthe 15th largest bank in Philippines, but it did not have an extensive retail branch \nnetwork, and it lacked established relationships with SMEs. It was expected that SBC \nwould expand its SME business and widen its associated services. However, in the \nabsence of businesses similar to URC that were willing to participate in the use of the \nPCG,  growth  in  SME  lending  by  SBC  was  below  expectations.  Furthermore,  the \nmisunderstanding between SBC and ADB on the wider use of the guarantee, especially \nfor term lending, also contributed to the low utilization of the facility.  \n \n43.  Because of the low utilization, the participation of only one bank, inadequate \npricing at the outset, and the fact that ADB did not apply the first loss provision that \nwas included in the RRP approval in the guarantee agreement, ADB's performance in \nscreening, appraisal, and structuring is rated unsatisfactory. \n \n2.  Monitoring and Supervision \n \n44.  The shortfalls in monitoring and supervision of the PCG facility are illustrated by  The constant \nthe lack of new PFIs being selected and its low utilization. Not enough was done to \nchanging of ADB \nidentify and select other PFIs, while the considerable delay in following up on the \nstaff contacts \nrequest of SBC to increase its allocation to URC contributed to the poor performance of \nthe facility. The constant changing of ADB staff contacts meant there was no continuity  meant there was \nof supervision. Had there been better monitoring and supervision, the lack of progress  no continuity of \nwould have been identified earlier. Since monitoring and supervision was not proactive \nsupervision \nin identifying problems or issues, it is rated unsatisfactory.  \n \n3.  ADB's Role and Contribution \n \n45.  The PCG facility was structured and operated in line with ADB\u2019s operating \nstrategies and policies. However, efforts to raise awareness and encourage use of the \nfacility by other Philippine banks and other clients of SBC were below expectations.  \n \n                                                      \n14  At the time there was a rushed schedule for approval, since the PSOD was part of a larger project \nchampioned by the Southeast Asia Regional Department that was ready and included a public sector \ncomponent that had been prepared earlier.  \n15 In 2005, SBC did not have a well-defined SME portfolio and only had limited coverage. Its SME exposure, at \n$20 million, was less than 1% of its total customer loan portfolio. ", " \n12  Small and Medium Enterprise Development Support Project \n \n \n46.  Delays in the approval of SBC\u2019s request to increase the allocation limits for URC \nwere largely due to insufficient staff resources within ADB to process the extensive \nnumber of documents required to enroll each new SME. When the P100 million limit \nwas reached, URC stopped enrolling new distributors and ADB did not intervene to \ncreate additional capacity. Also, as part of its approval process, the newly formed Office \nof Risk Management requested that SBC share its risk rating model, but some of the \nrequired data was not provided. This might have contributed to ADB\u2019s slow response. \nNevertheless, ADB should have undertaken better due diligence at appraisal, which \nmight have enabled it to delegate authority to SBC to enroll each new distributor.  \n \n47.  PSOD was not keen to take direct SME risk, preferring financial intermediary \nrisk. This might have ultimately contributed to underutilization of the facility, as new \nopportunities were not aggressively pursued. Since ADB could have done more and \nbeen better organized, its role and contribution is rated less than satisfactory. \n \nF.  ADB Additionality   \nADB\u2019s \nadditionality \n48.  The concept was innovative and had the potential to leverage ADB funds for \nwould have  SMEs if it had been implemented more effectively. The weak monitoring by ADB, its \nbeen rated  requirements  for  data  that  proved  impossible  for  SBC  to  provide  on  grounds  of \nconfidentiality, the changes of staff and policies within the PSOD, and the failure to \nhigher if the \nidentify new PFIs all point to less than satisfactory performance. \nfacility had been \n  \nadopted by at  49.  ADB has not applied the PCG to other projects in the Philippines or elsewhere.  \nleast a few more   \n50.  ADB took the initiative in designing and structuring the facility and undertook \nPFIs or benefited \nall screening and appraisal. ADB\u2019s additionality would have been rated higher if the \na wider set of \nfacility had been adopted by at least a few more PFIs or benefited a wider set of SME \nSME clients of  clients of SBC. Additionality is rated less than satisfactory. \nSBC   \nG.  Overall Evaluation \n51.

Issues and Lessons \n52.  This review offers the following lessons.  \n \n53.  Carefully assess effective demand for new instruments. For projects where \nsimilar models do not exist in the local market, more exhaustive studies and analyses of \nthe demand and willingness to pay for guarantees covering SME exposure should take \nplace. \n \n54.  An adequate pipeline is needed. More care is needed in establishing a pipeline \nof PFIs. Due diligence was weak, preventing the participation of more banks before \napproval or immediately afterwards. Given more participants, the volume of guarantees \nwould  have  increased  and  a  wider  variety  of  SMEs  could  have  taken  part.  More \nexhaustive due diligence is needed in the future, especially in identifying and assessing \nPFIs. Poor monitoring and supervision of the project by ADB contributed to the low \nutilization of the facility. ADB should have been able to identify the issues, problems, \nand  lack  of  progress  more  effectively,  and  it  should  have  been  more  flexible  in \nchanging the project during implementation.  \n \n55.  Pricing needs to reflect market demand. The formal price change from ADB \ncame too late to make a difference, since by then the price waivers had been granted. \nLikewise the first loss provision outlined in the RRP was dropped from the guarantee \nagreement between ADB and SBC.  \n   \n56.  Lack  of  replicability.  There  has  neither  been  a  follow-up  project  in  the \nThe issue of Philippines, nor has ADB financed a similar project elsewhere in the Asia Pacific region. \nThe  issue  of  taking on  SME  risk  against  that  of  the  financial  intermediary  needs \ntaking on SME \nresolution before its further application. The PCG facility could potentially be adopted \nrisk against that \nin a number of ADB\u2019s developing member countries, but further work is required to \nof the financial adequately  measure  and  assess  the  risk-return  benefits  of  the  instrument  for \nintermediary stakeholders.  Many  variations  are  possible,  such  as  different  stop-loss  levels; \ndifferentiated risk sharing; financial instruments for different uses (e.g., trade financing, \nneeds resolution \nequipment purchases, and other capital investment); and working capital. Some of \nbefore its further \nthese adjustments can be explored to assess whether the PCG can be made more \napplication \nflexible and better tailored to local conditions. \n     ", "      Issues, Lessons, and Recommendations     15 \n \n \n57.  Underestimating  the  impact  of  staff  changes.  PSOD  preferred  to  assume \nfinancial intermediary risk rather than risk associated with SMEs, which contributed to \nthe delay in raising the credit limit to URC and the selection of new PFIs. ADB staff \nchanges  at the  project  officer  level  confused  SBC  and  contributed  to  the  lack  of \ncontinuity and consistency of efforts by ADB. \n \n58.  Better  due  diligence  of  financial  intermediaries  is  required.  ADB  did  not \nadequately assess the risk rating process of SBC or do enough work to understand its \nprocesses and procedures. A better understanding of SBC would have enabled ADB to \nassume more decision-making responsibility on the implementation of the facility. In \naddition,  ADB  should  have  undertaken  due  diligence  of  other  potential  PFIs  at \nappraisal. Leaving the decision to SBC about which SMEs could participate would not \nhave required extensive  ADB staff involvement after PFI selection and might have \nencouraged other banks to participate. \n \n59.  Need  to  proactively  monitor  facility  utilization.  The  need  for  effective \nmonitoring was stressed in the RRP, but it was not carried our satisfactorily. Monitoring \nfacility utilization was necessary to guide restructuring, realignment, and modifications, \nand, where required, to cancel allocations so ADB capital could be deployed more \nefficiently. ADB originally expected that over time, the PCG facility would allow PFIs to \nbecome  familiar  with  SME  risks  and  provide  guarantees  for  a  wider  range  of \ninstruments,  which  would  have  prompted  more  PFIs  to  participate.  This  outcome \nwould have required better and more proactive monitoring of the utilization of the \nfacility, which would have prompted the inclusion of new PFIs and allowed for a wider \nset of clients and instruments to be tested. Although the PCG facility was approved and \nmade available to partner banks for 8 years, ineffective monitoring led to cancellations \nrather than the reallocation of guarantees, availability periods, and tenors.   \n \nB.  Recommended Follow-up Actions \n60.  Three actions are recommended for future projects.  \n \n61.  Improve due diligence and screening. ADB should identify, select, and sign up a  A pipeline of \nnumber of PFIs before approval of future projects. Appropriate  screening and rigorous \nPFIs for the PCG \ndue  diligence  of  their  lending  processes  and  practices,  risk  management  systems, \nfacility should be \ncollateral requirements,  debt recovery procedures,  financial performance, and SME \nmarket profiles would enable future participants to assume more autonomy in decision  determined and \nmaking and reduce the burden on ADB back office support. A pipeline of PFIs and  agreed before \npotential SME clients and a pricing structure for the PCG facility that reflects prevailing \nthe approval of \nmarket conditions and practices should be determined and agreed before the approval \nfuture projects \nof future projects. \n \n62.  Make the transaction more replicable. The implementation of the PCG facility \nwas an innovative approach that could be modified to better reflect stakeholder (SMEs, \nfinancial  institutions,  and  ADB)  requirements.  These  modifications  could  include \ngranting more autonomy in decision making to the PFIs, offering better market-based \npricing for the facility, and promoting its wider use to cover guarantees for term \nlending  to  SMEs  as  well  as  covering  DSLCs.  These  changes  could  help  make  the \ntransaction more replicable.    \n ", " \n16  Small and Medium Enterprise Development Support Project \n \n \n63.  Improve monitoring capacity. ADB needs to improve its monitoring of project \nprogress  and  be  more  flexible  in  responding  to  changes  needed  during \nimplementation. More effective follow-up and interaction with PFIs by ADB staff is \nessential  to  identify  problems  and  issues  before  they  become  serious  and  delay \nimplementation.

Project Highlights \n1.  Background  \n1.  The Small and Medium Enterprise Development Support Project was the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) response to a request from the Government of the Philippines  to support small and \nmedium-sized enterprise (SME) development as part of the government\u2019s effort to reduce poverty \nthrough private sector development and employment generation. The project\u2019s impact was to improve \nSME contributions to economic growth and employment, and its outcome was to improve the enabling \nenvironment for SMEs and facilitate greater access to finance. This aligned with the 10-point agenda of \nthe government\u2019s Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan 2004\u20132010, which targeted creating at \nleast 6 million jobs in 6 years.1  \n \n2.  A project preparatory technical assistance analyzed the status of SMEs in the Philippines, \nincluding the government\u2019s development policies and actions, and the issues and constraints facing the \nsector.2 The study found that SMEs contributed 32% to value addition and accounted for 31% of \nemployment. Despite the sector\u2019s significant contributions, SME operation has been constrained by \npoor access to finance as a result of (i) banks\u2019 reluctance to expand their SME lending following the \nAsian financial crisis because of a perceived higher cost and risk, and (ii) the difficulties SMEs face in \npreparing and presenting credible business plans and realistic cash flow estimates, and in providing \nacceptable collateral. Commercial banks generally secure SME lending on formal collateral (e.g., hard \nassets and chattel mortgages) rather than on project cash flows or future revenues. \n \n3.  The  project  was  designed  to  support  the  findings  of  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance and was consistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update, 2004\u20132006 for the \nPhilippines,3  which  focused  on  public\u2013private  partnerships  for  sustainable  SME  development.  The \nproject was designed to support SME development through (i) a credit line of $25 million to the Small \nBusiness Guarantee and Finance Corporation for relending to SMEs, (ii) a partial credit guarantee (PCG) \nof P1 billion to other commercial banks to expand their SME portfolios, and (iii) an equity investment of \n$1 million in a proposed credit information bureau (CIB). The credit line was to be backed by a \nguarantee from the Republic of the Philippines as the public component of ADB\u2019s intervention. The PCG \nfacility and the equity investment were structured as a private transaction and are the subject of this \nevaluation.  \n2.  Key Features \n \n4.  The PCG facility was structured as a revolving local currency credit enhancement instrument in \nfavor of local participating financial institutions (PFIs) that guaranteed agreed risks associated with \ntheir portfolios of loans or other credit exposure, including guarantees or letters of credit extended to \nSME borrowers selected according to specified criteria. The PCG facility aimed to encourage PFIs to \nassume exposure to medium-sized enterprises, while the $25 million public sector loan to the Small \nBusiness Guarantee and Finance Corporation focused on microenterprises and other small enterprises. \nThis split was undertaken to widen the reach of ADB\u2019s SME development program.  \n \n5.  This PCG was structured to encourage the participation of PFIs by limiting their risk with \nrecourse limited only to the underlying guaranteed portfolio and not to the PFIs\u2019 balance sheet. While a \n                                                      \n1 National Economic and Development Authority. 2005. Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan, 2004\u20132010. Manila. \n2 ADB. 2003.

Manila \n     ", "Project Highlights and Implementation  19 \n \nPFI faced operating and indirect credit risk,4 this risk was reduced by the PFI\u2019s specifying portfolio \nexposure and selection criteria for the SMEs for which ADB would assume risk, and selection and \nmonitoring. The facility was intended for primarily top-tier domestic banks and finance institutions in \nthe Philippines with some experience in SME lending and well-established underwriting procedures. \nSome of them were accredited in ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Facilitation Program.5  \n \n6.  Under the facility, ADB set a limit of P1 billion to be allocated among selected PFIs, with 50\u2013\n50 risk-sharing agreement requiring PFIs to guarantee P1 billion. The limit for each PFI was set at P500 \nmillion. ADB intended to negotiate a provision of first loss assumed entirely by the PFI. The amount of \nfirst loss cover was to be based on the loss experience of each PFI over the preceding 3 years.6 The \nunderlying rationale for proposing a first loss provision was to better ensure complete alliance of \ninterest. \n \n7.  A maximum exposure per borrower was set at P25.0 million, translating to a maximum ADB \nguarantee of P12.5 million per borrower. The selection criteria for SME borrowers were defined by the \nPFI and ADB. The SME had to be a branded distributor of Universal Robina Corporation (URC), have a \nsales turnover not exceeding P1 billion, and be locally incorporated. URC was tasked to undertake due \ndiligence through an independent valuation of each distributor. Each distributor should have had at \nleast 2 years of trading history with URC or been in the distributor business servicing its current \ngeographic area for at least 2 years. In addition, each distributor should have been profitable for the \npreceding 2 years and must be in full compliance with relevant environmental and social safeguard \nlaws and regulations and not engage in any business on the Exclusion List.7 These arrangements were \ncritical since, unlike other credit facilities, the PCG exposed ADB to the credit risk of the portfolio of \nSMEs selected through the normal underwriting practices of the PFI. There was a maximum loss limit \nunder the facility, which was to function as a trigger and allow ADB to review the continuation of the \nfacility if losses or claims under the guarantee exceeded anticipated amounts.  \n  \n8.  The PCG facility was available for 5 years, with the maximum loan tenor capped at 3 years, \neffectively making the facility available for 8 years. Pricing was to be determined for each transaction \nbased on ADB\u2019s share of exposure booked under the facility, which was capped at 50% of the nominal \namount. The pricing of the project was negotiated with Security Bank Corporation (SBC) at the time of \ndocumentation based on the prevailing risks identified during due diligence.  \nB.  Implementation \n9.  ADB had initial meetings with a number of banks,8 including SBC, prior to Board approval, but \nthese discussions were not advanced, although ADB shared the project term sheet with them. Since the \npublic sector component was ready for appraisal and the private sector one was only added later, time \nconstraints meant that ADB decided to identify other PFIs after project approval. Unfortunately, there \nwas limited follow-up by ADB after loan approval, largely because of limited back office staff resources. \n  \n10.  Board approval of the project was in September 2005. The selection of SBC as the first PFI was \nendorsed by the guarantee committee in September 2006. The Guarantee Facility Deed was signed \nwith SBC for a maximum amount of P500 million in April 2007.  \n \n                                                      \n4  In an indirect manner, insolvency or a material weakening in the credit standing of a PFI would weaken its ability to monitor \nthe portfolio of guaranteed exposures and maintain specified portfolio parameters, thereby increasing the default risk of the \nportfolio and ADB\u2019s risk as a partial guarantor. \n5  ADB. 2003.

Under the \nPCG, ADB provided a 50% guarantee on the DSLCs issued by SBC on behalf of these SMEs in favor of \n.\nURC 9 URC required these qualifying instruments (the DSLCs) under the facility agreement to extend \ntrade credit to the SMEs.10 Distributors were selected according to a prescribed set of credit policies \nand procedures adopted by SBC in consultation with ADB. SBC directly assumed 50% of the DSLC \namount.  \n \n12.  Documentation between ADB and SBC (the supplemental deed of the guarantee) outlined a \nnumber of eligibility requirements for URC distributors\u2019 inclusion in the facility to (i) ensure that SBC \nused the facility solely for lending to SMEs\u2014setting a sales turnover threshold of P1 billion per \nannum\u2014and (ii) mitigate the credit risk to ADB\u2014all short-listed distributors were to have at least 2 \nyears of either dealing with URC or related business experience in their current geographical areas, and \nhave been operating profitably for the past 2 years with positive retained earnings. In addition, SBC \nsubjected every transaction to independent due diligence before recommending it to ADB for approval.  \n \n13.  As facility utilization rose almost to the approved limit, SBC requested in November 2009 an \nincrease in the amount allocated to URC distributors from P100 million to P250 million, which was \nwithin SBC\u2019s P500 million approved limit. However, the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) \ndid not respond until 15 months later. By that time there had been a steady drop in utilization because \nSBC  had  stopped  enrolling  new  distributors  into  the  project  on  the  advice  of  ADB,  which  had \nrecommended postponing new enrollments of instruments to stay within the prescribed amount.    \n \n14.  In January 2011, ADB indicated to SBC that it could resume access to the P100 million limit \nsince utilization had fallen below the limit since February 2010. However, SBC still failed to use the \nallocated amount, and no new transactions were booked by SBC for URC dealers. Although it tried with \nother entities, SBC did not formally propose any new participants to use the remaining P400 million. \nSBC failed to introduce new participants because the pricing of the guarantee was considered to be too \nexpensive, and many of the distributors did not bank with SBC and were unwilling to change their \nbanking arrangements. Also, SBC mistakenly thought the facility could only be used for DSLCs.  \n \n15.  Another reason for the lower utilization in 2011 was the reorganization of URC\u2019s distribution \nnetwork, which reduced the number of distributors and encouraged exclusive arrangements with larger \ndistributors.  Although  the  volume  of  business  handled  by  URC  distributors  increased,  this \nreorganization reduced the number of distributors eligible for ADB\u2019s agreed guarantee coverage (based \non turnover), although current participants remained eligible even if their turnover was greater than \nthe limit. However, URC\u2019s demand for the facility fell with no new enrollments.  \n \n  \n17.  Under the P100 million limit for URC distributors, 16 qualifying SME wholesalers received \ncredit support under the PCG facility after it became effective in 2007. By April 2012, SBC had issued 65 \nDSLCs to the 16 distributors amounting to P430 million, 50% of which was guaranteed by ADB. No \ndefault or invocation of ADB\u2019s guarantee has been recorded.11  \n \n18.  In February 2011, the PSOD cancelled the remaining unallocated balance of P500 million. The \ncancellation note observed that no other suitable banks had been selected as a facility PFI because of \n                                                      \n9  These SMEs were branded customer food and beverage group distributors of URC incorporated in the Philippines and with \nannual sales turnover not exceeding P1 billion. \n10 In more conventional terms, this is a typical channel financing arrangement, wherein a relatively strong and well-established \nentity supports the financing of its distribution or channel partners by entering into a distribution or dealership arrangement \nwith them. This strengthens the distributors\u2019 business and financial profiles and provides a more secure basis for a bank to \nextend credit. \n11 ADB. 2012.

There was no further \njustification for these statements, which are inconsistent with the following factors: (i) SBC is a bank \nwith  moderate  creditworthiness,  and  several  banks,  including  those  participating  in  ADB\u2019s  Trade \nFinance Facilitation Program, are equally or more creditworthy;12 (ii) SME lending is and has been a \nprimary focus of the Government of the Philippines, and new regulatory requirements on minimum \nlending to the SME sector; and (iii) SBC utilized almost all its approved facility limit for URC, and it \nrequested increases to the limit for URC distributors.  \n \n19.  The proposed equity investment in the CIB was cancelled in February 2011 because (i) the \nownership structure deviated from that originally approved in the report and recommendation of the \nPresident (RRP) and (ii) another board approval would have been necessary if the investment had been \npursued further. In 2008, the Credit Information Corporation (CIC) was established, but its ownership \nstructure changed from that originally envisaged. Instead of a private company, CIC was set up as a \ngovernment-owned and controlled corporation, with 60% of its shares owned by the public sector. At \napproval, the target date for the ADB investment was the end of 2005, as soon as legislation had been \npassed and investments finalized by all sponsors. It was envisaged that the CIB would be established as \na corporate entity under the Corporation Code, with Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas owning 49% of the \ncompany and the balance by private sector institutions, related industry associations, strategic partners, \nand ADB. Guardianship of CIC is under the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission and not \nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, as originally proposed. Legislation was only passed in 2008, and the \nSecurities  and  Exchange  Commission  submitted  the  proposed  rules  and  guidelines  for  the \nestablishment of CIC to the Congressional Oversight Committee for review in May 2009. These ruled \nand guidelines were approved in January 2010, and the board of CIC was set up in 2010 with the chair \nof  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  as  its  head.  CIC  is  expected  be  fully  operational  by \nDecember 2014. CIC is currently receiving advisory services financed by the  International Finance \nCorporation to support the establishment of a credit information system in line with international best \npractice standards.   \n \n20.  The initial price, which was evidently included in the facility documents, was based on a \nsample price range. It was never actually applied to any transaction under the PCG facility, which was \ndetermined on a case-by-case basis. Pricing included the arrangement for compensating the PFI for \nadministrative costs incurred implementing the facility. \n \n21.  In February 2011, nearly 3 years after the first transaction with SBC, the PSOD cancelled the \nunallocated balance of P500 million. The proposed $1 million equity investment in the CIB was also \ncancelled in February 2011 because the corporation established by the government (CIC) deviated from \nthe structure originally approved in the RRP. The last qualifying instrument under SBC\u2019s URC program \nexpired in February 2011, and there were no new enrollments afterwards. The Guarantee Facility Deed \nofficially reached its end of availability period without any outstanding qualifying instrument on 26 \nApril 2012, and the PCG facility was terminated on the same day. \n   \n                                                      \n12  ADB. 2003.

Only 16 \nSME URC wholesalers received credit under the \nfacility.  Some  65  DSLCs  amounting  to  P430 \nmillion were issued by SBC, 50% of which were \nguaranteed  by  ADB.  SBC  never  used  the \nremaining balance of P400 million since it was \nunaware  that  the  facility  could  be  used  to \nguarantee other SME term lending, as well as the \nDSLCs for URC distributors. In February 2011, \nADB cancelled the unallocated balance of the \nP500 million. Because of its small size and the \nfact that there was only one PFI, the facility had \nlimited  impact  outside  and  inside  SBC.
