A design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n2. \nUzbekistan's economy grew at an annual average rate of 7% during 2004\u20132006 and 9% \nin 2007\u20132008. Despite the global financial and economic crisis, growth prospects for 2010 and \nbeyond are expected to be within a range of 8%\u20139%. The country has taken a gradual rather \nthan  rapid  shock  approach  to  reform,  and  the  response  to  the  crisis  was  swift,  balanced,  and \nsuccessful.  \n \n3. \nUzbekistan  has  the  most  industrialized  and  energy  intensive  economy  in  Central  Asia. \nFor each dollar of gross domestic product, Uzbekistan uses 60% more energy than Azerbaijan \nand  Kazakhstan,  and  four  times  more  than  the  world  average;1 this  stems  from  (i)  aging  and \ndilapidated energy  infrastructure,  (ii)  a  low  technological  base,  (iii)  lack  of  investment,  and  (iv) \ninefficiency.  \n \n4. \nEnergy efficiency is now a top strategic priority for Uzbekistan, as well as for the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB), 2 and  represents  the  best  means  (in  terms  of  reducing  cost  and \ncarbon  intensity)  to  achieve  energy  security.  It  reduces  the  currently  high  levels  of  energy \nintensity,  and  increases  energy  productivity.  The  social  and  economic  benefits  are  also  high. \nConsumers spend less, power generation and dispatch costs fall and the financial return to the \nutilities  increase.  Increased  revenues  underpin  more  investment,  better  maintenance,  and \nimproved service quality. \n \n5. \nThe  government  has  in  place  policy  and  legal  frameworks  to  reduce  energy  intensity \nlevels  and  cut  losses,  and  has  plans  for  significant  clean  technology  investments  and \ninstitutional reforms.  In  the  short  to medium  term  (2009\u20132014),  power  generation capacity  will \nneed  to  increase  considerably  to  match  electricity  demand  growth  of  3.1%\u20135.4%  a  year.  The \nconstruction  of  new  and  more  efficient  combined  cycle  gas  turbine  (CCGT)  plants  fit  the \nstrategy.  Other  actions  include  expanding  renewable  energy,  energy  efficiency  programs,  the \nreplacement or rehabilitation of old and obsolete thermal power plants, and energy trade. \n \n6. \nInvestment in CCGT technology leads to high energy savings and environmental benefits. \nIt is the cleanest fossil fuel-based method of power generation available, and CCGT power plants \nburning natural gas produce significantly less carbon emissions than do coal- and oil-fired thermal \npower plants. \n \nUzbekistan is rich in hydrocarbon resources.3 Another strategic priority is the processing \n7. \n(or  value-added  production)  of  these  resources  for  both  domestic  and  foreign  markets.  This \nstrategy  requires  substantial  investment  and  investors,  with  transactions  most  likely  structured \naround a range of public and private initiatives, several of which are under consideration. \n                                                 \n1  International Energy Agency. 2009. World Energy Outlook. Paris. \n2  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n3  Uzbekistan  is  estimated  to  have  1.8  trillion  cubic  meters  of  proven  natural  gas  reserves,  590  million  barrels  of \n\nproven oil reserves, and 3 billion tons of recoverable coal reserves. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nIncreased  energy  production  in  Uzbekistan  directly  benefits  several  countries  in  the \n8. \nregion. Afghanistan already gets most of its electricity from Uzbekistan. Other beneficiaries are \nTajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic, both of which are rich in hydro resources but prone to winter \nshortages.  The  Uzbek  power  transmission  system  also  facilitates  transfer  of  power  supplies \nbetween these two countries and Turkmenistan. Uzbekistan is a natural gas exporter, including \nto  the  People's  Republic  of  China.  In  the  medium  term,  Uzbekistan  will  also  pursue  power \nexports to new energy-deficit markets such as Pakistan.  \n \nUzbekistan is an active participant in the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \n9. \nProgram  (CAREC),  which  includes  Afghanistan,  Azerbaijan,  People's  Republic  of  China, \nKazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, and Tajikistan. In 2008, the CAREC countries agreed \non  a  long-term  strategy  for  developing  the  region's  energy  sector,  which  focuses  on  energy \nsecurity  and  trade. 4 In  October  2009,  the  countries  agreed  on  a  framework  action  plan  to \nexpand  the  regional  power  network  as  a  means  to  increase  trade  in  power.5 ADB  and  other \nmultilateral  institutions  participating  in  CAREC  are  cofinancing  studies,  capacity  development, \nand  investments.  It  was  under  this  framework  that  Uzbekistan  started  exporting  power  to \nAfghanistan (up to 150 megawatts [MW]) in early 2009; these exports will soon rise to 300 MW.  \n \n10. \nPower  generation.  In  2008,  Uzbekistan  generated  50,254  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  of \nelectric power, imported 925 GWh from its neighbors, and exported about 630 GWh. The total \ninstalled capacity for power generation is 12,400 MW, but less than 10,000 MW are available. \nThermal  power  plants  (TPPs)  represent  86%  and  hydropower  plants  14%  of  the  capacity. \nNatural  gas  is  used  for  94%  of  thermal  power  generation.  All  TPPs  run  on  steam  cycle \ntechnology with an efficiency rate of 31%, compared to 57% under advanced CCGT technology. \nTotal  losses  (net  generation  output  less  invoiced  energy)  are  20%  of  generated  energy.  The \nheavy  reliance  on  and  inefficient  use  of  fossil  fuels  in  power  generation  creates  negative \nenvironmental impacts, while CCGT power plants reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n11.  Most  assets  are  40\u201350  years  old,  and  require  replacement  and/or  rehabilitation.  Since \n1991, only two power generation capacity expansion projects have been completed. By 2015, \nthe  government  wants  to  replace  570  MW  of  inefficient  (25%  efficiency),  outdated  generation \ncapacity  and  install  three  CCGT  power  plants  totaling  1,600  MW.  Construction  of  two  such \nprojects in Tashkent and Navoi began in 2009. The third project is the one proposed here. \n \n12. \nPower transmission. The transmission system consists of 1,850 kilometers (km) of 500 \nkilovolt (kV) lines, 6,200 km of 220 kV lines, and 15,300 km of 110 kV lines. The high voltage \nsystem is connected to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. It also has \na 220 kV connection with Afghanistan. The transmission system is ageing and needs upgrading. \nTransmission bottlenecks are becoming a serious obstacle to the delivery of power to domestic \nand regional customers.  \n \n13. \nThe  southern  region  of  Uzbekistan  receives  electricity  from  the  northern  region,  where \n70%  of  power  generation  is  located.  However,  over  90%  of  gas  production  is  located  in  the \nsouth. This means gas is transported to the north for conversion to electricity, which is then sent \nback  to  customers  in  the  south.  In  2009,  the  electricity  peak  demand  in  the  southern  region \nsurpassed 2,000 MW, but the north\u2013south transmission capacity is limited to about 1,600 MW, \nresulting in shortages during peak hours. This energy flow problem is compounded by growing \nindustrialization in the south. The CCGT power plants to be constructed in Talimarjan and Navoi \n\n                                                 \n4  CAREC Seventh Ministerial Conference. 2008.

They  will  also  free  up  transmission  capacity to  supply  neighboring \ncountries. \n \nThe state joint stock company, Uzbekenergo, the sole power sector utility in the country, \n14. \nis a vertically integrated and publicly owned monopoly. It owns and operates 10 TPPs (including \nthree  cogeneration  plants),  and  28  hydropower  plants.  It  owns  and  operates  the  power \ntransmission network. It also distributes power to all categories of customers from its 14 regional \ndistribution  centers,  which  have  256  distribution  units.  A  restructuring  of  Uzbekenergo  is \nplanned. The key objective is to commercialize its utility operations and introduce competition in \nvarious business lines.  \n \nTo realize the power system modernization and rehabilitation program, Uzbekenergo will \n15. \ncontinue  to  seek  investment  from  international  lenders  and  the  private  sector.  To  secure \nfinance, it plans to (i) modernize its accounting system with a financial management information \nsystem,  (ii)  improve  financial  transparency  in  line  with  international  auditing  standards  and \nreporting practices, and (iii) review the internal financial management structure by establishing \ninternal auditing.  \n \n16. \nUzbekenergo  wants  to  transform  its  management  and  operations  to  become  a  model \npower utility company in the region. This requires new skills, new business practices, and new \ntechnology.  The  management  of  Uzbekenergo  is  committed  to  change.  Uzbekenergo  also \nneeds expert technical capacity to operate CCGTs. \n \nB. \n\nProject Impact and Outcome \n\n17. \nThe project involves a new power plant to improve energy security and facilitate regional \nenergy trade. It also aims to increase energy efficiency and save energy through clean power \ngeneration.  Supporting  investments  will  increase  regional  connectivity,  and  improve  power \nsector performance and management, and customer service. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n18. \nOutputs are physical and nonphysical in nature. Power supply will be increased by 4,700 \nGWh  per  year,  and  power  generation  efficiency  will  increase  from  31%  to  50%.  The  power \nsystem will operate more reliably, and Uzbekenergo's corporate management and performance \nwill be improved.  \n\n \nPhysical \n\n1. \n\nTwo CCGT  units (370\u2013450 MW each) will be constructed at the Talimarjan TPP. Each \n19. \nunit  will  include  (i)  a  gas  turbine  with  electrical  generator;  (ii)  heat  recovery  steam  generator \n(HRSG);  (iii)  steam  turbine  with  electrical  generator;  (iv)  deaerator  unit;  (v)  steam  condenser; \nand  (vi)  ancillary  equipment  including  generator  transformer,  systems  for  control,  electrical \nswitching,  oil,  water  and  gas  treatment,  cooling  water,  and  all  other  plant  auxiliaries. \nConstruction will be done by an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor. \nThe EPC contract scope covers detailed design, selection of equipment, installation, testing and \ncommissioning.  The  first  unit  will  be  commissioned  in  March  2014,  and  the  second  unit  in \nDecember  2014.  An  implementation  consultant  will  supervise  the  construction  and  report  on \nprogress. \n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nA  community  service  center  will  also  be  built  for  the  power  plant  employees  and  their \n20. \nfamilies. Uzbekenergo will use this center for (i) vocational training for female family members; \n(ii) finance for microenterprises such as a laundry service, salon, bakery, cafe and a handicrafts \nworkshop;  (iii)  training  on  various  social  issues  (such  as  hygiene,  preventive  medical,  family \nplanning, and child rearing); (iv) cultural activities; and (v) sports and recreational activities. \n \n\n2. \n\nNonphysical \n\nA  special  capacity  development  component  will  support \n\nimprovement  of \n21. \nUzbekenergo\u2019s  management,  financial,  and  operational  performance.  Key  areas  are:  (i) \ncorporate management, (ii) financial management systems and audit capabilities, (iii) operation \nand maintenance of CCGT power plants, and (iv) social and gender development aspects. The \nprogram  will  start  with  a  comprehensive  needs  assessment.  Experts  will  be  engaged  to  help \nUzbekenergo  with  the  work.  The  necessary  equipment,  software,  training,  and  consulting \nservices will be financed under the project.  \n\nthe \n\n \nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,280  million.

The \n800  MW  gas-fired  steam-cycle  unit  (unit  1)  was  commissioned  in  2004.  The  original  design \nenvisaged  four  such  units  (total  capacity  of  3,200  MW),  and  the  power  plant  infrastructure\u2014\nincluding power evacuation, gas supply, and cooling water systems, and a dedicated rail access \nfrom  the  main  railroad  network\u2014has  been  constructed  for  that  capacity.  Power  is  evacuated \nthrough  the  220  kV  network.  The  project's  proposed  power  transmission  facility  will  improve \nevacuation  reliability  by  connecting  the  CCGT  units  to  the  500  kV  network.  Natural  gas  is \nsupplied  from  the  Shuritan  gas  field  and  processing  facilities  located  about  30  km  from  the \nTalimarjan  TPP.  Supply  comes  through  the  main  pipeline  system  through  a  dedicated  gate \nstation (2 km from the plant). Gas reserves and supply capacity of 953 million cubic meters (m3) \nper year is assured for the life of the CCGT plant. Water is supplied from the Amu Darya River \nthrough the Karshi Main Canal (KMC), a multipurpose water supply system that runs adjacent to \nthe  plant.  The  KMC  is  also  connected  to  the  Talimarjan  Reservoir  located  8  km  south  of  the \nplant (1.5 billion m3 capacity), which can serve as a water supply source in times of shortage. \n\n                                                 \n7  Detailed due diligence reports are referenced in the list of linked documents (Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n29. \nThe  CCGT  technology  is  the  most  efficient  and  cleanest  power  generation  option \ncurrently available. A CCGT plant can achieve efficiency levels of up to 60%. It uses (i) a gas \nturbine  (similar  to  an  aircraft  jet  engine)  burning  natural  gas,  with  air  to  drive  a  generator  and \nproduce  electric  power;  (ii)  a  HRSG,  which  recovers  more  of  the  energy  released  by  the \ncombustion  process  that  occurs  in  the  gas  turbine;  and  (iii)  a  steam  turbine,  which  uses  the \nsteam produced in the HRSG to generate more power. CCGT systems are a  well-established \ntechnology  and  are  typically  supplied  as  package  items.  The  design  of  the  CCGT  plant  is \nintended to ensure safe and efficient operation in different operating modes including start-up, \nfull-load,  load-change,  shut-down,  and  emergency  shut-down.  This  is  achieved  through  the \noptions of closed- and open-cycle operation, the selection of thermal plant operating pressures \nand temperatures, steam turbine configurations, and the control systems. The efficiency of the \ntwo CCGT units for the project is 57.4% (this compares to 34%\u201337% for steam-cycle unit 1).  \n \n30. \nThere will be an associated power transmission facility comprising a 500 kV single-circuit \ntransmission  line  (218  km)  from  Talimarjan  TPP  to  Sogdiana  substation,  and  a  500  kV \nsubstation  adjacent  to  Talimarjan  TPP.  This  will  increase  power  evacuation  and  transmission \ncapacity, and strengthen the transmission system reliability. The facility will be commissioned by \n2013, and will be financed by the World Bank and Uzbekenergo. The safeguards due diligence \nand actions plans for this investment will follow World Bank guidelines.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n31. \nThe project is economically and financially viable. The economic internal rate of return is \n20.3%.  The  economic  benefits  are  calculated  by  weighting  the  project's  contribution  to \nincremental  (increased  electricity  consumption)  and  non-incremental  (energy  savings  and \ncarbon  emission  reduction)  aspects.  The  sensitivity  tests  indicate  robustness  under  all  tested \nassumptions. The financial internal rate of return is 6.3% and exceeds a weighted average cost \nof capital of 0.3%. Nonquantifiable financial benefits, such as the quality of power supply, were \nnot included in the financial analysis. The estimated cost-recovery tariff level is $0.037/kilowatt-\nhour (kWh). The project is viable under all sensitivity tests (capital cost, fuel cost, and revenue). \n \nThe  financial  performance  of  Uzbekenergo  has  been  strong,  especially  over  the  last  5 \n32. \nyears.  The  company  has  achieved  high  profitability,  has  a  low  debt  ratio,  and  an  accelerated \ndepreciation of fixed assets. Most of the fixed assets are inherited as equity, not as debt, and \ntheir residual value has been depreciated. The liquidity level is high, due to a good policy and \nperformance on receivables and account payables. \n \n33. \nThe financial projections for 2010\u20132015 incorporate Uzbekenergo's investment plan for \nnew  power  facilities,  with  total  investment,  including  for  this  project,  of  some  $4  billion. \nOperating costs are contained and the income projections point towards a strong financial base \nand  high  creditworthiness,  but  the  tariff  will  need  to  be  adjusted  to  reflect  the  cost  of  services \nand inflation. \n \n34. \nThe  government  is  committed  to  maintaining  cost-of-service  tariffs.  Since  2004,  the \nnominal electricity tariff has increased by 18%\u201320% per year. As the result, the per kWh retail \ntariff  has  risen  by  factor  of  three  (from  SUM20/kWh  to  SUM62/kWh,  or  from  $0.018/kWh  to \n$0.043/kWh) since 2004. The continued tariff increase above the rate of inflation of around 10% \nhas resulted in sustainable financial performance without recourse to direct subsidies.  \n \n35. \nThe  project  may  be  eligible  for  carbon  financing  under  the  Clean  Development \nMechanism (CDM). Estimates of carbon emission reduction potential based on available CDM \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nmethodology indicate an annual reduction of about 1.2 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent \n(mtCO2e). ADB is supporting Uzbekenergo with CDM processing through its Technical Support \nFacility under the Carbon Market Initiative. ADB's Future Carbon Fund may purchase up to 50% \nof the emission reductions after the appropriate project registration and validation. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n36. \nThe government has undertaken a series of far-reaching measures on governance and \nanticorruption.  These  include  (i)  legal  reforms  to  improve  the  fairness  and  effectiveness  of \njudiciary and court systems; (ii) reform of public sector management, especially public financial \nmanagement  and  tax  reforms;  (iii)  de-monopolization  to  open  opportunities  for  the  private \nsector; and (iv) more efficient and transparent procurement procedures. The government is also \nactive  in  international  anticorruption  activities.  In  2008,  it  approved  a  bill  to  enter  the  United \nNations  Anti-Corruption  Convention.  A  comprehensive  governance  assessment  will  be \nconducted under ADB's new country partnership strategy, which will start in 2010. \n \n37. \nA  financial  management  assessment  of  Uzbekenergo,  the  executing  agency,  found  it \nhas sound financial and accounting systems, procedures and policies, and has adopted accrual \naccounting, double entry bookkeeping and other generally accepted accounting principles and \nconventions  in  compliance  with  current  national  standards.  Capacity  development  under  the \nproject  will  strengthen  Uzbekenergo's  financial  management  capability,  as  well  as  overall \naccounting and auditing practices.  \n \n38. \nUzbekenergo's  procurement  capacity  was  also  assessed.  It  has  experience  in  working \nwith other multilateral and bilateral financiers. It is implementing two similar CCGT power plant \nprojects. Procurement lessons from these projects will be applied to this project. Procurement in \nany  case  will  follow  ADB's  guidelines,  including  the  use  of  standard  bidding  documents. \nUzbekenergo is not yet familiar with all ADB requirements and needs hands-on support, which \nwill  be  provided  through  an  international  consultant  engaged  under  technical  assistance.8 An \ntimely  procurement  and  project \nearly  warning  system  will  be  established \nimplementation.  \n  \n39. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  Uzbekenergo.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n\nto  ensure \n\nD. \n\n \nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n40. \nThe  household  electrification  rate  is  almost  100%.  However,  power  supply  gaps  are \naffecting  households'  socioeconomic  activities.  Gender  stereotypes  are  reinforced  through  the \nelectricity  shortage,  because  women  must  spend  more  time  on  household  tasks  and  cannot \nengage in income generating and educational activities. The project will increase the supply of \nreliable power to all customers, which will benefit the population, and improve living conditions \nand job opportunities. \n \nUzbekenergo will implement a community and gender action plan focusing on Talimarjan \n41. \nTPP  employees  and  surrounding  communities.  A  social  and  gender  specialist  in  the  project \nmanagement  unit  will  provide  support.  Several  social  support  programs  will  be  implemented, \nincluding building of a community service center. \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB.  2009.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  Preparing  the  Talimarjan  Power  Generation \n\nand Transmission Project. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\nThe influx of foreign and local workers during the construction period might increase the \n42. \nrisk of HIV/AIDS or other communicable diseases in the affected communities. Gender sensitive \nHIV/AIDS awareness campaigns will be initiated by Uzbekenergo for all construction workers, in \ncollaboration with the town administration at the local community. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nfollows: \n\nrequirements  are  as \n\nThe  project's  safeguards  classifications  and \n\n43. \n(i) \nenvironment\u2014category  A  (environmental  impact  assessment),  (ii)  involuntary  resettlement\u2014\ncategory C (no action), and (iii) indigenous peoples\u2014category C (no action).  \n \n44. \nAn  environmental  impact  assessment  has  been  prepared  and  was  disclosed  on  15 \nDecember  2009.  Two  rounds  of  public  consultations  were  held  prior  to  project  appraisal.  The \nenvironmental  sensitivity  of  the  project  site  and  its  surroundings  is  low.  The  town  of  Nuristan \n(home  to  employees  of  the  Talimarjan  TPP)  is  the  only  community  close  to  the  plant;  the \nnearest other settlements are over 5 km away. Large parts of the surrounding area have been \ndeveloped for irrigated agriculture; undeveloped areas consist of Karshi steppe, which is made \nup  of  semi-desert  scrublands.  The  project's  key  environmental  issues  are  air  quality  and \nemissions, noise impacts on the Nuristan settlement, and  water management. The project will \ncontribute  to  the  process  of  closing  older  inefficient  plants,  which  will  reduce  the  amount  of \ncarbon dioxide (CO2) produced from power generation. CCGTs fueled by natural gas produce \nsignificantly  lower  amounts  of  CO2  and  nitrogen  oxide  (NOx)  than  do  oil-  or  coal-fired  plants, \nand negligible amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO2). They typically have 35% lower fuel consumption \nthan  conventional  TPPs  and  require  less  water.  Dispersion  modeling  has  done  to  assess  the \npossible  impacts  of  NOx.  ADB  has  agreed  with  the  State  Committee  for  Nature  Protection  on \nthe acceptable discharge limits for CCGTs. \n \n45.  Water  is  taken  from  the  KMC  in  summer  and  a  single  pass  cooling  process  is  used. \nWater is then discharged back into the canal. The thermal plume is cooled to within 5\u00b0C of the \nintake  temperature  within  500  meters.  A  closed  system  is  used  in  winter  whereby  water  is \nsprayed into lagoons for cooling before being returned to the plant. The method for cooling the \nnew plant will be designed during the engineering stage. There is sufficient water supply in the \ncanal to meet the additional demand without impacting downstream water users. \n\nF. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n46.
