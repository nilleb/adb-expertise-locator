THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed results-\nbased loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Guangxi Modern Technical and \nVocational Education and Training Development Program. The report also describes proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Support for the Guangxi Modern Technical and Vocational Education \nand Training Development, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The program will provide, in 2017\u20132022, timely and essential support for the establishment \nof a technical and vocational education and training (TVET) system that provides graduates with \nbetter employment opportunities in industries in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR) \nby enhancing the industry relevance of TVET, improving the quality of TVET, increasing the \ninclusiveness of TVET, and expanding the role of TVET in regional economic development.2 The \nproposed results-based lending (RBL) program is critical for GZAR to implement a comprehensive \nTVET system reform package with a focus on results and system improvements, in accordance \nwith  the  GZAR\u2019s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan,  2016\u20132020,  which  is  in  the  second  year  of \nimplementation. It is expected to create strong synergetic effects, together with the Guangxi \nRegional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Promotion  Investment  Program,  on  cross-border \ncooperation and training, particularly benefiting bordering Viet Nam.3    \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  The economic structure of GZAR has undergone significant change since 2000, with \nprimary industry shrinking and secondary industry expanding, supported by steady economic \ngrowth. The gross domestic product growth rate recorded in 2015 was 8.1%, higher than the \nnational average of 6.9%. Yet GZAR remains one of the poorer provinces, with per capita gross \ndomestic product of CNY37,712, ranking 27th out of 31 provinces. About 9.9% of the population \nis living below the poverty line compared with the national average of 5.2%. A significant part of \nGZAR is mountainous and it has the largest ethnic minority population in the PRC\u2014accounting \nfor 37.1% of GZAR\u2019s total population in 2015. Nevertheless, GZAR\u2019s growth prospects are robust \nbecause of its strategic location, and it aspires to become the PRC\u2019s gateway to the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a strategic pivot in the opening up and development of the \nwestern and central regions, and an important pathway connecting the Silk Road Economic Belt \nand the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road (Belt and Road Initiative).  \n \n4.  However, concern is growing that shortages of labor, especially skilled labor, constrain the \nsocioeconomic  development  of  GZAR.  With  low  production  costs  and  improvements  in \ninfrastructure, logistics, and transport systems, enterprises in other parts of the PRC started \ninvesting in GZAR, transforming it into a burgeoning production and processing base. As the \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided program preparatory TA for Guangxi Modern Technical and Vocational \nEducation and Training Development Program (TA 9096-PRC). \n3   ADB. 2016. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Guangxi Regional Cooperation and Integration Promotion \nInvestment Program. Manila; Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Guangxi Development and Reform \nCommission. 2015. Thirteenth Five-Year Plan on Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Economic and Social \nDevelopment Plan, 2016\u20132020. Nanning.   \n ", "2 \nGZAR government promotes the development of \u201c14+10\u201d industries (14 key traditional industries \nand 10 emerging and strategic industries that require intermediate- and high-level skills) for the \nThirteenth Five-Year Plan period, 2016\u20132020, skilled labor shortages are becoming acute.4 \nAlthough TVET has been a source of skilled labor supply, students typically do not opt for TVET \nin GZAR because of its poor relevance and quality.5 Dropout rates at secondary TVET schools in \nGZAR are high. Completion and employment data indicate that not all TVET students graduate \nwith the necessary competencies in the areas in which they  were trained (67% in 2016). \nConsequently, even though about 95% of TVET graduates are guaranteed employment  in \nindustries nearby upon graduation, over half of them (51% in 2016) leave their first job within \n6 months.  \n  \n5.  The underlying issue is the poor relevance and quality of TVET. The TVET system in \nGZAR, comprising 313 secondary TVET schools, 36 tertiary TVET colleges, and 12 application-\noriented  universities,  is  under-resourced  and  supply-driven. 6  Course  offerings  at  TVET \ninstitutions, the teaching and learning environment and materials, and practical training facilities \ndo not adequately match the economic structure of GZAR, and TVET provision is not well aligned \nwith  the  needs  of  GZAR\u2019s  priority  industries.  Although  school\u2013enterprise  cooperation  has \nincreased, the involvement of employers and industry in the development of curriculum and \ntraining materials, establishment of practical training facilities, and delivery of practical training \nhas been largely ineffective without clearly defined competencies required for graduates, which \nreduces the relevance of TVET.  \n \n6.  Moreover, TVET institutions, especially secondary TVET schools in rural counties, lag in \nquality, and no system is in place to ensure consistent quality across TVET institutions. As the \nPRC does not have a national qualifications framework, provincial education departments are \nexpected to develop detailed quality standards for TVET institutions in line with strategic directions \nset by the Ministry of Education for quality assurance. Qualified teachers are in short supply, \nresulting in high student\u2013teacher ratios and low proportions of technical teachers with a teaching \nlicense and industry experience.  \n \n7.  Such poor relevance and quality of TVET have been the main cause of dropouts from \nsecondary TVET schools, followed by financial difficulties faced by students from poor families. \nThis has negative impacts on poverty reduction, since the percentage of students from poor \nfamilies is as high as 80% in some TVET institutions, and dropouts often end up with low paying, \nunstable,  and  vulnerable  employment.  Although  GZAR  is  one  of  the  five  ethnic  minority \nautonomous regions in the PRC, TVET has not contributed much to promote and rejuvenate its \nrich ethnic culture and traditions. Additionally, despite its strategic location, exchanges and \nregional cooperation activities between TVET institutions in GZAR and ASEAN countries have \nbeen limited in scope and effectiveness, lacking a long-term strategy to encourage cross-border \ntrade and investment, and technology transfer.  \n \n                                                \n4  \u201c14+10\u201d industries refer to 14 industries with an annual output value of over CNY100 billion each (food; automobile; \npetrochemical; electric power; nonferrous metal; metallurgy; machinery; building materials; paper making; electronic \ninformation; pharmaceutical manufacturing; textile clothing and leather; biology; and ship building, repair, and ocean \nengineering equipment) and 10 emerging and strategic industries (new materials; new energy; energy-saving and \nenvironmental protection; marine economy; biopharmaceutical; new information technology; new energy vehicles; \nbiological agriculture; advanced equipment manufacturing; and regimen, longevity, and health).  \n5   In 2015 the average years of schooling for people aged 15\u201364 years old in GZAR was 8.60 years. \n6  Application-oriented  means  having  engineering  and  applied  science  specializations,  and  practical  training \norientation.  \n ", "3 \n8.  To establish a modern TVET system, the GZAR government issued the GZAR Modern \nTVET System Development Plan, 2015\u20132020 and associated 10 implementation plans. The            \n10 implementation plans cover priority areas identified in the GZAR Modern TVET System \nDevelopment  Plan,  including  (i)  use  of  information  and  communication  technology,                        \n(ii) infrastructure development, (iii) quality improvement, (iv) enhancement of technical teachers\u2019 \nindustry experience, (v) increase in courses of study and practical training facilities in GZAR\u2019s \npriority industries, (vi) TVET group development, (vii) TVET park development, (viii) use of TVET \nto support poverty alleviation, (ix) ethnic culture inheritance and innovation, and (x) regional and \ninternational cooperation.   \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n9.  The program builds on the experience of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other \ndevelopment partners with lending and nonlending operations for TVET, including RBL, in the \nPRC, and will support the implementation of the GZAR Modern TVET System Development Plan.7 \nLessons have been reflected in the program, including the importance of sustained incremental \nadjustments and improvements to the existing system based on national and international good \npractices, rather than introducing new practices in a fragmented manner, and the need for \ninstitutional mechanisms to engage industries in TVET. The program is aligned with two of the \nstrategic  priorities  set  out  in  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy for the  PRC,  2016\u20132020: \nsupporting inclusive economic growth, and promoting regional cooperation and integration.8  \n \n10.  The use of the RBL modality is proposed for the program because the wide range of \ninterventions required to establish a modern TVET system  needs a clear focus on overall \nresults\u2014increased TVET graduates who entered stable employment in GZAR\u2019s industries\u2014and \nsystem improvements, rather than a limited number of discrete interventions designed for specific \nTVET  institutions.  The  program  will  involve  265  public  TVET  institutions  spread  across \n14 municipalities of GZAR, which would be difficult if the conventional investment lending modality \nwere used. RBL has the potential to expand the development impact of ADB financing, which \naccounts for only 2.5% of the total program financing (Table 4). The GZAR government has strong \nownership of the program, and demonstrates deep commitment to results-based planning and \nmanagement as opportunities for system improvements and institutional capacity development. \nRBL  also  provides  a  platform  for  development  coordination,  relying  on  sector-wide  and \nprogrammatic  approaches.  ADB  and  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW  will \ncofinance the program based on a common program results framework, disbursement-linked \nindicator (DLI) matrix, program action plan (PAP), and program implementation document.9 Due \ndiligence assessments provide assurance for effective achievement of results through RBL, with \nmeasures to strengthen government plans and program systems built into the program design.  \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s involvement in the government program will add value by (i) facilitating access to \nknowledge, expertise, and national and international good practice in quality assurance, industry \npartnership, and skills and knowledge transfer cooperation between TVET institutions in GZAR \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2015.

Program Scope \n \n12.  The program will support the implementation of the government program in public TVET \ninstitutions by focusing on key interventions designed to improve the relevance, quality, and \ninclusiveness  of  TVET;  and  expand  regional  cooperation  with  ASEAN  countries.  These \ninterventions are expected to continue and are likely to be upgraded after completion of the \ngovernment program.

The RBL program\u2019s impact will be socioeconomic development in GZAR accelerated \n(GZAR Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020). The outcome will be a TVET system that provides \ngraduates  with  better  employment  opportunities  in  GZAR\u2019s  industries  established.  TVET \ngraduates  who  entered  stable  employment  will  increase  (DLI  1),  as  will  those  with  dual \ncertification, i.e., certificates issued by the (i) TVET institution, and (ii) authorized occupational \nskills  assessment  and  certification  agency.  The  program  will  have  four  outputs.  \n \n14.  Output 1: Industry relevance of technical and vocational education and training \nenhanced. The program will provide support for industry steering committees to improve TVET \nprovision based on industry needs (DLI 2). It will also support, on a pilot basis, new methods of \nengaging industries in defining competencies and developing curriculum, training materials and \nmethods, and assessments to increase courses of study being offered using competency-based \ntraining (DLI 3). The methods pilot tested will be evaluated to explore the possibility of scaling up. \nThe  program  will  assist  the  establishment  of  practical  training  facilities  in  GZAR\u2019s  priority \nindustries, in cooperation with enterprises (DLI 4). Modern apprenticeship programs being pilot \ntested by three tertiary TVET colleges will be scaled up. TVET groups will be strengthened as a \nmechanism for promoting partnerships between TVET institutions, enterprises, and industries.11  \n \n15.  Output 2: Quality of technical and vocational education and training improved. The \nprogram will support TVET institutions, especially at the secondary level, in undertaking self-\nimprovement projects to meet comprehensive provincial standards for model TVET institutions. \nThe provincial standards cover the teaching and learning environment and materials, practical \ntraining facilities, teachers, the relevance and quality of course offerings, and employment \noutcomes (DLI 5). The program will also improve student\u2013teacher ratios, especially in secondary \nTVET, by recruiting more teachers and providing various opportunities for training. Concurrently, \nit will support the introduction of a new policy and framework to increase full-time teachers in \ntechnical fields with industry experience (DLI 6). The delivery of TVET will be informed by \nimproved monitoring and reporting of TVET institutions in a phased manner, following both the \nnational and provincial guidelines for improved monitoring and reporting and based on the Ministry \nof Education\u2019s information system (DLI 7).  \n \n16.  Output  3:  Inclusiveness  of  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training \nincreased. The program will reduce dropouts through improvements in the relevance and quality \nof TVET. In addition to the PRC and GZAR governments\u2019 poverty alleviation programs, TVET \nstudents from poor families receiving financial assistance will be provided with other types of \nsupport (e.g., counseling, career guidance, employment services) to complete TVET and find \nemployment or self-employment after graduation. The program will support the establishment of \nTVET bases to promote ethnic culture inheritance and innovation.12  \n \n17.  Output 4: Role of technical and vocational education and training  in regional \neconomic  development  expanded.  The  program  will  support  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration in TVET between GZAR and ASEAN countries by promoting partnership agreements \nfor long-term cooperation between TVET institutions and enterprises in GZAR and ASEAN \ncountries, and increasing the number of participants in partnership training and other cross-border \n                                                \n11  TVET groups comprise TVET institutions that offer similar courses of study in an industry, enterprises operating in \nthe industry, and research institutes.  \n12  It aims to develop new generations of successors of ethnic culture and traditions (e.g., Chinese medicines, traditional \nfolk crafts, ethnic art, food, and architecture) to prevent them from disappearing and rejuvenate them.   \n ", "6 \ntraining programs between TVET institutions and enterprises in GZAR and ASEAN countries \n(DLI 8). It will also increase the number of students from ASEAN countries who receive vocational \neducation certificates from TVET institutions in GZAR.  \n \n18.  To focus on the main elements of a modern TVET system, eight DLIs have been selected. \nLarge portions of ADB financing will be allocated to DLIs 1, 4, and 5. An increased number of \nTVET graduates who attain stable employment is the key outcome of any modern TVET system \n(DLI 1). By the end of the program, the percentage of TVET graduates who stay in their first job \nfor more than 6 months will increase from 49% to 54% (about 74,500 graduates over the program \nperiod). This indicates an improved TVET system that has established mechanisms for producing \nTVET graduates with competencies relevant to employers. Enhancing practical training facilities \nin  GZAR\u2019s  priority  industries  (DLI  4)  is  indispensable  in  addressing the  increasingly  acute \nshortages of skilled labor, while raising the number of TVET institutions that meet comprehensive \nstandards for model TVET institutions is essential for ensuring the quality of TVET (DLI 5).

Program financing. The government will finance $6,833 million, while public TVET \ninstitution tuition and other fees will contribute $1,801 million. Loans from commercial banks will \nbe sought to fill the funding gap.13 The government will fund the program if loans or other financing \ncannot be obtained.14 The government has requested a regular loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources and $50 million from ordinary capital resources set aside for regional \ncooperation and integration to help finance the RBL program. The loan will have a 26-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB's \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the \nstraight-line method, the average maturity is 15.75 years, and the maturity premium payable to \nADB is 0.10% per year. KfW is expected to provide cofinancing of $200 million equivalent (in \neuros) on a joint collaborative basis.15 The financing plan is summarized in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: Program Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nGovernment  6,833.0  68.2 \nPublic TVET institution tuition and other fees  1,801.0  18.0 \nCommercial banks  938.0  9.3 \nCofinancier  200.0  2. 0 \nAsian Development Bank   \n  Ordinary capital resources (loan)  250.0  2.5 \nTotal  10,022.0  100.0 \nTVET = technical and vocational education and training. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n22.  Disbursement arrangements. Disbursement will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB. The loan proceeds will be disbursed to a dedicated \naccount to be opened by the government based on the verified achievement of DLIs. The \ngovernment  will  ensure  that  the  total  program  expenditures  exceed  the  total  loan  amount \nwithdrawn. Advance financing is allowed to address financing requirements. The government will \nrefund any advance financing amount outstanding if DLIs are not achieved. The outstanding \nadvance will not exceed the ceiling of 25% of the loan amount. Financing of prior results achieved \nnot more than 12 months before loan signing is allowed to support the government in initiating \nactions required to achieve the first year\u2019s DLIs. The total amount of such financing will not exceed \n                                                \n13 Tertiary TVET institutions sometimes seek loans from commercial banks if they cannot obtain funds from the \ngovernment.   \n14  Financial sustainability analysis confirmed that the government can provide funds if needed (para. 26).  \n15  ADB and KfW signed a cofinancing memorandum of understanding on 5 May 2017. KfW received an official request \nfor the loan from the government on 23 June 2017.  \n ", "8 \n20% of the loan amount. The combined outstanding balance of advance financing and amount of \nfinancing for prior results must not exceed 30% of total ADB financing. Partial disbursements are \nallowed for DLIs 4 and 6 upon achievement of agreed percentages of the target values, because \nthe DLI targets require efforts of all the TVET institutions rather than a limited number of TVET \ninstitutions in GZAR, and are difficult to achieve. Disbursements are also allowed for early or late \nachievement of DLIs. Before the disbursement of loan proceeds, GED will prepare and submit, \nthrough Guangxi Finance Department, a withdrawal application, along with evidence verifying \nachievement of the DLIs in accordance with the verification protocols.  \n \nF.  Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n23.  The program will strengthen the capacity of the TVET system in GZAR to develop and \nimplement key interventions related to model TVET institutions; practical and in-company training \nmechanisms for TVET teachers; monitoring and reporting of TVET institutions; industry steering \ncommittees;  industry  partnerships  in  the  definition  of  competencies  and  development  of \ncurriculum, training materials and methods, and assessment; modern apprenticeship programs \nand TVET groups; and cooperation between TVET institutions and enterprises in GZAR and \nASEAN countries. It will also improve monitoring and evaluation (M&E), fiduciary, and safeguards \nsystems, as well as gender and social inclusion. Capacity development activities are in the PAP.16   \n \nG.  Technical Assistance \n \n24.  TA is attached to the program.17 The TA is estimated to cost $700,000, of which $600,000 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other \nsources). The TA will have four outputs: (i) mechanisms for ensuring the quality of TVET               \n(e.g.,  monitoring  and  reporting  of  TVET  institutions,  practical  and  in-company  training \narrangements for TVET teachers) improved; (ii) measures to strengthen TVET groups and \nmodern  apprenticeship  programs  developed;  (iii)  new  cooperation  models  between  TVET \ninstitutions and enterprises in GZAR and ASEAN countries developed; and (iv) capacity of TVET \nadministration to provide guidance and supervision for TVET institutions and manage the program \nstrengthened by establishing systems for managing and monitoring environment, resettlement, \nand social impacts; and improving operating procedures, financial management, and M&E. \nIndependent third-party verification of DLIs will be performed, and baseline and follow-up surveys \nfor an impact evaluation study will be conducted under the TA. GED is the executing agency. The \ngovernment will support the TA in the form of counterpart staff, office and meeting space, \ncoordination  support,  data,  information,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented upon approval of the loan until 31 December 2022.  \n \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  The GZAR government is the executing agency. Through ADB-financed multicomponent \nurban development projects and two ongoing TVET projects, it has developed and demonstrated \nsolid capacity to manage and implement challenging projects. GED is the principal implementing \nagency and will implement the program through its program management office. A leading group \nfor  the  utilization  of  foreign  loans,  comprising  Guangxi  Finance  Department,  Guangxi \nDevelopment and Reform Commission, GED, and other departments with responsibilities for \nTVET  institutions,  has  been  established  to  provide  strategic  guidance  and  direction  in \nimplementing the program. The RBL program implementation will use the country\u2019s program \n                                                \n16  Program Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n17  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nfiduciary and safeguard systems. The existing financial management systems for GED and TVET \ninstitutions will be used to manage the loan proceeds. GED and TVET institutions will undertake \nthe procurement of civil works, goods, and services.   \n \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n26.  Technical assessments concluded that the TVET system in GZAR needs to (i) enhance \nits responsiveness to the human resources needs of industries, especially emerging and strategic \nindustries; (ii) improve the quality of TVET, in particular county secondary TVET in terms of the \nteaching and learning environment and materials, and teachers; (iii) increase the number of \nteachers with industry experience; (iv) strengthen mechanisms for engaging employers and \nindustries in TVET; (v) improve the retention of students, especially from poor families and \ndisadvantaged  backgrounds,  and  their  employment  or  self-employment;  and  (vi)  expand \ncooperation activities between TVET institutions and enterprises in GZAR and ASEAN countries. \nThese findings have been incorporated in the program results framework, DLIs, and PAP. \nAnalysis  of  historical  and  predicted  data  on  revenues,  budgets,  expenditures,  and  results \nconfirmed that the program expenditure framework and financing plan are robust. The program \nwas assessed as financially sustainable, since the GZAR government reports revenue surplus \nannually, and TVET budget accounts for only about 2% of the GZAR government revenue.   \n \n27.  Economic benefits of the program include (i) higher wages expected for graduates owing \nto the improved relevance and quality of TVET, and (ii) wage differentials between unskilled \nworkers and additional numbers of graduates who have been prevented from dropping out or who \nhave chosen TVET over work because of financial assistance and other types of support provided \nfor students from poor families. The program is deemed economically viable, with an economic \ninternal rate of return at 11.16%. It has a strong poverty focus, as TVET enrolls a higher \npercentage of students from poor families, disadvantaged backgrounds, and rural areas than \nacademic education because of its lower entry requirements and affordability. Gender analysis \nrevealed that girls tend to perform better academically than boys and enroll less in TVET than \nacademic  education;  and  female  teachers  generally  enjoy  fewer  opportunities  for  training, \npromotion, and managerial responsibilities. The program is designed with some gender elements. \nSpecific gender targets and actions for teacher and manager training, students who receive \npoverty-related subsidies, and students from ASEAN countries who receive vocational education \ncertificates have been included in the PAP.  \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n28.  Monitoring and evaluation systems. Assessment of the M&E system found that it has \nthe potential to generate most of the information required to monitor the program. The following \nweaknesses were identified: (i) information on some indicators rely on self-reporting by TVET \ninstitutions, which could compromise quality and accuracy; (ii) lack of socioeconomic information \nto assess the impacts of TVET; (iii) limited availability of data disaggregated by sex, ethnicity, and \npoverty  status  at  GED;  (iv)  limited  availability  of  data  on  application-oriented  universities \nsegregated from those on academic colleges and universities; and (v) fragmented data collection \nand reporting mechanisms for skills and knowledge transfer activities between TVET institutions \nand enterprises in GZAR and ASEAN countries. The PAP contains actions to strengthen GED\u2019s \nM&E systems.   \n \n ", "10 \n29.  Fiduciary systems. The program will use the country\u2019s program systems for financial \nmanagement, procurement, and anticorruption. Financial management assessment confirmed \nthat the GZAR government and TVET institutions have adequate financial management systems, \nand staff capacity was found to be relatively strong. Weaknesses identified include inadequate \nstaff capacity for internal audit at GED and TVET institutions, and generally lower financial \nmanagement capacity at county TVET institutions. Procurement assessment concluded that the \nprocurement  framework  is  aligned  with  the  principles  of  competition,  efficiency,  economy, \ntransparency, fairness, and equal opportunities. Weaknesses found include lack of qualified \nprocurement staff and training opportunities, and a lack of technical skills at TVET institutions to \nprepare technical specifications and cost estimates. Procurement involving high-value contracts \nwill  be  excluded  from  ADB  financing.18 Actions  to  strengthen  financial  management  and \nprocurement systems have been included in the PAP and attached TA. The Guidelines to Prevent \nor Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities in Results-Based Lending for \nPrograms were explained to and discussed with the PRC and the GZAR governments.19 \n \n30.  Safeguard  systems.  The  program  is  categorized  B  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples safeguards. Outputs 1 and 2 will involve civil works on \nexisting  campuses  or  reserved  lands  that  may  have  some  temporary  and  site-specific \nenvironmental impacts, and potential involuntary resettlement impacts. Any physical activity of \nthe  program  that  may  be  classified  category  A  for  the  ADB  environment  and  involuntary \nresettlement safeguards is excluded from the program scope. Output 3 will support students from \npoor ethnic minority families and ethnic culture inheritance and innovation. Gaps identified include \n(i) inadequate disclosure of environmental monitoring reports and public engagement during \nconstruction,  and  some  difference  in  categorization  criteria  for  civil  works  and  related \nenvironmental impact assessment requirements; (ii) on involuntary resettlement safeguards, lack \nof identification of the poor and vulnerable groups during the screening process, lack of \ndocumentation  of  the  consultation  and  information  disclosure  activities,  and  grievances \nreceived, and inadequate institutional arrangements, monitoring, and reporting arrangements; \nand (iii) lack of an effective monitoring and reporting system to analyze the performance of \nstudents from ethnic minority groups other than the Zhuang. Actions to address safeguard system \ngaps have been identified in the PAP and included in the attached TA.  \n \nC.  Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5. The overall RBL program \nrisk was assessed moderate.
