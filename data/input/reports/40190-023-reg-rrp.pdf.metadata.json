The  report  and \nrecommendation  covering  project  interventions  and  proposed  financing  for  Cambodia  will  be \npresented to the Board separately upon confirmation of the availability of cofinancing. This two-\nstep  processing  approach  does  not  compromise  the  overall  integrity  of  the  regional  project  in \ngeneral and the regional activities in particular. \n \n3. \nThe  project  will  support  the  governments  of  the  Lao  PDR  and  Viet  Nam  to  undertake \nstructural and nonstructural measures to prepare for and manage disaster risks linked to floods \nand  droughts. 3  Project  interventions  will  (i)  enhance  the  regional  data,  information,  and \nknowledge  base  for  the  management  of  floods  and  droughts;  (ii)  upgrade  or  develop  water \nmanagement  infrastructure;  and  (iii)  prepare  communities  to  manage  disasters  such  as  floods \nand droughts and adapt to climate change. Improved drought management and irrigation water \nstructures  will  benefit  farmers  on  about  66,000  hectares  of  agricultural  lands  and  at  least \n500,000 people will benefit from improved flood management. \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale4 \nThe  Mekong  River  stretches  from  the  eastern  watershed  of  the  Xizang5 Plateau  to  the \n4. \nMekong  Delta  flowing  over  4,909  kilometers  (km)  through  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China, \nMyanmar,  the  Lao  PDR,  Thailand,  Cambodia,  and  Viet  Nam  with  a  total  basin  area  of \n795,000 square  kilometers  (km2).6 The  LMB  is  home  to  about  60  million  people  in  Cambodia, \nthe  Lao  PDR,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  The  Mekong  River,  while  being  one  of  the  20  largest \nrivers in the world, stands apart because of the large fluctuations in seasonal discharge\u2014very \nlow  flows  in  the  dry  season  yet  extensive  flooding  in  the  wet  season.7 River  flow  is  largely \nunaffected by water control structures and follows the seasonal hydrological cycle.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

The  anticipated  impacts  of  climate  change  and  sea  level  rise  in  the \n5. \nMekong  River  Basin  indicate  the  water-related  vulnerability  will  be  exacerbated.8 Global  and \nregional  climate  change  scenario  analyses  indicate  that  in  the  LMB,  temperatures  as  well  as \nannual rainfall and runoff will increase and sea level will rise, resulting in increased agriculture \nand economic losses in the Mekong Delta.9 Floods and droughts are projected to become more \nfrequent and intense. \n \n6. \nFloods. Annual floods in the LMB are beneficial, nourishing the wetlands and sustaining \nfisheries and biodiversity.10 Extreme floods, however, cause losses and damage to livelihoods, \nagriculture,  and  infrastructure.  The  average  annual  direct  cost  of  flooding  to  agriculture, \ninfrastructure,  and  buildings  in  the  LMB  is  $60  million\u2013$70  million,  while  the  average  annual \nvalue of flood benefit is estimated at $8 billion\u2013$10 billion (footnote 10). The challenge for flood \nrisk management is to reduce the costs and impacts of flooding while preserving its benefits. \n \n7. \nPhysical exposure to flood risks in the LMB is high and this is translated into economic \nexposure.11 Damage  in  monetary  terms  is  higher  in  Viet  Nam,  signifying  the  level  of  exposure \nresulting  from  higher  development  (agriculture  and  infrastructure)  compared  to  Cambodia  and \nthe Lao PDR. Typhoon Ketsana in September 2009 resulted in damage and losses estimated at \n$131 million in Cambodia, $58 million in the Lao PDR, and $800 million in Viet Nam.  \n \nDroughts.12 Droughts,  which  occur  as  a  result  of  periods  of  very  low  rainfall  and  river \n8. \nflow,  cause  disruption  to  the  livelihoods  of  farmers  and  food  supply  chains.  Droughts  are \nconsidered  disasters  because  they  significantly  affect  poor  and  vulnerable  communities, \nparticularly  by  increasing  household  food  insecurity. 13  Water  shortages,  particularly  during \ncritical growth stages of crops, significantly reduce yields. Saline water intrusion in estuaries and \ncoastal  areas\u2014exacerbated  by  the  low  flows,  particularly  in  the  delta  area  of  Viet  Nam\u2014is \nanother cause of concern that adversely impacts food production. \n \n9. \nThe  direct  costs  of  drought  in  the  LMB  relate  to  the  impact  of  agricultural  droughts\u2014\nreduced yields or total loss of crops, especially rice, together with reduced livestock and fishery \nyields.  The  2004\u20132005  drought  was  severe  for  all  LMB  countries,  with  losses  estimated  at  \n$42  million  in  the  delta  and  localized  food  shortages.  The  extreme  low  flows  in  the  Mekong \nRiver during March\u2013April 2010 adversely impacted dry season crops along the Mekong River as \npumping stations were not able to draw water.  \n\n10. \nInsufficient  disaster  preparedness.  Countries  in  the  LMB  have  varying  levels  of \ncapacity  to  prepare  for  and  manage  flood-  and  drought-related  disasters.

Asia-Pacific  Disaster  Report \n2010. Bangkok. \n\n12 Meteorological  droughts,  defined  by  low  rainfall  over  the  wet  season  (May\u2013November),  reduce  yields  of  rain-fed \nrice  and  other  crops.  The  agricultural  impacts  of  hydrological  droughts  are  most  severe  during  the  dry  season, \nwhen less than normal stream flows reduce irrigation and the yield of dry season crops. Hydrological droughts may \nalso occur during the wet season, for example, when less than normal stream flows reduce the volume and extent \nof flood waters stored in the Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia and the yield of its fishery.  \n\n13 Indirect  costs  that  are  difficult  to  assess  are  those  of  perpetuating  structural  poverty  through  early  childhood \n\nstunting, ultimately resulting in loss of productivity.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\freactive,  rather  than  proactive,  and  are  uncoordinated.  Better  flood  and  drought  disaster \npreparedness requires (i) knowledge availability and sharing of potential changes to the spatial \nand  temporal  distribution  of  climate  and  hydrological  variables  over  the  basin  as  a  whole; \n(ii) capacity  for  timely  flood  and  drought  forecasting  and  dissemination  of  warnings  to \ncommunities  at  risk;  (iii)  engagement  of  at-risk  communities  in  the  identification,  analysis, \ntreatment, monitoring, and evaluation of disaster risks in order to reduce their vulnerabilities and \nenhance their coping capacities; and (iv) improved condition of water control infrastructure. \n \n11. \nSolutions  and  opportunities.  Improving  the  disaster  preparedness  of  countries  and \ncommunities  to  manage  and  mitigate  the  potential  impacts  of  extreme  floods  and  droughts \nrequires structural and nonstructural initiatives. In terms of nonstructural measures, institutional \nand  technical  capacity  building  activities  can  strengthen  regional  information  and  knowledge \ngeneration  and  sharing  with  regard  to  water  resources  management  in  general  and  flood  and \ndrought management in particular. Community-based disaster risk management (CBDRM) can \nequip  communities,  especially  women,  to  access  information  on  disaster  risks  and  enhance \ntheir  preparedness.14 Two-way  channels  for  information  sharing  between  local  communities, \nriver basin management systems, national level early warning centers, and disaster forecasting \ncenters are necessary. Structural measures include rehabilitation of flood control embankments, \nwater control structures, and rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage structures. \n \n12. \nRegional  initiatives.  The  project  is  one  of  the  flagship  programs  of  the  2002  GMS \nEconomic Cooperation Program Strategic Framework as well as 2008 Vientiane Plan of Action. \nOn  the  regional  level,  the  Mekong  River  Commission  (MRC)  provides  a  framework  for \nsustainable  development  of  the  LMB. 15  The  MRC  secretariat  plays  an  important  role  in \nsupporting  national  agencies  and  nongovernment  organizations  with  technical  services  that \nhave regional relevance and also on transboundary issues. ADB and development partners are \nalso  supporting  natural  resource  management  and  climate  change  adaptation  through \nsubregional  initiatives  including  the  GMS  Core  Environment  Program  and  its  Biodiversity \nConservation Initiative and the GMS Core Agriculture Support Program.16  \n \n13. \nRelevance  to  national  priorities.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  relevant  policies, \nstrategies,  and  programs  such  as  the  following:  (i)  Lao  PDR:  Disaster  Management  Action \nFrameworks,  2003\u20132020;  (ii)  Viet  Nam:  National  Strategy  for  Natural  Disaster  Prevention, \nResponse  and  Mitigation  approved  by  the  Prime  Minister  in  2007  (Decision  No.  172/2007), \nNational  Targeted  Program  to  Respond  to  Climate  Change,  Strategic  Direction  of  Water \nResources  Development  (to  2020  and  toward  2050),  the  Mekong  Delta  Master  Plan;  and \n(iii) Cambodia:  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy  and \nNational Water Resources Policy for Cambodia.17  \n \n14. \nADB  support.  The  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011\u20132020, \nwhich identifies flood and drought mitigation (as part of disaster risk management) as one of the \ntwo urgent challenges to be addressed in the integrated water resource management process.18 \nThe project is also aligned with the ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004) as \n\n                                                 \n14 CBDRM  is  a  process  in  which  at-risk  communities  are  actively  engaged  in  the  identification,  analysis,  treatment, \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  of  disaster  risks  in  order  to  reduce  their  vulnerabilities  and  enhance  their  capacities. \nCBDRM seeks to strengthen community resilience to disaster-related shocks. \n\n15 The  MRC  was  formed  on  5  April  1995  by  an  agreement  between  the  governments  of  Cambodia,  the  Lao  PDR, \n\nThailand, and Viet Nam. The MRC secretariat is based in Vientiane, Lao PDR. \n\n16 The  GMS  initiatives  are  supported  by  several  development  partners,  such  as  the  Government  of  Finland  (Core \nEnvironment  Program  Biodiversity  Corridors  Initiative  pilot  and  second  phases)  and  the  Government  of  Sweden \n(Implementing the Core Agriculture Support Program Phase 2). \n\n17 Approved by the Council of Ministers on 16 January 2004. \n18  ADB. 2011.

The project benefits from lessons from past ADB assistance on irrigation development \nand flood management in the region.19  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n15. \nThe  impact  will  be  reduced  economic  losses  resulting  from  floods  and  droughts.  The \noutcome  will  be  improved  capacity  and  preparedness  to  manage  and  mitigate  the  impacts  of \nflood and drought events.20 \n \nC. \n\nOutputs  \n\n16. \n\nThe project will have four key outputs: \n(i) \n\nflow  capacity  and \n\nimproving  water  control \n\nflood  management  options \n\nOutput 1: Enhanced regional data, information, and knowledge base for the \nmanagement of floods and droughts. The project will support (a) development \nof  design  criteria  for  water  control  infrastructure  such  as  flood  and  drought  risk \nmitigation schemes in the Mekong Delta for Viet Nam; (b) assessment of cross-\nin  Viet  Nam  and  Cambodia;  and \nborder \n(c) establishment of the National Early Warning Center in the Lao PDR.21 \nOutput  2:  Upgraded  water  management  infrastructure.  The  project  will \nsupport (a) rehabilitation of flood control embankments, associated water control \nstructures,  and  access  roads;  (b)  rehabilitation  of  drainage  canals,  including \nincreasing \ninfrastructure;  and \n(c) rehabilitation and extension of canals, water control structures, and irrigation \ndistribution networks.  The  subprojects  in  the  Lao  PDR  are  the  Vientiane  capital \nflood  protection  subproject  and  the  Vientiane  capital  irrigation  development \nsubproject. They include approximately 30 km of flood protection embankment, 8 \npumped irrigation schemes, 2 flood drainage pumps, and approximately 30 km of \nflood-proof  road  (about  4  km  of  single  lane  all-weather  road  and  26.4  km  of \ndouble lane, black topped). In Viet Nam, four subprojects will be implemented in \nthe  two  southern  provinces  of  Dong  Thap  and  Tien  Giang:  (a)  upgrading  the \nmain  canal  system  to  drain  and  irrigate  Plain  of  Reeds  area  (Dong  Thap)  to \nrehabilitate four canals by dredging about 80 km of canals; (b) Thuong Thoi Tien \nbank  protection  (Dong  Thap)  to  upgrade  and  strengthen  about  3  km  of  flood \nembankments to stabilize the left bank of the Tien River in the vicinity of Thuong \nThoi Tien town; (c) control and mitigation of flood risk for the Ba Rai-Phu An area \n(Tien  Giang)  to  upgrade  the  flood control  system  by  constructing  approximately \n24  sluice  gates  to  mitigate  flood  risks;  and  (d)  upgrading  the  salinity  intrusion \nsystem  for  the  Go-Cong  area  (Tien  Giang)  to  construct  approximately  three \nsluice gates to enhance control of tidal and brackish water movement from urban \nareas  permitting  flushing  while  retaining  additional  fresh  water  resources  in \npaddy growing areas.22 \nOutput  3:  Enhanced  capacity \nrisk \nmanagement.

Cost  Sharing  and  Eligibility  of \n\nExpenditures for ADB Financing. Operations Manual. OM H3. Manila. \n\n27 The following principles were followed in determining the amount of taxes and duties to be financed by ADB: (i) the \namount does not represent an excessive share of the project, (ii) the taxes and duties apply only to ADB-financed \nexpenditures, (iii) the amount is within the thresholds identified during the country partnership strategy preparation \nprocess, and (iv) financing of taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the project. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fwill  be  the  executing  agency  and  will  delegate  responsibility  to  its  central  project  office,  which \nwill  set  up  a  central  project  management  unit  in  Can  Tho  City,  to  be  close  to  the  subproject \nsites.

They  were  selected  from  sector  road  maps  following  these  subproject \nselection criteria: alignment with the national strategy; adherence to integrated water resource \nmanagement  principles  of  efficiency,  equity,  and  sustainability;  and  status  of  investment \npreparation.  The  implementing  agencies  have  the  capacity  to  supervise  and  coordinate  the \nconstruction  of  such  infrastructure.  The  design  capacities  of  flood  control  gates,  drainage \npumps,  and  irrigation  canals  are  based  on  international  norms,  hydrological  and  hydraulic \nanalyses,  and  hydrographic  and  topographical  surveys  of  the  project  areas,  and  are  suited  to \nlocal conditions.  \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n24. \nFor irrigation subprojects, incremental production was estimated and production valued \nat  derived  economic  prices  for  internationally  traded  goods  (in  the  case  of  rice).  For  flood \nprotection  initiatives,  the  prevention  of  loss  to  personal  property,  public  infrastructure, \n\n                                                 \n28 Project Administration Manuals (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fcommercial  activities,  and  temporary  household  relocation  was  estimated  based  on  current \nlevels of economic activity. The economic internal rate of return estimates range from 12% for \nthe Thuong Thoi Tien embankment subproject to 24% for the Go Cong subproject. In general, \nsubprojects  with  impacts  relating  to  flood  prevention  have  a  higher  internal  rate  of  return  than \nthose  with  benefits  dominated  by  irrigated  agricultural  production.  The  greatest  sensitivity  to \neconomic internal rate of return is from development cost escalations (Ba Rai-Phu An and Plain \nof Reeds subprojects) and reductions in flood benefits (Thuong Thoi Tien subproject).29  \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n25. \nAll  procurement  to  be  financed  by  ADB  loan  and  grant  funds  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Project \nimplementation, procurement, and financial management will be aligned with the governments\u2019 \nstandard  operating  procedures.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (Lao  PDR)  and  the \nMinistry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (Viet  Nam)  have  given  assurance  that  all \naccounts  administered  by  the  implementation  units  are  consolidated  and  audited  annually  by \nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Financial  management  assessments  concluded  that  the  existing \norganizational structures of the executing and implementing agencies are generally suitable for \nthe  implementation  of  the  project  and  fund  flow  arrangements  are  clear.  There  are  shortfalls \nsuch as the lack of experience with ADB project management for some implementing agencies; \nhowever, this will be addressed through training.  The project will strengthen staff capacities in \nthe implementation units, particularly in financial management procedures, to allow the efficient \noperation  of  advance  accounts  and  the  reporting  of  financial  performance  to  the  governments \nand  ADB.  The  project  will  establish  or  use  existing  ministerial  websites  to  (i)  disclose \nimplementation  progress  and  bid  notifications  and  their  results,  and  (ii)  provide  a  grievance \nmechanism against any corrupt practice.  \n\n26. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  governments  of  the  Lao  PDR  and  Viet  Nam.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manuals (footnote 28). \n\nD. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\n27. \n Benefits.  The  mitigation  and  improved  management  of  the  risks  related  to  flood  and \ndrought events will enable communities to benefit substantially from (i) avoiding loss of property \nand  reducing  casualties,  (ii)  increased  agricultural  productivity  and  incomes  caused  by  the \nimproved  management  and  availability  of  water,  (iii)  improved  access  through  improved  rural \nroads and canals, and (iv) reduction of economic losses from disruption of livelihoods.30  \n\n Gender  impacts.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  key \n28. \ngender  impacts  of  the  project  include  increased  women\u2019s  engagement  in  (i)  management  of \ndata and information on floods and droughts, (ii) local disaster risk management activities, and \n(iii)  employment  generated  through  civil  works  and  other  project  activities.  The  gender  action \nplan contains the following gender design features to ensure that (i) at least 40% of trainees in \ndisaster  risk  assessment  and  analysis,  prioritization,  and  implementation  of  locally  appropriate \nrisk  management  measures  will  be  women;  (ii)  at  least  40%  of  participants  in  all  public \nconsultations  for  the  development  of  safer  village  and  commune  plans  will  be  women;  (iii) at \nleast 40% of community facilitators of the public consultation will be women; (iv) at least 50% of \nthe  implementers  of  the  CBDRM  measures  will  be  women;  (v)  at  least  40%  of  commune \nCBDRM coordination committee members will be women; (vi) contractors will prioritize the use \nof  local  unskilled  labor  for  civil  works  and  at  least  30%  of  unskilled  laborers  (20%  in  the \nLao PDR)  will  be  women  and  equal  pay  for  equal  work  will  be  ensured;  (vii)  at  least  30%  of \n                                                 \n29 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fproject staff will be women; and (viii) gender-related performance indicators are included in the \nproject monitoring and evaluation framework.31 \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  governments  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects  are \n29. \nimplemented in strict conformity with relevant laws and regulations, the requirements of ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  all  measures  and  requirements  set  forth  in  the  initial \nenvironmental  examinations  (IEE)  and  environmental  management  plans  that  have  been \nprepared  for  each  subproject  and  endorsed  by  the  governments.  The  IEEs  will  be  posted  on \nADB\u2019s  website  upon  Board  approval  of  the  Project.32 All  identified  adverse  impacts  resulting \nfrom  the  location,  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  the  water  management  infrastructure \nare expected to be small to moderate and can be mitigated by adoption of specific measures. \nSpecial  environment-related  assurances  are  prepared  to  mitigate  any  project  impact  on \nadjacent  wetlands.33 Further  updating  of  the  environmental  management  plans  for  individual \nsubprojects  will  be  undertaken  prior  to  the  commencement  of  site-specific  construction \nactivities.  \n \n30. \nthat  about \n1,814 households  (11,065  people)  will  be  affected  by  the  project,  including  1,537 households \n(9,222  people)  in  Viet  Nam  and  277  households  (1,843  people)  in  the  Lao PDR.  In  both \ncountries, severely affected households are estimated at about 248 households (1,221 people), \npotentially  losing  more  than  10%  of  their  productive  land  and/or  assets.  The  total  land  take  is \nestimated at 75 hectares. Six resettlement plans, one for each subproject, have been endorsed \nby  the  governments  and  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website. 34  The  resettlement  plans  and  their \nimplementation are designed to ensure that the affected persons will be no worse off as a result \nof  the  project.  The  governments  have  shown  commitment  to  manage  social  risks,  but \ninstitutional capacity building is still necessary and is included in the project. \n \n31. \nidentities or separate cultural traditions were found to reside in the project areas.  \n\nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).
