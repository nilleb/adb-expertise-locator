The \nassessments  of  each  of  the  eight  subprojects.  The  results  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix  I.  A  summary  IEE  has  also  been \nprepared. \n \nThe  Project  will  work  with  both  the  national  and  the  provincial \ngovernments.  At  the  national  level,  the  Project  will  help  the \nGovernment  strengthen  sector  planning  and  management  by \ndeveloping  a  sector  strategy,  a  road  map,  and  an  investment \nprogram.  A  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  framework  will  also \nbe  prepared  together  with  the  sector  strategy  to  enable  the \nGovernment  to  promote  private  sector  involvement  in  the  sector \nmore  effectively.  At  the  provincial  level,  the  Project  will  provide \nsafe,  reliable,  and  sustainable  water  supply  and \nimproved \nsanitation services in seven districts and one city in Surkhandarya \nProvince.  The  services  can  be  used  as  a  model  that  can  be \nreplicated and expanded in other provinces. Besides investments \nin  physical  infrastructure  for  system  rehabilitation  and  necessary \nupgrading, \nthe  critical  planning, \nmanagement, financial, operational, and customer relations needs \nof  the  vodokanals  (water  supply  and  sanitation  agencies)  to \nimprove service delivery efficiency.  \n \nThe  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  systems  in  Uzbekistan, \nwhich were inherited from the Soviet Union, have reached the end \nof  their  economic  life  and  require  extensive  rehabilitation.  The \nprovision  of  reliable,  safe,  and  affordable  WSS  services  to  the \npopulation is a key challenge to the Government, as the sector is \nfaced with a series of issues, including deteriorated infrastructure, \noutdated  sector  strategy  and  planning,  inappropriate  standards, \nlimited  financial  resources,  and  weak  institutional  capacity.  The \nsector  performance  indicators  for  2006  show  that,  despite  high \nnetwork  coverage  (82%  of  the  population\u201488%  urban  and  79% \nrural),  households  are  supplied  with  water  for  only  6\u201324  hours  a \nday  in  the  urban  areas  and  2\u201312  hours a  day  in  the  rural  areas. \nSurkhandarya has network coverage of 76% (87% urban and 74% \nrural). Water supply in the province is available for 6\u201316 hours a \nday  in  the  urban  areas  and  2\u201310  hours  in  the  rural  areas. \nNonperforming  (deteriorated  and  leaking)  infrastructure,  power \noutages,  and  lack  of  revenue  prevent  better  service.  No  reliable \n\nthe  Project  will  address \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nestimate on unaccounted-for water (UFW) is available because of \na  lack  of  meters;  the  general  estimate  is  more  than  50% \nnationwide.  Improving  the  health  and  living  conditions  of  the \npeople  by  providing  them  with  better  access  to  safe  and  reliable \nwater  supply  and  better  sanitation  is  therefore  the  Government\u2019s \ntop  priority.  The  Project  will  support  water  supply  and  sanitation \nsector  development  in  Uzbekistan  by  tackling  four  challenges:  (i) \nshortfalls in policy and standards, (ii) investment needs, (iii) sector \nand  business  management,  and  (iv)  operational  and  institutional \ngaps. \n \nWhen  it  is  completed  in  2014,  the  Project  will  improve  living \nstandards  and  public  health  for  about  340,000  people  living  in \nSurkhandarya  Province.  The  outcome  will  be  safe,  reliable, \ninclusive,  and  sustainable  water  supply  and  sanitation  services \nand improved community hygiene, in particular: (i) an increase in \nthe  duration  of  water  supply  services  to  20  hours  a  day  by  2014 \nand 24 hours a day by 2020, (ii) a reduction in UFW to less than \n40%,  (iii)  full  cost  recovery  for  all  project  vodokanals  from  2014 \nonward,  and  (iv)  prompt  recording  of  and  response  to    customer \ncomplaints.  The  Project  will  achieve  this  impact  and  these \noutcomes by (i) strengthening sector planning, management, and \nregulation  capacity,  (ii) rehabilitating  water  supply  and  sanitation \nsystems  and \n(iii)  addressing  social  and  gender \nimpediments  to  equality  of  access  to  services;  (iv)  enhancing \npublic awareness and practice of good hygiene, and (v) improving \nthe management and the skills and capability of vodokanals. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $40.0  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $5.7 million.  \n \n\nfacilities, \n\n \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nMDTF-WFPFa \nGovernment \nTotal \n \na  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund  under  the  Water  Financing  Partnership  Facility. \nContributors: \nthe  governments  of  Australia,  Austria,  and  Norway,  and \nadministered by ADB. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n30.0 \n1.5 \n8.5 \n40.0 \n\nShare \n(%) \n75.0 \n3.7 \n21.3 \n100.0 \n\n\fAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency  \n \nImplementation \nArrangements/Plan \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\nloan \n\nfor  a \n\nin  special  drawing  rights,  equivalent \n\nThe  Government  has  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank \nto \n(ADB) \n$30 million from its Special Funds resources.

The Government will relend the proceeds of the \nloan to the Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency (UCSA) under \na subsidiary loan agreement. The relending will be made on ADB \nloan  terms,  with  an  additional  charge  of  not  more  than  0.2%  on \nthe  ADB  interest  rate  (1.2%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.7% \nyearly thereafter). UCSA will onlend the subsidiary loan proceeds \nto  the  Surkhandarya  provincial  government  (SPG),  which  will \nfurther onlend the proceeds to the subproject vodokanals, on the \nsame  terms.  SPG  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risks.  The \nGovernment  has  also \nthe \nstrengthening of sector strategy and management (component 1) \nand  capacity  development  for  service  delivery  (component  4) \nunder  the  Project.  To  finance  these  two  components,    the  Multi-\nDonor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility \nwill  provide  a  grant  of  $1.5  million  equivalent  to  be  administered \nby ADB. \n \nUntil 30 September 2014 \n \n31 March 2014 \n\nrequested  grant \n\nfinancing \n\nfor \n\n \nUzbekistan Communal Services Agency (UCSA) \n \nUCSA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project.

A project management unit \n(PMU)  within  UCSA  will  implement,  manage,  and  coordinate  all \nproject  activities.  A  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  directly \nin \nfor  day-to-day  subproject \nresponsible \nSurkhandarya Province will also be set up. \n \nTo  guide  project  implementation,  a  project  implementation  plan \nbased  on  the  project  schedule,  implementation  arrangements, \nprocurement  packages,  and  assurances  from  the  Government \nhas been developed during project preparation. The plan specifies \nthe  key  project  management,  implementation,  and  auditing  and \nimplementation  with  clear \nreporting  activities  during  project \nstarting  and  due  dates  for  each  activity,  responsible  parties,  and \nlinks between project activities.  \n \n\nimplementation \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\nGoods  and  works  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines (2007,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time)  and  the  procurement  plan  for  the  Project.  The \nprocurement  plan  will  be  updated  at  least  yearly  for  the  next  18 \nmonths of procurement activities. International competitive bidding \nprocedures  will  be  used  for  major  civil  works  contracts  costing \nmore than $2,000,000 equivalent and supply contracts worth more \nthan  $500,000  equivalent.  Civil  works  valued  at  $100,000\u2013\n$2,000,000  and  goods  valued  at  $100,000\u2013$500,000  will  be \nprocured  through  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB).  The  NCB \nannex  in  the  procurement  plan  summarizes  the  modifications  or \nclarifications  needed  in  the  Borrower\u2019s  procedures  to  enable  the \nBorrower \nto  carry  out  NCB  under  ADB-financed  projects. \nShopping  procedures  will  be  followed  for  works,  materials,  and \nequipment packages costing up to $100,000.  \n \nA \ntotal  of  568  person-months  of  consulting  services  (51 \ninternational  and  517  national)  will  be  required  to  (i)  develop  a \nwater  supply  and  wastewater  sector  strategy  and  investment \nprogram,  (ii) prepare  contract  packages  and  tender  documents, \n(iii) supervise  construction  and  evaluate  project  activities, \n(iv) guide  and  supervise  resettlement,  (v)  monitor  the  social  and \ngender  and  environmental  impact  of  the  Project,  (vi) coordinate \nthe  capacity  development  program,  (vii) implement  the  school \nsanitation  and  hygiene  program,  and  (viii)  support  the  other \nactivities of the PMU and PIU. The selection and engagement of \nconsulting  services  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time) and the procurement plan. \nThe selection will be based on one of the following: (i) the quality \nand cost of the services, according to the technical proposal (full \nor  simplified); \nfor  small \nassignments  that  cost  less  than  $200,000  per  contract;  or  (iii) \nindividual  consultant  selection \nfor  very  small  consultant \nassignments that cost less than $100,000. \n \n\n(ii) the  consultants\u2019  qualifications, \n\n\fProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nv\n\nThe  Project  will  benefit  about  340,000  residents  in  the  project \nareas  by  2014  by  providing  safe,  reliable,  and  inclusive  piped \nwater  supply,  improving  sanitation,  and  promoting  good  hygiene. \nThe  duration  of  water  supply  services  will  be  increased  to  20 \nhours a day by 2014 and 24 hours a day by 2020, unaccounted-\nfor water will be reduced to less than 40%, all project vodokanals \nwill  achieve  full  cost  recovery  from  2014  onward,  and  customer \ncomplaints  will  be  recorded  and  responded  to  promptly.  The \nProject  will  benefit  about  20%  of  the  population  of  the  province, \nand nearly 90% of the urban residents and over 30% of the rural \nresidents  of  the  seven  project  districts  and  Termez  City.  About \n32%  of  the  project  beneficiaries  are  poor.  While  both  men  and \nwomen will benefit from the Project, women will benefit more from \ntime savings, less drudgery, and better family health. In addition, \nthe  Project  will  help  the  Government  draw  up  a  coherent  vision \nand  strategy  for  WSS  sector  development.  The  PPP  framework \nwill  enable  the  Government  to  engage  private  participation  more \nefficiently in the sector. The institutional reforms that will transform \nvodokanals  into  business-oriented  service  providers\u2014financial \nand  tariff  reforms,  customer  registration,  complaint  response \nmechanism,  and  performance  benchmarking\u2014together  with \nmanagement  tools  and  capacity  development  programs,  will \nprovide vodokanals with more internal incentives and capability to \ndeliver better WSS services. \n \nFive  possible  risks  have  been  identified  and  addressed  in  the \nproject  design.  First,  the  risk  of  lack  of  commitment  to  a \ncomprehensive  sector  strategy  and \nis \naddressed by the broadly consultative and participatory approach \nto  the  strategy  study,  to  ensure  government  ownership  of  the \nstrategy,  road  map,  and  investment  program.  Second,  to  avert \ndelays  in  project start-up  caused  by  the  delayed  preparation  and \napproval of a nationwide feasibility study, feasibility studies for all \nsubprojects  have  been  conducted  and  completed  in  parallel  with \nthe  project  preparation  and  the  Government  has  endorsed  these \nstudies  before  loan  negotiations.  Third,  to  forestall  delays  in  the \nprovision  of  local  counterpart  funds,  assurances  have  been \nobtained from the Government that it will allocate and provide the \nfunds on time. Fourth, given the limited capability of vodokanals to \nmeet  the  incremental  operation  and  maintenance  costs  of  the \nexpanded  water  supply  systems,  the  capacity  development \ncomponent  of  the  Project  includes  management  improvement \nactivities, tariff and financial reforms, and targeted training. Lastly, \nto  guard  against \nthe  adverse  effects  of  resettlement  and \naffordability  issues  on  poor  and  vulnerable  households,  the \nresettlement  plans  and  other  due-diligence  arrangements  ensure \nthat all affected people will improve or at least maintain their living \nstandards  after  the  Project,  and  that  connection  charges  are \nremoved and payment for meters is spread over 3 years. \n\ninvestment  program \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Surkhandarya  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project  (the \nProject). \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nUzbekistan has  a population  of  26.6  million  (2006),  about 9.6  million  of  these,  or 37%, \nliving  in  urban  centers  and  17  million,  or  63%,  in  rural  areas.  Because  of  the  wide  range  of \nenvironments in the country, population density varies significantly, from 59 persons per square \nkilometer  (km2)  in  the  fertile  Fergana  Valley  to  6.6  persons  per  km2  in  the  central  Navoi \nProvince.  Traditionally  populations  were  grouped  around  natural  water  sources  including  the \nFergana Valley and old cities like Bukhara, Samarkhand, and Kiva.  \n \nAmong the regions in the country, Surkhandarya, with a population of about 1.92 million, \n3. \nis  the  eighth  most  populous.  Termez  City  (population  127,000)  and  Denau  City  (population \n68,000) are the main urban centers. A World Bank poverty study (2000) estimated that 28.4% of \nthe  population  of  Surkhandarya  Province  had  incomes  below  the  poverty  line.1 The  province, \nlocated  near  the  border  with  Afghanistan,  has  been  a  closed  province  for  many  years,  but \nrecent developments promoting Silk Road tourism and the construction of a new rail link has led \nto  opportunities  for  growth.  Surkhandarya  is  one  of  the  main  cotton-growing  provinces  in \nUzbekistan, with about 200,000 hectares under irrigated cotton. Most of the rural population is \ninvolved in growing, harvesting, and ginning cotton. \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nA massive irrigated agriculture expansion program was undertaken by the Soviet Union \n4. \nin  Uzbekistan  in  the  1960s  and  1970s.  Irrigation  was  based  around  1,500-  to  5,000-hectare \ncollective  farms.  Communities  were  established  on  each  collective  farm  and  supplied  with \npotable  water  from  a  system  sourced  and  developed  separately  from  the  irrigation  system. \nProvincial and district centers served these communes as urban administrative and commercial \ncenters\u2014a post-independence function they still have. \n \n5. \nWater is largely supplied from groundwater sources several tens of kilometers from the \nservice  area,  pumped  to  distribution  centers,  and  distributed  to  towns  and  villages.  As  local \nreserves  of  groundwater  are  often  saline  or  inadequate,  they  are  supplemented  with  water \nsupplied through a series of regional and interregional trunk mains. Under the Soviet Union, the \nsystems  were  overdesigned,  based  on  limited  evaluation  of  technical  options,  used  high \nconsumption  rates  (three times  the  current  average  in  the  Organisation  for  Economic \nCo-operation and Development countries), and cost a great deal to maintain and operate. Water \nproduction  facilities  and  customer  connections  were  not  metered,  so  consumption  and  tariffs \nwere based on normative values. Furthermore, all facilities were owned and operated by public \nenterprises  supervised  by  government  ministries  and  were  routinely  subsidized  from  the  state \nbudget. A 20% decline in gross domestic product after independence affected the availability of \nfunding to the water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector, which thus became unable to operate \nand maintain the systems. \n\n                                                 \n1   The  poverty  line  is  based  on  an  average  per  capita  per  day  consumption  below  2,100  kilocalories.  The  Project \nadopts the World Bank\u2019s methodology for establishing poverty rates in the country, which is largely based on this \nfood consumption indicator. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \nWater Supply. At independence in 1991, it was claimed that 89% of the population had \n6. \naccess  to  potable  water.  Reports  for  2006  from  vodokanals 2  (WSS  agencies)  and  the \nUzbekistan  Communal  Services  Agency  (UCSA)  estimated  network  coverage  at  82%  of  the \ntotal  population  (88%  of  the  urban  population  and  79%  of  the  rural  population).  Households, \nhowever, are supplied with water 6\u201324 hours a day in the urban areas and 2\u201312 hours3 a day in \nthe countryside. Surkhandarya Province has a network coverage of 76% (87% urban and 74% \nrural). Water is available 6\u201316 hours a day in the urban areas and 2\u201310 hours in the rural areas. \nNonperforming  (deteriorated  and  leaking)  infrastructure,  power  outages,  and  lack  of  revenue \nprevent  better  service.  With  water  supply  services  so  inadequate  and  unreliable,  the  people \nresort  to  collecting  water  from  untreated  open  sources  like  canals  and  streams  or  paying  for \nwater  from  vendors  or  tankers.  Only  10%  of  houses  are  metered,  making  it  difficult  to  assess \nactual  performance  and  consumption.  Consumption  is  therefore  assessed  on  the  basis  of \nnormative demand values.  \n \n7. \nNationwide, unaccounted-for water (UFW) from physical losses is officially estimated at \n41%,  but,  given  the  deteriorated  state  of  the  infrastructure,  this  figure  is  considered  low.  In \nSurkhandarya Province, combined with nonpayment of bills, UFW is possibly greater than 60%. \nThe  major  causes  of  UFW  are  system  losses  due  to  (i)  leakage  from  deteriorated  WSS \ninfrastructure  at  source,  along \nthe  distribution  networks,  and  at  consumer  points; \n(ii) overestimation of the amount of water produced, based on the normal capacity of the source \nrather  than  actual  production;  (iii)  illegal  connections;  and  (iv)  water  wastage  due  to  the \nirregularity of water supply and the lack of meters. \n \n8. \nSanitation.  Uzbekistan  has  265  cities  and  urban  settlements.  Of  these,  69  have \nwastewater treatment systems. The Government estimates sewerage system coverage at 51% \nof the population. However, most of the systems are not functioning properly. Rural and urban \npopulations not served by a centralized system use pit latrines near their homes. Termez, the \ncapital city of Surkhandarya Province, has a municipal wastewater treatment plant, which is now \nbeing rehabilitated and upgraded.4  \n \n9. \nGovernment  Policy.  Uzbekistan\u2019s  WSS  policy  and  regulatory  framework  derives  legal \nforce  from  (i)  the  national  10-year  water  supply  development  plan  approved  by  the  cabinet  of \nministers in 1999 (Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers (RCM) No. 278),5 (ii) a resolution of the \ncabinet  of  ministers  approved  in  2003  (RCM  No.  405),6 and  (iii)  the  water  supply  investment \nprogram for 2009\u20132012.7 The key objectives of the WSS policy are to (i) improve water sector \nservices  through  a  national  water  supply  development  plan;  (ii)  attain  financial  sustainability \nthrough  an  effective  tariff  system  and  cost  recovery;  (iii)  plan  adequate  investments  with \ndomestic  and  external  funding;  (iv)  achieve  further  decentralization  of  WSS  services;  (v) \nencourage  private  sector  participation  and  public-private  partnerships  in  the  sector;  (vi) \nimplement  hygiene  and  sanitation  education  programs  in  schools;  (vii)  achieve  improved \n                                                 \n2   The  vodokanals  are  either  state-owned  enterprises  or  limited-liability  companies  that  provide  water  supply  and \n\nsanitation services in their respective towns and districts. \n\n3   Households farthest from the water supply source may not be receiving services every day, and some households, \n\ne.g., communities in Muzarabad district, are not being served at all. \n\n4 The rehabilitation is being undertaken by the Government with its own funds. When completed by mid-August 2008, \nit is expected to increase capacity to 12,500 cubic meters (m3) (from the original 10,000 m3), exceeding the present \npeak demand of 11,000 cubic meters, reached on a few occasions during the winter. \n\n5   Cabinet  of  Ministers,  1  June  1999:  RCM  No.  278\u2013Steps  for  Further  Improvement  in  Providing  Rural  Settlements \nwith  Drinking  Water  and  Natural  Gas.  Also,  Minutes  of  3  April  and  14  May:  Preparation  of  a  Scheme  for  Water \nSupply Development to 2010. \n\n6   Cabinet of Ministers, 17 September 2003: RCM No. 405\u2013Additional Measures for the Improvement of the Supply of \n\nRural Settlement with Drinking Water and Natural Gas. \n\n7   Office of the President, 12 June 2008: Further Improvement of Potable Water Supply for the Populations of Rural \n\nSettlements and Towns and Economic use of Natural Gas. \n\n\fthe  sector \n\ninstitutional  setup  and \n\nlivelihood  conditions,  particularly  for  the  benefit  of  women;  (viii)  ensure  environmental \ncompliance by encouraging conservation of water resources, economic use of water, consistent \nwater  quality  control,  and  sound  management  of  wastewater;  and  (ix)  improve  further \noperational  strategies  by  strengthening \ninteragency \ncollaboration, and by promoting adequate capacity building. \n \n10. \nSector  Institutions.  Three  main  government  agencies  have  been  entrusted  with \nregulatory  responsibilities  related  to  water  resource  management  and  conservation.  The \nMinistry of Agriculture and Water Resources has overall responsibility for all large-scale surface \nwater  development  for  irrigation.  The  State  Committee  on  Geology  and  Mineral  Resources  is \nresponsible for  groundwater  investigation,  management,  monitoring,  and  protection.  The  State \nInspectorate for Regulating the Use of Water in Industry and Mining regulates the exploration, \ndevelopment, and conservation of thermal and mineral water.  \n \n11. \nUCSA  has  overall  responsibility  for  improving  WSS  services  in  the  country.  It  (i)  drafts \npolicies,  strategies,  and  standards  for  the  sector;  (ii)  provides  regulatory  advice  to  support \nreforms in the sector; (iii) monitors the compliance of local authorities and commercial entities \nwith sector policies; and (iv) attracts foreign investment to the sector. The Ministry of Economy, \nin  collaboration  with  UCSA,  has  a  significant  role  in  sector  planning,  while  the  Ministry  of \nFinance  reviews  tariffs  and  controls  and  approves  external  financing  for  the  sector.  The  State \nCommittee  for  De-monopolization  and  Supporting  Competition  and  Entrepreneurship  monitors \napplications for tariffs for all communal services, including WSS. The Department of Finance in \neach  province  is  authorized  to  approve  tariffs,  which  are  prepared  by  the  urban  and  district \nvodokanals in their respective provinces. \n \nThe State Committee for Nature Protection is entrusted with the task of protecting and \n12. \nmanaging  the  environment.  The  state  committee  implements  the  government  policy  of \nprotecting  natural  environment  and  water  resources  by  monitoring  compliance  with  standards \nfor  urban  and  industrial  effluents.  The  State  Sanitary  and  Epidemiological  Inspectorate,  a \ndepartment  of  the  Ministry  of  Health,  implements  sanitary  supervision  of  drinking  water  for \ncompliance  with  national  sanitary  norms.  Through  its  provincial  and  district  sanitary  and \nepidemiological services (SES) divisions, the state inspectorate monitors the quality of drinking \nwater in both urban and rural distribution networks, and the environmental health conditions in \npublic sanitation facilities. \n \n13. \nThe  day-to-day  WSS  services  are  operated  by  district  and  city  vodokanals.  The \nprovincial administration receives reports from the provincial vodokanal, which coordinates and \nmonitors  the  performance  of  the  district  and  city  vodokanals  in  the  province.  In  addition,  six \ninterregional  water  supply  agencies  manage  and  operate  interregional  trunk  mains  in  the \ncountry.  These  agencies  cover  several  districts  or  even  operate  across  provinces.  They \nabstract,  transmit,  and  distribute  water  to  consumers.  Some  supply  water  in  bulk  to  district  or \ncity vodokanals, while others operate as large vodokanals. \n \n14. \nSector  Reforms.  The  Government  of  Uzbekistan  recognizes  the  need  to  reform  the \noperation and management of the WSS sector according to market economy principles. It has \ntherefore  begun  a  number  of  key  reforms  including  (i)  gaining  access  to  external  funding  for \ncapital works, (ii) metering customer supply, (iii) decentralizing responsibility for the day-to-day \nrunning of the facilities to the vodokanals, and (iv) allowing tariffs to reflect the full cost recovery \nof investment. The WSS sector was targeted for privatization in 2002. But privatization, which in \nthis  case  meant  divestment  of  assets,  failed  to  attract  support  because  of  the  lack  of  a \nwell-developed  regulatory  framework,  the  poor  condition  of  the  systems,  and  the  insufficient \nnumber of qualified private sector investors. \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n15. \nSector  Development  Targets.  The  National  Water  Supply  Development  Program \n(NWSDP) developed in 1999 targeted close to 100% coverage in most urban areas and 85% in \nrural areas by 2010. This goal is unattainable. World Bank estimates suggest that infrastructure \ninvestment in the order of $1.4 billion will just about cover the rehabilitation of the infrastructure. \nTwice  as  much  could  be  needed  to  increase  population  coverage  and  reach  the  goals  of  the \nNWSDP.  A  revised  strategy  is  needed  to  revisit  the  targets  and  the  NWSDP,  taking  into \nconsideration integrated water resource management, cost-effective options for developing the \nWSS systems, the needed reforms, and nonphysical interventions. \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nlimited \n\ninappropriate  standards, \n\n16. \nThe  WSS  systems  inherited  from  the  Soviet  Union  have  reached  the  end  of  their \neconomic life and require extensive rehabilitation. The provision of reliable, safe, and affordable \nWSS  services  to  the  population,  in  the  face  of  deteriorated  infrastructure,  an  outdated  sector \nstrategy  and  planning, \nfinancial  resources,  and  weak \ninstitutional  capacity,  is  a  key  challenge  to  the  Government.  A  problem  tree  analysis  of  the \nsector is presented in Appendix 1. \n \n17. \nInfrastructure  Constraints.  Despite  being  increasingly  difficult  to  maintain,  an \nextensive  network  still  exists,  albeit  operating  at  low  service  levels.  Most  of  the  systems  were \nbuilt  with  materials  and  equipment  of  poor  quality.  Water  supply  pipes  are  made  of  untreated \nsteel,  so  corrosion  presents  a  problem  for  both  short-term  maintenance  and  long-term \ndepreciation.  Submersible  pumps  function  for  less  than  a  year  before  requiring  a  major \noverhaul. 8 With  limited  funds,  vodokanals  routinely  rewind  burned-out  electrical  motors  and \ncarry  out  \u201cBand-Aid\u201d  operations  on  leaking  pipes  just  to  keep  the  systems  operating  at  a  low \nlevel of service. High-density polyethylene pipes and high-grade equipment are now available in \nthe country and, where funds permit, are being used in systems rehabilitation. The assessment \nby the World Bank suggests that 60% of the infrastructure needs to be replaced.  \n \nOutdated  Sector  Strategy  and  Planning.  Planning  in  the  sector  remains  highly \n18. \ncentralized and focused on the simple replacement of pipes, pumps, and wells as the basis for \ndetermining investment needs. This implies that centralized pipe networks or sewerage systems \nwill  be  rehabilitated  or  new  ones  built  exactly  as  they  were  20\u201350  years  ago.  Alternative \nleast-cost  solutions  are  not  sought.  For  the  sector  to  function  efficiently,  planning  must  be \ndecentralized to allow local planners to develop their own options. Planning data are unreliable, \nand often consist of a collection of physical information (such as kilometers of pipe laid) rather \nthan  information  about  key  outcomes,  such  as  actual  service  coverage  and  quality  of  service \nprovided. The investment plan prepared under the NWSDP covers only investment needs until \n2010 and is outdated and inaccurate. For a more accurate assessment of long-term investment \nneeds, a sector road map and a comprehensive sector development program must be prepared \nto  reflect  actual  service  coverage  and  conditions,  and  identify  the  measures  and  investments \nneeded  to  achieve  the  sector\u2019s  goals  up  to  2020.  Although  the  Government  is  interested  in \npromoting private sector involvement in WSS service provision, policy and regulatory support is \ninadequate and the sector needs to be restructured to attract more private interest. To promote \npublic-private partnership (PPP) in the sector more efficiently, a comprehensive study is needed \nto understand the PPP potentials, major constraints, and opportunities. \n \n19. \nInappropriate Standards and Designs. Standards used in Uzbekistan are derived from \nthose that were used in the Soviet Union. Consumption levels for consumers have been set at \n100\u2013350  liters  per  capita  per  day  (lpcd),  leading  to  the  design  of  high-capacity  systems  and \n\n                                                 \n8  Ebinger,  Jane.  2006.  Measuring  Financial  Performance  in  Infrastructure:  An  Application  to  Europe  and  Central \n\nAsia. World Bank: Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\flarge  pipes  and  pumps.  Systems  are  thus  highly  capitalized,  and  the  combination  of  long \npipelines  and  high  flow  rates  have  resulted  in  high  energy  consumption  and  high  operating \ncosts.  Rigid  design  standards  make  it  difficult  to  apply  alternative  service  options,  such  as \ntanker  delivery  to  remote  rural  communities.  In  the  sanitation  sector,  all  wastewater  treatment \nplants  follow  a  similar  design.  Alternatives  such  as  stabilization  ponds  (with  anaerobic, \nfacultative, and maturation lagoons) may be cost-effective and environmentally sound options in \nareas with access to agricultural land. Methane gas can be extracted from the anaerobic ponds \nfor  energy  and  the  treated  water  used  for  irrigation.  But  these  options  have  not  yet  been \nconsidered.  \n \n20. \nLimited  Financial  Resources.  WSS  services  under  the  Soviet  Union  were  heavily \nsubsidized  by  the  central  government.  System  planning  did  not  focus  on  cost  recovery  or \nleast-cost design options. Consumption was based on normative design values and tariffs were \nset at a nominal rate and de-linked from required capital and operation and maintenance (O&M) \ncosts for sustainable service provision. A disconnection policy was in place but rarely enforced; \nquite  often  consumers  were  able  to  negotiate  a  partial  payment.  The  cash  flow  problem  this \ncreated rendered the vodokanals unable to meet O&M costs, let alone depreciation allowance \nand capital requirements for system expansion. As a result, they cut routine maintenance and \nreduced  service  duration  to  control  operating  costs.  With  no  capital  reserves,  the  vodokanals \noften  had  to  resort  to  emergency  funds  from  the  provincial  government  or  even  on  occasion \nfrom  the  makhalla 9  committees  to  replace  worn-out  equipment,  often  with  poor-quality \nreplacements. The consumers, poorly served, understandably resisted paying for the services. \nThe average collection rate is still only about 50%. \n \n21.  Weak Institutional Capacity. Institutional capacity at all levels is weak. UCSA, which is \nresponsible  for  the  overall  management  and  development  of  the  sector,  mostly  identifies \nprojects for external funding, implements investment projects, and manages interregional trunk \nmains. It has limited capability to address long-term sector needs such as sector strategies and \nplans,  as  well  as  guidelines  for  assessing  projects  and  preparing  project  proposals,  and  for \ntransmitting  this  information  to  the  provinces.  The  vodokanals,  which  are  responsible  for \noperating the water supply systems, need to manage better and improve their technical capacity. \nVodokanal  staff  have  little  opportunity  for  internal  training.  Positions  do  not  come  with  duty \nstatements, and there are no operations manuals or maintenance logs. Functioning offices with \nfiling systems are rare. The consumer database does not reflect all consumers and there is little \ncustomer  orientation.  UFW  is  impossible  to  determine,  and  performance  monitoring  and \nbenchmarking systems are rarely adopted. \n \nNeed  for  Integrated  Water  Resources  Management.  Water  resources  management \n22. \nfor surface waters is the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources and \ngroundwater  that  of  the  State  Committee  on  Geology  and  Mineral  Resources,  and  the  WSS \nsector  is  under  UCSA.  While  the  WSS  sector  uses  only  about  3.8%  of  water  resources,  high \nstandards  are  required  to  maintain  potable  quality.  National  and  provincial  planning  should \nensure that estimates of known groundwater reserves are updated regularly, and that resources \nare  protected  for  future  use.  Leakage  of  drainage  water  from  irrigation  has  salinized  some \nshallow aquifers, which could have been used as local water sources for rural communities.  \n \n23. \nThe Project will deal with these challenges and support sector development by tackling \nfour issues: (i) shortfalls in policy and standards, (ii) investment needs, (iii) sector and business \nmanagement, and (iv) operational and institutional gaps. The Project will work with both national \nand provincial governments. At the national level, the Project will help the Government to build a \nvision  and  a  big  picture  for  the  sector  as  a  whole  by  strengthening  the  essential  policies  and \n\n                                                 \n9 The smallest administrative group in a community. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fstrategies, developing a sector road map, and preparing a comprehensive sector development \nprogram. A PPP framework will also be prepared together with the sector strategy to enable the \nGovernment  to  promote  private  sector  involvement  in  the  sector  in  a  systematic  way. \nExperience from the KfW-funded PPP program with Obi Hayot (a private agricultural company) \ninvolving  water  supply  and  sanitation  service  improvements  at  seven  farms  will  provide  an \nexample for possible future investments.  \n \n24. \nAt  the  provincial  level,  the  Project  will  set  up  an  urban  WSS  services  model  in \nSurkhandarya Province, which can be replicated and expanded in other provinces. The service \nimprovement  targets  of  the  Project  are  given  in  Table  1.  Besides  investments  in  physical \ninfrastructure  for  system  rehabilitation  and  necessary  upgrading,  the  Project  will  address  the \ncritical  planning,  management,  financial,  operational,  and  customer  relations  needs  of  the \nvodokanals.  These  will  entail  changing  the  business  culture,  introducing  and  strengthening \nplanning  tools  and  processes,  computerizing  financial  management  systems,  modernizing \naccounting  and  reporting  standards,  reforming  tariffs  to  allow  full  cost  recovery,  developing  a \ncustomer  database  and  customer  care  systems,  improving  collection  procedures  and \nprocesses,  developing  operational  manuals,  introducing  a  performance  benchmarking  system, \nand providing associated training. A design and monitoring framework for the Project is provided \nin Appendix 2 and a project road map is in Appendix 3. \n \n\nTable 1: Service Improvement Targets \n\nIndicator \nSystem coverage \nService duration \nUnaccounted-for water \n\nCurrent Level \n76% \n2\u201310 hrs \n>60% \n\nProject Target \n>85% \n>20 hrs \n<40% \n\n \n25. \nExternal  Assistance.  External  financiers  in  the  Uzbekistan  WSS  sector  include  ,  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development, \nGerman  development  cooperation  through  KfW,  World  Bank,  and  the  governments  of  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  France,  Germany,  Japan,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Spain, \nSwitzerland, and the US. As of 2007, external assistance to the sector amounted to about $270 \nmillion  equivalent\u2014about  $140  million  rural  and  $130  million  urban.  In  addition,  KfW  financed \nthe  improvement  of  water  supply  in  seven  rural  farm  areas  in  Khorezm  with  \u20ac12.3 million \nthrough Obi Hayot, a private operator. The Government of PRC has made a concessional loan \nof $17.3 million for a national water meter installation program. External assistance to the sector \nis  summarized  in  Appendix  4.  Project  preparation  is  being  coordinated  closely  with  the \ndevelopment  partners  to  ensure  consistency  in  institutional  approaches  and  a  coordinated \npolicy approach with the Government. \n \n26. \nLessons.  The  project  design  pays  special  attention  to  avoiding  the  following  problems \nencountered  in  previous  WSS  projects:  (i)  start-up  delays  related  to  delayed  project  feasibility \nstudy  preparation  and  approval,  (ii)  funding  scattered  over  several  provinces  and  wide \ngeographic areas with little scope for achieving a critical mass, (iii) unnecessary complexity in \nproject  design  and  implementation,  (iv)  lack  of  a  sector  strategy  and  updated  comprehensive \ninvestment  plan,  (v)  need  to  inculcate  a  commercial  customer  orientation  in  the  vodokanals, \n(vi) need  to  allocate  sufficient  funds  for  developing  management  and  operational  skills  of \nvodokanals, (vii) need for performance monitoring and benchmarking of vodokanals to monitor \nproject  impact  and  provide  accurate  information  for  vodokanal  management  and  operations, \nand (viii) inadequate counterpart project financing. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n27.  When completed in 2014, the Project will improve living standards, the environment, and \npublic health for about 340,000 people living in Surkhandarya Province. Its outcome will be safe, \nreliable,  inclusive,  and  sustainable  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  and  improved \ncommunity hygiene. \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n28. \n\nThe Project has five components: \n\n1. \n\nStrengthening of Sector Strategy and Management \n\n29. \nThis  component  will  promote  the  economic  use  of  water  resources  and  improve  water \nsupply  and  wastewater  sector  planning  and  management.  It  comprises  the  development  of \n(i)   an  integrated  water  sector  profile;  (ii)  a  water  supply  and  wastewater  sector  strategy, \nincluding  a  PPP  framework;  and  (iii)  a  water  supply  and  wastewater  sector  development  road \nmap  and  comprehensive  investment  plan.  Sector  issues  and  constraints\u2014restructuring  for \ntechnical  options  and  models,  corporate  governance  and \neconomic  scale, \nmanagement,  regulatory  framework  and  proper  PPP  models,  tariff  and  cost  recovery,  and \ncapacity development\u2014will be analyzed in detail. Reforms recommended for dealing with these \nconstraints  will  be  incorporated  into  an  action-oriented  road  map  and  reflected  in  the  sector \ninvestment program. The analytical work will lay a solid foundation for progressively addressing \nthe sector development issues. Details of this component are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\nleast-cost \n\n2. \n\nWater Supply Development \n\n30. \nThis component will develop safe, affordable, and reliable piped water supply systems. It \ninvolves  the  development  of  (i)  boreholes  at  identified  groundwater  sources,  (ii) water \ntransmission facilities, (iii) service reservoirs, (iv) chlorination facilities, (v) distribution networks, \n(vi) individual metered service connections, and (vii) structural improvements in office buildings \nfor  each  subproject.  Equipment  for  O&M  of  the  water  supply  systems  will  also  be  procured \nunder  this  component.  Appropriate  PPP  models  for  water  supply  service  delivery  will  also  be \nexplored and possibly pilot tested, if such potential exists. \n \nThe  subprojects  selected 10  all  share  the  following  characteristics:  (i) a  partially \n31. \nfunctioning  water  supply  system,  (ii)  closeness  to  a  surface  or  groundwater  source, \n(iii) closeness to water trunk mains, and (iv) good economic growth prospects. The focus on city \nand district centers and surrounding settlements has three significant advantages. It (i) provides \na critical mass of domestic consumers and commercial businesses, (ii) allows the vodokanals to \noperate  as  financially  viable  enterprises,  and  (iii)  establishes  a  strong  core  operational  group, \nwhich will allow phased expansion to other settlements in future years. \n\n3. \n\nSanitation and Hygiene \n\nThis  component  will  develop  improved  sanitation  practices  and  positive  hygiene \n32. \nbehavior  among  schoolchildren  to  prevent  disease  and  ensure  maximum  health  benefits  from \nthe  improved  infrastructure  services.  Safe  drinking  water  will  be  provided  to  all  schools  in  the \n                                                 \n10 Termez city and the districts of Angor, Djarkurgan, Kizirik, Kumkurgan, Muzrabad, Sariasiya, and Shurchi. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nproject  areas  as  part  of  the  water  supply  component.  This  component  will  provide \ncomplementary investment in (i) toilet blocks for a selected number of schools, and (ii) hygiene \npromotion  activities  in  all  schools  in  the  project  areas.  Children  are  the  key  target  group  for \nhygiene  activities,  and  schools  are  the  entry  point.  Gender-specific  actions  relating  to  hygiene \npromotion  are  set  out  in  the  gender  action  plan.  The  activities  and  hygiene  messages  will  be \nappropriately  sequenced  with  WSS  investments,  and  innovative  and  imaginative  ways  will  be \nused  to  spread  hygiene  messages.  The  program  will  develop  a  network  of  stakeholders  to \nsupport  the  activities,  including  neighborhood  makhalla  committees,  schoolteachers,  and \nnongovernment  organizations  such  as  the  Red  Crescent.  A  baseline  survey  and  follow-up \nsurveys  will  be  financed  to  guide  the  development  of  targeted  hygiene  messages  and  an \nassessment  of  the  impact  of  the  activities.  Details  of  this  component  are  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n\n4. \n\nCapacity Development for Service Delivery \n\nThis  component  will \n\nimprove  management  capacity  and  efficiency, \n\n33. \nfoster \nprofessionalism  among  the  vodokanals,  and  develop  a  better  customer  orientation  to  improve \nservices  in  the  long  term.  The  component  will  finance  investments  in  (i)  vodokanal  office \nfurniture  and  basic  office  equipment  to  computerize  the  management  of  vodokanals; \n(ii) technical, operational, and management training for vodokanals, and guidance and training \nin  public  awareness  and  customer  care  systems  for  vodokanals  and  a  range  of  stakeholders, \nincluding makhalla committees, communities, schoolteachers, women, and households; (iii) the \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  a  performance  monitoring  and  benchmarking  system  for \nvodokanals  in  Surkhandarya;  and  (iv)  study  tours  to  expose  vodokanal  staff  and  key \ngovernment  officials  to  national  and  international  best  practices  in  professional  WSS  delivery. \nDetails of this component are provided in Supplementary Appendix C. Gender issues in training \nand gender-sensitive training activities are set out in the gender action plan. \n\n5. \n\nProject Implementation Assistance \n\n34. \nThis  component  will  provide  project  management  support  to  the  project  management \nunit  (PMU)  and  the  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  in  implementing  the  Project.  Assistance \nwill  be  provided  in  (i)  project  management  and  monitoring;  (ii)  bid  document  preparation  and \nprocess  management;  (iii)  bid  evaluation;  (iv) \nfinancial  management  and  accounting; \n(v) construction  supervision;  (vi)  social,  environment,  and  resettlement  management  and \nmonitoring; and (vii) incremental administrative costing for the PMU and the PIU.  \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n35. \nLong\u2013Term  Partnership  and  Public-Private  Partnerships.  The  Project  will  pave  the \nway for a long-term partnership with the Government in the WSS sector. It will work with both \nnational and provincial governments. At the national level, the Project will help the Government \nbuild a vision for the sector by strengthening the essential policies and strategies, developing a \nsector  road  map,  and  preparing  a  comprehensive  sector  development  program  and  a  PPP \nframework.  At  the  provincial  level,  the  Project  will  set  up  an  urban  WSS  services  model  in \nSurkhandarya  Province,  which  can  be  replicated  and  expanded  in  other  provinces.  Besides \ninvestments  in  physical  infrastructure  for  system  rehabilitation  and  necessary  upgrading,  the \nProject  will  address  the  critical  planning,  management,  financial,  operational,  and  customer \nrelations needs of the provincial and district vodokanals. Private operators will be involved in the \nformulation of sector strategy and the design of the PPP framework. PPP pilot projects11 will be \n\n                                                 \n11 Management contracts for operating and maintaining the project facilities. \n\n\fimplemented.  The  involvement  of  the  private  operators  from  the  early  stages  of  project \nimplementation  will  ensure  that  the  sector  strategy  and  PPP  framework  are  responsive  to \nprivate  sector  development.  The  pilot  projects  will  target  small  towns,  the  easiest  market \nsegment for private operators to start with in Uzbekistan. \n \nChange  in  Business  Culture  and  Management.  Because  of  the  heavy  subsidies \n36. \ntraditionally provided to the sector, as well as the deteriorated systems, inadequate resources, \nlow  tariffs,  and  poor  payment  discipline  in  the  sector,  water  supply  in  Uzbekistan  is  widely \nperceived  to  be  a  loss-suffering  business.  The  vodokanals  have  become  reactive  service \nproviders  without  adequate  incentives  to  expand  their  customer  base.  As  a  result,  their \nmanagement  is  not  forward-looking,  their  staff  members  are  inadequately  motivated,  daily \noperating procedures are abandoned, and consumer complaints are not properly recorded and \nresponded  to.  The  Project  will  demonstrate  the  financial  viability  of  water  supply  services  and \nmake  the  vodokanals  more  autonomous  and  accountable,  by  investing  in  infrastructure \nimprovements,  introducing  needed  institutional  and  financial  reforms,  and  enhancing  the  skills \nand  capability  of  vodokanal  staff.  Vodokanals  will  be  given  more  incentives  to  improve  their \nperformance and expand their business, procedures will be prepared and implemented in daily \noperations,  performance  will  be  benchmarked,  and  a  consumer  complaint  mechanism  will  be \ndeveloped and adopted. The vodokanals should thus be transformed gradually from reactive to \nbusiness-oriented  service  providers,  with  a  forward-looking  strategy  and  internal  incentives  to \nupgrade knowledge and skills, control costs, improve performance, and expand their customer \nbase. Consumers\u2019 rights and customer contracts between the vodokanals and their customers \nwill become a core part of the vodokanals\u2019 business culture. \n \n37.  Metering. The water meter is the cash register and a critical management tool in water \nfor  water \nsupply  systems.  Together  with  volumetric  pricing, \nconservation,  thereby  protecting  water  resources  and  enabling  the  postponement  of  costly \nsystem expansion. It also allows vodokanals to better locate distribution losses and charge for \nwater consumption on the basis of use\u2014generally perceived to be the fairest way of allocating \nthe costs of water supply to users. However, most water consumers and water production and \npumping facilities in Uzbekistan are not metered, preventing vodokanals from properly planning, \ncharging  for,  and  measuring  their  operation.  The  Project  will  provide  water  meters  for  all \nproduction, distribution, and consumption, and thereby create an essential foundation for many \naspects  of  vodokanal  operations,  including  business  planning  and  management,  water  loss \nreduction, efficient O&M, revenue collection, and performance measurement and targeting. \n \n38. \nimportant \nmanagement  and  planning  tool  for  utility  management.  The  results  of  the  benchmarking \nprogram will help sector decision makers and vodokanal managers understand more precisely \nwater  supply  service  performance,  difficulties, and  challenges,  and compare  performance  with \nother  water  utilities  in  the  region,  the  country,  and  even  worldwide.  The  decision  makers  and \nmanagers  can  thus  come  up  with  more  relevant  decisions  and  actions  to  improve  sector \nmanagement and development, set realistic service targets, and strengthen the performance of \nvodokanals.  Performance  benchmarking  is  also  essential  in  sector  regulation  and  provides \nimportant reference information for setting service standards and reviewing tariffs. Performance \nbenchmarking  is  not  practiced  in  Uzbekistan,  however,  mainly  because  there  are  not  enough \nmeters  installed.  Once  meters  are  installed,  the  Project  will  help  each  subproject  vodokanal \ndevelop and implement a simple benchmarking system with one or two indicators for each key \nperformance  area  (technical,  financial,  institutional,  and  customer  services).  Training  will  be \nprovided  to  build  the  capacity  to  collect,  analyze,  and  compare  the  data  as  part  of  ongoing \nperformance  monitoring.  This  process  of  performance  monitoring  will  help  set  the  basis  for \nfurther reforms in the sector, including PPPs. \n\nPerformance  Benchmarking.  Performance  benchmarking \n\nit  provides  an \n\nis  another \n\nincentive \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n39. \nA  project  investment  of  about  $40.0  million  equivalent,  including  taxes  and  duties  of \nabout $5.7 million equivalent, is foreseen.

An  interministerial  project  steering  committee  will  provide  overall  policy \ndirection  and  guidance.  It  will  oversee  project  implementation,  facilitate  cooperation  and \ncoordination among the agencies concerned, and ensure the timely implementation of the policy \nand institutional reform agenda of the Project. The committee will be established and chaired by \na deputy prime minister from the cabinet of ministers, and will comprise senior officials of UCSA; \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance;  the  Ministry  of  Economy;  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Economic  Relations, \nInvestments, and Trade; the State Committee for Nature Protection; the Ministry of Health; the \nMinistry of Public Education; SPG; and other agencies concerned. The committee will meet as \noften  as  required,  but  at  least  once  every  6 months,  to  review  and  discuss  project \nimplementation. \n \n43. \nUCSA,  the  EA,  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  project  coordination,  implementation, \nand cooperation with ADB and with other government ministries and departments. The agency \nis  headed  by  a  director  general,  who  is  assisted  by  one  deputy  and  29  professional  and \ntechnical staff.  Having  been  the  EA  for  two  earlier  projects  supported  by  ADB,  UCSA  has  the \nrequired technical, financial, and managerial capability to implement the Project. It meets ADB\u2019s \nminimum  financial  management  requirements  and  has  the  financial  management  capability  to \nsatisfactorily  record  all  transactions  and  balances,  support  the  preparation  of  regular  and \nreliable  financial  statements  and  financial  monitoring  reports,  and  arrange  for  annual  audits  to \nbe  carried  out  in  a  manner  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  UCSA  training  center  is  also  equipped  to \ndevelop the necessary capacity in the sector, including the capacity for project implementation \nand management. \n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nA PMU15 will be set up in UCSA before the loan negotiations to (i) continue the project \n44. \npreparatory  work;  (ii)  supervise  overall  project  implementation,  budgeting,  financial  planning, \nand  accounting;  (iii)  recruit  the  consultants  and  coordinate  and  supervise  their  activities, \nadminister  their  contracts,  and  procure  civil  works  and  goods  for  the  Project;  (iv)  provide \nadministrative  and  technical  support  to  the  PIU;  (v)  prepare  consolidated  project  progress \nreports  and  a  project  completion  report;  and  (vi)  consolidate  project  accounting,  auditing,  and \nmonitoring and reporting to ADB, the Government, and other stakeholders.  \n \nA  PIU16 will  be  set  up  in  Surkhandarya  Province  before  the  loan  takes  effect.  The  PIU \n45. \nwill  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  project  implementation  at  the  local  level.  Its  major \nresponsibilities  will  involve  (i)  participating  in  project  planning,  detailed  design,  and  bid \nevaluation;  (ii)  coordinating  the  activities  of  consultants  and  contractors  in  the  province; \n(iii) overseeing  construction  activities;  (iv)  coordinating  resettlement;  (v)  monitoring  the  social \nand  gender  and  environmental  impact  of  the  project  activities;  (vi)  supervising  local \ncapacity-building  activities;  and,  (vii)  preparing  and  consolidating  subproject  accounting, \nauditing, and monitoring reports for submission to the PMU. \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years,  from  early  2009  to  March  2014.  The \n\n46. \nimplementation schedule is presented in Appendix 7.  \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nGoods  and  works  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s \n47. \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and the procurement plan for the \nProject.  The  procurement  plan  will  be  updated  at  least  yearly  for  the  next  18  months  of \nprocurement activities. International competitive bidding procedures will be used for major civil \nworks contracts costing more than $2,000,000 equivalent and supply contracts worth more than \n$500,000  equivalent.  Civil  works  valued  at  $100,000\u2013$2,000,000  and  goods  valued  at \n$100,000\u2013$500,000  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  according  to \nthe  NCB  annex  in  the  procurement  plan,  which  summarizes  modifications  or  clarifications \nneeded  in  the  Borrower\u2019s  procedures  to  enable  it  to  carry  out  NCB  under  ADB-financed \nprojects.  Shopping  procedures  will  be  followed  for  works,  materials,  and  equipment  packages \ncosting  up  to  $100,000.  Indicative  contract  packages  and  applicable  procurement  procedures \nare listed in Appendix 8. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n48. \nA total of 568 person-months of consulting services (51 international and 517 national) \nwill be required in the fields of project management, water resource planning and management, \nWSS  engineering,  wastewater  management,  environmental  assessment  and  management, \nhydrogeology, financing and accounting, social assessment and safeguarding, and institutional \ndevelopment  and  support.  The  consultants  will  assist  in  (i)  developing  a  water  supply  and \nwastewater  sector  strategy  and  investment  program,  (ii)  preparing  contract  packages  and \n\n                                                 \n15  The PMU will consist of (i) a project director; (ii) a deputy project director, who will also serve as the sector strategy \nstudy  manager;  (iii)  a  financial  specialist\u2013cum\u2013accountant;  (iv)  a  water  supply  and  sanitation  specialist,  (v)  a \nprocurement  specialist,  (vii)  a  monitoring  and  environment  specialist,  (vii)  a  driver,  and  (vi)  an  office  manager\u2013\ncum\u2013translator.  \n\n16 The  PIU  will  consist  of  (i)  a  project  coordinator;  (ii)  a  financial  specialist\u2013cum\u2013accountant;  (iii)  a  water  supply \ndesign  specialist;  (iv)  a  monitoring,  social  issues,  and  resettlement  specialist;  (v)  a  driver;  and  (vi)  an  office \nmanager\u2013cum\u2013translator. \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\ntender  documents  and  procuring  goods  and  services,  (iii)  supervising  construction  and \nevaluating project activities, (iv) guiding and supervising resettlement, (v) monitoring the social \nand  gender  and  environmental  impact  of  project  activities,  (vi)  coordinating  the  capacity \ndevelopment  program,  (vii)  implementing  the  school  sanitation  and  hygiene  program,  and \n(viii) supporting other activities of the PMU and the PIU.  \n \n49. \nThe  selection  and  engagement  of  consulting  services  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time) and the procurement plan. Their selection will be based on: (i) the quality and \ncost of the services, according to the technical proposal (full or simplified); (ii) the consultants\u2019 \nqualifications, for small assignments costing less than $200,000 per contract; and (iii) individual \nconsultant  selection,  for  very  small  assignments  costing  less  than  $100,000.  The  consulting \nservice  contract  packages  and  applicable  recruitment  methods  are  set  out  in  Appendix  8. \nOutline terms of reference for the consulting services for project implementation assistance are \ngiven in Appendix 9.  \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n50. \nThe Government has undertaken a series of measures, which can be considered part of \nits  anticorruption  plan.  These  include  (i)  legal  reforms  intended  to  improve  the  fairness  and \neffectiveness of judiciary and court system; (ii) reform of public sector management, especially \npublic  financial  management  and  tax  reforms;  (iii)  de-monopolization  measures  to  make  the \nprivate sector more competitive; and (iv) procurement measures. The Government is also active \nin  international  anticorruption  activities;  in  2008  it  approved  a  bill  proposing  the  country\u2019s \ninclusion in the UN Anti-Corruption Convention. \n \n51. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  UCSA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  will  be  included  in \nthe  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. EA, PMU, and PIU staff \nwill receive training in ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy under the project implementation assistance \ncomponent. \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nThe loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \n52. \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  make  sure  that  the  loan  proceeds  and \ncounterpart funds are released on time and to speed up project implementation, UCSA, as the \nEA,  will  establish  and  maintain  imprest  accounts  immediately  after  the  loan  takes  effect  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.17  UCSA will be responsible for the use, \nmanagement,  replenishment,  and  liquidation  of  the  project  imprest  accounts,  under  the \nsupervision of the Ministry of Finance. \n  \nDisbursements  from  the  imprest  accounts  will  be  supported  by  appropriate  withdrawal \n53. \napplications  and  related  documentation.  Such  documentation  will  demonstrate  that  the  works, \n\n                                                 \n17 There will be two separate imprest accounts\u2014one for the loan and one for the grant. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\ngoods, or services (i) were produced in and procured from ADB member countries, and (ii) are \neligible for ADB financing. The initial amount to be deposited into each imprest account will not \nexceed the estimated expenditure to be funded from the imprest account in the first 6 months or \n10%  of  the  amount  of  the  loan  or  grant,  whichever  is  less.  Eligible  expenditures  may  be \nreimbursed  and  liquidated,  and  the  corresponding  imprest  account  replenished,  through  the \nstatement-of-expenditure (SOE) procedure; each payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under \nthis procedure should not exceed $100,000 in the case of the loan or $10,000 in the case of the \ngrant. \n \nThe PIU will set up subproject accounts with a commercial bank acceptable to ADB, and \n54. \nwill  be  responsible  for  the  use,  management,  replenishment,  and  liquidation  of  the  accounts, \nbased on the submission of full supporting documentation to the PMU. \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n55. \nThe UCSA, through the PMU, the SPG, and the PIU, will (i) maintain separate accounts \nfor the Project, and (ii) have such accounts and related financial statements audited annually by \nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB, as provided in the Loan Agreement and required by \nADB for the financial reporting and auditing of ADB-financed projects. The imprest accounts and \nSOE  records  will  also  be  audited  during  the  annual  audit  and  a  separate  audit  opinion  on  the \nuse of each imprest account and SOE will be submitted to ADB. Certified copies of such audited \naccounts and financial statements in English, and the related reports of auditors, also in English, \nwill be submitted by the Government to ADB within 6 months after each financial year. For this \npurpose, the Government may use the proceeds of the loan or the grant (or both) to finance the \nservices of private sector auditors and the translation of their reports into English, provided that \nsuch auditors (i) have qualifications, expertise, and terms of reference acceptable to ADB; and \n(ii) have been recruited in a manner acceptable to ADB. \n \n56. \nUCSA  will  submit  to  ADB  consolidated  quarterly  progress  reports  in  English  on  all \naspects  of  project  implementation,  including  resettlement.  The  reports  will  give  the  details  of \noverall  implementation  progress,  problems  encountered  during  the  reporting  period,  measures \ntaken  or  proposed  to  remedy  these  problems,  and  the  proposed  program  of  activities  for  the \nnext quarter. Within 3 months of project completion, UCSA will prepare and submit to ADB, in a \nformat  acceptable  to  ADB,  a  project  completion  report  on  the  use  and  impact  of  the  loan;  the \nperformance  of  the  Project;  the  economic  and  social  benefits  generated;  and  implementation, \ncosts, and resettlement, details as well as other information requested by ADB. \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n57. \nThe  PMU  will  implement  a  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  for  each \nsubproject to evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the subproject benefits accrued. \nA  system  framework  and  indicative  indicators  have  been  prepared.  The  PMU,  with  the \nassistance of the consultants, will develop  comprehensive PPMS procedures and plans within \n6 months  after  the  loan  takes  effect.  The  PPMS  activities\u2014the  establishment  of  baseline  data \nand  benchmarks,  the  collection  of  information,  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  benefits,  and \nthe evaluation of social impact\u2014will be carried out by the PMU through the PIU with the support \nof the consultants. Data will be collected at the same time as the socioeconomic surveys before \neach  subproject \nthen  be  done  regularly  during \nimplementation  and  for 3  months  after  physical completion. The  results will  be  included  in  the \nproject progress and completion reports. \n\nimplemented.  Data  collection  will \n\nis \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n58. \nReview  missions  will  be  undertaken  twice  a  year  in  the  first  2  years  and  once  a  year \nthereafter. ADB and the Government will undertake a midterm review 3 years after the start of \nproject  implementation.  These  reviews  will  involve  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  project \nimplementation  arrangements  and  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope  of  the  Project,  the \nprogress  of \nresettlement  and  environmental  safeguards,  community \ninvolvement,  health  education  and  hygiene,  feedback  from  the  PPMS,  the  performance  of  the \nconsultants,  the  progress  of  institutional  and  capacity  development,  and  the  possible \nreallocation  of  loan  proceeds.  The  cost  recovery  mechanisms  for  each  subproject  will  also  be \nevaluated and remedial action will be taken as needed. \n\nimplementation, \n\n10. \n\nProject Implementation Plan \n\n59. \nA  project  implementation  plan,  based  on  the  project  schedule,  implementation \narrangements,  procurement  packages,  and  assurances  from  the  Government,  is  presented  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  D.  The  plan  specifies  the  key  project  management,  implementation, \nand  auditing  and  reporting  activities  during  project  implementation,  with  clear  activity  starting \nand due dates, responsible parties, and links between project activities. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \n\n60. \nGeneral  Gains.  The  Project  will  benefit  approximately  340,000  residents  by  2014  and \n367,000  residents  by  2020  in  the  project  areas  by  providing  safe,  reliable  and  inclusive  piped \nwater supplies, improving sanitation, and promoting good hygiene behaviors. About 20% of the \npopulation  of  the  province,  and  nearly  90%  of  the  urban  residents  and  over  30%  of  the  rural \nresidents in the project areas, will benefit. The health benefits from the physical investments in \nsafe water supply will be maximized as people become more knowledgeable and better aware \nof  health  and  hygiene  issues  and  are  able  to  avoid  the  drudgery  associated  with  collecting \nwater, particularly for women. The economy of the region will benefit from increased productivity \nas  health  improves,  less  time  is  needed  to  collect  water,  and  water  supply  services  become \nmore  reliable.  Town  residents  will  also  benefit  from  lower  water  costs  and  from  savings  in \nhealth-care costs. \n \n61. \nPoverty Reduction. All the project interventions will have a positive impact on the poor \ndirectly or indirectly. They will compose about 32% of the 340,000 project beneficiaries. Socially \ninclusive processes built into the Project will ensure that the poor benefit proportionately. They \nwill  benefit  through  reduced  drudgery,  improved  health,  and  reduced  expenditure  on  health \ncare. Households will not be required to pay a connection charge and the costs of the meters \nwill be payable in installments over 3 years. Both policies will help make safe water supply more \naccessible to the poor. The tariffs recommended will be affordable to the poor. Systems will be \ndeveloped for monitoring equity of access to safe and reliable water supply in poor communities \nand at the project administration level, and a national social, poverty, and gender expert will be \nrecruited to oversee this monitoring throughout the Project. Together with the UCSA, the expert \nwill monitor the socioeconomic implications of the Project through all its phases as part of the \nPPMS. A summary poverty reduction and social development strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \nGender  Impact.  While both men and women  will benefit from project investments and \n62. \nactivities,  women  will  benefit  more  from  time  savings,  reduced  drudgery,  and  improved  family \nhealth. Women perform the bulk of household work with the help of children, particularly girls. \nThey are generally responsible for water collection, family hygiene and sanitation, and care for \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nsick family members. The socioeconomic analysis revealed that women and children spend an \naverage  of  2  hours  each  day  collecting  water.  Particular  attention  will  be  given  to  involving \nwomen  in  employment,  management,  decision  making,  and  learning  and  training  activities \nunder  the  Project.  A  national  social,  poverty,  and  gender  expert  will  be  hired  to  ensure  the \nmainstreaming of gender in all Project components, especially the activities related to capacity \nbuilding,  training,  hygiene,  sanitation,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  A  gender  action  plan \nbased on the gender analysis in Supplementary Appendix E can be found in Appendix 11. \n \n63. \nEthnic Minority Groups. The Project will not affect any indigenous peoples defined as \nsuch in ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). The project areas are fairly homogeneous \nin  ethnic  composition.  Eighty  percent  of  the  residents  are  Uzbek.  The  most  numerous  among \nthe  other  ethnic  groups  are  the  Tajik,  who  can  be  found  in  all  the  project  districts  and  are  a \nmajority  population  (55%)  in  Sariasiya  district.  About  100  Multan18 families  live  in  Kizirik  and \nSariasiya  districts.  People  of  other  ethnicities  are  not  many.  The  various  ethnic  groups  do  not \ndiffer in their water supply and sanitation needs. All will benefit directly from piped water supply, \nsanitation  improvements,  and  better  hygiene.  A  report  on  ethnic  minorities  (Supplementary \nAppendix  F)  prepared  for  the  Project  assesses  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  ethnic  groups, \naccording to government regulations and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. \n \n64. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  The Project will not require any land acquisition \nand resettlement (LAR), and there will be no impact on structures since the pipelines will be laid \nalong existing roads and pathways. Only one subproject (Djarkurgan) will have some impact in \nthe  form  of  crop  losses  and  temporary  land  occupation,  and  will  require  a  short  resettlement \nplan that conforms to ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). This subproject will affect \n21 households (156 persons). For each of the seven other subprojects, the absence of impact is \ndocumented in the due-diligence reports prepared by the EA. The short resettlement plan and \nthe due-diligence reports will be reviewed after detailed design, and updated plans and reports \nwill be submitted to ADB for approval before construction. The resettlement will be monitored by \nUCSA,  with  the  help  of  international  and  national  resettlement  experts.  The  social  safeguards \nin \nare  summarized \nSupplementary Appendix G, and the due-diligence reports assessing the need for LAR for the \nremaining subprojects are in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \nEnvironmental  Impact.  The  Project  is  classified  as  category  B  according  to  ADB\u2019s \n65. \nEnvironmental  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  The  provision \nof safe drinking water and proper  sanitation facilities is expected to have a significant positive \nimpact on the environment. Simple, appropriate, low-cost technology with no significant adverse \nenvironmental  consequences  will  be  used.  The  quality  of  the  water  resources  selected  for \ndevelopment  has  been  reviewed  and  fit  ADB  norms.  Any  negative  environmental  impact  will \nmainly be short term, possibly occurring during construction, and can easily be minimized by the \nproposed  mitigation  measures  and  environmentally  sound  engineering  and  construction \npractices.  Initial  environmental  examination  (IEE),  including  separate  assessments  for  each  of \nthe eight subprojects (Supplementary Appendix I), has been carried out for the Project. The IEE \nshowed  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impact.  The  environmental  mitigation  and \nmonitoring  procedures in  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  (EMMP)  will  be \nfollowed to avoid the standard construction impact. A budget of $385,000 has been allocated for \nEMMP  implementation.  The  activities  include  the  cleanup  of  construction  sites,  the  proper \ndisposal of spoils, the grading and revegetation of damaged land, and protection of the public \nfrom  excessive  noise  and  dust  during  construction,  among  other  standard  environmental \nprocedures. A report on the implementation of the EMMP during construction will be submitted \nto ADB every 6 months. The summary IEE is in Appendix 13. \n\nthe  short  resettlement  plan \n\nin  Appendix  12, \n\nfor  Djarkurgan \n\nis \n\n                                                 \n18 This ethnic group, called Lyuli by the Uzbeks, has lived in Central Asia for centuries. \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nthe  management \n\n \nInstitutional Impact. The Project will help the Government define a coherent vision and \n66. \nstrategy  for  WSS  sector  development,  with  which  the  Government  can  coordinate  more \neffectively the development activities in the sector, including those of its development partners. \nThe  recommendations  in  the  PPP  framework  for  tapping  PPP  potential  and  addressing  the \nconstraints will enable the Government to promote greater private sector involvement in WSS. \nThe  institutional  reforms  intended  to  transform  vodokanals  into  business-oriented  service \nproviders\u2014financial  and  tariff  reforms,  customer  registration,  complaint  redress  mechanisms, \nand  performance  benchmarking\u2014together  with \ntools  and  capacity \ndevelopment programs, will provide vodokanals with more internal incentives and capability to \ndeliver better WSS services.  \n \n67. \nEconomic  Analysis.  Economic benefits will be gained from improved access to safer, \nmore  reliable,  and  affordable  water  supply  and  a  cleaner  environment  in  the  project  areas. \nEconomic analysis for the water supply component in each subproject area, according to ADB\u2019s \nguidelines  and  handbook,19 identified  the  following  quantifiable  economic  benefits  of  improved \nwater  supply  services:  non-incremental  water  consumption,  valued  at  the  average  price 20 of \nwater supplied from non-piped sources; and incremental water consumption, valued at the price \nconsumers  are  willing  to  pay.  The  eight  subprojects  have  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n(EIRR)  ranging  from  24.4%  to  39.7%,  for  an  average  EIRR  of  about  32.1%.  The  economic \nanalysis is in Appendix 14, and detailed calculations are in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \n68. \nFinancial  Evaluation.  At present, costs related to the development and reconstruction \nof  water  supply  systems  are  not  considered  in  tariff  determination.  Water  loss,  electricity,  and \nother  material  consumption  norms  are.  However,  with  the  networks  and  equipment  in  their \ncurrent state of deterioration, actual consumption exceeds the norms; hence, tariffs do not cover \nactual O&M expenses. Under the Project, tariffs will be increased to levels that will allow the full \nrecovery  of  O&M  expenses,  taxes,  and  depreciation  by  the  vodokanals.  The  financial  and \naffordability analyses show that the tariffs proposed under the Project, on the basis of the above \nprinciples, are affordable to all, including the poor households. If these tariffs are implemented, \nthe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  for  each  subproject  will  be  5.1%\u20135.8%,  higher  than \nthe  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  4.2%.  All  vodokanals  are  expected  to  have \npositive net cash flows after the project facilities start operating in 2014; no additional subsidy \nwill  be  needed.  The  financial  analysis  is  presented  in  Appendix  15,  and  details  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix K. \n \n69. \nRisks.  Five  possible  risks  have  been  identified  and  addressed  in  the  project  design. \nFirst,  the  risk  of lack  of  commitment  to  a  comprehensive  sector  strategy  and  investment \nprogram  is  addressed  by  the  broadly  consultative  and  participatory  approach  to  the  strategy \nstudy,  to  ensure  government  ownership  of  the  strategy,  road  map,  and  investment  program. \nSecond, to avert delays in project start-up caused by the delayed preparation and approval of \nnationwide feasibility study, feasibility studies for all the subprojects have been conducted and \ncompleted  in  parallel  with  the  project  preparation  and  the  Government  has  endorsed  these \nstudies  before  loan  negotiations.  Third,  to  forestall  delays  in  the  provision  of  local  counterpart \nfunds, assurances have been obtained from the Government that it will allocate and provide the \nfunds on time. Fourth, given the limited capability of vodokanals to meet the incremental O&M of \nthe  expanded  water  supply  systems,  the  capacity  development  component  of  the  Project \nincludes management improvement activities, tariff and financial reforms, and targeted training. \nLastly, to guard against the adverse effects of resettlement on poor and vulnerable households, \n                                                 \n19  ADB.  1997.

The  average  cost  per  household  per \n\nyear, according to the survey, is about SUM76,000. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nthe resettlement plans and other due-diligence arrangements will ensure that all affected people \nwill improve or at least maintain their living standards after the Project. \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n70. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  development  of  the  new  water  supply  and \nwastewater sector strategy, road map, and investment program is carried out in \naccordance  with  the  agreed  process  in  consultation  with  stakeholders  in  the \nsector so that by December 2011 at least the agreed strategy is approved by the \nGovernment.  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  major  changes  in  the \nsector  programs  and  plans  that  may  affect  this  and  future  projects  financed  by \nADB. \n\nThe Government will make adequate annual budget allocations and release in a \ntimely manner the counterpart funds and other resources, as shall be necessary, \nin  addition  to  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  and  grant,  for  the  successful \nimplementation of the Project. \n\nThe  Government  will  cause  SPG  and  subproject  vodokanals  to  take  necessary \nmeasures to improve collection efficiency to achieve a collection rate of 90% for \neach subproject vodokanal by 2013. \n\nThe  Government  will  cause  the  SPG  to  review  semiannually  and  adjust  as \nnecessary  the  level  and  structure  of  water  tariffs  to  ensure  that  (a)  from  2010 \nonward,  the  vodokanals  will  be  able  to  fully  recover  O&M  and  capital \nreplacement costs; and (b) from 2014 onward, the vodokanals will be able to (i) \nrecover fully O&M and capital replacement costs, (ii) service their debts, and (iii) \nmaintain  a  debt  service  coverage  ratio  of  1.2:1.  Results  of  the  reviews  and \nadjustments will be reported to ADB within 3 months of each review.  \n\nThe  Government  will  cause  SPG  to  (a)  take  appropriate  measures,  including \nfinancial  incentives  and  penalties,  to  reduce  the  level  of  water  bill  arrearages, \nand  (b)  protect  their  water  resources  and  facilities  through  the  vigorous \nprosecution of violations such as water meter tampering and water theft. \n\nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate directly, or through its agents, \nany  possible  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \nProject. To support these efforts, the Government shall ensure that  (a) UCSA, in \nthe  bidding  documents  for  the  Project,  and  in  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project,  includes  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of PMU, PIU, and vodokanals, and \nall contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate \nto the Project; (b) periodic inspections of the contractor\u2019s activities related to fund \nwithdrawals and settlements are carried out; and (c) the project auditors have the \nright to conduct random or spot audits of contract implementation activities under \nthe Project. The cost of this auditing will be borne by the Project. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\n(vii)  UCSA  will  maintain  and  update  its  website  to  present  information  on  externally \nfunded  projects,  including  the  Project.  With  regard  to  the  Project,  the  website \nshall provide information on, among other things, water tariff review procedures, \nresults  of  annual  reviews  and  adjustments,  collection  efficiency,  financial \nstatements  of  the  project  procurement  activities  and  details  on  the  adopted \nbidding  procedures,  amounts  of  the  contracts  awarded,  the  list  of  goods  and \nservices purchased, and their intended and actual utilization. \n\n \n(viii)  For cranes, excavators, and major repair equipment to be shared by the district \nvodokanals, UCSA will cause the Surkhandarya provincial vodokanal to prepare, \nin  consultation  with  the  subproject  vodokanals,  a  maintenance  plan  for  the \nproposed  station  to  place  the  equipment  and  the  standards,  procedures,  and \nother arrangements for maintaining and using the equipment. UCSA will send the \ndraft plan to ADB by 30 September 2009 for review. \n\nincluding  national  and \n\nUCSA  shall  ensure  that  (a)  the  project  facilities  are  constructed,  operated, \nmaintained,  and  monitored  in  conformity  with  (1)  all  applicable  laws  and \nfor \nregulations, \nenvironmental  protection,  health,  labor,  and  occupational  safety;  and  (2)  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  and  the  IEE,  summary  IEE,  and  EMMP;  (b)  the \nimplementation  of  the  EMMP  and  any  violation  of  environmental  standards  are \nreported  to  ADB  semiannually  in  accordance  with  the  specifications  set  forth  in \nthe  IEE;  and  (c) the  EMMP  is  incorporated  in  the  bidding  documents  for  the \nProject. \n\nregulations  and  standards \n\nlocal \n\nUnless otherwise agreed on with ADB, the  Government will ensure that no civil \nworks  contract  for  the  Termez  subproject  will be  awarded  until  the  Government \napproves  the  implementation  of  the  Termez  wastewater  management  project \nwith arrangements satisfactory to ADB. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  carried  out  in  accordance  with \napplicable national laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \n(1995), and the resettlement plan prepared for the Project and approved by ADB. \nThe  Government  will  review  and  update  the  project  resettlement  plan  and \ndue-diligence  reports  after  the  detailed  design.  No  civil  works  contract  for \nDjarkurgan subproject will be awarded until the updated resettlement plan based \non  the  detailed  design  of  the  subproject  has  been  approved  by  ADB,  and  the \ncontractors may not be given a notice to proceed under the subproject until the \nupdated resettlement plan has been implemented in accordance with its terms. \n\n \n(xii)  UCSA  will  ensure  that  the  implementation  arrangements  and  implementation \nplan  for  the  hygiene  promotion  activities  to  be  carried  out  in  all  schools  in  the \nproject areas are prepared by the end of December 2009; and that the hygiene \nbaseline survey is completed by June 2010 and follow-up surveys are carried out \nin 2012 and 2014.  \n\n \n(xiii)  The Government will ensure that candidates for study tours are selected through \na transparent and competitive process following the criteria agreed on with ADB. \nThe Government will also ensure that those who complete the study tours will be \nrequired to share the knowledge gained in a reporting-back workshop with other \nstakeholders. \n\n \n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n \n(xi) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n(xv) \n\n(xiv)  UCSA  will  ensure  that  the  implementation  of  the  Project,  the  operation  of  the \nproject  facilities,  and  the  benefits  derived  from  the  Project  are  monitored  and \nevaluated annually by the PMU. Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, UCSA will \nestablish the PPMS in a manner satisfactory to ADB. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  UCSA  adopts  the  project  gender  action \nplan,  that  the  plan  is  implemented  in  a  timely  manner  over  the  entire  project \nperiod,  and  that  adequate  resources  are  allocated  for  this  purpose.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\n  \nThe Government of Uzbekistan, in coordination with international organizations, supported an in-depth poverty analysis in late \nJuly  2007.  The  Welfare  Improvement  Strategy  and  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  (WIS/PRSP  2008\u20132010)a  sets  out  a \nstrategy for improving living standards, especially for low-income and socially isolated groups. The strategy emphasizes the \nneed to improve access to municipal services that ensure decent living conditions (potable water supply has first priority) to \nimprove living standards. In this regard, the large gap between large urban centers and rural areas in access to infrastructure \nwidens  the  gap  in  living  standards.  Since  1990  the  Government  has  implemented  a  targeted  program  for  providing  the \npopulation  with  clean  potable  water,  which  has  increase  the  proportion  of  households  with  access  to  potable  water  supply, \nfrom 50% in 1990 to 82.6% by the start of 2007. According to the WIS, 1,312 more populated localities should be provided \nwith centralized water supply by 2008. \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (2006\u20132010)b  is  well  aligned  with  the  Government\u2019s  WIS/PRSP  and  is  aimed  at \npromoting  pro-poor  growth  through  four  key  strategic  priorities.  Of  these  four,  the  Project  will  directly  contribute  to  the \nattainment of these two priorities: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nAccelerating  environmentally  sustainable  rural  development.  Through  the  delivery  of  improved  and  more \naccessible water supply to more households in the urban as well as rural areas of Surkhandarya Province, the \nProject  will enable families to participate more fully in economic activities, and reduce the costs of health care \ndue to water-related illnesses. Improvements in sanitation and hygiene promotion in schools will help maximize \nthe health benefits from safe water supply.  \nBuilding  the  human  capital  of  the  poor. The Project will contribute to poverty reduction efforts by improving \nwater  supply  to  the  poor  and  female-headed  households,  and  by  delivering  school  sanitation  and  hygiene \nprograms. \n\nAssistance  from  international  donors  to  the  municipal  services  sector  is  critical.  A  number  of  projects  that  will  supply  safe \ndrinking water and wastewater treatment facilities are being prepared or implemented. Technical assistance is also required \nfor  municipal  services  reform.  The  Government  is  planning  reforms  in  municipal  services,  and  the  Project  will  contribute  to \n(i) a  gradual  transition  of  municipal  services  enterprises  from  dependency  on  the  government  to  financial  independence; \n(ii) improved  rate-setting  policies  and  transparency;  (iii) targeted  support  for  low-income  population  groups;  (iv)  improved \nmaintenance,  repairs,  and  funding  for  the  municipal  services  system;  (v)  sustainable  funding  for  the  construction  of \ninterregional piped water supply systems; (vi) regional programs that will promote economic reforms; and (vii) a greater role \nfor local self-governing bodies (makhallas) in regulating municipal services and housing relationships. \n \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1. Key Issues  \n According  to  a  World  Bank  study  (2003)  based  on  a  household  budget  survey  in  the  southern  economic  region,  which \nincludes Surkhandarya Province, 27.6% of the population is living below the poverty line.c The PPTA socioeconomic survey \nconducted in 2007\u20132008 showed a household poverty rate of 33% in the seven subproject areas of Surkhandarya and 31% in \nTermez City - equivalent to a total of 109,600 people in the eight subproject areas. A poverty line in monetary terms is $37 per \nmonth in Termez and $19.4 per month in the seven other subproject areas. The average monthly income of families is $207 in \nTermez  and  $173  in  the  other  seven  areas.  The  average  per  capita  income  of  the  poor  is  one\u2013third  the  income  of  the \nnonpoor. Only 46.4% of the families surveyed were urban residents. \nNumerous  studies,  including  the  WIS,  indicate  that  poverty  in  small  towns  in  Uzbekistan  is  even  higher  than  the  poverty  in \nrural areas, as access to land is limited for families in small towns, and there are much fewer employment opportunities in the \nstate-funded  sector  and  in  private  business  and  industry  than  in  big  cities.  Income  from  hired  employment  in  the \nnonagricultural sector is most significant for poor families, even in the small semi-urban settlements (27% of total income in \nSurkhandarya  Province).  The  second-most-important  income  sources  are  social  transfers  and  the  marketing  of  agricultural \nproducts  grown  by  the  families  themselves.  Pensions  and  social  transfers  (including  the  social  benefits  of  low-income \nhouseholds)  contribute  23.9%  of  the  income  of  poor  families  in  Surkhandarya.  Poor  families  have  a  higher  share  of \nunemployment (62%). More than 70% of the unemployed  are  women. Most of the poor are hired  workers, employed in the \nagricultural or state-funded sectors, or self-employed people who cultivate their own small household plots (up to 0.1 hectare). \nPoor  families  spend  about  48%\u201353%  of  total  family  income  for  foodstuffs.  The  level  of  meat  product  consumption  is  up  to \nrequired standards only in 12% of families, while most of the diet is mostly carbohydrates (flour, potato) and fats (vegetable \noil).  The  education  level  of  poor  families  is  close  to  the  national  average  of  91%  having  gone  through  primary  school. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n40 \n \nHowever,  the  share  of  heads  of  households  with  secondary  education  in  poor  families  is  much  lower  (only  23%)  than  in \nnonpoor  families.  Low  income  and  limited  employment  opportunities  are  the  major  causes  of  poverty.  Employment \nopportunities are limited in all sectors of the economy, including the agricultural and state- funded sectors, because of the lack \nof jobs, low wages and irregular and unsure payments, and the low professional skills of the poor. As a result, labor migration \nis growing\u2014about 5% of families receive money from family members in other provinces or abroad. The agricultural sector is \nliving through the transformation of shirkat farms into private farms, a process that is triggering a significant labor surplus. \nLess than 3% of the people have become private farmers, and they try as much as possible to employ only family members \nas private farm workers. Self-employment opportunities are limited by the shortage of resources, the underdeveloped state of \nmarket  institutions,  legislative  limitations,  and  lack  of  information  about  ways  and  opportunities  of  increasing  income  in  the \nnew  market  economy.  Families  with  few  or  no  opportunities  to  find  employment  in  the  nonagricultural  sector  are  obliged  to \nbecome entrepreneurs, running small enterprises or being self-employed (in the largely unregistered small-scale trade).  \nBoth  poor  and  nonpoor  families  have  limited  access  to  public  utilities\u2014natural  gas,  electricity,  and  potable  water.  This \nproblem  is  particularly  acute  in  areas  outside  Termez,  where  32.5%  of  families  have  no  access  to  natural  gas  supply,  and \n71% of families encounter frequent electricity supply interruptions. Less than 2.5% of poor families have bathrooms with piped \nwater. Apart from some households in Termez, no households in the project areas have access to central sewerage. Water \nconsumption in poor families is lower by 21% than consumption in nonpoor families (9.9 liters per capita per day for the poor \nand  12.5  liters  for  the  nonpoor).  The  quality  of  water  poor  families  consume  is  also  lower;  irrigation  canals  are  the  main \nsources  of  water  for  19%  of  the  poor  families  in  rural  Surkhandarya.  The  problems  associated  with  intermittent  and  low-\npressure water supply are 20% more frequent among poor families than among the nonpoor. Low-income households cannot \nafford to buy potable water, and over 20% use unsafe water from irrigation systems and shallow wells. \n2. Design Features  \nThe  Project  involves  (i)  the  preparation  of  a  sector  strategy,  a  road  map,  and  an  investment  plan  up  to  2020;  (ii) the \nrehabilitation and construction of water supply systems in seven districts and Termez city; (iii) the building of capacity in the \nvodokanals to (a) use benchmarking to improve technical and financial efficiency, and (b) develop a commercial approach to \ncustomer services; and (iv) the adoption of the following pro-poor strategies to address the specific needs of the poor (which \nrepresent 32% of the projected 2014 population): \n(i)  Connection fees will be covered by the Project, thus removing a significant barrier to access by the poor. \n(ii)  Meters will be mandatory but provided by the Project and can be repaid over 3 years.  \n(iii)  A social, poverty, and gender expert will ensure that poor and vulnerable groups are able to gain access to project \n\nbenefits. \n\nStrategies (ii) and (iii) are available to both poor and nonpoor households but will be particularly effective in improving access \nfor the poor. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.        Findings of Social Analysis \nThe population of the settlements in the subproject areas, which comprise eight administrative districts, is more than 340,000 \n(127,000 in Termez and 213,000 in the other seven area), or about 69,700 families. The average family size is 5 persons in \nTermez and 5.9 persons in the other areas. Family size is bigger for poor households  (6 persons in Termez and 6.6 in the \nseven  other  areas)  compared  with  nonpoor  households  (4.6  in  Termez  and  5.6  in  the  other  areas).  Ninety-eight  percent  of \nfamilies live in their own houses, with land for a family house guaranteed by the state.  \nPotable  water  supply  in  the  project  areas  is  worsening.  There  are  no  metering  devices,  water  supply  is  unreliable,  and  the \npopulation is unwilling to pay the current rates. According to the PPTA socioeconomic survey data, most of the households \nsurveyed, irrespective of their living standards, are face with a shortage of potable water. The average consumption of water \nfor drinking and household needs per day is less than 13 liters per capita (about 80 liters per family per day, versus the official \nstandard of 110 liters per capita per day). Ninety percent of Termez households and only 42% of the households in the seven \nother  districts  have  piped  water  in  their  houses.  However,  over  13%  of  connections  have  never  worked,  and  the  rest  are \ninoperable more than half of the time. No less than 35% of families in the project areas take water from several sources at a \ntime  and  use  it  for  drinking  and  household  needs.  As  a  rule,  even  families  that  have  piped  water  in  their  houses  often  use \nwater  from  a  water  post  in  the  street  for  drinking  and  household  needs  (some  55%  of  families)  or  water  brought  by  water \nvendors, or even water from canals.  \nDiarrhea  incidence  is  five  to  seven  times  higher  among  families  that  take  water  from  open  water  reservoirs  than  among \nfamilies  with piped  water. On average, the annual expenses for diarrhea treatment amount to about 8.7% of monthly family \nincome in the seven project districts and 6.9% in Termez. An average of 30% of children under 14 (male and female, urban \nand  rural)  bathe  less  than  once  a  week.  About  46%  of  the  household  time  of  Termez  residents  is  spent  collecting  water, \ncompared with 75.3% for households in the seven other districts. Average distance to the main source of water is less than \n100  meters  in  Termez  and  more  than  600  meters  in  the  remaining  subproject  areas.  An  average  family  spends  about  3.75 \nperson-days per month collecting water, versus 6.1 person-days per month in the other subproject districts. About 90%\u201395% \nof  families  store  water  for  their  drinking  and  household  needs.  Expenses  on  the  construction  of  water  storage  reservoirs \n(khauzes) are especially high, amounting to $150 each. \nBecause  of  the  lack  of  water,  about  half  of  households  do  not  have  special  rooms  for  bathing.  Although  43%  of  families \nsurveyed  said  that  their  houses  have  bathrooms,  almost  all  have  to  bring  water  in  buckets  to  those  rooms.  Only  24%  of \n\n \n\n\f \nhouseholds surveyed in Termez and 5% elsewhere have bathrooms connected to water pipelines. The residents of Termez \nand other small towns who have sewerage connections in their apartments cannot use them for lack of water. \nSocial  infrastructure  facilities  also  suffer  from  water  shortage.  In  the  project  areas,  more  than  600  institutions  and \norganizations,  funded  from  the  state  budget,  are  now  functioning\u2014most  with  limited  water  and  sanitation.  Kindergartens, \nschools,  colleges,  inpatient  medical  institutions,  and  hospitals  all  urgently  need  adequate  water  supply  and  improved \nsanitation facilities.  \n\nAppendix 10 \n \n\n41 \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\nParticipation occurred during the implementation of the PPTA through consultations with key stakeholders at both central and \nlocal government levels, and with area-based communities. The surveys conducted for the PPTA socioeconomic survey and \nthe  resettlement  plans,  which  covered  2,400  families,  ensured  that  the  issues  brought  up  by  the  residents  and  their \npreferences  were  understood  and  that  the  target  population  was  also  informed  about  the  project  goals  and  objectives  in \ngeneral.  Data  collection  and  analysis  focused  on  vulnerable  population  groups,  especially  the  poor,  women,  and  ethnic \nminorities. In addition to surveys  of families, interviews  were conducted  with chairpersons of all rural assemblies of citizens \nand urban makhallas within the project areas, which are essential to the wide dissemination of information in the country.  \nPress releases to TV, radio, and print media, as well as town meetings and presentations at some schools, were undertaken \nto supplement the survey and information exercise. \n1. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n2. Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nA  stakeholder  analysis  was  developed  within  the  social  analysis  component  and  extensive  consultations  were  carried  out \nduring project preparation. In addition, a capacity development TA is proposed, to help build the capacity of the water supply \ncompanies  and  the  makhalla  committees  to  represent  their  customers,  develop  public  awareness,  and  address  customer \ncomplaints. Therefore, a separate C&P plan is not envisaged. \n \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues.  \nThe role of women in economy is extremely important, as women make up 47% of the labor resources of Uzbekistan. In the \nproject  areas  47.5%  of  Surkhandarya  women  are  at  least  temporarily  employed.  Despite  the  fact  that  women  make  a \nsignificant contribution to household budgets (35% of household income), they are employed mostly in the state-funded sector \nor do low-skilled manual labor, receiving lower wages than men. In the agricultural sector women can obtain only seasonal, \nlow-skilled manual jobs. Women\u2019s wages are about 80% of men\u2019s wages. \nMoreover, women take on the additional burden of housework, which is quite heavy. Women collect water, cultivate garden \nplots,  tend  the  livestock  and  poultry,  do  the  laundry,  clean  the  house,  cook,  and  take  care  of  the  children  and  older  family \nmembers. Nine percent of those surveyed in Termez and 58% in the remaining districts do not have a source of water in their \nhouse  yards  and  have  to  collect  water  elsewhere  every  day.  Water  delivery  is  largely  (in  80%  of  cases)  a  responsibility  of \nwomen and children, who have to bring home water twice or thrice a day, carrying 20\u201325 liters at a time. As potable water is \ngenerally of low quality, there is high incidence of water-related diseases among children (diarrhea was reported among 8% of \nall families in Termez and 11% in the seven other districts in the last 12 months). \nProviding households with adequate and good-quality potable water will have a positive impact on women. It will lighten their \nwork and allow them to spend more time in gainful employment. It also will have a positive impact on the health of all family \nmembers, especially children, further lessening the time pressures on women, who must also care for the old and the infirm \namong their household members. \n2.  Key  Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n \n\n  Gender plan      \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\nTo  enhance  the  positive  impact  of  the  Project  on  women  and  minimize  the  project-related  risks  to  women  and  children,  a \ngender action plan was developed within the social analysis component. It has the following key components: \n\n\u2022  The  participation  of  a  national social,  poverty,  and  gender  expert  to  ensure  that  gender  issues  receive  priority  during \nimplementation. \n\u2022  The participation of women in project planning and as a key target group for information campaigns. \n\u2022  Gender  sensitivity  training  for  key  stakeholders  (including  vodokanals)  to  make  them  more  fully  aware  of  the  important \nroles women play in water supply, sanitation, and hygiene behavior, involve women to a greater degree in management and \nplanning, and respond in a more gender-sensitive way to concerns raised by female clients. \n\u2022  The inclusion of women in management and monitoring, as equal partners in resolving issues. \n\u2022  The  revision  of  human  resource  policies,  procedures,  and  guidelines  for  the  water  supply  companies  (vodokanals)  to \nensure greater gender-responsiveness. The URM gender adviser will participate in the process and assist in the updating of \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n42 \n \nthe gender action plan. \n\u2022  A  focus  on  primary  schools  for  the  sanitation  and  hygiene  program  (a  significant  number  of  girls  do  not  progress  to \nsecondary school), to ensure that girls are aware of good practices in water handling, hygiene, and sanitation and carry these \npractices into adulthood.  \n\u2022  The training of women in basic technical skills to ensure that they do not have to depend on males to address basic WSS \nproblems. \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nIssue \n\n \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\n \nIndigenous Peoples \n \n\n \nNo Impact \n \n\n \nLabor \n\n  Employment  \nopportunities \n Labor retrenchment \n Core labor standards \n\n \nAffordability \n\n \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\n \nLimited Impact \nDuring the construction of \nnew water pipelines, \nsome households in one \nsubproject will suffer \npermanent impact in \nterms of crop losses and \ntemporary land \nacquisition.

The  Uzbekistan  Communal  Services \nAgency  (UCSA)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA).  The  Project  will  be  administered  by  a  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) established at the central level under UCSA and implemented at the province \nlevel by a project implementation unit (PIU).  \n\n2. \nThe Project will primarily include the replacement of water supply systems in eight subprojects in \nSurkhandarya  Province.  Of  these  subprojects,  only  three  entail  new  construction  and  only  one \n(Djarkurgan) entails land acquisition and resettlement (LAR). In Djarkurgan, new construction will cause \nonly  minimal  impact  in  the  form  of  crop  losses.  There  will  be  no  land  acquisition  or  impact  on  trees, \nstructures, and residences. The Project will not entail impact on subjects classifiable as indigenous people \nunder the relevant ADB policy.  \n\n3. \nIn  accordance  with  Uzbek  law  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995)  and \nOperations Manual section on involuntary resettlement,1 UCSA has prepared a short resettlement plan to \ndocument the LAR impact of the Djarkurgan subproject and plan the compensation and rehabilitation of \nthe affected families. In addition, seven due-diligence reports have been prepared to document the lack of \nimpact in the remaining seven subprojects. \n\nB. \n\nResettlement Plans \n\nThe  short  resettlement  plan  for  the  Djarkurgan  subproject  includes  a  detailed  impact  assessment \n4. \nand a census of affected persons showing that the subproject will cause only temporary land-use impact \nand crop losses to 4.75 hectares of arable land owned by 21 affected families with 156 members. The \nimpact will require providing the affected families with compensation for crops and appropriate land rental \nfees.  The  total  compensation  program  cost  under  the  short  resettlement  plan  is  $12,450,  with \ncontingencies.  The  short  resettlement  plan  provides  general  LAR-related  project  preparation  and \nimplementation  conditions;  a  policy  framework  detailing  all  compensation  and  rehabilitation  provisions; \nand  several  sections  related  to  public  consultation  and  disclosure,  the  organization  of  LAR  tasks, \ncomplaints and grievances, and the LAR implementation schedule, budgets, and monitoring. A summary \nof these aspects of the resettlement plan is provided in the next paragraphs. \n\n5. \nProject Implementation Conditions Related to the Resettlement Plan. This resettlement plan \nis  based  on  surveys  carried  out  in  May\u2013September  2007  and  June  2008  under  the  project  preparatory \ntechnical  assistance.  Although  the  data  in  this  resettlement  plan  are  adequate,  final  design  alignments \nmay  require  some  impact  review  and  confirmation  work.  To  ensure  that  impact  data  are  updated  as \nneeded  and  guarantee  that  the  affected  families  are  fully  compensated  and  rehabilitated  before  any \nimpact  occurs,  two  project  implementation  conditions  related  to  the  resettlement  plan  have  been \nestablished: (i) civil works contracts will be approved only after the resettlement plan has been reviewed \nand  confirmed  or  amended  on  the  basis  of  the  final  detailed  design,  and  (ii)  ADB  will  approve  the \nmobilization  of  contractors  only  after  the  full  implementation  of  the  compensation  and  rehabilitation \nprogram detailed in the resettlement plan. \n\n6. \nCompensation  Principles  and  Entitlements  Provisions.  The  resettlement  plan  lists  the \nfollowing  compensation  principles:  (i)  LAR  will  be  avoided  or  at  least  minimized;  (ii)  compensation  will \nguarantee at least the maintenance of the affected family\u2019s living standards before the Project; (iii) affected \nfamilies will be fully informed and consulted on compensation options; (iv) affected families\u2019 sociocultural \ninstitutions will be supported and used; (v) LAR provisions will apply equally to women and men; (vi) lack \nof  formal  title  will  not  be  a  bar  to  compensation  or  rehabilitation;  (vii) particular  attention  will  be  paid  to \nvulnerable groups and households headed by women; (viii) LAR will be conceived and executed as an \nintegral part of the project and LAR budgets will be included in project costs; and (ix) compensation \nwill be fully provided before ground leveling and demolition. The resettlement plan also contains the \nfollowing eligibility and entitlement provisions covering all impact caused by the Project:  \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006. Operations Manual. Section F2: Involuntary Resettlement. Manila (25 September). \n \n\n\f \n \n\nAppendix 12 \n \n\n47\n\nTable A12: Eligibility and Entitlement Provisions \n\nType of Loss \nAgricultural Land \n(temporary)   \n\nEntitled Persons \nAffected families with or \nwithout land-use right or \nleases. \n\nAnnual Crops and Tree \nHarvests \n\nPlanters \n\nVulnerable People \n\nAll rural affected families \nwith vulnerable people \n\nCompensation and Rehabilitation Measures \nRental of land used (based on a 10 meter long and 3 \nmeter wide strip for the poor and vulnerable) for a  2-\nmonth construction period \nTree losses to be avoided by using hand digging \nRestoration of land to its previous condition \nCompensation of double the highest annual crop at \nmarket rate to account for potential impact on 2 of the \n3 usual annual crops \nAn additional allowance based on the value of the \nhighest-value crops destroyed \n\n7. \nInstitutional  Responsibilities.  The  EA  has  overall  LAR  preparation,  implementation,  and \nfinancing  responsibility  and  will  exercise  its  functions  via  a  PMU  with  overall  project  responsibilities. \nSubproject  tasks  will  be  carried  out  by  a  PIU  set  up  in  Surkhandarya  Province.  LAR  regulatory \nfunctions are the standard responsibility of district administrations, and all surveys and compensation \nprovisions will be certified by them. At the PMU, LAR issues will be handled by a resettlement expert, \nwho will work in close association with a resettlement officer from the  province. As local capacity in \ninternational  LAR  standards  is  still  based  on  relatively  short  experience  the  local  resettlement \npersonnel  will  be  assisted  by  the  resettlement  team,  comprising  an  international  resettlement \nspecialist and a national social and resettlement expert. \n\n8. \nDisclosure  and  Public  Consultation.  LAR  preparation  entails  thorough  consultation.  All \naffected  families  were  informed  and  consulted  on  the  resettlement  plan  provisions,  both  individually \nand in community meetings. As an appraisal condition, the resettlement plans will be posted on the ADB \nwebsite, and disclosed in the local language to the affected families and communities. An information \nbooklet  will  be  sent  to  all  affected  families  to  ensure  that  they  understand  their  rights  and  the \ncompensation due them.  \n\nGrievance  Procedures.  A  grievance  procedure  has  been  established  as \n\n9. \nfollows: \n(i) grievances will be handled first at the district level by the local cadastre office; (ii) if no solution is \nreached,  the  affected  families  will  then  lodge  a  complaint  with  the  provincial  administration;  and, \nfinally,  (iii)  if  no  settlement  is  reached  the  affected  families  will  still  be  able  to  seek  redress  in  the \nappropriate court.  \n\n10.  Monitoring and Evaluation. The  PMU  will  monitor  LAR  implementation  internally  and  report \nto the EA, which will report quarterly to ADB. Since the resettlement plan significantly affects less than \n200 people, no external monitoring will be carried out. \n\nFinances  and  Schedules.  The  resettlement  plans  will  detail \n\n11. \nimplementation schedules, linking LAR tasks with the start of civil works. \n\nthe  LAR  budget  and \n\nC. \n\nDue Diligence \n\nIn the remaining seven subprojects, no resettlement or structure or land impact will take place \n12. \nas construction will only be carried out to replace existing pipes within public rights-of-way. Except for \nminor  disturbances,  these  activities  will  not  have  any  adverse  impact  on  people  or  things. \nDue-diligence reports were prepared for all the seven subprojects to document the absence of LAR \nimpact.  These  reports  include  (i)  a  brief  description  of  the  subproject  and  the  work  involved,  (ii)  a \ndiagram  of  the  alignments,  (iii)  an  outline  of  the  LAR  surveys  and  fieldwork,  (iv) a  table  of \nconsultations and dates, and (v) conclusion. \n\nUpon project implementation, the PMU resettlement expert will (i) review the resettlement plan \n13. \nfor  Djarkurgan,  (ii)  review  due  diligence  on  the  remaining  seven  subprojects,  (iii)  prepare  a \nconfirmation letter or a report documenting any modifications in each subproject and submit it to ADB, \nand  (iv)  receive  a  no-objection  confirmation  from  ADB  for  each  subproject  before  any  construction \ntakes place in that subproject. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n48 \n \n\nA. \n\nPhysical Components \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\n1. \nThe main physical components of the Project will involve the following interventions: (i) the \nrehabilitation of 53.3 kilometers (km) of existing trunk mains and the construction of 24.4 km of new \ntrunk  mains,  (ii)  the  rehabilitation  of  147.95  km  of  existing  distribution  networks  and  the \nconstruction of 107.9 km of new distribution networks at existing water distribution centers (WDCs), \n(iii) the  rehabilitation  of  19  existing  water  reservoirs  and  the  construction  of  eight  new  water \nreservoirs, (iv) the rehabilitation of 47 existing boreholes and the construction of 11 new boreholes, \n(v) the  rehabilitation  of  44  existing  pumping  stations  and  the  construction  of  four  new  pumping \nstations,  (vi)  the  development  of  existing  sanitation  zones  around  water  distribution  centers,  and \n(vii) the rehabilitation and construction of water treatment facilities (chlorination rooms at WDCs). In \naddition, the Project will rehabilitate toilet facilities in schools. The Project targets a population of \n340,000 in 2014 and 367,000 in 2020. \n\nB. \n\nExisting Environment  \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Environment \n\n \n2. \nSurkhandarya  River,  the  main  natural  drainage  system  in  Surkhandarya  Province, \noriginates in western Tajikistan, enters the Surkhandarya Province at the northeastern boundary of \nthe  province,  and  discharges  into  the  Amu  Darya  River.  The  province  has  extensive  artificial \nirrigation  and  drainage  systems  and  some  associated  reservoirs.  Part  of  the  groundwater  in  the \nprovince  is  salinized,  with  total  dissolved  solids  content  often  exceeding  5  grams  per  liter. \nHowever,  there  are  aquifers  with  variable  amounts  of  freshwater  reserves  in  some  of  the  project \ndistricts in Surkhandarya Province. The quality of the groundwater is generally good. \n\n2. \n\nSocioeconomic Environment \n\n3. \nThe  average  household  size  in  the  project  districts  is  5.9  persons,  and  5  persons  in \nTermez.  A  typical  poor  household  consists  of  6.6  persons.  The  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  socioeconomic  survey  in  2007\u20132008  showed  a  household  poverty  rate  of  33%  in  the \nseven subproject districts and 31% in Termez City. The poverty line in monetary terms is $37 per \nmonth  in  Termez  City  and  $19.4  in  the  subproject  districts.  Only  42%  of  households  in  the \nsubproject  districts  have  access  to  piped  water  in  their  homes,  while  in  Termez  City  access  is \nabout 90%. However, 13% of these connections have never worked, and the rest operate for an \naverage of 8.4 hours per day in the subproject districts and 11.2 hours per day in Termez City. In \nthe  summer  water  supply  interruptions  are  more  frequent.  Further,  45%  of  households  in  the \nsubproject  districts  use  water  from  open  water  reservoirs  (river,  canal)  at  least  sometimes  for \nhousehold  needs,  including  more  than  20%  of  households  that  use  river  water  for  drinking. \nConsequently,  there  is  a  high  incidence  of  water-related  diseases.  On  average  the,  annual \nexpenses  for  diarrhea  treatment  amount  to  about  10%  of  monthly  family  income  per  sick  child. \nAbout half of households surveyed in the seven subproject districts and nearly 30% of households \nin Termez City do not have a special room designated for bathing, and only 5% of households in \nthe seven project districts have bathrooms connected to water pipelines. About 50% of the adults \nand 30% of the children bathe only once a week. In the rural settlements of the seven subproject \nareas,  no  households  have  access  to  a  central  sewerage  system.  Human  waste  is  dumped  into \nnon-ventilated pit latrines in domestic gardens. Most of the toilets in the surveyed households are \nnot  equipped  with  leakproof  concrete  lining.  In  general,  only  45%  of  the  130  schools  in  the \nsubproject  areas  are  connected  to  piped  water  supply,  and  only  two  schools  have  a  centralized \n\n \n\n\f \n \nsewerage  system.  Other  social  infrastructure  in  the  project  areas  (kindergartens,  colleges, \nhospitals, clinics) is only slightly better-off.  \n\nAppendix 13 \n \n\n49\n\n3. \n\nBiological Environment \n\nProtected nature areas currently cover 4.6% of the country\u2019s territory. However, these areas \n4. \nare  found  in  remote  areas,  far  from  the  project  areas.  There  are  two  state  reserves  (protected \nnature  areas  or  wildlife  habitats)  of  national  or  local  importance  near  or  within  the  perimeter  of \nSurkhandarya  Province,  but  only  one  20  km  from  Termez  City  is  near  a  subproject  area.  In  all \nsubproject areas, irrigated agriculture is intensely developed and does not offer ideal refuge to wild \nanimals. Irrigated croplands are dominated by cotton plantations and winter wheat. Other crops are \npotato,  onion,  tomato,  cucumber,  apple,  grape,  melon,  and  watermelon.  The  wild  flora  of \nnonirrigated lands differs with the relief. In lowlands grow couch grass, motley grass, and pistachio \ntrees; in the mid-mountains, hawthorn and dog rose are typical. The wild fauna is represented by \ncommon  species,  including  rodents,  reptiles,  insects,  and  arachnoids.  Typically  farm  livestock  is \nfound  in  pasture  land  (Gissar  sheep,  goats).  The  proposed  rehabilitation  and  construction \nsubproject  interventions  are  not  expected  to  have  a  significant  long-term  impact  on  the  present \nvegetation and animal world. \n\n4. \n\nCultural Environment and Historical Heritage \n\n5. \nThe  eight  subproject  areas  are located  between  Dushanbe  and  Termez.  Cultural  heritage \nhas marked these historical cities, but few monuments have been reported and these will not be \naffected by the project interventions.  \n\nC. \n\nPotential Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Impact Caused by the Project Location \n\n6. \nThe  land  in  the  project  areas  is  generally  agricultural  or  non-valuable.  The  subproject \ninterventions  will  nearly  all  be  undertaken  in  or  around  existing  water  supply  facilities  (water \ndistribution  centers,  sanitation  zones)  and  along  existing  water  supply  lines  (main  trunks, \ndistribution system); long-term environmental impact caused by the project location is therefore not \nexpected. The source of water will frequently be tested before the final decision for development. \nThe  results of  the  quality  tests  must  prove  that the  water  is  suitable  as  raw  water  to  be  used for \ndrinking.  The  long-term  design  yield  of  each  production  well  added  to  the  yield  of  other  wells \nalready in use must not exceed the aquifer\u2019s sustainable annual recharge.  \n\n2. \n\nImpact Related to Design \n\n7. \nThe  Project  mostly  entails  the  rehabilitation  or  construction  of  groundwater  wells  and \ntransmission channels, and facilities in and around the potable water supply systems. The design \nis  based  on  the  extraction  of  potable  groundwater  through  pumps  and  its  transmission  through \ndistribution  networks  and  treatment  to  water  users.  In  four  of  the  eight  subprojects  the  feasibility \nteam considered alternative designs, and in each case selected the most cost-effective. From an \nenvironmental  point  of  view,  there  were  no  differences  between  the  options  considered.  No \nenvironmental  implications  are  expected  from  the  improvements  that  will  be  made  in  the  water \nintake  structures.  Transmission  mains  will  be  laid  as  much  as  possible  along  existing  roads. \nTransmission mains, distribution networks, and in-yard connections will be of nonmetallic pressure \npipes,  recommended  for  domestic  and  drinking  water  supply,  and  complying  with  international \nstandards. Typically these will include high-density polyethylene pipes, and polyvinyl chloride and \ncarbon fiber or cement (Hobbes) pipes. No asbestos cement pipes will be used. Steel pipes will be \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n50 \n \nused  only  in  river  and  canal  crossings.  The  provision  of  sealed  pit  latrines  in  schools  and  health \nunits  in  the  villages  covered  by  the  subprojects  will  prevent  leakage  into  groundwater.  The \nconstruction  of  all  sanitation  facilities  at  schools  will  conform  to  the  relevant  Uzbekistan \nconstruction code. Adverse impact due to the project design is therefore not expected. \n\n3. \n\nImpact during Construction and Mitigation Measures \n\n8. \nOccupation of Agricultural Land. All possible measures will be taken at the design stage \nto  avoid  encroaching  into  irrigated  and  other  agricultural  lands,  private  buildings,  and  houses. \nDetails  on  required  compensation  are  provided  in  the  separate  resettlement  plans.  Transmission \nmains  will  be  designed  along  existing  roads.  Government  procedures  for  compensation  will  be \ncomplied with. \n \n9. \nIncreased  Traffic. Traffic of heavy trucks transporting construction materials will increase \ntemporarily during the implementation of the subprojects. Measures will be taken to enforce strictly \nsafety  rules  at  main  road  crossings,  along  main  roads,  along  the  makhalla  streets,  and  near \nrehabilitation  sites.  Temporary  or  permanent  traffic  lights  in  most  sensitive  road  crossings  will  be \ninstalled by the contractors, under the supervision of the project implementation unit. Traffic police \ncontrol  will  be  intensified  in  makhallas  during  the  rehabilitation  or  construction  period,  and \nadequate warning will be provided to enhance the safety of schoolchildren. \n \n10. \nUse  of  Machinery.  Temporary  environmental  concerns  related  to  the  use  of  excavators, \ncranes, compressors, and other machinery during construction works will include (i) noise and dust \nfrom construction sites, and (ii) safety of workers and inhabitants. Measures will include (i) avoiding \nwork  with  noisy  equipment  in  settled  areas  at  night;  (ii)  careful  conduct  of  excavation  and \nearthmoving  works,  and  transportation  of  earth,  particularly  within  settled  areas;  and  (iii)  use  of \nmasks by operators. \n \n11.  Water  Resources.  Water  intakes  will  be  implemented  according  to  the  \u201cauthorization  on \nspecial  water  supply\u201d  approved  by  the  State  Committee  for  Nature  Protection,  which  will  be \nlegalized in the next design phase. In most subproject areas there are only irrigation and drainage \ncanals  as  in-land  surface  waters.  However,  measures  for  the  protection  of  all  types  of  water \nresources  from  any  possible  source  of  contamination  should  be  taken  during  rehabilitation  and \nconstruction  works.  Adequate  waste  management  measures  will  be  implemented  to  prevent \naccidental pollution of water resources. \n \nSoils. Soils could be exposed to contamination by the same sources of pollution as water \n12. \nresources (para. 11). Soil protection measures are to be enforced in accordance with government \nconstruction norms and rules. During pipeline construction, organic topsoil that can be further used \nwill be removed and stored temporarily, apart from the remaining removed earth. The organic soil \nwill be placed on top of the backfilling material, compacted, and restored to agricultural use. The \nsetting in place of the infrastructure required for the Project does not conflict with any other type of \nexisting  utility  infrastructure  such  as  roads,  irrigation  infrastructure,  canals,  and  bridges,  whether \nduring construction or in the long term. \n \n13.  Waste Management. Measures at the construction sites will include the provision of refuse \ncollection  containers  for  solid  waste  and  used-oil  collection  containers,  with  further  removal  to \nspecially  allocated  disposal  and  reclamation  sites.  After  the  completion  of  construction  works,  all \njob sites will be cleaned and landscaped. Sanitation facilities will be constructed at the work sites. \n \n14. \nHistorical  and  Cultural  Sites  and  Landscape.  There  are  no  historical  monuments  or \ncultural landmarks reported within or along the alignments in the subproject areas. The location of \nelevated structures, such as storage tanks, will be selected so as to minimize any disruption of the \n\n \n\n\f \n \nexisting  village  architecture  and  of  the  surrounding  landscape.  Most  elevated  structures  will  be \nconstructed within existing sanitation zone enclosures. \n\nAppendix 13 \n \n\n51\n\n4. \n\nLong-Term Impact and Mitigation Measures \n\nGroundwater  Deposits.  Planned  extraction  from  targeted  groundwater  deposits  is \n15. \nsubstantially  higher  than  current  extraction  levels  but  is  well  within  the  government-approved \nannual  levels  of  extraction  of  these  deposits.  Some  local  groundwater  aquifers  constitute \nsignificant alternative resources for local water supplies in certain subproject areas.  \n \n16.  Wastewater.  A  substantial  increase  in  wastewater  volume  is  expected  in  the  Termez \nsubproject. The existing wastewater treatment plant, covering 50% of the city households, is being \nrenovated and will have a capacity of 12,500 cubic meters (m\u00b3) per day, sufficient to handle current \npeak  demands  of  11,000  m\u00b3/day.  The  local  government  has  started  on  a  feasibility  study  to \nupgrade the facility with funds expected from Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China to a \ncapacity of 35,000 m\u00b3/day, covering 70%\u201375% of the city households. Significant adverse impact is \nnot expected from wastewater discharge in the Termez subproject area once the capacity increase \nhas  been  implemented.  Wastewater  volumes  produced  in  the  other  seven  subprojects  are \nconsidered  \u201cnon-substantial,\u201d  and  are  widely  regarded  as  not  being  a  problem  for  the  following \nreasons:  (i)  low  population  density  in  the  subproject  areas,  (ii)  the  mostly  scattered  location  of \nhouses, (iii) house owners\u2019 practice of recycling domestic wastewater for gardening, (iv) suitability \nof soil conditions for filtering and absorbing organic substances, (v) the substantial depth (200\u2013400 \nmeters  below  the  surface)  of  potable  groundwater  aquifers,  (vi) the  predominant  use  of  dry  pit \nlatrines in these areas, and (vii) the likelihood of a drop in consumption, by as much as 20%, once \nmeters  are  installed.  If  needed,  more  advanced  evacuation  and  treatment  systems  may  be \nimplemented at later stages. \n \n17. \nProtection of Water Resources and Water Quality. Water resources will be protected by \na  sanitary  protection  zone  (SPZ)  to  be  rehabilitated  or  constructed  according  to  the  construction \nnorms  and  rules  for  water  supply  external  nets.  SPZs  will  be  rehabilitated  or  constructed  at  the \nwater  distribution  centers,  water  intake  structures,  water  conduits,  and  water  transmission \nstructures; most of these already exist. A sanitary protection belt, based on the construction rules \nand norms, will also be established along the alignment of water transmission mains crossing built-\nup areas. The quality of water distributed will be controlled daily by the operators responsible for \nthe operation and maintenance (O&M) of each water supply system and weekly by the provincial \nsanitary  and  epidemiological  services  (SES).  Daily  controls  will  include  determination  of  free \nchlorine, and routine physical-chemical analysis. The results of weekly analyses performed by the \nSES must show compliance with the national drinking water quality standards. \n \n18. \nImpact  Caused  by  the  Project  Infrastructure  Operation.  Basically,  the  operation  of  a \nwater supply system does not imply significant risks. The reconstructed chlorination rooms will be \nequipped  with  modern  technological  equipment,  using  alternative  methods  of  disinfection \n(hypochlorite  sodium  or  chloride),  which  prevents  harmful  emissions  to  the  atmosphere.  In  the \ncylinder  storehouse  and  in  chlorine  dosimeters  two  independent  ventilation  systems  will  be \nprovided,  one  in  constant  operation  and  the  other  on  standby.  Anti-seismic  measures  in \naccordance  with  construction  norms  and  rules  for  construction  in  seismic  districts,  aimed  at \ndecreasing  seismic  load  and  increasing  resistance  to  seismic  impact,  will  be  provided  by  the \nProject. The Project envisages anticorrosion measures in accordance with construction norms and \nrules  for  the  protection  of  construction  structural  units  and  structures  from  corrosion  for  the \nmitigation of negative impact on groundwater. Preventive measures intended to protect the health \nof personnel engaged in the operation of the Project, entail strict observance of safety rules, and \nnormative  documents  on  water  supply  operation.  Personnel  engaged  in  water  treatment  will  be \nspecially trained by equipment suppliers. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n52 \n \n \nProject  Demobilization.  There  will  be  no  decommissioning.  The  electromechanical \n19. \ncomponents  will  be  replaced  every  20  years  and  dismantled  parts  will  be  partially  recycled. \nSubstituted  components  of  chlorination  units  will  also  be  dismantled  or  disposed  of  in  safe \nrepositories  for  special  waste,  in  accordance  with  national  regulations.  Existing  water  supply \nsystems that will be rehabilitated or replaced will not be removed from the ground. \n\nD. \n\nEnvironmental Management and Monitoring Plan \n\n20. \nAn  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  (EMMP)  has  been  prepared  and  is \nincluded in the initial environmental examination. It distinguishes between mitigation measures (to \nbe  performed  by  the  contractors),  independent  monitoring,  and  EMMP-related  training.  A  further \ndistinction is made between mitigation and monitoring to be conducted during the construction and \nO&M phases of the water supply infrastructure. All measures (mitigation, monitoring, and training) \nduring  the  construction  will  be  funded  through  the  project  budget;  required  measures  during  the \nO&M phase will be paid out of the vodokanal budget. The parameters to be monitored, as well as \nthe  frequency  of  monitoring  and  reporting,  will  be  tested  and  adjusted  as  needed  during  the \nProject.  A  summary  table  of  the  estimated  budget  for  the  implementation  of  the  EMMP  is  given \nbelow.  The  budget  for  the  mitigation  measures  is  only  indicative.  All  mitigation  measures,  and \nrequired  budgets,  will  be  reflected  in  the  contractors\u2019  bidding  documents  and  contracts.  The  total \nbudget for the implementation of the EMMP is $385,000. \n \n\nTable A13: Costs of Implementing the Environmental Management \nand Monitoring Plan  \n\nDescription \nMitigation measures (to be implemented by contractors) \nIndependent monitoring \nEMMP-related training program \n \n\nTOTAL \n\nEMMP= environmental management and monitoring plan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nAmount ($) \n180,000 \n145,000 \n60,000 \n385,000 \n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements for Environmental Compliance \n\nthe  EMMP \n\nimplementing \n\n21. \nThe provincial department of the State Committee for Nature Protection will be responsible \nfor  (i)  environmental  clearance  of  all  physical  infrastructure,  (ii)  monitoring  of  environmental \ncompliance  during  construction,  and  (iii)  follow-up  environmental  monitoring.  The  provincial  SES \nwill be in charge of periodic testing of physicochemical and bacteriological content in drinking water \nin the distribution system for compliance with national quality norms. The PIU will be responsible \nfor \nin  each  subproject.  Local  government  representatives  and \nschoolteachers  should  be  also  involved  in  the  implementation  of  the  EMMP.  The  project  budget \nincludes  provision  for  the  training  of  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  and  PIU  personnel  in \nenvironmental procedures. To facilitate monitoring, an environmental monitoring group (EMG) will \nbe set up and will be composed of the following: (i) the senior environment specialist\u2013cum\u2013group \nleader,  (ii)  the  environment  expert,  and  (iii)  a  representative  of  the  provincial  administration.  The \nEMG members will be national experts. A report on the environment and the implementation of the \nEMMP  will  be  prepared  and  sent  by  the  Borrower  to  the  ADB  every  6 months  during  project \nimplementation. \n\nF. \n\nPublic Consultations and Information Disclosure \n\nConsultations have been conducted with the responsible national and provincial institutions, \n22. \ndistrict  administrations,  and  other  interested  parties  in  Surkhandarya  Province.  A  stakeholder \n \n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 13 \n \n\n \n \nseminar was organized in Termez on 10 July 2007; there were 61 participants, including provincial \nand district authorities, technical vodokanal staff, representatives of rural assemblies, and women\u2019s \ngroups.  The  main  technical  project  interventions  and  their  main  environmental  and  social  impact \nwere  explained  to  participants,  who  were  invited  to  respond,  express  their  opinions,  and  provide \ninput on (i) technical solutions and the scope of work, (ii) the current state of the environment in the \nproject  areas,  (iii)  environmentally  related  social  and  resettlement  issues,  and  (iv)  planned \nmitigation  measures  and  monitoring  during  rehabilitation  or  construction  and  operation.  The \ndiscussions and comments provided essential background, particularly with regard to overcoming \ngroundwater  contamination  and  other  negative  impact.  Subsequently,  close  focus  meetings  and \ndiscussions  with  local  stakeholders  particularly  makhalla  associations,  public  and  women\u2019s \nsocieties  and  nongovernment  organizations,  and  district  administration  representatives  were  held \nin  the  course  of  social,  resettlement,  and  environmental  studies.  The  concerns  expressed  were \nrelated  mainly  to  land  occupation,  wastewater,  scope  of  work,  and  the  planned  schedule  of \ntechnical interventions. There was general consensus that continuous availability of drinking water \nwould  be  a  substantially  positive  improvement  for  health  and  sanitation.  A  second  stakeholder \nseminar  in  Termez  was  conducted  in  July  2008.  The  EMMP  budget  includes  an  allocation  for \nstakeholder meetings during construction. \n\nG. \n\nConclusions and Recommendations \n\n23. \nThe Project is aimed at improving the health of people\u2014340,000 in all by 2014\u2014who now \nsuffer  from  lack  of  water  supply  and  adequate  sanitation  facilities.  Negative  impact  is  limited  in \nextent,  can  be  prevented  by  implementing  the  EMMP,  and  can  eventually  be  easily  mitigated. \nFurther study into adequate solutions for the increased wastewater volumes that will result from the \nProject is recommended. The development schemes adopted represent the least-cost solutions as \nwell as the most environmentally compatible alternatives. The Project is a necessary step toward \nimproving the economic development and poverty alleviation prospects of the province. Failure to \nimplement  the  Project  would  lead  to  deterioration  of  health,  increase  in  poverty,  and  increase  in \nemigration\u2014particularly  among  young  people  in  search  of  better  living  opportunities  in  cities  or \nabroad.  There  is  a  well-structured  environmental  institutional  framework  at  the  central  and \nprovincial  levels.  Procedures  for  the  examination  of  environmental  compliance  are  well  in  place \nand  tested.  The  legal  basis  is  exhaustive  and  substantially  covers  the  various  environmental \nsectors. Threats to human health will be practically negligible during construction and in the long \nterm. The proposed EMMP should be implemented and revised promptly when needed. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction and Methodology \n\nThe  economic  analysis  covers  the  Project  as  a  whole,  as  well  as  each  individual \n1. \nsubproject,  and  will  be  undertaken  according  to  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  guidelines, \nincluding the guidelines and handbook for the economic analysis of projects, particularly those \nin  the  water  supply  sector. 1  For  the  overall  project,  the  analysis  describes  the  economic \nrationale,  the  rationale  for  public  intervention,  and  the  setting  of  the  without-project  situation. \nThe analysis assumes that without the Project, the existing systems\u2019 supply capacity will remain \nthe same as in 2008. The economic analysis also evaluates the cost-effectiveness of individual \nsubprojects,  focusing  on  the  least-cost  analysis.  The  subproject  analysis  compares  the \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  with  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  (EOCC), \nassumed  at  12%  as  applied  in  infrastructure  project  studies  undertaken  in  Uzbekistan. \nSensitivity and risk analyses are undertaken to assess the robustness of the subproject under \nadverse  economic  conditions.  The  analysis  uses  shadow  pricing  and  standard  conversion \nfactors  to  convert  the  financial  cost  and  benefits  into  economic  terms.  The  analysis  is \nundertaken  in  constant  May  2008  prices.  Details  of  the  economic  analysis  are  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix J. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic Rationale \n\n2. \nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 brought about the sudden stoppage of funding \nand  subsidies  to  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  sector  in  Uzbekistan.  Uzbekistan \ninherited  an  enormous  number  of  WSS  systems  (mostly  overdesigned)  that  are  reaching  the \nend of their useful life. The amount of the capital investment required to rehabilitate or upgrade \nthe  systems  cannot  be  met  solely  by  the  national  and  local  budgets;2 as  a  result,  the  water \nsupply system in the country is faced with further deterioration. To arrest the continued decline \nof  water  supply  services,  the  Government  has  begun  a  number  of  key  reforms  including \n(i) improvements  in  water  sector  services  through  a  national  water  supply  development  plan; \n(ii) financial  sustainability  goals  through  cost  recovery;  (iii)  adequate  investment  planning  with \ndomestic  and  external  funding;  (iv)  further  decentralization  of  WSS  services;  (v) private  sector \nparticipation  and  public-private  partnerships  in  the  sector;  (vi) the  conservation  of  water \nresources, the economic use of water, consistent water quality control, and sound management \nof  wastewater;  and  (vii)  improvements  in  operational  strategies  through  a  stronger  sector \ninstitutional set-up and interagency collaboration, and adequate capacity building. \n \n3. \nGovernment  intervention  derives  its  rationale  from  the  increasing  concern  over  the \nworsening water supply situation in Surkhandarya Province, where low and declining coverage \nis being made worse by the slow pace of development in the sector. Water supply systems are \nowned  and  managed  by  the  vodokanals.  However,  studies  show  that  where  such  centralized \nsystems  exist,  services  only  continue  to  worsen  because  the  vodokanals,  lacking  funds  and \ncapacigty, can do very little to improve and rehabilitate the systems. Low tariffs plus significant \nwater  losses  in  the  systems  result  in  very  limited  revenue  generation,  which,  in  many  cases, \ncannot even cover the required operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. The private sector in \nthe  water  supply  sector  is  still  not  developed.  Consequently,  large-scale  system  repair  or \nextension works can be financed only with government support. Despite government efforts to \n                                                 \n1   ADB.  1997.  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.  Manila;  ADB.  1999.

The  supply  shortage  has  had  a  negative  impact  on  the  health  of  the \npopulation, particularly the poor, who are the most affected, as recent studies have confirmed.4 \nThe water supply systems are in various stages of deterioration and are only partially functional. \nWithout urgent major investments in supply and distribution networks, water supply systems will \ncontinue to deteriorate rapidly, with serious economic and environmental consequences. \n \n4. \n Government  involvement  is  justified  because  of  the  significant  positive  externalities \nassociated  with  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  and  their  natural  monopoly  conditions. \nMoreover, there is significant scope for the improvement of water supply and sanitation services \nin  Uzbekistan  through  the  provision  of  financial  and  technical  support  and  institutional \nstrengthening, which at present can be provided effectively only by the Government. \n\nC. \n\nDemand Analysis \n\n5. \nWater demand in the subproject areas has been constrained by the deterioration of the \npiped  water  systems  and  their  limited  capacity  to  supply  consumers.  Actual  consumption  is \ndifficult to ascertain from the vodokanals\u2019 records, since only a few consumers are metered. The \nsocioeconomic survey5 revealed that water supply from the vodokanals averages 13.3 liters per \ncapita per day (lpcd) in Termez City and 12.5 lpcd in the seven other subproject areas. \n \n6. \nThe low water supply from the vodokanals is augmented by other water supply sources \nthat  include  water  vendors,  reservoirs,  wells,  canals,  and  rivers.  Average  consumption  from \nthese additional sources is about 11.3 lpcd. \n \n7. \nThe  population  in  the  service  area  is  projected  to  grow  by  1.11%  yearly  from  2008  to \n2010,  and  by  1.23%  from  2011  onward.  Service  coverage  is  projected  to  increase  gradually \nfrom  the  current  level  to  about  95%  by  2020.  Projected  average  water  demand  per  capita  is \n100 lpcd, with adjustments for institutional, commercial, and industrial use for each subproject. \nThis  figure  is  based  on  the  standard  adopted  by  the  Government.  While  metering  the \nconsumption and increasing tariffs will result in a lower consumption rate, the increased income \nwill  offset  the  reduction  in  consumption  rate.  Given  this  per  capita  demand,  the  designed \ncapacity is projected to meet water demand up to 2020. From 2021 and onward, it is assumed \nthat water supply will remain at the 2020 level. \n\nD. \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis \n\nTechnical  alternatives  for  four  subprojects 6 \u2014components  considered  essential  in  a \n8. \nsustainable  water  supply  system\u2014were  analyzed.  The  choice  of  options  was  based  on \n(i) technical and physical feasibility; (ii) unit supply costs, given the incremental investment and \nO&M costs; and (iii) sustainability of the available water resource. The least-cost solutions were \nchosen for the project design and the cost-benefit analysis.  \n                                                 \n3 Service  coverage  levels  remain  relatively  low  even  after  programmed  intervention  in  the  past  10  years  via  the \nnational  water  supply  development  plan.  Studies  show  that,  as  of  2006,  network  coverage  in  Surkhandarya  was \nabout 76%. Where it exists, water service is available 6\u201316 hours per day in urban areas and 2\u201310 hours in rural \nareas.  The  rest  of  the  population  obtains  water  from  wells  and  irrigation  canals,  which  are  mostly  distant,  saline, \nand contaminated. \n\n4 The  social  survey  revealed  that  there  are  10  times  more  cases  of  stomach  ailments  among  users  of  alternative \n\nsources, especially irrigation canals. \n\n5  Undertaken during the project design in May 2007 and May 2008. \n6  For the other subprojects, only one technical option was available. \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nE. \n\nEconomic Costs \n\n9. \nEconomic costs exclude taxes and duties. Financial prices were converted to economic \nprices  through  the  use  of  conversion  factors.  The  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  (SERF)  was \nassumed to be 1.0. The conversion factor for skilled and unskilled labor was assumed to be 1.0, \nand the shadow wage rate factor (SWRF), 0.8.  \n\nF. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n10. \nThe major economic benefits of improved water supply services are (i) non-incremental \nwater  consumption,  valued  at  the  average  economic  supply  price 7 of  water  from  non-piped \nsources;  and  (ii)  incremental  water  consumption,  valued  at  the  price  consumers  are  willing  to \npay8 for the improved water supply services. Benefits that are been deemed difficult to quantify, \nincluding  health  benefits  from  avoided  medical  costs  and  fire  protection,  are  recognized  but \nwere excluded from the analysis.  \n\nG. \n\nResults of Economic Analysis  \n\n11 \nThe EIRR was used to measure the economic effectiveness of the Project. A project with \nan  EIRR  greater  than  its  EOCC  would  be  considered  economically  viable.  The  Project  was \nfurther tested for economic viability under less favorable or even adverse economic conditions. \nFour  hypothetical  scenarios  were  formulated  to  simulate  such  conditions  in  the  analysis:  (i)  a \n20%  increase  in  capital  cost,  (ii)  a  20%  increase  in  operating  costs,  (iii)  a  20%  decrease  in \nrevenue, and (iv) a 1-year delay in subproject implementation. \n \n12. \nFor the eight subprojects, EIRR was calculated to be between 24.4% and 39.7%, with an \naverage  of  32.1%.  Subjected  to  the  sensitivity  tests,  the  subprojects  were  also  found  to  be \nrobust and economically viable. The calculated EIRR is expected to be lower than the true EIRR \nsince  the  economic,  social,  and  environmental  implications  of  not  undertaking  the  subprojects \nare not desirable and can worsen poverty in the project areas. \n\n                                                 \n7  Includes  costs  of  collecting,  storing,  and  treating  of  water.  The  average  cost  is  estimated  at  SUM76,000  per \n\nhousehold per year, according to the survey. \n\n8  TAHLIL  Center  for  Social  Research.  2007.

The  seven  districts  are  Angor,  Djarkurgan,  Kizirik, \nKumkurgan,  Muzrabad,  Sariasiya,  and  Shurchi.  Angor  and  Kizirik  districts  are  under  the \nmanagement  of \nthe  Khodjaipak  Regional  Trunk  Main  Operation  and  Management \nAdministration. In Djarkurgan district, two vodokanals (water supply agencies) will be covered\u2014\nDjarkurgan  vodokanal,  which  serves  the  district  center;  and  Surkhan  vodokanal,  which  serves \nthe  nearby  settlements.  Capital  investments  will  focus  on  the  rehabilitation  of  existing  water \nsupply systems and expansion to settlements near the district centers. \n \n2. \nThe  financial  analysis  of  the  water  supply  component  was  undertaken  in  two  parts: \n(i) determination  of  appropriate  water  tariffs  for  each  subproject  that  would  ensure  financial \nsustainability,  and  (ii)  preparation  of  financial  projections  for  each  subproject.  The  projections \nconsisted  of  annual  financial  statements  (income  statement,  cash  flow  statement,  and  balance \nsheet), key performance indicators, and operating and financial data for 2009\u20132020. Details of the \nfinancial analysis are presented in Supplementary Appendix K. \n\nB. \n\nBases for Financial Projections \n\n3. \nPrice.  The  financial  projections  for  each  subproject  are  presented  on  a  current  price \nbasis. Revenues and costs were converted from constant 2008 prices to current prices through \nthe use of projected local annual inflation rates as follows: 10.5% in 2009, 10% in 2010, 9% in \n2011 to 2012, 5% in 2013, and 4% from 2014 onward. 1 \n \nFinancial  Objectives.  The  proposed  tariff  rates  for  each  subproject  were  designed  to \n4. \n(i) fully recover operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, (ii) recover all subproject debt service, \n(iii)  maintain  a  debt  service  ratio  of  at  least  1.2,  and  (iv)  generate  a  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn  (FIRR)  greater  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  the  Project, \nwherever  feasible,  after  project  completion.  In  addition,  each  subproject  was  projected  to \nmaintain its accounts receivable at less than 60 days\u2019 equivalent of annual sales by 2016. \n \n5. \nOperating  Revenues. Operating revenues include water sales and repayment of water \nmeters. Repayment of water meter was assumed to be made in 36 equal monthly installments \nand billed to consumers accordingly. Future water sales were calculated on the basis of water \ndemand (Appendix 12) and projected water tariff levels. Tariffs were set in accordance with the \ngovernment policy, i.e., a maximum of 20% per increase, a maximum of two tariff increases per \nyear, and a maximum profit of 10%.2  \n \n6. \nOperating Expenses. Annual O&M costs were projected separately for each subproject \nover  the  entire  forecast  period  by  major  expense  item  (salary,  electricity,  chemicals, \nmaintenance, social charges, selling and administration expenses). Depreciation allowance was \ncalculated on an average asset life of 20 years using the straight-line method. Income tax was \nassumed to be 10%. \n \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2008. Global Development Finance 2008: The Role of International Banking.

Subproject capital costs will be funded through \n7. \nan ADB loan and from government funds. The ADB loan will have a term of 32 years, including \na grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1% yearly during the grace period and 1.5% \nyearly  thereafter.  The  Government  will  relend  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  to  UCSA  under  a \nsubsidiary  loan  agreement.  The  relending  will  be  done  on  ADB  loan  terms  with  an  additional \ncharge of not more than 0.2% on the ADB interest rate (1.2% during the grace period and 1.7% \nyearly  thereafter).  UCSA  will  onlend  the  proceeds  of  the  subsidiary  loan  to  the  subproject \nvodokanals through the Surkhandarya provincial government on the same terms. The provincial \ngovernment will bear the foreign exchange risks.  \n\nC. \n\nFinancial Projections \n\nTariff. The existing average tariff (household) in the vodokanals covered by the Project \n8. \nis only SUM43 per cubic meter (m3) as of May 2008. For the eight vodokanals, the household \ntariff ranges from SUM28 per m3 to SUM67 per m3. For financial sustainability, the average tariff \nrequired after project completion is projected to range from SUM54 per m3 to SUM369 per m3 \nfrom 2015 to 2020.3 Table A13.1 shows the projected tariff levels for household consumers at \nconstant  2008  prices.  The  existing  tariff  structure  was  followed  during  the  projection  period. \nThese tariffs were based on the financial objectives enumerated in para. 4 above and took into \naccount the affordability of the tariffs to the households in the low-income group. \n \n\nProjected Tariff Requirements and Affordability a \n(in constant 2008 prices) \n \n2016 \n\n2015 \n\n2017 \n\n2018 \n\n2019 \n\n2020 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \nTermez \nTariff (SUM per m3) \nAffordability \n \n \n\nLow Income (%) \nAverage Income (%) \n\nDjarkurgan \nTariff (SUM per m3) \nAffordability \n \n \n\nLow Income (%) \nAverage Income (%) \n\nKhojaipak \nTariff (SUM per m3) \nAffordability \n \n \n\nLow Income (%) \nAverage Income (%) \n\nKumkurgan \nTariff (SUM per m3) \nAffordability \n \n \n\nLow Income (%) \nAverage Income (%) \n\n112 \n \n0.9 \n1.0 \n\n \n54 \n \n0.5 \n0.4 \n\n \n175 \n \n1.8 \n1.6 \n\n \n102 \n \n1.1 \n1.0 \n\n127 \n \n1.1 \n1.1 \n\n \n63 \n \n0.6 \n0.4 \n\n \n176 \n \n1.8 \n1.6 \n\n \n112 \n \n1.2 \n1.2 \n\n134 \n \n1.2 \n1.3 \n\n \n72 \n \n0.8 \n0.5 \n\n \n178 \n \n1.8 \n1.7 \n\n \n121 \n \n1.3 \n1.3 \n\n142 \n \n1.3 \n1.4 \n\n \n82 \n \n0.9 \n0.6 \n\n \n180 \n \n1.9 \n1.7 \n\n \n128 \n \n1.4 \n1.4 \n\n150 \n \n1.5 \n1.5 \n\n \n87 \n \n0.9 \n0.6 \n\n \n181 \n \n1.9 \n1.7 \n\n \n135 \n \n1.5 \n1.4 \n\n159 \n \n1.6 \n1.7 \n\n \n92 \n \n1.0 \n0.7 \n\n \n183 \n \n1.9 \n1.8 \n\n \n143 \n \n1.6 \n1.5 \n\n                                                 \n3  In constant May 2008 prices. \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\nAppendix 15 \n \n\n59\n\nLow Income (%) \nAverage Income (%) \n\nItem \nMuzrabad \nTariff (SUM per m3) \nAffordability \n \n \n \nSariasiya \nTariff (SUM per m3) \nAffordability \n \n \n\nLow Income (%) \nAverage Income (%) \n\nShurchi \nTariff (SUM per m3) \nAffordability \n \n \n\nLow Income (%) \nAverage Income (%) \n\n2015 \n \n159 \n \n1.5 \n1.5 \n \n \n80 \n \n0.8 \n0.8 \n\n \n81 \n \n0.7 \n0.6 \n\n2016 \n \n198 \n \n1.8 \n1.9 \n \n \n88 \n \n0.8 \n0.9 \n\n \n86 \n \n0.8 \n0.7 \n\n2017 \n \n238 \n \n2.2 \n2.3 \n \n \n97 \n \n0.9 \n1.0 \n\n \n91 \n \n0.9 \n0.7 \n\nSurkhan \nTariff (SUM per m3) \nAffordability \n \n \na  Includes payment for water meters in 36 equal monthly installments. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nLow Income (%) \nAverage Income (%) \n\n \n227 \n \n2.4 \n1.6 \n\n \n197 \n \n2.0 \n1.3 \n\n \n164 \n \n1.6 \n1.1 \n\n2018 \n \n286 \n \n2.7 \n2.8 \n \n \n105 \n \n1.0 \n1.1 \n\n \n92 \n \n0.9 \n0.7 \n\n \n262 \n \n2.8 \n1.9 \n\n2019 \n \n331 \n \n3.2 \n3.2 \n \n \n111 \n \n1.1 \n1.1 \n\n \n92 \n \n0.9 \n0.7 \n\n \n278 \n \n3.0 \n2.0 \n\n2020 \n \n369 \n \n3.6 \n3.6 \n \n \n117 \n \n1.2 \n1.2 \n\n \n93 \n \n0.9 \n0.8 \n\n \n294 \n \n3.2 \n2.2 \n\n \n\n \n\n9. \nAffordability.  An  affordability  analysis  was  undertaken  to  ensure  that  household \nconsumers, particularly those in the low-income group, can afford the proposed water tariffs. On \nthe  generally  accepted  principle  that  the  expenditure  on  water  should  not  exceed  4%  of \nhousehold income, the projected water tariffs are considered affordable. The table above shows \nthe ratio of the monthly bills to the monthly household income for the low-income group and the \naverage-income  group.  The  monthly  bills  include  payment  for  the  water  meters  in  36  equal \nmonthly installments. \n\n10.  WACC  and  FIRR.  The  opportunity  cost  of  the  government  funds  is  assumed  at  25%, \nincluding a risk premium. At a funding ratio of 79:21 between ADB and the Government, WACC \nis  about  4.2%  in  constant  May  2008  prices.  The  FIRRs  are  estimated  to  range  from  5.1%  to \n5.8%, with an average of 5.4% for the Project. All FIRRs are higher than the WACC. Sensitivity \nanalysis  also  showed  that  under  the  assumed  adverse  conditions,  all  eight  subprojects  would \nstill be financially viable. In addition, the proposed tariff rate increases would generate enough \nrevenues  to  recover  full  O&M  costs  from  2013  onward.  By  2015,  annual  revenues  for  all  the \nsubproject vodokanals are projected to cover all O&M costs and debt service obligations, and a \ndebt service ratio of at least 1.2:1 will be maintained. \n\nD. \n\nFinancial Performance of Vodokanals \n\n11. \nRecent  Financial  Performance.  The  last  3  years  of  operation  of  the  subproject \nvodokanals  showed  a  positive  net  income  except  for  Khodjaipak  vodokanal. 4 From  2005  to \n\n                                                 \n4  This income result was achieved by stinting on O&M, a practice that jeopardizes the system in the long run. \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n2007, Surkhan5 vodokanal registered a net income of 2%\u20133% of total revenue, while the other \nsubproject vodokanals registered a net income of less than 1% of total revenue.  \n \n12. \nProjected  Financial  Performance.  Net  income  is  projected  to  be  positive  for  all \nsubprojects from 2017 onward and net cash flow to be positive for all subprojects by 2015, the \nyear after the project facilities are put into operation. The negative net income in the beginning \nyears  for  some  subprojects  is  due  mainly  to  the  time  needed  to  expand  the  connections  and \ngradually  increase  tariffs.  The  difference  between  the  net  cash  flow  and  net  income \nperformance  is  mainly  due  to  the  of  time  difference  between  the  collection  of  depreciation \nallowance  and  the  repayment  of  the  loan:  interest  payments  will  start  in  2015  and  principal \nrepayment will start in 2017. \n \nTermez  vodokanal  is  projected  to  post  a  positive  return  on  net  fixed  assets  (ROA)  of \n13. \n2.4%\u201316.3%  from  2016  to  2020.  Debt  service  ratio  (DSR)  will  be  greater  than  1.2  during  the \nprojection  period.  Djarkurgan  vodokanal  is  projected  to  register  a  net  income  by  2018,  while \nROA will range from 2.6% to 11.7% from 2017 to 2020. DSR will be greater than 1.2 during the \nprojection period. Khodjaipak is projected to show a positive financial performance after project \ncompletion.  The  financial  projections  assumed  that  the  other  districts  served  by  Khodjaipak6 \nwould implement tariff increases to cover annual increase in total O&M costs. DSR would range \nfrom 4.1 to 18.3, while ROA would range from 8.2% to 34.7%. \n \n14. \nKumkurgan  vodokanal  is  projected  to  post  a  net  income  by  2017  and  ROA  of  1.1%\u2013\n16.3% from 2016 to 2020. DSR will be greater than 1.2 during the projection period. Muzrabad \nvodokanal will generate net income only from 2017 onward, mainly because of higher per capita \ninvestment, although net cash flow will be positive from 2015 to 2020. DSR will be greater than \n1.2  during  the  projection  period.  Sariasiya  vodokanal  will  have  a  positive  net  income  by  2018 \nand a positive net cash flow by 2015. ROA is projected to range from 1.1% to 12.4% from 2016 \nto 2020. DSR will range from 1.7 to 6.6 after project completion.  \n \n15. \nShurchi vodokanal is projected to register a net income by 2014 and a positive net cash \nflow by 2015. ROA will range from 6.4% to 29.5% from 2015 to 2020. DSR will be greater than \n1.2  during  the  projection  period.  Surkhan  vodokanal  will  generate  net  income  starting  in  2016 \nand a positive net cash flow from 2015 to 2020. The vodokanal will have DSRs greater than 1.2 \nduring the projection period. \n\n                                                 \n5  Surkhan vodokanal is involved in water supply construction. In 2007, the revenue from the construction business \n\nwas 65% of the vodokanal\u2019s total revenues. \n\n6  Khodjaipak vodokanal covers seven districts, including Angor and Kizirik. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 6 October 2008) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "\u2013 \n", "sum (SUM) \n", "SUM1.00\n$1.00\n", "$0.00075 \nSUM1,330 \n", "= \n= \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n", " \n \n", "ADB \nDSR \nEA \nEIRR \nEMMP \nHIV/AIDS \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \ndebt service ratio \nexecuting agency \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management and monitoring plan \nhuman immune deficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency \nsyndrome \ninitial environmental examination \nfinancial internal rate of return \nland acquisition and resettlement \n", "IEE \nFIRR \nLAR \nMDTF \nNCB \nNWSDP \nO&M \nPIU \nPMU \nPPMS \nPPP \nROA \nSES \nSOE \nSPG \nUCSA \nUFW \nWACC \nWFPF \nWSS \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Multi-Donor Trust Fund \nnational competitive bidding \n\u2013 \nNational Water Supply Development Program \n\u2013 \noperation and maintenance \n\u2013 \nproject implementation unit \n\u2013 \nproject management unit \n\u2013 \nproject performance monitoring system \n\u2013 \npublic\u2013private partnership \n\u2013 \nreturn on net fixed assets \n\u2013 \nsanitary and epidemiological services \n\u2013 \nstatement of expenditure \n\u2013 \nSurkhandarya provincial government \n\u2013 \nUzbekistan Communal Services Agency \n\u2013 \nunaccounted-for water \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nweighted average cost of capital \n\u2013  Water Financing Partnership Facility \n\u2013 \n", "water supply and sanitation \n", " \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "km \nlpcd \nm3 \n", "kilometer \nliters per capita per day \ncubic meter \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "GLOSSARY \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.  \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars.  \n", " \n \n", "vodokanal \nmakhalla \n", "water supply and sanitation agency \nthe smallest administrative group in a community \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "X.
