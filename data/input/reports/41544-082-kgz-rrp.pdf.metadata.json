Growth  of  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP) averaged 4.1% since 2002, fluctuating from \u20131.4% to 8.5%. Gross fixed capital \nformation increased from 16.4% of GDP in 2005 to 25.3% in 2011, but its growth was volatile. \nThe country  has  attracted foreign  investment,  but mainly  in  gold  mining, which  generates  little \nemployment. The official unemployment rate was 7.8% in 2011, but actual unemployment may \nbe much higher. Low growth rates and economic instability were mainly caused by weaknesses \nin  the  business  environment,  combined  with  internal  and  external  shocks.  These  included \npolitical  turmoil  in  2005  and  2010,3\n and  spillover  from  the  global  crisis  in  2008\u20132009,  mainly \nthrough  Kazakhstan  and  the  Russian  Federation.  Insufficient  economic  diversification  makes \nthe economy of the Kyrgyz Republic particularly vulnerable to shocks. \n\n3. \nWith the investment climate and despite past reforms, private enterprises still suffer from \nexcessive regulatory and licensing requirements, pervasive inspections by various enforcement \nagencies, complex and arbitrary taxation, and cross-border trade barriers such as complex pre-\n4\n constrain most \ncustoms clearance. These, with the room for corruption and fraud they create,\nprivate  enterprises,  especially  women  entrepreneurs\u2019  smaller  businesses.  Remaining  policy, \nlegal, and regulatory issues restrict access to finance, particularly for micro, small, and medium-\nsized  enterprises  and  women  entrepreneurs,  who  frequently  have  little  collateral  to  offer  for \ncultural reasons. Inadequate worker skills are an increasingly pressing issue, as the education \nsystem  responds  poorly  to  changing  market  needs  and  many  qualified  workers  seek \nemployment  abroad.  Labor  migrants\u2019  remittances  reached  25%  of  GDP  in  2010,  but  they  fuel \nconsumption  rather  than  investment  and  increase  imports,  as  the  weak  business  environment \nprevents many enterprises from positively responding to demand by increasing production and \nemployment.  Finally,  weaknesses  in  the  education  and  health  systems  and  inadequate \ninfrastructure  in  other  sectors  frequently  result  from  underinvestment.  A  weak  enabling \nenvironment has been preventing private investment in these areas. Due to fiscal weakness, the \nKyrgyz Republic is in particular need of such investment.  \n\nThere  is  broad  consensus  that  the  long-term  development  prospects  of  the  Kyrgyz \n4. \nRepublic  depend  on  its  ability  to  improve  its  investment  climate  to  develop  a  vibrant  private \nsector,  diversify  the  economy,  and  expand  markets.  This  would  make  the  economy  more \nresilient, promote long-term growth, create additional employment, and help reduce poverty. \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  The TA will be cofinanced on a grant basis by (i) ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV); and (ii) the \n\nFinancial Sector Development Partnership Fund, administered by ADB. \n\n3   In March 2005, the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s longtime President Askar Akaev was ousted through the \u201cTulip Revolution\u201d. \nIn April 2010, a popular uprising toppled the regime of President Kurmanbek Bakiev. Internal ethnic conflict in June \n2010 exacerbated the already difficult political and economic situation. \n\n4   The Kyrgyz Republic ranks significantly low (164th out of 178 countries) in Transparency International\u2019s Corruption \n\nPerceptions Index 2011. \n\n\fimplementation  of  subprogram 2  has  also  benefited \n\nThe  Investment  Climate  Improvement  Program,  approved  by  the  Asian  Development \n5. \nBank  (ADB)  in  2008,  follows  a  programmatic  approach  and  envisages  three  subprograms  to \nassist the government in creating conditions for sustainable economic growth and employment-\ngenerating  investments.5 Subprogram  1,  implemented  in  2007\u20132008,  included  a  policy-based \ngrant,  a  project  grant  supporting  the  development  of  information  technology  systems  for \neffective implementation of reforms, and a TA grant to help prepare subprogram 2. Preparation \nand \nfrom  and  reinforced  other \ninterventions. 6\n The  reforms  supported  under  subprogram  2  build  on  the  achievements  made \nunder  subprogram  1  despite  difficult  political  and  external  conditions.  They  address  binding \nconstraints to private sector development and diversification in the areas of business regulation \nand  taxation,  access  to  finance,  worker  skills  development,  and  public\u2013private  partnerships \n(PPPs).  The  relevance  of  these  constraints  has  been  confirmed  through  recent  studies  and \nsurveys,  which  explain  some  deviations  from  the  constraints  originally  identified  in  2008. \nSubprogram 2 is effectively gender mainstreamed to maximize benefits to women. The reform \nagenda that remains after subprogram 2 will be addressed under subprogram 3.  \n\nSubprogram  2  complements  the  efforts  of  (i)  ADB  and  other  development  partners  to \n6. \nstrengthen  physical  infrastructure  and  improve  access  to  finance;  and  (ii)  the  International \nMonetary  Fund  (IMF)  to  rebuild  fiscal  buffers  and  safeguard  monetary  stability,  which  are \nimportant for a healthy business and investment climate.\n\n7\n \n\nImproving  the  investment  climate  for  the  private  sector  is  critical  for  the  government\u2019s \n7. \n8 Subprogram 2 contributes toward this end. The Government of the \neconomic growth policies.\nKyrgyz  Republic  emphasizes  improving  the  business  climate. 9  ADB\u2019s  country  operations \nbusiness  plan  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  identifies  subprogram  2  as  a  means  of  broadening  the \nKyrgyz economy and its private sector.10\n \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  of  subprogram  2  will  be  sustainable  economic  growth  and  employment \n\n8. \ncreation. The outcome will be an improved business environment and investment climate.  \n\n                                                \n5   ADB. 2008.

Subprogram  2  has  reduced  the \nregulatory  costs  of  operating  a  business  and  made  regulatory  action  more  transparent  and \naccountable. This has also helped reduce the scope for fraud and corruption. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n1\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\fSpecifically, under subprogram 2, the government has simplified business registration by \n11. \nstreamlining  preregistration  requirements,  acceding  to  the  Hague  Apostille  Convention  that \nabolishes  the  requirement  of  legalization  for  foreign  public  documents,  establishing  one-stop \nregistration  shops  in  all  regions  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  allowing  electronic  submission  of \ndocuments.  The  latter  is  particularly  important  for  entrepreneurs  in  remote  areas,  which  are \noften  rural  women.  The  government  has  also  reduced  tax  compliance  costs  and  scope  for \ninformal payments by simplifying tax forms and the profit tax system for small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs), and introducing one-stop windows for taxpayers and electronic filing of tax \nreturns.  \n\nFollowing a regulatory impact assessment,11\n\n12. \n licenses have been reduced by more than \n20%.  The  number  of  licenses  can  be  further  reduced  and  their  validity  extended  under \nsubprogram  3.  Furthermore,  the  government  has  introduced  the  concept  of  risk-based \ninspections,  which  prioritizes  firms  with  higher  risk  of  noncompliance,  instead  of  targeting  all \nfirms. This  approach  helps  use scarce  regulatory  capacity  more  efficiently,  reduce  compliance \ncost,  and  minimize  corruption.  The  number  of  inspection  agencies  will  be  reduced  under \nsubprogram  3.  Finally,  under  subprogram  2,  a  pilot  system  for  pre-customs  clearing  was \ninitiated  to  facilitate  compliance  with  cross-border  trade  rules.  The  system  automates  the \nexchange  of  information  between  government  bodies  involved  in  pre-customs  clearance,  and \nthe submission of documents to customs. \n\nAs  a  deviation from  indicative  actions  included  in  the  policy  matrix for  subprogram  2  in \n13. \n2008, subprogram 2 is not supporting deregistration of dormant companies, because it was not \nreconfirmed as a key binding constraint for the private sector. Further, ISO 9001 confirmation for \nthe  one-stop  business  registration  process  has  not  been  included  given  its  time  and  resource \nrequirements. Instead, subprogram 2 has reduced tax compliance costs, as outlined above.  \n\n14. \nOutput  2:  Access  to  finance  improved.  Subprogram  2  has  addressed  structural \nimpediments to lending by promoting alternative financial products and strengthening nonbank \nfinancing  sources,  including  microfinance  organizations  (MFOs).  This  will  benefit  SMEs  and \nmicroenterprises\u2014particularly women entrepreneurs, who account for 75% of MFO borrowers. \n\n15. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  government  has  improved  creditor  rights  and  the  dispute \nresolution  framework  by  enabling  accelerated  court  enforcement  of  arbitral  awards  to  reduce \nforeclosure  costs.  Online  filing  of  pledges  and  payment  of  fees  will  be  enabled  under \nsubprogram 3. To help mitigate credit risks, the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR), \nas regulator,  has  institutionalized  incentives for financial  institutions to  share credit  information \nby  strengthening  self-regulation  of  the  credit  bureau.  The  bureau  now  requires  members  to \ncheck credit histories of loan applicants and report credit events, while the NBKR is supervising \ncompliance.  As  an  alternative  to  loans,  the  government  has  promoted  financial  leasing  by \nremoving  tax  disadvantages  compared  to  other  borrowing  instruments.  Leasing  may  be  very \nattractive for women who present a good credit risk but often cannot offer collateral. To increase \nthe availability of financial services, the NBKR is enabling MFOs to serve their clients better by \nextending  the  scope  of  their  services  beyond  loans  and  leasing.  The  NBKR  has  also \nstreamlined  regulatory  requirements  for  term  deposits  to  improve  the  funding  availability  of \nMFOs, and clarified the process and requirements for the transformation of MFOs into deposit-\ntaking banks. This will allow larger MFOs to grow with their clients\u2019 needs. The NBKR has also \nenabled  group  lending  to  be  classified  as  secured  lending  for  banks\u2019  prudential  requirements; \nthis will remove a specific transformation constraint and benefit borrowers without collateral.  \n\n                                                \n11  The regulatory impact assessment has been conducted since 2008 by a unit in the Ministry of Economy under the \noversight  of  an  interministerial  commission.  Technical  assistance  was  provided  by  ADB  until  2010  and  by  the \nUnited States Agency for International Development until 2011. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fAs a change from indicative actions included in the subprogram 2 policy matrix in 2008, \n16. \nsubprogram  2  does  not  support  public  awareness  campaigns  on  financial  leases,  since \nawareness  is  assessed as  sufficiently  strong.  Further, subprogram  2  does  not  include  a  study \non options for developing credit information sharing, since credit information sharing is making \nsignificant  progress.  Instead,  subprogram  2  has  helped  enhance  the  scope  of  services  MFOs \ncan offer. \n\n17. \nOutput  3:  Workers\u2019  skills  enhanced.  The Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s technical and vocational \neducation and training system has not been responsive to changing market needs, contributing \nto unemployment and widening skill gaps in the labor market. Subprogram 2 has strengthened \nthe  institutional  framework  for  workforce  skills  development,  which  has  been  made  more \ndemand-driven by establishing the National Professional Skills Development Council (NPSDC) \nin March 2012. NPSDC comprises representatives of public and private stakeholders, including \nwomen entrepreneurs. Further, technical qualification frameworks, competency standards, and \ntraining  packages  for  18  occupations  (five  of  which  women  dominated)12\n have  been  adopted \nand pilot training undertaken by the Agency for Vocational Education. Output 3 was not included \nin  the  indicative  actions  under  subprogram  2  in  2008,  since  the  lack  of  skilled  workers  has \nrecently developed into a binding constraint for private businesses. \n\n18. \nOutput 4: Public\u2013private partnerships facilitated. To provide PPP with a strong legal \nbasis  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  a  PPP  law  in  line  with  international good  practices  was  enacted \nunder subprogram 2. This will prepare the ground for bringing sector laws in line with the PPP \nlaw, and for developing standard tender documents and procedures under subprogram 3. Under \nsubprogram  2,  the  government  has  also  adopted  a  policy  framework  for  PPP  projects  that \nestablishes  criteria  for  financial  support  and  risk  sharing.  Further,  the  capacity  of  a  PPP  risk \nmanagement  unit  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  and  a  unit  for  PPP  promotion  and \n13 were further strengthened. Under subprogram \ncoordination in the Ministry of Economy (MOE)\n3,  complementary  capacity  for  PPP  project  development  needs  to  be  built  in  sector  ministries \nand  at  local  government  levels,  including  Bishkek  city,  to  facilitate  project  development  and \nmanagement. 14 This  has  been  confirmed  while  developing  and  institutionalizing  a  screening \nmechanism for potential PPP projects in public sector investment pipelines under subprogram 2. \nSeven projects have been identified for pre-feasibility studies with the help of this mechanism.15\n \nSubprogram 3 will support a study on PPP entry points in the health sector, which is particularly \nimportant for maternal health services. \n\n19. \nThe  creation  of  a  website  for  disclosure  of  policy,  legal,  regulatory,  and  PPP  project-\nrelated information that was indicated in 2008 has not been included in subprogram 2, since it \nappears  premature\u2014important  elements  of  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework  are  still \nmissing. Together with the assessment of financing needs of PPP projects, the website creation \ncould be included in subprogram 3. The completion of a long-term master plan for the transport \nsector  and  the  implementation  of  a  cost-recovery  strategy  for  the  energy  sector  have  been \n\n                                                \n12 Electric  and  gas  welder;  electrician  (household  equipment);  electrician  (electric  equipment);  electrician  (power \nstations  and  networks);  motor  mechanic;  plumber;  plasterer,  paver;  master  gypsum  plasterboard  construction; \nmaster  finisher;  joiner-carpenter;  junior  veterinary  assistant;  farmer; operator  on  agricultural  products  processing; \nhotel industry worker; cook; tailor; cutter; and hairdresser.

All policy actions included \nin the policy matrix of subprogram 2 have been complied with (Appendix 4). The local currency \nfunds generated by the grant will finance the government\u2019s development expenditure program.  \n\n18\n\n21. \nThe grant size is justified in light of the overall development finance needs of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic.  The  government  has  embarked  on  a  process  of  fiscal  consolidation  under  an  IMF-\nsupported program with the aim to reduce public debt from 62.6% of GDP in 2010 to 55.1% in \n2014. The state budget for 2012 foresees expenditure of Som115.8 billion (or $2.5 billion). This \nis  equivalent  to  about  38.4%  of  forecast  GDP,  down  from  39.7%  in  2011.  However,  the \ngovernment  plans  to  keep  capital  expenditure  at  the  same  level  as  in  2011  at  about  7.0%  of \nGDP,  given  its  importance  for  growth.\n The  planned  budget  deficit  for  2012  is  equivalent  to \n6.7% of GDP, down from 7.6% in 2011. The government does not have access to international \ncapital  markets.  Domestic  deficit  financing  is  still  restricted  by  the  legacy  of  the  recent  global \ncrisis,  which  hit  banks  and  securities  markets  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  particularly  hard.  Deficit \nfinancing,  thus,  mainly  depends  on  access  to  concessional  funds  from  abroad.  Without  these \nfunds,  capital  expenditure  would  have  to  be  cut  substantially,  which  would  decelerate  GDP \ngrowth and potentially undermine social and political stability. The proposed grant of $20 million \nis equivalent to 0.3% of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s GDP, 4.3% of capital expenditure, and 4.5% of \nthe  budget  deficit  in  2012.  The  grant  will,  as  such,  make  a  small  but  important  contribution  to \nmeeting  the  country\u2019s  financing  needs.  The  budget  support  committed  by  the  World  Bank  for \n2012 is of similar magnitude. The disbursements planned by the IMF in 2012 are slightly higher \nat 0.4% of GDP.  \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nSubprogram  2  maintains  the  implementation  arrangements  of  subprogram  1  for  the \n22. \npolicy-based  grant.  MOE  as  executing  agency  is  responsible  for  coordinating  the  program \nactivities. Implementing agencies are MOE; MOF; the Ministry of Justice; the Ministry of Youth, \nLabor and Employment; the NBKR; and the State Tax Service. The high-level program steering \ncommittee  and  working group  of  subprogram  1 has  been retained. The implementation  period \nfor subprogram 2 is January 2009 to December 2012. \n\n23. \nThe grant proceeds will be disbursed to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic as the \nrecipient  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements  for  Program  Loans. 19\n The  grant  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  cost \n                                                \n16  Notwithstanding, the government aims to draft an interim master plan for the transport sector by end-2012. \n17  A country\u2019s eligibility for Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants under the revised grant framework is determined \nby  its  risk  of  debt  distress.  The  latest  debt  sustainability  analysis  determined  that  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  had  a \nmoderate risk of debt distress and was therefore eligible to receive 50% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n\n18  An ex ante disaggregation of capital expenditure into individual sectors or projects is not possible because of the \nKyrgyz Republic\u2019s budget mechanism, which foresees the approval of a total amount of capital expenditure for the \ncoming fiscal year, which is detailed in the course of the year in line with incoming revenues. Capital spending is, \nas  such,  the  main  buffer  on  the  expenditure  side  of  the  budget.  Ex  post,  a  detailed  list  of  government-financed \ninvestment projects  in  2012  will  be  available.  In  2011,  education  and  road  transport  projects each  accounted  for \n31% of development spending from the central government budget, followed by 21% for urban services. \n\n19 ADB. 1998.

Indicative \noutputs  include  support  for  policy  reforms  and  capacity  building  for  (i)  business  regulation, \n(ii) access to finance, and (iii) PPP. MOE will be the executing agency. MOE and the NBKR will \nbe the main implementing agencies. The TA will be implemented from November 2012 to May \n2014.  The  TA  will  engage  13.0  person-months  of  international  and  52.0  person-months  of \nnational consulting services. Consultants will be engaged on an individual basis in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA \nis estimated to cost $700,000 equivalent, of which (i) $550,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV);  and  (ii)  $150,000  equivalent  will  be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Partnership  Fund, 20  and \nadministered  by  ADB.  The  government  will  provide  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff, \noffice accommodation, administrative support, and other in-kind contributions.21\n \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n25. \nThe  primary  beneficiaries  of  subprogram  2  are  the  investors  and  entrepreneurs  who \nbenefit  from  an  improved  legal  and  regulatory  environment.  Subprogram  2  has  also  indirectly \nbenefited  the  working  age  population,  as  investment  opportunities  translate  into  job  creation \nand/or  better  wages.  By  reducing  regulatory  costs,  subprogram  2  has  attracted  more \nbusinesses into the formal sector, thus increasing the number of formal jobs and, potentially, tax \nrevenues. The students of vocational schools and clients of financial service providers have also \nbenefited  from  subprogram  2.  Because  of  economies  of  agglomeration,  investment  and \nemployment  opportunities  are  expected  to  be  concentrated  in  urban  areas.  Nonetheless,  the \nrural  population  has  still  benefited  from  an  improved  business  climate  and  better  access  to \nfinancial services. \n\nSpecifically, about 5,100 new legal entities are registered in the Kyrgyz Republic every \n26. \nyear, of which more than 40% are in Bishkek. These firms benefit from subprogram 2 reforms, \nwhich reduced the time to register a business from 21 days in 2007 to 10 days in 2011.22 As a \nresult,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  now  ranks  17th  across  183  economies  on  the  ease  of  starting  a \nbusiness.  The  automated  business  registration,  established  under  subprogram  2  in  February \n2012, further reduces business registration to 3 days. In addition, foreign direct investors benefit \nfrom  the  accession  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  to  the  Hague  Apostille  Convention,  which  has \nremoved  the  requirement  to  provide  legalized  copies  of  constitutive  documents  of  their  home \ncountry.23\n \n\nIn 2008, there were 470 different business licenses and permits, which on average had \n27. \nto  be  renewed  every  23  months  for  SMEs  or  13  months  for  individual  entrepreneurs.\n The \nreduction  of  licenses  under  subprogram  2  has  significantly  reduced  the  regulatory  burden  for \nmost  enterprises  and  the  scope  for  corruption.  Similarly,  in  2008,  73%  of  individual \n                                                \n20 Contributor: the Government of Luxembourg. \n21 Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 World Bank. 2011.

Less  than  17%  of  inspections  resulted  in  sanctions.  The \nintroduction of risk-based inspections under subprogram 2 helps to better use scarce regulatory \nresources, reduce the burden faced by compliant businesses, and minimize corruption. \n\n28. \nOn  average,  firms  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  make  52  tax  payments  per  year  and  spend \n210 hours filing, preparing, and paying taxes. By introducing electronic filing of taxes, simplifying \ntax forms, and streamlining SME taxation, subprogram 2 has substantially reduced compliance \ncosts and scope for disputes through minimizing interaction with tax officials\u2014reducing potential \nmisconduct,  fraud,  and  corruption.  More  than  2,500  companies  have  already  benefited  from \nelectronic filing  of tax  reports; the  number  is  expected to  increase  substantially  in  the  medium \nterm. The simplified tax forms benefit all enterprises in the country, particularly SMEs. \n\nDocumentation  for  customs  clearance  requires  an  average  of  23  days  and  $210  for \n29. \nexports, and 25 days and $280 for imports.25 The automated system of pre-customs clearance \ndeveloped  under  subprogram  2  has  substantially  reduced  these  time  and  cost  requirements. \nAmong  the  first  beneficiaries  are  12  firms  included  in  a  pilot  test  in  June  2012.  Further \ninvestment  will  be  needed  to  make  the  automated  system  available  to  all  businesses  in  all \nregions.26\n \n\n30. \nAs a result of prior reforms in the area of secured lending and out-of-court arbitration of \ncommercial  disputes,  collateral  registration  increased  multifold  from  about  2,100  pledges  in \n2008  to  more  than  26,000  in  2010;  and  arbitration  is  widely  used  for  asset  foreclosure. \nHowever,  long  enforcement  periods  of  arbitral  awards  remain  a  serious  constraint.  The \naccelerated court enforcement of arbitral awards introduced under subprogram 2 should reduce \nthe enforcement period from 8 months in 2010 to about 4 months. Given that 75% of arbitration \ncases  involve  loan  transactions, the  change  should  substantially  reduce  costs  associated  with \nlending  and  foreclosure.  Direct  beneficiaries  will  be  financial  institutions  that  foreclose  assets. \nFurther, lower lending cost should, in turn, reduce the risk premium for loans in the form of high \ninterest rates and/or excessive collateral requirements, which equaled about 157% of the loan \namount  for  small  firms  and  98%  for  large  firms  in  2009.\n Potential  beneficiaries  are  all  non-\nprime borrowers. The reforms in support of credit information sharing will have the same effect. \n\n27\n\n31. \nFinancial leasing provides an alternative instrument of risk mitigation. The removal of tax \ndisadvantages  for  financial  leases  under  subprogram  2  will  increase  the  number  of  lease \ntransactions  (average  of  63  in  2006\u20132010)  by  at  least  50%  in  2012.  Leasing  will  particularly \nbenefit creditworthy women entrepreneurs, who frequently cannot offer collateral. For the same \nreason,  women  will  also  benefit  from  support  for  group  lending  under  subprogram  2.  Since \nwomen account for a majority of MFO clients, they will also benefit from the improvement of the \nfunding  base  of  MFOs  and  the  likely  reduction  in  interest  rates.  At  least  three  MFOs  are \nexpected to apply for a license for taking term-deposits in 2012.  \n\n32.  Worker skills training under subprogram 2 takes place in 25 primary vocational schools \nand covers 18 priority occupations, of which five are dominated by women. Direct beneficiaries \nare  the  teachers  trained  in  the  use  of  instructional  materials  and  the  training  participants.  In \nFebruary\u2013March  2012,  214  students  were  trained  in  a  pilot  occupation,  204  of  which  were \nwomen. Most students of vocational schools are currently unemployed and the training should \nincrease  their  chances  of  finding  employment.  Indirect  beneficiaries  will  be  businesses \n\n                                                \n25 The Kyrgyz Republic ranks 171st across 183 economies on the ease of trading across borders (footnote 22). \n26 ADB  is  considering  further  assistance  under  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  initiative  in \n\npromoting the single-window approach in external trade. \n\n27 World Bank. 2011.

More  than  2,400  SMEs, \n180,000 individual entrepreneurs, and 330,000 farms are active in these areas.  \n\n33. \nThe  PPP-related  reforms  under  subprogram  2  are  important milestones for  creating  an \nenabling  environment  for  PPP.  Seven  potential  PPP  projects  have  been  identified,  but  pre-\nfeasibility  studies  have  yet  to  be  undertaken  and  projects  tendered  and  implemented.  This  is \nwhy benefits from PPP projects will materialize under subprogram 3 at the earliest. \n\nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nBudget  planning  and  execution,  and  fiduciary  controls  have  been  assessed  through  a \n34. \npublic  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  assessment  undertaken  in  2009,28\n and  a  public \nfinancial  management  assessment  undertaken  in  2011\u20132012  to  feed  into  ADB\u2019s  new  country \npartnership strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n\n35. \n2010\u20132011 was a period of political volatility and change in the Kyrgyz Republic, which \ncreated additional challenges for public financial management, including high staff turnover and \nfrequent policy changes, but also great opportunities. Governance had substantially deteriorated \nin the years before the ouster of President Bakiev in April 2010. Since a provisional government \nwas  established,  important  positive  changes  included  introducing  management  information \nsystems,  automating  tax  and  custom  operations,  modernizing  treasury  operations,  and \ndecentralizing  some financial  management functions  to  local governments.  Subprogram  2  has \nmade an important contribution by supporting deregulation and automation. However, because \nof  social  unrest  and  economic  volatility,  the  predictability  of  revenues  and,  in  turn,  budget \nplanning  and  execution remained key  public financial  management  issues. The  new  President \nwas  elected  in  October  2011  and  inaugurated  in  December.  Subsequently,  a  new  coalition \ngovernment was elected by Parliament. A higher degree of political stability than in 2010\u20132011 \ncan be expected in the foreseeable future.   \n\nA key procurement constraint is the often nontransparent and discretionary application of \n36. \nthe  existing  legal  and  regulatory  framework.  The  government  has  been  establishing  a \nprocurement  database  in  MOF  to  address  this  issue  and  most  ministries  already  contribute. \nFurther, in February 2012, the government decided to prioritize e-procurement to limit the scope \nfor corruption  and requested  support from  development  partners  in  this area.29\n Audit functions \nare  in  place  throughout  government,  but  further  streamlining  of  audit  agency  roles  and \nresponsibilities  would  be  beneficial.  To  minimize  subjectivity  in  selecting  audit  targets,  the \ngovernment  is  working  with  development  partners  to  introduce  risk-based  criteria.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment and the executing agency for subprogram 2. \n\nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n37. \nSubprogram  2  is  expected  to support the government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  efforts  in the \nmedium-to-long  term  through  higher  and  sustainable  economic  growth  and  employment \ncreation.  This  will  mainly  result  from  better  access  to  financial  services  and  lower  regulatory \ncompliance  costs  for  enterprises  and  individual  entrepreneurs,  including  cost  related  to \ncorruption.  More  direct,  short-term  effects  include  the  increased  provision  of  microfinance \n(which  is  expected  to  help  the  poor)  and  the  development  of  leasing  (which  will  improve  the \n\n                                                \n28 Department for International Development, Ministry of Finance, Swiss Cooperation Office, and World Bank. 2009. \n\nKyrgyz Republic: Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment.

The  enhancement  of  workers\u2019 \nskills  and  consequent  increase  in  employment  opportunities  and  incomes  will  also  directly \ncontribute to poverty reduction. \n\nA recent survey indicates that firms in the Kyrgyz Republic  are more likely to have full-\n38. \ntime female workers and female participation in ownership than firms in most other countries in \nEastern Europe and Central Asia (footnote 27). However, stereotypes and patriarchal views of \nwomen\u2019s role in society continue to limit women\u2019s ability to develop businesses. Men are almost \nthree times more likely to engage in full-time entrepreneurial activities than women or to identify \nthemselves  as  self-employed.  Main  constraints  are  limited  access  to  affordable  financial \nservices,  limited  skills,  and  registration  systems  that  make  it  difficult  for  women  to  establish \nformal businesses. Moreover, data about women business ownership are limited, which makes \nit  difficult  to  design  targeted  support  policies.  Under  subprogram  2,  MFOs  will  be  able  to \nbroaden their services and reduce funding cost, which will disproportionally benefit women, who \naccount for 75% of MFO clients. Support for leasing and group lending under subprogram 2 will \nalso  benefit  creditworthy  women,  who  often  cannot  offer  collateral.  The  automated  business \nregistration  creates  sex-disaggregated  data  and  will  allow  monitoring  and  analysis  of  female \nbusiness  ownership.  Finally,  the  NPSDC  includes  representatives  from  two  organizations  that \nrepresent the interests of women entrepreneurs, so that the voice of women can be heard when \ndeciding  on  skills  development.

Simplified \nbusiness \nregistration  \n \n \n\nA.1.1  Simplify  legal  framework  and  procedures \nfor business registration of legal entities by:  \n\n(i)  reducing pre-registration requirements \n\nand  \n\n(ii)  acceding the Hague Convention \nAbolishing the Requirement of \nLegalization for Foreign Public \nDocuments (the Apostille Convention). \n\n \n \n\nThe new business registration law, enacted on \n20 February 2009, abolished (i) minimum \ncapital requirements, (ii) various post-\nregistration fees, and (iii) the requirement to \nopen a bank account before registration. This \nreduced the time to register a business from \n21 days in 2007 to 10 days in 2011. \nFurther, the Kyrgyz Republic acceded to the \nApostille Convention on 31 July 2011, \nfollowing harmonization of legislation. This has \nremoved the requirement for foreign investors \nto provide legalized documents of constitutive \ndocuments of their home country when \nestablishing a company in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic. An apostille is now sufficient for \nrecognition of foreign documents, which \nfacilitates foreign investments. \n\nThe one-stop-shop approach was launched in \n2008 using a paper-based system. In February \n2012, a new automated system was \nimplemented in the Ministry of Justice with \nADB support. The system allows electronic \nsubmission of documents to all government \nbodies involved in business registration, i.e. \nMinistry of Justice, State Tax Service, State \nStatistics Committee, and State Social Fund. It \ncan now be used by one-stop-shops in all \nseven regions of the Kyrgyz Republic and the \ncities of Bishkek and Osh. It also collects sex-\ndisaggregated statistics of the management of \nthe firm and of individual shareholders. The \nsystem reduces the time for registering a \nbusiness from 10 to 3 days.

Using regulatory impact \nassessments, the government has reduced \nthe number of licenses and permits by more \nthan 20% to 362, which clarified and \nstreamlined the scope of licensing regulation \nand reduced the burden of regulatory \ncompliance. The number of licenses was \nreduced to 347 through amendments to \nvarious laws, including the licensing law, which \nwere enacted by President on 11 October \n2012. .  \n\nAmendments to the Law on Inspections, \nenacted on 22 July 2011, have introduced the \nconcept of risk-based inspections, which \nprioritize those firms with higher risk of non-\ncompliance, instead of targeting all firms. \nGovernment resolution No. 108 dated 18 \nFebruary 2012 has established criteria for risk-\nbased supervision for specific entrepreneurial \nactivities. This new approach will help to make \nbetter use of scarce regulatory resources, \nreduce the burden faced by compliant \nbusinesses, and minimizes opportunities for \ncorruption. \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n \n\ni\n\n4\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2\n1\n\n \n\n \n\n\fPrincipal \nObjective \n(1) \n\nSubprogram 2 \n\nPolicy Action \n(2) \n\n3.

It became available to \ntaxpayers covered by the Large Taxpayers \nUnit, and three local tax offices (Bishkek, \nAlamedin, and Yssykata) in February 2010 \nwith the distribution of authorized electronic \nsignatures. To date, more than 2,500 legal \nentities submit their tax reports electronically, \nincluding 105 large taxpayers. \nTo comply with item (ii), the State Tax Service \nhas introduced one stop shops windows for \ntax-payers since 2010 with ADB assistance in \nthe local tax offices in Lenin district of Bishkek \nCity, Alamedin, Osh city, and the Large \nTaxpayers Office. This helps to reduce \ntransaction time and minimize interaction \nbetween taxpayers and tax officials, reducing \npotential misconduct, fraud, and corruption. \n\nState Tax Service has simplified ten tax \ndocuments\u2015nine tax returns and one \npayment contract\u2015 by Order No. 131 adopted \non 21 May 2010.

This will significantly reduce tax \ncompliance cost, since before the amendment, \ntax legislation required firms under the general \ntax regime to determine profits using \ndepreciation rates for equipment that differed \nfrom those required under Kyrgyz accounting \nstandards. Further, it will reduce the scope for \ndisputes between SMEs and tax officials, and, \nin turn, opportunity for unofficial payments. \n\nWith regard to item (i), following the \nestablishment of the State Enterprise on Pre-\nCustoms Single Window (SEPCSW) in 2009, \nthe Government approved resolution No. 390 \non 11 June 2012 to (a) harmonize eight \ndifferent documents required by various \ngovernment bodies prior to customs \nclearance, and (b) align the pre-customs \nclearing procedures with UN/CEFACT \nrecommendation for a single window.  \nFurther, to comply with item (ii), SEPCSW \nimplemented an electronic system with ADB \nsupport (under Grant 0121-KGZ) in May 2012. \nThe new system automates the exchange of \ndocuments and information between all \ngovernment bodies involved in pre-customs \nclearance and the submission of \ndocumentation to customs.

Increased \navailability of \nfinancial \nservices \n\nB.4.1 Take necessary measures to enable \nmicrofinance institutions to better serve their \nclients, most of which are females, by allowing \nthem to enhance the scope of their services to \ninclude agent banking, and foreign exchange \noperations.  \n\nSteps Taken to Achieve Policy Action \n\nwas treated as a deferred sale transaction and \nagain levied value-added tax. As such, it was \nmuch cheaper for customers to take a bank \nloan and import equipment directly, if they \ncould meet banks\u2019 collateral requirements, \nwhich women frequently cannot.   \n\nWith regard to item (i), under the guidance of \nNBKR, which aims to make adequate use of \nself-regulation in line with international good \npractices, the members of the only credit \ninformation bureau in Kyrgyz Republic, \nIshenim, including 20 out of 22 banks and all \nmajor MFOs, signed a code of conduct in \nSeptember 2011 that requires them to check \ncredit histories of loan applicants and report \ncredit events. Ishenim has established a \ncommittee to monitor compliance and sanction \nnon-compliance.  \nTo comply with item (ii), NBKR amended its \nresolution on credit risk management through \nresolution No 64/2 dated 16 November 2011 \nand revised its on-site supervision manual \nthrough attachment to the resolution on the \nCommittee for Supervision number 35/2 dated \n27 October 2011 to ensure that (a) financial \ninstitutions that reduce credit risks by \ncooperating with credit bureaus receive a \nhigher rating in NKBR\u2019s off-site supervision \nsystem and (b) cooperation is reviewed during \non-site inspections. \nNBKR adopted a comprehensive microfinance \ndevelopment strategy on 12 April 2012, \nincluding a time-bound action plan for \nbroadening the scope of services microfinance \ninstitutions can offer to their clients such as \nagent banking.

The amendments will allow \nmicrofinance organizations to broaden the \nscope of services beyond credit and leasing \nservices to agent banking and foreign \nexchange operations, which will improve the \naccess of their clients, 76% of which are \nwomen, to financial services. This will also \nhelp to reduce funding cost for MFOs by \nreducing cost related to swapping funds in \nforeign exchange into domestic currency \nthrough the banking system. Lower funding \ncost should help to reduce interest rates for \nborrowers. \n\nTo comply with item (i), NBKR approved \nResolution \u2116 40/7 on 27 July 2011 \u201cOn \nMaking Amendments and Revisions to \nResolution \u2116 5/7 dated 2 March 2006 on \nLicensing Bank Operations\u201d to establish \nrequirements and procedures to transform \nmicrofinance organizations into banks.  \n\n \n\nTo comply with item (ii), NBKR has approved \nResolution \u2116 18/8 on 25 April 2012 to allow \ngroup lending to be treated as secured lending \nfor purposes of prudential requirements of \nbanks.  This reduces capital cost associated \nwith group lending and, thereby, makes it \nmore attractive for banks. Group lending \nbenefits borrowers without collateral, who are \nfrequently women. \n\nB.4.2 Expand lending possibilities of \nmicrofinance institutions by \n\n(i)  establishing the process and \n\nrequirements for their transformation \ninto deposit-taking banks, \n\n(ii)  taking steps to enabling group lending to \nbe classified as secured lending for \nprudential requirements of banks. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nPrincipal \nObjective \n(1) \n\nSubprogram 2 \n\nPolicy Action \n(2) \n\nB.4.3 Streamline regulatory requirements for \nterm deposit taking to improve funding \navailability of microfinance institutions. \n\nOutput 3: Workers\u2019 Skills Enhanced \n1.
