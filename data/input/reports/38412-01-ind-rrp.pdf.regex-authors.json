I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to India for Assam Integrated Flood and Riverbank Erosion \nRisk Management Investment Program.  \n2.  The  investment  program  will  enhance  the  reliability  and  effectiveness  of  flood  and \nriverbank  erosion  risk  management  (FRERM)  in  Assam.  Following  a  stand-alone  project \nmodality, it will focus on three existing flood embankment systems (Dibrugarh, Kaziranga, and \nPalasbari) protecting key urban and productive rural areas along the Brahmaputra River. These \nareas are vulnerable to flooding because of infrastructure deterioration, riverbank erosion, and \nlimited involvement of local governments and stakeholders. A holistic risk management system \nwill be put into operation with the establishment of community disaster management committees \n(DMCs), a balanced combination of structural and nonstructural measures, and sustainability \nmechanisms for relevant infrastructure. International advanced practices will be introduced, \nincluding  innovative  and  cost-effective  approaches  for  riverbank  erosion  management  and \nprogressive knowledge development to cope with flooding and riverbank erosion. Resilience \nagainst the possible impacts of climate change will be strengthened, which may increase the \nfrequency and magnitude of water disasters in the region, thereby contributing to the efforts of \nclimate change adaptation. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Strategic  context.  Flooding  is  a  major  recurrent  natural  calamity  in  India,  causing \nannual damage of $450 million on average. High flood risk discourages private investments in \nproductive  activities,  and  is  thus  a  key  contributor  to  persistent  regional  and  rural\u2013urban \ndisparity. In many cases, the poorest segment of the society suffers the greatest risk and \ndamage. Vulnerability is particularly high in eastern and northeastern India where poverty is \nhigh. The Government of India is promoting state level sector reforms through its National Water \nPolicy  revised  in  2002,  advocating  comprehensive  structural  and  nonstructural  measures \nintegrated  with  improved  catchment  management  within  a  long-term  planning  framework. \nStrengthening resilience against flooding is a key element of the government\u2019s Climate Change \nAction Plan defined in 2009.1  \n4.  Assam is located in alluvial plains and adjacent low hilly terrain of Brahmaputra River \nbasin. It is one of the lowest income states in India. Despite recent acceleration of its economic \ngrowth, led by broad economic and fiscal reforms, the gap between the state and national \naverage income has been widening. Effective flood risk management remains high on the \nstate\u2019s development agenda, since a substantial majority of its urban and agriculture area is \nlocated in flood-prone areas, and suffers from devastating damages in high flood years. Yet the \ntask is quite challenging, given massive flood discharges of the Brahmaputra River and its \nhighly dynamic morphology, caused by extreme rainfall and fragile subsoil in its catchment, and \nheavy  sediment  transport.  Addressing  the  problems  calls  for  a  comprehensive  long-term \nperspective and a sound policy and planning framework, as advocated by the government.    \n5.  Assam  state  government,  through  the  Water  Resources  Department  (WRD),  has \nextended embankments and associated structures to protect about 50% of its flood-prone area. \nHowever, their effectiveness is constrained because of poor designs overlooking local drainage, \ninsufficient maintenance, failure caused by river erosion, and limited stakeholder participation. \n                                                \n1  Government of India. 2008. National Action Plan on Climate Change. New Delhi. ", "2 \nImproving the reliability of existing embankment systems with assured maintenance should be \ngiven high priority. Where feasible, riverbank protection needs to be provided systematically and \nadaptively in response to the dynamic morphology. Substantial opportunities exist to enhance \ncost-effectiveness and sustainability through new technologies, such as (i) use of sand-filled \ngeotextile  containers  as  revetment  materials  to  provide  protection  with  lower  cost,  higher \nreliability, and faster implementation;2 (ii) flow-retarding screens to induce silt deposition along \neroding bank lines as another low-cost option; and (iii) erosion-prediction modeling that can \nfacilitate advance planning and implementation of mitigation measures. Nonstructural measures \n(such as risk education, mapping and warning, and flood proofing) should also be introduced \nand  pursued  with  sound  knowledge  development  to  understand  complex  morphology  and \nfloodplain hydrology, and participatory mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability.  \n6.  Policy framework. The state government initiated economic reforms in the early 2000s \naimed at inclusive growth with stronger governance and public participation. A partnership with \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  was  established  in  strategic  sectors  including  fiscal \nmanagement, power, transport, and flood management. The state government has initiated \nreform steps including (i) establishing the state Water Resources Council (headed by the chief \nminister) and Board as sector apex bodies to guide the reform process; (ii) drafting a state water \npolicy with a view to setting up an integrated water resources management system; (iii) holistic \nFRERM as a prime element of the draft state water policy, setting out a sound strategy; and (iv) \nnotifying  the  National  Disaster  Management  Act  and  establishing  disaster  management \norganizations (DMOs) at state and local government levels. To establish and demonstrate \nholistic and sustainable FRERM in partnership with ADB, in January 2010 the state government \nset up Assam Integrated FRERM Agency (AIFRERMA), an autonomous body anchored to WRD \nwith a multidisciplinary structure, stable leadership, high level oversight, and timely fund flow. A \nroad map to consolidate effective operation of the AIFRERMA has been prepared, covering \nstrategic planning, improved infrastructure quality, and sustainable maintenance.3 \n7.  Multitranche financing facility investment plan. The central government and Assam \nstate government accorded high priority to extending effective FRERM systems in flood-prone \nareas in their Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2007\u20132012.4 This provided the basis for the investment \nprogram. However, in view of the absence of external assistance for the sector in the past and \nlimited staff experience, the initial engagement will take a focused approach on three selected \nand appraised subprojects with existing embankments protecting critical urban and productive \nrural areas. The subprojects cover 90 kilometers (7% of the total reach) of Brahmaputra River in \nthe state. Innovations and international best practices and lessons have been drawn, in terms of \n(i) knowledge development; (ii) more cost-effective, adaptive, and sustainable alternatives in \nstructural  and  nonstructural  instruments;  and  (iii)  holistic  program  delivery  with  improved \ngovernance, stakeholder participation, infrastructure quality control, integration with disaster \nmanagement and livelihood promotion programs, and accountability mechanisms in program \nmanagement.5 The subprojects form a concise investment plan for the investment program. \nWider replication is envisaged upon successful implementation and preparation of a long-term \nsector investment plan, and progressive strengthening of the institutional and knowledge bases.   \n8.  Rationale for ADB partnership and multitranche financing facility. The investment \nprogram is consistent with ADB\u2019s assistance strategy for India, which has extended its operation \nin  water  resources  and  rural  infrastructure  in  states  willing  to  pursue  sector  reforms  in \n                                                \n2  Boulders quarried from forests are conventionally used as revetment materials, which are becoming more costly.  \n3  The road map actions are in the Subsector Assessment (Summary): Flood Protection (Appendix 2).  \n4  Government  of  India,  Planning  Commission.  2008.  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan  2007-2012.  New  Delhi;  and \nGovernment of Assam. 2008. Eleventh Five-Year Plan 2007-2012. Guwahati.   \n5  Lessons learned and incorporated are shown in Lessons Learned (Appendix 2).   \n ", "3 \npartnership with ADB. Primarily focused on infrastructure and associated software for FRERM, \nwhich are also needed for climate change adaptation, it is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 20206 \nand Water for All Policy.7 From the perspective of the state, the investment program is needed \nas the first step toward statewide application of comprehensive FRERM over the longer term. \nThe state set up AIFRERMA envisaging long-term partnership with ADB. Although designed as \na project loan with three appraised subprojects, the MFF modality is most suitable because of \nthe longer implementation period needed to provide a range of FRERM structures step by step, \nwith strengthening of the state and local institutions and knowledge base, and verification of \ninnovative measures. The multitranche financing facility also provides better opportunities in \nterms of (i) higher implementation quality as a result of its structure to commit the future tranche \nbased on the performance of the ongoing tranche and the readiness of the new tranche, (ii) \nprogressive improvement of the project design incorporating lessons and findings, and (iii) \nprogress of incremental institutional reform actions that can be more strongly pursued during \ntranche processing with higher managerial attention. Longer-term sector involvement is also \nneeded to develop sound capacities of the institutions concerned.  \n9.  The investment program will institutionalize comprehensive risk management systems to \ncope with critical flooding and riverbank erosion in Assam. It will demonstrate the following: \n(i)  establishment of a sound planning framework of holistic FRERM as a basis for \nstrategic and systematic implementation of sector programs; \n(ii)  comprehensive structural and nonstructural measures, introducing cost-effective, \nsustainable,  and  innovative  riverbank  protection  adaptive  to  natural  river \nprocesses, and nonstructural measures applied in a limited scale in Assam; \n(iii)  focused  support  for  institutional  development,  including  (a)  knowledge  base, \n(b) autonomous  AIFRERMA  with  multidisciplinary  and  accountable \nimplementation  with  stable  leadership,  and  (c)  reforms  and  capacity \nstrengthening of the WRD; and \n(iv)  integration of disaster management and FRERM, with DMOs empowered to join \nimplementation process and the participation of women and vulnerable groups.   \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the investment program will be reduced economic vulnerability and social \ndisruption caused by flood and riverbank erosion in Assam. This will contribute to increased \neconomic growth and reduced poverty in the three priority subproject areas along 90 kilometers \nof the Brahmaputra River having vulnerable embankments protecting the livelihoods of 1 million \npeople in urban, suburban, and productive rural areas. Its outcome is enhanced effectiveness \nand reliability of the state\u2019s FRERM systems providing enhanced resilience.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The outputs of the investment program comprise (i) FRERM planning, institutional and \nknowledge bases; (ii) comprehensive FRERM systems in three subproject areas; and (iii) a \nmultidisciplinary project management system. The investment will be split into two projects: \n(i) project 1 (years 1\u20134) will provide immediately required investments in the three subproject \nareas8 while providing a basis for institutional outputs, and (ii) project 2 (years 4\u20137) will complete \nthe appraised investments with necessary refinement following the experience of project 1. The \noutputs for the investment program and project 1 are summarized in Table 1. \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2008.

Flood embankments will \nbe designed to provide protection against 100-year floods in urban areas and 25-year floods in \nrural areas in accordance with the intended design level of the existing structures.12 Ancillary \nfacilities  (such  as  sluice  gates)  will  be  provided  to  facilitate  optimal  water  management, \nincluding conservation of natural water bodies and drainage improvement. Riverbank protection \nwill  pursue  an  adaptive  approach  of  stabilizing  naturally  developed  bank  lines  through \nrevetments to minimize impacts on morphology. More cost-effective and sustainable innovations \nwill be applied, including the use of sand-filled geotextile containers, flow-retarding screens, and \nerosion-prediction modeling (para. 5). The effectiveness of geotextile containers and erosion-\nprediction modeling was demonstrated in an ADB-financed project in lower Brahmaputra in \nBangladesh, and reflected in the country\u2019s national guidelines for riverbank protection.13 The \ninvestment program will consolidate these innovations in Assam with performance monitoring \nand evaluation.14 Based on this, standardization and replication in other flood- and erosion-\nprone areas in Assam and in other parts of India can be explored. \nB.  Economic Impacts and Sustainability \n17.  Economic  returns.  In  the  three  subproject  areas  (Dibrugarh,  Kaziranga,  and \nPalasbari),15 primary benefits include (i) reduced flood hazards, (ii) reduced land loss associated \nwith river erosion, and (iii) reduced cost of flood relief and rehabilitation. Investor confidence is \nalso expected to increase, leading to enhanced investments in rural and urban production. The \nestimated economic internal rates of return for all subproject level interventions (of the entire life \nof the investment program) are 18%\u201320% for the three subprojects, and 17% for the overall \ninvestment program (including capacity development). Sensitivity analysis was carried out to \nassess  the  impacts  of  a  range  of  risks,  including  cost  overruns,  the  need  for  follow-on \nadaptation,16 implementation delay, and reduced incremental crop production. The analysis \nshowed that project returns are generally robust. The greatest risk appears to be the cost \noverrun, of which the switching value is 44% for the Kaziranga subproject.  \n18.  Sustainable maintenance and adaptation. To be effective, the FRERM infrastructure \nrequires maintenance and adaptation. The state government has responsibility for FRERM (as a \npublic  good)  through  budgetary  expenditures,  although  recovery  through  increased  land \nrevenues on urban and agriculture land is envisaged in the longer term.17 The investment \nprogram supports the sustainability of infrastructure through a multipronged approach, including \n(i) an infrastructure asset management information system to be established starting with the \nselected subprojects and eventually covering the entire state, as a basis of sound monitoring, \nplanning,  and  implementation  of  maintenance  and  adaptation;  (ii)  progressively  enhanced \n                                                \n12  A 100-year flood is an extremely destructive flood that has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year. A 25-year \nflood has a 4% chance of occurring in any given year. \n13 ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Jamuna-Meghna River Erosion Mitigation Project. Manila.  \n14 ADB also facilitated observation and consultation of experts from India (including Assam) and Bangladesh on the \napplication of these new technologies in the lower Brahmaputra (Jamuna) River in April 2010. \n15  Existing embankments in these areas were constructed in the 1950s\u20131960s but are facing the immediate risk of \nembankment breach induced by river erosion.  \n16  Adaptation is defined as providing additional works to cope with changes in morphological conditions. \n17 The state government is computerizing land records with the objective valuation method, supported by ADB in \npublic resource management sector.  \n ", "8 \nallocation of the annual maintenance budget toward the full requirement;18 (iii) improved and \ntransparent management of fund utilization, including disclosure to the district administration \nand DMOs concerned (including local DMCs) regarding fund allocation, procurement, and work \norders; (iv) mobilization of available state and central funding for routine maintenance, such as \nrural employment guarantee programs; (v) delegation of maintenance of minor infrastructure \nsuch as sluices and flood platforms to the DMCs concerned; and (vi) utilization of government \ncentral  flood  management  programs  for  major  maintenance  and  adaptation,  particularly  of \nriverbank protection structures requiring capital expenditures.19  \nC.  Governance \n19.  Good governance is essential for ensuring and sustaining the intended benefits. The \nWRD\u2019s  financial  management  system  was  assessed  and  the  investment  program  has \nincorporated  measures  for  ensuring  accountability  and  transparency,  pursuing  participatory \nmanagement  of  process  and  outputs  with  quality  control  mechanisms.20 Subprojects  are \nprepared by setting out clear input and output targets in their implementation plans. DMOs \n(including  DMCs)  are  empowered  to  participate  in  implementation,  such  as  endorsing \ncommunity-based  flood  risk  management  plans  and  periodic  work  plans.  Program \nexpenditures\u2014including  the  civil  work  scope,  quantity,  cost,  and  contractors\u2014will  be \nposted at the subproject sites, monitored by trained DMO members and consultant quality \nmonitors.  With  awareness  campaigns,  complaints  handling  officers  will  operate  grievance \nmechanisms. AIFRERMA will undertake annual financial audits of SIOs and the PMU through a \nchartered accounting firm, and establish an internal third-party technical audit mechanism via \nexternally engaged experts with the support of consultants. The specific institutional measures \nare shown in Schedule 3 of the FFA and the FAM (Appendix 2).  \n20.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the state government including AIFRERMA and the WRD. Policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM.21 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n21.  Some 32%\u201358% of the population in the three subproject areas falls below the poverty \nline\u2014most  of  these  people  live  on  less  than $2  a  day. The  investment  program, through \nreduced  flood  loss  and  incremental  food  production,  will  enhance  the  annual  average \nagricultural net income of farm laborers by 27%\u201351% (Rs1,400\u2013Rs2,400) and marginal farmers \nby 28%\u201341% (Rs4,900\u2013Rs5,900). The social development strategy will mainstream stakeholder \nparticipation in community DMCs, linking them with existing state government poverty reduction \nprograms  and  providing  them  with  support  prepared  under  the  investment  program.  The \ninvestment program has been classified \u201ceffective gender mainstreaming.\u201d In support of the \npolicy principles of the 11th Five-Year Plan for the economic and social empowerment of \nwomen, a gender action plan for the investment program has been defined, which will enhance \nthe role of women in project institutions (including 30% women\u2019s representation in DMCs); \nprovide at least 30% program benefits to women in accordance with the Assam Women Act, \n                                                \n18  Fund allocation was increased by 80% to $6 million over the 5 years up to FY2010, although this is only about 30% \nof the estimated requirement.  \n19 This is in line with the recommendation of the special task force formed after the major flood in eastern and \nnortheastern India, including Assam, in 2004.   \n20 The WRD operates a financial and accounting system in accordance with the state financial rules and under the \nsupervision of the Finance Department. Under the investment program, a specialized financial unit will be set up \nwithin the PMU in AIFRERMA with assignment of finance cadre staff who will be trained in accounting policies and \nprocedures, including ADB disbursement systems.     \n21 Facility Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n2005; and strengthen the capacity of AIFRERMA, the WRD, and other project organizations in \naddressing gender development issues in promoting integrated FRERM.  \nE.  Safeguards \n22.  Social  safeguards.  The  investment  program  has  been  classified  category  A  for \ninvoluntary resettlement and category B for indigenous peoples. While its structural measures \nprimarily  involve  the  renovation  of  existing flood  embankments,  strip  acquisition  of  land  is \nneeded in association with embankment retirement to cope with riverbank erosion, widening, \nand extension. The majority of acquired lands are located along the eroding bank line, which \nwould be lost without project works. Project 1 will require acquisition of no land in Dibrugarh \n(embankment widening on the existing right-of-way with squatters, affecting 310 households); \n20.6 hectares in Kaziranga (for inner secondary dyke, affecting 80 households); and 29.9 \nhectares in Palasbari subproject (for shifting, affecting 274 households). Full resettlement plans \nfor project 1 works of these subprojects were prepared and agreed. Indigenous peoples issues \nwere found insignificant for project 1, and any negative impact is addressed in the resettlement \nplans. For social safeguards issues for the subsequent project(s), a resettlement framework and \nindigenous peoples development framework have been prepared and agreed following central \nand state government laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n23.  Under the investment program, all affected persons are entitled to compensation for land \nacquired and lost assets at their replacement cost. They will also be assisted in improving, or at \nleast restoring, their pre-intervention income and livelihood standards, and productive capacity. \nPayment for acquired lands, structures, and other eligible benefits will be fully made prior to the \ncommencement of civil works contracts. In case of significant negative impacts on indigenous \npeoples, an indigenous peoples development plan or actions will be prepared to ensure equal \nsharing of benefits. The AIFRERMA PMU will supervise preparation and implementation of \nsocial  safeguards  plans  by  the  SIO  concerned,  with  the  support  of  consultants  and \nnongovernment organizations. The estimated cost is $7 million for the investment program.  \n24.  Environment. The overall negative environmental impacts are deemed insignificant. \nNevertheless, the investment program has been classified category A to provide the rigorous \nassessments of the project\u2019s implications on diverse riverine environment. Environmental impact \nassessments (EIAs) were carried out for the three subprojects, along with their summary EIA \n(SEIA).22 The EIAs cover the impacts of the entire investment program and will be updated prior \nto project 2 as necessary.23 The EIAs noted that the investment program will have overall \npositive impacts on the environment and is overwhelmingly supported by local stakeholders, \nincluding (i) increased security against flooding and riverbank erosion, protecting vital assets \nand enhancing production systems; (ii) an improved aquatic environment with the installment of \nsluice gates and optimal water management; and (iii) an improved disaster risk management \nsystem. Key potential negative impacts include (i) possible impacts on river hydrology and \nmorphology; (ii) impacts from future climate change, earthquakes, and upstream development \nworks; and (iii) construction-related impacts, including possible impacts on endangered species \nsuch as river dolphins, loss of trees, health hazards, and pollution from construction camps.  \n25.  Among these, no significant impacts are anticipated on hydrology and morphology, as \nthe project will renovate embankments that have existed since the 1950\u20131960s. Riverbank \nprotection will adopt revetments and siltation screens that will not intervene against the existing \nchannel flows. Systematic monitoring will be put in place and mitigation measures will be \n                                                \n22 The SEIA was circulated to ADB Board of Directors on 1 July 2009.  \n23 An environmental assessment and review framework has also been prepared and agreed for the preparation and \nimplementation of minor CBFRM measures.     \n ", "10 \nprovided in case unexpected effects are observed. Other impacts can be mitigated through \nconstruction site management and tree plantation programs. These were incorporated in the \nenvironmental management plan, which is estimated to cost $1.8 million. The AIFRERMA PMU \nand SIOs will be responsible for implementing the environmental management plan; they will \nengage environment experts and will be assisted by consultants. \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n26.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 6.24  The overall benefits \nof the investment program are expected to outweigh the potential costs from risks and are \ndetailed in the risk assessment and risk management plan.  \nTable 6: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLimited institutional capacities  (i) Prior establishment of AIFRERMA with qualified CEO and other staff, \n(ii) focused implementation of three subprojects, and (iii) capacity building \nsupport through separate TA and consultants. \nDelayed implementation  (i) Advance procurement and engagement of consultants and NGOs; (ii) \nadvance initiation of land acquisition and resettlement; and (iii) compliance with \nreadiness checklist, including PMU establishment and staffing. \nFlood and riverbank erosion  (i) Establishment of asset inventory and management information system, \nprotection infrastructure  (ii) enhanced fund allocation and improved management, (iii) linkage to centrally \nsustainability  funded and local government programs, and (iv) mobilization of local resources. \nAIFRERMA = Assam Integrated Flood and Riverbank Erosion Risk Management Agency, CEO = chief executive \nofficer, NGO = nongovernment organization, PMU = project management unit, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n27.  The government and the state government through AIFRERMA have assured ADB that \nimplementation of the investment program shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including \nthose  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting \nservices, and disbursement as described in detail in the FAM and loan documents. \n \n28.  The government and the state government through AIFRERMA have given ADB certain \nundertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in the FFA. Specific covenants agreed by the \ngovernment and the state government through AIFRERMA with respect to individual tranches \nunder the MFF are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement for the respective \ntranches.  \n \nV.
