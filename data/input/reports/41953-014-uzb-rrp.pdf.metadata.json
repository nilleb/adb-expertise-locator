Its penetration and financial intermediation function is poor, despite growth in recent \nyears.  Banking  accounted  for  only  35.3%  of  the  country\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in \nterms of assets in 2011, while total loans were only 20.1% of GDP and total deposits 31.1%\u2014\namong the lowest in the region. Lending to the private sector was also among the lowest in the \nregion.  In  2009,  the  ratio  of  domestic  credit  to  the  private  sector  relative  to  GDP  was  only \n14.6%.  While  various  measures  have  been  undertaken  to  strengthen  the  role  of  financial \nintermediation  in  the  economy,  further  reforms  are  needed  to  improve  the  operating  and \nregulatory environments and develop the private sector. \n \nIn  alignment  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  strategy  and  program, \n3. \n2006\u20132010  for  Uzbekistan  and  the  stated  objective  to  promote  private  sector  development \nthrough  improved  financial  intermediation,  in  2007  the  ADB  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment  undertook  a  review  of  private  commercial  banks  in Uzbekistan.1 After  discussions \nwith the Central and West Asia Department, two banks were identified for potential intervention. \nFollowing several rounds of due diligence, ADB decided to pursue the opportunity of making an \nequity investment in Ipak Yuli. \n \nIpak Yuli, a joint-stock commercial bank, was incorporated in Uzbekistan in 1990. It was \n4. \nre-registered as a new legal entity in June 2000 following its merger with JSCB Umar and JSCB \nNamangan.  Ipak  Yuli\u2019s  primary  business  comprises  retail,  commercial,  and  corporate  banking \nactivities;  securities  operations;  foreign  currency  operations;  money  transfers;  origination  of \nloans and guarantees; and taking of deposits. Regarded as one of the leading mid-sized private \nbanks in the country, with 10 branches and 62 express centers (branches with limited scope of \nservices)  throughout  the  country,  Ipak  Yuli\u2019s  market  share  (in  terms  of  assets)  has  grown \nsteadily, from 1.4% in 2006 to 2.3% in 2011. Supported by the doubling of its customer base to \n89,829 during this period, in 2011 Ipak Yuli ranked ninth in the market in terms of assets. \n \nB. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\nInitially,  Ipak  Yuli  was  primarily  oriented  toward  lending  to  corporate  clients;  however, \n5. \nthis strategy has evolved to include micro,  small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and \nretail  lending.  Today,  Ipak  Yuli  is  a  universal  bank  addressing  multiple  market  segments.  As \ndetailed in its development strategy for 2011\u20132016, Ipak Yuli seeks to strengthen its position in \nthe  market  by  providing  a  wider  spectrum  of  banking  products  and  services  that  cater  to  the \nneeds of its customers in each identified market segment.  \n \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program: Uzbekistan, 2006\u20132010. Manila. \n\n\f2  \n \n\n \n\nWhile  Ipak  Yuli  has  maintained  its  strong  corporate  client  base,  its  largest  target \n6. \ncustomer niche comprises rapidly growing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).2 These \nclients tend to view Ipak Yuli as a stable, reliable bank due to its regional presence, high-quality \nservices,  and  availability  of  lending  resources  for  private  businesses.  Priority  products  and \nservices  for  SMEs include working capital loans,  leasing  operations,  and  project  financing\u2014all \nof  which  help  support  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  SME  borrowers.  In  addition  to  SMEs, \nIpak Yuli has sought to support private entrepreneurship by targeting micro-lenders as a priority \narea, working with ADB and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  \n \n7. \nRetail  banking  is  among  Ipak  Yuli\u2019s  newest  and  most  underdeveloped  business  lines. \nIpak  Yuli  seeks  to  strengthen  its  retail  banking  portfolio  by  (i)  enhancing  product  offerings \n(consumer  loans,  plastic  cards,  money  transfers,  mortgages,  deposits);  (ii)  developing \npartnerships  and  corporate  sales  channels  with  companies  that  provide  services  to  retail \ncustomers; and (iii) augmenting the services provided by its call center to increase cross-selling. \nConsistent  with  its  stated  objectives,  Ipak  Yuli  has  plans  to  continue  the  expansion  of  its \ndistribution  network  operations  into the regions  over  the next  4  years  by opening  another four \nbranches  in  locations  with  high  demand  for  its  products  and  services.  Targeted  cities  include \nAndijan, Bukhara, Karshi, and Termez.  \n \nC. \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n1. \n\nOwnership \n\n8. \nAs  of  year-end  2011,  Ipak  Yuli  was  owned  by  740  corporate  entities  and  individuals, \nincluding  Uzbekinvest  (a  government-owned  insurance  company),  Zamon  Plus  Sarmoya  (an \ninvestment advisory company owned by Ipak Yuli shareholders), Alfa Invest (a private insurance \ncompany),  Kafolat  (a  government-owned  insurance  company),  and  Mebel  Invest  Group  (a \nfurniture company). Ipak Yuli\u2019s shares are listed on the Uzbekistan Stock Exchange, but there is \nno active secondary market for the shares.  \n \n\n2. \n\nManagement \n\nIpak  Yuli's  management  team  comprises  experienced  Uzbek  bankers..  Rustam \n\n9. \nRakhimbekov has been chairman of Ipak Yuli since 1998.    \n \n\n3. \n\nGovernance Structure \n\n10. \nIpak  Yuli  has  a  nine-member  council  (board  of  directors);  most  were  elected  by  the \ngeneral  shareholders'  meeting  in  mid-2011.  Most  of  the  council  members  have  professional \nqualifications and work experience in banking and  finance.  Although no  legislation  defines the \nindependence of council members, they cannot be Ipak Yuli employees, cannot have any labor \nrelations with the bank, and cannot be members of the management board. The council's main \nfunction is to supervise Ipak Yuli's compliance with its own internal policies and procedures. The \naudit committee and the recently formed risk management committee assist the council. \n \n11. \nIpak  Yuli  is  managed  through  various  levels  of  corporate  governance,  including  the \ngeneral  shareholders'  meeting,  the  council,  and  the  management  board.  The  council,  the \n\n                                                \n2   At the end of 2011, Ipak Yuli\u2019s SME loans represented over 62% of the total loan portfolio, microfinance accounted \n\nfor more than 12%, corporate loans 22%, and retail loans 4%.  \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\ninternal  audit  department  (which reports to  the council),  and the Revision  Commission3 (which \nreports to the general shareholders' meeting) supervise corporate governance. In addition, the \norganization and effectiveness of Ipak Yuli's corporate governance are evaluated as part of the \nannual CAMELS4 assessment conducted by the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU). Corporate \ngovernance is guided by internal policies, regulations, and procedures, reflecting the institution's \ncorporate goals, strategic objectives, values, and codes of conduct, as well as the processes for \ndecision-making at all levels of bank governance, with clear divisions of responsibility, authority, \nand accountability.5  \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n12. \nEarnings performance. Ipak Yuli's net income has grown steadily over the past 4 years \nfrom  SUM4.3  billion  in  2008  to  SUM6.3  billion  in  2009,  SUM8.1  billion  in  2010,  and \nSUM12.8 billion  in  2011,  driven  by  growth  in  interest  and  noninterest  income.  Net  interest \nincome rose by almost 88.0% in 2009, helped by the expansion of the loan portfolio, particularly \nof  high-yielding  microfinance  loans,  and  the  spike  in  the  net  interest  margin.  Although  interest \nincome continued to rise in 2010, with the narrowing of the net interest margin during the year, \nnet interest income decreased slightly. Despite this, the rise in noninterest income during 2010 \nmore than offset the decline in net interest income. Noninterest income rose by 67.8% in 2010, \nbolstered by the increase in fee income (related to charges for settlements and payments, cash \nwire transfers, and plastic cards), the net  gain on foreign exchange operations, and the rise in \ndividend income. In 2011, increases in net interest income related to loan portfolio growth and \nthe  widening  of  the  net  interest  margin,  and  noninterest  income  attributable  to  the  continued \nincrease in fee income, contributed to earnings growth.  \n \n13. \nIpak Yuli\u2019s return on average assets was fairly constant during 2008\u20132010, as the pace \nof growth in net income largely matched that of average assets. In 2011, with the growth in net \nincome outpacing that of average assets, the return on average assets increased to 2.21% from \n1.74% in 2010. The return on equity also increased, from 19.34% in 2010 to 22.32% in 2011. \n \n14. \nAsset  quality.  The  growth  of  Ipak  Yuli\u2019s  loan  portfolio  has  been  driven  over  the  last \nseveral  years  by  sharp  increases  in  the  retail,  microfinance,  and  SME  areas,  with  more \nmoderate increases in the corporate portfolio, a reflection of the bank\u2019s evolving strategy.  \n \n15. \nCapital adequacy. Ipak Yuli has more than quadrupled its capital base since 2007, with \ntotal  equity  rising  from  SUM13.7  billion  in  2007  to  SUM56.1 billion  in  2011.  The  bank \nstrengthened its capital position by issuing additional shares each successive year,6 as well as \ncontinuing  its  policy  of  dividend  capitalization.  In  terms  of  capital  adequacy,  Ipak  Yuli \ncomfortably meets the minimum statutory capital requirements prescribed by CBU and is within \nthe standards  of  the  Bank for International  Settlements (Basel  guidelines), with  a  tier  1 capital \nratio of 13.7% and total capital adequacy ratio of 14.5% in 2011.  \n \n\n                                                \n3   The  Revision  Commission\u2019s  responsibility  is  to  verify  the  reliability  of  the  bank\u2019s  financial  information,  using  the \n\nreports of the independent annual audit as well as the materials prepared by the internal audit. \n\n4  CAMELS is defined as capital adequacy, asset quality, management quality, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to \n\nmarket risk. \n\n5  Activities, rights, and responsibilities for the shareholders, the council, and the management board are reflected in \n\ndocuments such as the bank\u2019s charter and policies. \n\n6  Ipak  Yuli  issued  SUM2.6  billion  of  ordinary  shares  in  2008,  SUM7.0  billion  in  2009,  SUM6.0  billion  in  2010,  and \n\nSUM6.6 billion in 2011.  \n\n \n\n\f4  \n \n\n \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe proposed equity investment in  Ipak Yuli of up to $6 million  (in sum equivalent)  will \n16. \nbe  financed  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital  resources. 7  ADB  will  not  be  the  single  largest \nshareholder in Ipak Yuli. The investment will represent approximately 15% of issued capital.  \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Assumptions  \n\n17. \nIpak  Yuli's  management  projects  modest  growth  in  the  balance  sheet  in  the  short  and \nmedium term, in line with economic forecasts and its strategic preference for a measured pace \nof expansion.  \n \nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nExit Strategy \n\nADB will look to the stability and improvement in Ipak Yuli\u2019s operating performance over \n\n18. \nthe next several years before exiting the investment becomes a feasible option. \n \n\n2. \n\nReporting Arrangements \n\n19. \nIpak  Yuli  will  provide  ADB  with  financial  reports  at  predetermined regular  intervals  and \nas  requested.  ADB  will  review  these  reports  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  monitor  the  facility \naccordingly.  ADB  will  also  have  the  right  to  appoint  a  director  on  Ipak  Yuli\u2019s  council  (the \nequivalent of a board of directors). Ipak Yuli will be required to retain a reputable accounting firm \nacceptable to ADB to conduct annual audits of its financial statements under IFRS guidelines. \n \n20. \nIpak  Yuli  will  provide  ADB  with  technical  assistance  progress  reports  at  predetermined \nintervals and as requested, outlining the status of implementation. ADB will review these reports \non an ongoing basis and monitor the facility. Included in these reports will be an annual report \non its safeguards and social dimensions performance.  \n \nD. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n21. \n \n\n(i) \n\nJustification for the equity investment is based on the following considerations: \n\nSupporting  improvements  in  the  quality  of  the  banking  system.  As  a \nshareholder of Ipak Yuli and an active member on the council, ADB will help the \nbank  improve  its  operations,  particularly  in  the  areas  of  internal  controls, \ncorporate  governance,  risk  management,  credit  risk  management,  anti-money \nlaundering  and  anticorruption  measures,  and  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards.  This  support  will  be  augmented  by  the  provision  of  technical \nassistance (TA).  \nCatalyzing  foreign \ninstitutional \ninvestors  and  multilateral  organizations  have  been  hesitant  to  invest  in  Uzbek \nin  combination  with  the \nbanks.  ADB\u2019s  equity \n\ninvestments  in  Ipak  Yuli, \n\nin  Uzbekistan. \n\nInternational \n\ninvestment \n\n(ii) \n\n                                                \n7 ADB  will  complement  the  proposed  investment  with  technical  assistance  from  the  ongoing  ADB.  2010.

Manila.   \n\n\f \n\n \nE. \n\nInternational  Finance  Corporation\u2019s  equity  investment  in  JSCB  Hamkorbank, 8 \nwould  provide  a  significant  signaling  effect  to  foreign  investors  with  regard  to \npotential opportunities in the Uzbekistan banking system. \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n22. \nTo  strengthen  the  effectiveness  of  the  intervention,  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  TA  for  Capacity \nBuilding for Financial Institutions (Phase 2) will support areas to be determined in consultation \nwith Ipak Yuli.9 Topics that may be covered by the TA include governance and internal controls, \nrisk  management, credit  risk  management,  microcredit  and SME  financing,  environmental  and \nsocial  safeguards  (including  tracking  of  gender  benefits  and  the  implementation  of  a  gender \naction  plan),10 and  anti-money  laundering  and  anticorruption  measures.  TA  support  alongside \nthe equity investment will allow ADB to add substantially more value to  Ipak Yuli and increase \nADB's own eventual return. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n23. \nSupport  for  the  banking  sector.  The  banking  sector  in  Uzbekistan  faces  several \nchallenges, as it remains small and in a nascent stage of development, as revealed by  the low \nasset-to-GDP ratio of 35.5%, total loans-to-GDP ratio of 20.1%, and total deposit-to-GDP ratio \nof  31.1%.  Through  its  equity  investment,  ADB  will  provide  systemic  support  to  the  sector  at  a \ncritical  point  in  its  development,  strengthening  financial  intermediation  and  helping  to  promote \nconfidence in the banking system. The equity investment in Ipak Yuli will also lend key support \nto  the  sector  by  promoting  the  adoption  of  strengthened  operating  policies  and  procedures \nbased  on  international  best  practice  standards,  particularly  in  the  areas  of  corporate \ngovernance,  internal  controls,  risk  management,  credit  risk  management,  environmental  and \nsocial safeguards, and anti-money laundering/anti-corruption. \n \nPrivate  sector  development.  The  equity  investment  will  strengthen  Ipak  Yuli\u2019s  capital \n24. \nposition  and  in  doing  so,  underpin  the  expansion  of  its  operations.  Given  Ipak  Yuli\u2019s  niche \nmarket in private sector SME financing, this investment will contribute to the expansion of SMEs, \nan  underdeveloped  and  underserved  segment  of  the  Uzbekistan  economy.  The  equity \ninvestment  will  contribute  to  private  sector  development  by  helping  to  mobilize  liquidity  and \nchannel it toward the most productive investments through the extension of credit. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\nThe  equity  investment  will  support  Ipak  Yuli\u2019s  adoption  of  strengthened  operating \n25. \nprinciples  (i.e.,  corporate  governance, \ninternal  controls,  risk  management,  credit  risk \nmanagement,  safeguards  and  social  dimensions,  and  anti-money  laundering/anti-corruption) \nbased  on  international  best  practice  standards,  contributing  to  the  bank\u2019s  overall  performance \n\n                                                \n8  The International Finance Corporation made its equity investment in JSCB Hamkorbank in 2010. \n9  ADB. 2010.

Through such initiatives, ADB will continue to assist \nin channeling the region's savings into the most productive investments, as well as continue to \nbuild  the  capacity  of  financial  institutions  by  introducing  international  best  practices.  The \ninvestment  supports  institutional  and  sector  development  by  providing  capital  and  capacity \nbuilding for the financial sector.   \n \n28. \nThe  strategic  priorities  of  the  ADB  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS),  2006\u20132010  for \nUzbekistan  include  catalyzing  private  domestic  and  foreign  investment  through  ADB\u2019s  private \nsector  operations.11 The  CPS  notes  a  number  of  potential  transactions  from  the  private  sector \noperations side in the finance and infrastructure sectors. Indicative investments that ADB might \nconsider,  the  CPS  continues,  include  (i)  equity,  debt,  and/or  guarantee  financing  for \ninfrastructure  projects \ntransportation,  and \ntelecommunications; (ii) equity investments in one or more private local banks as well as loans \nin the form of tier 2 capital or designated credit lines; (iii) inclusion of commercial banks in ADB\u2019s \nTrade Finance Program; (iv) equity investments or provision of credit lines to leasing companies \nor  other  nonbank  financial  institutions;  (v)  credit  enhancement  for  securitization  of  mortgages \nand leases or other capital market transactions; and (vi) equity in investment funds.

The  Private  Sector \nDevelopment  Strategy  refers  specifically  to  ADB's  role  in  strengthening  the  financial  sector  in \nthe developing member countries. The strategy notes the critical importance of well-functioning \nfinancial systems for private sector development, which in turn underpins sustainable economic \ngrowth.  Many  developing  member  countries  need  to  strengthen  their  financial  institutions  and \ncreate diversified financial markets that can finance private-sector-led growth. \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n30. \nThe  investment  is  classified  under  category  FI  for  impacts  on  the  environment  as  it \ninvolves an equity investment in Ipak Yuli and some of the bank\u2019s portfolio (e.g., manufacturing) \nhave  potential  environmental  impacts  and  risks.  With  respect  to  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous peoples, the investment is classified under category FI (treated as C) because Ipak \nYuli\u2019s borrowers are not expected to acquire land using eminent domain law nor adversely affect \nthe  dignity,  human  rights,  livelihood  systems,  culture,  territories,  and  natural  or  cultural \nresources  of  indigenous  peoples.  Ipak  Yuli\u2019s  current  environmental  and  social  management \nsystem  (ESMS)  is  limited  to  ensuring  that  borrowers  follow  national  laws,  requirements,  and \nprocedures.  Ipak  Yuli  is  committed  to  enhancing  its  ESMS  by  (i)  applying  ADB\u2019s  prohibited \ninvestment  activities  list,  (ii)  adopting  its  own  environmental  and  social  safeguards  screening \nand categorization, (ii) refining its due diligence and project approval procedures, (iii) appointing \nresponsible staff with clear  duties  and  responsibilities  in  ensuring safeguards compliance,  and \n(iv)  establishing  safeguards  performance  monitoring  and  reporting  procedures.  Ipak  Yuli  has \ncommitted  to  establish  an  ESMS  as  part  of  its  overall  management  system  to  meet  national \nlaws and/or ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and other social requirements. An ESMS \nsatisfactory to ADB will be established before the equity investment is disbursed.18 Ipak Yuli has \nalso agreed to only consider funding environment category A subprojects after it has developed \nadequate technical capacity and established a proven track record in implementing an ESMS to \nthe satisfaction of ADB. \n \n31. \nThe investment is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming.

The \nplan  includes  benchmarks  (25%)  for  lending  to  microenterprises  owned  and/or  managed  by \nwomen,  the  development  of  a  gender  policy,  and  women-friendly  loan  products  and  other \nfinancial  services.  This  investment  will  supplement  the  gender  action  plan  by  expanding  it  to \ncover Ipak Yuli\u2019s SME lending operations. For its SME operations, Ipak Yuli commits to a step-\nby-step  increase  of  the  total  amount  of  financing  and  total  number  of  SME  loans  extended  to \nwomen by 10% each year within the next 5 years. To realize this target increase, Ipak Yuli will \nlook into developing women-friendly financial services and procedures for SMEs. To expand its \noutreach  to  women  and  to  support  its  gender  initiative,  Ipak  Yuli  will  consider  developing \nmarketing strategies that target women. It is also enhancing its automated information system to \ninclude  a  data  field  to  collect  sex-disaggregated  data  on  the  borrower  and  the  borrowers\u2019 \nemployees. Moreover. Ipak Yuli\u2019s ESMS will integrate the supplemental gender action plan and \ninclude arrangements to comply with national labor laws and ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy \nto  ensure  adherence  to  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards,  including  provisions \nprohibiting  any  discrimination  against  women  in  hiring  and  providing  equal  pay  for  equal  work \nfor men and women.20  \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\nIpak Yuli was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \n32. \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance.   \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\n33. \nThe  proposed  $6  million  (in  sum  equivalent)  equity  investment  in  Ipak  Yuli,  once \napproved  and  signed,  will  increase  ADB's  projected  nonsovereign  exposure  to  $9.4  billion  by \nMarch  2013.  Additionally,  the  proposed  transaction  will  increase  nonsovereign  exposure  to \nUzbekistan  to  $726  million  or  7.7%  of  the  total  nonsovereign  exposure,  and  increase \nnonsovereign  exposure  to  domestic  commercial  banks  to  $762  million.
