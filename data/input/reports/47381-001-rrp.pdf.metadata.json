Most of the rain falls during two \ndistinct  monsoons:  Maha  season  from  December  to  February  and  Yala  season  from  May  to \nSeptember.4 The  majority  falls  in  the  southwest  and  central  highlands,  called  the  wet  zone, \nduring both monsoons, with annual rainfall typically exceeding 5,000 millimeters. In comparison, \nthe  country\u2019s  lowlands  are  dry\u2014particularly  in  the  northern  dry  zone  region,  where  annual \nrainfall is less than 1,500 millimeters, and droughts occur regularly. About 6.2 million people live \nin the dry zone region, or about 30% of the total population. Their access to freshwater is only \n1,200 cubic meters (m3) per person per annum.5 This is less than half of the national average of \n2,600 m3 and below the stress threshold of 1,700 m3. Water scarcity in the region is expected to \ndeteriorate  because  of  increasing  demand  from  population  growth  and  a  reduction  in  rainfall \nfrom anticipated climate change. \n      \n4. \nOver  the  past  millennia,  local  communities  have  managed  this  water  stress  by \nconstructing many small cascade systems of reservoirs, transfer canals, and irrigation schemes. \nThese have been sufficient to provide supplementary irrigation for a single paddy crop only each \nyear,  and  limited  storage  for  drinking  water  supply.  In  many  places,  communities  rely  on \ngroundwater,  some  of  which  is  contaminated,  causing  high  incidences  of  chronic  kidney \ndisease.  Lack  of  year-round  access  to  water  resources  constrains  the  agricultural  and \ncommercial production of the region, suppressing social and economic development. Agriculture \ncontributes  19% to  the  local  economy  and  provides  livelihoods  to 70% of the rural  population. \nHowever, in 2012, average household incomes  in the northern dry zone were 10% lower than \nother regions.6 \n \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The northern dry zone region comprises mainly the North Central Province, North Western Province, and Eastern \n\nProvince.  \n\n3   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the Water  Resources \n\nDevelopment Program (TA 8633-SRI). \n\n4   These monsoon seasons are synonymous with the two cultivation seasons of Sri Lanka. \n5   This figure represents the annual per capita water endowment\u2014the notional volume of water available each year\u2014\n\nbased on the accessible and reliable freshwater. \n\n6  Government of Sri Lanka, Department of Census and Statistics. 2014. Household Income and Expenditure Survey \n\n\u2013 2012/13. Colombo. This excludes urban areas in the Western Province. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nIn the 1970s, under the MDP, the government initiated developments to  increase water \n5. \nwithin these cascade systems using large transfer canals and reservoirs. These initiatives used \navailable  water  resources  from  the  Mahaweli  River,  the  country\u2019s  largest  river,  which  starts  in \nthe wet zone and has abundant river flows exceeding the projected future water demand in its \nriver  basin.  Key  components  of  the  MDP  were  finished  by  the  mid-1980s,  but  program \ncompletion was halted as a result of resource constraints and prolonged conflict. Since then, the \ngovernment  has  updated  the  MDP,  taking  into  account  socioeconomic  changes  and  national \ndevelopment  priorities.  The  government\u2019s  latest  priorities  and  investment  road  map  for  the \nirrigation  and  water-based  natural  resources  management  subsectors  are  described  in  the \nPublic Investment Strategy, 2014\u20132016.7 These focus on nonphysical and physical investments \nto  ensure  availability  of  adequate  water  quantities.  Agricultural  production  from  irrigation \nsystems  will  be  increased  by  (i)  improving  water  management,  productivity,  and  system \nefficiencies  to  meet  rising  demands;  (ii)  minimizing  spatial  variations  in  water  availability  by \ndeveloping  trans-basin  diversions  to  transfer  available  water  to  dry  zone  areas;  and \n(iii) increasing  resilience  to  climate  change.  Providing  additional  and  clean  drinking  water \nsupplies to dry zone communities is also a key priority.  \n \n6. \nThese  priorities  will  be  addressed  by  completing  the  NCPCP,  which  comprises \noutstanding  MDP  components,  and  is  estimated  to  cost  $1.64  billion.  The  NCPCP  will  be \nimplemented  in  two  phases.  The  investment  program  will  finance  NCPCP  Phase  1,  which \nincludes (i) key upstream investments of the NCPCP that will transfer water from the Mahaweli \nRiver to existing reservoirs in the Central Province, North Central Province, and North Western \nProvince;  (ii) rehabilitation  of  an  existing  irrigation  system  located  in  the  lower  reach  of  the \nMahaweli River; and (iii) improved water management practices. The investment program also \nsupports  preparation  of  NCPCP  Phase  2,  which  will  develop  additional  transfer  canals  and \nreservoirs  to  allow  more  water  to  be  diverted  from  the  Mahaweli  River,  and  will  extend  the \nsystem  to  additional  existing  reservoirs  in  the  North  Central  Province.  The  NCPCP  and  other \nprograms  supported  by  the  government  and  development  partner  that  improve  associated \ncommand areas and drinking water systems will complement each other.  \n \n7. \nThe investment program will implement physical investments to address water scarcity, \nfood  security,  and  poverty  issues  in  beneficiary  areas  by  increasing  and  securing  perennial \naccess  to  water  for  irrigation  and  nonagricultural  users.  Irrigation  water  conveyed  by  the  new \ninfrastructure  will  service  existing  cultivated  lands  under  existing  major  and  minor  irrigation \nschemes,  to  increase  annual  cropping  intensities  and  minimize  drought  risk.  The  investment \nprogram also supports the government in addressing key nonphysical priorities, with a focus on \nimproving water management, system efficiencies, policy, and institutional arrangements.  \n \n8. \nThe  investment  program  is  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s  development  objectives  of \nimproving connectivity and service delivery to lagging regions. It also supports the government\u2019s \nsector  objectives  of  attaining  food  self-sufficiency  and  increasing  water  productivity,  and  is \naligned with the strategic and sector goals of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as articulated \nin ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 and its Midterm Review;8 and the Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 \nto  reduce  the  water  demand\u2013supply  gap  in  water-scarce  areas,  foster  integrated  water \nresources  management,  improve  water  governance  and  delivery  of  services,  and  improve \nresilience  to  climate  change.  The  sector  deviates  from  the  key  strategic  focus  of  the  current \n                                                \n7   Government  of  Sri  Lanka,  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Planning.  2013.

It  also  provides  for  a long-term  partnership \nbetween ADB and the government for policy dialogue and capacity development, and ensures \ncontinuity  in  combining  investments  in  physical  infrastructure  and  nonphysical  components  for \nintegrated  water  resources  management. 10  This  helps  the  investment  program  to  observe \nrecommendations  from  the  earlier  ADB-financed  Water  Resources  Management  Project  that \nwas  rated  unsuccessful  because  of  incomplete  implementation  of  sector  reforms. 11  The \npreconditions for use of the MFF\u2014a road map and strategy, policy framework, investment and \nfinancing plans, and reliable safeguard arrangements\u2014are all in place.12  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe investment program\u2019s impact will be improved agricultural production and sustained \n10. \neconomic growth in the North Central Province, Central Province, North Western Province, and \nEastern  Province.  Its  outcome  will  be  secured  access  to  water  resources  for  agricultural  and \ndrinking purposes in project areas.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \nThe outputs of the investment program will be (i) new and improved water conveyance \nand storage infrastructure constructed; (ii) systems for improving water resources management \nand  productivity  developed;  and  (iii) multidisciplinary \ninvestment  program  management \noperational.  Each tranche of  the  MFF finances  slices of  each output.  Output  1  will  include the \nfollowing three projects: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(b) the  Upper  Elahera  Canal \n\nThe Upper Elahera Canal Project comprises two components: (a) the 9 kilometer \n(km) Kalu Ganga\u2013Moragahakanda Transfer Canal, including an 8 km tunnel that \ntransfers water between the Kalu Ganga and Moragahakanda reservoirs that are \nunder  construction;  and \nthat  connects \nMoragahakanda  Reservoir  to  existing  reservoirs  (Huruluwewa,  Manankattiya, \nEruwewa, and Mahakanadarawa) via 82 km of canals (including a total of 28 km \nof tunnels), which supply existing irrigation and water supply schemes. \nThe  North  Western  Province  Canal  Project  will  construct  96  km  of  new  and \nupgraded canals, including a 940 meter (m) tunnel, and two new 25 m tall earth \ngravity dams, impounding the new Mahakithula and Mahakirula reservoirs. It will \ntransfer  water  from  the  Dambulu  Oya  River  and  the  existing  Nalanda  and \nWemedilla reservoirs to command existing irrigation and water supply reservoirs. \nThe  Minipe  Left  Bank  Canal  Rehabilitation  Project,  located  in  the  downstream \nreaches of the Mahaweli River, will (a) add upstream storage by heightening the \nheadwork\u2019s  weir  by  3.5 m; (b)  construct  new  intake gates  to the  left  bank  canal \nand emergency spill weirs to both left and right bank canals; and (c) rehabilitate \nthe  74  km  Minipe  Left  Bank  Canal  to  improve  conveyance  and  reliability  of \nservice to existing farmers.  \n\n                                                \n9  ADB. 2011.

Under  the  first  tranche,  the  study  on  improving  system  efficiencies  and  water \nproductivity  will  investigate inefficiencies  within the existing conveyance and irrigation  systems \nand  constraints  to  improving  water  productivity,  and  recommend  on-farm  and  system-wide \nimprovements.  Physical  recommendations  will  be  incorporated  into  civil  works  packages  for \nimplementation under subsequent tranches and potentially under NCPCP Phase 2. The second \nconsulting package, strengthening institutions with integrated water resources management, will \nrecommend  programs  for  modernizing  policy  and  governance  frameworks,  and  institutional \nstrengthening to improve national water resources planning and management, and operational \nand  maintenance  procedures.  Output  3  will  support  program  management  for  successful \ncompletion of the investment program. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n14. \nThe  cost  of  the  investment  program  is  estimated  at  $675  million  (Table  1).  The \ngovernment  has  requested  an  MFF  in  an  amount  up  to  $453  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  and  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund \n[ADF])  to  help  finance  part  of  the  investment  program.  The  MFF  will  consist  of  3  tranches, \nsubject to the government\u2019s submission of related periodic financing requests, execution of the \nrelated  loan  and  project  agreements  for  each  tranche,  and  fulfillment  of  terms  and  conditions \nand  undertakings  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing  agreement.13 Approval  for  the  second \ntranche is scheduled in 2017 and approval for the third tranche is scheduled in 2018. \n \n15. \nThe  MFF  combines  OCR  and  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  financing  up  to  the \naggregate  MFF  amount.  The  provision  of  any  ADF  resources  will  be  balanced  by  a \ncorresponding  reduction  in  available  OCR  financing  (and  vice  versa),  with  total  financing \nprovided under the MFF not to exceed the aggregate MFF total of $453 million equivalent. Any \nADF allocation will be subject to (i) the availability of ADF resources; (ii) Sri Lanka\u2019s access to \nsuch  resources  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Graduation  Policy14 and  the  requirements  of  ADF  donors; \nand (iii) the availability of such resources to Sri Lanka given ADB\u2019s policy on performance-based \nallocation of ADF resources.15 \n \nThe first tranche will be financed, in part, from a loan from ADB\u2019s OCR ($76 million) and \n16. \na loan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources ($74 million).16 The OCR loan will have a 26-year \nterm, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \n\n                                                \n13 Framework Financing Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 ADB. 2008.

All  aspects  of  the  detailed  feasibility  studies  were  examined  during  the  design \nprocess, including (i) confirming that the NCPCP water balance is sufficient in the long term and \nthat  the  projects  avoid  adverse  downstream  impacts  to  existing  users  and  the  environment; \n(ii) considering  a  range  of  technical  alternatives  and  their  technical  and  economic  viability; \n(iii) assessing  the  capital  and  operating  costs,  and  achievable  cost  savings;  (iv) reviewing  the \nrationale for the proposed design, specific components, and operational modes; (v) maximizing \nthe  beneficiary  areas  and  communities;  (vi) minimizing  adverse  environmental  and  social \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\nimpacts;  and  (vii) optimizing  timescales  for  project  implementation.  The  results  from  the \ntechnical  evaluations  are  detailed  in  (i) a  sector  analysis  and  assessment;  (ii) a  water  balance \nassessment;  (iii) a  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment;  (iv) individual  technical  review \nsummaries for the three  projects  and a  specific  geotechnical  design  assessment  of  the  tunnel \nand  dam  components;  (v) an  institutional  and  policy  assessment;  and  (vi) detailed  project \nconstruction cost estimates.  \n \n19. \nThe  investment  program  is  inherently  a  climate  change  adaptation  measure  because  it \nwill increase water storage and transfer water from wet to dry areas. However, the infrastructure \ndesigns include additional adaptation measures, such as provision for increased flows in canals \nand  cross-drainage  structures.  The  investment  program  also  includes  soft  components  for \nclimate resilience that will assist (i) irrigation managers to improve system water management; \n(ii)  farmers  to  increase  agriculture  water  productivity;  and  (iii)  the  government  to  improve  its \npolicies and institutions based on integrated water resources management principles. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n20. \nEconomic  and  financial  analyses  undertaken  for  the  investment  program  indicate  that \nthe NCPCP is economically viable and financially sustainable. Increased agricultural production \nis the most important quantifiable economic benefit, accounting for about 90% of total benefits. \nOther quantifiable benefits include increased provision of raw water for domestic, municipal, and \nindustrial  uses;  and  increased  hydropower  generation.  The  indirect  benefits  of  induced \neconomic  activities  and  investments  by  the  NCPCP\u2019s  upstream  water  infrastructure  were  not \nquantified, although expected to be significant. These include broader regional economic growth \nand  improved  food  and  political  security.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  at \n13.1%. The economic internal rate of return is sensitive to changes to the investment cost and \nlevel  of  project  benefits.  An  11%  increase  in  total  cost  or  decrease  in  benefits  reduces  the \neconomic internal rate of return to 12%, implying the need to monitor factors that may affect the \ncost and benefits.19 The government has committed to financing the operation and maintenance \ncosts  and  periodical  replacement  cost  of  the  investment  program  infrastructures  from  its  own \nresources;  these  will  not  exceed  2.3%  of  the  total  annual  budget  of  the  Ministry  of  Mahaweli \nDevelopment and Environment (MMDE) and the Department of Irrigation (DOI).20 \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\n21. \nFinancial  management  and  procurement  capacity  assessments  have  been  undertaken \nfor MMDE; the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL), an agency under MMDE; and the DOI \nunder the Ministry of Irrigation. MASL and DOI will be responsible for managing, operating, and \nmaintaining  the  infrastructure  after  its  commissioning.  The  total  annual  budget  allocation  for \nMMDE,  MASL,  and  DOI  is  over  $400  million  for  capital  works.  MMDE,  MASL,  and  DOI  are \nexperienced  in  implementing  large  hydropower  and  water  resources  development  initiatives. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  concludes  that  MMDE  has  sufficient  experience  and \ncapacity to manage the project funds as well as adequate fund flow, accounting, and budgeting \narrangements.  The  overall  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  and  procurement  risk  are \nboth  rated  substantial.  The  financial  management  and  procurement  arrangements  are \n\n                                                \n19 Although  farmers\u2019  incomes  are  expected  to  increase,  no  revenue  will  flow  directly  to  MMDE  or  the  Mahaweli \nAuthority of Sri Lanka (MASL) from the project. Accordingly, an assessment of the financial internal rate of return of \nthe  project  and  its  comparison  against  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  is  not  meaningful.  An  incremental \nrecurrent cost analysis was performed instead to ensure that adequate budget provisions can be made to operate \nand maintain project assets.  \n\n20 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nconsidered adequate. Improvements required are (i) commitment for adequate counterpart fund \nallocation;  (ii) preparing  a  detailed  procedural  manual,  and  training  in  ADB\u2019s  rules  and \nregulations  in  disbursement  and  procurement;  and  (iii) developing  5-year  corporate  plans.  A \ndetailed financial management action plan is in the facility administration manual (footnote 20). \n \n22. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the MMDE. The result of the financial management and procurement \ncapacity  assessment,  and  the  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the facility administration manual. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\nThe investment program will improve socioeconomic conditions in the northern dry zone. \n23. \nBy  providing  secured  and  increased  irrigation  water  supplies,  it  will  improve  the  livelihoods  of \nmore than 70% of investment program-affected beneficiaries who cultivate land with irregular and \nuncertain irrigation water supplies. Since most paddy lands are cultivated in both Maha and Yala \ncultivation  seasons,  the  rural  poor  who  depend  largely  on  occasional  agricultural  labor  for  their \nlivelihood, will benefit from more opportunities to improve their household incomes. By employing \nthe rural poor in construction activities, the investment program will help to reduce rural poverty in \nthe short term. The investment program will supply domestic water to about 358,000 people and \nthereby improve health conditions of people in beneficiary areas, where acute kidney diseases are \nprevalent.  It  will  benefit  men  and  women  alike.  The  investment  program  will  ensure  women\u2019s \nparticipation  in  consultation  processes  that  determine  compensation  entitlements,  and  income \ngeneration and improvement programs. During consultations held in investment program-affected \nareas,  most  respondents  stated  the  investment  program  will  improve  their  living  standards  and \nemployment opportunities.  \n \n24. \nContractors will be required to implement appropriate measures regarding the health and \nsafety of men and women who work at the construction sites. Contractors, in close coordination \nwith  the  program  management  unit,  will  conduct  awareness  programs  on  the  prevention  of \nsexually  transmitted  infections,  drug  use,  gender  issues,  and  core  labor  standards.  The \ninvestment  program  is  classified  as  general  intervention,  since  it  supports  poverty  reduction \nindirectly. Although tranches 1 and 2 will provide the same opportunities for women to work in the \nconstruction  activities  as  men,  they  are  classified  as  no  gender  elements  because  the  activities \nwill  be  limited  to  construction  of major  infrastructure for  conveying and  storing water. Tranche  3 \ncould  be  classified  as  some  gender  benefits,  since  investments  may  improve  secondary  and \ntertiary distribution systems with farmers\u2019 organizations.  \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\nInvoluntary resettlement. The first tranche is categorized B for involuntary resettlement \n25. \nimpacts. Land acquisition is required for only the North Western Province Canal Project, and a \nresettlement plan has been prepared. It will require 11.8 hectares of land from 128 households, \nwith 448 project-affected people. Of those, nine households with 27 project-affected people will \nbe  physically  displaced.  The  remaining  119 households  will  lose  2%\u20139%  of  their  lands.  All \nphysically  displaced  households  have  opted  for  self-relocation.  No  land  acquisition  is  required \nfor the Upper Elahera Canal Project or Minipe Left Bank Canal Rehabilitation Project under the \nfirst tranche. A resettlement framework for the investment program has been prepared to guide \nthe  formulation  of  resettlement  plans  for  all  tranches.  Subsequent  tranches  are  likely  to  be \ncategorized A for involuntary resettlement. Each tranche will implement comprehensive income \nrestoration and improvement programs for the project-affected people. The investment program \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\nwill  also  establish  a  project-level  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  resolve  problems  with \ncompensation  calculation  and  payment,  resettlement  assistance,  and  income  generation  and \nimprovement.  MMDE  has  adequate  capacity  to  implement  the  resettlement  plans,  as  it  has \nimplemented several resettlement programs under the MDP.  \n \n26. \nIndigenous  people. Research and field surveys undertaken during project preparation \nfound  that  no  indigenous  people communities  or  individuals  will  be  affected  by  the  investment \nprogram. Hence, all tranches are category C for indigenous peoples impacts.  \n \nEnvironment. All tranches of the investment program are categorized A for environment \n27. \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Individual  environmental \nassessments have been undertaken for the three projects. Environmental impact assessments \nfor  the  North  Western  Province  Canal  Project  and  the  Upper  Elahera  Canal  Project,  each \ncategorized  A,  and  an  initial  environmental  examination  for  the  Minipe  Left  Bank  Canal \nRehabilitation  Project  were  prepared.  Since  the  investment  program  is  time-sliced  and \nimplementation  of  all  three  projects  will  begin  under  the  first  tranche,  the  environmental \nassessments  cover  the  entire  investment  program.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework  has  also  been  developed  for  the  investment  program.  Stakeholders  have  been \nconsulted  and  will  continue  to  be  consulted  during  implementation  as  described  in  the \nstakeholder  communications  strategy.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  address  both  social \nand environmental issues will be established prior to project implementation. \n \n28. \nBased  on  the  findings  of  a  strategic  environment  assessment  undertaken  by  the \ngovernment for the updated MDP, the cumulative impacts on two key areas of biodiversity and \nhydrology were assessed for the investment program and the Kalu Ganga and Moragahakanda \nreservoirs  (associated  facilities  under  construction).21 For  these  combined  investments,  about \n11,600  hectares  of  natural  habitat  (moist  semi-evergreen,  dry  mixed  evergreen,  and  riverine \nforests and scrublands) will be impacted, but the projects under the investment program affect \nonly  about  1,100  hectares,  or  about  0.0005%  of  the  natural  habitat  available  in  Sri  Lanka. \nSeveral alternative options were considered in designing the canal routes to minimize adverse \nimpacts  to  communities,  biodiversity,  and  natural  resources.  The  final  routes  include  about \n36 km of tunnels, primarily to minimize impacts to forest and wildlife reserves.  Appropriate off-\nset  measures  have  also  been  included  in  the  investment  program,  such  as  compensatory \nplanting of degraded forest areas. The water balance study also demonstrates that downstream \nwater uses and environmental flows will not be impacted by the planned water diversions.   \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n\n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.22 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \ninvestment program are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInherent risks associated \nwith construction of dams \nand tunnels \n\nMitigating Measures \nComprehensive  ground  investigations  have  been  undertaken  during  the  design \nprocess. A tunnel boring machine will be used to construct the 26 km tunnel, which \nwill  help  expedite  implementation  and  minimize  construction  risks.  The  contracts \nfor tunnel construction may also include performance and penalty clauses.
