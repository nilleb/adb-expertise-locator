The program\u2019s design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDevelopment  problems.  Viet  Nam  has  evolved  from  one  of  the  world\u2019s  poorest \ncountries 25 years ago to a lower middle-income country with a per capita income of $2,109 in \n2015. Between 1990 and 2007, Viet Nam\u2019s average annual gross domestic product growth was \nover  7%,  while  from  2010  to  2015  it  averaged  5.9%.3 The  initial  heavy  reliance  on  export-led \ngrowth,  anchored  by  investment  in  basic  education,  yielded  the  necessary  skills  to  take \nadvantage of cheap labor to begin its transition to prosperity.  \n \n4. \nViet  Nam  now  faces  a  new  development  challenge\u2014low  competitiveness  and \nproductivity.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  global  competitiveness  index  has  remained  low:  ranging  from  64  in \n2006\u20132007 to 56 in 2015\u20132016.4 Levels of labor productivity in Viet Nam are low in comparison \nto  other  countries  in  the  region.  Productivity  in  Singapore  in  2013  was  nearly  15  times  that  of \nViet  Nam.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  productivity  was  only  one-fifth  that  of  Malaysia  and  two-fifths  that  of \nThailand.5 The  World  Bank\u2019s  Knowledge  Economy  Index  ranked  Viet  Nam  104th  out  of  144 \ncountries  on  preparedness  to  compete  in  the  knowledge  economy.6 To  sustain  growth  and \nincrease  competitiveness  and  productivity,  the  country  needs  to  transition  from  low-skilled, \nlabor-intensive  activities  to  those  generating  higher  value.  It  requires  highly  skilled  workers  to \nrealize the full benefits associated with rapidly growing investment.7 The government forecasts a \nneed for a large increase in the number of trained persons entering the workforce. However, the \npublic  school  system  in  its  present  form  is  unable  to  meet  the  country\u2019s  projected  needs  for \nskilled  labor,  and  thus  requires  a  major  reform.  The  government  particularly  emphasizes  the \n\n                                                 \n1   Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2009.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President to  the  Board  of  Directors: \nProposed Loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Secondary Education Sector Development Program. \nManila (Loans 2582 and 2583-VIE, approved on 25 November). The project was completed on 20 April 2016. \n\n2  The  ADB  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Second  Secondary  Education  Sector \n\n3  General  Statistics  Office  (GSO)  of  Vietnam.  http://www.gso.gov.vn/default.aspx?tabid=622&ItemID=14774 \n\nDevelopment Program.  \n\n(accessed 7 October 2016). \n\n4  The World Economic Forum. 2015. Global Competitiveness Report 2015\u20132016. Geneva. \n5  International Labour Organization. 2014. 2013 Labor Force Survey. Geneva.  \n6  World  Bank.  Knowledge  Economy  Index.  http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/KEI  (accessed  24  November  \n\n2014). \n\n7  GSO data showed that between 1988 and 2010, the number of foreign investment projects in Viet Nam rose from \n37 to 1,237, and foreign registered capital reached nearly $20 billion in 2010, up from only $735 million in 1990. \n\n\f2 \n\nneed for  reforming  secondary  education  (comprising  lower  secondary  education grades  6  to 9 \nand  upper  secondary  education  for  grades  10  to  12),  which  faces  the  twin  challenges  of \nproducing  graduates  who  can  immediately  enter  the  labor  market  and  preparing  those  who \ncontinue on a higher level of education.  \n \n5. \nBinding  constraints.  Three  major  constraints  impede  the  secondary  education \nsystem\u2019s  ability  to  produce  a  sufficient  number  of  highly  skilled  graduates:  (i)  high  academic \nachievement but low labor market relevance, (ii) inequitable access of disadvantaged groups to \nsecondary schooling, and (iii) weak secondary education management and governance.  \n\n \n6. \nHigh  academic  achievement  but  low  labor  market  relevance.  While  Vietnamese \nstudents  demonstrated  high  academic  performance  in  the  2012  Programme  of  International \nStudent  Assessment  (PISA),  the  current  system  of  secondary  education  does  not  equip \nstudents  with  the  competencies  needed  by  the  labor  market.8 The  instructional  method  in  Viet \nNam  is  still  didactic  and  discourages  creativity.  The  country  recognizes  the  value  of  student-\ncentered  teaching  methods,  but  only  selected  schools  have  introduced  it.  The  government \npromotes  science  and  technology  as  a  key  strategy  for  industrialization,  but  only  22%  of \nuniversity  students  majored  in  natural  sciences  in  the  SY2014/15,  far  fewer  than  students \nstudying  humanities  and  social  sciences  (about  37%).9 A  World  Bank  study  on  Vietnamese \nyouths\u2019  preparation  for  the  market  economy  found  that  general  education  in  Viet  Nam  has \ncontributed little to the development of cognitive skills that are critical for the workplace.10  \n \n7. \nInequitable  access  to  secondary  education.  In  2015,  about  10%  of  the  lower \nsecondary aged youth did not attend lower secondary school or equivalency programs provided \nthrough  continuing  education  centers.  Out-of-school  youths  are  mainly  girls,  ethnic  minorities, \nmigrants  from  rural  agricultural  areas  to  urban  or  peri-urban  poor  areas,  and  those  with \ndisabilities. While the enrollment rate for girls and ethnic minorities has improved, the youth from \ndomestic  migrant  families  and  disabled  youth  who  have  completed  primary  education  are \nmarginalized.11 A United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) survey shows that 65% of migrant \nyouth  do  not  attend  school.12 Migrant  youth  have limited  access to the financial  and  academic \nsupport required to return to school. Youth with disabilities have good access to primary school, \nbut  very  few  continue  to  secondary  education  due  to  a  lack  of  instructional  materials  and \nprofessionally  trained  special  education  teachers.  Parents  lack  the  understanding  that  many \ndisabled youth can improve their employability if they complete secondary education.  \n \n8. \nWeak  educational  governance  and  management.  Local  autonomy  for  management \ndecisions  has  been  a  long-standing  feature  in  Viet  Nam.  This  has  resulted  in  significant \ndifferences in performance across local governments, where there are critical gaps in access to \nand quality of education services.

For LSE, the NER for boys was 82.7% and for girls it was 85.2%, while at upper secondary education \nthe NER for boys was 58.8% and for girls it was 66.5%.  \n\n12 S.  Cameron.  2012.

The  government  and  development  partners  conduct  joint  public \nexpenditure  reviews  only for the  central government\u2014no  information  is available  on  education \nbudget  allocation  and  spending  at  the  district  and  school  levels.  The  national  achievement \nmonitoring (NAM) system for secondary education collects student learning outcomes data only \nfor three core subjects and one science subject every 3 years.13 NAM results are analyzed only \nby  province.  Vietnamese  teachers\u2019  working  conditions  have  never  been  assessed  relative  to \ninternational  standards.  Macro  data  on  learning  outcomes  and  the  limited  information  on \nteachers does not help school principals to address the individual needs of their schools. Less \nthan  20%  of  schools  have  been  accredited  due  to  lack  of  trained  external  evaluators.  The \nMinistry of Education and Training (MOET) provides management training to school principals, \nbut the training has not helped strengthen the schools\u2019 accountability mechanism.  \n \nGovernment  sector  strategy  and  reform  agenda.  The  government\u2019s  Education \n9. \nDevelopment  Strategy,  2011\u20132020  lays  out  the  direction  for  education  development.14 In  line \nwith the long-term education strategy, Resolution No. 29 and Resolution No. 44 consolidate key \neducation policy reforms for the medium term.15 These reforms are: (i) upgraded curriculum to \nmeet  learner  and  labor  market  needs,  (ii)  improved  competencies  in  science  and  technology, \n(iii)  new  teaching  methods  to  encourage  learners\u2019  creativity,  (iv)  decentralized  development  of \ntextbooks  and \n(vi)  better \n(v)  professional \nunderstanding  about  career  options  and  cognitive  skills  required  in  the  workplace,  (vii) \nenhanced  autonomy  of  schools,  (viii)  enhanced  support  for  disadvantaged  groups,  and  (ix) \nupgraded  school  infrastructure.  The  Socio-economic  Development  Strategy,  2011\u20132020,  sees \neducation  as  a  key  driver  for  poverty  reduction  and  expansion  of  access  to  social  services, \nincluding vocational training and health care. Reflecting the importance given to education and \nits reform agenda, the government has increased annual spending on education and training by \nabout  130%  from  2009  to  2013.  In  2013,  15.9%  of  the  government\u2019s  total  annual  expenditure \nwas allocated to education and training.  \n \nADB  experience  and  lessons.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  one  of  Viet \n10. \nNam\u2019s  leading  development  partners  in  secondary  education,  with  eight  loans  to  the  country \nsince  1996.  Of  five  completed  projects,  four  were  evaluated  as  successful  and  one  as  highly \nsuccessful.16 These  loans  have  helped  Viet  Nam  enhance  both  the  quality  of  and  access  to \nsecondary education. The net enrollment rate (NER) for lower secondary education (LSE) rose \nfrom about 70% in 2000 to 90% in SY2014/15. Teacher training has been upgraded and more \nthan 80% of schools have met the school standards. Three key lessons from past projects are \nreflected  in  the  design  of  the  SESDP  II:  (i)  secondary  education  should  promote  students\u2019 \nemployability, (ii) numerous international pedagogical practices piloted under past projects have \nbeen  consolidated  in  the  national  reform  strategies  and  future  development  assistance  is \nexpected  to  align  with  the  strategy  and  help  fill  resource  gaps,  and  (iii)  education  reforms  are \nmore sustained when schools are held accountable.

Major  achievements  included  (i)  the  development  of teacher  standards \nand teacher assessment, (ii) improved access of ethnic minority youth to secondary education \nthrough improvement of the LSE equivalency program, and (iii) strengthened learning outcome \nassessment  by  introducing  international  measurement  through  Vietnamese  students\u2019  first \nparticipation in PISA in 2012 and the national assessment through NAM.  \n\n \nFigure 1.

ADB  has  given  direct \nsupport to selected reforms that underpin SESDP II through a structured policy dialogue based \non  ADB\u2019s  long  engagement  in  secondary  education  (Figure  1).  Among  eight  policy  reforms \nunder  SESDP  II, four reforms  build  on  and  scale  up reforms  accomplished  under  the  SESDP, \n2009-2015,  and  another  4  reforms  are  identified  through  implementation  of  other  ADB-funded \nsecondary  education  projects.  Targeted  support  will  be  provided  under  SESDP  II  to  help \nunderserved groups access secondary education. The LSE equivalency program supported by \nSESDP, 2009-2015, certifies disadvantaged youth as lower secondary school graduates, which \nwill  help  improve  their  employability.  SESDP  II  supports  Viet  Nam\u2019s  continued  participation  in \nthe  PISA  2018  and  2021  and  first-time  participation  in  the  2018  Teaching  and  Learning \nInternational Survey (TALIS) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \n(OECD).  SESDP  II  will  also  seek  synergy  with  ADB\u2019s  support  for  the  Improving  Public \nExpenditure  Quality  Program,  which  will  help  improve  the  productivity  of  public  financial \nresource allocation. \n \nDevelopment  coordination.  Most  of  the  education  sector  development partners focus \n13. \non  primary  education.  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  are  the  major  contributors  to  the  ongoing \nsecondary education reforms. Among the education reforms of Resolution No. 29 and No. 44, \nthe  World  Bank  supports  curriculum  and  textbook  revision,  and  teacher  training,  while  ADB \n\n                                                \n17 ADB. 2016. Country Partnership Strategy: Viet Nam, 2016\u20132020. Manila.  \n\n\f5 \n\nsupports  the  remaining  reforms.  SESDPII  will  complement  the World  Bank-supported  projects \nand strengthen development coordination.  \n \n14. \nSector  development  program.  Lessons  from  SESDP,  2009-2015,  show  that  a \ncombination  of  a  policy-based  loan  (PBL)  and  a  project  loan  is  an  effective  instrument  for \nachieving long term development impact in the Viet Nam education sector. Therefore, a sector \ndevelopment  program  (SDP)  is  proposed  for  SESDP  II.  The  PBL  component  serves  two \npurposes.  First,  the  PBL  leverages  reforms  in  the  sector  and  lays  the  foundation  for  effective \nimplementation  of  the  project  loan.  Second,  the  PBL  reforms  have  created  budget  obligations \nand therefore the government intends to use the loan proceeds to supplement MOET\u2019s budget. \nThe PBL comprises one single-tranche loan covered by a medium-term results framework that \nreflects  a  long-term  engagement  between  ADB  and  the  government  on  secondary  education \nreforms. This will assist the government in creating strategic changes to develop the country\u2019s \nsecondary education to sustain the achievements of SESDP. The project loan supplements the \nsector  reforms  to  achieve  development  impact.  For  example  under  the  PBL,  the  government \nhas approved a new vocational orientation program. The project loan will help develop a tailor-\nmade vocational guidance model that is relevant to local labor market needs.  \n \n15. \nEconomic  impact  of  the  program.  The  three  combined  outputs  of  the  program \ncombined  are  expected  to  lead  to  (i)  an  increase  in  the  number  of  young  people  completing \nsecondary school resulting from improved access to upper secondary education, (ii) a reduction \nin the marginal unit cost of education due to efficiencies made through governance reforms, and \n(iii)  increased  lifetime  earnings  of  those  initially  disadvantaged  as  a  result  of  completing \nsecondary school (para. 24). \n \nB. \n \n16. \nThe  program\u2019s  impact  will  be  workforce  competitiveness,  social  equity,  and  lifelong \nlearning  opportunities  for  all  secondary  school  graduates  improved.  The  outcome  will  be \nlearning  outcomes  and  competitiveness  of  secondary  school  graduates  enhanced.  The  SDP \ncomprises a single tranche PBL with 20 policy actions completed between July 2014 and June \n2016 and a project investment loan.   \n \nC. \n \n17. \nOutput  1:  Quality  and  relevance  of  secondary  education  improved.  The  PBL  has \nsupported  the  government\u2019s  reform  of  the  secondary  schools  to  be  pedagogically  more \ninnovative  and  labor  market-responsive.  The  government  has  launched  model  resource \nsecondary  schools,  which  introduce  student-centered  teaching  methods  and  upgraded \ninstructional  materials.  Teacher  standards  developed  under  SESDP  have  been  revised  to \ncapture teacher competencies to implement the new curriculum. STEM education in specialized \nschools  has  been  upgraded  through  improved  teacher  training  and  materials.  The  vocational \norientation  program  at  secondary  schools  has  been  strengthened.  It  will  provide  students  with \nup-to-date knowledge  about  available  jobs  and qualifications.  Cognitive  skills that  are required \nto successfully enter the labor market will be enhanced through upgraded vocational guidance. \nThe  project  loan  will  support  (i)  materials  and  in-country  staff  training,  (ii)  a  revised  teacher \nassessment  system,  (iii)  an  upgraded  STEM  program  using  active  learning  methods,  (iv) \nequipment  for  the  model  resource  schools,  and  (v)  development  of  vocational  orientation \nprograms, which target local labor market needs and include private sector outreach programs. \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs  \n\n\f6 \n\nOutput  2:  Equity  of  access  to  secondary  education  enhanced.  The  PBL  has \n18. \nsupported  school  financing  reforms  to  meet  the  government\u2019s  long-term  policy  targets  of  95% \nLSE (NER). The government has issued new direction on school fee reduction, exemption, and \nsupport.  Youth  from  poor  migrant  families  are  one  of  the  major  beneficiaries  of  the  revised \nschool fee system. Several policy measures to increase access to secondary schools for youth \nwith  disabilities  have  been  taken.  MOET  has  upgraded  continuing  education  centers  to  better \nmeet the special needs of disabled youth. This has incentivized parents of disabled children to \nsend  them  to  secondary  schools.  The  project  loan  will  support  (i)  a  survey  on  the  education \nsituation of domestic migrant youth to develop an action plan to address critical impediments for \nthese  youths,  (ii)  instructional  materials  targeting  migrant  youth,  (iii)  training  for  education \nmanagers  and  school  principals  to  develop  strategies  to  expand  education  for  disadvantaged \nyouth, (iv) information sharing among local governments in regions where the domestic migrant \nissue  is  most  acute,  (v)  professional  development  for  teachers  focused  on  youth  with  special \nneeds, and (vi) provision of adaptive learning materials for disabled students. \n \n19. \nOutput  3:  Educational  governance  and  management  strengthened.  The  PBL  has \nsupported government policy to enhance the efficiency of decentralized education management \nthrough an improved financial allocation model and strengthened local decision-making. MOET \nhas adopted a three-phase approach: (i) evaluate progress in decentralization and redefine the \nrole and function of local education authorities; (ii) review annual financial plans to improve the \neffectiveness  of  resource  utilization;  and  (iii)  develop  a  mechanism  to  promote  autonomy  of \npublic institutions, including schools, and delegate more decision-making authority. The OECD \npolicy  recommendations  based  on  the  PISA  2015  have  been  adopted  in  the  new  curriculum, \ntextbooks,  and  teaching  methods.  The  project  loan  will  finance  both  PISA  and  TALIS \nparticipation.18 It will support the implementation and scaling up of the NAM in schools involved \nin  the  new  mechanism  for  school-based  decision-making.  Other  support  will  include  (i)  public \nexpenditure review at district and school levels, (ii) the accreditation of secondary schools, (iii) \nfees  for  PISA  and  TALIS  registration,  (iv)  equipment  for  the  TALIS  office,  and  (v)  school \naccreditor training.  \n \nD. \n \nOverall  program  financing.  The  program  is  estimated  to  cost  $107  million.  ADB  will \n20. \nprovide  a  PBL  of  SDR35,709,000.00  and  a  project  loan  of  SDR35,709,000.00.  Both  are  from \nthe  Asian  Development  Fund.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  funding  of  $7  million \nfrom its central budget.

In  2016,  the  government  will  borrow  $20.2  billion  to  cover  a \nbudget deficit of 5.0% of gross domestic product with a $4.9 billion to be mobilized from official \ndevelopment assistance to fill the financing gap. The proceeds of the PBL will help implement \nthe  reform  actions  facilitated  by  the  project  loan  nationwide  and  reflect  the  strength  of  the \ngovernment reform program as highlighted by the implementation costs. The PBL proceed will \nsupplement the MOET\u2019s budget to cover their reform programs.  \n \n22. \nProject  investment  plan.  The  government  has  requested  a  project  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR35,709,000.00  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help \nfinance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an \ninterest  rate  of  2.0%  per  annum  during  the grace  period  and  thereafter, and  such  other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft project loan agreement. The project loan will cover the base \ncosts  of  the  project  activities  including  staff  training,  equipment  provision,  research,  and \nconsulting  services,  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  interest  and  other  charges  during \nimplementation.

The  program  (policy  based  and  investment  project  components)  will  have \npositive  economy-wide  impacts.  The  program  impact  assessment  estimates  the  potential \nquantifiable net benefits of the program at $33.0 million, net present value (NPV) at 12%, under \nconservative  discounting  assumptions,  which  well  exceed  the  program\u2019s  costs.20 The  benefits \ncomprise  additional  lifetime  earnings  of  disadvantaged  groups  arising  from  completing \nsecondary  education.  The  program  assumes  net  enrolment  rate  (NER)  of  lower  secondary \neducation students will increase from 90% to 95% and upper secondary education will increase \nby 20 percentage points. The reforms will result in investment economic benefits, NPV at 12%, \nof $2.245 billion and will entail economic costs, NPV at 12%, of $1.978 billion arising from new \ncapital  and  recurrent  expenditures  arising  from  the  reforms.  The  program\u2019s  economic  internal \nrate of return is estimated at 14.7%.  The sensitivity analysis indicated the economic internal rate \nof return is sensitive to changes in costs and enrollment.  \n \n25. \nFinancial.  The  fiscal  impact  analysis  confirmed  that  the  government  has  adequate \nfinancial resources and will be able to fulfill all its financial obligations under the program as total \nprogram  costs  are  observed  to  be  significantly  less  than  0.1%  of  total  annual  government \nexpenditure.  The  financial  sustainability  analysis  showed  that  the  government,  as  the  borrower, \nhas  a  strong  capacity  to  cover  both  annual  operation  and  maintenance  costs  and  debt  service \nrequirements beyond the program implementation period as these are likewise significantly below \n0.1% as a portion of total government annual expenditure. \n \n\n                                                 \n20 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f9 \n\nGovernance \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nB. \n \n26. \nFinancial  management  assessment  and  procurement  capacity  assessment.  The \nfinancial  management  assessment  rates  the  financial  management  capacity  of  MOET  as \nsatisfactory  and  concludes  that  the  overall  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  low. \nMOET\u2019s departments of secondary education and planning and finance have been involved in \nnumerous successfully implemented ADB-funded projects.21 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  MOET.  The \nspecific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project \nadministration  manual.  The  procurement  capacity  of  the  MOET  and  the  central  program \nmanagement unit (CPMU) was assessed.22 The pre-mitigation procurement management risk is \ndeemed moderate. The risk assessment and risk management plan will mitigate risks through (i) \nadvance action for early recruitment of consulting services to build capacity in procurement and \ngood  governance,  (ii)  recruitment  of  qualified  CPMU  staff,  (iii)  development  of  a  financial \nmanagement manual, and (iv) CPMU staff training. Procurements were streamlined to promote \ncompetition and reduce governance risks associated with large numbers of small packages. \n \nC. \n \n27. \nThe  program\u2019s  second  output  particularly  addresses  domestic  migrants  and  youth  with \ndisabilities.  The  program  is  expected  to  increase enrollment  by  about  278,500  lower  secondary \nstudents  and  about  949,000  upper  secondary  students,  plus  another  2,000  youths  with  a \ndisability. The program has a gender equity theme and includes a gender analysis and gender \naction  plan  (GAP).23 The  GAP  will  ensure  that  (i)  equal  numbers  of  women  and  men  attend \nmajor  workshops  that  are gender-responsive, (ii)  program  materials  are gender-  ethnicity-  and \ndisability-sensitive, (iii) major surveys disaggregate data by sex and by ethnicity, (iv) training to \npromote STEM encourages more female students to study these subjects, (v) the action plan to \nimprove education access of domestic migrant youth includes gender- and ethnicity-responsive \nindicators, (vi) NAM development will include strategies to avoid gender and ethnicity bias, and \n(vii) GAP progress updates will be reported to ADB semiannually.   \n \nD. \n \n28. \nThe  program  does  not  include  any  civil  works.  The  program  is  categorized  C  for \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  indigenous  peoples,  and  the  environment  as  both  project  loan  and \nPBL  will  not  have  any  potential  impact  on  involuntary  resettlement,  indigenous  peoples,  and \nenvironment. \n \nE. \n \nThe overall benefits and impact are expected to outweigh the risks involved.
