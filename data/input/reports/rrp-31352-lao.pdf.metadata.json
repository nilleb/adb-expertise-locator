It  is \nformulated  as  a  sector  loan  project,  requiring  the  towns  to \ndemonstrate their commitment to the Project and the associated \nreforms,  thus  encouraging  a  demand-led approach. The Project \nblends  environmental  and  livelihood  improvements  with  reforms \nfor  establishing and developing decentralized urban governance \nin small towns. Physical investments that include improvements \nto roads, drainage, sanitation and solid waste management, and \nvillage  upgrading  are  combined  with  civic  awareness  programs \nand  inclusive  processes  to  obtain  maximum  and  sustainable \nbenefits from investments and to ensure effective targeting of the \npoor.  \n\nOver the last 6 years, the urban environment in the Lao PDR has \nimproved significantly with investments in Vientiane and the four \nsecondary towns. However, a focus on the largest urban centers \nconstrained  the  ability  of  the  urban  sector  to  realize  its  full \npotential  to  support  equitable  and  broad-based  development. \nSmall towns have not benefited from the investments. This fact \nhas  not  only  impoverished  the  small  towns\u2019  residents,  but  also \nundermined  the  developmental  roles  of  these  towns  as  (i) \nprovincial  and  district  centers;  (ii)  centers  of  marketing  and \nagricultural processing in the rural hinterland and economic links \nbetween rural, national, and international markets; and (iii) places \noffering  nonfarm  employment  to  the  rural  poor  who  are  mostly \nengaged  in  livelihoods  that  depend  on  natural  resources, \nthreatening the country\u2019s ecological sustainability. At this stage of \nurban  development  in  the  Lao  PDR,  when  Vientiane  and  the \nsecondary  towns  have  already  developed  as  national  and \nregional centers, the focus of development effort needs to shift to \nsmall  urban  centers  to  support  broad-based  development  and \nreduce poverty within both urban and rural communities. There is \na  need  to  improve  basic  infrastructure  and  services  to  attain  a \nreasonable  quality  of  life  for  the  towns\u2019  people.  Physical \ninvestments need to be combined with livelihood improvements. \nImprovements  should  follow  inclusive  processes  to  respond  to \ncommunity  needs  and  catalyze  the  resources  of  the  poor.  All \n\n\fiv\n\n \n\n  \nObjectives \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthese interventions must be supported by extending the reforms \nfor decentralized urban governance to the small towns.  \n\nThe  Project  aims  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  and  to  enhance \nproductivity in selected small urban centers that play or have the \npotential  to  play  an  important  role  as  market,  services,  and \nmanufacturing  centers  supporting  the  rural  hinterland.  The \nspecific  objectives  are  to  (i) improve the living conditions of the \nsmall towns\u2019 communities, especially the poor, by improving the \nurban  environment, \nto  essential  urban \nincreasing  access \ninfrastructure  and  services,  and  enhancing  livelihoods;  and  (ii) \nsupport the establishment and development of decentralized and \ndedicated institutional and management frameworks for effective, \nresponsive, and sustainable provision of urban infrastructure and \nservices  in  small  towns.  Improvements  in  these  towns  are \nexpected  to  have  spin-off  benefits  for  the  rural  population  and \neconomy that have symbiotic relationship with these towns. The \nproject  components  are  grouped  into  two:  part  A  -  urban \ninfrastructure  and  services \nimprovements  and  part  B  - \nimplementation support and capacity building. Part A includes (i) \ntownwide  infrastructure  and  amenities;  comprising  investments \nin  major  roads,  drainage,  public  markets,  and  bus  station \nenvironments;  (ii)  town  cleanliness/environmental  services,  i.e., \nimproving solid waste and sanitation management services; and \n(iii) village upgrading and livelihood promotion, combining village \ninfrastructure  and  services \nlivelihood \nenhancement,  and \nfollowing  a  demand-responsive  and \npartnership  approach  with  villages  playing  a  major  role  in  the \nprocess.  Part  B  provides  for  consulting  services  and  other \nnecessary  inputs  to  support  (i)  implementation  of  infrastructure \nand  services  under  part  A,  (ii)  civic  awareness  and  community \ndialogue  processes  to  maximize  the  benefits  from  physical \ninvestments and to  ensure sustainability of the project impacts, \nand (iii) establishment of and capacity building for decentralized \nurban-focused entities in the project towns.   \n\nimprovements  with \n\nThe project cost is estimated at $20.0 million equivalent, of which \n$9.7  million  is  the  foreign  currency  cost  and  $10.3  million \nequivalent is the local currency cost. \n\nAsian Development Bank \n\nSource \n\nGovernment  \n\nCommunity \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\n \n\n                                        ($ million) \nPercent \nTotal \nLocal \nCost \nCurrency \n\n9.7 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n9.7 \n\n6.3 \n\n3.8 \n\n0.2 \n\n16.0 \n\n3.8 \n\n0.2 \n\n80 \n\n19 \n\n1 \n\nTotal \n\n10.3 \n\n20.0 \n\n100 \n\n\f \n\nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \n\n \nRelending Terms \n\n \n\n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization  \n \nEstimated Completion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUntil July 2009 \n\n \n\n31 January 2009 \n\n \nImplementation Arrangements \n\nv\n\nA  loan  in  the  amount  of  SDR  12,123,000  ($16.0  million \nequivalent)  in  various  currencies  from  the  Asian  Development \nBank\u2019s  (ADB's)  Special  Funds  resources will be provided for a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an \ninterest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter. \n\nThe urban development administration authorities (UDAAs) in ten \nproject  towns  will  contribute  $1.6  million  to  the  project  cost \nthrough  subloans  from  the  Government  using  the  ADB  loan \nproceeds.  The  subloan  will  have  an  interest  rate  of  6.7%  per \nannum and a repayment period of 15 years following completion \nof  the  Project,  including  an  initial  grace  period  of  3  years.  The \nGovernment  and  UDAAs  will  enter \nloan \nagreements.  UDAA  financing  will  cover  the  cost  of  vehicle  and \nequipment  for  the  solid  waste  and  sanitation  management \nimprovements in small towns. \n\ninto  subsidiary \n\nThe  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project  will  be  the  Ministry  of \nCommunication, Transport, Posts, and Construction (MCTPC). A \nnational  project  steering  committee  to  be  chaired  by  the  vice \nminister of MCTPC and with representatives from the Ministry of \nFinance, the Committee for Planning and Cooperation, the Prime \nMinister's  office,  Bank  of  Lao  PDR,  UDAAs,  and  provincial \ngovernments  concerned  will  be  formed  to  oversee  the  Project. \nProvincial  project  facilitating  committees  will  also  be  formed  in \neach  town  to  support  UDAAs  in  their  endeavor  to  gradually \ntransform themselves into competent urban authorities.   \n\nA  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  will  be  established  in  the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Planning of MCTPC. Headed \nby  a  national  project  director,  the  PCU  will  be  responsible  for \noverall  execution  and  planning  of  project \nimplementation, \nprogramming,  budgeting,  and  financial planning and accounting. \nUDAAs  to  be  established  in  each  project  town  will  be  the \nImplementing Agencies (IAs) except for the livelihood promotion \nsubcomponent. Project implementation units (PIUs) to be located \nin  UDAAs  will  be  responsible \nfor  all  aspects  of  project \nimplementation, including subproject preparation, detailed design, \nprocurement  of  goods  and  services  under  all  local  competitive \nbidding  (LCB)  packages,  planning  and  implementing  the  village \nupgrading  component,  and  civic  awareness,  community \ndialogue,  and  partnering  activities.  For  the  livelihood  promotion \nsubcomponent,  suitably  qualified  microfinance  institutions  to  be \nidentified according to the agreed-upon criteria, will be the IA and \nwill  closely  coordinate  with  UDAAs,  especially  on  social \n\n\fvi\n\n \n\n \nProcurement  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \nConsulting Services  \n\n \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\nintermediation activities. Villages will play a major role in planning, \nimplementing,  and  operating  and  maintaining \nthe  village \nupgrading  subcomponent.  To  use  project  implementation  to \ntransfer  knowledge  and  skills  to  the  newly  established  UDAAs, \nthe  project  management  and  implementation  activities  will  as \nmuch as possible be delegated to PIUs where the majority of the \nconsultants  and  counterpart  staff  are  located,  and  with  PCU \nhaving  a  core  unit  with  mainly  coordinating  and  facilitating \nfunctions.   \n\nADB-financed  goods and works will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. International competitive \nbidding  (ICB)  procedures  will  be  used  for  major  civil  works \ncontracts  estimated  to  cost  over  $1.0  million  and  supply \ncontracts  valued  over    $500,000.  For  civil  works  contracts  not \nexceeding $1.0 million, LCB procedures will be used. For supply \ncontracts  valued  $500,000  or  lower,  international  shopping \nprocedures  will  be  followed.  The  PCU  will  handle  procurement \nthrough  ICB  and  international  shopping.  Procurement  through \nLCB will be initiated by UDAA, and be ratified by a bid evaluation \ncommittee to be chaired by UDAA and with representatives from \nprovincial and district offices. Through PCU, the documents will \nbe sent  to  ADB  for  review.  The  package  of  works  per  village  is \nrelatively  small  at  about  $30,000.  The  works  are  labor  intensive \nand  do  not  require  sophisticated  technologies.  Therefore,  for \nworks  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $10,000  and  where  the \ncapacity  of  the  community  to  undertake  the  works  is  adequate, \ncommunity participation in procurement will be applied.  \n\nto  ADB \n\n \nConsultants  will be selected and engaged in accordance \nwith  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \nfor  engaging  domestic \narrangements  satisfactory \nconsultants.  A  team  of  consultants  with  a  total  input  of  661 \nperson-months (77 international and 584 domestic) will assist the \nPCU  and  PIUs \nthree  major  areas:  (i)  overall  project \nmanagement and implementation; (ii)  implementing the program \nof  activities  for  civic  awareness,  community  dialogue  and \npartnering; and (iii) capacity building for UDAAs . \n\nin \n\nThe Project will benefit about 143,000 residents in small towns \nthrough  an  improved  urban environment that will have a direct \nimpact  on  the  health  and  living  conditions  of  the  towns\u2019 \ncommunities.  The  economy  will  benefit \nfrom  enhanced \nproductivity as a result of health improvements as well as from \nincreased  urban  efficiency  resulting  from  improved  roads, \ndrainage,  and  markets.  All  project  interventions  will  either \ndirectly or indirectly benefit the poor. About 43,000 urban poor or \n 30%  of the population will benefit from better roads that will \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nvii\n\nenhance  the  poor\u2019s  mobility  and  access  to  income-earning \nopportunities.  Drainage  improvements  will  have  a  profound \nimpact on the poor, most of whom live on low-lying flood-prone \nland.  Improved  solid  waste  management  and  sanitation  will \nreduce the frequency of illness among the urban poor. About 60 \nvillages  with  higher  levels  of  poverty  will  benefit  from  village \nupgrading,  providing  70,000  residents  with  access  roads, \nfootpaths,  and  better  drainage.  Microfinance  services  in  the \nlivelihood  promotion  subcomponent  will  benefit  an  estimated \n8,500  urban  poor.  Moreover,  an  estimated  127,000  rural  poor \nwill indirectly benefit from improved (i) road conditions allowing \nbetter access to urban markets and marketing knowledge and \n(ii)  environment  in  small  towns  with  which  the  rural  poor  has \nsymbiotic relationships.  \n \nMajor  potential  risks  include  those  related  to  (i)  reforms  for \ndecentralized  urban  governance,  (ii)  sustainability  of  urban \ninfrastructure  and  services  in  small  towns  in  general  and \nproject  facilities  in  particular,  and  (iii)  community attitudes. To \nmitigate  these  risks  the  Project  has  devised  a  strategy  which \ninvolves (i) an urban policy and reform agenda and associated \nassurances  agreed  to  by  the  Government  as  safeguards  for \nmitigating  risks  for  reforms;  (ii)  a  capacity  building component \ndevoted  to  help  UDAAs  in  developing  their  technical  and \nfinancial capacities and the cost recovery measures to sustain \nthe infrastructure and services created; (iii) specific measures \nof the sector lending approach requiring the towns\u2019 commitment \nto  UDAA  reforms  before  inclusion  in  the  Project;  and  (iv)  an \nextensive program of civic awareness and community dialogue, \nwhich  will  motivate  the  communities  to  participate  in  and \ncontribute to improvements. \n\n\f \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  for  the  Small  Towns  Development  Sector \nProject.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  Lao  PDR  is  essentially  a  rural  country  with  about  18%  of  the  total  population  (0.85 \nmillion) living in urban areas. However, since the mid 1980s, as a result of economic liberalization \nand expanded commercial and industrial opportunities in urban areas, growing numbers of rural \npeople have been drawn to the urban areas in search of better livelihoods. Although the economy \nis still largely rural, the role of the urban sector is growing. During 1997 to 2001, the industry and \nservices sector components of the gross domestic product increased at average annual rates of 8 \nand  6.2%,  compared  with  5.3%  for  agriculture,  implying  the  higher  productivity  and  greater \nopportunities  in  urban  areas.  Vientiane,  the  capital  city,  is  the  largest  urban  center  with  a \npopulation of about 200,000. The four largest provincial capitals are called secondary towns, with \npopulations of 20,000 to 60,000. An emerging category of urban settlements is the small  towns2 \nwith  populations  ranging  from  5,000  to  20,000  and  annual  growth  rates  of  up  to  4.3%.  These \ntowns  perform  critical  administrative  functions  as  provincial  and  district  capitals,  and  are  the \neconomic links between the rural areas and the national and international markets. They are the \ncenters  of  immediate  markets,  transport  depots,  and  agricultural  processing  in  the  rural \nhinterland.  Large  numbers3  of  rural  people  commute  daily  to  the  towns  to  exchange  their  rural \nproduce with urban goods and services. The towns offer the rural poor labor markets during off-\nfarm seasons. The nonfarm employment in the towns presents a viable alternative for the country \nwhere ecological sustainability is threatened by livelihoods4 dependent on natural resources.  \n \n3. \nOver the last 6 years, the urban environment in the Lao PDR has improved significantly \nwith  investments  in  Vientiane  and  the  four  largest  secondary  towns.  However,  a  focus  on  the \nlargest  urban  centers  compromised  the  ability  of  the  urban  sector  to  realize  its  full  potential  to \nsupport  equitable  and  broad-based  development.  The  quality  of  life  and  urban  productivity  in \nsmall  towns  and  the  potential  developmental  role  that  small  towns  can  play  in  their  rural \nhinterland  are  constrained  by  the  grossly  inadequate  urban  infrastructure  and  services  that  are \nthe focus of this Project. The project framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n4. \nThe  towns  vary  widely  in  the  quality  and  coverage  of  urban  infrastructure  and  services. \nNone  has  a  central  or  partial  sewerage  system,  and  existing  on-site sanitation systems are in \npoor condition because there are no septic waste collection or treatment systems. The absence \nof interconnected drainage networks results in frequent flooding after rainstorms. The percentage \nof  lined  primary  and  secondary  drainage  networks  varies  from  0  to  40%.  Water  in  the  roadside \ndrains  is  contaminated  with  fecal  matter  from  on-site  sanitation  systems.  Drainage,  where  it \nexists,  becomes  blocked  with  silt  washed  from  the  unpaved  roads  during  the  rainy  season. \nGenerally,  only  the  main  roads  are  surfaced,  but  they  are  often  in  bad  condition.  Other  roads, \ngenerally  gravel  or  earth,  are  invariably  dusty  during  dry  season  and  muddy  in  rainy  periods. \n                                                 \n1   The project preparatory technical assistance was approved in August 2000. ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to \n\nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Small Towns Development Project. Manila. \n\n \n\n2   There are about 23 towns in this category. However, the distinction between small towns and secondary towns are \n\nnot clear-cut as some of them have equal administrative importance and higher potential for future growth. \n3   About 1000 to 1500 people from the surrounding and adjacent rural districts visit these towns on a daily basis.   \n4   The Government goals are to stop poppy cultivation by 2005 and shifting cultivation by 2010.  \n\n\f 2\n\nMaintenance  for  urban  roads  and  drainage  is  irregular  and  lacks  necessary  funding  and  clear \narrangements.  Solid  waste  management  services  are  inadequate  with  no  regular  collection. \nExcept one town, Xam Neua, the coverage of solid waste collection is no more than 12%.  None \nof  the  towns  have  a  sanitary  or  controlled solid waste disposal site.  Town  markets,  where  the \neconomic  activity  revolves  around  and  where  the  poor  can  sell  their  produce  and  offer  their \nservices  as  porters  and  cleaners,  are  in  poor  hygienic  conditions,  lacking  ventilation,  lighting, \nsurfacing,  sanitation,  and  parking  areas.  The  health  and  productivity  of  the  population  in  these \nsmall urban centers are constantly undermined by poor environmental conditions.   \n \n  \nTertiary infrastructure at the urban village level is also inadequate with a directly adverse \n5. \nimpact  on  the  quality  of  life  of  the  village  communities,  especially  the  poor.  Access  is  generally \npoor  characterized  by  earthen  and  undrained  pavements  that  become  quagmires  in  the  wet \nseason. The conditions are worse in the poorer villages. While there are no large aggregate poor \ncommunities  in  these  towns,  poverty  is  dispersed  throughout  the  urban  villages,  with  some \nvillages accommodating much larger populations of the poor than others. Frequently, a few poor \nfamilies  huddle  behind  the  homes  of  wealthier  villagers.  The  poor  live  on  undeveloped  plots \nwithout street frontage or proper access roads. The plots are often poorly drained and prone to \nflooding. Conditions are unhygienic, water- and feces-borne diseases are prevalent, undermining \nthe health and income-earning ability of the poor. The situation is aggravated by the fact that the \ncommunities  generally  are  not  aware  of  the  links  between  health  and  environmental  conditions. \nLack  of  access  to  basic  infrastructure  and  services  in  small  towns  is  both  a  cause  and \nconsequence  of  poverty.  The  level  of  urban  infrastructure  and  services  in  small  towns  and  the \ninvestment requirements are presented in Appendix 2. \n \nPoverty incidence5 in small towns varies from 18 to 43% in line with the regional variations \n6. \nin poverty incidence in the Lao PDR. The majority of the towns are in the Northern region where \nthe poverty incidence is highest. As a result, poverty incidence in the project towns is estimated at \n30%.  A  poverty  assessment  conducted  as  part  of  the  feasibility  study  suggests  that  the most \ncommonly  expressed  cause  of  poverty  is  lack  of  a  permanent  occupation,  and  consequently,  a \nlow and irregular income. In most cases, physical and social exclusion act together, resulting in a \nperpetual  poverty  cycle  of  poor  access  to  basic  infrastructure  and  services,  poor  health,  low \nproductivity, and low incomes of the poor. The poorest of the poor6 depend on markets as their \nmain  source  of  income,  where  they  sell  vegetables  and  forest  products,  or  offer  their  labor  as \nporters  and  cleaners.  The  vast  majority  of  the  middle-  and  upper-poor  groups7  are  engaged  in \nmarket  vending,  home-based  micro-enterprise,  and  small  retail  activities.  Existing  and  potential \nmicroentrepreneurs, however, are constrained by lack of access to institutional microfinance and \nassociated services. Small loans needed by these groups are not available through the existing \nbanking  system.  Most  households  report  finance  as  a  major  start-up  problem  in  establishing  a \nlivelihood.  \n   \ninvariably \n7. \nexacerbate the poor living conditions and the poor state of infrastructure and services. Currently, \nurban planning and provision of infrastructure and services in these towns are the responsibility of \nthe  provincial  and  district  departments  of  the  Ministry  of  Communication,  Transport,  Posts,  and \nConstruction  (MCTPC).  These  departments,  with  limited  staff  and  resources  and  widespread \nresponsibility for both urban and rural areas within their respective provinces and districts, cannot \ncope with the diverse demands of these rapidly growing and densely populated towns that require \n                                                 \n5  This  is  based  on  the  equivalent  income  needed  to  purchase  2,100  calories  per  person  per  day  plus  some \nexpenditure  for  non-food  items;  ADB  Participatory  Poverty  Assessment,  Lao  PDR,  2001.  The  poverty  assessment \nused a comprehensive definition involving quality of life poverty indicators resulting in much lower rates of poverty. \n\nframeworks  and  management  capacities \n\ninstitutional \n\ninadequate \n\nThe \n\n6  The poorest of the poor has an income of less than $21 per household per month. \n  \n7   These groups\u2019 incomes vary between $22 and $62 per household per month.  \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\ndedicated  management.  The  departments  rely  on  the  central  Government  to  provide  and \nmaintain  infrastructure.  There  is  little  relationship  between  budget  requirements  and  allocations \nactually  received.  There  is  no  separate  budget  for  maintaining  urban  infrastructure,  and \nmaintenance is severely underfunded. The degree of cost recovery is minimal, with user charges \nin  most  towns  being  confined  to  solid  waste  collection.  In  the  absence  of  separate  accounts \nmaintained for these services, it is not possible to establish a relationship between the revenues \nand cost of services. The situation is exacerbated by the predominantly rural background of small \ntowns communities who are not accustomed to the benefits of urban services for which they are \nreluctant to pay. The sector analysis is presented in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nThe  inadequate  infrastructure  and  services  and  poor  environmental  conditions  in  small \ntowns  stem  from  the  fact  that  until  recently,  small  towns  had  the  lowest  priority  in  the  country\u2019s \ndevelopment agenda and have benefited least from public investments. The Government is now \nkeen on equitable growth and is concerned with the complementary and supportive role of small \ntowns  in  broad-based  local  development.  The  Fifth  Five-Year  Socioeconomic  Plan  (2001-2005) \nprioritizes  planning  and  developing  basic  infrastructure  and  services  in  urban  areas,  including \nsmall  towns.  The  poverty  reduction  partnership  agreement,  signed  in  September  2001  by  ADB \nand the Government, includes small towns development as one of the key operational priorities to \nenhance reciprocal linkages between urban and rural areas, more specifically, (i) integrating rural \nproducers  with  urban  markets,  (ii)  enabling  urban  entrepreneurs  to  trade  with  rural  people,  and \n(iii) facilitating access of the rural and urban population to international markets. The Government \nrecognizes  that  this  vision  requires  interventions  to  meet  basic  human  needs  and  stimulate  the \neconomy  in  small  towns.  The  Government\u2019s  urban  sector  investment  plan  indicates  that  about \n$97 million is required to meet the investment needs in the next 10 years in the urban areas. This \nfigure includes about $44 million for the needs of all the small towns including further investment \nneeds  of  the  project  towns.  The  capital  investment  program  is  ambitious  and  suggests  that the \ninvestment projects need to be prioritized for the optimum use of scarce available resources. The \nlikely sources of financing for urban sector investment needs are given in Appendix 2.    \n \n9. \nThe incidence of poverty in small towns results from lack of programs that could address \nthe  multidimensional  nature  of  poverty.  The  limited  funds  in  the  context  of  large-scale major \ninfrastructure needs have, so far, not reached the village level where the impact of investments \ncould directly be felt  by the communities. While the lack of funds is a constraint on improvement \nprograms,  a  major  problem  is  lack  of  effective  strategies  that  could  spark  the  initiatives  of  the \npoor  and  mobilize  the  resources  of  village  communities  in  improving  their  environment.  The \nrecent  Government  policy  to  assign  to  the  villages  a  greater  role  in  development  provides  an \nimmense  opportunity  to  promote  new  approaches  whereby  village  communities  can  become \nactive  partners  in  the  development  process  of  their  own  villages.  However,  improving  basic \ninfrastructure and services alone will not suffice to make a sustainable impact on the lives of the \npoor.  The  poverty  assessment  report  clearly  highlights  the  linkage  between  poor  environmental \nconditions  and  low  incomes.  It  is  essential that environmental improvements in small towns be \ncomplemented  with  interventions  to  enhance  livelihoods  and  thus  sustain  the  improved  living \nconditions of the poor.  \n \n10. \nThe  poor  living  conditions,  inadequate  infrastructure  and  services,  and  insufficient \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  also  arise  from  the  current  forms  of  centralized  urban \nmanagement  and  limited  institutional  capacities.  The  current  institutional  framework  is  not \nconducive  to  delivering  services  efficiently  and  mobilizing  local  revenues.  Recognizing  the \nlimitations  of  centralized  urban  management  in  an  increasingly  urbanizing  society,  the \nGovernment  launched  a  program  of  decentralization  in  1995.  Since  then,  the  Government  has \n\n\f 4\n\ncreated  urban  development  administration  authorities  (UDAAs)  in  Vientiane  and  the  four  major \nsecondary towns and envisages eventually transforming these authorities into autonomous urban \nlocal governments. With a number of prime ministerial (PM) decrees, decisions, and instructions, \nthese  authorities  were  recognized  as  legal  entities  with  exclusive  responsibility  for  planning, \nmanaging, and providing infrastructure and services in urban areas. More importantly, they were \nempowered  to  raise  local  revenues  from  a  range  of  sources  to  increasingly  meet  their \nexpenditure  for  the  urban  functions.  In  its  Fifth  Five-Year  Plan,  the  Government  reconfirms  its \ncommitment  to  the  gradual  development  of  municipal  administrations  in  urban  areas  and \nacknowledges the need to extend the decentralization reforms to the small towns.      \n \n11. \nThe  review  of  past  UDAA  reforms  suggests  the  need  for  further  concerted  efforts  to \nmaintain  the  momentum  for  reforms.  The  comprehensive  nature  of  the  decentralization  reforms \nrequires  technical,  financial,  and  legal  interventions  by  a  number  of  agencies  at  various  levels. \nAlthough  the  PM  decrees  provide,  in  the  interim,  the  required  legal  basis  for  UDAA  operations, \nthe  issue  of  lack  of  an  encompassing  and  permanent  legal  framework  for  urban  local \ngovernments  needs  to  be  resolved  in  the  medium  term  by  enacting  the  local  administration  bill \nbeing discussed within the Government. A review of the decentralization process also shows that \nthe  Government  commitments  made  through  a  number  of  PM  decrees  and  decisions  have  not \nalways  been  simultaneously  supported  by  other  concerned  agencies.  While  the  financial  and \ntechnical  progress  of  the  Vientiane  UDAA  (VUDAA)  was  relatively  promising,  the  progress  of \nUDAAs in some secondary towns has been constrained, in some cases, by inadequate support \nfrom provincial governments or, in other cases, failure of the concerned line ministries to actually \ntransfer the assets, staff, and revenue collection function to UDAAs.  The future urban policy and \ninstitutional reform agenda should take into account the past experience and build on the reforms \nevolving over the last 6 years in the Lao PDR. Further reforms, which have formed the content of \nthe  policy  dialogue  pursued  during  preparation  of  the  Project,  include  (i)  issuing  PM  decrees  to \nestablish, in small urban centers, UDAAs with mandate to plan and provide urban infrastructure \nand  services;  (ii)  empowering  UDAAs  to  have  their  own  budget  and  raise  local  revenues  by \nlevying and collecting service charges and fees similar to those being implemented in Vientiane; \nand (iii) supporting capacity building for UDAAs to perform initially as project implementing units \nand to gradually become competent urban entities. \n \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  the  Lao  PDR  is  targeted  at  reducing  poverty  through \n12. \nsustainable  economic  growth,  inclusive  social  development,  and  good  governance.  Operational \npriorities  include  strengthening  rural  and  urban  market  linkages,  sustainable  environmental \nmanagement, human resource development, private sector participation, and regional integration. \nUrban  and  small  towns  development,  whereby  (i)  rural  producers  integrate  with  domestic  and \ninternational markets, and (ii) demand on rural natural resources is relieved, is regarded as one of \nthe priority sectors of the country strategy. ADB has been the major development partner in the \nurban  sector  with  five  loans  for  water  supply  projects  amounting  to  $56  million  in  and  outside \nVientiane and three loans8 targeting urban environmental improvements in Vientiane and the four \nsecondary towns. Along with infrastructure investments, the creation of a legal, institutional, and \nfinancial  framework  for  decentralized  urban  governance  has  been  a  major  thrust  of  ADB\u2019s \nassistance.  ADB  projects  pioneered  the  creation  of  UDAAs  in  Vientiane  and  the  four  major \nsecondary  towns.  Local  resource  mobilization  reforms  have  been  an  integral  element  of  UDAA \nreforms  to  create  sustainable  sources  of  income  for  UDAAs  to  enable  them  to  perform  their \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 1995.

Appendix  3  lists  external \nassistance to the sector from ADB and other development partners. \n \n13. \nExperience  with  earlier  ADB  assistance  suggests  that  institutional  reforms  require  the \nconcerted efforts of all involved parties, and takes a period of time longer than what is envisaged. \nReforms need to be supported by extensive and long-term capacity building. The role of UDAAs \nhas to be clearly understood by provincial and district authorities, which must be involved in the \nprocess. Delayed establishment of UDAAs and their inadequate involvement, from the outset in \nthe secondary towns development project have meant that opportunity to transfer knowledge and \nskills  to  UDAAs  through  the  project  has  been  limited.  Project-specific  lessons  show  that \ncentralized  project  implementation  has  limitations  in  providing  the  towns  with  a  sense  of \nownership and ensuring sustainability of investments. The experience also reveals the need for a \ndemand-responsive approach, requiring the towns\u2019 commitment to the Project, and incorporating \nparticipatory processes to better target the needs of the poor, maximize sustained benefits from \nthe  improvements,  and  solicit  community  support  for  the  project  and  UDAA  reforms.  Lessons \nlearned from earlier ADB assistance are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n14. \nAt  this  stage  of  urban  development  in  the  Lao  PDR,  with  Vientiane  and  the  secondary \ntowns having already developed as national and regional centers, the focus of development effort \nneeds to shift to small towns to optimally utilize existing urban potentials to support broad-based \ndevelopment and reduce poverty in the urban and rural communities. There is need to improve \ninfrastructure and services in these towns to attain a reasonable quality of life for the residents, \nespecially  the  poor.  Investments  in  infrastructure  need  to  be  combined  with  efforts  to  improve \nlivelihoods  through  pro-poor  microfinance  whereby  the  poor  and  micro  enterprises in the towns \ncan  be  served  on  a  sustainable  basis.  Improvements  should  follow  inclusive  processes  to \nrespond  to  the  community  demands  and  catalyze  the  resources  of  urban  residents.  All  these \ninterventions  need  to  be  supported  by  developing  institutional  and  financial  frameworks \nconducive to sustainable urban service delivery through reinforcing and extending the reforms for \ndecentralized urban governance to the small towns.  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\n \n\nA. \n\n \nObjectives \n \n15. \nThe  project  goal  is  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  and  to  enhance  productivity  in  selected \nsmall  urban  centers  that  play  or  have  the  potential  to  play  an  important  role  as  market,  services, \nand manufacturing centers supporting the rural hinterland. The specific objectives are to (i) improve \nthe living conditions of the small towns\u2019 communities, especially the poor, through improved urban \nenvironment,  increased  access  to  essential  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  and  enhanced \nlivelihoods;  and  (ii)  support  the  establishment  and  development  of  decentralized  and  dedicated \ninstitutional  and  management  frameworks  for  effective,  responsive,  and  sustainable  provision  of \nurban  infrastructure  and  services  in  small  towns.  Improvements  in  these  towns  are  expected  to \nhave  spin  off  benefits  for  the  rural  population  and  economy  that  have  symbiotic  relationship  with \nthese towns.  \n \n16. \nThe  Project,  which  incorporates  lessons  learned  from  earlier  urban  sector  assistance,  is \ndesigned as a sector loan project. The sector lending mode is considered appropriate as (i) the \n\n                                                 \n9\n  ADB. 1995.

The Project will cover about 10 towns with populations ranging from 8,000 to 20,000. \nFour  of  the  towns10  have  already  been  identified  on  the  basis  of  agreed-upon  criteria,  and \nsubprojects  prepared  for  the  towns.  The  remaining  towns  will  be  admitted  into  the  Project \nfollowing  the  same  selection  criteria.  Appendix  4  describes  the  criteria  and  procedures  for  town \nparticipation in the Project and for subproject appraisal.  \n \nB. \n \n17. \nThe  Project  components  are  grouped  into  two  parts:  part  A:  urban  infrastructure  and \nservices  improvements  and  part  B:  implementation  support  and  capacity  building.    Part  A \nincludes  (i)  townwide  Infrastructure  and  amenities,  (ii)  town  cleanliness  and  environmental \nservices,  and  (iii)  village  upgrading  and  livelihood  promotion.  Part  B  focuses  on  activities \nsupporting  the  implementation  of  infrastructure  improvements,  civic  awareness,  community \ndialogue and partnering processes, and building the capacity of UDAAs in the project towns.      \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n \nUrban Infrastructure and Environmental Improvements (Part A)  \n\na. \n\nTownwide Infrastructure and Amenities  \n\n1. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n18. \nTownwide  infrastructure  and  amenities  include  improvements  to  roads,  drainage,  public \nmarkets,  and  bus  stations.  Interventions  in  the  roads  subsector  include  rehabilitating  and \nreconstructing  major  town  roads  especially  the  primary  and  secondary  networks  of  roads, \nsidewalks,  and  bridges;  providing  essential  maintenance  equipment  and  street  lighting. \nInvestments  in  road  improvements  are  supported  by  building  the  capacity  of  UDAAs  for \nmaintenance to ensure that benefits from investments are sustainable.  \n \n19. \nImprovements  to  drainage  and  flood  protection  focus  on  constructing  surface  and \nunderground  drainage  and  rehabilitating  existing  systems,  with  emphasis  on  interconnecting \nisolated  stretches  of  channels  into  a  drainage  network.  Flood  protection  works  are  targeted  at \nspecific  areas  where  the  lives  of  the  poor  are  adversely  affected  by  flooding.  Investments  in \ndrainage  are  supported  by  providing  basic  maintenance  equipment  and  improving  the  systems \nand capacity for maintenance.         \n \n20.  Works  related  to  markets  and  bus  stations  aim  to  improve  the  environmental  conditions \nand public amenities of markets and bus stations. The works include construction of public toilets \nand  improvement  of  surfacing,  drainage,  public  lighting,  access  roads and footpaths, and small \npassenger vehicle stands. \n \n  \n \n21. \nTown  cleanliness  and  environmental  services  aim  to  improve  solid  waste  management \nand  sanitation  services  in  small  towns.  The  component  is  supplemented  by  a  civic  awareness \nprogram to stimulate a demand for urban services and to raise the awareness of the communities \non urban cleanliness and environment and health linkages.  \n\nTown Cleanliness and Environmental Services  \n\nb. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n10 These towns are Ponsavanh, Xam Neua, Vang Vieng, and Paxhanh. Most of the candidate towns in the long list are \n\nin the northern region that is the geographic focus of ADB Country Strategy and Program for the Lao PDR.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\n22. \nImprovements  to  solid  waste  management  will  include  provision  of  equipment  and \nvehicles  for  solid  waste  collection  and  disposal,  cleaning  up  of  existing  and  informal  dumping \nsites,  and  construction  of  controlled  landfill  sites.  New  landfill  development  will  be  supported  if \nsuitable  sites  that  meet  the  environmental  and  resettlement  guidelines  are  identified.  Due \nattention will be paid to the choice of appropriate and affordable technologies in the purchase of \nsolid waste equipment and vehicles and developing controlled landfill sites. An important element \nof  the  interventions  will  be  establishing  effective  and  sustainable  solid  waste  collection  and \ndisposal services by formulating systems, standards, and targets and strengthening the UDAAs. \nMinimizing  the  costs  of  services,  by  eliciting  community  support,  waste  minimization,  and \naccumulation  of  waste  in  village  collection  points  will  be  major  considerations.  Where  feasible, \nprivatization of waste collection will also be supported.  \n \n23. \nSanitation improvements seek to establish effective septic disposal services in the project \ntowns  where  pumped  and  piped  collection  of  wastewater  is  unaffordable.  The  improvements \ninclude provision of equipment and vehicles for wastewater collection and transportation, low-cost \nseptic  and  sludge  treatment  facilities,  and  systems  and  capacities  for  effective  septic \nmanagement. Support for privatizing septic disposal services will also form an important aspect of \nthe project assistance.    \n\n \nc. \n \n\nVillage Upgrading and Livelihood Promotion  \n\n24. \n The village upgrading and livelihood promotion component is a demand-responsive and \npro-poor program targeting the poor urban villages. The villages will be selected on the basis of \nagreed-upon  criteria.  The  major  considerations  in  selecting  villages  will  be  the  higher  levels of \npoverty  and  willingness  of  the  village  communities  to  be  active  partners  in  the  program  and  to \ncontribute  financially  or  in  kind  for  improvements.  The  program  aims  to  address  the \nmultidimensional  nature  of  poverty  by  combining  basic  infrastructure  and  service improvements \nwith  livelihood  promotion  that  the  poor  in  small  towns  have  unanimously  prioritized.  Village \ninfrastructure  and  service  improvements  seek  to  improve  the  poor  environmental  conditions  in \nvillages that have an immediate impact on the quality of life of the communities. The program of \nimprovements  will  be  developed  with  and  by  the  village  communities.  Improvements  in  each \nvillage  will  likely  include  improved  access  roads,  surface  drainage,  solid  waste  collection, \norganizing  village  contracts,  and  encouraging  communities  to  participate  in  village  waste \nmanagement  activities  and  on-site  sanitation  improvements.  Where  improvements  will  serve \nindividual  or  small  groups  of  beneficiaries,  a  process  of  additional  individual  contribution  will  be \nfollowed.  The  community-led  village  upgrading  processes  are  described  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B.  \n \n25. \nThe livelihood promotion component recognizes the links between inadequate access of \nthe poor to basic services and low incomes. Interventions for livelihood promotion will include (i) \nsocial  intermediation,  (ii)  capacity  building  support  to  sustainable  and  pro-poor  microfinance \ninstitutions  (MFIs)  in  the  project  towns,  and  (iii)  a  credit  line  for  microfinance  loans.  Social \nintermediation  will  support  the  demand  side  of  microfinance  services  by  involving  the  poor  in \nsocial  mobilization  and  orientation  activities  to  facilitate  their  access  to  and  productive  use  of \nmicrofinance  services.  The  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  and,  wherever  possible,  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), will be utilized as facilitators in social intermediation. Livelihood promotion \nwill  also  provide  a  credit  line  to  suitably  qualified  MFIs  to  be  selected  according  to  the  agreed-\nupon eligibility criteria. The credit line will serve an estimated 1,500 poor households with loans of \n$200-$300 to enable them to  develop  viable  livelihood  enterprises  through  acquired  productive \nassets or working capital.  Further, the component will support capacity building for the selected \nMFIs  in  the  project  towns.  The  livelihood  promotion  component  is  described  in  detail  in \nSupplementary Appendix C.      \n\n\f 8\n\n \nThe  village  upgrading  and  livelihood  promotion  program  assigns  a  major  role  to  villages \n26. \nand  relies  on  village  organizations  and  communities  in  planning,  constructing,  operating,  and \nmaintaining village infrastructure and services. The component will therefore be supported by an \nextensive  civic  awareness  and  community-partnering  program,  comprising  (i)  a  program  for \nraising awareness on the relationship between public health and the environment, and (ii) building \nthe  capacity  of  village  organizations,  communities,  and  UDAAs  for  community-based  village \nplanning and service delivery.  \n \n\n2.  Support  for  Project  Implementation,  Community  Processes,  and  Capacity \n\nBuilding (Part B) \n\n \n\n \na. \n\nSupport for Project Management and Implementation  \n \n\n27. \nSupport for project management and implementation provides for all the costs related to \nproject management and implementation, including incremental administration and operations of \nproject  management  and  implementation  units,  equipment,  logistics,  and  provisions  for \nconsultancy inputs to assist in implementing the urban infrastructure and services component.   \n\n \n\nb. \n\nCivic Awareness, Community Dialogue, and Partnering \n\n \n28. \nCivic  awareness,  community  dialogue,  and  partnering  form  an  umbrella  program \nsupporting all physical improvements and the livelihood promotion component under the Project. \nConsulting and NGO services, training, orientation programs, public campaigns, equipment, and \npromotion materials will be provided to help carry out civic awareness, community dialogue, and \npartnering  activities.  The  program  entails  three  major  interrelated  activities  vital  to  the \nachievement of physical improvements and sustainable project impacts. \n \nCivic  awareness  activities  will  focus  on  stimulating  a  demand  for  improved  urban \n29. \ninfrastructure  and  services  and  eliciting  the  cooperation  of  town  residents  for  successful \nimplementation of the Project. The activities will involve (i) disseminating information on the scope \nand  nature  of  the  Project,  (ii)  educating  the  towns\u2019  people  on  the  linkages  between  the \nenvironment  and  health  and  the  benefits  to  be  derived  from  the  project  interventions,  (iii) \ninforming the residents of their role and responsibility for good environmental practices for solid \nwaste and septic management, and (iv) raising the residents\u2019 awareness of the cost implications \nof  improved  services.  Cooperation  with  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  and  other  relevant \nprograms of Nam Saat  \u2013  National  Center  for  Environmental  Health  and  Water  Supply  \u2013 will be \nmaintained, where possible, to utilize the existing experience and promotion materials.     \n \n30. \nCommunity dialogue activities will involve the towns\u2019 people at each stage of the townwide \nimprovements,  including  towns\u2019  subproject  preparation,  detailed  design,  construction  process, \nand follow-up monitoring activities. A participation strategy will be developed and implemented to \ngenerate periodic feedback from the stakeholders.  \n \n  Community  partnering  will  target  the  village  communities  to  become  active  partners  in \n31. \ncommunity-led  village  upgrading  programs.  It  will  build  the  capacity  of  village  organizations  and \ncommunities  in  participatory  village  planning  and  decision  making  to  prioritize  works,  choose \ndesigns, participate in procurement, O&M, and monitoring and evaluation activities. It will assist \nthe  villages  in  establishing  village  working  committees,  cost-sharing  mechanisms,  and  training \nvillage leaders and key persons including women members as well as UDAA staff.                \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nCapacity Building for UDAAs  \n\nc. \n \n\n32. \nThe  capacity  building  program  involves  itself  in  accomplishing  one  of  the  key  project \nobjectives and the Government policy of extending reforms for decentralized urban governance to \nthe  small  towns.  The  program  aims  to  assist  in  the  smooth  establishment  and  development  of \ncore capacities within the newly formed UDAAs for project planning, implementation, O&M, and \nfinancial  management.  The  program  will  apply  itself  to  updating,  adjusting,  and  extending \noperational  and  procedural  systems,  developed  or  being  developed  in  other  UDAAs.  It  will  help \ngradually develop the organizational structure and urban management frameworks of UDAAs in \nthe small towns. Assistance in financial management will focus on establishing and implementing \n(i) cost recovery and local revenue generation measures, similar to those being implemented in \nVientiane;  and  (ii)  transparent  financial  procedures  for  managing  income  and  expenditure,  and \nimproved  budgeting  and  accounting  systems.  A  major  task  will  be  assisting  the  UDAAs  in \nmeeting  the  targets  of  their  \u201coperational  and  financial  action  plans.\u201d  Close  coordination  will  be \nmaintained with the ongoing ADB TA (footnote 12) for strengthening the UDAAs in Vientiane and \nsecondary towns as well as the capacity building component of the Vientiane Urban Infrastructure \nand Services Project (footnote 9).  \n \n33. \nThe program will assist in forming a UDAA Network (i) to facilitate exchange of information \nand experience among UDAAs; (ii) to use the experience of individuals, who played a prominent \nrole in the evolution of UDAA reforms in Vientiane and the secondary towns, as resource persons \nand  agents  of  change;  and  (iii)  to  create  a  forum  for  advocacy  to  accelerate  UDAA  reforms. \nPeriodic meetings and workshops will be arranged to facilitate the network activities.      \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n \n34. \nAdvancing  and  Extending  Reforms  for  Decentralized Urban Governance. The most \nprominent feature of the Project is its support to the reforms for decentralized urban governance \nby  which  (i)  urban  administration  is  brought  closer  to  the  people;  (ii)  a  more  efficient,  demand-\nresponsive,  and  equitable  urban  service  delivery  is  ensured  at  the  local  level;  and  (iii)  local \nresources and especially the resources of the service recipients are mobilized. The Project will be \ninstrumental  in  establishing  and  institutionalizing,  in  small  towns,  UDAAs  with  dedicated  urban \nfunctions and own sources of revenues and budgets. It will help in developing core capacities in \nUDAAs  and  pave  the  way  for  them  to  become  increasingly  competent  and  autonomous  urban \nlocal  governments.  Cost  recovery  for  O&M  of  urban  infrastructure  and  services  by  introducing \nand implementing user charges, fees, and other urban-based incomes is an essential element of \ndecentralized  urban  governance  reforms.  The  relevant  assurances,  to  which  the  Government \nagreed,  are  given  in  para.  73.  The  urban  policy  and  institutional  reform  agenda  that  the \nGovernment agreed to is presented in Appendix 5.   \n \nSector Lending Approach. Another feature of the Project is its sector lending approach \n35. \nas  against  the  traditional  project  loan  approach.  The  sector  lending  approach  provides  the \nneeded  flexibility  to  make  adjustments  as  implementation  proceeds,  and  hence  reinforces  the \nresponsiveness  to  demand.  The  sector  lending  modality,  adopted  for  the  Project,  incorporates \nseveral  strategic  features  and  incentives  to  promote  demand  responsiveness  and,  more \nimportantly, smooth implementation of the urban institutional and policy reform agenda. Entry into \nthe  Project  is  conditioned  by  (i)  the  towns\u2019  demonstrated  commitment  to  undertaking  urban \ninstitutional reforms by establishing UDAAs and (ii) contribution to a portion of the capital cost of \ninvestments.  The  towns,  to  be  admitted  into  the  Project,  are  required  to  prepare  time-bound \noperational  and  financial  action  plans  to  strengthen  UDAAs  and,  more  specifically,  to  increase \ntheir  revenues  and  develop  their  staffing  and  technical  capacities  in  a  progressive  manner \n(Appendix 4). \n\n\f 10\n\n36. \nPoverty  Focus. The Project has a strong poverty orientation.  Specific  pro-poor features \ninclude  (i)  prioritizing  the  towns  with  higher  levels  of  poverty  for  inclusion  in  the  Project;  (ii) \nprioritizing  subprojects  with  higher  poverty  reduction  impact;  (iii)  promoting  inclusive  processes \nthrough  an  extensive  community  dialogue  and  partnering  program,  accompanying  physical \ninvestments;  (iv)  integrated  nature  of  interventions  addressing  the  multidimensional  nature  of \npoverty; (v) direct targeting of the poor within towns through the village upgrading and livelihood \npromotion  program;  and  (vii)  promoting  good  governance  by  establishing  in  small  towns  \ndecentralized  UDAAs  for  more  responsive  urban  management.  The  village  upgrading  and \nlivelihood  promotion  component,  which  prioritizes  villages  with  higher  levels  of  poverty,  is \ndesigned to address the poor villages\u2019 highest priority basic infrastructure and services needs, to \nbe determined by the village communities themselves. It is also designed to improve the income-\ngenerating  ability  of  the  poor  households.  The  specific  elements  of  the  program  include  (i) \nadequate  representation  of  the  poor  and  women  in  village  working  committees,  (ii)  allowing  the \npoorer villagers to contribute in kind to the cost of improvements, and (iii) promoting community-\nbased service delivery and village contracts for solid waste collection, by which the poor\u2019s burden \nof service charges is relieved. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is presented in \nAppendix 6.       \n \n37. \nParticipatory  Approaches.  The  Project  puts  a  strong  emphasis  on  participatory \napproaches  by  incorporating  a  process  of  community  dialogue  into  all  stages  of  the  Project. \nParticipatory processes at the town level are fostered under the village upgrading program where \nthe  village  organizations  and  communities  are  assigned  a  major  role  in  planning,  implementing, \noperating,  and  maintaining  improvements.  To  ensure  that  the  intended  participatory  processes \nare  followed,  the  Project  provides  considerable  input  for  implementing  a  program  of  community \ndialogue  and  partnering,  involving  assistance  in  designing  and  implementing  consultative \nprocesses,  and  capacity  building  for  UDAA  staff,  village  organizations,  and  communities  for \ncommunity-based improvements. It is planned that the existing structures in villages and districts \nof the Lao Women\u2019s Union and, wherever possible, NGOs with relevant experience will also be \nutilized in these processes. \n  \n38. \nPrivate Sector Participation. The Project promotes private sector participation in urban \nservice delivery. In some small towns, the private sector has already been involved in solid waste \ncollection and disposal services albeit in a rudimentary way. But, success is constrained primarily \nby  the  low  level  of  user  charges  and  fees,  which  are  inadequate  to  cover  the  full  cost  of \noperations;  and  the  limited  capacities  of  town  administrations  to  undertake  and  supervise \nprivately  delivered  services.  The  strategy  of  the  Project,  therefore,  will  involve  enhancing  the \ncapacity  of  UDAAs  (i)  to  formulate  and  manage  private  sector  operations,  and  (ii)  to  implement \ncharges  and  fees  at  reasonable  levels  that  allow  local  entrepreneurs  to  achieve  a  satisfactory \nlevel of cost recovery and sustain their operations. The areas of private sector participation, with \nwhich  the  Project  may  become  involved,  are  solid  waste  management,  septic  desludging,  and \nmanagement of public markets and bus stations. \n       \n39. \nEnvironment. The initial screening of potential environmental impacts of the subprojects \nindicates that the subprojects will not affect environmentally sensitive areas, nor will they cause \nchanges  in  the  physical,  biological,  and  social  environment.  Any  adverse  environmental  effects \nwould  be  minor  and  easily  mitigated.  Indeed,  most  of  the  subprojects  will  bring  clear  positive \nenvironmental benefits. The proposed physical works are limited in scope and concern mainly the \nimprovement  of  existing  facilities,  drainage  channels,  and  roads.  Where  sanitary  landfill  and \nseptic disposal treatment sites are proposed, the necessary mitigating measures will be applied \nto minimize negative impacts. The summary initial environmental examination is in Appendix 7.         \n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\n40. \nResettlement.  The  resettlement  impacts  of  the  Project  appear  minimal.  Virtually  all \nphysical  works  for  the  townwide  infrastructure  and  amenities  component  in  part  A  will  be  made \nwithin  existing  rights-of-way  to  avoid  land  acquisition.  Since  the  towns  are  small  and  are  not \nexperiencing  uncontrolled  development,  there  is  no  encroachment  on  the  rights-of-way.  In  the \ncase  of  village  upgrading,  one  criterion  for  subproject  selection  is  that  no  land  acquisition  or \nrelocation  is  required.  The  only  component  that  will  involve  some  land  acquisition  is  the  landfill \nsites to be provided as part of the town cleanliness/environmental improvements. However, since \nthese sites are located outside the towns\u2019 inhabited areas, they will not involve relocation.  Short \nresettlement plans, prepared for the first batch of towns, indicate that lost assets include land for \nlandfill sites, four wooden houses, and standing crops. Only three families will be relocated. The \nmain principles of resettlement framework that will apply to all the subprojects under the Project \nare  to  (i)  avoid  or  minimize  involuntary  resettlement  and  loss  of  assets  and  income;  (ii)  where \nresettlement  is  unavoidable,  carry  out  a  resettlement  plan  to  improve  or  restore  the  preproject \nliving  standards  of  the  affected  families;  and  (iii)  provide  adequate  compensation,  at  least  at \nreplacement  rates  to  all  persons  affected  through  loss  of  asset  or  income  earning-capabilities. \nThe summary and detailed resettlement plans, to which the Government agreed, are in Appendix \n8 and Supplementary Appendix D respectively.   \n \nD. \n \nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $20 million equivalent, comprising $9.7 million \n41. \nin  foreign  exchange  (including  interest  during  construction  of    $0.4  million),  and  $10.3  million \nequivalent in local currency (Table 1).  The cost estimates include approximately $0.92 million for \ntaxes and duties. The total project cost was derived from estimates prepared for four small towns \nsubprojects. The estimates indicate an average cost of $986,000 per town for the proposed urban \ninfrastructure  improvements  and  amenities,  $300,000  for  urban  environmental  services,  and \nabout $239,000 for village upgrading.

The ADB loan will cover 100% \nof the foreign exchange cost and 66% of the local currency cost, excluding taxes. The Borrower \n\n\f 12\n\nwill be the Lao PDR. The ADB loan proceeds will finance the full foreign exchange cost and about \n71.6%  of  the  local  currency  cost  of  the  proposed  road  improvements  and  other  civil  works  and \n100%  of  the  cost  of  consulting  services,  vehicles  and  equipment,  and  community  awareness \nprograms and livelihood promotion.   \n \nADB  financing  for  the  local  currency  expenditure  is  justified  by  the  country\u2019s  limited \n43. \ndomestic  resources  resulting  from  (i)  the  low  tax  base  and  capacities  that  are  constraining  the \nGovernment  efforts  to  enhance  local  resource  mobilization;  (ii)  delays  in  several  planned \nhydropower  investment  projects  intended  to  produce  electricity  for  export  to  its  neighboring \ncountries; and (iii) the global recessionary trend, which has resulted in slower export growth and \nlimited  foreign  direct  investments  for  the  country.  The  Project  will  also  stimulate  backward  and \nforward  integration  in  the  economy,  thereby  enhancing  its  efficiency,  as  urban  infrastructure  \u2013\nroads, drainage and flood control facilities, public markets, and bus stations \u2013 linking strategically \nlocated small towns to the rural hinterland, is constructed or upgraded.   \n \n44. \nThe Government of the Lao PDR together with the community will contribute 20% of the \nproject  cost,  estimated  at  $4.0  million  equivalent,  to  cover  primarily land and relocation costs, \nincremental administration costs, taxes and duties, and the balance of the cost of the proposed \ncivil works. Residents of villages participating in the Project will also finance about 1%, estimated \nat  $239,000,  mostly  through  their  labor  contributions.11    The  proposed  financing  plan  for  the \nProject is summarized in Table 2.   \n \n \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank a \nGovernment of the Lao PDR \nBeneficiaries \n     Total \n\nTable 2:  Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nForeign \nExchange \n9.7 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n9.7 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n6.3 \n3.8 \n0.2 \n10.3 \n\n \n\nTotal \nCost \n16.0 \n  3.8 \n   0.2 \n 20.0 \n\nShare \n(%) \n80 \n19 \n  1 \n100 \n\n a  Includes $ 1.63  million to be onlent to small town urban development administration authorities  UDAAs. \n\n \n45. \nThe  UDAAs  to  be  established  in  selected  small  towns  will  contribute  $1.63  million \nequivalent through subloans from the Government using the ADB loan proceeds.12 The subloans \nwill  carry  an  interest  rate  of  6.7%  per  annum,  with  a  maturity  of  15  years  after  subproject \ncompletion,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years.13  These  subloans,  while  relatively  small  in \nproportion  to  the  total  estimated  cost  of  each  small  town\u2019s  proposed  infrastructure  and  urban \nservices  improvements,  will  strengthen  the  UDAAs\u2019  local  resource  mobilization  capability  since \ntheir  repayment  will  entail  the  efficient  collection  of  appropriate  solid  waste  and  septic  disposal \nfees. The MFIs to be selected for implementing the livelihood promotion subcomponent will also \ncontribute  $375,000  equivalent  through  subloans 14  from  the  Government  using  the  ADB  loan \nproceeds. The detailed financing plan is in Appendix 9.   \n                                                 \n11  This is equivalent to 10% of the village upgrading costs for which villages expressed willingness to pay. \n12  At approximately $163,000 for each UDAA, these subloans correspond to the equipment and vehicle cost of the solid \nwaste and septic management investments. UDAAs will be able to repay the subloans through user charges for solid \nwaste collection and septic cleaning. The subloans may be reduced through contributions in kind.   \n\n13  The central Government will bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk.  The  rate  of  6.7%  is  based  on  the  interest  rate  on  the \nloan, a premium for forecast exchange rate risk, and a minimal spread to cover the government\u2019s management and \nadministration costs.           \n  The  onlending  from  the  Governm ent to the selected MFIs will carry a 9 percent interest rate with a maturity of 10   \nyears and a 3-year grace period from component completion.     \n\n14\n\n\f \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n \n1. \n\nProject Management  \n\n13 \n\n \n46. \nThe  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project  will  be  MCTPC.  A  project  steering  committee \nchaired  by  the  vice  minister  of  MCTPC  and  with  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance \n(MOF),  Department  of  Public  Administration  and  Civil  Service  of  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office, \nCommittee for Planning and Cooperation, Bank of Lao PDR, UDAAs, and provincial governments \n(vice governor) concerned \u2013 has already been formed. The committee will meet semiannually, or \nupon request by any of its members, to oversee project implementation, facilitate cooperation and \ncoordination  among  concerned  agencies,  and  ensure  timely  implementation  of  the  urban  policy \nand institutional reform agenda.  \n \nA Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will be set up in the Department of Housing and Urban \n47. \nPlanning of MCTPC. PCU, headed by a national project director, will (i) be responsible for overall \nproject  implementation,  programming,  budgeting,  and  financial  planning  and  accounting;  (ii) \nrecruit  project  consultants;  (iii)  confirm  the  selection  of  remaining  project  towns  based  on  the \nestablished criteria; (iv) appraise subproject proposals, prepared by project implementation units \n(PIUs),  before  they  are  forwarded  to  ADB  for  approval;  (v)  provide  administrative  and  technical \nsupport  to  UDAAs  as  implementing  agencies;  (vi)  be  responsible  for  overall  execution  of  the \ncapacity  building  component;  (vii)  advise  on  procurement  by  UDAAs;  (viii)  be  responsible  for \nperiodic progress reports and project completion report; and (ix) organize a project performance \nmonitoring  system.  The  project  director  and  the  deputy  director  of  PCU  have  already  been \nappointed. \n \nUDAAs to be established in each project town will be the implementing agencies. PIUs to \n48. \nbe  located  in  UDAAs  will  be  responsible  for  all  aspects  of  project  implementation,  including  (i) \nsubprojects  selection  and  preparations;  (ii)  detailed  design;  (iii)  procurement  of  goods  and \nservices under local competitive bidding (LCB); (iv) planning and implementing village upgrading \ncomponent; and (v) implementing civic awareness, community dialogue, and partnering activities. \nTo  use  project  implementation  as  a  process  for  transferring  knowledge  and  skills  to  the  newly \nestablished  UDAAs  and  to  maximize  on-the-job  training  opportunities  for  them,  the  project \nmanagement and implementation activities will, as much as possible, be delegated to PIUs with \nthe  majority  of  the  consultants  and  counterpart  staff  being  located  in  PIUs  in  UDAAs,  and  with \nPCU  having  a  core  unit  with  mainly  coordinating  and  facilitating  functions.  A  high  level  of \ntechnical support to UDAAs will be required from PCU and provincial and district departments of \nMCTPC.  \n \n49. \nFor  the  livelihood  promotion  component,  suitably  qualified  MFIs,  to  be  identified  during \nproject  implementation  in  accordance  with  the  agreed-upon  eligibility  criteria,  will  be  the \nImplementing  Agency.  MFIs  will  closely  coordinate  with  UDAAs,  especially  in  the  social \nintermediation activities. Because of the small nature of the livelihood promotion component, no \nseparate executing agency is proposed. However, the Bank of Lao PDR and MOF as members of \nthe national project steering committee will provide the necessary sector support and supervision \nover  MFI  activities.  The  detailed  implementation  arrangements  for  the  livelihood  promotion \ncomponent are given in Supplementary Appendix C.     \n \n50. \nProvincial  project  facilitating  committees  (PPFCs),  to  be  chaired  by  the  respective  vice \nprovincial  governor  and  with  representation  from  UDAA;  Department  of  Communication,  Posts, \nTransport,  and  Construction  (DCTPC);  Department  of  Finance;  and  other  provincial  and  district \nagencies  concerned,  will  be  formed  in  each  project  town.  The  PPFC\u2019s  main  role  will  be  to \nfacilitate  UDAA  reforms  particularly  actual  delegation  of  functions  from  central  and  provincial \ndepartments  to  UDAAs,  UDAA  local  resource  mobilization  reforms  for  levying  and  collecting \n\n\f 14\n\nurban  charges  and  fees,  particularly  issuance  of  necessary  instructions  and  directives  at \nprovincial  government  level,  support  for  staffing  and  logistics  of  UDAAs,  and  facilitating  the \ntechnical support of other relevant departments e.g., DCTPC, to UDAAs. The committee will meet \nquarterly. The project organization chart is shown in Appendix 10.            \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n51. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  6  years  beginning  in  early  2003,  with \ncompletion  by  31  January  2009.  It  will  be  undertaken  in  three  overlapping  phases,  with  three \nbatches of towns. The first phase will involve four towns, for which subprojects have already been \nprepared  and  are  ready  for  appraisal.  Phases  2  and  3  each  will  include a group of three towns \nwith  subprojects  coming  onstream  at  the  beginning  of  years  2  and  3.  Each  group  of  towns  will \nfollow  a  4-year  cycle  of  (i)  institutional  and  community  preparation,  (ii)  survey  and  design,  (iii) \nbidding and letting of contracts and construction, and (iv) post-construction activities. Phasing will \nlead more efficient use of project resources, particularly PCU staff, consultants, and equipment. \nAdditionally, it will provide time for delayed implementation to be completed within the designed \nproject life. The 6-year implementation period is considered appropriate, given the large numbers \nof subprojects, the geographic spread of the Project, and institutional capacities at the local level. \nThe project implementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n52. \nADB-financed goods and works will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. ICB procedures will be used for major civil works contracts estimated to cost over \n$1.0 million and supply contracts valued over  $500,000. For civil works contracts not exceeding \n$1.0  million,  LCB  procedures  will  be  used.  The  Government\u2019s  procurement  guidelines \n(Implementing  Rules  and  Regulations  on  Government  Procurement  of  Goods,  Construction, \nRepairs,  and  Services,  Dec  1998),  prepared  under  an  ADB  TA,  are  satisfactory.  Contract \ndocuments  for  LCB,  developed  under  the  Secondary  Towns  Urban  Development  Project \n(footnote  9),  can  be  used,  subject  to  ADB\u2019s  review  and  approval.  For  supply  contracts  valued \n$500,000  or  lower,  international  shopping  procedures  will  be  followed.  PCU  will  carry  out \nprocurement through ICB and international shopping. Procurement through LCB will be initiated \nby UDAAs and be ratified by a bid evaluation committee to be chaired by the UDAA president and \ncomprising representatives from provincial and district DCTPCs. The documents will be sent ADB \nthrough PCU for review. The works and goods to be procured will be packaged on a town basis.  \n \nFor  village  upgrading,  most  of  the  works  will  be  labor-intensive  and  will  not  require \n53. \nsophisticated technologies and equipment. A package of works per village is relatively small, at \nabout $30,000. It will, therefore, be appropriate to call for the participation in construction works of \nthe local communities, resulting in a sense of ownership and sustainability of the project assets. \nWorks that do not cost more than $10,000 are not attractive to private contractors, and where the \ncapacity  of  the  community  to  undertake  the  works  is  adequate,  community  participation  in \nprocurement will be applied. Indicative procurement packaging is shown in Appendix 12. \n\n \n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n54. \nInternational and domestic consulting firms will provide consulting services to assist PCU \nand  PIUs  in  three  major  areas:  (i)  overall  project  management  and  implementation;  (ii) \nimplementing  the  activities  for  civic  awareness,  community  dialogue,  and  partnering;  and  (iii) \ncapacity  building  for  UDAAs.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements for engaging domestic consultants \nsatisfactory to ADB. Consultant selection will be based on the method of \u201cquality- and cost-based \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\nselection\u201d and full technical proposal will be used. An estimated 661 person-months of consulting \nservices  (77  international  and  584  domestic)  will  be  required.  The  consultants,  who  will  be \nengaged  through  one  firm,  will  assist  the  PCU  and  PIUs  in  project  planning,  programming, \nbudgeting,  accounting,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  reporting,  preparing  and  appraising \nsubprojects,  detailed  engineering  design, \ntendering,  supervising  construction,  preparing \nspecifications  for  purchase  of  equipment  and  vehicles,  setting  standards  and  systems  for \noperation  of  urban  services  and  environmental  assessments,  and  preparing  and  implementing \nresettlement plans, civic awareness, community dialogue, and partnering program; designing and \nimplementing the village upgrading and livelihood promotion component, and capacity building for \nUDAAs. The terms of reference for consulting services are outlined in Appendix 13.     \n \n55. \nSite surveys needed to prepare detailed designs will be sublet to domestic survey firms. \nDetailed  design  will  be  basically  prepared  by  domestic  consultants  under  the  guidance  and \ninstruction  of  the  international  consultant.  Bidding  documents  for  ICB  will  be  prepared  by  the \ninternational  consultant  whereas  those  for  LCB  will  be  prepared  in  the  local  language  (to  be \ntranslated into English for ADB\u2019s review) by the domestic consultants under the guidance of the \ninternational  consultant.  During  the  construction  period,  the  domestic  consultants  will  undertake \nprimary responsibility for day-to-day inspection and supervision while the international consultant \nwill  oversee  and  monitor  overall  progress  of  the  work,  coordinate  with  MCTPC  and  prepare \nprogress reports for PCU to submit to ADB. \n\n \n4. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n56. \nPayment  of  eligible  expenditures  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  either  through \ndisbursement procedures, direct procedure, commitment procedure, or reimbursement procedure \nin accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook, January 2001, as amended from time \nto time. Immediately upon loan effectiveness, the Government will open and maintain an imprest \naccount  for  the  PCU  in  Vientiane  to  ensure  the  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds  and  expedite \nimplementation. Concurrently, subimprest accounts will be established in each project town. The \ninitial amount to be advanced to the imprest account in Vientiane and in each project town will be \nequivalent to the 6-month estimated expenditure, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. \nFor  eligible  expenditures  incurred  and  paid  from  the  imprest  account,  the  statement  of \nexpenditures (SOE) procedure will be used. To liquidate and replenish an account, a withdrawal \napplication duly supported by documents in accordance with the Disbursement Handbook will be \nsubmitted. Any individual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under the SOE procedure will \nnot exceed $50,000. The PCU is responsible for supervising the administration by the PIUs of the \ntown-level  imprest  accounts,  accounting  operations,  use  of  the  imprest  fund;  consolidating  the \nexpenditure reports; and supporting documentation for SOEs and withdrawal applications. \n \n\nAdvance Action for Recruiting Consultants \n\n6. \n \n57. \nTo expedite implementation, ADB approved the Government\u2019s request for advance action \nin  engaging  consultants.  Selection  is  expected  to  advance  up  to  the  stage  of  evaluation  of  the \ntechnical  proposals.  The  Government  has  been  informed  that  approval  of  advance  action  does \nnot in any way commit ADB to finance the relevant expenditures under the Project or the Project \nitself.  \n  \n\n \n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n      \n\n58. \nThe Government, through the PCU will provide ADB with quarterly progress reports. The \nreport  will  be  in  such  form  and  detail  as  ADB  requests  and  include  information  on  physical \nprogress of the works as well as on the institutional and policy reform aspects of the Project. The \n\n\f 16\n\nPCU  will  also  submit  to  ADB,  within  3  months  of  the  Project's  physical  completion,  a  project \ncompletion report that will give the details of project implementation, costs, benefit monitoring and \nevaluation activities, and other relevant information. The national project director, with assistance \nfrom  an  adequate  number  of  qualified  accounting  staff,  will  establish  and  maintain  separate \naccounts  and  records  to  easily  identify  income  and  expenditures  related  to  the  Project.  All \naccounts  and  statements  of  expenditures  and  revenues  related  to  the  Project  will  be  audited \nannually by auditors acceptable to ADB. ADB will review the terms of reference for the auditors. \nAnnual financial statements together with audited project accounts and reports will be submitted \nto ADB within 9 months of the close of the financial year. Submitting audited financial statements \nmore than 12 months after the due date can result in ADB\u2019s suspension of loan disbursements.   \n\n \n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nBenefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  undertaken  for  each  project  component  to \n59. \nensure that project facilities are managed efficiently and benefits are realized. The PCU, assisted \nby  the  consultants,  will  develop  a  comprehensive  project  performance  management  system \n(PPMS).  The  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  carrying  out  the  PPMS  activities,  including  the \nestablishment  of  benchmarks  through  baseline  physical  and  socioeconomic  surveys,  data \ncollection, and analysis. The PPMS system will provide a mechanism to involve the community in \nthe system. Impacts to be measured are financial and technical competence of UDAAs, extent of \ncommunity  participation,  accountability,  transparency,  levels  of  coverage  of  services  (especially \nfor  the  poor,  women,  and  minority  groups),  opportunities  created,  and  direct  employment \ngeneration.  An  external  agency  (NGO  or  academia)  will  undertake  an  independent  monitoring \nand evaluation of resettlement. The PCU will submit a detailed implementation plan for monitoring \nbenefits and preparing benchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within 6 months \nof loan effectiveness, and annual PPMS reports.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n60. \nADB and the Government will undertake jointly a comprehensive midterm review within 3 \nyears  of  the  Project\u2019s  start.  The  review  will  assess  progress  achieved  by  the  Government  and \nUDAAs on the urban policy and institutional reform agenda. It will also assess the performance of \nUDAAs  in  meeting  the  targets  set  in  their  operational  and  financial  action  plans.  Subproject \npreparation,  appraisal,  project  design,  and  implementation  arrangements  will  be  examined. \nAmong the topics to be assessed are the performance of UDAAs in following community dialogue \nprocesses at town level and participatory processes as part of the village upgrading component; \nimplementation and procurement arrangements followed under the village upgrading component; \nthe  adequacy  of  and  adherence  to  the  procurement  arrangements,  including  transparency  of \nselection  and  award  procedures;  performance  of  consultants  as  regards  support  in  project \nmanagement and implementation, community awareness, dialogue and partnership processes, \nand  the  capacity  building  component;  Based  on  all  these  assessments,  the  midterm  review  will \nformulate,  within  the  updated  sector  setting  and  other  changing  circumstances,  the  necessary \ncourses of action for the Government and ADB to ensure successful project implementation and \nthe Project's effectiveness in achieving its objectives. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \n61. \nGeneral  Gains  (Social  and  Economic).  The  proposed  Project  will  benefit  a  current \npopulation of about 143,000 and a population projected 170,000 in the next 6 years through an \nimproved  urban  environment  resulting  in  improved  health  and  living  conditions  in  small  towns. \nThe health and environmental benefits will arise from (i) upgraded roads leading to reduced dust, \nreduced death and injury from road accidents, and improved accessibility; (ii) improved drainage \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nflooding,  and  damage \n\nlessening localized flooding and its detrimental health impacts; (iii) wider coverage of solid waste \ncollection  and  better  sanitation  conditions  resulting  in  reduction  in  sanitation-  and  fecal  borne \ndiseases;  and  (iv)  improved  public  markets  and  bus  station  environments.  Health benefits from \ninfrastructure  improvements  will  be  further  enhanced  by  a  civic  awareness  program,  educating \nthe community on the links between environment and health.  \n \n62. \nThe economy of the small towns will benefit from increased productivity of the populations \nas  a  result  of  health  improvements.  The  economy  will  further  gain  from  increased  urban \nefficiency, as the project interventions will reduce disruptions caused by poor road and drainage \nto  urban  assets,  and  poor  environmental  services. \nconditions, \nImprovements  to  markets  and  bus  stations  will  enhance  the  role  of  small  towns  as  marketing \ncenters within the rural hinterland. Economic gains will spur the growth of the tourism industry in \nsome  towns  with  great  tourism  potential.  An  improved  economy  and  higher  incomes  in  small \ntowns  will  expand  the  urban  markets  which,  in  turn,  will  help  commercialize  and  diversify \nagricultural products with significant positive implications for rural development. \n \n63. \nImpact  on  the  Poor  and  Vulnerable.  All  the  project  interventions  will  either  directly  or \nindirectly  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  poor.  Where  the  interventions  do  not  directly  target  the \npoor,  socially  inclusive  processes  incorporated  into  the  Project  will  ensure  that  the  poor  will \nbenefit  proportionately.  About  42,500  urban  poor  or  30%  of  the  population  will  benefit  indirectly \nfrom townwide infrastructure and services and environmental improvements. Road improvements \nwill  enhance  the  mobility  of  the  urban  poor  and  provide  them  with  increased  access  to  income-\nearning  opportunities.  Drainage  improvements  will  have  a  profound  impact  on  the  lives  of  the \npoor,  the  majority  of  whom  live  on  low-lying  land  prone  to  flooding.  Improved  solid  waste \nmanagement and septic disposal and construction of more public toilets will reduce the frequency \nof illnesses in urban poor households, as well as the medical expenses associated with illnesses.  \n \n64. \nThe  village  upgrading  program,  where  the  poorest  villages  have  priority  for  basic \ninfrastructure  and  services  improvements,  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  poverty  reduction.  About \n60 urban villages with high levels of poverty and an estimated 69,000 residents will benefit from \nimproved  environment  and  basic  services.  The  greater  role  that  this  program  assigns  to  the \nvillages will ensure that the improvements are responsive to the needs of the poor. The program \nfor civic awareness, community dialogue, and partnering will help villagers, especially the poor, to \nplay an active role in designing and implementing the village upgrading works. A significant gain \nfrom  the  program  will  be  the  improved  capacities  of  UDAAs  and  villages  for  community-based \nplanning  and  service  delivery  and  a  sustainable  program  of  self-funded  activities  that  can  be \nreplicated by the Government without project funds. \n   \n65. \nA  number  of  project  components  will  directly  and  indirectly  impact  on  sustainable \nlivelihood  and  increased  income-earning  opportunities  for  the  towns\u2019  populations,  especially  the \npoor. First, a direct impact on livelihoods will be achieved through the microfinance services to be \ndelivered  by  a  sustainable  and  pro-poor  MFI  to  be  supported  under  the  Project.  An  estimated \n1,500  poor  households  (about  8,400  urban  poor)  will  be  provided  with microfinance services, \nincluding  social  intermediation  assistance  and  loans  \u2013  to  support  them  in  acquiring  productive \nassets or working capital to develop viable livelihood enterprises. Complementary interventions, \nsupporting both the demand and supply sides of microfinance while adhering to the principle of \nsustainability  will  have  a  profound  effect  on  the  lives  of  the  poor  who  currently  cannot  access \ncredit  services.  Second,  improving  the  environments  of  public  markets  will  lead  to  increased \nincomes  for  market  vendors  who  form  one  of  the  major  livelihood  groups  in  small  towns.  Third, \ntemporary  employment  will  be  created  during  construction  of  the  urban  infrastructure  and \nimprovement  of  services.  The  use  of  labor-intensive  technologies  will  generate  employment. \n\n\f 18\n\nFinally,  significant  job  opportunities  will  be  created  with  the  village  upgrading  works,  which  will, \nwherever possible, adopt the procurement mode of \u201ccommunity participation in procurement\u201d.  \n \n66. \nGiven  the  dominant  role  of  women  in  household  management,  sanitation,  and  health, \nwomen  will  be  the  primary  recipients  of  the  benefits  from  improved  urban  infrastructure  and \nservices at both town and village levels. They will be a major target group in the village upgrading \nprogram  and  civic  awareness  and  community  dialogue  activities.  Being  the  principal  sellers  in \nmarkets, women in small towns and from the adjacent rural areas also stand to benefit from the \nimproved markets. The labor-intensive approach to project construction, accompanied with wide \npublicity on job opportunities, is most likely to benefit women as the Lao women are accustomed \nto hard physical labor. Livelihood promotion is expected to have a major impact on women since \n90% of the market vendors and most microentrepreneurs in small towns are women.  \n \nA  careful  scrutiny  of  individual  and  joint  project  components  in  the  identified  subprojects \n67. \nindicates  no  adverse  project  impact  on  various  ethnic  minorities.  Thus,  no  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment plan is required. Special measures will be taken to ensure that the ethnic minorities \nwill  benefit  equally  from  the  project  interventions.  Civic  awareness,  community  dialogue,  and \npartnering  activities  will  involve  specific  approaches  to  effectively  communicate  with  the  ethnic \nminorities.  Selecting  villages  for  upgrading  will  be  based,  among  others,  on  the  percentage  of \nethnic  minorities.  The  principle  of  proportionate  representation  of  ethnic  groups  in  village \ncommittees  will  be  strictly  followed  in  the  village  upgrading  program.  Where  the  percentage  of \nethnic  minorities  is  high,  utilization,  in  community  dialogue  and  partnering  programs,  of  NGOs, \nwith experience in working with ethnic minorities, will be sought. In case subprojects are likely to \naffect ethnic minorities, mitigation measures, either as part of a resettlement plan or a separate \nindigenous peoples development plan, will be prepared prior to subproject approval. \n \n68. \nInstitutional  Impact.  The  Project\u2019s  support  for  the  decentralized  urban  governance \nreforms  will  lead  to  more  effective  and  efficient  urban  management.  Establishing  UDAAs  with \nexclusively  urban  functions  at  the  local  level  and  creating  a  decentralized  financial  framework \nthrough  mobilizing  local  resources  to  finance  the  delivery  of  urban  services  will  lead  to \nsustainable  improvements  to  the  environment  of  small  towns.  The  towns\u2019  people  will  gain \nsignificantly from the increased capacities of UDAAs in urban planning and management.     \n \nImpact on the Rural Hinterland. The Project will indirectly benefit a substantial number \n69. \nof rural people, from the surrounding and adjacent districts, who commute to the towns on a daily \nor  weekly  basis  to  use  social  services  and  amenities  as  well  as  the  marketing  facilities  to \nexchange their produce with urban goods. It is estimated that about 127,000 poor people from the \nrural  hinterland  will  benefit  from  improved  road  conditions  that  will  give  them  access  to  urban \nmarkets,  and  know-how  in  selling,  buying,  and  competing  in  the  marketplace.  The  same  rural \npopulation  will  benefit  from  overall  improvements  to  infrastructure  and  services  in  small  towns. \nImprovements  to  the  sanitation  conditions  and  amenities  surrounding  the  produce  markets  will \nbenefit  both  vendors  and  buyers  from  the  rural  hinterland.  The  economic  growth  generated  in \nsmall  towns  through  overall  infrastructure  improvements  will  offer  greater  job  opportunities  and \nvalid  livelihood  alternatives  to  the  slush-and-burn  agriculture  practiced  by  ethnic  groups  in  the \nadjacent rural areas.15 \n \n70. \nEconomic  and  Financial  Analyses.  Economic  and  financial  analyses  of  the  proposed \nsubprojects were prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Framework for the Economic and Financial \nAppraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects.  Base  case  economic  internal  rate  of returns \n                                                 \n15  An  example  is  Vang  Vieng,  where  the  growth  of  the  tourist  industry  has  not  only  spurred  a  large  number  of \nguesthouses and restaurants, but also created a specialized handicraft industry and a growing market for fruits and \nvegetables.  The  adjacent  rural  population,  including  ethnic  groups  who  have  changed  from  swidden  culture  into  a \nsedentary life style, is now producing sizable crops of watermelons, oranges, bananas, cabbage, etc. \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\n(EIRRs) for roads and drainage works, which constitute 25% of the total Project cost, varies from \n19.26%  to  27.50%,  while  base  case  EIRR  for  the  flood  protection  subproject  was  calculated  as \n33.6%, confirming the economic robustness of the proposed subprojects. Financial internal rates \nof  return  (FIRRs)  for  the  revenue  generating  subcomponents  \u2013  solid  waste  management  and \nseptic disposal improvements \u2013 were found to be financially viable, with base case FIRRs of 8.69 \n- 13.22%, exceeding the weighted average cost of capital, calculated at 4.3%. The results of the \neconomic and financial analyses are presented in Appendix 14. The financial projections for the \nfour phase 1 towns are in Supplementary Appendix E.       \n \nThe  Risks.  Potential  risks  that  may  undermine  or  impede  the  project  impacts  include \n71. \nthose  related  to  (i)  the  reforms  for  decentralized  urban  governance,  (ii)  sustainability  of  urban \ninfrastructure  and  services  in  small  towns  in  general  and  project  facilities  in  particular,  (iii) \ncommunity  attitudes,  and  (iv)  technical  aspects.  The  major  risks  related  to  the  reforms  for \ndecentralized  urban  governance  include  (i)  the  prolonged  process  of  enacting  the  local \nadministration  bill  and  a  level  of  uncertainty  resulting  from  the  use  of  decrees as legal tools to \nimplement  reforms,  and  (ii)  insufficient  concerted  action  to  support  the  process  for  establishing \nand developing UDAAs and mobilizing local resources. The risks to sustainability comprise, (i) the \nembryonic  capacities  of  UDAAs  in  small  towns,  including  the  capacity  for  O&M;  (ii)  overall \ninsufficient funds for O&M, and the insufficient own source revenues of UDAAs; and (iii) lack of \nGovernment support in the form of staffing and transfer of other resources, and lack of technical \nand  advisory  support  to  UDAAs  from  relevant  central  and  provincial  departments.  Community-\nrelated  risks  include  lack  of  community  cooperation  in  the  village  upgrading  component, \nreluctance  to  contribute  to  improvements,  and  lack  of  awareness  of  the  benefits  from \ninvestments.  The  technical  risks  entail  (i)  the  relatively  large  number  of  project  towns  spread \nthroughout a large geographic area, with adverse implications for scarce project and Government \nresources to ensure quality and the participatory processes; and (ii) a centralized mode of project \nimplementation, bypassing UDAAs and other local stakeholders. \n \nTo  mitigate  these  risks,  the  Project  has  devised  a  strategy.  The  strategy  involves  (i)  an \n72. \nurban  policy  and  reform  agenda  and  associated  assurances  agreed  to  by  the  Government  as \nsafeguards for mitigating risks to decentralized urban governance reforms; (ii) a capacity building \ncomponent  devoted  to  help  UDAAs  in  establishing  and  developing  their  technical  and  financial \ncapacities  and  cost  recovery  reforms;  (iii)  specific  measures  of  the  sector  lending  approach \nrequiring the towns\u2019 commitment to UDAA reforms before inclusion in the Project, and operational \nand  financial  action  plans  motivating  the  towns  to  reform;  and  (iv)  project  implementation \narrangements  involving  national  and  provincial  committees  with  greater  potential  to  provide \nbroad-based  and  concerted  support  for  UDAA  reforms.  All  these  measures  also  provide \nsafeguards  to  mitigate  the  risks  to  sustainability  by  addressing  the  technical  and  financial \nrequirements. Strengthening technical capacities of UDAAs in O&M forms an important element \nof  the  capacity  building  program.  The  impact  is  reinforced  by  the  decentralized  project \nimplementation arrangements enabling UDAAs to gain the most from the process and increasing \nthe  towns\u2019  sense  of  ownership  of  the  project  facilities,  resulting  in  sustainability.  The  financial \nrequirements  of  sustainability  are  addressed  through  the  local  resource  mobilization  reforms \nwhose  major  thrust  is  to  provide  secure  and  stable  sources  of  income  for  operating  and \nmaintaining urban infrastructure on a sustainable basis. The measures to mitigate risks related to \ncommunity  attitudes  include  incorporating  into  the  Project  an  extensive  program  of  civic \nawareness  and  community  dialogue,  which  will  motivate  the  communities  to  participate  in  and \ncontribute  to  improvements  and  thus  build  local  capacities  for  community-based  village \nupgrading.  The  risks  related  to  managing  and  implementing  a  project  in  a  large  number  of \ngeographically  scattered  towns  is  mitigated  by  adopting  a  three-stage implementation approach \nthat allows the optimum use of scarce project and Government resources.           \n\n \n\n\f 20\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  Government  has given the following assurances \n\n73. \nwhich are incorporated in the legal documents.    \n \n\nThe  Government,  provincial  governments,  and  UDAAs  concerned  will  undertake \ncertain  reform  actions  as  described  in  the  urban  policy  and  institutional  reform \nagenda (Appendix 5).  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that,  within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  a  PM \nDecree  will  be  issued  to  amend  the  Decree  No.  177/PM,  and  Prime  Minister\u2019s \nOffice  (PMO)  Instruction  No.  141/PMO  to  provide  the  legislative  basis  for \nestablishing UDAAs in district towns with urban socioeconomic characteristics and \nto  remove  the  inconsistencies  between  141/PMO  and  177/PM  regarding  the \nestablishment of UDAAs in provincial capitals.         \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  prior  to  acceptance  into  the  Project,  the  towns \nwill have agreed to establish UDAAs, within one month of confirmation of inclusion \nin the Project. \n\nEach  participating  town  will  have  agreed  to  contribute  to  a  portion  of  the  capital \ncost  of  the  Project  on  the  basis  of  the  town\u2019s loan size and capacity to meet the \ncost of solid waste management and sanitation equipment and vehicle. \n\nTown  participation  in  the  Project,  and  subproject  preparation  and  appraisal  will \nfollow  the  criteria,  procedures,  and  parameters  set  out  in  Appendix  4:  Town \nParticipation and Subproject Preparation and Appraisal. \n\nParticipating  UDAAs  will,  prior  to  the  appraisal  of  their  subproject,  prepare  and \nagree  to  implement  \u201coperational  and  local  revenue  mobilization  plans\u201d  with  set \ntargets  to  gradually  increase  revenues  from  their  own  sources  and  to  strengthen \ntheir technical, operational, and financial management capacities.  \n\nImmediately  upon  the  successful  appraisal  of  their  subproject,  the  UDAAs  will \nbegin  implementing  user  charges  for  solid  waste  collection,  sanitation,  and \nparking;  and  slaughterhouse  fees,  fees  for  lease  of  public  places,  and  hotel  and \nguest house fees;     \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  Government  and  pertinent  provincial  governments  and  UDAAs  will  ensure \nthat,  within  2  years  of  subproject  appraisal,  the  respective  towns  will  begin  (a) \nimplementing  the  special  levies  for  wastewater  and  public  lighting  in  the  form  of \nsurcharges  on  the  electricity  and  water  bills  on  a  consumption  basis,  and  (b) \nimplementing the urban obligation fees.  \n\n \n(viii)  To  ensure  adequate  funds  for  the  maintenance  of  urban  roads  through  a \ncombination  of  fees  and  charges,  including  charges  from  road  users,  the \nGovernment, within 2 years of subproject appraisal in each project town, will begin \nallocating  annually  to  UDAAs,  on  a  permanent  basis  and  according  to  a  rational \nformula, a portion of the monies accrued in the Road Maintenance Fund.  \n\n \n(ix)  Within  6  months  of \n\nthe  Government  and  provincial \ngovernments  will  have  issued  decrees,  instructions,  and  decisions  to  empower \n\nloan  effectiveness, \n\n\f \n\n21 \n\nUDAAs to levy and collect revenues including direct and indirect user charges and \nfees and property-related taxes to recover O&M cost of infrastructure and services \nfor which UDAAs are responsible.  \n\n(x)  Within  3  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government,  based  on  the  study  and \nproposal to be developed by 31 August 2004 by VUDAA for introducing a property \nrelated tax, will prepare a concept plan to introduce this tax in small towns.  \n\n \n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\nThe  Government,  pertinent  provincial  governments,  and  UDAAs  will  ensure  that \nUDAAs will generate sufficient revenues from their own sources to meet (a) within \n2  years  of  subproject  appraisal  30%,  (b)  within  4  years  of  subproject  appraisal \n65%,  and  (c)  within  6  years  of  subproject  appraisal  100%  of  the  cost  that  they \nincur  in  providing  services  and  undertaking  O&M  of  existing  and  project-created \npublic assets including roads and drainage.  \n\nThe  Government  and  provincial  governments  will  provide  UDAAs  with  sufficient \nfunds  to  meet  any  shortfall  between  the  total  expenditure  that  UDAAs  incur  in \nfulfilling their obligations (including their administrative costs and cost of providing \nservices  and  O&M  for  the  existing  infrastructure  and  the  project  assets)  and  the \nrevenue that UDAAs derive from sources available to them. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n74. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB \nand  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special \nDrawing  Rights  12,123,000  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  the  Small  Towns \nDevelopment Sector Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the \nrate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter;

However,  since  the  mid-1980s,  the  expanded  marketing  and  industrial  opportunities \nfollowing  economic  liberalization  stimulated  urban  growth.  As  a  result,  growing  numbers  of  rural \npeople were drawn to the urban areas in search of better livelihoods. Although the economy is still \nlargely rural, with agriculture accounting for some 50% of gross domestic product (GDP), the role \nof the urban sector is growing. During 1997-2001 the industry and services sector components of \nGDP  increased  at  average  annual  rates  of  8  and  6.2%,  respectively,  compared  with  5.3%  for \nagriculture,  implying  productivity  and  greater  opportunities  in  urban  areas.  Vientiane, the capital \ncity,  is  the  largest  urban  center  with  a  population  of  about  200,000.  The  four  largest  provincial \ncapital,  called  secondary  towns,  have  populations  of  20,000  to  60,000.  An  emerging  category of \nurban  settlements  is  the  small  towns2  with  populations  ranging  from  5,000  to  20,000  and  growth \nrates  of  up  to  4.3%  per  annum.  These  towns  perform  critical  administrative  functions,  and  are \neconomic  links  between  the  rural  areas  and  national  and  international  markets.  They  are  the \nlocations  of  immediate  markets,  transport  depots,  and  agricultural  processing  centers  in  the  rural \nhinterland.  With  aggregated  markets  of  relatively  higher  incomes,  these  towns  help  to \ncommercialize and diversify agriculture in the rural region. The research and extension required for \ndiversification and inputs to rural production are supplied in these towns. A large number of rural \npeople  commute  daily  to  these  towns  to  exchange  their  rural  produce  with  urban  goods  and \nservices.  Moreover,  towns  offer  the  rural  poor  labor  markets  during  the  off-farm seasons. The \nnonfarm employment provided in these towns is a sustainable alternative for the Lao PDR, where \necological sustainability is threatened by livelihoods dependent on natural resources.  \n \nA. \n \nOver  the  last  6  years,  the  urban  environment  in  the  Lao  PDR  has  improved  significantly \n2. \nwith  investments  in  Vientiane  and  the  four  secondary  towns.  It  is  estimated  that  ADB\u2019s  second \ninvestment  in  Vientiane,  the  Vientiane  Urban  Infrastructure  and  Services  Project,  will  meet  about \n80%  of  investment  needs,  while  the  past  and  committed  expenditure  in  secondary  towns  is \nestimated  to  meet  about  50%  of  the  investment  needs  until  2010  in  these  towns.  However,  the \nsmaller  urban  centers,  to  date,  have  not  benefited  from  these  investments.  None  of  these  towns \nhas  a  central  or  partial  sewerage  system,  and  existing  on-site  sanitation  systems  are  in  poor \ncondition with no provision for septic waste collection and treatment. The towns vary widely in the \nquality and coverage of drainage, roads, and solid waste management services (Table A2.1). They \nusually have no interconnected drainage networks, resulting in frequent flooding after rainstorms. \nWater in the roadside drains is polluted through poor on-site sanitation systems. Drainage, where it \nexists,  becomes  blocked  with  silt  washed  from  the  unpaved  roads  during  rainy  season.  Only  the \nmain  roads  are  surfaced  and  are  often  in  bad  condition,  while  other  roads,  generally  gravel  or \nearth,  are  invariably  dusty  in  the  dry  season  and  muddy  during  rainy  periods.  Maintenance  of \nurban  roads  and  drainage  is  irregular  and  suffers  from  lack  of  necessary  funding  and  clear \narrangements.  Solid  waste  management  services  are  inadequate  with  no  regular  collection  and \nfinal waste disposal. None of the towns have landfill sites. Town markets, where economic activity \nrevolves and where the poor can sell their produce and offer their services as porters and cleaners, \nare in poor hygienic conditions and lack surfacing, sanitation, drainage, and parking areas. Tertiary \ninfrastructure at the urban village3 level is also inadequate, and has a direct adverse impact on the \nquality  of  life  of  the  communities,  especially  the  poor.  Access  is  generally  poor.  Roads  have \n\nUrban Infrastructure and Services and Investment Requirements  \n\n                                                 \n1 The official definition of urban is ambiguous. The 1995 population census defined a village as urban if (i) it is connected \nto  a  motor  vehicle  road,  electricity,  and  piped  water;  (ii)  it  is  the  location  of  the  district  office;  and  (iii)  it  has  a \nmarketplace.  The  urban  planning  law  defined  towns  and  urban  areas  as  a  place  where  many  people  live  with  a \npopulation density of 30 persons/hectare and a population of at least 2,000 and which has administrative functions of \nbeing provincial or district centers. \n\n2   There are 23 towns in this category. However, the distinction between small towns and secondary towns are not clear-\n\ncut as some have the same administrative importance as provincial capitals and high potential for future growth.  \n3 A village is an urban administrative unit/neighborhood with an elected village head and a population of about 1,000-1,500 people.   \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n(Danida),  Japan \n\nInternational  Cooperation  Agency \n\nearthen  and  undrained  pavements  that  become  quagmires  in  the  wet  season.  Conditions  are \nworse  in  the  poorer  villages,  undermining  the  health  and  productivity  of  the  population  in  small \ntowns.  \n \n3. \nThe  sector  investment  plan  being  prepared  under  the  Project  and  agreed  to  by  the \nGovernment  is  based  on  the  need  for  basic  urban  infrastructure  and  services  until  2010.  Target \nlevels vary between sectors and between the categories of towns, i.e., Vientiane, secondary towns, \nand small towns. Given the scarcity of resources, it is unrealistic in most cases to aim at a target of \n100% coverage. Clearly the targets are simplistic, but they serve as useful, measurable indicators. \nThey  also  reflect  the  priorities  expressed  by  both  local  officials  and  the  communities  during  the \nsurveys and workshops under the project preparatory TA. It is estimated that about $97.0 million is \nrequired to meet the overall urban infrastructure and service needs until 2010. This figure includes \nabout $44.0 million for the investment needs of the 23 small towns, including the further investment \nneeds  of  the  10  project  towns.  The  figures  present  a  fairly  ambitious  capital  investment  program \nthat the Government will find difficult to implement in its entirety. Accordingly, the investments need \nto  be  prioritized  (Table  A2.2).  Currently,  the  Government\u2019s  annual  budgetary  allocation  for  urban \ndevelopment  and  O&M  amounts  to  about  $5-$7  million.  Most  of  the  urban  investment  is  through \nexternal assistance, with ADB as the major development partner in the sector. ADB has a project \nin its future pipeline to meet the basic investment needs of the remaining small towns. In addition \nto  ADB,  possible  sources  of  financing  for  urban  development  include  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme  (UNDP)  and  some  bilaterals,  e.g.,  Danish  International  Development \n(JICA),  and  Norwegian \nAssistance \nDevelopment Agency (NORAD). It is expected that the ADB urban projects, whose major thrust is \nto establish capacities for local resource mobilization with application of user charges and urban-\nbased  taxes,  will  assist  in  the  short  term  the  financing  of  O&M  and  solid  waste  and  septic \nmanagement  investments  while  contributing  in  the  long  term  to  financing  the  overall  sector \ninvestments.             \n \nB. \n \nAnalysis  of  poverty  incidence  in  the  Lao  PDR  indicates  that  about  27%  of  the  urban \n4. \npopulation live below the poverty line. Urban poverty incidence is lowest in Vientiane, at 17%; and \nhighest, at 43%, in the northern region where most of the small towns are. Poverty incidence in the \nproject  area  is  estimated  as  30%.  While  there  are  no  large  aggregate  poor  communities  in  the \nthe  urban  villages,  with  some  villages \nsmall \naccommodating  much  larger  populations  of  the  poor  than  others.  Frequently,  a  few  poor  families \nhuddle behind the homes of wealthier villagers. The poor live on undeveloped plots without street \nfrontage  or  proper  access  roads.  The  plots  are  often  poorly  drained  and  prone  to  flooding. \nConditions are unhygienic, water- and feces-borne diseases are highly prevalent, undermining the \nhealth and income-earning abilities of the poor. Worse, the communities generally are not aware of \nthe links between health and environmental conditions. Lack of access to basic infrastructure and \nservices in small towns is both a cause and a consequence of poverty.  \n \n5. \nWhile economic growth rates are higher in the urban areas than in the rural areas, there is \nevidence  that  economic  growth  has  adversely  affected  the  poor  households  in  the  urban  areas, \nbecause  of  the  subsequent  greater  income  inequality.  A poverty assessment conducted with the \nfeasibility  study  suggests  that  the  most  commonly  expressed  causes  for  poverty  are  lack  of  a \npermanent occupation and a low and irregular income. Usually, physical and social exclusion act \ntogether, resulting in a perpetual poverty cycle of poor access to basic services, poor health, low \nproductivity,  and  low  incomes  of  the  poor.  The  poorest  of  the  poor  depend  on  markets  for  their \nmain  income,  selling  vegetables  and  forest  products,  and  offering  their  labor  as  porters  and \ncleaners. The vast majority of the middle and upper poor  groups are engaged in market vending, \nhome-based microenterprise, and small retail activities. Existing and potential microentrepreneurs, \nhowever,  are  constrained  by  lack  of  access  to  institutional  microfinance  and  associated  services. \n\nUrban Poverty  \n\ntowns,  poverty \n\nis  dispersed \n\nthroughout \n\n\f                                                                                                                    Appendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nSmall  loans  that  these  groups  need  are  not  available  through  the  existing  banking  system.  Most \nhouseholds report finance as a major start-up problem in establishing a livelihood. \n  \n6. \nThe incidence of poverty in small towns results from lack of programs effectively  targeting \nthe poor and addressing the multidimensional nature of poverty. The limited funds in the context of \nlarge-scale  major  infrastructure  needs  have  so  far  not  reached  the  village  level  where  the \ncommunities  would  directly  feel  the  impact  from  investments.  While  lack  of  funds  constrains \nimprovement programs, a major problem is lack of effective strategies that could spark the initiative \nof the poor and mobilize the resources of village communities in improving their environment. The \nrecent  policy  of  the  Government  to  assign  to  villages  a  greater  role  in  development  provides  an \nimmense opportunity to promote new approaches whereby village communities can become active \npartners  in  developing  their  own  villages.  However,  improving  basic  infrastructure  and  services \nalone  will  not  suffice  to  make  a  sustainable  impact  on  the  lives  of  the  poor.  The  poverty \nassessment  highlights  the  linkage  between  poor  environmental  conditions  and  low  incomes.  It  is \nessential that environmental improvements in small towns be complemented with interventions for \nlivelihood promotion so that the improved living conditions of the poor can be sustained.  \n \nC. \n \n7. \nThe  Government  recognizes  the  significance  of  the  urban  areas  in  national development. \nThe  Fifth  Five-Year  Socioeconomic  Plan  (2001-2005)  prioritizes  planning  and  developing  basic \ninfrastructure  and  services  in  urban  areas,  including  small  towns.  The  Government\u2019s  ambitious \ndevelopment goal is to reduce poverty by half by 2005 and eradicate it by 2010. The Government \nis keen on equitable growth and concerned with the important role of small towns in broad-based \nlocal  development.  The  poverty  reduction  partnership  agreement  signed  by  ADB  and  the \nGovernment in September 2001 includes small towns development as one of the key operational \npriorities  to  enhance  reciprocal  linkages  between  urban  and  rural  areas,  more  specifically  to  (i) \nintegrate  rural  producers  with  urban  markets,  (ii)  enable  urban  entrepreneurs  to  trade  with  rural \npeople,  and  (iii)  facilitate  access  of  the  rural  and  urban  population  to  international  markets.  It  is \nacknowledged that this vision requires interventions to meet basic human needs and stimulate the \neconomy in small towns.  \n\nUrban Policy, Governance, and Finance   \n\n  \n8. \nIncreasing urbanization led to the Government\u2019s recognition of the need for improved urban \nmanagement.  As  a  result,  urban  governance  in  the  Lao  PDR  has  undergone  a  major  transition \nover the last 6 years. Until recently MCTPC and its departments were responsible for planning and \nmanaging  urban  as  well  as  rural  areas.  In  1995,  the  Government  launched  a  program  of \ndecentralization  and  has  established  urban  development  administration  authorities  (UDAAs)  in \nVientiane  and  four  secondary  towns,  with  the  aim  to  eventually  transform  them into autonomous \nurban local governments. The Government's commitment to decentralization has been reflected in \na number of prime ministerial (PM) decrees, instructions, notifications, and policy statements. Most \nsignificant for the decentralization process are decrees 177/PM issued in 1997 and 14/PM in 1999, \nthe operational instructions of 141/PM issued in 2000, the PMO Notice of 1461/PMO and Ministry \nof  Finance  Decision  of  2083,  both  issued  in  October  2002.  These  decrees  recognize  UDAAs  as \nlegal entities solely responsible for urban areas, and define them as organizations within provincial \nand prefectural administrative apparatuses. UDAAs are delegated tasks to plan and manage urban \ndevelopment,  and  to  provide  infrastructure  and  services,  including  roads,  drainage,  solid  waste \nmanagement  and  sanitation,  environmental  protection,  public  lighting,  and  maintenance  of  urban \nassets.  Moreover,  the  decrees  empower  UDAAs  to  raise  revenues,  within  the  levels  set  by  the \ncentral  Government,  from  a  range  of  sources  including  service  fees  and  charges,  income  from \nmovable or immovable property, sharing of national taxes, getting loans, local and foreign grants, \nand  funds  from  the  central  Government.  UDAAs  are  entrusted  with  using  these  funds  to  perform \ntheir tasks. Finally, the decrees also give guidelines on the organizational and working procedures \nof UDAAs.  \n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n9. \nThe Government regards decentralization not only as a means for effective management, \nbut also a strategy for equitable growth and poverty reduction. It is now in the process of redefining \nthe role and culture of the Government, and rationalizing central-local relations. In the framework of \ndecentralization, villages are also underlined as the lowest levels of Government located within the \nproximity of urban communities and an important point of interface between the community and the \nGovernment.  Villages  are  envisaged  to  play  an  important  role  in  planning  and  monitoring \ndevelopment  activities  to  ensure  that  development  is  equitable  and  participatory.  Within  the \nframework  of  the  foregoing  decrees,  UDAAs  have  been  gradually  developing  themselves.  They \nhave  made  varying  levels  of  progress,  with  the  Vientiane  UDAA  (VUDAA)  being  at  a  most \nadvanced  stage  in  terms  of  organizational  and  technical  competence  as  well  as  local  revenue \nmobilization reforms. Since January 2001, VUDAA has levied and collected a wide range of direct \nand  indirect  user  charges  and  fees,  including  charges  for  solid  waste  collection,  desludging \nservices;  and  fees  for  vehicle  parking,  building  permits,  advertising  signs,  lease  of  public  land, \nurban  obligation  fees  from  all  buildings  and  commercial  outlets,  and  surcharges  for  water, \nelectricity, and fuel. These initiatives in the urban sector are also supportive of the national goals of \nthe  Government  for  domestic  resource  mobilization  to  finance  recurrent  expenditures  for  social \ndevelopment and to sustain existing physical assets.    \n \nHowever,  small  urban  centers  to  date  have  not  benefited  from  these  reforms.  Urban \n10. \nplanning  and  provision  of  infrastructure  and  services  still  remain  within  the  responsibility  of  the \nprovincial  and  district  departments  of  the  MCTPC.  These  departments,  with  limited  staff  and \nresources  and  widespread  responsibility  for  both  urban  and  rural  areas  in  their  respective \nprovinces and districts, cannot cope with the diverse demands of the rapidly growing and densely \npopulated towns that require dedicated management. The departments rely on the Government for \ntheir budget for providing and maintaining infrastructure. But there is little relationship between the \nbudget  requirements  and  the  allocations  actually  received.  There  is  no  separate  budget  for \nmaintaining  urban  infrastructure,  and  maintenance  is  severely  underfunded.  The  degree  of  cost \nrecovery is minimal with user charges in most towns being confined to solid waste collection. In the \nabsence  of  separate  accounts  maintained  for  the  services,  it  is  not  possible  to  establish  a \nrelationship  between  revenues  and  cost  of  services.  The  situation  is  aggravated  by  the \npredominantly  rural  background  of  small  towns  communities  who  are  not  accustomed  to  the \nbenefits  of  urban  services  for  which  they  are  reluctant  to  pay.  In  sum,  the  current  centralized \ninstitutional framework is not conducive to efficient service delivery and mobilizing local resources, \nand exacerbates the poor living conditions and state of infrastructure and services in small towns.  \n \n11. \nThere  is  need  to  extend  the  urban  sector  reforms  to  the  small  towns.  The  reforms  to  be \npursued should build on the existing reforms, and incorporate lessons learned from earlier efforts. \nThe  experience  with  UDAA  reforms  suggests  the  need  for  further  concerted  efforts  if  the \nmomentum  of  the  reforms  would  be  maintained.  By  their  comprehensive  nature,  decentralization \nreforms  require  technical,  financial,  and  legal  interventions  by  a  number  of  agencies  at  various \nlevels. The lack of an encompassing and permanent legal framework for urban local governments \nremains  an  issue,  and  has  to  be  resolved  in  the  medium  term  to  secure  urban  policy  and \ninstitutional reforms steadily evolving and operating over the last 6 years on the basis of decrees \nand  decisions.  The  review  of  past  efforts  also  shows  that  the  commitments  made  through  a \nnumber  of  PM  decrees  and  decisions  have  not  always  been  simultaneously  supported  by  other \nconcerned agencies within the Government. While the financial and technical progress of VUDAA \nwas relatively promising, the progress of UDAAs in some secondary towns has been constrained, \nin some cases, by inadequate support of provincial governments or, in other cases, inability of the \nconcerned  line  ministries  to  actually  transfer  the  assets,  resources,  staff,  and  revenue  collection \nfunction to UDAAs. In sum, the scale of reforms toward an entirely distinct system of decentralized \nurban  governance  in  the  Lao  PDR  necessitates  more  dialogue  and  extensive  support  for  the \nreforms and long-term assistance for building the capacity of UDAAs.   \n \n \n\n\f                                                                                                                    Appendix 2

To achieve the target, a systematic approach identified the small towns that will \nqualify  for  inclusion  in  the  Project.  Preparing  the  long  list  of  small  towns  followed  a  two-stage \nprocess. Throughout the country there are over 140 urban centers that are either provincial or \ndistrict capitals. However, the majority of these towns are largely rural in character. Therefore, \nfirst, a population threshold of 5,000 was used for initial screening. This exercise produced a list \nof  42  towns.  Second,  more  comprehensive  criteria  were  applied  to  determine  which  of  the  42 \ntowns have stronger urban characteristics and have the potential for broad-based development. \nThe  criteria  broadly  included  (i)  administrative  importance,  i.e.,  either  district  or  provincial \ncapital;  (ii)  provincial  poverty  index;  (iii)  population  and  rank  in  size  in  the  province;  and  (iv) \ntowns\u2019 regional, subregional, and local role. As a result, 23 towns were identified. These towns \nform the long list of eligible towns from which the project towns were and will be selected on the \nbasis of further criteria described in the following paragraphs.  \n \nUrban towns to be included in the Project will need to demonstrate their commitment to \n2. \nthe Project as well as to urban policy and institutional reforms. More specifically, the towns will \nbe  required  (i)  to  agree  to  establishing  urban  development  administration  authorities (UDAAs) \nand  gradually  strengthening  their  capacity;  (ii)  to  commit  to  increasing  locally  generated \nrevenues to gradually cover their operation and maintenance (O&M) costs by implementing cost \nrecovery measures and applying user fees, charges, and other urban based taxes; and (iii) to \nagree to contribute in cash or in kind to a portion of the cost of the capital works to cover the \nvehicle and equipment cost of solid waste management and sanitation/investments.  \n \nB. \n \nUDAAs will identify the subproject1 components to be located in the participating towns; \n3. \nfeasibility  studies  will  be  prepared  by  the  project  implementing  units  (PIU)  in  UDAAs  with \nassistance  from  the  consultants;  appraised  by  the  project  coordination  unit  in  MCTPC  and \napproved by ADB. Upon acceptance into the Project each UDAA will prepare management and \nrevenue plans, to ensure that UDAAs take timely actions to progressively achieve the targeted \nrevenues  and  institutional  capacities  in  terms  of  staffing,  technical  skills,  managerial \ncompetence,  and  operating  and  working  procedures.  Subproject  preparation  and  component \nselection will follow a process of community consultation involving a range of participatory tools \nto ensure that the subproject reflect the perceived needs and demands of all stakeholders.  \n \n4. \nThe  components  of  subprojects  eligible  for  financing  under  the  Project  include  roads, \npublic  and  street  lighting,  bridges,  drainage,  improvements  to  public  market  and  bus  station \nenvironments  (without  improvements  to  buildings),  solid  waste  and  septic  management \nimprovements,  and  tertiary-level  infrastructure  and  service  improvements  in  selected  villages. \nAfter  the  subproject  components  qualified  for  funding  under  the  Project  are  identified,  the \nPIU/UDAA with technical support from the consultants will proceed with subproject preparation \nand  feasibility  studies.  PCU  will  appraise  the  subproject  proposal  and  feasibility  and  submit \nappraisal  reports  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval.  The  reports should include (i) the rationale, \n(ii)  environmental \nimplementation  and  procurement  arrangements; \nscope,  cost,  and \n\nSubproject Preparation and Appraisal \n\n                                                 \n1  \u201cSubproject\u201d  refers  to  an  integrated  package  of \n\nfinancing. Each participating town will have one subproject.   \n\ninvestment  including  a  number  of  components  qualified  for \n\n\f                                                                                                                                         Appendix 4 \n\n33\n\nassessments;  (iii)  economic  and  financial  justification;  (iv)  social  impact  assessment  and \nresettlement  plan,  if  necessary;  (v)  UDAA  financial  assessments  for  O&M  costs  and  debt \nservice  associated  with  the  proposed  subproject;  and  (vi)  operational  and  local  revenue \nmobilization  plans  setting  the  UDAAs  target  to  increase  their  revenue  and  strengthen  their \ntechnical  financial  and  staffing  capacity  gradually.  After  ADB  endorses  the  subproject,  the \nUDAA will sign a subsidiary loan agreement with the ministries of finance and communication, \ntransport, posts, and construction regarding the loan and grant component of the subproject. \n \n The following technical parameters should be considered during subproject preparation \n5. \nand  appraisal:  (i)  subprojects  will  respond  to  the  highest  priority  infrastructure  and  service \ninvestments identified under the town development frameworks and be directly aimed at poverty \nreduction, social development or improved economic opportunities for the town populations; (ii) \nthe size and scope of subprojects for each town will be determined by affordability to the towns\u2019 \nadministrations as well as town populations, to be supported by financial capacity assessments, \nin any case,  the  physical  investments  expenditure  for  each  town  will  not  exceed  $1.5  million, \nunless  it  is  justified  through  subproject  appraisal  reports  and  approved  by  ADB;  (iii)  for  all \ncomponents, the first priority will be upgrading existing facilities and strengthening their service \ncapability  before  the  systems  are  reconstructed  and  expanded;  (iv)  in  the  case  of  solid  waste \nmanagement  and  septic  desludging  and  disposal  and  treatment  components,  O&M  plans, \nbudget  requirements,  and  sources  of  funds  to  meet  the  budget  and  a  commitment  letter  from \nUDAAs  to  implement    the  O&M  plans  and  avail  of  the  required  budgets  including  incremental \nrevenues  to  be  obtained  through  user  charges  must  be  prepared;  (v)  the  subproject \ncomponents in each town must use appropriate technology and represent the least-cost option; \n(vi)  economic  analysis  should  be  undertaken  for  both  revenue-  and  nonrevenue-generating \ncomponents exceeding $150,000 and when benefits are quantifiable; and (vii) financial analysis \nshould  be  conducted  for  revenue-generating  components;  financial  returns  should  be  greater \nthan the rate of the weighted average cost of capital unless there are affordability constraints, in \nwhich  case,  the  financial  interest  rates  of  return  (FIRR)  should  be  as  high  as  possible  within \nthese constraints. Where user charges are associated with specific subcomponents, the users\u2019 \nwillingness to pay for the services should be proven in accordance with the overall cost recovery \ngoals and targets of the Project (see Assurances).         \n \nIn  addition,  social  and  environmental  parameters  and  safeguards  to  consider  during \n7. \nsubproject preparation and appraisal include the following: (i) areas of environmental sensitivity, \ncultural  heritage,  existing  and  potential  tourist  resources  will  be  avoided,  and  where  negative \nenvironmental  impacts  are  unavoidable,  mitigation  measures  will  be  taken  to  minimize  the \nimpacts; (ii) an initial environmental examination will be prepared as part of the feasibility study \nin  each  town,  in  accordance  with  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  and  relevant \nADB  guidelines  and  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  agreed  to  by  the \nGovernment; this should be forwarded to ADB together with the subproject appraisal report; (iii) \nthe subproject will have no significant negative social impact such as loss of productive assets \nand  livelihood,  and  physical  displacement  of  people,  and  will  minimize  resettlement  and  land \nacquisition  by  exploring  alternative  approaches;  where \nis  unavoidable, \nresettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  frameworks  of  the \nSummary Resettlement Plan and Detailed Resettlement Plan (Appendix 8 and Supplementary \nAppendix D) and ADB\u2019s policy and guidelines on involuntary resettlement; and (iv) if indigenous \npeople are likely to be affected, an indigenous peoples plan will be prepared and forwarded to \nADB  together  with  the  subproject  appraisal  report,  in  accordance  with  relevant  laws  and \nregulations and with ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples; and (v) village selection for the village \nupgrading component will follow the agreed upon criteria as set out in Supplementary Appendix \nB.     \n \n \n\nresettlement \n\n\f URBAN INSTITUTIONAL AND POLICY REFORM AGENDA    \n\nObjective /

The Government\u2019s goals are to reduce poverty by 50% by 2005, to eradicate it by 2010, and to enable the Lao PDR to graduate \nfrom being a least developing country to a developing country by 2020. ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program for the Lao PDR and \nthe poverty reduction partnership agreement signed by the Government and ADB state that efforts will be directed toward reducing \npoverty by broadening community participation and opportunities during the next 5 years. The operational priorities to achieve these \ngoals are (i) rural development and market linkages; (ii) human resource development; (iii) sustainable environmental management; \nand  (iv)  regional  integration.  The  Project  aims  to  contribute  to  these  operational  priorities  by  providing  strategically  located  small \ntowns  with  basic  infrastructure  and  environmental  amenities  and  capacity-building  assistance,  whereby  (i)  rural  producers better \nintegrate with national and international markets; (ii) human development is enhanced; and (iii) nonfarm economy is strengthened, \npresenting a sustainable alternative for the country where ecological sustainability is threatened by livelihoods dependent on natural \nresources.  \n \nB.

Approximately  38%  of  the  Lao  PDR  population  of  5  million  live  below  the  poverty  line,  estimated  to  be  equal  to  KN19,184  per \nperson  per  month  for  the  country  as  a  whole  in  1997/98.  Evidence  confirms  the  large  rural-urban  disparity  in  the  incidence  of \npoverty\u201427%  in  the  urban  areas  compared  with  41%  in  the  rural  areas.  However,  further  analysis  shows  that  the  rate  of  poverty \nreduction in the urban areas has been slower, mainly due to the higher income inequality that has accompanied the faster pace of \neconomic  growth.1  Urban  poverty2  incidence  is  lowest  in  Vientiane  (16.7%),  and  highest  in  the  northern  region  (43.27%).  Urban \npoverty in the central and southern regions are 27.65% and 35.84%, respectively. While the percentage of the urban poor is generally \ndeclining, the depth and severity of poverty in the northern and southern regions have worsen, clearly indicating that these regions are \nstill largely isolated from the benefits of the country\u2019s overall economic growth. \n \n3.  A  poverty  assessment,  conducted  in  the  pilot  small  towns,  under  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance,  indicates  that  the \npoverty incidence in the project towns is 30%, higher than the national urban poverty incidence. The assessment reveals that urban \npoverty is characterized by (i) lack of permanent occupation; (ii) insufficient and irregular income; (iii) limited access to education and \nhealth  care;  (iv)  deficient  basic  infrastructure and services such as roads and footpaths, sanitation and solid waste collection and \ndisposal  systems,  and  flood  protection  works;  (v)  inadequate  nonfarm  employment  opportunities;  and  (vi)  lack  of  ownership  of \nproductive assets. While there are no aggregate squatter areas in the towns in the traditional sense, poverty is dispersed throughout \nthe  urban  villages,  with  some  villages  accommodating  much  larger  populations  of  the  poor  than  others.  Frequently,  a  few  poor \nfamilies huddle behind the homes  of wealthier villagers. The poor live on undeveloped plots without street frontage or proper access \nroads. These plots are often poorly drained and prone to flooding. Conditions are unhygienic; water- and feces-borne diseases are \nhighly  prevalent,  undermining  health  and  income-earning opportunities.  In  most  cases  physical  and  social  exclusion  act  together, \nresulting in a perpetual poverty cycle of poor access to basic infrastructure and services, poor health, and poor living conditions, low \nproductivity,  and  low  incomes   of  the  poor.  The  poorest  of  the  poor  depend  on  markets  and  forests  as  their  main  income,  selling \nvegetables, and forest products and offering their labor as porters and cleaners. The medium poor can be subject to volatility, earning \nsome money but vulnerable to changing external conditions. The simple poor are slightly better off, but yet cannot escape from the \nperpetual  poverty  cycle.  The  poverty  assessment  indicates  that  the  poor  in  small  towns  unanimously  prioritize  the  lack  of  basic \ninfrastructure and services and the low incomes as the most severe problems that need to be addressed.     \n \n5.  The Project adopts a highly pro-poor approach and will contribute significantly to poverty reduction by addressing the physical and \nsocial barriers adversely  affecting  the  urban  poor  in  the  Lao  PDR,  thereby  enabling  them  to  improve  their  overall  living  conditions. \nSpecific  pro-poor  features  include  (i)  prioritizing  the  towns  with  higher  levels  of  poverty  for  inclusion  in  the  Project;  (ii)  prioritizing \nsubprojects  with  higher  poverty  reduction  impact;  (iii)  promoting  inclusive  processes  through  an  extensive  community  dialogue  and \npartnering  program,  accompanying  physical  investments;  (iv)  integrated  interventions  addressing  the  multidimensional  nature  of \npoverty; (v) direct targeting of the poor within towns through village upgrading and the livelihood promotion program; (vi) promoting \ngood  governance  by  establishing  in  small  towns  decentralized  urban  development  administration  authorities  leading  to  more \nresponsive  urban  management;  and  (vii)  assigning  a  greater  role  to  villages,  hence  promoting  partnership  with  communities  and \ncatalyzing the resources of the community for village-level improvements.  \n\n \n\n1   This is not the case for the rural areas where the incidence of poverty was reduced more rapidly due to a lower increase in inequality.   \n2  The  definition  urban  poverty  is  based  on  the  equivalent  income  needed  to  purchase  2,100  calories  per  person  per  day  plus  some  expenditure  for \n\nnonfood items according to the ADB Participatory Poverty Assessment, Lao PDR, 2001.  \n\n\f                                                                                                                                              Appendix 6 \n\n37 \n\n \n6.  The poverty impact analysis 3 shows that the road improvements under the Project\u2019s town infrastructure and amenities component \nwill directly enhance the mobility of an estimated 425, 500 urban poor, or 30% of the urban population in small towns, by increasing \ntheir access to income-earning opportunities. This will arrest the worsening income inequality in small towns. Drainage improvements \nwill  have  a  profound  impact  on  the  lives  of  the  same  urban  poor  population  who  tend  to  live  on  low-lying land, prone to frequent \nflooding. Improved solid waste management and septic disposal systems and provision of more public toilets in the markets and bus \nstations will decrease the frequency of illnesses among the urban poor households and, reduce the medical expenses associated with \nsuch  illnesses.  About  60  villages  with  higher  levels  of  poverty  will  be  targeted  for  village  upgrading,  providing  its  estimated  69,000 \nresidents  with  access  roads,  paved  roads  and  footpaths,  and  a  drainage  system,  leading  to  their  enhanced  mobility,  reduced  flood \ndamages,  and  improved  health and sanitation conditions. The livelihood promotion subcomponent will provide an estimated 1,500 \nurban  poor  households  (a  total  of  8,400  urban  poor)  with  microfinance  services,  including  social  intermediation  and  loans  of  $200-\n$300  to  assist  them  in  acquiring  productive  assets  or  working  capital  to  start  viable  livelihood  enterprises.  Moreover,  an  estimated \n127,000 rural poor will indirectly benefit due to (i) better road conditions facilitating their access to the urban markets for marketing \ntheir  agricultural  outputs  and  for  increased  knowledge  on  selling,  buying,  and  competing  in  the  marketplace  and  (ii)  improved \nenvironment and services in small towns where a significant number of rural people commute on a daily basis.  \n\n \nC. Participation Process \n\n \nStakeholder Analysis Prepared:                                                                                                         Yes  \n \n7.  A stakeholder analysis was conducted during the project preparatory technical assistance to identify stakeholders as well as their \nroles,  interests,  preferences,  and  aspirations.  The  primary  stakeholders  are  (i)  the  general  public  who  will  be  directly  or  indirectly \nbenefiting from project interventions as well as the few families who will be resettled as a result of the Project; (ii) village chiefs and \norganizations  who  will  be  both  recipients  and  players  of  a  major  role  in  the  village  upgrading  component;  (iii)  urban  development \nadministration authorities, to be established in each project town, which will be the implementing agencies for the Project and which \nwill  gradually  become  competent  urban  local  governments;  and  (iv)  members  of  mass  organizations,  especially  the  Lao  Women\u2019s \nUnion at the village level. The stakeholders meetings demonstrated much interest in and support for the Project from village leaders, \ncommunities,  and  members  of  the  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union.  A  poverty  assessment  conducted  during  the  technical  assistance  also \nidentified the needs and priorities of various groups including the poor and the vulnerable. The inputs solicited from the stakeholders \nwere incorporated into the project design.  \n \n8.    Secondary  project  stakeholders  include  the  members  of  central,  provincial,  and  district  authorities,  e.g.,  representatives  of  the \nMinistry  of  Communication,  Transport,  Posts,  and  Construction,  the  executing  agency,  and  other  line  ministries;  the  provincial \ngovernors, district chiefs, and other provincial and district officials. The stakeholder analysis indicated substantial support from various \nlevels of government  agencies for the Project as well as its poverty focus and institutional reforms to be pursued under the Project. \nPrivate  sector  representatives,  who  are  likely  to  be  engaged  in  some  urban  service  delivery  activities  under  the  Project,  also \nexpressed their willingness to be involved in the Project.     \n \nParticipation Strategy:                                                                                                                        Yes \n \n9.  During the feasibility study stage, two rounds of workshops were conducted at the village and town levels in the pilot small towns, \nalong with less formal consultations, village transect walks, focus group discussions, and individual interviews. Consultations with the \nstakeholders  and  affected  persons  were  undertaken  to  collect  the  necessary  information  and  assess  potential  project  benefits  and \npossible  adverse  effects.  The  needs  and  recommendations  of  major  stakeholders  were  recorded  for  project  design  and  for  further \ndissemination  to  concerned  parties.  The  consultations  sought  much-needed  stakeholder  feedback  and  subsequent  stakeholder \nsupport for the proposed Project by involving them in the planning and design processes.   \n \n10.    The  Project  will  continue  to  use  participatory  strategies  so  as  (i)  to  ensure  that  the  improvements  are  responsive  to  the \ncommunity demands and (ii) to develop in the towns a sense of ownership of the project assets and subsequent sustainability. The \ncommunity dialogue program will target the towns\u2019 residents by disseminating information on project activities while providing periodic \nfeedback  from  town  residents  into  each  stage  of  the  project  implementation,  i.e.,  subproject  selection  and  preparation,  detailed \ndesign, and construction. The community dialogue program at the town level will be fostered by community partnering at the village \nlevel  to  enable  communities  to  become  active  partners  in  village  improvements.  The  program  will  assist  in  building  the  capacity  of \nvillage  organizations  and  communities  to  participate  in  village  planning  and  decision-making,  choice  of  designs,  procurement, \noperation  and  maintenance,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities.  The  villages  will  be  assisted  in  establishing  village-working \ncommittees and cost-sharing mechanisms. The village committees will have a proportionate representation of the poor and women as  \n \n\n \n\n3  The  poverty  impact  analysis  adopted  a  head  count  approach,  which  estimated  the  poor  benefited  from  the  Project  as  a  proportion  of  the  total \nbeneficiaries.  This  methodology  is  second  best  to  the  calculation  of  a  poverty  impact  ratio  (PIR),  which  was  not  applied  because    (i)  there  were no \nfinancial revenues associated with the road and drainage subprojects and (ii) the economic benefits of the solid waste and sanitation subprojects were \ndifficult to quantify in the Lao PDR. Both factors made the rigorous application of the distribution of benefits and poverty impact analysis impracticable \n(ADB Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact Assessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects). \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nwell as other vulnerable groups. The program will train village leaders and key resource persons including women members as well \nas  the  staff  of  urban  development  administration  authorities.  Existing  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  structures  in  villages  and  NGOs  with \nrelevant skills and experience will also be utilized in the processes of community dialogue and partnering. \n \n11.    Participation  of  secondary  stakeholders,  i.e.,  central  Government  agencies  concerned,  will  be  through  a  national  steering \ncommittee consisting of the representatives of these agencies. Provincial and district authorities, whose support to the Project and the \nnew  urban  development  administration  authorities  is  vital,  will  be  involved  in  the  Project  through  provincial  project  facilitating \ncommittees. \n \n \n \nIssue \n \n \nResettlement \n \n\n \nD. Potential Issues \n \n\n \nOutput Prepared \n\n \nNon-\nsignificant \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nIssue \nLevel \n\n \n\n \nResettlement \nplan, comprising \nof resettlement \nframework (RF) \nand short \nresettlement plan \n(RP) for each \nsubproject \ninvolving \nresettlement  \nSee Appendix 8: \nResettlement Plan  \n\n \nIssues:  From  the  feasibility  study  for  the  four  pilot  towns,  res ettlement needs \nappear minimal. The total number of families affected by the Project in the four \npilot  towns  is  39,  of  which  only  3  families  need  to  be  relocated  for  the \nconstruction of a bridge in Xam Neua. In Pakxanh, 25 families will be marginally \naffected  by  the  loss  of  70  square  meters  each  from  their  garden  necessary  for \nthe  construction  of  a  small  flood  protection  bank.  Construction  of  a  solid  waste \ndisposal site in Xay will require 6 hectares (ha) of agricultural land and affect 10 \nfarmers  cultivating  the  area,  while  the  landfill  site  in  Vang  Vieng  will  need \nanother  5  ha  owned  by  the  Government.  The  cost  of  resettlement  and  land \nacquisition  in  the  four  towns  is  estimated  at  $42,000.  No  resettlement  plan  is \nneeded for Phonsavan as improvement works are in the existing rights -of-way. \n \nStrategy:  A  resettlement  framework  providing  compensation  and  entitlement \npolicies  and  procedural  guidelines,  which  will  be  applicable  to  all  subprojects \nunder  the  sector  loan,  was  prepared.  A  short  resettlement  plan  following the \nresettlement  framework  was  prepared  for  each  of  the  four  subprojects.  Major \nprinciples are to (i) avoid or minimize involuntary resettlement and loss of assets \nand/or  income  as  much  as  possible;  (ii)  carry  out  resettlement  to  improve  or  at \nleast  restore  the  preproject  living  standards  of  affected  people  (APs);  (iii)  fully \ninform and consult closely with APs in preparing the resettlement plans; and (iv) \nprovide  adequate  compensation,  at  least  at  replacement  rates  to  all  persons \naffected through loss of assets or income capacities. See Appendix 8. \n \nIssues:  Women\u2019s  interests  can  be  at  risk  if  they  (i)  miss  out  on  technical  and \norganizational  innovations  that  come  with  the  Project;  (ii)  miss  out  on  the \nbenefits  of  the  Project;  (iii)  are  left  out  in  the  decision-making process, which \naffects their lives, including labor and assets.  \n \nStrategy:  The  Project  will  entail  efforts  to  ensure  that  women  and  men  benefit \nequally from Project, and that the Project\u2019s process is used to enhance women\u2019s \nrole in the development process in the Lao PDR. The Project\u2019s gender strategy \naims  to  (i)  mitigate  the  risk  that  women  will  be  disadvantaged  by  project \ninterventions;  (ii)  ensure  women\u2019s  participation  in  community  dialogue  and \npartnering activities, e.g., meetings and training on an equal basis with men; (iii) \nensure equal representation  of  women  (at  least  40%  representation)  in  village \ncommittees;  (iv)  promote  men  working  together  with  women  in  the  Project;  (v) \nprioritize women in livelihood promotion; and (vi) carry out gender training and \nintegration  programs  with  the  assistance  of  the  gender  resources  information \ndevelopment (GRID) center under the Lao Women\u2019s Union. \n  \nPotential  Impact:  Given  the  dominant  role  of  Lao  women  in  household \nmanagement,  women  will  be  the  primary  recipients  of  the  benefits  from \ninfrastructure and service improvements, especially improvements to solid waste \nand  sanitation  management.  They  will  be  a  major  target  group  for  the  village \nupgrading  and  civic  awareness  and  community  dialogue  activities.  Being  the \nprincipal sellers in markets, women in small towns and from adjacent rural areas \nlabor-intensive  project \nwill  benefit \nconstruction,  accompanied  with  wide  publicity  on  job  opportunities  and  rules  to \nprioritize  women  and  the  poor  in  these  jobs,  will  benefit  women  who  are \naccustomed  to  physical  labor.

Urban poverty is primarily characterized by lack of permanent occupation, \nlow and irregular incomes, and limited ability to mobilize local resources.  \n \nStrategies: Strategies to address the affordability constraints are to (i) improve \nthe  income-generating  ability  of  the  targeted  urban  poor  households  by \nenhancing their capacity to access and to productively use microfinance services \nfor  livelihood  promotion;  (ii)  incorporate  innovative  financing  measures  to \naddress affordability, such as allowing the poor to contribute resources in kind in \nthe  village  infrastructure  subcomponent;  (iii)  promote  the  development  of  labor-\nbased  construction  techniques;  (iv)  enable  village  contracting  mechanisms  to \nimplement solid waste management that allows poor households of the  villages \nto  pay  in  accordance  with  their  capacity;  (v)  adopt  pro-poor user charges and \nfees \nthe  urban \nfacilitate  cross  subsidization;  and  (vi)  strengthen \ndevelopment administration authorities (UDAAs) to enable them to operate on a \nsustainable  basis,  guided  by  the  principle  of  self-sufficiency in meeting the full \noperation and management costs for providing urban infrastructure and services, \nwith minimum funding support from the Government.  \n \nIssues:  The  poverty  and  social  assessment,  conducted  under  the  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance,  indicates  that  the  participating  towns  vary \nwidely  in  size  and  ethnic  composition  of  the  population.  Ethnic  groups  are  not \nconfined to certain areas, but are spread relatively evenly throughout the villages \nin  each  town.  An  exception  to  this  is  found  in  villages  at  the  outskirts  of  towns \nwhere  more  ethnic  minorities  tend  to  live  together  as  a  result  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s policy of promoting migration of ethnic groups from the highlands \nlocations along main roads. The assessment examined the relationship between \npoverty  and  ethnicity.  The  dominant  groups  in  the  poorest  villages  were \ncompared  with  dominant  groups  in  all  villages.  In  the  poorest  villages,  Lao \nSuung  are  found  as  the  majority  in  some  villages  in  Xai  and  Pek  and  in  equal \nnumbers  to  Lao  Theung  in  Namtha.  In  Paxhan,  the  population  in  the  poores t \nvillages  is  nearly  100%  Lao  Loum,  confirming  the  socioeconomic  data  for  all \nvillages and leading to the conclusion that there is no direct correlation between \npoverty  and  ethnic  minorities  in  the  towns.    Moreover,  a  careful  examination  of \nindividual and joint project components in relation to the composition and spread \nof population in towns indicates no adverse impact on ethnic groups. \n    \nStrategy:  As  part  of  the  pro-poor strategy of the Project, special measures will \nbe  adopted  to  ensure  that  ethnic  minorities  will  benefit  equally  from  project \ninterventions. Civic awareness, community dialogue, and partnering activities will \ninvolve  specific  approaches  to  effectively  communicate  with  ethnic  minorities. \nSelection  of  villages  for  upgrading  will  be  based,  in part, on the percentage of \nethnic minorities. The principle of proportionate representation of ethnic groups \nin  village  committees  will  be  strictly  followed  under  the  community-led village \nupgrading  program.  Where  the  percentage  of  ethnic  minorities  is  high, \nnongovernment organizations with experience in working with ethnic minorities \nwill be sought for the community dialogue and partnering programs.  \n \n\n \n(i) Livelihood \npromotion \n(ii) Village \nupgrading \nincorporating \ninnovative \nfinancing \nmeasures to \naddress \naffordability \n(iii) Pro-poor rates \nfor user \ncharges/fees (iv) \nVillage contracts \nfor solid waste \nmanagement \n \n\n \nNo indigenous \nplan is required for \nthe identified sub-\nprojects. \n \nHowever, sub-\nprojects that are \nlikely to affect \nethnic minorities \nwill be required to \nsubmit an \nindigenous plan \nbefore the \nsubproject is \napproved. \n \n\n \nAffordability \n \n\n \nSignificant \n\n \nUncertain \n\n \nIndigenous \npeoples/ \nEthnic \nminorities/ \nVulnerable  \ngroups  \n \n\n \n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nIn accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines, an initial environmental examination (IEE) was carried \nout as part of Project preparation. The IEE incorporates three elements:  (i) a general IEE for the \nProject  overall;  (ii)  sample  IEEs  for  two  subprojects  whose  feasibilities  were  undertaken  (not \nincluded  in  this  summary  IEE)  during  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance;  and  (iii)  an \nenvironmental management and monitoring plan (EMMP).  The last is required as this is a sector \nloan. The EMMP provides guidelines for subprojects to be prepared during project implementation. \nThe initial screening of the potential environmental impacts of the subprojects prepared for the four \ntowns indicates that the Project will have few negative impacts on the physical, biological, or social \nenvironments.  It  will  have  a  net  positive  impact  on  the  ecology  of  the  surrounding  areas  and  a \nsignificant overall effect on the physical environment. \n \nB. \n \nThe project objective is to improve the urban environment and infrastructure and services in \n2. \nselected  small  towns,  and  establish  decentralized  urban  institutions.  It  has  six  components:  only \nthree are considered to have potential environmental impacts, the others are in the management or \nsoftware category. The three components are (i) town infrastructure and amenities, involving road \nand  drainage  works  and  improvements  to  the  public  markets  and  bus  station  environments;  (ii) \ntown cleanliness/environmental services, including improvements to solid waste management and \nsanitation  and  construction  of  landfill  and  septic  disposal  sites;  and  (iii)  community-led  village \nupgrading, with improvements to tertiary infrastructure and services. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nPhysical Environment:  All  project  towns  are  classified  as  urban  or  semiurban.  They  are \ncharacterized  by  low-  rise  development  with  occasional  medium-rise  development  containing \nsignificant areas of poor quality infrastructure and housing, interspersed with small areas of open \nwasteland  and  urban  agriculture,  particularly  rice  paddy.  Annual  rainfall  ranges  from  1,000 \nmillimeter (mm) to 2,800 mm. Temperatures range from 18oC during December to February (10oC \nin Xam Neua) to 33oC during the hot, dry season in March to May.  \n \n4. \nBiological Environment:  There are no known endangered varieties of flora, or species of \nfish  or  fauna  in  the  project  towns.    Some  parts  of  the  towns  are  rural  in  character  with abundant \ntrees and agriculture, typically rice fields. \n \n5. \nSociocultural Environment: The people residing in the contiguous urban areas of each of \nthe  six  towns  are  reported  to  comprise  more  than  98%  ethnic  Lao  Leum.  The  towns  of  Pek, \nNamtha, and Xam Neua have largely developed and have been repopulated since 1975. A site of \ncultural and historic significance exists at the Plain of Jars, some 5 kilometer (km) from M. Pek. \n \nD.  \n \n6. \nPositive  Environmental  Impacts: The positive environmental benefits accruing from the \nproject interventions include (i) reduced health risks associated with polluted and/or stagnant water \nand flooding, as a result of drainage and sanitation improvements; (ii) reduced damage to property \nand  infrastructure  from  reduced  flooding;  (iii)  reduced  air  pollution,  dust,  and  rates  of  injury  and \ndeath  from  traffic  accidents  as  a  result  of  reduced  vehicle  emissions  due  to  improved  roads  and \nstreets;  (iv)  reduced  odor  and  insect  nuisance  related  to  improved  solid  waste  collection  and \ndisposal; and (v) overall environmental improvements.  \n \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n\f                                                                                                                      Appendix 7   \n\n41 \n7. \nEnvironmental  Problems  Due  to  Project  Location:    Few  environmental  problems  are \nassociated with the subproject locations. With the exception of landfill sites, all components will be \nconfined  to  upgrading  of  existing  facilities  within  the  existing  rights-of-way. In the case of landfill \nsites that involve land acquisition and minimal resettlement, resettlement plans were prepared. In \nno case will the project improvements encroach on environmentally sensitive areas. The site of the \nproposed sanitary landfill site in Pek is 2 km away from the area developed for tourism at the Plain \nof  Jars.  The  site  is  visible  from  vantage  points  near  the  Plain  of  Jars,  and  will  be  screened  by \nplanting trees early in project implementation to mitigate any negative effect.  \n \nEnvironmental Problems Related to Design:  The design of the subprojects will minimize \n8. \nadverse  environmental  impacts.  The  outputs  will  be  either  underground  or  at  the  ground  surface \nand therefore have no adverse visual impact. Storm water drainage will be fitted with trash racks to \ncollect  paper,  plastic,  and  other  debris.  Sullage,  septic  effluent,  and  other  pollutants  will  be \nspecifically excluded from storm water drainage. Selected landfill sites are at least 3 km from the \nedge  of  the  urban  area  and  will  be  designed  to  avoid  leaching  of  wastewater  into  natural \nwaterways or groundwater and to provide adequate methane outlets to avoid potential fire hazards. \nCollected  septic  effluent  will  be  discharged  to  shallow  clay-lined  ground  tanks  adjacent  to  the \nlandfill  site  for  stabilization  and  separation  prior  to  disposal.  All  underground  drainage,  riverbank \nprotection, and the one bridge will be hydraulically designed to ensure that flow of surface water is \nnot impeded. Infrastructure design will ensure adequate drainage of properties abutting the public \nland. \n \n9. \nEnvironmental Problems Associated with Construction:  The design of all works will be \nundertaken  with  concern  for  the  avoidance  of  erosion  both  during  construction  and  upon \ncompletion.  Work  will  be  programmed  to  avoid,  to  the  extent  possible,  community  disruption  or \ntraffic congestion. Strict measures, including the use of retention basins, will be enforced to prevent \nwater  pollution,  particularly  where  construction  sites  are  located  close  to  natural  waterways.  No \nroad closures are anticipated during the construction period and the contractor will be required to \nminimize impeding access at all times. \n \n10. \nEnvironmental Problems Resulting from Project Operations. Full environmental \nbenefits  will  be  achieved  only  with  the  adequate  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  project \noutputs. Environmental benefits will not accrue if the need for establishing a maintenance capacity \nat all levels and ensuring maintenance funding is ignored. The capacity building component of the \nProject will provide the necessary O&M systems and skills. Local resource mobilization reforms will \nprovide the funds required for O&M.   \n\n \n\n \n\nEnvironmental Management and Monitoring Plan \n\nProject Demobilization:  Project outputs are likely to remain in place until upgraded in the \nimpacts  associated  with  demobilization  or \n\n11. \nfuture.  Thus  no  negative  environmental \ndecommissioning are anticipated. \n \nE. \n \n12. \nAs  the  Project  is  a  sector  loan  project,  an  EMMP  is  required.  The  EMMP  provides  a \nframework  to  ensure  that  the  project  meets  both  ADB\u2019s  and  the  Government\u2019s  requirements for \nsafeguarding  the  environment,  and  sets  out  guidelines  and  parameters  on  environmental  issues \nwhen selecting and implementing future sub-projects.  \n \n13. \nCriteria  for  Future  Sub-project  Selection:  Subproject  selection  will  avoid  areas  of \nenvironmental sensitivity, sites that could impact on areas of important cultural heritage, and areas \nwhere  there  are  geologic  or  topographic  problems.  Sites  will  be  avoided  if  project  activities  will \nadversely affect, either groundwater or surface water  likely to be used by others, and mitigation is \nnot  possible.  Site  selection  will  consider  the  potential  nuisance  to  surrounding  areas  during  the \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nconstruction  period.  Site  selection  will  minimize  land  use  changes  and  impact  on  people\u2019s \nlivelihoods or personal property.  \n \n14. \nEnvironmental Impact Assessments and Approval Procedures:  The Project will meet \nthe requirements of both ADB and the Government in terms of environmental impact evaluations \nand assessments. The Science, Technology and Environment Agency (STEA) at the provincial or \nnational  level  will  first  approve  the  subprojects,  and  then  the  IEE,  along  with  comments  from  the \nconcerned agencies, will be submitted to ADB for endorsement before constructing the subproject.  \n \nPerformance  Indicators:  The  subprojects  will  be  monitored  for  their  impacts  on  the \n15. \nproblems  that  they  were  designed  to  address.  The  performance  indicators  include  air  and  water \nquality,  incidence  of  disease  due  to  waterborne  vectors,  incidence  of  complaints  regarding \nuncontrolled solid waste disposal, and incidence of flooding. \n \n16.  Measurement Parameters:  The indicators (para. 15) will be measured under a controlled \nmonitoring  program.    It  will  be  important,  particularly  in  the  early  years,  to  ensure  that  the \nmeasurement of the parameters chosen is within the scope of the local authorities.   \n\n \n17. \nInstitutional Capacities in Environmental Assessment:  The provincial offices of STEA \nwill be responsible for environmental monitoring outside Vientiane and will report to STEA and the \nrespective  provincial  governor\u2019s  offices.  This  provincial  level  representation  has  been  established \nin  all  provinces  except  Xaysomboun  Special  Zone  and  Vientiane  Prefecture.  Staff  has  been \nappointed locally, with officers in  the provinces varying from 3 to 10 people. Technical capacity in \nall provinces is limited. Only a few of the appointed staff have any training in environment-related \nskills.    Because  of  the  limited  capacity  in  the  STEA  provincial  offices,  capacity  building  will  be \nrequired and STEA assistance at the national level will be necessary. While it is not desirable for \nan organization to be involved in monitoring its own activities, support from the project coordination \nunit  (PCU)  and  the  consultants  will  be  necessary  from  time  to  time.  There  is  provision  in  the \nProject\u2019s  consulting  services  for  environmental  expertise,  particularly  for  conducting  IEEs.    This \ncould result in direct skills transfer through close liaison with the provincial STEAs. \n \n18.  Monitoring  Timescales  and  Reporting  Arrangements:  Monitoring  will  be  carried  out \nregularly.  Initially  the  timescale  will  reflect  the  limited  capacities  of  the  agencies  involved.  The \nminimum interval will be 6 months, so that one measurement can be taken in the  wet season and \none  in  the  dry  season.  Urban  development  administration  authorities  (UDAAs),  which  are  the \nimplementing  agencies  in  each  town,  will  work  closely  with  provincial  STEAs.  With  PCU \nassistance, UDAA will submit reports to provincial STEA.  \n \nF.  \n \n19. \nThe  Project  will  contribute  significantly  to  improved  living  conditions  and  the  well-being of \nthe urban poor. The identified adverse effects will be readily addressed through proper engineering \ndesign  and  incorporation  of  identified  mitigation  measures.  The  EMMP  will  ensure  that  future \nsubprojects are also subjected to rigorous environmental assessment.  \n \nG. \n \n20. \nOn the basis of this initial evaluation, the Project is unlikely to result in any major adverse \nenvironmental  impacts.  In  fact,  it  will  result  in  environmental  improvements.  An  environmental \nimpact assessment is not considered necessary.   \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nConclusion  \n\n\f                                                                                                                             Appendix 8    \n\n \n\n43 \n\n \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK AND RESETTLEMENT PLANS \n\nIntroduction \n\nResettlement Framework \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nIn  accordance  with  the  (ADB\u2019s)  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  for  sector  loans, \nresettlement  will  adhere  to  the  resettlement  framework  (RF).  RF  stipulations  described  here  will \napply to all subprojects that are and will be prepared and approved for inclusion in the sector loan \nproject.  Short  resettlement  plans  have  already  been  prepared  for  four  pilot  towns\u2019  subprojects  in \naccordance with the RF and will form models for land acquisition and resettlement under the new \nsubprojects (para. 11-15). \n \nB. \n \nThe RF is based on (i) ADB\u2019s policy on  Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and Handbook on \n2. \nResettlement (1998), (ii) the Lao PDR\u2019s legislative framework, and (iii) good practices established \nunder  ADB-supported  projects,  as  the  Government  has  yet  to  adopt  a  distinct  official  policy  for \ninvoluntary resettlement.1 All land is the property of the nation and ownership means only the right \nto use land. However, land rights are transferable and the right to use land is effectively equivalent \nto ownership. Various articles of the Land Law2 protect constitutional rights of land users. \n \n3. \nThe  main  RF  principles  follow  (i)  avoid  or  minimize  involuntary  resettlement  and  loss  of \nassets and/or income as much as possible; (ii) carry out resettlement so as to improve or at least \nrestore  the  preproject  living  standards  of  the  affected  persons  (APs);  (iii)  fully  inform  and  consult \nclosely with APs in preparing resettlement plans (RPs); (iv) give adequate compensation, at least \nat replacement costs, to all who lose either assets or income-earning capabilities; (v) compensate \nasset at replacement rates; (vi) compensate for lost assets and give resettlement subsidies in full,  \nbefore ground leveling or demolishing of the affected asset; and (vii) absence of a formal legal title \nshould not bar occupants from being compensated.  \n \n\n1. \n\nResettlement Procedural Guidelines \n\n \n4. \nIn preparing subproject RPs, the following steps will be followed: (i) during the preliminary \nproject  design  stage,  identify  the  category  under  which  the  Project  falls,  whether  it  has  (a)  no \nresettlement effect, (b) insignificant resettlement effects, or (c) significant resettlement effects; (ii) in \nfurther  defining  the  subproject  design,  consult  with  potential  APs  to  avoid  negative  resettlements \neffects; (iii) in the case of categories (b) and (c) conduct enumeration and socioeconomic surveys \nof  potential  APs  and  types  and  levels  of  loss;  (iv)  parallel  to  the  AP  census  survey,  continue \nconsulting with APs to identify their preferences and special needs; (v) prepare a RP; (vi) present \nthe RP at a public meeting; and (vii) submit the RP to the project coordination unit (PCU), which \nwill then forward it to ADB for review and clearance, together with the subproject appraisal reports. \n \nConsultation and Public Participation in Resettlement.  During  the  project  preparatory \n5. \ntechnical assistance when subprojects were prepared for four towns, consultation was carried out \nin  three  phases.  In  the  initial  phase,  information  was  collected  and  disseminated  to  selected \nstakeholders (particularly potential APs) to promote awareness and assess the towns\u2019 subproject \nbenefits  and  adverse  impacts.  In  the  second  phase,  concerns  of  and  suggestions  from  various \n\n                                                 \n1  The  draft  national  resettlement  policy,  however,  has  been  made  and  discussed.  Also,  the  principle  of  property \n\nownership and the protection of ownership rights stated in various laws provide a framework for resettlement. \n\n2  These include Article 5 (protection of various categories of land); Article 6 (persons managing or using the land legally \nhave the rights to receive compensation for any loss or damage in the event that the Government acquires the right to \nuse the land for the benefit of the public); Article 43 (entitlements/rights to use land); Article 63 (termination of right to \nuse  land);  and  Articles  67-71 (requirement for each village,  municipality,  province,  or  special  zone  to  keep  5%  of  its \ntotal land area in reserve for compensating requisitioned land). \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n44 \nstakeholders3 were elicited, and information obtained from the initial phase was further processed \nand disseminated. The final phase included testing of subproject design and detailed assessment \nof  adverse  effects.  Previously  overlooked  or  outstanding  concerns  of  stakeholders  received  a \nforum  for  review,  and  APs  were  actively  involved  in  the  project  tasks,  committees,  and  decision-\nmaking.  \n \nDuring the preparation of future subprojects under the sector loan, similar consultations will \n6. \ntake place to enable APs to participate in key decisions that affect their lives. Consultation will start \nas  early  as  possible.  Project  implementing  units  (PIUs)  in  the  urban  development  administration \nauthorities (UDAAs), assisted by community development consultants, will ensure that all potential \nbeneficiaries  and  APs  are  properly  and  promptly  informed  of  subproject  activities,  including  the \ntype  of  work  to  be  implemented,  the  schedule  of  works,  and  potential  impacts.  Further \nconsultations will be carried out during social analysis as part of the subprojects\u2019 feasibility studies \nto assess the needs and preferences of APs for compensation and rehabilitation. This will ensure \ngeneral understanding with key stakeholders. The cooperation of the village chiefs and members \nof the Lao Women\u2019s Union (LWU) will be critical.    \n \n7. \nCompensation  and  Entitlements.  All  persons  who  are  adversely  affected  by  project \nimplementation,  whether  through  loss  of  assets  or  income-earning capabilities, have the right to \nadequate  compensation.  The  losses  include  (i)  permanent  loss  of  agricultural  land,  (ii)  loss  of \nresidential and/or commercial land, (iii) loss of residential and/or commercial structures, (iv) loss of \nstanding  crops  and  trees,  and  (v)  loss  of  hired  wage  labor-days.  In  principle,  lost land should be \nreplaced with land at least equal in size and value and with valid title and registration; and loss of \nhouses, other structures, crops and trees, is compensated at replacement cost. Vulnerable groups \nwill  be  eligible  for  additional  support  and  income  restoration  measures.  If  compensation  alone  is \nnot adequate to sustain or improve the livelihood of APs, additional rehabilitation measures must \nbe developed for the purpose. The cutoff date is the moment when UDAAs notify the population at \nlarge  about  the  Project  and  the  resettlement  consequences.  Families  that  settle  after  the  cut-off \ndate will not be entitled to compensation payments or allocation (Table A8). \n \nGrievance  Redress.  To  ensure  that  affected  people  have  avenues  for  redressing  their \n8. \ngrievances  related  to  any  aspect  of  land  acquisition,  income  loss,  relocation,  compensation,  and \nrehabilitation assistance, a three-step procedure will be followed: (i) the claimant (AP or potentially \naffected  person)  lodges  a  complaint  with  the  UDAA  resettlement  officer  in  the  presence  of  the \nvillage  head.  The  resettlement  officer  will  process  the  complaint  in  coordination  with  the  village \nhead and village LWU member within 15 days of the receipt of the grievance. If the conflict cannot \nbe settled, the claimant appeals to the Town Resettlement Committee (TRC) to be chaired by the \nUDAA  president  and  comprising  representatives  of  UDAA,  relevant  provincial  and  district  offices, \npertinent  village  heads,  and  LWU.  The  committee  is  to  confirm  the  receipt  of  the  claim  and  to \nrespond to the claimant within 15 days. If the claimant is still not satisfied, or if for any reason the \npackage  does  not  materialize,  the  claimant  appeals  to  the  Project  Grievance  Committee.  The \ncommittee,  to  be  headed  by  the  director  of  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Planning  and \ncomprising representatives from the Justice Department, LWU, the PCU, and the Ethnic Council, \nwill  investigate,  arrange  meetings  with  officials  concerned,  or  resolve  the  dispute  on  the  spot. \nMinutes  of  the  com mittee  deliberations  and  decisions  will  be  sent  to  the  PCU  and  the  external \nmonitoring  party,  and  all  correspondence  will  be  duly  recorded.  The  grievance  procedures, \nhowever, do not take away the constitutional rights of any claimant to lodge a complaint with the \nDistrict People\u2019s Court. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n3  Stakeholders include the general public who will benefit from project families with potential to be affected by the project \nthrough land acquisition or resettlement, village heads and communities, UDAAs, and particularly their public relations \nand conflict settlement divisions, provincial and district departments, project coordination unit (PCU), contractors, and \nadvocacy groups e.g., LWU.  \n\n\f                                                                                                                             Appendix 8    \n\n \n\n45 \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities \n\n \nGiven  the  likely  small  scale  of  the  resettlement  component  of  the  Project,  the  institutional \n9. \nframework will be simple and flexible. Within the PCU based in the Executing Agency, the Ministry \nof  Communication,  Transport,  Posts,  and  Construction,  a  senior  officer  will  be  responsible  for \noverall  coordination  and  supervision  of  the  RPs  and  activities.  The  officer  will  have  counterparts, \nresettlement officers, in PIUs based in UDAAs, and will guide UDAAs, which will be responsible for \npreparing and implementing the RPs. RPs, where necessary, will be prepared as part of the towns\u2019 \nsubproject  feasibility  reports,  by  the  PIUs  with  assistance  from  the  project  management  and \nimplementation consultants, including a resettlement expert provided to assist PIUs in carrying out \nresettlement tasks. Public relations and conflict settlement units of UDAAs will be closely involved \nin  all  resettlement  activities.  The  plans  prepared  by  PIUs  will  be  forwarded  to  PCU  before  the \ntowns\u2019  subprojects  are  approved  and  will  then  be  forwarded  to  ADB  for  clearance.  The  TRC  will \noversee the resettlement activities and arbitrate in case of conflicts.  \n \n\n3. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n10. \nTo  ensure  that  the  policies  and  principles  of  the  RP  are  adhered  to  and  that  villagers \nimprove  their  livelihood  after  resettlement,  monitoring  will  be  carried  out  internally  by  PCU  in \ncoordination  with  PIUs,  and  externally  by  an  independent  monitoring  agency  (nongovernment \norganization or academia) to be hired for the purpose. Internal monitoring by PCU will focus on the \nprogress of the resettlement activities in accordance with the timetable given in the RP. PIUs will \nprepare quarterly resettlement progress reports for each town where resettlement takes place and \nforward them to PCU for review. The reports will include progress in information dissemination to \nAPs  and  community  consultation,  land  acquisition,  land  replacements,  and  compensation  for \nrelocation.  Monitoring  indicators  will  include  (i)  household  socioeconomic  data  (disaggregated  by \ngender), (ii) payments of compensation and disbursement of other benefits to APs as identified in \nthe entitlement matrix, (iii) level of restoration of business and income after resettlement or project \nconstruction,  and  (iv)  pre-  and  post-project  construction  living  standards  measured  in  qualitative \nand quantitative terms.  \n \n11. \nIndependent  monitoring  by  a  third  party  will  be  undertaken  intermittently,  starting  in  early \n2004 during the relocation and compensation payment for losses, and will continue throughout the \nProject.  External  monitoring  will  involve  a  review  of  overall  resettlement  as  provided  through  the \ninternal monitoring system as well as direct field investigations and consultations with stakeholders \nto  verify  the  results  of  internal  monitoring.  The  tasks  will  include,  among  others,  to  (i)  review \npreproject  baseline  data  on  APs;  (ii)  identify  of  a  set  of  indicators  for  assessing  resettlement \nimpact;  (iii)  use  various  formal  and  informal  surveys  for  impact  analysis;  and  (iv)  assess \nresettlement efficiency, effectiveness, and impact and sustainability. Problems identified will be fed \nback into the ongoing resettlement implementation to improve the process.  \n \nC. \n \nShort  RPs  have  been  prepared  for  four  subprojects  -  Muang  Xai4,  Vang  Vieng,  Pakxanh, \n12. \nand  Xam  Neua  in  accordance  with  the  RF  (para.  2-10).  For  Phonsavan,  no  resettlement \ncomponents were envisaged since the town improvements will be confined to the existing rights-of-\nway and the solid waste site, which is government-owned, will not cause any person to lose assets \nor income. From the feasibility studies under the project preparatory technical assistance, the need \nfor resettlement appears minimal, and project activities proposed under the subprojects have been \ncarefully  screened  to  assess  any  potential  hardships  that  will  be  inflicted  on  the  local  population. \nThe total number of affected families in the four towns is 39, of which only 3 families need to be \nrelocated  to  allow  for  the  construction  of  a  bridge  in  Xam  Neua.  In  Pakxanh  25  families,  will  be \n\nShort Resettlement Plans \n\n                                                 \n4 Xai is not included in the first batch of towns; however, a resettlement plan has already been prepared on the basis the \nproposed subproject, and will be updated when the town is admitted into the Project.    \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\nmarginally  affected  by  the  loss  of  70  square  meters  each  from  their  garden  necessary  for  the \nconstruction of a small flood protection bank. Construction of a solid waste  disposal site in Xay will \nnecessitate 6 hectares (ha) of agricultural land and affect a community of 10 farmers cultivating the \narea,  while  the  sanitary  landfill  site  in  Vang  Vieng  will  require  another  5  ha  owned  by  the \nGovernment.  The  cost  of  resettlement  and  land  acquisition  is  estimated  at  $42,000  in  the  four \ntowns. In all, compensation will be provided for land replacement (6.2 ha), building replacement (4 \nhouses),  loss  of  standing  crop,  relocation  and  subsistence  allowance,  land  preparation  costs, \nrehabilitation and income restoration costs, and costs for management, monitoring, and evaluation. \nCost estimates will be annually adjusted based on the inflation rate in the previous year.  \n \n13.   Muang Xai: Land acquisition will be needed for a solid waste disposal site. The new site, \n16 kilometers (km) from town, is proposed because the current disposal site infringes on a major \nroad  and  its  proximity  to  a  nearby  river  raises  major  environmental  concerns  such  as \nleakage/seepage  and  contamination.  Other  technically  viable  sites  had  significant  resettlement \nimplications.  The  project  will  affect  swidden  farmers  of  6  ha  agricultural  land.  The  farmers  have \ncustomary  rights  to  the  terrain  and  will  therefore  be  compensated  for  their  loss  by  being  given \naccess to land at least equal in size and productivity. The farmers will also receive compensation \nfor land preparation of approximately $2,587.  \n \n14. \nVang  Vieng: Construction of a new, technically and environmentally suitable site for solid \nwaste  disposal  will  take  place  on  government-owned  land  about  7  km  south  of  Vang  Vieng.  The \nsite  (5  ha)  is  currently  occupied  by  an  ethnic  Lao  Leum  farmer,  who  cultivates  rainfed  rice. \nAlthough the AP is using the land without the knowledge or permission of district authorities, he will \nbe compensated in cash for loss of standing crops in an amount equal to the net annual revenue \nfrom the parcel of land, estimated at $100 per ha for a total of $500. All other civil works including \nstorm water drainage and road improvement works will have no resettlement consequence.  \n \n15. \nPakxanh:  The  villages  of  Sivilay  and  Souansavan  in  Pakxanh  are  flooded  yearly  around \nAugust,  when  the  Xanh  River  reaches  its  peak  flow,  bringing  village  life  to  a  stop  and  school \nclosures.  Flood  protection  works  will  consist  of  extending  a  flood  bank  600  meters  (m)  and \nelevating a public road by 50 centimeters over a distance of 450 m. The extended flood bank will \nbe constructed as a footpath, which requires acquisition of 1,800 m2 of land from 25 families. The \naverage loss is 70 m2 per family, which will be duly compensated at approximately $10,800. The \nfamilies welcomed the flood protection work as it will end the annual flooding and increase property \nvalue. \n \n16. \nXam Neua: A bridge to shorten market access to the town for the rural population and to \nlink the two parts of the towns along both sides of the river will be constructed in Xam Neua. It will \nrequire (i) relocation of three families to a site close to their present place of residence and (ii) 100 \nm2 of land on  the northern side of the river and 300 m2 of agricultural and residential land on the \nsouthern  side  of  the  river.  All  APs  were  interviewed  and  consulted  under  the  project  preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  and  by  the  district  office  staff.  Besides  bridge  construction, no other project \nactivities will affect the town residents or the ethnic minorities; one of the households was headed \nby a female. Affected families will be given land on the eastern side of the Neua River, adjacent to \nthe  land  they  presently  own.  Compensation  will  include  three  wooden  one-story houses and one \ncommercial  structure  at  170  square  feet  (approximately  $13,600),  relocation  and  subsistence \nallowance  for  three  families  ($1,020),  rehabilitation  and  income  restoration  measures  including \nwater connections and electricity for the three affected families ($1,600).

Review the status of UDAA establishment \nin  small  towns,  assess  problems,  and  recommend  remedial  actions;  update  and \nadjust the operational guidelines being developed under earlier assistance for the \nUDAAs; develop corporate plans outlining the vision, immediate tasks, existing and \npotential  resources \nin  establishing  and \nthe \nimplementing cost recovery/local resource mobilization measures, developing and \nmonitoring the implementation of operational and financial action plans for UDAAs; \ndevelop basic computerized asset registers and comprehensive O&M programs; \nand  develop  financial  management  systems,  prepare  sources  and  application  of \nfunds statements, and prepare for auditing of accounts. \n\nfor  undertaking \n\ntasks;  assist \n\n \n(ii)   UDAA  networking.  Assist  in  establishing  a  UDAA  network,  preparing  a  network \ncharter and a program  to promote decentralized urban governance reforms, to allow \nexchange of experience among UDAAs, to motivate new UDAAs by informing them \nof  the  progress  of  the  more  advanced  UDAAs  through  the  prominent  leaders \ninvolved  in  UDAA  reforms,  and  to  enable  them  to  communicate  their  common \nconcerns to the central Government more effectively.  \n\n \n(iii)   Training. Assess priority needs and design training programs through participatory \nmethods and in full consultation with all stakeholders,  including on-the-job training \nand formal training programs, workshops, study tours, and exchange programs to \nensure that skills development supports the sustainable operation of the UDAAs. \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                Appendix 14                         \n\n57\n\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES  \n\nGeneral \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nEconomic  and  financial  analyses  conducted  under  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  were  reviewed  and  revised  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s)  Framework  for  the  Economic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of  Urban  Development  Sector \nProject.   Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were computed for major subcomponents in \neach of the pilot small town subprojects following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis \nof  Projects.    Financial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  were  determined  for  the  income-\ngenerating  subcomponents  of  the  Project,  and  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  urban \ndevelopment  administration  authorities  (UDAAs)  to  be  established  under  the  Project  was \nassessed,  based  on  the  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of \nInvestment Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank.  \n \nB. \n \nThe  estimated  costs  and  benefits  of  the  major  subprojects1  were  valued  at  their \n2. \neconomic  prices  using  the  domestic  price  numeraire,  which  adjusts  border  price  equivalent \nvalues  to  their  equivalent  domestic  prices  and  entails  the  application  of  shadow  price \nadjustments  to  convert  the  estimated  financial  costs  to  their  equivalent.  The  shadow  price \nadjustment  factors  used  follows:    (i)  foreign  costs,  1.11;  (ii)  unskilled  labor,  0.50;  (iii)  skilled \nlabor,  1.00;  and  (iv)  local  materials,  1.00.2    Capital  and  recurrent  costs,  inclusive  of  physical \ncontingencies,  in  constant  2002  prices  were  converted  into  economic  costs  by subtracting all \ntransfer  payments,  including  taxes  and  duties,  and  applying  the  appropriate  shadow  price \nadjustment factors.   \n \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n1. \n\nRoad Improvements and Drainage Works  \n\n \nRoad improvements and drainage works constitute approximately 28% of the estimated \n3. \nproject cost. About 145,800 m2 of road surfacing; 90,000 m2 of road pavement construction and \nreconstruction, 50,000 m2 of road widening, and 22,000 m2 of footpath paving will be involved. \nDrainage  works  corresponding  to  these  road  improvements  will  also  be  undertaken.  Street \nlighting  on  over  1,150  existing  poles  will  be  provided  as  part  of  the  townwide  urban \ninfrastructure upgrading. At the village level, approximately 50,000 m2 of main access roads with \ndrainage  will  be  constructed,  partly  using  in-kind  labor  contributions  from  the  community. \nCentral and secondary roads will also be improved in 60 villages, representing about half of the \ntotal estimated number of villages in the targeted 10 towns.   \n \n4. \nRoad  improvements  and  drainage  works  in  the  participating  small towns will contribute \nsignificantly  to  the  improved  economic  welfare  of  the  town  residents.  Anticipated  economic \nbenefits  were  quantified  by  determining  the  incremental  increase  in  the  valuation  of  land \naffected  by  the  subprojects.3  In  the  absence  of  sales  data  or  regular  property  valuation \nprocedures in the Lao PDR, local municipal officials in the pilot towns were asked to assess the \nprobable  increase  in  land  valuation.  The  results  indicated  considerable  optimism;  adjustments \nfor a more conservative approach yielded land valuation increases ranging from 67 to 153%, on \nbase values estimated at KN300 million to KN900 million per hectare. \n\n                                                                 \n1      In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Framework  for  the  Economic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of  Urban Development Sector \nProjects,  smaller subprojects scattered throughout the participating small towns such as market and bus station  \nimprovements, as well as village infrastructure upgrading were not subjected to a detailed EIRR analysis, but were \nexamined using the cost-effectiveness criteria.   \n\n2  These adjustment factors are consistent with those used in other ADB-funded projects of a similar nature in Lao \n\nPDR such as the Vientiane Urban Infrastructure and Services Project , which was approved in 2001. \n\n3  An  alternative  approach  using  vehicle  operation  cost  (VOC)  savings  is  more  suited  to  larger  urban  areas  with \n\nheavier road traffic such as Vientiane.  \n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \n5. \nThe  major  indicators  of  the  economic  viability  of  the  proposed  road  improvements  and \ndrainage works in the pilot town subprojects are summarized in Table A14.1. Calculated base \ncase EIRRs varied from 19.26% to 27.50%, exceeding ADB\u2019s 12% economic opportunity cost of \ncapital (EOCC), and confirming the economic robustness of the proposed subprojects. Analysis \nof  sensitivity  to  some  parameters? including  a  10%  increase  in  costs  (likely  to  result  from \ndelayed  or  prolonged  implementation  and  inflationary  factors),  a  10%  decrease  in  benefits \n(likely to result from poor quality implementation), and delays in the realization of benefits (likely \nto  be  caused  by  failure  to  establish  efficiently  functioning  town  UDAAs  on  time)? showed that \nthe EIRRs will be most vulnerable to changes in the anticipated benefits, i.e., increases in land \nvaluation.  Subproject  costs  will  have  to  increase  by  42.9-75%  for  the  EIRRs  to  drop  to  the \nEOCC;  the  same  impact  will  be  achieved  with  benefits  decreasing  by  32.9-60.6%.  Adverse \nforeign  exchange  movements  of  the  kip  will  also  affect  the  EIRRs.  The  economic  analysis \nrevealed that if the kip depreciates by 36.3-79.7% the base case EIRRs will drop to 12%.  \n \n\nTable A14.1:  Economic Evaluation of Road Improvements and Drainage Works \n \n \n \nPakxhan  Phonsavanh \n \n \n\n \nVang Vieng  Xam Neua \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nBase Case/Sensitivity Scenarios \n \nFinancial Cost \n          (KN million) \nNet Present Value (NPV) \n          (KN million) \nBase Case EIRR (%) \nSensitivity Test \n          Case 1: Capital cost + 10% \n               EIRR (%) \n               Switching Value \n               Sensitivity Indicator \n          Case 2: O&M + 10% \n               EIRR (%) \n               Switching Value \n               Sensitivity Indicator \n          Case 3: Benefits < 10% \n               EIRR (%) \n               Switching Value \n               Sensitivity Indicator \n          Case 4 : Benefits Delayed by 1 year \n               EIRR (%) \n               NPV (KN million) \n               % Drop in NPV \n          Case 5: Combination of cases 1 and 2 \n               EIRR (%) \n               NPV (KN million) \n               % Drop in NPV \n          Case 6: 10% adverse forex movement \n               EIRR (%) \n               Switching Value \n               Sensitivity Indicator \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance \n \n\n5,810 \n \n4,115 \n \n23.72 \n \n \n21.83 \n61.9 \n1.62 \n \n23.47 \n476 \n0.21 \n \n21.3 \n49.8 \n2.01 \n \n19.48 \n2,889 \n29.8 \n \n19.25 \n2,612 \n36.5 \n \n21.55 \n54.0 \n1.85 \n\n6,757 \n \n6,683 \n \n27.50 \n \n \n25.43 \n75.0 \n1.33 \n \n27.24 \n590 \n0.17 \n \n24.94 \n60.6 \n1.65 \n \n22.47 \n5,015 \n25.0 \n \n22.73 \n4,745 \n29.0 \n \n25.18 \n66.8 \n1.5 \n\n7,399 \n \n3,029 \n \n19.26 \n \n \n17.57 \n42.9 \n0.17 \n \n18.94 \n224 \n0.45 \n \n17.05 \n32.9 \n3.04 \n \n15.86 \n1,752 \n42.2 \n \n15.12 \n1,336 \n55.9 \n \n17.26 \n36.3 \n2.76 \n\n5,032 \n \n4,235 \n \n25.56 \n \n \n23.58 \n68.5 \n1.65 \n \n25.29 \n506 \n0.20 \n \n23.09 \n55.0 \n1.82 \n \n20.95 \n3,091 \n27.0 \n \n20.96 \n2,871 \n32.2 \n \n23.86 \n79.7 \n1.25 \n\n2.  \n\nStorm Water Drainage and Flood Protection Works \n\n \n6. \nStorm water drainage and flood protection works account for 6% of the total project cost \nestimates.  In  the  targeted  small  towns,  storm  water  drainage  consisting  of  both  surface  and \nunderground  drains  will  be  constructed  in  conjunction  with  the  proposed  road  improvements. \nThese works are primarily aimed at decreasing the incidence of flooding in small towns, thereby \nreducing flood-related damages to life and property and decreasing the potential for the spread \nof waterborne diseases. The essentially small-scale nature of these storm drainage  works does \nnot require a detailed economic evaluation. Reliance is mainly on the least-cost criteria and the \n\n\f                                                                                                                Appendix 14                         \n\n59\n\npreviously established economic viability of ongoing drainage projects in Vientiane.4 However, in \nthe  pilot  town  of  Pakxhan,  a  major  flood  protection  subproject  with  base  cost  of  $176,000  is \nproposed  for  Sivilay  village,  and  along  the  bank  of  the  Mekong  River,  near  the  floodgate \ndownstream of the town. The economic benefits from the proposed flood protection works were \nquantified  by  assessing  the  potential  savings  arising  from  reduced  physical  damages  to  the \nflood-prone properties in the town, including buildings. Local officials and villagers indicated that \nflooding occurs every other year in the town, and that the costs of repairs and minor flood control \nefforts  translated  to  an  annual  rate  of  about  10%  of  the  affected  property  values  (roughly \nassessed  to  have  an  average  base  value  of  KN300  million  per  hectare).5 Crop damages were \nalso estimated at KN 2.328 billion per hectare of irrigated rice at 50% annually.6 Allowance was \nmade for the unit benefit to rise by 6% per annum, in line with the forecast growth in the gross \ndomestic product (GDP) per capita of the Lao PDR. The resulting base case EIRR was 33.68%, \nhigher than ADB\u2019s 12% EOCC, and demonstrating the considerable economic contribution of the \nproposed  subproject  to  both  the  urban  and  rural  surrounding  villages.  Sensitivity  analysis \nsuggested that the EIRR would also be  vulnerable to changes in the anticipated benefits from \nthe  subproject.  Capital  costs  will  have  to  increase  by  103.8%,  while  benefits  will  require  only  a \nreduction of 89.0%, for the EIRR to drop to 12%.    \n\n \n3. \n\nOther Nonquantified Benefits \n\n \n7. \nThe  road  improvements  and  drainage  subprojects  will  generate  additional  benefits  that \nare  not  readily  quantifiable:    (i)  reduced  damage  to  motor  vehicles,  (ii)  savings  in  travel  time, \nand (iii) safer conditions for both nonmotorized and pedestrian traffic.  The storm water drainage \nand flood protection works will (i) reduce personal income losses due to disrupted employment, \nand  (ii)  bring  about  environmental  and  health  improvements,  particularly  as  a  result  of  the \nelimination  of  flooded  and  muddy  streets  during  the  wet  season.  In  addition,  vehicle  parking, \nstreet lights, toilets, and drainage in selected public markets and bus stations in the participating \nsmall towns will contribute to improvements in the town\u2019s overall hygiene and health. Introducing \na solid waste management service in each town will pave the way for substantially cleaner town \nenvironments.  Similarly,  with  appropriate  and  affordable  septic  waste  treatment  proposed  for \neach  town,  environmental  pollution  will  diminish.  The  livelihood  promotion  subcomponent  will \nprovide  additional  income  opportunities  and  will  partly  induce  capital  accumulation  in  the \nvillages, thereby contributing to poverty reduction.  \n \n8. \nOverall, the Project will stimulate critical backward and forward linkages in the economy \nby improving the basic infrastructure services of small towns that are strategically linked to the \nrural hinterland. Moreover, the Project will facilitate enhanced access to basic services such as \nhealth, education, and social welfare in the small towns, and thus contribute to the productivity \nand general well-being of the local residents. The detailed economic evaluation of the proposed \nsubprojects in the pilot towns is presented in Supplementary Appendix F.   \n \nC. \n \n9. \nThe  FIRRs  were  prepared  for  the  revenue-generating subcomponents:  (i) solid waste \nmanagement,  and  (ii)  septage  disposal.  Table  A14.2  presents  the  major  indicators  of  the \nfinancial  viability  of  the  solid  waste  management  subprojects  in  the  pilot  towns.  All  base  case \nFIRRs  of  8.69-13.22%  exceeded  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC),  which  was \n\nFinancial  Analysis \n\n                                                                 \n4   Under the  Vientiane  Urban  Infrastructure  and  Services  Project  (VUISP),  economic  evaluation  conducted on the \ndrainage subcomponent resulted in an overall  base care EIRR of 11.9% with individual subproject EIRRs ranging \nfrom 6 to 29%. The lowest return was for a small  individual subproject whose benefits from improved connectivity \nto the drainage network could not be fully reflected in the analysis.   \n\n5   This is considerably higher than the 1% used under the VUISP. The higher ratio of property damages used in this \n\nanalysis can be traced to the significantly lower average property values in the small towns.  \n\n6   Based on the Feasibilty study for the ADB-funded Irrigation Management Transfer Project in the Lao PDR (1999).  \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n60\ncalculated  at  4.3%.7    Sensitivity  tests  indicated  that,  on  the  average,  the  FIRRs  will  be  most \nsusceptible to a reduction in the projected revenues or user charges and fees to be collected. \nCapital  costs  will  have  to  increase  by  28.8-49.4%  for  the  base  case  FIRRs  to  drop  to  the \nWACC;  alternatively,  projected  revenues  will  have  to  decline  by  18.4-28.6%.  The  FIRRs  are \nalso  responsive  to  adverse  movements  in  the  kip  foreign  exchange  rate.  A  19.5-30.8% \ndepreciation  of  the  kip  will  jeopardize  the  financial  viability  of  the  solid  waste management \nsubprojects. Nonetheless, with the improved macroeconomic prospects of the Lao PDR, the kip \nis expected to demonstrate increased stability against the US dollar in the medium term. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nTable A14.2:  Financial Evaluation of Solid Waste Manageme nt Subprojects \n \n \n\n \nPakxhan  Phonsavanh  Vang Vieng  Xam Neua \n \n\n9.87 \n1,445 \n \n \n \n8.32 \n36.0 \n2.78 \n \n9.37 \n111.6 \n0.21 \n \n7.45 \n23.0 \n2.01 \n \n7.14 \n209 \n86 \n \n5.14 \n74 \n95 \n \n7.59 \n24.5 \n4.09 \n\n13.22 \n2,545 \n \n \n \n11.41 \n49.4 \n2.03 \n \n12.45 \n116.5 \n0.86 \n \n10.10 \n28.6 \n3.50 \n \n9.37 \n1,598 \n37 \n \n7.18 \n825 \n68 \n \n10.32 \n30.8 \n3.25 \n\n \nItem  \n \nBase Case FIRR (%) \nNet Present Value (NPV) \n          (KN million) \nSensitivity Test \n          Case 1: Capital cost + 10% \n               FIRR (%) \n               Switching Value \n               Sensitivity Indicator \n          Case 2: O&M + 10% \n               FIRR (%) \n               Switching Value \n               Sensitivity Indicator \n          Case 3: Benefits < 10% \n               FIRR (%) \n               Switching Value \n               Sensitivity Indicator \n          Case 4: Benefits Delayed by 1 year \n               FIRR (%) \n               NPV (KN million) \n               % Drop in NPV \n          Case 5: Combination of cases  1 and 2 \n               FIRR (%) \n               NPV (KN million) \n               % Drop in NPV \n          Case 6: 10% adverse forex movement \n               FIRR (%) \n               Switching Value \n               Sensitivity Indicator \nFIRR = financial interest rate of returns, O&M = operation & maintenance \n \n10. \nAll  septage  disposal  subprojects  in  the  pilot  towns  were  found  to  be  financially  viable, \nwith base case FIRRs of 7.28-11.95%.

In  the  central  region \nwhere  three  of  the  four  pilot  towns  are  located,  the  1997/98  poverty  line  was  calculated to be \nKN23,637  per  capita  per  month  (equal  to  KN132,367  per  month  per  household  given  the \naverage household size of 5.6 persons in the pilot towns). In the northern region, where the pilot \ntown of Xam Neua is located, the 1996/98 poverty line was established at KN23,749 per capita \nper month (equal to KN142,494 per household per month given the town\u2019s average household \nsize of 6).9 Adjusting these poverty lines to 2002 levels using annual inflation indices resulted in \nthe following: KN475,976  ($50) per  month per household in the central region, and KN512,390 \n($54) per month per household for the northern region. These figures appear to be sufficiently \nclose  to  the  government\u2019s10  definition  of  poverty  threshold,  which  is  KN100,000  per  capita  per \nmonth or KN560,000 ($59) to KN600,000 ($63) per household per month.   \n \n12. \nPoverty surveys undertaken during the project preparatory technical assistance revealed \nthree categories of urban poor in the targeted towns: (i) the ultra poor whose incomes are less \nthan  KN200,000  ($21)  per  household  per  month,  (ii)  the  medium-poor whose incomes ranged \nfrom  KN201,000  to  KN400,000  ($22-$42)  per  household  per  month,  and  (iii)  the  upper-level \npoor  with  monthly  household  incomes  between  KN401,000  and  KN600,000  ($42-$63).  Urban \nhouseholds of this type, which comprise the 30th to the 45th percentiles of income distribution in \nthe targeted towns, usually spend about 60% on food items, 10% on housing,  about 9-14% on \ntransport  and  communications,  and  the  rest  on  education,  recreation,  personal care and other \nexpenditure  items.  The  average  monthly  household  income  in  the  central  region  towns  is \napproximately  KN860,000  ($90);  in  the  northern  region  towns,  the  average  household  income \nappears to be lower at KN675,000 per month ($71).11 \n \n13. \nCost recovery for investments under the Project and revenue generation by the UDAAs \nto be established in the small towns will require that the residents pay additional and higher user \ncharges and fees, including those for solid waste collection, septage disposal, and surcharges \non water and electricity. These charges and fees to be imposed will account for about 1.7-2.6% \nof  the  average  household  income  in  the  targeted  towns.  At  the  30th  to  the  45th  percentiles  of \nthe  targeted  towns,  the  charges  and  fees  will  constitute  3.1-4.0%  of  monthly  income.  To \naddress  affordability  concerns  among  the  poor,  differential  pricing  between  commercial  and \nresidential users will be adopted, allowing cross subsidization to occur. Community leaders and \nresidents, who expressed their demand for the urban infrastructure services to be provided, also \narticulated their willingness to pay for the services under a village contracting mechanism where \nthe poor will be charged according to their ability to pay.12 Levying the charges and fees based \non consumption patterns and using progressive rates will also ensure that the burden of taxation \nfor urban infrastructure services is appropriately skewed toward those who can better afford to \npay. And finally, based on the Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey 1997/98 (LECS 2), the \nroad improvements subprojects, which will provide the much-needed accessibility for the urban \nhouseholds residing in the small towns, will reduce household expense on food and transport by \n3-11% and 4-9%, respectively. \n\n \n\nFinancial Sustainability Of Small Town UDAAs \n\nE. \n \n14. \nTen-year  financial  projections  prepared  for  the  pilot  towns  confirm  that  with  a  properly \nphased  and  executed  collection  of  urban-related  user  charges  and  fees,  the  UDAAs  to  be \nestablished under the Project will  be  able  to  meet,  within  6  years  of  subproject  appraisal,  the \nprojected  operational  cost  of  providing  urban  infrastructure  services  as  well  as  the  cost  of \nmaintaining existing and project-created public assets.  Lessons learned from relevant projects \n\n                                                                 \n9   These  poverty  lines  were  based  on  the  equivalent  income  needed  to  purchase  the  average  daily  caloric \n\nrequirements of the Lao population in the various regions plus some expenditure for essential nonfood items.   \n\n10 Through the State Planning Committee and the district authorities concerned. \n11  Based on 1998/99 monthly household income estimates of the Lao PDR regions (Chamberlain, J. 1999, The Social \n\nImpact of the Economic Crisis on Lao PDR.  \n\n12  This is particularly true for the solid waste management and septage disposal subprojects.   \n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 14 \n\nwere incorporated into the analysis, including the phased introduction of user charges and fees, \nstarting  with  those  that  are  relatively  easy  to  formulate  and  implement  within  the  first  2  years, \nsuch  as  the  (i)  solid  waste  collection  fees,  (ii)  sanitation  charges,  (iii)  parking  and \nslaughterhouse fees, and (iv) business activity-related licenses and permits.  By the third year, \nadditional  charges  and  fees  will  be  levied,  including  the  (i)  consumption-based surcharges for \nelectricity and water supply, (ii) contributions to the road maintenance fund, and (iii) the urban \nobligation fees.13 Revenue projections for the four towns were based on this phased introduction \nof  charges  and  fees  (Table  A14.3),  combined  with  a  gradual  buildup  of  the  UDAA\u2019s  collection \nefficiency, in addition to networking activities with the Vientiane UDAA and the secondary towns \nUDAAs, to exchange lessons learned and accelerate the learning curve.  \n\n \nTable A14.3:  Summary of Proposed User Charges and Fees in the Four Pilot Towns \n\n \n\n \nUser Charge/Fee \n\n \nSolid Waste Collection Fees  \nSeptic Tank Cleaning Fees  \n\nWater Surcharge \nElectricity Surcharge \nParking Fees  \nUrban Obligation Fees  \nRoad Maintenance Fund \nHotels/Guest Houses Room \nTax \nSlaughterhouse Fees  \n\nSummary of Charges and Fees To Be Collected \n\nStart of \n\nInitial Rate \n\nImplementationa  Residential  Commercial \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUnit \n\nRate of \nIncrease ($)c \n \n\nYear 1 \n\nYear 1 \n\nYear 3 \nYear 3 \nYear 1 \nYear 2 \nYear 3 \n\nYear 2 \n\nYear 2 \n\n4,650 \n185,000-\n200,000 \n1,000 \n1,000 \n1,000 \n24,000 \n5 \n\n16,800  KN/ton/month \n\n550,000-\n600,000 \n\nKN/cleaning \n\n  KN/month \n  KN/month \n  KN/parking \n\n48,000  KN/year \n  KN/liter \n\n \n\n \n\n5,000  KN/room/month \n\n1,000-2,000  KN/animal killed \n\n2 \n\n2 \n\n2 \n0 \n5 \n3 \n0 \n\n10 \n\n5 \n\na  From subproject appraisal \nb  Average based on the four towns  \nc  In real term, allowance for inflation to be added \n \n \n15. \nGrants from the central and provincial governments will finance the shortfall between the \nUDAAs\u2019  total  projected  revenues  and  expenses.  The  subsidies  are  deemed  justifiable \nconsidering  the  longer  term  province-wide  and  economy-wide  net  positive  benefits  that  the \nProject will generate through urban infrastructure improvements that will no doubt also increase \nthe access of the rural hinterland to both employment and income opportunities.14 The UDAAs \nwill also contribute about $163,000 each to the Project, through subloans from the Government \nusing  the  ADB  loan  proceeds.15  Financial  projections  for  the  four  towns  indicate  that  the  debt \nservicing requirements of these subloans will not impose an unduly heavy financial burden on \nthe  UDAAs    (i.e.,  calculated  debt  service  ratios  ranged  from  3.19  to  15.43).  The summary \nfinancial  projections  for  the  UDAAs  of  Pakxhan,  Phonsvanh,  Vang  Vieng,  and  Xam  Neua  are \ndiscussed in Supplementary Appendix E. \n\n                                                                 \n13  These  cost  recovery  policy  reform  measures  were  initiated  by  the  Vientiane  Urban  Development Administration \nAuthority (VUDAA) as part of the ongoing Vientiane Urban Infrastructure and Services Project, making the process \nof  replication  easier.  Urban  obligation  fee  refers  to  the  district  obligation  fee  relating  to  buildings  as  stated  in  the \nDecision of the Governor of Vientiane Prefecture, dated 25 October 2000.   \n\n14  These subsidies are consistent with the principles outlined in ADB\u2019s guidelines on subsidies.  \n15  These  subloans  correspond  to  the  vehicle  and  equipment  cost  of  the  proposed  solid  waste  and  septage \nmanagement improvements in each selected small town. UDAAs will have the capacity to repay these subloans \nthrough the imposition of user charges in the form of solid waste collection and septic cleaning fees.  The subloans \nwill carry an interest rate of 6.7% per annum, with a maturity of 15 years following subproject completion, including \na grace period of 3 years.  Contributions in kind from the villages and the UDAAs as well as the provinces will lower \nthese subloans. \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 31 October 2002) \n \n\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "kip (KN) \n$0.00007032 \nKN10,760.00 \n", "    Currency Unit   \n          KN1.00   \n             $1.00   \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n", "The  exchange  rate  of  the  kip  is  determined  by  the  Bank  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic \nunder a system of managed float.
