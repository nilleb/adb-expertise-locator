The  emergency  assistance  will  (i)  rehabilitate  or  construct  hospitals  and  medical \nfacilities  in  the  most  affected  areas,  (ii)  procure  medicines  and  medical  equipment,  and  (iii) \nsupport capacity building and resilience strengthening of the national health system to respond to \npublic health emergencies including coronavirus disease (COVID-19). \n \nIn line with the National Emergency Response Plan for Coronavirus 2020 (NERP)1 and \n2. \nthe  fragile  and  conflict-affected  situations  (FCAS)  approach  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB), the emergency assistance will support the Government of Afghanistan in its response to \nthe COVID-19 pandemic.2 The proposed emergency assistance responds to the government\u2019s \nrequest  to  ADB  made  on  16  March  2020  for  emergency  response  and  resilience  building  for \nCOVID-19.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nCOVID-19  has  spread  rapidly  and  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  declared  it  a \n3. \nglobal pandemic on 11 March 2020. More than 3.34 million individuals have tested positive and it \nhas caused an estimated 238,380 deaths globally (as of 2 May 2020).4 In many countries, the \nactual number of infected people is difficult to estimate, given low testing capacity and rates. The \nrate of the infection depends on a country\u2019s initial response; social distancing measures; the risk \nprofile of the population; and the resources used to undertake surveillance and testing, and to \nprovide  health  services.  These  factors  greatly  influence  the  number  of  COVID-19  infected \npersons, death rates, and recovery time.   \n \n4. \nAfghanistan is a landlocked country bordering Iran; the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC); \nPakistan; and the Central Asian Republics of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. It is an \nintegral part of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program.5 Regional \nconnectivity is vital for trade, transit, and Afghan employment in the region and remittances to the \ncountry. The two neighboring countries that have had major COVID-19 epidemics are the PRC \nand  Iran,  both  of  which  have  people  and  trade  linkages  with  Afghanistan.  The  spread  in  Iran \ncontinues  at  an  alarming  rate,  with  90,500 cases  and  5,710 deaths  officially  reported  as  of  26 \nApril 2020.6 Pakistan has also witnessed a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths. \n\n2020.

Iran says Covid-19 cases surpass 90,000 as death toll declines. Paris. (26 April 2020) \n\n \n\n\fThe vulnerability of migrants returning from Iran and Pakistan is one of the biggest challenges \nfacing  Afghanistan. More  than  240,000  Afghans  returned from Iran from  1  January  to  11  April \n2020, while 70,000 returned from Pakistan from 6 to 9 April 2020.7 These returning Afghans travel \nacross the country, often returning to their home provinces. \n \n5. \nAfghanistan  is  facing  a  COVID-19  emergency.  Given  the  extremely  limited  border \nsurveillance and testing capacity, minimal early COVID-19 detection and isolation takes place. \nGiven the number of returnees and the nature of the virus, community transmission is likely to \nhappen at scale, potentially leading to a large number of infected people. In addition, while health \nsector service delivery has improved over the last 15 years, it lacks the capacity to respond to the \nCOVID-19. The situation is complicated given the insecurity, political uncertainty and poverty.8 \n \n\n1. \n\nCOVID-19 Emergency Situation  \n\n   \n6. \nAfghanistan is in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014its first reported case was \nconfirmed on 22 February 2020 and it had 2,335 confirmed cases and 68 reported deaths as of \n2  May  2020,  with  the  number  of  cases  rapidly  increasing.9  COVID-19  is  a  public  health \nemergency,  which  is  aggravated  by  the  country\u2019s  constrained  health  sector  infrastructure  and \ncapacity  to:  (i)  respond  adequately  to  the  expected  scale  of  the  epidemic,  (ii)  provide  basic \nservices to restrict the spread of COVID-19, and (iii) deliver essential treatment services to the \npopulation. The country has 10,400 public hospital beds, of which only 991 have been allocated \nto treat COVID-19 patients (footnote 1). The testing for COVID-19 remains very limited. To scale \nup testing efforts, WHO has supported the government to establish eight testing facilities which \nare able to process an average of 100-150 tests in each laboratory  per day.10 The government \nrecognized the public health risks and initiated lockdown measures in various parts of the country. \n \n7. \nCOVID-19  will  result  in  severe  social  and  economic  dislocation.  Analysis  by  the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast that the COVID-19 pandemic will significantly affect \nthe country\u2019s economic prospects for 2020\u2014increasing unemployment; and reducing remittance \ninflows, regional trade, government revenue, and overall economic activity.11 It will significantly \naffect household employment levels and livelihoods, threaten food security, and increase poverty \nrates  (estimated  at  55%  in  2017).12  Analysis  by  the  Biruni  Institute  estimated  that  8  million \nadditional people could be at risk of falling below the poverty line if economic crisis materializes \nin  2020.13  More  detailed  analysis  is  presented  in  the  Summary  Assessment  of  Damage  and \nNeeds.14 \n \n\n2. \n\nNational Emergency Response Plan  \n\n \n8. \nThe Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) prepared the NERP in March 2020, in coordination \nwith  relevant  ministries  and  agencies  (footnote  1).  The  NERP  incorporates  the  COVID-19 \npreparedness and response plans of WHO and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF). \nThe  plan  aims  to  address  the  evolving  demands  of  COVID-19.

Besides  a \nneeds assessment, the NERP details the core elements and resource requirements to prevent \nfurther spread, detect cases, and respond to the health emergency. It covers surveillance and \ndetection; early diagnosis, isolation, and case management; infection prevention and control in \nhealth facilities and communities; health promotion and risk mitigation; effective coordination and \nresource mobilization; and effective and timely logistics support for emergency responses.  \n\n \n\n9. \nThe NERP provides the framework for coordinated support of each core element and has \nidentified key development partners to provide this funding. The indicative costings of the plan \nare based on three scenarios for different rates of infection. At this stage, the most relevant is the \nintermediate  scenario  (with  social  distancing),  resulting  in  190,000  infected  persons  with  an \nindicative  cost  for  response  of  $323  million.  Given  the  government\u2019s  tight  fiscal  space  for \nbudgetary  resources,  and  dependence  on  development  partners  for  the  operating  and \ndevelopment budget, the planned funding is largely dependent on development partner support. \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) has allocated an initial $25 million for critical medical supplies; and \nhospital infrastructure in Herat and Nimruz provinces, near the border with Iran.15 \n \n10. \nAs part of this coordinated support, on 16 March 2020 the government requested ADB to \nprovide $40 million emergency assistance to prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic \nto  strengthen  the  national  public  health  response;  build  resilience;  rehabilitate  and  construct \nhospitals and medical facilities in the most vulnerable provinces; and procure medical equipment, \nsupplies,  and  medicines.  The  support  requested  covers  improving  COVID-19  hospital  patient \nassessment,  management,  and  treatment  by  focusing  on  critical  hospital  medical  facility \ninfrastructure  (isolation  wards  and  intensive  care  units);  medical  equipment  and  supplies;  and \ncapacity  development  and  resilience.  This  was  identified  as  a  critical  gap.  The  health  sector \ndevelopment  partners  will  undertake  the  earlier  stages  of  initial  infection  identification  at  local \nclinics, as well as COVID-19 public awareness, testing, and assessment, under new or existing \nnational programs that will be expanded. \n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nDevelopment Partner Coordination  \n\n \n11. \nBased  on  the  NERP,  the  MOF\u2014in  liaison  with  the  MOPH\u2014is  working  with  key \ndevelopment  partners  to  ensure  close  coordination  of  the  COVID-19  priority  support. \nAfghanistan\u2019s  health  sector,  led  by  the  MOPH,  has  been  working  mainly  with  the  Afghanistan \nReconstruction Trust Fund development partners and the World Bank, WHO, UNICEF, and the \nEuropean Union.16  These development partners are expanding their engagement, and in some \ncases repurposing their programs to cover COVID-19 related interventions. The government has \nestablished  a  High-Level  Emergency  Coordination  Committee,  with  various  technical  working \ngroups. The Afghanistan President is guiding COVID-19 support and responses, and the second \nVice-President chairs and coordinates the high-level committee.  \n \n12. \nADB\u2014in  consultation  with  relevant  government  ministries,  development  partners,  and \nUnited Nations (UN) agencies\u2014undertook a needs assessment, identified the priorities under the \nNERP,  and  determined the  funding  gaps (footnote  14).  The  NERP  permits  the  use  of  existing \nsystems  and  expertise  to  fast-track  procurement  and  implementation.  In  consultation  with  the \n\n \n\n15  The  Office  of  the  President  announced  the  government\u2019s  $25  million  allocation  for  the  COVID-19  response  on \n\n25 February 2020. www.president.gov.af/da/?p=24339.  \n\n16  On  11  April,  the  European  Union  announced  \u20ac117  million  ($128  million)  for  Afghanistan  to  fight  the  coronavirus \npandemic.

WHO and UNICEF are \ninvolved in response planning, mobile clinics, training programs, and the provision of equipment \nand medical supplies. The governments of the PRC and the United Arab Emirates have provided \nCOVID-19  testing  kits.  ADB  support  creates  important  synergies  with  the  support  provided  by \nthese development partners, which is detailed in the Emergency Assistance Coordination.19    \n \n14. \nThe government and development partners are also working together to understand the \nwider economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including food security, poverty, \nand  economic  growth;  and  the  disproportionate  effect  on  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  including \nreturnees  and  internally  displaced  people.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  also  increased  the \nvulnerability of women to gender-based violence and falling into poverty, and has made it more \ndifficult for them to access health services. The government has initiated actions for multisector \ninterventions, with development partner support, to address economic and social welfare impacts. \nIMF has provided a range of support including a $220 million Rapid Credit Facility to Afghanistan \nto help meet the fiscal and balance of payments needs stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.20 \nOther development partners, such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), are \nconsidering assistance targeting the most vulnerable groups of society.21  \n \n15. \nADB\u2019s  initial  response  is  focusing  on  the  most  urgent  priorities  identified  by  the \ngovernment.  In  line  with  its  comprehensive  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  ADB  will \nconsider  further  support,  including  assistance  related  to  food  security  and  countercyclical \nsupport.22  Given  Afghanistan\u2019s  strategic  location  as  a  land  bridge  between  Central  and  South \nAsia, the country\u2019s control of the spread of COVID-19 will have important benefits for its neighbors \nand more broadly for the CAREC subregion. ADB will provide support in areas such as regional \npublic goods, mitigating risks at the borders, and enhancing collaboration and knowledge sharing \non responding effectively to the pandemic.23 \n\n \n\nProject Description   \n\nB. \n \n\n \n\n17  World Bank.

It is also considering medium-term countercyclical support. \n\n23 One of the Technical Assistance projects which will support the ADB\u2019s efforts is the Regional Support to Address the \nOutbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019. ADB. 2020. Technical Assistance Report: Regional Support to Address the \nOutbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Potential Outbreaks of Other Communicable Diseases. Manila \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  Protect  the  people  from  the  spread  of \n16. \ncoronavirus epidemic and limit its devastating consequences (footnote 1). The project will have \nthe following outcome: COVID-19 surveillance and treatment improved.24 \n \nOutput 1: Hospitals and medical facilities rehabilitated or constructed. This output \n17. \nwill support the construction of hospitals on existing hospital land that is owned by the MOPH or \nthe  government,  comprising  isolation  wards  and  intensive  care  units.  It  will  also  include  the \nrehabilitation of medical facilities following the \u201cbuild back better\u201d principle.25 In coordination with \nthe UN agencies, the government has formulated a list of high-priority provinces to be targeted. \nIn line with this list, the emergency assistance will support the rehabilitation of five hospitals and \nmedical facilities and the construction of 10 hospitals using prefabricated technology (about 750 \nnew hospital beds) under Phase 1 and construction of an additional five hospitals (about 400 new \nhospital beds) under Phase 2. The medical facilities will comply with international isolation ward \nstandards  and  will  include  utilities  such  as  energy-efficient  power  generators,  including,  where \nappropriate, solar power; water, sanitation, and hygiene corners; standard ventilation and heating \nsystems; and waste management systems.26 The new facilities will be constructed and equipped \nto ensure continued use after COVID-19. Afghanistan has 0.5 hospital beds per 1,000 population, \nwhich is below the regional average.27 Most hospitals have no critical care beds. The government \nhas committed to ensure long-term sustainability and appropriate staffing of these facilities. These \nfacilities  will  be  women-friendly  and  culturally  sensitive,  and  help  address  issues  related  to \nmaternal and child health in the longer term, including access to services.   \n  \n18. \nOutput  2:  Medicines  and  medical  equipment  supplied.  This  output  will  support  and \nstrengthen the procurement of medical equipment, furniture, supplies, and quality medicines to \nensure  that  the  new  medical  facilities  created  under  output  1  are  fully  operational.  It  will  also \nprovide  support  for  the  government  response  to  COVID-19  through  procurement  of  urgent \nmedicines, medical equipment, and supplies. The items will be procured following a list prepared \nby the MOPH, which is based on the WHO recommended list. The list of medicines and equipment \nhas been discussed with other development partners, including the World Bank and UN agencies, \nto avoid duplication of efforts. The MOPH will review the list periodically to align the inventory with \nthe evolving WHO recommendations. \n \nOutput 3: Capacity development and resilience building strengthened. This output \n19. \nwill support strengthening of the national health system preparedness and capacity to respond to \npublic  health  emergencies,  including  COVID-19,  and  strengthen  resilience  to  future  hazard \nevents. It has five subcomponents. First, it will support the implementation of the MOPH capacity \nbuilding  plan  to  respond  to  COVID-19.28  The  MOPH  plan  aims  to  strengthen  the  capacity  and \nknowledge of (i) the health workforce on the management of COVID-19 suspected and confirmed \ncases; (ii) health workers and support staff on infection prevention and control measures at the \nhealth  facilities;  and (iii)  rapid  response teams,  in  both rural  and  urban  settings,  to respond to \nCOVID-19 outbreaks in a timely manner. The delivery of these capacity and knowledge building \n\n \n\n24  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n25  \u201cBuild  back  better\u201d  refers  to  \u201cthe  use of  the  recovery,  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction phases  after a  disaster to \nincrease the  resilience  of nations  and  communities  through  integrating  disaster  risk  reduction  measures  into  the \nrestoration of physical infrastructure and societal systems, and into the revitalization of livelihoods, economies and \nthe environment.\u201d United Nations General Assembly. 2016.  \n\n26 The construction of water, sanitation, and hygiene corners in health care facilities will improve hygiene and health \nbehavior.  The design  of  waste  management  systems  will  consider  ADB\u2019s  guidance  note on  managing infectious \nmedical waste. ADB. 2020. Managing Infectious Medical Waste during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Manila. \n\n27  World Bank. DataBank. Hospital Beds (per 1,000 people).  \n28  The MOPH developed a concept note on the Capacity Building of Health Care Workers in Afghanistan as Part of \n\nAfghanistan COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\factivities will be carried out through training of trainers and online trainings. Second, the output \nwill support the development of the skills and capacity to ensure that new medical facilities funded \nunder output 1 have staff with the necessary medical expertise related to infection, prevention, \ntesting, and risk management; and have knowledge on how to use and distribute the equipment \nfunded  by  ADB.  Third,  it  will  support  strengthening  of  the  government\u2019s  capacity  to  build  and \nimprove resilience to future epidemics and pandemics as well as COVID-19. Fourth, the output \nwill support strengthening of the existing project management unit within the MOPH (established \nunder the ongoing World Bank grant assistance), by providing additional consultant support, to \nensure  effective  implementation.  Fifth,  a  third-party  monitoring  (TPM)  firm  will  be  engaged  to \nmonitor compliance with ADB safeguard policies and monitor quality of facilities created under \noutput 1. The capacity building will be coordinated with regional technical assistance under the \nCAREC framework to support information and knowledge sharing with other CAREC members, \ninvolving the WHO Regional Office where possible.    \n \n20. \nEmergency assistance eligibility. The proposed emergency assistance grant meets all \nthe eligibility criteria and relevant characteristics for ADB\u2019s emergency assistance financing, as it \n(i)  helps rebuild  high-priority  physical  assets  (e.g., hospitals  and  medical  facilities)  and restore \neconomic,  social,  and  governance  activities;  (ii)  is  designed  to  mitigate  immediate  losses  to \npriority assets, capacity, or productivity; (iii) provides immediate short-term transitional assistance; \n(iv)  is  restricted  to  the  transition  phase  and  exclusively  for  priority  rehabilitation;  and \n(v) complements  the  efforts  of  other  development  partners  to  ease  the  transition  from  relief  to \nnormal development. 29 \n \nC. \n \n21. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic is an emergency that will have wider economic impacts on the \npopulation, with loss of life, reduced economic opportunities, increased poverty, and lower growth. \nSupporting  the  government\u2019s  efforts  is  a  crucial  value  addition,  and  involves  an  expansion  in \nADB\u2019s portfolio to the health sector. ADB\u2019s existing portfolio engagement with infrastructure sector \ninvestments will remain essential for the economic recovery from this pandemic. In coordination \namong  the  development  partners,  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  create  synergies  and  ensure  the \nsustainability of the health sector outcomes.30  \n \n22. \nOther health sector development partners focused mainly on service delivery and human \nresources capacity, while investment in core infrastructure has been limited. Taking into account \nthe  priorities  established  by  the  NERP,  ADB\u2019s  emergency  assistance  will  expand  COVID-19 \npatient treatment facilities and hospitals. The facilities will be fully operational with trained staff. \nADB\u2019s experience in infrastructure policy, planning and development in Afghanistan will enable a \nseamless expansion to cover  health sector engagement. The  project will mainstream the use of \nprefabrication technology for health infrastructure, enabling quicker and high-quality construction \nof hospitals and medical facilities that an experienced local firm with countrywide access will build. \n  \n23. \nThe  emergency  assistance  provides  an  integrated  approach  to  improving  patient \ntreatment  and  management  through  developing  emergency  facilities  and  system  capacity,  to \nrespond  to  future  infectious  diseases;  and  will  support  improving  women\u2019s  access  to  medical \ntreatment, and better maternal and child health outcomes, in the longer term. Given Afghanistan\u2019s \n\nValue Added by ADB  \n\n \n\n29  ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila. \n30  The World Bank project builds on its current engagement in Afghanistan\u2019s health sector, which is focused on soft \ncomponents such as testing and surveillance, strengthening of provincial hospitals, capacity building of doctors and \nnurses, equipment, awareness raising, and monitoring systems. ADB and the World Bank agreed that the two grants \ncomplement each other and that ADB assistance addresses urgent gaps in the overall response to COVID-19. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\flocation  at  the  crossroads  of  Central  Asia,  its  control  of  the  spread  of  COVID-19  will  have \nimportant  benefits  for  its  neighbors.  The  emergency  assistance  will  follow  an  FCAS-sensitive \napproach to ensure that it responds to the unique context in Afghanistan, which requires additional \nsupport during design and implementation as well as additional measures in terms of oversight \nand due diligence.31 \n  \nD. \n \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $40,800,000  (Table  1).  Detailed  cost  estimates  by \n24. \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).32 \nThe major expenditure items are civil works, supply of medicines and equipment, and consulting \nservices, inclusive of taxes and duties.  \n \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA. \n\nBase Costb \n1. \n2. \n3. \n \nContingenciesc \n \n \n\nOutput 1: Hospitals and medical facilities rehabilitated or constructed \nOutput 2: Medicines and medical equipment supplied  \nOutput 3: Capacity development and resilience building strengthened  \nSubtotal (A) \n\n \nB. \n \na  Includes taxes and duties of $2.1 million approximately, to be financed from Asian Development Bank (ADB) grant \n\nTotal (A+B) \n\nAmounta \n \n15.8 \n18.4 \n2.6 \n36.8 \n4.0 \n40.8 \n\nb  Includes land provided by the government for the construction of the hospitals and medical facilities, which has been \n\nresources.  \n\nestimated at $0.8 million approximately.   \n\nc  Physical and price contingencies are included.

Price \ncontingencies are computed for outputs 1 and 3 as follows: for foreign exchange costs, at 0.75% in 2020 (50% of the \nannual rate) and 1.5% in 2021; and for local currency costs, at 1.75% in 2020 (50% of the annual rate) and 4.5% in \n2021. For output 2, given the high global demand for COVID-19 equipment and supplies, and price movement, a \nprice contingency of 11% is used in 2020. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n25. \nThe government has requested an emergency assistance grant not exceeding $40 million \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  to  finance  the  project. \nRetroactive  financing  of  up  to  30%  is  also  requested  for  eligible  expenditures  incurred  from \n25 February  2020.33  ADB  will  review  related  government  expenditures  for  eligibility  to  be \nreimbursed.  \n \n26. \nThe summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to \ncivil  works, medical  equipment  and  supplies,  consulting  services  and  project  administration  as \nwell as related taxes and duties. The government will provide in-kind support, including land for \nconstruction,  medical  facilities  for  rehabilitation,  office  space  in  Kabul,  and  counterpart  staff. \nClimate change mitigation finance is estimated at $1 million, of which 100% will be financed by \nADB.34 \n \n\n \n\n31  Some of the key measures are described in the enhanced project delivery approach paper.

The executing agency will be the MOPH. The deputy minister for policy \nand planning in the MOPH will serve as the project coordinator, with support from the Sehatmandi \nCoordination  Office  (SCO)  of  the  MOPH,  which  will  coordinate  project  activities  with  all \nstakeholders. Project oversight will be provided through the government\u2019s COVID-19 Emergency \nResponse  Committee,  which  will  meet  regularly  to  review  the  project\u2019s  progress,  ensure \ncoordinated efforts by all stakeholders, and conduct annual project reviews. Through its central \ndepartments and provincial offices, the MOPH will be responsible for project implementation. The \nPresidential Multisectoral COVID-19 Response Committee will guide the multisector aspects of \nthe  emergency  response.  The  implementing  unit  of  the  MOPH\u2019s  grant  and  services  contract \nmanagement  unit  for  consulting  services  will  undertake  procurement  activities.  The  MOPH\u2019s \ncapacity will be augmented with additional staff (consultants) to implement the ADB project. The \nprocurement will be supported by the procurement directorate at MOPH, which has three units: \n(i) consultant management, (ii) construction, and (iii) goods. The additional staff will be selected \nas individual consultants under the proposed grant to cover the capacity gaps. \n \n28. \nFor the construction of hospitals and medical facilities under output 1, the MOPH will work \nclosely with WHO and the MOF to ensure the medical facilities are designed to meet international \nstandards and are adequately staffed. The facilities will be designed and built to allow conversion \nto  regular medical  facilities  after the  pandemic. Because  of  the  emergency  situation, the rapid \nneed for mobilization, and the inability of international contractors to access remote provinces, \nthe MOPH will engage the following state-owned enterprises (SOEs) on a direct contracting basis \nto  build  these  medical  facilities:  the  Housing  Construction  Corporation  (HCC),  as  the  prime \ncontractor35 and Banayee Construction Corporation (BCC), as the subcontractor.36 These SOEs \nreport  directly  to  the  Administrative  Office  of  the  President  and  they  own  the  required \nprefabrication technology and manufacturing facilities. They recently completed the construction \nof a new hospital in Herat in less than 1 month and are constructing another hospital in Nimruz in \nresponse  to  COVID-19.  In  addition,  they  previously  completed  several  projects  using \nprefabrication technology for the construction of urban housing and schools. An assessment of \nthese SOEs indicates sufficient construction capacity. These construction companies will also be \ntasked with rehabilitating existing hospitals to expand hospital service capacity. Payments will be \nmade on the delivery of the outputs, as verified by a TPM firm.  \n\n \n\n35  Housing Construction Corporation was established in 1962 as an SOE under the supervision of the Ministry of Public \nWork. It was later transferred to the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing. Housing Construction Corporation \nhas the sole prefabricated technology factory, with production capacity of 610,000 square meters of construction. \n36  Banayee  Construction  Corporation  was  established  in  1967  with  the  aim  of  offering  standard  services  in  the \nconstruction sector and competing with the private sector. It is a profitable unit with a presence in many provinces, \nwhich rapidly completed several government projects such as the reconstruction of the National Assembly Complex. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f \n29. \nThe government is establishing the National Development Corporation (NDC), which will \nmerge (i) BCC, (ii) Helmand Construction Corporation, (iii) Afghani Construction Corporation, (iv) \nHCC, (v) Ghouri Cement Factory, (vi) Jabal Siraj Cement Factory, (vii) Northern Coal Corporation, \n(viii) Arzaq Corporation, (ix) Nangrahar Valley Agricultural Corporation, and (x) Metal Corporation. \nThe  purpose  of  this  merger  is  to  modernize  and  mechanize  the  corporations\u2019  operations  to \nachieve  a  high  standard  of  implementation  and  construction  of  infrastructure.  The  NDC  was \nfounded following Presidential Decree No. 28, dated 3 February 2020, but its legal incorporation \nhas not yet been completed\u2014pending cabinet approval. Once it is fully incorporated, the legal \nobligations of the HCC and BCC will be transferred to the NDC, which will be the legal successor \nto these construction companies.    \n \nFor the procurement of medicines, supplies, and medical equipment under output 2, the \n30. \nMOPH will (i) directly contract UN agencies (including WHO and UNICEF) for the procurement of \nsupplies  and  equipment  and  its  installation;  and  (ii)  use  reputable  suppliers  procured  by  the \ngovernment  under  the  national  procurement  systems,  consistent  with  the  ADB  Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time). The UN agencies have signed supply frameworks \nwith  a  large  global  network  of  manufacturers  and  suppliers.  The  goods  purchased  from  these \nsuppliers comply with the applicable health standards and undergo extensive quality assurance. \nTo  ensure  timely  delivery  of  these  items,  air  freight  will  be  required,  but  delays  are  expected \nconsidering the shortage of COVID-19 related supplies. The UN agencies also have extensive \npresence in Afghanistan to ensure quick deployment and installation of the equipment. Because \nof the nature of the emergency situation, tight global markets, and the need to procure medicines \nand equipment quickly, the procurement could involve suppliers from non-ADB member countries, \nso ADB will apply universal procurement at the government\u2019s request (footnote 3).  \n \n31. \nFor  capacity  and  resilience  development  under  output  3,  consulting  services  will  be \ndelivered under the umbrella and guidance of WHO and UNICEF. The capacity building activities \nwill also include the development of online materials. The capacity building component will focus \non training medical personnel (doctors and nurses) to manage COVID-19 related activities and \nother potential communicable disease outbreaks in the future. The MOPH, World Bank, and ADB \nclosely coordinated the capacity building component to ensure no duplication. WHO and UNICEF \nwill be engaged on a single source selection basis, since these agencies have been working in \nthese thematic areas, they have the capacity to mobilize technical resources at short notice, and \nthey can operate in remote areas that are threatened by security issues.  \n \nBecause of the envisaged challenges of ADB personnel accessing the site to verify the \n32. \nquality of the civil works construction, this component will include a TPM firm to ensure that the \nnew medical facilities comply with the technical specifications and ADB policies before handing \nover to the MOPH. The TPM firm will provide periodic progress reports and will conduct on-site \ninspections. Given the urgency, a TPM firm that was engaged under other ADB projects will be \nengaged  on  a  single  source  selection  basis  to  monitor  the  delivery  of  the  outputs.

The  expertise  will  include  project  coordination,  financial  management, \nenvironmental  safeguards,  procurement,  contract  management,  accountancy,  and  monitoring \nand evaluation. The terms of reference for all consultants are in the PAM.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n34. \nThe  fact-finding  for  the  project  was  undertaken  initially  in  country,  then  remotely  with \nextensive  videoconferencing  because  of  the  COVID-19  movement  limitations.  This  constraint, \ncombined with security issues, limited the conduct of due diligence on the provincial hospital sites. \nInformation  and  reports  shared  by  the  MOPH  and  other  development  partners,  related  sector \nstudies have provided the basis for the assessment of the sector status and issues (footnote 14). \nThe prioritization of hospital sites is based on expected COVID-19 incidence, the population risk \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fprofile, and community access to a support facility. Given the short construction period, the site \npriorities can be adjusted if the COVID-19 incidence changes. The sites are expected to be in \nurban and semi-urban areas with no or limited exposure to climate-related natural hazards, so \nthe project is rated low for climate risk. \n  \n35. \nThe  prefabricated  structures  will  be  constructed  by  the  HCC  and  BCC,  which  have \nextensive  expertise  in  the  construction  of  urban  infrastructure  (para.  28).  These  companies \ncompleted  the  construction  of  a  hospital  in  Herat  in  less  than  1  month,  and  are  constructing \nanother  in  Nimruz.  They  have  demonstrated  the  ability  to  deliver  quality  results  in  the  difficult \nCOVID-19 context. Unlike international contractors, these companies can work in different parts \nof Afghanistan, despite security issues. Prefabricated construction technology will be used, based \non  international  standards  (with  a  physical  life  of  30  years),  with  templates  prepared  for  two \nconfigurations:  100-bed  and  50-bed  hospitals,  with  the  technical  specifications  for  these \nstructures  to  be  reviewed  by  the  MOPH  and  WHO.  The  proposed  pricing  of  the  structures  is \nconsistent with the international benchmarks for similar prefabricated works. The equipment and \nsupplies  for  these  medical  facilities  will  be  procured  by  the  MOPH  under  output  2,  in  close \ncoordination with the World Bank and WHO, to ensure consistency across the health sector.   \n \n36. \nThe  staffing  and  operation  of  the  new  hospitals  and  medical  facilities  will  be  the \nresponsibility of the hospital service providers or the MOPH, where applicable. The staff will be \ntrained in infection prevention and control, and diagnosis and case management of COVID-19 \npatients, as part of output 3. Most of these trainings can be provided online. \n \nB. \n \n37. \nAfghanistan is expected to suffer a significant economic impact because of COVID-19. If \nleft unmitigated, almost the entire population would be infected in the worst case scenario, while \ndeaths  could  reach more  than  77,000.37  In the  short  run,  COVID-19  will  overwhelm the  health \nsystem, which is unable to cope with the increased need for intensive care, protective equipment, \nand  human  resources. COVID-19  will  have  debilitating  effects  on  human  capital  through \nadditional  deaths,  and  potential  impacts  on  other  essential  health  services  that  can  lead  to \nincreased  morbidities.  The  project  outputs  are  expected  to  expand  COVID-19  treatments  and \nimprove  hospital  services  at  provincial  hospitals,  preventing  the  loss  of  human  capital  and \naddressing short- and medium-term gaps in the health system. Because of the short processing \ntime  available \nfollowing  ADB  guidelines  on  economic \nanalysis,38 economic  due  diligence  will  be  conducted  within  the  first  2  months  of  project \nimplementation. The  project  administration  budget  will  include  resources  to  undertake  the \nnecessary economic analysis, in compliance with ADB requirements.  \n \n38. \nAs basic public health services are provided free in Afghanistan, the project outputs are \npublic service goods with no opportunity for cost recovery, so no financial viability assessment is \nrequired. Hospital and medical facility buildings and structures, and medical equipment procured \nunder the project, will be maintained under the MOPH.39 While this will be assessed during project \nimplementation, government commitment has also been obtained as a grant assurance. \n \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability  \n\nthe  emergency  response, \n\nfor \n\n \n\n37  Figures assume an R naught of 3.3.

The proposed prefabricated technology is reliable, long-lasting, and proven \nfor construction prevalent in other parts of the world. The expanded facilities will be designed in \na women-friendly and culturally sensitive way, with appropriate facilities and equipment for female \npatients and medical staff. In the longer term, the facilities will improve access for women to sexual \nand  reproductive  health  services.  The  facilities  will  contribute  to  addressing  the  high  maternal \nmortality rate in Afghanistan and low access to health facilities for women in general. \n \n40. \nThe  sustainability  of  the  project  outcome  will  depend  on  the  capacity  of  the  medical \nprofessionals to operate the facilities. The required health workforce, including new staff, will be \ntrained under the project. The MOPH has committed to provide sufficient staff with appropriate \nskills, and to meet staff salaries and operation and maintenance costs. The MOPH will ensure \nthat  the  workforce  is  not  transferred  from  other  provincial  hospitals,  leaving  service  gaps  in  a \nconstrained  environment.  The  need  for  continued  surveillance  and  preparedness  for  similar \nepidemics  will  be  crucial  to  ensure  the  sustainability  and  readiness  of  response  systems.  The \ninclusion of suitable components in output 3, which targets capacity development, will contribute \nto such sustainability.  \n \nD. \n \nADB conducted a financial management assessment of the MOPH for the project.40 The \n41. \nreview  used  the  World  Bank\u2019s  2018  financial  management  assessment  of  the  MOPH;  and \nconsidered  lessons  learned  during  the  implementation  of  past  and  ongoing  projects,  various \nsector governance assessments, and interviews with project management unit and other relevant \ngovernment staff. While the MOPH has implementation experience in donor-funded projects, the \noverall  financial  management  risk  assessment  is  substantial.  This  risk  can  be  managed  by \nimplementing  the  mitigation  measures  agreed  with  the  MOPH,  including  (i)  deploying  project \nmanagement unit staff with prior ADB or World Bank project experience; and (ii) strengthening \ninternal controls and financial reporting based on detailed assessments. Financial management \nexperts funded by the project will be engaged to provide capacity building support and fiduciary \nrisk monitoring, including compliance with audited project financial statement requirements.  \n \n42. \nThe MOPH is responsible for ensuring an adequate audit trail, and an independent auditor \nacceptable  to  ADB  will  audit  the  annual  financial  statements  following  international  audit \nstandards.  As  detailed  under  the  procurement  arrangements (Table  3), single  source  or  direct \ncontracting will be used. Given the potential high risk of corruption and misuse of funds with non-\nUN suppliers, mitigation measures involving price validation and benchmarking will be used.41 \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n43. \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOPH.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures will be described in the PAM. \n \nE. \n \n44. \nGiven its high poverty rate (55% in 2017) and food insecurity level (45% in 2017), COVID-\n19 will have a devastating impact on Afghanistan\u2019s economy, with a disproportionate effect on the \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n40 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n41 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\fpoor  and  vulnerable  families,  including  returnees  and  internally  displaced  people.42  The  social \nimpact  of  the  pandemic  is  even  more  significant,  as  most  of  the  workers  are  employed  in  the \ninformal sector and are poorly paid or self-employed. People who are poor and malnourished or \nin poor health are more susceptible to infection. As the health services can only meet basic needs, \nthe health facilities will quickly be overwhelmed if the virus spreads widely, impacting the delivery \nof essential services such as maternal and child health programs.  \n \n45. \nThe MOF, World Bank, UNDP, ADB, and the IMF are analyzing the COVID-19 impacts, \nwith  declines  in  growth,  trade,  and  remittances;  decreases  in  government  revenue;  higher \nunemployment;  and  disruption  in  domestic  economic  activity.  The  government  requested \nassistance to address these economic and social impacts through other COVID-19 interventions \nto ensure access to basic food commodities and social services, and local employment.   \n\n \n\n46. \nThe emergency assistance is designed to target high-risk and priority areas. Combined \nwith other measures, it will reduce the COVID-19 spread and the expected loss of life by providing \nintegrated support for the government\u2019s response efforts. The emergency assistance will improve \naccess  to  hospital  facilities  for  COVID-19  medical  treatment;  provide  essential  equipment, \nsupplies, and medicines to treat the affected population; and support capacity building efforts to \nrespond to the crisis more effectively. These efforts will contribute to a reduction in the loss of life, \nhuman skills, and productivity; and could reduce the magnitude of the economic shock. These \nfactors should also help to reduce the overall impact on Afghanistan\u2019s poverty rate.   \n \n47. \nThe emergency assistance is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. It will support \nfacilities that are sensitive to gender and culture, such as dedicated wards for female patients and \nseparate office and lounge facilities for women doctors and nurses. The facilities will have all the \nequipment to treat critical care patients with COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, including \ninfected pregnant women, infected women delivering their babies, and their newborn babies. In \nthe long term, these rehabilitated medical facilities are expected to improve access to maternal \nand child health services. While all medical personnel will be provided with appropriate and well-\nfitting protective equipment, female staff will also receive menstrual kits as needed. Training on \nCOVID-19 treatment and surveillance will be provided to all medical staff, including women staff. \nOther  medical  support  staff,  including  female  staff,  will  also  be  provided  with  the  necessary \ntraining. Finally, the project will develop a gender-sensitive resilience strategy which will include \nimproved access for women to sexual and reproductive health services, and support mechanisms \nfor gender-based violence. \n \nF. \n \n48. \nsafeguard categories are as follows.43 \n  \n49. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  works  will  be  within  existing  hospitals  grounds.  An \nenvironmental assessment and review framework (EARF) has been prepared as per SPS. The \nEARF  identifies  the  impacts  that  are  likely  to  arise  during  various  phases  (construction  and \noperation).  Guidance  on  the  necessary  environmental  documents  to  be  prepared  during  the \nimplementation  stage  is  also  provided.  The  main  identified  impacts  during  construction  and \nrehabilitation  are  dust,  solid  waste,  and  occupational  and  community  health  and  safety  risks. \nImpacts during the operation phase are also expected from the storage and disposal of medical \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS,  2009),  the  project\u2019s \n\nSafeguards  \n\n42 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n43 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\fwaste. No initial environmental examination study will be required for the construction works to \nbe  carried  out  within  existing  facilities,  as  limited  impacts  are  envisaged.  The  contractor  will \nprepare a detailed Code of Construction Practice including an environmental management plan \n(EMP) for construction works at existing hospital locations. This will be approved by the MOPH \nbefore  the  commencement  of  any  works.  A  sample  Code  of  Construction  Practice  has  been \nprepared  as  part  of  the  EARF.  The  institutional  capacity  of  the  borrower  to  manage  the \nenvironmental risks and operational tasks in connection with health care waste is limited. To raise \nawareness and develop the capacity of the MOPH\u2014including the SCO, hospitals, health centers, \nand district administrations\u2014project activities to build environmental management capacity will \ninclude  training  programs  at  hospitals  and  health  centers  that  deal  with  hospital  and  domestic \nwaste management. Full-time environmental specialist in the MOPH will be recruited to ensure \nthe implementation of the EMP as well as prepare a medical waste management plan.  \n \n50. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). Hospitals and medical facilities proposed under \noutput 1 will be constructed on the existing hospital land owned by the MOPH or the government.  \noutputs  2  and  3  are  nonphysical  interventions  and  are  soft  components  that  do  not  entail  any \nconstruction activities. This project will not finance the construction of any structure that may entail \nany adverse land acquisition and resettlement impact.  \n \n51. \nThe absence of any adverse land acquisition and resettlement impacts will be confirmed \nthrough social safeguard due diligence, following the screening checklist (defined in the PAM and \nthe EARF) and the SPS. The results of such due diligence, including screening actions, will be \nsummarized in the social safeguard due diligence reports (DDRs). TPM firm will verify and confirm \nthe findings of the DDRs before their submission to ADB, as soon as the project site areas are \ndefined and before finalizing the bidding documents. The contract award and the commencement \nof any construction activities shall not be allowed before the compliance of the relevant DDR with \nthe proposed screening requirements and the SPS. The same social due diligence and screening \nmechanism will be applicable to all contract packages considered under retroactive and advance \nfinancing.  Social  safeguard  monitoring  will  be  conducted,  along  with  environmental  safeguard \nmonitoring, during project implementation. The monitoring results will be summarized in the social \nsafeguard section of the semiannual and annual safeguard monitoring reports.   \n \nits \n52. \n34 provinces.  None  are  considered  indigenous  peoples,  as  defined  by  the  SPS  for  project \noperation purposes. Afghan minority ethnic groups (mainly comprising Kuchi and Hazara) are not \nfound in the subproject areas, hence will not be impacted by the project in any manner. \n \nG. \n \n53. \nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan (footnote 41).
