An initial environmental examination was completed.  \n\nCategory  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples. \n\nthe \n\nfirst  component, \n\nthe  poor.  Under \n\nThe  Green  Power  Development  Project  has  two  components: \n(i)  regional  clean  power  trade,  and  (ii)  renewable  energy  access \nfor \nthe  Dagachhu \nhydropower development (a 114-megawatt [MW] run-of-river type) \naims  to  export  power  from  Bhutan  to  India  through  the  existing \ngrid  to  India.  The  rural  electrification  component  will  provide \naccess \nto  8,767 \nhouseholds  and  facilities  with  grid  extensions,  and  electricity \nsourced  from  solar  energy  to  119  remote  public  facilities  (e.g., \nschools,  health  clinics,  and  other  community  facilities)  on  an  off-\ngrid basis. \n\nto  electricity  sourced \n\nfrom  hydropower \n\nThe  Dagachhu  hydropower  development  will  be  promoted  by  a \njoint  venture  company  between  Druk  Green  Power  Corporation \n(DGPC)  in  Bhutan  and  Tata  Power  Company  (TPC)  in  India \nthrough  a  public\u2013private  partnership \nrural \nelectrification  component  will  be  mainly  served  by  Bhutan  Power \nCorporation (BPC), a public utility service company.  \n\n(PPP).  The \n\nBhutan has substantial clean and renewable hydropower capacity. \nTheoretical potential hydropower is 26,760 MW\u2014only about 6% is \nbeing  used.  Of  the  total  1,500  MW  installed,  80%  is  exported  to \nIndia after meeting domestic consumption. Power exports account \nfor the largest source of Government revenue in the form of taxes \nand  dividends  from  hydropower  companies.  Despite  the  nation\u2019s \nnet  power  surplus  for  export,  most  rural  residents  do  not  have \naccess to electricity. Only 40% of rural households use electricity \nas  their  main  source  of  lighting  as  compared  to  96.4%  of  urban \nhouseholds.  Expansion  of  rural  electrification  will  provide  access \nto  more  remote  rural  areas  where  the  costs  of  investment, \noperation,  and  maintenance  will  be  higher  due  to  low  population \n\n\fii\n\nImpact and Outcome \n\ndensity and unfavorable terrain.\n\nSince  about  70%  of  the  population lives  in  rural  areas,  electricity \nfor  all  is  a  significant  implementation  challenge.  Operating \nsubsidies  are  essential  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  expanding \nrural  electrification.  In  Bhutan,  subsidies  are  regulated  and \nprovided  from  royalty  revenues  yielded  from  power  exports  to \ncross-subsidize  electricity  prices,  in  particular  for  rural  domestic \ncustomers.  The  Government  distributes  the  remaining  power \nexport  revenues  to  support  socioeconomic  goals,  such  as  health \nand  education,  as  well  as  infrastructure  development,  e.g.,  rural \nroads  and  bridges.  Thus,  rural  electrification  and  hydropower \nexport  are  strongly  interrelated  with  inclusive  economic  growth \nand  poverty  reduction.  Expanding  generation  capacity  for  export \nand  rural  access  to  electricity  will  enhance  energy  and  social \nsecurity. \n\nThe  Government  aims  for  (i)  100%  electrification  by  2013,  and \n(ii)  an  additional  10,000  MW  of  hydropower  development  and \ntrading  by  2020.  In  rural  areas,  electricity  from  hydropower  and \nsolar sources will replace kerosene and fuelwood. Given the coal-\ndominated  Indian  power  market,  clean  energy  development  for \npower  export  will  promote  low-carbon  energy  sources  and  foster \neconomic cooperation in the South Asia region. \n\nlarge \n\nfor  Bhutan\u2019s  economy.  Given \nfor \n\nAccelerating  the  development  of  hydropower  for  export  is  of \nstrategic  significance \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s \ninfrastructure \nfiscal  capacity \nlimited \nprojects,  the  hydropower  development  strategy  is  to  leverage \npublic  and  private  investments  through  private  participation  in \ndevelopment  projects.  This  approach  is  expected  to  accelerate \nhydropower  development,  and  generate \nfor  more \nsocioeconomic  development.  To  promote  the  country\u2019s  strategy, \nthe  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  supported  the \nGovernment  in  establishing  a  policy  and  institutional  framework \nfor  public  and  private  participation  in  hydropower  development. \nThe Dagachhu hydropower development is a demonstration PPP \nfacility  in  line  with  the  Hydropower  Development  Policy,  which  is \nto  promote  private  and  foreign  investments  for  hydropower \ngeneration  in  Bhutan.  Further  TA  support  will  be  provided  to \ndevelop Government capacity for hydropower export. \n\nincome \n\nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  sustain  the  country\u2019s  inclusive \neconomic  growth  by  promoting  cross-border  power  trade  and \nelectricity access. As an outcome, the power sector is to improve \nthe coverage of distribution and expand electricity export through \nclean power development in a sustainable manner. Investment for \nDagachhu  hydropower  will  generate  a  long-term  revenue  stream \nfor  Bhutan  to  finance  its  enormous  development  needs  in  social \ninfrastructure, such as health and education, as well as economic \ninfrastructure facilities like roads and electricity supplies. They will \n\n\fOutput\n\niii\n\nform  the  basis  of  rural  development  and  poverty  reduction  in  the \ncountry. Investment for  rural electrification will improve access to \nelectricity by rural households and small businesses, and replace \nmore  expensive  and  polluting  kerosene  and  fuelwood  with \nrenewable  hydropower  and  solar  energy.  It  will  make  social \ninterventions  to  the  poor  and  improve  the  standard  of  living  and \nquality  of  life  of  people  living  in  rural  areas.  The  Dagachhu \ndevelopment will generate export revenues, which will be used for \nrural \nsubsidies \nelectrification, while exporting power to India through which cross-\nborder  cooperation  and  regional  energy  efficiency  will  be \nenhanced.\n\nlow-cost  power  supplies \n\nto  maintain \n\nto \n\nRegional  Clean  Power  Trade.  The  Dagachhu  hydropower \ndevelopment will be a 114 MW run-of-river, with minimal adverse \nenvironmental and social impacts. Generated power will be sold to \nIndia  through  the  existing  grid  connected  to  India.  As  the  first \nundertaking  of  a  commercial  nature  in  Bhutan,  the  Dagachhu \nplant  will  be  developed  through  PPP  to  leverage  private  capital \nand  maximize  the  impacts  of  the  government  investment.  DGPC \n(a  Bhutanese  state-owned  company)  and  TPC  (Indian  private \npower  company)  agreed  to  a  joint  venture  arrangement,  and \nDagachhu Hydro Power Corporation (DHPC) was incorporated as \nthe project special purpose company. The Government envisages \nthat  the  Dagachhu  development  will  be  a  pilot  case  to  catalyze \nprivate  participation  and  accelerate  hydropower  development. \nSince  the  Dagachhu  development  has  applied  for  the  United \nNations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  under  the \nClean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM)  as  defined  in  the  Kyoto \nProtocol,  it  will  be  a  showcase  cross-border  CDM  project.  These \noutputs  will  help  create  a  competitive  investment  environment  in \nregional power trading and clean energy development.  \n\nRenewable Energy Access for the Poor. The rural electrification \nsystem  will  be  extended  to  provide  clean  and  reliable  power \nsupply  to  rural  areas  mainly  in  seven  districts  of  Bhutan.  It  will \nelectrify  8,767  domestic  households  and  facilities  in  remote \ncentral and eastern regions. In addition to the grid extension, 119 \nsolar  photovoltaic  systems,  using  an  emerging  energy-efficient \ntechnology,  will  be  installed  to  support  electrification  in  isolated \noff-grid rural areas, especially schools, health clinics, monasteries, \nand other community facilities.   \n\nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $234.45 million, \nfinancing  charges,  comprising \nincluding  contingencies  and \n$201.47 million for regional clean power trade, and $32.98 million \nequivalent for renewable energy access for the poor.  \n\nProject Investment Plan\n\nFinancing Plan \n\nRegional  Clean  Power  Trade.  The  Dagachhu  hydropower \ndevelopment  will  cost  $201.47  million, \nincluding  debt  of \n$121.47 million (60%) and equity of $80.0 million (40%). ADB will \n\n\fiv\n\nfinance $80 million as anchor money to take a lead in the financial \nstructuring.  The  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  will  be  the  borrower  of  the \nADB  loans  from  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  and  hard-term \nAsian  Development  Fund  (ADF).  Of  the  $80  million,  ADB  will \nprovide  $51  million  (OCR)  to  the  debt  portion  of  the  Dagachhu \ndevelopment,  and  $29  million  (hard-term  ADF)  to  the  equity \nportion  through  lending  to  the  Government.  The  entire  equity  will \nbe \nthe \nGovernment,  DGPC,  and  National  Pension  and  Provident  Fund \n(NPPF); and the Indian private company, TPC. The debt balance \nis expected to be cofinanced by the Austrian Export Credit Agency \n(ECA) ($55.46 million) and NPPF ($15 million).  \n\nthrough  Bhutan\u2019s  public  sector \n\nincluding \n\nfunded \n\nRenewable  Energy  Access  for  the  Poor.  The  ADB  grant  of \n$25.28  million  equivalent  from  the  ADF  will  support  the  on-grid \ncomponent  for  rural  electrification.  The  Government  will  finance \nthe  balance  of  $6.64  million  equivalent.  The  Asian  Clean  Energy \nFund  (ACEF)  established  by  the  Government  of  Japan  and \nadministered  by  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility \n(CEFPF) is expected to provide an additional grant cofinancing of \n$1.00 million for the off-grid component for rural electrification.  \n\nSource\nADB \n     OCR loan \n     Hard-term ADF loan \n     ADF grant \nACEF under CEFPFa  \nSubtotal \n \nAustrian ECA \nGovernmentb\nTata Power Company \nTotal \n\nFinancing Plan\n($ million) \n\nDagachhu \nHydropower \n\nRural\nElectrification \n\n \n \n\n  51.00 \n29.00  \n \n \n80.00 \n55.46 \n45.01 \n21.00 \n201.47 \n\n25.28 \n1.00 \n26.28 \n \n6.70 \n\n32.98 \n\nTotal \n\n51.00 \n29.00 \n25.28 \n1.00a\n106.28 \n55.46 \n51.71 \n21.00\n234.45 \n\nACEF = Asian Clean Energy Fund, ADB = Asian Development Bank, CEFPF = \nClean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, ECA = export credit agency. \na Subject to approval from the Government of Japan. \nb Includes the Government-owned company (DGPC) and fund (NPPF). \n\nA  loan  of  $51,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  OCR  will  be  provided  under \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility.

Coupled  with  the  Hydropower \nDevelopment  Policy,  clean  and  renewable  energy  development \nand  trade  will  be  promoted  for  the  country\u2019s  and  region\u2019s \neconomic benefits.    \n\nlifeline \n\ntariff.  Since \n\nin  particular  under  a \n\nrural  electrification  will  contribute  significantly \n\nIn accordance with the Tariff Determination Regulations 2006, the \nroyalty  revenue  yielded  from  power  export  from  the  Dagachhu \ndevelopment will be used to subsidize electricity for rural domestic \ncustomers, \nthe \nGovernment estimates that more than 90% of the poor live in rural \nareas, \nto \nsocioeconomic  development  and  poverty  reduction  for  about \n9,000 households and 55,000 residents, representing almost 10% \nof  the  national  population.  Rural  electrification  is  expected  to \ncreate  opportunities  for  alternate  income-earning  avenues  and \ndevelopment  of  rural  industries,  and  improve  access  to  social \nservices  such  as  education  and  health.  After  implementation  of \nthe  component,  the  national  rural  electrification  ratio  is  expected \nto be increased to 84% from the current 60%. \n\nit \n\nresources \n\nto  allocate  more \n\nPower exports will increase the Government\u2019s  revenue base and \nenable \nto  socioeconomic \ndevelopment  including  health,  education,  and  rural  electrification. \nIn  2006/07,  revenues  from  power  exports  contributed  to  all  the \nexpenditures  for  the  agriculture  and  social  sectors  (e.g.,  health \nand  education).  During  the  next  five-year  plan,  the  Government \nconsiders that revenues from hydropower development will be the \nmajor sources to directly improve social quality of life and reduce \npoverty.  Incremental  income  from  power  exports  will  be  used  for \nimproving  and  expanding  road  and  bridge  infrastructure  to \npromote  rural  development  for  poverty  reduction.  The  enhanced \ntourism,  agribusiness,  and \ninfrastructure  will  encourage \ncommunication; and thus contribute to inclusive economic growth. \nIt  will  also  encourage  private  sector  operations  and  help  create \nnew employment opportunities.\n\nIn Bhutan, wood is still predominately used for fuel, especially by \nthe  poor  (with  83%  of  total  consumption);  electricity  and  gas  are \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions\n\nvii\n\nfor  cooking  by  urban  residents  (90%).  Rural \nwidely  used \nhouseholds  in  nonelectrified  villages  depend  on  kerosene  for \nlighting. Therefore, access to electricity sourced from hydropower \nand  solar  will  have  significant  positive  environmental  impacts, \nsuch  as  reduced  use  of  fossil  fuels  and  deforestation  due  to \nfirewood  harvesting.  Export  of  the  clean  power  surplus  will  lower \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  (500,000  tons  per  year)  of  the  coal-\ndominated Indian power market.\n\nDagachhu Hydropower. The main external risks relate to off-take \nand  CDM.  The  first  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  a  25-year  power \npurchase agreement with Tata Power Trading Company (TPTC). \nThe  agreement  has  a  constant  escalation,  which  will  make  the \ntariff  revision  risk  minimal.  The  small  size  of  the  114  MW \nDagachhu generation capacity will likely be absorbed by the vast \npower  demand\u2013supply  gap  in  India.  Second,  the  Dagachhu \nhydropower  development  is  based  on  the  assumption  that \nadditional  cash  flows  will  be  generated  from  the  sale  of  carbon \nemission  reductions,  however,  the  nature  of  a  post-2012  CDM \nframework  is  as  yet  unknown.  To  mitigate  the  risk  of  this \nuncertainty,  DHPC  and  TPTC  have  in  principle  agreed  for  the \npurchase of the emission reductions to be underwritten by TPTC \nover the 30 year duration at a specific minimum price.  \n\nPotential risks for the Dagachhu development include (i) increase \nin  prices  of  civil  works  and  equipment,  and  (ii)  delays  in  project \nimplementation  and  operation.  The  cost  and  time  overrun  risks \nare  to  be  mitigated  by  contractual  warranties  in  engineering, \nprocurement,  and  construction  contracts.  Sufficient  physical  and \nprice contingencies have been considered for any increase in the \nequipment  and  civil  works  costs.  The  implementation  capacity  of \nthe  development  sponsors  will  also  be  important.  The  main \ndeveloper,  DGPC,  has  implemented  hydropower  projects  with \nvarious  agencies  and  is  operating  four  hydropower  plants  in \nBhutan.  DHPC  is  adequately  staffed  with  personnel  experienced \nin  executing  hydropower  projects.  This  will  minimize  the  risk  of \ncost and time overruns, along with a PPP arrangement with TPC, \na joint venture partner, with extensive experience in implementing \nand operating hydropower projects worldwide. The Government of \nAustria  will \nfor \nimplementation and supervision during construction. \n\nto  strengthen  DHPC\u2019s  capacity \n\nfund  TA \n\nRural Electrification. Potential risks include (i) increase in cost of \nconstruction materials and transportation due to higher fuel prices, \n(ii)  construction  delays  due  to  procurement  and  contract  awards, \nand  (iii)  difficult  accessibility  due  to  undeveloped  access  roads. \nThese risks are to be mitigated by (i) adequate physical and price \ncontingencies  and  cost  estimates  based  on  2008  actual  bid \nprices,  (ii)  advance  procurement  action,  and  (iii)  integration  of \nroad  development  plans  in  rural  electrification  programs.

The design and monitoring framework for the Project is in Appendix 1.   \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis  \n\n1. \n\nSector Overview \n\nBhutan  is  the  only  South  Asian  country  with  a  surplus  of  power  for  export.  Almost \n2. \n100%  of  power  generated  in  the  country  is  hydropower\u2014the  most  productive  natural \nresource in Bhutan. The mountainous terrain and network of perennially flowing rivers and \nstreams  provide  an  abundant  source  of  clean  and  renewable  energy.  Bhutan  has  27 \nhydropower  stations  comprising  4  major  hydroelectric  power  plants,  12  minihydro  plants, \nand  10  microhydro  plants,  with  a  total  installed  capacity  of  about  1,500  megawatts  (MW). \nBecause generation is significantly greater than the 157 MW of domestic demand, Bhutan is \na net power exporter. \n\n3. \nOf  total  power  generated,  80%  is  exported  to  India.  Power  exports  account  for  the \nlargest source of Government revenue in the form of taxes and dividends from hydropower \ncompanies. Given the production of an additional 1,020 MW from the Tala hydropower plant \ncommissioned  in  July  2006,  the  power  sector  accounts  for  more  than  40%  of  national \nrevenue and 25% of gross domestic product (GDP). Hydropower infrastructure development \ncontributes another 25% of GDP through the construction sector.    \n\nReal GDP grew at an annual average of over 7% during the Government\u2019s 9th Five-\n4. \nYear  Plan  (FYP)  (2002\u20132007).  While  hydropower  is  a  key  driver  of  economic  growth,  the \nBhutanese  economy  has  strong  linkages  with  the  Indian  market.  Because  Bhutan\u2019s \ncurrency, the ngultrum, is pegged to the Indian rupee at par, local prices in Bhutan generally \nreflect inflationary movements in India. During the past 5 years, 92% of imports and exports \nwere  from  and  to  India.  Among  all  trading  commodities,  power  export  is  a  major  foreign \nexchange  earner.  During  the  10th  FYP  (2008\u20132013),  the  Government  intends  to  expand \nhydropower  development  for  export.  An  increasing  power  shortage  in  the  South  Asian \nregion represents a significant power-trading opportunity.  \n\n5. \nDespite the net power surplus for export, most rural residents do not have access to \nelectricity.  Only  40%  of  rural  households  use  electricity  as  their  main  source  of  lighting  as \ncompared  to  96.4%  of  urban  households.2 The  Government  aimed  for  100%  electrification \nby 2020 as outlined in Vision 2020, Electricity for All. The Rural Electrification Master Plan \ntargeted  increasing  the  electrification  ratio  from  60%  to  84%  under  the  10th  FYP. 3  It \n                                                          \n1  Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. \n2  National  Statistics  Bureau.  2005.  The  Population  and  Housing  Census  of  Bhutan  2005.  Thimphu.  Rural \n\nhouseholds depend on kerosene (51.3%) for lighting, firewood (2.6%), and solar energy (2.5%).  \n\n3  The Government met the target of 52% during the 9th FYP, achieving an overall electrification ratio of 60%.  \n\n\f2\n\nidentified  all  nonelectrified  villages  and  provided  on-grid  and  off-grid  electrification  plans \nbased on economic cost\u2013benefit analysis.4 Of the 1,716 nonelectrified villages identified, at \nleast 857 will be electrified under 10th FYP. Now the Government has revised the target to \nachieve 100% electrification during the 10th FYP.5\n\n6. \nConsidering that about 70% of the country\u2019s population lives in rural areas, providing \nelectricity  for  all  will  be  a  significant  implementation  challenge.  Further  expansion  of  rural \nelectrification  will  cover  more  remote  areas,  where  operation  and  maintenance  will  be \ncostlier. Experiences with rural electrification indicate that overall electricity consumption will \nincrease  as  rural  households  acquire  new  appliances  and  increase  reliance  on  electricity \nuse,  and  rural  economies  develop.  Even  now,  per  capita  consumption  of  all  energy \n(including  fuelwood)  in  Bhutan  is  the  highest  in  South  Asia. 6  Therefore,  continuous \ngeneration  addition  and  export  will  be  promoted  to  (i)  meet  the  increasing  demand,  (ii) \nreduce fuelwood consumption and conserve the forest environment, and (iii) provide cross-\nsubsidies  to  sustain  costlier  rural  electrification  supply  through  export  revenues.  Energy \nsecurity will involve expanding generation capacity and providing rural access to electricity.  \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Overview \n\n7. \nThe  Electricity  Act,  2001,  deals  with  restructuring  the  power  sector.  In  2002,  the \nGovernment restructured the Department of Power of the Ministry of Trade and Industry into \nthe (i) Department of Energy (DOE) as the Government\u2019s policy and planning agency; and \n(ii)  Bhutan  Power  Corporation  (BPC)  as  the  utility  service  company  responsible  for \ntransmission,  distribution,  and  supply  of  electricity  within  the  country.  DOE  under  the \nrenamed Ministry of Economic Affairs continues to be the nodal agency for all planning and \ncoordination activities for the energy sector. \n\n8. \nThe Government is focusing on second-generation reforms to improve the capacity \nand efficiency of hydropower generation. Bhutan has four major power stations: (i) Chhukha \nHydro Power Corporation (336 MW), (ii) Basochhu Hydro Power Corporation (64 MW), (iii) \nTala Hydroelectric Project Authority (1,020 MW), and (iv) Kurichhu Hydro Power Corporation \n(60  MW).  Three  are  located  in  the  western  region;  the  Kurichhu  power  plant  supplies  the \ncentral  and  eastern  regions.  The  Tala  power  plant,  established  as  a  joint  venture  with  the \nGovernment of India, will be fully owned by the  Government of Bhutan in 2009. The other \nthree companies are wholly Government-owned and were amalgamated to form Druk Green \nPower Corporation (DGPC) in January 2008. To optimize resources and maximize efficiency, \nthe  Government  established  DGPC  as  a  holding  company  to  oversee  its  interests  in \nhydropower companies and projects, and to accelerate new hydropower development.7\n\n9. \nUnder the Electricity Act, Bhutan Electricity Authority (BEA) was set up as the sector \nregulator  in  2002,8 and  since  then  has  been  regularly  revising  the  tariff  structure.  In  2007, \n                                                          \n4  Only the villages with an economic internal rate of return of 12%  were considered viable for grid-based rural \n\nelectrification; the rest will be provided with electricity through off-grid options. \n\n5   The country\u2019s first election resulted in the formation of a new government in April 2008.  \n6  The  energy  sector  encompasses  more  than  the  generation  of  electric  power.  In  Bhutan,  consumption  of \nfuelwood is about 1,200 kg per capita per year, which is the highest consumption worldwide (twice as high as \nin  Nepal).  Fuelwood  accounts  for  about  77%  of  total  energy  consumption.  Recent  evaluations  show  that \nelectrification reduces fuelwood consumption by 25%\u201335%.    \n\n7  ADB.  2003.

In  July  2006,  the  governments  of \n10.\nBhutan  and  India  signed  an  umbrella  agreement  with  a  mutual  obligation  to  develop  and \ntrade  at  least  5,000  MW  of  hydropower  generation  by  2020.  The  two  governments  further \nagreed in principle to increase this target to 10,000 MW by 2020. Hydropower development \nand export have steadfastly underpinned rapid growth of Bhutan\u2019s economy and generated \nvaluable  resources \nthe \ndevelopment of hydropower for export will be of strategic significance to the economy. The \nrevenues from power export will provide a cross-subsidy to maintain low-cost power supply \nto  domestic  customers,  making  the  power  industry  environmentally,  economically,  and \nfinancially sustainable.  \n\ninvestments.  Therefore,  accelerating \n\nfor  social  and  other \n\n11. \nBhutan\u2019s  potential  hydropower  is  26,760  MW,  6%  of  which  is  being  used  to  meet \ndomestic consumption and the reminder is for export. On the other hand, the northern and \nwestern  regions  of  India  are  experiencing  a  large  power  supply  deficit  and  are  shifting \nelectricity  from  the  eastern  and  northeastern  regions  within  the  country.  The  scenario  of  a \npower surplus in Bhutan and supply deficit in India is expected to enhance mutual interest in \ndeveloping  hydropower  projects  in  Bhutan  and  exporting  electricity  to  India.  Clean  energy \ndevelopment  for  power  export  will  improve  energy  efficiency  and  foster  economic \ncooperation in the region.  \n\nBilateral  assistance  has  supported  the  development  of  all  hydropower  projects  in \n12. \nBhutan. The major hydropower export projects at Chhukha (336 MW) and Tala (1,020 MW) \nwere developed through bilateral assistance from the Government of India. In 2007, the two \ngovernments signed an agreement for jointly developing the next project at Punatsangchhu \n(1,095 MW at stage I). A number of large hydropower projects with more than 500 MW are \nplanned for development under the two governments\u2019 partnership.  \n\nPrivate Sector Participation. In addition to bilateral arrangements, the development \n13.\nstrategy  will  require  considering  various  financing  mechanisms  through  public\u2013private \npartnerships  (PPPs)  and/or  independent  power  producers.  Exploitation  of  hydropower \npotential  is  constrained  by  high  up-front  investments  and  large  funding  arrangements. \nBecause  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  capacity  for  big  infrastructure  projects  is  limited,  the \nhydropower  development  strategy  will  leverage  public  and  private  investments  through \nprivate  participation  in  the  development,  in  particular  for  medium  and  small  size  projects. \nSuch an approach is expected to accelerate hydropower development, restrain Government \nexpenditure, and generate income from export revenues.\n\nInclusive  Growth.  Income  from  power  export  will  increase  the  Government\u2019s \n14.\nrevenue  base  and  enable  it  to  allocate  more  resources  for  socioeconomic  development \nincluding  health,  education,  and  rural  electrification.  Additional  resources  could  be  used  to \nimprove  and  expand  road  and  bridge  infrastructure  to  promote  rural  development  and \ntourism,  agribusiness, \nreduce  poverty.  The  enhanced \n\ninfrastructure  will  encourage \n\n\f4\n\ncommunication, and urban development; and thus contribute to inclusive economic growth. \nIt will also encourage private sector operations and create new employment opportunities.   \n\n15. \nSupplying rural areas with access to electricity will improve the living standards of the \nrural  population.  Since  the  Government  estimates  that  more  than  90%  of  the  poor  live  in \nrural  areas,9 the  goal  of  100%  electrification  will  contribute  significantly  to  socioeconomic \ndevelopment  and  poverty  reduction  by  promoting  local  economic  development.  Rural \nelectrification is expected to create opportunities for alternate income-earning avenues and \ndevelopment  of  rural  industries.  It  will  also  improve  access  to  social  services  such  as \neducation and health. Rural electrification thus provides social interventions and benefits.     \n\nFinancial  and  Economic  Sustainability. Rural electrification projects often require \n16.\noperating  subsidy  inputs  to  ensure  sustainability.  Currently  the  subsidies  for  rural \nelectrification are provided through (i) sale of power from generation companies to BPC at a \nrate  that  is  less  than  the  cost  of  production,  and  (ii)  cross-subsidies  from  the  sale  of \nelectricity  to  large  industrial  customers.  Under  the  Tariff  Regulations,  the  regulator,  BEA, \nintends  to  effectively  cap  the  total  subsidy  available  from  the  sale  of  power,  and  require \npayment at the full cost of power sales to India for all local consumption in excess of 15% of \nBhutan\u2019s current hydropower generation capability. This means the subsidy will adequately \ncover low-voltage rural domestic customers below the lifeline tariff, with medium- and high-\nvoltage customers paying the full cost of supply. \n\nthe  national \n\nEnvironmental  Sustainability.  One-fourth  of \n\n17.\nland  comprises \nenvironmentally protected areas, including four national parks, one natural reserve, and four \nwildlife  sanctuaries.  The  country\u2019s  forest,  which  covers  more  than  70%  of  the  land,  is  also \nprotected.  Bhutan\u2019s  strong  environmental  conservation  policies  have  affected  the  pace  of \nimplementing power projects because of the time required to complete procedures such as \nenvironmental  impact  assessments,  public  consultations,  forestry  clearances,  and  road \nplanning.  Nevertheless,  the  priority  concerns  for  the  environment  relate  to  protection  of \nwatersheds, forests, and the ecosystem. All the existing hydropower project sites are run-of-\nriver, with less environmental and social impacts compared to economic benefits. In remote \nand  isolated  rural  areas,  solar  panel  systems  have  been  installed.  In  spite  of  the  efforts, \nwood is still predominately used in rural villages (83% of total consumption), while electricity \nand  gas  are  widely  used  for  cooking  by  90%  of  urban  residents.  Rural  households  in \nnonelectrified  villages  depend  on  kerosene  for  lighting.  Therefore,  access  to  electricity \nsourced  from  hydropower  will  have  significant  positive  environmental  impacts  by  reducing \nfossil fuel use and deforestation due to firewood harvesting. Export of clean power surplus \nwill  lower  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  the  coal-dominated  Indian  power  market.  Global \nwarming is critical to Bhutan since a potential environmental hazard is a glacial lake outburst \nfrom  the  Himalaya  Mountains,  which  will  influence  the  long-term  viability  of  hydropower \nprojects that are on rivers fed by glacial lakes.   \n\n2. \n\nADB Operations and External Assistance \n\nADB  Sector  Strategy.  Power  sector  development  is  a  major  element  of  the  ADB \n18.\ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  Bhutan.10 During  the  past  decade,  ADB  has  supported  the \nGovernment in expanding rural electrification and implementing power sector reforms. The \n\n                                                          \n9   National  Statistical  Bureau.  2007.  The  Poverty  Analysis  Report,  2007.  Thimphu.

Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132010): Bhutan. Manila. \n\n\f5\n\nsecond generation reforms will focus on efficiency improvement of hydropower generation, \nwhile  extending  rural  electrification  to  more  remote  areas  using  hydropower  and  other \nrenewable sources. ADB will support the Government in achieving the sector targets: 100% \nrural  electrification  by  2013,  and  10,000  MW  hydropower  export  by  2020.  These  new \ninitiatives  will  be  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy \n2020).  Strategy  2020  refocuses  ADB  operations  on  three  development  agendas: inclusive \neconomic  growth,  environmentally  sustainable  growth,  and  regional  integration. 11  ADB\u2019s \nCharter,  which  would  sustain  support  for  cross-border  infrastructure  development,  assigns \nhigh priority to regional cooperation. The ADB\u2019s Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility \nand  Carbon  Market  Initiative  are  expected  to  be  used  to  leverage  resources  to  promote \nenergy efficiency, and renewable and clean energy in Bhutan. The assessment of the power \nsector is in Appendix 2. \n\nLessons. ADB has supported Bhutan in expanding rural electrification through three \n19.\nconsecutive  loans  since  1995,  covering  more  than  20,400  households.  The  first  two  loan \nprojects  were  delayed  by  1\u20132  years  because  of  procurement  and  logistic  problems, \ninexperienced  local  contractors,  and  force  majeure  of  heavy  rains.  Nevertheless,  the \ncompleted  projects  are  rated  successful  based  on  a  review  of  relevance,  effectiveness, \nefficacy,  and  sustainability.  The  experience  enabled  BPC  to  complete  the  third  loan \nsatisfactorily  ahead  of  the  original  schedule  without  any  consultancy  implementation \nsupport.  ADB  has  worked  with  the  power  sector,  since  the  early  stages  of  the  sector \ndevelopment, to promote reform, improve operating efficiency, and strengthen the capacity \nof  key  institutions.  Success  is  most  sustainable  when  the  sector  development  program \nmaintains long-term involvement and combines institutional capacity building with scaling-up \ninvestment projects to accelerate development.    \n\nExternal  Assistance.  While  ADB  has  supported  restructuring  of  the  power  sector, \n20.\ninstitutional development, and rural electrification expansion; bilateral development partners \nhave  largely  supported  developing  generation  capacity  through  grants  and  soft  loans.  The \nGovernment  of  India  funded  and  assisted  in  constructing  three  major  power  stations: \nChhukha,  Kurichhu,  and  Tala  for  export  purposes.  The  Government  of  Austria  supported \ndevelopment  of  the  Basochhu  hydropower  plant  for  domestic  supply,  and  conducted  a \nfeasibility study for the proposed Dagachhu hydropower development. The governments of \nJapan and Norway supported feasibility studies for potential hydropower sites and prepared \nthe  Rural  Electrification  Master  Plan  and  Power  System  Master  Plan,  respectively.  The \nAustria, Netherlands, and Japan governments, and ADB have been actively supporting rural \nelectrification. Bhutan still needs to access concessionary sources of external assistance to \nclose the domestic investment gap. The external assistance is summarized in Appendix 3. \n\n3. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\nHydropower  Development  Policy  for  Private  Participation.  To  accelerate \n21.\nhydropower  development  on  a  sustainable  basis,  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  (PPTA) 12 supported  the  Government  in  establishing  a  policy  and  institutional \nframework  for  private  participation,  such  as  PPPs  and  independent  power  producers.  The \nHydropower  Development  Policy  was  issued  in  July  2008  with  provisions  of  (i)  an  energy \n\n                                                          \n11 ADB. 2008.

Manila.  \n\n\f6\n\nroyalty requiring a minimum of 12% of the electricity generated to be free to the Government, \nand (ii) a minimum concession period of 30 years. The key objectives of the policy are to (i) \npromote public, private, and foreign investments to accelerate development of hydropower \ngeneration  in  a  competitive  manner;  (ii)  maximize  benefits from  hydropower  generation  for \nsocioeconomic development of the country; (iii) assure energy security for domestic demand \nand  overall  development  of  the  sector;  (iv)  establish  the  renewable  energy  fund  for  the \nsector  development  and  operational  sustainability;  and  (v)  protect  and  sustain  the \nenvironment. The policy outlines the various elements including the project structure, fiscal \nincentives, and bidding process.  \n\nInstitutional Reforms. In line with the policy initiatives, the Government established \n22.\nits  sovereign  fund,  Druk  Holding  and  Investments  (DHI),  which  groups  the  Government \nshareholdings of its 11 companies to promote new projects and private sector participation. \nIn January 2008, the Government established Druk Green Power Corporation (DGPC) as a \nholding  company \nto  oversee  existing  hydropower  companies  and  stations.  The \namalgamation  of  the  existing  corporations  enabled  DHI  and  DGPC  to  have  larger  assets \nand better financial strength. Both DHI and DGPC are expected to promote new hydropower \nprojects by leveraging and structuring public and private capital through various approaches \nincluding  PPPs.  Another  challenge  is  to  simplify  the  process  of  private  investment  and \nprovide \u201csingle-window\u201d clearances to enhance investor confidence in Bhutan. In July 2008, \nthe Government approved DOE to become the Energy Secretariat as the apex agency for \naccelerating  hydropower  projects  and  ensuring  good  governance  through  an  impartial  and \nbalanced  investment  framework,  and  use  of  competitive  practices  under  the  Hydropower \nDevelopment  Policy.  These  new  roles  will  require  strengthening  of  institutional  capacities \nwithin these organizations. \n\nDemonstration  Projects  for  PPP  and  Clean  Development  Mechanism. The first \n23.\nfew  private  investment  projects  coming  to  Bhutan  will  be  watched  and  scrutinized  by  the \ninvestor community. Therefore, it is critical for Bhutan to demonstrate its ability to attract and \nmanage private investments. A pilot hydropower project structured through PPP will evince \ninterest  and  competition  from  private  developers.  Financial  structuring  on  commercial \nprinciples is expected to achieve more credibility and provide more confidence to potential \nforeign public and private investors and lenders. To increase the comparative advantage of \nBhutan\u2019s  hydropower  sector  in  the  regional  power  trading  market,  some  power  export \nprojects will need to be promoted on commercial principles, unlike past projects where tariffs \nhave  been  politically  negotiated  with  bilateral  assistance. 13 Any  off-take  prices  set  in  a \ncommercial  manner  will  make  significant  impacts  on  subsequent  project  development  and \ninvestment.  Additional  benefits  from  sales  of  carbon  emission  reductions  are  expected  to \nattract  private  capital  once  power  export  substantiates  cross-border  Clean  Development \nMechanism (CDM) opportunities.\n\nRegulatory Systems. The regulator, BEA, is regulating only two government-owned \n24.\npublic  entities:  BPC  and  DGPC.  It  will  be  required  to  take  proactive  initiatives  to  frame \nstandards and codes to regulate the activities of hydropower development and companies, \nincluding  private  players.  Presently,  BEA  is  run  by  a  commission  that  is  functionally  and \nfinancially  autonomous. 14 While  BEA  remains  within  DOE  managerially,  the  Government \nrecognizes  that  the  current  structure  will  no  longer  be  appropriate  if  the  private  sector \n\n                                                          \n13 No  specific  tariff  regulations  are  in  place  for  cross-border  power  trading  between  Bhutan  and  India.  The \n\nexisting three power plants for export have export tariffs ranging from Rs1.8 to Rs2.0. \n\n14 One of commissioners was recently appointed to represent the private sector.\n\n\f7\n\nbecomes  involved  in  hydropower  generation.  The  Government  is  targeting  a  complete \nseparation of BEA from DOE in 2009 to prepare for private sector involvement.15\n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n25. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  sustain  the  country\u2019s  inclusive  economic  growth  in \npromoting cross-border power trade and electricity access. As an outcome, the coverage of \npower distribution will be improved, and the export of power expanded through clean power \ndevelopment  in  a  sustainable  manner.  It  will  generate  a  long-term  revenue  stream  for \nBhutan to finance its enormous development needs for social infrastructure such as health \nand education, as well as economic infrastructure facilities like roads and electricity supplies. \nThey  will  form  the  very  basis  of  rural  development  and  poverty  reduction  in  the  country. \nInvestment for rural electrification will improve access to electricity for rural households and \nsmall  businesses,  and  replace  more  expensive  and  polluting  kerosene  and  fuelwood  with \nrenewable  hydropower  and  solar  energy.  It  will  also  make social  interventions  to  the  poor, \nand  improve  the  standard  of  living  and  quality  of  life  of  rural  residents.  The  Dagachhu \nhydropower  development  will  generate  export  revenues  that  will  be  used  for  subsidies  to \nmaintain low-cost power supplies to rural electrification, while exporting power to India and \nthus enhancing cross-border cooperation and regional energy efficiency. \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  Project  will  provide  separate  financing  for  each  of  two  major  physical \n\n26. \ninvestments: (i) regional clean power trade, and (ii) renewable energy access for the poor. \n\n1. \n\nLoan-Financed Regional Clean Power Trade \n\n27.  \nThe  114  MW  run-of-river  Dagachhu  hydropower  component will  generate  500,000 \nmegawatt  hours  (MWh)  of  power  annually  and  export  to  India  through  the  existing  grid \nconnected to India. BPC will separately build a 19 km, 220-kilovolt (kV) transmission line to \nevacuate  power  generated  from  the  plant  to  the  grid.  The  project  site  will  be  on  the \nDagachhu  river,  a  tributary  stream  of  the  Punatsangchhu  (Sankosh),  which  drains  into  the \nBrahmaputra  river  in  India.  Construction  of  access  roads  to  the  site  (with  Government \nfinancing) is progressing well and expected to be completed by January 2009.       \n\n28.   Clean  and  renewable  power  export  will  be  counted  as  carbon  saving  in  the  coal-\ndominated Indian power market. Under the CDM as defined in the Kyoto Protocol, the clean \npower  generated  from  the  Dagachhu  plant  will  displace  power  generated  by  fossil  fuel-\nbased thermal power generation in the eastern Indian power grid. The resulting reduction of \ngreenhouse  gases  equivalent  to  CO2  emissions  will  be  quantified  as  500,000  tons  every \nyear and 15 million tons over 30 years.         \n\n                                                          \n15 ADB  and  the  Norwegian  Agency  for  Development  Cooperation  (NORAD)  supported  BEA  in  establishing  a \nregulatory  framework.  NORAD  has  committed  to  provide  continuous  technical  support  to  BEA  capacity \nbuilding.  \n\n\f8\n\n2. \n\nGrant-Financed Renewable Energy Access for the Poor \n\n29.  \nThe  rural  electrification  component  will  extend  the  distribution  system  to  provide \nclean  and  reliable  power  supply  to  rural  households  mainly  in  seven  districts  of  Bhutan.16\nThe Rural Electrification Master Plan aims for rural electrification of about 25,000 more rural \nhouseholds during the 10th FYP. In May 2007, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation \nprovided  a  loan  to  support  rural  electrification  of  15,322  households  in  10  districts.  ADB\u2019s \nfinancing  will  be  provided  in  parallel  to  cover  the  balance  of  the  target,  including  more \nremote  central  and  eastern  regions.  Based  on  a  physical  route  survey  for  each  of  seven \nsubprojects,  ADB  will  help  electrify  8,767  consumers  including  households,  facilities,  and \nindustries.\n\nIn  addition  to  grid  extension,  119  solar  photovoltaic  systems  will  be  installed  to \n30.  \nsupport  off-grid  rural  electrification  in  isolated  areas,  focusing  on  schools,  health  clinics, \nmonasteries,  and  other  community  facilities  to  maximize  development  impact.  The  solar \nphotovoltaic  systems  will  apply  emerging  technology  of  (i)  white  light-emitting  diode  for \nlighting,  and  (ii)  capacitors  for  electricity  charging  to  replace  conventional  lamps  and \nbatteries.  Compared  to  conventional  types  of  photovoltaic  systems,  these  products  will  be \nenergy  efficient  and  environment  friendly  with  much  longer  life  and  lower  electricity \nconsumption. Therefore, they are expected to resolve traditional unsustainable solar energy \nproblems such as unfavorable impacts to the environment from battery disposal, high cost of \nfrequent  battery  maintenance  and  replacement,  and  delivery  difficulties  for  heavy  batteries \nto remote areas.\n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features  \n\nPublic\u2013Private  Partnership.  The  Dagachhu  hydropower  development  will  be  the \n31.\nfirst  undertaking  with  a  commercial  nature,  unlike  projects  promoted  under  bilateral \nassistance.  It  was  developed  through  PPPs  to  leverage  private  capital  and  maximize \nimpacts  of  the  government  investment.  In  June  2008,  DGPC  signed  a  shareholders \nagreement  to  form  a  joint  venture  with  equity  participation  from  a  private  company,  Tata \nPower  Company  (TPC),  which  has  sufficient  experience  as  a  private  power  developer  in \nIndia.  Accordingly,  Dagachhu  Hydro  Power  Corporation  (DHPC)  was  incorporated  as  the \nspecial  purpose  company  for  the  development.  The  Government  envisaged  that  the \nDagachhu  development  would  be  a  pilot  case  to  catalyze  private  participation  through  a \nconcessional  agreement  and  accelerate  hydropower  development  in  Bhutan.  Tata  Power \nTrading Company (TPTC) signed a power purchase agreement to supply power generated \nfrom  the  Dagachhu  plant.17 The  experience  gained  by  Bhutan  in  terms  of  negotiating  with \noff-takers  for  commercial  tariffs  and  developing  shareholders  agreements  with  a  strategic \npartnership  with  the  private  sector  will  be  of  significant  importance  to  implementing  more \nthe  Hydropower  Development  Policy.  The  Dagachhu \nhydropower  projects  under \ndevelopment  is  expected  to  catalyze  and  expand  investment  for  clean  energy  projects  in \nBhutan.\n\n                                                          \n16 Target  districts \n\ninclude  Pemagatshel,  Punakha,  Samdrup  Jongkhar,  Sarpang,  Trashigang,  and \nWangduephodrang. Due to the recent changes of district boundary, part of Dagana and Mongar  will also be \nincluded.  \n\n17 The power generated from the Dagachhu plant is expected to be supplied to North Delhi Power through the \ntransmission  line  owned  by  Powerlinks  Transmission,  a  private  joint  venture  with  TPC  and  Power  Grid \nCorporation of India. \n\n\f9\n\nRegional  Cooperation.  Presently,  cross-border  power  trading  is  limited  in  South \n32.\nAsia, where most power exchange is available only between Bhutan and India.18 During the \npast decades, all cross-border power trading projects in South Asia have been supported by \nthe  Government  of  India.  The  Dagachhu  hydropower  development  will  be  the  first  to  be \nmainly  promoted  by  the  Government  of  Bhutan  and  assisted  by  banks  and  financial \ninstitutions. Since the cross-border power trading market and participants have been limited, \nTPTC\u2019s private sector participation in the market will create a competitive business climate \nin  regional  power  trading  in  South  Asia.19 The  PPP  modality  will  enhance  the  investment \nenvironment for developing clean hydropower potential in the region through private capital. \n\nClean  Development  Mechanism.  The Dagachhu hydropower development posted \n33.\nits application to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change website for \npublic  comments  in  2007.  A  validation  report  is  being  prepared  and  DHPC  will  seek \nregistration with the CDM Board. The Indian electricity grid based on mainly coal-fired power \nplants has been treated as the baseline against which greenhouse gas emission reductions \nof the Dagachhu hydropower development  are measured.  Thus, the Government  expects \nthe  Dagachhu  hydropower  development  to  be a  showcase  cross-border  CDM  project.  The \ngovernments of Bhutan and India have already approved it as a CDM project. Since TPTC \nhas in principle agreed to underwrite the purchase of the emission reductions over 30 years \nat  a  specific  minimum  price,  irrespective  of  whether  a  post  2012  agreement  is  reached,20\nDHPC  expects  to  have  an  assured  revenue  from  carbon  emission  reductions  over  the \nduration of its operations.  \n\nEnergy  Efficient  Design  and  Technology.  The  Project  focuses  on  energy \n34.\nefficiency  and  environment-friendly  technology.  The  generation  system  for  the  Dagachhu \nplant will use pelton turbines, which can be operated in an environment-friendly manner with \nsmall  discharges  of  river  water.  The  rural  electrification  will  apply  the  single-phase  system \nwhere  the  cost  is  lower,  electricity  supply  is  more  efficient,  and  the  delivery  is  easier \nbecause  of  its  smaller  transformer  size.21 The  off-grid  rural  electrification  component  will \napply for emerging technology of white light-emitting diode and capacitors considered to be \nmore  environment-friendly  and  sustainable. 22  The  technology  transfer  will  need  to  be \ndemonstrated  in  terms  of  design,  procurement,  and  performance  before  replicating  and \nimplementing further applications. \n\nD. \n\nADF IX Grant, Hard-term ADF, and Ordinary Capital Resources  \n\nADF  IX  Grant  Financing.  In  2007,  ADB  decided  to  align  with  the  International \n35.\nDevelopment Association 14 framework, to define eligibility for grants to Asian Development \nFund (ADF)-only countries. Under the revised ADF grants framework, Bhutan is classified as \neligible for 100% grants until the ADF IX replenishment period ends in 2008. ADF grants aim \nto  provide  development  assistance  to  help  a  country  tackle  development  issues  in  an \n                                                          \n18 The power exchange between India and Nepal is presently only at 50 MW. Since Nepal has an acute power \n\nshortage, excess power from Nepal has been limited.   \n\n19 The best off-take price of TPTC was selected on a competitive basis. \n20 DHPC and TPTC signed a term sheet in August 2008. \n21 Most  rural  electrification  in  Bhutan  was  designed  with  a  costly  three-phase  system.  This  would  make  the \nmaterial head loading transportation more difficult and its associate costs higher since the target project sites \nextended for rural electrification were remote with difficult terrain away from the existing grid system. \n\n22 The lifetime of a white light-emitting diode is more than 20 years compared to 1 year for conventional compact \nfluorescent  lamps;  capacitors  have  guarantees  at  least  for  10  years  (no  lifetime  theoretically),  while \nconventional  chemical  batteries  have  a  short  lifetime  (usually  3  years)  and  regular  replacement  and \nmaintenance is required at the expense of consumers. \n\n\f10\n\nenvironment of debt vulnerability, and assist the country in developing the private sector and \nachieving  sustainable  economic  development.23 The  ADF  grant  is  allocated  for  the  rural \nelectrification component.  \n\nHard-Term  ADF  and  Ordinary  Capital  Resources  Financing.  While  ADF  grant-\n36.\neligible  countries  will  generally  be  restricted  from  public  or  public-guaranteed  ordinary \ncapital  resources  (OCR)  borrowing  until  their  debt  indicators  improve,  an  exception  to  this \nrestriction is given in individual cases for high-revenue-earning projects that generate more \nnet foreign exchange than the foreign debt service requirement. This is consistent with the \napproach of the ADB graduation policy for OCR borrowing by ADF countries. In accordance \nwith  the graduation  policy  and  the  revised  ADF  grant  framework,  nonconcessional  term \nlending  (i.e.,  OCR),  hard-term  ADF  lending,  and/or  guarantees  can  be  considered  on  an \nexceptional basis for Bhutan for the Dagachhu hydropower development as it will be earning \nforeign  exchange  and  will  be  able  to  fully  service  foreign  debt  from  net  foreign  exchange \nearnings (para. 61).24\n\nDebt  Sustainability.  Bhutan\u2019s  public  debt  to  GDP  ratio  peaked  in  2006  mainly \n37.\nbecause  of  borrowings  for  the  Tala  hydropower  plant  and  the  purchase  of  aircraft  for  the \nstate-owned Druk Air. It declined in 2007 and will continue to drop if no new large projects \nare  accommodated.  Even  with  new  projects,  such  as \nthe  Dagachhu  hydropower \ndevelopment,  the  ratio  will  rise  again  until  2011  in  the  short  term;  it  is  expected  to  drop \ncontinuously afterward. The PPTA conducted Bhutan\u2019s debt sustainability analysis based on \nthe  debt  sustainability  framework  for  low-income  countries  as  defined  by  the  International \nMonetary  Fund  (IMF)  and  the  International  Development  Association  (Appendix  4). \nConsequently,  the  cumulative  effects  arising  from  the  new  development\u2019s  benefits  after \n2011 will result in a considerable reduction of debt burden with a higher pace. This indicates \nthat  the  Government\u2019s  debt  burden  arising  from  new  projects  including  the  Dagachhu \nhydropower development will be more than offset by the reduction in debt burden indicators \nresulting  from  increases  in  exports,  GDP,  and  fiscal  revenues.  The  Dagachhu  hydropower \ndevelopment will thus help ensure the country\u2019s debt position is sustainable. The IMF\u2019s 2007 \nArticle  IV  Consultation  on  Bhutan  clarifies  that  Bhutan\u2019s  experience  in  implementing  and \noperating  hydropower  projects  is  one  of  the  biggest  mitigation  factors  in  substantially \nimproving  the  debt  dynamics.  Consequently,  IMF  suggests  that  Bhutan's  risk  of  external \ndebt  distress  be  upgraded,  reflecting  the  authorities'  good  record  of  implementation  of \nexternally  financed  hydroelectric  projects,  high  overall  foreign  exchange  reserves,  and \nstrong external development partner support for power sector projects.25\n\nE. \n\nProject Investment Plan  \n\n38. \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $234.45  million  including  all  relevant \ncosts (Table 1 and Appendix 5). The Dagachhu hydropower component is estimated to cost \n$201.47  million  including  contingencies  and  financing  charges.  The  rural  electrification \ncomponent is estimated to cost $32.98 million, including contingencies, which comprise the \non-grid component of $31.92 million, and the off-grid component of $1.06 million.  \n\n                                                          \n23 ADB. 2007. Revising the Framework for Asian Development Fund Grants. Manila. \n24 ADB Operations Manual, Section A1/BP, para.10 and A3/BP, para.19. \n25 The IMF Article IV Consultation was issued in October 2007 and concludes that Bhutan\u2019s risk of external debt \ndistress is upgraded to \u201cmoderate.\u201d ADB follows the debt-distress classification of the International Monetary \nFund and International Development Association, which has a cutoff date of 31 December 2006, to determine \nfuture  grant  eligibility.  This  is  in  accordance  with  the  Revised  ADF  Grant  Framework  under  which  Bhutan  is \ncategorized as \u201chigh\u201d risk (i.e., 100% grant eligibility) based on the 2005 country assessment.\n\n\fTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem\nA.

The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $51,000,000 \n40.\nfrom ADB\u2019s OCR to help finance the Dagachhu hydropower component. The OCR loan will \nhave  a  30-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility, \ncommitment charges of 0.15% per annum during the disbursement period, and such other \nterms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The  Government \nhas provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these \nchoices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication \nor advice from ADB. \n\n41. \nThe  Government  also  requested  a  loan  of  $29,000,000  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources. The hard-term ADF loan will have an interest charge at the rate of \n3.15% per annum; a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nand project agreements. 26\n\n42. \nThe  Dagachhu  hydropower  component  will  cost  $201.46  million  including  debt  of \n$121.5  million  (60%)  and  equity  of  $80.0  million  (40%).  ADB  will  finance  $80  million  as \nanchor money to take a lead in the financial structuring. The Kingdom of Bhutan will be the \nborrower of ADB loans from OCR and hard-term ADF. Of the $80 million, ADB will provide \n(i)  $51  million  (OCR)  to  DHPC  as  the  debt  portion  of  the  Dagachhu  development,  and  (ii) \n$29  million  (hard-term  ADF)  to  DGPC  as  the  equity  portion  through  lending  to  the \nGovernment.  For  the  total  equity  requirement  of  $80  million,  Bhutan\u2019s  public  sector, \nincluding  the  Government,  DGPC,  and  National  Pension  and  Provident  Fund  (NPPF),  will \ncontribute $59 million (including the $29 million from the hard-term ADF loan); Tata Power \nCompany  will  participate  as  a  minority  shareholder  with  equity  of  $21  million.  The  debt \nbalance  is  expected  to  be  cofinanced  by  the  Austrian  export  credit  agency,  OeKB  ($55.5 \nmillion) and NPPF ($15 million). The detailed financial structure and fund flow proposed is \nprovided in Appendix 6. \n\nThe Government will relend the ADB loans to DGPC and DHPC through subsidiary \n43. \nloan agreements with the same terms and conditions as the ADB loans. Foreign exchange \nrisks  will  be  assumed  by  the  corresponding  entities.  The  Government\u2019s  equity  will  be \nprovided to DGPC, which will become the  majority shareholder (59% of the total share) of \nDHPC.  The  balance  of  DHPC\u2019s  shares  will  be  held  by  minority  shareholders:  TPC  (26%) \nand  NPPF  (15%).  An  Indian  commercial  bank  is  expected  to  help  hedge  the  foreign \ncurrency  loan(s)  through  currency  swap  arrangements  or  any  alternative  proposals  to \nminimize  the  currency  mismatching  risk  between  the  project\u2019s  revenue  and  debt.  The \ncurrency risk analysis is provided in Supplementary Appendix J.\n\n                                                          \n26 The hard-term ADF loan is more concessional than OCR. The blended use of the hard-term ADF is based on \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  guidance  that  low-income  countries  (as  defined  by  the  fund)  should  exhaust  all \navenues  of  access  to  concessional  resources  before  considering  nonconcessional  borrowing,  and  that \nborrowing on nonconcessional terms may be justified with high expected rates of return.  \n\n\f13\n\nRural  Electrification.  ADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $25,280,000  equivalent  to  help \n44.\nfinance the on-grid component of the rural electrification. The financing will be provided from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The Government will finance the local currency component \nfor  civil  works  by  providing  $6,640,000  equivalent.  The  Government  will  relend  the  grant \nproceeds  to  BPC  with  no  interest  charge.  For  the  off-grid  component,  the  Asian  Clean \nEnergy  Fund,  administered  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility,  is \nexpected to provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $1,000,000, subject to approval by the \nGovernment of Japan.27\n\nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nDagachhu  Hydropower.  DGPC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  have  overall \n45.\nresponsibility for the component. DHPC will be the Implementing Agency with responsibility \nfor day-to-day coordination, implementation, and administration. DHPC is a special purpose \ncompany  that  has  the  capacity  to  undertake  all  activities  required  for  successful \nimplementation, including (i) procurement of goods and works; (ii) construction supervision; \n(iii)  maintenance  of  separate  project  accounts;  (iv)  monitoring  and  reporting  of  project \nimplementation; and (v) provision of supervision, coordination, support, and liaison activities \nas required.  \n\nRural  Electrification.

BPC  will  be  the \n46.\nImplementing  Agency  for  grid-extended  rural  electrification  and  DOE\u2019s  Renewable  Energy \nDivision  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  off-grid  electrification.  BPC  has  executed  the \npast  three  ADB-financed  rural  electrification  projects  and  demonstrated  good  performance \nfor  project  management.  BPC  has  established  a  project  implementation  unit  and  assigned \nthe project manager and staff. Under BPC\u2019s supervision, local private contractors will carry \nout the majority of construction works.28 The project implementation unit will coordinate with \ncontractors,  district  offices,  and  relevant  government  departments,  in  particular  the \nDepartment of Roads.  \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period  \n\n47. \nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years to 31 December 2013. The Dagachhu \nhydropower component has already started developing site infrastructure for access roads, \nwater,  and  electricity  facilities.  Construction  for  the  rural  electrification  component  will  be \ncompleted  in  a  phased  manner  for  each  of  seven  subprojects.  The  implementation  and \nproject readiness schedules are in Appendix 7. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n48.  \nThe  Dagachhu  hydropower  component  has  two  contract  packages  through  the \nengineering,  procurement,  and  construction  (EPC)  scheme:  one  for  civil  works  to  be \nfinanced by ADB and one for electromechanical works to be financed by the Austrian Export \nCredit  Agency,  OeKB.  The  civil  works  will  be  procured  by  using  international  competitive \n                                                          \n27 Asian Clean Energy Fund (ACEF) was established by the Government of Japan. If the Government of Japan \ndoes not approve the financing from ACEF, either (i) alternative financing  will be obtained, or (ii) the off-grid \ncomponent will not form part of the Project. \n\n28 This approach of outsourcing construction work to local private contractors is based on experience gained \n\nduring ADB\u2019s previous rural electrification projects, which proved very successful. \n\n\f14\n\nbidding procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time),  and  the  electromechanical  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \nOeKB requirements.29 For the rural electrification component, the ADB grant will mainly be \nused for the hard costs of material procurement using international competitive bidding. All \nconstruction  works  and  material  transportation  are  to  be  outsourced  through  national \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. 30  DHPC  and  BPC  will  include \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  and  costs  identified  in  environmental  assessments \napproved  for  each  component  in  civil  work  contracts  to  comply  with  Bhutanese  and  ADB \nenvironment requirements. The procurement plan is in Appendix 8. \n\n4. \n\nAdvanced Contracting \n\nTo expedite implementation, the Government, DHPC, DGPC, and BPC asked ADB \n49. \nto  approve  advance  actions  for  procurement  of  works,  goods,  and  services.  ADB  granted \napproval of advanced contracting on 1 July 2008. DHPC floated a tender for civil works on \n15 July 2008, and electromechanical works on 1 August 2008. BPC will begin this process \nwithin 2008.  \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n50.   ADB assessed BPC\u2019s capacity to implement the rural electrification component and \ndetermined  that  consulting  services  are  not  required.  Off-grid  rural  electrification  packages \nwill  include  small-scale  consultant  services  to  support  DOE  in  implementing  procurement \nand installing solar panels. Consultants for this component will be selected and engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time) and individual experts will be recruited based on biodata submitted in specific terms \nof reference for assignments. To support the Dagachhu hydropower component in preparing \nbidding documents and conducting bidding, bid  evaluation, and negotiations for civil works \nand electromechanical contracts, the Austrian Government also provided DHPC with TA for \nconsulting services. The Austrian Government has committed to provide subsequent TA to \nsupport construction and supervision work during construction. \n\n6. \n\nStakeholder Participation and Consultation \n\n51.   All relevant stakeholders, including affected communities and affected people, were \nfully  consulted  during  project  preparation. 31  Development  of  the  Dagachhu  hydropower \ncomponent considered affected peoples\u2019 concerns and preferences during finalization of the \ndesign,  particularly  the  alignment  of  access  roads  to  minimize  negative  impacts,  while \nmaximizing benefits. They were consulted to define appropriate compensation rates and  a \ncourse of actions including scheduling, and were requested to select cash compensation or \nthe  alternative  land  to  be  awarded  as  replacement  for  the  land  acquired  by  the  Dagachhu \nfacility. Public consultation with all stakeholders will continue throughout implementation of \nthe Dagachhu hydropower component. \n\n                                                          \n29 To  coordinate  these  two  procurement  processes,  the  bidding  documents  for  both  packages  were  prepared \nbased  on  ADB\u2019s  Standard  Bidding  Documents  for  Plant  and  FIDIC  Conditions  of  Contract  for  EPC/Turnkey \nProjects.\n\n30 The  national  competitive  bidding  procedure  is  applied  as  (i)  the  contract  values  are  small,  (ii)  works  are \n\nscattered across the country, and (iii) works are labor intensive. \n\n31 The consultation included the awareness and prevention campaign for HIV/AIDS during construction in spite of \n\na small infection rate in Bhutan. \n\n\f15\n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nDisbursement  procedures  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \n52. \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time), and detailed arrangements agreed upon \nby  the  Government  and  ADB.  Since  the  disbursements  under  the  Dagachhu  hydropower \ncomponent  will  mainly  be  for  procurement  of  works,  goods,  and  services,  ADB\u2019s \ncommitment  letter,  reimbursement,  and  direct  payment  procedures  will  be  utilized.32 The \nhard-term  ADF  loan  will  be  disbursed  through  the  Government  to  DGPC  for  its  equity \ncontribution.  The  rural  electrification  component  will  also  use  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedures  to  liquidate  advances  for  each  payment  not  exceeding  $100,000.  Under  these \nprocedures,  ADB  will  advance  6  months  of  estimated  expenditures,  or  10%  of  the  grant \namount,  whichever  is  lower,  to  the  imprest  account,  and  the  Government  will  use  the \naccount to pay eligible expenditures.  \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe accounting, auditing, and reporting systems and procedures for the project loans \n53. \nand  grants  will  be  established  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  and  practices \nsatisfactory  to  ADB.  The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  will  maintain  separate \naccounts  for  the  components.  Within  6  months  of  the  close  of  the  financial  year,  they  will \nsubmit  to  ADB  (i)  annual  project  accounts,  with  detailed  descriptions  of  the  sources  of \nreceipts  and  expenditures;  and  (ii)  annual  financial  statements  comprising  an  income \nstatement,  balance  sheet,  statement  of  cash  flow,  and  related  notes  to  the  financial \nstatements and consolidated for all operations. Independent auditors acceptable to ADB will \n(i)  audit  the  project  accounts  and  financial statements,  (ii) provide  an  opinion  on  the  ADB-\nfinanced  imprest  fund  and  statement  of  expenditures,  and  (iii)  confirm  compliance  with \nADB\u2019s financial covenants, in conformity with the definitions contained in the loan, grant, and \nproject agreements. \n\n9. \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Governance \n\nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \n54. \ndiscussed with the Government, DGPC, DHPC, and BPC. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices \nrelating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  the  Anticorruption \nPolicy  are  included  in  the  loan  and  grant  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the \nProject.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  loan  and  grant \nprojects  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the \nrecords  and  accounts  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and  all  contractors, \nsuppliers, and other service providers as they relate to Project.  \n\n55. \nDHPC  will  operate  within  a  corporate  and  power  sector  governance  framework. \nThrough the PPP structure of the Dagachhu hydropower component, DHPC has public and \nprivate  shareholder  representatives  on  its  board  of  directors.  The  shareholders  agreement \ndefines  board  composition,  transparent  financial  reporting  and  auditing,  professional \nmanagement  of  the  company  at  an  arms-length  basis  from  shareholders,  and  full \ntransparency  of  day-to-day  administration.  The  Government  ensures  that  the  corporate \ngovernance procedures in the Companies Act of the Kingdom of Bhutan will supplement the \n                                                          \n32 The Dagachhu hydropower component will not require an imprest fund.  \n\n\f16\n\ngovernance  arrangements  for  any  potential  conflicts  of  interest  among  the  board  of \ndirectors.

Each report will provide (i) a narrative description of progress made \nduring  the  period,  (ii)  changes  in  the  implementation  schedule,  (iii)  problems  or  difficulties \nencountered, (iv) work to be carried out in the next period, and (v) progress on social and \nenvironmental compliance. The progress report will include a summary financial account for \nthe  project  loan  and  grant  components,  consisting  of  project  expenditures  for  the  year  to \ndate  and  total  expenditure  to  date,  and  a  contract  financing  plan.  In  particular,  DHPC  and \nBPC  will  submit  a  consolidated  report  that  integrates  the  Dagachhu  development  with  its \nassociated transmission component financed by BPC. Performance will be evaluated based \non  indicators  and  targets  stipulated  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework.  BPC  will \nidentify  and  maintain  profiles  of  new  customers  connected  by  the  rural  electrification \ncomponent  as  baseline  data  for  the  postproject  analysis.  DHPC  will  monitor  the  baseline \ninformation as per the resettlement plan (para. 69) and the environmental management plan \n(EMP) (paras. 74 and 75).  \n\n57. \nADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of project approval to prepare the \nproject  administration  memorandum.  ADB  will  review  the  implementation  and  operation  of \nthe  investment  project  based  on  the  quarterly  progress  reports  and  meet  with  the \nGovernment, and executing and implementing agencies semiannually to discuss progress of \nindividual  subprojects  and  any  changes  to  implementation  arrangements  or  remedial \nmeasures  required  to  achieve  the  project  objectives.  A  midterm  review  will  be  carried  out \n\n\f17\n\nduring  the  third  year  of  project  implementation,  and  a  project  completion  report  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB within 3 months following completion of the individual component.   \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n58. \nA capacity development technical assistance (CDTA) will be attached to the Project. \nThe  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Fund33 will  provide  a  grant  of  $888,000  and  the \nADB  TA  funding  program  will  provide  $600,000,  for  a  total  of  $1,488,000.  The  CDTA  for \nPromotion  of  Clean  Power  Export  Development  aims  to  (i)  develop  capacity  (e.g.,  risk \nmanagement and project structuring function, and private participation promotion) for DOE, \nDGPC,  and  DHI;  (ii)  provide  a  financial  structuring  study  for  medium-size  power  export \nprojects,34 and (iii) prepare project design document(s) for accessing CDM funding sources. \nThe  CDTA  will  also  support  DOE  in  promoting  investment  solicitation,  due  diligence,  and \nfinancing  plans  for  the  demonstration  projects.  The  Government  asked  ADB  for  advance \ncontracting  to  facilitate  CDTA  implementation.  The  proposed  CDTA  scope  is  presented  in \nAppendix 9.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nFinancial Justification \n\nFinancial  Viability  and  Sustainability.  The  financial  analysis  for  each  of  the  two \n59.\nproject  components:  Dagachhu  hydropower  and  rural  electrification  was  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects (2005). All financial \ncosts and benefits are expressed in constant 2008 prices. To determine the financial internal \nrate  of  return  (FIRR),  cost  streams  such  as  capital  investment,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance reflect costs of delivering the estimated benefits. Revenue streams are based \non the tariff for sale of energy generated by each of the components. The weighted average \ncost of capital was calculated and compared with the project FIRRs to ascertain the financial \nviability of each project component. The sensitivity of the FIRR to adverse movements in the \nunderlying assumptions was also assessed.  \n\nThe FIRR after taxes is 10.44% for the Dagachhu hydropower component. The FIRR \n60. \ncompares favorably with the estimated value of weighted average cost of capital at 5.63%, \nsubstantiating \nthe  rural  electrification \ncomponent  will  not  be  financially  viable  without  any  capital  or  operating  subsidies.  A \nsummary of the project financial analysis is presented in Appendix 10. \n\nfinancial  viability.  However, \n\nthe  component\u2019s \n\n61. \nDHPC\u2019s  debt  to  equity  ratio  is  60  to  40.  Its  projected  financial  performance  is \nexpected to maintain adequate debt service coverage ratios, with the minimum of 1.5 times \nand average of 2.2 times. This clearly indicates that the Dagachhu hydropower development \nwill generate cash surplus to fully service debt obligations. The profitability is represented by \nan internal rate of return on equity of 15.6% on a before-tax basis and 12.0% on an after-tax \nbasis.35 These  results  demonstrate  that  the  Dagachhu  development  is  bankable.  DHPC  is \nexpected to contribute to Government revenue through taxes, dividends, and royalties. The \nmajor  sponsor  of  DHPC  is  DGPC,  which  also  contributes  to  the  financial  robustness.  The \n                                                          \n33 Established under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility. \n34 The sample projects will include the Nikachhu (210 MW) and Khomachhu hydropower (326 MW) projects. \n35 The return was calculated after deducting the royalty revenue to the Government. The provision for the energy \nroyalty is that a minimum of 12% of the electricity generated for the first 12 years and 18% for the balance of \n18 years will be made available at no charge to the Government. \n\n\f18\n\nopening financial position for DGPC as of 1 January 2008 is based on the accounts of three \nsubsidiary hydropower companies including Chhukha Hydro Power Corporation, Basochhu \nHydro  Power  Corporation,  and  Kurichhu  Hydro  Power  Corporation.  DGPC\u2019s  profitability  is \nvery  high,  with  29%  return  of  net  fixed  assets  primarily  due  to  Chhukha  Hydro  Power \nCorporation, which is a debt-free hydropower company. Overall DGPC\u2019s return of net fixed \nassets  is  likely  to  increase  and  contribute  to  Bhutan\u2019s  economy  as  it  merges  Tala \nHydroelectric Project Authority36 and promotes more hydropower development projects.  \n\nBPC  substantially  improved  its  profitability  in  2006  through  a  combination  of  tariff \n62. \nincreases  and  improved  operating  efficiency  after  making  losses  since  2002.  Tariff \nincreases were implemented in a timely manner and BPC introduced a performance-based \nincentive  scheme  for  all  operations  staff  in  2006. 37  These  initiatives  enabled  BPC  to \ngenerate  net  profits  and  resulted  in  a  4.9%  return  on  net  fixed  assets  as  of  31  December \n2007. The transmission wheeling revenues from the Tala plant will enable it to improve its \nprofitability.  BPC\u2019s  debt  service  coverage  and  self-financing  ratios  have  been  maintained \nwell above the previous loan covenant\u2019s targets of 1.5 times and 20%, respectively. It has \nalso  maintained  its  overall  system  loss  at  9%\u201310%.  However,  BPC\u2019s  future  financial \nperformance  will  be  influenced  by  the  very  high  proportion  of  rural  electrification  within  its \nnetwork and the need to work within tariff policies that incorporate high cross-subsidization. \nThe financial performance and management is summarized in Appendix 11. \n\nFinancial  Management.  Financial  management  assessment  was  undertaken  to \n63.\ndetermine  the  current  ability  of  DHPC,  DGPC,  and  BPC  to  fulfill  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary \nrequirements; and identify areas for improvement. The assessment was in accordance with \nADB  guidelines  using  the  financial  management  assessment  questionnaire  and  field \ninterviews.\n\n64. \nDHPC  was  formed  as  an  authority  in  April  2007  and  incorporated  in  May  2008.  As \nthe project company is in its inception stage, its financial accounting is relatively simple, and \nis  used  by  one  of  the  other  hydropower  companies  under  DGPC.  DHPC  presently  uses \nspreadsheet-based  software  for  accounting  purposes.  The  PPTA  supported  DGPC\u2019s \nintegration of  the  accounting  system  among  its  subsidiaries  and  DGPC  plans  to  install  the \naccounting  software  in  its  own  offices  and  each  of  its  subsidiaries  to  record  financial \ntransactions  in  a  common  format.  Then,  DHPC  is  expected  to  strengthen  its  accounting \nmanagement and move from manual accounting procedures to an integrated computerized \nfinancial  management  and  accounting  system.  The  joint  venture  project  sponsors,  DGPC \nand TPC, agreed to have the seconded or professional financial staff from TPC assist DHPC \nin  conducting  its  financial  management.  DHPC  and  DGPC  have  no  prior  experience  with \nmanaging  foreign  currency  debt  and  will  require  capacity  building  for  foreign  exchange \nmitigation, fund raising, and concomitant risk management. This will be supported by a new \nCDTA (para. 58).  \n\n                                                          \n36 The  Tala  Hydroelectric  Project  Authority  will  become  a  corporation  after  finalizing  its  2008  accounts,  and  be \n\namalgamated into DGPC at a later date. \n\n37 The performance-based incentive scheme gave all staff an opportunity to earn a bonus of up to 25% of their \nbasic  annual  salary,  depending  on  the  extent  to  which  the  corporation  and  its  component  department  and \ndivisions  met  objectively  measurable  performance  targets.  This  scheme  has  resulted  in  a  significant \nimprovement in BPC\u2019s operating efficiency. \n\n\f19\n\nBPC has 53 accounting units within 29 branch offices; all the units are computerized. \n65. \nBPC developed procedures and guidelines for this reporting under ADB TA.38 BPC has well-\ndefined  charts  of  accounts  for  recording  financial  transactions.  It  now  plans  to  raise \ncommercial  financing  from  local  banks  to  construct  a  transmission  line  to  evacuate  power \ngenerated  from  DHPC.  In  the  future,  it  may  need  to  raise  commercial  financing  outside \nBhutan  for  some  of  its  investment  requirements.  Then,  BPC  will  need  to  develop  capacity \nbuilding for raising and managing external funds.  \n\nB. \n\nEconomic Justification \n\n66. \nEconomic  analysis  for  each  of  the  two  project  components  was  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. A summary of the \nproject economic analysis is presented in Appendix 12. \n\n67. \nThe economic analysis shows that the Dagachhu hydropower component, inclusive \nof the transmission link, has an estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 13.8%, \nwhich is above the ADB traditional threshold. In addition to the normal revenue stream from \nexport  of  generated  power  to  India,  the  Dagachhu  hydropower  component  is  expected  to \ngenerate  additional  revenue  from  emission  reductions  under  CDM.  In  addition  it  supplies \npower  to  address  India\u2019s  energy  deficit,  in  particular  to  its  northern  region.  Therefore,  the \noverall benefits to the Bhutan\u2013India subregion will be significantly higher than the estimated \nEIRR,  considering  that  it  will  eventually  supply  unserved  demand  in  the  subregion.  As  a \nresult, the EIRR for the subregion is estimated to be 22.0%.  \n\nThe  economic  benefits  and  costs  were  quantified  with  and  without  the  rural \n68. \nelectrification  component.  Each  of  the  component\u2019s  subprojects  exhibits  EIRR  values \nranging from 13% to 26%. The overall component is estimated to have an EIRR of 20%.  \n\nC. \n\nSocial and Poverty Assessment \n\nSocial  Aspects.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  and  the \n69.\nsummary  resettlement  plan  are  in  Appendix  13  and  Appendix  14  respectively.  No \nindigenous peoples will be affected. No resettlement of houses is required for either of the \ntwo project components. The land acquisition for the Dagachhu hydropower component will \nbe mainly necessary due to the construction of access roads, not covered by ADB financing. \nA  total  of  25  households  will  be  affected  by  losing  part  of  their  land.  Each  of  the  affected \nhouseholds and communities was given the opportunity to choose between cash or land-for-\nland compensation. Through the public consultation, they have selected alternative plots of \nland. In addition to the land plots, DHPC is providing compensation for affected crops. Due \nto the lack of recent market rates for trees and crops, DHPC agreed to top-up the amounts \nalready  compensated  with  additional  funds  at  the  end  of  the  cropping  season.  Affected \npeople  agreed  to  this  two-stage  compensation  approach  that  will  ensure  compensation  at \nmarket value for crops and trees. To guide the land acquisition and compensation, a short \nresettlement plan was disclosed to all those affected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary\nResettlement Policy (1995) and the relevant laws and policies of the Government.  \n\n70. \nNo  negative  social  impacts  are  anticipated  during  implementation  of  the  rural \nelectrification component. No land acquisition will be required and no damage to crops and \n\n                                                          \n38 ADB.  2004.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for  Capacity  Building  of  Bhutan  Power \n\nCorporation. Manila.  \n\n\f20\n\nprivate  trees  is  expected  as  distribution  lines  and  poles  can  be  designed  and  aligned  to \navoid  any  disruptions.  No  resettlement  plan  is  therefore  included,  although  an  in-depth \nsurvey was carried out under the PPTA to assess poverty impacts. Access to electricity will \nmake  positive  social  impacts  on  health,  in  particular  for  women  who  are  more  active  at \nhousework such as cooking. \n\nPoverty  Aspects.  The  poverty  impact  analysis  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  G. \n71.\nRural  electrification  schemes  have  proved  beneficial  for  poverty  reduction  and  income \ngeneration. As rural areas usually fall behind in access to both social services and income \nopportunities,  the  grid  expansion  along  with  development  of  other  infrastructure  such  as \nroads and public utilities will boost the local economy and provide additional health-related \nbenefits. Access to electricity is also expected to improve education by allowing children to \ndevote  longer  hours  to  studying,  and  schools  to  avail  of  additional  facilities  such  as \ncomputers.  Income  generation  activities  and  increased  productivity  are  among  the  major \npositive impacts of rural electrification schemes. Income security through its diversification is \nalso a fundamental benefit, as it reduces vulnerability. According to the results from the in-\ndepth survey of project beneficiaries, affordability is not expected to be an issue since their \nreal capacity to pay is greater than the expected demand measured by their willingness to \npay.  As  a  result,  the  poverty  impact  ratio  of  the  rural  electrification  subproject  is  an \noutstanding 62%. \n\n72. \nThe Dagachhu hydropower component will have direct and indirect positive impacts \non  poverty.  The  local  economy  has  already  started  developing  as  some  of  the  civil  works \nhave been implemented. The development of access roads to the project site will improve \naccessibility  of  local  communities  to  main  roads.  This  is  expected  to  stimulate  the  local \neconomy, while improving quality of life. The Dagachhu development will indirectly support \nrural  domestic  customers,  in  particular  under  a  lifeline  tariff.  The  tariff  policy  requires  the \nGovernment  to  subsidize  electricity  for  lifeline  consumers,  using  12%\u201318%  of  the  royalty \nrevenue yielded from power export from the Dagachhu plant. Because alternative sources of \nenergy, in particular kerosene, have become progressively more expensive, use of cheaper \nelectricity will increase savings. Power exports will increase the Government\u2019s revenue base \nand  enable  the  Government  to  make  more  resources  available  for  socioeconomic \ndevelopment including health, education, and rural electrification. In 2006/07, revenues from \npower  exports  contributed  to  all  the  expenditures  for  agriculture  and  social  sectors  (e.g., \nhealth and education). During the next FYP, the Government considers that revenues from \nhydropower  development  will  be  the  major  source  for  directly  improving  quality  of  life  and \nreducing  poverty.  Incremental  income  from  power  exports  will  be  used  for  improving  and \nexpanding  road  and  bridge  infrastructure  to  promote  rural  development  for  poverty \nreduction.\n\nD. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\n73. \nADB  classifies  the  Project  as  environment  category  B.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nEnvironment  Policy  (2002) and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003),  a  summary \nIEE  (SIEE)  was  prepared,  and  reviewed  by  ADB,  to  provide  a  sound  basis  for  project \nprocessing  and  implementation  (Appendix  15  and  Supplementary  Appendix  H).  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental  due  diligence  covers  all  project-associated  facilities  including  access  roads \nand a transmission line from the Dagachhu plant.  \n\n74. \nIn accordance with the national legislation, an environmental impact assessment was \ncompleted  for  the  Dagachhu  component  in  July  2006,  and  the  National  Environment \n\n\f21\n\nCommission granted the environmental clearance in June 2007. The Dagachhu component \nuses  a  run-of-river  design  and  does  not  encroach  on  any  protected  areas.  Mitigation \nmeasures included in the EMP are designed to assure the avoidance of any damage to the \nlocal  environment  or  communities,  or  disturbance  of  important  habitats.  No  human \nsettlement relocation is required for project implementation. Some impacts will occur due to \nconstruction of an access road, but the road does not cross any protected areas or disturb \nlocal  habitats  in  the  51  hectares  of  broadleaf  and  conifer  forest  and  scrub  for  the  whole \ndevelopment area. This is a small amount in relation to the very large areas of similar habitat \npresent nearby. Impacts on biodiversity will be minimal.39\n\n75. \nThe National Environment Commission and Department of Forests provided national \nenvironmental  and  forestry  clearances  for  the  rural  electrification  component,  and  initial \nenvironmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were  issued  for  each  district  of  the  project  area.  While \nconstruction  of  the  distribution  infrastructure  is  not  expected  to  have  major  adverse \nimpacts,40 some negative environmental impacts will occur as most of the villages targeted \nfor electrification are located in forested areas. These impacts will be mitigated through the \nEMP,  which  requires  a  set  of  measures  including  the  reduction  of  clearance  areas  for  the \nrights-of-way,  installation  of  covered  conductors  in  areas  close  to  protected  areas  and \nsensitive habitats, and alignment of distribution lines along public roads (on curbs) that are \nexcluded from the protected status according to the Road Act of Bhutan 2004. In addition, \nall civil works will be performed by  manual labor, and cutting of trees will be monitored by \nstaff  from  Department  of  Forests  local  offices.  After  implementation,  the  schemes  will \noperate without major negative environmental impacts.41\n\nE. \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nDagachhu  Hydropower.  Two  external  risks  relate  to  off-take  and  CDM.  While  the \n76.\noff-take  tariff  was  agreed  with  an  Indian  private  power  trader  (i.e.,  TPTC,  para.  31)  on \ncommercial  terms,  the  regulatory  or  tariff  revision  risk  is  considered  minimal  as  the  power \npurchase  agreement  defines  the  base-year  tariff  with  2%  constant  escalation  per  annum \nover  25  years.  Due  to  the  large  power  demand\u2013supply  gap  in  India,  the  small  114  MW \nDagachhu generation capacity is likely to be absorbed in the power trading market. Second, \nthe  Dagachhu  hydropower  development  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  additional  cash \nflows will be generated from the sale of carbon emission reductions, however, the nature of \na  post-2012  CDM  framework  is  as  yet  unknown.  To  mitigate  the  risk  of  this  uncertainty, \nDHPC and TPTC have in principle agreed for the purchase of the emission reductions to be \nunderwritten by TPTC over the 30 year duration at a specific minimum price. Therefore, the \noverall project risk to the financial sustainability due to external factors is deemed minimal. \n\n                                                          \n39 As  per  the  EMP,  DHPC  will  continue  to  monitor  the  air,  soil,  water  quality  baseline,  and  aquatic  life  and \nmigratory  fish  species  to  determine  the  minimum  ecological  water  flow  and  an  optimal  design  for  the  civil \nworks.   \n\n40 This is because (i) distribution line routes were chosen to minimize the need for forest clearance; (ii) 30% of \ndistribution  lines  will  be  in  unforested  areas  where  a  right-of-way  will  not  be  necessary;  (iii)  lines  will  be \nlocated on road curbs, which are not subject to environmental protection status; (iv) all other construction work \nis small in scale and will be conducted by manual labor without the use of heavy vehicles and machinery; (iv) \nmost  affected  areas  outside  the  villages  are  uninhabited,  and  work  in  villages  can  be  conducted  without \ncausing  major  disruption  to  residents;  and  (v)  construction  work  is  relatively  straightforward  and  can  be \ncompleted in a fairly short time. \n\n41 Rural  electrification  schemes  normally  operate  with  routine  maintenance  and  only  occasional  repair;  any \n\nrepairs should be small in scale and infrequent.\n\n\f22\n\nPotential  risks  for  the  component  include  (i)  increase  in  cost  of  civil  works  and \n77. \nequipment, and (ii) delays in project implementation. The cost and time overrun risks are to \nbe  mitigated  by  contractual  warranties  in  the  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction \ncontracts.  Sufficient  physical  and  price  contingencies  have  been  considered  for  any \nincrease  in  the  equipment  and  civil  works  costs.  The  component\u2019s  main  sponsor,  DGPC, \nhas  already  implemented  hydropower  projects  with  various  agencies  and  is  operating  four \nhydropower plants in Bhutan. DHPC staff have experience executing hydropower projects. \nThis  will  minimize  the  risk  of  cost  and  time  overruns,  along  with  PPP  arrangements  with \nTPC\u2014a  joint  venture  partner  in  the  component  with  extensive  experience  in  implementing \nand operating hydropower projects worldwide. TA funded by the Government of Austria will \nsupport  DHPC  in  implementation  and  supervision  during  construction.  The  risk  and \nmitigation analysis is presented in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n\nRural  Electrification.  The  overarching  objective  of  rural  electrification  is  to  reduce \n78.\npoverty  by  promoting  local  economic  development  through  provision  of  electricity  supply. \nHowever,  investment  and  operations  in  rural  electrification  will  be  not  financially  viable \nbecause of the rural customer\u2019s low paying capacity, associated risks, and high staffing cost \nfor utility services in remote areas. Therefore, the Government\u2019s financial assistance in the \nform  of  an  up-front  capital  subsidy  is  inevitable.  Since  failure  to  mobilize  the  necessary \ncounterpart funds is critical to the component, the Government has assured timely provision \nof counterpart funding. \n\n79. \nPotential risks for the component include (i) increase in cost of construction materials \nand  transportation  due  to  higher  fuel  prices,  (ii)  delays  in  construction  due  to  procurement \nand contract awards, and (iii) difficult accessibility due to undeveloped access roads. These \nrisks  are  to  be  mitigated  by  (i)  adequate  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  cost \nestimates  based  on  recent  actual  bid  prices;  (ii)  advance  procurement  action;  and  (iii) \nintegration of road development plans in rural electrification programs.  \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n80. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government,  and  executing  and \nimplementing agencies have given the following assurances, which are incorporated in the \nlegal documents. \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Aspects \n\nCounterpart Funding.

The  Government  will  cause  the  executing  and  implementing \n92.\nagencies to monitor and audit implementation of the EMP, and report to ADB twice a year \non  EMP  implementation.  The  Government  and  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies \n\n\f24\n\nwill  ensure  that  the  Project  (i)  does  not  take  place  within  national  parks,  wild  and  planted \nforests,  and  wildlife  sanctuaries  without  prior  environmental  clearances  obtained  from  all \nrelevant  government  agencies;  and  (ii)  avoids  monuments  of  cultural  or  historical \nimportance. The Government will cause DGPC and DHPC to monitor the air, soil, and water \nquality  baselines  and  the  minimum  ecological  water  flow  for  a  minimum  of  2  years,  and \nupdate the EMP in consultation with and to the satisfaction of ADB if any of these baselines \nsuggest  that  changes  to  the  existing  EMP  are  required,  and  if  any  unanticipated \nenvironmental impacts arise.  \n\n5. \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  The  Government,  and  the  executing  and \n93.\nimplementing agencies will ensure that (i) all land and rights-of-way required by the Project \nare  made  available  in  a  timely  manner;  (ii)  any  involuntary  resettlement  will  be  avoided  or \nminimized. The Government, and the executing and implementing will also ensure that (i) in \ncollaboration  with  the  competent  authorities,  title  deeds  for  the  new  plots  of  land  will  be \nmade  available  to  all  affected  persons  by  31  December  2008,  (ii)  the  provisions  of  the \nresettlement  plan,  including  compensation  and  entitlements  for  affected  households  and \npersons, will be implemented, and (iii) the Project is in compliance with all applicable laws \nand  regulations  of  the  Government,  including  those  amended  from  time  to  time,  and  the \nentitlement  benefits  as  listed  in  the  Government\u2019s  applicable  laws,  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary\nResettlement Policy (1995). \n\nResettlement  Plan  Disclosure.  If  any  changes  are  made  to  the  design  of  the \n94.\nProject that affects the land to be acquired or used for the Project in any way, or if new land \nacquisition and/or involuntary resettlement is required for the Project, the Government, and \nthe  executing  and  implementing  agencies  will  prepare  or  update  the  resettlement  plan  for \nADB review and approval, prior to any land acquisition being initiated and no later than the \naward  of  civil  works,  and  disclose  the  resettlement  plan  to  affected  people  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s applicable information disclosure requirements. The Government will ensure that \nessential public infrastructure that may be affected under land acquisition and resettlement \nis  replaced  as  appropriate  in  an  expeditious  manner  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement \nplan.\n\nCompensation. The  Government,  DGPC,  and  DHPC  will  ensure  that  (i)  sufficient \n95.\nbudgetary resources are made available to cover all compensation and associated costs; (ii) \nall  compensation  will  be  paid  at  the  applicable  rates  for  project  implementation  as  per  the \nresettlement plan; (iii) rates will be revised by September 2008 to ensure application of the \nactual  market  price,  and  the  entitlement  matrix  in  the  resettlement  plan  should  be  used  in \ndetermining the suitable compensation; (iv) payments are made in a timely manner, in any \ncase before dispossession and beginning of civil works; (v) all project-affected persons are \ncompensated fairly, such that their living standards are not adversely affected; and (vi) any \nrelocation, resettlement, and compensation of any project-affected persons will be promptly \nand efficiently carried out in accordance with the resettlement plan, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary\nResettlement Policy  (1995),  such  that  project-affected  persons  will  at  least  maintain  their \nstandard  of  living  at  the  same  level  as  before  project  implementation.  The  Government, \nDOE,  and  BPC  will  ensure  that  any  damage  to  crops  or  trees  or  any  other  asset  occur \nduring implementation of the rural electrification component will be compensated at market \nrates to the eligible affected person or community. \n\n\f25\n\nResettlement  Plan  Monitoring.  The  Government,  through  DHPC,  will  conduct \n96.\nmonitoring  of  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan.  The  Government  and  DGPC  will \nensure  that  DHPC  will  submit  progress  and  completion  reports  on  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement under the quarterly progress reports; and each of the Government, DGPC, and \nDHPC  will  ensure  that  the  compensation  completion  report  is  submitted  to  ADB  within  3 \nmonths of completion of implementation of the resettlement plan. \n\nConstruction Contracts. The executing and implementing agencies will ensure that \n97.\nconstruction  contracts  contain  binding  requirements  for  construction  contractors  to  (i)  fully \nreinstate pathways, other local infrastructure, and agricultural land to at least their preproject \ncondition upon completion of construction; and (ii) adequately record the condition of roads, \nagricultural  land,  and  other  infrastructure  prior  to  transport  of  material  and  construction \ncommencement.\n\nLabor  Standards.

The  most  critical  challenge  facing  hydropower \n1. \ndevelopment  in  Bhutan  is  the  lack  of  available  domestic  financial  resources  to  fund  large \ninvestments.  The  country\u2019s  Power  System  Master  Plan \nfor \nimplementation,  and  the  Government  considers  more  than  10  hydropower  projects  with \naggregate generation capacity of over 10,000 megawatts (MW) for implementation between \n2008  and  2018  during  the  10th  and  11th  five-year  plan  periods  (Table  A2). 1 The  total \ninvestment  requirement  will  be  more  than  $10  billion.  Such  a  capital  expenditure  is \nsignificant  compared  to  aggregate  capital  figures  for  the  rest  of  the  country\u2019s  economy.  In \nBhutan, limited public funds invariably need to be allocated to socioeconomic development \nfor health, education, and rural development. Under the circumstances, the Government will \nneed to develop a domestic capital market and diversify operations in the financial sector to \nraise domestic capital and intermediate with external funds.  \n\nidentifies  15  projects \n\nTable A2: Hydropower Projects Proposed during the 10th and 11th Five-Year Plans \n\nInstalled Capacity (MW)\n\nProject Name \nPunatsangchhu-I \nPunatsangchhu-II \nMangdechu \nChamkachu-I \nKholongchu \nAmochu \nKuri Gobgri \nSunkosh \nDagachhu \nChamkachu-II \nKhomachhu \nNikachhu \nMW = megawatt. \nSource(s): Gross National Happiness Commission. 2008.

The  Government\u2019s  investment  is  dependent  on  international \n2.\naid.  Increasing  debt  burden  from  external  sources  would  raise  the  issue  of  debt \nsustainability,  and  limit  access  to  financial  resources  for  the  country.  The  capital  needs  of \nthe power sector vastly exceed the availability of resources from traditional multilateral and \nbilateral  agencies,  and  domestic  financial  resources.  Development  finance  has  become \neven tighter given the declining worldwide trend in availability of concessionary financing for \npower development, and the recognition that scarce public resources are needed to develop \nsocial sectors. In this context, the strategic use of foreign public and private participation and \ninvestment will help accelerate the development of hydropower projects in Bhutan. \n\n                                                          \n1   A  number  of  large  hydropower  projects  with  more  than  500  MW  are  planned  for  development  under  the \n\nbilateral partnership between the governments of Bhutan and India.  \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n  31\n\nInvestment  Environment.  Private  and  foreign  direct  investment  is  in  its  early \n3.\nphases. Even though the underlying economic performance for hydropower development is \nstrong, its concomitant risks keep private investors away. This is most evident in emerging \nmarkets  where  the  most  unexploited  hydropower  potential  exists.  In  neighboring  countries \nsuch as India, private investment in hydropower sector was miniscule until recently. Hence, \none  of  the  challenges  for  Bhutan  is  to  develop  a  hydropower  development  policy  that  can \nattract  private  sector  participation  and  create  a  sustainable  and  competitive  investment \nclimate.\n\nMarket  Competition.  The  recent  private  sector investment  in  Indian  power  is \n4.\ncreating alternative and competitive generation sources. To solve the large domestic supply \ndeficit,  the  Government  of  India  has  unveiled  the  concept  of  large  thermal  projects:  ultra \nmega power projects. Some of these projects have offered tariffs in a competitive range of \n$0.03\u2013$0.05/kilowatt-hour.  These  attractive  tariffs  are  due  to  generation  being  available \nthroughout  the  year,  compared  to  run-of-river  type  hydropower  projects  in  Bhutan  where \ngeneration capacity is limited during winter months due to lower water flow. To increase the \ncomparative advantage of Bhutan\u2019s hydropower in the regional power trading market, some \npower  export  projects  must  be  promoted  on  commercial  principles,  unlike  past  projects \nwhere tariffs were politically negotiated on bilateral assistance.2 Any off-take prices set on a \ncommercial  basis  will  make  significant  impacts  on  subsequent  project  development  and \ninvestment.\n\nTransmission  Networking.  Bhutan  Power  Corporation  (BPC)  will  need  to  work \n5.\nclosely  with  its  Indian  transmission  counterpart  to  ensure  transmission  facilities  for  the \nexport  of  electricity.  BPC  is  responsible  for  developing  the  transmission  system  within \nBhutan for the evacuation of electricity from hydropower stations to the Indian border point \nof  transfer.  To  supervise  and  control  efficient  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  national \nsystem, BPC is developing a national load dispatch center, which is expected to contribute \nto  improving  system  reliability,  shortening  power  interruption  time,  and  reducing  system \nenergy losses. \n\nB. \n\nKey Challenges for Rural Electrification \n\nCost  Effectiveness.  The  average  capital  expenditure  for  household  electrification \n6.\nwas  $1,535  under  the  previous  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan  project. 3  This  is \nexpected  to  reach  $3,640  per  household  customer  in  the  planned  rural  electrification \ncomponent  of  the  Green  Power  Development  Project.  The  increased  electrification  cost  is \nmainly  due  to  recent  price  appreciations  of  materials  and  fuels  (e.g.,  steel,  copper,  and \ngasoline). In spite of a least-cost engineering design, the new rural electrification subproject \nwill  be  inherently  more  costly  due  to  more  remote  and  dispersed  project  areas  where  the \naverage  distribution  line  length  is  50%  longer  and  access  roads  are  further  away. 4 Any \nfuture  rural  electrification  program  will  have  even  higher  capital  expenditure  considering \ntougher  and  more  unapproachable  terrain.  Achieving  100%  electrification  is  estimated  to \ncost about $90 million.5 To improve project implementation efficiency, least-cost design and \n\n                                                          \n2   No  specific  tariff  regulations  are  in  place  for  cross-border  power  trading  between  Bhutan  and  India.  The \n\nexisting three power plants for export have export tariffs ranging from Rs1.8 to Rs2.0. \n\n3  ADB. 2003.

The Rural Electrification Master Plan. Tokyo. \n\n\f32\n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\neconomic  feasibility  analysis  will  be  required.  The  Government  set  up  an  off-grid \nelectrification arrangement as an alternate approach in case the economic rates of return for \nthe grid extended options are not feasible. \n\nSustainability. Rural electrification projects often require operating subsidy inputs to \n7.\nensure sustainability. Currently the subsidies for rural electrification are provided through (i) \nthe sale of power from generation companies to BPC at a rate that is less than the cost of \nproduction,6 and (ii) cross-subsidies from the sale of electricity to large industrial customers. \nUnder the Tariff Regulations, the regulator, Bhutan Electricity Authority, intends to effectively \ncap the total subsidy available from the sale of power, and require payment at the full cost of \npower  sales  to  India  for  all  local  consumption  in  excess  of  15%  of  Bhutan\u2019s  current \nhydropower generation capability. This means the subsidy will adequately cover low-voltage \nrural domestic customers below the lifeline tariff,7 with medium- and high-voltage customers \npaying the full cost of supply. Nevertheless, BPC\u2019s expenditures for rural distribution system \noperation  and  maintenance,  combined  with  customer  services  result  in  a  loss-making \nproposition  for  BPC.  It  must  develop  a  participative  approach  where  minor  repairs, \nmaintenance,  and  billing  and  collection  work  will  be  outsourced  to  contracted  villagers.8\nMaintenance  responsibilities  and  ownership  for  off-grid  batteries  will  be  transferred  to \ntrained village technicians.9\n\nInterregional Transmission Network. The lack of an interregional transmission link \n8.\nbetween  the  western  and  eastern  regions  of  the  country  has  led  to  constrained  industrial \ngrowth  in  these  regions.  Due  to  limited  generation  availability  in  the  eastern  region,  the \nextent  of  rural  electrification  has  lagged.  Hence,  the  interconnection  of  the  western  and \neastern grids in Bhutan will increase the reliability of electricity supply in the eastern region \nand  reduce  dependence  on  import  from  India  during  the  winter  when  generation  from \nKurichhu is insufficient to meet domestic demand. The interconnected grid will also provide \nopportunities for accelerated industrialization in the eastern and central region of the country. \n\n                                                          \n6  The  average  production  cost  of  electricity  from  hydropower  generation  in  Bhutan  is  Nu1.19/kilowatt-hours \n(kWh). Electricity for local consumption is sold to BPC for Nu0.3/kWh. Electricity is sold to India for Nu2.0/kWh, \nexcept  in  eastern  Bhutan,  where  electricity  from  the  Kurichhu  hydropower  project  is  sold  to  India  for \nNu1.80/kWh.\n\n7  In 2007, domestic customer consumption was 14.88% of the total BPC consumption. \n8  ADB.  2006.

The  Government  of  India  funded  and \nassisted in constructing three major power stations: Chhukha, Kurichhu, and Tala for export \npurposes.  The  Government  of  Austria  supported  the  development  of  the  Basochu \nhydropower  plant  for  domestic  supply,  and  conducted  a  feasibility  study  for  the  proposed \nDagachhu  hydropower  development.  The  governments  of  Japan  and  Norway  supported \nfeasibility  studies  for  potential  hydropower  sites  and  prepared  the  Rural  Electrification \nMaster Plan and the Power System Master Plan, respectively. ADB and the governments of \nAustria, Japan and Netherlands have actively supported rural electrification.  \n\nADB  has  been  the  lead  agency  in  the  power  sector  providing  three  loans  and  10 \n\n3. \ntechnical assistance grants (Tables A3.1 and A3.2).  \n\nTable A3.1: Previous ADB Loans to the Power Sector \n\nLoan No. \nLoan 1375-BHU  Rural Electrification Project \nLoan 1712-BHU  Sustainable Rural Electrification Project \nLoan 2009-BHU  Rural Electrification and Network Expansion Project \n\nProject\n\n \n\nTotal \n\nBHU = Bhutan.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nTable A3.2: Previous ADB Technical Assistance to Power Sector\n\nTA No. \nTA 2400-BHU \n\nTA 2912-BHU \nTA 3112-BHU\n\nTA 3307-BHU \nTA 3825-BHU \nTA 4188-BHU \nTA 4599-BHU \nTA 4766-BHU \nTA 9093-BHU  \nTA 4916-BHU \n\nProject\n\nInstitutional and Financial Strengthening of \nDepartment of Power \nSecond Rural Electrification \nPolicy and Legal Framework for Power Sector \nDevelopment \nCorporatization of the Department of Power \nRural Electrification and Network Expansion \nCapacity Building of Bhutan Electricity Authority \nCapacity Building for Bhutan Power Corporation \nAccelerated Rural Electrification \nRural Electrician Training Program \nPreparing the Bhutan Power Development \n \n\nTotal \n\nBHU = Bhutan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\n7.5 \n10.0 \n9.3 \n26.8 \n\nApproval \nYear\n1995 \n1999 \n2003 \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nApproval \nYear\n1995 \n\n0.4 \n\n0.6 \n0.5 \n\n0.6 \n0.7 \n0.4 \n0.4 \n0.7 \n1.0 \n1.6 \n6.9 \n\n1997 \n1998 \n\n1999 \n2002 \n2003 \n2005 \n2006 \n2006 \n2007 \n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\nDEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT \n\n1. \nThe  Department  of  Public  Accounts  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  is  responsible  for \nmanagement  of  government  external  borrowings.  It  has  shifted  its  debt  records  to  a  more \ninformation  system\u2014Commonwealth  Secretariat\u2019s  Debt  Recording  and \nsophisticated \nManagement System (CS-DRMS). The system is expected to be actively used for regularly \nmonitoring and analyzing debt. \n\nCurrent  Debt  Situation.  Total outstanding debt in Bhutan at the fiscal end of June \n2. \n2007 is estimated at Nu34,973 million, resulting in a debt to gross domestic product (GDP) \nratio  of  88%,  down  from  a  high  of  95%  in  2005/06  and  91%  in  2004/05.  The  drop  in \ndomestic and external borrowing contributed to the decrease in debt burden.  \n\n3. \nA  major  portion  of  the  Government\u2019s  borrowing  requirements  is  met  from  external \nsources. At the close of fiscal year 2006, domestic borrowing constituted only about 8% of \nboth  the  sanctioned  amount  and  the  total  outstanding  debt.  The  Government  of  India  has \nbeen  the  main  source  of  grant  aid  and  loans,  contributing  the  maximum  (53%)  of  Bhutan \nGovernment\u2019s  total  outstanding  debt.  Convertible  currency  loans  contributed  to  the \nremaining  debt  (i.e.,  39%).  Of  other  sources  of  borrowing  in  convertible  currency,  ADB \ncontributed  the  most,  about  17%  of  the  outstanding  debt  followed  by  the  International \nDevelopment Association (IDA), which contributed about 10%.  \n\n4. \nOn  similar  lines,  Indian  rupee  denominated  loans  contributed  53%,  while  special \ndrawing  right  (SDR)  loans  constituted  about  30%  of  total  loans  outstanding.  Euro-\ndenominated  loans  shared  about  9%  of  the  debt.  Overall,  the  Government  of  India,  ADB, \nIDA, and the Government of Austria were the main sources of external borrowing. \n\ntransport  and  communications  sectors \n\n5. \nSector  Composition  of  Government  Borrowing.  The largest portion (about 60%) \nof Government borrowing has been directed to investments in the rapidly expanding power \nsector.  The \ntelecommunications) \ncontributed  to  about  14%  of  the  outstanding  debt.  Among  other  sectors,  agriculture  and \nforestry consumed 7% of borrowing, while education and training, and social infrastructure \nsectors,  each  contributed  5%.  Thus,  the  Government  has  purposefully  used  external \nborrowing  for  power,  transport,  and  communications.  Since  the  power  sector  provides  a \ncomparative  advantage  to  Bhutan,  while  transport  and  communications  are  necessary \ninvestments  for  economic  growth,  the  Government  has  been  prudent  in  utilizing  its \nborrowing.\n\n(including \n\nA. \n\nMethodology \n\nTechnical  Justification  and  Selection  Criteria.  One  of \n\n6. \nimportant \nconsiderations  for  external  borrowing  for  the  Dagachhu  hydropower  development  is  its \nimpact  on  the  country\u2019s  economy.  This  assessment  essentially  entails  a  comparison  of \nbeneficial  impacts  in  terms  of  additional  growth  in  GDP,  exports,  and  revenues  with  the \nimpending fiscal stress resulting from additional debt service obligations for the borrowing. \n\nthe \n\n7. \nThe  debt  sustainability  analysis  is  in  accordance  with  the  debt  sustainability \nframework of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and IDA for low-income countries. The \nmethodology focuses on five key ratios: (i) net present value (NPV) of external debt to GDP; \n(ii) NPV of external debt to exports, (iii) debt service to exports, (iv) NPV of external debt to \nrevenue,  and  (v)  debt  service  to  revenue.  However,  the  IDA  14  approach  argues  that \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n  35\n\nrevenue-based  ratios  are  not  reliable  indicators  of  stress  because  of  external  debt  and \nrecommends three indicators of debt distress: (i) NPV of external debt to GDP, (ii) NPV of \nexternal debt to exports, and (iii) debt service to exports.The following analysis is confined to \nthese three indicators.\n\n8. \nUnder  the  debt  sustainability  framework,  the  magnitude  of  each  ratio  is  compared \nwith respective indicative thresholds defined for the ratio. The thresholds, in turn, depend on \nthe  classification  of  the  country  as  a  strong,  medium,  or  weak  policy  nation.  Furthermore, \nindicative thresholds follow a decreasing order as the countries move from a \u201cstrong policy\u201d \nto  \u201cweak  policy\u201d  classification.  Bhutan  is  classified  as  a  \u201cstrong  policy\u201d  nation  and  the \ncorresponding thresholds are used for the analysis. \n\nTo assess the impacts of the Dagachhu hydropower development, a forward-looking \n9. \napproach  is  used  to  examine  the  dynamic  behaviour  of  the  key  ratios  under  various \nscenarios. The dynamic analysis considers the impact of future borrowing and is preferable \nover static analysis, which is based on a snapshot of a country\u2019s external debt situation.1\n\n10. \nIn  assessing  the  debt  distress  of  countries,  the  debt  sustainability  framework \ncategorizes  them  into  three  groups:  low-,  moderate-,  and  high-risk  countries;  countries  in \nserious  debt  distress  breach  the  thresholds  by  a  significant  margin.  This  classification \ninvolves  examining  the  relative  distance  of  the  country  from  the  debt  distress  threshold \nbased on the three indicators. The debt situation in Bhutan was assessed accordingly.\n\n11. \nLiabilities  considered  for  analysis  include  the  existing  budget  and  off-budget  loans, \nloans  in  the  pipeline,  and  expected  additional  liabilities  because  of  the  fiscal  deficit.  The \ncomposition of new loans is assumed to follow past trends. \n\n12. \nThe impact of the planned borrowing for standby power projects (namely Dagachhu \nand  Punatsangchu-I)  was  analyzed  by  including  these  projects  in  stages  in  different \nscenarios.  In  addition,  the  impact  of  past  power  projects  was  assessed  separately  by \nexcluding debt service obligations and their beneficial impacts on the economy.  \n\nFurther, additional scenarios were examined by excluding all self-sustaining new and \n13. \nexisting  power  projects  from  the  Government  liabilities  to  measure  overall  impact  of  the \npower  sector  on  the  debt  sustainability  indicators.  This  is  based  on  the  self-sustainability \nconcept of \u201cenclave\u201d or commercially viable projects. \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis \n\n14. \nThe measurement of debt distress involves the thresholds for the three indicators, (i) \nNPV  of  external  debt  to  GDP\u201450%,  (ii)  NPV  of  external  debt  to  exports\u2014200%,  and  (iii) \ndebt service to exports\u201425%. \n\n15. \nThe  introduction  of  the  Dagachhu  hydropower  development  results  will  increase \nBhutan\u2019s external debt by $135  million over 3  years. The analysis shows that the ratios of \nNPV of debt to exports and debt service to exports remain within the thresholds even under \na scenario where 30% local currency depreciation is allowed. The NPV of debt to GDP ratio, \n\n                                                          \n1   ADB  uses  the  analysis  from  the  2007  IMF\u2013IDA  debt  distress  classification,  which  has  a  cutoff  date  of  31 \nDecember  2006.  Under  the  analysis,  the  static  approach  was  used  in  the  absence  of  the  forward-looking \napproach. \n\n\f36\n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nwhich is already above the threshold and rises further when new loans are introduced, soon \nfalls steeply below the threshold. The rate of fall of this indicator is significantly higher than \nin the scenario even when new loans are not considered.  \n\nFurther the analyses show that although some of the key indicators rise in the short \n16. \nterm when new projects, Dagachhu and Punatsangchhu-I, are considered, the fall in these \nratios  is  significantly  faster  in  the  medium  term  than  when  these  project  loans  are  not \nconsidered. Also these indicators rapidly drop below the levels that would be achieved in the \nabsence of these projects. Thus, Bhutan would be at a disadvantage in the long run if the \nnew power project loans are not utilized. \n\n17. \nFrom a different perspective, since the Tala, Dagachhu, and Punatsangchhu-I power \nprojects  are  self-sustaining  with  firm  long-term  sales  contracts;  they  can  be  excluded  from \nthe  debt  stock  for  the  purpose  of  debt-sustainability  analysis.  With  this  approach,  all  three \nratios would remain within the sustainable limit throughout the period.  \n\nIf the calculations exclude the impact of all the existing power projects such as Tala, \n18. \nChhukha,  Kurichhu,  and  Basochu, \nthe  debt  situation  would  become  completely \nunsustainable and all three ratios would be adversely affected. This is because the benefits \nfrom these projects in terms of additional exports, revenues, and GDP growth are significant. \nThis means that although these large power projects may cause additional financial burden \nin the short term, the benefits in the long term far outweigh the debt burden imposed on the \ncountry.\n\nThe  financial  analysis  shows  that  the  Dagachhu  hydropower  development  is  self-\n19. \nfinancing and sustainable, and is not likely to have any burden on the Government budget. It \ncan  be  supported  given  its  positive  long-term  impact  on  the  economy  and  debt \nsustainability. \n\n20.  When considering the dynamic sustainability and solvency criteria of declining fiscal \nstress, the overall debt situation in Bhutan appears to be sustainable.  \n\nIn  June  2007,  based  on  the  prevailing  debt  situation,  the  IMF\u2013IDA  categorization, \n\n21. \nand available economic data until 2005, ADB classified Bhutan as a high-risk country.2\n\n22. \nSince then IMF\u2013IDA issued its staff report on article IV Consultation in October 2007 \nproviding  a  positive  assessment  of  Bhutan\u2019s  debt  distress.  Though  the  conventional \nindicators  and  tests  point  to  Bhutan  as  having  a  high  risk  of  debt  distress,  IMF  Article  IV \nConsultation  on  Bhutan  (October  2007)  suggests  that  mitigation  factors  such  as  Bhutan\u2019s \nexperience  in  implementing  and  operating  hydropower  projects,  and  its  relationship  and \nwider dialogue with India, and its support to annual budget, have substantially improved the \ndebt  dynamics.    Therefore  IMF  concludes  that  Bhutan's  risk  of  external  debt  distress  is \nmoderate,  reflecting  the  authorities'  good  record  of  implementation  of  externally  financed \nhydroelectric  projects,  high  overall  foreign  exchange  reserves,  and  strong  external \ndevelopment agency support for power projects.

The  cost  of  the  Dagachhu  hydropower \n1.\ndevelopment  is  estimated  at  $201.5  million  including  all  related  costs  and  contingencies, \nassuming  debt  of  $121.5  million  (60%)  and  equity  of  $80.0  million  (40%). ADB  is  expected  to \nfinance $80 million as the development anchor money to take the lead for financial structuring \nfor both debt and equity. ADB loans will consist of (i) $51 million from the ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources  (OCR)  and  (ii)  $29  million  as  a  hard-term  loan  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund \n(ADF). Of the $80 million, $51 million (OCR) will be used for the debt portion of the Dagachhu \ndevelopment,  and  $29  million  (hard-term  ADF)  for  the  equity  portion  through  lending  to  the \nGovernment. The borrower of the ADB loans will be the Kingdom of Bhutan. \n\nEquity  and  Debt  Structure.  The  Government  will  support  the  equity  through  Druk \n2.\nGreen Power Corporation (DGPC) with a leverage of ADB finance ($29 million). The balance of \nthe  total  equity  ($80  million)  will  be  mobilized  from  (i)  public  capital  from  the  Government  ($7 \nmillion), DGPC ($11 million), National Pension and Provident Fund (NPPF) ($12 million); and (ii) \nprivate resources of the Tata Power Company ($21 million). The debt balance of the total debt \n($121.5 million) is expected to be financed by the Austrian export credit agency, OeKB ($55.5 \nmillion), and NPPF ($15 million).

With  a  total  installed \ncapacity  of  about  1,500  megawatts  (MW)  and  a  maximum  domestic  demand  of  157  MW, \nBhutan is a net power exporter to India. The power sector accounts for a significant proportion \nof the gross domestic product (GDP) and provides the Government with more than 40% of its \ntotal  revenue.  Given  the  importance  of  the  power  sector,  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  is  to \ncontinue  to  give  priority  to  developing  Bhutan\u2019s  hydropower  potential  to  increase  government \nrevenues  and  provide  an  important  input  for  economic  growth  and  development  with  minimal \nenvironmental  impact.  In  2006,  the  governments  of  Bhutan  and  India  signed  an  umbrella \nagreement  to  develop  and  trade  an  additional  5,000  MW  of  hydropower  by  2020.  Now  the \ngovernments aim to increase this target to 10,000 MW.   \n\nThe  Government  is  looking  to  accelerate  development  of  hydropower  generation  by \n2. \nleveraging  public  and/or  private  investments.  To  provide  the  framework  for  attracting \ninvestments in hydropower, the Hydropower Development Policy was formulated with technical \nassistance  (TA)  support  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).1 To  accelerate  hydropower \ndevelopment, the Government plans to restructure DOE to form the Energy Secretariat, which \nwill be the nodal agency for soliciting investment proposals and selecting developers through a \ncompetitive bidding and/or strategic process. \n\nThe  Government  has  already  consolidated  its  three  government-owned  hydropower \n3. \ncorporations (Chhukha Hydro Power Corporation, Basochu Hydro Power Corporation, Kurichhu \nHydro Power Corporation) by amalgamating them into a single corporation, Druk Green Power \nCorporation  (DGPC)  in  January  2008.  It  also  plans  to  merge  the  Tala  Hydroelectric  Project \nAuthority  with  DGPC  in  2009.  DGPC  will  be  the  agency  responsible  for  implementation  of \nhydropower  projects  to  be  developed  under  public\u2013public  and  public\u2013private  partnership \nroutes.2\n\nUnder  a  royal  charter  issued  on  11  November  2007,  a  government  holding  company, \n4. \nDruk  Holding  Investment  (DHI)  was  formed  to  hold  the  shares  of  the  Government  in  11 \ncompanies in areas such as hydropower, banking, minerals, and natural resources, where the \ngovernment has a full or partial stake. DHI is expected to play a major role in accelerating the \nfuture  development  of  Bhutan\u2019s  hydropower  resources  since  Bhutan  Power  Corporation  and \nDGPC are now fully owned corporations of DHI. \n\nAs  such,  three  government-owned  organizations,  DOE  (the  Energy  Secretariat),  DHI, \n\n5. \nand DGPC, will play a critical role in hydropower development in Bhutan. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (CDTA)  is  designed  to  (i)  promote \n6. \nhydropower development, which will contribute to Bhutan\u2019s economic growth, and (ii) enhance \nregionwide energy efficiency and cross-border cooperation. These impacts will be achieved by \n\n                                                          \n1   ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Preparing the Bhutan Power Development Project.\n\nManila. \n\n2   Under the Hydropower Development Policy, DOE will mainly promote and execute the bilateral projects. \n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 9 \n\nbuilding capacity to implement the Hydropower Development Policy. The CDTA will result in (i) \nstrategy and an action plan to broaden financing avenues for future large hydropower projects \nfor DGPC and DHI; (ii) internal capacity development within DGPC to manage development of \ncommercial hydropower projects on its own or through partnerships with private and public joint \nventures  or  foreign  investment,  and  (iii)  internal  capacity  building  in  DOE  for  promoting  more \nprojects  in  line  with  bilateral  programs  and/or  the  policy.  To  make  the  results  practical  and \nvisible, the CDTA will be implemented through preparation of actual demonstration projects that \nwill  focus  on  a  financial  structuring  study  and  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM)  project \ndesign document development.  \n\nC. \n\n7. \n\nMethodology and Key Activities \n\nThe CDTA will have three focus areas. \n\nComponent  1:  Facilitating  financing  of  DHI  and  DGPC  for  hydropower  projects.\n8.\nThe  CDTA  will  undertake  a  review  of  Bhutan\u2019s  financial  market,  and  associated  policies  and \nregulations to assess local financing potential as well as options to attract foreign investments \nfor future hydropower development. The study will look at innovative financing and contractual \noptions including initial public offers, divestment of shares, and issue of bonds. The consultants \nwill share international best practices and experiences from other countries for financing large \nhydropower projects. The CDTA will formulate a strategy and prioritized action plan for Bhutan. \nThe  plan  will  include  changes  required  in  existing  legal  statutes,  policies,  and  regulations  to \nfacilitate greater access to financial markets for DHI and DGPC. \n\nComponent  2:  Developing  internal  capacity  for  DGPC  to  manage  commercial \n9.\nprojects.  The  CDTA  will  support  DGPC  in  developing  internal  capacities  for  hydropower \nprojects  under  public\u2013public  and  public\u2013private  partnership  routes.  This  will  include  building \ncapacities for soliciting investments, evaluating financing proposals, and negotiating for off-take \ntariffs.  To  achieve  visible  and  tangible  results,  the  CDTA  will  prepare  and  study  practical \nfinancial structuring options for standby hydropower export projects, namely the Nikachhu (210 \nMW) and Khomachhu (326 MW) projects. In order for DGPC to become a project management \norganization  to  develop  public  projects  allocated  to  DGPC,  the  CDTA  will  support  DGPC  in \nto  effectively  conduct  project \ndeveloping \nmanagement.  and  evaluate  existing  subsidiary  companies  and  new  project  investments.  To \napply  emission  reductions  for  CDM  and  the  subsequent  framework  for  climate  change,  the \nCDTA will assist DGPC in preparing the project design documents for any sample project(s).  \n\nintegrated  management \n\ninformation  systems \n\nComponent  3:  Building  internal  capacity  in  DOE  for  accelerating  hydropower \n10.\ndevelopment  in  line  with  the  Hydropower  Development  Policy.  The  CDTA  will  support \ncapacity  building  of  DOE  for  promoting  project  structuring,  conducting  due  diligence,  and \npreparing  financing  plans  for  these  and  other  selected  hydropower  projects.  The  CDTA  will \nassist DOE in acquiring additional capacity required in the areas of promotion, planning, design, \npower  tariff  negotiations,  contract  management,  environment,  social,  economic,  and  risk \nmanagement  areas  to  accelerate  hydropower  development  in  line  with  the  Hydropower \nDevelopment Policy. The CDTA will support DOE in restructuring to form the Energy Secretariat \nalong  with  identifying  specific  training  and  skill-building  requirements  in  the  newly  created \ndepartment  under  the  secretariat.  A  study  tour  will  be  made  to  observe  the  policy  and  project \nimplementation,  practices,  and  lessons  from  run-of-river  and  storage  plant  developments  in \nanother country. The scope of work will include formulation of a captive power generation policy \nand a renewable energy policy with focus on small and micro hydropower projects, in line with \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n49 \n\nthe  Hydropower  Development  Policy  and  Electricity  Act  2001,  which  will  be  reviewed  and/or \namended under assistance from the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation. \n\nBased  on  the  training  needs  assessment,  short-term  external  training programs  will  be \n\n11. \nprovided to key staff for capacity building. \n\nD. \n\nCost and Financing \n\nThe  CDTA\u2019s  total  cost  is  estimated  at  $1,512,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide \n12. \n$1,488,000. The CDTA will be jointly financed on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Fund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility \n($888,000) and the ADB technical assistance funding program ($600,000). The Government of \nBhutan  will  provide  $24,000  equivalent  of  local  currency  costs  through  in-kind  contributions, \nincluding  office  accommodation,  facilities,  data,  and  other  information.  The  detailed  cost \nestimates and financing plan are given in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n13. \nDOE will be the Executing Agency for all CDTA components. DGPC and DHI will be the \nimplementing  agencies  for  components  1  and  2.  The  DOE  director  general  will  be  the  project \ndirector,  overseeing  day-by-day  CDTA  implementation.  DOE,  DGPC,  and  DHI  will  help  the \nconsultants  liaise  with  other  government  ministries  and  agencies,  local  authorities,  and  other \nstakeholders  in  the  project  areas,  and  obtain  data  and  documentation  from  them.  They  will \nassign  the  counterpart  staff  for  each  expertise  areas  for  on-the-job-training  and  skills  transfer. \nDOE will provide sufficient office space, furniture, and support facilities to the CDTA consultants \non time.\n\n14. \nThe CDTA will be implemented over 24 months from January 2008 to December 2010. It \nwill require 55.5 person-months of consulting services (40.5 international and 15 national). The \nareas  of  expertise  and  outline  terms  of  reference  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  ADB  will \nengage  a  consulting  firm  or  consortium  of  firms  using  its  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedures  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). Equipment financed by the CDTA will be procured under ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\nA. \n\nDagachhu Hydropower Development \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nMethodology  and  Major  Assumptions.  The  financial  analysis  of  the  Dagachhu \n1.\nhydropower  development  of  the  Green  Power  Development  Project  was  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2005)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). Cost streams used to determine the financial internal rate of return \n(FIRR)  reflect  costs  of delivering  the  estimated  benefits.  The  weighted  average  cost  of  capital \n(WACC)  of  the  Dagachhu  hydropower  development  was  calculated  and  compared  with  the \nFIRR  to  ascertain  financial  viability.  The  sensitivity  of  the  FIRR  to  adverse  movements  in  the \nunderlying assumptions was also assessed. Based on this analysis, the Dagachhu hydropower \ndevelopment is determined to be financially viable.  \n\n2. \nThe costs of the development include all capital investment including civil works, roads \nand  bridges,  electric  and  mechanical  works  with  physical  contingencies,  operation  and \nmaintenance  costs,  and  resettlement  and  environmental  costs.  Additional  payments  are \nassociated with a 12% royalty power from the development to the Government for the initial 12 \nyears, and then 18% for the remaining 18 years. The hydropower development is assumed to \nhave  a  30-year  economic  life  and  to  revert  to  the  Government  at  nil  value  at  the  end  of  the \nconcession period. \n\n3. \nThe tariff for the sale of energy generated has been agreed with the Tata Power Trading \nCompany  (TPTC),  India,  and  the  power  purchase  agreement  (PPA)  has  been  signed  with \nTPTC. The base-year tariff is agreed at Rs2.40/kilowatt hours (kWh) with 2% annual escalation \nover  the  25-year  PPA  and  a  rebate  of  2%  for  timely  payment.  Under  the  terms  of  the  PPA, \nTPTC will buy at least 88% of the energy generated from the Dagachhu hydropower facility. For \nthe balance of the power, TPTC will ensure merchant sales on a best effort basis if required by \nDruk Green Power Corporation (DGPC). The delivery point will be the northern grid of India at \nthe India\u2013Bhutan border. All losses and taxes beyond the Bhutan border will be borne by TPTC. \nThis price includes all transmission costs, and taxes applicable in Bhutan. As payment security, \nTPTC  will  establish  and  maintain  an  irrevocable  letter  of  credit  in  favor  of  Dagachhu  Hydro \nPower  Corporation  (DHPC);  the  amount  of  the  letter  of  credit  will  be  the  equivalent  of  the \nmaximum  generating  month  during non-monsoon  (8  months)  and  maximum  generating  month \nduring the monsoon (4 months). \n\nThe Dagachhu development was originally initiated as a Clean Development Mechanism \n4. \n(CDM)  case.  The  development  posted  its  application  to  the  United  Nations  Framework \nConvention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)  website  for  public  comments  in  2007.  The \ngovernments  of  Bhutan  and  India  have  already  approved  it  as  a  CDM  project.  Presently,  a \nvalidation report is being prepared and DHPC will seek registration with the CDM Board of the \nUNFCCC.    Based  on  the  advanced  process,  TPTC  signed  a  term  sheet  to  underwrite  the \npurchase  of  emission  reductions  over  30  years  at  the  minimum  specific  price  in  euros.  These \nrevenues are duly considered in the analysis. \n\nCalculation  of  Weighted  Average  Cost  of  Capital.  The financing plan for computing \n5.\nthe  WACC  considers  that  equity  contributions  will  be  provided  by  the  Government,  DGPC, \nNational Pension and Provident Fund, and Tata Power Company. The debt component will be a \nmix  of  local  and  foreign  loans  including  the  ADB  loans.  The  cost  of  Dagachhu  equity  is \nconsidered at 14%. The domestic inflation rate is taken at 5.00% and the international inflation \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n51 \n\nrate at 2.39% for the dollar component and 1.99% for the euro component. The average WACC \nfor the Dagachhu hydropower development is 5.63% (Table A10.1). \n\nTable A10.1: Weighted Average Cost of Capital for Dagachhu Hydropower Development \n\nADB \nLoan\nSource\n51.00 \nA.

The  after-tax  financial  internal  rate  of \n6.\nreturn (FIRR) is 10.44 % for the Dagachhu hydropower development, and compares favorably \nwith  the  estimated  WACC  at  5.63%,  substantiating  the  financial  viability  of  the  Dagachhu \ndevelopment. \n\n7. \nSeparate  analyses  were  carried  out  to  examine  the  sensitivity  of  the  FIRR  to  adverse \nchanges  in  key  variables:  an  increase  in  construction  time  by  6  months,  a  10%  increase  in \nproject costs, and a 10% decrease in energy generation (Table A10.2). The results are robust \nwith the sensitivities exceeding the WACC; the development is most sensitive to a reduction in \nenergy generation. \n\nTable A10.2: FIRR Sensitivity Analyses: Dagachhu Hydropower Development \n\n  Variable \n \n \n\n \nItem \nBase Case \nTime Period \nProject Cost \nGeneration \nWACC \nDSCR = debt service coverage ratio, FIRR = financial rate of return, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: ADB staff estimates. \n\nMinimum \n1.5 \n1.4 \n1.3 \n1.3 \n \n\nFIRR \n(%) \n10.44 \n10.00 \n9.48 \n9.38 \n5.63 \n\nAverage \n2.2 \n2.1 \n1.9 \n1.9 \n \n\n+6 months \n+10% \n\u201310% \n\nDSCR \n\nB. \n\nRural Electrification \n\nMethodology and Major Assumptions.

All  financial costs  and  benefits  are  expressed  in constant  2008  prices.  Cost  streams \nused  for  the  FIRR  determination  reflect  costs  of  delivering  the  estimated  benefits. The  WACC \nfor rural electrification was calculated and compared with FIRR for each of seven subprojects to \ndetermine  the  financial  viability.  The  sensitivity  of  the  FIRR  to  unfavorable  movements  in  the \nunderlying  assumptions  was  also  assessed.  The  off-grid  component  for  rural  electrification  is \nanalyzed in Supplementary Appendix L. \n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nThe  costs \n\ninclude  all  capital \n\nincluding  civil  works,  material  costs, \ninvestment \n9. \ntransportation  costs,  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  social  and  environmental  costs,  and \nphysical  contingencies.  The  component  is  expected  to  have  a  30-year  economic  life  after \nconstruction.  The  base  tariff  for  projections  is  the  country\u2019s  1  July  2009  electricity  tariff  with \nannual escalation of 5%, which the regulator has already given notice under the multiyear tariff \nscheme.\n\nCalculation  Weighted  Average  Cost  of  Capital.  To compute the WACC, 79% of the \n10.\nfinancing source is assumed to be the interest-free Government loan (financed through the ADB \ngrant) and the remaining 21% in the form of Government  equity to BPC. The cost of equity is \ncalculated at 6% after upward adjustments for the duration of the rural electrification component \nand associated risks. The average WACC for the rural electrification component is 0.20% (Table \nA10.3).\n\nTable A10.3: Weighted Average Cost of Capital for Rural Electrification \n\nItem\nA. Amount ($ million) \nB.

The  FIRR  is  calculated  at  a  negative \n11.\n5.99% for the rural electrification component. The rate compares unfavorably with the estimated \nvalue  of  WACC  at  0.20%,  indicating  that  the  rural  electrification  component  is  not  financially \nviable. A sensitivity analysis of the operation and maintenance cost element, capital costs, and \ntime overrun was completed to identify the implications of increase of these costs on component \nviability.  Table  A10.4  indicates  the  sensitivity  of  FIRRs  to  an  increase  in  operation  and \nmaintenance  costs,  capital  costs,  and  time  period.  Any  financial  loss  arising  from  rural \nelectrification subprojects will be compensated through the cross-subsidy policy mechanism in \naccordance with the Tariff Determination Regulation of the Bhutan Electricity Authority. \n\nTable A10.4: FIRR Sensitivity Analysis: Rural Electrification \n\n \nItem  \nBase Case \nOperation and Maintenance \nCapital Costs \nTime Period \nAll of the Above \nWACC \n\n  \n\nVariable  \n\n \n \n\n+10% \n+10% \n     + 1 year \n \n\n \n  \n\n  \n\nFIRR \n% \n(5.99) \n(7.08) \n(7.53) \n(6.17) \n(9.21) \n0.20 \n\n(  )  =  negative  value,  FIRR  =  financial  internal  rate  of  return,  WACC  = \nweighted average cost of capital. \nSource: ADB staff estimates.                      \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n 53\n\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MANAGEMENT \n\nA.  \n\nDagachhu Hydro Power Corporation \n\nThe  Dagachhu  Hydro  Power  Corporation  (DHPC)  was  formed  as  an  authority  in  April \n1. \n2007 and incorporated in May 2008 as a special purpose vehicle created by the Government to \npromote the Dagachhu hydropower development.  \n\n1. \n\nProjected Financial Performance  \n\n2. \nCapital  Expansion  Program  and  Funding.  DHPC\u2019s  current  hydro  development \nprogram consists of 114 MW of power to be commissioned by the beginning of 2012 with a total \ncost of $201.5 million, including physical and price contingencies and financing charges. \n\n3. \nThe Government will route $36 million as equity through Druk Green Power Corporation \n(DGPC)  of  which  $29  million  will  be  financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the \nremaining $7 million by the Government\u2019s own sources. In addition, DGPC will invest $11 million \nas  equity.  The  remaining  equity  of  $33  million  will  be  provided  by  the  National  Pension  and \nProvident  Fund  ($12  million)  and  Tata  Power  Trading  Company  ($21  million).  ADB  plans  to \nfinance another loan of $51 million from its ordinary capital resources. The Austrian export credit \nagency, OeKB, plans to provide export credit of $55.5 million for electromechanical equipment \nas debt. The National Pension and Provident Fund will also provide $ 15 million as debt. \n\n4. \nRevenues.  As  per  the  power  purchase  agreement  signed  by  DGPC  with  Tata  Power \nTrading  Company  (TPTC),  TPTC  agrees  to  buy  the  generating  power  of  the  Dagachhu  plant. \nThe tariff is set at Rs2.40/kilowatt-hour (kWh) (Rs2.35/kWh after a discount of timely payments) \nwith annual escalation of 2.0%. \n\nOperation and Maintenance Costs. DHPC has established its corporate structure and \n5. \nemployed staff to fill various posts. Currently, DHPC is constructing the Dagachhu hydropower \ndevelopment with all salary expenses capitalized. The operation and maintenance expenses for \nDHPC are considered to be 1.00% of the development cost with annual escalation of 3%.  \n\nDepreciation  Cost.  The  average  depreciation  for  the  plant  is  estimated  at  3.3%  for \n\n6. \naccounting purposes. \n\nInterest  and  Financing  Charges.  The interest rate is based on the weighted average \n\n7. \ncalculation from three streams of term loans:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nfrom  ADB  with  tenure  of  30  years  and  an  interest  rate  linked  to  the  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR) in dollars;  \nfrom OeKB with tenure of 19 years and a floating interest rate of 5.75% for 10% \nof the loan value and a fixed interest rate at 5.20% in euros for the balance (90%) \nof the loan value; and \nfrom a local lender (i.e., National Pension and Provident Fund) with a tenure of \n15 years with annual interest of 10%. \n\n8. \nInterest during construction is capitalized at the rate of interest during construction. The \ninterest rate on working capital finance is taken at 12.0%. Working capital is taken as 1 month of \noperation and maintenance expenses and 1 month of receivables from the sale of power. \n\n9. \n\nTransmission Losses. Transmission losses are calculated at 0.6% of gross generation. \n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 11 \n\n10. \n\nTaxation. Income tax is calculated as 30% on profits. \n\nKey  Financial  Performance \n\n11. \nthe \nprofitability projections for Dagachhu hydropower development and the key financial parameters \nfor the first 5 full years of operations are presented in Table A11.1.  \n\nIndicators.  The  key  assumptions  underlying \n\nTable A11.1: Summary of Dagachhu Hydro Power Corporation  \nFinancial Projections and Key Financial Ratios  \n\nYear ending 31st December \n\n2012 \n\n2014 \n\n2015 \n\nRevenues (A) (Nu million) \nOperating Expenses (B) (Nu million) \nInterests (C ) (Nu million) \nTax (D) (Nu million) \nRepayments (E) (Nu million) \nCash Surplus (A-B-C-D-E) \nReturn on capital employed (%) \nFixed assets coverage ratio (times) \nProfits before depreciation/Sales (times) \nProfits after tax/Sales (times) \nDebt service coverage ratio (times)\nSource: ADB staff estimates.                       \n\n2013 \n1,161\n84\n443\n110\n122\n402\n10.3\n1.7\n1.1\n0.3\n1.7\n\n569\n41\n188\n58\n0\n282\n4.7\n1.7\n1.1\n0.3\n2.5\n\n1,185\n86\n426\n124\n244\n305\n10.6\n1.8\n1.1\n0.3\n1.5\n\n1,224 \n89 \n404 \n145 \n244 \n342 \n11.4 \n1.9 \n1.1 \n0.3 \n1.5 \n\n2016 \n1,250\n92\n383\n160\n244\n371\n12.1\n2.0\n1.1\n0.4\n1.6\n\n12. \nThe projected financial performance will maintain adequate debt service coverage ratios, \nwith  the  minimum  of  1.5  times  and  average  of  2.2  times.  This  clearly  indicates  that  the \nDagachhu  development  will  generate  cash  surplus  to  fully  service  debt  obligations  and  that  it \nwill  be  in  a  position  to  finance  its  internal  requirements  from  its  own  sources.  The  profitability \nrepresented by an internal rate of return on equity is 15.6% on a before-tax basis and 12.0% on \nan after-tax basis. \n\n2.\n\nFinancial Management Assessment\n\n13. \nAs  DHPC  is  in  its  inception  stage,  its  financial  accounting  system  is  based  on  that \nfollowed  by  hydropower  subsidiaries  under  DGPC.  DHPC  generally  uses  spreadsheet-based \nsoftware  for  accounting  purposes.  In  some  cases,  DHPC  has  developed  in-house  software  to \nrecord  financial  transactions.  The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  supported  DGPC\u2019s \nintegration of the accounting system among its subsidiaries and the accounting software is to be \ninstalled  at  DGPC  and  each  of  its  subsidiaries  to  record  financial  transactions  in  a  common \nformat.  DHPC  is  expected  to  strengthen  its  accounting  management  and  move  from  manual \naccounting  procedures  to  an  integrated  computerized  financial  management  and  accounting \nsystem.\n\n14. \nDHPC follows financial accounting on an accrual basis as per provisions of its governing \nstatutes and generally accepted accounting principles. As a company it is subject to audit under \nthe  Companies  Act  of  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan,  2000  and  by  the  Royal  Audit  Authority.  DHPC \nhas a chart of accounts to enable proper recording of financial transactions. Since DHPC was \nformed on 13 May 2008, it has not prepared its first set of financial statements.  \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n55 \n\nThe  Future.  DHPC  will  strengthen  its  systems  and  move  from  manual  accounting \n15. \nprocedures to use of computerized management information and accounting systems. This will \nstrengthen  project  construction  management,  accounting,  and  reporting  procedures;  and  later \nhydropower  operating  procedures.  It  will  improve  overall  corporate  accounting  and  financial \nreporting, and provide the basis for accurate and timely accounting and reporting procedures for \nADB loan-financed projects. To achieve these goals, the joint venture partners, DGPC and Tata \nPower  Company  agree  to  have  the  seconded  or  professional  financial  staff  from  Tata  Power \nCompany assist DHPC financial management, in line with the shareholders agreement. DHPC \nand  DGPC  have  no  experience  managing  foreign  currency  debt  and  will  require  capacity \nbuilding for foreign exchange mitigation, fund raising, and concomitant risk management. These \nareas will be supported by a new technical assistance project for capacity development.  \n\nB. \n\nDruk Green Power Corporation \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\nDGPC,  incorporated  in  January  2008,  was  formed  by  the  amalgamation  of  three \n16. \nhydropower generating companies: Chhukha Hydro Power Corporation, Basochu Hydro Power \nCorporation,  and  Kurichhu  Hydro  Power  Corporation.  Since  the  Tala  Hydroelectric  Project \nAuthority (THPA), commissioned in 2006, will be merged  with DGPC  in 2009 or later, it is not \nreflected in the historical financial performance of DGPC.

As  the  plant  is  old,  it  has  a  low  book  value  but  continues  to  give  economic  benefits \nreflected by the high return on fixed assets at 109% in 2007. The debt to total assets ratio is low \nat 3% in 2006 and 0% in 2007.  \n\nThe Basochu plant has been showing an increasing trend in profits with profit after tax \n18. \nreaching Nu119 million in 2006 from Nu32 million in 2004. The debt to total assets ratio is high \nat around 62% in 2007. As the plant is relatively new, the return on fixed assets in 2007 is low at \naround 1.3%.\n\n19. \nThe  Kurichhu  plant  had  considerable  losses  until  2004.  In  2005,  the  plant  had  a  Nu39 \nmillion  profit.  However,  due  to  initial  years  losses  carried  forward,  the  amount  of  profits \ntransferred to the balance sheet is still negative Nu139 million in 2007. This is reflected in the \nreturn on net fixed assets, which has been maintained positive over these three years.  \n\n2. \n\nProjected Financial Performance  \n\nCapital  Expansion  Program  and  Funding.  DGPC  is  planning  to  enter  into  additional \n20. \npower  generation  schemes  including  the  Dagachhu  hydropower  development  in  2009.  These \ninvestments  along  with  the  regular  capacity  expansion  and  repair  and  maintenance  activities \ncan  be  sufficiently  financed  through  internal  sources  of  DGPC,  as  DGPC  has  significant  cash \nand cash equivalents as indicated in Table A11.3.  \n\nTable A11.3: Druk Green Power Corporation Capital Expenditure  \n(Nu million) \n\nParticulars\n\nCapital investment (A) \nNet cash flow before capital \ninvestment (B) \nFree cash flow after capital \ninvestment (B-A) \n\nSource: ADB and DGPC staff estimates. \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2013 \n\n2014 \n\n2015 \n\n442\n\n2,155\n\n342\n\n308\n\n340\n\n281 \n\n168\n\n160\n\n3,205\n\n3,382\n\n1,746\n\n1,788\n\n2,026\n\n1,823  1,854\n\n2,197\n\n2,762\n\n1,227\n\n1,403\n\n1,479\n\n1,687\n\n1,542  1,686\n\n2,037\n\n21. \nTariff  Revenue.  Export  sale  to  the  Power  Trading  Corporation  of  India  from  the \nChhukha plant is considered at a base rate of Nu2.0/kWh with a 5% escalation every 5 years, \nand that from Kurichhu plant at Nu1.80/kWh with a similar escalation. Domestic sale to Motanga \nis at Nu1.29/kWh with a similar escalation. Wheeling charges are unchanged at Nu0.13/kWh. In \naddition  revenues  from  the  sale  of  royalty  power  at  Nu0.30/KWh  and  demand  charges  on  a \nmonthly  basis  follow  the  same  escalation  principle.  Domestic  consumption  is  assumed  to \nincrease at 9% annually.  \n\nStaff Costs. For the projected figures, employee costs are adjusted year-on-year at 6% \n\n22. \ntaking into account the effect of inflation and increase in staff grades. \n\nGeneral  Administration  Expenses. General administration expenses are escalated at \n\n23. \n6% annually from the base level of 2007.  \n\n24. \nDepreciation Cost. Permanent buildings, compound walls, fencing, roads, culverts, and \ncivil  works  are  depreciated  at  3%  whereas  mechanical  works,  powerhouse  generators,  plant \nand  machinery,  transmission  lines,  and  substation  equipment  are  depreciated  at  5%. \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n57 \n\nSemipermanent  and  temporary  buildings  are  depreciated  at  20%  and  50%  respectively.  All \nother equipment is depreciated at 15%.  \n\nInterest  and  Financing  Charges. Interest charges on term deposits are considered at \n\n25. \n3% and interest for loans taken by Basochu is calculated at 6%.    \n\nTaxation and Dividend. DGPC pays tax at 30%, and is assumed to pay 90% of its profit \n\n26. \nafter tax as a dividend to shareholders.  \n\n27. \nKey Financial Performance Indicators. The opening financial position for DGPC as of \n1  January  2008  is  based  on  the  accounts  of  Chhukha  Hydro  Power  Corporation,  Basochu \nHydro  Power  Corporation,  and  Kurichhu  Hydro  Power  Corporation  for  the  year  ended  31 \nDecember  2007.  Table  A11.4  summarizes  the  results  of  the  financial  analysis  for  2008\u20132015. \nThe  debt  to  asset  ratio  is  progressively  declining  as  principal  is  being  repaid  and  retained \nearnings are building up. The return on average net fixed assets is high at 21% in 2008 primarily \ndue to the Chhukha plant. This increase to more than 30% in later years as the plants, though \nhaving a low book value, are able to generate significant economic returns. To be conservative, \nTHPA is not included in this projection. \n\nTable A11.4: Summary of Druk Green Power Corporation \n Financial Projections and Key Financial Ratios \n\nYear Ending  \n31 December \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2013 \n\n2014 \n\n2015 \n\nTotal Revenues (Nu million) \n\nTotal Expenses (Nu million) \n\n4,374 \n\n1,541 \n\n4,473 \n\n1,508 \n\n4,660 \n\n1,522 \n\n4,611 \n\n1,472 \n\n4,568 \n\n1,464 \n\n4,529 \n\n1,446 \n\n4,489 \n\n1,447 \n\n4,657 \n\n1,450 \n\nProfit after Tax (Nu million) \nCash and Bank Balances (Nu million) \nTotal Assets (Nu million) \nReturn on Average NFA (%) \n\n2,076 \n2,620 \n\n1,983 \n2,762 \n\n2,245 \n2,285 \n15,154  15,197  15,158  14,942  14,668  14,385  14,061  13,921 \n33 \n\n2,173 \n1,940 \n\n2,196 \n2,082 \n\n2,198 \n1,868 \n\n2,158 \n2,132 \n\n2,129 \n2,023 \n\n25 \n\n23 \n\n21 \n\n29 \n\n27 \n\n29 \n\n26 \n\nDebt Service Coverage Ratio (times) \nDebt/ Asset (Debt + Equity) (%) \n\n4.9 \n58 \n\n5.1 \n53 \n\n4.4 \n46 \n\n4.4 \n40 \n\n4.4 \n33 \n\n4.4 \n27 \n\n4.5 \n21 \n\n4.7 \n15 \n\nGWh = gigawatt-hour, NFA = net fixed assets, Nu = ngultrum. \nSource: ADB staff estimates.  \n\n28. \nOnce  THPA  (1,020  MW)  is  merged  with  DGPC  in  2009  or  later,  DGPC\u2019s  financial \nperformance will be much better. DGPC\u2019s strong balance sheet and profitability will enable it to \nmake leverage for external borrowing to execute more hydropower projects. This indicates that \nDGPC  is  in  a  position  to  contribute  equity  to  new  development  projects  from  its  own  revenue \ngeneration and/or borrowing and be able to act as a public joint venture partner in public\u2013private \npartnership programs.  \n\n3.  \n\nFinancial Management Assessment \n\n29. \nFinancial  management  assessment  was  undertaken  to  assess  the  current  ability  of \nDGPC  to  fulfil  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary  requirements  and  identify  areas  for  improvement.  DGPC \ncompleted  a  financial  management  assessment  questionnaire  to  facilitate  a  review  of  its \nfinancial systems and processes, and to identify issues or constraints. \n\nA chart of accounts and accounting manual for DGPC will be developed so that similar \n30. \naccounting and financial processes are followed throughout the organization. This requirement \nwill be significant when THPA is merged with DGPC in 2009. Presently, most of the hydropower \n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 11 \n\nplants and DGPC head office maintain accounting and financial systems using an off-the-shelf \naccounting package (i.e., Tally).  \n\n31. \nDGPC follows financial accounting on an accrual basis as per provisions of its governing \nstatutes  and  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Being  a  corporate  entity  and  a \ngovernment company, it is subject to audit under the Companies Act of the Kingdom of Bhutan, \n2000 and the Royal Audit Authority. Since DGPC is expected to be the Government agency to \nundertake the public investment portion of new hydropower projects, it will need to leverage its \nbalance  sheet  to  raise  commercial  financing  including  financing  from  international  sources. \nThus\u00b8  DGPC  needs  to  strengthen  its  systems  and  processes  to  become  an  international \nfinancial  reporting  standards  compliant  entity  so  that  it  is  easier  to  raise  funds  in  international \nfinancial markets. \n\n32. \nAccounting and financial reporting responsibilities are carried out as per a defined set of \ndelegation of powers, which needs strengthening. DGPC has no prior experience of managing \nforeign  currency  debt  and  will  require  capacity  building  for  foreign  exchange  fund  raising  and \nconcomitant  risk  management.  An  important  challenge  for  DGPC  is  management  of  financial \nresources for funding large investments in hydropower projects. DGPC will need to significantly \nenhance  its  capacity  in  the  areas  of  financial  reporting,  financial  management,  management \ninformation systems, and budgeting. \n\nThe  Future.  The  steps  undertaken  by  DGPC  to  improve  financial  management  will \n33.\nstrengthen project construction management, accounting, and reporting procedures; as well as \nimprove  DGPC\u2019s  overall  management  and  operating  performance.  DGPC  plans  to  implement \nan integrated computerized financial management and accounting system. Project preparatory \ntechnical assistance supported DGPC in preparing its consolidated balance sheet after merger \nof  the  three  existing  hydropower  companies  and  in  selecting  the  information  systems  to  be \ninstalled for integrated accounting and financial management across the hydropower plants.  \n\nC. \n\nBhutan Power Corporation \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n34. \nBhutan  Power  Corporation  (BPC)  was  established  on  1  July  2002  from  the  former \nDepartment of Power with a mandate to ensure that reliable, adequate, and affordable electricity \nis available to all citizens of Bhutan. BPC is responsible for transmission, distribution, and rural \nelectrification  activities.  As  of  December  2007,  it  had  77,433  customers.  Overall  transmission \nand distribution losses have been maintained at about 9%\u201310%.  \n\n35. \nAfter losses from 2003 through to 2005, BPC had profits of Nu269 million in 2006 and \nNu456 million in 2007. This is reflected in the return on net fixed assets, which increased from \nminus 0.6% in 2004 to plus 4.9% in 2007. The company\u2019s debt component increased from 13% \nin 2004 to 31% in 2007 primarily due to increased borrowing from the 2007 transfer of THPA\u2019s \ntransmission debts to BPC.  Table A11.5 summarizes the BPC\u2019s financial performance for the \npast years. \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n59 \n\nTable A11.5: Bhutan Power Corporation Financial Performance \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\nYear Ended 31 March \nFinancial Results \nProfit/Loss After Tax (Nu million) \nTotal Assets (Nu million) \nReturn on Net Fixed Assets (%) \nDebt / Asset (Debt+Equity) (%) \nAccounts receivable collection (months)  \n( ) = negative value, Nu = ngultrum. \nSource: Bhutan Power Corporation. \n\n    (28.0) \n6,295.0 \n      (0.6) \n      13.0 \n        1.5 \n\n    (130.0) \n  6,878.0 \n        (2.6) \n        18.0 \n          0.7 \n\n       269.0 \n     456.0 \n    7,338.0  10,934.0 \n         4.9 \n           4.9 \n       31.0 \n         19.0 \n         1.1 \n           0.4 \n\n \n\n2.  \n\nProjected Financial Performance  \n\n36. \nCapital Expansion Program and Funding. As a part of the capital expansion program, \nBPC  identified  many  areas  of  transmission,  distribution,  and  rural  electrification  where \nexpansion is required. Most of these activities are expected to be funded from internal sources \nof BPC (Table A11.6). A significant contribution is expected in the form of grants. \n\nTable A11.6: Bhutan Power Corporation Project Funding Source 2008\u20132018 \n(Nu million) \n\nProject \nTransmission \nDistribution \nRural Electrification \nHead Office \nOthers \nTotal \n\nLoans \n0 \n0 \n3,073 \n0 \n0 \n3,073 \nSource: Bhutan Power Corporation and ADB staff estimates. \n\nGrant \n3,463 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n3,463 \n\nInternal\nFunding\n7,897 \n336 \n320 \n659 \n1,103 \n10,315 \n\nTotal\n11,360 \n336 \n3,394 \n659 \n1,103 \n16,851 \n\n37. \nTariff  Revenue.  The consumer tariffs for BPC are determined by the Bhutan Electricity \nAuthority, which calculates the average cost of supply for each tariff category. The average cost \nof  supply  per  kWh  for  high-voltage,  medium-voltage,  and  low-voltage  categories  for  2007/08 \nwere computed as Nu1.62, Nu 1.93, and Nu 0.97 respectively. At present, the tariffs are fixed at \nNu1.43/kWh  for  high-  and  medium-voltage  consumers  and  Nu1.30/kWh  for  low-voltage \nconsumers.  The  subsidy  obtained  from  royalty  power  has  been  directed  at  low-voltage  tariffs \n(Nu750  million  per  annum),  so  the  costs  of  supply  for  low  voltage  are  not  fully  cost  reflective. \nThe  cost-reflective  supply  to  low-voltage  customers,  excluding  the  royalty  subsidy,  is  around \nNu3.4/kWh. The low-voltage tariff at Nu1.30/kWh covers 38% of this cost of Nu3.4/kWh. In 2007 \nhigh-  and  medium-voltage  consumers  subsidized  around  Nu1,045  million  for  low  voltage \ncustomers. For projection purposes, the supply tariffs are taken from the 1 July 2009 electricity \ntariffs,  approved  by  Bhutan  Electricity  Authority  under  the  multiyear  tariff  scheme,  with  annual \nescalation of 5% on the base tariff for projections.   \n\nStaff Costs. BPC has around 1,450 staff and an employee cost for 2007 of about Nu323 \n38. \nmillion.  For  projection  purposes,  employee  remuneration  is  increased  at  5%  for  inflation  and \nanother 2% for real increase in remuneration. \n\nOperation  and  Maintenance  Expenses.  Operation  and  maintenance  for  projection \n39. \npurposes  is  escalated  by  5%  annually  to  take  into  account  the  effect  of  inflation.  Proportional \nincrements for capacity expansion are duly considered.  \n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 11 \n\n40. \nDepreciation Cost. The depreciation rate for transmission assets and customer service \ndepartment  line  assets  is  set  at  3.33%,  and  at  5.00%  for  customer  service  department \ngeneration assets. The assets at the head office are depreciated at 6.4% per annum. \n\n41. \nTaxation  and  Dividend. Income tax is calculated at 30% of profits. BPC will set aside \naround Nu23 million from its net profit after tax for transfer to the general reserve and pay 20% \nof the remaining amount to shareholders as dividend.\n\n42. \nKey  Financial  Performance  Indicators.  Table  A11.7  summarizes  the  results  of \nfinancial analysis for 2008\u20132017. Assuming tariffs subsidized by the royalty, BPC is expected to \nmaintain adequate profitability and debt service capacity. However, the profitability is likely to be \ngradually  declined.  BPC\u2019s  future  financial  performance  will  be  influenced  by  the  very  high \nproportion of rural electrification within its network and the need to work within tariff policies that \nincorporate high cross-subsidization.    \n\nTable A11.7: Summary of Bhutan Power Corporation Financial Projections and Key \nFinancial Ratios \n\nYear Ending 31 \nDecember \nTotal Revenue  \n(Nu million) \nTotal Operating \nExpenses (Nu million) \nProfit after Tax  \n(Nu million) \nCash & Cash \nEquivalents (Nu million) \nTotal Assets  \n(Nu million) \nReturn on Net Fixed \nAssets (%) \nDebt Service Coverage \nRatio (times) \nDebt / Asset (Debt + \nEquity) (%) \nSource: ADB staff estimates.  \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2013 \n\n2014 \n\n2015 \n\n2016 \n\n2017 \n\n3,143 \n\n3,807 \n\n4,133 \n\n4,674 \n\n5,095 \n\n5,592 \n\n5,848 \n\n6,118 \n\n6,290 \n\n6,419 \n\n2,214 \n\n2,780 \n\n3,183 \n\n3,590 \n\n3,903 \n\n4,376 \n\n4,611 \n\n4,909 \n\n5,174 \n\n5,463 \n\n594  \n\n688  \n\n637 \n\n747 \n\n819 \n\n874 \n\n879  \n\n830 \n\n742 \n\n636 \n\n869 \n\n1,116 \n\n941 \n\n422 \n\n392 \n\n1,017 \n\n1,962 \n\n2,834 \n\n3,283 \n\n2,951 \n\n12,476  13,661  14,673  16,486  18,317 \n\n20,336 \n\n21,085 \n\n21,608 \n\n21,999 \n\n22,346 \n\n5.8 \n\n6.2 \n\n5.3 \n\n5.3 \n\n5.2 \n\n5.2 \n\n5.4 \n\n5.2 \n\n4.7 \n\n3.9 \n\n4.60 \n\n5.10 \n\n4.70 \n\n5.10 \n\n5.20 \n\n6.00 \n\n6.00 \n\n5.00 \n\n4.60 \n\n4.40 \n\n19.4 \n\n20.6 \n\n22.2 \n\n25.1 \n\n22.8 \n\n22.1 \n\n21.3 \n\n20.2 \n\n18.8 \n\n17.5 \n\n3.  \n\nFinancial Management Assessment \n\n43. \nA  financial  management  assessment  questionnaire  was  administered  to  facilitate  a \nreview  of  BPC\u2019s  financial  systems  and  processes  with  the  objective  to  identify  issues  and \nconstraints.  The  assessment  was  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines  using  the  financial \nmanagement assessment questionnaire and field interviews. \n\n44. \nBPC  has  53  accounting  units  under  29  branch  offices;  all  the  accounting  units  are \ncomputerized. BPC\u2019s Finance and Accounts Department is headed by a general manager with \n20 assistant finance officers throughout BPC. In the head office, four assistant finance officers \nhead  four  divisions:  finance  and  accounts,  asset  management,  management  information \nsystem,  and  budgeting.  The  finance  and  accounting  unit  has  53  staff  comprising  accountants \nand assistants.  \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n61 \n\nThe  BPC  finance  and  accounts  system  is  an  application  system  built  on  the  Oracle \n45. \ndatabase  platform.  BPC  has  a  well-defined  chart  of  accounts  for  recording  financial \ntransactions.  Accounting  and  financial  reporting  responsibilities  are  carried  out  as  per  the \ndelegation of powers defined and approved by the BPC board of directors. BPC\u2019s Finance and \nAccounts Department has developed procedures and guidelines for this reporting.  \n\n46. \nBPC follows financial accounting on an accrual basis as per provisions of its governing \nstatutes  and  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Being  a  corporate  and  a  government \ncompany, it is subject to audit under the Companies Act of the Kingdom of Bhutan, 2000 and \nthe Royal Audit Authority.  \n\n47. \nThe  Future.  BPC  raises  commercial  financing  for  its  investments  from  local  banks. \nGoing forward, it may be required to raise commercial financing outside Bhutan for some of its \ninvestment requirements. BPC needs capacity building for raising and managing external funds. \nAnother  area  of  capacity  building  is  in  the  field  of  budgeting.  BPC  carries  out  an  annual \nbudgeting  exercise  for  its  all  accounting  units  that  needs  to  be  well-documented  in  budgeting \nmanuals and procedures.  \n\nThe  detailed  financial  performance  for  DHPC,  DGPC,  and  BPC  is  analyzed  in \n\n48. \nSupplementary Appendix C. \n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\nA. \n\nDagachhu Hydropower Development \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nThe 114 megawatt (MW) run-of-river Dagachhu hydropower development is on the left \n1. \nbank of the Dagachhu River in Dagana district. It is planned to be implemented under the Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism (CDM) as defined in the Kyoto Protocol. A dedicated transmission line \nfrom Dagachhu to Dhajay will evacuate power from the hydropower plant. This transmission line \nis energized at 220 kilovolts (kV), has a single circuit on a single circuit tower, and is considered \nas a part of this facility for economic evaluation. \n\nGeneration  Forecast.  The  generation  system  for  the  Dagachhu  hydropower  plant  is \n2.\ndesigned to deliver power at a maximum flow of 50 cubic meters/second. Its mean annual net \nenergy  production  is  estimated  to  be  500  gigawatt-hours  (GWh),  while  the  net  energy \nproduction  with  90%  dependability  is  about  360  GWh.  The  economic  analysis  is  based  on  its \neconomic life of 30 years. \n\nCost.  The  Dagachhu  plant  is  expected  to  be  set  up  at  an  aggregate  cost  of  $201.5 \n3.\nmillion  (including  soft  and  hard  costs).  The  total  economic  cost  considered  in  this  current \neconomic assessment is $173.9 million, excluding price contingencies and financing costs. \n\nBenefits. The main benefit of the facility to Bhutan comes in the form of export of power \n4.\nto  India.  The  total  power  generated  is  expected  to  be  exported  at  a  border  price  of \nNu2.40/kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  and  a  2%  discount  on  timely  payment  leading  to  an  effective \nNu2.35/kWh.  When  Bhutan\u2013India  subregional  benefits  are  considered,  they  are  in  the  form  of \navoidance  of  operation  of  standby  generation  units  of  industrial,  commercial,  and  agricultural \nconsumers  as  well  as  serving  domestic  consumers  more  hours  of  electricity  at  average \ndomestic tariffs. \n\n5. \nUnder  the  CDM,  the  development  will  seek  emission  reduction  certificates  that  can  be \nsold to provide additional revenues to the facility. These benefits are assumed to continue even \nafter  the  first  commitment  period  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  which  ends  in  2012,  the  year  of \nexpected  commissioning  of  the  power  plant  since  Tata  Power  Trading  Company  in  principle \nagreed  to  underwrite  the  purchase  of  emission  reductions  for  30  years  beyond  the  first \ncommitment period at specific minimum price.   \n\nEstimation  of  Economic  Internal  Rate  of  Return.  Based  on  these  assumptions,  the \n6.\noverall Dagachhu facility has an estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 13.8% for \nBhutan, indicating that it is economically viable. When the benefit to Bhutan\u2013India subregion is \nconsidered, power exported to India is assumed to eventually replace diesel standby generating \nsets in industry, commercial, and agricultural sectors, while domestic consumers are willing to \nconsume  at  their  average  electricity  price.  With  these  assumptions  the  EIRR  considering  the \nbenefits  to  the  subregion  rises  to  22%  (net  present  value  at  12%  discount  rate  is  Nu488.3 \nmillion).\n\nSensitivity  Analysis.  To  test  the  robustness  of  the  results,  a  sensitivity  analysis  was \n\n7.\nbased on a variety of parameters tested separately (Table A12.1). \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n63 \n\nTable A12.1: Results of Sensitivity Analysis \n(%)\n \nVariable \n\n \nItem \nBase Case \nOperation and Maintenance \nCapital (Investment) Cost \nTime Period \nThreshold \nEIRR = economic rate of return.\nSource: ADB staff estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\n+ 10% \n+ 10% \n+ 1 year \n\nEIRR \n(country) \n13.8 \n13.7 \n12.6 \n12.8 \n12.0 \n\nEIRR \n(subregion) \n22.0 \n22.0 \n20.4 \n19.1 \n12.0 \n\nB.  \n\nRural Electrification \n\n8. \nThe Government has updated the target for household electrification to complete 100% \nelectrification  by  2013.  The  rural  electrification  component,  which  is  intended  to  partially  fulfil \nachievement of this target, is expected to be implemented by Bhutan Power Corporation. Most \nof the required data for the economic analysis was obtained from a comprehensive household \nsocioeconomic survey. The detailed economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix D and the \noff-grid subproject is analyzed in Supplementary Appendix L.   \n\nDemand  Forecast.  Household  demand  is  based  on  the  willingness  to  pay  and  the \n9.\ncapacity  to  pay,  values  determined  using  the  socioeconomic  survey.  The  average  monthly \nhousehold electricity consumption in the seven districts to be electrified is estimated to be about \n103 kWh. For other categories of consumers, energy demand projections used for the technical \ndesign  are  used.  For  medium-voltage  consumers,  the  capacity  projections  are  considered \nbecause of the two-part tariff. This forecast was extracted from the technical assumptions. \n\nCost. Total economic cost of installation and commissioning of all feeders in the seven \n\n10.\ndistricts is estimated to be $29.27 million inclusive of physical contingencies. \n\nBenefits. In principle, the estimation of economic benefits will be based on an estimate \n11.\nof the household demand curve for energy. Economic benefits are assumed to be equal to the \narea under the demand curve, i.e., the sum of consumer surplus, cost savings, and revenue to \nBhutan  Power  Corporation.  For  other consumers  (low-voltage  bulk  and  medium  voltage), \neconomic benefits are derived from fuel savings and revenue to Bhutan Power Corporation. \n\nEstimation  of  the  EIRR. To estimate the economic feasibility of the rural electrification \n12.\ncomponent, EIRR values were determined for feeders and districts in the targeted areas. Each \ndistrict  exhibits  EIRR  values  ranging  from  13%  to  26%,  significantly  higher  than  the  threshold \n12%  EIRR  required  by  ADB  for  funding  a  project.  The  overall  EIRR  of  the  rural  electrification \ncomponent is estimated to be 20%. \n\nPoverty Impact Analysis. Poverty impact analysis is carried out to establish the impact \n13.\nof rural electrification on poor population groups in different stakeholder categories. The share \nof the poor in net economic benefits is estimated (Table A12.2). The estimated poverty impact \nratio is 62%, implying that the poor are estimated to receive 62% of the net economic benefits.  \n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 12 \n\nItem\nNet Benefits (Nu million) \nFinancial Returns  \n(Nu million) \nProportion of Poor (%) \nBenefits to Poor\n(Nu million) \nTotal Economic Returns \n(Nu million)\n\nPoverty Impact Ratio \n( ) = negative value, Nu = ngultrum. \nSource: ADB staff estimates. \n\nTable A12.2: Poverty Impact Ratio \n(Nu million)\n\nBhutan Power \nCorporation \n(345) \n\nGovernment \nEconomy \n(88) \n\n(1,215) \n25 \n\n(390) \n\n1,110\n\n  \n25 \n\n(22) \n \n\n62% \n\n \n\n \n\nLabor\n20 \n\nConsumers\n2,738 \n\nTotal\n2,324\n\n  \n50 \n\n10 \n \n\n  \n40 \n\n(1,215)\n\n \n\n1,095 \n\n693\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n 65\n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: Green Power Development Project\n\nLending/Financing \nModality:\n\nProject\n\nDepartment/\nDivision:\n\nSouth Asia Department/ \nEnergy Division \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n\nIn  Bhutan,  most  of  the  population  (about  70%)  lives  in  rural  areas,  rural  electrification  is  therefore  a  key  issue  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  overall  development  strategy.  For  this  reason,  the  Government  is  highly  committed  to  develop  and  promote \nrural electrification projects, from which a larger part of the population is expected to benefit. Under the present 10th five-year \nplan,  at  least  25,000  households  are  expected  to  have  access  to  electricity,  raising  the  percentage  of  the  population  with \naccess to 84%. The Government now aims to increase this target to 100% for the next five years by 2013. \n\nAccess to electricity in rural areas is a key element of human development as well as economic growth. Electrification does \nnot only mean longer productive hours, it is also expected to improve health care delivery and education. Most of all, it means\na greater range of opportunities for rural people to exploit to improve their quality of life and capacity to generate income. It \nwill  also  benefit  the  living  conditions  of  women  and  children,  reducing  the  incidence  of  respiratory  diseases  and  increasing \ntheir time for more productive activities. \n\nAnother  immediate  tangible  benefit  is  the  reduced  use  of  costly  energy  sources,  i.e.,  of  kerosene  and  wood.  Rural \nelectrification provides electricity to public facilities such as health centers, schools, and other local community facilities.\n\nRural  electrification  under  the  Project  will  provide  a  stable  supply  of  electricity  as  well  as  opportunities  for  commercial \nbusiness  development  and  employment  in  extensive  rural  areas  of  Bhutan.  Benefits  from  power  export,  owing  to  the \nincreased  capacity  given  by  the  construction  of  a  new  run-of-river  generation  plant  in  Dagachhu,  will  contribute  to  the \ncountry\u2019s economic growth, providing low cost supply of electricity to customers including the most vulnerable households of \nthe poor. Regional development and use for clean and renewable energy will specifically benefit the poor beyond the country \nsince they are more adversely affected by pollution and environmental degradation. \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention\n\n1.  Key Issues\nThe Project has two major components: Dagachhu hydropower development and rural electrification. While the construction \nof a run-of-river hydro plant generally does not have direct benefits for local poor, rural electrification is expected to improve \nquality of life and bring new economic opportunities in increasingly remote areas of the country. \n\nThe Dagachhu hydropower facility\u2019s benefits are related to increased economic activities (particularly in restoration and small\nretail) around the plant site, increased accessibility due to construction of access roads connected to the main roads, and use\nof 15% of the revenue generated by the plant to subsidize lifeline customer tariffs. \n\nConcerning the rural electrification component, the socioeconomic impacts of electrification will be very positive in nature and\nconsiderable  in  scale.  These  include  the  beneficial  impacts  accrued  from  (i)  improved  lighting;  (ii)  improved  education,  as \nimproved  lighting  permits  students  to  study  for  longer  hours  during  the  evening;  (iii)  improved  health  through  decrease  in \nsmoke emitted from kerosene wick-lamps leading to decreased eye and respiratory ailments; (iv) cleaner living environment \nas  smoke  emitted  from  kerosene  lamps  for  lighting  purposes  is  reduced;  (v)  promotion  of  weaving  and  other  income-\ngenerating activities during the evening leading to enhanced incomes; (vi) facilitation of undertaking household chores during \nthe evening; (vii) promotion of recreational activities in the evening such as reading, watching television, and listening to the \nradio; (viii) promotion of social visits and interaction even after dark; (ix) making it easier to prepare for, perform, and conduct \nreligious ceremonies and prayers; (x) making it easier to deal with emergencies such as illnesses and child delivery at night, \nand (xi) decreased dependence on kerosene for lighting purposes means residents do not have to walk (in many instances for \ndays) to district headquarters to purchase kerosene and saves the cost of kerosene. \n\nThe  poverty  reduction  potential  of  this  component  is  significant  since  rural  electrification  is  a  pro-poor  intervention  that \nprovides an avenue for supporting social progress by dispersing benefits of electrification widely and equitably. The impact of\nrural electrification is enormous among smaller, more remote communities, where isolation presents an additional dimension \nto combating poverty and improving quality of life. \n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 13 \n\nThe component will contribute significantly to poverty reduction and promote equitable regional development, particularly rural\ndevelopment. It will also ensure that coverage in terms of electricity provision is equitable, and will support economic growth\nand sustainable development. \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nIn 2007, Bhutan had a population of 658,888, with 345,298 males (52.4%) and 313,590 females (47.6%); 43.5% is below \n\nB.\nthe age of 20 years, 34% between 20 and 39, 15.5% between 40 and 60, and 7% above 60 years. Sixty-nine percent live in \nrural areas. \n\nBy 2007, Bhutan had 29 hospitals, 179 basic  health units, 514 dispensaries and outreach clinics, 1 Indigenous hospital, 21 \nindigenous dispensaries, and 150 doctors. In 2001, the doctor to person ratio was 1:7,476, by 2006 within a span of 5 years it \ndecreased to 1:4,312, with 90% of the population covered by health care. In 2002, 24% of women were attended to by trained \npersonnel during childbirth; by 2006 this had more than doubled reaching 57.1%. In the 1970s and 1980s life expectancy was \n47 years; about two decades later in the 2000s it has increased to 68 years. \n\nUntil the late 1950s monastic education was the only form of formal education in Bhutan; formal school-based education was \nintroduced only in the late 1950s. In 1959, the country had only 11 primary schools and enrolled a total of 440 children.a In \n1968  the  first  20  Bhutanese  completed  high  school  (class  X)  education  within  the  country.b  By  2007,  Bhutan  had  1,158 \nschools and institutions catering to 169,776 students.  \n\nIn 2004, agriculture contributed 24.7% to the total economy, i.e., as measured by gross domestic product (GDP). It was also \nthe  single  largest  sector,  providing  livelihoods  to  79%  of  the  population.c  The  contribution  of  agriculture  to  GDP  has  been \ngradually decreasing; in 2006 it accounted for 21.4% of GDP. This decline is only natural as the energy (hydropower) sector is \nexperiencing a boom and is set to overtake agriculture as the largest contributor to GDP. Nonetheless, agriculture was still the\nlargest  contributor  to  GDP  in  2006.  Agricultural  practices  have  changed  tremendously.  Until  a  decade  ago,  agriculture  was \npracticed on a subsistence basis. Now an increasing number of farms are mechanized with sizeable investment in machinery \nand other inputs that are subsidized by the Government leading to increase in export of agricultural produce. \n\nThe major source of energy has traditionally been firewood, and it still represents the major source of energy consumption. \nWith  the  commissioning  of  the  first  two  units  of  the  Chhukha  Hydropower  Project  in  1986,  and  the  other  two  units  in  1998, \nBhutan increased its electricity generation substantially and became a significant exporter of energy to India. In 2006, the total\nelectricity generated was 3,357.2 million units. The Kurichhu Hydropower Project has a generating capacity of 60 megawatts \n(MW) and Basochu 64 MW. The number of villages electrified increased from 1,210 in 2004/05 to 1,318 by December 2006. \n\nBhutan  first  opened  to  tourism  in  1974  when  only  a  handful  of  tourists  visited.  In  2001  Bhutan  received  a  total  of  6,393 \ntourists, within 5 years, by 2006, this number almost tripled with tourist arrivals totaling 17,342. \n\nIn  2001,  the  value  of  Bhutan\u2019s  exports  was  Nu4,994.75  million,  by  2006  the  value  of  exports  almost  quadrupled  to \nNu18,771.00 million. The value of imports in 2001 totaled Nu8,990.20 million and reached Nu19,011.00 million in 2006.  \n\nBoosted by earnings from Tala Hydropower Project, GDP grew at an average of more than 7% during the 9th five-year plan. \nThis  growth  was  derived  from  the  sustained  expansion  of  electricity  and  construction,  which  experienced  average  annual \ngrowth  of  around  25%  and  11.8%  respectively.  Trade  and  other  services  sectors  grew  at  an  average  of  11.5%.  Overall, \nelectricity continues to dominate the country\u2019s exports accounting for around half of the country\u2019s total export during the 9th\nFYP period. The country\u2019s per capita income is estimated to rise to $1,500 in 2006 from $835 in 2002. \n\nThe rural electrification component is an integral part of the rural electrification program under the 10th FYP (2008-2013) and\nwill  help  Bhutan  achieve  its  target.  Around  9,000  rural  households  mainly  in  seven  districts,d  including  remote  central  and \neastern regions, will be connected to the main grid. In addition, 119 solar panels will be installed to electrify public utilities in \nextremely remote areas. \n\nOf the beneficiaries, 88% farm as their main activity (mainly rice and maize); 10% raise livestock; and the remaining 2% are \nemployed  in  some  service  activity,  particularly  hospitality  (restaurants  and  small  guesthouses).  Additional  information  on \npoverty and social analysis are in Supplementary Appendix F. \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n67 \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nFor  the  Dagachhu  hydropower  component,  affected  people  were  consulted  since  September  2007  to  define  acceptable \nalignment of the access roads, and the most appropriate compensation package. All 25 affected families have opted for land-\nfor-land and chosen their preferred plot, which is currently being legally transferred to them. In addition, the affected families \nwho are losing land and crops for the construction of access roads have already been compensated for the loss of crops and \ntrees.  They  all  accepted  additional  compensation  for  the  crops  at  the  end  of  the  cropping  season  as  they  expect  a  sharp \nincrease in prices. The project authorities, along with local authorities, agree that the fairer market price will be available at the \nend of the cropping season (September) and they are willing to top up the present compensation with the necessary funds, as \nagreed with the affected people. All affected people have expressed their support for the Dagachhu hydropower component in \nview  of  the  agreements  reached  with  the  authorities.  For  the  rural  electrification  component,  public  consultations  are \nmandatory to explain to the beneficiaries\u2019 acceptance of electrification, safety awareness of electricity, and the availability of \nfree electrification kits. These activities are completed. \n\n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing\n\n  Consultation\n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No\n\n Yes\n\n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant  input,  etc.).  If  no,  explain  why.  Consultations  are  ongoing  in  a  constant  and  consistent  manner.  Given  the  small \nnumber of affected people, the approach of direct involvement in all relevant decisions seemed to be the best option and no \nspecific  plan  was  therefore  considered  necessary.  The  consultations  will  be  carried  out  during  implementation  as  per \nBhutanese  regulations.  No  plan  is  therefore  prepared  for  further  consultations  and  related  activities  are  embedded  into  the \nimplementation of the Project. \n\nC.   Gender and Development\n\n1.  Key  Issues.  While  the  Dagachhu  hydropower  development  is  basically  neutral  to  gender  issues,  rural  electrification  is \nexpected  to  make  positive  interventions  on  gender  development.  Women  in  the  rural  electrification  area  will  not  be \nconstrained by any discrimination in accessing the benefits that accrue from electrification. In fact, females will benefit more\nthan males as they remain indoors and perform household chores. The provision of electricity will not only make their chores \neasier but will improve their health condition since most of their respiratory and eye ailments are caused by the smoke emitted\nfrom  firewood  stoves  and  kerosene  wick-lamps  in  poorly  ventilated  houses.  Considering  the  status  of  women  in  the  project \nareas,  and  considering  that  the  rural  electrification  component  is  gender  neutral,  no  specific  measures  (gender  plans)  are \nneeded for differential gender requirements as  women are not specifically  disadvantaged because of economic, political, or \nsociolegal  discrimination  and  they  do  not  face  specific  barriers  to  access  and  benefits  of  electrification.  A  gender-specific \nanalysis for the rural electrification component is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n\n2.  Key  Actions.

All \nprevious schemes of \nprovision of free connection \nkits have proved to be \nunrealistic as virtually none \nof the beneficiaries has \ndecided to avail of the \nopportunity. Since free kits \nare still available at Bhutan \nPower Corporation, they \ncould be provided on the \nrequest.  \nThe Government has been \nsuccessfully carrying out \nawareness campaigns and \nfree health care to minimize \nthe spread of HIV/AIDS in \nthe country. They have \nextended the same \nprovisions (and free health \ncare) to all workers, whether \nlocal or foreign. \n\nNo indigenous people will \nbe negatively impacted.

The  run-of-river  power  plant  is \nlocated  on  the  left  side  of  the  Dagachhu  River  between  river  kilometer  (km)  10.5  and  20.2, \nupstream  of  the  Dagachhu\u2013Sunkosh  confluence.  The  river  stretch  between  the  intake  and \ntailrace outlet is about 9.7 km. The difference in riverbed elevation between the intake and outlet \nis about 296 meters (m), and the natural river gradient averages about 3%.  \n\n2. \nThe  main  components  of  the  development  are  the  weir  and  intake,  desilter,  headrace \nchannel and tunnel, surge shaft, pressure shaft, powerhouse (cavern) with two pelton turbines, \nand  transformers  for  220  kilovolt  power  transmission.  The  system  is  designed  to  convey  a \nmaximum  flow  of  50  cubic  meters/second.  The  plant  will  have  an  installed  capacity  of  114 \nmegawatts (MW). \n\nThe  development  will  require  land  for  the  construction  of  these  components.  Although \n3. \nmost  of  the  land  required  is  within  government-owned  land  some  land  required  belongs  to \nprivate  individuals.  Since  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy  applies  to  all  resettlement \neffects, irrespective of the scale of land to be acquired and regardless of the number of people \naffected,  a  resettlement  plan  is  a  mandatory  requisite  for  all  ADB-financed  projects.  This \nresettlement  plan  was  prepared  in  keeping  with  ADB  policy  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nHandbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice (1998). \n\nThe  resettlement  plan  defines  affected  persons  as  those  who  stand  to  lose  as  a \n4. \nconsequence  of  the  project,  permanently  or  temporarily,  all  or  part  of  their  physical  and \nnonphysical  assets  including  homes;  communities;  productive  and  nonproductive  lands; \nresources such as forests, community lands, or important cultural sites; commercial properties; \ntenancy; income-earning opportunities; and social and cultural networks and activities.  \n\n5. \nThe Dagachhu development is classified as having \u201cnonsignificant\u201d resettlement effects \nsince it does not involve relocation and resettlement of any households and since the number of \nhouseholds affected is only 25, and the total number of affected persons in the 25 households is \n145, which is less than 200. Moreover, the development does not affect any structures (house \nor  living  quarters,  other  physical  structure,  commercial  or  industrial  structure,  and  rented  or \noccupied  commercial  premises)  or  religious,  community,  or  cultural  sites.  Therefore,  following \nADB  guidelines,  a  full  resettlement  plan  is  not  required  since  the  resettlement  effects  are  not \nsevere enough to warrant it, and a short resettlement plan will sufficiently protect the interests of \nthe affected people.  \n\nTo minimize the effects of resettlement, as far as possible vacant government land was \n6. \nidentified for the location of project infrastructure, and the acquisition of private land was kept to \nthe essential bare minimum. Other measures to minimize resettlement effects include (i) access \nroad contractors are to avoid affecting homesteads even if this causes some realignment of the \naccess roads design; (ii) efforts were made to avoid affecting larger settlements, resulting in no \nfamilies  being  displaced;  (iii)  during  design,  extra  care  will  be  taken  to  ensure  that  religious \nstructures  and  public  property  are  avoided;  and  (iv)  stone  crushing  units  and  other  noise-\ngenerating activities will be located away from residential areas as far as possible to mitigate the \neffects  of  noise  pollution.  Similarly,  air  pollution  caused  by  dust,  will  be  alleviated  by  locating \nmachinery and equipment that cause air pollution away from residential areas. \n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 14 \n\nThe  total  amount  of  land  to  be  acquired  from  affected  people  is  27.42  acres.  Of  this, \n7. \nabout  19.99  acres  is  Kamzhing  (dry  land  including  orange  orchards)  and  7.43  acres  is \nChhuzhing  (wet  land  or  paddy  fields).  Of  the  27.42  acres,  2.61  acres  falls  under  Kana,  16.27 \nacres  falls  under  Khebisa,  and  8.54  acres  is  under  Goshi. Overall,  about  2.7%  of  the  total \npopulation of the three affected blocks (about 5,363 people) is affected by the DHP.\n\nThe  total  amount  of  standing  crops  affected  is  3.1  acres  of  paddy  and  8.16  acres  of \n\n8. \nmaize. The total number of fruit trees affected is 388 orange trees. \n\nA. \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlement Matrix \n\n9. \nThis  resettlement  plan  provides  a  review  of  Bhutan\u2019s  policy  framework  and  laws  and \nregulations  pertinent  to  the  development  and  its  effects,  including  the  identification  of  policy \ngaps  in  land  acquisition,  land  replacement,  and  cash  compensation.  It  also  provides  an \noverview of ADB\u2019s policy on resettlement and recommends measures to make Bhutan\u2019s policies \ncompliant with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n\n10. \nThe basic principles adopted in the resettlement plan are (i) involuntary resettlement and \nloss  of  land,  structures  and  other  assets,  and  incomes  will  be  avoided  and  minimized  by \nexploring all viable options; (ii) affected people will be provided with compensation for their lost \nassets, incomes, and businesses; and provided with rehabilitation measures sufficient to assist \nthem  to  improve  or  at  least  maintain  their  preproject  living  standards,  income  levels,  and \nproductive capacity; (iii) lack of legal rights to the assets lost will not bar affected persons from \nentitlement  to  such  compensation  and  rehabilitation  measures;  (iv)  replacement  of  affected \nassets  (land,  crops,  fruits,  structures)  will  be  provided  at  the  2008  rates  fixed  by  the  Property \nAssessment  and  Valuation  Agency  (PAVA).  However,  if  the  difference  between  the  rates \nadopted  by  PAVA  is  found  to  be  significantly  lower  than  current  local  market  rates,  an \nindependent assessment of current local market rates will be undertaken and this will be used \nas  a  basis  for  making  compensation;  (v)  preparation  of  resettlement  plans  and  their \nimplementation  will  be  carried  out  with  participation  and  consultation  of  affected  people;  (vi)  a \nbudget  schedule  for  resettlement  planning  and  implementation  must  be  incorporated  into  the \noverall  development,  and;  (vii)  payment  of  compensation  or  replacement  of  affected  assets \nmust be completed prior to the award of civil works contract, apart from the access roads. \n\nTo implement these principles, 16 policies were developed in the resettlement plan and \n\n11. \nwill be applied when implementing the plan.  \n\nA  detailed  section  on  entitlements  in  the  plan  covers  eligibility  and  entitlements  for \n\n12. \nvarious categories of losses. The entitlement matrix is provided in the Table A14.1. \n\n13. \nCompensation for land acquired by the development will be on a land-for-land basis as \nfar as possible. Cash compensation for land acquisition will only be made if the affected person \nconcerned  insists  even  after  being  advised  otherwise.  The  replacement  land  must  be  of \nequivalent  size  as  the  land  acquired  and  of  similar  productivity  standards  and  potential.  The \nreplacement land must, as far as possible, be within the immediate vicinity of the affected land \nor close to it to avoid causing inconveniences to the already affected person. \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n71 \n\nTable A14.1: Entitlement Matrix \n\nType of \nloss \n\nApplication \n\nCompensation \npolicy \n\nImplementation issues \n\nTemporary \nloss of \narable land \n\nArable land in \nthe project \narea\n\nCash compensation \nfor loss of net income, \ndamaged assets, \ncrops and trees at \nrates approved by \nPAVA in 2008. \n\nRestoration of land to \nformer state \n\nAffected people have been compensated \nfor their crop-loss. However, the \ncompensation for crop loss was paid \nfollowing the 1996 compensation rate \nguidelines for the time being. Affected \npeople will be paid the 2008 rates \nretroactively when the new rates are \nfinalized and released. \n\nPrice of agricultural products in the local \nmarket will be checked for comparison with \nthe new compensation rates when released \nby PAVA to ensure coherence between the \ntwo. \n\nAffected people will be provided with cash \ncompensation to restore land to its former \nstate.\nAvailable vacant government land is \nrequired. \n\nAssistance is provided to farmers to \ndevelop new crops and increase \nproduction. \n\nPrice of agricultural products in the local \nmarket have to be checked for comparison \nwith the new compensation rates that \nPAVA is expected to finalize and release in \nSeptember 2008. \nOnly private owners will be compensated \nfor trees. \n\nPermanent\nloss of \narable land \n\nArable land \nlocated in the \nproject area \n\nLoss of \nstanding \ncrops\n\nCrops located \nin the project \narea\n\nProvide equivalent \nland nearby \n\nProvide cash \ncompensation for \npreparation of \nreplacement farmland \nCompensation in \ncash for crops based \non expected harvest \n\nLoss of  fruit \ntrees\n\nFruit trees \nlocated in the \nproject area  \n\nCompensation in \ncash based on type \nand age of trees \n\nDefinition \nof entitled \npersons \nFarmers\nwho \ncultivate the \nland \n\nOwner of \nthe plot \n\nFarmers\nwho \ncultivate the \nland \n\nOwner of \nthe plot \n\nFarmers\nwho \ncultivate the \ncrop\n\nFarmers\nwho \ncultivate the \ntrees\n\n14. \nIf paddy fields are acquired and undeveloped land is provided as replacement land, then \nthe affected person is entitled to \u201cland development costs\u201d for converting the undeveloped land \ninto paddy fields. The market rate for such land development costs is estimated to be Nu60,000 \nper  acre.  This  rate  was  arrived  at  after  consulting  with  officers  of  district  offices,  the  affected \npeople in the project area, and farmers in other districts. \n\n15. \nCash  compensation  will  be  paid  for  loss  of  standing  crops  and  fruit  trees.  The \ncompensation  rates  will  be  determined  by  PAVA  (PAVA  expects  to  finalize  the  2008 \ncompensation  rates  by  September  2008),  an  agency  instituted  by  the  Government  to  set \ncompensation rates. The 2008 compensation rates are expected to be in line with current local \nmarket valuation.  \n\n16. \nSite  selection  for  replacement  land  will  be  carried  out  by  the  affected  persons \nthemselves  in  consultation  with  the  land  records  officers  of  the  Dagana  district  office  and  the \nexecutive  officers  of  the  block  offices.  This  has been  agreed  to  by  the  district  authorities.  The \naffected persons will be given the choice of choosing replacement land of their preference from \n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 14 \n\nwithin the same block (if vacant government land is available) to avoid causing encumbrances \nto  affected  people  and  to  minimize  complaints  and  grievances  about  the  replacement  land.  In \nfact many affected people have already selected and identified their replacement land. \n\nB. \n\nGrievance Redress Mechanism \n\n17. \nA two-tier grievance redress committee has been set up for the affected people who will \nhave  the  right  to  file  complaints  and/or  grievance  on  any  aspect  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  such  as  inventories,  valuation,  and  entitlements.  Any  affected  persons  who  have \nhad their land, crops, fruit trees, or structure expropriated or altered and believes that they have \nnot been compensated or assisted in compliance with their entitlements will be able to express \ntheir  grievances  through  the  two-tier  grievance  redressal  mechanism  instituted  under  the \nresettlement  plan.  Three  grassroots  redressal  committees,  gewog  grievance  redressal \ncommittees (GGRCs) have been set up (one in each of the three affected blocks [gewogs]). The \nGGRCs  comprise  members  elected  by  the  affected  people  themselves  and  selected  on  the \nbasis of who could best represent and voice their grievances. Over 90% of GGRC members are \naffected  people  themselves.  The  executive  officer  of  the  respective  block  office  will  chair  the \nGGRC.\n\n18. \nA  higher-level,  grievance  redressal  committee  has  been  set  up  at  for  the  districts \n(dzongkhags).  The  dzongkhag  grievance  redressal  committee  (DGRC)  is  chaired  by  the  chief \nexecutive  officer  of  Dagana  district.  The  DGRC  comprises  the  district  agricultural  officer(s), \nforest officer(s), land record officer(s), finance officer(s), and engineer(s) as its members. \n\nIf the grassroots grievance redress committee is unable to resolve the grievance, within \n19. \n1 week it must pass the unresolved grievance to the DGRC. If the DGRC is unable to resolve \nthe  grievance,  then  the  DGRC  must,  within  2  weeks,  refer  the  complaint  or  grievance  to  the \nNational  Land  Commission,  which  is  the  highest  body  to  approve  land  replacement  and \ncompensation allotments in the country. If the National Land Commission is unable to resolve \nthe grievances referred to it, then the affected people have the right to appeal to the courts or to \nHis  Majesty,  the  King  of  Bhutan  who  is  the  ultimate  arbitrator  in  the  country.  The  grievance \nredress procedures are summarized in Table A14.2. \n\nTable A14.2: Grievance Redress Procedure\n\nStep 1: GGRC deals with grievance within 7 days of receipt of complaint from affected person. If unresolved, \n\nStep  2: DGRC deals with grievance within  2 weeks. If unresolved the grievance is forwarded to the National Land \n\nCommission,\n\nStep 3: The National Land Commission deals with the grievance. If unresolved, \n\nStep 4: The affected person has the right to appeal to the courts or to His Majesty, the King of Bhutan. \n\nC. \n\nConsultation and Disclosure \n\n20. \nThe  resettlement  plan  was  disclosed  to  the  affected  people  and  the  public  (all \nstakeholders)  for  review  and  comments  on  the  various  mechanisms  and  entitlements  for \nimplementation  of  the  plan.  The  intention  of  this  procedure  was  to  receive  comments  from \naffected  families  in  particular  so  that  appropriate  suggestions  can  be  incorporated  in  the \nresettlement  plan  and  at  later  stages  of  implementation.  Relevant  components  of  the \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n73 \n\nresettlement  plan  were  translated  into  the  national  language  (dzongkhag)  and  placed  at  the \nblock office, office of the Dagachhu Hydro Power Corporation (DHPC), and their websites.  \n\n21. \nAn  institutional  framework  prepared  as  a  separate  section  assigns  specific  roles  and \nresponsibilities to relevant agencies and individuals to implement the resettlement plan. Various \ncommittees such as the dzongkhag resettlement committee, internal monitoring committee, and \nthe  Resettlement  Cell  within  DHPC  have  been  established.  Moreover,  the  resettlement \ncommissioner,  chief  resettlement  officer,  and  district  resettlement  officer  have  been  identified \nand  their  roles  and  responsibilities  designated.  The  main  report  provides  details  on  the \nfunctions, role, and responsibilities of individual officials and committees. \n\nD. \n\nBudget \n\n22. \nThe  budget  required  to  implement  the  resettlement  plan  is  provided  Table  A14.3. \nHowever,  the  resettlement  cost  estimate  and  budget  are  subject  to  revision  when  PAVA \nfinalizes  the  compensation  rates  for  2008,  particularly  for  standing  crop  loss  and  loss  of  fruit \ntrees. The Dagachhu development provisioned the budget as part of the cost estimate. \n\nTable A14.3: Resettlement Cost Estimates and Budget \n\nCategory \nLand acquisition \n\n \nResettlement preparation and \ncompensation\n\nAdministrative costs \n\nCost Item \n\nCompensation for land acquired will be on a \nland-for-land basis; therefore no costs are \nreflected under this category. \n \n1.

Monitoring and evaluation of implementation of the resettlement plan will be done by the \nInternal Monitoring Committee established within DHPC, and will be by external monitors (e.g., \nconsultants).  Training  workshops  were  provided  to  DHPC  and  relevant  local  government \nofficials.  The  monitoring  parameters  and  indicators  are  provided  in  the  resettlement  plan, \nincluding  the  monitoring  methodology.  The  monitoring  time  frame  and  reporting  requirements \nare also detailed. \n\n25. \nDHPC will evaluate the performance of the progress of the affected people 2 years after \nall  resettlement  activities  are  completed  and  evaluate  them  against  the  indicators  listed  in  the \nresettlement  plan.  This  will  provide  a  picture  of  whether  the  socioeconomic  situation  of  the \naffected people was better off before the DHP, or after.  \n\nCertain assurance have been made to the affected people and are incorporated in the \n26. \nresettlement plan, they are (i) the cash compensation made to affected people for loss of crops \nand fruit trees on 1 May 2008 is an interim measure aimed at alleviating their need for cash until \nthe final 2008 compensation rates are finalized and released by PAVA; all cash compensation \nfor  crops  and  fruit  loss  will  be  made  by  30  September  2008;  and  (ii)  all  land  replacement \nprocedures  will  be  completed  and  ownership  titles  (thrams)  will  be  delivered  to  the  affected \npeople by 31 December 2008. \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n 75\n\nABSTRACT OF SUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENT EXAMINATION \n\n1. \nThe Green Power Development Project is classified as Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nenvironment  category  B.  In  Bhutan,  the  National  Environment  Commission  (NEC)  is  the  apex \nbody that oversees environmental protection and issues environmental clearance mandatory for \nany projects and activities that may have adverse environmental impacts. Bhutan released the \nNational Sustainable Development Strategy of Bhutan in 2006. Other major environmental acts \ninclude Environment Assessment Act 2000, the Forest and Nature Conservation Act 1995, and \nthe Biodiversity Act of Bhutan 2003. \n\nA. \n\nDagachhu Hydropower Development \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n2. \nThe  Dagachhu  development  won\u2019t  encroach  on  any  declared  protected  areas,  or \nundermine the rich cultural heritage sites of Bhutan. Some localized impacts due to construction \nactivities could be mitigated or minimized by implementing the designed mitigation measures.  \n\n3. \nThe  physical,  biological,  and  social  impacts  identified  and  the  scope  for  mitigation  and \nenhancement  measures,  provide  obvious  reasons  from  an  environment  perspective  why  the \ndevelopment  should  not  be  implemented.  The  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  report \nprepared  by  the  Department  of  Energy  of  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs,1 and  approved  by \nNEC proposes measures to mitigate potential impacts along with measures to enhance positive \nimpacts  of  construction  and  operation  of  the  Dagachhu  hydropower  plant.  The  enhancement \nmeasures should receive equal attention as the proposed mitigation measures. \n\n4. \nPotential increases in air, water, and noise pollution due to construction activities will be \nminimized by taking proper mitigation measures and are not expected to exceed the compliance \nstandards provided in the respective 2003 NEC regulations. The river water quality is unlikely to \ndeteriorate because the water circulates relatively quickly. \n\n5. \nMitigation  measures  are  included  in  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  that \nconstitutes  an  integral  part  of  the  EIA  preparation  and  is  subject  to  implementation  by  the \nDagachhu Hydro Power Corporation (DHPC). The EMP approved by NEC covers all aspects of \nenvironmental issues in connection with the plant site and activities. The EMP is arranged for all \nthree phases: preconstruction, construction, and operation. The EMP lists possible impacts and \nproposes  adequate  mitigation  measures.  The  expected  impacts  are  similar  to  those  that  are \ncharacteristic of other medium-size hydropower developments including effects from excavated \nsoil,  worker  safety,  increase  in  air  quality  and  noise  pollution,  handling  construction  and  solid \nwaste,  electrical  fire  hazards,  and  safety  aspects  of  facility  operation  and  management.  All \nidentified  impacts  are  ranked  as  low  or  medium,  and  appropriate  mitigation  measures  are \nproposed  for  implementation  through  DHPC.  The  EMP  outlines  such  mitigation  measures  as \ntransporting  of  excess  soil  and  rocks  to  designated  dump  sites,  and  ground  leveling;  slope \nstabilization  and  revegetation  to  prevent  slides  and  soil  erosion  along  access  roads  and  river \nbanks;  appropriate  handling  of  construction  waste  and  hazardous  waste  (if  applicable)  to \ndesignated  disposal  sites;  setting  up  barriers  and  check  posts  to  prevent  poaching; \nimplementation of electric shock and fire prevention safety measures; regular water sampling to \nassure early detection of water-borne diseases; data collection of hydrological flows to assure \nflow  requirements;  water  reservoir \nimplementation  of \n\nthe  minimum  ecological  water \n\n                                                          \n1   The document was prepared under the feasibility study funded by the Government of Austria. \n\n\f76\n\nAppendix 15 \n\nmanagement  including  sampling  downstream  water  quality  to  detect  riverbed  sedimentation \nlevels;  and  proper  handling  of  transformer  oil  replacement.  All  recommended  mitigation \nmeasures  reflect  industry  best  practices  on  environmental  mitigation  actions  for  hydropower \nfacilities.  \n\n6. \nSpecific  issues  addressed  in  the  preconstruction  phase  include  (i)  environmental \nclearance,  that  is  mandatory  to  obtain  as  per  the  Environment  Assessment  Act  2000  before \ninitiation of any project activities (completed); (ii) preparation of a resettlement plan (completed); \n(iii)  incorporation  of  environmental  requirements  in  project  design  particularly  inclusion  into \ncontract clauses; and (iv) monitoring of implementation of the EMP and resettlement plan. \n\n7. \nEMP-specific  issues  for  the  construction  phase  include  the  following  (i)  setting  up  an \nenvironmental  management  unit  within  DHPC  (completed);  (ii)  coordination  with  the  project \nengineering  unit  to  incorporate  environmental  concerns  into  civil  works  contracts;  (iii) \nenvironmental  capacity  building  including  contractor\u2019s  engineer;  (iv)  monitoring  of  civil  works \nexecution;  (v)  monitoring  of  wildlife  indicators;  (vi)  monitoring  of  social  indicators;  and  (vii) \nreporting and mitigation measures rectifications. \n\nissues \n\nParticular \n\n8. \nthe \nimplementation  of  monitoring  and  mitigating  activities  including  downstream  flow  variations, \nreservoir  management,  downstream  water  quality  management,  and  insect  vector  disease \nmanagement. \n\nto  be  addressed  during  post  construction  are  basically \n\n9. \nThe  Government-approved  EIA  report  recommends  a  minimum  flow  (ecological  flow) \nrelease  from  the  dam  1.4  cubic  meters  per  second  (roughly  in  the  range  of  5%\u201310%  of  the \nmean annual natural flow) to support animal life, in particular fish migration from March to April \n(to  spawning  site)  and  from  September  to  October  (return  to  lower  altitude  for  warm  water). \nHowever, because only limited data on baseline water quality and aquatic habitat patterns was \ncollected, DHPC will continue to conduct a separate study on collection of baseline water quality \nindicators  (for  subsequent  monitoring  during  implementation)  and  aquatic  species  migration \nroutes and spawning sites for enhancing mitigation measures through potential installation of a \nfish  ladder  (or  other  means  of  facilitating  fish  migration).2 DHPC  will  reflect  the  results  of  the \nstudy in the design and construction works.    \n\n10. \nThe  development  will  result  in  minimal  negative  social  impacts.  It  will  impact  25 \nhouseholds with part of their landholdings on the plant site or needed for construction of access \nroads (not financed by ADB). DHPC has compensated affected people as per the Land Act of \nBhutan 1979 and Land Compensation Rates 1996. In addition, DHPC agreed to pay for affected \ncrops using market rates at the end of the cropping season.  \n\nSocial  impacts  from  the  hydropower  plant  are  expected  from  the  influx  of  about  1,500 \n11. \nconstruction workers into the area during the construction, although the number of workers for \neach site is minimal. Nevertheless, subsistence agriculture has been the norm for centuries, and \nestablished  social  and  cultural  institutions  will  shape  people\u2019s  understanding.  Thus,  special \nattention  will  be  given  to  mitigate  adverse  impacts  of  the  interaction  between  existing \ncommunities and the construction work force. \n\n                                                          \n2   The environmental study will be conducted by the technical assistance consultant (the terms of reference are given \n\nin Supplementary Appendix B). \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n77 \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\n12. \nThe  Executing  Agency,  Druk  Green  Power  Corporation  (DGPC)  will  be  responsible  for \noverall  implementation  of  the  EMP.  Specifically,  DGPC  will  be  responsible  for  management, \ncoordination, and execution of all activities funded under the ADB loans. DGPC will bear overall \nresponsibility for providing regular monitoring reports to ADB as specified in the EMP. DHPC as \nthe  Implementing  Agency,  will  be  responsible  for  construction  and  operation  of  the  plant,  and \nimplementation of the EMP.  \n\n13. \nDHPC has already set up an environmental unit headed by an environmental manager \nand support staff. The unit will be responsible for day-to-day monitoring of EMP implementation \nand preparation of environmental monitoring reports as specified in the EMP. DHPC will assure \noverall  environmental  compliance  and  adherence  to  the  required  mitigation  measures  as \nspecified in the EMP. It will be responsible for reporting any changes in the project scope (e.g., \naddition  of  new  civil  works  or  changes  of  access  roads  alignments  and  the  tunnel  layout)  to \nDGPC.  DGPC  will,  in  turn,  inform  ADB  about  any  changes  proposed  to  the  agreed  scope  of \nworks. If ADB finds that the changes will have impacts on environmental safeguard compliance, \nDGPC  will  be  required  to  complete  either  initial  environmental  examinations  (for  category  B \nprojects) or a full EIA if the changed scope is categorized as an environmental category A.  \n\n3. \n\nPublic Consultations and Disclosure \n\n14. \nDHPC will acquire land for the construction of the Dagachhu plant. Although most of the \nland  required  is  government-owned  land,  some  land  will  be  required  from  private  individuals. \nThe  land  acquisition  exclusively  concerns  the  access  road  construction,  but  not  the  reservoir \nand  dam  building.  No  activities  take  place  in  environmentally  protected  areas,  and  thus  the \nconsultations  were  held  with  people  affected  due  to  access  road  construction.  The  EIA \napproved by NEC indicates that water quality and fish migration will not be affected to the extent \nthat family incomes (from fishery) or dietary habits of the local population will be altered.  \n\n4. \n\nConclusion \n\nThe  Dagachhu  hydropower  plant  will  generate  moderate  to  low  environmental  impacts \n15. \nthat can be alleviated through a set of mitigation measures proposed in the EMP. None of the \nidentified  potential  impacts  will  be  of  an  adverse  nature  requiring  additional  studies  or \ncomplementary mitigation programs (with the exception of a thorough study on baseline water \nquality  and  aquatic  species  seasonal  migration  to  be  completed  for  monitoring  purposes). \nOverall, hydropower generation as a renewable energy source will contribute significantly to the \nsocioeconomic  development  of  the  country  and  the  region,  and  improve  the  standard  of  living \nfor the population.\n\nB. \n\nRural Electrification \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n16. \nDuring the construction stage, the activities that can cause potential environmental and \nsocial  impacts  generally  include  (i)  clearance  of  the  right-of-way  where  distribution  lines  pass \nthrough  forested  areas;  and  (ii)  soil  excavation  and  line  stringing  during  the  pole  and  line \ninstallation. The operation phase is not expected to have any major negative impacts because \n(i) rural electrification schemes normally operate with routine maintenance and only occasional \nrepairs;  and  rural  electrification  infrastructure  is  inspected  and  maintained  by  Bhutan  Power \n\n\f78\n\nAppendix 15 \n\nCorporation  (BPC)  regularly,  so  that  repairs  should  be  small  in  scale.  Once  the  system  is \noperating the main risks will relate to probable occurrence of accidents harming workers during \nmaintenance or repairs to the system.   \n\n17. \n\nTo avoid or reduce environmental impacts, the mitigation designs and actions include \n\n(i) \n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii)\n\n(viii)\n\n(ix) \n\nnarrower coverage of right-of-way  to avoid branches touching the line compared \nto the standard requirement;  \nrouting of the lines along existing farm roads and footpaths to reduce the cutting \nof new trees; \ninstallation  of  covered  conductors  for  lines  near  protected  areas  and  biological \ncorridors to ensure that local habitat is not in danger of electroshocks;   \nterms of reference for all civil works to require employing manual labor under the \nguidance  of  field  environmental  officers  to  reduce  the  impacts  of  (i)  heavy \nmachinery tracking through forest areas; and (ii) cutting mature trees that have \necological value;  \nlocating  poles  on  field  boundaries  where  the  lines  cross  agricultural  areas,  to \nreduce the loss of productive land; \nmarking  the  right-of-way  boundary  and  prohibiting  workers  from  trespassing \noutside;\nlimiting  tree  cutting  to  samples  marked  as  approved  for  cutting  by  the \nDepartment of Forests; \nadequately  equipped  labor  camps  including  sanitation  facilities  and  serviced \naccommodation; and \nscreening  of  workers  for  infectious  diseases  and  providing  free  treatment  if \nnecessary.\n\n18. \nAlthough  some  of  the  distribution  line  will  run  close  to  protected  areas  and  through \nbiological corridors, all lines are aligned along the existing or planned roads and highways, and \npoles  are  placed  at  road  curbs.  The  Road  Act  of  Bhutan  (2004)  states  that  for  all  roads \nconstructed and maintained by the Department of Roads (DOR) that 15 meters on either side of \nthe motors road is DOR property, irrespective of whether such roads are constructed or passing \nthrough  protected  areas.  If  a  distribution  line  is  located  within  15  meters  of  the  roadside,  it  is \nconsidered  to  be  located  on  DOR  property  and  the  line  installation  is  not  subject  to \nenvironmental  requirements  applicable  for  works  performed  within  protected  areas  (the  Road \nAct of Bhutan, 2004).\n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\n19. \nEach  subproject  for  each  district  will  be  managed  and  implemented  within  the \ninstitutional  framework  that  already  exists  in  Bhutan  for  the  provision  of  rural  electrification \nservices.  The  Department  of  Energy  (DOE),  as  the  Executing  Agency,  is  responsible  for \nmanagement,  coordination  and  execution  of  all  activities  funded  under  the  loan.  BPC  as  the \nImplementing  Agency  is  responsible  for  construction  and  operation  of  all  subprojects. \nImplementation  will  be  managed  centrally  by  the  BPC\u2019s  Project  Implementation  Unit  where  a \nproject manager and staff have already been appointed.  \n\n20. \nBy August 2008 the national environmental clearances for all subprojects were obtained \nfrom NEC. Environmental issues have been coordinated by the BPC Environmental Unit, which \nensures  that  all  subprojects  comply  with  ADB  and  national  environmental  safeguards.  Initial \nenvironmental  examinations  and  other  documents  were  developed  for  all  subprojects  during \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n79 \n\nproject preparation to comply with ADB and the Government requirements. In the unlikely event \nthat further study is required, this will be conducted by the BPC Environmental Unit and/or by \nthe BPC-recruited environment consultants.\n\n3. \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\n21.  More  than  2,000  people  attended  26  public  consultation  meetings  organized  by  DOE, \nBPC,  and  the  consultant  in  each  of  the  districts.  Primary  stakeholders  included  residents  of \ntarget households and owners/users of facilities to be electrified; people who work on farmland \nthat is crossed by the lines; and owners and users of land that is acquired for the erection of \npoles.  Secondary  stakeholders  are  DOE,  BPC,  Department  of  Forests  as  the  custodian  of \nprotected areas and other forested land through which the lines will pass, NEC as the authority \ninstitutions;  nongovernment \ngranting  environmental \norganizations working in affected communities, and ADB. \n\nclearances,  other  government \n\n22. \nPublic meetings were organized with the objectives of disseminating information to local \ngovernment  officials  and  the  community  about  the  rural  electrification  component,  to  explain \npotential impacts and mitigation measures; and to solicit the views of the community and clarify \nany  issues  or  doubts  regarding  the  undertaking.  Prior  to  each  meeting,  the  local  government \noffices were contacted to set the date, time, and venue for the meeting.  \n\n4. \n\nConclusion\n\n23. \nThe  environmental  impacts  of  the  rural  electrification  infrastructure  proposed  by  the \nProject  were  assessed  by  initial  environmental  examinations  summarized  in  this  section  in \naccordance with  ADB\u2019s Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines\n(2003).  The  overall  conclusion  is  that  through  implementation  of  the  mitigation  measures,  no \nsignificant negative impacts will result from the location, design, construction, or operation. The \nanalysis does not include any uncertainties, and no additional studies are required to address \nfurther concerns or to comply with ADB procedures or national laws. \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 1 September 2008) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "\u2013 \n", "ngultrum (Nu) \n", "Nu1.00\n$1.00\n", "= \n= \n", "$0.023 \nNu43.95 \n", " \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS\n", "Asian Clean Energy Fund \nAsian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \nBhutan Electricity Authority \nBhutan Power Corporation \nclean development mechanism \ncapacity development technical assistance \nDruk Green Power Corporation \nDruk Holding and Investments \nDagachhu Hydro Power Corporation \nDepartment of Energy \nenvironmental impact assessment \nfinancial internal rate of return \nfive-year plan \ngross domestic product \nenvironmental impact assessment \nenvironmental management plan \ninternational competitive bidding \nInternational Development Association \ninitial environmental examination \nInternational Monetary Fund \nnational competitive bidding \nNational Environment Commission \nNational Pension and Provident Fund \nnet present value \nordinary capital resources \nOesterreichische Kontrollbank Aktiengesellschaft \n(Austrian export credit agency) \nProperty Assessment and Valuation Agency \npower purchase agreement \npublic\u2013private partnership \nRenewable Energy Division \ntechnical assistance \nTala Hydroelectric Project Authority  \nTata Power Company \nTata Power Trading Company  \nweighted average cost of capital \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ACEF \nADB \nADF \nBEA \nBPC \nCDM \nCDTA \nDGPC \nDHI \nDHPC \nDOE \nEIA \nFIRR \nFYP \nGDP \nEIA \nEMP \nICB \nIDA \nIEE \nIMF \nNCB \nNEC \nNPPF \nNPV \nOCR \nOeKB \n", "PAVA \nPPA \nPPP \nRED \nTA \nTHPA \nTPC \nTPTC \nWACC \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES\n", "GWh \nkV \nkWh \nMW \n", "gigawatt-hour \nkilovolt, 1,000 volts \nkilowatt-hour \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  megawatt \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 30 June.
