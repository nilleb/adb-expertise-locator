The proposed project will contribute to inclusive growth and \nenvironmentally  sustainable  development  in  Jiangxi  Fuzhou  by  improving  the  efficiency  and \nsustainability of urban transport. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nSustainably supporting rapid urbanization is a key development challenge for the PRC, \nwhere  300  million  people  are  expected  to  move  to  cities  by  2020.  Such  mass  migration  will \nrequire  a  major  expansion  of  second-tier  cities such  as  Jiangxi  Fuzhou  to  relieve  pressure  on \nexisting  urban  centers  and  provide  economic  opportunities  for  vast  numbers  of  low-income \npeople  now  engaged  in  agriculture.  Major  investments  in  urban  infrastructure,  transport,  and \nrelated  services  will  be  necessary  to  accommodate  development  in  second-tier  cities  and \nsupport sustainable urbanization and inclusive growth. \n \n4. \nFuzhou  is  a  prefectural  level  city  in  Jiangxi  Province.  It  has  a  total  population  of  3.8 \nmillion, of which 1.0 million is urban. The Fuzhou urban district where the project is located has \na  current  population  of  about  500,000  and  is  expected  to  grow  to  750,000  by  2020. \nEconomically,  Fuzhou  lags  behind  nearby  provinces  and  remains  relatively  poor.  In  2010,  per \ncapita disposable income was CNY14,445 ($2,275) in the urban areas and CNY5,848 ($921) in \nthe rural areas which was less than 50% of the national average. \n \nThe  new  Xiangpu  High-Speed  Railway,  now  under  construction,  will  begin  at  the \n5. \nprovincial  capital  Nanchang  and  pass  through  Fuzhou  on  the  way  to  central  Fujian  Province. \nThe  current  railway  service  consists  of  one  train  in  each  direction  per  day  and  takes  over  2 \nhours  to  travel  the  90  km  from  Fuzhou  to  Nanchang.  The  new  railway  service  will  initially  run \nabout 50 passenger trains each direction daily, offering Fuzhou a major increase in accessibility. \nWith the opening of the high-speed railway, Fuzhou will be about 30 minutes from Nanchang, \nwhich will allow the city to transform itself from a small city dependent on agriculture and related \nprocessing  into  a  suburb  of  Nanchang.  Fuzhou  will  become  better  connected  as  well  to  fast-\ngrowing  and  relatively  prosperous  cities  in  the  eastern  PRC.  The  opening  of  the  new  railway \noffers a significant opportunity to improve the economy of this region. To realize the opportunity, \nhowever, the new station in Fuzhou must be efficiently linked to existing and planned residential \nand employment areas in the city. \n \n6. \nThe  new  station  is  6  km  south  of  the  existing  city  center  and  2  km  from  the  currently \ndeveloped city area. The new station is planned to become Fuzhou\u2019s southern gateway and to \nanchor  a  new  development  area  that  will  include  a  major  business  center,  hotels,  logistics \nfacilities,  and  housing  for  nearly  100,000  people  by  2020.  Through  the  proposed  project,  the \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nstation  and  surrounding  area  will  be  linked  to  the  existing  city  with  well-designed  multimodal \ntransport infrastructure and integrated public transport services. This will reduce transport costs, \nincrease  the  efficiency  and  attractiveness  of  the  public  transport  system,  expand  travel \nopportunities  and  regional  accessibility  to  jobs  and  services,  promote  sustainable  urbanization \nand  poverty  reduction,  and  encourage  a  shift  to  modes  of  travel  with  lower  and  even  zero \nemissions. \n \n7. \nThe project aligns with Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance to the PRC under the \ncountry  partnership  strategy,  strengthening  (i) inclusive  growth  and  balanced  development  by \npromoting sustainable urbanization and (ii) resource efficiency and environmental sustainability \nby  promoting  efficient  and  sustainable  urban  transport. 2 The  focus  on  public  transport  and \nmultimodal integration directly supports ADB\u2019s sustainable transport initiative. The project aligns \nwith the priorities of the Ministry of Transport, which is promoting the development of multimodal \npassenger transport hubs under ongoing ADB policy advisory technical assistance.3 The project \nwas selected to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the impending opening of the \nnew high-speed railway and seizes an early opportunity to establish a model for urban transport \nand development integration that can be replicated in other cities. \n \n8. \nThis  project  is  ADB's  second  to  support  BRT  in  the  PRC,  following  the  Lanzhou \nSustainable  Urban  Transport  Project,  and  applies  lessons  learned  in  developing  and \nimplementing  that  project.4 The  Lanzhou  Sustainable  Urban  Transport  Project  benefitted  from \nthe  involvement  of  the  Institute  for  Transportation  and  Development  Policy,5 which  helped  to \nbuild  local  support  and  encourage  an  integrated  approach  to  BRT  design,  road  development, \nand urban planning. In Fuzhou, ADB again worked with the institute to train local officials in BRT \ndesign, implementation, and operations and to help the team prepare the BRT feasibility study. \nThe  complexity  of  BRT  system  planning,  design,  and  operations  demanded  that  the  project \ninclude  a  program  of  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  in  the  municipal  bus \ncompany and the project management office (PMO). The BRT corridor in Fuzhou will not only \nserve the new railway station area but also run through the center of the city, where passenger \ndemand is highest and bus service is slowed by heavy mixed traffic on narrow streets. As such, \nthe  project  is  expected  to  be  a  model  for  sustainable  transport  development  in  small  and \nmedium-sized cities. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe impact of the project will be an efficient, inclusive, and sustainable urban transport \nsystem in Jiangxi Fuzhou. The outcome of the project will be efficient multimodal access to the \nnew main railway station.  \n \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2012.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Lanzhou Sustainable Urban Transport Project. Manila. \n\n5  In  2011,  ADB  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding  with  the  Institute  for  Transportation  and  Development \nPolicy, a nonprofit, nongovernment organization that promotes the development and implementation of sustainable \ntransport projects, establishing a partnership to promote sustainable transport, identify demonstration projects, and \nprovide technical assistance to cities planning or implementing sustainable transport projects. \n\n\fC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project includes the following five main outputs intended to substantially improve the \n\n10. \nurban transport system in Fuzhou. \n \n11. \nOutput  1:  Bus  rapid  transit  system.  The  BRT  corridor  will  extend  12.2  km  from  the \nnorth  of  Fuzhou  through  the  central  business  district  to  the  urban  transport  hub  at  the  new \nrailway  station  (output  2).  Ten  kilometers  of  the  corridor  will  be  created  by  reconstructing  and \nreconfiguring existing roads, and the remaining 2.2 km will be new roads built under output 4. \nThe BRT corridor will have dedicated center-running bus lanes with a proposed 22 stations on \nisland platforms. The project will include the procurement of 51 BRT buses, which will constitute \nabout a quarter of the municipal bus company\u2019s fleet. \n \n12. \nOutput 2: Urban transport hub. The urban transport hub will link the BRT and regular \nbus  systems  to  the  new  railway  station.  The  hub  will  incorporate  a  station  for  BRT  and  local \nbuses  with  four  bus  bays;  BRT  ticketing  and  support  facilities;  a  bus  staging  area;  parking  for \ncars, motorcycles, and bicycles; and pedestrian walkways linking the BRT station to the railway \nstation. New bus company offices, a control center, and bus storage and maintenance facilities \nwill be constructed adjacent to the bus transfer facility. \n \nOutput  3:  Fenggang  River  greenway. The Fenggang River is a winding waterway on \n13. \nthe west side of the Fuzhou urban area. The river is now integrated into the irrigation system for \nrice  cultivation.  During  the  rainy  season,  farmland  on  both  sides  of  the  river  floods.  The  river \nruns through the new development area, past the front of the new railway station, to the old city. \nThe river must be improved to ensure that the new development area will not flood. Phase 1 of \nthe  Fenggang  River  Improvement  Project  has  already  been  completed  enabling  flood  control \nnear  the  city  center  and  providing  within  Fuzhou  recreation  areas,  parkland,  and  a  path  for \nnonmotorized  vehicles.  As  part  of  this  project,  the  Fenggang  River  improvement  will  be \nextended by 4.1 km, passing directly in front of the railway station. This output will enable flood \ncontrol and provide parks and a continuous nonmotorized transport corridor between the old city \nand the development area adjacent to the new station. \n \nOutput  4:  Station  access  roads.  The  road  component  will  develop  the  transport \n14. \nnetwork to connect the new railway station to BRT (output 1), the urban transport hub (output 2), \nthe Fenggang River greenway (output 3), and major road and bus corridors in the existing urban \narea.  The  four  road  sections  under  the  ADB-financed  project  are  urban  trunk  roads  in  the \napproved  master  plan  for  the  new  development  area.  Altogether,  10  km  of  new  roads  will  be \nconstructed and will include utilities, streetscape improvements, pedestrian enhancements, and \nlanes for nonmotorized vehicles. \n \nOutput  5:  Institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building. Capacity development \n15. \nand  institutional  strengthening  will  be  implemented  to  ensure  that  the  executing  agency  and \nimplementing agency have sufficient capacity to manage the project and that the municipal bus \ncompany  is  able  to  plan,  implement,  and  effectively  operate  the  BRT  system.  This  output  will \nhave  two  parts.  The  first  part  will  support  project  management  and  implementation  to  ensure \nthat  project  outputs  are  delivered  on  time  and  within  budget  in  accordance  with  ADB  policies \nand  procedures;  develop  and  maintain  the  project  performance  monitoring  system;  assist  with \nprocurement and disbursement; oversee detailed design; and ensure that safeguard measures \nare  implemented,  monitored,  and  reported.  The  second  part  will  build  capacity  in  traffic \nmanagement, road safety, and BRT operation and management. \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nEnvironmental  improvement.  Additional  funding  is  being  sought  from  the  Global \n16. \nEnvironment  Facility  (GEF)  to  support  measures  to  maximize  the  energy  efficiency  of  bus \noperations  on  the  BRT  and  feeder  services.  This  will  mitigate  climate  change  by  reducing \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  provide  benefits  by  improving  local  air  quality  and  reducing \npublic transport operating costs. In particular, GEF funding will support upgrading BRT buses to \nadvanced  compressed  natural  gas  technology;  scrapping  and  replacing  old,  highly  polluting \nbuses  on  local  routes;  and  training  bus  drivers  in  eco-driving  and  maintenance  staff  in \ntechniques that reduce fuel consumption. \n \nD. \n \n17. \n(Table 1). \n \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $226.46  million,  including  $100  million  from  ADB \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \nB. \nC. \n\nBase Costa \n1.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15% \nper  year;  and  such  terms  and  conditions  as  may  be  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements. 6  ADB\u2019s  loan  will  cover  civil  works,  equipment,  institutional  strengthening  and \ncapacity  building,  financing  charges  during  implementation,  and  taxes  and  duties  on  the \nexpenditures financed by ADB.7 The Fuzhou Municipal Government (FMG) will provide $126.46 \nmillion to finance civil works, resettlement, detailed design, supervision, and contingencies. \n \n\n                                                 \n6  Interest includes a maturity premium of 0.10%. This is based on the above loan terms and the government\u2019s choice \n\nof repayment option and dates. \n\n7  The  amount  of  taxes  and  duties  to  be  financed  in  the  project  has  been  determined  based  on  the  principles  that \n(i) the amount of taxes and duties financed by the ADB loan, which represents 2.6% of the project cost, does not \nrepresent  an  excessive  share  of  the  project;  (ii)  taxes  and  duties  apply  only  with  respect  to  ADB-financed \nexpenditures; and (iii) the financing of the taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the project. \n\n\fThe borrower will be the PRC. The government will make the loan proceeds available to \n19. \nthe  Jiangxi  provincial  government,  which  will  relend  the  proceeds  to  the  FMG.  The  FMG  will \ntransfer  the  loan  proceeds  and  government  counterpart  funds  to  the  Fuzhou  Investment  and \nDevelopment Company (FIDC). The FMG will assume the risk of foreign exchange and interest \nrate variation for the ADB loan. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these  terms  and \nconditions,  and  (ii)  assurance  that  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not \nmade based on any communication or advice from ADB.

The  component  for  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \nbuilding will assist and advise the FMG during detailed design and implementation. The capacity \nof  the  FMG  is  considered  adequate  to  implement  the  project\u2019s  advanced  technical  and \nsustainable  transport  aspects,  based  on  its  performance  on  past  and  ongoing  urban  transport \ndevelopment projects.9 \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n23. \nThe project is economically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return of \n14.0%  and  net  present  value  of  CNY132.69  million  at  a  12.0%  discount  rate.  The  estimate \ncovered the three transportation-related outputs for which quantitative economic benefits could \nbe  estimated  (excluding  the  Fenggang  River  greenway  and  institutional  strengthening  and \ncapacity  building).  The  estimated  costs  include  investment  in  civil  works  and  equipment,  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement,  and  operation  and  maintenance.  The  estimated  benefits  include \nsavings in vehicle operating cost and travel time. Sensitivity analysis of potential cost overruns \nand  benefit  reductions  demonstrates  that  the  project\u2019s  economic  viability  is  robust.  Other \nbenefits  that  could  not  be  quantified  include  reduced  costs  of  flooding,  additional  land  to  be \nmade available for urban development, improved air quality, and better quality of life. \n \n24. \nThe project has both revenue-generating and nonrevenue components. The nonrevenue \ncomponents  include  road  network  improvements,  the  urban  transport  hub,  and  the  Fenggang \nRiver  greenway.  The  BRT  component  will  generate  revenue  by  collecting  bus  fares  and \nadvertising fees. The financial internal rate of return for the BRT component was estimated to \nbe 7.5% before corporate income tax and 5.2% after tax. As the financial internal rate of return \nafter  tax  is  higher  than  the  2.2%  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  the  BRT  component  is \nconsidered financially viable. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n25. \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  relevant  sections  of \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  procurement \ndocuments and contracts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment,  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  and  the  PMO.  Specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual \n(footnote 8). An assessment of financial management capacity indicates that the implementing \nand  executing  agencies  carefully  follow  PRC  policies  and  procedures  for  accounting  and \nfinancial  management.  The  implementing  agency  has  strong  accounting  and  financial \nmanagement capacity, as well as experience managing multiple large construction projects. \n \n\n                                                 \n9  Project Technical Description (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n26. \nA poverty and social assessment was conducted during project preparation. The project \nwill benefit a population of over 450,000, of which 65% is urban. Per capita income remains low \nin both rural and urban areas of Jiangxi Province. In Fuzhou, per capita gross domestic product \nis only 48% of the national average, and 6% of the people in the project area are poor\u201478% of \nthe  poor  living  in  rural  areas  and  22%  urban.  The  rural  population  increasingly  depends  on \nnonfarm  activities  for  livelihoods.  Better  economic  and  employment  opportunities,  training  to \nenhance skills, and social security programs are the main needs of the poor and vulnerable. \n \n27. \nAn integrated urban transport system will improve mobility and enhance accessibility to \nemployment for all residents. It will contribute to inclusive and balanced development, facilitate \nurbanization, and reduce income disparity. Poor and lower-income residents rely on public and \nnonmotorized transport, which will receive the majority of the project investment. The project is \ndesigned to meet the transport requirements of the rapidly growing urban areas of Fuzhou and \nwill  contribute  to  strengthening  industrial  growth  and  generating  economic  and  employment \nopportunities for the local population. Project-affected people will be provided training and skills \nenhancement programs to help them gain employment in emerging industry. Vulnerable groups \naffected by the project will receive special assistance. The project will facilitate the creation of a \nsustainable  integrated  public  transport  system  for  Fuzhou,  including  road  safety  measures.  A \nsocial  development  action  plan  has  been  prepared  to  ensure  that  local  people  are  protected \nfrom construction disturbances and health risks like HIV/AIDS. \n \n28.  Women  have  particular  transport  needs  arising  from  their  various  social  roles  and \npatterns  of  mobility.  Women\u2019s  responsibilities  often  combine  farm  work  and/or  urban \nemployment with travel to markets or taking children to and from school. Women are more likely \nthan men to have personal safety concerns when using public transport. These considerations \nhave  important  implications  for  the  physical  design  and  operation  of  public  transport  systems. \nTo  maximize  positive  gender  impacts,  the  project  is  designed  to  meet  ADB\u2019s  effective  gender \nmainstreaming categorization. A project gender action plan has been prepared with a focus on \n(i)  ensuring  women\u2019s  equitable  participation  in  public  consultation  regarding  the  project, \n(ii) incorporating gender-responsive features in the design of urban transport infrastructure that \nwill  benefit  all  vulnerable  users,  and  (iii)  promoting  increased  employment  opportunities  for \nwomen  and  building  institutional  capacity  for  gender  mainstreaming. 10 The  implementation  of \nthe gender action plan will be financed through the project budget. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n29. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  category  A  for  environment.  An  environmental  impact \nassessment was prepared and disclosed in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009).11 The  introduction  of  BRT  and  support  for  replacing  and  upgrading  of  the  current  bus \nfleet  with  compressed  natural  gas  technology  will  provide  cleaner  and  more  environmentally \nsustainable  travel  options.  The  Fenggang  River  greenway  will  reduce  the  flood  risk  while \ncreating  a  new  urban  park  and  will  encourage  a  shift  to  nonmotorized  transport.  Project \ndevelopment  will  occupy  an  area  that  is  principally  agricultural  and  residential  land,  scattered \nwoodland, and habitats along the Fenggang River. These habitats are modified and do not have \nsignificant  biodiversity  value  but  will  be  compensated  for  with  the  creation  of  habitats  and \nfeatures  of  value  for  biodiversity  in  the  design  of  the  park  and  river-improvement  works. \n\n                                                 \n10 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nFenggang  River  improvement  will  have  short-term,  localized  adverse  impacts  on  hydrology, \nwater quality, and biodiversity but is expected to offer medium- to long-term benefits by reducing \nflood risk and creating a new urban amenity. No cultural relics or historical sites are affected by \nthe project. The project will contribute to cumulative urban development effects on ambient air \nquality and noise levels, greenhouse gas emissions, and pressures on resources and services.  \n \n30. \nAn environmental management plan has been prepared and sufficient funds (3% of the \nproject cost) allocated for its implementation. This budget includes support for detailed design, \ncapacity  building,  and  independent  monitoring.  Assuming  the  effective  implementation  of \nmitigation  measures  and  monitoring  requirements  as  per  the  environment  management  plan, \nthe project is unlikely to have significant adverse environmental impacts but will offer a number \nof  benefits.  Two  rounds  of  public  consultation  and  a  community  survey  were  undertaken.  A \ngrievance-redress mechanism has been established to address any issues and complaints that \nmay arise. \n \nResettlement.  The  project  is  category  A  for  involuntary  resettlement.12 It  will  acquire \n31. \n216.57  hectares  of  land,  including  153.10  hectares  of  farmland.  Land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  will  affect  7,461  people  in  1,843  households,  including  2,450  people  in  569 \nhouseholds  affected  by  house  demolition  and  relocation.  The  project  does  not  require  any \ntemporary  acquisition  of  land.  The  project  will  significantly  affect  5,550  people  with  physical \ndisplacement or the loss of more than 10% of their land and other productive assets. \n \n32. \nThe cost of land acquisition and resettlement is CNY418.22 million, which includes land \ncompensation,  housing  relocation,  and  livelihood  support,  as  well  as  various  taxes,  fees,  and \ncontingency  funding.  The  executing  agency  has  assured  ADB  that  adequate  counterpart \nfunding  will  be  made  available  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  in  line  with  the  annual \nfunding  requirements  stipulated  in  the  resettlement  plan.  Resettlement  implementation  will  be \nmonitored  both  internally  and  externally.  A  resettlement  consultant  will  be  engaged  to  aid  and \nguide the executing agency in effectively implementing the resettlement plan. The PMO's land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  unit  will  coordinate  internal  supervision  and  reporting  of  plan \nimplementation with relevant local government agencies. The executing agency will engage an \nexternal institute for semiannual monitoring and reporting. Public consultations were undertaken \nat  project  preparation  and  will  continue  throughout  the  project  cycle  as  per  the  public \nconsultation  schedule  prepared  under  the  resettlement  plan.  A  grievance-redress  mechanism \nhas been established to address affected people\u2019s concerns. \n \n33. \nthe PRC\u2019s majority ethnic group, are 99% of Jiangxi Province\u2019s population. \n \nF. \n\nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  Han  Chinese, \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n34. \nThe  project  is  formulated  to  minimize  potential  risk.  The  FMG  and  FIDC  have \nsuccessfully  carried  out  many  large  infrastructure  projects  and  have  substantial  experience  in \nproject  implementation  and  management  but  no  experience  with  ADB-financed  projects.  To \naddress the lack of experience with ADB procedures, training on ADB  safeguards and project \nprocurement and monitoring procedures has been provided during project preparatory technical \nassistance.13 In  addition,  an  estimated  102  person-months  of  consulting  services  will  further \n\n                                                 \n12 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 ADB.  2010.
