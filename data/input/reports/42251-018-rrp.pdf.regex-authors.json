I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Skills Sector Enhancement Program \n(SSEP).1 \n \n2.  The SSEP will support the government\u2019s Skills Sector Development Program (SSDP), \n2014\u20132020, which aims at building an efficient skills development system to meet labor market \ndemand. The SSDP is the first sector-wide, medium-term development program, incorporating \nseveral ministries\u2019 training efforts. The SSEP will reorient the technical and vocational education \nand training (TVET) system to focus on increasing gainful employment of the graduates, thus \ncontributing to human capital development. It builds on the long, extensive experience of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) in supporting Sri Lanka\u2019s TVET system.2  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  Sri Lanka is a middle-income country with a per capita income of $2,923 in 2012, which \naims to boost to $4,000 by 2016.3 Economic growth was impressive at an average 7.5% during \n2010\u20132012, after the end of the civil conflict in 2009. These economic achievements provide a \nsignificant opportunity to invest in human capital to set the economy on a high growth trajectory \nand avoid the middle-income trap. Sri Lanka\u2019s progress in education is remarkable compared \nwith that of other countries in South Asia. However, a significant mismatch exists between the \ncompetencies of graduates and labor market demand. Sri Lankan firms identified lack of skilled \nlabor as one of the key constraints to their business.4 Youth unemployment remains very high at \n17.3% while the overall unemployment rate is 4.0%.5 The skills mismatch has become even \nmore evident during the recent period of economic growth as both education and TVET systems \nhave not been able to adapt to the rapid labor market shifts resulting from the rise of the service \nsectors.  \n \n4.  Since 1990, Sri Lanka has developed a good basis for TVET, setting the benchmark for \nSouth Asia. Sri Lanka has an apex body, the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission \n(TVEC), to regulate the sector; and a focal ministry, the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Skills \nDevelopment (MYASD), to coordinate key TVET delivery agencies. The TVET system consists \nof over 1,100 registered public and private providers, which in 2012 enrolled around 148,000 \nstudents across 27 vocational subjects.6 Sri Lanka has a TVET teacher development university, \nUniversity of Vocational Technology, which is unique in South Asia. The government has also \nimplemented  a  highly  successful  apprenticeship  program.  Career guidance  and  counseling \nservices are widely available throughout the school system and TVET provider network.  \n \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided a program preparatory technical assistance.

", "2 \n5.  However, the TVET system has become fragmented and outdated. In the absence of a \nsector-wide plan that is linked with national development, past government investments and \ndevelopment  partner  support  have  been  project-driven,  only  addressing  specific  issues, \nresulting in a lack of system cohesion. They also tended to focus on the supply side of the TVET \nsystem and were less successful in meeting labor market demand. Key challenges faced by the \ncurrent TVET system are (i) inadequate capacity to provide skills training opportunities for \n326,000  new  labor  market  entrants  per  year  and  a  large  backlog  of  low-skilled  in-service \nworkers,  (ii)  lack  of  middle-level  skills  training  programs  for  technicians,  (iii)  low  market \nresponsiveness and relevance indicated by a 50% TVET graduate employment rate, (iv) limited \nrange of training programs and lack of flexible delivery options, (v) a narrowly defined and \noutdated national vocational qualification framework that neither provides multiple pathways nor \ncovers higher level skills relevant to industry, (vi) lack of qualified instructors, and (vii) low \ncapacity of TVEC to assure system quality. At the heart of these issues is the weak sector \ncoordination  and  planning  capacity,  which  fails  to  align  the  training  efforts  and  financial \nresources with industry demand and priority economic growth areas. The role of the private \nsector  has  been  limited  in  the  largely  supply-driven  system.  Current  sector  financing  is \ninadequate to overcome the challenges.7  \n \n6.  Mahinda Chintana emphasizes the need for a major reconfiguration of skills, abilities, \nand competencies of young people to meet the demands of the global economy and support the \ncountry\u2019s  transition  to  a knowledge-based  economy  (footnote  3). In  2013,  the government \nadopted the first sector-wide, medium-term skills development program, the SSDP. It aims to \ntransform Sri Lanka\u2019s TVET into an efficient skills development system to meet rapidly evolving \nlabor  market  demand  by  2020.  It  has  the  five  strategic  thrusts  of  improving  (i) quality; \n(ii) relevance; (iii) access; (iv) recognition for vocational training; and (v) supportive policies, \nsystems, and structures. Building on past investments in \u201ctraining assets\u201d, the SSDP will focus \non investment in \u201cquality\u201d to make the TVET system better serve skill demands for the next \ndecades.8 \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n7.  ADB has supported Sri Lanka\u2019s TVET sector since 1982 through a series of investment \nprojects. As a lead development partner of TVET in Sri Lanka, ADB\u2019s assistance has been \ninstrumental  in  SSDP formulation.  Several  recommendations from the Technical  Education \nDevelopment Project, 2006\u20132011 completion report are incorporated in the SSDP design.9 \nSupporting  the  SSDP,  the  proposed  SSEP  will  contribute  to  the  government\u2019s  integrated \napproach  to  human  capital  development  alongside  the  Education  Sector  Development \nFramework  and  Program,  which  is  supported  by  ADB\u2019s  Education  Sector  Development \nProgram.10 The SSEP is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 and \nis included in the Sri Lanka country operations business plan, 2013\u20132015. \n                                                \n7  Summary Sector Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n8  Government of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Finance and Planning.

The \nrecommendations  include  (i)  fundamental  institutional  reform,  (ii)  rationalization  of  teacher  recruitment  and \ncompensation, (iii) more autonomy to college heads, (iv) improvement of the management information system and \nlabor market information system, (v) gender and social equity, and (vi) rationalization of training facilities.  \n10 ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Results-Based \nLoans to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Education Sector Development Program. Manila. \nThe  Education  Sector  Development  Program  supports  the  government\u2019s  efforts  in  improving  labor  market \nrelevance of secondary education by strengthening science, technology, and commerce streams. The SSDP will \ncreate pathways for the secondary school leavers and graduates to transit to gainful employment.  \n ", "3 \n8.  ADB\u2019s results-based lending (RBL) is the most suitable modality primarily because the \nSSDP aims at a fundamental shift in sector orientation\u2014from the traditional, input-driven model \nto \u201cemployment results.\u201d The SSDP envisages sector-wide reforms involving several institutions \nto improve the TVET system as a whole and in a sustainable manner, rather than focusing on \nspecific aspects or on one or two institutions only, which was the case in previous investment \nprojects. Such sector-wide reforms would be better achieved through stronger accountability for \nresults than by focusing only on transactions. RBL also uses and strengthens country systems \nand  institutional  capacity,  which  are  key  to  building  a  market-responsive,  dynamic  TVET \nsystem.  ADB\u2019s  due  diligence  assessments  provide  reasonable  assurance  for  effective \nachievement of results through RBL, with measures to strengthen the country systems.  \n \n9.  The RBL approach will enhance the predictability and amount of sector financing by \nmotivating  the  government  to  adopt  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework  whereby  other \ndevelopment partners can participate with a harmonized approach. The World Bank will provide \nparallel financing for SSDP implementation using its results-based financing mechanism, similar \nto RBL. ADB and the World Bank coordinated due diligence assessments, harmonized key \ndisbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) to support the common results framework of the SSDP, \nand will conduct joint reviews during implementation. Other bilateral partners also expressed \nstrong support to the common sector results framework.11  \n \nC.  Program Scope \n \n10.  The SSEP will support the SSDP by covering activities from 2014 to 2016. The scopes \nof both programs are summarized in Table 1.12  \n \nTable 1: Program Scope  \nItem  SSDP  SSEP \nOutcome  An efficient skills education system to meet local and  Same as SSDP \n  foreign labor market demand \nOutputs  Improving (i) quality; (ii) relevance; (iii) access;  Same as SSDP  \n(iv) recognition for vocational training; and (v) supportive \npolicies, systems, and structures \nParticipating  Ministries and agencies for agriculture, construction,  Same as SSDPa \nministries and  economic development, education, environment, foreign \nagencies  employment promotion, higher education, industry, ports, \n  social services, and youth affairs and skills development \nExecuting agency  MYASD  Same as SSDP \nExpenditure  $961 million  $386 million \nPeriod  2014\u20132020  2014\u20132016 \nMYASD = Ministry of Youth Affairs and Skills Development, SSDP = Skills Sector Development Program, SSEP = \nSkills Sector Enhancement Program. \na  Initially, MYASD, the Department of Technical Education and Training, and six semi-autonomous institutions under \nMYASD.

DLI 7 and 9 are fully harmonized. German development cooperation through GIZ supports the whole \nprogram by providing long- and short-term technical experts, and Export-Import Bank of Korea supports output 3 \nby upgrading and rebuilding two colleges of technology for middle-level training in information technology and light \nengineering.  \n12 The SSEP will not cover high-value contracts or activities that would be classified as category A under ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n ", "4 \nD.  Program Results \n \n11.  The impact of the SSEP will be increased employability of the Sri Lankan workforce, \nparticularly the youth. The outcome will be a market-responsive and inclusive TVET system. \nThe outputs of the SSEP are selected from the SSDP\u2019s key performance indicators. Certain \noutput  targets  are  further  developed  into  annual  DLIs,  achievement  of  which  will  set  the \nprogressive steps toward SSEP outcome target achievement. Some output targets, which are \nalso important for outcome achievement but difficult to link to disbursement, are included in the \nprogram action plan (PAP).13 The employment rate of TVET graduates is included to measure \nSSEP outcome achievement (DLI 1). The outputs are summarized below:  \n \n(i)  Output 1: Improved quality of TVET provision. This output will strengthen the \nquality assurance system covering both public and private TVET providers (DLI 2, \nPAP 1.2), improve articulation of competencies within the national vocational \nqualification framework for multiple, flexible pathways (PAP 1.3), and improve \ntrainee assessment for consistency across training providers (PAP 1.4). The \ncapacity  of  TVEC  as  sector  regulator  and  quality  assurance  body  will  be \nstrengthened  to  ensure  transparency  and  reliability  of  TVET  certificates  to \nemployers  and  students.  A  comprehensive  vocational  teacher  development \npolicy and plan will ensure adequate supply of qualified instructors, assessors, \nand managers through in-service training, revised recruitment requirements, and \na performance allowance scheme (DLI 3).  \n \n(ii)  Output 2: Enhanced industry partnership for TVET planning and provision. \nThis  output  will  increase  private  sector  participation  in  TVET  planning  and \nprovision.  Skills gap  analyses for four  priority sectors  will  be  carried out for \nindustry validation to inform the sector training plans (DLI 4, PAP 1.6 and 1.8).14 \nAt least 2,000 trainees will be trained through a purchasing model, using an \nemployment-linked training agreement (DLI 5).15 At least three university colleges \nwill be established through public\u2013private partnership (DLI 5, PAP 1.5).16  \n \n(iii)  Output 3: Increased participation and improved equity in TVET. This output \nwill  increase the number of students enrolled in TVET programs to at least \n172,000 (DLI 6), and support at least 18,000 students with a stipend program \ntargeting  school  leavers,  women,  and  disadvantaged  groups  for  training  in \nemerging and critical skills gap areas (PAP 1.7). Existing workforce skills will be \nupgraded by offering flexible training delivery mechanisms and recognition of \nprior learning (PAP 1.4). People in the underserved areas will have increased \naccess to training facilities through selected implementing agencies (PAP 1.8). A \nsector-wide  gender  and  social  equity  framework  will  be  developed  to  guide \noverall SSDP implementation (PAP 6).  \n \n                                                \n13 Program Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 These include (i) construction, (ii) tourism and hospitality, (iii) information technology, and (iv) light engineering and \nmanufacturing, identified in the consultation process of ADB\u2019s project preparatory technical assistance.  \n15 Through the purchasing model, the TVET system can flexibly and quickly respond to skills gaps by using \nperformance-based contracts with a public or private provider, whichever is capable and ready to deliver the \nresults. The employment-linked training agreement with a potential employer will tie training to job placement and \ncan include cost sharing between government and employer.  \n16 MYASD will enter into a performance-based, 3-year agreement with private sector entities to develop skilled \nworkers in priority sectors. The agreement will set the roles, responsibilities of, and resources to be provided by \ngovernment and a private sector entity, with clearly set performance targets.    \n ", "5 \n(iv)  Output  4:  Improved  TVET  sector  management  to  implement  policy, \ninstitutional,  and  operational  reforms.  This  output  will  strengthen  sector \nmanagement and coordination capacity for SSDP implementation by establishing \na  high-level  interministerial  committee  and  the  Sector  Development  Division \n(SDD) in MYASD (DLI 8, PAP 1.1, 1.10). A TVET system capacity utilization \nassessment  will  reveal  underused  training  facilities  and  service  gaps,  and \ndevelop a rationalization plan (PAP 1.8). It will also pilot performance-based \nfinancing for public training providers (DLI 7). This output will also improve sector \nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) (PAP 5), planning and budgeting (DLI 9, PAP \n1.9), fiduciary capacity (DLI 8, PAP 2 and 3), and safeguards (PAP 4).  \n \n12.

TVEC  (as  the  quality  assurance  body)  and  MYASD  (as  sector  focal  ministry)  are \nresponsible for TVET sector performance monitoring. Using data from TVEC and MYASD, the \nSDD will report on the achievement of the DLIs to the Department of Project Management and \nMonitoring of the Ministry of Finance and Planning for approval and transmission to ADB. A \nrigorous  verification  protocol  has  been  established  and  includes  independent,  third-party \nverification.17 For example, the outcome DLI (employment rate) will be monitored using an \nautomated graduate tracking system to be developed by TVEC. An independent tracer study \nwill be commissioned by ADB in early 2016 to confirm the reported employment rate and the \ncredibility of the tracking system.  \n \nE.

Program financing. The government will provide $185 million (47.9%) and contribution \nfrom development partners is expected to be $201.4 million (51.1%). The government has \nrequested (i) a loan of $50 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and (ii) a loan in \nvarious currencies equivalent to SDR32,600,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help \nfinance the SSEP. The loan terms and conditions are set out in para. 30. The government may \nrequest ADB to provide additional financing upon satisfactory implementation of the SSEP, to \nbridge any financing gap from 2017 through 2020.

Disbursement arrangements. ADB loans will be disbursed over 3 years, subject to the \nachievement and verification of the agreed DLIs. The initial disbursement will be after the loan \neffectiveness and verification of achievement of prior results. Financing for prior results will be \nprovided to support government actions that are essential to initiate sector reform, such as \n(i) approval of the amendment to the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission Act to \nstrengthen the quality assurance system, (ii) signing of two memorandums of understanding \nwith private sector institutions to initiate private sector engagement in TVET provision, and \n(iii) approval of cadre positions for the SDD to strengthen sector coordination and management. \nThe subsequent disbursements will be made annually after achievement of the corresponding \nDLIs.  MYASD  will  submit  a  withdrawal  application  along  with  the  evidence  verifying  the \nachievement of the DLIs and unaudited financial statements for the period concerned. Any \namounts not disbursed for unmet DLIs will be disbursed once they have been achieved. Partial \n ", "7 \ndisbursement  is  allowed  for  DLI 9 (ii)  as  described  in  the  verification  protocol.  The  loan \nproceeds will be disbursed to the government\u2019s consolidated fund. \n \nF.  Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n17.  A PAP has been developed to complement the DLI matrix (footnote 13). It includes key \nactions in specific technical areas, fiduciary management, M&E, safeguards, and gender and \nsocial equity to ensure that achievement of key SSEP results strengthen the country systems, \nthus making the program results more sustainable. As the country systems are assessed as \nrobust at policy and regulatory levels, the PAP will focus on implementation capacity.  \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  MYASD  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  SSEP.  MYASD,  the  Department  of \nTechnical Education and Training, and six semi-autonomous institutions under MYASD are \nselected as initial implementing agencies.18 Other agencies under the SSDP will be added as \nimplementing agencies through a formal agreement with MYASD, once a fiduciary capacity \nassessment is completed and measures to mitigate risks, if any, are identified. The SSEP will \nbe implemented using the existing country systems with selective enhancements as described \nin the PAP. To boost the capacity of MYASD in coordinating and managing the TVET sector, \nthe SDD was established in 2013. It will (i) coordinate and support implementing agencies to \nplan, implement, and monitor SSDP activities; (ii) initiate implementation of new initiatives under \nthe SSDP; and (iii) undertake timely M&E and reporting of SSDP activities, including DLI and \nPAP achievements. A high-level interministerial committee consisting of key ministries in skills \ndevelopment will be established to coordinate and monitor SSDP implementation.19 The Ministry \nof Finance and Planning will ensure adequate budget appropriation and smooth fund flow.  \n \n19.  ADB will support the government in SSDP implementation through ongoing capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance.20 The assistance provides technical inputs to help the SDD \nachieve the annual DLIs and implement the PAP, complementing other development partners\u2019 \ntechnical assistance.21 It will also support independent verification of DLIs and annual fiduciary \nreviews as described in the DLI verification protocol. \n \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n20.  Several  sector  assessments  concluded  that  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  TVET  system  needs  to \n(i) improve quality and relevance to the job market at home and abroad; (ii) step up private \nsector engagement; (iii) invest in upgrading and expanding qualified instructors; (iv) introduce \nmore  flexible  approaches  to  vocational  qualification  and  training  delivery;  (v)  streamline \ninstitutional  arrangements;  (vi)  improve  performance  management  through  better  planning, \n                                                \n18 The semi-autonomous institutions are TVEC, Vocational Training Authority, National Apprenticeship and Industrial \nTraining Authority, University of Vocational Technology, National Institute of Fisheries and Nautical Engineering, \nand National Youth Services Council. \n19 Chaired by the Treasury secretary, the committee will include ministries involved in the SSDP. Two departments \n(national planning, and project management and monitoring) of the Ministry of Finance and Planning will support \nthe committee activities.  \n20 ADB.  2012.

The DLIs are carefully selected, prioritized, and \nsequenced to ensure that the government achieves reform results in the most crucial areas.  \n \n21.  The implementation planning and expenditure framework requires further strengthening \nthrough at least two to three iterations of the annual planning and budgeting exercise. The \nSSDP is the first medium-term sector development program that the government undertook, \nand it is not yet fully incorporated into the regular work program and budget. The SSDP should \nbe fully integrated into MYASD\u2019s regular work program. A technical action is included as a DLI \nto improve 5-year strategic planning, 3-year rolling budgeting, and annual work planning at \nimplementing agencies, to fully incorporate the SSDP into their regular programs over the next \nfew  years.  To  strengthen  coordination  between  budget  planning  and  expenditures  and  to \nachieve program results, performance partnership agreements between the Ministry of Finance \nand Planning and MYASD, and between MYASD and its departments and agencies, will specify \nperformance targets and related budget amounts to support implementation.  \n \n22.  A study in Sri Lanka estimated an average wage premium of 17% for TVET, which \nindicates a large income gain from TVET for individuals (footnote 4). SSDP enrollment targets, \ngraduation and employment, the average wage premium, and the SSDP expenditure framework \nwere used to compute the incremental benefits and costs. The economic analysis resulted in a \nsound internal economic rate of return of 15.3%. A sensitivity analysis revealed that varying the \nwage  premium  affects  the  return  on  investment  more  than  other  variables,  implying  that \nelevating the overall skills profile of the workforce would bring a higher return on investment.  \n \n23.  Currently, a large number of women are enrolled for training in traditionally female \noccupations, but women\u2019s participation is low in technology-related courses that would lead to \nhigher-paying  jobs.  Women\u2019s  labor  force  participation  is  the  lowest  among  South  Asian \ncountries, and the unemployment rate is high among young, educated women. The SSEP aims \nto increase women\u2019s participation in TVET and improve their employment rate, especially in the \nfour priority sectors (footnote 14). The government is committed to developing a system-wide \ngender and social equity framework and a targeted stipend program. Specific targets for women \nin employment, enrollment, stipend program, and instructor training are set in the PAP.   \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n24.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  systems.  An  M&E  system  assessment  was  done  for \nMYASD and other implementing agencies. The central system is robust, but agency level \nsystems are fragmented and inconsistent and therefore need to be consolidated. The SSEP will \nimprove and consolidate the systems for timely and efficient monitoring and reporting. The SDD \nwill be responsible for performance monitoring against a set of key performance indicators that \nare  defined  within  the  SSEP,  including  DLIs  and  PAP  targets.  An  M&E  unit  at  each \nimplementing agency will collaborate with the SDD. The SDD will develop a new, computerized \nmanagement information system for preparing quarterly and annual sector performance reports \nthat will outline progress against the SSEP targets. This new system will be housed within \nTVEC, and implementing agencies will be able to access it online.  \n                                                \n22 Government of Korea, Ministry of Strategy and Finance. 2012.

The  program  will  use  the  country  public  finance  management \nsystem and, as per the RBL policy, the strength of country systems has been assessed to \ndetermine whether additional assurances and/or institutional capacity-building measures are \nrequired.  The  assessment  reviewed  the  government\u2019s  public  finance  management  system, \nincluding  the  Auditor  General\u2019s  Department  and  specific  agencies.  The  assessment  found \nweaknesses in predictability of budget allocation and timeliness of budget release. MYASD\u2019s \nabsorption capacity, internal control, accounting and financial reporting, and external audits \nwere rated as substantial risks. Key mitigating measures included as DLIs are (i) adequate \nallocation of budget and spending of funds and (ii) strengthening of the financial management \ncapacity of MYASD, especially in planning, budgeting, internal control, and financial reporting. \nADB will conduct periodic external fiduciary reviews to spot-check sample procurements and \nreview follow-up of audit recommendations and compliance with internal controls. A detailed \nStatement of Audit Needs was agreed with the Auditor General\u2019s Department and MYASD to \nensure timely financial reporting in accordance with Sri Lankan accounting standards.  \n \n26.  A procurement system assessment was carried out using ADB\u2019s Procurement Capacity \nAssessment and Procurement Review for Effective Implementation questionnaires. Sri Lanka \nhas a functional public procurement system in line with comprehensive national procurement \nand  consultant  selection  guidelines  that  largely  follow  good  practices.  Most  implementing \nagencies have reasonable capacity for the current volume of work. Anticipating the increase in \nprocurement activities under the SSEP, procurement capacity needs to be strengthened and the \nfollowing areas need to be improved: (i) procurement planning and compliance monitoring, \n(ii) document management and retrieval systems, (iii) monitoring and tracking of contractual \nperformances, and (iv) complaints-handling mechanism. Mitigating measures are included in a \nDLI (e.g., a staffing and training plan and follow-up of annual audit findings) and the PAP. The \nGuidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities in Results-\nBased Lending for Programs were explained to and discussed with the government.23 \n \n27.  Safeguard systems. The SSEP will entail upgrading and refurbishing training centers \nand constructing some new buildings in already existing premises or on government-owned \nland,  avoiding  new  land  acquisition  and  sensitive  areas.  A  program  safeguard  system \nassessment  confirmed  the  safeguard  categorizations  for  environment  (B),  involuntary \nresettlement (C), and indigenous peoples (C) and highlighted the capacity gap in complying with \nsafeguard requirements, especially at training centers. MYASD will adopt an environmental and \nsocial  management  framework  for  the  SSEP.  MYASD  will  develop  a  detailed  screening \nchecklist and train focal officers from each implementing agency on the required procedures in \nthe framework to ensure that (i) any category A activities are excluded from the program and \n(ii) no activities involving involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples issues will be included. \nRecommendations from the assessment are in the PAP (e.g., a designated safeguard officer at \nthe SDD to provide support and monitor framework implementation).  \n \nC.  Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n \n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in Table 5.24  \n \n \n \n                                                \n23 ADB. 2013. Piloting Results-Based Lending for Programs. Manila.
