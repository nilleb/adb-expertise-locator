I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Republic of Maldives for the Information Technology Development Project.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2.  In 1999, the Government of Maldives conducted a study entitled Government Network\nof Maldives (the GNM Study) under the initiative of the Ministry of Communication, Science\nand Technology (MCST) and with the support of the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP), which resulted in a proposal for an information and communications technology (ICT)\nproject. The proposed ICT project was intended to (i) establish a wide area network linking all\nthe  government  organizations  and  the  parastatal  institutions  in  Male,  (ii)  develop  a\nfundamental  set  of  application  systems  based  on  the  Internet  to  take  advantage  of  the\ngovernment network, and (iii) foster a team of national experts in the areas of wide network\nand Worldwide Web technologies.\n3.  In 2000, the Government requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide a loan\nfor a project based on the GNM Study as a succession of the technical assistance (TA) for the\nScience and Technology Master Plan.1 A Reconnaissance Mission fielded in October 2000\nreviewed the GNM Study with the Government, and agreed to formulate an ICT project with\nthe basic features of the GNM Study, but with some extension of its scope and inclusion of\ntelecommunications  (telecoms)  sector  reform  issues.  The  Information  Technology\nDevelopment Project was included in ADB\u2019s Country Assistance Plan for the Maldives for\n2001. Subsequently, in December 2000, ADB approved project preparatory TA2 to redesign\nthe Project and to conduct a feasibility study. A Fact-Finding Mission3 visited the Maldives 16-\n26 April 2001. A Loan Appraisal Mission4 was conducted during 17-27 September 2001. This\nreport is based on the understandings reached with the Government during those missions as\nwell as on further dialogue and agreement with the Government. The project framework is in\nAppendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  The Telecommunications Sector\n1. Sector Development\n4.  Telecoms services in Maldives consist of fixed line local and long distance (including\ninternational) telephone services, cellular mobile access, telex, paging, packet switched data,\nand Internet services. All such services are provided solely by Dhiraagu, a joint venture\ncompany formed by the Government and the Cable and Wireless Corporation of the United\nKingdom in 1988. With its right of exclusivity for basic voice services renewed in 1995,\nDhiraagu\u2019s current license continues until 2009. Responsibility for regulation of Dhiraagu\u2019s\n                                                          \n1  TA 3405-MLD: Science and Technology Master Plan, for $600,000, approved on 2 March 2000.\n2  TA 3597-MLD: Information Technology Development, for $150,000, approved on 19 December 2000.\n3  The Mission comprised Dong-Soo Pyo, Senior Financial Analyst/Mission Leader and Joris Van der Ven, staff\nconsultant. The Mission was supported by TA consultants, Bill Jackson, Information Technology Engineer/Team\nLeader; Stuart MacPherson, Telecoms Sector Reform Specialist; Sobah Rasheed, Information Technology\nSpecialist; Shuaib Shah, Legal Specialist; Krishna Regaraj, Financial Specialist; Asim Ahmed, Social Impact\nSpecialist; and Mariyam Saleem, Environmental Specialist.\n4  The Mission consisted of Dong-Soo Pyo, Senior Financial Analyst; Preben Nielsen, Deputy Director, IWD; H.\nImamura, Programs Officer; Clare Wee, Senior Counsel; Joris Van der Ven, Consultant; and P. Anuradha,\nConsultant.", "2\ntelecoms activities rests with the MCST. However, no statutory legislation is currently in force\nfor regulation of the telecoms sector. A draft telecoms law was proposed, but no action was\ntaken to convert this into formal law; the legislation focused primarily on administrative issues\nand rules for radio frequency allocation.\n5.  The telecoms infrastructure and services have expanded rapidly over the last decade.\nSince 1997, the Maldives telecoms system has expanded to include the atolls of Shaviyani,\nHaa Dhaalu, and Haa Alifu in the north and has become truly a transnational system. In the\nsouth, Gaafu Alifu, Gaafu Dhaalu, Gnaviyani, and Seenu atolls5 are internally connected by a\nmicrowave trunk network and very high frequency/ultra high frequency radio links, and are\nconnected  to  Male  via  satellite;  major  earth  stations  exist  in  both  Hithadhoo  and  Male.\nUniversal access to telephone service was achieved in May 1999 (cid:190)  a substantial technical\nand social achievement. The overall quality of telecoms access and service in the Maldives\n(teledensity of 9.0)6 compares very favorably with that found in other countries in the region.\nHowever, improving practical access even further and reducing the relatively high cost of local\nand long distance telephone use, cellular mobile expense, and Internet access remain key\nconcerns.\n6.  A reasonable selection of residential and business voice services is provided. The\nmonthly rental of Rf30 ($2.3) on inhabited islands is one of the lowest in the world. The\ninstallation fee of Rf1,720 ($134) is slightly lower than the average for a comparable group of\ncountries. However, this seemingly reasonable pricing scheme applies only to a few islands\n(11 out of 200 where people live) classified by Dhiraagu as inhabited. For uninhabited islands,\nthe monthly rental is prohibitively high, from Rf3,450 ($270) for the first telephone, down to\nRf1,360 ($106) per unit for additional telephones. Installation charges range from a low of\nRf2,990 ($234) to Rf12,650 ($988). With these rates, the majority of the population cannot\nafford  telephone service. The Government is now committed to equalizing or at least adjusting\ntelephone service rates across the country through the establishment of a support scheme for\nuniversal service. The cost of a local or interisland call is almost equal to the average for a\ncomparable group of countries.\n7.  International calls are tiered, depending upon the region or country called, with rates\nvarying from Rf23 ($1.80) per minute to Rf55 ($4.30) per minute, the latter applying to all of\nthe world outside of Asia. Facsimile rates are generally 22-30 percent higher than fixed voice\ncall rates. International calling costs 7-8 times more than the average of the comparable group\nof countries. Internet services are also expensive. Establishing an Internet account costs\nRf500 ($39), with time charges of Rf0.55 ($0.04) to Rf1.15 ($0.09) per minute depending on\nthe time of the day. Forty hours of Internet access would cost Rf800 or about $63 as against\naround $25 in most developing countries. A dedicated leased line for Internet access costs\nRf7,000 ($547) for installation and Rf19,000 ($1,484) per month for commercial application\n(Rf14,000 for government, and Rf9,000 for educational institutions). These charges are much\nhigher than those in the developed part of the world, and higher than in many developing\ncountries.\n8.  Mobile services, originally introduced as analogue, were recently upgraded to digital\ncapability. There are currently 8,000 customers, and growth continues at a sound rate. Mobile\ncharges comprise a connection fee of Rf1,000 ($78) and a monthly fee of Rf150 ($12). Call\n                                                          \n5  The word \u201catoll\u201d has its origin in the Maldives. It refers to a group of islands normally consisting of a coral reef\nsurrounding a lagoon. For administrative purposes, each atoll is one of 20 administrative units of the Maldives.\n6  The teledensity is defined as the number of telephone lines per one hundred people.", "3\ncharges range from Rf2.0 ($0.16) to Rf2.5 ($0.20) per minute, depending upon the time of day.\nThe rates for air time are in the average range for the comparable group of countries.\n2. Sector Regulation\n9.  The regulatory framework in the telecoms sector shows the typical nondivision of policy\nmaking and regulation functions. The regulatory function rests with the Director General of\nPost and Telecommunications Department under MCST, who is also responsible for policy\ndevelopment and strategic planning of the telecoms sector. This vague demarcation of the two\nfunctions is made more complicated by another responsibility resting with the Director General\n(cid:190)     that  of  a  board  member  of  Dhiraagu,  the  monopoly  service  provider.  Consequently,\nvirtually all three functions (cid:190)  policy making, regulation, and operations (cid:190)  are mixed and\ninvolve the Director General. The board of Dhiraagu consists of seven members, four of whom\nare government officials (cid:190)  the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Trade and Industries,\nthe Managing Director of the Transport and Contracting Company, and the Director General.\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs holds the chairmanship of the board. Under this framework,\nindependent regulatory decisions by the Director General cannot be expected. Moreover,\nsince  the  Director  General,  as  a  board  member  of  Dhiraagu,  serves  the  benefits  of  the\noperator under the chairmanship of a senior government official, the regulatory role tends to\nbe overshadowed by other conflicting agenda, and consequently becomes weakened. This\nstructure might have been justified at its inception by the need to maintain the profitability of\nDhiraagu, and at the same time to extend service into new locations and build infrastructure\nfor new telecoms technologies; however, with this conflicting interrelationship between the\nregulator and the operator, the regulator cannot cause Dhiraagu to lower rates, which currently\npromote an excess return on capital, thus resulting in disservice to customers.\n10.  Effective telecoms access consists of both physical access to the system and the\nability to afford to use the system in an efficient manner. Currently, the telephone and Internet\nphysical access provided by Dhiraagu partly satisfies the first condition for telephone services,\nbut less so for Internet access, which is often connected at below-capacity speeds and is often\nundependable outside Male. The costs of telephone service, especially international calls and\nInternet access are almost prohibitive for economic use.\n11.  The affordability of telecoms services can be improved by promoting competition in the\nmarket and introducing an appropriate regulatory regime. Government policy foresees the\nintroduction of new Internet service providers into the Internet market as a means of improving\nthe affordability of these services. Cellular mobile service and long distance calling are both\npotentially profitable activities for private providers and could draw private sector interest. The\npresent system of intranational telephone services, however, exists as a natural monopoly,\nand it is unlikely that any private competitor would find it profitable to enter the market. An\nindependent and transparent regulatory regime, therefore, emerges as an important issue to\nensure the affordability of telecoms services.\n3. Government Network\n12.  The Science and Technology Master Plan found that several ministries were operating\nlocal area networks. Some of these were peer-to-peer networks used for file sharing, some\nprovided basic services such as email, but most organizations actually made minimal use of\nsuch  facilities.  In  some  cases,  what  had  been  described  as  the  \u201cnetwork\u201d  was  actually\nconfined to a few machines in a single room. The vast majority of workstations had no\nconnection to any other workstation in the facility. Slow dial-up connections and caps on", "4\nInternet costs imposed by many ministries discouraged access to other services and facilities\nthrough the Internet.\n13.  Application development has also been hindered because the underlying traditional\nprocesses and ministerial cultures seem fundamentally inconsistent with the nature of ICT.\nThe  paper-based  environment  that  has  evolved  over  generations  is  resistant  to  change.\nAlthough ministries are eager to gather and archive relevant information as required by their\nrespective  missions,  techniques  for  the  retrieval  and  subsequent  use  are  much  less\ndeveloped. There seems to be a strong reluctance to share information, or to rely on another\nministry\u2019s  efforts  or  information.  This  leads  to  duplication  and  errors  in  the  combined\nGovernment operations.\n14.  There is insufficient understanding of how ICT can be applied at senior levels within the\nGovernment. While all high officials have a personal computer, few use them effectively. This\ntends to be extended throughout the use of ICT. Many strive to acquire the technology without\nunderstanding that possession of technology does not equate to its effective use. Further,\ncommunication costs and the existing regulatory environment are huge disincentives to the\nexpanded use of ICT, especially for wide area application such as \u201ce-government.\u201d7\nB.  Government Sector Objectives and Plans\n1. Telecommunications Sector\n15.  Taking into account these conditions and the national development priorities of the\nMaldives, the Government has decided to move toward a more open competitive environment\nin the telecoms system. This move is reinforced by the international trend in telecoms markets\nto contestability and competition, and the World Trade Organization protocol on liberalization\nof markets for telecoms.\n16.  In this context, the Government, based on the recommendations of the Science and\nTechnology Master Plan, intends to make the policy decisions to (i) establish a new regulatory\nregime to allow for effective management of monopoly and dominant behaviors to the extent\nnecessary to facilitate an efficient transition to a contestable market for telecoms services; (ii)\nenact  new  legislation  that  will  regulate  the  telecoms  industry  in  an  independent  and\ntransparent manner, encourage competition, and inhibit anticompetitive practices; and (iii)\nliberalize the market for Internet services and possibly selected other services not covered by\ncurrent exclusivity arrangements between the Government and Dhiraagu.\n17.  To support implementation of the policy, the Government will devise action plans\nencompassing (i) reducing the charges for telecoms services, especially for Internet and\ninternational call services, including narrowing the difference in charges between Male and\nuninhabited islands; (ii) providing universal service, including expanding mobile services to the\nwhole  country;  (iii)  developing  an  independent  regulatory  body  equipped  with  financial\nautonomy; (iv) opening up markets to competition for those services for which Dhiraagu has\nno exclusivity rights; (v) minimizing any adverse impact of tariff restructuring on fiscal revenue\nby pursuing expansion of the revenue base; (vi) improving telecoms facilities and upgrading\ntelecoms services as a way of attracting foreign investors, including obtaining access to global\nsubmarine cables; and (vii) ultimately transforming the Maldives into an ICT society.\n                                                          \n7 E-government refers to the use by government agencies of information technologies that have the ability to\ntransform relations with citizens, businesses, and other arms of Government.", "5\n2. Public Sector Management\n18.  Good governance is one of the key development objectives highlighted by the Sixth\nNational Development Plan (2001-2005). The establishment of a modern public administration\nis emphasized as a priority goal in the Government\u2019s development agenda. Capacity building\nand the upgrading of human resources to fill skills gaps have been recognized as critical\nrequirements toward good governance to achieve improved performance of public sector\nmanagement.  The  Sixth  Plan  also  emphasizes  regional  development  through  promoting\nequitable access to social services and economic infrastructure, which is one of the major\nthrusts pursued by the Project through establishing a government network and providing the\npublic with better access to it.\n19.  As a way of improving the efficiency and transparency of public sector management,\nthe  Government  plans  to  develop  a  common  data  communication  network  between  the\nministries and other parastatal agencies. The government network will be a facility designed to\nsupport communications through virtual networks within ministries, to support the exchange of\ninformation between ministries, and to provide a secure gateway between the Government\nand the Internet. The network will comprise two separate components: a metropolitan network\nserving ministry offices located within Male, and a wide area regional network extending from\nMale to serve the atoll capitals and eventually island administration offices.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n20.  ADB provided TA for the Science and Technology Master Plan (footnote 1) in 2000. As\npart of that TA, a master plan for telecoms and ICT sector development in the Maldives was\nprepared. In 1999, UNDP sponsored the GNM Study, which triggered ADB\u2019s involvement in\nthe  sector.  With  the  increasing  importance  of  ICT  for  economic  growth  and  governance\nimprovement,  however,  many  aid  agencies  look  to  the  benefits  of  rationalization  of  the\ntelecoms, and ICT sector in Maldives. The International Telecommunications Union assisted\nwith  preparation  of  the  telecoms  sector  policy,  which  provided  a  basis  for  the  Maldives\nTelecommunication  Policy  approved  by  the  Government  on  1  August  2001.  UNDP  is\nconsidering a support program to conduct a study for promoting competition in the Internet\nservice market.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n21.  Over recent years, a number of studies have concerned for sector policy issues such\nas telecoms policy review, telecoms legislation, and telecoms tariff strategy not only through\nexternal assistance but also through the Government\u2019s initiatives. Despite a number of well\nthought-out recommendations by those studies to rationalize the telecoms market, few actions\nhave  been  taken  so  far.  ADB\u2019s  intervention  in  the  sector  is  therefore  focused  on\nimplementation of sector reform measures already identified.\n22.  Because of few past interventions in investment, there is a limited base from which to\ndraw lessons for ADB\u2019s future intervention. However, a useful lesson can be drawn from the\npartial privatization of Dhiraagu carried out by forming a strategic alliance with a foreign\noperator.  The  strategic  alliance  enabled  efficiency  gains  in  its  operation  by  adopting  the\nadvanced managerial and operational skills of its strategic partner. However, efficiency gains\nhave not been translated into benefits to the consumer, as can be seen from the prohibitively\nhigh tariffs of cellular mobile service, Internet service, or long distance service. It is apparent\nthat efficiency gains rarely spill over to the consumer unless either the market monopoly is\nbroken down by opening up the market to competition, or the market is properly regulated by a", "6\nregulator with appropriate authority. The lesson is that breaking up of a monopolized market\nand establishment of an independent regulator are more important for the benefit of the\nconsumer than mere privatization of state-owned companies.\nE.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n23.  ADB\u2019s  strategic  development  objectives  in  the  Maldives  focus  on  (i)  regional\ndevelopment including the provision of basic infrastructure and capacity building; (ii) creating\nan enabling environment for private sector development, including reform of the financial\nsector and the legal system; and (iii) developing an information and communication network in\nthe atolls. To support good governance, ADB will (i) develop improved information access and\npublic sector connectivity and build the capacity of key public institutions with the aim of\nimproving public sector management efficiency; and (ii) assist the Government to assume\nmore  of  an  enabling  stance  with  respect  to  the  private  sector  and  to  prepare  eventual\ngraduation from least developed country status. The Project, aiming at providing better access\nto government information and services and improving the efficiency and transparency of\npublic sector management, will be fully in line with ADB\u2019s development strategy.\n24.  ADB\u2019s strategy for the telecoms sector is to establish a national telecoms sector policy\nthat will spell out the principles for a sector regulatory regime and for restructuring of the\ntelecoms market. For the sector regulatory regime, the ultimate goal ADB is pursuing is the\nestablishment of an independent regulatory body, the function of which is separated from\npolicy making and service provision. The independent regulatory body should be mandated to\n(i) set technical standards; (ii) license carriers; (iii) regulate carriers\u2019 tariffs; (iv) monitor quality\nof service and initiate corrective actions, if necessary; (v) approve programs for construction\nand  capital  investment;  (vi)  set  financial,  administrative,  and  technical  terms  for\ninterconnection;  (vii)  control  the  type-approval  of  customer  premise  equipment  and  its\nconnection to the public network; and (viii) consider complaints from users and take corrective\naction, if necessary.\n25.  Restructuring of the telecoms market is concerned with opening it up to competition,\nand privatization of state-owned operators. ADB\u2019s strategy for market restructuring is to follow\nthe steps of (i) incorporating the dominant state-owned operator; (ii) liberalizing value-added\nand other nonbasic services; (iii) sale of a minority share in the dominant state-owned operator\nwith exclusivity in fixed voice services for a limited period of time; (iv) sale of the majority of\nshares; (v) removal of exclusivity and opening all services to competition; and (vi) sale of all\nshares, retaining only a symbolic quantity. A sector reform package can be tailored, taking into\naccount the existing regulatory framework and the extent of market restructuring.\n26.  This  sector  strategy  can  be  reinforced  by  encouraging  appropriate  legislation  to\nimplement the telecoms sector policy. ADB\u2019s intervention in the telecoms sector will, therefore,\naddress passage of telecoms laws that will support telecoms sector reform.\n27.  ICT is widely recognized as a potential powerful tool in the fight against world poverty,\nwith the capacity to provide developing countries with an unprecedented opportunity to meet\nvital  development  goals  such  as  poverty  reduction,  basic  health  care,  and  education.\nCountries  that  succeed  in  harnessing  the  potential  of  ICT  can  look  forward  to  greatly\naccelerating  economic  growth,  dramatically  improving  human  welfare,  and  fostering  good\ngovernance practices. ADB\u2019s Long-Term Strategic Framework recognized the importance of\nsupporting ICT to promote development and close the gap between the information-rich and\ninformation-poor. ADB\u2019s strategy is to effectively assist developing member countries to have\nincreased access to information and to allow the less privileged in society, and the less-", "7\ndeveloped parts of the region to have wider options and a greater role in determining their\nfuture.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n1. Telecommunications Sector Policy\n28.  Since the incumbent service provider is already incorporated with a minority share\nowned by a foreign strategic partner with exclusivity in fixed voice services, the policy dialogue\nbetween ADB and the Government has been focused on (i) establishment of an independent\nregulatory  body,  (ii)  liberalization  of  value-added  and  other  nonbasic  services,  and  (iii)\nenactment of a telecoms law that supports the transparent regulatory framework and the\nliberalization of telecoms markets. On 1 August 2001, the Government approved the Maldives\nTelecommunication Policy 2001-2005 (the Telecoms Policy), which addresses all sector policy\nissues discussed and sets a time frame for critical sector reform measures. The Telecoms\nPolicy identifies six sector policy goals: (i) reducing charges for all telecoms services; (ii)\nexpanding  telecoms  services  and  narrowing  the  differences  in  cost  of  service  provision\nbetween Male and the other islands; (iii) providing necessary means and legal powers to\nstrengthen the role of the regulator through an appropriate legislative framework; (iv) opening\nthe Maldives telecoms market for competition; (v) making government revenues from the\ntelecoms sector less dependent on the profit of the sector; and (vi) making the Maldives an\nextensive user of ICT in all aspects of development, thereby setting a replicable example for\nthe South Asia region.\n2. Tariff Restructuring and Rebalancing\n29.  The large gap in telephone installation and monthly charges between Male and the\nother  islands  will  be  reduced  to  achieve  universal  service  provision.  The  gap  between\ninternational and local call charges will be narrowed by reducing the international call charges\nto destinations where there is significant traffic from the Maldives, reducing accounting rates,\nintroducing additional international telephone services, and allowing wider use of Internet\nphone service. Internet dial-up service will be provided on a virtually free basis by separating\nInternet charges from telephone usage charges and introducing flat rate usage packages\ninstead of charging per minute.\n30.  Apart  from  these  specific  tariff  restructuring  efforts,  regulatory  efforts  will  also  be\nexercised to set tariffs based on the cost of services. Service providers will be required to\nmaintain separate accounting for different services. Separating mobile service providers from\nfixed service providers and disallowing a service provider to provide both services under one\nroof will be considered to ensure clear-cut separation of accounting and to avoid cross-\nsubsidization between the two services.\n3. Regulatory Framework and Telecoms Legislation\n31.  The three functions for telecoms sector management (cid:190)  policy making, regulation, and\nservice provision (cid:190)  will be separated. The independence of the regulator will be ensured by\nallowing  financial  autonomy  of  the  regulatory  body.  To  support  the  strengthening  of  the\nregulator\u2019s role, an appropriate legislative framework will be established by enactment of a\ntelecoms law.", "8\n4. Opening Up of Telecoms Markets to Competition\n32.  Markets for those telecoms services for which the incumbent operator has no exclusive\nright will be opened to competition. The internet service and mobile telephone service markets\nwill be opened on a fixed schedule. No exclusive right will be allowed to any operator for any\ntelecoms service after the expiry of the current operating license granted to the incumbent\noperator. To facilitate competition, the regulator will be mandated to manage the national\nnumbering plan and to allocate frequency bands to licensees in a transparent manner. An\ninterconnection structure will be established to facilitate interconnection and interoperability of\ndifferent networks and services.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n33.  The population of the Maldives was around 280,000 in 2000, spread among 200\ninhabited islands. About 67,000 people or 24 percent of the population live on the capital\nisland of Male. There is an inward migration trend from the atolls to Male as people seek\nemployment and better education. Those living outside Male depend on fishing, agriculture,\nand other primary industry-related activities for their livelihood. Many families depend on\nmoney  transfers  from  family  members  employed  in  Male  or  on  tourist  resorts.  The\ndecentralization of economic activities away from Male is hampered by the lack of basic\ninfrastructure  and  the  poorly  developed  interisland  transportation  system.  With  these\ngeographical and economical characteristics, the Maldives has a huge potential to take full\nadvantage of ICT, as it allows distribution of, and access to, information at no cost difference\nregardless of different spatial distances. A majority of people living in the atolls could be\nempowered by ICT to gain access to public services at as affordable a price as enjoyed by\npeople in Male. Even people in Male could save time and effort, again thanks to ICT, by\nhaving  access  to  public  services  on-line  rather  than  over  the  counter.  Recognizing  this\npotential of ICT, the Government has put forward ICT as its prime tool to promote sustainable\neconomic growth.\n34.  ICT  has  significantly  changed  the  conventional  concept  of  interaction  between\nbusinesses and between businesses and customers. Commerce based on ICT has almost\nrevolutionized the way of doing business, making transactions between businesses far more\nefficient, and bringing customers much closer to the businesses. ICT has also caused a\nrevolutionary change in doing government work, which has brought about more efficiency,\nmore  transparency,  and  more  accountability.  Enormous  efficiency  gains  can  result  from\nnetworking government agencies, which will allow them to share and exchange information\non-line. Disclosure of government information through the Web will make government more\nopen and accountable. Delivery of government services through the Web will decrease face-\nto-face contact with government employees, which will lead to less corruption, and hence to\nenhanced governance. Particularly in the Maldives, a small island country, where the majority\nof its people are scattered throughout hundreds of islands, the benefits of e-government will be\nfar more extensive, especially compared with its networking cost.\n35.  The  benefits  expected  from  networking  government  may  not  accrue  to  the  public\nunless the public is allowed to get access to the government network at an affordable price.\nHigh tariffs for Internet service in many developing countries are attributed to policy failure that\nresults in lack of competition in the telecoms market and lack of appropriate regulation. It has\nbeen shown that countries with a highly liberalized telecoms network have costs of Internet\naccess several times lower than those with a completely closed market. Countries with more", "9\nopen telecoms sectors also have more host sites, lower monthly Internet charges, a greater\nnumber of service providers, and higher rates of Internet penetration. In the Maldives, the high\ntariffs of Internet and data transmission services are regarded as a major stumbling block for\nthe  expansion  of  Internet  penetration.  With  the  current  tariff  structure,  the  efforts  of  the\nGovernment to bring the public closer to government information and public services through\ngovernment networking will prove fruitless. Telecoms sector reform will, therefore, be an\nindispensable direction that should come along with the Government\u2019s efforts to promote ICT.\n36.  The Project is needed to encourage the Government to take advantage of ICT for its\npursuit  of  making  government  work  more  efficient,  transparent,  and  accountable,  and  of\ndelivering better public services to the public, aided by the telecoms sector reform that will\naccompany the Project.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n37.  The  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  efficiency,  transparency,  and\naccountability  of  public  sector  management,  by  networking  government  agencies  and\nproviding public services electronically.\n38.  The  Project  includes  (i)  networking  of  government  agencies  and  applications  for\ndelivery of public services, (ii) establishment of the National Computer Center (NCC), (iii)\nbuilding  of  Internet  kiosks  in  remote  atolls,  and  (iv)  provision  of  consulting  services  for\nimplementation of telecoms sector reforms.\n1.  Networking and Application\n39.  Government ministries and parasatal organizations in Male will be networked through a\nfiber  optic  cable.  The  network  will  be  partitioned  into  three  levels:  the  backbone,  the\ndistribution layer, and the access layer. The buildings housing government agencies will be\ngrouped into building clusters. Each of these building clusters will have a single point of\nconnection  to  the  backbone  network.  Larger  building  clusters  will  be  served  by  being\nconnected to a distribution network. User computers will be attached to the network at the\naccess layer. The access layer is in turn connected to the network through a node on the\nbackbone or on a distribution network. The government agencies in Viligili and Hulhule islands\nwill be connected to the Government network, and will comprise the Male network. The\nnetwork  will  be  designed  primarily  for  data  communications,  however  the  design  will\naccommodate future applications such as video teleconferencing.\n40.  Twenty outer atolls will be networked under the Project relying on carrier service\nofferings. The network can be extended to other atolls, and further to other islands within each\natoll in a phased manner in the future. Initially the network to the outer atolls will be connected\nto the atoll offices.\n41.  The  Project  will  establish  a  transactional  portal  site  for  individual  citizens  and\nbusinesses. The portal site will offer citizens and businesses a range of services from which\nthey  can  select  those  that  apply  to  their  own  circumstances.  The  services  that  can  be\naccessed through the portal will depend on the underlying progress made by government\nagencies and departments in their on-line service delivery. Through the Project, applications\nfor  national  citizen  identification;  public  health  service;  and  vessel,  aircraft,  and  vehicle\nregistration will be installed. The application for national citizen identification will be a core\ndatabase  that  will  track  an  individual\u2019s  life  data  from  birth  to  death.  A  number  of  other\napplications will branch out from this core application such as passport control, issuance and", "10\nrenewal of driver\u2019s licenses, updating of national security records, and updating of health\nrecords. The application for public health services will link a public hospital in Male into the\ngovernment network. People in outer atolls as well as in Male will be provided on-line with\ndistance medical services. The application for vessel, aircraft, and vehicle registration will\nenable owners to register or renew their property on-line, which will result in huge benefits,\nespecially to people in outer atolls. The portal will be developed to accommodate new on-line\nservices as they become available.\n42.  As part of this component, security and authentication policy and guidelines will be\ndeveloped to inspire public confidence that personal data is properly protected, and to give\nassurance that the risk of impersonation is minimized. The authentication policy and guidelines\nwill  establish  a  common  approach  to  authentication  for  government  agencies  and\ndepartments.\n2.  National Computer Center\n43.  NCC will be established to centrally coordinate ICT policies, standards, and practices\nfor government work. NCC will be mandated to (i) develop and monitor the implementation of\nframework policies, standards, and guidelines; and ensure that such policies and standards\nare adhered to; (ii) support government agencies in their development of ICT strategies; (iii)\ndevelop shared infrastructure and applications in collaboration with lead government agencies;\n(iv) promote common policies on the management of information including privacy; (v) develop\ncrosscutting services on the government network; (vi) develop extranet links with the wider\npublic sector; and (vii) coordinate action on skills for e-government. Under NCC, the Network\nOperations Unit will be established to act as the focal point for the development, operation,\nand maintenance of the government network and applications for public service delivery.\n44.  The  Project  will  provide  the  building  that  will  accommodate  NCC  and  house  the\nfacilities and equipment needed for networking of government agencies and delivering of\npublic services through the Web.\n3.  Internet Kiosks\n45.  Internet kiosks, each staffed with an assistant, will be provided to give the public better\naccess to the government network. In Male, Internet kiosks will be provided on the premises of\nNCC and in the district office in Vilingili. In the 20 outer atolls that will be connected to the\ngovernment network, Internet kiosks will be accommodated in the atoll offices. The Project will\nprovide computers, modems, furnishings, and work stations; appropriate accommodations to\nhouse the kiosks; and initial training for assistants assigned to them.\n4.  Telecoms Sector Reform\n46.  The following reform measures will be undertaken with different time frames within the\nproject implementation period: (i) restructuring of the existing regulatory body in such a way as\nto separate the policy making and regulation functions, (ii) establishment of an independent\nregulatory body, (iii) enactment of a telecoms law that supports the reform measures, (iv)\nopening up of nonbasic and value-added markets to competition, and (v) tariff restructuring for\nInternet services.\n47.  To ensure that the reform measures are implemented during the agreed upon time\nschedule, the Project will provide consulting services for (i) capacity strengthening of the\nregulatory authority, and (ii) preparation of the telecoms law. The consulting services for", "11\ncapacity strengthening of the regulatory authority will assist in setting up a telecoms policy;\ndevising a regulatory framework including mandate, functions, organizational structure, and\nfunding of the regulatory authority; preparing operational guidelines for various regulatory\nmeasures; and conducting on-the-job training for regulatory staff. The consulting services for\npreparation of the telecoms law will provide a telecoms sector legal expert to assist the\nGovernment in drafting and enacting a telecoms law.\n48.  The Project also includes assistance to the Government for consulting services for (i)\npreparation of bid documents and bid evaluation for provision of networking and applications,\nincluding conducting awareness campaigns; and (ii) external audit for project accounts.\nC.  Technical Justification\n49.  In the past, the development of ICT within the Government has been carried out ad hoc\nby individual ministries without an overall strategy to ensure that information is gathered,\nanalyzed,  processed,  and  disseminated  in  the  most  effective  manner.  Each  ministry  has\napproached ICT in isolation, and in accordance with available resources. This has led to\ninconsistent outputs that are needed by other ministries but are distrusted. This in turn results\nin duplication of effort across the information provider and consumer ministries.\n50.  The Project is designed to provide a more uniform ICT environment that will improve\nthe quality control of information; control costs, and improve government efficiencies through\nthe adoption of international standards. Government effectiveness relies on the availability of\ntimely and accurate information, and on the ability to process and use this information to\nachieve larger policy objectives. In its broadest sense, ICT provides the working environment\nand underlying mechanisms for the collection, validation, and processing of information, and\nfor the dissemination of results that can enable the Government to be both effective and\nefficient.\n51.  The Project has three primary technological considerations. The first is to create a\ncommunication  environment  through  which  information  can  be  exchanged  between\ngovernment  institutions,  and  between  the  public  and  the  Government.  The  second  is  to\nprovide the institutions with skills needed to plan for ICT development, and to manage ICT\nsystems deployed. The third is to support the development of common use applications that\nwill serve as models for other ICT development within the Government.\nD.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n52.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $12.0 million equivalent, of which $9.7 (81\npercent) is the foreign exchange cost and $2.3 million equivalent (19 percent) is the local\ncurrency cost. The estimate includes physical and price contingencies, taxes and duties, and\ninterest during construction. A summary of the overall cost estimates, by component, is in\nTable 1. Details on the project cost estimates are in Appendix 2.", "12\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nComponent Foreign Local  Total\n Exchange  Currency  Cost\nA.

It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $9.5 million from its Special Funds resources\nto finance 79 percent of the total project cost. The proposed ADB loan will have a repayment\nperiod of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and will carry an interest rate of 1.0\npercent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum  thereafter.  The\nBorrower will be the Republic of Maldives. The Borrower will make the loan available to the\nProject\u2019s Executing Agency through appropriate budgetary allocations. The Government will\nfinance the costs of $2.5 million equivalent, comprising 21 percent of the project cost. The\nfinancing plan is shown in Table 2.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource  Foreign  Local Total Percentage\nExchange Currency Cost     Share\nADB 9.3 0.2 9.5 79\nGovernment 0.4 2.1 2.5 21\nTotal 9.7 2.3 12.0 100\nE. Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Executing Agency\n54.  The Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT) will be the Executing Agency for the\nProject and will be responsible for approval and coordination of all disbursements. Selection of\nconsultants and coordination of participating ministries will be carried out through the project\nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  established  in  MCST,  the  implementing  agency.  The  executing\nagency for externally assisted projects is usually MOFT. However, implementation and the", "13\nadministrative functions will be carried out by MCST, which has, during the formulation of the\nProject, demonstrated that it is well qualified for project administration.\n2.  Project Execution\n55.  A project steering committee (PSC), chaired by MCST, has been established to direct\nthe Project and assist with interagency coordination of activities. The PSC will include high\nlevel officials from the ministries of Communication, Science and Technology; Finance and\nTreasury; and Planning and National Development; Atolls Administration; President\u2019s Office,\nand Department of External Resources. MCST, as the project implementing agency, will\nprovide secretariat services for the PSC. The PSC will meet as and when required to ensure\nefficient and effective project implementation.\n56.  The PMU, established under MCST with a project director appointed by MCST, will\nhave overall operational responsibility for project management. The PMU will be responsible\nfor (i) preparing specifications for bid documents for provision of networking and applications,\ncomponents of which will include institutional development and a public awareness campaign;\n(ii) assessing the financial viability of establishing government network kiosks in selected outer\nisland in consultation with island development committees; (iii) preparing specifications for bid\ndocuments for setting up the government network kiosks; (iv) evaluating bids for government\nnetwork kiosks; and (v) supervising kiosk construction/installation.\n57.  The PMU will also monitor the social and environmental impacts of the Project during\nits implementation. The PMU will provide monthly progress reports on project implementation\nto  ADB.  An  organization  chart  showing  the  project  implementation  arrangements  is  in\nAppendix 3.\n3.  Implementation Schedule\n58.  The Project will be implemented over a period of three years commencing in January\n2002 and ending in December 2004. The detailed project implementation schedule is in\nAppendix 4.\n4.  Procurement\n59.  Procurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\nfor Procurement.  Procurement  of  networking  and  applications  will  be  carried  out  using\ninternational competitive bidding procedures. Local competitive bidding will be used for civil\nworks  for  construction  of  the  NCC  building,  estimated  at  $0.9  million.  Procurement  of\nequipment for Internet kiosks, estimated at $0.4 million, may also be carried out using local\ncompetitive bidding procedures. In both cases, local contractors and suppliers are available at\nreasonable cost, and no foreign contractor or supplier is likely to have interest in bidding\nbecause  of  the  small  amounts  of  the  packages  and  the  geographical  conditions  of  the\nMaldives. The tentative procurement packages are given in Appendix 5.\n5.  Consulting Services\n60.  Consulting services will be required for (i) preparation of bid documents, and bid\nevaluation for provision of networking and applications; (ii) institutional capacity strengthening\nfor the regulatory authority; (iii) preparation of a telecoms law; and (iv) external audit for project\naccounts. Except for external audit, all consulting services will be obtained from international\nconsulting firms in association with domestic consultants. For external audit, a domestic audit", "14\nfirm  will  be  engaged.  The  consulting  services  for  bidding  processes  will  also  include\ninstitutional  capacity  strengthening  for  government  networking  and  applications  for  public\nservice delivery, and a public awareness campaign for electronic provision of public services.\nAbout  42  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  10  person-months  of\ndomestic consulting services will be required (Appendixes 6-8 give details of consultant inputs\nand terms of reference).\n61.  International consulting firms to be engaged under the Project will be recruited in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The independent private audit\nfirm will be engaged under arrangements satisfactory to ADB.\n6.  Advance Action\n62.  ADB Management has approved advance action for recruitment of consulting services\nand procurement of supplies and civil works on the understanding that such advance action\ndoes not necessarily commit ADB to financing the Project. The PMU, under the guidance of\nthe PSC, has started shortlisting consultants for preparation of bid documents and for bid\nevaluation  for  provision  of  networking  and  applications.  ADB  has  assisted  the  PMU  by\nproviding a longlist of consultants qualified for the job.\n7.  Operation and Maintenance of Project Facilities\n63.  NCC will be responsible for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of project facilities\nfor the government network, portals, and Internet kiosk built in its premises. Other concerned\nministries will be responsible for O&M of Internet kiosks and applications for provision of\ngovernment services. The O&M costs for project facilities will be funded by the Government\nout of budgetary allocations. The Government will consider contracting out of O&M of Internet\nkiosks built in the outer islands to a private sector contractor, a community-based organization,\nor a public-private joint venture.\n8.  Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n64.  The PMU, which will have a qualified accountant, will maintain separate accounts and\nrecords for the Project. The statement of expenditure will be audited annually by independent\nauditors acceptable to ADB.8 The PMU will provide ADB with copies of the audited accounts\nand financial statements, together with the report of the auditors, not more than nine months\nafter the end of the financial year. The PMU will also provide ADB with the unaudited accounts\nand financial statements not more than three months after the end of the financial year. The\nPMU will submit monthly progress reports on project implementation to ADB. Within three\nmonths of the physical completion of the Project, the PMU will prepare a project completion\nreport on the execution and initial operation of the facilities established under the Project,\nincluding costs of establishment, operation, and compliance with loan covenants.\n9.  Disbursement\n65.  Proceeds  of  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  using  direct  payment  procedures  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook dated January 2001.\n                                                          \n8  The Auditor General will certify the project accounts. However, the annual audit of the project accounts will be\ncontracted out to a private independent audit firm funded by ADB under the Project.", "15\n10.  Project Performance Management and Evaluation\n66.  The project performance management and evaluation system comprises (i) benefit\nmonitoring and evaluation to ascertain the impact of the Project on the beneficiaries; and (ii)\nperformance monitoring and evaluation, which will measure the efficiency of the Project.\n67.  Benefit monitoring and evaluation will include data on (i) the number of interagency on-\nline accesses to agency data base, (ii) the number of on-line exchanges of interagency\nmemoranda, (iii) the number of on-line accesses of the public to the government network, (iv)\nthe number of on-line deliveries of public services, (v) the number of visitors to Internet kiosks,\n(vi) the number of public accesses to the government network through Internet kiosks, (vii)\ntariff reduction in Internet and data transmission service charges, and (viii) tariff reduction in\ntelecoms service charges for outer islands. NCC will be responsible for maintaining data and\nevaluating project benefits.\n68.  Performance monitoring and evaluation will be undertaken by the PMU in conjunction\nwith ADB review missions. They will monitor (i) the project implementation schedule, (ii)\nproject costs, (iii) delivery of project components, and (iv) O&M sustainability. This monitoring\nwill be done every six months from the start of the Project until 12 months after its end.\n11.  Midterm Review\n69.  A comprehensive review of the Project will be undertaken by the Government and ADB\nabout 12 months after loan effectiveness, or earlier if deemed necessary by the Government\nand/or ADB. The midterm review will evaluate the progress, performance, and implementation\narrangements for the Project. If any weaknesses are identified, the review will recommend\nremedial  measures  for  consideration  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  Prior  to  the  midterm\nreview, MCST will provide ADB with a midterm evaluation report on the progress of the Project\nand  any  problems  encountered  in  its  implementation.  The  result  of  the  midterm  review,\nincluding an evaluation of the progress made under the Project, will be discussed by the\nparties, and, if required, appropriate corrective measures will be formulated by the parties to\nensure successful implementation and achievement of the objectives.\nF. Environmental and Social Issues\n1.  Environmental Impacts\n70.  In the design of the Project, very few building and construction works are proposed.\nThe limited works that will be carried out are the construction of two buildings in Male and\nlaying of a fiber optic ring around Male for the Male network. NCC will be a key node on the\nMale backbone network and will consist of two separate structures (cid:190)  a five-storey office\nfacility and a three-storey adjoining structure that will house NCC. During the construction\nphase of the NCC building, there is a risk of contributing to salinization of the groundwater of\nMale, as some water needs to be pumped out for laying the foundations for a five-storey\nbuilding.  The  water  will  go  to  the  sea  as  runoff  or  by  the  storm  water  drainage,  thus\ncontributing further to the salinization of the Male groundwater, which is already in very bad\ncondition. During the construction phase of this building, there may be some disruption to the\nnormal  road  traffic,  particularly  for  people  walking  on  the  pavement.  Measures  such  as\ncontaining building materials within the building site and working during the night when traffic\nis less will be taken to minimize the disturbance. A summary initial environment examination is\nin Appendix 9. The examination concluded that an environmental impact assessment is not\nneeded.", "16\n71.  Both the above environmental impacts identified for the construction phase of the NCC\nbuilding are considered to be nonsignificant in view of the existing situation in Male and\nparticularly in isolation for this Project only.\n72.  The fiber optic cable ring to be laid around Male for the backbone layer and the\ndistribution layer of the network will have to be laid in the interlocking concrete blocks of paved\nroads. The laying of the fiber optic cable ring around Male for the backbone layer and the\ndistribution layer is not expected to encounter serious environmental consequences. However,\nto reduce any impacts, consideration will be given to using existing ducts for other utilities such\nas telephone lines or electricity cables.\n73.  There  are  two  forecast  consequences  while  laying  the  fiber  optic  cable.  One  is\ndisruption  of  traffic  and  resulting  congestion.  Mitigation  measures  for  limiting  this\ninconvenience will be taken such as careful planning and timing of the works. The other is\npossible damage to existing facilities such as water pipes, electricity cables, and sewage and\ndrainage systems. Measures to avoid any accident will be taken including careful study of the\nexisting facilities by consulting the relevant institutions.\n74.  The atoll backbone network will provide access to Government services and facilities\nfrom points of service in the atolls. No major additional physical infrastructure will be built, and\nexisting  telecommunications  infrastructure  will  be  used.  Therefore,  no  significant\nenvironmental impacts are envisaged. It is also generally noted that the information industry is\nenvironment friendly as compared with other types of industries. It is based on four of the most\nabundant, least expensive, and most widely distributed items in the world\u2013silicon, the material\nused to make microelectronic devices; lightwaves and airwaves, the communication media of\nthe future; and human brain power, the principal source of motivation in the information age.\n75.  Another  effect  forecast  is  that  the  improved  communication  system  together  with\nregional development efforts9 will limit migration from the other islands to Male and therefore\nreduce the environmental pressure on the Male area. Improved data sharing among the\ndifferent government and parastatal agencies, which is also anticipated as a major outcome of\nthe Project, will help highlight the importance of the environment in designing public sector\nmanagement policies in the Maldives.\n2.  Social Impacts\na. Impact on Community\n76.  The introduction of the Internet to island communities will be an important milestone in\nthe country\u2019s development. It will augment and complement economic growth through cost-\neffective and efficient communication and information exchange. In this way it will lay an\nimportant foundation for taking economic growth and social progress to a new phase of\ndevelopment.\n77.  The  country\u2019s  young  population  is  ideally  situated  to  take  advantage  of  the  new\nopportunities arising from such technological options, especially as computer literacy forms an\nimportant goal of the education policy framework. The country\u2019s vision for 2020 envisages the\nuniversalization of computer literacy over the next 20 years.\n                                                          \n9 Loan 1695-MLD: Regional Development Project, for $8.0 million, approved on 2 September 1999.", "17\n78.  Furthermore, the wider introduction of Internet services to remote island communities\nwill serve to break the barrier of distance, which is the single most important constraint to\nachieving balanced and sustainable national development. Currently Island Aviation Services\noperates scheduled flights to four atolls. Apart from this there is no regular transportation\nprovided by either the public or private sector. Consequently, the high cost of transportation\nimposes serious limitations on carrying out social and economic activities in the islands. The\nInternet connection will help to bridge this gap by providing a reliable means of accessing\npublic  services,  leading  to  reductions  in  transportation  costs  and  enabling  the  people  to\nparticipate more widely in national development processes.\n79.  Greater access to public services such as licencing and registration will be beneficial to\nthe community at large. It is likely to increase the overall efficiency of the island economies\nthrough reduction in the costs of business development, and the ensuing multiplier effects\nthrough greater employment and income-earning opportunities.\n80.  The availability of timely and efficient services will increase the people\u2019s confidence in\nthe public service system. People are generally less tolerant of poor service in one agency\nwhen there is good service in another. Increased expectations of the people will in turn\npositively impact on service provision by creating greater transparency and better governance.\nThis will lead to greater openness of procedures and increased efficiency of public sector\nmanagement, resulting in a virtuous cycle of better services, transparency, and accountability.\nb. Impact on Gender\n81.  Female labor force participation has declined from over 60 percent 30 years ago to\nless than half of that today. At present, women in the outer atolls are less likely than those in\nMale, the main urban center, to work outside the home. However, the liberalization of the\ntelecommunications market and the associated reduction in costs and the provision of public\nservices through the Internet is likely to create new windows of opportunity for women in the\nouter  islands.  This  will  especially  apply  to  the  younger  generation  of  women,  who  are\ncompleting their schooling and looking for employment in the modern sectors.\n82.  The overall improvement in communication services will open up the scope and arena\nof work for women. In particular it will create greater opportunities for women to work from\nhome, especially in the outer islands, where employment opportunities are otherwise limited.\nAs a result of the expanded arena of work they will be able to work on-line, linking up with job\nopportunities outside the island. As a result of the expanded scope of opportunities, they will\nhave a greater choice of employment areas.\n83.  Further, their traditional dependence and reliance on men to help them obtain public\nservices will give way to independence and self-reliance as they can directly access public\nservices without travelling to Male to obtain licenses and other requirements in order to begin\nbusiness ventures or obtain social services. This will lead to greater empowerment, self-\nconfidence, and the ability to take on leadership roles.\n84.  In this way it is highly likely that the provision of public services through the Internet,\nand the overall improvement in communications will provide greater incentives for women to\nparticipate in economic activities and enhance their social position.", "18\nc. Impact on Human Resources Development\n85.  The Project will provide opportunities for skilled employment for secondary school\ndropouts,  secondary  school  being  the  highest  level  of  education  available  in  the  islands\noutside Male. Given the increasing use of Internet services, the establishment of Internet-\nbased public services will create a positive impact on human resources development activities\nat the island level.\n86.  Further, the introduction of technology-based services will, at a broader level, create\ngreater public awareness about Internet services and, in that way lead to an increase in the\ngeneral level of knowledge about the benefits of technology, especially in providing social and\neconomic services. The proposed training under the Project will further enhance the level of\npublic education about technological solutions to address present difficulties in accessing\nservices.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Project Benefits and Beneficiaries\n87.  The benefits of the establishment of a government network are wide ranging and\ninclude  improved  efficiency,  transparency,  and  accountability  of  government  activities;\naccelerated decentralization of government work; and positive impacts on the poorer section\nof the population. Greater efficiency in government management will be achieved through the\ngovernment intranet, the applications supported under the Project, and those that will be\ndeveloped by the various departments. Greater transparency and accountability will result\nfrom  the  wider  availability  of  more  reliable  information  on  regulations,  requirements,  and\nprograms. The Government\u2019s decentralization policies will be facilitated through the linking of\nthe atoll offices into the government wide-area network.  Finally, by providing free access to\ngovernment websites in the atoll offices and in Male, the Project will benefit those for whom\nthe cost of access to government services would otherwise remain prohibitively high.\n88.  The cost of government activities can be reduced through (i) reduced cost of data\ncollection,  (ii)  faster  processing  and  availability  of  information,  (iii)  wider  availability  of\ninformation and data in a uniform format across all branches of government, (iv) reductions in\ntravel  and  paper  transmission  between  offices  and  islands,  and  (v)  more  effective\ncommunication between the various branches of government. Some benefits will be direct\nwhile others will be indirect in nature. The beneficiaries of these improvements will be all\ncitizens who will benefit from more efficient management of the nation\u2019s resources.\n89.  The  benefits  of  the  sector  reform  component  include  (i)  a  substantial  lowering  of\ntelecom rates in line with international levels, (ii) increased internal efficiency in the services of\nthe telecom operator(s), (iii) availability of a greater range of services, and (iv) better quality of\nservices. Some of these benefits are direct in nature and are more easily quantifiable, while\nother benefits are of an indirect nature. The lowering of rates combined with the qualitative\nbenefits will significantly reduce the private cost of domestic and international business and\ncommerce and hence provide a boost to economic growth. The beneficiaries of the sector\nreform will be mainly comprised of existing users. However, the lowering of rates will make\ntelecoms more affordable to large sections of the population and the business community and\nwill generate additional demand for telecoms services, in turn giving rise to economic benefits\nfrom increased economic activity.", "19\nB.  Economic Analysis\n90.  The economic analysis was carried out separately for each of the components and\nsub-components, comparing the \u201cwith-Project\u201d and \u201cwithout-Project\u201d situations based on an\neconomic life of the investment of 15 years with no residual value. Demand for the various\napplications  was  developed  using  the  findings  of  an  Internet  access  and  usage  survey.\nInvestment and annual operating costs are expressed in economic terms (excluding all taxes)\nusing mid-2001 prices and include a physical contingency where appropriate. A standard\nconversion factor of 0.9 was applied to nontraded items and labor. The overall economic\ninternal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project is 25 percent. When all the negative scenarios, as\nanalyzed for each component, are combined, the EIRR is calculated as 15 percent for the\noverall Project. Details on cost and benefit estimates and calculations are shown in Appendix\n10.\n1.  Government Network\n91.  The benefits of this component consist mainly of greater productivity of government\npersonnel through reduced cost of data collection, faster processing, and more timely and\nwider  availability  of  information;  reductions  in  travel  and  paper  transmission;  and  more\neffective communication between branches of government. All citizens of the nation will benefit\nfrom more efficient government. The improved productivity, which will translate into savings in\ngovernment employment, is the basis for the economic analysis. Indirect benefits, although\nsignificant, have not been quantified.\n92.  The critical factor for the analysis is the scale and pace at which networking will be\nadopted within government. Initial usage of the networking and growth in usage have been\nestimated taking into account the Government\u2019s policies and measures to make an effective\ntransition to a predominantly paperless mode of operation.  Past employment trends and the\nGovernment\u2019s current personnel policies aimed at redesigning government functions and job\ndescriptions and containing the growth of staff form the frame of reference for projecting total\ngovernment employment with and without the Project. The Project would lead to savings in\npersonnel of 309 staff five years after the start of the Project, growing to more than 2,960 after\n15 years. The EIRR of the investment is 19 percent. This outcome is sensitive to the rate at\nwhich the Government will be able to stabilize employment levels through attrition. However, if\nthe savings in government personnel are 25 percent less than assumed in the base case, the\nEIRR would still be 15 percent with a switching value of 0.85.\n2.  National Citizens Identification Application\n93.  This  application  will  bring  greater  efficiency  in  government  activities  by  avoiding\nduplication in the creation and updating of personal data records by the various agencies and\ndepartments that interact with the population at large. Again all the citizens of the nation will\nbenefit from the efficiencies obtained from this application. The economic evaluation is based\non  the  time  savings  of  government  departments  from  accessing  and  using  the  personal\nidentification (ID) record from the national ID register rather than creating and updating such\nrecords themselves. The critical factors for the economic analysis are the potential maximum\nuse that can be made of the application, i.e., the number of times the ID record will be\naccessed, and the initial use and rate at which the level of use will grow towards their full\npotential. The number of times the ID record will be accessed once fully implemented is\nestimated at a total of 1.4 million annually. During the first year only 50 percent of this potential\nwill  be  realized,  growing  to  100  percent  in  the  fourth  year. The  average  time  saving  is\nestimated at 15 minutes, and the hourly time cost for government employees is Rf21. On this\nbasis the EIRR is 42 percent. If it takes six years to achieve the full potential and if the time", "20\nsaving is only 10 minutes on average, the EIRR will still be 21 percent with a switching value\nof 0.85.\n3.  Hospital Information System\n94.  The main direct benefit of the introduction of ICT at the hospital is higher productivity\nthrough,  among  others,  single  patient  registration,  instant  availability  of  medical  records,\nreductions in all kinds of processing, and real time availability of medical and accounting\ninformation. Indirect benefits include enhanced quality of health care. The beneficiaries are the\ncitizens of the nation and the patients. The economic evaluation is based on the time savings\nof doctors and other staff made possible with the introduction of ICT. These time savings are\nestimated  from  achievable  productivity  levels  as  derived  from  efficient  hospitals  in  a\ncomparable country setting. It is estimated that productivity can be increased by 25 percent for\ndoctors and by 90 percent for other staff. The key factor for the economic analysis is the\nefficiency level that can be achieved in the initial years and the number of years it will take to\nachieve the full efficiency potential. It is estimated that, during the first year after introduction of\nICT, efficiency will only be 25 percent of the full potential, and that the full potential will be\nachieved after a four-year period. Productivity increases will be absorbed by the growth in the\nvolume of activity, which is estimated at 10 percent per annum based on past trends. When\nthe full potential of the savings has been reached, these will amount to Rf21.7 million per\nannum. Assuming that half of these savings can be attributed to the introduction of ICT, the\nEIRR is 35 percent. If it is assumed that it will take six years for the full potential to be\nachieved, the EIRR is 29 percent with a switching value of 0.43.\n4.  Vessel, Vehicle, and Aircraft Registration Application\n95.  For Male residents, the direct benefits of web-based applications are the time savings\nfrom avoiding a personal trip to the ministry\u2019s office for information, or for a transaction, and for\natoll residents savings both of time and of transport costs associated with the trip.  There are\nalso time savings for concerned ministry staff, but these are less substantial and can be\nconsidered as part of the benefits of the government intranet. Accordingly, the economic\nevaluation is based on the time and transport cost savings for those interactions/transactions\nthat transfer from a traditional mode to an electronic mode. These were developed in the light\nof the findings of the Internet access and usage survey, experience in other countries and\nestimates of the maximum number of operations that can be carried out electronically and the\nusage of the electronic mode during the initial years.  It is estimated that in the first year of\navailability 15 percent of trips related to permits of various kinds for sea craft, land vehicles,\nand aircraft that would need to be obtained or renewed annually will be avoided, growing to 70\npercent at the end of the evaluation period. In addition, estimates have been developed of the\naverage travel distance, the average total trip duration, and the time saved for Male residents.\nThe time cost is estimated at Rf29/hour. The resource cost of a trip by atoll residents to Male,\nestimated at Rf1,493, is based on the average fare of a single trip, which represents the\n(average) long-run marginal cost of interisland transport by sea or by air. On this basis the\nEIRR is calculated at 40 percent. If the travel cost savings of atoll residents were only 50\npercent of the base case, the EIRR would be 31 percent with a switching value of 0.73.\n5.  Internet Kiosks\n96.  The  benefits  of  the  kiosks  include  wide  access  to  information  on  government\nregulations,  guidelines,  requirements,  advisory  notices,  standards,  and  procurement\nopportunities; greater timeliness in the availability of information; and greater transparency in\ngovernment. The kiosks specifically target the population who do not have access to the", "21\ninternet through either a computer at a school, an office, or a business and for whom access to\nthe Internet and hence to e-government services is prohibitively difficult because of the cost of\nboth the terminal computer stations and internet usage charges. The kiosks will accordingly\nfacilitate the poor who cannot afford to have their own computer and pay for Internet charges\nto get access to e-government services through the public window. The economic and social\nbenefits of the kiosks are expected to justify the modest initial investment costs amounting to\nRf3.7 million. A rigorous monitoring scheme will be set up to closely track the usage of the\nkiosks and assess whether the expected economic and social benefits are realized. The\nexpansion of the kiosks to other outer islands will be based on the result of this benefit\nmonitoring.\n97.  The kiosks will be linked into the atoll network that is part of the Government\u2019s wide\narea network. As a result, public access to government information through the kiosks will not\ngive rise to any additional financial outlays compared with the situation where there would be\nno  kiosks.  In  the  long  run  there  is  no  risk  that  this  public  access  would  either  have  a\nsubstantial impact on government finances or become unsustainable. It is expected that, with\nthe rapid growth of computer workstations in households and businesses, the need for free\npublic access to the kiosks will not run out of hand. Once Internet access and usage fees have\ncome  down  and  broader  sections  of  the  population  have  direct  Internet  access  from  a\nbusiness, or from home, the free Internet kiosk will primarily be an opportunity for the lower\nincome sections of the population. But providing this opportunity is an objective that is well\nworth pursuing and supporting under the Project.\nC. Poverty Reduction Impact\n98.  The Project primarily aims at improving the efficiency, transparency, and accountability\nof public sector management and setting up a regulatory regime that will encourage fair\ncompetition in the telecoms sector. This will percolate to the outer island level and broadly help\nto reduce poverty in two ways. First, the provision of information and services via the Internet\nsystem will lead to wider social inclusion of the poor by enabling direct access to public\ninformation. In this way, rather than relying on the bureaucracy, the poor will be able to access\nsuch information directly through the Internet. In particular, the provision of information and\nservices in the areas of health and education will change the basic life pattern of people in the\nislands. The provision of health information and services will considerably reduce waiting time.\nIt will enable them to make crucial choices in terms of traveling and leaving their families\nbehind.  This  will  translate  into  savings  and  the  ability  to  make  alternative  expenditure\ndecisions, which may otherwise not be possible. Over the long run, as the Internet services\nexpand from single kiosks to widespread use in schools and other learning centers, it will open\nup a new world of information that will greatly facilitate distance education and other modes of\ninformal learning in a diverse number of areas including vocational education and specialized\ntraining and skills development.\n99.  Second,  access  to  social  services  and  public  information  will  lead  to  greater\nempowerment of the poor. Their life circumstances will acquire a greater degree of certainty,\nwhich presently eludes them. The ability to utilize the service for such things as reporting fish\ncatch, obtaining information on fish prices and trends in the demand for local products (fish\nand agricultural products), and applying for licenses will benefit poor communities through\nsavings in time and resources and better organization of their activities. This will increase their\ngeneral independence and self-reliance.\n100.  This will in turn create the conditions for enhancing their economic life and launching\nnew income-generating activities by reducing the costs of establishing businesses through", "22\nlower transportation costs and eliminating the need to travel to Male to obtain information and\nservices.\n101.  At the moment there is an imbalance in the availability of telecommunication services.\nHowever, the wider availability of such services under the Project, especially to areas that are\npresently underserved, will help to reduce regional differences and close the gap between\nspatially disadvantaged groups. It will provide an opportunity to address the disadvantages\nthat  arise  from  geographical  location  and  to  improve  communications  and  employment\nopportunities. This will, by the same token, help to generate greater economies of scale\nthrough  reduction  in  the  cost  of  services,  which  is  presently  the  single-most  important\nconstraint in reducing poverty in small island communities.\n102.  Overall, the opportunities for economic progress will be enhanced over the long term\nthrough greater efficiency resulting from lower costs and timely access to services.\nD. Private Sector Development\n103.  The Project will contribute to the creation of enabling conditions for private sector\noperations,  specifically  by  improving  governance,  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector\nDevelopment Strategy. The Project will make public administration more transparent, cause\nsector regulations to be sound, check corruption in the public sector, reduce transaction costs\nfor  public  sector  management,  and  establish  efficient  and  competitive  telecoms  service\nmarkets, all of which will eventually help promote private sector participation in the telecoms\nsector. The sector reforms pursued by the Project, especially opening up of telecoms service\nmarkets,  will  accelerate  divestment  of  the  Government\u2019s  share  in  the  monopoly  service\nprovider in the Maldives. Lower communication costs enabled by the sector reforms, and lower\ntransaction costs with the Government resulting from public services provided electronically\nwill promote private sector economic and business activities. The Project will also promote\ndirect involvement of the private sector in the course of its implementation. The establishment\nof the government network and applications for e-government will be bid out on a turnkey\nbasis to the private sector. O&M of the government network and portals could be contracted\nout to the private sector. O&M of Internet kiosks will also be contracted out to the private\nsector or to village communities.\nE. Project Risks\n104.  Relating to O&M of project equipment, including the network, applications, and Internet\nkiosks, two risks need to be addressed. The first is the financial sustainability of O&M. Since\nno financial revenue is expected from the operation of project equipment, O&M will depend on\ngovernment  budgetary  resources  of  project  equipment.  The  Project  will  ensure  the\nGovernment\u2019s commitment to allocate appropriate budgetary resources through the conditions\nof  the  Loan.  The  second  risk  concerns  who  will  operate  and  maintain  the  network  and\napplications. NCC will act as the focal point for O&M. The Project will provide an extensive\ntraining  program  for  NCC  staff  as  part  of  the  network  and  applications  development\ncomponents.\n105.  The  most  significant  potential  risk  is  how  to  motivate  government  agencies  to\nproactively participate in the Project, and to cooperate with each other to establish the network\nand share their information across all agencies. This risk will be addressed by launching large-\nscale awareness campaigns at the initial stage of the Project. The consulting services for\ndetailed design of the network and applications will include devising and executing such\nawareness campaigns for government agencies.", "23\n106.  Since the realization of the benefits is hinged on affordable Internet tariffs for the\npublic, the success of the Project is subject to the success of the telecoms sector reform that\nwill be implemented as part of it. The plan for the reform, agreed upon with the Government,\nwill commit the Government to undertake the reform under an agreed upon timetable. To\nensure the success of the reform, a holistic approach will be taken by integrating sector and\ncross-sector efforts and thereby maximizing the leverage effect of ADB\u2019s assistance. In the\ncourse, an effort will be made to involve the highest authority as a strong supporter for the\nreform. Successful implementation of the sector reform is closely linked to the regulatory\ncapacity of the independent regulatory body that will be established as part of the Project. The\nProject will provide the consulting services for capacity strengthening of the regulatory body,\nincluding a training program for its staff.\nVI. ASSURANCES\n107.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has agreed to the following\nspecific assurances, which are incorporated in the Loan Agreement between the Government\nand ADB.\n108.  The Government will:\n(i)  cause NCC to be established, including appointment of management and the\nrequired staff, within six months of loan effectiveness.\n(ii)  provide  the  PMU  and  NCC  with  adequate  budgetary  resources  for  their\neffective operations during and after project implementation.\n(iii)  allocate  appropriate  budgetary  resources  to  concerned  ministries  for\nsustainable O&M of project facilities.\n(iv)  ensure that the PMU and NCC are at all times staffed with the appropriate\nnumber of suitably qualified personnel and have suitable office accommodation.\n(v)  provide appropriate counterpart funds in a timely manner for the Project during\nimplementation.\n109.  Unless otherwise agreed upon between the Government and ADB, the following key\nsector policies will be implemented:\n(i)  The Government will draft the Telecommunications Act (the draft Act), and\nconsider the comments of stakeholders in the review process, within one year\nof loan effectiveness.\n(ii)  The Government will submit the draft Act to Parliament for approval within 18\nmonths of loan effectiveness.\n(iii)  The  Government  will  establish  an  independent  regulatory  body,  including\nmanagement, staffing, budget, facilities, etc., with appropriate mandate and\nauthority as stipulated in the Act, prior to the loan closing date.", "24\n(iv)  The  Government  will  ensure  opening  up  of  the  Internet  service  market  to\ncompetition within two years of loan effectiveness to bring charges to affordable\nlevels in line with international best practices\nVII.  RECOMMENDATION\n110.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of\nADB and acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the\nArticles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board approve the loan in various\ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 7,509,000 to the Republic of Maldives for the\nInformation Technology Development Project, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period\nof 8 years, and with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace\nperiod and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter,

Overview\n1.  The project management unit will retain two international consultants who will prepare\nthe detailed scope of work and detailed terms of reference (TOR) for each subproject design\nand  implementation.  Consultants  from  two  separate  disciplines  will  be  required  (cid:190)   a\ncommunications network engineer, and an application development specialist (cid:190)  for six person-\nmonths each. The following sections provide the TOR for the two.\nB.  Communications Network Engineer (International, 6 person-months)\n2.  The communications network engineer will lead the specification and selection of the\napplication development team through six stages as follows:\n(i)  Prepare the specifications to be tendered for selecting the project team that will\ndesign and oversee the implementation of the government network.\n(ii)  Oversee the tendering process for selecting this project team.\n(iii)  Develop evaluation requirements for awarding the tender in coordination with the\n(MCST).\n(iv)  Evaluate tenders that have been received, and coordinate the selection of the\nwinning bid.\n(v)  Identify qualified external training organizations, jointly design training programs\nfor concerned ministries, and contract out training by making use of the budget\nseparately allocated within these consulting services.\n(vi)  Develop awareness campaigns for the government network, and conduct pilot\nawareness campaigns.\n3.  To this end, the communications network engineer will develop the scope of work,\nrecommend the staffing structure for the networking and government portals subprojects, and\nprepare  the  detailed  TOR  for  each  team  member.  The  general  strategy  will  be  to  use\ninternational  consultants  primarily  as  mentors,  with  the  domestic  team  members  gradually\nassuming more responsibilities as the development progresses.  By the time final testing and\nacceptance  of  each  component  have  been  completed,  all  management  and  development\nactivities will be carried out by domestic staff. Training for concerned ministries will, therefore,\ncomprise an integral part of the network development. The communications network engineer\nwill carry out the following tasks:\n(i)  Review  all  preceding  reports,  studies,  and  recommendations  concerning  the\ndevelopment of the Government Network of Maldives (GNM).  This will include\nthe  anticipated  applications,  community  interest,  and  planned  networking\narchitecture.\n(ii)  Through  interviews  with  representatives  of  ministerial  and  parastatal  users,\nconfirm that the direction of development of the government networking concept", "33\nAppendix 6, page 2\nis still appropriate for the community it will be designed to serve.  If anything has\nchanged the networking requirements or priorities, revise the preliminary network\ndesign accordingly.\n(iii)  Prepare a report summarizing the preliminary network design. This report will\ninclude a design history indicating why critical decisions were deemed most\nappropriate at the time.  The report will address both the Male Metropolitan\nNetwork and the Atolls Backbone Network in isolation, along with details for their\ninterconnection and for interconnection with monopoly carrier facilities.\n(iv)  Based on this, develop a conceptual design and implementation plan for the\nProject.  This plan will establish the deployment priorities for network service in\nconcert with the objectives of MCST and government network users.  This will\ninclude  a  plan  for  commissioning  of  service  for  both  the  Male  Metropolitan\nNetwork and the Atolls Backbone Network.\n(v)  Develop cost estimates for the design, construction, and operation of the Male\nMetropolitan Network and the Atolls Backbone Network.\n(vi)  Recommend  the  composition  and  reporting  structure  of  the  design  and\nimplementation team for the Male Metropolitan Network and the Atolls Backbone\nNetwork. The team will be designed such that core work will be started with an\ninternational  consultant  as  mentor,  and  other  international  experts  providing\nservices as appropriate throughout the Project.\n(vii)  Incorporate a skills transfer component in the Project such that, by the time of\nformal acceptance, domestic experts are in charge of aspects of the network\nproject.\n(viii)  Prepare  comprehensive  TOR  for  each  member  of  the  network  design  and\nimplementation team.  This will include the requirements of each domestic and\ninternational  member  of  each  discipline  for  the  design,  specification,  and\nimplementation of the network.  It will also define the training role to be fulfilled by\neach  international  team  member  as  needed  to  enable  the  domestic  team\nmember to assume the leadership role by the completion of the Project.\nC.  Application Development Specialist (international, 6 person-months)\n4.  The application development specialist will lead the specification and selection of the\napplication development team through six stages as follows:\n(i)  Prepare the specifications to be tendered for selecting the project team that will\ndevelop the initial applications.\n(ii)  Oversee the tendering process for selecting this project team.\n(iii)  Develop evaluation requirements for awarding the tender in coordination with\nMCST and the application\u2019s user ministry or organization.\n(iv)  Evaluate tenders that have been received, and coordinate the selection of the\nwinning bid.", "34\nAppendix 6, page 3\n(v)  Identify qualified external training organizations, jointly design training programs\nfor concerned ministries, and contract out training by making use of the budget\nseparately allocated within these consulting services.\n(vi)  Develop  awareness  campaigns  for  applications  for  provision  of  government\ninformation and services, and conduct pilot awareness campaign.\n5.  To this end, the application development specialist will develop the scope of work and\nrecommend the staffing structure for the initial ministerial application to use the facilities of the\nGNM. This will include preparing the detailed TOR for each team member. The general strategy\nwill be to use international consultants primarily as mentors, with the domestic team members\ngradually assuming more responsibilities as the development progresses. By the time final\ntesting  and  acceptance  of  each  Project  have  been  completed,  all  management  and\ndevelopment activities will be carried out by domestic staff. Training for concerned ministries\nwill,  therefore,  comprise  an  integral  part  of  the  network  development.  The  application\ndevelopment specialist will carry out the following tasks:\n(i)  Review all preceding reports concerning the development of the GNM and all\nrelevant  ministerial  documents  to  gain  a  full  appreciation  of  the  information\ntechnology environment  within which the target application will be implemented.\n(ii)  Review potential applications that are identified in this report, along with other\npotential applications that have been identified by the ministries in the interim.\nDevelop a standard system for comparative ranking of the costs, benefits, and\nrisks associated with new application deployment in the Government.\n(iii)  Through interviews with representatives of ministerial and parastatal users, gain\na firm understanding of the objectives and potential impact of each application on\nboth the Government and the public at large.\n(iv)  Prepare a summary report presenting a critical comparative assessment of these\napplications, and rank their relative priorities in accordance with the comparative\nranking  strategy.  Make  recommendations  for  first  and  second  application\nalternatives, and obtain agreement from MCST and the affected ministries that\nthis is, in fact, the most beneficial choice for the country.\n(v)  Prepare a preliminary specification software for the selected application. This\ndocument must be designed to serve as the core reference for subsequent\ndevelopment  of  the  selected  application.  It  is  preferable  that  the  selected\napplication not be such that it requires a completely new design.  Rather it should\nbe one that can draw heavily on similar large-scale commercial or government\napplications, with appropriate tailoring to meet Maldivian needs.  The objective is\nto achieve maximum levels of benefit at minimum cost and with minimal risk.\n(vi)  Plan a structure for the team that will carry out the detailed design, specification,\nand implementation of the selected initial application. Prepare comprehensive\nTOR for each member of the network design and implementation team.  This will\ninclude the requirements of each domestic and international member of each\ndiscipline for the design, specification, and implementation of the application.", "35\nAppendix 6, page 4\n(vii)  Identify the specific training that will be needed to optimize the effectiveness of\nthe domestic consultants prior to commencement of the Project.  Also define the\ntraining role to be fulfilled by each international team member as needed to\nenable  the  domestic  team  member  to  assume  the  leadership  role  by  the\ncompletion of the Project.\nD.  Initial Applications\n6.  A  working  session  was  held  at  MCST  with  representatives  of  information  and\ncommunications technology stakeholders from ministries and related organizations that are\npotential major users or suppliers of information technology.  The following paragraphs provide\nfive possible initial applications arising from this session.\n7.  National Identity Card. The Department of National Registration within the Ministry of\nHome Affairs, Housing and Environment is in the process of deploying an ICT environment to\nsupport the creation of a national identification (ID) card.  The new card will replace the existing\nmanual card system.\n8.  Many government organizations require personal information as a core input to other\nneeds.  Although this application is now well along in development, it remains unclear how\nothers will access needed information and how the validity of this information will be assured.  A\npossible core application may be the provision of a common means or strategy for accessing\npersonal information from the national ID database.\n9.  Public Hospital Information System. Improving information management within the\nIndira Ghandi Memorial Hospital will reduce operating costs and improve patient care. Some of\nthe many benefits arising from the use of ICT within a hospital setting include\n(i)  single patient registration;\n(ii)  improved availability of medical records;\n(iii)  reductions in unnecessary (or redundant) physician orders;\n(iv)  reductions in adverse drug events;\n(v)  reductions in chart pulls;\n(vi)  improved turnaround of test results;\n(vii)  reduction of use of paper; and\n(viii)  detailed, real-time cost information available by department or procedure\n10.  The public hospital has invested significantly in the beginnings of an advanced ICT\nenvironment.  The  institution  has  learned,  first  hand,  the  pitfalls  of  \u201creinventing\u201d  major\napplications.  A  number  of  applications  have  been  identified  in  use  at  comparable  foreign\ninstitutions.  The strategy of this application would be to develop or customize a proven medical\nmanagement system to suit the specific needs of the hospital.\n11.  Electronic Provision of Health Service. Health services can also be extended to the\nlarger public through the use of the Internet. In a 1999 study in the United States, Deloitte and\nTouche found that 70 million people used the Internet to search for health information.  Of\nthese, 53 percent went on-line at least once each month, while 24 percent went on-line at least\nonce a week.  The study also found that 6.9 million adults who use the Internet for this purpose\nwere caregivers to individuals with chronic conditions.\n12.  Electronic provision of health service is the practice of using the Internet to connect\ncaregivers, healthcare systems, and hospitals with consumers. Electronic provision of health", "36\nAppendix 6, page 5\nservice enables consumers to take advantage of tools, content, and services in the comfort of\ntheir own homes to better manage their health and care. The widespread application of e-Health\napplications can support the secure exchange of clinical and health information relevant to\nconsumers and clinicians.  Benefits fall into four general areas.\n(i)  Content:  The Internet offers diverse information resources.\n(ii)  Community:  The Internet offers support groups and a communications network\nor learning and sharing information about diverse health topics.\n(iii)  Commerce:  Health-related goods and services can be purchased on-line.\n(iv)  Care:  Healthcare treatment can be delivered via the Internet.\n13.  Vessel,  Vehicle,  and  Aircraft  Registration.  The  Land  Division  of  the  Ministry  of\nTransportation and Civil Aviation is responsible for licensing of motor vehicles and operators.\nTracking of drivers and their payments of fines is problematic, as is the recording of transfers of\nownership of both automobiles and vessels. Verification that a vehicle is free of liens requires\nthe involvement of several ministries and laborious manual record searching, often requiring a\nminimum of one week.  The Land Division has a pilot project in which applicants can apply for a\nlicense at a server kiosk, apply on-line, and take an operators\u2019 test. Plans are to install these\nservers at four locations, without connecting them back to the Ministry. One possible beneficial\napplication for consideration here would be to expand the scope of this limited deployment,\nbased on operating experience gained to date.\n14.  Thaana  Standardization.  In  the  past,  both  the  development  and  use  of  ICT  has\ndepended on the use of the English language.  For the most part electronic correspondence\n(email) is English based.  Database applications have an English core, although there has been\na strong desire to store and retrieve information in Thaana script.\n15.  At  present  there  are  at  least  two  separate  and  incompatible  methods  of  encoding\nThaana script. Information stored in one environment cannot be read by a user from an ICT\nenvironment using the other coding scheme.\n16.  A standardized encoding of Thaana script has now been adopted by the International\nStandards Organization.  It will be an inherent language selection option within the next release\nof Windows 2000 and Microsoft Office. This offers the opportunity for the government to provide\na common approach to the use of Thaana script.\n17.  There is a need for the Government to adopt the international representation of Thaana\nscript.  This will require conversion of all existing data bases that contain stored Thaana script,\nalong with conversions of the applications themselves to use the new script encoding.\n18.  Similarly, there are two separate keyboard encoding strategies: one phonetically based,\nthe other more character oriented.  People trained to use one keyboard encoding scheme\ncannot easily use the other. The Government may wish to consider the standardization of the\nkeyboard  human  interface  for  the  use  of  Thaana  script.  This  would  require  system\nreprogramming, along with retraining of all personnel who are currently skilled in using the\nimplementation that would be abandoned.\n19.  It must be emphasized, however, that while the standardization of script and keyboards\nis  highly  desirable,  these  can  be  addressed  as  separate  issues.  It  is  entirely  feasible  to\nstandardize character encoding independently from the human interface of the keyboard. The\nmain reason for integrating the two is to ensure that opportunities for the people are enhanced.", "37\nAppendix 7, page 1\nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES\nFOR CAPACITY STRENGTHENING OF REGULATORY BODY\nA.

Introduction\n1.  This  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)  assesses  the  potential\nenvironmental  impacts  of  the  proposed  Information  Technology  Development  Project.  It\nprovides a brief account of the Project and the activities involved, including location, magnitude,\nand implementation schedule. The natural, social, and \u201cbuilt\u201d environments that the Project is\nlikely to affect are described. Because of the extensive nature of the Project, mainly existing\ninformation was used to describe the natural and the built environment. Wherever available,\nspecific information about the environment of the islands is provided. When specific information\ncorresponding to islands or locations is not readily available, general descriptions pertaining to\nthe whole country are included.\n2.  Utilizing the information provided in the project design, and taking into consideration the\nenvironment, both natural and built, covered by the Project, the activities of the different phases\nof the Project have been screened for potential environmental impacts. Mitigation measures are\nsuggested if and when necessary for different activities. The results of the screening process\nare discussed based on whether a follow-up environmental impact assessment is required or\nnot.\nB. Description of the Environment\n1. Physical Resources\n3.  The Republic of Maldives is an island nation located in the West Indian Ocean. The\narchipelago,  850  kilometers  long  and  120  kilometers  at  its  widest,  consists  of  26  atolls\ncomprising 1,200 islands. The local population inhabits 200 of those islands, and 85 of which\nare operating as tourist resorts. The distances between the different centers of population are\ntherefore a handicap for development, all the more since they have to be covered by boat for\nthe transport of goods and people.\n4.  Two parallel chains of atolls constitute most of the central part of the country, whereas\nthe  southern  part  consists  of  a  single  chain  of  atolls.  The  atolls  are  separated  by  larger\nchannels. The insides of the atolls are usually quite shallow, with depth usually in the range of\n40 meters. The channels are much deeper, on the order of 200 - 400 meters.\n5.  The climate is dominated by the monsoon variations of the Indian Ocean. The northeast\nmonsoon from December to March is characterized by dry weather and little wind, whereas the\nsouthwest monsoon, from May to November, is windier and wetter. The temperature is constant\nalmost all year long at around 30 degrees Celsius (\u00b0C). The ocean temperatures are also\nvirtually constant all year long, varying between 27\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C.\n6.  The islands are made from calcium carbonate sediments created by the corals and other\nliving organisms of the reefs and are consolidated into limestone. The islands are very low lying,\nand therefore depend a lot on the reefs that surround them for protection against waves.\n7.  The islands would be quite affected by a rise in sea level, as more wave energy means\nmore sediment suspension and therefore more sediment loss from the island. This would not be\nso preoccupying if the corals could build up fast enough to keep up with the rise in sea level. At", "43\nAppendix 9, page 2\npresent, the dead corals from the recent natural bleaching event of 1998 (para. 17) have broken\ndown and toppled over, thus lowering the obstacle to the waves in many areas.\n8.  The islands usually have an underlying fresh water lens made by the rainwater infiltrating\nthe substrate. This groundwater might remain salty depending on the size and the porosity of\nthe substrate of the island.\n9.  There is no particular mineral resource in the Maldives apart from corals and sand, which\nhave been used for construction. Imported building material is now preferred for all major works,\nbut coral and sand mining, although regulated, still goes on in a minor scale.\n10.  The Male area is in the center of the archipelago and has always been the point of focus\nfor development projects. The concentration of population there has a strong impact on the\nsurrounding  environment,  as  people  move  from  the  outer  islands  to  the  capital.  The\ngroundwater lens has been depleted, and some land has been reclaimed using garbage, so that\na desalination plant has had to be constructed. Traffic on the island is quite congested. Noise\npollution is also present almost everywhere, mainly from construction work.\n2. Ecological Resources\n11.  The islands of the Maldives are surrounded by coral reefs, which provide protection,\nfood, and income. The Maldivian economy relies on the tourism and fisheries industries, both of\nwhich are highly dependent on these reefs.\n12.  The coral reefs of the Maldives are diverse, with 209 species of coral in 62 genera\nrepresenting in 15 families, and about 1096 species of reef fish. Among the marine mammals,\n12 species of whales in 10 genera, and 7 species of dolphins in 5 genera have been recorded\nfrom the Maldives and they have been given protected status since 15 May 1993. Five species\nof marine turtles inhabit the waters of the Maldives, and a ten-year moratorium has been applied\non taking of marine turtles since 24 June 1995.\n13.  The tuna pole and line fishery, the traditional fishery for centuries, relies on a constant\nsupply of live bait obtained from the reefs.\n14.  Fisheries targeted at reef resources have expanded rapidly in the last two decades and\nare mostly export oriented. Some of the groups that have been exploited are giant clams, sea\ncucumbers, and live tropical fish. Due to the unsustainable nature of the giant clam fishery, a\nban on killing or extraction of giant clams was imposed in 1993.\n15.  Five species of spiny lobsters are found in Maldives. Export of lobsters is banned, and\nthe Government declared a size limit on collecting lobsters with carapace length less than 25\ncm in 1978.\n16.  Historically,  coral  was  mined  by  local  communities  for  the  construction  of  important\nbuildings. In the early 1970s, coral mining started expanding rapidly, and in 1992, regulations\nwere put in place by the Government in an effort to regulate it.\n17.  The extensive coral bleaching incident that occurred in early 1998 decreased the live\ncoral cover on most reefs of the Maldives from 40-60 percent to 1-2 percent. The bleaching was\ndue  to  prolonged  thermal  stress,  probably  caused  by  elevated  sea  surface  temperatures", "44\nAppendix 9, page 3\ncoinciding with an El Nino Southern Oscillation event. Currently recovery processes are under\nway and many new corals can be seen on the reefs.\n18.  There are 25 protected dive sites in the Maldives, located in the tourist zones. All types of\nfisheries are banned at these sites except bait fishing by the traditional pole and line tuna\nfishery.  However,  the  activities  at  these  sites  are  not  monitored  due  to  lack  of  a  proper\nmanagement system.\n3. Human and Economic Development\n19.  The  Maldives  has  a  centralized  pattern  of  development,  with  much  of  the  activity\nconcentrated in the capital island of Male, which has a resident population of 62,519. This is\n25.5 percent of the total population of 244,814 recorded in the 1995 Census report. Among the\nislands  designated  as  atoll  capitals,  only  Kulhudhuffushi  (Haa  Dhaalu  Atoll),  Foahmulah\n(Gnaviyani Atoll), and Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll) boast a population in excess of 5,000 people.\nThere is also an increasingly high density of 334.3 persons/hectare in Male, while the average\ndensity for the entire nation is 26.1 persons/hectare.  The average household size stands at 9.3\nfor Male and 6.6 for the atolls.\n20.  The swelling population of Male is due to the rapid in-migration from the other islands, for\nthe most part seeking gainful employment opportunities both in Male and at the surrounding\nresort islands as well as for educational purposes.  This trend has greatly influenced the marked\nfall in the primary sector, and the comparable growth in the tertiary sector recorded  between\n1985 and 1995.\n21.  The Maldives\u2019 economy itself transformed from one relying mainly on traditional primary\nindustries to the tertiary.  Even though fishing is still the major economic activity and source of\nlivelihood for about 74 percent of the population living outside Male and the tourist resorts, its\nimpact upon the overall economy of the country has markedly reclined. The primary sector\ncontribution to gross domestic product in 1998 was 17.6 percent, while the tertiary sector\nrecorded 64.3 percent.\n22.  The capital is the seat of government. The administrative atolls are the basic units of\nadministration.  An atoll capital through its atoll office, is responsible for all the islands and its\ncommunities comprising the atoll unit.  The island offices report directly to their respective atoll\noffice on all matters of administration and development. Except for these atoll offices in each of\nthe 20 atoll units and their subordinate island offices in each administrative island of each atoll,\nall main institutions within the government structure are based in Male. Financial institutions of\ninternationally  acceptable  standards  are  established  in  Male  and,  apart  from  the  Bank  of\nMaldives, which has eight branches in the atolls, all other banks restrict their activities to the\ncapital, which is the site of much of the country\u2019s commerce.\n23.  The only international airport in the country is at Hulhule island, across from Male. The\nfour domestic (regional) airports are near the atoll capitals of Haa Dhaalu, Laamu, Gaafu\nDhaalu, and Seenu atolls. The main international sea freight port is Male. Harbors around Male\nare constructed to competently handle the large numbers of inter-and intra-atoll sea transport.\nMore than 50 percent of the other administrative islands sport rock-filled jetties, pile-structures\nbeing evident at only a few islands.  However, the problem of ineffective natural harbors is being\ncombated through the harbor-dredging program begun in 1995.  More than half of the atoll\ncapitals now have effective harbors.", "45\nAppendix 9, page 4\n24.  Transport on Male is facilitated by streets and roads, whiclarger streets, pedestrian\ncrossings, a traffic light and speed breaker system, and specified parking areas. Drainage\nfacilities run along either side of all paved roads, while electric and telephone cables below\nground extend in a similar fashion.  In most other islands, roads are unpaved, and land transport\nis either by foot or by bicycle. Rarely is a vehicle such as a lorry or pickup used to carry goods.\nMore vehicles are found in the atoll capitals, especially in Kulhudhuffushi (Haa Dhaalu Atoll),\nFonadhoo (Laamu Atoll), Thinadhoo (Gaafu Dhaalu Atoll), Foahmulah (Gnaviyani Atoll), and\nHithadhoo (Seenu Atoll).\n25.  The Maldives Water and Sanitation Authority undertakes water and sewerage operations\nin  Male  and  is  the  national  regulatory  body  for  such  services  throughout  the  country.\nDesalination plants pipe water to properties thoughout Male, while distribution points delivering\nwater free of charge are located at regular intervals, mostly because the groundwater is of a\nvery poor quality in many areas of the capital.  In the atoll regions, groundwater is the main\nsource  of  water  supply.  The  installation  of  private  and  community  rainwater  tanks  as  an\nalternative to groundwater is, however, encouraged.\n26.  The sewage system of Male has provision for sewer connections throughout the capital.\nAt the atoll level, only 26 percent of the islands have proper sanitation facilities. There is still\nwidespread use of in-household plots and beach disposal. The work of installing small-bore\nsewerage systems is progressing at island localities in an effort to introduce more effective and\nsafer sanitation practices.\n27.  Public power transmission on a 24-hour basis in Male by the State Electric Company\nLimited (STELCO) is via a power plant with a total capacity of 21.5 megawatts. Electricity supply\nis  provided  on  other  islands  by  STELCO,  private  resort  and  factory  operators,  private\nentrepreneurs, or community-owned and -operated facilities. According to the Ministry of Atolls\nAdministration, at the end of 1996, 5.6 percent of atoll populations lived without electricity, 77\npercent had access to it for 5-12 hours per day, and only 17.6 percent had electric power for\nmore than 12 hours a day. At present, STELCO provides electricity to 21 islands through 17\npower stations, of which, 8 are in the atoll capitals.\n28.  A  four-tier  health  care  system  exists  in  the  Maldives.  The  Indira  Gandhi  Memorial\nHospital and the Department of Public Health located in Male, function at the central level,\nfollowed by regional hospitals, atoll health stations and family health sections based at the\nisland  level.  The  five  regional  hospitals  are  in  the  atoll  capitals  of  Haa  Dhaalu  Atoll\n(Kulhudhuffushi), Raa Atoll (Ugoofaaru), Meemu Atoll (Muli), Gaafu Dhaalu Atoll (Thinadhoo),\nand Seenu Atoll (Hithadhoo).\n29.  Male is the base of educational activity. Schools are either government, community, or\nprivate establishments.  There are only two schools outside Male (cid:190)  the Northern Secondary\n(Kulhudhuffyshi, Haa Dhaalu Atoll capital) and Southern Secondary (Hithadhoo, Seenu Atoll\ncapital) schools  (cid:190)  that are sufficiently equipped in infrastructure and staff to cater to students\nat a regional level.  At the atoll level, the Atoll Educations provide up to secondary level\neducation,  while  the  Atoll  Primary  Schools  offer  up  to  middle  school  education.    All\nadministrative islands in the Maldives have at least one island school. The Maldives College of\nHigher Education the only institution offering further educational opportunities, and the only two\nschools offering higher secondary education, are located in Male.\n30.  Dhivehi  Raajjeyge  Gulhun  (Dhiraagu)  established  in  1988,  provides  national  and\ninternational telecommunications services from its headquarters in Male. At present, Dhiraagu", "46\nAppendix 9, page 5\nhas established six operations (five in atoll capitals) and three maintenance units (one in an atoll\ncapital) in different locations across the country. Every inhabited island in the Maldives now has\npayphones.\n4. Quality of Life Values\n31.  Traditionally, tuna pole and line fishery has been the preferred source of protein, and the\nmajor source of employment and foreign earnings in the Maldives. With the development of\ntourism and other types of fisheries in the past two decades, the importance of this fishery has\nlessened. Initially, the new fisheries provided additional employment for the fishermen during\ntuna fishing off-season but more recently, the fisheries based on reef resources have become\nmore permanent.\n32.  The tourism industry of the Maldives began in the early 1970s and has rapidly expanded\nto 85 resort islands on 11 atolls. Resort islands are kept separate from the local villages, thus\nreducing the social impacts arising from tourism.\n33.  Male, the capital is 1 square mile and had a population of about 67,000 in 2000. It is the\nurban center, and people migrate there from the other islands in search of better employment\nopportunities and improved educational and health facilities.\n34.  One of the major anthropogenic impacts on the environment facing the Maldives today is\nthat  caused  by  improper  solid  waste  disposal.  The  direct  disposal  of  large  amounts  of\nnonbiodegradable  material  such  as  plastic  bags  onto  the  coast  and  the  reefs  leads  to\ndeterioration of the environment. Solid waste management is a major concern on most islands,\nand proper management measures to dispose of waste are lacking. Many use the mangrove\nand wetland areas as their garbage dump, not seeing the importance of these ecosystems to\nbiodiversity and looking at them as breeding grounds for mosquitoes. This problem has been\ndealt  with  around  Male,  where  a  landfill  island  has  been  identified  and  waste  disposal\nmechanisms put in place. Most of the tourist resorts use this site for their garbage disposal, and\nthis needs to be replicated in the other atolls.\n35.  The village islands are usually clean, and the island women\u2019s committees have weekly\norganized sweeping days where the women get together and clean the island. However, the\nroads are unpaved and during the rainy season puddles can be observed due to lack of proper\ndrainage systems.\n36.  The cost of living in the Maldives is generally quite high due to the large amount of\nimported goods. Apart from marine resources, natural resources are minimal, and most things\nhave to be imported.\nC. Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts, and Mitigation Measures\n1. Screening Procedure\n37.  The nature and design of the Information Technology Development Project does not lend\nitself  to  standard  screening  guidelines  recommended  for  projects  developed  by  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank.  Those  projects  where  screening  guidelines  have  been  drawn  up  are\nnormally located in a distinct area and there are significant, measurable physical changes taking\nplace during all phases of the project.", "47\nAppendix 9, page 6\n38.  Greater environmental impacts are expected when there are significant disturbances to\nthe environment during both the construction and operational phases, which is the case in\nprojects  such  as  ports  and  harbor  development,  sewage  disposal  systems,  and  urban\ndevelopment where specific criteria are set for screening. However, while the Project involves\nvery little physical infrastructure development, the project area is extensive and covers nearly\nthe whole of the Maldives. Therefore broad screening of the different phases of the Project has\nbeen carried out. The screening for potential environmental impacts has been carried out by\ninvestigating  those  impacts  that  could  occur  during  the  construction,  implementation,  and\noperational phases of the Project.\n2. Construction Phase\n39.  In the design of the Project, very few building and construction works are proposed. The\nlimited work that will be carried out consists of the construction of two buildings in Male and the\nlaying of a fiber optic cable ring around Male for the government network.\n40.  The National Computer Center (NCC) will be a key node on the Male backbone network\nand  will  consist  of  two  separate  structures:  a  five-storey  office  facility  and  a  three-storey\nadjoining  structure,  which  will  house  the  network  operation  center.  The  network  will  be\npartitioned into three layers: the backbone, the distribution layer, and the access layer. The\nbackbone will have a dual (single mode) fiber optic ring architecture. Forty buildings housing\ngovernment facilities will be grouped into approximately 20 building clusters. Larger building\nclusters will be served by interconnecting them with a smaller distribution network. These\ndistribution  networks  will  have  a  multimode  fiber  optic  ring  or  hierarchical  architecture  as\nappropriate for the size of the distribution network.\n41.  During the construction phase of the NCC there is a risk of contributing to salinization of\nthe groundwater of Male, as some water needs to be pumped out for laying the foundations for\nthe multi-storey buildings. The water will go to the sea as runoff or by the storm water drainage,\nthus contributing further to the salinization of Male groundwater, which is already in very bad\ncondition.\n42.  During the construction phase of this building, there may be some disruption to the\nnormal  road  traffic,  particularly  for  people  walking  on  the  pavement.  Measures  such  as\ncontaining building materials within the building site and working during the night when traffic is\nless will be taken to minimize the disturbance.\n43.  Both the above environmental impacts, identified for the construction phase of the NCC\nbuilding  are  considered  to  be  nonsignificant  in  view  of  the  existing  situation  in  Male  and\nparticularly in isolation for this Project only.\n44.  The fiber optic ring to be laid around Male for the backbone layer and the distribution\nlayer of the network will have to be laid in the paved roads, which is not expected to have\nserious environmental consequences. However, to reduce any impacts it is recommended that\nexisting facilities being used for other utilities such as telephone lines, and electricity cables be\nutilized to install the fiber optic ring too.\n45.  There are two forecast consequences while laying the fiber optic cable. One is disruption\nof traffic and resulting congestion. Mitigation measures for limiting this inconvenience will be\ncareful planning and timing of the works. The other is possible damage to existing facilities such\nas water pipes, electricity cables, and sewage and drainage systems. Measures to avoid any", "48\nAppendix 9, page 7\naccident  should  include  careful  study  of  the  existing  facilities  by  consulting  the  relevant\ninstitutions.  In  addition,  while  laying  the  fiber  optic  cable,  good  supervision  and  care  are\nrequired.\n46.  The atoll backbone network will provide access to government services and facilities from\nconnection points in the atolls. In the first phase, no additional physical infrastructure will be\nbuilt,  and  existing  telecommunications  infrastructure  will  be  used.  Therefore,  no  significant\nenvironmental impacts are envisaged.\n47.  It  is  also  generally  noted  that  the  information  industry  is  environment  friendly  as\ncompared with other types of industries. It is based on the four most abundant, least expensive\nand  most  widely  distributed  items  in  the  world  \u2013  silicon,  the  material  used  to  make\nmicroelectronic devices; lightwaves and airwaves the communication media of the future; and\nhuman brain power, the principal source of motivation in the information age.\n3. Implementation Phase\n48.  During the implementation phase, no significant negative impacts on the environment are\nforecast, as it mainly concerns training of people and setting up an information technology\nadvisory committee whose role is to determine ICT policies.\n4. Operational Phase\n49.  The impacts during the operational phase are difficult to quantify, as they will contribute\nindirectly to overall development. It is predicted that, with enhanced communications between\ngovernment agencies in Male and also with the atolls, the sharing of data will result in improved\nmanagement  of  environmental  resources.  This  will  also  strengthen  enforcement  of\nenvironmental  laws  and  regulations  by  increasing  awareness  and  speeding  up  the  law\nenforcement  process.  At  present,  the  process  of  reporting  environmental  law  offenders  to\nconcerned agencies takes a long time due to lack of fast communication. This should be\nrectified with the increased interaction between Male and the other islands.\n50.  Faster and more efficient communication between Male and the other islands will create\nmore employment, and decrease the migration of people to Male, thus limiting the negative\nconsequences of an overcrowded area. When compared with other industrial work, \u201cinformation\nwork\u201d  is  more  environment  friendly.  The  use  of  advanced  communication  services  to\ncommunicate with co-workers from home or around the world is an attractive alternative to\nmovement toward already crowded businesses.\n51.  Environmental awareness is at the root of environmental conservation. It is expected that\nthe level of knowledge pertaining to the environment will increase among the local people,\nespecially the students, with the help of the Internet.\n52.  Telecommunications  and  information  technologies  have  an  important  role  to  play  in\nprotecting  the  environment  and  in  promoting  development  activities  at  low  risk  to  the\nenvironment. The application of these technologies can reduce paperwork, which ultimately\nsaves forests.", "49\nAppendix 9, page 8\nD. Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program\n53.  As stated in the previous section, the environmental impacts arising from this Project are\ndifficult to quantify independently from the other activities taking place simultaneously in the\nproject location as well as from the consequences of past activities. Consequently, it will be\ndifficult to monitor the impacts from the Project and the activities leading to them.\n54.  It  can  be  argued  that  collecting  and  analyzing  groundwater  samples  could  monitor\nsaltwater intrusion caused by the pumping out of groundwater from the freshwater lens while\nlaying the foundations of the building for the NCC. Unfortunately, the hydrologic mechanisms\nruling  the  freshwater  lens  rule  out  this  possibility.  When  groundwater  is  pumped  out,  the\ngroundwater table is lowered locally. This local decline in the groundwater table is going to be\nreplaced by fresh water coming from neighboring parts of the freshwater lens as well as by an\nupwelling  of  the  saltwater  underlying  the  freshwater.  This  salt  water  compressed  into  the\ncalcium carbonate matrix forming the island substrate tends to rise into the soil, thinning the\nfreshwater lens.  The disturbances from the natural flow of groundwater through the island\nsubstrates, which is vertical down from the surface and out toward the sea, have a double\neffect. This type of disturbance to the water flow causes concentration of water of low quality\ninside the freshwater lens reaching from sewage pits, and from the peripheral areas being\nreclaimed with garbage, and thus reduces the freshwater lens. This effect is quite difficult to\nmeasure for the Project, when we know that the estimate of water usage for flushing only for the\npopulation of Male exceeds the quantity of water that should be taken out of the freshwater lens\nfor its sustainable management. In a lot of places the freshwater has a very distinctive smell of\nsulphur, ammonia, and oil.\n55.  Another effect forecast in the initial environmental examination is that the improved\ncommunication system would limit migration from the islands to Male and therefore reduce the\nenvironmental pressure on the Male area. If this phenomenon is observed in the years to come,\nit would be hard to quantify the respective importance of the present Project and regional\ndevelopment projects.\n56.  Improved data sharing among the different government and parastatal agencies, which is\nalso  anticipated  as  a  major  outcome  of  the  Project,  would  affect  the  importance  of  the\nenvironmental part in management policies in the Maldives. It would be hard to quantify the\nimportance of this Project only, as many other measures and activities tend to lead into that\nsame direction.\nE. Findings and Recommendations\n57.  The  proposed  Project  represents  a  stepping  stone  for  island  development.  It  is\nanticipated to improve the overall quality of life of Maldivians.\n58.  Such infrastructure will enable people from the islands to communicate with co-workers\nfrom  Male  and  other  islands  and  is  an  attractive  alternative  to  movement  toward  already\ncrowded businesses. Tertiary activities could then spread out toward the remoter areas of the\nMaldives.\n59.  The only negative impacts on the environment of such a project have been identified to\noccur during the construction phase. These impacts are very minimal and are several orders of\nmagnitude lower than the benefits expected during the operational phase.", "50\nAppendix 9, page 9\n60.  Improved communication between the capital and the other islands will enable more\npeople to share data for management purposes, which in turn will improve the management of\nenvironmental resources. It will also facilitate strengthening of the enforcement of environmental\nlaws and regulations.\n61.  A link to the outside world through the Internet will increase environmental awareness\namong the public, which is a very useful tool in the proper management of environmental\nresources.\nF. Conclusions\n62.  The screening process for this Project, as compared with other larger and more complex\nprojects involving a lot of physical infrastructure, enables easy identification of any impacts that\ncould be possibly encountered. It has been shown how difficult it would be to isolate the specific\nimpacts from this Project with regard to the sum of other physical infrastructure development\nworks in Male. Unless the impacts of all other construction works going on in the area that\nwould be directly effected by this Project are quantified, it is envisaged that the outcome of\nseparate environmental monitoring for this Project would be ineffective. In the atolls, as there\nwill be no additional infrastructure established, no further study is required.\n63.  In conclusion, as this Project does not have significant negative environmental impacts,\nthe need for an environmental impact assessment does not arise. Monitoring and mitigation\nmeasures for the limited impacts identified will be sufficient.", "51\nAppendix 10, page 1\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS\nA. Introduction\n1.  The Project aims at improvements in three main areas: (i) in public sector management\nthrough the establishment of a wide area network linking government departments and entities\nincluding those in remote and outlying islands (networking component); (ii) in the interactions\nbetween the Government and the business community and citizens in general, including those\nliving  in  the  outer  islands  (applications  component);  and  (iii)  in  the  telecommunications\n(telecoms)  sector  through  sector  reform  (sector  reform  component).  Since  each  of  these\ncomponents could be implemented separately, for purposes of the economic analysis each\nshould be justified in its own right.  However, the three areas of improvement form a logical\npackage and are mutually reinforcing.  Also, when all three improvements are implemented\nsuccessfully, the benefits of the whole package are likely to be larger than the sum of the three\nas self-standing components.\n2.  The economic analysis calculated the economic costs and benefits comparing the \u201cwith-\nProject\u201d and \u201cwithout-Project\u201d situations. The economic life of the project facilities was assumed\nto be 15 years with no residual value at the end of the evaluation period, taking into account the\ncost elements of each component, e.g., the networking component consists of fiber optic cable\ninfrastructure, networking equipment, and labor for designing, installation, configuration, and\ntesting, and the application component comprises largely labor for designing. All cost elements\nare valued at border prices, using a world price numeraire, with all taxes and duties excluded. A\nstandard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to nontraded items and labors.\nB. Networking\n1. Various Options for Networking\n3.  The government network can be laid in two ways: first by using carrier-based services,\nand second by deploying the Government\u2019s own network. The incumbent monopoly service\nprovider currently offers 64 kilobyte per second private line facilities within Male, which provide\ninsufficient capacity to support the expected throughput of the government network. Although\nhigh-speed links for private lines could overcome capacity limitations, the incumbent operator\nhas no incentive to develop such services, as few private sector customers need them. Frame\nrelay1  services  provide  a  virtual  private  line  network  with  enhanced  capabilities  for  both\nmanagement  and  flexibility.  The  incumbent  operator,  however,  does  not  offer  frame  relay\nservices, nor does the private sector have sufficient capacity to require this service within Male.\n4.  Asynchronous  digital  subscriber  line  (ADSL)  could  be  used  for  parts  of  the  Male\ngovernment network if available from the incumbent operator. The incumbent operator does not\noffer ADSL services, and is doubtful about the feasibility of offering them because of several\ntechnical problems. Furthermore, ADSL is not the most appropriate technology for providing a\nweb  environment  for  government  ministries  because  of  asymmetric  transmission  speed.\nIntegrated services digital network which the incumbent operator plans to offer, will be an ideal\ntechnology for the atoll network, but not for Male network because of its limited capacity.\nAsynchronous transfer mode (ATM) technology offers the capacity, flexibility, and management\ncapabilities that would be needed long into the future for the Male government network. The\n                                                          \n1  Highspeed transmission method, switching packets of data through its network to their destination. Access to the\nnetwork is via frame relay access devices which translates the data into frame relay packets.", "52\nAppendix 10, page 2\nincumbent operator, however, does not offer ATM services, nor does it have the fiber optic\ninfrastructure on which ATM operates.\n5.  Two technologies could be considered in developing a government-deployed network:\nwireless and fiber optic cable. The deployment of a wireless Male government network will\nrequire extensive development of local expertise to ensure that it will be able to meet the non\nstop operational needs of the Government. Moreover, the use of a new technology to support a\ncritical function imposes far too great a risk to be borne by the Government. The government\nnetwork should be designed so that no single failure can cause a complete system failure.\nAccordingly, a robust and fault-tolerant communication technology is required, which is provided\nby a high performance fiber optic dual ring network. The multilayer switching campus of a fiber\noptic network provides the reliability, flexibility, and support for long-term growth. Low-level\ncommunications and high-level networking and transport functions can be readily replaced as\ncommunications needs and technology expertise within the Government evolve over time. An\noptical fiber-based government-deployed network is a least-cost, technologically viable option in\nthe medium- and long-term perspective.\n2. Benefits and Beneficiaries\n6.  The  benefits  of  the  establishment  of  a  government  network  are  wide  ranging,  and\ninclude improved efficiency, transparency, and accountability of government activities. More\nspecifically, decision making can be improved, and the cost of government activities can be\nreduced through (i) reduced cost of data collection, (ii) faster processing and availability of\ninformation, (iii) wider availability of information and data in a uniform format across all branches\nof government, (iv) reductions in travel and paper transmission between offices and islands, and\n(v) more effective communication between the various branches of government. Some benefits\nare direct, while others are indirect. The beneficiaries of these improvements are all citizens\nwho will benefit from more efficient management of the nation\u2019s resources.\n7.  Not all of these benefits, such as greater accountability and transparency of government,\nlend themselves to easy measurement and quantification. The increased productivity in routine\noperations and activities, however, can be quantified, as this translates into more output with\ngiven human resources; or alternatively, this greater productivity will allow current output levels\nto be maintained with reduced human resources. For example, in the Ministry of Education,\ninternal reporting from the schools to the ministry headquarters involves a large amount of data\nthat are currently processed manually.  Electronic reporting by the schools will avoid double or\ntriple inputting and validation of data, and will also avoid various data processing activities.\n3. Economic Analysis\n8.  In view of the above, the key parameters of the economic analysis are (i) the nature of\nthe  benefits  that  are  taken  into  consideration,  i.e.,  the  increased  productivity  in  routine\noperations and associated savings in personnel numbers and costs; and (ii) the scale at which\nthese savings will be realized, i.e., the demand aspect.  This second parameter relates to the\nlevel of usage of the network at the time of introduction and the pace at which it will grow over\ntime.  Usage (or demand) will depend very much on (i) the design of the networking system \u2013\nhow user friendly it is and how obvious the advantages will be for its users; (ii) the phase-in\narrangements, and the preparation and training that will be provided; and (iii) the commitment\non the part of the Government to rapid transition from a predominantly paper-based mode of\noperation to a predominantly paperless mode.", "53\nAppendix 10, page 3\n9.  In estimating initial usage and growth in usage, the following factors have been taken\ninto account:  (i) the high level of commitment of the Government towards networking, inter alia,\nbecause once the infrastructure and applications have been made operational their use on a\ndaily basis entails limited cost, while continued use of the old fragmented legacy systems will\noverburden staff; (ii) the Government\u2019s personnel policies, which are aimed at curbing the rate\nof growth in personnel and at redesigning government functions and activities, i.e., through clear\njob descriptions and an appropriate reward system; (iii) the relatively positive attitudes toward\nnetworking and the general level of receptivity of government staff to a predominantly paperless\nmode of operation as revealed through discussions during appraisal; and (iv) the accompanying\nmeasures that the Government would introduce to make a rapid, yet effective, transition to\nnetworking, learning from experiences in other countries and other organizations, including in\nthe Maldives, and cognizant of the attitudes and resistance of government workers to change\nwhen change is poorly prepared.     \n10.  Thus, the economic analysis focuses on the savings in government employment made\npossible following the improved productivity of staff through networking. The Government\u2019s\nexisting personnel policies, which aim at reducing the rate of growth in government employment\nwhile meeting the needs of a growing population, represent the frame of reference for the\n\u201cwithout\u201d the Project case.  Under the \u201cwith\u201d the Project case this natural growth in government\nservices  could  be  provided  with  existing  staff  resources (cid:190)   after  allowing  for  a  three-year\ntransition period (cid:190)  through increased efficiencies obtained from networking.\n11.  The  number  of  personnel  that  is  consistent  with  current  government  policies  and\npractices has been estimated for the \u201dwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d the Project scenarios based on the\nfollowing.\n(i) For the without the Project scenario: it is estimated that during the first five years\nof the project period the annual increase in the Government employment would\nbe on the order of 300, or 1.5 percent of the existing establishment. This rate of\ngrowth is significantly less than the actual growth during recent years but reflects\nthe Government\u2019s policy to contain growth. During the remainder of the project\nperiod the increase would be 1 percent per annum.\n(ii)  Under the with the Project case: during the first three years, employment would\ncontinue to grow at the same pace as in the without the Project case or 1.5\npercent.  Starting in the fourth year after the installation of the intranet, however,\nowing to the efficiencies achieved through the networking, there would be no\nfurther growth in government employment. During the initial three-year period,\nsignificant  change  in  the  skill  mix  would  take  place,  as  there  would  be  an\nexpansion  of  ICT  personnel  while  traditional  skills  relating  to  the  manual\nprocesses would not reduce at a corresponding rate.\n12.  Based on the above outlined differences in personnel numbers between \u201cwith\u201d and\n\u201cwithout\u201d the Project, the savings in government personnel amount to 309 staff five years after\nthe start of the investment, growing to more than 2,960 after 15 years.\n13.  The economic cost of networking at mid-2001 prices, including base cost plus 5 percent\nfor physical contingencies, net of taxes and duties and adjusted with the standard conversion\nfactor for the Maldives, amounts to Rf71.4 million. Annual maintenance and operating costs are\nestimated at Rf6.5 million. The average annual salary cost of government personnel whose\nnumbers would be reduced in the with the Project case is estimated at Rf35,000 (salary plus", "54\nAppendix 10, page 4\nbenefits).  The  savings  in  government  payroll  expenditures,  adjusted  with  the  standard\nconversion factor for the Maldives, would grow from Rf9.7 million in the fifth year following the\nstart of implementation to Rf93.2 million in year 15 after implementation. On this basis, the\neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) is calculated as 19 percent (Table A10.1).\n4. Sensitivity and Risk Analysis\n14.  The above results are sensitive to the rate at which the efficiencies will effectively be\nachieved, i.e., Government\u2019s ability to stabilize employment levels. The impact of a slower pace\nin achieving the efficiencies has been tested as follows: If the savings in government personnel\nwere 25 percent less than assumed in the base case, the EIRR would still be 15 percent with a\nswitching value of 0.85. If the stabilization in the total number of government personnel would\noccur after five years instead of after three years as assumed in the base case, the EIRR would\nbe 13 percent with a switching value of 0.64. The risk that these personnel reduction objectives\nwill not be achieved is small, given that the Government has already initiated a policy to contain\nthe growth of its personnel.\nC. E-government2 Applications\n15.  The applications that would be financed under the Project have each been evaluated\nseparately, as outlined below.\n1. National Citizen Identity Card Application\n16.  A  large  number  of  government  organizations  require  personal  identification  (ID)\ninformation as a routine input to establish and update records and data bases in order to\nprovide  their  services.  The  benefits  for  government  organizations  of  being  able  to  access\nrelevant core personal ID data (such as ID card number, name, complete address, date and\nplace  of  birth,  gender,  blood  group,  parents\u2019  names)  from  the  Department  of  National\nRegistration are numerous and include (i) time savings on account of the key data having to be\ninput only once, (ii) time savings owing to the fact that the data do not need checking when\nbeing accessed, (iii) automatic update for all users of any changes in the core data, and (iv)\nfacilitation of exchange of data between ministries and agencies as all use the same core ID\ndata. The beneficiaries of this greater efficiency are all the citizens of the nation, who will share\nthe benefits of a more efficient government.\n17.  It follows that three parameters are of critical importance for the economic analysis: (i)\nthe nature and level of the benefit that is taken into consideration, i.e., the various time savings\nidentified above to be realized from accessing and using the personal ID records from the\nnational ID register rather than creating and updating such records in each agency; (ii) the\npotential maximum use that can be made of the application; and (iii) the initial use made of the\napplication and the rate at which the level of use will grow toward the full potential.  Each of\nthese factors is evaluated below starting with the last two, which concern the demand aspect of\nthe analysis.\n18.  Potential Maximum Use. Since the benefits of the National Citizen ID Card application\ncan be fully realized only once the government networking is fully operational, the analysis will\nassume that this is the case and also that all relevant departments will link into the ID Card data\n                                                          \n2  E-government refers to the use by government agencies of information technologies that have the ability to\ntransform relations with citizens, businesses, and other arms of Government.", "55\nAppendix 10, page 5\nbase. Thus, the maximum potential demand is dependent on (i) the departments that are linked\nto the National Citizen ID Card application, and (ii) the number of functions and applications in\nthese  departments  that  require  basic  ID  information.  Detailed  estimates  of  the  number  of\ninstances each department has to create/access a personal record have been developed based\non a review of the mission and activities of each department in serving its various client groups,\nincluding  students,  businesses,  households,  and  citizens  in  general.  The  departments  and\norganizations that were considered included: Immigration, Inland Revenue, National Hospital,\nCustoms, Male\u2019 Municipality, Atoll Administration, National Security, Education, Finance, Health,\nLabor, Justice, Trade, Transport, and Youth.  For some of these, such as the Immigration\nDepartment in its monitoring of foreign workers, more than one access to the ID data base per\nyear was assumed.  On this basis, the number of instances where the various departments\nwould access the core ID information from the National ID database was estimated at 1.4 million\nannually.\n19.  Initial Use and Growth Towards Full Potential. The initial use of the ID data base by\nthe various departments will depend on the quality of the design of the application, the training\nprovided to those who will use the application, the quality of preparation prior to generalized\nintroduction, and the level of commitment of the Government toward an effective introduction of\nthis application.  It is considered that, even under the best of circumstances, full maximum\nimplementation of the application will not be achieved during the first year. For the economic\nanalysis the following ramp up toward the maximum potential has been assumed: the first year\nafter introduction, only 50 percent of potential use; second year, 75 percent; third year, 90\npercent; and fourth year, 100 percent.  Thereafter, access would grow in line with the growth of\npopulation in general, at about 2 percent per annum.\n20.  Time Savings. Time savings can be made by the relevant departments because they\nwill not need to enter the information themselves, nor need to update by themselves the core\npersonal ID data, nor to have to verify the accuracy of the basic ID data. These time savings are\nestimated at a total of 15 minutes per interaction/transaction. The hourly time cost (based on\nsalary plus benefits) of government personnel whose time is saved in the process is estimated\nat Rf21.\n21.  The cost of developing the application for providing this interface with all other users in\nthe Government, after adjustment with the standard conversion factor, is estimated at Rf10.1\nmillion. The annual operating cost is estimated at Rf0.92 million. On this basis, the EIRR is\ncalculated  as  42  percent  (Table  A10.2).  This  outcome  is  sensitive  to  the  pace  at  which\nministries will be linking in the National ID registry for their routine needs and the assumption of\nthe time saved each time the central ID database is accessed. If it takes six years for the full\npotential  to  be  reached,  the  EIRR  would  be  31  percent  with  a  switching  value  of  0.56.\nFurthermore,  if  in  addition  only  10  minutes  would  be  saved  each  time  the  data  base  is\naccessed, the EIRR would still be 21 percent with a switching value of 0.85.\n2. Hospital Information System\n22.  Improving information management within the public hospital and linking it into the\ngovernment network will not only reduce operating costs of the hospital through increased\nefficiency,  but  also  enhance  patient  care  by  enabling  electronic  provision  of  medical\nconsultation. The potential efficiencies arising from the use of ICT within a hospital setting\ninclude (i) single patient registration; (ii) instant availability of medical records; (iii) reduction in\nunnecessary  (or  redundant)  physician  orders;  (iv)  reduction  in  adverse  drug  events;  (v)\nreduction in chart pulls; (vi) improved turnaround of test results; (vii) elimination of paper; and", "56\nAppendix 10, page 6\n(viii)  detailed,  real-time  cost  information  available  by  department  or  procedure.  These\nefficiencies  translate  into  time  savings  of  scarce  personnel,  physicians,  and  support  staff\nwhereby the same staff is able to attend to a larger number of patients. These are the direct\nbenefits that are quantified for this evaluation. Other benefits, which include the benefits from\ntelemedicine (which also result in time cost and travel cost savings by patients in the outer\nislands), better quality of patient care, and faster decision making in urgent situations, have not\nbeen estimated.\n23.  From the standpoint of operating efficiencies and the introduction of ICT a hospital is\ncomparable to a business.  ICT is introduced in a planned and controlled way according to a\ncarefully planned schedule and based on a design that meets the requirements of the nature of\nthe business and the operating environment. The main challenge is one of correct design\nwhereby  supply  and  demand  are  carefully  equated  at  the  design  stage  so  as  to  achieve\nappropriate return on the investment. Nevertheless, at this point, it is possible to quantify the\nproductivity improvements that can be achieved based on a broad comparison of operating\nindicators of hospitals at different efficiency levels. The key factors for the economic analysis\nare therefore (i) efficiency levels actually achieved in comparable country settings and which\ncan be achieved in the Maldives, (ii) the time savings and associated cost savings in the various\nprocedures and treatments that can obtained through these higher efficiency levels, and (iii) the\nefficiency level that can be achieved in the initial years following introduction of the ICT and the\nnumber of years it will take to achieve the efficiency of well managed hospitals in a comparable\ncountry setting.  Each of these factors is evaluated below.\n24.  The scope for improved efficiency is estimated by comparing broad productivity ratios\nobtained under current, mostly manual, operating procedures with ratios that can be obtained in\na  modern  ICT  environment  as  evidenced  by  hospitals  in  comparable  settings  that  have\nintroduced these technologies. That it is possible to achieve these levels in the Maldivian\ncontext has already been demonstrated at the other main hospital in Male. Current productivity\nlevels\u2013in terms of activity per doctor and activity per unit of other staff \u2013 have been derived from\na review of operating indicators at the hospital.  Achievable productivity levels have been\ndeveloped from current productivity levels. For doctors it is estimated that a 25 percent increase\nin productivity can be achieved, while for other staff a 90 percent increase should be feasible.\n25.  Taking into account the Maldivian context it is assumed that these improvements will be\nintroduced  progressively  in  steps  over  a  four-year  period  following  introduction  of  the  ICT\nsystem.  During the first year, the efficiency would only be 25 percent of the full potential; the\nsecond year this would rise to 50 percent, and to 75 percent during the third year. By the fourth\nyear the full potential would be achieved. The increased productivity would be absorbed mostly\nby the natural growth in the volume of activity of the hospital that is estimated to be 10 percent\nbased on past trends. To the extent that not all of the productivity growth of support and\nadministrative staff would be absorbed by increasing levels of activity, the staff savings would\nbe absorbed through attrition.\n26.  The annual cost (salary plus benefits) of a doctor is estimated at Rf144,000, while the\ncost of other staff is estimated at Rf36,000. When the full potential of productivity gains has\nbeen achieved, annual savings would amount to Rf21.7 million (at 2001 levels of activity). Not\nall  these  savings  can  necessarily  be  attributed  to  the  introduction  of  ICT  as  efficient\nmanagement procedures also play an important role in improving overall efficiency. Thus, it is\nassumed conservatively that 50 percent of these savings can be attributed to the introduction of\nICT.", "57\nAppendix 10, page 7\n27.  The development cost of the application is estimated at Rf18.9 million net of taxes and\nduties and after adjustment with the standard conversion factor. Annual operating costs are\nestimated at 10 percent of investment costs. Based on the above, the EIRR is calculated as 35\npercent (Table A10.3). This outcome is sensitive to the pace at which the productivity gains\nwould be introduced. If it is assumed that it will take six years to achieve the full potential in\nproductivity gains the EIRR is still 29 percent with a switching value of 0.43.\n3. Vessel, Vehicle, and Aircraft Registration Application\n28.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  issues  numerous  permits  and  licenses  relating  to  the\nownership and operation of seacraft, land vehicles, and aircraft.  Most of these licenses need to\nbe renewed on an annual basis. Currently, obtaining a permit or a renewal of a permit can\nrequire more than one personal trip to the ministry\u2019s offices in Male. At least one of such trips\ncould be avoided by providing the opportunity for completing on-line some of the interaction with\nthe ministry. For Male residents the benefits would comprise the time savings from avoiding the\ntrip to the ministry\u2019s office and for residents of the atolls the benefits would comprise both the\ntime and transport cost savings associated with that trip. For residents of the atolls a trip to a\ngovernment office can involve several days, depending on the distance to be covered. For more\nthan half the atolls this would involve a trip by air, as the distance to be covered is not a feasible\noption by seacraft. The cost involved in these trips is an important impediment to economic\nactivity in the atolls. The beneficiaries of the capability of providing part of the services on-line\ncomprise (i) the businesses and citizens who already have the means to access the Internet;\nand (ii) the lower income groups, where computer penetration is low, and for whom the usage\nfees are prohibitively high and who in the future would obtain access to e-government services\nthrough the Internet kiosks.\n29.  The key parameters for the economic evaluation are therefore (i) the potential maximum\nnumber of transactions that could be carried out electronically, i.e., the potential demand; (ii) the\nnumber of transactions that would be carried out electronically in the initial years following the\nlaunch of the application, and the growth in subsequent years toward the potential maximum;\nand (iii) the unit savings in terms of time and travel costs for Male and atoll residents. These\nfactors will be examined in detail below starting with the first two, which relate to demand\naspects.\n30.  The maximum potential number of interactions/transactions between the ministry and its\nclient public, or the potential demand, is the total number of permits, registrations, and licenses\nto be issued annually. Based on a careful review of the number of seacraft, land vehicles, and\naircraft in use; the number of operators; and the various permits in effect, it is estimated that by\n2003 some 27,500 permits of various kinds would need to be obtained or renewed. Of this total\n16,200 would be from Male and 11,300 from the atolls.\n31.  The number of transactions that would be carried out electronically in the initial years\nfollowing the launch of the application has been estimated based on the following: (i) the\nInternet access and usage survey shows that 70 percent3 of households and 86 percent of\nbusinesses in Male, and 12 percent of households in a typical atoll locality, have Internet\naccess;  (ii)  the  survey  shows  that,  of  those  who  have  access,  77  percent  expressed  the\nintention to interact/transact with the Government if the possibility would be offered; and (iii) in\nother countries, when motor vehicle administrations start providing services on-line, public use\n                                                          \n3  The access rate per 100 units of population was found to be 23 percent; this reflects the fact that often more than\none person in the household is accessing the Internet.", "58\nAppendix 10, page 8\nof this facility is substantial\u2013exceeding 20 percent in the initial year. Based on the above, it is\nassumed that in the first year of availability of an on-line service, 15 percent of trips associated\nwith these permits would be avoided.  Growth in this percentage has been developed taking into\naccount  (i)  the  continued  strong  growth  in  computer  ownership;  (ii)  the  fact  that  the\nGovernment\u2019s  telecoms  sector  development  plan  provides  for  continued  improvements  in\ntelecoms access in the atolls, and further reductions in access and user charges (high access\nand usage charges are at present a major impediment to Internet usage in the Maldives); (iii) a\nprice elasticity of Internet usage greater than 1 as revealed by the Internet access and usage\nsurvey; and (iv) that, as a result of the sector reform under the Project, Internet access and\nusage fees will be lowered by 50 percent. On this basis it is assumed, that at the end of the\nevaluation period, the percentage of trips being avoided through Internet use will have risen to\n70 percent.  Accordingly, the number of trips saved grows from 4,125 in the first year of\nintroduction to 33,335 after 15 years.\n32.  The time and transport cost savings have been developed for atoll and Male residents,\nrespectively, as follows: For Male residents the trip time that can be saved through on-line\ninteraction with the ministry is estimated at 80 minutes based on the findings of the Internet\naccess and usage survey; and the time cost is estimated at Rf29 per hour saved, including\nsalary plus benefits. For atoll residents, the key parameters for the estimation of the time cost\nsavings are (i) average travel distance to Male from the atolls, calculated at 251 kilometers\nbased on an average distance of the atolls to Male weighted by population size of the atolls; (ii)\naverage total trip duration in blocks of working days, estimated at three working days comprising\none day for the outward journey, one day for the transaction at government offices, and one day\nfor the return trip; and (iii) time cost, estimated at Rf29 including salary plus benefits per hour\nsaved and at Rf230 for a one-day work block.\n33.  For  estimating  the  resource  costs  associated  with  the  actual  trip  to  Male  for  atoll\nresidents, the following are key considerations: At the margin the resource cost associated with\na single trip is negligible since the interisland vessel would be sailing in any event with or\nwithout that single trip. The same holds for residents of atolls further afield who would be\ntravelling by air. However, over time and when a significant reduction in travel is brought about\nthrough  replacement  of  traditional  procedures  involving  personal  visits  by  e-government\ninteractions, a reduction in the fleet size will ensue. This reduction in the volume of interisland\ntransport represents a saving in resource costs. For a single trip this saving can be equated with\nthe fare that represents the long-run marginal cost of interisland transport by sea or by air. On\nthis basis the resource cost associated with the weighted average trip distance is estimated at\nRf1,493.\n34.  The development cost of the application is estimated at Rf7.6 million net of taxes and\nduties and after adjustment with the standard conversion factor. Annual operating costs are\nestimated at 30 percent of investment costs. Since there would be overcapacity in the intranet,\nthe marginal economic cost of the line usage can be assumed to be zero. Based on the above\nassumptions, the EIRR of this application is calculated as 40 percent (Table A10.4). This\noutcome is very sensitive to the estimate of travel cost savings obtained by atoll residents.\nAssuming that these savings would be only 50 percent of those assumed in the base case, the\nEIRR would still be 31 percent with a switching value of 0.73.\n4. Internet Kiosks\n35.  The 20 network access sites to be established at atoll offices would provide a common\npoint  of  access  through  which  businesses  and  individual  citizens  can  access  the  various", "59\nAppendix 10, page 9\ngovernment  websites,  initially  to  obtain  information  but  progressively  to  interact  with  the\ngovernment  and  ultimately  to  carry  out  transactions  as  more  and  more  applications  are\ndeveloped. The kiosks specifically target the population who do not have access to the Internet\nthrough either a computer at a school, an office, or a business4 and for whom access to the\nInternet and hence to e-government services is prohibitively high because of the cost of both the\nterminal computer stations and the Internet usage charges. The kiosks will accordingly aid the\npoor who cannot afford to have their own computer and pay for Internet charges in getting\naccess to e-government services. The economic and social benefits of the kiosks are expected\nto justify the modest initial investment costs amounting to Rf3.7 million. A monitoring system will\nbe set up to closely track the usage of the kiosks and assess whether the expected economic\nand social benefits are realized. The expansion of the kiosks to other islands will be based on\nthe result of this benefit monitoring.\n36.  The kiosks will be linked into the atoll network that is part of the Government\u2019s wide area\nnetwork. As a result, public access to government information through the kiosks will not give\nrise to any additional financial outlays compared with the situation where there will be no kiosks.\nIn the long run there is no risk that this public access will either have a substantial impact on\ngovernment finances or become unsustainable.  It is expected that, with the rapid growth of\ncomputer workstations in households and businesses, the need for free public access to the\nkiosks will not run out of hand. Once Internet access and usage fees have come down and\nbroader sections of the population have direct Internet access from a business, or from home,\nthe free internet/intranet kiosk will primarily be an opportunity for the lower income sections of\nthe population. But providing this opportunity is an objective that is well worth pursuing and\nsupporting under the Project.\nD. Overall Rate of Return of the Project\n37.  The combined costs and benefits of the components and subcomponents are shown in\nTable A10.5. The total costs include all the investment and operating costs related to the\ngovernment network component and the application component, including those of the kiosks.\nThe total benefits include the benefits calculated with respect to these components except for\nthe kiosk component. The overall rate of return of the project is calculated as 25 percent.\n38.  When all the negative scenarios, as analyzed for each component, are combined, the\nEIRR is calculated as 15 percent for the overall Project.\n                                                          \n4  The Internet access and usage survey found that access to the Internet through a computer at school, in the office,\nin the family, or at an Internet caf\u00e9 is about 25 percent more frequent than access from a computer at home. This\nindicates that there is a strong case for the Internet kiosk for those sections of the population that do not have\nthese alternatives.", " 60\nAppendix 10, page 10\nTable A10.1: EIRR for
