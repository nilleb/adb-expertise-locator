The proposed ICT project was intended to (i) establish a wide area network linking all\nthe  government  organizations  and  the  parastatal  institutions  in  Male,  (ii)  develop  a\nfundamental  set  of  application  systems  based  on  the  Internet  to  take  advantage  of  the\ngovernment  network,  and  (iii)  foster  a  team  of  national  experts  in  the  areas  of  wide  network\nand Worldwide Web technologies.\n\n3. \nIn 2000, the Government requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide a loan\nfor a project based on the GNM Study as a succession of the technical assistance (TA) for the\nScience  and  Technology  Master  Plan.1  A  Reconnaissance  Mission  fielded  in  October  2000\nreviewed  the  GNM  Study  with  the  Government,  and  agreed  to  formulate  an  ICT  project  with\nthe  basic  features  of  the  GNM  Study,  but  with  some  extension  of  its  scope  and  inclusion  of\ntelecommunications \nInformation  Technology\nreform \nDevelopment  Project  was  included  in  ADB\u2019s  Country  Assistance  Plan  for  the  Maldives  for\n2001.  Subsequently,  in  December  2000,  ADB  approved  project  preparatory  TA2  to  redesign\nthe Project and to conduct a feasibility study. A Fact-Finding Mission3 visited the Maldives 16-\n26 April 2001. A Loan Appraisal Mission4 was conducted during 17-27 September 2001. This\nreport is based on the understandings reached with the Government during those missions as\nwell as on further dialogue and agreement with the Government. The project framework is in\nAppendix 1.\n\n(telecoms)  sector \n\nissues.  The \n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nThe Telecommunications Sector\n\n1.\n\nSector Development\n\n4. \nTelecoms  services  in  Maldives  consist  of  fixed  line  local  and  long  distance  (including\ninternational) telephone services, cellular mobile access, telex, paging, packet switched data,\nand  Internet  services.  All  such  services  are  provided  solely  by  Dhiraagu,  a  joint  venture\ncompany  formed  by  the  Government  and  the  Cable  and  Wireless  Corporation  of  the  United\nKingdom  in  1988.  With  its  right  of  exclusivity  for  basic  voice  services  renewed  in  1995,\nDhiraagu\u2019s  current  license  continues  until  2009.  Responsibility  for  regulation  of  Dhiraagu\u2019s\n                                                          \n1  TA 3405-MLD: Science and Technology Master Plan, for $600,000, approved on 2 March 2000.\n2  TA 3597-MLD: Information Technology Development, for $150,000, approved on 19 December 2000.\n3    The  Mission  comprised  Dong-Soo  Pyo,  Senior  Financial  Analyst/Mission  Leader  and  Joris  Van  der  Ven,  staff\nconsultant. The Mission was supported by TA consultants, Bill Jackson, Information Technology Engineer/Team\nLeader;  Stuart  MacPherson,  Telecoms  Sector  Reform  Specialist;  Sobah  Rasheed,  Information  Technology\nSpecialist;  Shuaib  Shah,  Legal  Specialist;  Krishna  Regaraj,  Financial  Specialist;  Asim  Ahmed,  Social  Impact\nSpecialist; and Mariyam Saleem, Environmental Specialist.\n\n4    The  Mission  consisted  of  Dong-Soo  Pyo,  Senior  Financial  Analyst;  Preben  Nielsen,  Deputy  Director,  IWD;  H.\nImamura,  Programs  Officer;  Clare  Wee,  Senior  Counsel;  Joris  Van  der  Ven,  Consultant;  and  P.  Anuradha,\nConsultant.\n\n\f2\n\ntelecoms activities rests with the MCST. However, no statutory legislation is currently in force\nfor  regulation  of  the  telecoms  sector.  A  draft  telecoms  law  was  proposed,  but  no  action  was\ntaken to convert this into formal law; the legislation focused primarily on administrative issues\nand rules for radio frequency allocation.\n\n5. \nThe telecoms infrastructure and services have expanded rapidly over the last decade.\nSince  1997,  the  Maldives  telecoms  system  has  expanded  to  include  the  atolls  of  Shaviyani,\nHaa Dhaalu, and Haa Alifu in the north and has become truly a transnational system. In the\nsouth, Gaafu Alifu, Gaafu Dhaalu, Gnaviyani, and Seenu atolls5 are internally connected by a\nmicrowave  trunk  network  and  very  high  frequency/ultra  high  frequency  radio  links,  and  are\nconnected  to  Male  via  satellite;  major  earth  stations  exist  in  both  Hithadhoo  and  Male.\nUniversal  access  to  telephone  service  was  achieved  in  May  1999  (cid:190)\n  a  substantial  technical\nand  social  achievement.  The  overall  quality  of  telecoms  access  and  service  in  the  Maldives\n(teledensity of 9.0)6 compares very favorably with that found in other countries in the region.\nHowever, improving practical access even further and reducing the relatively high cost of local\nand  long  distance  telephone  use,  cellular  mobile  expense,  and  Internet  access  remain  key\nconcerns.\n\n6. \nA  reasonable  selection  of  residential  and  business  voice  services  is  provided.  The\nmonthly  rental  of  Rf30  ($2.3)  on  inhabited  islands  is  one  of  the  lowest  in  the  world.  The\ninstallation fee of Rf1,720 ($134) is slightly lower than the average for a comparable group of\ncountries.  However,  this  seemingly  reasonable  pricing  scheme  applies  only  to  a  few  islands\n(11 out of 200 where people live) classified by Dhiraagu as inhabited. For uninhabited islands,\nthe  monthly  rental  is  prohibitively  high,  from  Rf3,450  ($270)  for  the  first  telephone,  down  to\nRf1,360  ($106)  per  unit  for  additional  telephones.  Installation  charges  range  from  a  low  of\nRf2,990  ($234)  to  Rf12,650  ($988).  With  these  rates,  the  majority  of  the  population  cannot\nafford  telephone service. The Government is now committed to equalizing or at least adjusting\ntelephone service rates across the country through the establishment of a support scheme for\nuniversal  service.  The  cost  of  a  local  or  interisland  call  is  almost  equal  to  the  average  for  a\ncomparable group of countries.\n\n7. \nInternational  calls  are  tiered,  depending  upon  the  region  or  country  called,  with  rates\nvarying  from  Rf23  ($1.80)  per  minute  to  Rf55  ($4.30)  per  minute,  the  latter  applying  to  all  of\nthe world outside of Asia. Facsimile rates are generally 22-30 percent higher than fixed voice\ncall rates. International calling costs 7-8 times more than the average of the comparable group\nof  countries.  Internet  services  are  also  expensive.  Establishing  an  Internet  account  costs\nRf500 ($39), with time charges of Rf0.55 ($0.04) to Rf1.15 ($0.09) per minute depending on\nthe time of the day. Forty hours of Internet access would cost Rf800 or about $63 as against\naround  $25  in  most  developing  countries.  A  dedicated  leased  line  for  Internet  access  costs\nRf7,000  ($547)  for  installation  and  Rf19,000  ($1,484)  per  month  for  commercial  application\n(Rf14,000 for government, and Rf9,000 for educational institutions). These charges are much\nhigher  than  those  in  the  developed  part  of  the  world,  and  higher  than  in  many  developing\ncountries.\n\nMobile  services,  originally  introduced  as  analogue,  were  recently  upgraded  to  digital\n8. \ncapability. There are currently 8,000 customers, and growth continues at a sound rate. Mobile\ncharges  comprise  a  connection  fee  of  Rf1,000  ($78)  and  a  monthly  fee  of  Rf150  ($12).  Call\n\n                                                          \n5  The word \u201catoll\u201d has its origin in the Maldives. It refers to a group of islands normally consisting of a coral reef\nsurrounding a lagoon. For administrative purposes, each atoll is one of 20 administrative units of the Maldives.\n\n6  The teledensity is defined as the number of telephone lines per one hundred people.\n\n\f3\n\ncharges range from Rf2.0 ($0.16) to Rf2.5 ($0.20) per minute, depending upon the time of day.\nThe rates for air time are in the average range for the comparable group of countries.\n\n2.\n\nSector Regulation\n\n  policy  making,  regulation,  and  operations  (cid:190)\n\n9. \nThe regulatory framework in the telecoms sector shows the typical nondivision of policy\nmaking  and  regulation  functions.  The  regulatory  function  rests  with  the  Director  General  of\nPost  and  Telecommunications  Department  under  MCST,  who  is  also  responsible  for  policy\ndevelopment and strategic planning of the telecoms sector. This vague demarcation of the two\nfunctions is made more complicated by another responsibility resting with the Director General\n    that  of  a  board  member  of  Dhiraagu,  the  monopoly  service  provider.  Consequently,\nvirtually  all  three  functions  (cid:190)\n  are  mixed  and\ninvolve the Director General. The board of Dhiraagu consists of seven members, four of whom\nare government officials (cid:190)\n the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Trade and Industries,\nthe Managing Director of the Transport and Contracting Company, and the Director General.\nThe  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  holds  the  chairmanship  of  the  board.  Under  this  framework,\nindependent  regulatory  decisions  by  the  Director  General  cannot  be  expected.  Moreover,\nsince  the  Director  General,  as  a  board  member  of  Dhiraagu,  serves  the  benefits  of  the\noperator  under  the  chairmanship  of  a  senior  government  official,  the  regulatory  role  tends  to\nbe  overshadowed  by  other  conflicting  agenda,  and  consequently  becomes  weakened.  This\nstructure might have been justified at its inception by the need to maintain the profitability of\nDhiraagu,  and  at  the  same  time  to  extend  service  into  new  locations  and  build  infrastructure\nfor  new  telecoms  technologies;  however,  with  this  conflicting  interrelationship  between  the\nregulator and the operator, the regulator cannot cause Dhiraagu to lower rates, which currently\npromote an excess return on capital, thus resulting in disservice to customers.\n\n10. \nEffective  telecoms  access  consists  of  both  physical  access  to  the  system  and  the\nability to afford to use the system in an efficient manner. Currently, the telephone and Internet\nphysical access provided by Dhiraagu partly satisfies the first condition for telephone services,\nbut less so for Internet access, which is often connected at below-capacity speeds and is often\nundependable outside Male. The costs of telephone service, especially international calls and\nInternet access are almost prohibitive for economic use.\n\n11. \nThe affordability of telecoms services can be improved by promoting competition in the\nmarket  and  introducing  an  appropriate  regulatory  regime.  Government  policy  foresees  the\nintroduction of new Internet service providers into the Internet market as a means of improving\nthe  affordability  of  these  services.  Cellular  mobile  service  and  long  distance  calling  are  both\npotentially profitable activities for private providers and could draw private sector interest. The\npresent  system  of  intranational  telephone  services,  however,  exists  as  a  natural  monopoly,\nand  it  is  unlikely  that  any  private  competitor  would  find  it  profitable  to  enter  the  market.  An\nindependent  and  transparent  regulatory  regime,  therefore,  emerges  as  an  important  issue  to\nensure the affordability of telecoms services.\n\n3.\n\nGovernment Network\n\n12. \nThe Science and Technology Master Plan found that several ministries were operating\nlocal  area  networks.  Some  of  these  were  peer-to-peer  networks  used  for  file  sharing,  some\nprovided basic services such as email, but most organizations actually made minimal use of\nsuch  facilities.  In  some  cases,  what  had  been  described  as  the  \u201cnetwork\u201d  was  actually\nconfined  to  a  few  machines  in  a  single  room.  The  vast  majority  of  workstations  had  no\nconnection  to  any  other  workstation  in  the  facility.  Slow  dial-up  connections  and  caps  on\n\n(cid:190)\n\f4\n\nInternet costs imposed by many ministries discouraged access to other services and facilities\nthrough the Internet.\n\n13. \nApplication  development  has  also  been  hindered  because  the  underlying  traditional\nprocesses  and  ministerial  cultures  seem  fundamentally  inconsistent  with  the  nature  of  ICT.\nThe  paper-based  environment  that  has  evolved  over  generations  is  resistant  to  change.\nAlthough ministries are eager  to gather and archive relevant information as required by their\nrespective  missions,  techniques  for  the  retrieval  and  subsequent  use  are  much  less\ndeveloped. There seems to be a strong reluctance to share information, or to rely on another\nministry\u2019s  efforts  or  information.  This  leads  to  duplication  and  errors  in  the  combined\nGovernment operations.\n\nThere is insufficient understanding of how ICT can be applied at senior levels within the\n14. \nGovernment. While all high officials have a personal computer, few use them effectively. This\ntends to be extended throughout the use of ICT. Many strive to acquire the technology without\nunderstanding  that  possession  of  technology  does  not  equate  to  its  effective  use.  Further,\ncommunication  costs  and  the  existing  regulatory  environment  are  huge  disincentives  to  the\nexpanded use of ICT, especially for wide area application such as \u201ce-government.\u201d7\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Sector Objectives and Plans\n\n1.\n\nTelecommunications Sector\n\n15. \nTaking  into  account  these  conditions  and  the  national  development  priorities  of  the\nMaldives, the Government has decided to move toward a more open competitive environment\nin the telecoms system. This move is reinforced by the international trend in telecoms markets\nto contestability and competition, and the World Trade Organization protocol on liberalization\nof markets for telecoms.\n\n16. \nIn  this  context,  the  Government,  based  on  the  recommendations  of  the  Science  and\nTechnology Master Plan, intends to make the policy decisions to (i) establish a new regulatory\nregime to allow for effective management of monopoly and dominant behaviors to the extent\nnecessary to facilitate an efficient transition to a contestable market for telecoms services; (ii)\nenact  new  legislation  that  will  regulate  the  telecoms  industry  in  an  independent  and\ntransparent  manner,  encourage  competition,  and  inhibit  anticompetitive  practices;  and  (iii)\nliberalize the market for Internet services and possibly selected other services not covered by\ncurrent exclusivity arrangements between the Government and Dhiraagu.\n\n17. \nTo  support  implementation  of  the  policy,  the  Government  will  devise  action  plans\nencompassing  (i)  reducing  the  charges  for  telecoms  services,  especially  for  Internet  and\ninternational  call  services,  including  narrowing  the  difference  in  charges  between  Male  and\nuninhabited islands; (ii) providing universal service, including expanding mobile services to the\nwhole  country;  (iii)  developing  an  independent  regulatory  body  equipped  with  financial\nautonomy;  (iv)  opening  up  markets  to  competition  for  those  services  for  which  Dhiraagu  has\nno exclusivity rights; (v) minimizing any adverse impact of tariff restructuring on fiscal revenue\nby  pursuing  expansion  of  the  revenue  base;  (vi)  improving  telecoms  facilities  and  upgrading\ntelecoms services as a way of attracting foreign investors, including obtaining access to global\nsubmarine cables; and (vii) ultimately transforming the Maldives into an ICT society.\n\n                                                          \n7  E-government  refers  to  the  use  by  government  agencies  of  information  technologies  that  have  the  ability  to\n\ntransform relations with citizens, businesses, and other arms of Government.\n\n\f5\n\n2.\n\nPublic Sector Management\n\n18. \nGood  governance  is  one  of  the  key  development  objectives  highlighted  by  the  Sixth\nNational Development Plan (2001-2005). The establishment of a modern public administration\nis emphasized as a priority goal in the Government\u2019s development agenda. Capacity building\nand  the  upgrading  of  human  resources  to  fill  skills  gaps  have  been  recognized  as  critical\nrequirements  toward  good  governance  to  achieve  improved  performance  of  public  sector\nmanagement.  The  Sixth  Plan  also  emphasizes  regional  development  through  promoting\nequitable  access  to  social  services  and  economic  infrastructure,  which  is  one  of  the  major\nthrusts  pursued  by  the  Project  through  establishing  a  government  network  and  providing  the\npublic with better access to it.\n\nAs  a  way  of  improving  the  efficiency  and  transparency  of  public  sector  management,\n19. \nthe  Government  plans  to  develop  a  common  data  communication  network  between  the\nministries and other parastatal agencies. The government network will be a facility designed to\nsupport communications through virtual networks within ministries, to support the exchange of\ninformation  between  ministries,  and  to  provide  a  secure  gateway  between  the  Government\nand the Internet. The network will comprise two separate components: a metropolitan network\nserving ministry offices located within Male, and a wide area regional network extending from\nMale to serve the atoll capitals and eventually island administration offices.\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n20. \nADB provided TA for the Science and Technology Master Plan (footnote 1) in 2000. As\npart of that TA, a master plan for telecoms and ICT sector development in the Maldives was\nprepared.  In  1999,  UNDP  sponsored  the  GNM  Study,  which  triggered  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in\nthe  sector.  With  the  increasing  importance  of  ICT  for  economic  growth  and  governance\nimprovement,  however,  many  aid  agencies  look  to  the  benefits  of  rationalization  of  the\ntelecoms,  and  ICT  sector  in  Maldives.  The  International  Telecommunications  Union  assisted\nwith  preparation  of  the  telecoms  sector  policy,  which  provided  a  basis  for  the  Maldives\nTelecommunication  Policy  approved  by  the  Government  on  1  August  2001.  UNDP  is\nconsidering  a  support  program  to  conduct  a  study  for  promoting  competition  in  the  Internet\nservice market.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\nOver recent years, a number of studies have concerned for sector policy issues such\n21. \nas  telecoms  policy  review,  telecoms  legislation,  and  telecoms  tariff  strategy  not  only  through\nexternal  assistance  but  also  through  the  Government\u2019s  initiatives.  Despite  a  number  of  well\nthought-out recommendations by those studies to rationalize the telecoms market, few actions\nhave  been  taken  so  far.  ADB\u2019s  intervention  in  the  sector  is  therefore  focused  on\nimplementation of sector reform measures already identified.\n\n22. \nBecause of few past interventions in investment, there is a limited base from which to\ndraw lessons for ADB\u2019s future intervention. However, a useful lesson can be drawn from the\npartial  privatization  of  Dhiraagu  carried  out  by  forming  a  strategic  alliance  with  a  foreign\noperator.  The  strategic  alliance  enabled  efficiency  gains  in  its  operation  by  adopting  the\nadvanced managerial and operational skills of its strategic partner. However, efficiency gains\nhave not been translated into benefits to the consumer, as can be seen from the prohibitively\nhigh tariffs of cellular mobile service, Internet service, or long distance service. It is apparent\nthat  efficiency  gains  rarely  spill  over  to  the  consumer  unless  either  the  market  monopoly  is\nbroken down by opening up the market to competition, or the market is properly regulated by a\n\n\f6\n\nregulator with appropriate  authority. The lesson is that breaking up of a monopolized market\nand  establishment  of  an  independent  regulator  are  more  important  for  the  benefit  of  the\nconsumer than mere privatization of state-owned companies.\n\nE. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n23. \nADB\u2019s  strategic  development  objectives  in  the  Maldives  focus  on  (i)  regional\ndevelopment including the provision of basic infrastructure and capacity building; (ii) creating\nan  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  development,  including  reform  of  the  financial\nsector and the legal system; and (iii) developing an information and communication network in\nthe atolls. To support good governance, ADB will (i) develop improved information access and\npublic  sector  connectivity  and  build  the  capacity  of  key  public  institutions  with  the  aim  of\nimproving  public  sector  management  efficiency;  and  (ii)  assist  the  Government  to  assume\nmore  of  an  enabling  stance  with  respect  to  the  private  sector  and  to  prepare  eventual\ngraduation from least developed country status. The Project, aiming at providing better access\nto  government  information  and  services  and  improving  the  efficiency  and  transparency  of\npublic sector management, will be fully in line with ADB\u2019s development strategy.\n\n24. \nADB\u2019s strategy for the telecoms sector is to establish a national telecoms sector policy\nthat  will  spell  out  the  principles  for  a  sector  regulatory  regime  and  for  restructuring  of  the\ntelecoms  market.  For  the  sector  regulatory  regime,  the  ultimate  goal  ADB  is  pursuing  is  the\nestablishment  of  an  independent  regulatory  body,  the  function  of  which  is  separated  from\npolicy making and service provision. The independent regulatory body should be mandated to\n(i) set technical standards; (ii) license carriers; (iii) regulate carriers\u2019 tariffs; (iv) monitor quality\nof  service  and  initiate  corrective  actions,  if  necessary;  (v)  approve  programs  for  construction\nand  capital \nfor\ninterconnection;  (vii)  control  the  type-approval  of  customer  premise  equipment  and  its\nconnection to the public network; and (viii) consider complaints from users and take corrective\naction, if necessary.\n\nfinancial,  administrative,  and \n\ninvestment; \n\ntechnical \n\n(vi)  set \n\nterms \n\n25. \nRestructuring  of  the  telecoms  market  is  concerned  with  opening  it  up  to  competition,\nand privatization of state-owned operators. ADB\u2019s strategy for market restructuring is to follow\nthe  steps  of  (i)  incorporating  the  dominant  state-owned  operator;  (ii)  liberalizing  value-added\nand other nonbasic services; (iii) sale of a minority share in the dominant state-owned operator\nwith  exclusivity  in  fixed  voice  services  for  a  limited  period  of  time;  (iv)  sale  of  the  majority  of\nshares; (v) removal of exclusivity and opening all services to competition; and (vi) sale of all\nshares, retaining only a symbolic quantity. A sector reform package can be tailored, taking into\naccount the existing regulatory framework and the extent of market restructuring.\n\n26. \nThis  sector  strategy  can  be  reinforced  by  encouraging  appropriate  legislation  to\nimplement the telecoms sector policy. ADB\u2019s intervention in the telecoms sector will, therefore,\naddress passage of telecoms laws that will support telecoms sector reform.\n\n27. \nICT is widely recognized as a potential powerful tool in the fight against world poverty,\nwith the capacity to provide developing countries with an unprecedented opportunity to meet\nvital  development  goals  such  as  poverty  reduction,  basic  health  care,  and  education.\nCountries  that  succeed  in  harnessing  the  potential  of  ICT  can  look  forward  to  greatly\naccelerating  economic  growth,  dramatically  improving  human  welfare,  and  fostering  good\ngovernance  practices.  ADB\u2019s  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  recognized  the  importance  of\nsupporting  ICT  to  promote  development  and  close  the  gap  between  the  information-rich  and\ninformation-poor. ADB\u2019s strategy is to effectively assist developing member countries to have\nincreased  access  to  information  and  to  allow  the  less  privileged  in  society,  and  the  less-\n\n\f7\n\ndeveloped  parts  of  the  region  to  have  wider  options  and  a  greater  role  in  determining  their\nfuture.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n1.\n\nTelecommunications Sector Policy\n\n28. \nSince  the  incumbent  service  provider  is  already  incorporated  with  a  minority  share\nowned by a foreign strategic partner with exclusivity in fixed voice services, the policy dialogue\nbetween ADB and the Government has been focused on (i) establishment of an independent\nregulatory  body,  (ii)  liberalization  of  value-added  and  other  nonbasic  services,  and  (iii)\nenactment  of  a  telecoms  law  that  supports  the  transparent  regulatory  framework  and  the\nliberalization of telecoms markets. On 1 August 2001, the Government approved the Maldives\nTelecommunication Policy 2001-2005 (the Telecoms Policy), which addresses all sector policy\nissues  discussed  and  sets  a  time  frame  for  critical  sector  reform  measures.  The  Telecoms\nPolicy  identifies  six  sector  policy  goals:  (i)  reducing  charges  for  all  telecoms  services;  (ii)\nexpanding  telecoms  services  and  narrowing  the  differences  in  cost  of  service  provision\nbetween  Male  and  the  other  islands;  (iii)  providing  necessary  means  and  legal  powers  to\nstrengthen the role of the regulator through an appropriate legislative framework; (iv) opening\nthe  Maldives  telecoms  market  for  competition;  (v)  making  government  revenues  from  the\ntelecoms  sector  less  dependent  on  the  profit  of  the  sector;  and  (vi)  making  the  Maldives  an\nextensive user of ICT in all aspects of development, thereby setting a replicable example for\nthe South Asia region.\n\n2.\n\nTariff Restructuring and Rebalancing\n\n29. \nThe  large  gap  in  telephone  installation  and  monthly  charges  between  Male  and  the\nother  islands  will  be  reduced  to  achieve  universal  service  provision.  The  gap  between\ninternational and local call charges will be narrowed by reducing the international call charges\nto destinations where there is significant traffic from the Maldives, reducing accounting rates,\nintroducing  additional  international  telephone  services,  and  allowing  wider  use  of  Internet\nphone service. Internet dial-up service will be provided on a virtually free basis by separating\nInternet  charges  from  telephone  usage  charges  and  introducing  flat  rate  usage  packages\ninstead of charging per minute.\n\n30. \nApart  from  these  specific  tariff  restructuring  efforts,  regulatory  efforts  will  also  be\nexercised  to  set  tariffs  based  on  the  cost  of  services.  Service  providers  will  be  required  to\nmaintain separate accounting for different services. Separating mobile service providers from\nfixed service providers and disallowing a service provider to provide both services under one\nroof  will  be  considered  to  ensure  clear-cut  separation  of  accounting  and  to  avoid  cross-\nsubsidization between the two services.\n\n3.\n\nRegulatory Framework and Telecoms Legislation\n\nThe three functions for telecoms sector management (cid:190)\n\n policy making, regulation, and\n31. \nservice provision (cid:190)\n will be separated. The independence of the regulator will be ensured by\nallowing  financial  autonomy  of  the  regulatory  body.  To  support  the  strengthening  of  the\nregulator\u2019s  role,  an  appropriate  legislative  framework  will  be  established  by  enactment  of  a\ntelecoms law.\n\n\f8\n\n4.\n\nOpening Up of Telecoms Markets to Competition\n\n32.  Markets for those telecoms services for which the incumbent operator has no exclusive\nright will be opened to competition. The internet service and mobile telephone service markets\nwill be opened on a fixed schedule. No exclusive right will be allowed to any operator for any\ntelecoms  service  after  the  expiry  of  the  current  operating  license  granted  to  the  incumbent\noperator.  To  facilitate  competition,  the  regulator  will  be  mandated  to  manage  the  national\nnumbering  plan  and  to  allocate  frequency  bands  to  licensees  in  a  transparent  manner.  An\ninterconnection structure will be established to facilitate interconnection and interoperability of\ndifferent networks and services.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n33. \nThe  population  of  the  Maldives  was  around  280,000  in  2000,  spread  among  200\ninhabited  islands.  About  67,000  people  or  24  percent  of  the  population  live  on  the  capital\nisland  of  Male.  There  is  an  inward  migration  trend  from  the  atolls  to  Male  as  people  seek\nemployment  and  better  education.  Those  living  outside  Male  depend  on  fishing,  agriculture,\nand  other  primary  industry-related  activities  for  their  livelihood.  Many  families  depend  on\nmoney  transfers  from  family  members  employed  in  Male  or  on  tourist  resorts.  The\ndecentralization  of  economic  activities  away  from  Male  is  hampered  by  the  lack  of  basic\ninfrastructure  and  the  poorly  developed  interisland  transportation  system.  With  these\ngeographical  and  economical  characteristics,  the  Maldives  has  a  huge  potential  to  take  full\nadvantage of ICT, as it allows distribution of, and access to, information at no cost difference\nregardless  of  different  spatial  distances.  A  majority  of  people  living  in  the  atolls  could  be\nempowered  by  ICT  to  gain  access  to  public  services  at  as  affordable  a  price  as  enjoyed  by\npeople  in  Male.  Even  people  in  Male  could  save  time  and  effort,  again  thanks  to  ICT,  by\nhaving  access  to  public  services  on-line  rather  than  over  the  counter.  Recognizing  this\npotential of ICT, the Government has put forward ICT as its prime tool to promote sustainable\neconomic growth.\n\nICT  has  significantly  changed  the  conventional  concept  of  interaction  between\n34. \nbusinesses  and  between  businesses  and  customers.  Commerce  based  on  ICT  has  almost\nrevolutionized  the  way  of  doing  business,  making  transactions  between  businesses  far  more\nefficient,  and  bringing  customers  much  closer  to  the  businesses.  ICT  has  also  caused  a\nrevolutionary  change  in  doing  government  work,  which  has  brought  about  more  efficiency,\nmore  transparency,  and  more  accountability.  Enormous  efficiency  gains  can  result  from\nnetworking  government  agencies,  which  will  allow  them  to  share  and  exchange  information\non-line.  Disclosure  of  government  information  through  the  Web  will  make  government  more\nopen and accountable. Delivery of government services through the Web will decrease face-\nto-face  contact  with  government  employees,  which  will  lead  to  less  corruption,  and  hence  to\nenhanced governance. Particularly in the Maldives, a small island country, where the majority\nof its people are scattered throughout hundreds of islands, the benefits of e-government will be\nfar more extensive, especially compared with its networking cost.\n\n35. \nThe  benefits  expected  from  networking  government  may  not  accrue  to  the  public\nunless  the  public  is  allowed  to  get  access  to  the  government  network  at  an  affordable  price.\nHigh tariffs for Internet service in many developing countries are attributed to policy failure that\nresults in lack of competition in the telecoms market and lack of appropriate regulation. It has\nbeen  shown  that  countries  with  a  highly  liberalized  telecoms  network  have  costs  of  Internet\naccess several times lower than those with a completely closed market. Countries with more\n\n\f9\n\nopen  telecoms  sectors  also  have  more  host  sites,  lower  monthly  Internet  charges,  a  greater\nnumber of service providers, and higher rates of Internet penetration. In the Maldives, the high\ntariffs of Internet and data transmission services are regarded as a major stumbling block for\nthe  expansion  of  Internet  penetration.  With  the  current  tariff  structure,  the  efforts  of  the\nGovernment to bring the public closer to government information and public services through\ngovernment  networking  will  prove  fruitless.  Telecoms  sector  reform  will,  therefore,  be  an\nindispensable direction that should come along with the Government\u2019s efforts to promote ICT.\n\nThe Project is needed to encourage the Government to take advantage of ICT for its\n36. \npursuit  of  making  government  work  more  efficient,  transparent,  and  accountable,  and  of\ndelivering  better  public  services  to  the  public,  aided  by  the  telecoms  sector  reform  that  will\naccompany the Project.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n37. \nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  efficiency,  transparency,  and\naccountability  of  public  sector  management,  by  networking  government  agencies  and\nproviding public services electronically.\n\n38. \nThe  Project  includes  (i)  networking  of  government  agencies  and  applications  for\ndelivery  of  public  services,  (ii)  establishment  of  the  National  Computer  Center  (NCC),  (iii)\nbuilding  of  Internet  kiosks  in  remote  atolls,  and  (iv)  provision  of  consulting  services  for\nimplementation of telecoms sector reforms.\n\n1. \n\nNetworking and Application\n\n39. \nGovernment ministries and parasatal organizations in Male will be networked through a\nfiber  optic  cable.  The  network  will  be  partitioned  into  three  levels:  the  backbone,  the\ndistribution  layer,  and  the  access  layer.  The  buildings  housing  government  agencies  will  be\ngrouped  into  building  clusters.  Each  of  these  building  clusters  will  have  a  single  point  of\nconnection  to  the  backbone  network.  Larger  building  clusters  will  be  served  by  being\nconnected  to  a  distribution  network.  User  computers  will  be  attached  to  the  network  at  the\naccess  layer.  The  access  layer  is  in  turn  connected  to  the  network  through  a  node  on  the\nbackbone or on a distribution network. The government agencies in Viligili and Hulhule islands\nwill  be  connected  to  the  Government  network,  and  will  comprise  the  Male  network.  The\nnetwork  will  be  designed  primarily  for  data  communications,  however  the  design  will\naccommodate future applications such as video teleconferencing.\n\n40. \nTwenty  outer  atolls  will  be  networked  under  the  Project  relying  on  carrier  service\nofferings. The network can be extended to other atolls, and further to other islands within each\natoll in a phased manner in the future. Initially the network to the outer atolls will be connected\nto the atoll offices.\n\n41. \nThe  Project  will  establish  a  transactional  portal  site  for  individual  citizens  and\nbusinesses. The portal site will offer citizens and businesses a range of services from which\nthey  can  select  those  that  apply  to  their  own  circumstances.  The  services  that  can  be\naccessed  through  the  portal  will  depend  on  the  underlying  progress  made  by  government\nagencies  and  departments  in  their  on-line  service  delivery.  Through  the  Project,  applications\nfor  national  citizen  identification;  public  health  service;  and  vessel,  aircraft,  and  vehicle\nregistration  will  be  installed.  The  application  for  national  citizen  identification  will  be  a  core\ndatabase  that  will  track  an  individual\u2019s  life  data  from  birth  to  death.  A  number  of  other\napplications will branch out from this core application such as passport control, issuance and\n\n\f10\n\nrenewal  of  driver\u2019s  licenses,  updating  of  national  security  records,  and  updating  of  health\nrecords.  The  application  for  public  health  services  will  link  a  public  hospital  in  Male  into  the\ngovernment  network.  People  in  outer  atolls  as  well  as  in  Male  will  be  provided  on-line  with\ndistance  medical  services.  The  application  for  vessel,  aircraft,  and  vehicle  registration  will\nenable  owners  to  register  or  renew  their  property  on-line,  which  will  result  in  huge  benefits,\nespecially to people in outer atolls. The portal will be developed to accommodate new on-line\nservices as they become available.\n\nAs  part  of  this  component,  security  and  authentication  policy  and  guidelines  will  be\n42. \ndeveloped  to  inspire  public  confidence  that  personal  data  is  properly  protected,  and  to  give\nassurance that the risk of impersonation is minimized. The authentication policy and guidelines\nwill  establish  a  common  approach \nfor  government  agencies  and\ndepartments.\n\nto  authentication \n\n2. \n\nNational Computer Center\n\nNCC will be established to centrally coordinate ICT policies, standards, and practices\n43. \nfor government work. NCC will be mandated to (i) develop and monitor the implementation of\nframework  policies,  standards,  and  guidelines;  and  ensure  that  such  policies  and  standards\nare  adhered  to;  (ii)  support  government  agencies  in  their  development  of  ICT  strategies;  (iii)\ndevelop shared infrastructure and applications in collaboration with lead government agencies;\n(iv) promote common policies on the management of information including privacy; (v) develop\ncrosscutting  services  on  the  government  network;  (vi)  develop  extranet  links  with  the  wider\npublic sector; and (vii) coordinate action on skills for e-government. Under NCC, the Network\nOperations  Unit  will  be  established  to  act  as  the  focal  point  for  the  development,  operation,\nand maintenance of the government network and applications for public service delivery.\n\n44. \nThe  Project  will  provide  the  building  that  will  accommodate  NCC  and  house  the\nfacilities  and  equipment  needed  for  networking  of  government  agencies  and  delivering  of\npublic services through the Web.\n\n3. \n\nInternet Kiosks\n\n45. \nInternet kiosks, each staffed with an assistant, will be provided to give the public better\naccess to the government network. In Male, Internet kiosks will be provided on the premises of\nNCC  and  in  the  district  office  in  Vilingili.  In  the  20  outer  atolls  that  will  be  connected  to  the\ngovernment network, Internet kiosks will be accommodated in the atoll offices. The Project will\nprovide  computers,  modems,  furnishings,  and  work  stations;  appropriate  accommodations  to\nhouse the kiosks; and initial training for assistants assigned to them.\n\n4. \n\nTelecoms Sector Reform\n\n46. \nThe following reform measures will be undertaken with different time frames within the\nproject implementation period: (i) restructuring of the existing regulatory body in such a way as\nto  separate  the  policy  making  and  regulation  functions,  (ii)  establishment  of  an  independent\nregulatory  body,  (iii)  enactment  of  a  telecoms  law  that  supports  the  reform  measures,  (iv)\nopening up of nonbasic and value-added markets to competition, and (v) tariff restructuring for\nInternet services.\n\n47. \nTo  ensure  that  the  reform  measures  are  implemented  during  the  agreed  upon  time\nschedule,  the  Project  will  provide  consulting  services  for  (i)  capacity  strengthening  of  the\nregulatory  authority,  and  (ii)  preparation  of  the  telecoms  law.  The  consulting  services  for\n\n\f11\n\ncapacity  strengthening  of  the  regulatory  authority  will  assist  in  setting  up  a  telecoms  policy;\ndevising  a  regulatory  framework  including  mandate,  functions,  organizational  structure,  and\nfunding  of  the  regulatory  authority;  preparing  operational  guidelines  for  various  regulatory\nmeasures; and conducting on-the-job training for regulatory staff. The consulting services for\npreparation  of  the  telecoms  law  will  provide  a  telecoms  sector  legal  expert  to  assist  the\nGovernment in drafting and enacting a telecoms law.\n\n48. \nThe Project also includes assistance to the Government for consulting services for (i)\npreparation of bid documents and bid evaluation for provision of networking and applications,\nincluding conducting awareness campaigns; and (ii) external audit for project accounts.\n\nC. \n\nTechnical Justification\n\n49. \nIn the past, the development of ICT within the Government has been carried out ad hoc\nby  individual  ministries  without  an  overall  strategy  to  ensure  that  information  is  gathered,\nanalyzed,  processed,  and  disseminated  in  the  most  effective  manner.  Each  ministry  has\napproached  ICT  in  isolation,  and  in  accordance  with  available  resources.  This  has  led  to\ninconsistent outputs that are needed by other ministries but are distrusted. This in turn results\nin duplication of effort across the information provider and consumer ministries.\n\n50. \nThe  Project  is  designed  to  provide  a  more  uniform  ICT  environment  that  will  improve\nthe quality control of information; control costs, and improve government efficiencies through\nthe adoption of international standards. Government effectiveness relies on the availability of\ntimely  and  accurate  information,  and  on  the  ability  to  process  and  use  this  information  to\nachieve larger policy objectives. In its broadest sense, ICT provides the working environment\nand  underlying  mechanisms  for  the  collection,  validation,  and  processing  of  information,  and\nfor  the  dissemination  of  results  that  can  enable  the  Government  to  be  both  effective  and\nefficient.\n\nThe  Project  has  three  primary  technological  considerations.  The  first  is  to  create  a\n51. \ncommunication  environment \ninformation  can  be  exchanged  between\ngovernment  institutions,  and  between  the  public  and  the  Government.  The  second  is  to\nprovide  the  institutions  with  skills  needed  to  plan  for  ICT  development,  and  to  manage  ICT\nsystems  deployed.  The  third  is  to  support  the  development  of  common  use  applications  that\nwill serve as models for other ICT development within the Government.\n\nthrough  which \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\n52. \nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $12.0 million equivalent, of which $9.7 (81\npercent)  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $2.3  million  equivalent  (19  percent)  is  the  local\ncurrency cost. The estimate includes physical and price contingencies, taxes and duties, and\ninterest  during  construction.  A  summary  of  the  overall  cost  estimates,  by  component,  is  in\nTable 1.

The proposed ADB loan will have a repayment\nperiod  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  will  carry  an  interest  rate  of  1.0\npercent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum  thereafter.  The\nBorrower  will  be  the  Republic  of  Maldives.  The  Borrower  will  make  the  loan  available  to  the\nProject\u2019s  Executing  Agency  through  appropriate  budgetary  allocations.  The  Government  will\nfinance  the  costs  of  $2.5  million  equivalent,  comprising  21  percent  of  the  project  cost.  The\nfinancing plan is shown in Table 2.\n\nSource\n\nADB\nGovernment\nTotal\n\n Foreign\nExchange\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n Local\nCurrency\n0.2\n2.1\n2.3\n\nTotal\nCost\n9.5\n2.5\n12.0\n\n9.3\n0.4\n9.7\n\nPercentage\n    Share\n79\n21\n100\n\nE.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nExecuting Agency\n\n54. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury  (MOFT)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the\nProject and will be responsible for approval and coordination of all disbursements. Selection of\nconsultants and coordination of participating ministries will be carried out through the project\nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  established  in  MCST,  the  implementing  agency.  The  executing\nagency  for  externally  assisted  projects  is  usually  MOFT.  However,  implementation  and  the\n\n\f13\n\nadministrative functions will be carried out by MCST, which has, during the formulation of the\nProject, demonstrated that it is well qualified for project administration.\n\n2. \n\nProject Execution\n\n55. \nA project steering committee (PSC), chaired by MCST, has been established to direct\nthe  Project  and  assist  with  interagency  coordination  of  activities.  The  PSC  will  include  high\nlevel  officials  from  the  ministries  of  Communication,  Science  and  Technology;  Finance  and\nTreasury;  and  Planning  and  National  Development;  Atolls  Administration;  President\u2019s  Office,\nand  Department  of  External  Resources.  MCST,  as  the  project  implementing  agency,  will\nprovide secretariat services for the PSC. The PSC will meet as and when required to ensure\nefficient and effective project implementation.\n\n56. \nThe  PMU,  established  under  MCST  with  a  project  director  appointed  by  MCST,  will\nhave  overall  operational  responsibility  for  project  management.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible\nfor (i) preparing specifications for bid documents for provision of networking and applications,\ncomponents of which will include institutional development and a public awareness campaign;\n(ii) assessing the financial viability of establishing government network kiosks in selected outer\nisland in consultation with island development committees; (iii) preparing specifications for bid\ndocuments for setting up the government network kiosks; (iv) evaluating bids for government\nnetwork kiosks; and (v) supervising kiosk construction/installation.\n\n57. \nThe PMU will also monitor the social and environmental impacts of the Project during\nits implementation. The PMU will provide monthly progress reports on project implementation\nto  ADB.  An  organization  chart  showing  the  project  implementation  arrangements  is  in\nAppendix 3.\n\n3. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n58. \nThe Project will be implemented over a period of three years commencing in January\n2002  and  ending  in  December  2004.  The  detailed  project  implementation  schedule  is  in\nAppendix 4.\n\n4. \n\nProcurement\n\n59. \nProcurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\nfor  Procurement.  Procurement  of  networking  and  applications  will  be  carried  out  using\ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Local  competitive  bidding  will  be  used  for  civil\nworks  for  construction  of  the  NCC  building,  estimated  at  $0.9  million.  Procurement  of\nequipment  for  Internet  kiosks,  estimated  at  $0.4  million,  may  also  be  carried  out  using  local\ncompetitive bidding procedures. In both cases, local contractors and suppliers are available at\nreasonable  cost,  and  no  foreign  contractor  or  supplier  is  likely  to  have  interest  in  bidding\nbecause  of  the  small  amounts  of  the  packages  and  the  geographical  conditions  of  the\nMaldives. The tentative procurement packages are given in Appendix 5.\n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n60. \nConsulting  services  will  be  required  for  (i)  preparation  of  bid  documents,  and  bid\nevaluation for provision of networking and applications; (ii) institutional capacity strengthening\nfor the regulatory authority; (iii) preparation of a telecoms law; and (iv) external audit for project\naccounts. Except for external audit, all consulting services will be obtained from international\nconsulting firms in association with domestic consultants. For external audit, a domestic audit\n\n\f14\n\nfirm  will  be  engaged.  The  consulting  services  for  bidding  processes  will  also  include\ninstitutional  capacity  strengthening  for  government  networking  and  applications  for  public\nservice delivery, and a public awareness campaign for electronic provision of public services.\nAbout  42  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  10  person-months  of\ndomestic consulting services will be required (Appendixes 6-8 give details of consultant inputs\nand terms of reference).\n\n61. \nInternational  consulting  firms  to  be  engaged  under  the  Project  will  be  recruited  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The independent private audit\nfirm will be engaged under arrangements satisfactory to ADB.\n\n6. \n\nAdvance Action\n\n62. \nADB Management has approved advance action for recruitment of consulting services\nand  procurement  of  supplies  and  civil  works  on  the  understanding  that  such  advance  action\ndoes  not  necessarily  commit  ADB  to  financing  the  Project.  The  PMU,  under  the  guidance  of\nthe  PSC,  has  started  shortlisting  consultants  for  preparation  of  bid  documents  and  for  bid\nevaluation  for  provision  of  networking  and  applications.  ADB  has  assisted  the  PMU  by\nproviding a longlist of consultants qualified for the job.\n\n7. \n\nOperation and Maintenance of Project Facilities\n\n63. \nNCC will be responsible for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of project facilities\nfor the government network, portals, and Internet kiosk built in its premises. Other concerned\nministries  will  be  responsible  for  O&M  of  Internet  kiosks  and  applications  for  provision  of\ngovernment  services.  The  O&M  costs  for  project  facilities  will  be  funded  by  the  Government\nout of budgetary allocations. The Government will consider contracting out of O&M of Internet\nkiosks built in the outer islands to a private sector contractor, a community-based organization,\nor a public-private joint venture.\n\n8. \n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\nThe PMU, which will have a qualified accountant, will maintain separate accounts and\n64. \nrecords for the Project. The statement of expenditure will be audited annually by independent\nauditors acceptable to ADB.8 The PMU will provide ADB with copies of the audited accounts\nand financial statements, together with the report of the auditors, not more than nine months\nafter the end of the financial year. The PMU will also provide ADB with the unaudited accounts\nand financial statements not more than three months after the end of the financial year. The\nPMU  will  submit  monthly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation  to  ADB.  Within  three\nmonths  of  the  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  PMU  will  prepare  a  project  completion\nreport  on  the  execution  and  initial  operation  of  the  facilities  established  under  the  Project,\nincluding costs of establishment, operation, and compliance with loan covenants.\n\n9. \n\nDisbursement\n\nProceeds  of  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  using  direct  payment  procedures  in\n\n65. \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook dated January 2001.\n\n                                                          \n8  The Auditor General will certify the project accounts. However, the annual audit of the project accounts will be\n\ncontracted out to a private independent audit firm funded by ADB under the Project.\n\n\f15\n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Management and Evaluation\n\n66. \nThe  project  performance  management  and  evaluation  system  comprises  (i)  benefit\nmonitoring and evaluation to ascertain the impact of the Project on the beneficiaries; and (ii)\nperformance monitoring and evaluation, which will measure the efficiency of the Project.\n\n67. \nBenefit monitoring and evaluation will include data on (i) the number of interagency on-\nline  accesses  to  agency  data  base,  (ii)  the  number  of  on-line  exchanges  of  interagency\nmemoranda, (iii) the number of on-line accesses of the public to the government network, (iv)\nthe number of on-line deliveries of public services, (v) the number of visitors to Internet kiosks,\n(vi)  the  number  of  public  accesses  to  the  government  network  through  Internet  kiosks,  (vii)\ntariff  reduction  in  Internet  and  data  transmission  service  charges,  and  (viii)  tariff  reduction  in\ntelecoms service charges for outer islands. NCC will be responsible for maintaining data and\nevaluating project benefits.\n\n68. \nPerformance monitoring and evaluation will be undertaken by the PMU in conjunction\nwith  ADB  review  missions.  They  will  monitor  (i)  the  project  implementation  schedule,  (ii)\nproject costs, (iii) delivery of project components, and (iv) O&M sustainability. This monitoring\nwill be done every six months from the start of the Project until 12 months after its end.\n\n11.  Midterm Review\n\n69. \nA comprehensive review of the Project will be undertaken by the Government and ADB\nabout 12 months after loan effectiveness, or earlier if deemed necessary by the Government\nand/or ADB. The midterm review will evaluate the progress, performance, and implementation\narrangements  for  the  Project.  If  any  weaknesses  are  identified,  the  review  will  recommend\nremedial  measures  for  consideration  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  Prior  to  the  midterm\nreview, MCST will provide ADB with a midterm evaluation report on the progress of the Project\nand  any  problems  encountered  in  its  implementation.  The  result  of  the  midterm  review,\nincluding  an  evaluation  of  the  progress  made  under  the  Project,  will  be  discussed  by  the\nparties,  and,  if required, appropriate corrective measures will be formulated by the parties to\nensure successful implementation and achievement of the objectives.\n\nF.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Issues\n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts\n\n70. \nIn  the  design  of  the  Project,  very  few  building  and  construction  works  are  proposed.\nThe  limited  works  that  will  be  carried  out  are  the  construction  of  two  buildings  in  Male  and\nlaying of a fiber optic ring around Male for the Male network. NCC will be a key node on the\nMale  backbone  network  and  will  consist  of  two  separate  structures  (cid:190)\n  a  five-storey  office\nfacility  and  a  three-storey  adjoining  structure  that  will  house  NCC.  During  the  construction\nphase of the NCC building, there is a risk of contributing to salinization of the groundwater of\nMale,  as  some  water  needs  to  be  pumped  out  for  laying  the  foundations  for  a  five-storey\nbuilding.  The  water  will  go  to  the  sea  as  runoff  or  by  the  storm  water  drainage,  thus\ncontributing  further  to  the  salinization  of  the  Male  groundwater,  which  is  already  in  very  bad\ncondition. During the construction phase of this building, there may be some disruption to the\nnormal  road  traffic,  particularly  for  people  walking  on  the  pavement.  Measures  such  as\ncontaining building materials within the building site and working during the night when traffic\nis less will be taken to minimize the disturbance. A summary initial environment examination is\nin  Appendix  9.  The  examination  concluded  that  an  environmental  impact  assessment  is  not\nneeded.\n\n\f16\n\n71. \nBoth the above environmental impacts identified for the construction phase of the NCC\nbuilding  are  considered  to  be  nonsignificant  in  view  of  the  existing  situation  in  Male  and\nparticularly in isolation for this Project only.\n\n72. \nThe  fiber  optic  cable  ring  to  be  laid  around  Male  for  the  backbone  layer  and  the\ndistribution layer of the network will have to be laid in the interlocking concrete blocks of paved\nroads.  The  laying  of  the  fiber  optic  cable  ring  around  Male  for  the  backbone  layer  and  the\ndistribution layer is not expected to encounter serious environmental consequences. However,\nto reduce any impacts, consideration will be given to using existing ducts for other utilities such\nas telephone lines or electricity cables.\n\ntraffic  and  resulting  congestion.  Mitigation  measures \n\nThere  are  two  forecast  consequences  while  laying  the  fiber  optic  cable.  One  is\n73. \ndisruption  of \nthis\ninconvenience  will  be  taken  such  as  careful  planning  and  timing  of  the  works.  The  other  is\npossible damage to existing facilities such as water pipes, electricity cables, and sewage and\ndrainage systems. Measures to avoid any accident will be taken including careful study of the\nexisting facilities by consulting the relevant institutions.\n\nlimiting \n\nfor \n\ntelecommunications \n\n74. \nThe  atoll  backbone  network  will  provide  access  to  Government  services  and  facilities\nfrom points of service in the atolls. No major additional physical infrastructure will be built, and\nexisting \ninfrastructure  will  be  used.  Therefore,  no  significant\nenvironmental impacts are envisaged. It is also generally noted that the information industry is\nenvironment friendly as compared with other types of industries. It is based on four of the most\nabundant, least expensive, and most widely distributed items in the world\u2013silicon, the material\nused to make microelectronic devices; lightwaves and airwaves, the communication media of\nthe future; and human brain power, the principal source of motivation in the information age.\n\nAnother  effect  forecast  is  that  the  improved  communication  system  together  with\n75. \nregional development efforts9 will limit migration from the other islands to Male and therefore\nreduce  the  environmental  pressure  on  the  Male  area.  Improved  data  sharing  among  the\ndifferent government and parastatal agencies, which is also anticipated as a major outcome of\nthe  Project,  will  help  highlight  the  importance  of  the  environment  in  designing  public  sector\nmanagement policies in the Maldives.\n\n2. \n\nSocial Impacts\n\na.\n\nImpact on Community\n\n76. \nThe introduction of the Internet to island communities will be an important milestone in\nthe  country\u2019s  development.  It  will  augment  and  complement  economic  growth  through  cost-\neffective  and  efficient  communication  and  information  exchange.  In  this  way  it  will  lay  an\nimportant  foundation  for  taking  economic  growth  and  social  progress  to  a  new  phase  of\ndevelopment.\n\n77. \nThe  country\u2019s  young  population  is  ideally  situated  to  take  advantage  of  the  new\nopportunities arising from such technological options, especially as computer literacy forms an\nimportant goal of the education policy framework. The country\u2019s vision for 2020 envisages the\nuniversalization of computer literacy over the next 20 years.\n\n                                                          \n9 Loan 1695-MLD: Regional Development Project, for $8.0 million, approved on 2 September 1999.\n\n\f17\n\nFurthermore,  the  wider  introduction  of  Internet  services  to  remote  island  communities\n78. \nwill  serve  to  break  the  barrier  of  distance,  which  is  the  single  most  important  constraint  to\nachieving balanced and sustainable national development. Currently Island Aviation Services\noperates  scheduled  flights  to  four  atolls.  Apart  from  this  there  is  no  regular  transportation\nprovided  by  either  the  public  or  private  sector.  Consequently,  the  high  cost  of  transportation\nimposes serious limitations on carrying out social and economic activities in the islands. The\nInternet  connection  will  help  to  bridge  this  gap  by  providing  a  reliable  means  of  accessing\npublic  services,  leading  to  reductions  in  transportation  costs  and  enabling  the  people  to\nparticipate more widely in national development processes.\n\n79. \nGreater access to public services such as licencing and registration will be beneficial to\nthe  community  at  large.  It  is  likely  to  increase  the  overall  efficiency  of  the  island  economies\nthrough  reduction  in  the  costs  of  business  development,  and  the  ensuing  multiplier  effects\nthrough greater employment and income-earning opportunities.\n\n80. \nThe availability of timely and efficient services will increase the people\u2019s confidence in\nthe  public  service  system.  People  are  generally  less  tolerant  of  poor  service  in  one  agency\nwhen  there  is  good  service  in  another.  Increased  expectations  of  the  people  will  in  turn\npositively impact on service provision by creating greater transparency and better governance.\nThis  will  lead  to  greater  openness  of  procedures  and  increased  efficiency  of  public  sector\nmanagement, resulting in a virtuous cycle of better services, transparency, and accountability.\n\nb.\n\nImpact on Gender\n\nFemale  labor  force  participation  has  declined  from  over  60  percent  30  years  ago  to\n81. \nless than half of that today. At present, women in the outer atolls are less likely than those in\nMale,  the  main  urban  center,  to  work  outside  the  home.  However,  the  liberalization  of  the\ntelecommunications market and the associated reduction in costs and the provision of public\nservices through the Internet is likely to create new windows of opportunity for women in the\nouter  islands.  This  will  especially  apply  to  the  younger  generation  of  women,  who  are\ncompleting their schooling and looking for employment in the modern sectors.\n\nThe overall improvement in communication services will open up the scope and arena\n82. \nof  work  for  women.  In  particular  it  will  create  greater  opportunities  for  women  to  work  from\nhome, especially in the outer islands, where employment opportunities are otherwise limited.\nAs a result of the expanded arena of work they will be able to work on-line, linking up with job\nopportunities outside the island. As a result of the expanded scope of opportunities, they will\nhave a greater choice of employment areas.\n\n83. \nFurther,  their  traditional  dependence  and  reliance  on  men  to  help  them  obtain  public\nservices  will  give  way  to  independence  and  self-reliance  as  they  can  directly  access  public\nservices without travelling to Male to obtain licenses and other requirements in order to begin\nbusiness  ventures  or  obtain  social  services.  This  will  lead  to  greater  empowerment,  self-\nconfidence, and the ability to take on leadership roles.\n\n84. \nIn  this  way  it  is  highly  likely  that  the  provision  of  public  services  through  the  Internet,\nand  the  overall  improvement  in  communications  will  provide  greater  incentives  for  women  to\nparticipate in economic activities and enhance their social position.\n\n\f18\n\nc.\n\nImpact on Human Resources Development\n\n85. \nThe  Project  will  provide  opportunities  for  skilled  employment  for  secondary  school\ndropouts,  secondary  school  being  the  highest  level  of  education  available  in  the  islands\noutside  Male.  Given  the  increasing  use  of  Internet  services,  the  establishment  of  Internet-\nbased public services will create a positive impact on human resources development activities\nat the island level.\n\nFurther,  the  introduction  of  technology-based  services  will,  at  a  broader  level,  create\n86. \ngreater  public  awareness  about  Internet  services  and,  in  that  way  lead  to  an  increase  in  the\ngeneral level of knowledge about the benefits of technology, especially in providing social and\neconomic  services.  The  proposed  training  under  the  Project  will  further  enhance  the  level  of\npublic  education  about  technological  solutions  to  address  present  difficulties  in  accessing\nservices.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits and Beneficiaries\n\n87. \nThe  benefits  of  the  establishment  of  a  government  network  are  wide  ranging  and\ninclude  improved  efficiency,  transparency,  and  accountability  of  government  activities;\naccelerated decentralization of government work; and positive impacts on the poorer section\nof the population. Greater efficiency in government management will be achieved through the\ngovernment  intranet,  the  applications  supported  under  the  Project,  and  those  that  will  be\ndeveloped  by  the  various  departments.  Greater  transparency  and  accountability  will  result\nfrom  the  wider  availability  of  more  reliable  information  on  regulations,  requirements,  and\nprograms. The Government\u2019s decentralization policies will be facilitated through the linking of\nthe  atoll  offices  into  the  government  wide-area  network.    Finally,  by  providing  free  access  to\ngovernment  websites  in  the  atoll  offices  and  in  Male,  the  Project  will  benefit  those  for  whom\nthe cost of access to government services would otherwise remain prohibitively high.\n\n88. \nThe  cost  of  government  activities  can  be  reduced  through  (i)  reduced  cost  of  data\ncollection,  (ii)  faster  processing  and  availability  of  information,  (iii)  wider  availability  of\ninformation and data in a uniform format across all branches of government, (iv) reductions in\ntravel  and  paper  transmission  between  offices  and  islands,  and  (v)  more  effective\ncommunication  between  the  various  branches  of  government.  Some  benefits  will  be  direct\nwhile  others  will  be  indirect  in  nature.  The  beneficiaries  of  these  improvements  will  be  all\ncitizens who will benefit from more efficient management of the nation\u2019s resources.\n\n89. \nThe  benefits  of  the  sector  reform  component  include  (i)  a  substantial  lowering  of\ntelecom rates in line with international levels, (ii) increased internal efficiency in the services of\nthe telecom operator(s), (iii) availability of a greater range of services, and (iv) better quality of\nservices.  Some  of  these  benefits  are  direct  in  nature  and  are  more  easily  quantifiable,  while\nother  benefits  are  of  an  indirect  nature.  The  lowering  of  rates  combined  with  the  qualitative\nbenefits  will  significantly  reduce  the  private  cost  of  domestic  and  international  business  and\ncommerce  and  hence  provide  a  boost  to  economic  growth.  The  beneficiaries  of  the  sector\nreform  will  be  mainly  comprised  of  existing  users.  However,  the  lowering  of  rates  will  make\ntelecoms more affordable to large sections of the population and the business community and\nwill generate additional demand for telecoms services, in turn giving rise to economic benefits\nfrom increased economic activity.\n\n\fB. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n19\n\n90. \nThe  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  separately  for  each  of  the  components  and\nsub-components,  comparing  the  \u201cwith-Project\u201d  and  \u201cwithout-Project\u201d  situations  based  on  an\neconomic  life  of  the  investment  of  15  years  with  no  residual  value.  Demand  for  the  various\napplications  was  developed  using  the  findings  of  an  Internet  access  and  usage  survey.\nInvestment and annual operating costs are expressed in economic terms (excluding all taxes)\nusing  mid-2001  prices  and  include  a  physical  contingency  where  appropriate.  A  standard\nconversion  factor  of  0.9  was  applied  to  nontraded  items  and  labor. The  overall  economic\ninternal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project is 25 percent. When all the negative scenarios, as\nanalyzed  for  each  component,  are  combined,  the  EIRR  is  calculated  as  15  percent  for  the\noverall Project. Details on cost and benefit estimates and calculations are shown in Appendix\n10.\n\n1. \n\nGovernment Network\n\n91. \nThe  benefits  of  this  component  consist  mainly  of  greater  productivity  of  government\npersonnel  through  reduced  cost  of  data  collection,  faster  processing,  and  more  timely  and\nwider  availability  of  information;  reductions  in  travel  and  paper  transmission;  and  more\neffective communication between branches of government. All citizens of the nation will benefit\nfrom more efficient government. The improved productivity, which will translate into savings in\ngovernment  employment,  is  the  basis  for  the  economic  analysis.  Indirect  benefits,  although\nsignificant, have not been quantified.\n\n92. \nThe  critical  factor  for  the  analysis  is  the  scale  and  pace  at  which  networking  will  be\nadopted  within  government.  Initial  usage  of  the  networking  and  growth  in  usage  have  been\nestimated  taking  into  account  the  Government\u2019s  policies  and  measures  to  make  an  effective\ntransition to a predominantly paperless mode of operation.  Past employment trends and the\nGovernment\u2019s  current  personnel  policies  aimed  at  redesigning  government  functions  and  job\ndescriptions and containing the growth of staff form the frame of reference for projecting total\ngovernment  employment  with  and  without  the  Project.  The  Project  would  lead  to  savings  in\npersonnel of 309 staff five years after the start of the Project, growing to more than 2,960 after\n15 years. The EIRR of the investment is 19 percent. This outcome is sensitive to the rate at\nwhich the Government will be able to stabilize employment levels through attrition. However, if\nthe savings in government personnel are 25 percent less than assumed in the base case, the\nEIRR would still be 15 percent with a switching value of 0.85.\n\n2. \n\nNational Citizens Identification Application\n\n93. \nThis  application  will  bring  greater  efficiency  in  government  activities  by  avoiding\nduplication in the creation and updating of personal data records by the various agencies and\ndepartments that interact with the population at large. Again all the citizens of the nation will\nbenefit from the efficiencies obtained from this application. The economic evaluation is based\non  the  time  savings  of  government  departments  from  accessing  and  using  the  personal\nidentification (ID) record from the national ID register rather than creating and updating such\nrecords themselves. The critical factors for the economic analysis are the potential maximum\nuse  that  can  be  made  of  the  application,  i.e.,  the  number  of  times  the  ID  record  will  be\naccessed,  and  the  initial  use  and  rate  at  which  the  level  of  use  will  grow  towards  their  full\npotential.  The  number  of  times  the  ID  record  will  be  accessed  once  fully  implemented is\nestimated at a total of 1.4 million annually. During the first year only 50 percent of this potential\nwill  be  realized,  growing  to  100  percent  in  the  fourth  year.  The  average  time  saving  is\nestimated at 15 minutes, and the hourly time cost for government employees is Rf21. On this\nbasis the EIRR is 42 percent. If it takes six years to achieve the full potential and if the time\n\n\f20\n\nsaving is only 10 minutes on average, the EIRR will still be 21 percent with a switching value\nof 0.85.\n\n3. \n\nHospital Information System\n\n94. \nThe main direct benefit of the introduction of ICT at the hospital is higher productivity\nthrough,  among  others,  single  patient  registration,  instant  availability  of  medical  records,\nreductions  in  all  kinds  of  processing,  and  real  time  availability  of  medical  and  accounting\ninformation. Indirect benefits include enhanced quality of health care. The beneficiaries are the\ncitizens of the nation and the patients. The economic evaluation is based on the time savings\nof doctors and other staff made possible with the introduction of ICT. These time savings are\nestimated  from  achievable  productivity  levels  as  derived  from  efficient  hospitals  in  a\ncomparable country setting. It is estimated that productivity can be increased by 25 percent for\ndoctors  and  by  90  percent  for  other  staff.  The  key  factor  for  the  economic  analysis  is  the\nefficiency level that can be achieved in the initial years and the number of years it will take to\nachieve the full efficiency potential. It is estimated that, during the first year after introduction of\nICT,  efficiency  will  only  be  25  percent  of  the  full  potential,  and  that  the  full  potential  will be\nachieved after a four-year period. Productivity increases will be absorbed by the growth in the\nvolume  of  activity,  which  is  estimated  at  10  percent  per  annum  based  on  past  trends.  When\nthe  full  potential  of  the  savings  has  been  reached,  these  will  amount  to  Rf21.7  million  per\nannum.  Assuming  that  half  of  these  savings  can  be  attributed  to  the  introduction  of  ICT,  the\nEIRR  is  35  percent.  If  it  is  assumed  that  it  will  take  six  years  for  the  full  potential  to  be\nachieved, the EIRR is 29 percent with a switching value of 0.43.\n\n4. \n\nVessel, Vehicle, and Aircraft Registration Application\n\n95. \nFor Male residents, the direct benefits of web-based applications are the time savings\nfrom avoiding a personal trip to the ministry\u2019s office for information, or for a transaction, and for\natoll residents savings both of time and of transport costs associated with the trip.  There are\nalso  time  savings  for  concerned  ministry  staff,  but  these  are  less  substantial  and  can  be\nconsidered as  part  of  the  benefits  of  the  government  intranet.  Accordingly,  the  economic\nevaluation is based on the time and transport cost savings for those interactions/transactions\nthat transfer from a traditional mode to an electronic mode. These were developed in the light\nof  the  findings  of  the  Internet  access  and  usage  survey,  experience  in  other  countries  and\nestimates of the maximum number of operations that can be carried out electronically and the\nusage  of  the  electronic  mode  during  the  initial  years.    It  is  estimated  that  in  the  first  year  of\navailability  15  percent  of  trips  related  to  permits  of  various  kinds  for  sea  craft,  land  vehicles,\nand aircraft that would need to be obtained or renewed annually will be avoided, growing to 70\npercent at the end of the evaluation period. In addition, estimates have been developed of the\naverage travel distance, the average total trip duration, and the time saved for Male residents.\nThe time cost is estimated at Rf29/hour. The resource cost of a trip by atoll residents to Male,\nestimated  at  Rf1,493,  is  based  on  the  average  fare  of  a  single  trip,  which  represents  the\n(average)  long-run  marginal  cost  of  interisland  transport  by  sea  or  by  air.  On  this  basis  the\nEIRR  is  calculated  at  40  percent.  If  the  travel  cost  savings  of  atoll  residents  were  only  50\npercent of the base case, the EIRR would be 31 percent with a switching value of 0.73.\n\n5. \n\nInternet Kiosks\n\nThe  benefits  of  the  kiosks  include  wide  access  to  information  on  government\n96. \nregulations,  guidelines, \nrequirements,  advisory  notices,  standards,  and  procurement\nopportunities; greater timeliness in the availability of information; and greater transparency in\ngovernment.  The  kiosks  specifically  target  the  population  who  do  not  have  access  to  the\n\n\f21\n\ninternet through either a computer at a school, an office, or a business and for whom access to\nthe Internet and hence to e-government services is prohibitively difficult because of the cost of\nboth  the  terminal  computer  stations  and  internet  usage  charges.  The  kiosks  will  accordingly\nfacilitate the poor who cannot afford to have their own computer and pay for Internet charges\nto get access to e-government services through the public window. The economic and social\nbenefits of the kiosks are expected to justify the modest initial investment costs amounting to\nRf3.7  million.  A  rigorous  monitoring  scheme  will  be  set  up  to  closely  track  the  usage  of  the\nkiosks  and  assess  whether  the  expected  economic  and  social  benefits  are  realized.  The\nexpansion  of  the  kiosks  to  other  outer  islands  will  be  based  on  the  result  of  this  benefit\nmonitoring.\n\n97. \nThe  kiosks  will  be  linked  into  the  atoll  network  that  is  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  wide\narea network. As a result, public access to government information through the kiosks will not\ngive rise to any additional financial outlays compared with the situation where there would be\nno  kiosks.  In  the  long  run  there  is  no  risk  that  this  public  access  would  either  have  a\nsubstantial impact on government finances or become unsustainable. It is expected that, with\nthe  rapid  growth  of  computer  workstations  in  households  and  businesses,  the  need  for  free\npublic access to the kiosks will not run out of hand. Once Internet access and usage fees have\ncome  down  and  broader  sections  of  the  population  have  direct  Internet  access  from  a\nbusiness,  or  from  home,  the  free  Internet  kiosk  will  primarily  be  an  opportunity  for  the  lower\nincome  sections  of  the  population.  But  providing  this  opportunity  is  an  objective  that  is  well\nworth pursuing and supporting under the Project.\n\nC.\n\nPoverty Reduction Impact\n\n98. \nThe Project primarily aims at improving the efficiency, transparency, and accountability\nof  public  sector  management  and  setting  up  a  regulatory  regime  that  will  encourage  fair\ncompetition in the telecoms sector. This will percolate to the outer island level and broadly help\nto reduce poverty in two ways. First, the provision of information and services via the Internet\nsystem  will  lead  to  wider  social  inclusion  of  the  poor  by  enabling  direct  access  to  public\ninformation. In this way, rather than relying on the bureaucracy, the poor will be able to access\nsuch  information  directly  through  the  Internet.  In  particular,  the  provision  of  information  and\nservices in the areas of health and education will change the basic life pattern of people in the\nislands. The provision of health information and services will considerably reduce waiting time.\nIt  will  enable  them  to  make  crucial  choices  in  terms  of  traveling  and  leaving  their  families\nbehind.  This  will  translate  into  savings  and  the  ability  to  make  alternative  expenditure\ndecisions,  which  may  otherwise  not  be  possible.  Over  the  long  run,  as  the  Internet  services\nexpand from single kiosks to widespread use in schools and other learning centers, it will open\nup a new world of information that will greatly facilitate distance education and other modes of\ninformal learning in a diverse number of areas including vocational education and specialized\ntraining and skills development.\n\n99. \nSecond,  access  to  social  services  and  public  information  will  lead  to  greater\nempowerment of the poor. Their life circumstances will acquire a greater degree of certainty,\nwhich presently eludes them. The ability to utilize the service for such things as reporting fish\ncatch,  obtaining  information  on  fish  prices  and  trends  in  the  demand  for  local  products  (fish\nand  agricultural  products),  and  applying  for  licenses  will  benefit  poor  communities  through\nsavings in time and resources and better organization of their activities. This will increase their\ngeneral independence and self-reliance.\n\n100.  This  will in  turn create the conditions for enhancing their economic life and launching\nnew  income-generating  activities  by  reducing  the  costs  of  establishing  businesses  through\n\n\f22\n\nlower transportation costs and eliminating the need to travel to Male to obtain information and\nservices.\n\n101.  At the moment there is an imbalance in the availability of telecommunication services.\nHowever, the wider availability of such services under the Project, especially to areas that are\npresently  underserved,  will  help  to  reduce  regional  differences  and  close  the  gap  between\nspatially  disadvantaged  groups.  It  will  provide  an  opportunity  to  address  the  disadvantages\nthat  arise  from  geographical  location  and  to  improve  communications  and  employment\nopportunities.  This  will,  by  the  same  token,  help  to  generate  greater  economies  of  scale\nthrough  reduction  in  the  cost  of  services,  which  is  presently  the  single-most  important\nconstraint in reducing poverty in small island communities.\n\n102.  Overall,  the  opportunities  for  economic  progress  will  be  enhanced  over  the  long  term\nthrough greater efficiency resulting from lower costs and timely access to services.\n\nD.\n\nPrivate Sector Development\n\n103.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  the  creation  of  enabling  conditions  for  private  sector\noperations,  specifically  by  improving  governance,  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector\nDevelopment  Strategy.  The  Project  will  make  public  administration  more  transparent,  cause\nsector regulations to be sound, check corruption in the public sector, reduce transaction costs\nfor  public  sector  management,  and  establish  efficient  and  competitive  telecoms  service\nmarkets,  all of which  will  eventually help promote private sector participation in the telecoms\nsector. The sector reforms pursued by the Project, especially opening up of telecoms service\nmarkets,  will  accelerate  divestment  of  the  Government\u2019s  share  in  the  monopoly  service\nprovider in the Maldives. Lower communication costs enabled by the sector reforms, and lower\ntransaction  costs  with  the  Government  resulting  from  public  services  provided  electronically\nwill  promote  private  sector  economic  and  business  activities.  The  Project  will  also  promote\ndirect involvement of the private sector in the course of its implementation. The establishment\nof  the  government  network  and  applications  for  e-government  will  be  bid  out  on  a  turnkey\nbasis to the private sector. O&M of the government network and portals could be contracted\nout  to  the  private  sector.  O&M  of  Internet  kiosks  will  also  be  contracted  out  to  the  private\nsector or to village communities.\n\nE.\n\nProject Risks\n\n104.  Relating to O&M of project equipment, including the network, applications, and Internet\nkiosks, two risks need to be addressed. The first is the financial sustainability of O&M. Since\nno financial revenue is expected from the operation of project equipment, O&M will depend on\ngovernment  budgetary  resources  of  project  equipment.  The  Project  will  ensure  the\nGovernment\u2019s commitment to allocate appropriate budgetary resources through the conditions\nof  the  Loan.  The  second  risk  concerns  who  will  operate  and  maintain  the  network  and\napplications.  NCC  will  act  as  the  focal  point  for  O&M.  The  Project  will  provide  an  extensive\ntraining  program  for  NCC  staff  as  part  of  the  network  and  applications  development\ncomponents.\n\n105.  The  most  significant  potential  risk  is  how  to  motivate  government  agencies  to\nproactively participate in the Project, and to cooperate with each other to establish the network\nand share their information across all agencies. This risk will be addressed by launching large-\nscale  awareness  campaigns  at  the  initial  stage  of  the  Project.  The  consulting  services  for\ndetailed  design  of  the  network  and  applications  will  include  devising  and  executing  such\nawareness campaigns for government agencies.\n\n\f23\n\n106.  Since  the  realization  of  the  benefits  is  hinged  on  affordable  Internet  tariffs  for  the\npublic, the success of the Project is subject to the success of the telecoms sector reform that\nwill be implemented as part of it. The plan for the reform, agreed upon with the Government,\nwill  commit  the  Government  to  undertake  the  reform  under  an  agreed  upon  timetable.  To\nensure the success of the reform, a holistic approach will be taken by integrating sector and\ncross-sector  efforts  and  thereby  maximizing  the  leverage  effect  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance.  In  the\ncourse,  an  effort  will  be  made  to  involve  the  highest  authority  as  a  strong  supporter  for  the\nreform.  Successful  implementation  of  the  sector  reform  is  closely  linked  to  the  regulatory\ncapacity of the independent regulatory body that will be established as part of the Project. The\nProject will provide the consulting services for capacity strengthening of the regulatory body,\nincluding a training program for its staff.\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\n107. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  the  following\nspecific assurances, which are incorporated in the Loan Agreement between the Government\nand ADB.\n\n108.  The Government will:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ncause  NCC  to  be  established,  including  appointment  of  management  and  the\nrequired staff, within six months of loan effectiveness.\n\nprovide  the  PMU  and  NCC  with  adequate  budgetary  resources  for  their\neffective operations during and after project implementation.\n\nallocate  appropriate  budgetary \nsustainable O&M of project facilities.\n\nresources \n\nto  concerned  ministries \n\nfor\n\nensure  that  the  PMU  and  NCC  are  at  all  times  staffed  with  the  appropriate\nnumber of suitably qualified personnel and have suitable office accommodation.\n\nprovide appropriate counterpart funds in a timely manner for the Project during\nimplementation.\n\n109.  Unless  otherwise  agreed  upon  between  the  Government  and  ADB,  the  following  key\nsector policies will be implemented:\n\nThe  Government  will  draft  the  Telecommunications  Act  (the  draft  Act),  and\nconsider the comments of stakeholders in the review process, within one year\nof loan effectiveness.\n\nThe  Government  will  submit  the  draft  Act  to  Parliament  for  approval  within  18\nmonths of loan effectiveness.\n\nThe  Government  will  establish  an  independent  regulatory  body,  including\nmanagement,  staffing,  budget,  facilities,  etc.,  with  appropriate  mandate  and\nauthority as stipulated in the Act, prior to the loan closing date.\n\n\f24\n\n(iv) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  opening  up  of  the  Internet  service  market  to\ncompetition within two years of loan effectiveness to bring charges to affordable\nlevels in line with international best practices\n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n110. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the\nArticles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various\ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 7,509,000 to the Republic of Maldives for the\nInformation Technology Development Project, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period\nof 8 years, and with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace\nperiod  and  1.5  percent  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are\nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the\nBoard.\n\n23 November 2001\n\nMYOUNG-HO

Consultants  from  two  separate  disciplines  will  be  required  (cid:190)\n  a\ncommunications network engineer, and an application development specialist (cid:190)\n for six person-\nmonths each. The following sections provide the TOR for the two.\n\nB. \n\nCommunications Network Engineer (International, 6 person-months)\n\nThe  communications  network  engineer  will  lead  the  specification  and  selection  of  the\n\n2. \napplication development team through six stages as follows:\n\n(i) \n\nPrepare the specifications to be tendered for selecting the project team that will\ndesign and oversee the implementation of the government network.\n\n(ii) \n\nOversee the tendering process for selecting this project team.\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nDevelop evaluation requirements for awarding the tender in coordination with the\n(MCST).\n\nEvaluate  tenders  that  have  been  received,  and  coordinate  the  selection  of  the\nwinning bid.\n\nIdentify qualified external training organizations, jointly design training programs\nfor  concerned  ministries,  and  contract  out  training  by  making  use  of  the  budget\nseparately allocated within these consulting services.\n\n(vi) \n\nDevelop  awareness  campaigns  for  the  government  network,  and  conduct  pilot\nawareness campaigns.\n\n3. \nTo  this  end,  the  communications  network  engineer  will  develop  the  scope  of  work,\nrecommend  the  staffing  structure  for  the  networking  and  government  portals  subprojects,  and\nprepare  the  detailed  TOR  for  each  team  member.  The  general  strategy  will  be  to  use\ninternational  consultants  primarily  as  mentors,  with  the  domestic  team  members  gradually\nassuming  more  responsibilities  as  the  development  progresses.    By  the  time  final  testing  and\nacceptance  of  each  component  have  been  completed,  all  management  and  development\nactivities will be carried  out  by  domestic staff. Training for concerned ministries will, therefore,\ncomprise  an  integral  part  of  the  network  development.  The  communications  network  engineer\nwill carry out the following tasks:\n\n(i) \n\nReview  all  preceding  reports,  studies,  and  recommendations  concerning  the\ndevelopment  of  the  Government  Network  of  Maldives  (GNM).    This  will  include\nthe  anticipated  applications,  community  interest,  and  planned  networking\narchitecture.\n\n(ii) \n\nThrough  interviews  with  representatives  of  ministerial  and  parastatal  users,\nconfirm that the direction of development of the government networking concept\n\n\f33\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nis still appropriate for the community it will be designed to serve.  If anything has\nchanged the networking requirements or priorities, revise the preliminary network\ndesign accordingly.\n\nPrepare  a  report  summarizing  the  preliminary  network  design.  This  report  will\ninclude  a  design  history  indicating  why  critical  decisions  were  deemed  most\nappropriate  at  the  time.    The  report  will  address  both  the  Male  Metropolitan\nNetwork and the Atolls Backbone Network in isolation, along with details for their\ninterconnection and for interconnection with monopoly carrier facilities.\n\nBased  on  this,  develop  a  conceptual  design  and  implementation  plan  for  the\nProject.  This plan will establish the deployment priorities for network service in\nconcert  with  the  objectives  of  MCST  and  government  network  users.    This  will\ninclude  a  plan  for  commissioning  of  service  for  both  the  Male  Metropolitan\nNetwork and the Atolls Backbone Network.\n\nDevelop  cost  estimates  for  the  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  the  Male\nMetropolitan Network and the Atolls Backbone Network.\n\nRecommend  the  composition  and  reporting  structure  of  the  design  and\nimplementation team for the Male Metropolitan Network and the Atolls Backbone\nNetwork. The team will be designed such that core work will be started with an\ninternational  consultant  as  mentor,  and  other  international  experts  providing\nservices as appropriate throughout the Project.\n\n(vii) \n\nIncorporate  a  skills  transfer  component  in  the  Project  such  that,  by  the  time  of\nformal  acceptance,  domestic  experts  are  in  charge  of  aspects  of  the  network\nproject.\n\n(viii)  Prepare  comprehensive  TOR  for  each  member  of  the  network  design  and\nimplementation  team.    This  will  include  the  requirements  of  each  domestic  and\ninternational  member  of  each  discipline  for  the  design,  specification,  and\nimplementation of the network.  It will also define the training role to be fulfilled by\neach  international  team  member  as  needed  to  enable  the  domestic  team\nmember to assume the leadership role by the completion of the Project.\n\nC. \n\nApplication Development Specialist (international, 6 person-months)\n\nThe  application  development  specialist  will  lead  the  specification  and  selection  of  the\n\n4. \napplication development team through six stages as follows:\n\n(i) \n\nPrepare the specifications to be tendered for selecting the project team that will\ndevelop the initial applications.\n\n(ii) \n\nOversee the tendering process for selecting this project team.\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nDevelop  evaluation  requirements  for  awarding  the  tender  in  coordination  with\nMCST and the application\u2019s user ministry or organization.\n\nEvaluate  tenders  that  have  been  received,  and  coordinate  the  selection  of  the\nwinning bid.\n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 6, page 3\n\n(v) \n\nIdentify qualified external training organizations, jointly design training programs\nfor  concerned  ministries,  and  contract  out  training  by  making  use  of  the  budget\nseparately allocated within these consulting services.\n\n(vi) \n\nDevelop  awareness  campaigns  for  applications  for  provision  of  government\ninformation and services, and conduct pilot awareness campaign.\n\n5. \nTo  this  end,  the  application  development  specialist  will  develop  the  scope  of  work  and\nrecommend the staffing structure for the initial ministerial application to use the facilities of the\nGNM. This will include preparing the detailed TOR for each team member. The general strategy\nwill be to use international consultants primarily as mentors, with the domestic team members\ngradually  assuming  more  responsibilities  as  the  development  progresses.  By  the  time  final\ntesting  and  acceptance  of  each  Project  have  been  completed,  all  management  and\ndevelopment  activities  will  be  carried  out  by  domestic  staff.  Training  for  concerned  ministries\nwill,  therefore,  comprise  an  integral  part  of  the  network  development.  The  application\ndevelopment specialist will carry out the following tasks:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nReview  all  preceding  reports  concerning  the  development  of  the  GNM  and  all\nrelevant  ministerial  documents  to  gain  a  full  appreciation  of  the  information\ntechnology environment  within which the target application will be implemented.\n\nReview  potential  applications  that  are  identified  in  this  report,  along  with  other\npotential  applications  that  have  been  identified  by  the  ministries  in  the  interim.\nDevelop  a  standard  system  for  comparative  ranking  of  the  costs,  benefits,  and\nrisks associated with new application deployment in the Government.\n\nThrough interviews with representatives of ministerial and parastatal users, gain\na firm understanding of the objectives and potential impact of each application on\nboth the Government and the public at large.\n\nPrepare a summary report presenting a critical comparative assessment of these\napplications, and rank their relative priorities in accordance with the comparative\nranking  strategy.  Make  recommendations  for  first  and  second  application\nalternatives,  and  obtain  agreement  from  MCST  and  the  affected  ministries  that\nthis is, in fact, the most beneficial choice for the country.\n\nPrepare  a  preliminary  specification  software  for  the  selected  application.  This\ndocument  must  be  designed  to  serve  as  the  core  reference  for  subsequent\ndevelopment  of  the  selected  application.  It  is  preferable  that  the  selected\napplication not be such that it requires a completely new design.  Rather it should\nbe  one  that  can  draw  heavily  on  similar  large-scale  commercial  or  government\napplications, with appropriate tailoring to meet Maldivian needs.  The objective is\nto achieve maximum levels of benefit at minimum cost and with minimal risk.\n\nPlan a structure for the team that will carry out the detailed design, specification,\nand  implementation  of  the  selected  initial  application.  Prepare  comprehensive\nTOR for each member of the network design and implementation team.  This will\ninclude  the  requirements  of  each  domestic  and  international  member  of  each\ndiscipline for the design, specification, and implementation of the application.\n\n\f35\n\nAppendix 6, page 4\n\n(vii) \n\nIdentify  the  specific  training  that  will  be  needed  to  optimize  the  effectiveness  of\nthe domestic consultants prior to commencement of the Project.  Also define the\ntraining  role  to  be  fulfilled  by  each  international  team  member  as  needed  to\nenable  the  domestic  team  member  to  assume  the  leadership  role  by  the\ncompletion of the Project.\n\nD. \n\nInitial Applications\n\nA  working  session  was  held  at  MCST  with  representatives  of  information  and\n6. \ncommunications  technology  stakeholders  from  ministries  and  related  organizations  that  are\npotential major users or suppliers of information technology.  The following paragraphs provide\nfive possible initial applications arising from this session.\n\n7. \nNational  Identity  Card.  The  Department  of  National  Registration  within  the  Ministry  of\nHome Affairs, Housing and Environment is in the process of deploying an ICT environment to\nsupport the creation of a national identification (ID) card.  The new card will replace the existing\nmanual card system.\n\n8. \nMany  government  organizations  require  personal  information  as  a  core  input  to  other\nneeds.    Although  this  application  is  now  well  along  in  development,  it  remains  unclear  how\nothers will access needed information and how the validity of this information will be assured.  A\npossible  core  application  may  be  the  provision  of  a  common  means  or  strategy  for  accessing\npersonal information from the national ID database.\n\nPublic  Hospital  Information  System.  Improving  information  management  within  the\n9. \nIndira Ghandi Memorial Hospital will reduce operating costs and improve patient care. Some of\nthe many benefits arising from the use of ICT within a hospital setting include\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\nsingle patient registration;\nimproved availability of medical records;\nreductions in unnecessary (or redundant) physician orders;\nreductions in adverse drug events;\nreductions in chart pulls;\nimproved turnaround of test results;\nreduction of use of paper; and\ndetailed, real-time cost information available by department or procedure\n\n10. \nThe  public  hospital  has  invested  significantly  in  the  beginnings  of  an  advanced  ICT\nenvironment.  The  institution  has  learned,  first  hand,  the  pitfalls  of  \u201creinventing\u201d  major\napplications.  A  number  of  applications  have  been  identified  in  use  at  comparable  foreign\ninstitutions.  The strategy of this application would be to develop or customize a proven medical\nmanagement system to suit the specific needs of the hospital.\n\n11. \nElectronic  Provision  of  Health  Service. Health  services  can  also  be  extended  to  the\nlarger public through the use of the Internet. In a 1999 study in the United States, Deloitte and\nTouche  found  that  70  million  people  used  the  Internet  to  search  for  health  information.    Of\nthese, 53 percent went on-line at least once each month, while 24 percent went on-line at least\nonce a week.  The study also found that 6.9 million adults who use the Internet for this purpose\nwere caregivers to individuals with chronic conditions.\n12. \nElectronic  provision  of  health  service  is  the  practice  of  using  the  Internet  to  connect\ncaregivers,  healthcare  systems,  and  hospitals  with  consumers.  Electronic  provision  of  health\n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 6, page 5\n\nservice enables consumers to take advantage of tools, content, and services in the comfort of\ntheir own homes to better manage their health and care. The widespread application of e-Health\napplications  can  support  the  secure  exchange  of  clinical  and  health  information  relevant  to\nconsumers and clinicians.  Benefits fall into four general areas.\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nContent:  The Internet offers diverse information resources.\nCommunity:  The Internet offers support groups and a communications network\nor learning and sharing information about diverse health topics.\nCommerce:  Health-related goods and services can be purchased on-line.\nCare:  Healthcare treatment can be delivered via the Internet.\n\n13. \nVessel,  Vehicle,  and  Aircraft  Registration.  The  Land  Division  of  the  Ministry  of\nTransportation  and  Civil  Aviation  is  responsible  for  licensing  of  motor  vehicles  and  operators.\nTracking of drivers and their payments of fines is problematic, as is the recording of transfers of\nownership of both automobiles and vessels. Verification that a vehicle is free of liens requires\nthe involvement of several ministries and laborious manual record searching, often requiring a\nminimum of one week.  The Land Division has a pilot project in which applicants can apply for a\nlicense  at  a  server  kiosk,  apply  on-line,  and  take  an  operators\u2019  test.  Plans  are  to  install  these\nservers at four locations, without connecting them back to the Ministry. One possible beneficial\napplication  for  consideration  here  would  be  to  expand  the  scope  of  this  limited  deployment,\nbased on operating experience gained to date.\n\n14. \nThaana  Standardization.  In  the  past,  both  the  development  and  use  of  ICT  has\ndepended  on  the  use  of  the  English  language.    For  the  most  part  electronic  correspondence\n(email) is English based.  Database applications have an English core, although there has been\na strong desire to store and retrieve information in Thaana script.\n\n15. \nAt  present  there  are  at  least  two  separate  and  incompatible  methods  of  encoding\nThaana  script.  Information  stored  in  one  environment  cannot  be  read  by  a  user  from  an  ICT\nenvironment using the other coding scheme.\n\n16. \nA  standardized  encoding  of  Thaana  script  has  now  been  adopted  by  the  International\nStandards Organization.  It will be an inherent language selection option within the next release\nof Windows 2000 and Microsoft Office. This offers the opportunity for the government to provide\na common approach to the use of Thaana script.\n\nThere is a need for the Government to adopt the international representation of Thaana\n17. \nscript.  This will require conversion of all existing data bases that contain stored Thaana script,\nalong with conversions of the applications themselves to use the new script encoding.\n\nSimilarly, there are two separate keyboard encoding strategies: one phonetically based,\n18. \nthe  other  more  character  oriented.    People  trained  to  use  one  keyboard  encoding  scheme\ncannot easily use the other. The Government may wish to consider the standardization of the\nkeyboard  human  interface  for  the  use  of  Thaana  script.  This  would  require  system\nreprogramming,  along  with  retraining  of  all  personnel  who  are  currently  skilled  in  using  the\nimplementation that would be abandoned.\n\n19. \nIt must be emphasized, however, that while the standardization of script and keyboards\nis  highly  desirable,  these  can  be  addressed  as  separate  issues.  It  is  entirely  feasible  to\nstandardize  character  encoding  independently  from  the  human  interface  of  the  keyboard.  The\nmain reason for integrating the two is to ensure that opportunities for the people are enhanced.\n\n\f37\n\nAppendix 7, page 1\n\nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES\nFOR CAPACITY

The specific objectives are as follows:\n\nAs  part  of  its  strategy  to  develop  and  enhance  telecommunications  (telecoms)\ninfrastructure  and  services  in  the  Maldives,  prepare  an  outline  of  the  major\nsections of a comprehensive act aimed at achieving the policy objectives set out\nin the national Telecoms Master Plan.\n\nBegin  drafting  the  details  of  the  act  in  consultation  with  all  stakeholders  in  the\nsector, \nlegislators,  policy  makers,  service  providers,  business\nrepresentatives, and consumers.\n\nincluding \n\nPrepare  a  comprehensive  draft  Telecommunications  Act  covering  the  policy\nframework and the structure of a policy/regulatory environment that will stimulate\ncompetition, innovation, and investment in the sector over the next decade.\n\nOrganize  workshops  and  conduct  awareness  campaigns  for  all  stakeholders,\nincluding  user  groups  and  service  providers,  thus  ensuring  support  for  the  act\nbeing passed into law.\n\nB. \n\nScope of Work\n\n2.\n\nThe consultant will\n\n1.\n\nTelecoms Legislation Specialist \u2013 (International, 6 person-months)\n\nReview    the  existing  outline  of  the  Telecommunications  Act  and  align  the\nframework with recent development in the telecoms sector.\n\nPrepare  the  detailed  draft  of  the  Telecommunications  Act  for  comment  by  all\nstakeholders.\n\n(iii) \n\nBased upon the comments received, prepare a final draft.\n\nAct  as  team  leader  of  the  consultant  team  and  coordinate  with  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank and implementing agencies.\n\nCoordinate with other consulting team members to achieve the objectives of the\ntechnical assistance and comply with the reporting requirements.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n\f41\n\nAppendix 8, page 2\n\n2.\n\nTelecoms Legislation Specialist (Domestic, 7 person-months)\n\n3.\n\nThe consultant will\n\nWork with the team leader on all aspects of the telecoms legislation outline, the\ndraft, and the implementation.\n\nTranslate  and  produce  the  final  draft  Telecommunications  Act  in  the  Dhivehi\nlanguage, ready for presentation to the Parliament.\n\n(iii) \n\nAssist the team leader in conducting the Project.\n\nC. \n\nReporting Requirements\n\n4.\n\nThe consultants will prepare and submit the following reports:\n\nan  inception  report,  to  be  submitted  one  month  after  commencement  of  the\nconsulting  work,  detailing  the  work  plan  and  outlining  any  changes  in  overall\ndirection as agreed to with the parties concerned;\n\nmonthly  progress  reports,  to  be  submitted  every  month  after  the  submission  of\nthe inception report, summarizing the work done during the preceding month;\n\ndraft  final  report,  to  be  submitted  one  month  prior  to  the  terminal  date  of  the\ncontract; and\n\na  final  report,  incorporating  inputs  from  the  parties  concerned,  to  be  submitted\nwithin one month after the comments have been transmitted.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 9, page 1\n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis  summary \n\ninitial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)  assesses \n\nthe  potential\n1. \nenvironmental  impacts  of  the  proposed  Information  Technology  Development  Project.  It\nprovides a brief account of the Project and the activities involved, including location, magnitude,\nand  implementation  schedule.  The  natural,  social,  and  \u201cbuilt\u201d  environments  that  the  Project  is\nlikely  to  affect  are  described.  Because  of  the  extensive  nature  of  the  Project,  mainly  existing\ninformation  was  used  to  describe  the  natural  and  the  built  environment.  Wherever  available,\nspecific information about the environment of the islands is provided. When specific information\ncorresponding to islands or locations is not readily available, general descriptions pertaining to\nthe whole country are included.\n\n2. \nUtilizing the information provided in the project design, and taking into consideration the\nenvironment, both natural and built, covered by the Project, the activities of the different phases\nof the Project have been screened for potential environmental impacts. Mitigation measures are\nsuggested  if  and  when  necessary  for  different  activities.  The  results  of  the  screening  process\nare  discussed  based  on  whether  a  follow-up  environmental  impact  assessment  is  required  or\nnot.\n\nB.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n1.\n\nPhysical Resources\n\n3. \nThe  Republic  of  Maldives  is  an  island  nation  located  in  the  West  Indian  Ocean.  The\narchipelago,  850  kilometers  long  and  120  kilometers  at  its  widest,  consists  of  26  atolls\ncomprising  1,200  islands.  The  local  population  inhabits  200  of  those  islands,  and  85  of  which\nare operating as tourist resorts. The distances between the different centers of population are\ntherefore a handicap for development, all the more since they have to be covered by boat for\nthe transport of goods and people.\n\nTwo  parallel  chains  of  atolls  constitute  most  of  the  central  part  of  the  country,  whereas\n4. \nthe  southern  part  consists  of  a  single  chain  of  atolls.  The  atolls  are  separated  by  larger\nchannels. The insides of the atolls are usually quite shallow, with depth usually in the range of\n40 meters. The channels are much deeper, on the order of 200 - 400 meters.\n\n5. \nThe climate is dominated by the monsoon variations of the Indian Ocean. The northeast\nmonsoon from December to March is characterized by dry weather and little wind, whereas the\nsouthwest monsoon, from May to November, is windier and wetter. The temperature is constant\nalmost  all  year  long  at  around  30  degrees  Celsius  (\u00b0C).  The  ocean  temperatures  are  also\nvirtually constant all year long, varying between 27\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C.\n\nThe islands are made from calcium carbonate sediments created by the corals and other\n6. \nliving organisms of the reefs and are consolidated into limestone. The islands are very low lying,\nand therefore depend a lot on the reefs that surround them for protection against waves.\n\nThe islands would be quite affected by a rise in sea level, as more wave energy means\n7. \nmore sediment suspension and therefore more sediment loss from the island. This would not be\nso preoccupying if the corals could build up fast enough to keep up with the rise in sea level. At\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\npresent, the dead corals from the recent natural bleaching event of 1998 (para. 17) have broken\ndown and toppled over, thus lowering the obstacle to the waves in many areas.\n\n8. \nThe islands usually have an underlying fresh water lens made by the rainwater infiltrating\nthe  substrate.  This  groundwater  might  remain  salty  depending  on  the  size  and  the  porosity  of\nthe substrate of the island.\n\n9. \nThere is no particular mineral resource in the Maldives apart from corals and sand, which\nhave been used for construction. Imported building material is now preferred for all major works,\nbut coral and sand mining, although regulated, still goes on in a minor scale.\n\n10. \nThe Male area is in the center of the archipelago and has always been the point of focus\nfor  development  projects.  The  concentration  of  population  there  has  a  strong  impact  on  the\nsurrounding  environment,  as  people  move  from  the  outer  islands  to  the  capital.  The\ngroundwater lens has been depleted, and some land has been reclaimed using garbage, so that\na desalination plant has had to be constructed. Traffic on the island is quite congested. Noise\npollution is also present almost everywhere, mainly from construction work.\n\n2.\n\nEcological Resources\n\nThe  islands  of  the  Maldives  are  surrounded  by  coral  reefs,  which  provide  protection,\n11. \nfood, and income. The Maldivian economy relies on the tourism and fisheries industries, both of\nwhich are highly dependent on these reefs.\n\nThe  coral  reefs  of  the  Maldives  are  diverse,  with  209  species  of  coral  in  62  genera\n12. \nrepresenting in 15 families, and about 1096 species of reef fish. Among the marine mammals,\n12 species of whales in 10 genera, and 7 species of dolphins in 5 genera have been recorded\nfrom the Maldives and they have been given protected status since 15 May 1993. Five species\nof marine turtles inhabit the waters of the Maldives, and a ten-year moratorium has been applied\non taking of marine turtles since 24 June 1995.\n\nThe  tuna  pole  and  line  fishery,  the  traditional  fishery  for  centuries,  relies  on  a  constant\n\n13. \nsupply of live bait obtained from the reefs.\n\n14. \nFisheries targeted at reef resources have expanded rapidly in the last two decades and\nare mostly export oriented. Some of the groups that have been exploited are giant clams, sea\ncucumbers,  and  live  tropical  fish.  Due  to  the  unsustainable  nature  of  the  giant  clam  fishery,  a\nban on killing or extraction of giant clams was imposed in 1993.\n\n15. \nFive  species  of  spiny  lobsters  are  found  in  Maldives.  Export  of  lobsters  is  banned,  and\nthe  Government  declared  a  size  limit  on  collecting  lobsters  with  carapace  length  less  than  25\ncm in 1978.\n\n16.  Historically,  coral  was  mined  by  local  communities  for  the  construction  of  important\nbuildings.  In  the  early  1970s,  coral  mining  started  expanding  rapidly,  and  in  1992,  regulations\nwere put in place by the Government in an effort to regulate it.\n\n17. \nThe  extensive  coral  bleaching  incident  that  occurred  in  early  1998  decreased  the  live\ncoral cover on most reefs of the Maldives from 40-60 percent to 1-2 percent. The bleaching was\ndue  to  prolonged  thermal  stress,  probably  caused  by  elevated  sea  surface  temperatures\n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 9, page 3\n\ncoinciding with an El Nino Southern Oscillation event. Currently recovery processes are under\nway and many new corals can be seen on the reefs.\n\n18. \nThere are 25 protected dive sites in the Maldives, located in the tourist zones. All types of\nfisheries  are  banned  at  these  sites  except  bait  fishing  by  the  traditional  pole  and  line  tuna\nfishery.  However,  the  activities  at  these  sites  are  not  monitored  due  to  lack  of  a  proper\nmanagement system.\n\n3.\n\nHuman and Economic Development\n\n19. \nThe  Maldives  has  a  centralized  pattern  of  development,  with  much  of  the  activity\nconcentrated  in  the  capital  island  of  Male,  which  has  a  resident  population  of  62,519.  This  is\n25.5 percent of the total population of 244,814 recorded in the 1995 Census report. Among the\nislands  designated  as  atoll  capitals,  only  Kulhudhuffushi  (Haa  Dhaalu  Atoll),  Foahmulah\n(Gnaviyani  Atoll),  and  Hithadhoo  (Seenu  Atoll)  boast  a  population  in  excess  of  5,000  people.\nThere is also an increasingly high density of 334.3 persons/hectare in Male, while the average\ndensity for the entire nation is 26.1 persons/hectare.  The average household size stands at 9.3\nfor Male and 6.6 for the atolls.\n\n20. \nThe swelling population of Male is due to the rapid in-migration from the other islands, for\nthe  most  part  seeking  gainful  employment  opportunities  both  in  Male  and  at  the  surrounding\nresort islands as well as for educational purposes.  This trend has greatly influenced the marked\nfall  in  the  primary  sector,  and  the  comparable  growth  in  the  tertiary  sector  recorded    between\n1985 and 1995.\n\n21. \nThe Maldives\u2019 economy itself transformed from one relying mainly on traditional primary\nindustries to the tertiary.  Even though fishing is still the major economic activity and source of\nlivelihood for about 74 percent of the population living outside Male and the tourist resorts, its\nimpact  upon  the  overall  economy  of  the  country  has  markedly  reclined.  The  primary  sector\ncontribution  to  gross  domestic  product  in  1998  was  17.6  percent,  while  the  tertiary  sector\nrecorded 64.3 percent.\n\nThe  capital  is  the  seat  of  government.  The  administrative  atolls  are  the  basic  units  of\n22. \nadministration.  An atoll capital through its atoll office, is responsible for all the islands and its\ncommunities comprising the atoll unit.  The island offices report directly to their respective atoll\noffice on all matters of administration and development. Except for these atoll offices in each of\nthe 20 atoll units and their subordinate island offices in each administrative island of each atoll,\nall main institutions within the government structure are based in Male. Financial institutions of\ninternationally  acceptable  standards  are  established  in  Male  and,  apart  from  the  Bank  of\nMaldives,  which  has  eight  branches  in  the  atolls,  all  other  banks  restrict  their  activities  to  the\ncapital, which is the site of much of the country\u2019s commerce.\n\n23. \nThe  only international airport in the country is at Hulhule island, across from Male. The\nfour  domestic  (regional)  airports  are  near  the  atoll  capitals  of  Haa  Dhaalu,  Laamu,  Gaafu\nDhaalu, and Seenu atolls. The main international sea freight port is Male. Harbors around Male\nare constructed to competently handle the large numbers of inter-and intra-atoll sea transport.\nMore than 50 percent of the other administrative islands sport rock-filled jetties, pile-structures\nbeing evident at only a few islands.  However, the problem of ineffective natural harbors is being\ncombated  through  the  harbor-dredging  program  begun  in  1995.    More  than  half  of  the  atoll\ncapitals now have effective harbors.\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 9, page 4\n\nTransport  on  Male  is  facilitated  by  streets  and  roads,  whiclarger  streets,  pedestrian\n24. \ncrossings,  a  traffic  light  and  speed  breaker  system,  and  specified  parking  areas.  Drainage\nfacilities  run  along  either  side  of  all  paved  roads,  while  electric  and  telephone  cables  below\nground extend in a similar fashion.  In most other islands, roads are unpaved, and land transport\nis either by foot or by bicycle. Rarely is a vehicle such as a lorry or pickup used to carry goods.\nMore  vehicles  are  found  in  the  atoll  capitals,  especially  in  Kulhudhuffushi  (Haa  Dhaalu  Atoll),\nFonadhoo  (Laamu  Atoll),  Thinadhoo  (Gaafu  Dhaalu  Atoll),  Foahmulah  (Gnaviyani  Atoll),  and\nHithadhoo (Seenu Atoll).\n\n25. \nThe Maldives Water and Sanitation Authority undertakes water and sewerage operations\nin  Male  and  is  the  national  regulatory  body  for  such  services  throughout  the  country.\nDesalination plants pipe water to properties thoughout Male, while distribution points delivering\nwater  free  of  charge  are  located  at  regular  intervals,  mostly  because  the  groundwater  is  of  a\nvery  poor  quality  in  many  areas  of  the  capital.    In  the  atoll  regions,  groundwater  is  the  main\nsource  of  water  supply.  The  installation  of  private  and  community  rainwater  tanks  as  an\nalternative to groundwater is, however, encouraged.\n\n26. \nThe sewage system of Male has provision for sewer connections throughout the capital.\nAt  the  atoll  level,  only  26  percent  of  the  islands  have  proper  sanitation  facilities.  There  is  still\nwidespread  use  of  in-household  plots  and  beach  disposal.  The  work  of  installing  small-bore\nsewerage systems is progressing at island localities in an effort to introduce more effective and\nsafer sanitation practices.\n\n27.  Public  power  transmission  on  a  24-hour  basis  in  Male  by  the  State  Electric  Company\nLimited (STELCO) is via a power plant with a total capacity of 21.5 megawatts. Electricity supply\nis  provided  on  other  islands  by  STELCO,  private  resort  and  factory  operators,  private\nentrepreneurs, or community-owned and -operated facilities. According to the Ministry of Atolls\nAdministration,  at  the  end  of  1996,  5.6  percent  of  atoll  populations  lived  without  electricity,  77\npercent  had  access  to  it  for  5-12  hours  per  day,  and  only  17.6  percent  had  electric  power  for\nmore  than  12  hours  a  day.  At  present,  STELCO  provides  electricity  to  21  islands  through  17\npower stations, of which, 8 are in the atoll capitals.\n\n28.  A  four-tier  health  care  system  exists  in  the  Maldives.  The  Indira  Gandhi  Memorial\nHospital  and  the  Department  of  Public  Health  located  in  Male,  function  at  the  central  level,\nfollowed  by  regional  hospitals,  atoll  health  stations  and  family  health  sections  based  at  the\nisland  level.  The  five  regional  hospitals  are  in  the  atoll  capitals  of  Haa  Dhaalu  Atoll\n(Kulhudhuffushi),  Raa  Atoll  (Ugoofaaru),  Meemu  Atoll  (Muli),  Gaafu  Dhaalu  Atoll  (Thinadhoo),\nand Seenu Atoll (Hithadhoo).\n\n29.  Male  is  the  base  of  educational  activity.  Schools  are  either  government,  community,  or\nprivate  establishments.    There  are  only  two  schools  outside  Male  (cid:190)\n  the  Northern  Secondary\n(Kulhudhuffyshi,  Haa  Dhaalu  Atoll  capital)  and  Southern  Secondary  (Hithadhoo,  Seenu  Atoll\ncapital) schools  (cid:190)\n that are sufficiently equipped in infrastructure and staff to cater to students\nat  a  regional  level.    At  the  atoll  level,  the  Atoll  Educations  provide  up  to  secondary  level\neducation,  while  the  Atoll  Primary  Schools  offer  up  to  middle  school  education.    All\nadministrative islands in the Maldives have at least one island school. The Maldives College of\nHigher Education the only institution offering further educational opportunities, and the only two\nschools offering higher secondary education, are located in Male.\n\n30.  Dhivehi  Raajjeyge  Gulhun  (Dhiraagu)  established  in  1988,  provides  national  and\ninternational  telecommunications  services  from  its  headquarters  in  Male.  At  present,  Dhiraagu\n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 9, page 5\n\nhas established six operations (five in atoll capitals) and three maintenance units (one in an atoll\ncapital) in different locations across the country. Every inhabited island in the Maldives now has\npayphones.\n\n4.\n\nQuality of Life Values\n\n31. \nTraditionally, tuna pole and line fishery has been the preferred source of protein, and the\nmajor  source  of  employment  and  foreign  earnings  in  the  Maldives.  With  the  development  of\ntourism and other types of fisheries in the past two decades, the importance of this fishery has\nlessened.  Initially,  the  new  fisheries  provided  additional  employment  for  the  fishermen  during\ntuna fishing off-season but more recently, the fisheries based on reef resources have become\nmore permanent.\n\n32. \nThe tourism industry of the Maldives began in the early 1970s and has rapidly expanded\nto 85 resort islands on 11 atolls. Resort islands are kept separate from the local villages, thus\nreducing the social impacts arising from tourism.\n\n33.  Male, the capital is 1 square mile and had a population of about 67,000 in 2000. It is the\nurban center, and people migrate there from the other islands in search of better employment\nopportunities and improved educational and health facilities.\n\n34.  One of the major anthropogenic impacts on the environment facing the Maldives today is\nthat  caused  by  improper  solid  waste  disposal.  The  direct  disposal  of  large  amounts  of\nnonbiodegradable  material  such  as  plastic  bags  onto  the  coast  and  the  reefs  leads  to\ndeterioration of the environment. Solid waste management is a major concern on most islands,\nand  proper  management  measures  to  dispose  of  waste  are  lacking.  Many  use  the  mangrove\nand  wetland  areas  as  their  garbage  dump,  not  seeing  the  importance  of  these  ecosystems  to\nbiodiversity  and  looking  at  them  as  breeding  grounds  for  mosquitoes.  This  problem  has  been\ndealt  with  around  Male,  where  a  landfill  island  has  been  identified  and  waste  disposal\nmechanisms put in place. Most of the tourist resorts use this site for their garbage disposal, and\nthis needs to be replicated in the other atolls.\n\nThe  village  islands  are  usually  clean,  and  the  island  women\u2019s  committees  have  weekly\n35. \norganized  sweeping  days  where  the  women  get  together  and  clean  the  island.  However,  the\nroads are unpaved and during the rainy season puddles can be observed due to lack of proper\ndrainage systems.\n\n36. \nThe  cost  of  living  in  the  Maldives  is  generally  quite  high  due  to  the  large  amount  of\nimported goods. Apart from marine resources, natural resources are minimal, and most things\nhave to be imported.\n\nC.\n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts, and Mitigation Measures\n\n1.\n\nScreening Procedure\n\n37. \nThe nature and design of the Information Technology Development Project does not lend\nitself  to  standard  screening  guidelines  recommended  for  projects  developed  by  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank.  Those  projects  where  screening  guidelines  have  been  drawn  up  are\nnormally located in a distinct area and there are significant, measurable physical changes taking\nplace during all phases of the project.\n\n\f47\n\nAppendix 9, page 6\n\n38.  Greater  environmental  impacts  are  expected  when  there  are  significant  disturbances  to\nthe  environment  during  both  the  construction  and  operational  phases,  which  is  the  case  in\nprojects  such  as  ports  and  harbor  development,  sewage  disposal  systems,  and  urban\ndevelopment  where  specific  criteria  are  set  for  screening.  However,  while  the  Project  involves\nvery  little  physical  infrastructure  development,  the  project  area  is  extensive  and  covers  nearly\nthe whole of the Maldives. Therefore broad screening of the different phases of the Project has\nbeen  carried  out.  The  screening  for  potential  environmental  impacts  has  been  carried  out  by\ninvestigating  those  impacts  that  could  occur  during  the  construction,  implementation,  and\noperational phases of the Project.\n\n2.\n\nConstruction Phase\n\nIn the design of the Project, very few building and construction works are proposed. The\n39. \nlimited work that will be carried out consists of the construction of two buildings in Male and the\nlaying of a fiber optic cable ring around Male for the government network.\n\nThe National Computer Center (NCC) will be a key node on the Male backbone network\n40. \nand  will  consist  of  two  separate  structures:  a  five-storey  office  facility  and  a  three-storey\nadjoining  structure,  which  will  house  the  network  operation  center.  The  network  will  be\npartitioned  into  three  layers:  the  backbone,  the  distribution  layer,  and  the  access  layer.  The\nbackbone  will  have  a  dual  (single  mode)  fiber  optic  ring  architecture.  Forty  buildings  housing\ngovernment  facilities  will  be  grouped  into  approximately  20  building  clusters.  Larger  building\nclusters  will  be  served  by  interconnecting  them  with  a  smaller  distribution  network.  These\ndistribution  networks  will  have  a  multimode  fiber  optic  ring  or  hierarchical  architecture  as\nappropriate for the size of the distribution network.\n\n41.  During the construction phase of the NCC there is a risk of contributing to salinization of\nthe groundwater of Male, as some water needs to be pumped out for laying the foundations for\nthe multi-storey buildings. The water will go to the sea as runoff or by the storm water drainage,\nthus  contributing  further  to  the  salinization  of  Male  groundwater,  which  is  already  in  very  bad\ncondition.\n\n42.  During  the  construction  phase  of  this  building,  there  may  be  some  disruption  to  the\nnormal  road  traffic,  particularly  for  people  walking  on  the  pavement.  Measures  such  as\ncontaining building materials within the building site and working during the night when traffic is\nless will be taken to minimize the disturbance.\n\n43.  Both the above environmental impacts, identified for the construction phase of the NCC\nbuilding  are  considered  to  be  nonsignificant  in  view  of  the  existing  situation  in  Male  and\nparticularly in isolation for this Project only.\n\n44. \nThe  fiber  optic  ring  to  be  laid  around  Male  for  the  backbone  layer  and  the  distribution\nlayer  of  the  network  will  have  to  be  laid  in  the  paved  roads,  which  is  not  expected  to  have\nserious environmental consequences. However, to reduce any impacts it is recommended that\nexisting facilities being used for other utilities such as telephone lines, and electricity cables be\nutilized to install the fiber optic ring too.\n\n45. \nThere are two forecast consequences while laying the fiber optic cable. One is disruption\nof  traffic  and  resulting  congestion.  Mitigation  measures  for  limiting  this  inconvenience  will  be\ncareful planning and timing of the works. The other is possible damage to existing facilities such\nas  water  pipes,  electricity  cables,  and  sewage  and  drainage  systems.  Measures  to  avoid  any\n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 9, page 7\n\naccident  should  include  careful  study  of  the  existing  facilities  by  consulting  the  relevant\ninstitutions.  In  addition,  while  laying  the  fiber  optic  cable,  good  supervision  and  care  are\nrequired.\n\nThe atoll backbone network will provide access to government services and facilities from\n46. \nconnection  points  in  the  atolls.  In  the  first  phase,  no  additional  physical  infrastructure  will  be\nbuilt,  and  existing  telecommunications  infrastructure  will  be  used.  Therefore,  no  significant\nenvironmental impacts are envisaged.\n\n47. \nIt  is  also  generally  noted  that  the  information  industry  is  environment  friendly  as\ncompared with other types of industries. It is based on the four most abundant, least expensive\nand  most  widely  distributed  items  in  the  world  \u2013  silicon,  the  material  used  to  make\nmicroelectronic  devices;  lightwaves  and  airwaves  the  communication  media  of  the  future;  and\nhuman brain power, the principal source of motivation in the information age.\n\n48.  During the implementation phase, no significant negative impacts on the environment are\nforecast,  as  it  mainly  concerns  training  of  people  and  setting  up  an  information  technology\nadvisory committee whose role is to determine ICT policies.\n\n3.\n\nImplementation Phase\n\n4.\n\nOperational Phase\n\n49. \nThe impacts during the operational phase are difficult to quantify, as they will contribute\nindirectly  to  overall  development.  It  is  predicted  that,  with  enhanced  communications  between\ngovernment agencies in Male and also with the atolls, the sharing of data will result in improved\nmanagement  of  environmental \nresources.  This  will  also  strengthen  enforcement  of\nenvironmental  laws  and  regulations  by  increasing  awareness  and  speeding  up  the  law\nenforcement  process.  At  present,  the  process  of  reporting  environmental  law  offenders  to\nconcerned  agencies  takes  a  long  time  due  to  lack  of  fast  communication.  This  should  be\nrectified with the increased interaction between Male and the other islands.\n\nFaster and more efficient communication between Male and the other islands will create\n50. \nmore  employment,  and  decrease  the  migration  of  people  to  Male,  thus  limiting  the  negative\nconsequences of an overcrowded area. When compared with other industrial work, \u201cinformation\nwork\u201d  is  more  environment  friendly.  The  use  of  advanced  communication  services  to\ncommunicate  with  co-workers  from  home  or  around  the  world  is  an  attractive  alternative  to\nmovement toward already crowded businesses.\n\n51.  Environmental awareness is at the root of environmental conservation. It is expected that\nthe  level  of  knowledge  pertaining  to  the  environment  will  increase  among  the  local  people,\nespecially the students, with the help of the Internet.\n\n52. \nTelecommunications  and  information  technologies  have  an  important  role  to  play  in\nprotecting  the  environment  and  in  promoting  development  activities  at  low  risk  to  the\nenvironment.  The  application  of  these  technologies  can  reduce  paperwork,  which  ultimately\nsaves forests.\n\n\f49\n\nAppendix 9, page 8\n\nD.\n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\n53.  As stated in the previous section, the environmental impacts arising from this Project are\ndifficult  to  quantify  independently  from  the  other  activities  taking  place  simultaneously  in  the\nproject  location  as  well  as  from  the  consequences  of  past  activities.  Consequently,  it  will  be\ndifficult to monitor the impacts from the Project and the activities leading to them.\n\n54. \nIt  can  be  argued  that  collecting  and  analyzing  groundwater  samples  could  monitor\nsaltwater  intrusion  caused  by  the  pumping  out  of  groundwater  from  the  freshwater  lens  while\nlaying  the  foundations  of  the  building  for  the  NCC.  Unfortunately,  the  hydrologic  mechanisms\nruling  the  freshwater  lens  rule  out  this  possibility.  When  groundwater  is  pumped  out,  the\ngroundwater table is lowered locally. This local decline in the groundwater table is going to be\nreplaced by fresh water coming from neighboring parts of the freshwater lens as well as by an\nupwelling  of  the  saltwater  underlying  the  freshwater.  This  salt  water  compressed  into  the\ncalcium  carbonate  matrix  forming  the  island  substrate  tends  to  rise  into  the  soil,  thinning  the\nfreshwater  lens.    The  disturbances  from  the  natural  flow  of  groundwater  through  the  island\nsubstrates,  which  is  vertical  down  from  the  surface  and  out  toward  the  sea,  have  a  double\neffect.  This  type  of  disturbance  to  the  water  flow  causes  concentration  of  water  of  low  quality\ninside  the  freshwater  lens  reaching  from  sewage  pits,  and  from  the  peripheral  areas  being\nreclaimed  with  garbage,  and  thus  reduces  the  freshwater  lens.  This  effect  is  quite  difficult  to\nmeasure for the Project, when we know that the estimate of water usage for flushing only for the\npopulation of Male exceeds the quantity of water that should be taken out of the freshwater lens\nfor its sustainable management. In a lot of places the freshwater has a very distinctive smell of\nsulphur, ammonia, and oil.\n\n55.  Another  effect  forecast  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  is  that  the  improved\ncommunication system would limit migration from the islands to Male and therefore reduce the\nenvironmental pressure on the Male area. If this phenomenon is observed in the years to come,\nit  would  be  hard  to  quantify  the  respective  importance  of  the  present  Project  and  regional\ndevelopment projects.\n\n56. \nImproved data sharing among the different government and parastatal agencies, which is\nalso  anticipated  as  a  major  outcome  of  the  Project,  would  affect  the  importance  of  the\nenvironmental  part  in  management  policies  in  the  Maldives.  It  would  be  hard  to  quantify  the\nimportance  of  this  Project  only,  as  many  other  measures  and  activities  tend  to  lead  into  that\nsame direction.\n\nE.\n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\nThe  proposed  Project  represents  a  stepping  stone  for  island  development.  It  is\n\n57. \nanticipated to improve the overall quality of life of Maldivians.\n\n58.  Such infrastructure will enable people from the islands to communicate with co-workers\nfrom  Male  and  other  islands  and  is  an  attractive  alternative  to  movement  toward  already\ncrowded businesses. Tertiary activities could then spread out toward the remoter areas of the\nMaldives.\n\n59. \nThe only negative impacts on the environment of such a project have been identified to\noccur during the construction phase. These impacts are very minimal and are several orders of\nmagnitude lower than the benefits expected during the operational phase.\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 9, page 9\n\nImproved  communication  between  the  capital  and  the  other  islands  will  enable  more\n60. \npeople to share data for management purposes, which in turn will improve the management of\nenvironmental resources. It will also facilitate strengthening of the enforcement of environmental\nlaws and regulations.\n\n61.  A  link  to  the  outside  world  through  the  Internet  will  increase  environmental  awareness\namong  the  public,  which  is  a  very  useful  tool  in  the  proper  management  of  environmental\nresources.\n\nF.\n\nConclusions\n\n62. \nThe screening process for this Project, as compared with other larger and more complex\nprojects involving a lot of physical infrastructure, enables easy identification of any impacts that\ncould be possibly encountered. It has been shown how difficult it would be to isolate the specific\nimpacts  from  this  Project  with  regard  to  the  sum  of  other  physical  infrastructure  development\nworks  in  Male.  Unless  the  impacts  of  all  other  construction  works  going  on  in  the  area  that\nwould  be  directly  effected  by  this  Project  are  quantified,  it  is  envisaged  that  the  outcome  of\nseparate  environmental  monitoring  for  this  Project  would  be  ineffective.  In  the  atolls,  as  there\nwill be no additional infrastructure established, no further study is required.\n\nIn conclusion, as this Project does not have significant negative environmental impacts,\n63. \nthe  need  for  an  environmental  impact  assessment  does  not  arise.  Monitoring  and  mitigation\nmeasures for the limited impacts identified will be sufficient.\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 10, page 1\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Project aims at improvements in three main areas: (i) in public sector management\n1. \nthrough the establishment of a wide area network linking government departments and entities\nincluding  those  in  remote  and  outlying  islands  (networking  component);  (ii)  in  the  interactions\nbetween the Government and the business community and citizens in general, including those\nliving  in  the  outer  islands  (applications  component);  and  (iii)  in  the  telecommunications\n(telecoms)  sector  through  sector  reform  (sector  reform  component).  Since  each  of  these\ncomponents  could  be  implemented  separately,  for  purposes  of  the  economic  analysis  each\nshould  be  justified  in  its  own  right.    However,  the  three  areas  of  improvement  form  a  logical\npackage  and  are  mutually  reinforcing.    Also,  when  all  three  improvements  are  implemented\nsuccessfully, the benefits of the whole package are likely to be larger than the sum of the three\nas self-standing components.\n\nThe economic analysis calculated the economic costs and benefits comparing the \u201cwith-\n2. \nProject\u201d and \u201cwithout-Project\u201d situations. The economic life of the project facilities was assumed\nto be 15 years with no residual value at the end of the evaluation period, taking into account the\ncost elements of each component, e.g., the networking component consists of fiber optic cable\ninfrastructure,  networking  equipment,  and  labor  for  designing,  installation,  configuration,  and\ntesting, and the application component comprises largely labor for designing. All cost elements\nare valued at border prices, using a world price numeraire, with all taxes and duties excluded. A\nstandard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to nontraded items and labors.\n\nB.\n\nNetworking\n\n1.\n\nVarious Options for Networking\n\n3. \nThe government network can be laid in two ways: first by using carrier-based services,\nand  second  by  deploying  the  Government\u2019s  own  network.  The  incumbent  monopoly  service\nprovider currently offers 64 kilobyte per second private line facilities within Male, which provide\ninsufficient  capacity  to  support  the  expected  throughput  of  the  government  network.  Although\nhigh-speed  links  for  private  lines  could  overcome  capacity  limitations,  the  incumbent  operator\nhas no incentive to develop such services, as few private sector customers need them. Frame\nrelay1  services  provide  a  virtual  private  line  network  with  enhanced  capabilities  for  both\nmanagement  and  flexibility.  The  incumbent  operator,  however,  does  not  offer  frame  relay\nservices, nor does the private sector have sufficient capacity to require this service within Male.\n\n4. \nAsynchronous  digital  subscriber  line  (ADSL)  could  be  used  for  parts  of  the  Male\ngovernment network if available from the incumbent operator. The incumbent operator does not\noffer  ADSL  services,  and  is  doubtful  about  the  feasibility  of  offering  them  because  of  several\ntechnical problems. Furthermore, ADSL is not the most appropriate technology for providing a\nweb  environment  for  government  ministries  because  of  asymmetric  transmission  speed.\nIntegrated services digital network which the incumbent operator plans to offer, will be an ideal\ntechnology  for  the  atoll  network,  but  not  for  Male  network  because  of  its  limited  capacity.\nAsynchronous transfer mode (ATM) technology offers the capacity, flexibility, and management\ncapabilities  that  would  be  needed  long  into  the  future  for  the  Male  government  network.  The\n\n                                                          \n1  Highspeed transmission method, switching packets of data through its network to their destination. Access to the\n\nnetwork is via frame relay access devices which translates the data into frame relay packets.\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nincumbent  operator,  however,  does  not  offer  ATM  services,  nor  does  it  have  the  fiber  optic\ninfrastructure on which ATM operates.\n\n5. \nTwo  technologies  could  be  considered  in  developing  a  government-deployed  network:\nwireless  and  fiber  optic  cable.  The  deployment  of  a  wireless  Male  government  network  will\nrequire extensive development of local expertise to ensure that it will be able to meet the non\nstop operational needs of the Government. Moreover, the use of a new technology to support a\ncritical  function  imposes  far  too  great  a  risk  to  be  borne  by  the  Government.  The  government\nnetwork  should  be  designed  so  that  no  single  failure  can  cause  a  complete  system  failure.\nAccordingly, a robust and fault-tolerant communication technology is required, which is provided\nby a high performance fiber optic dual ring network. The multilayer switching campus of a fiber\noptic  network  provides  the  reliability,  flexibility,  and  support  for  long-term  growth.  Low-level\ncommunications  and  high-level  networking  and  transport  functions  can  be  readily  replaced  as\ncommunications  needs  and  technology  expertise  within  the  Government  evolve  over  time.  An\noptical fiber-based government-deployed network is a least-cost, technologically viable option in\nthe medium- and long-term perspective.\n\n2.\n\nBenefits and Beneficiaries\n\n6. \nThe  benefits  of  the  establishment  of  a  government  network  are  wide  ranging,  and\ninclude  improved  efficiency,  transparency,  and  accountability  of  government  activities.  More\nspecifically,  decision  making  can  be  improved,  and  the  cost  of  government  activities  can  be\nreduced  through  (i)  reduced  cost  of  data  collection,  (ii)  faster  processing  and  availability  of\ninformation, (iii) wider availability of information and data in a uniform format across all branches\nof government, (iv) reductions in travel and paper transmission between offices and islands, and\n(v) more effective communication between the various branches of government. Some benefits\nare  direct,  while  others  are  indirect.  The  beneficiaries  of  these  improvements  are  all  citizens\nwho will benefit from more efficient management of the nation\u2019s resources.\n\n7. \nNot all of these benefits, such as greater accountability and transparency of government,\nlend themselves to easy measurement and quantification. The increased productivity in routine\noperations  and  activities,  however,  can  be  quantified,  as  this  translates  into  more  output  with\ngiven human resources; or alternatively, this greater productivity will allow current output levels\nto  be  maintained  with  reduced  human  resources.  For  example,  in  the  Ministry  of  Education,\ninternal reporting from the schools to the ministry headquarters involves a large amount of data\nthat are currently processed manually.  Electronic reporting by the schools will avoid double or\ntriple inputting and validation of data, and will also avoid various data processing activities.\n\n3.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nIn view of the above, the key parameters of the economic analysis are (i) the nature of\n8. \nthe  benefits  that  are  taken  into  consideration,  i.e.,  the  increased  productivity  in  routine\noperations and associated savings in personnel numbers and costs; and (ii) the scale at which\nthese  savings  will  be  realized,  i.e.,  the  demand  aspect.    This  second  parameter  relates  to  the\nlevel of usage of the network at the time of introduction and the pace at which it will grow over\ntime.  Usage (or demand) will depend very much on (i) the design of the networking system \u2013\nhow  user  friendly  it  is  and  how  obvious  the  advantages  will  be  for  its  users;  (ii)  the  phase-in\narrangements, and the preparation and training that will be provided; and (iii) the commitment\non  the  part  of  the  Government  to  rapid  transition  from  a  predominantly  paper-based  mode  of\noperation to a predominantly paperless mode.\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\nIn  estimating  initial  usage  and  growth  in  usage,  the  following  factors  have  been  taken\n9. \ninto account:  (i) the high level of commitment of the Government towards networking, inter alia,\nbecause  once  the  infrastructure  and  applications  have  been  made  operational  their  use  on  a\ndaily  basis  entails  limited  cost,  while  continued  use  of  the  old  fragmented  legacy  systems  will\noverburden staff; (ii) the Government\u2019s personnel policies, which are aimed at curbing the rate\nof growth in personnel and at redesigning government functions and activities, i.e., through clear\njob  descriptions  and  an  appropriate  reward  system;  (iii)  the  relatively  positive  attitudes  toward\nnetworking and the general level of receptivity of government staff to a predominantly paperless\nmode of operation as revealed through discussions during appraisal; and (iv) the accompanying\nmeasures  that  the  Government  would  introduce  to  make  a  rapid,  yet  effective,  transition  to\nnetworking,  learning  from  experiences  in  other  countries  and  other  organizations,  including  in\nthe  Maldives,  and  cognizant  of  the  attitudes  and  resistance  of  government  workers  to  change\nwhen change is poorly prepared.     \n\n10. \nThus, the economic analysis focuses on the savings in government employment made\npossible  following  the  improved  productivity  of  staff  through  networking.  The  Government\u2019s\nexisting personnel policies, which aim at reducing the rate of growth in government employment\nwhile  meeting  the  needs  of  a  growing  population,  represent  the  frame  of  reference  for  the\n\u201cwithout\u201d the Project case.  Under the \u201cwith\u201d the Project case this natural growth in government\nservices  could  be  provided  with  existing  staff  resources  (cid:190)\n  after  allowing  for  a  three-year\ntransition period (cid:190)\n\n through increased efficiencies obtained from networking.\n\n11. \nThe  number  of  personnel  that  is  consistent  with  current  government  policies  and\npractices  has  been  estimated  for  the  \u201dwith\u201d  and  \u201cwithout\u201d  the  Project  scenarios  based  on  the\nfollowing.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii) \n\nFor the without the Project scenario: it is estimated that during the first five years\nof the project period the annual increase in the Government employment would\nbe on the order of 300, or 1.5 percent of the existing establishment. This rate of\ngrowth is significantly less than the actual growth during recent years but reflects\nthe  Government\u2019s  policy  to  contain  growth.  During  the  remainder  of  the  project\nperiod the increase would be 1 percent per annum.\n\nUnder the with the Project case: during the first three years, employment would\ncontinue  to  grow  at  the  same  pace  as  in  the  without  the  Project  case  or  1.5\npercent.  Starting in the fourth year after the installation of the intranet, however,\nowing  to  the  efficiencies  achieved  through  the  networking,  there  would  be  no\nfurther  growth  in  government  employment.  During  the  initial  three-year  period,\nsignificant  change  in  the  skill  mix  would  take  place,  as  there  would  be  an\nexpansion  of  ICT  personnel  while  traditional  skills  relating  to  the  manual\nprocesses would not reduce at a corresponding rate.\n\n12. \nBased  on  the  above  outlined  differences  in  personnel  numbers  between  \u201cwith\u201d  and\n\u201cwithout\u201d the Project, the savings in government personnel amount to 309 staff five years after\nthe start of the investment, growing to more than 2,960 after 15 years.\n\n13. \nThe economic cost of networking at mid-2001 prices, including base cost plus 5 percent\nfor  physical  contingencies,  net  of  taxes  and  duties  and  adjusted  with  the  standard  conversion\nfactor for the Maldives, amounts to Rf71.4 million. Annual maintenance and operating costs are\nestimated  at  Rf6.5  million.  The  average  annual  salary  cost  of  government  personnel  whose\nnumbers  would  be  reduced  in  the  with  the  Project  case  is  estimated  at  Rf35,000  (salary  plus\n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 10, page 4\n\nbenefits).  The  savings  in  government  payroll  expenditures,  adjusted  with  the  standard\nconversion factor for the Maldives, would grow from Rf9.7 million in the fifth year following the\nstart  of  implementation  to  Rf93.2  million  in  year  15  after  implementation.  On  this  basis,  the\neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) is calculated as 19 percent (Table A10.1).\n\n4.\n\nSensitivity and Risk Analysis\n\n14. \nThe  above  results  are  sensitive  to  the  rate  at  which  the  efficiencies  will  effectively  be\nachieved, i.e., Government\u2019s ability to stabilize employment levels. The impact of a slower pace\nin achieving the efficiencies has been tested as follows: If the savings in government personnel\nwere 25 percent less than assumed in the base case, the EIRR would still be 15 percent with a\nswitching value of 0.85. If the stabilization in the total number of government personnel would\noccur after five years instead of after three years as assumed in the base case, the EIRR would\nbe 13 percent with a switching value of 0.64. The risk that these personnel reduction objectives\nwill not be achieved is small, given that the Government has already initiated a policy to contain\nthe growth of its personnel.\n\nC.\n\nE-government2 Applications\n\nThe  applications  that  would  be  financed  under  the  Project  have  each  been  evaluated\n\n15. \nseparately, as outlined below.\n\n1.\n\nNational Citizen Identity Card Application\n\nA  large  number  of  government  organizations  require  personal  identification  (ID)\n16. \ninformation  as  a  routine  input  to  establish  and  update records  and  data  bases  in  order  to\nprovide  their  services.  The  benefits  for  government  organizations  of  being  able  to  access\nrelevant  core  personal  ID  data  (such  as  ID  card  number,  name,  complete  address,  date  and\nplace  of  birth,  gender,  blood  group,  parents\u2019  names)  from  the  Department  of  National\nRegistration are numerous and include (i) time savings on account of the key data having to be\ninput  only  once,  (ii)  time  savings  owing  to  the  fact  that  the  data  do  not  need  checking  when\nbeing  accessed,  (iii)  automatic  update  for  all  users  of  any  changes  in  the  core  data,  and  (iv)\nfacilitation  of  exchange  of  data  between  ministries  and  agencies  as  all  use  the  same  core  ID\ndata. The beneficiaries of this greater efficiency are all the citizens of the nation, who will share\nthe benefits of a more efficient government.\n\nIt  follows  that  three  parameters  are  of  critical  importance  for  the  economic  analysis:  (i)\n17. \nthe nature and level of the benefit that is taken into consideration, i.e., the various time savings\nidentified  above  to  be  realized  from  accessing  and  using  the  personal  ID  records  from  the\nnational  ID  register  rather  than  creating  and  updating  such  records  in  each  agency;  (ii)  the\npotential maximum use that can be made of the application; and (iii) the initial use made of the\napplication  and  the  rate  at  which  the  level  of  use  will  grow  toward  the  full  potential.    Each  of\nthese factors is evaluated below starting with the last two, which concern the demand aspect of\nthe analysis.\n\n18. \nPotential Maximum Use. Since the benefits of the National Citizen ID Card application\ncan be fully realized only once the government networking is fully operational, the analysis will\nassume that this is the case and also that all relevant departments will link into the ID Card data\n\n                                                          \n2    E-government  refers  to  the  use  by  government  agencies  of  information  technologies  that  have  the  ability  to\n\ntransform relations with citizens, businesses, and other arms of Government.\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 10, page 5\n\nbase. Thus, the maximum potential demand is dependent on (i) the departments that are linked\nto the National Citizen ID Card application, and (ii) the number of functions and applications in\nthese  departments  that  require  basic  ID  information.  Detailed  estimates  of  the  number  of\ninstances each department has to create/access a personal record have been developed based\non a review of the mission and activities of each department in serving its various client groups,\nincluding  students,  businesses,  households,  and  citizens  in  general.  The  departments  and\norganizations  that  were  considered  included:  Immigration,  Inland  Revenue,  National  Hospital,\nCustoms, Male\u2019 Municipality, Atoll Administration, National Security, Education, Finance, Health,\nLabor,  Justice,  Trade,  Transport,  and  Youth.    For  some  of  these,  such  as  the  Immigration\nDepartment in its monitoring of foreign workers, more than one access to the ID data base per\nyear  was  assumed.    On  this  basis,  the  number  of  instances  where  the  various  departments\nwould access the core ID information from the National ID database was estimated at 1.4 million\nannually.\n\n19. \nInitial Use and Growth Towards Full Potential. The initial use of the ID data base by\nthe various departments will depend on the quality of the design of the application, the training\nprovided  to  those  who  will  use  the  application,  the  quality  of  preparation  prior  to  generalized\nintroduction, and the level of commitment of the Government toward an effective introduction of\nthis  application.    It  is  considered  that,  even  under  the  best  of  circumstances,  full  maximum\nimplementation  of  the  application  will  not  be  achieved  during  the  first  year.  For  the  economic\nanalysis the following ramp up toward the maximum potential has been assumed: the first year\nafter  introduction,  only  50  percent  of  potential  use;  second  year,  75  percent;  third  year,  90\npercent; and fourth year, 100 percent.  Thereafter, access would grow in line with the growth of\npopulation in general, at about 2 percent per annum.\n\n20. \nTime  Savings.  Time  savings  can  be  made  by  the  relevant  departments  because  they\nwill  not  need  to  enter  the  information  themselves,  nor  need  to  update  by  themselves  the  core\npersonal ID data, nor to have to verify the accuracy of the basic ID data. These time savings are\nestimated  at  a  total  of  15  minutes  per  interaction/transaction.  The  hourly  time  cost  (based  on\nsalary plus benefits) of government personnel whose time is saved in the process is estimated\nat Rf21.\n\nThe cost of developing the application for providing this interface with all other users in\n21. \nthe  Government,  after  adjustment  with  the  standard  conversion  factor, is  estimated  at  Rf10.1\nmillion.  The  annual  operating  cost  is  estimated  at  Rf0.92  million.  On  this  basis,  the  EIRR  is\ncalculated  as  42  percent  (Table  A10.2).  This  outcome  is  sensitive  to  the  pace  at  which\nministries will be linking in the National ID registry for their routine needs and the assumption of\nthe  time  saved  each  time  the  central  ID  database  is  accessed.  If  it  takes  six  years  for  the  full\npotential  to  be  reached,  the  EIRR  would  be  31  percent  with  a  switching  value  of  0.56.\nFurthermore,  if  in  addition  only  10  minutes  would  be  saved  each  time  the  data  base  is\naccessed, the EIRR would still be 21 percent with a switching value of 0.85.\n\n2.\n\nHospital Information System\n\nImproving  information  management  within  the  public  hospital  and  linking  it  into  the\n22. \ngovernment  network  will  not  only  reduce  operating  costs  of  the  hospital  through  increased\nefficiency,  but  also  enhance  patient  care  by  enabling  electronic  provision  of  medical\nconsultation.  The  potential  efficiencies  arising  from  the  use  of  ICT  within  a  hospital  setting\ninclude (i) single patient registration; (ii) instant availability of medical records; (iii) reduction in\nunnecessary  (or  redundant)  physician  orders;  (iv)  reduction  in  adverse  drug  events;  (v)\nreduction  in  chart  pulls;  (vi)  improved  turnaround  of  test  results;  (vii)  elimination  of  paper;  and\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 10, page 6\n\n(viii)  detailed,  real-time  cost  information  available  by  department  or  procedure.  These\nefficiencies  translate  into  time  savings  of  scarce  personnel,  physicians,  and  support  staff\nwhereby  the  same  staff  is  able  to  attend  to  a  larger  number  of  patients.  These  are  the  direct\nbenefits  that  are  quantified  for  this  evaluation.  Other  benefits,  which  include  the  benefits  from\ntelemedicine  (which  also  result  in time  cost  and  travel  cost  savings  by  patients  in  the  outer\nislands), better quality of patient care, and faster decision making in urgent situations, have not\nbeen estimated.\n\nFrom  the  standpoint  of  operating  efficiencies  and  the  introduction  of  ICT  a  hospital  is\n23. \ncomparable  to  a  business.    ICT  is  introduced  in  a  planned  and  controlled  way  according  to  a\ncarefully planned schedule and based on a design that meets the requirements of the nature of\nthe  business  and  the  operating  environment.  The  main  challenge  is  one  of  correct  design\nwhereby  supply  and  demand  are  carefully  equated  at  the  design  stage  so  as  to  achieve\nappropriate  return  on  the  investment.  Nevertheless,  at  this  point,  it  is  possible  to  quantify  the\nproductivity  improvements  that  can  be  achieved  based  on  a  broad  comparison  of  operating\nindicators  of  hospitals  at  different  efficiency  levels.  The  key  factors  for  the  economic  analysis\nare  therefore  (i)  efficiency  levels  actually  achieved  in  comparable  country  settings  and  which\ncan be achieved in the Maldives, (ii) the time savings and associated cost savings in the various\nprocedures and treatments that can obtained through these higher efficiency levels, and (iii) the\nefficiency level that can be achieved in the initial years following introduction of the ICT and the\nnumber of years it will take to achieve the efficiency of well managed hospitals in a comparable\ncountry setting.  Each of these factors is evaluated below.\n\n24. \nThe  scope  for  improved  efficiency  is  estimated  by  comparing  broad  productivity  ratios\nobtained under current, mostly manual, operating procedures with ratios that can be obtained in\na  modern  ICT  environment  as  evidenced  by  hospitals  in  comparable  settings  that  have\nintroduced  these  technologies.  That  it  is  possible  to  achieve  these  levels  in  the  Maldivian\ncontext has already been demonstrated at the other main hospital in Male. Current productivity\nlevels\u2013in terms of activity per doctor and activity per unit of other staff \u2013 have been derived from\na  review  of  operating  indicators  at  the  hospital.    Achievable  productivity  levels  have  been\ndeveloped from current productivity levels. For doctors it is estimated that a 25 percent increase\nin productivity can be achieved, while for other staff a 90 percent increase should be feasible.\n\n25. \nTaking into account the Maldivian context it is assumed that these improvements will be\nintroduced  progressively  in  steps  over  a  four-year  period  following  introduction  of  the  ICT\nsystem.  During the first year, the efficiency would only be 25 percent of the full potential; the\nsecond year this would rise to 50 percent, and to 75 percent during the third year. By the fourth\nyear the full potential would be achieved. The increased productivity would be absorbed mostly\nby the natural growth in the volume of activity of the hospital that is estimated to be 10 percent\nbased  on  past  trends.  To  the  extent  that  not  all  of  the  productivity  growth  of  support  and\nadministrative  staff  would  be  absorbed  by  increasing  levels  of  activity,  the  staff  savings  would\nbe absorbed through attrition.\n\n26. \nThe  annual  cost  (salary  plus  benefits)  of  a  doctor  is  estimated  at  Rf144,000,  while  the\ncost  of  other  staff  is  estimated  at  Rf36,000.  When  the  full  potential  of  productivity  gains  has\nbeen achieved, annual savings would amount to Rf21.7 million (at 2001 levels of activity). Not\nall  these  savings  can  necessarily  be  attributed  to  the  introduction  of  ICT  as  efficient\nmanagement procedures also play an important role in improving overall efficiency. Thus, it is\nassumed conservatively that 50 percent of these savings can be attributed to the introduction of\nICT.\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 10, page 7\n\nThe development cost of the application is estimated at Rf18.9 million net of taxes and\n27. \nduties  and  after  adjustment  with  the  standard  conversion  factor.  Annual  operating  costs  are\nestimated at 10 percent of investment costs. Based on the above, the EIRR is calculated as 35\npercent  (Table  A10.3).  This  outcome  is  sensitive  to  the  pace  at  which  the  productivity  gains\nwould  be  introduced.  If  it  is  assumed  that  it  will  take  six  years  to  achieve  the  full  potential  in\nproductivity gains the EIRR is still 29 percent with a switching value of 0.43.\n\n3.\n\nVessel, Vehicle, and Aircraft Registration Application\n\n28. \nThe  Ministry  of  Transport  issues  numerous  permits  and  licenses  relating  to  the\nownership and operation of seacraft, land vehicles, and aircraft.  Most of these licenses need to\nbe  renewed  on  an  annual  basis.  Currently,  obtaining  a  permit  or  a  renewal  of  a  permit  can\nrequire more than one personal trip to the ministry\u2019s offices in Male. At least one of such trips\ncould be avoided by providing the opportunity for completing on-line some of the interaction with\nthe ministry. For Male residents the benefits would comprise the time savings from avoiding the\ntrip to the ministry\u2019s office and for residents of the atolls the benefits would comprise both  the\ntime  and  transport  cost  savings  associated  with  that  trip.  For  residents  of  the  atolls  a  trip  to  a\ngovernment office can involve several days, depending on the distance to be covered. For more\nthan half the atolls this would involve a trip by air, as the distance to be covered is not a feasible\noption  by  seacraft.  The  cost  involved  in  these  trips  is  an  important  impediment  to  economic\nactivity in the atolls. The beneficiaries of the capability of providing part of the services on-line\ncomprise  (i)  the  businesses  and  citizens  who  already  have  the  means  to  access  the  Internet;\nand (ii) the lower income groups, where computer penetration is low, and for whom the usage\nfees are prohibitively high and who in the future would obtain access to e-government services\nthrough the Internet kiosks.\n\n29. \nThe key parameters for the economic evaluation are therefore (i) the potential maximum\nnumber of transactions that could be carried out electronically, i.e., the potential demand; (ii) the\nnumber of transactions that would be carried out electronically in the initial years following the\nlaunch  of  the  application,  and  the  growth  in  subsequent  years  toward  the  potential  maximum;\nand  (iii)  the  unit  savings  in  terms  of  time  and  travel  costs  for  Male  and  atoll  residents.  These\nfactors  will  be  examined  in  detail  below  starting  with  the  first  two,  which  relate  to  demand\naspects.\n\n30. \nThe maximum potential number of interactions/transactions between the ministry and its\nclient public, or the potential demand, is the total number of permits, registrations, and licenses\nto be issued annually. Based on a careful review of the number of seacraft, land vehicles, and\naircraft in use; the number of operators; and the various permits in effect, it is estimated that by\n2003 some 27,500 permits of various kinds would need to be obtained or renewed. Of this total\n16,200 would be from Male and 11,300 from the atolls.\n\n31. \nThe  number  of  transactions  that  would  be  carried  out  electronically  in  the  initial  years\nfollowing  the  launch  of  the  application  has  been  estimated  based  on  the  following:  (i)  the\nInternet  access  and  usage  survey  shows  that  70  percent3  of  households  and  86  percent  of\nbusinesses  in  Male,  and  12  percent  of  households  in  a  typical  atoll  locality,  have  Internet\naccess;  (ii)  the  survey  shows  that,  of  those  who  have  access,  77  percent  expressed  the\nintention to interact/transact with the Government if the possibility would be offered; and (iii) in\nother countries, when motor vehicle administrations start providing services on-line, public use\n\n                                                          \n3  The access rate per 100 units of population was found to be 23 percent; this reflects the fact that often more than\n\none person in the household is accessing the Internet.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 10, page 8\n\nof  this  facility  is  substantial\u2013exceeding  20  percent  in  the  initial  year.  Based  on  the  above,  it  is\nassumed that in the first year of availability of an on-line service, 15 percent of trips associated\nwith these permits would be avoided.  Growth in this percentage has been developed taking into\naccount  (i)  the  continued  strong  growth  in  computer  ownership;  (ii)  the  fact  that  the\nGovernment\u2019s  telecoms  sector  development  plan  provides  for  continued  improvements  in\ntelecoms access in the atolls, and further reductions in access and user charges (high access\nand usage charges are at present a major impediment to Internet usage in the Maldives); (iii) a\nprice  elasticity of  Internet  usage  greater than 1 as revealed by the Internet access and usage\nsurvey;  and  (iv)  that,  as  a  result  of  the  sector  reform  under  the  Project,  Internet  access  and\nusage  fees  will  be  lowered  by  50  percent.  On  this  basis  it  is  assumed,  that  at  the  end  of  the\nevaluation period, the percentage of trips being avoided through Internet use will have risen to\n70  percent.    Accordingly,  the  number  of  trips  saved  grows  from  4,125  in  the  first  year  of\nintroduction to 33,335 after 15 years.\n\n32. \nThe time and transport cost savings have been developed for atoll and Male residents,\nrespectively,  as  follows:  For  Male  residents  the  trip  time  that  can  be  saved  through  on-line\ninteraction  with  the  ministry  is  estimated  at  80  minutes  based  on  the  findings  of  the  Internet\naccess  and  usage  survey;  and  the  time  cost  is  estimated  at  Rf29  per  hour  saved,  including\nsalary plus benefits. For atoll residents, the key parameters for the estimation of the time cost\nsavings  are  (i)  average  travel  distance  to  Male  from  the  atolls,  calculated  at  251  kilometers\nbased on an average distance of the atolls to Male weighted by population size of the atolls; (ii)\naverage total trip duration in blocks of working days, estimated at three working days comprising\none day for the outward journey, one day for the transaction at government offices, and one day\nfor the return trip; and (iii) time cost, estimated at Rf29 including salary plus benefits per hour\nsaved and at Rf230 for a one-day work block.\n\n33. \nFor  estimating  the  resource  costs  associated  with  the  actual  trip  to  Male  for  atoll\nresidents, the following are key considerations: At the margin the resource cost associated with\na  single  trip  is  negligible  since  the  interisland  vessel  would  be  sailing  in  any  event  with  or\nwithout  that  single  trip.  The  same  holds  for  residents  of  atolls  further  afield  who  would  be\ntravelling by air. However, over time and when a significant reduction in travel is brought about\nthrough  replacement  of  traditional  procedures  involving  personal  visits  by  e-government\ninteractions, a reduction in the fleet size will ensue. This reduction in the volume of interisland\ntransport represents a saving in resource costs. For a single trip this saving can be equated with\nthe fare that represents the long-run marginal cost of interisland transport by sea or by air. On\nthis basis the resource cost associated with the weighted average trip distance is estimated at\nRf1,493.\n\n34. \nThe  development  cost  of  the  application  is  estimated  at  Rf7.6  million  net  of  taxes  and\nduties  and  after  adjustment  with  the  standard  conversion  factor.  Annual  operating  costs  are\nestimated at 30 percent of investment costs. Since there would be overcapacity in the intranet,\nthe marginal economic cost of the line usage can be assumed to be zero. Based on the above\nassumptions,  the  EIRR  of  this  application  is  calculated  as  40  percent  (Table  A10.4).  This\noutcome  is  very  sensitive  to  the  estimate  of  travel  cost  savings  obtained  by  atoll  residents.\nAssuming that these savings would be only 50 percent of those assumed in the base case, the\nEIRR would still be 31 percent with a switching value of 0.73.\n\n4.\n\nInternet Kiosks\n\n35. \nThe 20 network access sites to be established at atoll offices would provide a common\npoint  of  access  through  which  businesses  and  individual  citizens  can  access  the  various\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 10, page 9\n\ngovernment  websites,  initially  to  obtain  information  but  progressively  to  interact  with  the\ngovernment  and  ultimately  to  carry  out  transactions  as  more  and  more  applications  are\ndeveloped. The kiosks specifically target the population who do not have access to the Internet\nthrough  either  a  computer  at  a  school,  an  office,  or  a  business4  and  for  whom  access  to  the\nInternet and hence to e-government services is prohibitively high because of the cost of both the\nterminal computer stations and the Internet usage charges. The kiosks will accordingly aid the\npoor  who  cannot  afford  to  have  their  own  computer  and  pay  for  Internet  charges  in  getting\naccess to e-government services. The economic and social benefits of the kiosks are expected\nto justify the modest initial investment costs amounting to Rf3.7 million. A monitoring system will\nbe set up to closely track the usage of the kiosks and assess whether the expected economic\nand social benefits are realized. The expansion of the kiosks to other islands will be based on\nthe result of this benefit monitoring.\n\n36. \nThe kiosks will be linked into the atoll network that is part of the Government\u2019s wide area\nnetwork.  As  a  result,  public  access  to  government  information  through  the  kiosks  will  not  give\nrise to any additional financial outlays compared with the situation where there will be no kiosks.\nIn  the  long  run  there  is  no  risk  that  this  public  access  will  either  have  a  substantial  impact  on\ngovernment  finances  or  become  unsustainable.    It  is  expected  that,  with  the  rapid  growth  of\ncomputer  workstations  in  households  and  businesses,  the  need  for  free  public  access  to  the\nkiosks will  not  run  out  of  hand.  Once  Internet  access  and usage  fees  have  come  down  and\nbroader sections of the population have direct Internet access from a business, or from home,\nthe free internet/intranet kiosk will primarily be an opportunity for the lower income sections of\nthe  population.  But  providing  this  opportunity  is  an  objective  that  is  well  worth  pursuing  and\nsupporting under the Project.\n\nD.\n\nOverall Rate of Return of the Project\n\n37. \nThe combined costs and benefits of the components and subcomponents are shown in\nTable  A10.5.  The  total  costs  include  all  the  investment  and  operating  costs  related  to  the\ngovernment network component and the application component, including those of the kiosks.\nThe  total  benefits  include  the  benefits  calculated  with  respect  to  these  components  except  for\nthe kiosk component. The overall rate of return of the project is calculated as 25 percent.\n\n38.  When  all  the  negative  scenarios,  as  analyzed  for  each  component,  are  combined,  the\nEIRR is calculated as 15 percent for the overall Project.\n\n                                                          \n4  The Internet access and usage survey found that access to the Internet through a computer at school, in the office,\nin the family, or at an Internet caf\u00e9 is about 25 percent more frequent than access from a computer at home. This\nindicates  that  there  is  a  strong  case  for  the  Internet  kiosk  for  those  sections  of  the  population  that  do  not  have\nthese alternatives.\n\n\f 60\n\nAppendix 10, page
