B.Grimm will issue corporate bonds to finance these solar \nassets.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  subscribe  to  the  bonds  subject  to  their \nrecognition  as  green  bonds  in  compliance  with  the  International  Capital  Markets  Association's \nGreen  Bond  Principles  (GBP),  which  ADB  will facilitate.  ADB  will  also  assist  B.Grimm with  its \napplication to the Climate Bond Initiative (CBI) for the bonds to be certified as climate bonds under \nits Climate Bond Standards (CBS). ADB\u2019s participation  is crucial for GBP compliance and CBI \ncertification,  and  the  project  will  contribute  to  the  development  of  the  green  bond  market  in \nThailand and the region because these will be the first GBP-compliant green bonds issued by an \nenergy company, and the first CBI-certified climate bonds in Thailand. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProject  identification.  The  finance  sector  worldwide  is  beginning  to  respond  to  global \nwarming  and  climate  change,  and  joining  the  collective  efforts  to  tackle  these  unprecedented \nchallenges by mainstreaming climate mitigation and adaptation in its investment  decisions. An \nincreasing number of institutional investors and banks have begun to \u201cdecarbonize\u201d, i.e., suspend \nnew investment in and lending to coal- and other fossil-fuel-related companies and projects, and \nalso  divest  themselves  from  such  exposures  in  their  existing  portfolios.1 This  also  means  that \nmore  and  more  institutional  investors  are  prioritizing  and  favoring  investments  in  renewable \nenergy and climate change mitigation/adaptation, and looking for credible and verifiable means \nto  evidence  it.  They  need  to  assure  their  clients,  shareholders,  and  other  stakeholders  of \ntransparency  and  accountability,  and  to  demonstrate  that  they  are  responsible  investors.  This \ntransition is equally important for project developers and other issuers because any companies \nand projects with significant greenhouse gas emissions can be penalized in the capital markets, \nwhereas evidence of climate-friendly investments can result in favorable financing terms. \n\n \nGreen bonds  are innovative financial instruments to promote such  efforts, whereby  the \n4. \nproceeds  are  used  exclusively  to  finance  or  refinance,  in  part  or  in  full,  new  or  existing  green \nprojects with environmental or climate-related benefits. The GBP and CBS are the two most well-\nrecognized standards of green bonds based on international best practice, while there are other \nstandards as well as \u201cself-declared\u201d green bonds.2 Green bonds serve as a vehicle for financing \ninvestments  in  green  and  climate-smart  projects  that  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  a  low-\ncarbon future under the Paris Agreement on climate change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment of the United Nations. The green bond market is growing rapidly  and reached an \nannual issuance amount of $173 billion in 2017 globally, from just $0.5 billion in 2008. \n\n                                                 \n1  For instance, Standard Chartered Bank announced on 25 September 2018 that it had decided to end its financing of \nnew  coal-fired  power  plants:  https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-stanchart-coal/stanchart-quits-lending-to-new-coal-\nfired-power-stations-in-climate-change-effort-idUKKCN1M50I9 (last accessed 27 October 2018). \n\n2   Green  bonds  certified  by  the  CBI  to  be  complying  with  the  CBS  are  called  \u201cclimate  bonds\u201d.  The  key  differences \nbetween  the  GBP  and  CBS  are  that  the  CBS  requires  external  reviews  (which  the  GBP  recommends  but  not \nrequires), and that climate bonds should be certified. Therefore, climate bonds are a subset of green bonds.  \n\n\f2 \n\nHowever, the issuance of green bonds has been concentrated in developed markets so \n5. \nfar, with the exception of the People\u2019s Republic of China and India. Issuance of green bonds by \nprivate sector issuers in most of the developing markets in Asia remains limited, mainly because \nthe  issuers  are  unfamiliar with  the  certification  process  and  investors  lack  the  experience.  For \ninstance, green bond issuance in the economies covered by the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) accounted for only 5% of green bond issuance in all of Asia in the first half of \n2018. Further, many self-declared \u201cgreen bonds\u201d issued in Asia to date are often considered not \nin line with international best practice by the experts. This calls for the (i) establishment of local \nprivate  sector  green  bond  markets  in  the  region  and  (ii)  issuance  of  demonstrational  genuine \ngreen bonds by a credible issuer with an international certification and/or a confirmation from an \nexperienced institution in this field.  \n\n \nADB  is  well  positioned  to  play  this  role  through  \u201cOne  ADB\u201d  approach.  First,  from  the \n6. \nregulatory side, ADB\u2019s extensive engagement in capital market development in the region enables \nit  to  showcase  innovative  products  and  bring  in  international  best  practice.  Indeed,  ADB\u2019s \nSoutheast  Asia  Department  provided  technical  assistance  to  help  the  ASEAN  Capital  Markets \nForum  establish  the  ASEAN  Green  Bond  Standards,  a  regional  standard  based  on  the  GBP.3 \nSecondly,  from  the  private  sector  side,  ADB  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  can  help \nensure the eligibility of the bonds as green bonds and/or climate bonds in accordance with the \nrelevant principles and standards, by leveraging the experience and skills from closing the Tiwi \nand MakBan Geothermal Power Green Bonds Project in the Philippines.4 \n \n7. \nAgainst this backdrop of huge untapped markets and opportunities for ADB, green bond \nissuance  in  ASEAN  economies  is  expected  to  accelerate.  Thailand,  in  particular,  has  great \npotential for an active green bond market because it has a huge renewable energy potential, and \nits bond market is the largest among ASEAN bond markets. While Thailand\u2019s energy production \nstill  depends  heavily  on  fossil  fuels  and  although  renewable  energy  sources  are  currently \ncontributing only 9%, this is projected to increase to 15%\u201320% by 2036 under Thailand\u2019s Power \nDevelopment  Plan,  2015\u20132036.5 This  translates  into  additional  renewable  capacity  of  3,500  to \n6,000 MW. The Thai bond market's annual issuance of long-term corporate bonds totaled B823 \nbillion in 2017. However, renewable energy projects to date have been mainly financed by banks. \nNotwithstanding its growing needs and huge potential, the country\u2019s first green bond complying \nwith GBP was only issued in June 2018, by a local bank. \n  \n8. \nB.Grimm  is  a  leading  energy  company  in  Thailand  with  a  growing  presence  in  other \nASEAN countries such as the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Viet Nam, and has a proven \nrelationship with ADB through an equity investment and loan administration,6 and a loan facility.7 \nB.Grimm is transforming itself from a Thai-based local gas-fired independent power producer into \na renewable-energy-focused developer with a regional presence. Following its successful initial \npublic offering (IPO) and completion of the first solar power plants, it aims to champion itself as \nthe market leader in renewable energy and green bond issuance in Thailand and the region. In \nthe past, the company typically sought bank financing for its power plants at the project level. Now \n                                                 \n3  The  proposed  green  bonds  will  also  comply  with  the  ASEAN  Green  Bond  Standards.  ADB.  2015.

Manila. \n\n\f3 \n\nthat  the  successful  IPO  and  the  investment  grade  local  rating  have  significantly  improved  its \naccess  to  the  capital  markets,  it  also  seeks  opportunities  to  issue  corporate  bonds.  ADB  has \nidentified  B.Grimm  as  the  ideal  partner  based  on  the  positive  experience  from  the  existing \nprojects, and also on the relationship ADB has built with the company and other key players in \nThailand\u2019s energy sector. \n \n9. \nProject design. The project involves the issuance of corporate bonds for the construction \nand refinancing of 16 utility-scale solar power plants in Thailand. The total installed capacity of \nthe 16 plants is 98.5 MW, of which 9 plants totaling 67.7 MW (Yanhee and Sakeo subprojects) \nare completed and operational, while 7 plants totaling 30.8 MW (War Veterans Organization and \nAgricultural Cooperatives subprojects) are under construction. The plant size ranges from 2.3 MW \nto 8 MW, and the plants have power purchase agreements with the Provincial Electricity Authority \n(PEA)  and  the  Metropolitan  Electricity  Authority  (MEA)  under  Thailand\u2019s  Very  Small  Power \nProducer (VSPP) program. B.Grimm will issue corporate bonds to which ADB will subscribe. The \nrepayment of the bonds will be made from B.Grimm\u2019s overall cash flows. \n \nADB  will  facilitate  that  the  bonds  will  comply  with  the  International  Capital  Markets \n10. \nAssociation GBP, and will also assist B.Grimm in obtaining certification of the bonds as climate \nbonds meeting the CBS by CBI. ADB will monitor whether B.Grimm upholds its commitment to \ncontinued compliance with the GBP  and CBS.8 The key criteria for the bonds to be eligible as \ngreen  and  climate  bonds  are:  (i)  project  selection  and  nomination,  (ii) B.Grimm\u2019s  internal \nprocesses  and  controls  of  funds  raised  by  the  bonds,  (iii) B.Grimm\u2019s  internal  reporting  and \ncontrols  associated  with  internal  proceeds  management  and  information,  (iv) eligibility  of  the \nnominated projects and assets, and (v) reporting to ADB. \n \n11. \nThese  will  be  the  first  GBP-compliant  green  bonds  in  Thailand  issued  by  an  energy \ncompany. They will also be the country's first climate bonds meeting the CBS once certified by \nCBI.  Notwithstanding  the  growing  interest  among  the  issuers  and  investors,  and  a  rapidly \nincreasing issuance amount globally, the  green bond segment in  Thailand is still in its infancy \nbecause  local  market  players  lack  the  requisite  experience.  The  project  will  contribute  to  the \ndevelopment of the  green bond market in  Thailand by showcasing  genuine green and climate \nbonds  (i.e.,  in  conformance  with  international  best  practice  and  certified)  to  local  issuers  and \ninvestors,  and  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  plans  to  roll  out  a  program  to \nencourage other competent and trustworthy market players in different areas\u2014such as energy, \nwater, transport, and other infrastructure\u2014to issue green bonds. \n \nThe project complements ADB\u2019s existing equity investment in B.Grimm, which played an \n12. \nimportant role in attracting third-party investors and establishing confidence in the equity market. \nThe project extends its assistance to the debt capital markets to showcase the company as the \nleading green bond issuer. B.Grimm has adopted and is implementing ADB\u2019s environmental and \nsocial  safeguard  standards  through  ADB\u2019s  equity  investment,  which  also  helps  boost  the \ncredibility of the company\u2019s commitment to the GBP and CBS, and creates competitive financing \noptions for B.Grimm to expand its renewable energy portfolio. \n \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB  has  engaged  a  consultant  to  independently  audit  the  project\u2019s  compliance  with  the  GBP  and  the  CBS.  The \nconsultant will issue an assurance report to ADB, which represents conformity with the GBP, and will also be sufficient \nfor climate bond certification by the CBI.  ADB  will confirm the  green bond status based on the assurance report, \nwhile the CBI  will  issue a third-party certification. Consultant fees are funded by  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable Development \nand  Climate  Change  Department  under  ADB.  2014.

They have extensive \nmanagerial and technical knowledge in the industry, overseeing the successful \ndevelopment and operation of 33 power plants. \nBond issuance: fourth quarter of 2018 \n\nRevenue structure \n\nOperation and \nmaintenance \n\nGreen and climate \nbond eligibility \n\nB.Grimm sells electricity to PEA and MEA under the Very Small Power Producer \nprogram with long-term power purchase agreements, giving B.Grimm a stable, reliable \nrevenue structure. \nOperation and maintenance requirements for solar plants are straightforward, \ncomprising electrical works, regular cleaning of solar modules, regular inspections, \nminor repairs, measurements, data measurement and verification, reporting, and site \nsecurity. B.Grimm has an in-house maintenance team to undertake routine \nmaintenance. \nADB will invest in B.Grimm\u2019s bonds subject to their compliance with the GBP of the \nInternational Capital Markets Association. An independent consultant engaged by \nADB will issue an assurance report, which represents conformity with the GBP, and \nwill also be sufficient for climate bond certification by the Climate Bond Initiative. The \nbonds will be the first green bonds issued by an energy company in Thailand in \ncompliance with the GBP. Once certified by the Climate Bond Initiative, they will also \nbe the first climate bonds in Thailand to meet the Climate Bond Standards. \nB.Grimm will submit quarterly unaudited financial statements and annual audited \nfinancial statements to ADB on a consolidated basis. The company will also provide \nannual reporting on its solar projects funded by the green bonds to evidence continued \ncompliance with the GBP and the Climate Bond Standards. \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  GBP  =  Green  Bond  Principles,  MEA  =  Metropolitan  Electricity  Authority,  MW  = \nmegawatt, PEA = Provincial Electricity Authority. \nSource: B.Grimm Power Public Company Limited. \n \nF. \n \n25. \n \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED].  \n\nPerformance monitoring \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\n \n\n                                                 \n17 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f7 \n\nThe Assistance \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nA. \n \n26. \nADB will provide debt financing to B.Grimm in the form of corporate bonds of up to B5,000 \nmillion  (or  its  equivalent  in  United  States  dollars).  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  be  deployed  for  the \nrefinancing  of  B.Grimm\u2019s  existing  solar  plants,  and  construction  of  its  new  solar  plants  in \nThailand.18 The bonds comprise a 5-year bond of up to B1,500 million and a 7-year bond of up to \nB3,500 million, both with a bullet repayment. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]. \n \nB. \n \n27. \nCatalytic impact. ADB\u2019s participation in B.Grimm\u2019s bond program includes assistance to \nensure  both  that  the  bonds  will  comply  with  the  GBP  and  obtain  climate  bond  certification. \nAssociation with ADB will also help make the GBP and climate bonds better known in the region. \nSuch  instruments  and  standards  are  not  yet  well-recognized  in  the  Thai  and  ASEAN  capital \nmarkets, and local or regional bond investors and issuers do not yet have the requisite expertise \nor experience to establish green bond status or third-party certification. The successful issuance \nof these bonds with ADB\u2019s confirmation as green bonds and climate bond certification by CBI will \nfoster confidence among issuers as they see the benefits associated with green bonds (franchise \nvalue  enhancement,  industry  leadership,  reputation  enhancement,  integration  of  sustainable \nprinciples and greenhouse gas emissions reduction into the strategy) and help promote further \ninvestments in renewable energy and other climate-friendly businesses. Overall, this will channel \nmore funding into, or enable easier access to funding for, renewable energy and other climate-\nfriendly  projects.  Further,  B.Grimm\u2019s  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS), \nwhich exceeds national standards, will become widely known and put other players in the market \nunder more pressure to catch up in this respect. \n \n28. \nGreen bond program. With the proposed project, ADB will potentially kickstart a program \nfor green bond issuance by the private sector, which will mobilize additional commercial investors \nand issuers into this emerging asset class. By leveraging its regional presence, ADB will replicate \ngreen  bond  issuance  in  accordance  with  international  best  practice  in  Thailand  and  in  other \nASEAN economies, with possible effects on other bond markets in Asia. \n \nC. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED].  \n \n\nRisks \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \nADB categorized the investment  in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n29. \n(2009)  as  follows:  environment  (category  B),  involuntary  resettlement  (category  C),  and \nindigenous  peoples  (category  C).19 Its  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  Safeguard  Requirements  4 \nfor general corporate finance project applies. \n \n30. \nADB undertook due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social impacts \nof the project  and  the measures to  avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \n\n                                                 \n18  The entire ADB financing amount including the refinancing portion will be counted as climate finance. With regard to \n\ncarbon dioxide emission reduction, only the portion from the subprojects under construction will be counted.  \n\n19 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n\n\f8 \n\nimpacts  in  the  safeguard  reports  and  plans.  The  environmental  and  social  measures  and  the \ninstitutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  B.Grimm  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate. The operational subprojects are assets  to which \nthe  proceeds  of  ADB\u2019s  previously  approved  equity  investment  were  applied  in  2017.  The \ncorporate ESMS audit that was undertaken while processing the earlier investment applies to this \nproject (footnote 6). An audit of selective assets was also undertaken at the time which covered \nthe operational subprojects. Corrective actions to address the findings of that corporate audit and \nensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  were  fully  carried  out  and \nincorporated in B.Grimm\u2019s ESMS prior to ADB\u2019s equity subscription in 2017.  It was agreed that \nthe ESMS be implemented for all subprojects that utilize ADB\u2019s debt and equity financing, and \nwill be applied on a best-effort basis for non-ADB funded subprojects. \n \nEnvironment. An existing facilities audit was undertaken by an external party to assess \n31. \nthe  subprojects\u2019  compliance  with  B.Grimm\u2019s  ESMS  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nSafeguard Requirements 1\u20133. The audit reviewed all the subprojects with a focus on the seven \nsubprojects under construction that are nearly completed, with scheduled commercial operation \ndates in December 2018.  B.Grimm has advised that flooding studies were completed for each \nsite and that the results were factored into the technical design. A review of the local environment \nreports found some gaps in biodiversity assessment and climate risk assessment conducted for \nthe subprojects. Three of the subprojects are in the lower portion of the Central Basin Important \nBird  Area,  which  is  a  wintering  area  for  the  Manchurian  Reed-warbler  (VU). 20  The  three \nsubprojects were developed on former agricultural lands and are not in legally protected areas. \nThe  photovoltaic  panels  have  anti-glare  surfaces  with  row  separation  minimizing  risks  to \nbirds. The  subprojects  are  located  no  more  than  approximately  fifty  meters  from  existing \ntransmission lines. Although  the project sites  are not likely to  have  a significant impact on  the \nspecies since they have an average size of 7.8 hectares\u2014compared with a total important bird \narea of 190,000 hectares\u2014additional studies and actions will be required. The audit also found \nopportunities for improving occupational health and safety, enforcement of the local labor code, \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  record  keeping,  and  environmental  monitoring  record  keeping. \nB.Grimm has committed to implement a corrective  action plan to  fill the gaps identified by the \naudit, including (i) biodiversity assessment for the three sites, (ii) measures to maintain or restore \nthe  Manchurian  Reed-warbler  habitat  within  the  green  areas  of  those  sites,  (iii)  occupational \nhealth and safety improvements, and record-keeping improvements applicable for all subprojects. \n \n32. \nSocial safeguards. Land for subprojects in operation or under construction for which ADB \nproceeds will be used were purchased through negotiated settlements with individual landowners \non mutually agreed terms. No outstanding legacy issues pertaining to land for the  subprojects \nwere found. The subprojects are in areas where typically no distinct or vulnerable ethnic minority \ngroups reside who could be adversely or beneficially affected. Therefore, involuntary resettlement \nand/or indigenous people issues are not envisaged for the project. \n \nOther  social  dimensions.  The  project  is  classified  as  having  no  gender  elements. 21 \n33. \nB.Grimm will (i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list and (ii) ensure that investments \n\n                                                 \n20 VU (vulnerable) refers to the IUCN Red list status of the Manchurian reed-warbler in 2017, as assessed by Bird Life \n\nInternational in 2016. \n\n21 During  due  diligence,  gender  assessment  of  B.Grimm\u2019s  human  resource  and  corporate  social  responsibility \napproaches  was conducted. Given that (i) ADB\u2019s financing  will be channeled to completed and close-to-complete \nsolar subprojects which have low staffing requirements; and (ii) at the corporate level, 44% of B.Grimm\u2019s Board of \nDirectors  are  female,  its  company  president  is  female,  and  47%  of  its  headquarter  staff  are  female,  no  gender \nelements for this transaction is pursued. However, B.Grimm has agreed to continue to explore and implement other \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nusing ADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by national laws and \nregulations. The ESMS sets out requirements, as applicable, for compliance with national labor \nlaws and measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor standards, pursuant \nto  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  (2001). 22  The  ESMS  will  also  contain  requirements,  as \napplicable,  for  information  disclosure  and  consultation  with  affected  people  in  line  with  ADB \nstandards. B.Grimm will report regularly to  ADB  on (i) its and its investments\u2019 compliance with \nsuch laws and (ii) the measures taken.23 \n \nB. \n \n34. \nB.Grimm was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n \n35. \nsingle exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n \nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),24 \n36. \nADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the  Government  of \nThailand has no objection to the proposed assistance to B.Grimm Power Public Company Limited. \nADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, \nfollowing approval of the proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \n\nThe proposed debt investment is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nAssurances \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n37. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  debt  investment  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nproposed debt investment in bonds of up to B5,000,000,000 (or its equivalent in United States \ndollars) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to be issued by B.Grimm Power Public Company \nLimited for the Thailand Green Bond Project in Thailand, with such terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n8 November 2018 \n\n                                                 \n\ngender measures such as better working conditions and  workplace environment for female staff; gender targeted \nopportunities for staff training and community development activities, as part of  ADB\u2019s ongoing  engagement as a \nshareholder. \n\n22 ADB. 2003.
