THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach, (ii) a proposed policy-based loan (PBL) for subprogram 1, and (iii) a \nproposed project loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Second Decentralized Public Service \nand Financial Management Sector Development Program. \n \n2.  The proposed sector development program (SDP) combines a PBL with an investment \ncomponent to support key reforms in public financial management (PFM) and decentralization. \nThe PBL adopts a programmatic approach to strengthen subnational fiscal planning, PFM, and \npublic administration. This enables the sequencing of reforms and phased support from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to improve service delivery and bridge the urban\u2013rural divide. The \nprogrammatic approach builds on ADB\u2019s ongoing first Decentralized Public Service and Financial \nManagement Sector Development Program.1 The project component will operationalize the \nNational School of Local Administration (NASLA) to provide sustainable capacity development for \nstaff of subnational administrations (SNAs).2   \n \nII.  THE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Economic performance. Cambodia has enjoyed strong economic growth between 1995 \nand 2018; its gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 7.7%. Growth has \nbeen underpinned with effective macroeconomic management, prudent fiscal policy, strong \nperformance in domestic revenue mobilization, and low risk of sovereign debt distress.3 Prior to \nthe coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the poverty incidence declined from 47.8% in 2007 to 13.5% \nin 2014. These gains are under threat as the economy is now projected to contract by 5.5% in \n2020 due to COVID-19, pushing an additional 1.3 million into either moderate or extreme poverty. \nThe government\u2019s fiscal balance will worsen from -5.9% of GDP to -12.8%. Government revenues \nare expected to decline by 30.9% in 2020 as key sectors of the economy grind to a halt.4  \n \n4.  Development problem. Service delivery indicators have improved with progress made in \nproviding roads, water supply, and sanitation; but access to basic services varies greatly. In 2017, \nonly 77% of urban residents and 11% of rural residents had piped water supply. More than 75% \nof urban residents did not have regular solid waste management services. Urbanization has \nheightened the demand for services, which are limited by ineffective institutional coordination. \nProvincial differences also highlight gender disparities\u2014the proportion of women who have never \nattended formal education is higher in rural areas (17.5%) than in urban areas (10.8%).5 \n \n5.  Impact of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant decline in key \nsectors of Cambodia\u2019s economy and losses in livelihoods, with the unemployment rate increasing \nfrom 0.7% to 4.4% (footnote 4). Prior to the onset of COVID-19, more than 70% of Cambodians \nalready lived on less than $3 a day, vulnerable to economic and external shocks. Poor and \nvulnerable households are especially at risk from the impact of COVID-19. The government will \n \n1  ADB.

The middle \ntier of districts, municipalities, and khans (D/M/K) comprises 162 rural districts, 27 urban municipalities, and  \n14 khans. The lowest tier of local government comprises 1,410 rural communes and 236 urban sangkats. \n3  International Monetary Fund. 2019. Cambodia: 2019 Article IV Consultation. Washington, DC. \n4  ADB.

SNA staff will also need to meet additional service \ndelivery  needs  to  support  implementation  of  government  response  on  COVID-19,  such  as \nincreased social assistance. As demands on SNA staff increase, strengthening SNAs to operate \nin an uncertain environment will be increasingly important.6  \n \n6.  Weak  subnational  planning.  The  government  embarked  on  decentralization  and \ndeconcentration (D&D) reforms in 2001, establishing a comprehensive subnational legislative \nframework  which  defined  SNAs  as  the  legal  entities  responsible  for  service  delivery, \nresponsiveness, and accountability.7 Progress made on service delivery outcomes across SNA \ntiers has been mixed with functions and the assignment of key responsibilities unclear. Provinces \nwhich are larger, better funded and have more capacity are able to deliver services more \neffectively than districts which are underdeveloped, underfunded and have greater capacity \nneeds. The lack of complaints and dispute resolution mechanisms to hold service providers \naccountable for services provided to citizens also limits overall coverage and quality of services.   \n \n7.  Ineffective revenue and expenditure management. Revenue mobilization increased \nfrom 15.2% of GDP in 2014 to 25.9% in 2019 with improvements in tax administration and \nefficiency,8 but remains centralized.9 Availability of resources to meet mandates for service \ndelivery remains low. Between 2012 and 2018, district\u2013municipality\u2013khan (DMK) funding as a \nshare of the total SNA spending increased from 6.4% to 9.2%.10 The share of commune\u2013sangkat \nfunding marginally declined from 27.9% to 25.8%, reflecting priority to the DMK tiers for service \ndelivery. Fiscal transfers from the national budget to the capital and provinces accounted for \n64.9% of total SNA spending. Strengthening domestic revenue mobilization at the subnational \nlevel will be key to service provision and meeting the Sustainable Development Goals.11 \n \n8.  Weak  public  administration  and  poorly  skilled  subnational  officials.  Skills \ndevelopment of SNA staff is hampered by the absence of a common institutional framework that \naligns with their duties of service delivery. SNA staff lack regulatory knowledge and technical \nskills.12 Women hold only 18% of permanent positions in the civil service. Existing institutions \nsuch as the Royal School of Administration serve a narrow cohort of civil servants and are \noperating at full capacity.13 The investment component underpins the overall reform program by \naddressing this skills shortage that constrains effective service delivery at the subnational level.   \n \nB.

ADB\u2019s experience. ADB has provided comprehensive support to D&D reforms since \n2002, including on the subnational legislative framework and operationalizing fiscal transfer \nmechanisms. Between 2002 and 2012, ADB\u2019s engagement focused on strengthening commune \ncouncils18 and increasing engagement of line ministries in D&D reforms for improved resource \nprioritization for the rural population.19 These engagements were rated as relevant and effective \nin supporting stronger local governance.20 From 2012, under the first DPSFM (footnote 1) an \nefficient system of intergovernmental fiscal relations for improved service delivery was established \nby: (i) reinforcing the regulatory framework; (ii) strengthening institutions; and (iii) defining service \ndelivery responsibilities. The  proposed  SDP  is  consistent  with  the  overarching  public  sector \nmanagement reforms,21 and is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table 1)22 and pillar 2 and pillar \n4 of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2019\u20132023.23 The programmatic approach for the PBL \nallows  for  sequenced  and  coordinated  interventions  aligned  with  the  national  PFM  reform \nagenda.24 The SDP modality allows for mutual reinforcement.

Lessons learned. Important lessons have emerged from ADB\u2019s engagement in D&D \nreforms in Cambodia. First, the political, fiscal, and administrative complexities in D&D reforms \nrequire flexibility in meeting emerging needs and realistic timeframes for implementation. Building \nconsensus amongst diverse stakeholders requires significant efforts to maintain momentum for \nreforms.  Second,  while  integration  of  policy-based  and  project  interventions  can  leverage \ncommitment for long term policy reforms, more support on implementation is needed.25 The \nproposed SDP reinforces the D&D policy and regulatory framework, while recognizing the need \nfor long term support to SNAs for successful implementation of D&D policies.   \n \n12.  ADB value addition. ADB\u2019s long-term and comprehensive engagement in Cambodia has \nsupported  legal,  policy,  and  institutional  reforms  key  to  furthering  D&D  reforms.  ADB  has \npreviously provided TA to support functional mapping of SNA responsibilities and the legal \nframework for intergovernmental fiscal relations.26 ADB also provided TA to pilot decentralization \nof key services such as rural water supply to districts.27 ADB TA resources have supported needs \nanalysis for SNA staff and advisory support for the governance structure of NASLA and delivered \nfive pilot courses, including a leadership course for women.28 The project under DPSFM II will \nensure sustainable capacity building and innovations that add value by: (i) ensuring teaching \nquality through peer-to-peer links; (ii) optimizing information technology solutions to improve \nteacher training and student learning; and (iii) tailoring the NASLA curriculum to SNA staff needs. \n \nC.  Sector Development Program Description \n \n13.  The overall program is aligned with the following impact: SNAs deliver public services \nsustainably, effectively, and efficiently to all Cambodians. The overall program will have the \nfollowing outcome: service delivery by SNAs strengthened.29 The first subprogram will develop \nthe legislative framework for stronger SNA governance underpinned by an investment component \nfor the skills development of SNA staff. The second subprogram will support implementation of \nbetter service delivery, rendered more important due to the constraints on revenue mobilization \nand expenditures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The project loan will help meet the core \ncapacity building needs associated with the overall program.  \n \n14.  Reform area 1: Vertical and horizontal coordination for responsive and accountable \nservice delivery strengthened. The government improved the links between national and \nsubnational policy objectives of strengthened service delivery. First, it approved the Subnational \nBudget Reform Strategy 2019\u20132025 to outline the next generation of budget reforms. This \nincluded the expansion of program budgeting and inclusion of SNAs to ensure that local priorities \nare integrated with national objectives. Second, to improve efficiency and coordination, the \ngovernment approved a sub-decree that integrated district-level line ministry offices with district \nadministrations. District administrations will have an expanded mandate for service delivery with \nadditional  responsibilities  in  education,  rural  development,  and  social  affairs.  Third,  the \ngovernment established internal control functions for improved risk management within the new \nunified district administrations. Fourth, the government approved a sub-decree to establish one-\nwindow services for citizens for faster processing of business licenses and permits. Ombudsman \n \n25 ADB.

Under subprogram 2, implementation of the Subnational Budget Reform Strategy will \ninclude strategic budget plans, program budgeting guidelines, audit and ombudsman functions. \n \n15.  Reform  area  2:  Revenue  and  expenditure  management  to  meet  local  needs \nimproved. The government boosted the resources available to SNAs to fulfill their service \ndelivery duties. First, to meet the increasing development needs of communes and sangkats, the \ngovernment approved the transfer of additional resources from the national budget.30 As a result, \nthe overall resource envelope for commune and sangkats has increased with the development \nfund  component  more than  doubled  in  2020  to  address  infrastructure  priorities  and  social \nservices, including the expansion of services for women and marginalized groups. Second, to \nimprove the management of subnational assets, the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) \nsubmitted a law on the management and use of state property to the cabinet for approval. The \nproposed law will ensure the transparent management of subnational assets\u2014(i) management of \nstate property; (ii) permissible arrangements for rent, sale, and concession of state property; and \n(iii) responsibility for revenue and tax liabilities. Finally, the government approved a 15% share of \nnontax revenues (previously 0%) collected by line ministries and shared with SNAs, to boost their \nrevenue base and fund service delivery responsibilities. Under subprogram 2, financial guidelines \nwill be established to improve commune, or sangkat fund management and nontax revenue-\nsharing arrangements collected from state property strengthened. \n \n16.  Reform  area  3:  Public  administration  skills  and  competencies  of  subnational \nofficials enhanced. The government addressed longer-term capacity development needs. First, \nthe government approved a sub-decree and guidelines to give SNAs more autonomy in managing \nstaff.  Second, the Ministry of Interior (MOI) endorsed prakas and a strategic plan for long-term \ncapacity development including delivery of key training programs by type and target group, and \nmilestones for improving the development of human resources. Third, under the interim NASLA \ntraining strategy supported by ADB, five courses were successfully designed and piloted to \n2,087 SNA staff, of which 20% were women. A leadership course for women at the subnational \nlevel was piloted and jointly delivered with the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs. Finally, the National \nCommittee for Sub-National Democratic Development (NCDD) approved its gender equality \npolicy to strengthen the role and participation of women in service delivery. This included:  \n(i) greater representation of women in management; (ii) allocation of resources; and (iii) improved \nservices for women and children. Under subprogram 2, guidelines will be adopted to strengthen \nSNAs\u2019 performance management. NASLA will deliver a tailored curriculum and implement the \ngender equality policy at the subnational level. \n \n17.  Project Loan: The project will operationalize NASLA to develop the capacity of SNA staff \nof all ranks and grades for long-term sustainability of D&D reforms. It has three outputs: (i) design, \nconstruction, and installation of the physical infrastructure of NASLA; (ii) NASLA curriculum \ndevelopment to ensure high-quality teaching and training; and (iii) NASLA staff professionalized \nand core operations established. Output 1 includes the design and construction of the NASLA \ncomplex,  integrating  gender  and  climate-resilient  design  features.31  Output 2  includes:  \n(i) diagnostic of the SNA staff competency framework; (ii) pilot of NASLA courses aligned to \ncompetency standards as agreed with the MOI training department; and (iii) courses delivered \nunder the interim training strategy. Output 3 includes: (i) a training needs assessment for NASLA \nstaff; (ii) peer-to-peer networks to improve teaching relevance and quality; and (iii) an operations \n \n30 The additional resources allocated from the national budget to the communes and sangkats are based on a formula \nfor transfer that accounts for population, poverty profile, and the number of villages in a commune or sangkat. \n31 The Ministry of Interior does not currently have adequate facilities to deliver large scale training for SNA staff.  Existing \ngovernment schools are operating at full capacity.  \n ", "6 \nmanual covering human resource management, financial management, and procurement. \n \nD.

The program is estimated to cost $31.05 million (Table 2). \nADB will provide a PBL of $20 million and a project loan of $9.35 million. The government will \nprovide counterpart funding of $1.70 million. Climate mitigation is estimated to cost $0.29 million. \nClimate adaptation is estimated to cost $0.41 million, which includes $0.24 million to climate proof \nNASLA facilities and $0.17 million to support policy reform area 3.2, which mainstreams climate \nconcerns into the NASLA curriculum. \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary capital resources (concessional policy-based  20.00  64.41 \nloan) \nOrdinary capital resources (concessional project loan)a  9.35  30.11 \nGovernment of Cambodiab  1.70  5.48 \nTotal  31.05  100.00 \na  Inclusive of taxes and duties.

Policy-based financing plan. The government has requested a concessional loan of \n$20 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the first subprogram. The loan \nwill have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1% per year during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter. The PBL will be released upon loan effectiveness. \nThe size of the PBL is based on strength of the policy reforms and financing needs. In 2020, the \nfiscal deficit is estimated at -12.8% and total financing needs have increased to $3.54 billion as \nrevenues decline due to COVID-19 impact.  It is estimated that $1.31 billion will be financed \ndomestically, and $2.24 billion from foreign financing (with $760 million in budget support).  \n \n20.  Project investment plan. The government requested a concessional loan of $9.35 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project, including taxes and duties. The \nloan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1% per year \nduring the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft project loan agreement. ADB will finance expenditures related to civil works, goods, and \ncapacity  development.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  funding  equivalent  to  \n$1.70 million including funding for: (i) guest lecturers; (ii) interim training; and (iii) operations and \nmaintenance costs.32 The summary of cost estimates is in Table 3.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The NCDD-Secretariat (NCDD-S) is the executing agency for the PBL component. The \nNCDD-S, MOI, and MEF are the implementing agencies. For the project component, NASLA is \nthe executing and implementing agency. A project steering committee will provide strategic \nguidance to NASLA and aid inter-ministerial coordination. The project management unit (PMU) \nwill be responsible for overall coordination, financial management, and procurement. \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \n  Policy-Based Loan  Project Loan \nImplementation period  January 2017\u2013August 2020  January 2021\u2013December 2025 \nEstimated completion date    31 December 2025 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2021  30 June 2026 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Steering committee chaired by the permanent secretary of state, MOI. \nMembers include: secretary of state, MOI; representatives from Ministry \nof Economy and Finance, Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, Ministry \nof Civil Service, Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs, and NCDD; director general \nof administration, MOI; director general of General Department Logistics \n& Finance, MOI; secretary general of General Secretariat of Association \nof Subnational Administration Councils; and rector of NASLA. \n(ii)  Executing agency  Policy-based loan: NCDD-Secretariat; project: NASLA  \n(iii) PMU  The project management consultants will work with the NASLA PMU \nproject manager and report to the project steering committee responsible \nfor overall strategic decisions for the project. \n(iv) Technical  Technical working groups under the PMU will review the proposed NASLA \nimplementing units  curriculum and activities.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  The economic analysis shows that the improved capacity of SNA staff will result in a \nsustained 1.5% productivity gain across all SNA tiers once NASLA is fully operational. The \nestimated economic benefits across the consolidated SNA funds are estimated at $0.30 million in \n2023 and projected to increase to $2.39 million in 2027, remaining at this level until 2045. The \ntotal accumulated economic benefits are estimated at $65 million for the period 2023\u20132045. The \ncalculated economic internal rate of return for the investment is 13.3%, indicating economic \nviability.  The  fiscal  impact  analysis  confirms  that  the  government  has  adequate  financial \nresources to fulfill its financial obligations for the longer-term sustainability of NASLA.34 \n \nB.  Governance \n \n23.  The  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines  and  identified  financial  management  risks  in  staffing,  internal  audit  and  control, \ninformation systems, and financial reporting. The project financial management risk was assessed \nas substantial due to the limited experience of NASLA in working with development-partner-\nfunded projects. A PMU will be set up to mitigate financial management and procurement risks. \nValue for money was achieved through contract packaging, and the selection of the procurement \nand bidding method as part of the strategic procurement planning exercise. The MOI will recruit \nqualified financial management and procurement specialists into the PMU with seconded MOI \nDepartment of Training staff. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government, the NCDD, MOI, MEF, and NASLA. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 33). \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n24.  Despite progress in reducing poverty, 90% of the poor live in rural areas and their access \nto basic services varies greatly.35 A high maternal mortality ratio\u2014161 maternal deaths per \n100,000 live births\u2014indicates that the quality and coverage of basic health care is insufficient. \nOnly 63% of the population has access to lower secondary education. The proposed SDP targets \nimprovements in service delivery to local populations. It is categorized as effective gender \nmainstreaming. The gender action plan includes: (i) the integration of gender and disability \nconsiderations into the design and construction of NASLA; (ii) a curriculum that is inclusive and \nfree of gender bias; (iii) a target of 30% of female staff to receive management training; and  \n(iv) gender-sensitive training for Ombudsman offices.36  \n \n \n34 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nD.  Safeguards \n \n25.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the safeguard categories \nare as follows. \n \n26.  Environment (category B). Environmental impacts from the construction of NASLA\u2019s \ninfrastructure (training center and dormitory) are considered site-specific, minor, and reversible. \nThe localized impact from construction activities and traffic can be mitigated through effective site \npractice and management. The project site does not experience flooding. NASLA infrastructure \ndesign incorporates green building and climate resilience principles.37 An initial environmental \nexamination  and  environmental  management  plan  were  completed.  Consultations  with \nstakeholders took place during project preparation and will continue during the detailed design \nand implementation.38 The policy actions are not anticipated to have any environmental impacts. \n \n27.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous people (category C). ADB\u2019s due diligence \nconfirms the absence of any land acquisition and resettlement impact. All civil works are within \nthe boundaries of the NASLA complex on fenced-in, state-owned land in the Kouk Roka sangkat \nin Prek Pnoy District of Phnom Penh Municipality. The draft due diligence report was disclosed \non ADB\u2019s website. The PMU will establish a project-specific grievance redress mechanism to \nrecord and resolve communities\u2019 concerns. The policy actions will not have any impact on \ninvoluntary resettlement. Due diligence based on the preliminary design suggests that the project \nwill not impact any indigenous peoples as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nE.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n28.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.39 \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nUncertainty  over  the  government's  The D&D reforms have strong support underpinned by the \nsustained  political,  financial,  and  established legislative framework.
