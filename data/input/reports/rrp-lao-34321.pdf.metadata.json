A summary environmental impact assessment was \nAssessment  prepared and circulated to the Board on 21 August 2002.  \n   \nProject Description  The  Greater  Mekong  Subregion:  Northern  Economic  Corridor \nProject (the Project) aims to improve the road from Houayxay to \nBoten in the Lao PDR so as to create an international north-south \ncorridor  linking  Thailand  and  the  People's  Republic  of  China \n(PRC). The governments of Thailand and the PRC have provided \nconcessional loans to the Lao PDR to finance the Project. The \nimproved road will follow a combination of class II and class III \nstandards, with 7-meter wide paved road and pavements ranging \nbetween  1.5  meters  and  2.5  meters  in  width.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will finance one third of the cost of the \nProject,  covering  construction  of  74 kilometers  in  the  middle \nsection.  \nThe Project also includes a resettlement plan, a social action plan, \nand  an  environment  management  plan  so  as  to  meet  ADB's \nsafeguard policies for the entire project road.  \n   \nRationale  The Project is a high-priority project and will help accelerate trade \nand transport in the Greater Mekong Subregion. The Project will \nalso link two remote provinces of the Lao PDR to fast growing \neconomies.  Louang  Namtha  province  is  the  most  transport \ndeficient province in the Lao PDR whereas Viangphoukha district \nof  Bokeo  province  is  among  the  poorest  in  the  country.  The \nProject  will  enhance  access  to  these  two  areas  that  remain \nisolated for extended periods of the year.  \n   \nObjectives and Scope  The  primary  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  accelerate  regional \ndevelopment  through  more  efficient  infrastructure  networks.  A \ndirect link between the PRC and Thailand via the Lao PDR will \nreduce transport costs in the regional project influence area, and \nwill  increase  the  efficiency  of  vehicle,  goods,  and  passenger \ntraffic. The road will link two remote provinces of the Lao PDR and \nhelp reduce poverty by providing access to markets, extension \nservices, income, and employment opportunities, thus enhancing \ndevelopment potential. \nThe project scope includes upgrading the existing 228-kilometer \nroad between Houayxay and Boten, area development including a \nsocial action plan for the ethnic minorities, and capacity building in \nenvironmental and social monitoring. \n ", "iv \n   \nCost Estimates  Total cost of the Project is estimated at $95.8(cid:176) million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB will finance a loan of $30 million from the Special Funds \nresources.  The  governments  of  Thailand  and  the  PRC  have \nprovided  loans  (currently  estimated  at  $30 million each) on a \nbilateral basis to cover the remaining cost of the Project. The \nGovernment of the Lao PDR will cover domestic costs amounting \nto $7.3 million. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  Special  Drawing  Rights  22,731,000  ($30  million \nequivalent) will be made from the Special Funds resources for a \nterm of 32 years with a grace period of 8 years. The loan will carry \nan  interest  rate  of  1.0%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5% \nthereafter. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  4 years \n   \nEstimated Project \n31 December 2006 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry  of  Communication,  Transport,  Post  and  Construction, \nDepartment of Roads  \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services financed under the ADB loan will be procured \nin accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works \nwill  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding. \nAdvance action for the procurement of civil works was approved \non 16 August 2002.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Services  of  international  consultants  for  190  person-months \nassisted by about 960 person-months of domestic consultants will \nbe provided to assist in (i) project coordination and construction \nsupervision,  (ii)  resettlement  planning,  implementation,  and \ncapacity  building,  (iii)  social  action  plan,  and  (iv)  environment \nmanagement plan. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  project  road  is  one  of  the  most  important  links  between \nBeneficiaries  Thailand  and  the  PRC  and  will  help  accelerate  trade  and \ninvestment in the region.  \nThe  Project  has  mobilized  concessional  resources  of  nearly \n$60 million from two of ADB\u2019s developing member countries to \nfund  an  infrastructure  project  in  another  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion country.  \nTwo remote provinces of the Lao PDR will be linked to Thailand \nand  the  PRC  and  this  will  create  income  and  employment \ngeneration opportunities. Local Lao PDR communities will have \nbetter  access  to  markets  and  social  infrastructure  facilities \nthroughout the year and benefit from the social action plan that ", "v \nthroughout the year and benefit from the social action plan that \naims  to  enhance  community  infrastructure  availability  and \ndevelopment. \nThe revenue stream from the road charges for the regional traffic \nwill more than cover the debt service and road maintenance costs \nand will thus contribute to increased foreign exchange generation \nfor the Government of the Lao PDR. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project carries a commercial risk, in case regional traffic is \nactually  lower  than  present  projections.  The  current  traffic \nforecasts for international traffic are conservative and represent \nonly a very small fraction of the total potential traffic. The overall \ncommercial risk is reduced considerably due to financing from \nThailand and the PRC on very concessional terms.  \nA second major risk relates to environmental and social safeguard \npolicies during implementation period. Adequate loan covenants, \nsystem of performance bonds and third-party monitoring are built \ninto the project design and cost estimates. This issue will be an \nimportant aspect to monitor during project implementation.  ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion: \nNorthern Economic Corridor Project (the Project).  \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n2.  The Project includes improvement of the existing road in the Lao PDR linking two of its \nremote provinces with Yunnan Province in the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Chiang \nRai in Thailand, thus creating an international north-south corridor in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion (GMS).1 A project preparatory technical assistance helped the Government of the \nLao PDR update the feasibility study prepared earlier.2 \n3.  The project road is an unpaved seasonal road, known as national route 3 in the northern \nprovinces of the Lao PDR, namely, Louang Namtha and Bokeo connecting Houayxay on the \nMekong River and Boten on the border with the PRC. Given the good road network from Chiang \nKhong to Singapore and Kunming to Beijing, improving the Houayxay-Boten link would create a \nsafe,  viable,  continuous,  all-weather,  overland  route  between  Singapore  and  Beijing.  The \nGovernment of the Lao PDR has requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) for this Project. The governments of Thailand and the PRC are also assisting the Lao \nPDR in financing this Project through bilateral loans on very concessional terms. \n4.  The Project was formulated based on the findings of ADB missions, information provided \nby  the  Government  of  the  Lao  PDR,  beneficiary  consultations,  the  PRC  and  Thailand \ngovernments, and recommendations of the feasibility study. Appendix 1 presents the project \nframework.  \nIII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n5.  ADB has taken a lead role in promoting cooperation among the six states (five countries \nand one province) bordering the Mekong River through the GMS Program. The GMS Program, \ninitiated in 1992, aims to promote the development of the six members by strengthening \neconomic links among them. The ultimate objective of the GMS Program is to facilitate trade \nand sustainable development by enhancing subregional cooperation in seven identified areas, \nnamely: transport, energy, telecommunications, environment, human resources development, \ntrade and investment, and tourism. Appendix 2 lists major GMS projects supported by ADB. \n6.  The Government of the Lao PDR recognizes that regional cooperation can help narrow \nthe gap between the Lao PDR and other regional economies and to achieve this, the country \nneeds to strengthen its role as a land link at the center of the GMS. Regional trade is becoming \nmore important for the Lao PDR, with the increasing overall share of total exports and imports \nwith  neighboring  countries  such  as  Thailand.  In  the  last  few  years,  ADB  has  supported \nstrengthening the road network in the Lao PDR to enhance its linkages with its neighbors, e.g., \n                                                 \n1   ADB provided a regional technical assistance to examine the viability of a project linking Chiang Rai in Thailand to \nKunming, Yunnan Province, via the Lao PDR (ADB. 1997. Regional Technical Assistance for Chiang Rai-Kunming \nRoad Improvement via Lao PDR. Manila). \n2   ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to Lao PDR for Preparing the Northern Economic Corridor Project. Manila. \n ", "2 \nthe East-West Corridor Project, currently under implementation, linking central Lao PDR with \nnorthern Thailand and central Viet Nam.3 The Project was identified as a high priority regional \nroad in 1994 Hanoi Meeting of the Transport Ministers of the GMS Program. The Government of \nthe Lao PDR established a joint venture with a private investor to construct this road. However, \nfor various reasons, the private investor was unable to make much progress in constructing the \nroad.  After  considerable  time  and  effort,  a  settlement  has  been  reached  between  the \nGovernment and the private investor. The Government has officially advised ADB that the joint \nventure has been terminated and that it has full rights to construct and develop the road. \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n7.  ADB's operational strategy is directed at assisting the Government of the Lao PDR to \nmeet its ambitious goal of graduating from least developed country status by 2020. ADB's \nmedium-term goals are to assist in achieving sustainable reduction in poverty and improvement \nin human development indicators by 2005.  Poverty reduction through economic growth and \nimproved access to the poor is the basic theme of ADB's interventions in the transport sector of \nthe Lao PDR over the next 10 years. Five operational objectives of this strategy include \n(i) efficient transport network for rural development, (ii) greater transparency and accountability, \n(iii) viable private sector, (iv) efficient regional transport network, and (v) sustainable transport \nsector. Since transport in the Lao PDR is almost exclusively road based, roads will continue to \nbe the main focus of ADB's activities in the sector. Appendix 3 provides an overview of the \nsector performance and analysis.  \n8.  The proposed road will enhance overall accessibility of the two northwestern provinces \nwith central Lao PDR and neighboring economies. Despite considerable improvements in the \nnational road network, the Lao PDR continues to lag behind other Asian countries with very low \nroad density\u2014about 0.03 kilometers (km) per km2. The road connection between Vientiane and \nprovincial capitals is a major problem. Both provinces, namely Louang Namtha and Bokeo, have \nlimited infrastructure: existing road links are in deteriorated conditions and remain impassable \nduring the rainy season. Other physical and social infrastructure in these provinces also remains \nlimited.  \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Access  \n9.  The Project is conceived as a regional development initiative that will link two remote \nprovinces  of  the  Lao  PDR  to  two  growing  economies  of  the  region.  The  project  road  is \nimpassable for 4 months a year and as a consequence, the existing traffic is light. Upgrading \nthis road will create an important north-south link between Thailand, Lao PDR, and Yunnan \nProvince of the PRC. A better road will facilitate trade and investment within the region.  \n10.  High dependence on subsistence agriculture is a major reason for poverty in the project \narea. As per the participatory poverty assessment of December 2001,4 the problem most cited \nby villagers as preventing economic growth is lack of all-weather roads by which to market their \nproduce. Accessibility to markets in the wet season is essential since that is when most \n                                                 \n3   ADB. 1999.

Areas that have potential for developing cash \ncrops cannot take advantage of such income-enhancing opportunities due to lack of reliable \ntransportation. Table 1 shows the percentage of villages in Bokeo and Louang Namtha with \naccess to roads. Louang Namtha is among the most transport-deficient areas in the country. \nRestricted access and weather-dependent roads also have implications for cost-effectiveness of \ndevelopment programs, on the ability to target health care and educational services to the poor \nand the sustainability of such programs.  \nTable 1: Access to Roads (% of villages) \nProvinces  6+ km to Main Road  Access in Rainy Season  Access in Dry season \n Louang Namtha  42   31  41 \n Bokeo  38  41  77 \n Lao PDR  35  50  79 \n Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nSource: National Statistics Centre. \n11.  The socioeconomic status of villagers living along the Project varies considerably: from \nthe vulnerable highland minorities to the more prosperous lowland communities, particularly \nthose close to the towns of Namtha and Houayxay. The villagers located along the project road \nrange from impoverished peasants with a marginal existence to small farm entrepreneurs who \nare  able  to  respond  to  the  market  opportunities  associated  with  improved  transportation. \nNonfarm employment has increased in the villages nearer to Houayxay, and other towns in \nmining and construction work. Indeed, the average annual incomes of the people in the first five \nvillages along the road north of Houayxay and closer to the Thailand border varies almost \ndirectly with distance from the provincial capital (Table 2).  \nTable 2: Distance from Houayxay and Income of Villagers  \nItem/Village Name   Pa Oi  Ou Dom  Pak Hao  Mok Ka  Nam Ho \nNeua  Chok  Tai \nDistance from Houayxay (km)  5.7  6.0  6.5  7.8  9.0 \n1996 per capita income ($)  162  127  141  68  56 \n2001 per capita income ($)  190  172  121  84  80 \n  Source: ADB. 2002.

While the potential impact zone of the Project covers a wide area, the primary zone for \nthe purpose of project classification has been defined as covering Namtha and Viangphoukha \ndistricts in Louang Namtha province and Houayxay district in Bokeo province. The majority of \nthe population is rural, living in villages of between 100 and 1,000 people. The poverty profile of \nthe project area indicates that nearly 2% of the country\u2019s poor and about 17% of the northern \nregion\u2019s poor reside in these three districts. The overall incidence of poverty at the province \nlevel is 43.4%, which is significantly above the national incidence of 38.6% (Table 3).5 Under \nADB\u2019s loan classification system, the Project will fulfill the criteria for poverty intervention. \n                                                 \n5   The average poverty line (rural and urban) for the Lao PDR is estimated to be equal to KN19,184 per person per \nmonth (Lao Expenditure Consumption Survey II). \n ", "4 \nViangphoukha is classified as a poor district by ADB\u2019s participatory poverty analysis for the Lao \nPDR because more than 50% of the district population is below the national poverty line. \nTable 3: Poverty Profile in Project Area \nShare of \nTotal  Poverty  Region\u2019s Poor Poverty  Severity of \nProvince  District  Population  Poor  Incidence (%)  (%)  Gap  Poverty \nLouang Namtha    123,237 70,861 57.5  31.9  18.5  7.5 \n  Namtha  26,841 11,810 44.0  5.3     \n  Viangphoukha  13,200 11,920 90.3  5.4     \nBokeo    122,342 45,756 37.4    9.5  3.4 \n  Houayxay  48,802 14,836  30.4  6.7     \nTotal Project Area    88,843 38,565 43.4  17.4     \nLao PDR    5,087,542 1,964,809 38.6    10.3  4.0 \nLao PDR: Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nSources: Staff estimates and National Statistics Centre.  \n13.  Ethnic Minorities Profile. The Project has a high degree of ethnic diversity: at least 16 \nethnic groups, belonging to four ethno-linguistic families, have been identified along the project \nroad. In Louang Namtha, 98% of the population consists of ethnic minorities\u201433% of minorities \nare considered lowlanders, 29% uplanders, and 38% highlanders.6 These designations are \nrough categorizations by ethnic group residential preferences. In Bokeo, 87% of the population \nbelongs to ethnic minorities. Only one village is inhabited by the Lao Loum ethnic majority \ngroup, all the rest are ethnic minorities.  \n14.  Gender  Profile.  The  participatory  poverty  assessment  showed  that  ethnic  minority \nwomen and girls are the most disadvantaged segment in Lao PDR society. They perform 70% \nof the agriculture and household tasks, and have little access to labor-saving facilities such as \nrice mills. They also make up the majority of the lowest income quintile in Lao PDR society. \nInfant and child mortality rates are some of the highest in the world\u2014one out of four children die \nbefore age 1 and three out of 20 fail to live to reach age 5. They constitute the largest segment \nof the illiterate population, approximately 70%. Reverse literacy\u2014learning then losing literacy\u2014\nis common among women in minority villages, as it is difficult for them to retain a nonmother \ntongue language they may not see or hear for months. As a result, few ethnic minority women \nengage in formal or nonformal businesses  or are employed in manufacturing or government \nwork. Given such constraints, integrating ethnic minority women into mainstream development \nprograms is an enormous challenge.  \n15.  Vulnerability. The Lao PDR has experienced economic growth and reduction in overall \npoverty since the early 1990s, but poverty levels in the northern region have remained stagnant. \nThe poor in this region have been unable to capture the benefits of economic growth. More than \n80% of households in Louang Namtha derive their main source of livelihood from subsistence \nagriculture. One key reason for such dependence on subsistence agriculture is that Louang \nNamtha has the lowest market penetration rate in the country, with only 9% of villages having \naccess to markets. Diversification and cash income remain limited, leaving poor households \nvulnerable to external shocks, especially to natural disasters. Households often resort to high \n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2001. Participatory Poverty Assessment: Lao People's Democratic Republic. Manila. \n ", "5 \nrisk coping strategies in response to food shortages and rice deficiencies, including collection of \nnontimber forest products, sale of livestock, and opium cultivation. The World Food Program \nvulnerability index ranks Namtha and Viangphoukha among the most vulnerable districts in the \ncountry.7  \n16.  Health Service. Household access to social services in the project area is limited due to \nlimited funds, shortage of qualified staff, and inaccessibility of the villages. Only 31 villages \nalong the project road have some type of social infrastructure. Sixty villages have no access to \neven primary health clinic or service facilities. Malaria, gastroenteritis, and respiratory infections \nare common. Rural health services are scarce and rudimentary.8 Self-medication is the most \ncommon mode of treatment of illnesses, with opium often used for medical purposes. Less than \n30% of the population use health facilities when ill. Overall, health awareness remains low, \nespecially for women. For instance, according to the recent National Health Survey,9 80% of \nwomen have never heard of HIV/AIDS.10 \n17.  Education. Only 50 villages along the project road have a primary school. Dropout rates \nare especially high for girls. Female literacy rate in Louang Namtha is 19% compared to the \nmale literacy rate of 55%. Corresponding figures for Bokeo are 33% and 70%. This is well below \nthe national average. While parents are not convinced of the relevance of formal education to \ntheir daily livelihood needs, limited access and poor quality are exaggerated by the fact that few \npeople in the project area speak an official language. While language and cultural constraints \nare barriers for seeking social services on the part of villagers, the Government\u2019s limited access \nto villages severely constrains its ability to provide health and educational services.  \nC.  Lessons Learned \n18.  ADB's experience in the Lao PDR road sector indicates that projects have generally \nbeen implemented as planned, delivering the main output, namely improving the carriageway. \nOverall capacity within the Department of Roads has been developed to implement  projects \nwell. Projects that have been recently evaluated indicate that road networks have had important \nbeneficiary  impacts  on  the  socioeconomic  conditions.  Road  improvements  that  led  to  all-\nweather roads have resulted in beneficial impacts on agricultural incomes where inhabitants \nwere able to switch to cash crops. \n19.  The environmental and social concerns in implementing road projects are new areas for \nthe  Government  and  the  relevant  institutions  need  considerable  capacity  strengthening, \nespecially  at  the  local  level.  Another  important  lesson  that  emerges  from  evaluation  of \nenvironmentally sensitive projects in the Lao PDR is that adequate resources need to be \nprovided to ensure mitigation measures for environmental and social concerns. The Project has \nattempted to mainstream most of the lessons within the design of the Project, with adequate \nresources to build local capacity and on-the-job training. \n                                                 \n7   The World Food Program vulnerability index is a weighted index of six indices: net rice production, large animals \nper household, access to road, and access to forested land, education, and health.  \n8   Medical practitioner, trained nurse, community health worker, or dispensary. \n9   Lao PDR. 2001.

Objective \n20.  The primary goal of the Project is to strengthen regional infrastructure linkages between \nGMS members. The project road will help facilitate trade and investment in the region. A direct \nlink between the PRC and Thailand via the Lao PDR will reduce transport costs in the regional \nproject influence area, and increase the efficiency of the movement of vehicles, goods, and \npassengers. The area of the indirect influence of the Project is potentially large and covers a \npopulation of about 42 million in the immediate provinces in these three countries. At present, \ninternational trade flows rely on one of three links that are quite restricted and not very reliable: \n(i) river traffic on the Mekong River, (ii) Thailand to the PRC via Myanmar, and (iii) the poor \nquality project road. Upgrading the project road will provide the essential transport infrastructure \nto facilitate the economic and social development of the project influence area.  \n21.  This link will also help to accelerate the development process of the Lao PDR by linking \nits economy to two rapidly growing economies of the region. The road link will help reduce \npoverty  by  providing  access  to  markets,  extension  services,  income  and  employment \nopportunities, and enhancing development potential.  At present, domestic trade flows within \nBokeo and Louang Namtha provinces are constrained by a single, narrow, unsealed road that is \nclosed for about 4 months of the year during the wet season. The project road is Bokeo \nprovince\u2019s only connection with the rest of the Lao PDR, other than limited river traffic along the \nMekong River.  \nB.  Components and Outputs \n22.  The  Project  will  consist  of  three  components:  (i) construction  of  the  project  road, \n(ii) implementation of an area development plan, and (iii) capacity building at the provincial and \nsector levels. \n1.  Project Road \n23.  The project road consists of approximately 228 km of national route 3 from Houayxay in \nBokeo province to Boten in Louang Namtha province. Of the 228 km, the last 20 km will follow \nthe existing national route 13N to Boten. The civil works will consist of: (i) reconstruction and \nupgrading of the entire length of the road to a sealed, two-lane road; (ii) construction of new \nbridges, and widening of existing bridges as required; (iii) upgrading of ferry facilities at the \nMekong River; and (iv) construction of 7.1 km of new bypass around the town of Louang \nNamtha.  \n24.  ADB will finance the civil works to upgrade a 74 km section of the project road to a \nstandard consistent with its potential as a major international link. The other two sections of the \nroad will be built under separate bilateral financing arrangements with the governments of the \nPRC and Thailand. The three financiers will be responsible for one section each but the road \nwill be designed and constructed for a single set of geometric design standards. The division of \nthe road is based on three sections of equal cost. The northern section of the project road will \nbe funded by the PRC Government and this section will consist of approximately 69 km of road, \nstarting from the PRC border. The southern section of the project road will be funded by the \nGovernment of Thailand and will cover approximately 85 km, starting from Houayxay and \nheading north. The central section of 74 km will be funded by ADB.  \n ", "7 \n25.  The  project  feasibility  study  considered  several  improvement  options  ranging  from \nmodest improvements to the existing track to a high standard two-lane highway with significant \nchanges to the existing alignment and geometry. The feasibility study concluded that a high \nstandard  two-lane  highway  was,  in  economic  terms,  the  optimum  solution  but  noted  that \nconstruction  of  such  a  road  would  have  undesirable  environmental  and  social  impacts. \nTherefore, the geometric design standard adopted for the Project is that of a high standard, two-\nlane highway but these geometric standards will be allowed to vary along the road (with \nimplications  for  the  speed  of  travel)  such  that  the  existing  alignment  may  be  retained. \nConstruction standards will be uniform for the entire road for a two-lane road with a 7-meter (m) \nwide sealed pavement and sealed shoulders varying between 1.5 and 2.5 m on each side.  \n26.  Existing border facilities will be retained at both the Thailand and PRC borders, although \nconstruction of new facilities at the Thailand border will be required if detailed design shows that \nthe existing ferry facilities need to be relocated. It is possible that the ferry facilities to cross the \nMekong River will prove inadequate to deal with the flows of transit traffic. The financial and \neconomic analyses of construction of a bridge across the Mekong River were carried out to \nassess viability of the additional investment required for such a bridge. The Project will include \nconstruction  of  the  bridge  if  adequate  resources,  including  loan  savings,  are  available  to \ncomplete the construction of the bridge.  \n2.  Area Development  \n27.  The  second  component\u2014area  development\u2014will  include  two  separate,  but \ninterdependent, plans designed to ensure that the development benefits reach the people living \nin the project area and that the resources that they rely on are protected and developed in a \nsustainable way. The first subcomponent will consist of a resettlement plan (Appendix 4 and \nSupplementary Appendix A) that will ensure that the immediate impact of construction of the \nroad will not be directly adverse on the communities presently living along the road. The second \nsubcomponent\u2014social  action  plan  (SAP)\u2014is  designed  to  enhance  project  benefits  to  the \ncommunities, especially the ethnic minorities along the road. The SAP includes an ethnic \nminority  development  plan  and  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples and Section 53 of the Operations Manual (Supplementary Appendix B). It is \nbased on a preliminary assessment of the present conditions of the communities along the road, \npotential project impacts, their capacity to benefit from the Project, and suggested interventions \nfor mitigating adverse impacts. A total of $3.7 million will be allocated to the SAP, comprising \ncommunity roads ($1.6 million), water and sanitation schemes ($1.2 million), and education and \nother awareness campaigns ($0.9 million). \n28.  Community  Roads.  An  amount  of  $1.6 million  is  allocated  for  the  construction  of \ncommunity roads along the project road. The various road segments are to be selected based \non  a  participatory  process  involving  the  communities  and  the  provincial  authorities.  This \nparticipatory process will be guided by consultants engaged as part of the project coordination \nteam. The consultants will prepare and submit a justification report for the selected roads based \non the following criteria: (i) the roads will be selected using a community-based participatory \napproach; (ii) the roads will not be widened to more than 3.5 m; (iii) no new alignments will be \nconstructed; (iv) arrangements will be in place for community-based maintenance; (v) roads that \nprovide access to protected forests, virgin forests, and steep slope areas will not be included; \n(vi) tree felling must be avoided; (vii) road selection will comply with all regulations regarding \nimpacts  on  provincial  and  national  biodiversity  areas;  (viii) the  roads  will  not  involve  the \nconstruction of major drainage structures; and (ix) the roads will avoid displacing or adversely \naffecting villages, individual homesteads, or agricultural land. \n ", "8 \n29.  Water and Sanitation Schemes. The SAP will also cover village water and sanitation \nschemes for villages along the project road and the town of Viangphoukha at an estimated cost \nof $1.20million. The selection of villages to benefit from water and sanitation schemes will be \nbased  on  the  following  criteria:  (i) the  villages  will  be  selected  using  a  community-based \nparticipatory approach, (ii) arrangements will be in place for community-based maintenance, \n(iii) construction of the schemes will avoid displacing or adversely affecting villages or individual \nhomesteads/agricultural  production  areas,  and  (iv) construction  of  the  schemes  will  avoid \nenvironmental degradation. \n30.  It is expected that the projects developed under these subcomponents of the SAP will be \nrelatively  small  and  not  involve  resettlement  or  adverse  environmental  impacts.  If  small \ndisplacement  seems  essential,  appropriate  compensation  measures  will  be  provided  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s  Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and will be consistent with the \nresettlement plan prepared for the Project. \n31.  Education  and  Awareness  Programs.  The  Project  may  lead  to  short-term  and \nmedium-term negative impacts in terms of higher incidence of sexually transmitted diseases \n(STD), HIV/AIDS, drug use, and trafficking in women and children. The SAP will also include \nsubcomponents such as: (i) a preventive education program for HIV/AIDS/STD and trafficking \nawareness, (ii) a nonformal education program, and (iii) a road safety awareness program. A \ntotal of $0.9 million will be allocated to these programs. Detailed design of the SAP will be done \nduring project implementation, using a community-based participatory approach (Appendix 5). \n32.  Community Development in Nam Ha Watershed. A linked initiative is a pilot project \nfor proposed funding from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for community development \ncovering nine villages in the Nam Ha watershed. This project will assist these communities \ncontinue the development of sustainable and permanent land-use systems of agriculture and \nforestry.  This  will  enable  them  to  avoid  an  ever-increasing  scale  of  swidden  agricultural \nproduction with associated negative environmental and economic impacts. This project aims to \nmaximize  the  stability  and  productivity  of  agriculture  while  developing  an  agro-forestry \ncomponent that will ensure longer-term income and food security, increase the level of forest \ncover for watershed protection, improve wildlife habitat, and generate additional local income. \nThe major components of this project include participatory assessment of land capability; \nconsultative land-use planning with communities, district, and provincial government personnel; \nand cooperative development of secure land-use rights and land title for farming families. In \nparallel, this project will develop alternative livelihood components (small-scale irrigation, rain-\nfed upland arable land terracing and land stabilization, fruit orchards, nontimber forest products \ndomestication, livestock systems, and firewood and community forest plantation). This would be \ncombined with a component to link the increased productivity with the marketing potential \navailable through the construction of the project road. \n3.  Capacity Building at Sector and Provincial Levels \n33.  The Project includes international third-party monitoring of the environmental impact of \nthe road. This program of monitoring will integrate local capacity building through on-the-job \ntraining and formal modules of training for the road sector, at the provincial level, and for the \nEnvironment Research Institute11 set up under the Science, Technology, and Environment \nAgency (STEA). This will help enhance the local capacity for carrying out environmental and \n                                                 \n11  The Environment Research Institute has been established to monitor environmental conditions in the Lao PDR. \n ", "9 \nsocial  monitoring  of  all  agencies,  including  Department  of  Roads,  provincial  divisions  of \ntransport, local governments at the provincial level, district level science, technology, and \nenvironment offices, and the Environment Research Institute through formal and on-the-job \ntraining through consulting services.  \n34.  The consulting services for the third-party monitoring includes a specific subcomponent \nto build capacity of these local units covering (i) environmental impact assessment and project \nlevel monitoring; (ii) policies, procedures, and best practices related to resettlement, social \npreparation, social impact assessment; (iii) stakeholder  analysis;  and  (iv) participatory rapid \nappraisal, monitoring, and evaluation. The Project will thus help to operationalize the program of \npolicy  reforms  agreed  under  the  Environment  and  Social  Program  Loan12  relating  to \nenvironment management and social safeguards for environmentally sensitive infrastructure \nprojects. The Government has agreed to include two affected provinces, Bokeo and Louang \nNamtha, to implement these policy measures, including setting up environment and social \ndivisions with adequate staff resources ahead of the second tranche schedule of March 2003.  \nC.  Special Features \n1.  GMS Collaboration \n35.  The Project is the first example of GMS partnership where two developing member \ncountries have collaborated with ADB to invest in a regional road in a third country to promote \nregional cooperation. Thailand and the PRC have been equal partners with ADB in supporting \nthis project in the Lao PDR to enhance regional cooperation. ADB has been a catalyst in \nmobilizing additional development assistance amounting to over $60 million on terms more \nconcessional than the Asian Development Fund from these two large neighbors of the Lao \nPDR. The Project thus is an important milestone in ADB's efforts in the GMS Program. The \nProject will demonstrate that it is possible to set up a cooperative framework among GMS \ncountries to design, develop, and finance an infrastructure facility that is self-sustaining.  \n2.  Environment  \n36.  The project area includes Nam Ha, one of 18 national biodiversity conservation areas \n(NBCAs). In 1999, large extensions were approved to Nam Ha NBCA in recognition of the need \nfor establishing contiguity. The Government extended the protected area boundaries to include \na large area known as Ham Ha National Protected Area in 1999. The entire Nam Ha NBCA \ncovers  222,400  hectares  and  is  contiguous  with  the  Shiang  Yong  Protected  Area  in \nXishuangpanna National Nature Reserve in the PRC. The road has been in existence for \ndecades, but these extensions have resulted in the road passing through Nam Ha NBCA since \n1999.  In  Lao  PDR  all  NBCAs,  including  Nam  Ha,  are  in  reality  multiple  use  areas:  for \nagriculture, fishing, hydropower, commercial nontimber forest harvests, and sometimes timber \nharvests. None is strictly a national park as the term is meant in other countries. \n37.  The Government of the Lao PDR has ranked all NBCAs in terms of priority, assessing \ntheir biodiversity contribution to the NBCA system.13 The highest ranking NBCAs do not include \nNam  Ha  NBCA,  if  the  importance  of  Lao  PDR\u2019s  NBCAs  is  considered  exclusively  in  an \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2001.

Vientiane. \n ", "10 \ninternational,  ecosystem  context.14  However,  Nam  Ha  NBCA  has  high  watershed  values, \necotourism potential value, and wildlife habitat value. Nam Ha NBCA is an important habitat to \nat least 37 mammals and 288 bird species, including a number of endangered and threatened \nspecies such as wild Asian elephants, tigers, and bears.  \n38.  One of the important goals of the transport sector strategy in the Lao PDR is minimizing \nnegative  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  roads.  The  Government's  strategy  includes \nstrengthening linkages between the Road Law 1999, the Environmental Protection Law 1999, \nand the Land Law 1995. The feasibility report included a baseline survey of the habitat value of \nNam Ha NBCA prepared by the World Conservation Society and as per this assessment the \nexisting  alignment  of  the  road  does  not  pass  through  core  conservation  zone  for  wildlife \n(Supplementary Appendix C). This baseline survey will help monitor the long-term impact of this \nroad project and will help the Government establish monitoring and evaluation systems for \nprotected areas. \n39.  Better road access may lead to indirect impacts such as increased commercial and other \nlogging and wildlife trade in the region. In October 2000, the Government of the Lao PDR \nintroduced new policies leading to the gradual phasing out of logging quotas. The new order \nprohibits logging in areas other than (i) infrastructure development sites, and (ii) production \nforests with proper management plans. The latter allows production forest logging only in \ndesignated areas (Table 4). There has been some reduction in logging in the two provinces in \nthe last few years and the Government has agreed that during the next 4 years, actual logging \nlevels will be further reduced by 30%.  \nTable 4: Logging in Louang Namtha and Bokeo Provinces \n  Louang Namtha  Bokeo \nYear  Planned Quota  Actual Utilization  Planned Quota  Actual Utilization \n(in m3)  (in m3)  (in m3)  (in m3) \n1996\u20131997  3,000  3,000  2,500  290 \n1997\u20131998  3,300  2,172  3,000  3,000 \n1998\u20131999  2,300  4,160  1,000  1,613 \n1999\u20132000  2,000  2,000  500  500 \n2000\u20132001  2,300  2,320  500  500 \nSource: Ministry of Agriculture and Forests. \n40.  Overall detection of forest crimes and theft is low in the Lao PDR. The Government \nneeds  to  undertake  comprehensive  measures  to  reduce  overall  trade  in  wildlife  including \nmeasures such as tighter implementation of the existing laws, monitoring, education, and \ncommunity awareness programs. The Project includes establishing three forestry checkpoints, \none in each district for this purpose, and strengthening local capacity to enhance detection. \nOverall, the Project is expected to have a positive impact on the environment due to lower \nlogging, better monitoring, local capacity build-up, and responsive contracting. The summary \nenvironmental impact assessment (SEIA) was circulated to the Board on 20 August 2002. \n                                                 \n14  If one were to rank ecosystems that are most distinctive and limited globally, then the highest value sites would be \nthe Annamite Mountain NBCAs in the Lao PDR and lowland evergreen forests.  \n ", "11 \nD.  Cost Estimates \n41.  The total cost of the project road is estimated at $95.8 million. Table 5 summarizes cost \nestimates for the entire Project.

Financing Plan \n42.  The Government of the Lao PDR has requested a loan of $30 million equivalent from the \nSpecial Funds resources to finance 80% of the ADB section of the road. ADB will cover the \nentire foreign exchange cost of  the ADB section of the Project estimated at  $23.77 million \nequivalent and $6.23 million of local currency costs from the loan proceeds. The Government \nwill finance the remainder of the local  currency cost components of the ADB portion of the \nProject from its own internal sources, which is approximately $7.29 million equivalent. The \nproportion of local currency funding proposed under this loan is justified by the nature of the \nProject, particularly its focus on poverty alleviation and the current fiscal conditions of the \nGovernment of the Lao PDR. On these assumptions, the financing plan is presented in Table 6. \n43.  A loan of Special Drawing Rights 22,731,000 ($30 million equivalent) will be made from \nthe Special Funds resources for a term of 32 years with a grace period of 8 years. The loan will \ncarry an interest rate of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The Borrower will be \nthe Lao PDR. The foreign exchange risk of the loan will be borne by the Government. The \nBorrower will make the loan proceeds available through budgetary allocations. The PRC will \nprovide an interest-free loan with a grace period of 10 years and a repayment period of 10 \nyears. The financing includes 20% grant. The Thailand loan has a maturity of 30 years, \n ", "12 \nincluding a grace period of 10 years. The Thailand loan will have an interest rate of 1.5% and \nabout 10% of the principal will be interest free, thus effectively reducing the interest rate.  \nTable 6: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Foreign Exchange  Local Currency  Total Costs  % \nADB  23.77  6.23  30.00  31.3 \nPRC Government  23.18  6.82  30.00  31.3 \nThailand Government  21.10  7.40  28.50  29.8 \nLao PDR Government   0.00  7.29  7.29  7.6 \nTotal  68.05  27.74  95.79  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank; Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource: Staff estimates. \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n44.  Project management will be a critical activity given that the construction of the project \nroad will require the coordination of the simultaneous construction of the entire road in three \nsections, each section being funded and implemented using funds from three different sources. \nThe Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction has a generally successful \nrecord in implementing road and bridge works under projects financed by ADB and other \nexternal financing agencies, and has sufficient capacity and experience to be the Executing \nAgency for the Project. Within the Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction, \nDepartment of Roads will be responsible for implementation and overall coordination.  \n45.  The  Project  will  be  managed  by  a  project  management  unit  headed  by  a  project \nmanager  appointed  on  a  full-time  basis  and  accountable  to  the  director-general  of  the \nDepartment of Roads. The project manager will be directly responsible for the supervision of the \nADB-funded components. Under the project manager, two full-time deputy project managers will \nbe appointed who will take responsibility for the implementation of the road sections to be \nfunded by loans from the governments of the PRC and Thailand. The transport divisions of \nLouang Namtha and Bokeo provinces will provide suitable counterparts to assist the project \nmanagement  unit.  The  construction  supervision  consultant\u2019s  team  leader  will  act  as  the \nemployer\u2019s representative for the ADB-funded civil works and will provide support to the project \nmanagement unit for coordination of the implementation of all three sections of the project road. \n2.  Implementation Period \n46.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 56 months, inclusive of preconstruction \nactivities. It is expected to be completed by 31 December 2006 (Appendix 7). \n3.  Procurement \n47.  Procurement of all civil works contract will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. For the ADB-financed section of the project road, bidding will follow international \ncompetitive bidding procedures for a design-build (turnkey) contract and the contractor will be \nselected from prequalified bidders. The contracts for the toll collection including axle load \nsystem, community roads and water and sanitation schemes subcomponents of the SAP will be \n ", "13 \nunder  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  using  the  Government\u2019s  standard  bidding \ndocuments,  which  have  been  reviewed  and  accepted  by  ADB  for  other  projects.  The \nGovernment  requested  ADB  approval  for  advance  procurement  action  for  the  civil  works \nprocurement on the understanding that such approval would not commit ADB to finance the \nProject. Advance procurement action would allow Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post \nand  Construction  to  commence  work  on  preconstruction  activities  and  would  shorten  the \nimplementation  period  by  about  1  year.  A  list  of  contract  packages  and  the  mode  of \nprocurement are given in Appendix 8. \n \n48.  For contracts bid under local competitive bidding, the civil works will be implemented by \nqualified local contractors, engaged by the provincial divisions of communications, transport, \npost and construction guided by the project management unit and supervised by the project \ncoordination consultants. The contractor selection process will follow the principles set out in the \nADB Guidelines for Procurement. Local contractors that are state-owned enterprises should be \nfinancially independent and operate according to commercial laws. \n4.  Recruitment of Consultants \n49.  About 195 person-months of international consultants and about 950 person-months of \ndomestic consultants will be required to assist in project coordination, construction supervision, \nand  management.  The  consultants  are  expected  to  be  recruited  as  an  association  of \ninternational and domestic firms engaged by the Government. The consultants will be recruited \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB on the engagement of consultants. The services have been divided into four \npackage  as  follows:  (i)  Project  coordination  and  construction  supervision  consultant. \nRecruitment for this package of services will be based on quality and cost-based selection \nprocedures  for  international  recruitment;  (ii)  Resettlement  planning,  implementation,  and \ncapacity-building  consultants.  Recruitment  for  this  package  of  services  will  be  based  on \nprocedures  for  the  recruitment  of  individual  consultants;  (iii)  HIV/AIDS/STD/Trafficking \nawareness and preventive education program. Recruitment for this package of services will be \nbased on quality and cost-based selection procedures for international recruitment; and (iv) \nEnvironment  management  plan.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  the  recruitment  of  the \nInternational Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (World Conservation \nUnion) for the Project on a direct selection basis to implement the environment management \nplan.  Draft  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  are  presented  in  Appendix  9.  The \nGovernment requested ADB approval for advance action for the recruitment of the consultants \non the understanding that such approval would not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n5.  Project Review \n50.  A project inception mission will be fielded soon after approval of the proposed loan to \ninitiate  the  implementation  process.  In  addition,  ADB  will  conduct  regular  (at  least  twice \nannually) detailed reviews of the overall progress of the Project. If the results of such reviews \nindicate serious implementation problems, the Government and ADB will agree on appropriate \nmeasures, including changes in the scope of implementation arrangements, to ensure that \nobjectives are met. ADB reviews will also, in consultation with the Government, determine the \nneed for complementing facilities and measures to enhance the effectiveness of the Project. \n51.  The Executing Agency will prepare a project completion report within 3 months of \ncompletion of the Project. Aside from assessment of the execution and operation of the Project, \nthe project completion report will indicate compliance with loan covenants. \n ", "14 \n6.  Disbursements \n52.  Loan disbursements for all consulting services contracts will make use of the direct \npayment  procedures  defined  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  Disbursements  for \ninternational  and  local  competitive  bidding  civil  works  contracts  and  for  incremental \nexpenditures will also make use of direct payment procedures. \n53.  Disbursements for the water and sanitation schemes subcomponent of the SAP will be \nthrough an imprest account, from which drawdowns will be made upon approval of subprojects \nby ADB. To ensure the timely disbursement of funds for the construction of small-scale works \nunder this component under force account and direct purchase procurement arrangements, a \nsecond-generation imprest account will be established at the provincial level. \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n54.  The Executing Agency will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify \nthe  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan,  the  financing  resources \nreceived, the expenditures incurred for the Project, and the use of local funds. Within 6 months \nof the close of the fiscal year, MCTPC will submit annual project accounts to ADB, which \nprovide a detailed description of the source of funds and expenditures made. Annual project \naccounts must be audited by an auditor acceptable to ADB, and the auditor\u2019s terms of reference \nwill be approved by ADB prior to commencement of work. The audit results will be submitted to \nADB on an annual basis. \n55.  Regular progress reports for the Project will be prepared by MCTPC and submitted to \nADB on a quarterly basis. The reports will include a description of the physical progress, \nprocurement and contractual status, and highlights of any implementation issues. These reports \nwill  include  an  evaluation  of  progress  in  implementing  the  SAP,  resettlement  plan,  and \nenvironment management plan for the Project. The progress reports should also contain a \nsummary of project accounts, including details on the latest project expenditures and contract \namounts. \nG.  Project Performance, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n56.  The Executing Agency assisted by the consultants for project coordination will establish \nsystematic project performance monitoring and analysis throughout the life of the Project in \naccordance with ADB's Project Performance Management System Handbook, integrating it with \nthe existing management information system. Initially, the monitoring system will develop and \nconduct sample surveys to establish baseline data for subsequent performance monitoring. \nThereafter,  surveys  will  be  conducted  depending  on  the  need  to  provide  feedback  on \nimplementation of the Project. Key indicators identified in the project framework will form the \ncore of the data required for such an assessment. Such a monitoring system will also include \nparameters for natural resources and social conditions for the project beneficiaries. \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n57.  The  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  be  people  living  along  the  corridor,  transport \ncompanies, exporters and importers in these three countries, and people who derive income \nfrom enhanced trade and investments in the region. The benefits will take the form of lower \ntransportation  costs,  faster  and  more  reliable  transport  services,  and  income  and  growth \nopportunities along the road. \n ", "15 \nA.  Project Benefits \n1.  Institutional and Policy Aspects \n58.  It is expected that the Project will enhance two important aspects for the transport sector \nin the Lao PDR: first, the development and implementation of a system of road charges for the \nProject and all other major international corridors will open an opportunity for the Lao PDR\u2014a \nlandlocked country at the center of the GMS\u2014to generate revenue from infrastructure services. \nAn agreement has been reached with the governments of the PRC and Thailand that a system \nof road charges for vehicles and passengers will be in place so as to generate adequate \nresources for the Lao PDR to cover debt service and road maintenance.  \n59.  Second,  it  is  important  to  ensure  that  such  corridors  do  not  lead  to  negative \nenvironmental and social impacts and hence the Project will also develop capacity at the sector \nand  institutional  levels  to  implement  environmentally  sensitive  projects  and  monitor  social \nsafeguard issues. Given the limited capacity and resources to monitor natural resources, local \ncapacity and incentives are the only viable options to preserve these local assets. It is expected \nthat the Project will enhance both these aspects, by developing local capacity and by creating \neconomic opportunities in this remote region of the country. \n2.  Development Impacts \n60.  It is expected that the Project will enhance market opportunities for the two provinces \nand  the  northern  region  in  terms  of  expanding  agriculture  and  other  income-generating \nactivities. A neighboring district, Moung Sing, has seen rapid agricultural development covering \nnew crops such as sugar cane, plantation crops, and other cash crops with the improvement of \nthe road infrastructure linking it to the PRC.  \n61.  The area has been attracting a number of international tourists traveling through to the \nPRC and Thailand and spending a few days in these provinces for trekking, even though the \ntourist infrastructure, including transportation, is inadequate. In the last few years, a number of \nguest houses and restaurants have opened to meet tourist needs. An important destination in \nthe region, the Golden Triangle, expects to receive about 1 million tourists in 2002. There is \nsignificant tourism development potential once the road opens up this area as the road passes \nthrough beautiful locations that have remained hidden to outsiders for lack of infrastructure.  \n62.  High dependence on subsistence agriculture is a major cause for poverty in the project \narea. Improved access to markets is expected to facilitate the transformation from subsistence \nto commercial agriculture. Off-farm employment opportunities in the services sector such as \nrestaurants and transport services, as well as other income diversification potential will reduce \nvulnerability to external shocks, especially natural disasters. \n63.   Average household expenditure on food accounts for 71% of total consumption in \nLouang  Namtha  and  66%  in  Bokeo  province.  The  poor  spend  about  80%  of  their  total \nconsumption on food. Improved access and reduced transportation costs into the area have two \nmajor impacts on food expenditure. First, they reduce vulnerability to food shortages and rice \ndeficiencies by the increased inflow of food items. Second, they reduce consumer prices and \nthus expenditure on food items not only for the poor but all. Further, preliminary analysis \nindicates that the ability of development and assistance program to target both poor households \nand poor villages is largely governed by access to all-weather roads. Thus, both the quantity of \ndevelopment  programs  and  the  cost-effectiveness  of  these  programs  can  be  expected  to \n ", "16 \nimprove. The ability to target poverty can also be expected to improve with better access. This \nis especially important for Viangphoukha, the poorest and most access-deprived district in the \nproject area (Appendix 10). \n3.  Economic Analysis \n64.  The Project is an important north-south link in the GMS. The demand for this road can \nbe gauged from the river traffic on the Mekong between Thailand and the PRC: with the \neffectiveness  of  the  commercial  navigation  agreement  in  June  2001,  river  traffic  between \nYunnan Province and Thailand has increased by over 140% in one year, amounting to two-way \ntrade of over $65 million or 150,000 tons. This is still an insignificant 1% of total trade between \nThailand and southern China, estimated at about $6.5 billion.  \n65.  The project road has also experienced significant growth of 20% per annum in local \ntraffic compared to 1997, when the pre-feasibility study was prepared. Traffic forecasts for \nnormal local traffic were prepared looking at past growth rates, vehicle registration trends, and \nincome growth for the two provinces (Appendix 11). At present, lignite traffic equivalent to 90 \nvehicles is carried daily between Viangphoukha and Houayxay and across to Thailand. Lignite \ntraffic is assumed to remain constant over the project life because this is constrained by actual \nextraction rates. The Project also includes benefits from two other categories of traffic savings \naccruing to land-bridge traffic and time savings. Land-bridge traffic essentially indicates how the \nLao PDR will serve as a bridge between Thailand and Yunnan Province once this north-south \nroute is developed. In order to estimate regional benefits from this traffic, analyses were carried \nout of existing trade and tourist traffic among the three countries, alternative routes, and \ndevelopment plans for Yunnan Province and northern Thailand. \n66.  The project economic analysis was carried out for the Lao PDR and for the subregion, \ni.e., PRC, Lao PDR, and Thailand based on a comparison of with and without project cases. \nThe economic capital cost of road improvement excludes price contingencies, taxes, and duties. \nThe costs were expressed in constant 2002 prices and include routine maintenance costs and \nperiodic resurfacing of the pavement for the improved road. Without the road, operation and \nmaintenance  costs  are  estimated  for  a  gravel  road.  All  local  costs  were  assumed  to  be \nnontradables and a standard conversion factor of 0.8 was used. The benefits include mainly \nvehicle operating cost savings arising from improved road and distance savings of about 23 kms \nas well as time savings. Overall, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was 27% for the \nsubregion. For the Lao PDR, the EIRR is 12.8% if we only account for savings in vehicle \noperating  costs  accruing  to  local  traffic.  If  we  add  the  benefits  from  road  charges  from \ninternational traffic, the EIRR for the Lao PDR increases to 18%. The Project results in net \nbenefits of the $20 million for the Lao PDR, and about $47 million each for the PRC and \nThailand. If the fiscal impacts of additional toll revenues are included, the net benefits are \ndistributed to the Lao PDR at $55 million, and that of the PRC and Thailand at $30 million each.  \n67.  The project analysis is based on the assumption that existing ferry facilities on the \nMekong River will be able to cope with the increased traffic with minor investments. This may \nnot be feasible and so an incremental analysis is also carried out to assess the viability of \nconstructing a bridge over the Mekong River. The net present value of the bridge was found to \nbe significantly higher compared to the net present value of ferry facilities. The EIRR analysis \nindicates that constructing a bridge will result in enhancing overall viability for the Lao PDR.  \n ", "17 \n4.  Affordability and Financial Analysis  \n68.   Even though the Project is viable with EIRRs of 26% to 28%, it is important to ensure \nthat  the  Project  generates  adequate  financial  revenues  to  cover  debt  service  and  road \nmaintenance costs. All the financiers have agreed to a system of road charges on traffic \ncrossing borders such that the Project does not add to the fiscal burden of the Lao PDR. An \nanalysis was carried out to estimate the level of road charges needed to cover debt service and \nroad maintenance and other related costs. It was found that the Project would require road \ncharges from regional traffic of $20 per passenger car unit equivalent at each border crossing or \n$40 in total. The lignite traffic is assumed to have a concessional transit fee of $10 per crossing \nbecause of their past investments in the road section from Viangphoukha to Houayxay. With \nthese levels of road charges, the  financial internal rate of return is 6.4% compared to the \nweighted average cost of capital of 4.25% (Appendix 12). \nB.  Project Risks \n69.  The economic analysis of the Project suggests that there are no significant economic \nrisks  since  the  project  investments  are  viable  for  the  Lao  PDR  even  if  there  were  no \ninternational traffic, however, the Project carries a commercial risk: if the land-bridge traffic is \nlower than projected, the economy will still have to service the debt. The Project implies a large \ndebt for a country that is already classified as a heavily indebted country. The level of traffic \nneeded to cover this commercial risk is only 150 passenger car units equivalent compared to \nthe actual traffic of nearly 100 at present.15 There is considerable local freight and passenger \ntraffic that also cross borders and so if there is a fiscal deficit, additional revenues can be \ngenerated from local users as well. Overall, the commercial risk is reduced significantly by \nensuring concessional terms for the bilateral loans: the loan terms from both countries are more \nconcessional than the Asian Development Fund. \n70.  The Project also carries  a risk of deforestation and loss of habitat value over the \nmedium-term if adequate steps are not taken to protect the natural resource base in this area. \nThis will have a negative impact on indigenous people who depend on these resources for their \nlivelihood.  The  Project  has  a  linked  component  that  will  demonstrate  how  a  sustainable \nlivelihood  can  be  assured  while  still  improving  overall  infrastructure  services.  Government \nagencies are conscious of this risk. In Louang Namtha province, a pilot eco-tourism project has \nshown  that  the  best  way  to  preserve  the  natural  resource  base  is  to  ensure  that  local \ncommunities participate in preservation and have incentives to support such a program. It is \nexpected that with growth in alternative employment and income generation activities, swidden \nor slash-and-burn practices will be reduced considerably. The Project integrates mitigative \nmeasures  and  builds  in  awareness  campaigns  over  a  medium-term  to  preserve  natural \nresources in the region. In addition, the Government has agreed to lower the levels of logging \nallowed in the two provinces, such that the overall impact of the Project on the environment will \nbe positive.  \n71.  The  main  implementation  risks  for  the  Project  relate  to  social  safeguard  issues, \nespecially for the sections financed through bilateral loans. The governments of the PRC and \nThailand have agreed to fully respect the SEIA prepared by the Lao PDR Government and \n                                                 \n15  At present, considerable transshipment takes place because of the constraints to freight movement across \nborders. With cross-border agreements in place between all GMS members by 2005, it is expected that \ntransshipment will not take place and vehicles will be able to cross borders freely.  \n ", "18 \nmitigation measures identified therein. The Loan Agreement with the Government of the Lao \nPDR will cover conditions covering these aspects. In addition, clauses to meet ADB's safeguard \npolicies  will  be  integrated  in  the  contracts  with  the  construction  companies  in  terms  of \nperformance bonds. The Project includes third-party monitoring by the International Union for \nthe  Conservation  of  Nature  and  Natural  Resources  (World  Conservation  Union)  and  an \nallocation of $1.0 million is included in the Project costs. There is strong government ownership \nof environmental and social safeguard issues, as indicated in the provisions already covered \nunder ADB\u2019s Environment and Social Program Loan (footnote 12). \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n72.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the Department of Roads \nhave given the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)  Technical Design and Standards. The Government will ensure that technical \naudits are carried out on the project road at quarterly intervals. The schedule for \nthe first such audit will be decided by the Government and ADB, but will not be \nlater than 6 months after the award of civil works contracts for construction of the \nproject road. The project management unit will set up institutional arrangements \nto approve the actual design of all sections  of the project road acceptable to \nADB. These approvals will be governed by the agreements on design standards \nand criteria as agreed in the Kunming Quadripartite Meeting held on 6\u20137 August \n2002  and  will  follow  the  mitigation  measures  adopted  in  the  SEIA.  The \nGovernment has given an assurance that such arrangements will be an integral \npart of the loan documents with the governments of Thailand and the PRC to \nensure compliance.  \n(ii)  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. Any material change in the design or \nalignment of the project road will require the Government's approval so as to be \nconsistent with the Government's assurances given to ADB regarding safeguard \nissues as detailed in the SEIA. A change of project scope or realignment of the \nproject road will require the SEIA and the resettlement plan to be updated and \ndiscussed and mutually agreed between the Government and ADB before work \ncan continue. The Government will ensure that, following detailed design of all \nproject sections, a full census and inventory of lost assets for each section will be \nundertaken. \n(iii)  Road Charges. The Government will set up a system of road charges to recover \nthe required debt service, road maintenance, and other related costs for the \nproject  road.  Based  on  current  traffic  projections,  the  Project  will  require \ncollection of an average road charges of $40 per passenger car unit equivalent to \ncover debt service, road maintenance, and other related costs. The Government \nagreed that detailed arrangements for determining actual levels of road charges \nfor different vehicle types, rules, implementing regulations, and other institutional \narrangements will be prepared and mutually agreed with ADB within 18 months \nof loan effectiveness so that revenue can be collected as soon as a section of the \nroad is completed.  \n ", "19 \n(iv)  Counterpart Funds. The Government will ensure timely and adequate provision \nof counterpart funds for the Project. \n(v)  Environment Management. The Government will ensure that the approved \nSEIA will be implemented for the project road irrespective of contractual and \nfinancing  arrangements.  The  Government  will  inform  the  bilateral  financing \npartners  of  its  safeguard  obligations  on  ADB's  loans  and  incorporate  these \naspects in bilateral loan agreements. Environment impacts of the Project will be \nminimized through the appropriate mitigative measures recommended in the \nSEIA. The Government will ensure that appropriate prohibitions are built into the \ncontract documents for the contractors' work financed under loans from the \ngovernments of Thailand and the PRC so that negative environmental and social \nimpacts are mitigated during construction. The SEIA will be attached to the \nbidding documents and appropriate clauses inserted into the contract documents \nfor all sections of the project road. In such cases where contracting is carried out \ndirectly by the financiers, loan documents will clearly specify these requirements. \nWithin 6 months of loan effectiveness, Department of Roads will strengthen the \ncapabilities of the Environment and Social Division in social analysis, particularly \nto monitor social impacts of road projects. Additional staff resources will be \nprovided in areas of social development issues. \n(vi)  Reduced Logging. The Government has agreed to review and reduce the \npresent level of logging by about 30% in the next 4 years in Louang Namtha and \nBokeo provinces. The Government will monitor agreed logging levels and provide \nreports to ADB, which will be published widely.  \n(vii)  Axle Load and Forestry Checkpoints. Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, \nthe  Government  will  establish  three  weighing  stations  and  three  forestry \ncheckpoints on the project road with one in each of the three districts through \nwhich the road passes. The Government will also put in place a framework \nacceptable to ADB for monitoring wildlife  trade. The Government will provide \nregular reports on the status of load enforcement measures and incidence of \nvehicle overloading.  \n(viii)  Environment  Monitoring.  The  Government  will  put  in  place  a  system  of \nenvironment  monitoring  for  the  Project.  The  Government,  through  the \nEnvironment Research Institute, will directly engage the services of International \nUnion  for  the  Conservation  of  Nature  and  Natural  Resources  (World \nConservation Union) to undertake independent monitoring of the environmental \nimpact of construction on the project road. Provincial offices of transport divisions \nat  Louang  Namtha  and  Bokeo  will  also  set  up  functional  provincial  level \nenvironmental  and  social  monitoring  units  prior  to  the  start  of  construction \nactivities. The Government will provide the necessary staff and other resources \nfor these units to function effectively.  \n(ix)  Operation and Maintenance. Department of Roads will be responsible for the \noperation  and  maintenance  of  the  project  road  through  proper  technical \nsupervision and adequate  allocation of funds. The completed Project will be \nmaintained to a standard consistent with an international link as part of the Lao \nPDR national road network under the Road Maintenance Fund. A predetermined \namount of revenue will be allocated from the road charges to be imposed on the \n ", "20 \ninternational transit traffic to ensure that adequate resources are available for \nmaintenance.  \n(x)  Social  Action  Plan.  The  Government  will  take  all  measures  necessary  to \nimplement to the satisfaction of ADB a detailed SAP developed and approved for \nthe Project in a community participatory manner. The participatory process to \ndevelop the SAP will ensure 50% participation in decision making by women. \n(xi)  Health Risks. The Government will ensure that all civil works contracts reflect \nthe need for an information and education campaign on STD and HIV/AIDS and \ntrafficking in women and children as part of the health and safety program at \ncampsites during the construction period.  \n(xii)  Labor Laws. The Government will ensure that all civil works contractors comply \nwith all applicable labor laws and do not employ child labor in construction \nactivities.  The  Government  will  ensure  a  policy  of  gender-equal  wages  for \nconstruction activities. \n(xiii)  Cross-Border  Arrangements.  The  Borrower  will  finalize  the  necessary \nimplementing rules, regulations, and protocols for passenger and vehicle traffic \nwith the PRC and Thailand so as to ensure that by 2005, the Annexes and \nProtocols to the Agreement Between and Among the Governments of the Lao \nPDR, the Kingdom of Thailand,  and  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for \nFacilitation of Cross-Border Transport of Goods and People, dated 26 November \n1999, and as amended from time to time, may be completed.  \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n73.  The Government of the Lao PDR shall have been able to conclude loan agreements with \nthe governments of Thailand and the PRC, in a form and substance acceptable to ADB, and \nsuch loan agreements shall have become effective.  \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n74.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 22,731,000 to the Lao People's Democratic Republic for the Greater \nMekong Subregion: Northern Economic Corridor Project, with an interest charge at the rate of \n1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and  a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n26 November 2002 \n ", " \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \nProject Monitoring \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets  Assumptions and Risk \nMechanism \nGoals       \n\u2022 Accelerate regional development by  \u2022 Economic growth for the impact regions in the  \u2022 National and provincial  \u2022 Continued growth of Thailand and \nlinking two rapidly growing economies  immediate planning period  income accounts,  Yunnan Province, PRC \nof Thailand and the People's Republic  \u2022 Increased tonnage of interregional trade via  statistical yearbooks  \u2022 No adverse fiscal impact on the Lao \nof China by facilitating trade and  project road  PDR  \ninvestment in the region  \u2022 Increased foreign direct investment in the road \ninfluence area \n\u2022 Help reduce poverty in the Lao PDR  \u2022 Access to health and education facilities  \u2022 Participatory rural  \u2022 Complementary investments in \nby providing access to markets,  \u2022 Improved access to wider range of markets  appraisal results,  other economic infrastructure, \nextension services, income, and  \u2022 Improved access to employment opportunities  monitoring and evaluation   social services and programs, \nemployment opportunities, and by  adequate resettlement, and \nenhancing development potential  environment measures  \nPurpose       \n\u2022 Establish a direct link between the  \u2022 Reduced transportation cost of goods and  \u2022 Direct measures of travel  \u2022 Timely completion of sections \nPRC and Thailand via the Lao PDR to  passenger traffic  time and vehicle  financed by Thailand and PRC \nreduce transport cost within the  \u2022 Reduced travel time by 3 days (from 5 days) in  operating costs through  governments \nregional influence area and increase  2006  periodic surveys  \u2022 Allocation of sufficient funds for \nefficiency of the movement of  \u2022 International transit and cross-border  \u2022 Direct measures of freight  road maintenance \nvehicles, goods, and passengers  agreements in place by 2005  and passenger charges  \u2022 Institution of international transit \nthrough periodic surveys  system \nOutputs       \n\u2022 Upgraded 74 kilometer section of  \u2022 Safe, all weather overland route from Yunnan  \u2022 Project administration  \u2022 Good implementation coordination \nRoute 3 to a standard consistent with  Province, PRC to Thailand meeting appropriate  missions, progress  of the three road sections financed \nits potential as a major international  road standards  reports, project  by Asian Development Bank and by \nlink     completion report,  Thailand and PRC governments \n\u2022 Resettlement plan  \u2022 Implementation of right-of-way acquisition and  participatory rural  \u2022 Adequate social mobilization \n  resettlement plan  appraisal results  program \n\u2022 Social action plan  \u2022 Implementation of the social action and  \u2022 International third-party  \u2022 Adherence to adequate mitigation \n\u2022 Environment management plan  environment management plans  monitoring   measures as identified in the \n  \u2022 Independent monitoring  Summary Environmental Impact \nof resettlement plan   Assessment in environmentally \nsensitive project areas by \nA\ncontractors  p\np\nInputs        e\nn\n\u2022 Civil works   \u2022 Construction completed by December 2006  \u2022 Project administration  \u2022 Implementation capacity of the  d\n\u2022 Consulting services   \u2022 Acceptance and implementation of the various  missions, progress  Department of Roads;

Transport Modes \n1.  Transport in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is dominated by the road \nsector, which carries over 90% of freight and around 85% of passenger traffic on a network that \nextends over about 26,000 kilometers (km) consisting of national, provincial, and local roads. \nRiver traffic is limited to the Mekong and its tributaries, the Nam Ou and the Se Kong rivers. The \nMekong provides the only option for long-distance movement by river but in the wet season \nsignificant navigation hazards limit capacity. Air transport is limited by the poor quality and \nlimited number of operational air strips but plays a crucial role in linking the provincial centers in \notherwise inaccessible  parts of the country. Facilities at Vientiane and Louang Prabang are \nequipped to handle international traffic; a further 10 airstrips are located in provincial capitals.  \nB.  The Road Sector \n1.  Road Network \n2.  The country has a road network of about 26,000 km comprising national roads (28%), \nprovincial roads (34%), and urban and local roads (31%). Only 18% of the total road network is \npaved. The rest have gravel or earth surfaces. Some roads included in the official transport \nsystem are only at the planning stage and many of the local roads are mere tracks. The public \nroad network in the Lao PDR is divided into several different classes of roads: (i) national, \n(ii) provincial, (iii) district, (iv) urban, (v) rural, and (vi) special. Formal definitions of each class \nare given in the Road Law, which was published in 1999, with definitions of national and \nprovincial roads also included in Ministerial Decision 1312, issued in 1997, which formalized the \nlist of national roads. \n3.  Despite the many positive advances achieved in the national network, the Lao PDR \ncontinues to lag behind its neighbors in road infrastructure with a national road network of very \nlow density\u2014about 0.03 km per sq km. Road contact between Vientiane and many provincial \ncapitals remains problematic. Almost two thirds of the national road system remain unpaved and \nmuch of it remains impassable during the wet season. More than half of all district centers do \nnot have year-round road access and almost one sixth of them are inaccessible by road at any \ntime.  \n2.  Road Sector Institutions \n4.  Overall transport planning and coordination responsibilities lie with the Committee for \nPlanning  and  Cooperation,  which  is  headed  by  a  Deputy  Prime  Minister.  Committee  for \nPlanning  and  Cooperation  reviews  and  monitors  all  planning  activities,  including  those \noriginating from Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction (MCTPC), liaises \nwith external aid agencies, and monitors and supervises the implementation of development \nprojects. The organization and activities of MCTPC are defined by the Prime Minister\u2019s Decree \nNo. 66/PM of 12 May 1999. MCTPC has overall responsibility for developing national and \nprovincial roads, telecommunications, river, road, and air transport, and postal services. Based \non five-year development plans, the provinces prepare and submit annual implementation plans \nfor transport projects to MCTPC, which then submits those to the State Planning Committee for \napproval.  \n5.  The Department of Roads within MCTPC is responsible for administering, planning, \nconstructing, and maintaining national roads and assisting the provinces with implementing road \nimprovement and maintenance programs. The permanent staff assigned to the Department of \nRoads currently number 99, of whom 73 are professional and 26 technical or administrative. \nHowever, there are an additional 74 staff assigned to externally financed projects, making a \n ", "24  Appendix 3 \ntotal of 173. Of the seven divisions (including Local Roads) within the Department of Roads, the \nRoad Administration Division with 17 permanent staff is the main division dealing with road \nmaintenance, and responsibility for planning and disbursement of payments from the Road \nMaintenance Fund for national road maintenance. The Planning and Technical Division has 16 \nstaff. The Project Monitoring Division is expected to have 15 staff when fully established. \n6.  In recent years, MCTPC has been delegating responsibility for work to the provincial \ndivisions  of  communication,  transport,  post  and  construction  (DCTPC).  DCTPCs  form  the \nprovincial arms of MCTPC and are responsible both to central Government through the MCTPC \nand to the provincial administration. Staff of DCTPCs are appointed partly by MCTPC and partly \nby the provinces. Within the road sector the responsibilities of DCTPCs include the maintenance \nof  national  road  projects  within  each  province,  and  full  responsibility  for  construction, \nimprovement, and maintenance of district and provincial roads. The average number of DCTPC \nstaff in each province is 75. The resources and skill base in DCTPCs is somewhat less \ndeveloped and more variable than that found in MCTPC. However, the delegation process has \nincreased the ownership and involvement in the road sector at all levels, including districts and \nthe rural community.  \n3.  Vehicle Fleet and Traffic \n7.  The registered motor vehicle fleet in the Lao PDR in mid-2000 comprised 191,440 units: \n150,760 motorcycles/tricycles (79%) and 40,680 motor vehicles (Table A3.1). The average \nannual growth rate has been about 7% over the last 5 years. Throughout the Lao PDR, there is \na generally low level of traffic on national and provincial roads. With the exception of areas \naround Vientiane and Savannakhet, traffic levels on the national network are below 1,000 \naverage annual daily traffic, and on most sections below 500 average annual daily traffic. On \nprovincial roads, traffic levels are typically below 100 average annual daily traffic. \nTable A3.1: Registered Vehicles \nThree  Large \n  Motorcycles  Wheelers  Car  Pickup  Jeep  Bus  Bus  Truck  Total \n1985  40,701  832  5,153  5,422  957  423  1,498  4,795  59,781 \n1990  57,878  897  5,730  5,983  1,090  473  1,625  6,236  79,912 \n1995  104,879  3,833  7,588  9,855  2,103  962  1,673  7,714  138,607 \n1999  143,846  4,235  8,461  13,764  3,828  1,630  1,760  9,517  187,041 \n2000  146,507  4,235  8,789  14,294  3,980  1,863  1,790  9,982  191,440 \nSource: Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction. \n8.  All passenger transport service providers in the Lao PDR have been privatized except \nfor  Vientiane  Municipal  Transport. The fare structure for urban, interurban, municipal, and \nprivate association services is based on the following criteria: (i) where kilometer costs exist, \nthese are used to provide a cost per trip with fares fixed on the basis of a 90% load factor to \nachieve profitability; and (ii) where kilometer costs are not available, actual and estimated costs \nfor return journeys are used and fares based on minimum number of passengers required to \ncover costs. Thus, fares are based on road condition and distance, with higher fares charged for \nservices over poor roads. Although the DCTPCs are required to approve fare structures and \ntend to equalize fares across operators, the quality of roads traveled is the most important \nconsideration in transport costs. \n ", "Appendix 3     25 \n4.  Road Sector Revenues and Expenditures \n9.  The road sector receives funding from a number of sources: government funding from \nthe consolidated fund, road charges, grants (both bilateral and multilateral agencies), soft loans \nfrom multilateral agencies, agreements with private interest groups, and commercial loans. The \nJune 2000 budget document released by the Ministry of Finance indicates a budget for MCTPC \nincluding provincial expenditures of KN700 billion for FY2000 (approximately $74 million). \n10.  The Department of Planning and Budget handles accounting and financial matters of \nMCTPC, with all transactions passing through the Department of Roads regardless of source. \nThe Department of Roads is the largest office in MCTPC and accounts for 90% of the MCTPC \nbudget. Currently, finance and accounting for projects is located in the Disbursement Division of \nDepartment of Roads. Financial and accounting systems in MCTPC and the DCTPCs are being \nimproved to provide functional and reliable budget expenditure reporting and accountancy. The \nDepartment of Roads has reviewed and agreed to adopt the recommendations proposed under \nthe Lao-Swedish Road Sector Project 1 to meet the long-term objective of establishing a \nuniform financial and accounting system that includes all sources of funding and consolidates \nDCTPC  accounting  in  MCTPC.  The  system  complies  with  generally  accepted  accounting \nprinciples, and government and MCTPC regulations and procedures. \n5.  Maintenance \n11.  The Government\u2019s goal and strategy is to give highest priority to routine and periodic \nmaintenance of the existing road network and to progressively increase the level of funding in \nthese areas. A key part of this strategy was the establishment in 2001 of the Road Maintenance \nFund, under the World Bank\u2019s road maintenance project, to provide funding for maintenance of \nnational and local roads. Except for 10% of its revenues, the Road Maintenance Fund will only \nfinance  maintenance  for  national  roads  until  sufficient  resources  are  available  to  meet \nrequirements for these roads. World Bank projections estimate that this will be in 2005. The \nmain source of revenue for the Road Maintenance Fund is a levy on fuel. Additional revenue will \nbe generated from heavy vehicle surcharge, road charges, and transit charges. The Road \nMaintenance Fund Advisory Board determines the application of funds to maintenance work. \nThe Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency is supporting the maintenance of \nrural roads under the ongoing project.  \n12.  The  Road  Maintenance  Fund  will  allocate  funds  based  on  reports  from  a  road \nmaintenance management system. These reports will be based on data on road conditions \ninput by provincial DCTPCs with each proposed periodic maintenance subproject ranked in \nterms of economic return. The selection of periodic maintenance subprojects will be based on \nlocation,  type  of  works,  cost  estimates,  and  economic  analysis  based  on  the  Highway \nDevelopment Maintenance model. \n6.  Axle Load Control \n13.  In December 1999, the Government signed the Association of South East Asian Nation \nTransit Traffic Agreement, in which maximum gross vehicle weights were set at approximately \n9.1 ton axle load equivalent, with optional lower limits to be declared officially. Currently, \nMCTPC is implementing a heavy transport management program. The main activities under this \nprogram comprise review of existing regulations, enforcing regulations, providing equipment \n(weigh scales) and training and supporting a public information campaign. The World Bank is \nsupporting the formulation and implementation of a national strategy to reduce overloading \n ", "26  Appendix 3 \nunder its road maintenance project. This is in line with earlier Asian Development Bank project \ncomponents. \n7.  Road Safety \n14.  Road accident fatalities in the country have been rising sharply since 1991, with a 245% \nincrease between 1991 and 1999. Road accidents have also increased by 176%. Current \nfatality rates are the highest among the Southeast Asian countries at almost 20 persons per \n10,000 vehicles. The figure is growing and with the current rate of increase in vehicles, a \ngrowing population, and an improved road network, the potential for even greater accident rates \nis high. A draft national road safety strategy has been prepared that is built around five elements \n(i) education, (ii) enforcement, (iii) technical environment, (iv) coordination, and (v) research and \nevaluation. The strategy envisages implementation through a national road safety committee \nunder MCTPC and the forging of a road safety partnership among the Traffic Police Department \nand the Department of Education. International nongovernment agencies such as Handicap \nInternational are supporting efforts to create a network to increase awareness of road safety \nissues and to address the trauma of road accidents. \nC.  Government Objectives and Priorities for the Roads Sector \n15.  The  Government  has  given  high  priority  to  the  improvement  of  the  road  transport \nsystem, principally to facilitate (i) movement of agricultural products from surplus to deficit \nareas, (ii) flow of consumer goods and agricultural inputs to rural areas, (iii) marketing and \nexport  of  cash  crops  and  other  produce,  and  (iv) effective  participation  in  regional  and \ninternational trade. The targets for physical infrastructure development include (i) completing the \nnational road network, including road links with Cambodia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and \nViet  Nam,  and  bridge  links  with  Thailand;  (ii) improving  the  provincial  road  network; \n(iii) upgrading  access  roads  to  the  central  part  of  Viet  Nam  to  facilitate  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s \ninternational trade through ports in Viet Nam; and (iv) establishing a sustainable maintenance \nsystem  to  preserve  the  country\u2019s  transport  infrastructure.  Infrastructure  development, \nparticularly  roads,  is  being  coordinated  closely  with  regional  cooperation  initiatives  being \ndeveloped under the ADB Greater Mekong Subregion initiative as the country is centrally \nlocated among Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n \n ", "Appendix 4  27 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN  \n1.  Scope of the Resettlement Plan. As part of the Project\u2019s preparation, a social \nanalysis was carried out along the entire project road. A census and inventory of lost assets \nwas carried out for all households potentially affected by loss of homestead land and \ndwellings within a 14-meter (m) wide corridor of impact (COI) in towns and villages and within \na  20-m  wide  COI  in  rural  areas.  Based  on  the  information  collected  for  this  COI,  a \nresettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  Project  in  compliance  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and the Handbook on \nResettlement: A Guide to Good Practice.  \n2.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement. For the present COI, the Project \nwould require land acquisition of 122 hectares of mainly rice land and 1.7 hectares of \nresidential land, affecting 2,550 people in 502 families, 543 dwellings, 61 small retail shops, \nand 133 rice storage bins, all of which would  need to be relocated. Also affected will be \ngardens, fishponds, and plantations. There will also be some temporary impact on land \nduring construction and disruption to irrigation systems, which will be restored. The exact \nalignment will be determined during detailed design, following which the amount of actually \naffected land, households, and assets will be identified and measured during the detailed \nmeasurement survey. If the scope of the Project is changed, the resettlement plan will be \nupdated; however, such change is not anticipated.  \n3.  Policy Framework and Entitlements. The policy framework and entitlements have \nbeen built upon the laws of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), principally the \nConstitution (1991) and the Land Law (1997), the draft National Resettlement Policy for All \nProjects in the Lao PDR, which will be the basis for a ministerial decree being drafted under \nthe ADB environmental and social program loan,1 ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement \n(1995),  and  government-approved  resettlement  plans  for  other  ADB  and  World  Bank \nprojects. Provisions and principles adopted in the resettlement plan for the Project supersede \nthe provisions of relevant decrees currently in force in the Lao PDR wherever a gap exists. \n4.  Project Principles. The following basic principles have been adopted for the Project: \n(i)  Acquisition  of  land  and  other  assets,  and  resettlement  of  people  will  be \nminimized as much as possible. \n(ii)  All affected persons (APs) will be identified in the project-impacted areas at a \nyet to be determined cutoff date, and will be covered under the resettlement \nmeasures  sufficient  to  assist  them  to  improve  or  at  least  maintain  their \npreproject living standards, income-earning capacity, and production levels.  \n(iii)  APs will not be required to have formal legal title to the land used by them to \nbe eligible for compensation and rehabilitation measures.  \n(iv)  APs will be provided with full replacement costs so as to enable them to have \na house or a structure of the same size and standard; agricultural land for land \nof equal productive capacity acceptable to the AP; replacement of residential \nand commercial land of equal size acceptable to the  AP; and transfer and \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2001.

In cases where sufficient \nreplacement land is not available in villages, the Project will assist the villages \nto  develop  new  rice  land.  The  Project  will  also  assist  villages  to  level \nresidential sites and sites for livestock and fishponds. Villages will be provided \nwith land titles for their existing and replacement land in due course. \n(vi)  Temporarily affected land and community infrastructure will be restored to \npreproject conditions. \n(vii)  The compensation and resettlement activities will be satisfactorily completed \nand rehabilitation measures will be in place before commencement of civil \nworks. \n(viii)  The Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction (MCTPC) \nwill see to it that institutional arrangements are in place to ensure effective and \ntimely  design,  planning,  consultation,  and  implementation  of  the  land \nacquisition, compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation program. \n(ix)  Existing  cultural  and  religious  practices  shall  be  respected  and,  to  the \nmaximum extent practical, preserved. \n(x)  Special  measures  have  been  incorporated  in  the  resettlement  plan  and \ncomplementary  social  action  plan  to  protect  socially  and  economically \nvulnerable groups such as ethnic minority peoples, women-headed families, \nchildren and elderly people without support structures, and people  living in \nextreme poverty. \n(xi)  There  will  be  effective  mechanisms  for  hearing  and  resolving  grievances \nduring the implementation of the resettlement plan. \n5.  Entitlement  Matrix.  The  project  entitlements  have  been  designed  to  provide \ncompensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation for lost assets and to restore the livelihoods of \nall categories of APs. The entitlement matrix for the Project (Table A4) summarizes the main \ntypes of losses and the support entitled for each type of loss. Compensation for structures \nwill be calculated at full replacement cost at current market value, based on a competent \ntechnical  survey.  Structures  that  cannot  be  moved  will  be  compensated  at  their  full \nreplacement cost of labor and materials to build a new structure. Movable structures will be \nassessed for their ability to be moved. If APs agree that the structure can be moved, \nassistance  will  be  provided  to  cover  the  full  replacement  costs  of  site  preparation, \ndismantling, moving, and rebuilding the structures. \n ", "Appendix 4  29 \nTable A4: Summary Entitlement Matrix \nType of \nEntitled Persons  Compensation  ImplementationIissues \nLoss \n       \nDwellings  Registered  Full replacement cost so as to  Stakeholder consensus on \ntaxpayer or  enable affected persons to have a  replacement value assessment \noccupant identified  dwelling of the same size and \nduring survey  standard \n       \nResidential  Registered  Replacement land if relocating to  Stakeholder consensus on \nland  taxpayer or  another site or compensation in  suitability of replacement land \noccupant identified  cash at replacement cost for \nduring survey  households who can move back to \nexisting site \n       \nExpenses  Registered  Lump sum payment sufficient to  Stakeholder consensus on \nof  taxpayer or  cover all relocation costs as agreed  definitions  \nresidential  occupant identified  with the affected person \nrelocation  during survey \n       \nRice  Owner identified  Lump sum payment sufficient to  Assessment of suitability of \nstorage bins  during survey  cover all relocation costs as agreed  relocation sites \nwith the affected person \n       \nSmall retail  Owner identified  Lump sum payment sufficient to  Review of shop recorded during \nshops  during survey  cover all relocation costs as agreed  survey \nwith the affected person \n       \nAgricultural  Owner or person  Replacement land of comparable  Stakeholder consensus on \nland   with use rights  yield  suitability of replacement land \nidentified during \nsurvey \n       \nCrops and  Owner or person  Full compensation of anticipated  Consensus among stakeholders \ntrees  with customary use  harvest at market value  on valuation assessment  \nrights \nCommon  Community losing  (i) Restoration of affected   \nproperty  the resources  community buildings and structures \nresources  to at least previous condition; or \n(ii) Replacement in areas identified \nin consultation with affected \ncommunities and relevant \nauthorities; \n(iii) Full compensation for loss of \nincome.  \nTemporary  Owner or person  (i) Extreme care by contractors to   \nimpact  with use rights  avoid damaging property. \nduring  identified during  (ii) Where damages do occur, the \nconstruction  survey  contractor will be required to pay \ncompensation immediately to \naffected families, groups, \ncommunities or government \nagencies. \n(iii) Damaged property will be \nrestored immediately to its former \ncondition. \nSource: ADB. 2002.

Land acquisition impacts and rehabilitation measures have \nbeen assessed at the individual and community levels. During the detailed design, every \neffort will be made to reduce the need for relocation and rice land. Households will be \nassisted to move back from the road. For households that have to move, the Project will \nassist communities and households by leveling new land for house plots and livestock pens, \nfencing for livestock and vegetable gardens, and guiding village planning, expanding rice \nland, and establishing fishponds. Villages will be assisted to fence the roadsides to prevent \nchildren and livestock from wandering onto the road. The Project will also provide improved \nmultipurpose water supply, following a village needs assessment.  \n7.  Income Rehabilitation. The Project includes several income restoration programs as \npart of the resettlement plan and Social Action Plan. The Project will include assistance for \nrice land preparation, digging of fish ponds, training in literacy, numeracy, and business and \nmarketing skills to take advantage of small businesses and trade opportunities. \n8.  Participation  in  Resettlement  Planning  and  Implementation  and  Grievance \nMechanism. There was an extensive consultative process during the social analysis and \nresettlement  planning  period  of  the  feasibility  study.  Resettlement  planning  and  \nimplementation will follow a participatory approach using facilitators to mobilize the affected \ncommunities  to  participate  in  alignment  selection,  inventory  of  losses,  validation  of \ncompensation rates and entitlements, delivery of entitlements, design and delivery of the \nsocial action plan, monitoring of impacts and benefits, and design and participation in a \ngrievance redressal mechanism. \n9.  Disclosure. Key information on the resettlement plan is disclosed to the affected \ncommunities through an information brochure. Three Project information centers, one in each \ndistrict, have been established. The summary of the resettlement plan has been put on \nADB\u2019s web site. \n10.  Institutional  Arrangements. At the national level, the environmental and social \ndivision of the Department of Roads will be strengthened to provide overall guidance and \ntechnical support to the provincial and district resettlement committees. The environment and \nsocial units at provincial levels will also be established under the Project. Provincial, district, \nand village resettlement committees will be established. Village resettlement committees will \nactively participate in design and implementation of the resettlement plan and social action \nplan.  \n11.  Monitoring of Resettlement Plan Implementation and Impacts. Monitoring of the \nland acquisition process will be conducted independently of the MCTPC by a local qualified \nagency. \n12.  Implementation Schedule. All resettlement activities will be coordinated with the civil \nworks schedule. The Government and ADB will ensure that demolition and construction will \nnot begin unless the Government has completed satisfactorily and in accordance with the \napproved resettlement plan compensation payments and relocation of APs to new sites. \n \n ", "Appendix 5  31 \nSUMMARY SOCIAL ACTION PLAN \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The Northern Economic Corridor (the Project) passes through about 90 villages, all \nexcept one, are ethnic minority villages. Whereas the resettlement plan is designed to mitigate \nimpacts from land acquisition, the social action plan (SAP) is designed to enhance project \nbenefits to the communities along the road. The SAP serves as an ethnic minority development \nplan required under the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  Policy on Indigenous Peoples. The \nSAP has been prepared in full consultation with ethnic minority people along the road.  \nB.  Legal Framework \n2.  A series of recent laws and decisions reflect increasing awareness of the Government of \nthe Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) on the need to incorporate the concerns of \nethnic minorities in development process in all sectors. The Department of Ethnic and Social \nAffairs of the Lao Front for National Construction is responsible for coordinating ethnic minority \nissues at the central government level and developing and implementing policies toward ethnic \nminorities and the mountainous regions. The Resolution of the Party Central Organization \nConcerning Ethnic Minority Affairs in the New Era (1991) mandated all government agencies to \ncreate a targeted plan for the development of rural, mountainous area. The National Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan for 2001\u20132005 has adopted as its objective the alleviation of \npoverty for ethnic minorities in remote areas and forestry laws recognize customary land use \nrights.  \nC.  Baseline Data \n3.  A primary social feature of the Project is the high degree of ethnic diversity found in the \npopulation along the road. To date, at least 16 ethnic groups, belonging to four ethno-linguistic \nfamilies, have been identified along the project road (Table A4.1). In Louang Namtha province \n97.7% of the population are ethnic minorities, whereas in Bokeo province, the proportion of the \npopulation who are ethnic minorities is 86.6%. The majority of the populations are rural, living in \nvillages of about 100 to 1,000 people. Agriculture is the primary economic activity, with much of \nit at a subsistence level. \nTable A4.1: Languages Spoken in the Northern Economic Corridor \nLanguage Family  Branch of Language Family \nTai-Kadai  Southwestern  Northern \n  Lao, Leu, Kalom, Nyouan, Tai Dam  Nhang (Yay)a \nAustroasiatic  Khmuic  Palaungic \n  Khmou, Khmou Ou, Kwen, Ngouan  Sam Tao, Lamet, Bit \nTibeto-Burmese  Lolo-Burmese   \n  Southern Loloish  Central Loloish \n  Panna  Lahu Shi (Kui) \nHmong-Mien  Kim Moun (Lanten), Hmong \na Names in parentheses are the terms more commonly used by outsiders.  \n ", "32  Appendix 5 \nD.  Land Tenure \n4.  Since 1997, the Land Law has provided the primary legal basis for the Land-Forest \nAllocation Program. The Land-Forest Allocation Program was originally conceived as a way of \npreventing illegal logging by provincial and district entrepreneurs by giving villagers ownership \nof forest resources through a process of participatory land use planning. However, the original \nintention became diluted through the intervention of the program to reduce shifting cultivation \nand through the rural development approach of bringing villages to services (as opposed to \ntaking services to villages), which involved village relocation and consolidation. Land-forest \nallocation is premised on the lowland notion that permanent agriculture comprises only paddy \ncultivation, gardens, orchards, and plantations. These are not subject to reallocation since they \nare classed as permanent and land title is given automatically, provided it can be verified by \nlocal  authorities.  Swidden  farming,  on  the  other  hand,  is  considered  impermanent  and  is \ntherefore  the  target  of  the  national  goal  to  \u201creduce  shifting  cultivation\u201d.  The  Land-Forest \nAllocation Program issues temporary land certificates to upland farms only if they meet the \n\u201cpermanent\u201d criteria. \n5.  In principle, obtaining land use rights under the Land-Forest Allocation Program begins \nwith the issuance of a temporary land use certificate that is valid for 3 years. At the end of the \nperiod, if land is used as specified, a land title for long-term use may be requested. It may be \ninherited, sold, and leased according to land registration procedures and land tax payment \nrequirements. Land-forest allocation is a government policy designed to assist villages with \nhigh-quality land use planning and titling; however, implementation has often not followed the \npolicy and has caused severe hardship for many swidden cultivators. The worst problem has \nbeen reduction of fallow periods to 3\u20134 years from the original fallow cycles of an average of 15 \nyears and longer. Adequate \u201cpermanent\u201d livelihood substitutes have not been successful. Most \nfamilies are given paddy land that cannot be cultivated due to poor soils or lack of water. \nSuitable paddy land, especially in mountainous zones, is not enough to meet the needs of the \nprogram, and technical assistance is not readily available to support either paddy or permanent \nupland cropping.  \n6.  Rights of women with respect to land titling include the right of certification and the right \nof inheritance of lands and other assets. Although a considerable proportion of inheritance \naccrues to women, only a fraction of this is registered in the name of the wife, notwithstanding \nthe fact that males and females have equal right under the Land Law of the Lao PDR. The low \nlevel of women\u2019s registration is attributed to (i) lack of knowledge of ownership rights on the part \nof women; (ii) cultural reluctance on the part of women; (iii) low levels of female literacy and \neducation, particularly in the remote rural areas; and (iv) lack of capacity and awareness of \ngender issues on the part of the certifying officers. \n7.  The World Bank is financing a land-titling project to assist the Government with its land-\ntitling program. This project does not include Louang Namtha or Bokeo provinces, although \ndialogue is ongoing with the government to consider extending it to the project area. This would \nenable all households in the project villages to be issued with land titles on a priority basis. The \nWorld Bank land-titling project is also addressing constraints to land registration facing women. \n ", "Appendix 5  33 \nE.  HIV/AIDS/STD1 and Trafficking \n8.  Official data on blood tests for HIV/AIDS indicate increasing levels of incidence: the \nnumber of deaths from HIV/AIDS has also increased from 72 between 1990 and 2000 to 24 in \n2001 alone.2 A recent study by CARE International\u2019s STD Training and Education Materials \nProject in Louang Prabang and Oudomxay suggests that outreach program should focus more \non \u201cat risk\u201d populations groups, namely female traders, truck drivers, male government officials, \ncommercial sex workers, and ethnic minorities.3 The Project may lead to negative impacts in \nterms of higher exposure of local population to HIV/AIDS and STD, both during construction \nperiod and in the medium-term. The SAP therefore includes an awareness program, aimed at \npreventive measures for the target groups.  \n9.  Human trafficking is on the rise in Asia as people flee poverty and conflict. Better \ntransport and communication links contribute to the problem. According to a recent study by the \nSwedish Government, human trafficking ranks third, (after drugs and arms smuggling), in the \nscale of organized crime. Women and children are the most vulnerable. They are used for \ncommercial sex, domestic labor, and construction work. Children are also in demand for factory \nor farm work or in the entertainment sector. Trafficking amounts to a gross violation of human \nrights and hampers the struggle to end poverty and gender inequality in Asia. One effective way \nto reduce the degrading trade is to address the factors that render women and children \nvulnerable. The SAP proposes prevention through mass and targeted campaigns to address the \nrisk of trafficking of women and children. \nF.  Development Activities \n10.  The overall strategy for the SAP is to develop a strong social and economic base upon \nwhich communities, the Government, and development assistance programs can build in future. \nThe focus will be on the communities in greatest need of coping skills to respond to the \nopportunities  presented  by  an  all-weather  road.  The  design  and  implementation  of  all \ncomponents  of  the  SAP  will  be  done  following  a  participatory  approach  during  project \nimplementation using facilitators for identification of community needs and appropriate design of \nSAP activities. The SAP will address the special needs of the ethnic minority women by \nspecifically  targeting  ethnic  minority  women  and  girls  in  the  participatory  design  and \nimplementation of all components. The SAP will include the following activities to be undertaken \nin the communities along the road. \n1.  Community Roads \n11.  An amount of $1.6 million is allocated for the construction of community roads along the \nproject road. The various road segments are to be selected based on a participatory process \ninvolving the communities and the provincial authorities. This participatory process will be \nguided by consultants engaged as part of the project coordination team. The consultants will \nprepare and submit a justification report to ADB and the Government of Lao PDR for the \nselected roads based on the following criteria: (i) the roads will be selected using a community-\nbased participatory approach; (ii) the roads will not be widened to more than 3.5 meters; (iii) no \n                                                 \n1  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome/sexually transmitted disease. \n2  Official data from NCCA, dated 22 March 2002. \n3   CARE International in Lao PDR.

Water Supply and Sanitation Schemes \n12.  The Project will support the Lao PDR\u2019s Strategy for the National Water Supply and \nEnvironmental Health Program, led by the National Centre for Environmental Health and Water \nSupply (Nam Saat). The long-term goal of this strategy is that every rural person of the Lao \nPDR has access to safe and adequate water supply and sanitation facilities and lives in a \nhygienic environment. The World Bank water and sanitation program has been supporting this \nstrategy in Louang Namtha Province since 1994. The World Bank\u2019s direct project support will \ncome to an end in December 2002; however, the non-project support to Nam Saat will continue. \nThe project has built considerable capacity within Nam Saat and Louang Namtha Division of \nCommunication,  Transport,  Post  and  Construction  for  rural  water  supply,  sanitation,  and \nhygiene. Nam Saat is now seeking funding to continue their project work of providing water \nsupply and sanitation to the remaining people of Louang Namtha province. Nam Saat Bokeo \nprovince  is  receiving  funding  and  technical  assistance  from  the  Swedish  International \nDevelopment Cooperation Agency to carry out their program in Bokeo. As a part of the SAP, the \nProject will support Nam Saat at the central level and in the provinces of Louang Namtha and \nBokeo so as to provide access to safe and adequate water supply and sanitation facilities and \nenhance  awareness.  Nam  Saat  together  with  the  Department  of  Health,  will  be  the \nimplementing agency for this component of SAP. The Division of Communication, Transport, \nPost and Construction will be responsible for overall coordination. Nam Saat, Louang Namtha \nwill recruit a local consultant to provide technical assistance whereas Swedish International \nDevelopment Cooperation Agency\u2019s technical expert will continue to assist Nam Saat in Bokeo. \nProvincial and district coordination teams already exist and comprise of the Department of \nEducation,  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  and  Youth  Union,  Urban  Water  Supply  Department,  Rural \nDevelopment Committee, and Nam Saat. \n13.  Nam Saat Louang Namtha will be asked to take the lead in preparation of the proposal \ntogether with Nam Saat Bokeo, and with guidance from Nam Saat at the central level. The \nWorld Bank has offered to finance the costs of the proposal preparation if so requested by Nam \nSaat and ADB. The proposal would be based on a needs and demand assessment for the \nvillages along the project road that do not yet have water supply and sanitation schemes, and \nwould include an awareness program. The selection of villages to benefit from water and \nsanitation schemes would be based on the following criteria: (i) the villages will be selected \nusing  a  community-based  participatory  approach;  (ii) arrangements  will  be  in  place  for \ncommunity-based  maintenance;  (iii) construction  of  the  schemes  will  avoid  displacing  or \nadversely  affecting  villages  or  individual  homesteads/  agricultural  production  areas,  and  if \ndisplacement is essential, appropriate compensation measures will be applied in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  consistent  with  the  resettlement  plan \nprepared  for  the  Project;  and  (iv) construction  of  the  schemes  will  avoid  environmental \ndegradation. \n ", "Appendix 5  35 \n3.

This subcomponent will consist of \nthe development and delivery of a road safety awareness and education program activities such \nas (i) enforcement of construction safety standards during construction period; (ii) installation of \nappropriate  signs  warning  drivers  to  slow  down  in  settled  areas;  (iii)  establishment  and \nenforcement of speed limits; (iv) road safety education for rural children and awareness in \ncommunities; and (v) construction of roadside fences as necessary to discourage livestock and \nsmall children from stepping into the roadway, as is done already in some roadside villages in \nBokeo province. \n4.  Pilot Project for Community Development in the Nam Ha Watershed \n17.  A Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction project4 is proposed to be undertaken as a pilot in \nnine villages in the Nam Ha Watershed (seven villages in Viangphoukha district and two villages \nin Namtha district). From the perspective of Government, the major issues facing the population \nand target area are secured livelihood and increased economic capacity for communities, while \nconserving and protecting the national biodiversity conservation area watershed and remaining \nforest. Therefore, this project concept has been developed to assist these communities to \ncontinue the development of sustainable and permanent land use systems of agriculture and \nforestry that will enable them to avoid an ever-increasing scale of swidden agricultural practice \nwith associated negative environmental and economic impacts. The project aims to maximize \nthe stability and productivity of agriculture while developing an agro-forestry component that will \nensure longer-term income and food security and actually increase the level of forest cover for \n                                                 \n4  The proposed project was appraised between 31 August and 14 September 2002. \n ", "36  Appendix 5 \nwatershed protection, wild life habitat, and local and national income.

Institutional Capacity \n18.  Within the central Government, the lead coordinating agency for ethnic minority issues is \nthe Lao Front for National Construction and its Department of Ethnic and Social Affairs helps the \nGovernment develop and implement policies toward ethnic minorities and the mountainous \nregions. The national level Central Leading Committee for Rural Development and provincial \nrural  development  committees  and  rural  development  offices  oversee  rural  development. \nDesign and implementation of the various components of the SAP will be undertaken by locally \nrecruited  consultants  in  coordination  with  the  local  agencies.  Institutional  capacity  will  be \nassessed during the participatory needs assessment during project implementation and on-the-\njob assistance for design and implementation will be provided to these agencies. \nH.   Monitoring \n19.  MCTPC  will  recruit  an  independent  local  consulting  agency  or  locally  based  non-\ngovernmental organization to monitor and evaluate the implementation and impacts of the SAP. \nMonitoring and evaluation will involve the participation of the project communities. \n \n ", "Appendix 6  37 \nDETAILED PROJECT COST ESTIMATES \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \n       \nA.

Civil Works Procurement \n2.  Procurement of all civil works contract will be in accordance with the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) Guidelines for Procurement. The proposed packaging and mode of procurement of \nthe civil works contracts is as follows: \n(i)  ADB-Financed Section of the Project Road. Bidding will follow international \ncompetitive bidding procedures for a  Design-Build (Turnkey) Contract and the \ncontractor will be selected from prequalified bidders. \n(ii)  Toll Collection. Bidding will follow local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures. \nThe facilities to be procured under this contract will include the construction of toll \nplazas and checkpoints, and the provision of associated equipment. As these \n ", "40  Appendix 8 \nplazas and checkpoints will be  small scale and will be constructed at various \nlocation along the Project Road, it is not expected that this work will be attractive \nto international contractors.  \n(iii)  Community  Infrastructure\u2013Community  Roads.  Bidding  will  follow  LCB \nprocedures. As the roads to be constructed under this component are small \nscale, the nature of the work and the size of the contracts will not be attractive to \ninternational contractors. \n(iv)  Community Infrastructure\u2013Water and Sanitation Schemes. The civil works for \nthe water and sanitation schemes under the Social Action Plan will be carried out \nby qualified local contractors, selected and engaged in accordance with the \nBank's Guidelines for Procurement  by the provincial offices of the Division of \nPublic Health.  \nB.  Recruitment of Consultants \n3.

Shortlisted  firms  will  be  required  to  demonstrate  experience  of \nconstruction supervision of major international roads in remote areas. \n(ii)  Package 2: Resettlement Planning, Implementation, and Capacity-Building \nConsultants.  Recruitment  for  this  package  of  services  will  be  based  on \nprocedures  for  the  recruitment  of  individual  consultants.  This  procedure  is \njustified as the implementation schedule indicates that civil works contracts will \nbe awarded for the People\u2019s Republic of China and Thailand funded portions of \nthe project road before the consultants under package 1 can be recruited. As \nresettlement activities must commence in advance of the award of civil works \ncontracts, the period of time available to complete the recruitment of these \nconsultants is very short. In addition to the above, as the project passes through \na region of ethnic and cultural sensitivity there is a need to ensure that the \nresettlement plan is implemented in a manner that is complementary to the local \ncultural and ethnic environment. Therefore, recruitment of the consultants for this \nwork must ensure that the individuals have extensive experience of working on \nsocial projects within the context of Lao culture and ethnicity. \n(iii)  Package 3: Social Action Plan. Recruitment for this package of services will be \nbased on QCBS procedures for international recruitment with simplified technical \nproposals.  Shortlisted  firms  will  be  required  to  demonstrate  that  they  have \nexperience of (a) the design of effective awareness and prevention programs, \nand (b) implementing these programs within the Lao cultural and ethnic context.  \n(iv)  Package 4: Environment Management Plan.

Over 17% of the Northern \nRegion\u2019s poor reside in the three districts through which the road passes through. Namtha and Viangphoukha are \nranked among the most vulnerable districts in the country by the World Food Program. The majority of the poor are \nethnic minorities with a high dependence on subsistence agriculture with limited access to markets and social \nservices. The population is vulnerable to adverse external shocks, especially natural disasters, for which coping \nstrategies include high risk opium cultivation, collection of nontimber forest products, and sale of livestock (dissaving).  \n \nThe Project is expected to lead to economic transformation from subsistence to commercial activities in the project \narea and enhance regional integration of the northern area into the main economy. This will reduce livelihood \ndependence on subsistence agriculture, opium production, and natural resources by facilitating livelihood \nalternatives, risk diversification, access to markets, and off-farm employment opportunities. Whereas the improved \nroad access will not alone reduce poverty and vulnerability, it will facilitate the ability of the Government to provide \nhealth, veterinary, and educational services in the area. Improved road access will also enhance cost-effectiveness \nand poverty targeting for the provision of social services (and reduce the opportunity cost of providing such services) \nand development programs.  \nC.

Introduction \n1.  The economic viability analysis examined the contribution of the Project to the Lao \nPeople\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  and  the  subregion  as  a  whole,  comprising  the \neconomies of the People's Republic of China (PRC), Lao PDR and Thailand. The analysis \nincludes only direct savings in transportation costs: value-added from better transportation \nlinkages resulting in new investments or employment generation is not quantified. The economic \nanalysis considered the economic cost and benefits of the Project over the construction period \nand a 30-year operation period. Costs and benefits are valued at 2002 border prices using a \nworld price numeraire.  \nB.  Traffic Forecast \n2.  Vehicle count surveys were conducted in March 2002 to establish the base year average \ndaily traffic (ADT). The Project Road has experienced high growth of traffic estimated at more \nthan 20% per annum compared to 1997. The vehicle count and user surveys were used for \nmaking the traffic forecast along the Project Road.  \nTable A11.1: Average Daily Traffic by Vehicle Type, \u2013 March 2002 \n  Road Sections \n  Boten- VPK- Houayxay-\nNatuay  Natuay-LN  LN-VPK  Houayxay  River \n18-Wheelers  3  0  0  3  5 \n10-Wheelers Lignite  0  0  0  90  0 \n10-Wheelers Non- lignite  17  12  6  6  129 \n6- Wheelers  12  14  7  15  41 \nBus (45-seater)  8  5  2  2  2 \nBus (25-seater)  14  16  3  3  2 \nPick-up  22  42  23  141  260 \nLN = Louang Namtha; VPK = Viangphoukha. \nSource: ADB. 2002. Draft Final Report for Preparing the Northern Economic Corridor for the Lao PDR. Manila. \n3.  Forecasts for the future traffic were made for the following types of traffic: (i) normal (or \nexisting) traffic; (ii) generated traffic; and (iii) land-bridge traffic. Normal traffic refers to the \nexisting traffic using the Project Road, inclusive of passenger, commodity, and lignite traffic \nmovements.1 Generated traffic refers to the traffic that will be developed in future as a function \nof the reduced production costs arising from lower transport costs in the subregion. Land- bridge \ntraffic refers to the regional traffic, largely between Thailand and the Yunnan Province, PRC \ndiverted  from  other  transport  modes  and  new  traffic  that  will  be  facilitated  due  to  better \ninfrastructure linkages between these two growing economies. Land-bridge traffic is a term used \nto distinguish induced from generated traffic and is meant to reflect how the Project Road will \nserve as a land-bridge between Yunnan Province, PRC, the Lao PDR, and Thailand. \n4.  Normal traffic forecasts were prepared based on past income growth, trends in numbers \nof tourist arrivals at border crossings with Thailand and the PRC, and vehicle registration growth \n                                                 \n1  Lignite traffic refers to the traffic for the transport of lignite from mines that use certain sections of national route 3. \nTraffic volume is assumed constant over the entire project life. \n ", "Appendix 11  49 \nin the northern Lao PDR. Generated traffic was estimated as 60% of normal traffic, starting from \nthe base year and growing at the same rates as existing traffic with a five-year phasing allowed \nfor  both  generated  and  land-bridge  traffic  to  fully  develop.  Land-bridge  traffic  growth  is \nestimated based on growth of passenger travel between Yunnan Province and Thailand, the \ngrowth of trade between northern Thailand and Yunnan Province, regional development plans \nfor these two areas, and growth in river traffic. On the land-bridge forecasts, traffic crossing from \nthe PRC border has grown at the rate of 28% per annum since 1995: in 2001, 44,000 vehicles \nor 120 ADT equivalent crossed the Mohen border to enter the  Lao  PDR.  There  are  two \nimportant  border  crossings  with  Thailand:  trade  between  Thailand  and  Lao  PDR  at  the \nHouayxay border has more than doubled since 1995 growing at the rate of 19% per annum \nwhereas at the Chiang Sen border crossing, trade has increased from Baht42 million to Baht501 \nmillion during 1995-2001 with a compound growth rate of 51%. Once the road opens, this will be \nthe  most  important  link  for  this  trade  and  tourist  traffic.  In  addition  more  than  116,000 \npassengers crossed Houayxay border in 2001. Against this background, the traffic forecasts \nused for the analysis seem conservative (Table A11.2).  \nTable A11. 2: Annual Traffic Growth Rates by Vehicle and Traffic Type \n  Normal (%)  Generated (%)  Land\u2013Bridge (%) \n18-Wheelers  10%  10%   \n10-Wheelers Lignite  0%  0%   \n10-Wheelers Non-lignite  10%  10%  10%a \n6 Wheelers  5%  5%  10%a \nBus (45-seater)  10%  10%  10%a \nBus (25-seater)  7%  7%  10%a \nPick-up  5%  5%   \na Growth for initial few years, thereafter it slows down to 7%. \nC.  Vehicle Operating Costs \n5.  Actual economic vehicle operating costs were estimated for each of the predominant \ntypes of vehicles using the Project Road. Given the very bad condition of the road, impedance \nfactors were considered to be more appropriate measure rather than using roughness index to \nderive with and without project vehicle operating costs. Technical investigations were carried out \nto assess impedance factors2 for each of the major 13 links for each vehicle type to derive base \nvehicle operating costs. The  resulting with and without project vehicle operating costs were \nfound to be comparable with the vehicle operating cost estimates recently prepared for the rural \nroad  access  project  using  highway  development  model  III.  The  weighted  average  vehicle \noperating costs for the entire roads for each vehicle type are presented below (Table A11.3).  \nD.  Project Costs \n6.  Project costs consist of construction costs and civil works, project management and \nsupervision,  consulting  services  including  the  implementation  of  resettlement,  social  and \nenvironment management plans, physical contingencies, cost of road user charge collection, \n                                                 \n2  Impedance factors reflect the condition of the road on a specific link. It is an engineering estimate used to \ntransform actual link distance into equivalent distances that reflect the real cost of operating a vehicle on it. An \nimpedance factor of 5 represents an equivalent vehicle operating cost equal to the cost of driving five times farther \non a level tangent paved road. \n ", "50  Appendix 11 \nand routine and periodic maintenance of the Project Road with and without project. Civil works \ncost were derived from the draft feasibility report for the Project Road. The financial costs were \nconverted to economic costs by eliminating the effects of taxes and duties and by adjusting for \nthe price of traded and non-traded cost components. A standard conversion factor of 0.8 was \nused to convert the prices of non-traded goods. Detailed operations and maintenance costs \nwere estimated in economic terms for the without project and with project scenarios.  \nTable A11.3: Economic Vehicle Operating Costs \nWithout Project  With Project  \nVehicle Types \n (in KN1,000/km)  (in KN1,000/km) \n18-Wheelers  3.99  3.16 \n10-Wheelers Non-Lignite  2.05  1.33 \n6-Wheelers  1.37  0.86 \nBus (45-seater)  2.34  1.51 \nBus (25-seater)  1.91  1.11 \nPick-up  1.57  1.09 \nKN = kip. \nSource: ADB. 2002. Draft Final Report for Preparing the Northern Economic Corridor for the Lao PDR. Manila. \n \nE.  Project Benefits \n7.  A major benefit for the Lao PDR economy results from the improvement in vehicle \noperating costs for the local traffic and the revenue it derives from higher regional traffic from \nthe road charges. Benefits resulting from reduction in road accidents were not quantified. \nBenefits accruing to normal traffic were calculated as the difference between total user costs \nincurred by using the existing unpaved Project Road less the total costs incurred with the \nimproved Project Road. These differences in user costs accrue to the users of the road. \nBenefits accruing to generated traffic is taken as half of the actual vehicle operating cost \nsavings.  \n8.  For the land-bridge traffic, regional savings were estimated for the different types of \nvehicles for the freight depending on the alternative transport mode. The interviews carried out \nin the PRC and Thailand indicate that there is a large demand for a road link between northern \nThailand and Yunnan Province for freight traffic. In the absence of such a link, river traffic is \ngrowing even though the cost and time of using river are much higher. Alternative trip costs \nwere estimated to derive savings accruing to freight operators in Thailand and the PRC. These \nsavings, net of ferry costs and road charges provided the magnitude of savings for regional \ntraffic. For the passenger traffic, vehicle operating cost savings were used as a proxy for 'with\" \nand \"without\" project cases. The imputed savings are small compared to the actual potential \nbenefits in terms of travel time and actual costs incurred if they continued to use other modes of \ntravel or take journeys on the existing road. In addition, overall benefits also include savings in \ninventory costs as a result of savings in time. The trip on the Mekong River takes five 5 days at \npresent. It is estimated that road use will result in savings of inventory costs, especially for high \nvalue goods at the rate of $2 per ton. \nF.  Economic Analysis and Sensitivity  \n9.  The economic internal rate of return for the subregion is 27.0% and that for the Lao PDR \neconomy is 12.8% if only benefits of lower vehicle operating costs for local traffic were included. \nThe  Lao  PDR  economy  will  also  receive  large  revenue  from  the  road  charges  from  the \ninternational traffic and if these benefits are included, the EIRR for the Lao PDR is estimated at \n ", "Appendix 11  51 \n17.9%. The Project was found to be sensitive only with respect to volume of traffic. Detailed \nsensitivity analysis was carried out for different levels of traffic. The EIRR for the subregion is \nreduced to 18.4% if land-bridge traffic remains at one third of projected traffic. The switching \nvalue for capital cost is 190% increase (Table A11.4).  \nTable A11.4: Sensitivity Analysis \nItem  Subregional EIRR (%) Lao PDR EIRR (%) \nBase Case      \nBase case with toll charges  27.0%  17.9% \nBase case without toll charges  29.7%  12.8% \nBenefits     \n10% increase in land-bridge traffic  28.2%  18.3% \n10% decrease in land-bridge traffic  25.8%  17.5% \nNo landbridge traffic  n. a.   12.8% \n67% reduction in land-bridge traffic   18.4%  15.2% \n50% reduction in land-bridge traffic   20.8%  15.9% \nRoad charges     \nAssumed at $30 per ADT  28.9%  16.8% \nAssumed at $50 per ADT   27.4%  18.9% \nCosts     \n10% increase in capital costs  25.0%  16.6% \n10% decrease in capital costs  29.5%  19.5% \nADT = average daily traffic, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic. \nSource: Staff estimates. \nG.  Distribution Analysis  \n10.  The Project is a subregional project and hence it is important to assess distribution of \ncosts and benefits between different regional economies. Data for this was collected from \ninterviews  and  surveys  of  freight  forwarders,  passenger  buses,  customs  officials,  trade \nstatistics, and others. This information was used to determine shares of traffic origin for different \neconomies and between vehicle ownership patterns. Two types of distribution analysis were \ncarried out, distribution between economies and distribution within the Lao PDR by different \nfunctional groups. Results and sensitivity analysis for distribution between PRC, the Lao PDR, \nand Thailand are summarized below as follows: \n ", "52  Appendix 11 \nTable A11.5: Subregional Distribution Analysis, Net Present Value at @12% \n \nThailand  Lao PDR  PRC \n \n($ million)  ($ million)  ($ million) \nBase Case        \nBase case with toll charges  30.0  54.9  30.0 \nBase case without toll charges  47.5  20.4  46.9 \nBenefits       \n10% increase in land-bridge traffic  33.9  58.1  33.9 \n10% decrease in land-bridge traffic  26.2  51.8  26.2 \nRoad charges       \nAssumed at $30 per ADT  37.2  46.9  37.2 \nAssumed at $50 per ADT   22.7  62.9  22.7 \nCosts       \n10% increase in capital costs  28.2  52.2  28.4 \n10% decrease in capital costs  31.7  57.6  31.5 \nADT = average daily traffic, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China  \nSource: Staff estimates. \n11.  Second, functional distribution analysis between different groups within the Lao PDR \neconomy was also assessed following the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Guidelines for Economic \nAnalysis of the Projects. The benefits accruing to the Lao PDR were distributed between four \ngroups: consumers of transport services, private individuals and firms, labor, and government. \nThe consumers of transport services account for 35.2% of total benefits, private individuals and \nfirms that own transport services account for 57.4% of total benefits, labor 's share is 3.7%, and \ngovernment benefits 3.7%. The poverty impact ratio is 46%. Detailed cashflows are in Tables \n11.6 and 11.7. \nH.  Ferry versus Mekong River Bridge Crossing \n12.  It is possible that the ferry facilities to cross Mekong River will prove inadequate once the \ncross-border traffic grows beyond present levels. Economic analysis of construction of a bridge \nacross the Mekong River was carried out to assess viability of the additional investment. The \nbridge project was estimated to cost $20.5 million and would take four years to construct. The \nbridge project was found to have an EIRR of 16.1% for the Lao PDR economy. It was assumed \nthat the bridge would have a user charge of $5 per vehicle crossing, which is comparable to \nexisting charges on the Friendship Bridge.  \n13.  Compared to the river bridge option, the present ferry cost is $50 per vehicle crossing. \nHowever, these costs are considered excessive due to low traffic volumes and so the analysis \nof ferry is assumed to have a tariff of $10 per vehicle crossing. The existing ferry facilities are \ninadequate and would require a ramp in costs put in periodically. It is assumed that the first \nramp would cost $1.8 million, but subsequent costs will be lower for the next two ramps. After \nthat a new site will be needed at a cost of $1.8 million. The ferry crossing also involves on \naverage a wait of about 2 hours, in terms of loading and unloading as well as queuing time. \nSince the ferry and Mekong River bridge are mutually exclusive projects, net present values is \nthe correct decision criteria. The results indicate that the net present value of the ferry is $4.8 \nmillion whereas for the river bridge it is over $8.9 million. Thus the construction of a bridge \nacross the Mekong River is a viable option and would enhance the project viability for the Lao \nPDR and the subregional economies. \n ", " \nTable A11.6: Economic

Introduction \n1.  A financial analysis of the Project was carried out to determine the appropriate level of \nroad charges for regional traffic to cover debt service and road operations and maintenance \ncosts for the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). The financial internal rate of return \nfor the Project must at a minimum exceed the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the \nProject to remain affordable for the Lao PDR.  \nB.  Major Assumptions \n2.  For the purpose of this analysis, it has been assumed that construction will be carried \nout during 2003\u20132006 with an operating period of 30 years. No salvage value has been \nassumed. While the construction period will not end until 2006, revenue from road charges is \nassumed to commence in 2006 as major sections of the road will be constructed. The capital \ncost of the Project is estimated at $95.8 million. On the revenue side, the financial analysis \nassumes that a system of a road charge will be established for the international traffic at both \nborder crossings. Income taxes have not been included as the Project will be operated by the \nMinistry of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction (MCTPC) or other government \nagency, not subject to business or profit tax.  \n3.  The financial analysis assumes the same level of daily traffic data as contained in the \neconomic analysis for the international transit traffic. The projected traffic data indicate that land-\nbridge and diverted river traffic will increase at a moderate pace once the majority of the road \nupgrading has been completed. Lignite traffic is assumed to remain constant and would be \ncharged  a  concessional  transit  fee  of  approximately  $10  per  crossing  given  their  past \ninvestments in the road section covering Viangphoukha and Houayxay. The projected level of \ntraffic over the operating period is used to determine the average level of road charges that is \nrequired for the Government of the Lao PDR to service the debt. The average road charge \ncollected on the traffic in the initial years would be sufficient to meet debt service liabilities over \ntime and maintenance costs including repaving of the surface. \nC.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital  \n4.  WACC has been calculated based on estimated financing costs for the three loans from \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Government of Thailand, and the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The ADB loan is at the Asian Development Fund terms \nwhereas the Government of Thailand has provided 30-year maturity funds, including a 10-year \ngrace period and a 1.5% interest charge. About 10% of the principal is interest free, thus \nreducing the effective interest rate on the loan. The PRC has agreed to provide an interest-free \nloan of $30 million with a 20-year maturity, including a 10-year grace period. The PRC financing \nincludes a grant element of about 20% of the principal. The terms of the bilateral loans are thus \nmore concessional than the ADB. \n5.  The Government of the Lao PDR contribution (i.e., counterpart funds) can be considered \nas equity because the Government will retain residual revenue after the debt has been fully \nserviced. The cost of equity in the Lao PDR is not easy to define given its underdeveloped debt \nand capital markets. The opportunity cost of government counterpart funds in the Lao PDR, in \nreal terms, has been based on the US dollar savings rate offered by the Banque pour le \n ", "56  Appendix 12 \nCommerce Ext\u00e9erieur Lao at 6% for one year as the risk-free equity rate of return. Commercial \nbanks in the Lao PDR do not typically offer savings rates longer than one year. As there was \ninsufficient information to reflect the typical long-term cost of capital, the one-year savings rate \nhas been used. Four percent has been added to this risk-free rate as the appropriate premium, \nto reflect the volatile nature of inflation and financing using external currencies in the Lao PDR. \nAfter converting this US dollar nominal rate into real terms, the opportunity cost of counterpart \nfunds has been computed to be 7.42%. Therefore, the WACC for this Project is estimated at \n4.25%.  \nD.  Financial Analysis  \n6.  Based on these assumptions, the Project requires an average minimum road user \ncharge of approximately $40 per vehicle crossing from Thailand to Yunnan, the PRC. It is \nrecommended that 50% of the recommended charge be collected at each border crossing. This \nlevel of road user charge provides a financial internal rate of return of approximately 6.4%, \nwhich exceeds the projected WACC for the Project. \n7.  Discounting the future cash flows at the WACC of 4.25%, the financial net present value \nof the Project is $35.1 million.  The Government\u2019s return on its counterpart funds equals a \nfinancial internal rate of return of 22.9%. \nE.  Sensitivity Analysis \n8.  Sensitivity analysis for the Project was carried out to review viability under different \nscenarios, and included: (i) lower road charges; (ii) higher capital costs; and (iii) lower land \nbridge traffic. (Table A12.1).  \nTable A12.1: Sensitivity Analysis \nFNPV @ at \nVariable  FIRR   4.25%  Switching Value \nSensitivity Analysis on Project Risks  Change (%)  (%)  ($ million)  (FNPV, %) \nBase Case  n. a.  6.4%   35.1  n. a. \nRoad charges at $30 per ADT  -25%  4.6%   5.0   -30.0% \nIncrease in Capital Costs  +10%  5.8%   28.0   +48.0% \nReduced Land Bridge Traffic  -10%  5.7%   23.8   -35.0% \n \nADT = average daily traffic, FIRR = financial internal rate of return; FNPV = financial net present value. \n \n9.  These results indicate that the Project will be able to maintain its profitability assuming a \nreasonable level of risks. In adverse conditions beyond reasonable levels, financial viability can \nbe ensured by charging some road charges for local traffic crossing the border or increasing the \nlevels as long as these increases do not deter commercial traffic. \n \n ", " \nTable A12.2: Financial Internal Rate of Return \n        Toll  Road       \n  Capital Cost  International    Management  Maintenance  Total     \nYear  ($ million)  Transit Revenues  Toll Revenue  Costs  Costs  Revenue  Total Costs  Net Cash Flow \n2002  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00 \n2003  9.11  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  9.11  (9.11) \n2004  22.79  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  22.79  (22.79) \n2005  22.79  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  22.79  (22.79) \n2006  22.79  2.19  2.52  0.13  0.15  2.52  23.06  (20.54) \n2007  13.67  2.44  2.77  0.14  0.15  2.77  13.96  (11.19) \n2008  0.00  2.73  3.06  0.15  0.15  3.06  0.30  2.76 \n2009    3.02  3.35  0.17  0.15  3.35  0.31  3.04 \n2010    3.37  3.70  0.19  0.27  3.70  0.46  3.25 \n2011    3.74  4.07  0.20  0.27  4.07  0.47  3.59 \n2012    4.15  4.47  0.22  0.27  4.47  0.49  3.98 \n2013    4.61  4.94  0.25  0.27  4.94  0.52  4.42 \n2014    5.14  5.47  0.27  0.40  5.47  0.67  4.80 \n2015    5.68  6.01  0.30  0.40  6.01  0.70  5.31 \n2016    6.28  6.61  0.33  0.40  6.61  0.73  5.88 \n2017    6.76  7.09  0.35  0.40  7.09  0.75  6.34 \n2018    7.29  7.61  0.38  0.52  7.61  0.90  6.71 \n2019    7.83  8.15  0.41  0.52  8.15  0.93  7.23 \n2020    8.42  8.75  0.44  0.52  8.75  0.96  7.79 \n2021    9.05  9.38  0.47  0.52  9.38  0.99  8.39 \n2022    9.74  10.07  0.50  6.40  10.07  6.90  3.17 \n2023    10.48  10.81  0.54  6.40  10.81  6.94  3.87 \n2024    11.26  11.59  0.58  0.15  11.59  0.72  10.86 \n2025    12.07  12.40  0.62  0.15  12.40  0.77  11.64 \n2026    12.96  13.29  0.66  0.15  13.29  0.81  12.48 \n2027    13.93  14.26  0.71  0.27  14.26  0.98  13.27 \n2028    14.97  15.29  0.76  0.27  15.29  1.03  14.26 \n2029    16.03  16.36  0.82  0.27  16.36  1.09  15.27  A\n2030    17.18  17.51  0.88  0.40  17.51  1.27  16.24  pp\n2031    18.45  18.78  0.94  0.40  18.78  1.33  17.45  en\nd\n2032    19.78  20.11  1.01  0.40  20.11  1.40  18.71  ix\n2033    21.20  21.53  1.08  0.52  21.53  1.60  19.93   1\n2\n2034    22.73  23.06  1.15  0.52  23.06  1.67  21.39   \n2035    24.37  24.70  1.23  0.52  24.70  1.76  22.94 \n2036    26.13  26.46  1.32  0.15  26.46  1.47  24.99  5\n7\n               \nFinancial Internal Rate of Return  6.36% \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R331-02 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20021203144305", "Title": "R331-02", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 4.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20030127102533+08'00'"}}
