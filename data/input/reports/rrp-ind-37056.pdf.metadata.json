Initial environmental examinations were undertaken for \nsample core subprojects. An example is in Appendix 14. \n \nThe  Project  will  support  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \ndevelopment  for  the  Water  Resources  Department  (WRD)  of  the \nGovernment  of  Chhattisgarh  (GOCG).  The  Project  will  modernize \nskills  and  upgrade  existing  development  and  management \ncapabilities.  It  will  support  capacity  development  and  institutional \nstrengthening of water users associations (WUAs) that will assume \nresponsibility  for  irrigation  system  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M). \n \nThe  Project  will  undertake  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  (R&U)  of \n200\u2013300  minor  and  medium \nthroughout \nChhattisgarh  to  improve  irrigation  effectiveness  on  about  200,000 \nhectares. R&U will be implemented through a participatory process \nthat actively involves WUAs and will help them develop a sense of \nsystem ownership to facilitate their assumption of management and \nO&M  responsibility.  A  subcomponent  of  the  R&U  works  will  repair \nbroken  tank  sluice  gates,  so  that  the  tanks  will  be  able  to  store \nwater for irrigation.  \n \nIn  systems  that  have  received  R&U  works,  the  Project  will  assist \nWUAs develop field channels, prepare on-farm water management \nplans,  and  develop  rabi  cropping  (dry  season  and  usually  from \nDecember to March) and marketing plans. Throughout the life of the \nProject, support will be provided to WUAs to develop their skills and \nexperience needed for sustainable system O&M and rabi cropping. \n \nChhattisgarh  has  abundant  agricultural  land  and  rainfall,  but \nirrigated  agricultural  productivity  is  low.  Only  wet  season  rice  is \ngrown  in  most  areas  although  rabi  cropping  provides  a  high-value \nopportunity to improve the livelihood of many farmers with irrigation. \nIrrigation  system  performance  is  low,  however,  mainly  due  to \ninadequate  O&M.  The  need  to  improve  water  management  and \ndeficient  farm  practices  also  make  it  difficult  for  many  farmers  to \nengage  in  anything  but  low-value  rice  cultivation.  WUAs  were \nformed  in  1999  when  Chhattisgarh  was  part  of  Madhya  Pradesh \n(MP) under the MP Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) Act. \n\nirrigation  schemes \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \nObjectives \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\ntremendous  opportunities \n\nWUAs  have  the  opportunity  to  play  an  important  role  in  improving \nthe management and O&M of irrigation as well as provide an entry \npoint  for  delivery  of  agricultural  support  services,  but  they  need \ngreater  empowerment  and  capacity  development.  Improving  the \nquality  of  existing  irrigation  infrastructure,  developing  WUAs  for \neffective  system  management  and  sustainable  O&M,  and  support \nfor  diversified  cropping  present \nto \nimprove  agricultural  productivity  and  uplift  the  rural  sector  in \nChhattisgarh. \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program \nfor India, which was finalized in April 2003, states that \u201cexpansion of \nagriculture  and  rural  development  is  arguably  the  most  important \nfeature of the new strategy to mainstream poverty reduction.\u201d ADB\u2019s \nbroadened assistance to the rural sector complements India\u2019s 10th \nFive-Year Plan and policies of the Indian Government that focus on \npromoting  equitable  growth  through  sustainable  agricultural  and \nrural  development.  Chhattisgarh\u2019s  State  Development  Plan  is  to \nimprove  the  livelihood  of  its  rural  population  through  improved \nagricultural  productivity.  These  objectives  are  mutually  reinforcing \nand  provide  a  framework  for  investment  in  irrigated  agriculture  in \nChhattisgarh. \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  improve  rural  livelihoods  and  reduce  rural \npoverty.  The  Project  will \nirrigation  service  delivery, \nimprove \nenhance  agricultural  practices,  and  strengthen  water  resources \nmanagement  to  increase  the  productivity  of  irrigated  agriculture  in \nChhattisgarh.  The  Project  has  the  following  interrelated  strategic \npriorities:  (i)  improve  the  ability  of  WRD  to  develop  and  manage \nirrigation  systems;  (ii)  develop  the  capacity  of  WUAs  to  play  a \nmeaningful  role  in  the  rehabilitation,  management,  and  O&M  of \nirrigation systems;  (iii)  rehabilitate  and  upgrade minor  and  medium \nirrigation  systems  through  a  participatory  process  directed  by \nWUAs;  and  (iv)  enhance  the  WUAs'  and  farmers'  capacities  for \nimproved  agricultural  practices  with  emphasis  on  diversified  and \nrabi cropping. \n \nThe  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $66.6  million  equivalent.  The \nforeign  exchange  cost  is  estimated  at  $15.9  million.  The  local \ncurrency  cost  (including  taxes  and  duties)  is  estimated  at  $50.7 \nmillion equivalent.  \n \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nProject Beneficiariesa \nGovernmentb \n\n \n\n($ million)\n\nForeign \nExchange \n8.2 \n0.0 \n7.7 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n37.9 \n0.6 \n12.2 \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal \nCost \n46.1 \n0.6 \n19.9 \n\n \n\nTotal \na  Contribution of farmers for the construction of field distribution canals. \nb  Including  taxes  and  duties,  interest  during  construction,  and  commitment  fees. \nforeign  exchange \n\nGovernment  of \ncomponent and Government of Chhattisgarh will support local currency costs. \n\nIndia  contribution  will  support \n\n15.9 \n\n66.6 \n\n50.7 \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  $46.1  million  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.

WRD has demonstrated the capacity for implementing the \nsubproject physical works and has made a commitment to introduce \nthe  necessary  institutional  reforms  and  added  capacity  to  achieve \nfull  benefits  from  the  Project.  The  new  arrangements  involve \nestablishment  of  units  for  design,  PIM,  social  development,  and \ndam  safety  under  the  Project.  The  Department  of  Agriculture  will \ndeputize staff to support agricultural activities in close collaboration \nwith  the  PIM  unit.  A  project  management  unit  will  be  established \nwithin  WRD  at  Raipur \nfor \nmanagement  and  coordination  of  all  project  activities  including \nrecruitment of consultants. \n \nProcurement  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  carried \nout  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil \nworks costing over $3 million will be procured through international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures,  and  those  estimated  to  cost  $3 \nmillion  or  less  will  be  procured  through  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Civil  works  awarded  under  local \ncompetitive  bidding  will  be  procured  from  prequalified  bidders \nbased  on  WRD\u2019s  existing  system  of  advance  prequalification \nacceptable  to  ADB,  and  award  of  contracts  will  be  consistent  with \nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \nThe  Project  will  require  382  person-months  of  consulting  services: \n92 \ninternational  and  290  domestic  (an  additional  consulting \npackage  will  be  financed  through  a  grant  from  the  Government  of \nthe United Kingdom). The input reflects the combination of support \nto  implement  the  physical  works  as  well  as  the  institutional \nstrengthening  necessary  to  make  the  investments  effective  and \nsustainable.  Assistance  is  required  to  introduce  new  concepts  of \nPIM,  social  development,  and  modern  design  procedures  through \nboth  formal  and  on-the-job  training  for  the  WRD  staff  that  will \nsupport  the  new  WRD  units.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited \nthrough  international  firms  and  as  individuals  in  accordance  with \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\nimprove \n\nincrease \n\nthe  effectiveness  of \n\nThe  primary  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  will  stem  from  the \nR&U  works  on  irrigation  infrastructure  that  are  expected  to  restore \nthe irrigation areas that farmers can effectively use to at least 90% \nof  their  design  potential.  The  project  R&U  activities  combined  with \nstrengthened  WUAs  and  agricultural  support  services  will \nsignificantly  increase  rabi  cropping.  The  increased  production, \nespecially  the  rabi  cropping,  will  generate  substantial  on-farm \nemployment  for  landless  laborers,  many  of  whom  are  currently \nforced  into  seasonal  migration  due  to  underemployment.  Over \n120,000  farm  families  should  directly  benefit  from  various  R&U \nactivities. A strengthened PIM framework and capacity development \nfor  WUAs  will  improve  the  productivity  of  irrigated  agriculture \nthroughout  the  state.  The  enhanced  capacity  of  WRD  through \nimplementation  of \nproject  activities,  will  not  only \nsubprojects  but  also \nirrigation \ninvestment throughout Chhattisgarh. \n \nImproving  the  capacity  and  effectiveness  of  WUAs  is  critical  to \nensure  sustainable  O&M,  improved  system  operation,  and  water \nmanagement  for  rabi  cropping;  and  creation  of  an  effective  entry \npoint for delivery of agricultural support services. Sustainable WUAs \nmay  not  now  exist,  but  WUA  capacity  development  and  project \nsupport  during  the  years  following  R&U  will  help  ease  the \ntransitional  period  while  WUAs \ninto  effective \norganizations. Institutional changes associated with the Project will \nprovide a strong policy framework to support WUAs. The increased \nagriculture  benefits  from  improved  irrigation  provide  a  natural \nincentive \nthe \nfor \nsustainability of the WUA. \n \nThe  Project  integrates  institutional  reform  as  an  important  strategy \nto  attain  objectives  and  ensure  sustainability.  A  risk  exists  in  that \nthe  implementation  of  the  reform  agenda  may  be  delayed.  GOCG \nsensitization and policy dialogue regarding a strengthened PIM and \nWUA framework have been ongoing throughout project preparation. \nA national workshop on PIM in Raipur, WRD seminars, a study tour \nfor  GOCG  officials  to  other  Indian  states  with  PIM  reforms,  and \nconsultant support to help draft a revised PIM Act have all been part \nof project preparation. The Project will continue the policy dialogue \nand will take measures to assure successful implementation of the \nreforms.  The  Project  devotes  substantial  capacity \npolicy \ndevelopment  for  the  new  functions  and  activities  for  WRD.  The \nProject  provides  ample  support  to  mobilize  and  develop  effective \nWUAs  throughout  Chhattisgarh.  Successful  implementation  of  the \nWUA  program  and  improvement  in  irrigation  performance  will \nsolidify beneficiary and GOCG support for the reforms. \n \nThe  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  will  provide  a  technical \nassistance  (TA)  grant  in  the  amount  of  $1.9  million  to  support \ncapacity development activities for WUAs as well as for monitoring \nand  evaluation.

Chhattisgarh has been identified as one of \nIndia\u2019s food-insecure states. The disparity in land distribution is significant, and land distribution \nand the availability of irrigation are important determinants of household livelihoods. The causes \nof the low productivity of irrigated agriculture in particular are multiple and interrelated. Increased \ndouble cropping in irrigated areas will enhance productivity dramatically, but it requires significant \nimprovements  in  irrigation  performance,  water  management,  and  agricultural  practices.  An \nintegrated  approach  is  needed  to  increase  productivity  and  maximize  the  impacts  of  irrigated \nagriculture  on  rural  growth  and  poverty.  Such  an  approach  requires  not  only  investment  in \nirrigation \ninstitutional  reforms  and  capacity \ndevelopment  to  support  systemic  and  sustainable  change.  The  Government  of  Chhattisgarh \n(GOCG)  recognizes  the  importance  and  challenge  of  animating  irrigated  agriculture  and  is \ncommitted to institutional reforms to support this integrated approach (Appendix 1). \n  \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\ninfrastructure,  but  a  strategy \n\nincludes \n\nthat \n\nAgriculture  in  Chhattisgarh  is  dominated  by  rice,  which  accounts  for  about  75%  of  the \n3. \nannual cropping, or about 4.0 million out of 4.8 million hectares (ha) of the net sown area. Only \n23% of the rice produced in the state is grown under irrigation.1 Irrigated agriculture covers about \n1.3 million ha,2 of which about 43% is served by major systems (greater than 10,000 ha), 20% by \nmedium systems (2,000\u201310,000 ha), and 37% by minor systems (less than 2,000 ha). The annual \ncropping intensity on irrigated lands is only 120%, with an average irrigated paddy yield of about \n2.5  tons  per  ha  (t/ha)  compared  with  states  like  Punjab  with  over  180%  cropping  intensity,  and \naverage rice yields for India as a whole of close to 4.0 t/ha. \n\n4. \nInvestment in irrigation is GOCG\u2019s chief strategy to improve food security, reduce poverty, \nand  spur  rural  development  (Appendix  2).  GOCG  has  allocated  over  $100  million  per  year,  or \n20%  of  its  development  plan  budget,  to  irrigation  development  under  the  current  5-year  plan. \nMaximizing the development impact of this investment is absolutely critical to the well-being of the \nrural sector and addressing rural poverty. In spite of this investment, however, paddy production \nrises  and  falls  dramatically  with  rainfall  received  and  has  ranged  from  2.9  to  5.9  million  tons  in \nrecent  years,  about  4%  of  India's  annual  rice  yield.  Farmers  also  grow  about  0.5  million  ha  of \npulses, over 0.2 million ha of oilseed crops, as well as maize, millet, vegetables, and other crops \nprincipally in the kharif season (wet season cropping usually from June to October).3 The average \nyield  of  these  crops  as  well  as  that  of  rice  is  considerably  lower  than  India's  national  average. \nIrrigated  agriculture  in  Chhattisgarh  can  be  characterized  as  low-input  production  of  low-valued \ngrain on marginally irrigated land where a main determinant of production is rainfall. \n\n5. \nUnderperformance  in  irrigated  agriculture  relates  to  the  high  concentration  of  poverty  in \nrural areas where 80% of Chhattisgarh's residents live and are employed in agricultural activities. \nAn estimated 43% of the state\u2019s population lives below the poverty line, and a similar portion of \n\n                                                 \n1   Agricultural and irrigation statistical information in Chhattisgarh is sparse, not collected systematically, and uncertain.  \n2   About 800,000 ha are in schemes that have been completed and 500,000 ha in systems with ongoing development. \n3   Ninety percent of Chhattisgarh\u2019s annual rainfall occurs in the monsoon period from mid-June through September. \n\n\f2 \n\nthe rural population lacks access to electricity, clean water, and sanitation.4 Forty-five percent of \nthe population is from scheduled tribes and scheduled castes, with an estimated 57% living below \nthe poverty line. Household survey data during project preparation revealed that the average per \ncapita income was $274 and highly skewed, with 60% of the farm households earning less than \n$150 a year. Nearly three quarters of the farmers in Chhattisgarh have holdings of less than 2 ha. \nMany of the poorest rural residents are farm laborers, and up to 40% of some communities are \nforced to migrate after the kharif rice crop due to underemployment.  \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n6. \nSustainability  of  Irrigated  Agriculture.  Notwithstanding  past  investments,  the  viability \nand sustainability of irrigated agriculture are major concerns of the GOCG. The development and \noperation and maintenance (O&M) of irrigation claim a major share of public resources invested \nin agriculture, but the sector continues to have inadequate and decaying infrastructure. Existing \nirrigation systems in Chhattisgarh perform much below their potential for utilization, i.e., the area \nthat farmers are effectively able to use is less than 50% of the designed area for minor schemes, \n50  to  60%  for  medium  schemes,  and  about  75%  for  major  schemes.  Almost  two  thirds  of  the \nminor schemes have less than 50% utilization and one third of the minor schemes have less than \n30%  utilization.  While  evidence  of  inappropriate  planning  and  design  exists,  the  unsatisfactory \nstatus of irrigation facilities is mainly due to degradation from inadequate O&M. \n\n7. \nThe  Water  Resources  Department  (WRD)  of  GOCG  has  over  3,500  staff  members \nincluding several hundred trained engineers, but their skills would benefit from upgrading to allow \nthem  to  more  fully  maximize  the  benefits  of  development  of  irrigation  in  Chhattisgarh.  Water \nmanagement  is  inadequate,  with  insufficient  canal  networks  and  structures  and  limited \noperational orientation toward effective water regulation and distribution. Adequate funds do not \nexist to facilitate regular inspection or prioritization of maintenance and rehabilitation needs, and \nstandardized procedures for O&M are lacking or outdated in many cases. Maintenance has also \nbeen  neglected  due  to  little  farmer  participation  and  lack  of  funding  and  skills  for  water  users \nassociations (WUAs) to conduct O&M. WRD typically collects only about 20\u201325% of the annual \nirrigation  service  fees  from  farmers,  largely  due  to  poor  service  delivery.  Over  80%  of  WRD\u2019s \nO&M budget is for establishment costs, with little remaining for field activities. Thus, considerable \nscope exists for WRD to improve service delivery and financial sustainability. \n\nInadequate system design, irregular field-to-field irrigation, and the need to improve water \n8. \nmanagement limit opportunities for dry season (rabi) cropping from December to March. System \noperational rules are oriented toward kharif paddy production with little water remaining in storage \nto  irrigate  rabi  crops.  Farmers  build  large  field  bunds  to  trap  monsoon  rains,  and  supplemental \nirrigation water is imprecisely applied to kharif rice, which precludes efficient use of fertilizers and \nother  inputs.  Rabi  and  diversified  crops  require  more  controlled  delivery  of  irrigation  than  is \npossible with the existing systems. \n\nAlthough Chhattisgarh's current agricultural development policies advocate diversified and \n9. \nrabi cropping, agricultural practices need improvement to achieve these goals. Field staff from the \nDepartment  of  Agriculture  (DA)  require  additional  capacity  and  resources  to  deliver  support \nservices  effectively.  Most  farmers  are  inexperienced  in  growing  anything  but  kharif  rice,  which \nprovides  food  security,  with  the  surplus  sold  in  the  market.  Farmers  have  access  to  fertilizers, \nagrochemicals,  and  seeds  through  rural  cooperatives  located  throughout  the  state  and  from \nprivate vendors, but fertilizer field application is about half the national average. Government farm \n\n                                                 \n4   Net  per  capita  production  in  Chhattisgarh  in  2002  and  2003  was  lower  than  that  of  all  but  five  other  Indian  states. \nEconomic growth in the last decade for Chhattisgarh ranged from 1.17 to 4.36% while the national average ranged \nfrom 4.91 to 7.83%. \n\n\f3 \n\ncredit  is  available  mainly  through  rural  cooperative  societies  and  private  moneylenders.5 \nHowever,  one  of  the  largest  constraints  to  adequate  input  application  is  farmers'  reluctance  to \nborrow  funds  since  a  reliable  water  supply  cannot  be  assured  to  support  their  investment. \nChhattisgarh has a mature rice milling industry (over 700 mills) and a well-developed marketing \nsystem  (170  wholesale and  1,679  primary  rural  markets),  partly  because  it  used  to  supply  over \n70% of the rice for the undivided Madhya Pradesh (MP).6 Farmers sell to both private and state \ntraders,  although  subsistence  production  is  important  due  to  widespread  food  insecurity. \nProduction  of  crops  such  as  maize,  gram,  and  other  pulses,  oilseed,  and  vegetables  has  been \nrising in recent years, confirming that demand, farmer responsiveness, and markets exist for rabi \nand  diversified  crops.  In  many  cases,  farmers  simply  require  more  reliable  water  supply, \nimproved knowledge, and more experience in growing rabi and diversified crops for a sustainable \nchange in agricultural practice (Appendix 3). \n\n10.  WUAs. Chhattisgarh retained the Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) Act that was \npassed  in  1999  when  the  state  was  part  of  MP.  About  946  WUAs  were  created  on  over  1.13 \nmillion  ha  to  support  irrigation  system  O&M,  however,  many  of  the  WUAs  are  not  active  or \neffective since they were never mobilized and have received no capacity development. Farmers \nare  supportive  of  a  greater  role  in  irrigation  system  management,  but  WUAs  need  skills  in \nleadership,  water  management,  O&M,  and  financial  management  to  become  effective.  Farmers \nand WUAs have a much greater incentive for effective water management and O&M than WRD, \nbut they need secure financial resources to support their efforts.7 \n\n11. \nAlthough  the  PIM  Act  recognizes  WUAs  and  provides  a  legal  basis  for  farmer \nparticipation,  a  strengthened  institutional  framework  for  WUAs  is  needed  that  (i)  more  clearly \ndefines  the  role  of  WUAs  and  gives  them  authority  for  system  management  and  O&M;  (ii) \nenhances resources flowing to WUAs for O&M, preferably through direct sharing of the irrigation \nservice  fee  (ISF)  revenues;8  and  (iii)  improves  representation  of  irrigators  including  (a)  at  least \none  dedicated  WUA  for  irrigation  schemes  of  200  ha  or  larger;  (b)  membership  given  to \nhouseholds so that both women and men can attend meetings, vote, and run for office; and (c) \nparticipation of sharecroppers. Although some reforms could be achieved within the existing legal \nframework, passage of a revised PIM Act will be the most effective means for change. \n\n12. \nOther  Indian  States,  notably  Andhra  Pradesh,  have  had  good  results  using  PIM  as  an \nintegral  strategy  to  promote  reforms  for  improved  service  delivery  in  the  irrigation  sector.  The \nAndhra  Pradesh  program,  which  was  World  Bank  assisted,  combined  significant  capacity \ndevelopment  for  WUAs,  irrigation  rehabilitation,  and  improved  O&M  funds  and  achieved  the \nfollowing successes: (i) effective irrigation utilization doubled in some command areas; (ii) overall \nwater usage declined by as much as one third due to better water management by WUAs even \nthough  the  irrigated  areas  increased;  (iii)  and  the  percentage  of  farmers  paying  their  irrigation \nfees  increased  significantly  since  the  WUAs  would  receive  the  funds  for  O&M  even  though  the \nfees were increased by as much as three times the previous rate (Appendix 3). \n\n13.  WRD. WRD currently has the technical capacity to develop and manage irrigation, and its \nplanning  framework  calls  for  significant  expansion  of  the  irrigated  area.  However,  institutional \nanalysis  during  project  preparation  indicated  that  the  development  impact  could  be  significantly \nincreased  and  more  sustainable  if  the  following  were  integrated  into  WRD's  irrigation \ndevelopment  and  management  practices:  improved  irrigation  designs;  more  effective  water \nmanagement; more sustainable O&M; agricultural support services; and increased participation of \nWUAs. \n\n                                                 \n5  In  the  survey  during  project  preparation,  45%  of  the  respondents  used  Government  loans,  40%  used  private \n\nmoneylenders, and 15% used their own resources for farming. \n\n6  Chhattisgarh used to be part of Madhya Pradesh until the state was bifurcated in 2000, creating Chhattisgarh. \n7  Currently WRD is supposed to give WUAs Rs40 per ha, but funds are not available in many cases. \n8   Irrigation service fees are called \"water tax\" in Chhattisgarh. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n14. \nAlthough  Chhattisgarh  faces  constraints  as  a  new  state  with  maturing  capacity  and  an \nevolving  policy  framework,  many  fundamentals  are  in  place  for  dynamic  growth  in  irrigated \nagriculture. Chhattisgarh is investing substantial resources in irrigation and water resources, but \nneeds  assistance  in  (i)  redefining  and  clarifying  roles  and  responsibilities  of  WUAs,  WRD,  and \nother sector stakeholders; (ii) strengthening institutional frameworks; and (iii) developing capacity \nto  achieve  the  maximum  potential  from  their  substantial  public  investment.  Chhattisgarh  has \nshown  a  strong  commitment  to  undertaking  the  necessary  reforms  and  action  to  increase  the \neffectiveness of irrigated agriculture, and, with Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance, offers \ntremendous potential for increased agricultural productivity and improved rural livelihood. \n\n15. \nADB  Framework  and  Rationale.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  for  India, \nwhich was finalized in April 2003, states that \u201cexpansion of agriculture and rural development is \narguably  the  most  important  feature  of  the  new  strategy  to  mainstream  poverty  reduction.\u201d  The \nCSP places emphasis on focal states, including Chhattisgarh, that meet the following criteria: (i) \nhigher than average poverty incidence, (ii) new states or those important for regional cooperation, \nand (iii) a strong commitment to reform. ADB\u2019s assistance to the rural sector complements India\u2019s \n10th Five-Year Plan that focuses on promoting equitable growth through sustainable agriculture \nand  rural  development.  Chhattisgarh\u2019s  own  development  plans  call  for  increasing  the  primary \nsector\u2019s  contribution  to  the  state  economy  by  50%  over  the  next  10  years.  The  development \nobjectives  of  ADB,  Government  of  India,  and  GOCG  are  mutually  reinforcing  and  provide  a \nframework to support investment in irrigated agriculture in Chhattisgarh (Appendix 4). \n\n16. \nCoordination  of  the  Project  with  existing  and  planned  ADB  support  in  Chhattisgarh  will \nprovide  synergistic  benefits  to  enhance  development  impact  in  the  rural  sector.  The  approved \nChhattisgarh  State  Roads  Development  Sector  Project9  will  improve  connectivity  of  rural  and \nunderdeveloped  areas  and  economic  growth  areas,  and  will  facilitate  the  marketing  of  irrigated \ncrops. The Agribusiness Development Support Project, currently under preparation, will promote \nhigh-value agriculture in Chhattisgarh, stimulating demand for more diversified cropping. \n\nLessons Learned. Although this is ADB's first irrigation (and rural) project in India,10 the \n17. \nWorld  Bank  has  executed  integrated  irrigation  and  water  resources  management  projects  over \nthe last decade in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh. Lessons \nfrom  these  projects  include  the  following:  (i)  reforms  in  the  irrigation  sector  need  to  penetrate \ndeeply  and  address  interrelated  issues  simultaneously;  (ii)  reforms  require  the  commitment  of \naffected  agencies  and  wide  commitment  and  acceptance  by  all  stakeholders;  (iii)  institutional \nchanges  should  be  implemented  and  reinforced  through  development  of  physical  infrastructure; \n(iv)  capacity  building  for  all  institutions  and  stakeholders  in  water  resources  management  and \nirrigation is essential; (v) development and participation of WUAs and farmers are vital elements \nof reform; and (vi) a focus on project (and subproject) management is essential to (a) strengthen \nadministrative  capacity  for  effective  implementation  and  disbursement,  (b)  ensure  safeguards, \nand  (c)  develop  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems.  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  WUAs \nacross Asia has shown that (i) WUA development is a long-term process, (ii) WUAs need to be \ninvolved  in  all  aspects  of  irrigation  development  (including  rehabilitation)  and  management  for \nsustainable  O&M  and  improved  service  delivery,  (iii)  executing  agencies  require  focused \nengagement  and  capacity  development  to  create  effective  WUAs,  and  (iv)  an  emphasis  on \nfinancial  resources  and  O&M  is  necessary  for  sustainable  improvements.  More  broadly,  ADB's \nexperience  with  agriculture  projects  has  shown  the  need  for  realism  in  estimating  project \neconomic rates of return, which have proven particularly sensitive to rice prices and to the assumed \nlevels of cropping intensity, input use, and productivity. \n\n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2003.

The \nProject  has  the  following  interrelated  objectives:  (i)  improve  the  ability  of  WRD  to  develop  and \nmanage  the  irrigation  sector;  (ii)  develop  the  ability  of  WUAs  to  play  a  principal  role  in \nmanagement and O&M of irrigation systems; (iii) rehabilitation and upgrading (R&U) of minor and \nmedium  irrigation  systems  through  a  participatory  process  with  WUAs;  and  (iv)  enhance  the \nWUAs' and farmers' agricultural practices with emphasis on rabi cropping. \n\nB. \n\n19. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe Project has four components. \n\n1. \n\nStrengthening WRD \n\nInstitutional  Reforms  within  WRD.  Within  WRD,  the  Project  will  strengthen  existing \n20. \ncapacity  and  support  new  activities  and  institutional  arrangements  to  maximize  the  project \ndevelopment objectives and improve overall management and development of irrigation systems. \nThe following new operational units will be developed for WRD operations under the Project: (i) \nPIM Unit that will mobilize and train WUAs (within 1 month of loan effectiveness); (ii) Design Unit \n(with  survey  team)  for  project  R&U  and  WRD  design  activities;  (iii)  Social  Development  Unit \n(SDU)  that  will  be  responsible  for  social  assessment,  resettlement,  indigenous  peoples, \nenvironment, and economic analysis of R&U subprojects design (SDU and Design Unit within 4 \nmonths of loan effectiveness); and (iv) Dam Safety Unit (within 12 months of loan effectiveness). \nThe  consultants  will  assist  WRD  to  upgrade  overall  WRD  procedures  to  strengthen  irrigation \ndevelopment and management. \n\n21.  WRD  Capacity  Development.  WRD  capacity  development  will  (i)  augment  the  existing \nskills mix to support the project objectives, (ii) establish the functional capacity of the new units, \nand  (iii)  improve  overall  performance  of  WRD  technical  and  nontechnical  functions.11  The \nconsultants will create capacity development curricula in consultation with WRD, and training will \nbe coordinated through the four chief engineers\u2019 (CE) offices. Consultants and trained WRD staff \nwill deliver seminar programs and field training during and after the Project. Exposure to improved \nmethods  for  irrigation  development  and  management  will  also  be  accomplished  through  topical \nworkshops and staff attendance at national and regional events. \n\n22. \nTo  enhance  WRD's  technical  and  management  capacity,  establish  the  new  units,  and \nfacilitate capacity development, the Project will modernize equipment and develop new facilities. \nComputer-assisted  survey  and  design  equipment  will  support  project  R&U  and  be  used  to  train \nstaff  for  improved  irrigation  design.  The  Project  will  introduce  computer  and  information \ntechnology (IT) equipment in the four CE offices, WRD headquarters, new WRD units, the project \nmanagement unit (PMU), and training centers. Extensive IT training will be provided to enhance \nWRD's  capacity  to  develop  and  maintain  management  information  systems  for  project \nimplementation and for more effective management, monitoring, and administrative procedures.12 \n\n                                                 \n11  WRD  capacity  development  specific  to  project  objectives  may  include  (i)  participatory  irrigation  design;  (ii)  WUA \nformation,  development,  and  support;  (iii)  dam  safety,  design,  and  management;  (iv)  social,  environmental,  and \neconomic  assessment;  and  (v)  project  economic  analysis.  Capacity  development  will  also  address  general  WRD \ntechnical  and  management  practices  and  may  include  (i)  irrigation  design,  (ii)  modern  survey  techniques,  (iii) \nhydrology,  (iv)  water  management  and  systems  operation,  (v)  geotechnical  assessment,  (vi)  construction  management \nand quality control, and (vii) management information systems and information technology (IT). \n\n12  As acceptance of IT grows, it may be expanded to district offices. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nThe  Project  will  establish  four  regional  training  centers  for  WRD,  WUA,  and  farmer  capacity \ndevelopment. \n\n2. \n\nParticipatory Irrigation Management \n\nStrengthening  the  Institutional  Framework  and  WUA  Mobilization.  Redefining  and \n23. \nstrengthening  the  roles,  responsibilities,  and  authority  for  irrigation  management  and  O&M \nbetween  WRD  and  WUAs  to  improve  irrigation  sector  performance  are  important  goals  of  the \nProject.  The  Project  supports  strengthening  the  institutional  framework,  including  a  revised  PIM \nAct13 with the following policy changes: (i) ensuring that irrigation systems that receive R&U will \nhave  their  own  WUA  to  be  responsible  for  O&M,  and  (ii)  ensuring  direct  fund  flows  from  ISF \n(footnote  10)  to  WUAs  for  sustainable  O&M.  The  Project  will  contract  a  nongovernment \norganization (NGO) to conduct an awareness campaign about revised PIM policies, basic WUA \norganization, and the planned WUA elections to start the WUA development process. Elections \nare currently scheduled for June 2005 under the existing PIM Act and may be delayed to ensure \nthe new WUAs and officers come under the auspices of the revised PIM Act. This delay may be \nnecessary  to  allow  the  Project  consultants  and  WRD  to  develop  the  revised  PIM  Act  and  for \npassage of the revised PIM by the legislative assembly. Although this initial mobilization will be \nfor  all  WUAs  in  Chhattisgarh,  schemes  targeted  for  R&U  (based  on  technical  criteria)  will  be \nprioritized. \n\n24.  WUA Capacity Development and Support. Consultants will train WRD staff for the PIM \nUnit  and  provide  capacity  development  to  ensure  that  WUAs:  (i)  manage  irrigation  systems \neffectively,  (ii)  provide  sustainable  O&M,  and  (iii)  develop  rabi  and  diversified  cropping.  The \nfollowing activities will take place during year 1 of the Project: (i) mobilize WUAs; (ii) establish the \nPIM  Unit;  (iii)  develop  modules  and  activities  for  the  WUA  Capacity  Development  Program \n(WUACDP);  (iv)  train  trainers  (NGO  and  WRD  staff)  for  the  WUACDP;  and  (v)  formulate  a \nstrategy, schedule, and logistics for WUACDP. WRD has designated a PIM Unit chief and other \nstaff positions for PIM field offices at the four training centers. \n\nAn NGO will be recruited to support the PIM Unit with WUACDP delivery over the first 5 \n25. \nyears of the Project until adequate WRD staff can be trained. The PIM Unit will deliver WUACDP \nactivities primarily at the village level and activities will be coordinated through the four regional \ntraining  centers  that  will  house  regional  PIM  units.14  The  regional  PIM  Unit  will  organize  field \ndelivery  of  WUACDP  activities  through  local  WRD  and  DA  offices,  and  local  rural  government \n(panchayat) or other local meeting facilities. All WUA leaders will receive core WUACDP training. \nWUACDP  modules  will  provide  basic  skills  covering  (i)  WUA  management  and  leadership,  (ii) \nfinancial management, (iii) conflict resolution, (iv) irrigation system O&M, (v) water management, (vi) \nagricultural development, and (vii) gender development. In addition, training will be offered at the \nregional centers and to all WUA members. \n\n26. \nIn systems that receive R&U, the regional PIM Unit staff will work with WUAs in the field to \nprepare water management plans, rabi cropping and marketing plans, and O&M plans. All WUAs \nthat  successfully  complete  WUACDP  will  receive  a  one-time  grant  of  Rs22,500  for  estimated \norganizational start-up costs, administration, and O&M equipment. In R&U systems, the one-time \nstart-up grant will be Rs45,000 to help ensure adequate support for management and O&M of the \nupgraded facilities, and these WUAs will receive transitional O&M funds on a declining basis. The \n\n                                                 \n13  The Project will support (i) a revised PIM Act with implementing rules and regulations; (ii) a model contract for WRD \nand WUAs to specify roles, responsibilities, and authority for irrigation management and O&M; and (iii) a set of by-\nlaws that define obligations between a WUA and its members. \n\n14  Regional training centers and PIM units will be located at Ambikapur, Bilaspur, Jagdalpur, and Raipur. Each regional \nPIM unit will include (i) a WRD regional PIM officer, (ii) WUACDP regional coordinator, (iii) 3\u20136 WUACDP specialists, \n(iv) one deputy director from Department of Agriculture, and (v) one or more irrigated  agriculture specialists. Exact \nstaff numbers at each center will depend on the demand for services in the area. GOCG will provide interim facilities. \n\n\f7 \n\nPIM Unit will support WUAs in R&U systems throughout the life of the Project, and assist WUAs \nto develop and maintain monitoring and evaluation systems. \n\n3. \n\nRehabilitation and Upgrading of Irrigation Systems  \n\nPilot  Rehabilitation  and  Upgrading  Works.  R&U  will  fully  involve  the  WUAs  in  needs \n27. \nassessment,  design,  and  construction  supervision.  The  PIM  Unit  will  coordinate  WUA \ninvolvement  in  R&U  after  the  members  complete  the  WUACDP.  It  is  anticipated  that  the \nWUACDP and PIM Unit may take a year to become fully operational, so that at the beginning of \nthe Project, pilot procedures will be used to (i) select schemes,15 (ii) train WUAs, and (iii) design \nand  execute  R&U.  The  pilot  R&U  will  refine  the  process  for  WUA  participation  in  R&U  and  will \ndemonstrate project benefits to other WUAs and WRD field staff. Projects and WUAs selected for \nthe pilot R&U will include the four subprojects that were prepared during the project preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  (PPTA)16  and  eight  additional  projects,  with  selection  based  on  project \ntechnical criteria and discussion with WRD and the PIM Unit. The pilot phase for R&U will begin \nin year 1 of the Project. \n\n28. \nFramework  for  Subproject  Selection.  The  Project  will  provide  R&U  for  minor  and \nmedium irrigation systems. Selecting systems, especially minor ones, with a high potential for rabi \ncropping  is  essential  to  (i)  ensure  project  viability,  (ii)  sustain  the  effectiveness  of  WUAs,  and \n(iii) increase agricultural productivity. Initial screening of subprojects will be based on (i) size, (ii) \nreservoir condition, and (iii) water availability in order to eliminate systems with little potential for \nrabi  cropping.17  Appendix  5  gives  the  selection  criteria.  After  technical  screening,  the  PIM  and \nSDU units, WUAs, and WRD field staff will conduct an initial assessment to evaluate the systems' \nphysical,  social  (including  poverty,  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples)  and  environmental \nconditions  and  economic  viability.  Schemes  with  high  potential  for  economic  returns  and \ncommunity  benefits  will  be  prioritized,18  and  WUA  willingness  to  participate  in  the  rehabilitation \nprocess, provide O&M, and pursue rabi cropping will be factored into the final selection. WUAs in \nsystems that meet technical subproject screening criteria will be prioritized for WUACDP, so they \ncan  be  trained,  their  commitment  assessed,  and  schemes  selected  for  R&U.  The  project  target \nfor R&U is approximately 200 minor schemes and 20 medium schemes, a total of about 200,000 \nha of R&U that will be sequenced over the last 6 years of the Project. \n\n29. \nRehabilitation  and  Upgrading  Program.  Following  the  pilot  subprojects  and  starting  in \nyear 2, the R&U program will begin and will be executed in two stages. After the initial appraisal \nand the system's topographical survey, stage 1 of the R&U will start with a comprehensive field \nassessment  to  (i)  identify  R&U  needs,  (ii)  explore  design  options,  and  (iii)  define  the  O&M \nimplications of the design options. The assessment will involve WUAs, farmers, WRD staff, and \nthe Design and PIM units. Once agreement on R&U works is reached, the Design Unit and field \noffices  will  finalize  designs  and  prepare  tender  documents  that  will  require  endorsement  by  the \nWUA. WRD field offices will execute R&U contracting using standard WRD procedures that are \nmodified to comply with ADB guidelines and loan assurances. WUAs will supervise construction \nwith  WRD,  and  WUA  agreement  will  be  required  before  the  release  of  final  payment  to  the \ncontractor. The PIM Unit will train and assist WUAs to participate in the R&U process. \n\n                                                 \n15  The same technical criteria will be used for pilot subproject selection (Appendix 5). \n16  ADB.  2001.  Technical  Assistance  to  India  for  Preparing  the  Chhattisgarh  Irrigation  Development  Sector  Project. \n\nManila. \n\n17  Of  WRD's  2,000  minor  schemes,  it  is  estimated  that  between  300  and  600  will  meet  the  technical  criteria  with  an \naverage size of 500 ha. Many of the existing 29 medium schemes, which average 5,000 ha, will meet the technical \ncriteria.  At  present,  not  all  subprojects  have  been  selected,  but  the  criteria  and  methodology  are  in  place  for  their \nselection. Numerous potential subprojects were identified during the PPTA without detailed investigation. R&U will be \nundertaken up to the limit of the project funds. \n\n18  A basic indicator is schemes that have very low utilization of irrigation potential relative to the design potential. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n30. \nStage  2  of  R&U  is  development  of  field  channels  and  associated  on-farm  water \nmanagement activities that require WUA decisions regarding: (i) distribution of rabi water, which \nwill  normally  be  insufficient  to  irrigate  the  entire  system;19  (ii)  extent  of  field  channels  and  their \nrouting; (iii) WUA responsibilities for water management; and (iv) rabi cropping plans. Therefore, \nfield channels and on-farm water management activities will not be included in stage 1 of R&U.20 \nIn  the  year  following  stage  1  R&U  works  and  after  the  WUAs  have  experience  with  the  new \nstructures, PIM Unit staff will work with the WUAs to develop (i) field channels, (ii) on-farm water \nmanagement  plans,  and  (iii)  rabi  cropping  and  marketing  plans.  After  the  WUA  has  submitted \nplans for field channels, on-farm activities, and rabi cropping and marketing to the PIM Unit, the \nProject  will  support  materials  and  technical  supervision  to  install  field  channels  and  associated \nworks, and WUAs will provide land and labor. \n\n31. \nPriority  Program  for  Sluice  Repair.  System-wide  R&U  will  be  limited  to  systems  that \nmeet the R&U selection criteria, but the Project will provide assistance to all WUAs in minor and \nmedium  schemes  with  tanks  that  have  dysfunctional  sluice  gates.  Gate  repair  should  (i)  not \nrequire  major  civil  works,  (ii)  be  economically  justified,  and  (iii)  involve  a  system  where  the \ncommand area is able to benefit from the water supplied. WUAs in the WUACDP will be able to \nrequest  inspection  for  sluice  repair,  and  the  responsible  executive  engineer  for  the  system  and \nWUAs  will  form  a  team  to  manage  needed  repairs  for  the  priority  scheme.  WUAs  will  help \ndetermine  the  needed  repairs,  develop  an  O&M  plan,  and  endorse  the  final  works.  This \nsubcomponent, which starts in year 2 of the Project, will target 500 subprojects. \n\n4. \n\nAgricultural Support Services  \n\n32. \nThe  Project  will  provide  agricultural  support  services  for  systems  that  have  undergone \nR&U. The PIM Unit will work directly with WUA members in their own irrigation system to assess \nproblems  and  define  strategies  to  improve  productivity  in  their  particular  context.  Eight  irrigated \nagriculture specialists  to  be  based  in  the  regional  PIM  units  will  be  recruited  as  part  of  the  PIM \nNGO  support.  The  DA will  provide a  full-time  deputy  director  to  work  at  each  regional  PIM  Unit \nand to help coordinate local DA staff and programs to support WUAs in the subproject areas. The \nPIM Unit agricultural support staff will work closely with WUAs on a long-term basis to identify the \nlinkages between water management and cropping potential, and will assist WUAs at every step \nof  agricultural  production,  from  selection  and  application  of  inputs  to  identification  of  local \nmarkets.  The  same  staff  will  link  WUAs  with  relevant  specialists  at  Indira  Gandhi  Agricultural \nUniversity in Raipur, private sector vendors, and other agricultural support resources. Considering \npresent cropping practices and market potential, the initial focus is expected to be on improving \nyield and quality, and hence, market value of kharif rice varieties, and improving the productivity \nof rabi pulses and oilseeds. Over time, rabi cropping should diversify into more commercial crops, \nand diversification should spread to kharif season.  \n\n33. \nThe  Project's  diversified  cropping  program  will  support  demonstration  and  small-scale \nassistance projects to promote rabi and diversified cropping. The PIM Unit will work with WUAs to \ndevelop proposals for project support including seed and input trials. Proposals will be submitted \nwhen rabi cropping and marketing plans are completed by WUAs. Installation of field channels or \nan on-farm water management plan is a prerequisite to avail of funds. Project support through the \ndiversified cropping program will be provided as grants to WUAs through the PIM Unit, based on \nthe number of hectares of rabi or diversified crops. PIM Unit staff will also facilitate farm-to-farm \nand WUA-to-WUA demonstrations of successful rabi cropping to share farmer experiences. \n\n                                                 \n19  It is estimated that, on average, sufficient water will be available for rabi season on 30-50% of the rehabilitated area, \n\ndepending on rainfall, storage capacity, and irrigation efficiency during kharif season. \n\n20  Outlets may also be delayed to stage 2 of the R&U works if WUA consensus on their location cannot be achieved. \n\n\f9 \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n34. \nFocus on Sustainability and Participation. A key to achieving sustainability, especially \nfor O&M, is WUA participation. WUAs have a stronger incentive to execute O&M since farmers' \nlivelihoods are directly dependent on system performance. Participation of WUAs in R&U works \nwill (i) foster a sense of ownership and reinforce responsibility to maintain the irrigation system, \nand  (ii)  build  the  capacity  of  WUAs  to  operate  the  system  effectively  and  to  appreciate \nmaintenance needs. System R&U  will increase the incentive for WUA  maintenance since some \nsystems are currently so degraded that any O&M investment is futile. Project O&M funds will be \nprovided on a declining basis following R&U, while contributions from WUAs increase as system \nperformance and productivity improve. Policy changes to ensure that farmers play a meaningful \nrole  in  system  management  and  that  financial  resources  flow  to  WUAs  are  key  measures  for \nO&M sustainability, not only in R&U subprojects, but for all irrigation systems in Chhattisgarh. \n\nIntegrated Approach.  A vital project objective is to increase the productivity of irrigated \n35. \nagriculture  in  Chhattisgarh.  The  Project  explicitly  recognizes  that  improved  water  management \nand  agricultural  support  services  are  critical  to  facilitate  rabi  cropping  and  optimize  productivity \nincreases from R&U works. These activities are an integral part of the project design and will help \nachieve benefits that would not be possible with R&U works alone. \n\n36. \nGender.  The  Project  acknowledges  institutional,  social,  and  cultural  barriers  to  women's \nempowerment and the impact this may have on access to and participation in activities related to \nirrigation and water resources. The Project provides measures to promote the interests of women \nand  to  ensure  gender  equity  in  governance  and  decision-making  processes  (Appendix  2).  The \nrevised PIM Act will designate households as members of WUAs, so that both women and men \ncan attend meetings, vote, and stand for election. WUAs will have a female representative on the \nmanagement  committee  and  all  subcommittees,  with  an  overall  target  representation  of  30% \nwomen  on  all  committees.  A  WUA  gender  subcommittee  will  address  (i)  the  needs  of  women \ntitleholders and WUA members; (ii) women farm laborers; (iii) developing and protecting access \nto  irrigation  water  for  alternative  uses  such  as  home  gardens,  livestock,  and  domestic \nconsumption;  and  (iv)  creation  of  capacity  development  and  livelihood  programs  targeting \nwomen.  The  Project  calls  for  an  initial  10%  representation  by  women  as  PIM  Unit  trainers  who \nare contracted through project funds, growing to 20% by year 3 of the Project. \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n37. \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $66.6  million  equivalent  inclusive  of  taxes,  duties, \nand  interest  and  other  charges  on  the  loan  during  implementation  (Table  1).  The  foreign \nexchange  cost  (including  interest  and  commitment  charges)  is  estimated  at  $15.9  million.  The \nlocal currency cost (including taxes and duties) is estimated at $50.7 million equivalent (Appendix \n6 and Supplementary Appendix A). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nItem \n\n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n\n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\n1.

The  loan  will  finance  the  foreign  exchange  cost  excluding  the \ncommitment  charges,  and  interest  on  the  loan  during  construction  as  well  as  $37.9  million \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The Government of India will finance the foreign exchange \ncost comprising interest, commitment charge, and other charges on the loan during construction. \nThe  Government  of  Chhattisgarh  will  support  local  currency  costs  of  $12.2  million.  The \nbeneficiaries  will  fund  $0.6  million  equivalent  of  the  local  costs  through  in-kind  labor  and \ncontribution of land right of way for field channels (Table 2). The Government of India will onlend \nthe loan to GOCG, and WRD will use the loan proceeds. \n \n\nSource \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nForeign \nExchange \n8.2 \n0.0 \n7.7 \n15.9 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \nAsian Development Bank \n37.9 \nProject Beneficiariesa \n0.6 \nGovernmentb \n12.2 \n50.7 \nTotal \n \na  Contribution of farmers for the construction of field distribution canals. \nb  Including taxes and  duties, interest during construction, and commitment fees.

The  Government  of  India  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the \nreasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these \nterms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own  independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The Government \nwill onlend the money to the GOCG on terms determined by the Government. \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Organization and Management \n\n40. \nImplementation  Period.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  7  years  (2005\u20132012) \ninclusive of all activities. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. Initial emphasis will be on \ndeveloping  the  capacity  of  WUAs  and  defining  procedures  for  the  R&U  process.  Subprojects \nprepared under the PPTA and eight additional subprojects to be prepared in 2005 will be ready \nfor contract award by 2006. Lessons learned from the pilot activity will feed into the procedures \nfor subsequent subproject development. Subproject implementation plans will be prepared each \nyear  based  on  the  selection  criteria  and  WUA  demand.  Construction  of  stage  1  R&U  works  for \nsubprojects  will  start  after  the  monsoon  and  field  channel  installation will  take  place  in  the  year \nfollowing canal works. The priority sluice repair program will begin in 2005. \n\nExecuting  Agency.  WRD  has  the  mandate  for  planning,  implementing,  and  operating \n41. \nirrigation schemes in Chhattisgarh and will be the Executing Agency. WRD has demonstrated the \ncapacity  to  implement  subproject  physical  works  and  has  made  a  commitment  to  introduce  the \nnecessary institutional reforms and added capacity to achieve full benefits from the Project. New \nunits  for  design,  PIM,  social  development,  and  dam  safety  will  be  established.  The  project \norganization chart is in Appendix 8 and detailed implementation arrangements in Supplementary \nAppendix B. The DA will support implementation of the agricultural support services component in \nclose collaboration with the PIM Unit and will provide five deputy directors for project support. \n\n42. \nThe  PMU  will  be  established  at  WRD  in  Raipur  to  assume  overall  responsibility  for \nmanagement  of  all  project  activities  including  recruitment  of  consultants.  A  project  director  has \nbeen appointed and administrative staffing positions designated for the PMU. The project director \nwill  report  to  the  WRD  secretary  through  the  engineer-in-chief.  R&U  works  will  be  implemented \n(tendering,  contracting,  accounting)  in  the  field  through  the  existing  WRD  structure.  One \naccountant  from  the  PMU  will  be  stationed  in  each  of  the  3  CE's  zones  that  have  eligible \nsubprojects  to  provide  support  on  ADB  procedures,  supervise  monitoring,  and  coordinate \nreporting of procurement and financial information to the PMU. \n\n43. \nProject  Coordination.  A  project  steering  committee  chaired  by  the  chief  secretary  and \ncomprising  secretary-level  members  from  concerned  departments21  was  formed  for  the  PPTA \nand has been extended for the Project. The project steering committee will meet at least yearly or \nat the request of the chief secretary to provide policy guidance and review project performance. A \nproject technical coordination committee chaired by the WRD secretary and comprising of high-\nranking technical officers from line agencies will be formed within 3 months of loan effectiveness \nto  coordinate  project  implementation  and  technical  issues.  A  WRD  working  group  under  the \nproject director has been established to revise the PIM Act and to address WUA issues. \n\n2. \n\nProcurement \n\nProcurement financed from the ADB loan proceeds will be carried out in accordance with \n44. \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  costing  over  $3  million  will  be  procured  through \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB) procedures, and those estimated to cost $3 million or less \nwill  be  procured  through  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nIndicative procurement packages are in Appendix 9. Civil works will be procured from prequalified \nbidders  based  on  WRD\u2019s  existing  procedures  for  prequalification  and  selection  of  contracts \nconsistent  with  ADB  guidelines.  Several  proximate  minor  schemes \nfor  R&U \nsimultaneously  may  be  bundled  into  one  contract  package.  Field  channel  works  will  be  done \n\ntargeted \n\n                                                 \n21  Members of the committee are the chief secretary (chair), and the principal secretaries of the departments of water \nresources,  agriculture,  forest  and  environment,  fisheries,  tribal  welfare,  panchayat  and  rural  development,  and \nfinance.  \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nthrough a combination of LCB contracts and in-kind contribution and contracted labor by WUAs. \nMinor works under the priority sluice program will be implemented through LCB with appropriate \ncommunity  participation.  Vehicles,  equipment,  and  materials  valued  at  more  than  $500,000  will \nbe  procured  by  ICB,  and  those  valued  at  $500,000  or  less  through  LCB.  Small  or  off-the-shelf \ngoods  and  materials  valued  at  less  than  $100,000  may  be  procured  using  direct  purchase \narrangements. \n\n45. \nTo  support  timely  contract  approvals  while  ensuring  sound  practice  and  accountability, \npost  facto  approval  procedures  will  be  adopted  for  LCB  civil  works  contracts.  For  the  first  five \ncontract  packages  under  LCB  from  each  of  the  3  CE  zones,  WRD  will  submit  the  procurement \ndocuments and bid evaluation for ADB review and approval before awarding the contract. If ADB \nfinds  the  documents  and  evaluation  satisfactory,  WRD  will  proceed  with  procurement  and \ncontract  award  for  subsequent  contract  packages  without  prior  ADB  approval.  In  these  cases, \nWRD  will  retain  a  record  of  all  procurement  documentation,  including  copies  of  the  signed \ncontract and the bid evaluation report, for inspection during ADB project supervision missions or \non request. The procurement processes and contract awards will be audited annually as part of \nthe performance audit. If any contract award is found unacceptable, ADB may refuse to finance \nthe contract. \n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n46. \nThe  Project  will  require  an  estimated  382  person-months  of  consulting  services:  92 \ninternational and 290 domestic. Project consultants are listed in Appendix 10 and their terms of \nreference  (TOR)  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C  (additional  consulting  services  will  be  financed \nthrough  a  grant  from  the  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom).  This  input  reflects  the  support \nnecessary for institutional and capacity development to introduce new concepts in the PIM, Social \nDevelopment, and Dam Safety Units to maximize development impact and ensure sustainability. \nNGOs  will  be  contracted  to  support  implementation  of  project  activities  through  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  selecting  domestic  consultants. \nThe quality- and cost-based selection method will be used to select consulting firms (Appendix 9 \nhas  recruitment  details).  For  expedient  mobilization  of  the  Project,  WRD  has  requested  ADB  to \nrecruit the project management consultants, who will be responsible for recruiting NGO support \npackages. \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action \n\n47. \nConsultant support needs to be established promptly to develop WUA and WRD capacity \nand  maximize  project  objectives.  ADB  management  has  approved  advance  action  to  cover  the \nperiod from the end of the Appraisal Mission until loan effectiveness. The issuance of invitations \nfor  proposals  under  advance  procurement  action  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  The \nGovernment was advised that ADB approval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance \nthe Project. \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n48. \nLoan  disbursements  and  maintenance  of  imprest  accounts  will  be  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January  2001)  and  Interim  Guidelines  for  Disbursement \nOperations,  LIBOR-Based  Loan  Product  (July  2002)  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  ADB  will \nprovide  the  Borrower  with  an  imprest  advance  that  will  not  exceed  3  months'  estimated \nexpenditure  or  5%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  The  controller  of  aid  accounts  and \naudit in the Ministry of Finance of the Borrower will maintain the imprest account in the Reserve \nBank  of  India,  and  pass  on  the  rupee  equivalent  to  WRD  through  the  Finance  Department  of \nGOCG. WRD will establish a second-generation imprest account (SGIA) as a no-interest current \naccount with a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. The Ministry of Finance of the Borrower and \n\n\f13 \n\nGOCG  have  assured  that  the  entire  proceeds of  the  imprest  advance  would  be  creditied  to  the \nSGIA  within  30  days  of  ADB  disbursement.  The  SGIA  proceeds  may  be  used  to  make  any \npayments  for  eligible  expenditures  by  WRD.  For  individual  payments  not  exceeding  $50,000, \nWRD may adopt the statement-of-expenditure (SOE) procedure for claiming reimbursement and \nliquidating  of  the  imprest  fund.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  of  the  Borrower  will  be  responsible  for \nmonitoring  WRD's  SGIA,  including  monthly  reconciliation  of  accounts  and  preparation  of \nwithdrawal applications for liquidation/replenishment of the accounts. \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n49. \nThe  PMU  will  prepare  monthly  financial  statements  and  quarterly  progress  reports  that \ndetail the (i) physical and financial progress of activities against the targets, (ii) progress on the \ninstitutional and capacity aspects, (iii) issues affecting project implementation and their corrective \nmeasures,  and  (iv)  other  agreed  upon  monitoring  parameters.  WRD  will  also  prepare  a \ncomprehensive  annual  report.  WRD  will  submit  reports  to  ADB  and  the  Ministry  of  Water \nResources, Government of India no later than 1 month after the reporting period. Within 3 months \nof  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  Government  will  submit  a  comprehensive  project \ncompletion report in ADB\u2019s standard format with additional details as may be requested by ADB. \n\n50.  WRD,  with  PMU  assistance,  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  in  accordance \nwith  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  consistently  applied,  and  adequate  to  identify \ngoods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds;  the  expenditures  incurred  for  the  Project \nand subprojects; and use of local funds. These accounts and related financial statements will be \naudited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  standards  by  independent  auditors \nacceptable to ADB. The Government will submit to ADB consolidated annual audited reports and \nrelated  financial  statements  from  the  Project  within  9  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year. \nThe audit of the imprest account, SGIAs, and SOE will be carried out as part of the regular annual \naudit. The auditor\u2019s assessment of the examination relating to the imprest accounts, SGIAs, and \nSOE should be separately set out in the auditor\u2019s report. ADB may audit project accounts during \nreview missions. \n\n7. \n\nOperation and Maintenance \n\n51. \nThe  Project  ensures  increased  resources,  improved  capacity,  and  better  incentives  to \nsupport O&M. GOCG and ADB have discussed policy changes that will ensure a portion of the \nISF  (water  tax)  will  go  directly  to  the  WUAs  for  O&M  support.22  GOCG  has  assured  ADB  it  will \nreview current rates for irrigation service in light of the needs for O&M, and WUA and WRD cost \nsharing.  This  review  is  consistent  with  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  policy  on  rationalized \nrates for irrigation service. Under the Project, funds for O&M support will be provided to WUAs on \na declining basis for the first 3 years following R&U activities.23 As project funds diminish, WUA \nO&M support will increase through their share of the irrigation fee as service delivery improves, \nrabi  cropping  expands,  and  WUA  members  realize  the  benefits  from  their  O&M  support.  Since \ntheir  livelihoods  depend  on  irrigation  performance,  WUAs  have  a  greater  incentive  to  ensure \nadequate O&M.24 Increased rabi cropping will promote better O&M since less water is available \nduring  the  rabi  season  and  more  precise  water  control  is  required  for  rabi  crops.  WUAs  will \n\n                                                 \n22  Until such time that policy changes, the Government has committed to make payments to WUAs in accordance with \n\nthe existing policy of Rs40 per ha. \n\n23  Following R&U, WUAs will be given Rs90 per ha in the first year, Rs80 per ha in the second year, and Rs70 per ha in  \nthe third year to support O&M. For schemes developed late in the Project, the annual payments will be consolidated \nand disbursed to WUAs over the remaining time of the Project. \n\n24  It is anticipated that WRD will retain O&M responsibilities for the reservoir, head works, and large structures/canals, \nespecially  in  medium-size  systems.  In  some  minor  systems,  WUAs  may  essentially  assume  full  responsibility  for \nO&M. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nreceive  capacity  development  and  technical  support  for  O&M  and  be  required  to  create  O&M \nplans as a condition for R&U. \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n52.  Within 4 months of loan effectiveness, the PMU will establish performance monitoring and \nevaluation  (M&E)  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  M&E  parameters  will  be  developed  as  a \npart  of  the  project  administration  memorandum  (PAM)  with  assistance  from  ADB  and  the  M&E \nconsultants. The M&E system will be a critical component and will be developed in accordance \nwith  ADB's  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS).  Baseline  information  will  be \ncollected  as  part  of  the  subproject  feasibility  assessment  process.  Thereafter,  surveys  will  be \nconducted  annually.  The  scope  of  the  survey,  quantity  and  quality  of  data,  and  frequency  of \ncollection  will  be  guided  by  project  management  needs \nfeedback  on \nimplementation  status  and  early  warning  on  situations  that  might  jeopardize  development \nobjectives. Subproject monitoring will be conducted by the PMU, WRD, and WUAs, and reviewed \nand audited closely by ADB. \n\nfor  progressive \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\nimplementation  arrangements  are \n\nin  place  and  appropriate,  (ii)  assess  progress \n\nDuring the initial 3 years of the Project, ADB will carry out semiannual reviews to (i) determine \n53. \nif \nin \nimplementing institutional reforms and capacity development, (iii) review subproject selection and \nimplementation,  (iv)  ensure  ADB  safeguards,  and  (v)  assess  any  unforeseen  impacts.  By \nDecember  2008,  ADB,  the  Government  of  India,  and  GOCG  will  undertake  a  comprehensive \nmidterm  review  (MTR)  to  identify  problems  in  implementation  arrangements  and  define  needed \nchanges to achieve the project objectives. Two months before the MTR, WRD will submit to ADB \na  detailed  progress  report  on  project  implementation.  TOR  for  the  MTR  will  be  included  in  the \nPAM to be prepared by ADB\u2019s Inception Mission for the Project. \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n54. \nA  TA  for  capacity  development  will  be  financed  by  a  grant  from  the  Government  of  the \nUnited Kingdom to develop the capacity of (i) WUAs to assume responsibility for irrigation system \nmanagement and O&M, and (ii) WUAs and farmers to adopt diversified and rabi cropping. The TA \nwill  support  M&E  that  involves  all  stakeholders  with  a  focus  on  livelihood  impacts.  TA  activities \nwill  be  directly  integrated  with  the  Project  to  support  consultants  under  the  WUA  strengthening \nand  agricultural  support  services  project  components.  The  following  will  be  directly  or  indirectly \nsupported by the TA: (i) development of the WUACDP that will provide WUA training; (ii) training \nof trainers for contracted and WRD staff; (iii) development of the process for WUA participation in \nirrigation  system  R&U;  (iv)  strengthening  the  institutional  framework  of  PIM  and  WUAs;  (v)  a \ncapacity  development  program  to  assist  WUAs  and  farmers  with  improved  farm  practices;  and \n(vi) development of a comprehensive M&E program in accordance with the PPMS. The total TA \ncost  is  $2,375,000.  The  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  will  finance  $1.9  million  of  the  TA \ncost  on  a  grant  basis  to  be  administered  by  ADB.  GOCG  will  contribute  the  remaining  cost  of \n$475,000  equivalent  (in  kind  services).  The  detailed  costs,  financing  plan,  and  brief  description \nare in Appendix 11. TORs are in Supplementary Appendix C under Contract Package B. \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n55. \nThe overarching project benefit is increased agricultural productivity that will improve rural \nwell-being; in addition, many other benefits will accrue including improved capacity of WUAs for \nsustainable  O&M,  improved  capacity  of  WRD  for  irrigation  management  and  development,  and \nimproved capacity of farmers for increased production of rabi and diversified crops. \n \n\n\f15 \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits  \n\n56. \nThe primary economic benefits of the Project will stem from the R&U works to restore the \nirrigation  areas  that  farmers  can  effectively  use  to  at  least  90%  of  their  design  potential.  The \nProject  will  increase  kharif  production  by  restoring  the  productivity  of  command  areas  that \ncurrently  receive  no  irrigation  and  will  improve  effectiveness  in  areas  receiving  irrigation.  The \nProject  will  support  increased  rabi  cropping  due  to  the  improved  availability  and  control  of \nirrigation  water  from  R&U  works  and  management  changes.  Technical  criteria  for  subproject \nselection will maximize project benefits, and selection of schemes with effective WUAs will ensure \nsustainability of benefits. The PPTA prepared four core subprojects for R&U \u2013two minor schemes \nand two medium schemes\u2013 that yielded economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) ranging from \n13.7% to 33.4%. Under the Project, over 200,000 ha of land will receive R&U, resulting in a 50% \nincremental increase in kharif  paddy  production.  Rabi  paddy  cropping is  anticipated  to  increase \nby 350% from its present low base. Irrigation systems receiving R&U works will benefit 120,000 \nland-owing  households  or  600,000  people.  Financial  analysis  was  undertaken,  and  at  current \nprices, which will not be influenced by the Project, the average farm family should see additional \nannual  income  of  $180,  or  a  96%  increase  in  household  earnings  from  improved  yields.  Many \nmarginal and small farm families will consume a large portion of the increased production due to \nwidespread food insecurity in many communities. \n\n57. \nRepair of irrigation water storage sluice gates will generate immediate economic benefits \nand provide a much greater incentive for farmers to maintain and manage the rest of the irrigation \nsystem more effectively. Improved O&M and agriculture practices from the WUACDP throughout \nChhattisgarh,  along  with  a  stronger  PIM  framework,  will  provide  incremental  benefits  to  all \nirrigation  systems.  Analysis  of  the  overall  project  including  the  institutional  and  capacity \ndevelopment components yields an EIRR of 22.1% (Appendix 12). \n\nB. \n\nSocial and Other Benefits and Impacts \n\n58. \nSocial  Impacts.  Based  on  the  PPTA  findings,  over  half  the  farmers  who  will  receive \nbenefits are landless or small landholders with less than 1.5 ha. R&U and WUA management will \nprovide  water  and  benefits  to  tail-end  farmers  who  have  been  denied  irrigation  for  years.  For \nmany  marginal  farmers,  the  increase  in  production  will  increase  food  security  in  addition  to \nhousehold  income.  The  Project  will  benefit  an  estimated  15,000  landless  rural  households \nthrough a 60% increase in labor-days that will be generated mainly during the rabi season. The \nneed  for  families  to  go  out  of  Chhattisgarh  to  find  seasonal  employment,  which  is  common  in \nmany  areas,  will  be  reduced.  The  increase  in  irrigation  system  utilization  will  also  improve  the \nlivelihood of many sharecroppers who farm marginal lands in irrigation systems. \n\n59. \nImproved  Agricultural  Practices  and  Productivity.  The  Project  will  improve  water \nmanagement  and  agricultural  practices  of  farmers  to  increase  the  productivity  of  the  agriculture \nsector in Chhattisgarh. Irrigation systems that successfully develop rabi cropping are anticipated \nto diversify into higher value crops during the kharif season. Systems that adopt successful rabi \ncropping  techniques  will  provide  examples  to  neighboring  systems.  WUA  strengthening  will \ndevelop social capital that can be leveraged for involvement in input purchases, marketing, and \nother activities to enhance productivity and incomes. \n\nStrengthened  WRD.  Capacity  development,  enhanced \n\ntechnical  resources,  and \n60. \nimproved practice will not only support successful project implementation, but will have a catalytic \neffect to increase the development  impact of GOCG's own  substantial irrigation investment and \ncreate far greater impact on the sector as a whole than ADB's investment alone.  \n\n61. \nResettlement  and  Indigenous  Peoples.  The  new  SDU  along  with  the  project \nconsultants,  WRD  field  staff,  and  WUAs  will  address  social,  resettlement,  indigenous  persons, \n(Appendix  13  and \nenvironment,  and  economic  analysis  activities  under \n\nthe  Project \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nSupplementary  Appendixes  D  and  E).  The  SDU  will  manage  the  initial  social  and  poverty \nassessment for subprojects, which will be conducted by a contracted NGO. SDU will review the \ninitial social and poverty assessments and consult with the design and PIM units, WRD field staff, \nand  WUAs  to  determine  if  a  subproject  requires  a  resettlement  plan  (RP)  or  an  indigenous \npeoples development plan (IPDP).  Development of RPs and IPDPs will be supported by NGOs \nand  consultants  and  will  be  implemented  through  district-level  committees  comprising  the  SDU, \nWRD field staff, GOCG line agencies, affected people, local officials, and other stakeholders. The \nsubprojects are not expected to generate substantial resettlement or indigenous peoples' impacts \nsince project interventions are limited to R&U for minor and medium irrigation schemes. \n\n62. \nEnvironmental  Impacts.  Environmental  impacts  from  the  Project  are  not  anticipated  to \nbe significant. The PPTA prepared an initial environmental examination (IEE) for each of the four \nsubprojects  and  for  the  entire  Project  including  each  of  the  four  components  (Appendix  14  and \nSupplementary  Appendix  F).  The  IEE  for  the  core  subprojects  did  not  predict  impacts  of \nsignificance either during R&U construction, or after subproject completion. The IEE for the entire \nProject  concluded  that  all  the  components  should  provide  substantial  environmental  benefits  in \nthe medium to long term except for R&U, which is not anticipated to create any negative impacts. \nThe  IEE  for  the  subproject  Balar  irrigation  scheme,  along  with  the  environmental  assessment \nreview  procedures,  provide  an  environmental  framework  to  guide  WRD  and  the  SDU  in  the \nenvironmental  assessment  of  subprojects.  An  IEE  will  be  carried  out  for  subprojects  and,  if \nneeded,  mitigating  measures  implemented.  An  environmental  monitoring  plan  (EMP)  will  be \nprepared for each subproject that will be supported through participation by SDU, WRD field staff, \nand WUAs. The Project has adequate budget dedicated to support development of EMPs and will \nprovide  consultant  support  (i)  for  capacity  development  for  WRD,  SDU,  and  WUAs;  and  (ii)  to \nassist in preparing IEEs and EMPs. \n\nC. \n\nRisks \n\n63. \nInadequate  O&M.  Unless  a  systemic  change  takes  place  in  irrigation  management  and \npractices, a risk is that O&M will not be adequate to ensure that subproject benefits are sustained \nafter  R&U  works.  The  Project  has  adopted  substantial  measures  to  ensure  that  O&M  will  be \nsustained through institutional reforms; intensive WUA capacity development for O&M; improved \nresources  and  transitional  project  O&M  funds;  and  an  improved  incentive  structure  for  O&M  by \nWUAs in systems that receive the R&U works. \n\n64. \nFailure  to  Develop  Sustainable  WUAs.  Improving  the  capacity  and  effectiveness  of \nWUAs  is  critical  to  (i)  ensure  O&M  and  subproject  benefits  are  sustained,  (ii)  improve  irrigation \nsystem operation and water management, and (iii) create an effective entry point for delivery of \nagricultural  support  services  and  facilitate  change  in  cropping  practice.  A  risk  is  that  effective \nWUAs may not be formed. Intensive capacity development, project funds to help establish WUAs, \nand  agricultural  support  services  will  support  the  WUAs  as  they  coalesce  into  effective \norganizations.  The  strengthened  institutional  framework,  improved  resources,  and  capacity \ndevelopment will ensure the foundation for effective WUAs. The resulting benefits from increased \nagricultural productivity will provide a natural stimulus for farmers to participate and contribute to \nthe sustainability of the WUAs. \n\nLess-than-Expected  Incremental  Benefits.  Project  benefits  assume  the  ability  of \n65. \nmarkets to support incremental production and farmers' willingness to expand rabi cropping. The \ntotal  incremental  rice  output  expected  from  the  Project  will  be  widely  distributed  and  modest \nrelative  to  present  production  (<4%  of  Chhattisgarh  and  <0.2%  of  India),  and  no  market-\ndampening  price  impacts  are  expected.  Steady  rice  demand  in  neighboring  MP\u2015prior  to \nbifurcation,  Chhattisgarh  produced  70%  of  all  rice  in  MP\u2015and  nearby  states,  increasing \nurbanization,  and  improved  transport  will  assure  market  access.  Much  of  the  increased \nproduction will be consumed locally due to widespread food insecurity as evidenced by the fact \n\n\f17 \n\nthat  69%  of  the  households  surveyed  during  project  preparation  kept  a  large  portion  their \nproduction  for  home  consumption.  A  risk  is  that  project  interventions  may  not  be  able  to \novercome the constraints to the adoption of rabi crops. The largest constraint to rabi cropping is \nunreliable irrigation, which is the central focus of the Project. Advisors on irrigated agriculture in \nthe  PIM  Unit  will  facilitate  improved  use  of  inputs  and  identify  market  opportunities.  The  project \napproach  is  to  support  demonstration  and  pilot  activities,  educate  farmers  to  take  advantage  of \nexisting resources, and strengthen the existing linkages for inputs and markets. \n\n66. \nDelays  in  Reform.  The  Project  integrates  institutional  reform  as  an  important  means  to \nattain  development  objectives  and  ensure  their  sustainability.  A  risk  exists  in  that  the \nimplementation of the reform agenda may be delayed. GOCG sensitization and substantial policy \ndialogue  regarding  PIM,  WUAs,  and  WRD  reforms  have  been  ongoing  throughout  project \npreparation. A national  workshop on PIM held  in Raipur,  WRD seminars, a study tour for WRD \nofficials to other Indian states, and consultant support to prepare a revised PIM Act were all part \nof project preparation. Crucial activities under the Project will be to continue the policy dialogue, \nassure  effective  implementation  of  irrigation  management  transfer  to  WUAs,  and  improve \nirrigation performance, which will solidify beneficiary and GOCG support for the reforms. Even if a \nrevised  PIM  Act  is  not  approved,  many  reforms  can  be  achieved  within  the  existing  legal \nframework.  In  the  absence  of  any  reforms,  project  R&U  works  supported  by  WUA  capacity \ndevelopment will still provide substantial benefits due to improved irrigation sector performance. \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  GOCG  have  given  the \n\n67. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nGOCG  will  ensure  timely  availability  of  staff,  land,  facilities,  and  funds  for  costs \nassociated with safeguard compliances under the Project. \nGOCG  will  ensure  all  necessary  steps  are  taken  for  early  consideration  and \nenactment of the amended PIM Act by the state legislature; and within 6 months \nthereof, prepare rules and regulations under the Act and enforce the same in the \nsubsequent financial year starting 1 April. \nAmong  other  provisions,  the  amended  PIM  Act  will  include  (a)  transfer  of  O&M \nresponsibilities  to  WUAs;  (b)  WUAs to  be  provided  on  a  timely  basis  (at  least  on \nseasonal basis) with an adequate portion of the water tax for O&M; (c) improved \nrepresentation  of  one  or  more  WUAs  per  irrigation  system  for  all  systems  above \n200 ha, and one for those below 200 ha where practicable; (d) restructuring of the \noffices,  term  of  office,  and  subcommittees;  (e)  adoption  of  measures  to  ensure \nwomen's participation and effective contribution to the structures and processes set \nforth  in  the  PIM  Act,  as  provided  in  Section  D  (Gender  and  Development)  of \nAppendix 2; and (f) audit of accounts maintained by WUAs. \nGOCG will ensure that the Amended PIM Act is drafted and validated through an \niterative, consultative process including all relevant stakeholders. \nBefore the midterm review of the Project, in consonance with Government policies \non  rationalized  ISF  (water  tax),  GOCG  will  review  the  current  ISF  and  make \nappropriate  adjustments  based  on  the  needs  for  O&M  and  cost  sharing  of  the \nwater tax between WRD and WUAs. \nFor  the  R&U  subprojects,  GOCG  will  ensure  (a)  transfer  of  O&M  to  WUAs  with \nadequate capacity, to be jointly reviewed by ADB, GOCG, WRD, and WUAs; (b) at \nleast  one  dedicated  WUA  responsible  for  one  subproject;  (c)  transfer  of  O&M  to \nWUAs under standard contracts specifying roles, responsibilities, maintenance of \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nproper  accounts  (for  O&M  and  other  funds  received),  and  authority  for  irrigation \nmanagement and O&M; and (d) adequate funding for O&M through timely sharing \nwith WUAs of water tax collections, grants, or other measures. \n\n(vii)  GOCG  will  ensure  that  agreed  staff  in  relevant  units  are  in  place  before  starting \nR&U works and subprojects; that R&U subprojects of minor irrigation systems will \nbe approved not later than 1 year and that of medium irrigation systems not later \nthan 2 years before project completion, respectively. \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  GOCG will follow the criteria for R&U subproject selection as indicated in Appendix \n5;  and  any  deviations  will  need  prior  approval  from  ADB.  Unless  otherwise \nrequired,  the  first  five  R&U  subprojects  in  each  of  the  CE  zones  will  need  prior \napproval of ADB. ADB may also conduct random audit of the subprojects. \nGOCG will ensure that (a) the Project, particularly selection, design, construction, \nsupervision, implementation, and monitoring of the R&U works and subprojects is \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  involuntary  resettlement, \nindigenous  peoples,  and  environment  as  detailed  in  the  respective  frameworks; \nand  (b)  all mitigation  and  monitoring  measures  under  related  IEE  and  EMP  (with \nbudget) are incorporated and implemented in design (including detailed designs), \nconstruction, monitoring, and implementation of civil works under R&U schemes.  \nGOCG will ensure an extensive process for WUA and community participation to \npromote acceptance of the Project; subproject selection, design, construction, and \noperational monitoring; and also adequate public and stakeholder information and \nconsultation in complying with the safeguard policies of ADB. \n\n(x) \n\n(xi)  WRD  through  the  bid  documents  and  civil  works  contracts  will  ensure  that \ncontractors  (a)  comply  with  all  applicable  labor  laws  and  follow  legally  mandated \nprovisions  on  health,  sanitation,  and  appropriate  working  conditions  under  the \nlaws; (b) do not employ child labor; (c) provide equal opportunities for women; \n(d)  provide  equal  pay  for  equal  work  for  men  and  women  labor;  and  (e)  ensure \nmonitoring of compliance with these provisions and provide for termination of any \ncontract in case of noncompliance. \n\n(xii)  GOCG will implement measures to maximize impacts on women under the Project \n\n(para. 36 and Section D\u2013Gender and Development\u2013 of Appendix 2).  \n\n(xiii)  GOCG  will  review  existing  WRD  planning  and  development  practice  so  that  new \nirrigation  investment  targeted  at  tank  schemes  with  a  potential  of  1,000  ha  and \nabove  will  have  the  capability  for  at  least  40%  cropping  intensity  in  rabi  season \nbased  on  75%  dependable  rainfall.  The  review  and  recommended  guidelines  will \nbe accomplished by year 5 of the Project. \n\n(xiv)  GOCG  will  have  prepared  a  complete  inventory  of  all  minor  irrigation  schemes \nusing  the  Pre-planning:  Rapid  Assessment  Data  Sheet  for  Completed  Minor  and \nMedium Schemes provided by ADB to GOCG by December 2006. \n\nB. \n\n68. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nLoan effectiveness will be subject to the following conditions: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthrough  WRD  will  have  designated  counterpart  staff  required \n\nGOCG \noperationalizing the PMU as detailed in Supplementary Appendix B. \nGOCG  will  have  approved  the  new  units  for  WRD  with  staff  as  detailed  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \nGOCG  will  have  prepared  a  complete  inventory  of  minor  tank  irrigation  schemes \nwith  a  potential  of  200  ha  or  above  using  the  Pre-planning:  Rapid  Assessment \nData Sheet for Completed Minor Schemes provided by ADB to GOCG. \n\nfor \n\n\f19 \n\n(iv) \n\nThe consultants under the PIM component, for undertaking WUA training and for \nundertaking amendments to the PIM Act under the TA, shall have been selected \nand ready to be mobilized. \n\nC. \n\n69. \n\nConditions for Award of Civil Works Contracts for R&U Schemes \n\nAward of civil works contracts for R&U schemes will be subject to the following conditions: \n\nLand  acquisition  and/or  resettlement  plan  and  indigenous  peoples  development  plan \nprepared  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  upon  frameworks  and  disclosed  to  affected \npersons and approved by ADB with compensation payments as required under the plan \nare completed for related subprojects. \nThe  draft  Amended  PIM  Act  will  have  been  submitted  to  the  Chhattisgarh \nLegislative  Assembly  for  consideration  prior  to  award  for  all  civil  works  contracts \nexcepting the pilot subprojects. \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n70. \nAsian Development Bank and recommend that the Board approve  \n\nthe  loan  of  $46,108,000  to  India  for  the  Chhattisgarh  Irrigation  Development \nProject  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term of 25 years, including \na grace period of 7 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreements \npresented to the Board; and \nthe administration by ADB of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of \n$1,900,000 to the Government of India for Water Users Association Empowerment \nfor  Improved  Irrigation  Management  in  Chhattisgarh  to  be  provided  by  the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom on a grant basis. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n1 March 2005\n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \nDesign \nSummary \nGoal \nImprove rural livelihoods \nand reduce rural poverty \n \n\nPurpose \n1.

In  Chhattisgarh,  the  majority  of  the \npopulation  is  poor,  with  the  highest  concentration  of  poverty  in  rural  areas  where  80%  of  the  residents  of \nChhattisgarh  live  and  are  employed  mainly  in  agricultural  activities.  An  estimated  43%  of  the  state\u2019s \npopulation  live  below  the  poverty  line,  and  a  similar  proportion  of  the  rural  population  lack  access  to \nelectricity, clean water, or sanitation. Landless and marginal farmers and farm laborers make up over 80% of \nthe rural poor. Of the state's population, 45% are members of scheduled tribes and scheduled castes, with an \nestimated 57% of them living below the poverty line. Many farmers in Chhattisgarh have small and marginal \nlandholdings.  Medium-size  farms  (2-4  hectares  [ha])  and  large  (>4  ha)  farms  account  for  over  70%  of \nagricultural land in Chhattisgarh, but are owned by only 28% of farm families, while 72% have landholdings of \nless  than  2  ha.  Irrigated  agriculture  provides  an  important  means  to  raise  incomes  and  living  standards  for \nmany  farmers,  especially  the  poor  and  marginal  ones  with  smallholdings.  Yields  from  irrigated  lands  are \nhigher than those from rain-fed areas, and irrigation often provides the opportunity for a second crop, which \ngives  large  benefits  over  rain-fed  farming.  In  the  case  of  Chhattisgarh,  irrigated  agriculture  also  provides \ntremendous  benefits  for  landless  laborers  employed  in  agricultural  production.  Importantly,  a  second  crop \nreduces the pressure for seasonal migration of families due to under employment during the rabi season. \n \n\n \nPoverty Analysis  \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted Intervention\nB. \nThe usual activity status of people in the project area shows that just over 46% of the total population come \nunder  the  category  of  workers.  Among  the  workers  over  80%  are  either  cultivators  or  agriculture  laborers. \nIrrigation  increases  and  stabilizes  the  production  of  rabi  crops,  ensuring  food  and  income  for  marginal \nfarmers,  small  farmers,  sharecroppers,  and  agriculture  labor.  Small  and  marginal  holdings  account  for  over \n72%  of  the  total  operational  landholding  in  the  state,  and  the  average  landholding  of  marginal  and  small \nfarmers is 0.40 ha and 1.30 ha, respectively. In the absence of reliable irrigation facilities, agriculture depends \nentirely  on  the  monsoon  rains  and,  nearly  94%  of  the  farmers  practice  subsistence  agriculture  and  opt  for \nmonocropping, raising paddy for consumption. There is negligible marketable surplus of agricultural produce \nto  enable  them  to  buy  any  other  goods.  Use  of  fertilizer  is  low  in  the  state  (65  kilograms  [kg]  per  acre), \ncompared with other parts of the country (140\u2013160 kg per acre). Average per capita annual income at current \nprices in the project area is Rs12,052 per year ($273.9 per year). Income distribution is highly skewed and is \ncorrelated to landownership pattern and access to resources. The top 5% have an income share of 70% and \nthe  bottom  95%  have  an  income  share  of  only  30%.  The  initial  survey  carried  out  in  four  core  subprojects \nrevealed that three fifths of households earn less than Rs6,000 per year and 37% earn between Rs6,000 and \nRs18,000 per year. Among cultivators, over 40% borrow money from moneylenders and around 45% obtain \ncredit  from  government  agencies  for  agriculture  operations.  The  poor  depend  on  wage  labor  for  survival; \nhowever, labor opportunities are limited due to single cropping. Many migrate to nearby cities or work, 40% in \nsome  communities.  Seasonal  out-migration  to  nearby  towns  and  big  cities  in  search  of  jobs  is  part  of  the \nsurvival strategy of the poor. \n \nConsumption  patterns  show  that  nearly  45%  of  the  total  expenditure  is  on  food,  around  33%  on  water \ncharges,  and  a  little  over  21%  on  agriculture  inputs.  Expenses  on  education  and  health  are  less  than  1%. \nMost  households  (90%)  live  in  temporary  houses  (mud  walls  and  thatched/tiled  roof).  Over  half  of  the \npopulation  is  illiterate,  and  caloric  intake  is  inadequate.  Their  diet  lacks  protein,  necessary  minerals,  and \nvitamins,  contributing  to  incidence  of  numerous  diseases  particularly  among  infants,  children,  and  women. \nThe  non-availability  of  safe  drinking  water  is  a  perennial  source  of  waterborne  diseases  such  as  cholera, \ndiarrhea, and jaundice. The tropical climate and prevalent unhygienic conditions breed mosquitoes that cause \nmalaria. Villagers have limited access or means to visit qualified medical practitioners. \n \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \n\n \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nStakeholders Analysis: \nTo help identify four core subprojects, focus group discussions were held in \nfour  core  subproject  areas  with  villagers  including  women  and  other  vulnerable  people.  In-depth  interviews \nwere held with officials at village, block, district and state levels. The triangulation method was used to cross-\ncheck information collected from the community.   \n    \nProject  Participation  Strategy:  Participation  is  key  to  successful  implementation  of  any  development \nscheme,  particularly  when  changes  in  knowledge,  attitude,  and  practices  are  involved.  The  participation \nstrategy involves systematically deciding who will be engaged, in what manner and at what time. The primary \npurpose  is  to  promote  transparency,  success,  and  sustainability,  and  prevent  delays  and  manage  conflicts. \nThe  activities  supported  under  the  loan  will  focus  on  empowering  water  users  associations  (WUAs)  in \ngovernance  of  irrigation  systems.  Irrigation  field  staff  and  contracted  nongovernment  organization/training \ninstitutions  will  assist  in  establishing  and  strengthening  WUA.  WUAs  will  prepare  cropping  plans,  enter  into \nirrigation  management  agreements  with  the  Water  Resource  Department,  take  over  governance  of  the \nscheme, and undertake operation and maintenance and improvement activities on a cost-sharing basis.  \n \n \nD.            Gender and Development \n  \nStrategy to Maximize Impacts on Women \nThe Project includes measures to ensure that beneficial impacts on women are maximized. Under the revised \nparticipatory irrigation management policies, the following institutional changes will be made: (i) membership \nto the WUA will be on a household basis so that both men and women will be members and have the right to \nattend meetings and cast votes; and (ii) all women who are part of a household that is a WUA member will be \nable to stand for election (not just women who are property owners with a title) and hold office on the WUA \nmanagement  committee  and  any  subcommittee.  The  WUA  subcommittee  structure  will  also  ensure  that \nwomen  will be represented in WUA activities. The management committee  will be required to  have at least \ntwo  women  officers  who  either  are  elected  under  the  general  election  or  are  nominated  by  the  gender \nsubcommittee. Each WUA will have a gender subcommittee that will have the following mandate: (i) address \nthe needs of women title holders and WUA members, and women farm laborers in the irrigation system; (ii) \ndevelop and protect the use of and access to irrigation water for alternative purposes such as home gardens, \nlivestock,  washing,  and  other  domestic  uses;  and  (iii)  create  capacity  development  and  livelihood  programs \nespecially  targeting  women.  In  addition  to  the  gender  subcommittee,  women  will  have  at  least  33%  target \nrepresentation  on  the  other  subcommittees  that  will  be  formed  in  every  WUAs,  including  (i)  the  water \nallocation  and  distribution  committee,  (ii)  the  dispute  resolution  committee,  and  (iii)  and  the  financial  audit \ncommittee.  Women  subcommittee  members  will  be  encouraged  to  attend  the  training  offered  through  the \nparticipatory  irrigation  management  unit  for  WUA  and  33%  of  the  training  slots  will  be  initially  reserved  for \nwomen. For general training offered to all WUA members, 50% of the slots will initially be reserved for women \nWUA members. Women heads of households will receive priority in services provided to farmers through the \nProject.  The  WUA  gender  activities  and  (sub)  committees  will  build  from  the  base  of  members  in  the \nGovernment of India's Ministry of Rural Development program \u2013 Development of Women and Child in Rural \nAreas  \u2013  that  has  existing  committees  in  villages  throughout  India.  In  all  activities  supported  through  project \nfunds,  it  will  be  stipulated  that  women  will  receive  equal  pay  for  equal  work  and  will  be  part  of  contractual \nobligations. The Project will require that PIM Unit staff have at least 20% women contracted through project \nfunds  by  year  3  of  the  project  and  10%  initially.  The  PIM  unit  staff  will  have  at  least  10%  women  trainers \n(consultants and nongovernment organizations) in the first year to increase to 20% no later than year 3 of the \nProject. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \n \n \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n\f \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nimpact  on \n\nresettlement  or \n\nimplementation  mechanisms \n\n \nThe  Project  will  support  the  sustainable  operations  of \nirrigation  infrastructure  in  subproject  schemes  through \nan  intensive  participatory  process.  None  of  the  four \ncore  subprojects  studied  during  project  preparation \nentail  any  land  acquisition  or  involve  any  resettlement \nor  impact  any  tribal  community.  A  large  number  of \nadditional schemes will be selected for project support, \nbut  few  of  them  are  expected  to  have  any  land \ntribal \nacquisition, \ncommunities.  A  resettlement  framework  has  been \nthe  policy,  principles, \nprepared,  which  sets  out \nprocedures,  and \nto \nadequately  address  the  issues  of  land  acquisition, \nresettlement,  and  impact  on  vulnerable  people  if  they \noccur during project implementation. \n \nThe  economic  and  financial  analyses  indicate  that  the \nProject  and  subprojects  should  provide  substantial \nfinancial and economic benefits to farm families with a \nrise in income of about 96%. Landless laborers should \nalso  benefit  from  the  additional  labor-days  generated \nby the Project. \n \nThe  Project \nto  create  employment \nopportunities not only during the construction stage but \nalso  in  the  post  project  scenario.  With  improved \nirrigation facilities, even marginal and small farmers will \nhave for multiple cropping opportunities and will create \nemployment  opportunities \nlabor. \nRehabilitation  and  upgrading  works  should  provide \ntemporary employment for unskilled workers. \n \nAs  per  the  study  conducted  in  four  pilot  schemes,  the \nProject  will  not  adversely  affect  any  tribal  group  or \nrequire  preparation  of  a  separate  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment plan (IPDP).  However, if any tribal group \nis affected in the later stage of project implementation, \nan  IPDP  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank's  (ADB)  Policy  on \nIndigenous \nPeoples.

Chhattisgarh  separated  from  Madhya  Pradesh  (MP)  on  25  August  2000 \n1. \nwith the passage of the MP Reorganization Act of 2000. Chhattisgarh is the ninth largest state, \nbut ranks 17th in population with just over 21 million inhabitants. Chhattisgarh is rich in natural \nresources  and  retains  44%  of  forest  cover,  which  supports  livelihood  activities,  especially  for \ntribal  residents.  The  agriculture  sector  contributes  about  a  third  of  Chhattisgarh's  economic \noutput,  but  has  been  declining  in  recent  years.  Underperformance  in  the  irrigated  agriculture \nsector  relates  to  the  high  concentration  of  poverty  in  rural  areas  where  80%  of  Chhattisgarh's \nresidents live and are employed in agricultural activities. \n\nOverview  of  WRD.  The  Water  Resources  Department  (WRD)  of  the  Government  of \n2. \nChhattisgarh (GOCG) was created by the MP Irrigation Act of 1931. According to its mandate, \nWRD  is  responsible  for  planning,  development,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of \nirrigation schemes; collection of water tariffs; monitoring groundwater; allocating water for bulk \nuse; and surface water regulation. WRD has a staff about 750 college-trained engineers and a \ntotal staff of 3,500 as well as numerous contractual employees. The jurisdiction of WRD is under \nfour  chief  engineers:  one  for  the  Mahanadi  Reservoir  Project,  and  three  others  that  oversee \nnumerous  projects  in  their  respective  zones.  Below  this  level,  WRD  is  divided  into  divisional \noffices  headed  by  an  executive  engineer  with  about  60  divisional  offices  throughout  the  state. \nWRD develops and manages major (greater than 10,000 ha), medium (2,000\u201310,000 ha), and \nminor (40\u20132,000 ha) irrigation schemes. Currently, about 1.3 million ha of irrigated lands exist, \nwith  0.8  million  ha  in  completed  systems  and  0.5  million  ha  in  systems  with  ongoing \ndevelopment  (Table  A3).  Once  the  ongoing  schemes  are  fully  completed,  an  additional  0.3 \nmillion  ha  will  be  added  to  the  existing  irrigated  area.  WRD  estimates  that  almost  3  million \nadditional  ha  could  be  developed  for  a  total  of  4.3  million  ha.  Currently,  Chhattisgarh's \ndeveloped irrigation potential about half of India's national average.1 \n\n3. \nWhen MP bifurcated giving rise to Chhattisgarh, Chhattisgarh did not receive the same \nquantity  or  quality  of  resources  that  remained  in  MP.  WRD  contracts  out  many  technical \nfunctions and designs for most civil works larger than those for minor schemes, and improved \ntechnical  expertise  for  design  and  execution  of  minor  schemes  would  be  beneficial.  However, \nWRD  does  have  a  cadre  of  experienced  engineers  that  have  managed  many  projects,  and \nWRD will be adding over 360,000 ha of new irrigated area during the current 5-year plan. Like \nmany irrigation departments, WRD is construction-oriented, and economic analysis and system \nmanagement,  operations,  and  especially  maintenance  activities  may  not  be  addressed  to  the \ndegree  necessary  to  maximize  and  sustain  irrigation  benefits.  WRD  would  benefit  from \nupgrading  of  administrative  procedures,  improved  data  management  systems,  and  enhanced \nuse of information technology. WRD has established procedures for tendering, contracting, and \nexecuting civil works, and systems are in place for developing and administering over 1 million \nha  of  irrigated  area.  WRD  executes  projects  using  different  Government  funding  sources  and \nhas accounting measures in place to track different funds. WRD must also comply with rules for \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  using  GOCG  procedures  and  must  obtain  project  clearance \nfrom the Forestry Department.2 \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  Chhattisgarh has an estimated 60,000 tubewells that irrigate nearly 200,000 ha. Chhattisgarh is estimated to have \na  total  of  11,960  million  cubic  meters  of  groundwater  available  for  development,  which  provides  substantial \nadditional irrigation potential. Farmers have installed well over 90% of the tubewells using private funds. \n\n2  An in-depth institutional analysis took place during project preparation. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n27 \n\nTable A3: Existing Irrigation Capacity and Its Utilization in Chhattisgarh (thousand ha) \n \nCompleted  \nSystems \n\nOngoing  \nSystems \n\nSystem  \nType \n\nMajor \n\nMedium \n\nMinor \n\n3 \n\n29 \n\n1,981 \n\n4 \n\n7 \n\n377 \n\nExisting  \nDesign  \nPotential \n\n594 \n\n268 \n\n478 \n\nTotal \nNote: Exact figures for the total number of minor schemes are unreliable.  \nSource: Water Resources Department (2001) and Central Water Commission.   \n\n2,013 \n\n1,340 \n\n388 \n\n \nWhile  WRD's  basic  capacities  for  irrigation  management  and  development  exist,  their \n4. \neffectiveness  and  the  resulting  development  impact  of  irrigation  could  be  improved  with \nupgrading  of  procedures  and  modernization  of  skills.  Technical  capacity,  especially  for \ndevelopment  of  minor  schemes,  could  be  improved.  Many  of  the  current  design  criteria  and \noperational  procedures  date  from  the  British  period.  The  development  of  proficiency  for \neconomic  analysis,  social  assessment  and  vulnerable  persons \nissues,  environmental \nassessment,  and  creation  of  effective  water  users  associations  (WUAs)  would  result  in  more \neffective  irrigation  development  in  line  with  current  international  best  practice.  The  greatest \nsector  issue,  however,  is  inadequate  attention  and  resources  for  system  O&M,  and  systemic \ninstitutional changes are required to address this problem. \n\n5. \nCurrent Status of Irrigation Development. Increasing the productivity of agriculture is \nvital to the overall development of Chhattisgarh's economy, improvement in rural livelihood, and \npoverty reduction. Expansion of irrigation is a primary strategy of GOCG to increase agricultural \nproductivity.  GOCG's  5-Year  Plan  (FYP)  has  allocated  approximately  $500  million  to  water \nresources and irrigation development from 2002 to 2007. The amount represents over 20% of \nGOCG\u2019s  development  expenditures  for  a  planned  expansion  of  360,000  ha  during  the  current \nFYP. The FYP contains WRD's development policy that includes the following objectives: (i) create \na master plan for water resources, (ii) improve packages for resettlement and land acquisition, \n(iii)  evaluate  and  provide  safety  measures  for  dams  and  canals,  (iv)  ensure  active  farmer \nparticipation  in  the  management  of  irrigation  systems,  (v)  rationalize  water  rates,  (vi)  develop \nand manage groundwater, (vii) develop and conserve water resources in drought\u2013prone areas \nand, (viii) provide regular training for WRD staff. WRD, however, would benefit from enhanced \nresources  and  skills,  and  assistance  in  formulating  action  plans  and  developing  capacity  to \nimplement much of the irrigation development policy. \n\n6. \nNotwithstanding  GOCG's  investment,  irrigation  systems  perform  poorly.  Improved \nirrigation development, management, and O&M are essential to support rabi (dry season) and \ndiversified  cropping.  The  current  cropping  intensity  in  Chhattisgarh  is  about  120%  compared \nwith  Punjab's  183%.  Existing  irrigation  systems  in  Chhattisgarh  perform  much  below  their \npotential. Utilization3 is less than 50% for minor schemes, 50 to 60% for medium schemes, and \nabout 75% for major schemes.4 Two thirds of minor schemes have a utilization ratio of less than \n50%,  one  third  have  less  than  30%,  and  some  minor  schemes  irrigate  less  than  10%  of  the \ndesign area.  \n\n7. \nThis  low  performance  is  largely  a  result  of  inadequate  water  management,  insufficient \nO&M,  associated  system  deterioration  due  to  inadequate  funds,  and,  ultimately,  lack  of \n\n                                                 \n3  Utilization  is  the  ratio  of  area  of  the  irrigation  system  receiving  irrigation  water  relative  to  the  potential  of  the \n\ndesigned command area. \n\n4  Data is uncertain. Figures are based on analysis of over 800 schemes during project preparation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nownership  and  participation  by  farmers.  Over  80%  of  WRD's  operating  costs  go  toward \nestablishment with little funds actually going to the for O&M activities or to the WUAs.5 GOCG's \ncollection of the irrigation service fee (ISF) averages 20\u201325% in most years and is inadequate \nfor  O&M.  Many  farmers  do  not  pay  the  ISF  because  they  do  not  see  satisfactory  delivery  of \nirrigation  water  and  there  is  no  evidence  that  the  ISF  results  in  improved  O&M  or  service \ndelivery. WRD does not have the staff or resources to develop and implement O&M guidelines \nin  many  systems  or  to  inspect,  prioritize,  and  execute  maintenance  activities.  In  addition, \nfarmers, especially head reach farmers, often make unauthorized turnouts in irrigation systems \nand  take  water  beyond  their  allocation.  Tail  end  farmers  have  little  recourse  to  address  the \nsituation, and WRD is often ineffective or unengaged in redressing these problems. \n\nB. \n\nAgriculture \n\nOverview  of  Agriculture  in  Chhattisgarh.  Chhattisgarh  has  three  distinct  agro-\n8. \necological  zones  with  differing  annual  rainfall:  the  northern  hill  zone  (2.85  million  ha;  1,250\u2013\n1,725 millimeters [mm] of rainfall); the central Chhattisgarh plains zone (7.49 million ha; 1,300\u2013\n1,600  mm);  and  the  southern  Bastar  plateau  zone  (3.26  million  ha;  1,200\u20131,600  mm).  Ninety \npercent of Chhattisgarh's annual rainfall occurs in the roughly 90 day monsoon period (the wet \ngrowing  season)  from  mid-June  through  October.  Chhattisgarh's  rice  production  varies \nsignificantly  with  rainfall  and  has  recently  varied  between  2.9  and  5.9  million  ton  (t).  Paddy \nproduction accounts for about 75% of annual cropping, or about 4.0 million out of 4.8 million ha \nof the net sown area with only 23% of the area irrigated. The average rice yield in the state is \nlower  than  India's  national,  average  with  little  more  than  1  ton  per  ha  (t/ha)  for  rain-fed  rice. \nIrrigated  rice  averages  about  2.5  t/ha  (2\u20134  t/ha),  depending  on  inputs  and  varieties.  India's \nnational average is closer to 4.0 t. Apart from  paddy in kharif season, farmers grow about 0.5 \nmillion  ha  of  pulses,  over  0.2  million  ha  of  oilseed  crops, as  well  as  maize,  millet, vegetables, \nand  other  crops  that  also  have  lower  yields  than  national  averages.  Little  irrigated  agriculture \ntakes place during rabi season. \n\nPolicies. As part of its Vision 20126 strategic plan formulated in 2002, Chhattisgarh has \n9. \nset the following goals for improved productivity of agriculture and allied sectors: (i) increase the \ncontribution of agriculture to the state economy by over 50% during the next 10 years; (ii) reorient \nthe  current  cropping  pattern  in  Chhattisgarh;  (iii)  move  from  single  cropping  to  multiple \ndiversified  cropping  with  focus  on  cash  crops;7  (iv)  increase  yields  in  line  with  the  proposed \nincrease  in  cropping  intensity  (200%  target);  and  (v)  put  greater  emphasis  on  development  of \nallied  sectors.  Developing  and  implementing  an  action  plan  to  achieve  these  objectives  will \nrequire  support  since  capacity  in  the  agriculture  sector  needs  strengthening.  Increasing  the \nproductivity  of  irrigated  agriculture  is  necessary  to  achieve  these  productivity  goals  of  the \nagriculture sector as a whole. \n\n10. \nChhattisgarh  has  the  ability  to  address  some  agricultural  policies  regarding  agency \nreforms and public investment, but the Government of India controls many pricing, subsidy, and \nother policies that influence agriculture. India has made some progress in removing restrictions \non  private  sector  investment  in  handling  commodities  and  more  open  interstate  trade.  The \nGovernment,  through  the  Food  Corporation  of  India,  procures  rice  and  wheat  along  side  the \nprivate market with a minimum support price (MSP) to (i) assure farmers of reasonable income, \nand (ii) to sell it at a subsidized price through the Targeted Public Distribution System to ensure \nfood security for the poor. In 2000, the MSP was 40\u201350% higher than production costs in some \n\n                                                 \n5  In one district it was reported that no funds were available for any O&M over a 5-year period during the 1990s. \n6  Vision 2012 is a planning document prepared with consultant assistance by the GOCG administration in 2002. \n7   India's agriculture sector diversified significantly during the 1990s, led mainly by the western and southern states. \n\nThose states with the greatest diversification also saw the highest agricultural growth rates. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nstates. The MSP has led to large national buffer stocks and distortions in cropping practice, but \nthe  distribution  of  the  subsidy  and  its  impacts  have  not  been  uniform.  It  has  tended  to  benefit \nlarger  farmers  in  some  select  states  with  intensive  agriculture  that  continue  to  lobby  for \nincreased  MSP.  Poorer  states  including  MP  have  not  benefited  significantly,  with  limited  MSP \nsupport  found  there.  In  Chhattisgarh,  farmers  have  noted  little  permanent  difference  between \nprivate  and  state  market  prices,  which  are  close  to  the  world  price.  India  has  indicated  its \nintention to rationalize fertilizer prices at the beginning of the decade with complete decontrol of \nurea by 2006. Overall, these national policies do not have substantial distortionary impacts on \nagriculture in Chhattisgarh relative to the rest of India. \n\n11. \nThe  Farm  System.  Agricultural  practices  need  strengthening,  especially  for  diversified \nand  rabi  cropping.  Many  farmers  are  inexperienced  in  growing  anything  but  kharif  rice.  Long-\nmaturing rice varieties are often used. They are planted late and require watering well beyond \nthe  end  of  the  monsoon,  taking  water  that  could  be  available  for  rabi  crops  if  more  timely \nplanting and shorter-maturing varieties were used. Livestock often eat rabi crops, which can be \nremedied  in  a  variety  of  ways  with  cooperation  and  orientation  of  farm  communities  to  rabi \ncropping. The Department of Agriculture (DA) extension service does not have the capacity to \neffectively address these shortcomings. The DA has many unfilled positions, existing staff may \nnot  have  an  agricultural  background  or  training,  and  extension  staff  lack  resources  such  as \ntransportation to deliver services effectively. \n\nGovernment-sponsored rural cooperative societies and the private sector provide inputs \n12. \nfor  farmers,  and  the  cooperative  societies  provide  agrochemicals  at  subsidized  prices.  During \nproject preparation, 94.5% of the households surveyed were using fertilizers, but at about half \nthe  rate  in  other  parts  of  the  country.  Different  fertilizers  are  subsidized  at  different  rates;  this \nsituation  creates  distortion  in  their  purchase,  with  subsequent  misapplication.  These  problems \ncombined  with  untimely  availability  of  fertilizer  at  cooperative  societies,  imprecise  field-to-field \nirrigation,  and  ignorance  concerning  proper  application  limit  the  effectiveness  of  fertilizers. \nSeeds  are  also  available  through  cooperative  societies  and  the  private  sector,  but  quality  and \nvarieties  vary  and  may  not  always  yield  the  best  results.  Cooperative  societies  are  located  in \neach  block  (lowest  state  municipal  level)  in  Chhattisgarh  and  private  vendors  are  found \nthroughout the state, so that almost all farmers have access to inputs within 5\u201310 kilometers of \ntheir  farm.  Credit  is  also  available  to  most  farmers  through  cooperative  societies.  The \nGovernment has periodically been lowering interest rates with the last time being in 2004. Of the \nfarmers  surveyed  during  project  preparation,  45%  borrowed  from  government  sources,  40% \nborrowed  from  private  moneylenders,  and  15%  used  their  own  resources.  Credit  is  not \nperceived to be a limiting constraint, but the largest constraint retarding the effective use of all \ninputs is an unreliable water supply that poses too great a risk for farmers to borrow and make \nthe  optimal  input  investment  and  application.  In  general,  inputs  are  available.  Improved \nknowledge  with  regard  to  input  selection  and  application,  linkages  with  quality  suppliers  and, \nmost  importantly,  a  reliable  water  supply  will  address  many  of  the  existing  problems  of  non-\noptimal input use. \n\n13.  Marketing.  The  rice,  pulses,  oilseeds,  and  other  crops  produced  in  Chhattisgarh  are \neither consumed at home or sold in local markets. Chhattisgarh has 170 wholesale and 1,679 \nprimary  rural  markets  throughout  the  state,  and  most  farmers  have  access  to  a  primary  rural \nmarket  within  a  day's  travel  by  tractor,  truck,  or  bullock  cart.  In  the  household  survey  during \nproject preparation, over 68% of the farmers kept much of their produce for home consumption, \nabout  25%  sold  in  local  markets,  and  7%  sold  to  local  middlemen.  In  many  communities,  a \nportion of any increase in food production would be consumed by the farm household or locally \ndue to widespread food insecurity, limiting the marketable surplus. Due to the predominance of \npaddy,  Chhattisgarh  has  a  well-developed  processing  industry  with  over  700  rice  mills  with  a \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\ncapacity  of  around  3  million  t.  Chhattisgarh  has  some  oilseed  facilities,  and  development  of \nallied  industries  is  an  important  goal  that  will  receive  assistance  from  the  proposed  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Agribusiness Development Support Project.8 \n\n14. \nChhattisgarh used to produce over 70% of the rice, nearly half of all food grains, and one \nthird of all major crops grown during kharif in MP before bifurcation, yet Chhattisgarh produces \nonly  about  4%  of  India's  rice.  Chhattisgarh  produced  45%  of  the  jowar  and  over  80%  of  the \ngram in undivided MP, and a quarter of all MP's pulses during rabi come from Chhattisgarh. MP \nrepresents  an  important  and  growing  market  for  Chhattisgarh.  Chhattisgarh's  rice  production \nand  other  major  crops  are  price  competitive  with  neighboring  states  and  crops  such  as \nsorghum,  soybeans,  and  pulses  offer  price  advantages  for  Chhattisgarh.  Market  opportunities \nare  increasing  as  infrastructure  improves  rapidly  and  as  Chhattisgarh  and  surrounding  areas \nurbanize. In Chhattisgarh, production of maize, gram, and other pulses, oilseed, and vegetables \nhas  been  rising  steadily  in  recent  years,  indicating  that  demand,  farmer  responsiveness,  and \nmarkets exist for those crops. \n\n15. \nIrrigation  and  Dry  Season  Cropping.  Inadequate  irrigation  system  design,  on-farm \nirrigation  practices,  and  lack  of  water  management  limit  rabi  and  diversified  cropping \nopportunities. Farmers build large field bunds to trap monsoon rains, and supplemental irrigation \nwater  is  applied  imprecisely  to  paddy  that  can  thrive  in  standing  water.  Rabi  and  diversified \ncrops require more precise application of water (and drainage) than is currently possible in most \nirrigation systems both at the farm level and in larger canals. Current irrigation development by \nWRD does  not include development of field channels or on-farm water management, and few \nsystems have extensive command area development or control structures. The Command Area \nDevelopment  Authority,  a  federally  funded  program,  supports  command  area  development \nactivities in medium and major irrigation schemes in Chhattisgarh, but covers less than 10% of \nthe  service  area.  Flooded,  field-to-field  irrigation  results  in  tremendous  water  wastage  and \nmakes effective use of fertilizer and other inputs difficult. \n\nDesign and operation of the irrigation systems limit rabi cropping. Many minor and a few \n16. \nmedium irrigation systems are designed to provide only supplemental irrigation during the kharif \nseason, so that even with a good monsoon, inadequate storage prevents irrigation of rabi crops. \nEven in systems with larger storage capacity, sluice gates may be broken or reservoir releases \nhave no formal procedures and are oriented toward kharif paddy, with little water remaining for \nrabi.  Measurement  of  water  deliveries  is  rare,  and  irrigation  delivery  is  not  based  on  real  time \ncrop  requirements.  Canals,  including  main  canals,  lack  cross  regulation  and  gated  control \nstructures to manage water deliveries. Outlet structures also lack adequate control structures or \noften  do  not  exist.  In  some  cases,  WRD  has  failed  to  complete  distributary  and  minor  canal \nnetworks  after  completion  of  the  storage  and  main  canals.  These  problems  highlight  the \ninterconnectedness of water management and its impact on rabi and diversified cropping. \n\nC. \n\nWater Users Associations \n\n17.  WUAs  in  Chhattisgarh.  Chhattisgarh  retained  the  Participatory  Irrigation  Management \n(PIM) Act that was passed in 1999 when it was part of MP. The PIM Act created a three-tiered \nsystem  of  WUAs  with  (i)  basic  WUAs  at  the  field  level,  (ii)  higher-level  project  committees  for \nspecial  works,  and  a  (iii)  distributary  committee  as  an  apex  body  in  larger  systems.  When  the \nPIM Act was adopted, 946 WUAs were created on over 1.1 million ha, but none of the higher-\nlevel  committees  had  been  formed.  The  functionality  of  existing  WUAs  varies  but  is  generally \npoor. Each WUA has one president and 8-10 officials who are directly elected and who execute \nalmost  all  WUA  activities.  The  president  convenes  and  chairs  WUA  meetings  and  represents \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the Agribusiness Development Support Project. Manila. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n31 \n\nthe  WUA  to  WRD  and  at  all  local  forums.  Meetings  are  only  for  the  elected  WUAs  leaders. \nVoting in the elections is limited to farmers who are current with their water tax accounts. These \nrequirements may limit voting members to 25% of the farmers in some instances. Elections for \nnew  WUA  officers  are  scheduled  in  June  2005,  at  which  time  elections  for  the  project  and \ndistributary committees are supposed to take place.  \n\n18.  WUAs' functions include the following: (i) coordinating water distribution among turnouts, \n(ii) patrolling canals to enforce the distribution schedule and to check for damage, (iii) informing \nthe irrigation subengineer of problems so that he can prepare a technical appraisal for WRD that \nwill  enable  the  WUA  to  access  funds  to  repair  the  damage,  (iv)  resolving  conflicts  among \nfarmers,  and  (v)  calling  meetings  of  members  of  the  WUAs  before  kharif  and  rabi  seasons  to \ndetermine  the  water  delivery  schedule.  WUA  officers  manage  finances  and  are  the  signing \nauthorities  of  the  WUA  bank  account  into  which  WRD  is  supposed  to  deposit  maintenance \nfunds. As noted, however, execution is typically weak. Farmers are very supportive of a greater \nrole in system management and O&M, but the WUAs currently do not facilitate their participation \neffectively due to lack of initial mobilization, capacity development, and ongoing support. \n\nA  large  reason  for  lack  of  capacity  development  is  that  the  WUAs  were  formed \n19. \nimmediately before bifurcation, and WRD did not give adequate attention to WUAs' mobilization \nand development.9 WRD lacks resources and skills to effectively develop and empower WUAs. \nProviding  WRD  the  guidance  and  resources  for  an  effective  WUA  capacity  development \nprogram  would  have  a  tremendous  impact  on  the  activity  and  ability  of  WUAs  for  system \nmanagement and O&M, and overall improvement of irrigated agriculture in Chhattisgarh. \n\n20. \nIn addition to needed capacity development, the institutional framework for PIM could be \nstrengthened  with  the  following  modifications  to  provide  a  stronger  enabling  environment  for \neffective  WUAs:  (i)  changing  the  election  cycle  so  that  not  all  officers  of  the  managing \ncommittee  change  at  one  time;  (ii)  developing  bylaws  that  clearly  define  WUA  functions;  (iii) \nreorganizing committees and subcommittees for more effective execution of duties; (iv) defining \nroles and responsibilities of the members of the general body, managing committee, president, \nand  WRD  in  the  PIM  Act;  (v)  developing  memorandum  of  understanding/service  agreement \nbetween the WUA and WRD that enumerates roles and responsibilities, services provided, and \nfees paid and received for greater accountability; (vi) removing WRD officials as ex officio WUA \nmembers  to  play  an  advisory  role;  (vii)  expanding  the  membership  of  the  general  body  to \ninclude households so women can vote and stand for office, and to include non-landowners who \ntill the soil and manage water; (viii) ensuring that irrigation systems above 200 ha will have at \nleast  one  dedicated  WUA;  and  (ix)  ensuring  fund  flows  to  WUAs  for  sustainable  O&M  ideally \nthrough direct sharing of the ISF between WRD and WUAs. Some policy changes can only be \nmade by revising the existing PIM Act, but many important policy changes such as sharing ISF \ncollections can be achieved within the existing legal framework. Amending the current PIM Act \nis the most effective option to achieve the desired policy objectives. \n\nExperience  with  PIM  in  India.  Since  the  1990s,  Gujarat,  Haryana,  MP,  Maharashtra, \n21. \nOrissa,  Tamil  Nadu,  and  Uttar  Pradesh  have  had  programs  to  form  and  strengthen  WUAs  for \nimproved irrigation. Andhra Pradesh (AP) had the largest and most intensive effort, which was \nassisted by the World Bank. Many states including MP in 1999, have used the Andhra Pradesh \nFarmers' Management of Irrigation System Act 1997 (AP Act) as the basis of their own PIM Act. \nIn 1994, only 48% of the command area in AP was being utilized. After the PIM program in 1997 \nthat  included  institutional  reforms,  rehabilitation,  and  O&M  funds,  the  gross  irrigated  area \ndoubled  in  some  command  areas,  using  two-thirds  the  amount  of  water  that  had  been \npreviously applied. In Rajasthan after the PIM reforms, the average rotation of watering time in \n\n                                                 \n9  MP has undertaken some WUA strengthening and PIM reform since bifurcation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\none  canal  command  was  reduced  from  79  to  47  days,  which  significantly  increased  water \navailability  in  all  reaches  of  the  command  area.  In  AP,  the  payment  of  the  ISF  increased \nsignificantly despite a large concurrent increase in the per-ha ISF rate due to improved service \nand a decline in underreporting occurred since WUAs would receive a portion of the fee. \n\nIn  AP,  the  state  government  played  a  large  role  in  promoting  irrigation  reforms  and \n22. \ndemonstrated that the irrigation department has to be intimately involved in the reform process. \nOne  of  the  successes  of  the  AP  case  is  that  it  explicitly  set  out  to  redefine  the  roles  of  the \nirrigation department and irrigation users, which were articulated in the AP Act. Passage of the \nAP Act was important for it established the WUAs as legal entities and defined their rights and \nobligations  vis-a-vis  the  irrigation  department.  Some  states  have  created  model  contracts \nbetween WUAs and the irrigation department that clearly specify the roles and responsibilities of \neach  and  provide  an  important  accountability  mechanism.  Clearly  demarcating  authority, \nresponsibilities, rules, and member behavior through development of bylaws for WUAs and their \nmembers  has  been  pursued  in  some  states.  The  state  is  critical  to  ensure  an  enabling \nframework to support effective WUAs. \n\n23.  WUA initiatives have addressed financial issues and improved resources for WUAs and \nO&M,  and  different  mechanisms  have  been  used  to  pursue  those  objectives.  All  states  have \ngiven WUAs indirect support through assistance in elections, collection of fees by government \nstaff,  and  auditing  of  accounts.  In  AP,  ISF  trebled  the  year  the  reforms  took  place,  with  little \nopposition  at  the  time  since  most  of  the  funds  went  to  the  WUAs;  however,  raising  ISF  is \npolitically contentious. Some states that have complied with aid agency-mandated rate changes \nhave  subsequently  rebuffed  them.  Several  states  have  introduced  direct  sharing  of  the  ISF \ncollections with the WUA, which improves the incentive for farmer payment, is more certain than \ndistributing  the  money  from  WRD  budgets  to  WUAs,  and  ensures  that the  money  ends  up  for \nO&M.  An  important  right  given  to  WUAs  in  most  states  is  the  ability  to  charge  members \nadditional fees and to receive revenue from diversified sources, which provides greater financial \nstability. In AP and other states, one-time grants to help with WUAs organizational costs have \nbeen given under aid-funded programs, and some  short-term O&M funds have been provided \nuntil  WUA's  own  revenue  sources  solidify.  Enhanced  financial  resources  must  be  a  part  of \nreforms for successful WUAs. \n\n24.  Mobilization  and  capacity  development  have  been  critical  parts  of  developing  WUAs  in \nAP,  Karnataka,  and  other  states.  Capacity  development  programs  in  India  have  involved  all \nstakeholders  from  senior  government  officials  to  village  dwellers,  but  primarily  address  WUA \nand irrigation department staff. For WUAs, capacity development has supported core activities \nsuch  as  water  management,  O&M,  financial  management,  monitoring  and  conflict  resolution, \nand, in some cases, agricultural extension. In AP, irrigation department  staff were trained and \nsensitized  to  inform  agency  staff  of  technical  details  of  the  PIM  program  and  to  help  change \nattitudes  and  mindsets  in  working  with  farmers  as  partners.  The  AP's  program  success  came \nlargely from involving WUAs in all aspects of irrigation, including physical development (design \nand construction), O&M, and management (technical, financial, and administrative) and, to the \ndegree possible, putting the irrigation department in a supporting advisory role. \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n33 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO CHHATTISGARH AND  \nWATER RESOURCES IN MADHYA PRADESH \n \n\nProject \n\nDuration \n\nSource \n\nType \n\n1.

The \nCooperation Fund provided grant assistance to help prepare the Project and has been involved \nduring  the  Project's  development.  The  Project  embodies  the  overall  goals  of  the  Cooperation \nFund by ensuring sustainably improved livelihoods for the rural poor. ADB and the Cooperation \nFund agreed that capacity development and institutional strengthening activities for water users \nassociation  (WUAs)  would  be  supported  through  a  TA  to  enhance  the  development  impact  of \nthe ADB Project. \n\nB. \n\nPurpose and Output \n\n2. \nThe  purpose  of  the  TA  is  to  help  develop  (i)  an  enabling  framework  and  capacity  for \neffective WUAs that will be able to assume responsibility for irrigation system management and \noperation and maintenance (O&M), and (ii) farmer capacity for diversified and rabi (dry season) \ncropping.  An  additional  goal  is  to  integrate  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  into  project \nactivities with broad stakeholder involvement. The TA will result in the following: (i) creation \nof  a  WUA  Capacity  Development  Program  that  will  provide  core  training  for  WUAs  throughout \nChhattisgarh; (ii) a training of trainers program to develop the skills of project contracted staff and \nWater Resource Department (WRD) staff who will train to WUAs in the field; (iii) development \nand  refinement  of  the  process  for  WUA  participatory  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  irrigation \nsystems under the ADB project including needs assessment, design, construction supervision; \n(iv)  support  to  develop  a  comprehensive  institutional  framework  for  participatory  irrigation \nmanagement  (PIM)  and  WUAs  in  Chhattisgarh,  including  a  revised  PIM  Act,  a  standardized \ncontract outlining management responsibilities for WRD and WUAs, and development of bylaws \nthat specify responsibilities of WUAs and their members; (v) a capacity development program to \nassist WUAs and farmers with improved farm practices for rabi and diversified cropping; and (vi) \ndevelopment  of  an  M&E  program  that  addresses  livelihood  impacts  and  includes  WUA \nparticipation. Specifically, the TA will support WUA and agricultural specialists recruited for the \nProject. \n\nC. \n\nExpected Results and Outputs \n\n3. \nThe  proposed  TA  will  produce  the  following:  (i)  development  of  training  materials, \nmodules,  and  other  capacity  developing  materials  that  will  support  the  establishment  of  an \nongoing  WUA  training  program;  (ii)  qualified  professionals  within  the  WRD  PIM  Unit  who  are \nable  to  effectively  train  WUA  members  in  the  skills  needed  for  management  and  O&M  of \nirrigation  systems,  as  well  as  in  techniques  to  support  rabi  and  diversified  cropping;  (iii) \ninstitutionalization of PIM and WUA capacity development as part of ongoing activities for WRD; \n(iv)  functional  WUAs  that  are  able  to  manage  and  execute  O&M  for  irrigation  systems;  (v) \nfarmers who are able to grow rabi and diversified crops; and (vi) an M&E program. \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Arrangements \n\n4. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $2.375  million  equivalent,  comprising  $1.313 \nmillion in foreign exchange and $1.062 million in local currency. The Government has requested \nthat  ADB  finance  an  amount  of  $1.9  million  of  the  TA  cost,  comprising  the  entire  foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $587,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  of  the \nUnited  Kingdom  will  provide  this  amount  on  a  grant  basis  to  be  administered  by  ADB.  The \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nGovernment  of  Chhattisgarh  will  contribute  the  remaining  local  currency  cost  of  $475,000 \nequivalent (in kind services).

TA consultants will work in the WRD PIM Unit and \nthe project management unit. The project director will serve as the TA director, and the Project's \nsteering and technical coordinating committees will provide guidance for the TA as they do for \nthe Project. WRD has agreed to provide counterpart staff to work with the TA consultants; office \naccommodations;  data  collection  and  management;  and  studies,  surveys,  and  field  support. \nSupport  to  the  TA  consultant  for  vehicles,  equipment,  development  and  delivery  of  training \nmaterials, and other required materials will be provided under project funds. The TA consultants \nwill  have  direct  responsibility  to  manage  staff  (including  nongovernment  organizations) \ncontracted with project funds that will provide initial support to the PIM Unit. \n\nThe  TA  will  be  implemented  over  7  years  concomitant  with  the  project  duration.  The \n6. \nmajority  of  the  input  will  take  place  during  the  first  3  years  of  the  Project,  with  incremental \ninternational  inputs  taking  place  in  the  later  years  of  the  contract.  A  team  of  consultants  will \nprovide  59  international  and  164  domestic  person-months  of  consulting  services  in  WUA  and \nPIM  development,  water  management,  agricultural  support  development,  and  M&E \n(Supplementary  Appendix  C,  Consultant  Package  B  of  the  Project  contains  the  terms  of \nreference). ADB will engage a consulting firm in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants. \nThe consulting firm will be selected using a simplified technical proposal and quality- and cost- \nbased  selection  procedures.  Advance  action  will  be  taken  to  recruit  the  consultants  on  a \nnoncommittal basis. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n43 \n\nSUMMARY ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe rehabilitation and upgrading (R&U) of minor and medium irrigation schemes under \n1. \nthe  Project  will  benefit  a  command  area  of  about  200,000  hectares  (ha)  and  directly  affect \n120,000  families  or  600,000  beneficiaries.  Emergency  repairs  on  sluice  gates  will  result  in \ncontrolled water supply in storage reservoirs. In addition, the institutionalization of participatory \nirrigation management (PIM) and improved functioning of water users associations (WUAs) will \nimprove the performance of irrigation throughout Chhattisgarh, which has a total command area \nof  over  1.4  million  ha.  As  a  result  of  the  Project,  irrigation  infrastructure  will  be  operated, \nmaintained,  and  managed  in  a  more  sustainable  way  by  WUAs  to  whom  management \nresponsibility for most activities will be transferred. WUAs will also contribute to operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) in cash, labor, and materials. Improved irrigation infrastructure and service \ndelivery  will  improve  supplementary  irrigation  for  the  kharif  season  (wet  season).  Better \nmanagement of water resources will allow expansion  of irrigated cropping in rabi (dry season) \nresulting  in  increased  agricultural  output,  permitting  diversification  into  higher  value  crops  and \nraising household incomes, generating employment, and reducing poverty. \n\nB. \n\nMethodology and Main Assumptions \n\nEconomic and financial analyses were prepared for the four pilot subprojects (two minor \n2. \nand two medium schemes) to assess economic viability, the impact on beneficiary households, \nand  their  ability  to  contribute  to  O&M  needs.  Economic  analysis  of  the  overall  Project  is  also \npresented. Project financial costs were estimated in Indian rupees (Rs) using prices prevailing in \nthe first half of 2004, expressed in constant prices over the project implementation period of 7 \nyears. Financial prices were derived from local sources and include taxes and duties. Economic \nprices  were  derived  based  on  the  following  criteria:  (i)  a  domestic  price  numeraire;  (ii)  values \nexpressed  in  constant  2004  prices  to  exclude  inflation;  (iii)  the  Indian  rupee  being  the  unit  of \naccount; (iv) a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9 for nontraded goods and services and a \nshadow value of 0.75 for unskilled and agricultural labor to take account of the surplus of labor \nin the rural areas; (v) border parity pricing with standard methods to derive farmgate input/output \nprices for major tradable commodities; and (vi) transfer payments such as taxes and subsidies \nbeing excluded in calculating economic values. \n\n3. \nAgricultural  Inputs  and  Outputs.  The  main  agricultural  inputs  are  labor,  seeds, \nfertilizer,  agrochemicals,  and  animal  and  mechanical  cultivation.  India  manufactures  its  own \nnitrogenous  and  phosphate  fertilizer  and  imports  needed  potassium  fertilizer.  The  economic \ncost of fertilizer is based on export parity prices for urea and phosphate, and import parity prices \nfor potassium. Agrochemical prices are based on current market rates. Agricultural labor rates \nare around Rs55 and Rs40 per day for men and women, respectively. The economic prices of \nthe main tradable agricultural outputs (rice, wheat, and maize) are based on their border parity \nequivalent farmgate prices. India currently has surplus production of these food grains and small \nquantities are exported to neighboring countries, so that marginal production will add to exports. \nIndia currently imports a significant portion of pulses and oilseeds for its consumption needs and \nincreased  production  is  valued  as  an  import  substitute  with  a  higher  farmgate  price.  For \ncommodities not traded internationally, the local financial price is used as the economic price. \n\n4. \nSubprojects. For the four pilot subprojects (Balar, Banki, Darki, and Pakhanjore), R&U \ncosts,  crop  budgets,  cropping  patterns,  and  technologies  were  detailed  based  on  field \nengineering estimates, water availability from the scheme's catchment area, reservoir capacity \nand  expected  changes  in  land  use  due  to  improved  water  and  irrigation  management,  and \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nincreased  availability  of  water  for  rabi  cropping.  Scenarios  with  and  without  the  Project  were \nevaluated. The farmers\u2019 preference during kharif is primarily to grow rice for home consumption \nand income generation. During rabi, a combination of wheat, pulses, and oilseeds is cultivated \ndepending  on  local  conditions,  markets,  and  relative  profitability.  The  R&U  engineering  and \nconstruction  costs  for  each  subproject  were  estimated  based  on  the  design  of  the  proposed \nstructures  and  rehabilitation  works,  including  field  channels.  All  direct  and  indirect  R&U  costs \n(economic),  including  labor,  equipment,  materials,  services,  and  overhead  for  the  four  pilot \nschemes,  vary  from  $116  to  $543  per  ha,  depending  on  system  degradation  and  required \nworks. For the overall Project, an average R&U cost of $216 per ha was estimated. It comprises \n$145  for  canal  rehabilitation,  $31  for  repairs  of  dams  and  bunds,  and  $40  per  ha  for  field \nchannels.  Based  on  these  costs  and  project  funds  for  R&U,  the  Project  should  be  able  to \nrehabilitate about 200,000 ha. \n\n5. \nO&M.  The  Water  Resources  Department  (WRD)  estimated  the  cost  of  administration \nand O&M at Rs500 ($11.10) per ha per year. WRD assesses farmers an irrigation service fee \n(ISF), (water tax in local usage) of Rs200 per ha for paddy in kharif and Rs99\u2013Rs741 per ha in \nrabi, depending on the crop and expected waterings. During policy dialogue, the Government of \nChhattisgarh  (GOCG)  agreed  that  the  ISF  will  be  shared  with  WUAs  (for  O&M)  following  its \ncollection,  or  other  resources  would  be  provided  for  O&M.  The  farmers  will  contribute  to  the \nWUA  and  O&M  through  the  ISF,  their  labor  and  materials  for  O&M,  and  additional  funds  or \nspecial collections. \n\n6. \nProject  Life  and  Sensitivity  Analysis.  The  expected  scheme  life  is  20  years. \nSensitivity analysis was carried out to test the impact of changes and main risks: deterioration of \ninfrastructure  due  to  poor  O&M  resulting  in  lower  irrigation  utilization,  increased  construction \ncosts,  decreased  benefits,  and  a  change  in  the  price  of  rice.  The  impact  of  the  Project  on \nhousehold incomes and returns to labor was assessed to judge the capacity to pay for O&M and \npotential  impact  on  poverty  reduction.  Information  for  the  Banki  scheme,  one  of  the  four  pilot \nsubprojects,  is  in  paras.  7-13.  Comparative  details  for  the  other  subprojects\u2013Balar,  Darki,  and \nPakhanjore\u2013are presented in Table A12.1. \n\nTable A12.1 Summary of TA Core Subprojects \n\nItem \nSize (ha) \nHouseholds (landowning) \nEconomic Investment Costs ($/ha) \nIncremental Crop Benefit ($ ha/year) \nIncremental Household Income ($/year) \nEconomic internal rate of return (%) \nha = hectare, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nBalar \n5,567.00\n3,389.00\n116.00\n36.00\n59.13\n17.10\n\nBanki \n2,000.00\n1,163.00\n233.00\n131.15\n225.49\n34.80\n\nDarki \n454.00 \n446.00 \n228.00 \n90.53 \n92.18 \n22.30 \n\nPakhanjore \n235.00 \n143.00 \n543.00 \n103.48 \n170.12 \n13.70 \n\nC. \n\nBanki Medium Scheme Subproject Analysis \n\n7. \nThe Banki scheme has a command area of 2,000 ha. It is located in the northern zone of \nChhattisgarh  and  is  typical  of  a  self-contained  design  for  rabi  cropping:  it  has  a  sufficient \ncatchment  area  and  reservoir  capacity  to  provide  supplementary  irrigation  to  all  the  command \narea during the monsoon kharif and full irrigation for 63% of the command area in rabi (based \non 65% rainfall and runoff exceedance probability). \n\n8. \nSubproject  Costs.  The  total  financial  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $549,000 \nincluding 6% for design and supervision. Rehabilitation of the irrigation canal system makes up \n78% of the costs; construction of field canals and watercourses, 19%; and repairs to the dam, \n3%. For the subproject analysis, an additional $15,000 is budgeted to strengthen WUAs to carry \nout  O&M  and  for  farmer  training  and  agricultural  support  services.  Total  project  costs  are \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n45 \n\nestimated at around $280 per ha (Rs12,600). Annual O&M costs are estimated at Rs500 per ha \nper year (para. 5). For the economic analysis, the financial costs were converted to economic \nequivalent values to account for distortions (taxes, etc.) and for the opportunity cost of labor. \n\n9. \nSubproject  Benefits.  Benefits  arise  from  the  increase  in  rice  production  during  kharif \ndue  to  supplementary  irrigation.  The  expansion  of  rabi  cropping,  which  depends  fully  on \nirrigation,  also  provides  substantial  benefits.  Incremental  crop  production  revenue  net  of \nadditional production costs is the main benefit. The without-Project scenario assumes that only \n19% of the command area receives supplemental irrigation in kharif, the majority is entirely rain-\nfed,  and  16%  of  the  area  is  irrigated  in  rabi.  The  kharif  season  is  devoted  entirely  to  rice \nproduction and presently yields an average 2.7 tons per ha (t/ha) for irrigated rice and 1.7 t/ha \nfor rain-fed rice. The main crops grown during rabi season are irrigated wheat with an average \nyield of 2.2 t/ha and pulse crops, which yield 0.5 t/ha. In the with-Project situation, it is assumed \nthat 100% of the command area would receive supplementary irrigation during kharif and that \naverage yields for rice would increase to 3.7 t/ha, while in rabi season an area of 1,250 ha (63% \nof the command area) would be irrigated and utilized for wheat (48%) yielding 3.0 t/ha, pulses \n(28%) with 1.0 t/ha, and oilseeds (24%) with 0.8 t/ha.  \n\n10. \nRehabilitating the Banki scheme is expected to increase paddy rice production by 3,749 \nt  and  diversified  crops  (wheat,  pulses,  and  oilseeds)  by  1,964  t,  a  100%  overall  increase  in \nproduction. The incremental on-farm employment generated by the additional labor requirement \nfor crop production is 130,000 person-days, an 83% increase. Financial net agricultural revenue \nwill increase by Rs17.3 million ($0.385 million), which equates to an average annual income of \nRs8,673 per ha ($192.73), a 121% increase. For the average-size farm of 1.7 ha in the scheme, \nthe  average  farm  income  will  increase  by  Rs14,911  per  year  ($331.35),  which  is  adequate  to \nmeet O&M costs to maintain the irrigation network. \n\n11. \nFarmer  Financial  Incentives.  The  Banki  scheme  has  an  estimated  1,163  households \ndistributed into these socioeconomic groups and farm size: 69 landless households (5.6%); 464 \nmarginal  farmers,  0.5  ha  (39.3%);  383  small  farmers,  1.5  ha  (31.1%);  and  296  medium  and \nlarge  farmers,  4  ha  (24%).  When  the  scheme  is  fully  operational  the  average  1.7  ha  farm  will \nhave  an  incremental  production  of  3.0  t  rice  per  year,  1.35  t  wheat,  and  0.35  t  pulses  and \noilseeds. Crop production will fully satisfy the annual nutritional needs of the average family and \nallow  a  considerable  surplus  for  sale.  Farm  income  is  expected  to  increase  by  an  average  of \nRs14,900 ($335) per year, a 121% increase from the present situation.   \n\n12. \nCapacity  and  Willingness  to  Pay  for  O&M.  Annual  O&M  costs  for  the  schemes  are \nestimated at Rs500 per ha per year ($11.11).1 For the average size of holding this is Rs860 per \nyear ($18.90). The incremental benefits from the increased crop production cover this amount \nmany  times  over  and  the  beneficiaries  have  adequate  capacity  and  incentive  to  ensure \nsustainable  operation  by  contributing  to  O&M  costs.  Their  willingness  to  pay  will  be \nstrengthened  by  the  assistance  given  under  the  Project  to  WUAs  through  facilities  provided, \ncapacity building and training, and support for PIM and agricultural services. As several years \nwill  be  needed  for  average  farming  practices  to  fully  reflect  the  opportunities  provided  by \nimproved  irrigation,  there  is  justification  for  the  Project  to  provide  initial  training  and  financial \nsupport  to  the  WUAs  as  an  incentive  for  their  establishment,  and  for  O&M  start-up  costs  and \nequipment. \n\n13. \nEconomic Return and Sensitivity . The economic net present value of the net benefit \nstream is Rs43.6 million ($0.97 million) at a discount rate of 12%. The economic internal rate of \nreturn  (EIRR)  is  33.4%  and  the  benefit-cost  ratio  is  2.9:1.  Sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted \n                                                 \n1  This  was  used  as  a  very  conservative  estimate  for  the  financial  analysis.  WRD  estimates  O&M  costs  at  about \n\nRs180 per ha for minor schemes and Rs252 per ha for medium schemes.  \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nwith the following results. A 20% increase in the investment costs will cause the EIRR to fall to \n28.6%.  The  switching  value  occurs  at  a  268%  increase  in  costs.  A  shortened  project  life \nbecause  of  inadequate  O&M  and  a  deterioration  of  irrigation  facilities  is  the  biggest  risk  to \neconomic  performance.  If  irrigation  intensity  is  reduced  by  25%  in  kharif  and  by  25%  in  rabi \nseason,  the  EIRR  decreases  to  24.1%.  The  switching  value  occurs  at  a  40%  reduction  in \nirrigation intensity. Rice is the primary crop making up 82% of the production from the scheme \nat  full  development.  If  the  economic  farmgate  price  of  rice  is  reduced  by  20%,  the  EIRR  will \ndecrease to 25.1%. The switching value occurs at a 45% reduction in the farmgate price. The \noverall level of benefits is realistic. A sensitivity test for an overall 20% decrease in the level of \nbenefits reduces the EIRR to 26.7%. The switching value is at a 55% decrease in agricultural \nbenefits. Overall the Banki scheme is found to be robust as evidenced by the high EIRR and the \nhigh  switching  values  for  various  parameters  in  the  sensitivity  analysis.  The  scheme  is  most \nsensitive to a reduction in irrigation intensity, particularly in the rabi season, when most of the \nincremental benefits from full irrigation occur.  \n\nD. \n\nOverall Project Analysis \n\n1. \n\nProject Costs, and Benefits and Assumptions \n\n14. \nProject  Costs.  Economic  and  financial  analyses  were  prepared  for  the  overall  Project \nbased  on  the  detailed  analysis  of  the  four  pilot  subprojects  and  other  sector  information \nobtained  during  project  preparation.  The  proposed  Project  will  implement  R&U  on  about \n200,000  ha  made  up  of  15-20  medium  schemes  averaging  5,000  ha  each  (approximately \n100,000  ha)  and  200\u2013250  minor  schemes  (approximately  100,000  ha).  Total  project  cost  is \nestimated  at  $66.6  million,  including  contingencies,  interest  during  implementation,  and \ncommitment charges. The financial cost is converted to economic cost, using a SCF of 0.9 for \nnontraded  items  and  a  lower  0.85  SCF  for  R&U  cost  to  allow  for  the  higher  unskilled  labor \nelement of these costs. \n\nProject  Benefits.  R&U  will  have  an  immediate  impact  in  increasing  the  utilization \n15. \npercentage  of  the  irrigation  systems.  Irrigated  cropping  during  kharif  will  increase  to  at  least \n90% of the system's design potential in most schemes, and the percentage of cropping in rabi \nwill  increase  to  a  degree  depending  on  the  water  supply  that  is  available  from  the  monsoon \nrains  and  the  physical  characteristics  of  the  irrigation  system.  Increased  irrigation  potential \nallows  farmers  to  diversify  crops  and  to  concentrate  on  crops  with  higher  financial  return. \nReduced risk and uncertainty will give farmers confidence to apply higher levels of crop inputs \nthan is the current situation. Therefore, coupled with the overall increase in cropping intensity, \nthere  will  be  an  increase  in  crop  productivity  as  reliable  irrigation  generates  increased  yields, \nboth as a function of a more reliable water supply, and also as a result of an increased use of \ninputs.  Developing  PIM  and  strengthening  the  capacity  of  WUAs  will  help  ensure  adequate \nO&M of the newly rehabilitated schemes and their sustainable operation. \n\n16. \nIrrigation Intensity and Productivity. The Project will give priority to schemes with low \nirrigation  utilization  due  to  severe  dilapidation,  and  having  an  acceptable  EIRR.  It  is  assumed \nthat in the without-Project situation only 40% of the command area is irrigated during kharif and \nthe  rest  is  rain-fed.  With  the  Project,  the  percentage  receiving  supplementary  irrigation \nincreases to 90% and 10% remains rain-fed.2 The total benefits of increased irrigation intensity \nto 90% overall are assumed to build up over 3 years after R&U is completed (75%, 90%, 100% \nof  90%).  Rabi  cropping  is  almost  entirely  dependent  on  irrigation  water  since  very  little  or  no \nrainfall  occurs  during  rabi.  At  present,  because  of  the  poor  condition  of  the  irrigation  systems, \n                                                 \n2  It is not realistic to consider 100% irrigation intensity over the whole Project for wet season each year since there \n\nwill be some schemes where the full command area cannot be irrigated every year. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n47 \n\nless than 10% of the total command area is capable of rabi cropping. With the Project, the rabi \ncropping area is expected to be 36% of the command area, with rabi crops being wheat (50%), \npulses  (25%),  oilseeds  (20%),  and  vegetables  (5%).  Giving  WUAs  in  R&U  subprojects \nagricultural  support  will  help  improve  productivity  by  linking  farmers  with  higher  quality  input \nproducers, supporting demonstration activities, and facilitating marketing for rabi production.  \n\n17. \nAgricultural Benefits. The Project will implement PIM reforms and support WUAs over \nthe  entire  irrigated  area  in  Chhattisgarh,  which  totals  around  1.1  million  ha  net  of  the  area  for \nR&U activities. This will improve the revenue for, and execution of, O&M activities, lead to more \nreliable  irrigation,  increase  agricultural  productivity,  and  slow  the  rate  of  system  degradation. \nImproving the management of irrigation schemes will make more water available for use in the \nrabi season. It is anticipated that for the state as a whole, strengthened WUA management and \nincreased  O&M  funds  going  to  the  field  level  will  result  in  an  estimated  5%  increase  in \nproductivity  over  time  in  areas  not  directly  affected  by  the  Project\u2019s  R&U  works.  This  is \nestimated to result in an additional 84,000 t of cereals, pulses, and oilseeds per year. \n\n18. \nPriority  Sluice  Repair  Program.  The  program  will  repair  the  sluices  (headworks)  of \nirrigation schemes that are inoperable. This will allow the release of water from the reservoir to \nbe  controlled,  resulting  in  improved  irrigation  management,  expansion  of  rabi  cropping,  and \nfarmer incentives to invest more resources in O&M and management for the rest of the system. \nThe program is expected to give a 10% increase in agricultural production in both kharif and rabi \nseasons.  Repair  of  approximately  500  minor  schemes  with  an  average  command  area  of  200 \nha is planned, which is expected to result in an additional 16,000 t of production per year.  \n\n19.  WRD Capacity Building. Strengthening and modernizing the capacity of WRD will also \nhave  an  impact  on  the  efficiency  and  sustainability  of  the  irrigation  sector.  GOCG  is  currently \ninvesting a significant portion, around 20%, of its plan budget in irrigation, which is almost $100 \nmillion per year. Even a modest increase in the capacity to use these resources more effectively \ndue to project interventions will have a notable impact on the irrigation sector. \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Analysis of the Overall Project \n\n20. \nEconomic Analysis. The overall Project has an EIRR of 22.1% with a net present value \nof  Rs1.58  billion  ($35.13  million)  and  benefit-cost  ratio  of  1.79  at  a  12%  opportunity  cost  of \ncapital.  Sensitivity  analysis  is  applied  to  test  the  effects  of  changes  in  the  main  parameters \naffecting economic returns (Table A12.2). The overall project costs were based on the cost of \nthe four pilot subprojects investigated during the feasibility study and are assessed at an overall \nrate. The overall level of benefits is based on a realistic assessment of the level of agricultural \noutput  that  can  be  achieved  with  reliable  supplies  of  irrigation  water  and  assuming  increased \nuse of inputs and improved practice. A sensitivity test on a 20% reduction in the general level of \nbenefits causes the EIRR to decrease to 18.1%. The economic analysis includes benefits that \nrelate  to  the  wider  irrigation  sector  and  the  management  of  water  resources  in  Chhattisgarh. \nThis includes the development of PIM and WUAs and, to a lesser extent, capacity building for \nWRD.  Excluding  the  overall  benefits  from  these  activities  reduces  the  EIRR  to  18.0%.  The \nresults  show  that  the  Project  is  robust  to  changes  in  overall  costs  and  benefits.  The  most \nsensitive  factor  is  the  level  of  irrigation  intensity  for  the  command  area.  This  finding  highlights \nthe  importance  of  ensuring  that  systems  achieve  a  high  level  of  irrigation  efficiency,  and  that \nfarmers are empowered to manage and have the resources for O&M to ensure the sustainability \nof the rehabilitated irrigation systems. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nTable A12.2: Sensitivity Analysis Results for the Overall Project \n\nItem \n\nBase Case \n\nEconomic Internal \nRate of Return (%)  \n\nSwitching \nValuea (%) \n\nSensitivityb \n\n22.1 \n\n \n\n \n\n$35,131,748 \n\nNet Present Value at 12% \n \nBenefit-Cost Ratio \n \nInvestment R&U Cost \n20% Increase \n \nIrrigation Intensity Area  \n20% Decrease \n \nRice Farmgate Price \n20% Decrease \n \nBenefits \n \nPIM Component \n \nPIM = participatory irrigation management, R&U = rehabilitation and upgrading. \na  The switching value is the level of change in the risk factor that causes the economic internal \n\n1.79 \n \n20.40 \n \n18.10 \n \n18.20 \n \n18.10 \n \n18.00 \n\n \n \n \n265 \n \n40 \n \n45 \n \n66 \n \n \n\n \n \n \n0.0 \n \n0.2 \n \n0.1 \n \n0.1 \n \n \n\nExclude General Benefits \n\n20% Decrease \n\nrate of return (EIRR) to fall below 12%, the opportunity cost of capital. \n\nb  Sensitivity  is  the  absolute  value  of  the  percent  change  in  the  EIRR  divided  by  the  percent \n\nchange in the risk factor.  \n\n \nDistribution and Poverty Impact Analysis \n\nE. \n\n21. \nProject  Beneficiaries.  The  Project  will  primarily  affect  rural  agricultural  communities, \nincluding  some  of  the  most  disadvantaged  people  in  Chhattisgarh.  It  is  estimated  that  around \n120,000 landowning households will directly benefit. An additional 15,000 landless households \nwill  also  benefit  from  increased  employment  opportunity  through  the  incremental  demand  for \nagricultural labor. In total, around three quarters of a million people will be directly affected by \nthe  impact  of  R&U.  The  overall  impact  of  strengthening  PIM  and  WUAs  on  the  total  irrigation \nsector in the state will have a more widespread impact at a lower level through the increase in \nirrigation efficiency and improved management of the existing infrastructure. \n\n22. \nPoverty Impact. The landless and marginal farmers are estimated to make up over 50% \nof the households in the project area. During project preparation, 69% of the families that were \nsurveyed  kept  the  vast  majority  of  the  rice  that  they  produced  for  home  consumption.  The \nProject will help stem the precarious situation with regard to food security in Chhattisgarh. The \nbenefits of the increased agricultural production are expected to accrue to all landowners. The \nmarginal  small  farms  and  the  landless  will  gain  from  the  increased  opportunity  for  agricultural \nemployment over an extended agricultural calendar by more rabi cropping. Small poor farmers \nwill  also  have  increased  opportunity  for  work  to  meet  the  increased  labor  needs  on  the  larger \nfarms.  Employment  will  not  only  produce  important  financial  benefits  to  the  landless,  but  will \nalso  reduce  the  hardship  and  need  for  families  to  go  out  of  Chhattisgarh  to  find  seasonal \nemployment.  The  average  farm  with  1.7  ha  is  expected  to  receive  an  incremental  income  of \n$180.02  (Rs8,100)  per  year  (financial  prices)  from  3.0  t  of  crop  production  as  a  result  of  the \nProject,  while  marginal  farmers  with  less  than  0.5  ha  will  receive  $62.97  as  the  extra  value  of \ntheir  0.88  t  increase  in  crop  production.  Secondary  and  related  agricultural  business \nopportunities are also expected to develop as a result of the increase in agricultural production. \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n49 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK AND \nINDIGENOUS PEOPLES DEVELOPMENT PLAN \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe  Chhattisgarh  Irrigation  Development  Project  (CIDP)  involves  rehabilitating  and \n1. \nupgrading  existing  irrigation  infrastructure  under  a  loan  to  be  financed  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  The  Project  will  result  in  enhanced  agriculture  productivity  and \nregional  food  security  by  improving  irrigation  systems,  enhancing  the  capacity  of  water  users \nassociations (WUAs) and farmers, and promoting integrated water resources management. The \nProject  provides  for  sustainable  operations  of  irrigation  infrastructure  in  subproject  schemes \nthrough an intensive participatory process. The four core subprojects studied during the project \npreparation stage did not involve resettlement and are not anticipated to have land acquisition \n(LA)  or  negatively  impact  any  tribal  community.  A  large  number  of  additional  schemes  will  be \nselected for project support, but they are not expected to have any significant LA, resettlement, \nor  impact  on  tribal  communities.  However,  a  resettlement  framework  and  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment plan (IPDP) have been prepared, setting out the policies, principles, procedures, \nand  implementation  mechanisms  to  adequately  address  the  issue  of  LA,  resettlement,  and \nimpacts on vulnerable people if they occur during project implementation. Although the intents \nand substance of the resettlement framework and IPDP address different issues, the framework \nand implementation arrangements for their execution under the Project are similar. \n\nB. \n\nResettlement Policies \n\n2. \nADB's  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  was  adopted  in  November  1995.  The  policy \nrequires the following: (i) avoid or minimize resettlement impacts where possible, (ii) consult \nwith affected people (APs) including disclosure of the resettlement plan (RP) and project-related \ninformation,  (iii)  pay  compensation  at  the  market/replacement  value,  (iv)  provide  resettlement \nassistance  to  affected  people  including  persons  with  no  title  to  land,  (v)  ensure  income \nrestoration  and  rehabilitation,  and  (vi)  give  special  attention  to  vulnerable  groups.  The  policy \nobjectives and principles related to income restoration or having a bearing on it are as follows: \n(i)  people  unavoidably  displaced  should  be  compensated  so  that  their  economic  and  social \nfuture  would  be  generally  as  favorable  as  it  would  have  been  without  the  project;  (ii)  any \ninvoluntary  resettlement  should,  as  far  as  possible,  be  implemented  as  part  of  a  development \nprogram  and  RPs  should  be  time-bound  and  with  adequate  budgets;  (iii)  APs  should  be \nprovided  resources  and  opportunities  to  reestablish  their  homes  and  livelihood  as  soon  as \npossible; (iv) APs should be fully informed and consulted on compensation options; (v) existing \nsocial  and  cultural  institutions  of  resettled  persons  and  their  hosts  should  be  supported  and \nused  to  the  greatest  extent  possible;  and  (vi)  resettled  persons  should  be  integrated \neconomically and socially into the host communities. \n\nThe  CIDP  resettlement  framework  is  also  based  on  India's  National  Policy  on \n3. \nResettlement and Rehabilitation (NPRR) that was adopted in 2004 and has many of the same \nprinciples  as  the  ADB  policy.  The  state  of  Chhattisgarh  also  developed  a  model  policy  on \nresettlement and rehabilitation (R&R) in the year 2002. Based on the Madhya Pradesh model, \nthe  Chhattisgarh  model  calls  for  the  following:  (i)  a  state-level  advisory  committee  with  a \nsociologist  and  economist  for  any  rehabilitation  project,  and  (ii)  identification  of  small  and \nmarginal farmers apart from landowners, because cash compensation alone is not sufficient to \nrehabilitate APs. \n\nThe  principles  of  the  project  resettlement  framework  draw  from  all  the  aforementioned \n4. \npolicies and include the following: (i) negative impacts will be minimized as much as possible; \n(ii)  compensation  will  be  paid  at  replacement  value  to  improve  or  at  least  restore  preproject \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nincomes and living standards; (iii) APs will be consulted on the issues of LA, compensation, and \nR&R assistances options; (iv) compensation and assistance will be paid in full before physical \nrelocation;  (v)  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  established  in  every  district  to  ensure \nspeedy  resolution  of  conflicts;  and  (vi)  all  efforts  will  be  made  to  ensure  the  participation  of \nvulnerable  groups  in  plan  preparation,  implementation,  and  monitoring.  The  resettlement \nframework sets out the eligibility and entitlements for loss of land or other immovable properties, \nor  income  loss  (Supplementary  Appendix  D  includes  the  compensation  matrix).  Affected \nhouseholds  may  be  entitled  to  a  combination  of  compensation  measures  and  resettlement \nassistance, depending on the nature of ownership rights of lost assets, scope of impacts, and \nthe social and economic vulnerability of APs. \n\nC. \n\nIndigenous/Tribal Issues and Policies \n\nOver  three  fifths  of  the  total  geographic  area  of  Chhattisgarh  comes  under  scheduled \n5. \nareas  by  notification  of  the  President  of  India  under  the  fifth  schedule  of  the  Constitution  of \nIndia. Of the total population of the state, over 35% is tribes. Thus Chhattisgarh has the largest \ntribal concentration in the country. A total of 42 communities have been declared as scheduled \ntribes under Article 342 of the Constitution of India and five tribal groups have been identified as \nprimitive  tribal  groups  by  the  Government  of  Chhattisgarh.  Most  of  these  tribes  are  poor  and \nilliterate. The work participation rate among them is 52% and, among the workers, 86% either \npractice agriculture or are engaged in allied agriculture activities. \n\n6. \nUnder the fifth schedule of the Constitution of India, certain tribal areas of the state have \nbeen  declared  as  scheduled  areas,  which  have  special  regulations  for  (i)  transfer  of  land  by \nmembers  of  scheduled  tribes,  (ii)  allotment  of  land  to  members  of  such  tribes,  and  (iii)  the \nbusiness of moneylending. The first Act to protect tribal land from being alienated was passed \nby  the  Central  Provinces  and  Berar  (presently  Madhya  Pradesh)  as  the  Land  Alienation  Act, \n1916. Another law applicable to the Madhya Bharat region only and known as Madhya Bharat \nScheduled Areas (Allotment and Transfer of Land) Regulation was passed in 1954. Both laws \naimed  to  check  indiscriminate  transfer  of  tribal  land  without  the  permission  of  the  district \ncollector.  After  recognition  of  the  states,  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Land  Revenue  Code  (1959) \nbecame  the  basic  document  for  the  two  states.  The  NPRR  also  gives  preference  to  tribal \ncommunities  in  land  allotment.  The  NPRR  advocates  resettling  tribal  members  close  to  their \nnatural  habitat  in  a  compact  block,  so  that  they  can  retain  their  ethnic,  linguistic,  and  cultural \nidentity.  \n\n7. \nADB  uses  the  following  characteristics  to  define  indigenous  people:  (i)  descent  from  a \npopulation  group  present  in  a  given  area  before  territories  were  defined;  (ii)  maintenance  of \ncultural  and  social  identities  separate  from  dominant  societies  and  cultures;  (iii)  self-\nidentification and identification by others as being part of a distinct cultural group; (iv) linguistic \nidentity  different  from  that  of  the  dominant  society;  (v)  social,  cultural,  economic,  and  political \ntraditions  and  institutions  distinct  from  those  of  the  dominant  culture;  (vi)  economic  systems \noriented  more  toward  traditional  production  systems  rather  than  mainstream;  and  (vii)  unique \nties and attachments to traditional habitats and ancestral territories.  \n\n8. \nBased  on  both  India\u2019s  legal,  constitutional,  and  developmental  strategies  and  ADB\u2019s \npolicy  on  indigenous  people,  the  objectives  of  an  IPDP  are  to  ensure  (i)  that  affected  tribal \npeople/scheduled tribes benefit from the Project; (ii) that they are included in the entire process \nof  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  the  CIDP;  (iii)  that  affected  tribal  people/ \nscheduled  tribes  receive  benefits  from  the  Project  that  are  at  least  on  par  with  or  better  than \nthose received by the rest of the population (this may require special measures and preferences to \ntribal  people  over  others);  and  (iv)  that  a  basis  is  provided  for  the  tribal  groups  in  the  area  to \nreceive adequate development focus. The need for a full IPDP will be established on the basis \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n51 \n\nof  the  following  criteria  set  out  in  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  indigenous  people  to  determine  if  project \nimpacts are significant: (i) adverse impacts on customary rights of use and access to land and \nnatural resources; (ii) negative impacts on socioeconomic and cultural identity; (iii) impacts on \nhealth, education, livelihood, and social security status; and (iv) any other impacts that may alter \nor undermine indigenous knowledge and customary institutions (Supplementary Appendix E). \n\nD. \n\nInstitutional Framework and Implementation Arrangements \n\n9. \nTo  address  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  activities,  the  Water  Resource \nDepartment (WRD) will establish a Social Development Unit (SDU) that will be responsible for \npolicy  guidance,  coordination  and  planning,  internal  monitoring,  and  overall  reporting  for \nresettlement,  indigenous  peoples,  social  assessment,  economic  evaluation,  and  environment. \nWRD  will  appoint  an  executive  social  development  officer  to  head  the  SDU,  supported  by  a \nsenior  resource  person  recruited  for  the  life  of  the  Project  and  with  an  appropriate  social  or \nanthropological background. The SDU will be responsible for determining if an RP or an IPDP is \nneeded,  based  on  the  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  that  is  carried  out  for  each \nsubproject and discussions with the Design Unit and other WRD and project staff. If an RP, any \nLA, or IPDP is deemed necessary, consultant and nongovernment organization (NGO) support \nwill  be  engaged  to  prepare  and  help  implement  the  RP  and  IPDP  in  full  consultation  with  the \nAPs.  The  NGO  will  work  in  close  association  with  involved  WRD  staff  to  ensure  smooth \nimplementation  of  the  RP/IPDP,  including  disbursement  of  assistance,  providing  livelihood \nsolutions, upgrading of skills, etc. \n\n10. \nAt  the  district  level,  one  WRD  executive  engineer  will  be  designated  as  social \ndevelopment  liaison  officer  (SDLO),1  to  be  responsible  for  resettlement,  indigenous  peoples, \nand other SDU activities. For each subproject, the RP or IPDP will be implemented through a \ndistrict  level  committee  (DLC)  that  will  be  established  in  each  district  as  needed.  For \nresettlement,  the  DLC  will  include  the  following  members:  (i)  SDLO  and  WRD  staff  member \nresponsible  for  the  subproject;  (ii)  district  magistrate  or  his/her  representative;  (iii)  district  LA \nthe  Revenue  Department;  (v) \nofficer  or  his/her  representative,  (iv)  representative  of \nrepresentative  of  the  panchayat  (local  rural  government)  in  the  affected  village;  (vi) \nrepresentative of the WUA, line departments involved with the RP; (vii) APs, including women; \nand (viii) a local NGO. \n\n11. \nIn  the  case of  the  IPDP,  the  DLC  will  be  formed  under  the  chairmanship  of  the  district \nmagistrate or his/her representative with the block development officer/chief executive officer as \nmember secretary. The DLC will include the following members (i) members of the DLC and the \nproject administrator for the local Integrated Tribal Development Project, (ii) WRD SDLO for that \ndistrict,  (iii)  line  agency  representatives,  (iv)  two  tribal  representatives,  and  (v)  an  NGO \nrepresentative. The DLC will be responsible for regularly reviewing of progress, approving micro \nplans,  and  coordinating  with  local  government  authorities  and  their  field  offices.  For \nimplementing the IPDP, a village-level committee (VLC) will be formed with the help of an NGO, \nwhich  will  include  representation  from  tribal  families,  the  leader  of  the  tribal  community,  and \nother  village  leaders.  The  committee  will  have  at  least  15  members  with  substantial \nrepresentation  of  women  (with  a  target  33%).  The  committee  will  list  the  needs  of  the \ncommunity  and  prepare  village-level  action  plans  for  a  particular  year.  The  NGO  will  facilitate \nplan preparation and group meetings and ensure that the VLCs have all requisite information on \n\n                                                 \n1  The  SDLO's  role  will  be  in  addition  to  the  regular  responsibilities  of  the  executive  engineer,  and  training  will  be \nprovided.  For  day-to-day  oversight  of  R&R  activities,  the  SDLO  may  delegate  responsibility  to  the  assistant \nengineer associated with the specific project, but overall accountability will rest with the SDLO. Membership of the \nDLCs for both the indigenous peoples and resettlement activities will be harmonized to facilitate implementation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nprogram  contents  and  funds.  The  VLC  will  ensure  full  participation  of  villagers  in  IPDP \nprograms. \n\nE. \n\nConsultation, Disclosure and Grievance Redress \n\nThe  Project  will  ensure  that  APs  for  resettlement,  impacted  tribal  members,  and  other \n12. \nstakeholders  are  informed,  consulted,  and  allowed  to  participate  actively  in  the  subproject \ndevelopment  process,  including  preparation,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  subproject \nresults  and  impacts.  During  implementation  and  the  monitoring  stage,  information  will  be \ndisseminated to APs and other key stakeholders. The information will be in Hindi and presented \nin  the  subproject  area,  describing  the  main  subproject  features  including  the  entitlement \nframework  for  resettlement.  Consultation  will  be  carried  out  in  ways  appropriate  for  cultural, \ngender-based, and other differences among the stakeholders. Where groups or individuals have \ndifferent  views/opinions,  particular  emphasis  will  be  laid  on  the  views  and  needs  of  the \nvulnerable groups.  \n\nConsultation \n\ninitiated  during \n\nthe  preparatory  stage  will  continue  during \n\n13. \nthe \nimplementation  stage.  For  resettlement,  consultations  during  implementation  will  involve \nagreements  on  compensation,  assistance  options,  and  entitlement  package  and  income \nrestoration.  Information  disclosure  will  be  pursued  for  effective  implementation  and  timely \nexecution of the RP.  For the benefit of the community in general and APs in particular, the RP \nand  R&R  policy  will  be  translated  into  the  Hindi  and  kept  at  the  panchayat  level,  block \ndevelopment office, tehsil office, district magistrate office, and WRD/SDU. \n\n14. \nThe RP will be disclosed to the APs and other stakeholders for review and comments on \nthe mechanisms and entitlement in implementing the RP. The aim of this procedure is to receive \ncomments from the APs in particular and incorporate the appropriate suggestions if technically \nfeasible.  \n\n15. \nGrievance redress committees (GRCs) will be set up with the development of all RPs to \nassist  the  APs  in  redressing  grievances  within  a  stipulated  time  frame  of  15  days.  The  GRC  will \nmeet once in 15 days to expedite redress of grievances. It will comprise (i) representatives of a local \nNGO;  (ii)  public  representatives  (viz.,  member  of  Parliament,  member  of  the  legislative \nassembly,  district  magistrates  office  etc.)  from  respective  districts;  (iii)  a  representative  of  a \nwomen's  group;  (iv)  vulnerable  APs;  (v)  line  department;  and  (vi)  the  representative  of  the \ndistrict administration. Participation of women in the GRC will have a target of 33%. \n\nF. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n16.  WRD will set up an internal implementation monitoring system comprising the SDU, its \nown field staff, and an NGO that is different from the one contracted to prepare or implement the \nRP  or  IPDP.  Monitoring  indicators  will  be  established  by  WRD  with  ADB  concurrence.  The \nmonitoring  for  resettlement  or  in  indigenous  peoples  activities  and  plans  will  be  a  part  of  the \nADB Project Performance Monitoring System established for the overall Project.  \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n53 \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction and Project Description \n\nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  of  anticipated  environmental  impacts \n1. \nassociated with the Chhattisgarh Irrigation Development Project (CIDP) was prepared according \nto  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB\u2019s)  Guidelines  on  Environmental  Assessment.  The \nExecuting  Agency  will  be  the  Water  Resources  Department  (WRD)  of  the  Government  of \nChhattisgarh.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  throughout  the  state  over  7  years  beginning  in \n2005.  The  CIDP  has  3  institutional  and  capacity  building  sector-oriented  subcomponents  to \nstrengthen  the  (i)  WRD,  (ii)  water  user  associations  (WUAs),  and  (iii)  agricultural  support \nservices.  A  fourth  component  involves  the  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  (R&U)  of  about  10\u201320 \nmedium  and  200\u2013300  minor  existing  irrigation  schemes  for  a  total  area  of  about  200,000 \nhectares (ha). The IEE examined the overall sector and R&U components and within the latter, \ntwo  medium  (Balar  and  Banki)  and  two  minor  (Darki  and  Pakanjore)  irrigation  schemes  that \nwere selected as core subprojects during project preparation. The IEE did not indicate negative \nimpacts from the Project, and anticipated positive long-term environmental benefits from all the \ncomponents  except  system  rehabilitation.  The  following  presents  an  IEE  from  a  subproject \nduring project preparation under the technical assistance. \n\nB.  \n\nIntroduction to the Balar Medium Scheme IEE \n\n2. \nThe  Balar  medium  scheme  IEE  was  completed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nEnvironmental  Assessment  for  a  category  \u201cB\u201d  Project.  The  IEE  was  completed  to  meet  three \nobjectives:  (i)  to  predict  the  magnitude  of  potential  environmental  impacts  associated  with \nplanned subproject activities; (ii) to provide an environmental monitoring plan (EMP) to minimize \nor  prevent  the  occurrence  of  negative  impacts  while  maximizing  positive  effects;  and  (iii)  to \npresent a framework for WRD, the local WUAs, and other relevant stakeholders in the area of \nthe scheme to implement environmental assessment and the EMP procedures of the subproject \n(Supplementary  Appendix  F).  The  scope  of  the  IEE  also  recognized  that  detailed  final  design \nwould be completed during implementation of the Balar subproject, at which time this IEE may \nbe updated. The IEE has incorporated reviews of existing information combined with interviews \nand  consultations/workshops  among  a  sample  of  stakeholders  in  the  scheme\u2019s  area  and  from \nthe government. \n\n3. \nDescription  of  the  Project.  The  Balar  subproject  is  located  in  the  Mahanadi  Basin  of \nthe central agroclimatic zone in Kasdol subdistrict of Raipur District. The existing structures of \nthe  Balar  irrigation  scheme  will  receive  R&U  combined  with  improved  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) and agriculture practices that will lead to diversification and value addition \nin  farm  produce,  creation  of  jobs,  and  raising  of  farm  and  nonfarm  income  in  the  surrounding \ncommunity. Balar was constructed approximately 27 years ago and was originally designed to \nirrigate 5,567 ha. However, the existing facilities are deteriorated and only effective for 4,770 ha \nof the kharif (wet season) area and 200 ha of the rabi (dry season) area. The Balar reservoir is \nsupplied  by  run-off  from  a  catchment  area  of  about  82  square  kilometers.  Minor  siltation  has \ntaken place in the reservoir tank due to improper management of land resources upstream and \nadjacent to the reservoir. \n\n4. \nImplementation  of  R&U.  The  objectives  of developing  the  Balar  subproject  are  to \n(i) provide R&U for the existing irrigation infrastructure; (ii) develop the capacity and roles of the \nWUAs  for  O&M  of  irrigation  systems  to  ensure  sustainable  operations  beyond  the  life  of  the \nProject; and (iii) enhance agriculture support services for yield improvement, crop diversification, \nand  marketing.  The  R&U  will  include  the  following  activities:  (i)  desilting  and  lining  sections  of \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nthe  main  canal;  (ii)  repair  of  the  bench  flume  and  aqueduct;  (iii)  repair  and  reconstruction  of \ncross regulators; (iv) repair of vehicle and foot bridges; (vi) repair of drops; (vii) installing gates; \nand (viii) construction of watercourses and field channels. R&U construction activities would be \nconfined to small areas of land in and around the structures being repaired and installed. O&M \nwill be led by the WUAs in collaboration with WRD. A period of 2 years is proposed to complete \nR&U of the Balar system from the start of final design through to completion of civil works.  \n\nC.  \n\nDescription of the Environment of Balar \n\nPhysical  Resources.  The  command  area  is  mainly  a  flat  plain,  while  in  the  vicinity  of \n5. \nthe  dam/reservoir  catchment  area,  the  topography  varies  from  undulating  terrain  to  small \nhillocks  covered  with  forest.  The  geology  consists  mostly  of  granite,  gneiss,  and  associated \nbasic  and  ultrabasic  intrusives,  while  soils  are  sandy  loam  and  clay.  Rainfall  from  May  to \nNovember causes flash floods while temperature varies from a minimum of 100C to a maximum \nof 400C. The depth of groundwater varies from 10 to 100 meters as per local information. Use of \ngroundwater  for  irrigation  in  the  area  is  rare.  Some  groundwater  is  used  for  livestock  and \ndomestic pruposes. No information was available on water quality at the time of this report. \n\n6. \nBiological  Resources.  The  area's  aquatic  and  wildlife  resources  are  considered  of \nminor  significance.  The  forests  are  mostly  \u201cdry  deciduous  type.\u201d  Reserve/protected  forests  do \noccur in the area of the scheme. Despite restrictions on resource use in the protected areas, it \nwas  observed  that  encroaching  activities  are  occurring  in  the  upper  areas  of  the  catchment. \nVegetation  is  being  cleared  and  soils  are  being  exposed.  Overall  forest  cover  has  been \ndegraded  by  human  activities,  yet  is  still  essentially  in  tact.  Overgrazing  by  livestock  is \nconsidered a leading cause of soil degradation and continues to persist.   \n\n7. \nEconomic and Social Conditions. The availability of economic data in the area of the \nscheme is minimal.  However, Balar is regarded as situated in an underdeveloped area of the \nstate.  Agriculture  is  the  dominant  contributor  to  the  local  economy,  and  residents  rely  almost \nentirely  on  agriculture  for  employment.  Agriculture  production  is  far  below  potential  due  to  the \nstate  of  irrigation  facilities  and  poor  agricultural  practices. During  low  production periods,  local \nsources  of  livelihood  are  supplemented  by  collecting  nontimber  forest  products  such  as \nfirewood, bamboo, resins, berries, various leaf herbs, and myrobalan. About 50% of the people \nare marginal farmers, and the average landholding is about 1 ha. There is little industry or any \ntype of mineral wealth. Roads are mostly unpaved and communication linkages are poor.  \n\n8. \nSocial and Cultural Conditions. R&U of the Balar facilities is likely to benefit more than \n25,000 people spread over 23 villages. About 50% of the population belong to scheduled tribes. \nThe  dominant  tribes  are  Gonds,  Binjhwar,  Baiga  and  Karwar.  Health  care  is  available  at  the \nprimary health center. Literacy rate is about 30-40%, and primary schools are available locally, \nbut attendance levels are uncertain. There are no cultural, historical, or archaeological sites of \nimportance.  The  Balar  area  is  characterized  by  large-scale  landlessness,  underemployment, \nilliteracy,  frequent  crop  failure,  and  high  percentage  of  tribal  population  with  skewed  land \ndistribution. All  these  factors  contribute  to  poverty  among  the  population.  Poor  communication \nlinkages  and  difficult  living  conditions  have  resulted  in  the  limited  presence  of  nongovernment \norganizations  in  the  area  such  that  targeted  poverty  reduction  programs  have  not  been \ndeveloped to any significant extent. \n\nD. \n\nForecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nThe  examination  of  potential  environmental  impacts  has  been  completed  according  to \n9. \nthe  methodology  described  in  the  overall  IEE  of  the  CIDP  to  identify  significant  positive  or \nnegative  environmental  effects  associated  with  the  proposed  R&U  and  O&M  of  the  Balar \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n55 \n\nfacilities.  A  three-tiered  impact  rating  scheme  was  applied  with  the  temporal  (e.g.,  short-term, \nlong-term)  and  spatial  considerations  for  the  Balar  subproject  as  presented  below.  Where  the \npotential  for  significant  negative  environmental  impacts  to  occur  was  identified,  mitigation  or \nenvironmental safeguards were described and incorporated in the EMP portion of the IEE.  \n\nPhysical/Chemical  Component.  Relevant \n\nincluded  noise,  soils,  and \n10. \nhydrology. Dam safety and its influence on hydrologic events were addressed separately in the \nproject  preparatory  documents.  Elevated  noise  levels  may  occur  only  during  construction \nassociated  with  various  equipment  and  worker  activities  creating  nuisance  to  nearby \ncommunities. However, these are expected to be of short duration and spatially limited to each \nconstruction  site.  Contractors  can  be  made  aware  of  the  potential  and  incorporate  simple \nmeasures  in  equipment  operation  and  worker  behavior  to  avoid  annoying  noise  effects  on \ncommunities. No impact is expected. \n\nindicators \n\n11. \nSoil  salinization  does  not  appear  as  an  issue  in  the  command  area,  while  soil  erosion \nwarrants consideration. In general the risk of soil erosion during construction is low. The activity \nwill  be  limited  spatially  to  where  facilities  are  being  upgraded  and  installed  and  temporally  by \nbeing  conducted  primarily  during  the  rabi  season.  Further  safeguards  associated  with  on-site \nactivity and clean-up can be incorporated into the final design and into contractors\u2019 conditions of \nwork.  However,  it  appears  that  current  land  use  practices  in  the  area  have  already  created \nseveral  sources  of  soil  erosion  particularly  in  the  upper  portions  of  the  catchment.  This \nheightens  the  soil  erosion  risk  that  could  compromise  the  sustainability  of  an  R&U  irrigation \nscheme.  The  active  life  of  a  reservoir  can  be  shortened  by  increased  sedimentation  resulting \nfrom erosion. Additional requirements for canal desilting that may become necessary can pose \nan expensive cost element to O&M. These situations will need further evaluation at final design \nand  may  require  soil  stabilization  (e.g.,  revegetation)  in  some  of  the  areas  bordering  the  R&U \nworks. Procedures during O&M will be needed to minimize sediment entry in the reservoir/tanks \nand  delivery  channels  that  could  compromise  the  efficiency  and  sustainability  of  the  R&U \nactions.  Negative  impacts  of  soil  erosion  arising  directly  from  the  Project  are  not  expected. \nHowever,  safeguards  to  manage  sedimentation  should  be  incorporated  into  O&M  procedures \nfor a broader command area. \n\n12. \nThe  hydrologic  regime  will  change  during  O&M.  The  water  use  and  release  profile  will \nneed to be sensitive to water demand from existing and potential future users in areas further \nremoved  (or  downstream  of  the  system).  This  condition  will  need  to  be  addressed  in  the \nmanagement  of  future  water  distribution  to  avoid  conflicts.  No  impact  is  projected,  subject  to \ngood procedures for irrigation management that match demand and supply with people\u2019s needs \nbeing incorporated in the final design and O&M packages. \n\n13.  While water quality data was unavailable at the time of this assessment, it is expected \nthat  more  stable  water  flow  will  accompany  O&M.  Stagnant  areas  would  be  reduced  and \naccumulation of domestic and livestock waste in the Balar scheme will decrease. Portions of the \nnutrient  loads  from  the  existing  domestic  waste  streams  would  also  be  taken  up  by  the \nagricultural crops. Fertilizer and pesticide use may increase and application rates may  require \nattention, and the Project includes an agricultural extension component that will provide training \non  appropriate  application  of  agrochemicals.  No  detectable  effects  on  water  quality  are \nexpected,  subject  to  incorporating  safeguards  that  address  community  sanitation  (during  the \nparticipatory  irrigation  management  component)  and  proper  procedures  for  the  use  of \nagriculture pesticides and fertilizers (under the agriculture support component). \n\nBiological Components. The terrestrial and aquatic habitats in the Balar scheme area \n14. \ncontinue  to  be  extensively  disrupted  by  human  activities.  Relevant  indicators  include  forest \nresources/protected areas and waterborne diseases. During construction, clearing land for R&U \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nof  existing  structures  or  installing  some  new  structures  may  encroach  on  the  existing \nforested/protected  areas.  Most  of  the  activity  is  expected  to  be  limited  within  areas  already \ndisturbed in and around the existing facilities. \n\n15. \nThe main concern is during O&M and the indirect impacts related to ongoing community \nencroachment  on  undisturbed  land  resources,  which  will  continue  even  without  the  Project. \nRealization  of  the  benefits  of  improved  agricultural  production  from  R&U  of  the  Balar  scheme \nmay, however, further increase human activity and intensify the encroachment already occurring \non  existing  forested/protected  areas  (e.g.,  extraction  of  resources  for  nontimber  products). \nContinued  removal  of  sensitive  forest  resources  will  threaten  the  sustainability  of  the  scheme \n(e.g., soil erosion). Forest and watershed issues are managed by the Department of Forestry, \nwhich  oversees  strict  management  of  forest  resources  and  their  sustainable  exploitation  in \nChhattisgarh.1  Boundaries  of  forest and  catchment  areas  will  need  to  be  identified (subproject \npreparation  for  R&U  will  provide  a  topographic  survey  of  the  irrigation  system  and  catchment \narea,  which  can  be  used  for  planning  with  the  IEE)  and  continued  encroachment  managed \nthrough  local  awareness  raising  and  facilitating  greater  community  participation  leading  to \nappropriate  safeguards  being  incorporated  into  the  daily  routines  of  local  residents.  During \nrevision of the IEE and final preparation for the subproject, watershed and forestry issues will be \nincorporated into the EMP, and cooperation with the Department of Forestry will be pursued as \nneeded to develop and implement the EMP. The IEE will also include development of livestock \ngrazing  management  measures  to  protect  catchment  resources  as  well  as  to  address  the \nproblem of livestock grazing on rabi crops to support increased rabi production. \n\n16. \nIn the case of Balar and other subprojects, linkages with the ongoing nationally funded \nRajiv  Ghandi  Watershed  Management  Program  may  be  possible  to  address  watershed \nmanagement  issues  in  relation  to  the  catchment  of  the  irrigation  system.  Overall,  with  a \nheightened sensitivity and management of current land use practices, R&U of the Balar scheme \nis not expected to pose direct significant environmental effects on any biological components of \nthe  environment.  Formation  of  WUAs  and  the  improved  condition  of  the  irrigation  system \nprovide an incentive and a means for improved management of catchment resources. \n\n17.  While  data  on  the  occurrence  of  waterborne  diseases  was  not  available  during  this \nassessment, the improved and more stable water flows are expected to reduce the occurrence \nof favorable habitats for disease vectors to flourish. Simple flushing of the system may also be \nemployed  to  control  aquatic  weeds  and  stagnant  areas  combined  with  minimizing  settlements \nbordering on the scheme\u2019s facilities. Variation in water levels in paddy fields during the wetting \nand drying accompanying rice cropping is also effective against vector-borne diseases. Overall \nno significant negative environmental impact is anticipated. \n\n18. \nSocioeconomic and Cultural Component. Indicators related to infrastructure services \nand heritage resources are not considered relevant to the Balar area. Infrastructure other than \nspecific to the R&U works is not expected to change. Heritage sites gazetted or recognized as \nprotected  have  not  been  identified  in  the  area.  Relevant  indicators  include  population  and \ncommunity  changes,  employment  and  income  opportunities,  social/cultural,  gender/vulnerable \npersons, resettlement, and government fiscal effects. \n\nPopulation  and  community  changes  are  anticipated  during  construction.  Construction \n19. \nmay increase the presence of persons from outside the community, since contractors will largely \nuse their existing staff for skilled positions. Construction may increase the demand for unskilled \nlabor,  attracting  newcomers  to  the  area  during  the  R&U  works.  It  is  likely  that  most  unskilled \n\n                                                 \n1  Especially  in  many  tribal  areas,  nonforest  timber  products  such  as  tendu  leaves  provide  significant  income \nopportunities for local communities and management of forest resources is an important concern of communities \nas well as the Department of Forestry. \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n57 \n\nlabor  will  be  sourced  from  the  local  community.  The  contractor  will  have  to  be  sensitive  to \npossible changes in demographics. Ethnic composition and worker-resident conflicts that could \noccur  should  be  managed  within  the  conditions  of  work.  Once  the  scheme  is  operational, \nincreased prosperity among the villages is expected.  Population densities and the potential for \nin-migrants  will  increase  but  are  more  likely  to  arise  from  the  reduced  out-migration  to  urban \ncenters.  With  reduced  out-migration,  the  social  fabric  of  the  communities  is  expected  to \nstrengthen.  This  represents  a  major  positive  impact  to  the  community  inhabiting  the  Balar \nscheme area. \n\nEmployment  and  income  opportunities  are  expected  to  improve.  Construction  is \n20. \nexpected  to  create  a  \u201cspike\u201d  in  income  opportunities  over  the  implementation  period.  Where \nlocal unskilled labor is employed, a moderate positive benefit will remain within the community. \nWhile the effect will be limited spatially and temporally within the window of construction activity, \nthe  size  of  the  intervention  and  the  2  years  of  activity  present  a  moderate  positive  immediate \nimpact to the communities in the area. As O&M and improved agricultural benefits are realized, \nthe  immediate  impact  will  be  increased  household  incomes  among  the  community  and  an \nenhanced quality of life\u2013a major positive benefit to local communities in and outside the area. \n\n21. \nSocial/cultural conditions will be influenced during construction, with a possible influx of \noutsiders during construction. This could lead to negative impacts on family kinships, roles, and \nresponsibilities  among  the  communities.  During  a  2-year  construction  period,  opportunities  for \nthis to occur are much higher for medium schemes. Contractors will be encouraged to engage \nunskilled  workers  locally  and  will  be  sensitized  to  local  social  customs  and  issues  to  prevent \nnegative  impacts.  During  O&M,  the  WUAs  will  be  responsible  for  maintaining  an  appropriate \nallocation  of  water  in  the  scheme.  Worker  commitments  in  the  WUAs  may  also  cause  some \ndisruption  of  the  social  fabric  in  the  community  causing  negative  impacts.  The  CIDP \nparticipatory  irrigation  management  (PIM)  component  will  build  a  capability  in  the  both  the \nWUAs and the communities, and the overall improved participatory environment is predicted to \nrealize  a  major  positive  impact  among  the  villages  in  the  area  and  prevent  the  occurrence  of \nnegative disruptions in the social/cultural fabric. \n\n22. \nConsiderations of gender and vulnerable groups will need to be updated and addressed \nduring implementation of the R&U subcomponent and in PIM policy reforms, and in WRD and \nWUA  interactions  that  will  specifically  address  such  considerations  as  part  of  overall  project \nimplementation.  Opportunities  for  greater  involvement  of  these  groups  in  decision  making  for \nthe system will be supported. A major positive impact on gender and the vulnerable group fabric \nof  the  community  is  expected  as  PIM  outputs  are  incorporated  into  construction  and  O&M \nactivities. \n\n23. \nResettlement  of  persons  is  not  anticipated,  yet  minor  land  acquisition  and  minor \ncompensation  for  temporary  disruptions  of  economic  activities  may  be  required  for  pockets  of \nthe local population. However, detailed surveys have not been conducted to assess the level of \nimpact.  A  detailed  survey  during  final  design  will  be  required  to  evaluate  the  potential \nresettlement  impacts.  Where  any  are  identified,  the  EMP  may  be  amended  under  ADB\u2019s \nresettlement  framework  for  displacement  and  compensation  related  to  land  acquisition, \nresettlement, and impacts on vulnerable people that may result. This issue has been addressed \nin the CIDP design.   \n\n24. \nGovernment  fiscal  effects  will  be  influenced  by  the  development  and  O&M  of  the \nscheme. As a medium-scale scheme, the area involved is large. Management will be delegated \nto  the  local  WUAs  and  WRD  will  be  relieved  of  significant  management  and  some  fiscal \nresponsibility.  This  development  is  expected  to  contribute  a  moderate  positive  impact  to  the \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nstate  government  and  local  constituents.  Improved  irrigated  agriculture  production  is  also \nexpected to contribute additional local income to the state\u2019s domestic product. \n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\nInstitutional  Requirements  and  Responsibilities.  R&U  of  the  system  will  be \n25. \ncompleted  with  the  existing  facilities.  Traditional,  physical  mitigation  is  not  considered \nnecessary.  The  potential  for  adverse  impacts  will  be  managed  by  an  environmental \nassessment/EMP process that incorporates a core program of environmental safeguards in the \nconstruction and O&M procedures of the Balar subproject. Carrying out EMP responsibilities will \nalso depend on the human resources of WRD and WUAs to be developed as part of the CIDP. \n\n26.  WRD, assisted by the WUAs and the project consultants in the Social Development Unit \n(SDU)  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  EMP.  During  R&U,  the  responsibility  for \nimplementing the environmental safeguards will be on the contractor and monitored by the WUAs, \nassisted by WRD and the SDU. The WUAs will be responsible for leading O&M. The agricultural \nsupport  services  for  the  WUAs  in  systems  that  receive  R&U  (including  project  consultants  and \nDepartment of Agriculture [DA] staff) will help the WUAs monitor the implementation and outputs \nof  agricultural  initiatives,  including  the  use  of  pesticides  and  fertilizers,  and  provide  feedback  to \nWRD  and  the  WUAs.  The  institutional  capabilities  and  capacities  of  these  organizations, \nparticularly WRD and WUAs, will be developed and strengthened under the CIDP.   \n\n27.  WRD  will  be  supported  over  the  course  of  the  CIDP  with  the  necessary  technical  and \nfinancial  resources  to  update  this  IEE  and  carry  out  EMP  responsibilities  under  an \norganizational structure to extend beyond the life of the CIDP. For the Balar subproject, WRD \nstaff from the nearest field office will participate in the EMP process. WRD SDU will provide an \noversight function and serve as a link between the overall CIDP and Balar subproject activities. \nWRD field staff will be more hands-on in working with the WUA and community representatives. \nResponsibilities will involve (i) overseeing and updating the IEE and EMP, (ii) carrying out timely \nsubmission  of  reports  to  CIDP  management  for  clearances  where  required,  (iii)  ensuring  the \nrecommendations  of  EMPs  are  included  in  the  activities  of  the  Balar  subproject,  and  (iv) \nensuring EMP reporting is completed for project review and monitoring. \n\n28. \nThe  WUAs  with  support  of  the  WRD  PIM  Unit  will  identify  representatives  as  early  as \npossible  in  subproject  implementation  to  develop  the  skills  necessary  to  (i)  participate  in \nupdating the IEE (where required) for the final R&U design of their scheme, and (ii) undertake \naspects  of  the  EMP  as  part  of  construction  and  O&M  activities  in  order  to  manage  negative \nenvironmental  impacts  and  initiate  remedial  responses  where  appropriate.  WRD  with  project \nconsultant support initially will assist in raising environmental awareness among WUA members \nand provide support to build appropriate capability in participatory environmental management \nand  monitoring  of  the  Balar  scheme.  The  project  consultants  will  advise  on  the  institutional \nstructure in this regard and help build the capacity of staff to carry out their responsibilities. The \nproject consultants assisting with implementation of the EMP will consist of two environmental \nimpact  assessment  social  specialists  recruited  internationally  and  nationally  under  the  overall \nCIDP.  Both  experts  will  work  in  collaboration  with  all  project  consultants  on  the  project  team, \nWRD, WUA, and DA counterparts and various other stakeholders in delivery of the EMP.  \n\n29. \nEnvironmental  Monitoring  Plan.  The  EMP  consists  of  initiatives  to  strengthen  the \nenvironmental  knowledge  and  management  capabilities  of  personnel  in WRD,  the  WUAs,  and \nother  relevant  stakeholders  so  they  can  carry  out  their  respective  EMP  responsibilities.    The \nmain  elements  of  the  EMP  will  include  (i)  institutional  strengthening;  (ii)  updating  the \nenvironmental  assessment  for  incorporation  into  final  design,  construction,  and  O&M;  and  (iii) \nimplementing the EMP core program. The content of these elements will be delivered according \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n59 \n\nto the EMP as presented in the CIDP IEE and adjusted specifically for application to the Balar \nsubproject during implementation. \n\n30. \nPublic  Consultation  and  Information  Disclosure.  Public  consultation  and  disclosure \nwas carried out from 15 April to 14 June 2004 during the project\u2019s preparation. Among the 23 \nvillages  in  the  Balar  scheme,  3  were  selected  for  focus  group  (FG)  sessions  linked  with \nhousehold surveys. Household survey information was obtained from the representatives of 58 \nhouseholds attending the FG sessions. Participants in FGs included (i) heads and members of \nhouseholds;  (ii)  groups/clusters  of  beneficiaries;  (iii)  village  rural  governments;  (iv)  WUAs;  (v) \nlocal  volunteer  organizations  and  some  NGOs  (few  are  active  in  the  area);  (vi)  government \nagencies  and  departments;  and  (vii)  other  project  stakeholders  (e.g.,  women,  tribes,  other \nvulnerable  groups).  Over  25%  represented  women  and  over  50%  scheduled  tribes.  Core \nactivities were (i) disseminating information and requesting villagers to attend FGs; (ii) sharing in \ndiscussing  the  opinions,  perceptions,  and  preferences  of  the  beneficiaries;  (iii)  involving  the \nbeneficiaries in identifying problems and possible solutions; (iv) obtaining beneficiary views and \nacceptance  of  CIDP,  particularly  among  the  WUAs  and  farmers,  and  discussing  the  potential \nloss of a small portion of their land for construction of field channels; (v) assessing the influence \nof socioeconomic characteristics of village populations to better create supportive mechanisms \nfor  planning  and  implementation  (e.g.,  agriculture,  water  charges,  WUA  activities,  etc.);  (vi) \nidentifying  contentious  issues  related  to  project  impacts  (including  environmental)  on  the \ncommunity,  if any; (vii) factoring the beneficiaries\u2019 opinions into design alternatives for R&U of \nthe  irrigation  schemes;  (viii)  identifying  levels  and  scope  of  community  participation  in  project \nimplementation,  particularly  O&M;  and  (ix)  reaching  an  understanding  of \nthe  overall \ndevelopment goals and benefits of the subproject for presentation in the final project preparation \nreport.  \n\n31. \nAmong the representatives surveyed in the Balar scheme, there was interest in R&U for \nthe  system  in  order  to  realize  the  improvements  in  irrigated  agriculture  they  had  expected  20 \nyears earlier when the Balar scheme was originally constructed. Site surveys and consultations \nconfirmed many of the existing environmental conditions presented herein and that agriculture, \ndespite the low productivity, remains a mainstay of local livelihoods. Residents indicated that the \nmain constraints to agriculture production were lack of reliable water and a properly organized \nWUA  to  voice  out  water  needs  in  the  area.  Farmers  indicated  they  would  be  prepared  to  pay \nwater charges for O&M provided the rates are reasonable and directly support mechanisms for \ntimely supply of water. Improving irrigation is viewed as a need and a mechanism to improve the \nquality of life. The consultative process will need to continue, particularly during final design, to \nstrengthen \u201cbuy-in\u201d and cooperation in finalizing the design and site conditions, and particularly \nin structuring the WUA. It is expected that a larger number of local stakeholders and villages will \nbe involved. \n\nF.  \n\nFindings and Conclusions for Balar IEE \n\n32. \nFindings. The IEE did not predict negative environmental impacts associated with R&U \nof  the  Balar  subproject  that  could  not  be  identified  and  managed  through  the  IEE  and \ndevelopment  of  appropriate  mitigating  measures  and  the  EMP.  Any  impacts  that  may  occur, \nsuch  as  encroachment  on  the  catchment  area,  are  likely  to  occur  without  the  Project,  and  a \nsignificant  amount  of  disruption  to  the  existing  environment  has  already  occurred  from  human \nactivities in the Balar area. The IEE will ensure that environmental safeguards are incorporated \nin the construction and O&M activities under the EMP, as well as address any other issues such \nas  encroachment  or  overgrazing.  The  local  environment  is  expected  to  improve  under  a  post-\nproject condition. However, due to the importance of participatory procedures attached to CIDP, \npublic consultations will continue in order to ensure local considerations are incorporated in the \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nfinal  design  of  the  Balar's  R&U,  the  construction,  and  O&M  procedures.  The  IEE  and  EMP \nresults will be updated to address unique situations where they occur. \n\n33. \nIn  the  Balar  system,  preventing  negative  impacts  and  maximizing  positive  benefits  will \nalso  rely  heavily  on  the  success  of  the  WUA  and  WRD  in  carrying  out  their  respective \nconstruction  and  O&M  responsibilities  in  a  participatory,  collaborative  manner.  This  will  be \nreinforced by institutional strengthening components under the overall CIDP initiative, including \nEMP  training  specified  in  the  EMP  portion  of  the  R&U  subcomponent.  Failure  to  implement \nsustainable  O&M  mechanisms  will  compromise  the  expected  increase  in  irrigated  agriculture \nproduction.  The  importance  of  O&M  in  realizing  of  long-term  socioeconomic  benefits  from \nimproved  irrigated  agriculture  will  need  to  be  constantly  reinforced  during  the  PIM  component \namong all the beneficiaries.  \n\nConclusions.  R&U  of  the  Balar  scheme  is  unlikely  to  result  in  any  serious  negative \n34. \nenvironmental impacts or minor impact that cannot be mitigated. While some refinements will be \nrequired  prior  to  final  design,  construction,  and  O&M  procedures,  an  EMP  that  relies  on \nenvironmental  safeguards  will  be  applied  during  all  phases  of  Balar  scheme  development  to \nprevent  the  occurrence  of  negative  impacts  while  maximizing  the  occurrence  of  positive \nimpacts. Collectively, R&U of the Balar system is expected to support a sustainable agriculture \nsystem that will enhance the livelihood of the people through higher and more stable incomes. If \nthe  Balar  scheme  is  not  rehabilitated,  the  scheme  and  the  land  resources  in  the  area  will \ncontinue to deteriorate. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 04 February 2005) \n", "Currency Unit \n \nRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n \n= \n= \n", "Indian rupee/s (Re/Rs) \n \n$0.0231 \nRs43.3 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAndhra Pradesh \naffected people \nchief engineer \nChhattisgarh Irrigation Development Project \ncountry strategy and program \nDepartment of Agriculture \ndistrict level committee \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental monitoring plan \nfocus group \nfive-year plan \nGovernment of Chhattisgarh \ngrievance redress committee \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nindigenous peoples development plan \nirrigation service fee \ninformation technology \nland acquisition \nlocal competitive bidding \nLondon interbank offered rate \nmonitoring and evaluation \nMadhya Pradesh \nminimum support price \nmidterm review \nnongovernment organization \nNational Policy on Resettlement and Rehabiltiation \noperation and maintenance \nproject administration memorandum \nparticipatory irrigation management \nproject management unit \nproject performance management system \nproject preparatory technical assistance \nresettlement and rehabilitation \nrehabilitation and upgrading \nresettlement plan \nstandard conversion factor \nsocial development liaison officer \n \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n", "ADB \nAP \nAPs \nCE \nCIDP \nCSP \nDA \nDLC \nEIRR \nEMP \nFG \nFYP \nGOCG \nGRC \nICB \nIEE \nIPDP \nISF \nIT \nLA \nLCB \nLIBOR \nM&E \nMP \nMSP \nMTR \nNGO \nNPRR \nO&M \nPAM \nPIM \nPMU \nPPMS \nPPTA \nR&R \nR&U \nRP \nSCF \nSDLO \n \n", " \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "SDU \nSGIA \nSOE \nt/ha \nTA \nTOR \nVLC \nWRD \nWUA \nWUACDP \n", "Social Development Unit \nsecond-generation imprest account \nstatement of expenditure \nton per hectare \ntechnical assistance \nterms of reference \nvillage-level committe \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Water Resources Department \nwater users association \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Water Users Association Capacity Development Program \n", " \n \n \nNOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year of the Government ends on 31 March. \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "This report was prepared by T.
