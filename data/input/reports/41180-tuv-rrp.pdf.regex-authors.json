Environmental  implications  of  the  proposed  policy  and \nAssessment  institutional reforms were reviewed, and environmental interventions have \nbeen incorporated, as required. \n   \nProgram  The  Program  will  provide  for  the  development  of  a  strengthened \nDescription  governance framework for the oversight of public enterprises in Tuvalu, \nimproved  capacity  for  oversight  on  the  part  of  the  Government,  the \ncapacity to respond positively to such oversight on the part of public \ncorporations, strengthened capacity to manage debt, and a reduction in \ngovernment debt to the National Bank of Tuvalu (NBT). \n   \nRationale  Tuvalu\u2019s economy is strongly dependent on external earnings, the level of \nwhich is determined by global economic forces. In recent years, external \nearnings have fallen, placing fiscal pressure on the Government, and \nhighlighting the need to reduce the domestic economy\u2019s reliance on the \npublic sector as the driver of growth and instead create opportunities for \nprivate sector development to build insurance against volatility. \n   \nImpact  The intended impact of the Program will be sustained economic growth \nand  fiscal  stability  as  prioritized  in  Tuvalu\u2019s  national  plan  objectives. \nIndicators of success will be the Government\u2019s performance benchmark \nindicators. \n   \nOutcome  The outcome of the Program will be improved government capacity for \nfiscal planning and management. The policy matrix is structured around \nthree  outputs:  (i)  improved  public  debt  management  capacity, \n(ii) strengthened  oversight  of  public  enterprises,  and  (iii) strengthened \nmanagement capacity in public enterprises. The outputs are designed to \ndirectly address the core of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) country \npartnership strategy, which focuses on effective fiscal management. The \nsalient features of the policy matrix include (i) passing of taxation reform \nlegislation;  (ii)  endorsement  of  a  public  enterprise  strategic  policy; \n(iii) development of a public corporations act and its tabling in Parliament; \n(iv) repayment of the outer islands agency suspense account held with \nNBT; (v) endorsement of a debt risk management and mitigation policy \nand strategy; (vi) analysis of private sector growth potential; (vii) adoption \nof  a  legal  framework  for  the  licensing  and  ongoing  supervision  and \nregulation of banking institutions; and (viii) NBT board-approved policies \nfor the timely collection of past due loans and advances of credit; and for \nmeasuring, monitoring, and maintaining adequate liquidity by NBT. \n ", "ii   \nFinancing Plan  ADB will support the Program by providing a grant of $3.24 million from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. Tuvalu is classified as country with high \nrisk  of  debt  distress  and  is  therefore  eligible  to  receive  100%  grant \nassistance. The grant will be provided in two tranches. The first tranche of \n$1.24  million  will  be  available  upon  satisfaction  of  the  first  tranche \nconditions and grant effectiveness, estimated at around December 2008. \nThe second tranche of $2 million will be available upon satisfaction of the \nsecond tranche conditions, estimated at around November 2009. \n   \nCounterpart  Counterpart  funds  generated  from  the  grant  will  be  applied  to  the \nFunds  repayment of the Government\u2019s estimated A$3,795,610 overdraft in the \nouter islands agency suspense account with NBT, with any remaining \nfunds to be directed toward other outstanding debt to NBT. \n   \nProgram Period  The  Program  is  from  1  November  2008  to  31  March  2010.  Policy, \nlegislative, organizational, and operational changes agreed upon with the \nGovernment and set out in the policy matrix are to be put in place from 1 \nNovember 2008 to 30 November 2009. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MFEP) \n   \nImplementation  MFEP will coordinate policy, legal, and regulatory actions and ensure that \nArrangements  the reforms as agreed to by the Government and ADB are duly carried \nout on time. A program steering committee, chaired by the secretary of \nMFEP and including representatives of the Office of the Attorney General \nand  MFEP\u2019s  budget  and  public  enterprise  oversight  areas,  will  be \nestablished to monitor and coordinate the Program and support technical \nassistance from ADB and other agencies. \n   \nProgram Benefits  The Program is anticipated to provide benefits to society in terms of fiscal \nand Beneficiaries  stability, improvement in enterprise performance, and business and public \nconfidence. \n   \nRisks and  Risks are the continued political will required to implement a robust policy \nAssumptions  framework  for  enterprise  performance  improvement  and  support  for \nneeded institutional structures, and the ongoing availability of appropriate \ntechnical  capacity.  The  Government\u2019s  adoption  of  the  performance \nbenchmark indicators is seen as a statement of political will to initiate \nchange in financial management, and the financial incentive provided by \nAustralia and New Zealand to achieve these targets will also support \ncontinued political will and allow for retention of capacity. \n   \nProcurement  The proceeds of the program grant will be disbursed against a broad \nrange of imports, subject to a negative list.  \n ", "o 150 o 00'E 170 o 00'W\n177  00'E\nN o r t h     P a c i f i c     O c e a n\nIMPROVTEUDV AFILNUANCIAL P2h0io Sl i0ep0ap'Nine MARSHALL  ISLANDS International  D PACIFIC    REGION 20o  00'N\nMANAGEMENT PROGRAM REPUBLIC ateline\nOF PALAU FEDERATED STATES OF\nMICRONESIA\n0o 0o\nNAURU\nLakena Matagi KIRIBATI\nNANUMEA INDONESIA NEWPA GPUUIANEA SOLOMON\nISLANDS TUVALU\nSAMOA\n6 o 00'S NORTHERN    ISLANDS 6 o 00'S C o r a l   S e a VANUATU ISCLOAONKDS\nREPUBLIC\nNIUTAO 20o  00'S OFF ITJHIE TONGA 20o  00'S\nISLANDS\nNANUMAGA\nA U S T R A L I A\nS o u t h     P a c i f i c     O c e a n\n150 o 00'E 170 o 00'W\n179 o 00'E\nS  O  U  T  H        P A C I F I C        O C E A N\nNUI\nFenuatapu\nVAITUPU\nN\nCENTRAL    ISLANDS\nNUKUFETAU\n0 20 40 60 80 Fuunaota\nLafaga\nFale\nKilometers Motulalo\nNational Capital\nAirstrip Fualefeke Tegako\nRoad Fuafatu FOGAFALE\nFUNAFUTI\nReef/Atoll\nFunafala\nInternational Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\no\n177  00'E NUKULAELAE\nTumuiloto\nFagaua\n179 o 00'E Niuoku\nFualefeke\nSOUTHERN    ISLANDS\nMulitefala Amatuku\nTepuka\nTegako\nFualopa 10 o 00'S 10 o 00'S\n8 o 30'S 8 o 30'S\nL   a   g   o   o   n\nFuafatu\nFOGAFALE\nFUNAFUTI\nVasafua Fatato\nPapaelise\nFuakea Funamanu NIULAKITA\nFalefatu\nTefala Mateika\nFUNAFUTI  ATOLL\nLua Motu\nTuamotu\nFunafala\nTegasu\nAvalau Telele\nMotuloa\n179 o 00'E 179 o 00'E\n08-4658 HR", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto  Tuvalu  for  the  Improved  Financial  Management  Program.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n \n2.  Tuvalu is small and isolated. It has a land area of only 26 square kilometers (km2) \ncovering nine coral atolls and reef islands spread across more than 900,000 km2 of the Pacific \nOcean. Of the total population of approximately 11,000 persons, more than half live on the \n2.8 km2 island of Fongafale in the Funafuti atoll. The small size and isolation lead to a high-cost \nenvironment for most business activities. Productivity is impaired by capacity constraints that \narise from difficulties faced in generating appropriate competencies and performance and in \nretaining highly skilled individuals.  \n \n3.  Tuvalu\u2019s future growth strategy is set out in its national plan, Te Kakeega II, which was \ndeveloped using an extensive consultative and participatory process.1 Eight strategic areas are \nprioritized including good governance, macroeconomic growth and stability, and employment \nand private sector development. The expected outcomes are more employment opportunities, \nhigher economic growth, better health care, better education, better basic infrastructure, and \ncontinued social stability. In May 2007, the Government adopted five performance benchmark \nindicators (PBIs) to track the achievement of the stated social sector outcomes through a focus \non improved financial management. These are discussed further in paras. 12\u201315. \n \n4.  The  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  supports \nimplementation of Te Kakeega II.2 In the micro-sized economy of Tuvalu, poor decisions about \nexpenditure  allocation  have  significant  opportunity  costs.  For  this  reason,  effective  fiscal \nmanagement will make the greatest contribution to meeting government priorities and is the \nfocus of the CPS.  \n \n5.  Tuvalu\u2019s economy is strongly dependent on external earnings, which are around twice \nthe  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  Sources  include  remittances  from  seafarers,  fishing \nlicenses, the .tv domain name,3 and return on the Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) and Falekaupule \n(local island council) Trust Fund.4 The level of these earnings is determined by global economic \nforces,  and  in  recent  years  external  earnings  have  fallen,  placing  fiscal  pressure  on  the \nGovernment. The TTF is further discussed in Box 1. \n \n6.  The public sector contributes about 70% of GDP and has a direct crowding-out effect on \nthe private sector, undertaking jobs that could be done by private business. In 2005, general \ngovernment employees formed 57% of formal sector employees, with the employees of public \nenterprises accounting for a further 12%. Public sector pay rates are above private sector rates, \nand public sector productivity is low. Agriculture and fishing are the principal private sector \nactivities, but they provide less than 20% of GDP and about 40% of employment.  \n                                                 \n1  Government of Tuvalu. 2005.

In 2002, GDP per capita was about $2,100.5 The Tuvalu economy grew at a real rate of \n7.3% per annum from 1996 to 2002 on the back of an expansion in public construction and \npublic business activities, and growth in the civil service wage bill. The external conditions \nsupporting  high  public  expenditure  have  fallen  away  recently.  GDP  growth  in  2007  was \nestimated at 2%\u20133%, supported by an 18% increase in public spending. The TTF distribution to \nthe budget fell by 16%, and .tv domain name receipts were down by 20%. Overall revenue \nlevels were sustained by a 34% rise in fishing license fees and a 14% rise in external grants. \nTuvalu is now being confronted by rising average annual inflation. Measured in the 2nd quarter \nof 2008, this had reached 4.6% per annum, and the quarterly rise was a substantial 11.4%.  \n \nBox 1: Tuvalu Trust Fund  \n \nThe TTF was established in 1987 through a multilateral agreement among Tuvalu, New Zealand, United Kingdom \n(UK), and Australia. Its purpose is to contribute to the long-term financial viability of Tuvalu by providing an additional \nsource of revenue for the recurrent expenses of the Government of Tuvalu.  \n \nThe TTF was initially capitalized with A$27.1 million in contributions from UK (A$8.5 million), New Zealand (A$8.282 \nmillion), Australia (A$8 million), Tuvalu (A$1.6 million), Japan (A$0.695 million), and the Republic of Korea (A$0.031 \nmillion). The maintained value of the TTF grew to A$103.9 million as of March 2008. At about 2.5 times GDP, the TTF \nhas contributed roughly 11% of the annual government budget each year since 1990. This provides an important \ncushion for Tuvalu's highly variable external income. \n \nThe TTF is governed by a board of directors consisting of one representative each from Tuvalu (chair), Australia, and \nNew Zealand. The UK was initially represented on the board but withdrew following a review in 2003, as a part of a \nbrorader process in which UK withdrew from the Pacific region as a bilateral donor. A separate advisory committee \nconsisting of government and donor representatives provides additional advice and input to trustees\u2019 decision \nmaking. The advisory committee is more widely beneficial to Tuvalu through its reviews of the Government\u2019s budget \nand through provision of advice on macro- and microeconomic issues on a twice yearly basis. The TTF is subject to \nparliamentary scrutiny. Although governance of the TTF is multinational, Tuvalu has significant autonomy over \ninvestment decisions and the use of fund proceeds.  \n \nTrust fund proceeds are invested primarily in Australia in a diversified portfolio of assets reflecting the requirements \nto (i) maintain real purchasing power of the TTF, and (ii) provide a regular stream of income to the Government of \nTuvalu. The TTF is managed by professional fund managers, currently based in Australia, and is monitored by the \nfund  monitor  (consultant  actuaries  who  report  to  the  board  on  a  three-monthly  basis  concerning  investment \nperformance).  However, since the recent collapse in the major stock markets, the total value of the TTF has seen a \ndecline of about 20%. \n \nIn 1991, to provide a mechanism for holding distributions from the TTF until they were required to be drawndown into \nthe budget, the Government of Tuvalu established a second fund, the Consolidated Investment Fund (CIF), into \nwhich TTF earnings would be deposited. The CIF greatly benefits planning by reducing the volatility of drawdowns \nand allowing the Government to continue making them during years when the primary trust fund earnings are zero or \nnegative. Unlike the primary trust fund, governance of the CIF falls entirely upon the Government of Tuvalu. The CIF \ncan be used by the Government as it sees fit, subject to parliamentary appropriation. The CIF also serves as a \nrepository for other intermittent income. Withdrawals from the CIF include drawdowns into the recurrent budget as \nwell as capital reinvestments that are back-transferred into the primary trust fund. Tuvalu has devised a unique, \nbinary structure, with a primary true trust fund operating alongside a secondary revolving fund. \n \nSources: Graham, B. 2005.

Vaiaku, Tuvalu.  \n \n8.  Issues of political economy greatly affect the way Tuvalu\u2019s economy is performing. This \nwas clearly recognized during the public meetings held in preparing Te Kakeega II. This reality \nunderlies the priorities set out in that document. Tuvalu is an egalitarian society, which acts as a \ndisincentive to individual effort and achievement. Tuvalu\u2019s small size means that the population \n                                                 \n5  2002 is the latest year of GDP measurement. The lack of recent key economic statistics in Tuvalu results from a \nsmall statistics office with limited technical capacity and a decision to focus efforts on the consumer price index and \nsocial statistics. Tuvalu has relied on external experts to irregularly update economic statistics.   \n ", "  3\nis bound by close ties. Preserving these relationships is prioritized, and any form of conflict is \navoided, often at substantial cost. There is also an entrenched public perception of government \nas the provider of jobs and services. The expectations with regard to free health care and to \nheavily subsidized education and utility services are deeply entrenched but unsustainable.  \n \n9.  The private sector is affected by cultural constraints on trade in land. Access to land can \nbe problematic, and land cannot be used as collateral when seeking finance. Cultural norms \npresume that when a Tuvaluan enters into business, profits will be shared, and there can also \nbe difficulties in charging kin for goods and services. Such factors reduce the returns and \nincentive for private sector activity. \n \n10.  The development challenges Tuvalu faces are addressed in Te Kakeega II, but a more \ntargeted approach dealing with identified priorities is required. Tuvalu requires enhanced public \nfinancial management, a downsizing of the public sector, and improvements in the business \nregulatory environment to provide a platform for private sector growth so as to build insurance \nagainst volatility. Innovative policies and a willingness to embrace economic and structural \nreforms are needed to achieve economic and employment growth and to ensure that the outer \nislands receive a reasonable share of the benefits of development. \n \nIII.  THE PUBLIC FINANCE SECTOR \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance  \n \n1.  Fiscal Issues \n \n11.  Tuvalu\u2019s  public  financial  management  is  impacted  by  the  volatility  of  its  external \nearnings. The TTF and the Consolidated Investment Fund (CIF) have been designed to alleviate \nsome of the uncertainty this volatility creates. The degree to which the TTF and drawdowns \nfrom the CIF supplement the budget is dependent on the level of TTF returns and is constrained \nby the size of CIF drawdown (4% of TTF maintained value is a sustainable level). This situation \ndoes not guarantee that the resultant adjusted recurrent budget is in surplus or even balanced. \nIndeed, in 2003 through 2005 and again in 2007, adjusted recurrent budget deficits were \nrecorded. Tuvalu is projecting adjusted recurrent budget deficits for 2008 through 2011. The \nglobal economic outlook indicates the likelihood that the TTF will not provide a return in the next \n2\u20133 years and with the projected recurrent deficits, the CIF reserves will be depleted by around \n2011.  In  accordance  with  the  projections  of  the  TTF  advisory  committee  that  reviews  the \nperformance of the Fund twice yearly, the current global conditions, the recent decline in the \nmajor stock markets, particularly in Australia, where the assets of the TTF are predominatly \ninvested,  are  likely  to  affect  the  investment  returns  negatively  leaving  the  Fund  without \ndividends in the next 2-3 years. In addition, the recent hikes in the food and fuel prices built \nfiscal pressures that are still working their way through the Pacific economies, including in \nTuvalu, with the projected fiscal deficits in Tuvalu likely to result in a total drawdown of the \nbalance of about A$12 million currently available in the CIF by 2011.   \n \n12.  Revenue growth, expenditure control, and debt reduction all have an important role to \nplay in lessening volatility. The Government is committed to a program of fiscal restraint. This is \nmost clearly demonstrated by its adoption of a set of five PBIs, which were developed jointly by \nthe Government, ADB, the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), and the \nNew Zealand Agency for International Development (NZAID). The PBIs track the achievement \nof the stated social sector outcomes through a focus on improved financial management and \nfiscal  consolidation.  The  PBIs  are  updated  annually  as  required  in  consultation  with  aid \nagencies to reflect broader fiscal conditions and affordability. The PBIs are as follows: \n ", "4   \n(i)  Benchmark 1.1. The Government\u2019s recurrent expenditure each year should not \nexceed the total of its recurrent revenue plus a sustainable TTF distribution (CIF \ndrawdown).  \n(ii)  Benchmark 1.2. The target minimum value of funds retained in the CIF should \nbe not less than 16% of the maintained value of the TTF at the beginning of the \nTTF year so as to ensure that a sustainable distribution is available to help \nfinance annual budgets.  \n(iii)  Benchmark  1.3.  The  Government\u2019s  total  debt  liability  (both  domestic  and \nexternal) at any time should not exceed 60% of GDP, as specified in Te Kakeega \nII. \n(iv)  Benchmark 2.1.6 In 2008, the Government will increase its budgeted nonsalary \nexpenditure on basic education by at least 5%. \n(v)  Benchmark 2.2. In 2008, the Government will increase its budgeted nonsalary \nexpenditure on primary and preventive health services by at least 5%. \n \nFigure 1:  Trends in Expenditure and Revenue \n \n \n \nA$million\n  60 Estimates\n  50\n \n40\n \n30\n \n  20\n  10\n  0\n  9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\n-10 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n-20\n \n \nExpenditure and net lending Budget balance\n \nSource: Tuvalu Central Statistics Department, Government audited accounts and budget papers, various years. \n \n \n13.  Fiscal performance against the PBIs is monitored by the Tuvalu Trust Fund Advisory \nCommittee (TTFAC), which ensures impartiality, and watched closely by the Government and \nby international aid agencies. Assessment in April 2008 by TTFAC against the 2007 budget \noutturn found that the Government had met benchmarks 1.3, 2.1, and 2.2. Against benchmark \n1.1, TTFAC found that the recurrent budget, when added to the grants\u2019 balance outturn for \n2007, was in deficit of A$2.06 million, which was then reduced to a A$1.04 million deficit after \n                                                 \n6  More specifically, benchmarks 2.1 and 2.2 set clear targets for a specific year (the 5% targets for 2008 being the \nfirst such annual targets) with the intent that these be reset annually in consultation with development partners. It is \nnotable that monitoring of Tuvalu\u2019s performance against benchmark 2.1 (education) against the 2007 budget \noutturn showed that the proportion of the education budget spent on primary education and vocational training \n(excluding salaries, allowances, and scholarships) had increased significantly to 15% (compared with 7% in 2006). \nFor benchmark 2.2 (health) the proportion of the health budget spent on primary and preventive health care \nincreased slightly in 2007 to 18%. The evolving nature of these last two PBIs allows appropriate and agreed upon \nadjustments to be made to the targets, which ensures that these continue to promote fiscally responsible actions \nsupportive of social sector objectives. \n ", "  5\ndeducting the Government\u2019s A$1.02 million contribution to the TTF. As such, the 2007 budget \noutturn did not meet benchmark 1.1. TTFAC stated that benchmark 1.1 was arguably the most \nimportant one. Box 1 provides details about the function and operation of the CIF. TTFAC \nfurther noted against benchmark 1.2 that there was a marked improvement in government \nefforts to achieve the targeted minimum balance.  \n \n14.  Both AusAID and NZAID are already supporting activities that target PBI achievement \nthrough their country programs. AusAID will channel at least 50% of its A$3 million yearly \nprogram allocation for Tuvalu to directly support the PBIs through the TTF. Similarly, NZAID \ncontributes on average 15%\u201320% of its annual allocation of around $1.5 million to the TTF \ntoward achievement of the PBIs. In addition to this support, the AusAID and NZAID programs \nprovide a 10% incentive payment of their respective country allocations upon achievement of \nthe  PBIs,  which  will  be  directed  to  support  Tuvalu\u2019s  recurrent  budget.  This  approximately \nA$0.4 million potential incentive payment is significant and may add as much as 3% to the \nannual budget.  \n \n15.  In response to Tuvalu\u2019s adoption of the PBIs in mid-2007, incentive payments were \nmade to Tuvalu by Australia (A$200,000) and New Zealand (A$90,080). Following TTFAC\u2019s \nApril 2008 assessment that Tuvalu had met three of the five PBIs in 2007, prorated payments \nwere made to Tuvalu by Australia (A$100,000, or 50% of the funds that would have been \navailable if all PBIs had been met) and New Zealand (A$112,000, or 60%) in June 2008. \n \n16.  In terms of supporting revenue growth, ADB has been assisting the Government of \nTuvalu in the area of taxation reform. Currently, Tuvalu\u2019s tax system suffers from an extensive \narray of exemptions, deductions, and allowances that shift the incidence of taxation to particular \nsegments of the community. The situation affects collection, which becomes inequitable and \ninefficient  to  administer.  Furthermore,  compliance  problems  exist,  and  the  Inland  Revenue \nDepartment lacks the necessary administrative powers or appropriate sanctions to deal with \nnoncompliance. External pressure to improve the taxation system comes from the potential loss \nof revenue under the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement, which requires a commitment \nto customs tariff reduction, and its eventual elimination, among parties. Ratification of this \nagreement by Tuvalu is estimated to create a potential revenue loss on imports in the order of \nmore than 14% of current import duty by the time the agreement is fully implemented.7 Alternate \nrevenue sources need to be identified to replace these losses.  \n \n17.  ADB technical assistance (TA) has supported the development of three draft laws (an \nincome tax act amendment, a customs act amendment, and a consumption tax bill) that were \nreferred to Parliament in June 2008. This package of legal amendments is designed to reform \nand update the tax and customs systems in Tuvalu so as to provide the Government with \nsufficient  revenues  to  compensate  for  the  customs  duty  reductions  required  by  the \nGovernment\u2019s ratification of the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement. The package is \ndesigned to be fiscally neutral. The consumption tax bill will bring in a broad-based consumption \ntax (or value-added tax) to counter the anticipated loss of revenue likely to arise from the \nsignature by Tuvalu of certain international agreements, and over a period of time will reduce \nTuvalu\u2019s reliance upon trade taxes. The proposed changes were initially recommended in a \nPacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) consultant\u2019s report in 2004, have been \nreviewed and updated by revenue experts, and reflect input received from public and private \nsector representatives. \n \n                                                 \n7  Tuvalu\u2019s cabinet ratified the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement on 16 April 2008, and this became effective \non 16 May 2008.  \n ", "6   \n18.  The key amendments contained within the package are \n \n(i)  revamping the income tax to create a fairer system with more progressive rates \nthat will be easier to administer for small businesses; \n(ii)  introducing a broad-based consumption tax; \n(iii)  removing the sales tax on imports; \n(iv)  eventually removing the room tax; \n(v)  removing  the  requirement  for  the  Taxation  Office  to  assess  every  individual \nemployee\u2019s tax each year, with the tax paid by employers deemed to be their \nfinal tax unless the taxpayer submits a tax return because he or she believes he \nor she is entitled to a refund; \n(vi)  introducing more effective enforcement provisions to enable the Taxation Office \nto better deal with persistent noncompliers rather than having to take action \nthrough the courts; \n(vii)  introducing  a  \u201ccost\u2013insurance\u2013freight\u201d  basis  of  valuation  for  calculation  of \ncustoms duties; \n(viii)  adopting  a  valuation  regime  for  imports  for  customs  duty  purposes  that  is \nconsistent with World Trade Organization requirements; and \n(ix)  updating the monetary values of penalties and fines that apply in respect of \ncustoms offenses. \n \n19.  Public enterprises have a significant impact on the budget and, more broadly, on fiscal \nposition. In 2005, about 13% of budgeted expenditure was allocated to funding the shortfall in \noperating  revenues  of  public  enterprises  and  the  business-like  units  of  ministries.  This \npercentage is considered likely to have risen. In addition to providing operating subsidies, the \ncapital of almost all public enterprises is provided through government grants that often are \nsupported by funding agencies. The Government has also guaranteed National Bank of Tuvalu \n(NBT) loans of A$1.35 million for corporations that have no capacity to repay these debts and is \nguaranteeing  further  loans  and  overdrafts  for  other  public  enterprises.  Extra-budgetary \nexpenditure in support of public enterprises is considered significant, although it is not well \ntracked. Thus, focused efforts to improve public enterprise performance can be expected to \nprovide a measurable budget saving, freeing government resources for priority areas and/or \ndecreasing the budget deficit. This would variously contribute to meeting PBIs 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, and \n2.2. \n \n20.  Public debt has reached significant levels, and steps to reduce this debt will ease the \nbudget  deficit.  They  would  also  directly  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  PBI  1.3.  The \nGovernment has given a practical indication of its commitment to tackling debt and promoting \nthe  commercial  operations  of  NBT  by  repaying  A$1.0  million  to  the  outer  islands  agency \nsuspense account (OIASA) overdraft in May 2008.8 The Government had an OIASA debt of \nA$3.796 million as of 30 September 2008, with NBT. This is discussed further below; elimination \nof this debt would provide significant benefits to NBT and, more broadly, to the private sector. It \nwould also, at least partially, put in place necessary conditions for consideration of alternate \nownership options, should the Government decide that some form of divestment meets its \nbroader development and other policy objectives.  \n                                                 \n8  NBT in 2004 appointed the Falekaupule (local council) treasurer as official agent for NBT to receive deposits and \nlend money. All transactions were recorded daily and sent by facsimile to NBT in Funafuti. The treasurer was \nallowed a maximum cash holding, and any excess was to be transported back to NBT and deposited into the \nindividual accounts. It appears that the money was instead deposited into the Government\u2019s general account and \nNBT  instead  recorded  the  outstanding  amount  as  a  government  overdraft.  However,  the  Government  had \nstipulated that this overdraft would be non-interest bearing, but with an overdraft at its peak of around A$5.024 \nmillion at the end of 2006, NBT has a foregone income of about A$500,000 per year. \n ", "  7\n21.  Tuvalu does not utilize a medium-term fiscal framework. Formulation of a medium-term \nfiscal  policy  framework  (including  a  multiyear  budget  framework)  to  guide  budgetary \nperformance and to attain balanced budgets has been included in Te Kakeega II but has not yet \nbeen  realized.  Such  a  framework  would  enhance  the  ability  of  the  Government  to  better \nunderstand, plan for, and manage volatility in revenues and expenditure.  \n \n2.  Public Enterprises \n \n22.  The Government of Tuvalu currently owns 11 public corporations, each operating under \nindividual enabling legislation: \n \n(i)  NBT established as the sole commercial bank; \n(ii)  the  Development  Bank  of  Tuvalu  (DBT),  to  provide  concessional  finance  to \nbusiness; \n(iii)  the  Tuvalu  National  Provident  Fund  (TNPF),  the  country\u2019s  compulsory \nsuperannuation scheme; \n(iv)  the National Fishing Corporation of Tuvalu (NAFICOT), to develop export and \nlocal sales of fish by Tuvaluans; \n(v)  the Tuvalu Electricity Corporation (TEC), to provide electrical power on all of the \nisland groups; it is illegal to compete with TEC; \n(vi)  the  Tuvalu  Telecommunications  Corporation  (TTC),  which  provides  phone, \nmobile phone, internet, and other telecommunications services on Funafuti and, \nto a lesser extent, on the outer islands; it is illegal to compete with TTC without \nits consent; \n(vii)  the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute (TMTI), to train seafarers; \n(viii)  the Tuvalu Philatelic Bureau, to produce and sell stamps for mailing and for \ncollectors; \n(ix)  the Vaiaku Lagi Hotel (VLH), to run a hotel, restaurant, and bar on Funafuti;  \n(x)  the  Copra  Trading  Corporation,  to  purchase  and  export  copra  produced \ndomestically; and \n(xi)  the  Tuvalu  Media  Corporation  (TMC),  to  operate  the  only  radio  station; \ncompetition is permitted but unlikely owing to the small size of the economy. 9 \n \n23.  The Government does not have an overall policy for public enterprises that clearly \ndefines  their  purposes  and  objectives,  sets  agreed  upon  levels  of  operation,  provides  the \nnecessary  funding  for  community  service  obligations,  and  sets  out  clear  accountability  for \noperational  and  financial  matters.  Instead,  enterprises  each  operate  under  their  individual \nenabling legislation, and government involvement is dispersed across a number of ministries. \nThe Government had assumed that, once corporatized, the enterprises could be left to their own \ndevices and would operate profitably. This has not proved to be the case.  \n \n24.  Enterprises have budgets, but most do not have business plans. Budgets tend to be \nbased on a traditional government vote-type structure. That is, the budgets are presentations of \nline item expenditure intent, without any link to intended outputs or outcomes. The lack of \nbudgeting against plans is a major limitation in performance management. There generally are \nno targets by which to measure performance. Continuation of the current approach will lead to \ncorporations becoming insolvent and reliant upon growing subsidies and guarantees from the \nGovernment. This is completely the antithesis of why the corporations were established. \n \n                                                 \n9  TMC was decorporatized in 2007 and is now part of the Ministry of Communications and Transport.  \n ", "8   \n25.  The Report of the Auditor General 2006 (released in June 2008) indicates a high level of \ndebt across all enterprises, and that several of the enterprises were operating on overdraft, \nseveral had questionable financial viability, and most did not prepare their own accounts\u2013\u2013\nhence the actual financial situation would likely not be known until the enterprise received an \naudit report.10 Issues of profitability are facing many of the corporations:  \n \n(i)  NAFICOT,  TEC,  and  TTC  have  each  accumulated  losses  of  more  than \nA$1 million. NAFICOT has faced commercial difficulties since its inception, and \nthe Government is now servicing a A$1.23 million loan secured by NAFICOT in \n2003 to purchase fishing vessels. A temporary suspension of the corporation was \nissued in February 2006.  \n \n(ii)  The setting of tariffs by the cabinet at a level below cost and non- or partial \npayment of bills by the Government are key factors behind the poor financial \nperformance of TEC and TTC. Debts owed by the Government to TTC had \naccumulated over a number of years, and in 2007 TTC accepted A$1.2 million \nfrom the Government as full and final payment. Payments owed to TEC by the \nGovernment were estimated to stand at A$0.4 million in 2006, while a payment of \nA$0.1 million toward this was made in 2007. TTC moved to a prepaid service \nsystem  in  2004  but  subsequently  moved  away  from  this  system.  TEC  is \nconsidering such a move although it has concerns about the high upfront capital \ncost.  \n \n(iii)  TMTI does not charge trainees for its services, and TMC has few of its own \nrevenue sources. Both TMTI and TMC are reliant on government subsidies to \nmeet day-to-day expenses.  \n \n(iv)  The Tuvalu Philatelic Bureau now only operates on a small scale and has limited \ncommercial value. \n \n(v)  VLH has been unprofitable over a considerable period, although recently there \nhave been adjustments to the pricing structure and staffing that may engender \nimproved  financial  performance.  Service  quality  is  not  generally  considered \ncommensurate with tariffs. There have been periodic discussions of moving to a \nmanagement  contract  for  VLH.  However,  issues  of  preservation  of  jobs  and \ngovernment maintenance of the assets have proved problematic.   \n \n26.  A number of government businesses are also embedded in individual ministries. These \nare not producing the financial and management reports needed to assess their revenue-\nearning potential. These additional businesses include the main port, stevedoring operations, a \ntravel agency, two interisland vessels, housing, repair shops, outer islands fisheries centers, \nand an internet facility.  \n \n27.  NBT, TNPF, and DBT can lend money, a responsibility that brings with it a wider set of \nconcerns in regard to corporate performance. Only NBT and TNPF are profitable. The lack of a \nfinancial institutions act in Tuvalu means that banking institutions (defined as those institutions \nthat take deposits\u2014in the case of Tuvalu only NBT) are unregulated and unsupervised. The \nresults of this situation are presented below:  \n \n(i)  NBT\u2019s pretax rate of return on assets was 41% in 2007 and 27% in 2006. The \nhigh profits are indicative of market share. NBT\u2019s profitability had previously \nattracted private sector investment interest, although this interest may have been \n                                                 \n10  Office of the Auditor General. 2008.

A recent assessment by PFTAC (July 2008) notes that, while \ncapital is strong, this is needed to support NBT\u2019s less than satisfactory asset \nquality.11 Earnings performance is considered satisfactory, although it appears \noverstated. Earnings potential is hindered by the large volume (about $5 million) \nof non-earning government assets, and this would need to be resolved ahead of \nany consideration of private interest involvement in NBT. Further, NBT\u2019s liquidity \nposition is exposed because of the Government\u2019s and public enterprises\u2019 large \nand unexpected withdrawals. Liquidity problems are further and most significantly \ncompounded at present by the large interest-free OIASA overdraft with NBT. The \ngovernment overdraft is currently costing NBT in the order of at least A$190,000 \nannually in foregone returns. This is significant in comparison with estimated \nprofits in 2008 (using industry best practice measures for its calculation) of less \nthan A$400,000. Further analysis of NBT is provided in Appendix 2.  \n \n(ii)  TNPF  holds  most  of  its  funds  offshore,  and  this  investment  strategy  has \nunderpinned good commercial performance over time. TNPF has entered into \nlending operations, allowing members to borrow against their contributions. The \nimplications of this for performance, and sustained operations as an effective \nprovider of superannuation benefits, are substantial but have not been widely \ninvestigated. \n \n(iii)  DBT has at times reported a profit but typically operates at a loss, and it was \nrequired to write down more than A$1 million in bad debts in 2003.  \n \n28.  The problems faced by public enterprises with regard to operating profitably are not new; \nthey have plagued enterprises since corporatization. The Government has remained concerned \nbut has not had a clear vision for addressing and remedying the problems. Te Kakeega II \nidentified a number of priorities to improve public enterprise management, all of which are still to \nbe implemented: \n(i)  Strengthen management and staff. \n(ii)  Produce annual reports and audited accounts in accordance with legislation, with \nboth available to the public. \n(iii)  Clearly define, cost out, and better target government subsidies. \n(iv)  Assess the viability of privatizing selected public enterprises. \n(v)  Improve the selection process of boards of directors of public enterprises, and \nbroaden membership. \n(vi)  Establish clear guidelines on the roles and responsibilities of ministers, boards, \nand management of public enterprises.  \n \n29.  Each of these issues is important. However, what is lacking is the substance that binds \nthe individual issues into a clear framework and provides for the necessary prioritization and \nsequencing of activities in support of improved public enterprise governance and performance. \nThe establishment of the policy, planning, and legal frameworks to support government decision \nmaking  with  regard  to  corporations  is  a  priority  need.  The  intermittent  and  inconclusive \ndiscussions  regarding  various  ownership  and  management  options  for  NBT  and  VLH,  the \ncontinued losses by NAFICOT, and the lack of discussion regarding ownership of TTC are \nsymptomatic of the lack of an overarching approach to public corporation performance and to \nconsideration  of  the  role  of  the  public  sector  in  the  provision  of  goods  and  services. \nImplementation of specific reforms (including ownership and management arrangements) to \n                                                 \n11  PFTAC. 2008.

Issues and Opportunities  \n \n30.  Fiscal and public enterprise reform has been under way in the Pacific since the early \n1990s. Yet the Pacific is littered with more stories of failure than success. The ADB-funded \nprogram loans in the Pacific during the 1990s mostly fell short of intended impacts. Lessons \nfrom success or failure are inherent in both the technical designs of the reform programs as well \nas  the  frameworks  within  which  the  reforms  have  been  implemented.  Lessons  from  this \nexperience have been summarized by Saldanha and Knapman, as follows:12  \n \n(i)  Insufficient attention was paid to the need for political commitment, ownership, \nand participation in design and in implementation. \n(ii)  Design needs to more carefully consider sequencing, scoping, and phasing, and \nto be more pragmatic. \n(iii)  A much longer-term perspective is needed. \n(iv)  Inputs, process, outputs, and impacts should be more carefully distinguished. \n(v)  Timeliness can be key, e.g., reforms were put in place in the case of the Cook \nIslands following a debt crisis. \n(vi)  Island cultures, traditions, and the political economy influence outcomes. \n(vii)  Other lessons relate to the need for appropriate staffing, consultants, and staff \nengagement in design and implementation. \n \n31.  Government willingness and commitment to implementation have also often not been \nevident with sufficient robustness to sustain improvements after external assistance has ended. \nThe reasons for nonsustainability differ, some being associated with the social and political \nimplications of the activities. Other reasons are that there was no real depth of understanding of \neither the rationale or the application, such that the activities simply faded away.  \n \n32.  A further lesson is the benefits to implementation and sustainability of the appropriate \nuse of consultative and participatory processes. For example, the program completion report on \nthe  fiscal  and  financial  reform  program  included  as  major  lessons  the  \u201cneed  for  prior, \ntransparent, and participatory assessment of the social and political feasibility and sustainability \nof reforms; \u2026 A more participatory assessment could, of course, determine that no reform \nprogram is feasible.\u201d13 The inclusion of appropriate outreach activities to support stakeholder \neducation and public awareness and to strengthen implementation has been successfully used \nin  the  ongoing  technical  assistance  for  capacity  building for  taxation  reform.14  Indeed,  the \nGovernment  employed  extensive  consultation  and  participation  in  the  development  of  Te \nKakeega II. The use of consultation and participation methodology in the TA supporting the \nproposed  Program  grant  will  be  essential  to  successful  program  implementation  and \nsustainability of impact. The lessons of Pacific experience provide valuable guidance to the \ndesign of a reform Program to address factors behind Tuvalu\u2019s weak fiscal performance. \n \n33.  The  Tuvalu  CPS  2008\u20132012  notes  a  number  of lessons  from  the  relatively  limited \nnumber of ADB loans and grants provided to the country (footnote 2). It is recognized that, in \nthe past, development partners\u2019 programs have been spread thinly over a number of sectors \n                                                 \n12  Knapman B, and C.

Implementation  has  often  been  resource-intensive  for  all \npartners, and aid coordination was poor until recently. TA operations have not been well aligned \nwith the Government\u2019s priorities and have often created dependency. Although there has been \nongoing support for the TTF, little attention has been paid to fiscal management. As a result, TA \nassistance to Tuvalu has not produced sustainable improvements in capacity and in operations, \nand maintenance costs of infrastructure projects have rarely been met. The most relevant \nlessons include (i) the need to integrate assistance within government frameworks and systems; \n(ii) the importance of focus; (iii) the need to ensure that TA operations are well defined, well \ndesigned, and well managed by Tuvalu; (iv) the importance of good fiscal management; and, \nabove all (v) much better coordination and collaboration with development partners, starting with \nthe Government\u2019s full disclosure of planned and approved interventions. \n \n34.  Import-dependent Tuvalu is open to global economic forces and has been negatively \naffected by poor global market performance and rising fuel and food prices. The current, and \nexpected ongoing, budget deficit is creating an unsustainable fiscal situation. The deficits being \nexperienced have been increased by the lack of fiscal restraint in previous years, as a result of \nwhich recurrent financial commitments have been allowed to build up. The Government has not \ntaken a medium-term approach to budgeting and does not use a medium-term fiscal framework \n(MTFF), which would assist in planning and reallocation of resources against priorities. The \nGovernment must improve its capacity to control expenditure and generate revenue to address \nthe deficit. In many countries, the private sector makes a substantial contribution to government \nrevenue. However, in Tuvalu the opportunities for private sector growth are very limited. Current \nliquidity  problems  in  the  financial  system  further  reduce  incentives  for  private  business \ndevelopment.  \n \n35.  The Government of Tuvalu holds domestic and external debt, and in 2007 debt service \ncosts were estimated to amount to 7% of recurrent expenditure. The debt is a drain on limited \ngovernment resources, and weak monitoring of the debt is indicative that the drain on the \nbudget will continue. While the external debt is on concessional terms, the domestic debt is \nhaving a negative impact on the performance of NBT, which is the provider of funds. Several of \nthe domestic debtors (NAFICOT, TMC) are not making payments, which restricts the liquidity of \nNBT and reduces its return on assets. This reduces NBT\u2019s effectiveness as a financier to the \nprivate sector. \n \n36.  Government-owned public corporations place a further call on government expenditure. \nRising global commodity prices have necessitated increased subsidies to offset the rising cost \nof  all  imported  items  such  as  fuel  and  food.  Government  subsidies  (untied,  generally \nnonrepayable  and  non-interest  bearing)  to  public  enterprises  are  often  unplanned  and \nunbudgeted, placing a further burden on the Government. Nine of the 11 corporations are \nalways loss incurring, with subsidies given to enable them to continue operating. Tariff setting \nby the cabinet at a level below cost and non- or partial payment of bills by the Government \ncontribute to the nonprofitability of several corporations. Some, like the Tuvalu Philatelic Bureau, \nTuvalu Copra Trading Corporation, and NAFICOT, have not submitted financial reports for a \nnumber of years, and therefore no audited accounts can be prepared.  \n \n37.  There  appears  to  be  no  clear  understanding,  by  the  Government  or  the  corporate \nentities  of  the  changes  in  roles  and  responsibilities  required  under  corporatization.  The \nexpectation was that corporate entities would become profitable simply by being corporatized. \nTMC has recently been decorporatized, although the legal basis for so doing is unclear. The \nthinking in doing this was that providing closer government control would address financial \nperformance issues.  \n ", "12  \n38.  Discussion of potential privatization of enterprises has polarized enterprise staff and the \nGovernment,  and  has  confused  the  public  in  the  absence  of  information  on  options  or \nimplications. A private sector investor expressed interest in NBT, but discussions were not \nsuccessfully concluded. Similarly, there have been various expressions of interest in VLH, but \nno meaningful talks have taken place. These have all been instances wherein the private sector \nhas  approached  the  Government,  rather  than  being  a  response  to  government  action  to \nspecifically  seek  out  interest.  Thus,  while  it  cannot  be  definitively  said  that  the  previously \nconsidered changes would have improved service provision and reduced the demands on the \ngovernment  budget,  a  government  policy  position  on  public  corporation  ownership  and  a \nframework within which to consider options would have better placed the Government to make \ntransparent decisions in regard to the approaches received.  \n \n39.  The corporations are each governed under their own act of Incorporation, but there is no \noverarching  legislation  that  sets  out  the  requirements  of  a  corporation,  or  government \nresponsibilities with respect to the corporations. While corporations are allocated to ministerial \noversight, no formal regulation or monitoring occurs. Corporations generally do not prepare \ncorporate plans and have few if any performance targets, and many neither prepare nor submit \nannual reports. While most have boards, board members say they have never had a clear \nstatement of their role or legal responsibilities, and even if they knew, in the absence of plans \nand performance targets, their capacity to assist and monitor the performance of the general \nmanager is negligible.  \n \n40.  Political  representation  on  boards  and  the  shortage  of  competent  directors  without \nconflicts of interest are further problems. All public corporations are chaired by a government \nrepresentative (Appendix 3), which creates the potential for political pressure to be placed on \nboards and hence on public corporations. This risk is increased when directors, as a group, lack \nexpertise in areas such as accounting, human resource management, and/or the technical \nfunctions undertaken by the public corporation.  \n \n41.  Staff  skills  within  public  enterprises  are  generally  weak,  especially  in  planning  and \naccounting. A few general managers are considered to be performing very well, and in these \ninstances the performance of the corporation has improved. However, corporate performance is \ngenerally contingent on the willingness of the person to stay in the role. No succession planning \nis in place, and education scholarships do not appear to be tied to the commercial, professional, \nand technical requirements of the country.  \n \n42.  Three corporations (NBT, TNPF, and DBT) are able to lend money, while NBT also \ntakes deposits. However, there is no overarching financial sector legislation binding NBT\u2019s \ndeposit-taking activities. This greatly increases the risk being faced by the corporatized entity as \nwell as by borrowers and depositors.  \n \n43.  Detailed analysis of the problems and constraints identified is in Appendix 4.  \n \n44.  The following opportunities have been identified as priorities: \n \n(i)  improved  debt  risk  management  planning  and  debt  repayment  by  the \nGovernment to NBT; \n(ii)  putting in place a strong governance framework to guide government thinking on \nthe performance of corporations and public enterprises;  \n(iii)  improved corporation performance and oversight through improving the selection \nprocess of boards and broadening board membership, as well as establishing \n ", "  13\nclear guidelines on the roles and responsibilities of ministers in relation to public \ncorporations;  \n(iv)  provision of the legal means to ensure compliance of lending institutions with \ninternationally agreed upon standards;  \n(v)  examination of the level of subsidies, and means by which these are currently \nbeing provided to public corporations with a view to reducing the volume of \nsubsidies and targeting these to cover the cost of providing for clearly identified \ncommunity service obligations;  \n(vi)  review of tariffs and tariff-setting practices;  \n(vii)  an MTFF, already committed to by the Government through Te Kakeega II,  \nwhich will enable Te Kakeega II requirements to be sequenced according to what \nis financially achievable and to identify the necessary groundwork for longer-term \nachievement  of  objectives,  thus  contributing  to  a  continuous  planning  and \nrevision process; and  \n(viii)  further strengthening of development partner cooperation. \n \n45.  The timing is good to address these opportunities. Recent actions by the Government \nindicate  a  commitment  to  change.  For  example,  adoption  of  the  PBIs  provides  progress \nmeasures  and  incentives  for  more  thorough  planning  and  budgeting.  It  also  enables \ndevelopment partners to align their assistance to PBI achievements, thus reducing the likelihood \nof a fiscal crisis. The Government\u2019s demonstrated commitment to reducing its debt with NBT \nthrough repayment of A$1 million in May 2008 is another indicator of its commitment to reform.  \n \n46.  Further, tax reforms planned for introduction in mid-2009 will improve the equity of tax \napplication as well as tax revenue. The development of these reforms has been supported \nthrough ADB TA (footnote 14). \n \n47.  ADB\u2019s assistance has been designed to create understanding and commitment and will \nbe  supported  by  the  depth  of  skill  transfer  to  enable  sustainability  to  support  an  ongoing \nprogram of reform. In setting out the proposed Program below, consideration has been given to \nthe lessons of past policy-based program loans in the Pacific as well as to the issues and \nopportunities  presented  above.  These  have  been  used  to  formulate  actions  for  tranche \nconditions to provide for a practical demonstration of the Government\u2019s commitment to program \nimplementation. Specifically, tranche conditions have been carefully sequenced to (i) test and \nsecure government commitment to improved fiscal and enterprise management; (ii) ensure that \nthe  Government  undertakes  some  of  the  technical  pre-Program  preparation  ahead  of  TA \nsupport, particularly with regard to a short review of private sector opportunities and successes; \nand (iii) ensure that the Government understands the implications of key components of the \nProgram, based on the issues above, through extensive discussions on issues, opportunities, \nand their implications before committing to the conditionalities.  \n \n  IV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n48.  The intended impact of the Program, as set out in the design and monitoring framework \n(Appendix 1) and to be supported by the Program grant and TA, is sustained economic growth \nand fiscal stability as prioritized in the objectives of Te Kakeega II. Indicators of success are the \nPBIs. The expected outcome is improved fiscal planning and management capacity.  \n \n \n \n ", "14  \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n \n49.  The proposed Program is structured around three outputs supporting (i) improved public \ndebt  management  capacity,  (ii)  strengthened  oversight  of  public  enterprises,  and \n(iii) strengthened  management  capacity  in  public  enterprises.  The  outputs  are  designed  to \ndirectly  address  the  core  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership,  which  focuses  on  effective  fiscal \nmanagement. The Program will place under an integrated framework for effective government \ndecision making a number of areas where the Government has indicated priority issues to be \naddressed and has even initiated some actions. In this way, coordination and coherence among \nefforts to promote fiscal stability and improve public enterprise performance can be achieved. \n \n50.  The  Program  will  take  a  two-pronged  approach  by  focusing  at  the  macro  level  of \ngovernment  to  improve  public  debt  management  capacity  and  by  creating  the  policy  and \nlegislative environment for improved performance of all public enterprises. The Program will \nsimultaneously require that all enterprises put in place management and planning tools that will \nbetter enable the enterprises to understand and improve their performance and enable the \nboards of directors for public corporations and the Government to monitor performance and \nintervene, if necessary. The Program will support the introduction of appropriate corporate \nplanning, budgeting, and financial forecasting and improved management skills and systems for \nenterprises; and, therefore, the strengthened capacity of enterprises to manage, report, and \ncomply with requirements under a new public corporations act and so work toward profitability.  \n \n51.  The Program will assist the Government in putting in place a policy and legislative \nframework  that  will  support  sound  decision  making  regarding  public  corporations  and \ngovernment business enterprises. Instead of focusing directly on privatization, the Program will \naim to get the governance framework right to put the Government in the best position to make \nsound ownership decisions. Further, political will for privatization needs time to develop. The \nProgram will help create this pro-reform environment, and it is expected that the Government \nwill then commence making decisions regarding appropriate ownership options for specific \npublic  corporations.  Decisions  surrounding  the  ownership  and  management  of  public \ncorporations will, by their very nature, be ongoing and will continue beyond the time period of \nthe Program. At the same time, ensuring that the tools and skills for improved performance have \nbeen put in place within corporations and within areas of the Government responsible for their \noversight  is  necessary  to  enable  the  corporations  to  respond  to  the  improved  policy  and \nlegislative environment. Reform requires continuous attention so that adjustments can be made \nto reap the opportunities provided by changing internal and external conditions. The Program \nwill start Tuvalu on the path to heightened corporation performance, private sector development, \nand strengthened fiscal management.  \n \n52.  Output 1\u2014Improved Public Debt Management Capacity. The Program will support \nthe development and implementation of a debt risk management and mitigation policy and \nstrategy. The intent is to help the Government move to a more sustainable debt level and to \nensure  that  financial  risks  are  at  prudent  levels.  The  policy  and  strategy  will  build  the \nGovernment\u2019s capacity to manage its commitment to meeting PBI 1.3 (para. 12). The policy and \nstrategy will be based on risk analysis undertaken by the Ministry of Finance and Economic \nPlanning (MFEP) and will utilize the valuable debt information provided biannually by TTFAC. \nThe policy and strategy can also be potentially used to facilitate dialogue on the use and scope \nof debt management tools and their capacity for integration with other financial planning and \nmanagement tools.  \n \n ", "  15\n53.  The policy and strategy will be inclusive of \n(i)  processes by which guarantees and debt are analyzed ahead of being entered \ninto;  \n(ii)  processes and responsibilities for approval of new debt; \n(iii)  consideration of interest rate and foreign currency risks of existing and proposed \nnew debt; \n(iv)  clear presentation of debt and planned debt payments in the annual budget; \n(v)  strengthened coordination between MFEP and other stakeholders in the issue of \npublic debt;  \n(vi)  debt repayment priorities;  \n(vii)  processes for scheduling debt repayment;  \n(viii)  a  mechanism  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  entry  into  discussions  regarding \ngovernment debts that are not subject to a payment schedule and for which \nrescheduling would be beneficial;  \n(ix)  a  schedule  of  timely  and  standardized  reporting  on  the  Government\u2019s  debt \nportfolio; and \n(x)  regular updating of the debt strategy for fiscal results and its alignment with the \nfiscal and macroeconomic forecasts in the budget and in an MTFF as this is \ndeveloped.  \n \n54.  The counterpart funds generated from the grant will allow for the Government\u2019s full \nrepayment of the OIASA overdraft to NBT. The total amount of the overdraft is estimated at \nA$3,795,610.15 Any remaining counterpart funds will be directed by the Government toward \nother  outstanding  debt  to  NBT.  Such  repayments  will  directly  facilitate  the  Government\u2019s \nachievement of PBI 1.3 (para. 12) by reducing its total debt liability. The overdraft repayment will \nsupport the intended outcome of the Program set out in the policy matrix through improving the \nGovernment\u2019s debt position while simultaneously improving the performance indicators for NBT. \nThis should improve the flow of capital to the private sector by alleviating the liquidity constraints \non NBT. In this way, the private sector can be encouraged to take up new and emerging \nopportunities, particularly those generated as the Government makes decisions regarding its \nbusiness enterprises.  \n \n55.  The taxation reforms, as detailed in paras. 16\u201318, are anticipated to support more \nefficient  delivery  of  government  services  and  greater  pro-growth  public  investment  in \ninfrastructure by directly improving government taxation services and providing the resources to \nsupport the Government\u2019s overall expenditure decision making in line with Tuvalu's national \nplan. This will also improve the capacity of the Government to manage its debt risk. The longer-\nterm  impact  of  the  reforms  will  contribute  to  the  creation  of  a  more  supportive  business \nenvironment (through a more equitable taxation system, improved infrastructure, and more \nefficient  government  services  supported  by  enhanced  revenue  management),  which  will \nincrease the potential for private sector activity and investment. The enabling legislation for \ntaxation  reform  is  expected  to  be  approved  in  the  parliamentary  session  commencing \n17 November 2008. The intended implementation date is 1 July 2009. ADB considers the \nelements of the taxation reform package listed in para. 18 as being essential to its success and \nrequires these components to be included in the legislation approved by Parliament to ensure \nthat the related tranche 1 condition is achieved.  \n \n56.  Output  2\u2014Strengthened  Oversight  of  Public  Enterprises.  The  Government  will \nreview and restructure its public enterprise oversight arrangements to improve management of \nthe enterprise monitoring process and performance outcomes. To date, the Government does \n                                                 \n15   Government of Tuvalu. 2008. Information Brief. Funafuti. Provided to AusAID, NZAID, and ADB, 22 September.  \n ", "16  \nnot have a strategic or policy-based approach; hence public enterprise performance issues are \nbeing approached very differently across and within ministries on an ad hoc basis (without an \nunderstanding of underlying causes).  \n \n57.  Improved  oversight  will  include  changes  to  institutional  arrangements  through  the \nestablishment  of  a  public  enterprise  reform  steering  committee  that  is  representative  of \nTuvaluan society, given the focus on public corporations and public goods. The composition of \nthe steering committee should adequately reflect its tasks\u2013\u2013hence the need for it to (i) be \nchaired by a senior official (secretary of MFEP); (ii) have representatives from the Government; \nand (iii) have representatives from the public (who are end users of these public goods), \nincluding women and the disadvantaged. An important role of the steering committee will also \nbe to review lessons in enterprise ownership and management, and to facilitate the application \nof lessons to ongoing activities. A public enterprises unit (comprising two professional staff plus \na secretary) will be established, through consolidating currently dispersed oversight roles, and it \nwill become the interface between public enterprises and the Government. Through these \nstructures,  a  detailed  and  time-bound  action  plan  to  address  issues  underlying \nunderperformance of corporations and government businesses will be developed.  \n \n58.  An important element of the Program will be the development and implementation of a \ncabinet-approved public enterprise governance reform strategic policy to assist government \nthinking on the performance of corporations and public enterprises. The strategic policy will be \ninclusive of  \n(i)  Government\u2019s service delivery priorities and requirements;  \n(ii)  identification of strategic assets and why these are classified as such;  \n(iii)  position on ownership of enterprises;  \n(iv)  consideration of options for ownership and divestment in relation to each enterprise; \n(v)  a process for, and scope of, review of the social and sustainability implications of \nchanges in ownership of government assets; and  \n(vi)  identification of small government business-like activities for possible transfer to the \nprivate sector, either through sale or contracting out.  \n \n59.  The strategic policy will promote understanding of the issues that arise in changing \nownership and/or management of public corporations. Given Tuvalu\u2019s starting point of no policy \nto guide decisions on ownership and management, and no overall legislation on performance \noversight of public corporations, specific decisions on ownership are not expected within the \nprogram period but would be viewed positively should they occur. The Program will be flexible \nto support specific changes wherein the Government proves willing to move ahead. Future ADB \nsupport  is  contemplated  (footnote  2).16  The  intent  of  this  Program  grant  is  to  help  the \nGovernment  reach  a  point  at  which  reform  decisions  can  be  taken  from  a  position  of \nunderstanding.  \n \n60.  The Program will support the implementation of the public enterprise governance reform \nstrategic policy through the preparation of a draft public corporations act. The draft act will \nprovide a legal framework for the establishment and divestment of public enterprises, including \nreporting requirements for public enterprises and related monitoring by the Government. In \nparticular, the draft public corporations act will include \n(i)  establishment of public enterprises as bodies corporate;   \n                                                 \n16  Page 68 of the CPS states, \u201cdepending on the outcome of the 2008 grant program, another grant and/or lending \nprogram will be considered for 2009\u20132010 with the focus to more broadly address the inefficiencies of the public \nenterprises and thereby reinforce ADB\u2019s focus on improved financial management.\u201d  \n ", "  17\n(ii)  role of the board of directors and management, and the procedure and criteria for \nappointment and dismissal of directors and managers; \n(iii)  requirement for periodic disclosure of information and filing of audited accounts; \n(iv)  procedure for decorporatization (if any) and the implications thereof;17 \n(v)  roles of the relevant minister and the auditor general;  \n(vi)  provision for the introduction of performance contracts for management based on \nagreed upon outputs; and \n(vii)  penalties for noncompliance with the public corporations act. \n \n61.  The provision of such a clear regulatory framework is particularly important in a small \nsociety with close kinship links such as Tuvalu. Clarity in regulatory requirements will reduce the \npotential for discretion by individuals in the application of policies and so will reduce the ability of \ninterest groups to place inappropriate pressures on decision makers and bureaucrats with \nregulatory  functions.  Appendix  4  (problems  and  constraints  analysis)  contains  further \nassessment of social and cultural constraints in Tuvalu.  \n \n62.  Pursuant to the enactment of the public corporations act, revisions will be made in the \ngoverning acts of each public enterprise to reflect changes introduced by the public corporations \nact.  A  framework  for  relationships  and  powers  of  authority  of  the  relevant  ministers  of \ncorporatized entities will also be developed. The Program will also consider the legal status, \nunder the proposed new bill, of the Tuvalu Copra Trading Corporation, NAFICOT, and the \nTuvalu  Philatelic  Bureau  (which  currently  are  considered  by  the  auditor  general  to  be \ncorporations, although they do not have their own legal framework). \n \n63.  The Program will support an assessment of the trends and level of current subsidies \nincluding the management issues that form the basis for the subsidy or overdraft request and \nwill  develop  clear  plans  to  reduce  and  eliminate  these  within  a  defined  time  frame.  This \nassessment will include review of the extent (if any) to which subsidies are required to cover \ncosts  of  essential  but  nonprofitable  services.  The  assessment  will  review  the  merits  of \nintroducing community service obligation contracts and payments based on negotiation of fees \nand services between the corporation and the Government.  \n \n64.  More specifically, the Program will also address the financial sustainability issue being \nfaced by TEC and TTC by reviewing existing studies and assessing the current tariff levels as a \nbasis for providing options as to how the financial requirements of these public enterprises could \nbe  balanced  with  the  cost  of  the  community  service  obligations  required  of  them  by  the \nGovernment. The intent is to move TTC and TEC to a financially sustainable basis wherein \nnonprofitable social services are transparently funded by the Government.  \n \n65.  The scope of the Program will also extend to assessing the viability of improving the \nperformance  of  the  small  business-like  activities  that  are  embedded  in  ministry  functions, \nincluding through the contracting out of these services to the private sector. The capacity and \npotential  of  government  noncorporatized  businesses  will  be  assessed,  and  planning  and \nreporting frameworks based on the templates for enterprises will be introduced and built as \nfound beneficial. \n \n66.  The Government does not have a detailed understanding of the scope of private sector \nopportunities in Tuvalu (and reflecting differing opportunities on Funafuti and on the outer \n                                                 \n17  In Tuvalu, decorporatization has involved bringing a public corporation back within the structure and direct control \nof a ministry as opposed to being apart from ministries and being overseen by a board. There will need to be \nspecific consideration of the legal status of the decorporatized Tuvalu Media Corporation. \n ", "18  \nislands). While Tuvalu\u2019s small population, dispersed geographical nature, and currently limited \ntransportation linkages place natural barriers upon the scope for private sector development, an \nanalysis  of  patterns  in  private  sector  lending,  business  licensing,  and  human  resource \ncapacities in the private sector would allow the Government to identify potential areas for growth \nand niche markets. The Program will carry out this analysis. This will be of particular use when \nlooking at government business activities currently embedded within ministries but that could be \ncontracted out. This understanding will help the Government when approached by foreign \ninvestors.  \n \n67.  Output 2 is expected to impact on Tuvalu\u2019s budgetary position by facilitating the ability of \nthe Government to control the level of subsidies being demanded by, and directed to, public \ncorporations and by improving the financial performance of public enterprises. This will alleviate \nexpenditure demands and so assist the Government in achieving PBI 1.1 (para. 12). PBIs 1.3, \n2.1, and 2.2 will be indirectly assisted, as better expenditure management will free funds that \nthe Government can direct to support achievement of these other PBIs.  \n \n68.  Output 3\u2014Strengthened Management Capacity in Public Enterprises. The Program \nwill facilitate a review of the role of the board of directors in public enterprises and of its \nmembership. The intended result will be a series of recommendations to strengthen board \nperformance. These should include a clear understanding of the relationship between the board \nand the general manager and the requirement for role separation, and the coverage to the \ndegree  possible  of  all  major  roles  and  skill  requirements  (financial,  human  resource \ndevelopment, technical, etc.) by board members.  \n \n69.  At the micro level, the Program will work with general managers and boards of public \nenterprises to develop and implement a corporate plan and an action plan for each enterprise to \nassist them to meet the requirements of the public corporations act, based on the Government\u2019s \npublic  enterprise  governance  reform  strategic  policy.  The  capacity  of  boards  and  general \nmanagers will be improved in preparation, management, and monitoring. Auditor control issues \nwill  be  incorporated  into  the  corporate  plans,  with  quarterly  and  annual  progress  reports \nprepared  to  address  issues  raised  by  the  auditor  general.  Templates  will  be prepared  for \ncorporate plans, annual reports, and quarterly reports to the board.  \n \n70.  The  Program  will  support  improvements  in  accounting  and  human  resource \nmanagement in public enterprises. Accounting will be improved through the introduction of basic \naccounting skills as required, allowing accounts to be prepared and submitted to the board (and \nthen to the Public Enterprise Unit) in standardized formats and on time. Priority will be accorded \nto the development or recruitment of financial management expertise for all enterprises. Job \ndescriptions will be developed for use by enterprises, together with a performance appraisal \nformat. The merits of introducing performance contracts for general managers (initially) based \non achievement of corporate plan targets will be considered. This will also act as a mechanism \nfor  the  board  to  control  excesses  in  salary  increases  and  employment  conditions  without \ncommensurate performance improvement. \n \n71.  The Program will make a specific target of NBT, reflecting its vital role as a provider of \nfinance  to  the  private  sector.  Improved  NBT  performance  can  reduce  lending  costs  for \nborrowers. The intent is to recognize NBT\u2019s status as Tuvalu\u2019s most profitable public enterprise, \nto ensure that the conditions that have supported this profitability are sustained, and to further \naddress issues concerning performance. The required actions will also improve NBT\u2019s operating \npolicies and remove constraints to private sector investor interest in NBT. \n \n ", "  19\n72.  The  Program  will  support  specific  changes  in  NBT  policy  and  practice  directed  at \nimproved performance. Board-approved revisions in NBT\u2019s policies for the timely collection of \npast due loans and advances of credit are needed to comply with international best practices. \nThe written collection policy should include specific and increasingly more stringent actions \n(comprising telephone contact, personal visits with the borrower, and demand letters) to be \ntaken for the collection of past due loans, and the time lines for each action. The adoption of a \nwritten and board-approved liquidity policy is needed to better measure, monitor, and maintain \nadequate  liquidity.  This  policy  should  (i)  provide  for  the  establishment  of  an  asset\u2013liability \nmanagement committee and determine its responsibilities; (ii) determine authorities to make \nliquidity and funds management decisions, and require reporting on these; (iii) set loan\u2013deposit \nratios; (iv) set liquidity target parameters; (v) require maturity gap analysis reports of realizable \nearning assets (excluding nonperforming loans) and liabilities; and (vi) require regular reviews of \nNBT\u2019s deposit structure.   \n \n73.  Further, the Program will promote the adoption and implementation of a legal framework \nfor the licensing and ongoing supervision and regulation of banking institutions that provides for \nimplementation  of,  and  adherence  to,  the  Basel  core  principles  for  effective  banking \nsupervision.18  Financial  supervision  will  be  conducted  to  enhance  the  stability,  reliability, \ntransparency, and efficiency of the financial sector to reduce systemic risks and to prevent the \nabuse of the financial sector for criminal purposes, with a view to protecting the interests of \nclients and investors by safeguarding their financial resources, and thereby supporting financial \nstability.  \n \n74.  This component of the Program will be directly supported by PFTAC, and is reflective of \nstrong fiscal and financial sector aid coordination in Tuvalu. NBT undertakes both deposit-taking \nand lending and so will be immediately covered by the legal framework developed. DBT and \nTNPF are both currently providing only lending services so will not be included in the coverage \nof the legal framework until such time as they embark upon deposit-taking.  \n \n75.  Output 3 will support achievement of the PBIs both directly and indirectly. Output 3 will \nsupport the Government in ensuring that public corporations generate less fiscal demand and \nmay support the move of some to a positive financial outcome and hence the Government\u2019s \nearning of dividends. This will alleviate expenditure demands and so assist the Government in \nachieving  PBI  1.1  (para.  12).  PBIs  1.3,  2.1,  and  2.2  will  be  indirectly  assisted,  as  better \nexpenditure management will free funds that the Government can use to support achievement \nof these other PBIs.  \n \n76.  Leveraging Change. The Program will set Tuvalu on a path of reform, with the tranche \nconditions playing an important role in leveraging needed changes. The tranche conditions will \ndevelop the Government\u2019s understanding of the need for reforms and will act to create an \nenvironment in which reformist actions can be taken.  \n \n77.  The  first  set  of  tranche  conditions  will  act  to  demonstrate  both  the  Government\u2019s \ncommitment to reform and broader parliamentary support for priority reforms. This will be done \nthrough, first, requiring Parliament to pass legislation reforming the taxation system (para. 16\u2013\n18). Passing of the taxation reform legislation will be the outcome of a considerable process of \npublic  consultation  and  parliamentary  scrutiny  through  three  readings  of  the  proposed \nlegislation. The first tranche conditions will also elicit government commitment to move forward \nwith  the  reforms  through  cabinet  approval  for  the  development  of  a  public  enterprise \n                                                 \n18 Bank for International Settlements. 2006. Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. Basel Committee on \nBanking Supervision. Basel, Switzerland.  \n ", "20  \ngovernance reform strategic policy, a public corporations act, and a debt risk management and \nmitigation policy and strategy. Achieving cabinet commitment to this work will require cabinet \ndiscussion and understanding of the scope and intent of these proposed policies, strategies, \nand legislation. Finally, the first set of tranche conditions will require the Government (MFEP) to \nundertake preliminary analysis of the private sector\u2019s growth potential, and in so doing a better \nunderstanding of the potential longer-term benefits flowing out of reforms will be generated.  \n \n78.  The second set of tranche conditions will require firm reformist actions on the part of the \nGovernment. The cabinet will need to put in place policies and strategies to guide them in \nreform implementation\u2014through cabinet approval of the public enterprise governance reform \nstrategic policy and the debt risk management and mitigation policy and strategy. Parliament\u2019s \ncommitment to reform will also be leveraged through the second tranche conditions. Tabling of \na public corporations act will be required, as will the adoption of a legal framework for the \nlicensing  and  ongoing  supervision  and  regulation  of  banking  institutions.  Second  tranche \nconditions  will  require  the  Government  to  cause  the  operational  policies  of  one  public \ncorporation to be strengthened\u2014NBT should have in place written and board-approved policies \nfor the timely collection of past due loans and advances of credit and for measuring, monitoring, \nand maintaining adequate liquidity. The second tranche will also require government action to \nreduce its debt level (through repayment of the OIASA and other debt held with NBT) and in so \ndoing will remove some of the financial constraint under which NBT is operating. Finally, the \nsecond tranche will require the Government (MFEP) to prepare a detailed report on the private \nsector\u2019s growth potential inclusive of market capacity and sustainability. Together, these actions \nwill create an environment supportive of further and more specific reform actions. \n \n79.  Harmonization.  The  principles  of  harmonization  and  coordination  with  other \ndevelopment partners\u2019 activities will underlie the success of the Program. The Program will \nsupport the Government in its achievement of the PBIs, which were developed in concert with \nADB, AusAID, and NZAID. Tuvalu\u2019s receipt of financial support from AusAID and NZAID for the \nrecurrent budget through incentive payments, over the usual country allocation, for achievement \nof the PBIs will be facilitated by ADB\u2019s program grant.  \n \n80.  Capacity Development. Capacity development is a further principle that will underlie the \nsuccess of the Program. Capacity development will be supported by the standalone TA detailed \nin Appendix 5 and is essential to the Program at both the individual and organizational levels to \nensure  continuous  skill  development,  competence,  and  confidence  of  MFEP,  the  public \nenterprise  reform  steering  committee,  the  public  enterprises  unit,  boards,  and  general \nmanagers. Capacity building through the development of high-level policy and legislation and its \nimplementation will require attention to the capacity of the institutional and political environment, \nwhich will be supported by the approved TA, in particular through the inclusion of a local \nfacilitator in the consultant team, who will bring an understanding of issues of political economy \nto specific activities under the TA. The TA will provide for capacity development of individuals \nthrough formal and informal training and mentoring, with emphasis on on-the-job development \nand learning by doing, with a team approach taken to all activities and issues. Consultative and \nparticipatory public and stakeholder activities will also be undertaken in regard to the proposed \nreforms and specific public enterprise performance issues, which will contribute to broader \ncapacity  development  promoted  through  the  program  grant  by  allowing  the  effective \nengagement of these groups in the reform process.  \n \nC.  Financing Plan \n \n81.  Asian Development Fund IX Grant. A policy paper on Revising the Framework for Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grants was approved by the ADB Board on 26 September 2007. According \n ", "  21\nto the policy paper, Tuvalu is classified as country with high risk of debt distress and is therefore \neligible to receive 100% grant assistance. \n \n82.  ADB will support the Program through a grant of $3.24 million provided from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources to support the Government\u2019s implementation of the policy, institutional, \nand legal reforms for strengthened financial management. The framework put in place will \nsupport  the  government  in  sound  decision  making  regarding  public  corporations  and \ngovernment business enterprises. The resultant decisions can be expected to have social and \npolitical  impacts.  The  policy  framework  guiding  these  decisions  will  support  Government's \nanalysis of the impacts of its decisions and provide tools to ameliorate negative social impacts, \nas well as setting out processes for broad-based consultation to generate the required political \nsupport  for  change.  The  counterpart  funds  generated  from  the  grant  will  allow  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s full repayment of the OIASA overdraft to NBT. The total amount of the overdraft \nis  estimated  at  A$3,795,610.  Any  remaining  counterpart  funds  will  be  directed  by  the \nGovernment toward other outstanding debt to NBT. The overdraft repayment will support the \nintended  outcome  of  the  Program  set  out  in  the  policy  matrix  through  improving  the \nGovernment\u2019s debt position while simultaneously improving the performance indicators for NBT. \nThere are significant potential savings to the Government from improved public enterprise \nperformance. Annual on-budget expenditure by the Government in support of public enterprises \nhas been estimated to exceed A$6 million (with further off-budget expenditure), compared with \ntotal annual government on-budget expenditure, which has ranged between A$16.2 million and \nA$32.9 million during the past decade. The size of the grant is based on the importance of the \nreforms, the state of public finances, and the level of government debt. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n83.  Program Management. MFEP will be the Executing Agency and will coordinate policy, \nlegal, and regulatory actions. MFEP will also ensure that the policy reforms, as agreed to by \nADB and the Government and as described in the development policy letter and set forth in the \npolicy matrix (Appendix 6), are duly carried out in a timely manner. In particular, MFEP will \nensure that provisions for reporting, monitoring, auditing, and other administrative requirements \nwill be strictly followed. A program steering committee, chaired by the secretary of MFEP and \nincluding representatives of the Office of the Attorney General and MFEP\u2019s budget and public \nenterprise oversight areas, will be established to monitor and coordinate the Program and \nsupporting TA from ADB and others.  \n \n84.  Implementation Period. The Program period is from 1 November 2008 to 31 March \n2010.  Policy,  legislative,  organizational,  and  operational  changes  agreed  upon  with  the \nGovernment and set out in the policy matrix are to be put in place from 1 November 2008 to 30 \nNovember 2009.  \n \n85.  Procurement and Disbursement. The proceeds of the grant will be disbursed to Tuvalu \nas the recipient in accordance with ADB\u2019s simplified disbursement procedures and related \nrequirements for programs loans.19 The proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange \ncost of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding items included in a \nlist of ineligible items (Appendix 7) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral \nsources.  Grant  proceeds  disbursed  against  imports  will  require  a  certificate  from  the \nGovernment stipulating that the value of the total imports of Tuvalu, minus its imports from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance, is equal to or greater than the amount of the grant expected to be disbursed during \n                                                 \n19  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila.  \n ", "22  \na particular year. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the grant proceeds, and to verify the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n86.  Tranches. The grant will be provided in two tranches. The first tranche of $1.24 million \nwill  be  available  upon  satisfaction  of  the  first  tranche  conditions  and  grant  effectiveness, \nestimated at around November 2008. The second tranche of $2 million will be available upon \nsatisfaction of the second tranche conditions, estimated at around October 2009. In addition, the \nGovernment must complete the nontranche release policy actions set out in the policy matrix \nduring the implementation period. While these policy actions are not conditions for the release \nof the first or second tranches, they are essential steps for achieving the program outcome.  \n \n87.  Counterpart  Funds.  Local  currency  generated  from  the  grant  will  be  directed  to \nrepayment  of  the  Government\u2019s  overdraft  in  the  OIASA  with  NBT.  The  overdraft  totals \nA$3,795,610, and the local currency generated from the grant will eliminate this overdraft. In \nparticular, $1.24 million equivalent from the first tranche and $2 million equivalent from the \nsecond tranche will be applied for the complete repayment of the A$3.796 million OIASA \noverdraft. Any remaining counterpart funds will be directed by the Government toward other \noutstanding debt to NBT. \n \n88.  Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. MFEP will (i) within 3 months from \ngrant effectiveness, establish and maintain a performance evaluation system for the Program, \nwhich will include the policy actions from the policy matrix; and (ii) monitor and report to ADB, \non  a  semiannual  basis,  the  implementation  of  policy  actions  and  their  impact  on  budget \noutcomes and public enterprise performance (including financial and performance indictors), in \nline with the program impact and outcome indicators agreed upon with the Government. As the \noutcomes  and  impacts  of  the  Program  will  be  most  clearly  felt  beyond  the  period  of  its \nimplementation, the monitoring of these will continue to be undertaken by MFEP. Monitoring of \noutcomes and impacts will be useful to the Government\u2019s own processes and decision making \nand as such is not an onerous requirement. A review of the progress of the Program will be \nundertaken jointly by ADB and PFTAC in consultation with the Government before the end of \nthe third quarter of 2009 to ensure that the second tranche conditions (and other policy actions), \nas specified in the development policy letter and the program matrix (Appendix 6), are met.   \n \n89.  Program  Review.  Apart  from  the  joint  review  with  PFTAC  mentioned  in  para.  88, \nprogram reviews will be carried out in conjunction with associated TA reviews. \n \n90.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  Government  and  the  Executing  Agency.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the Program will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Program. \n \n91.  Technical  Assistance.  On  3  November  2008,  ADB  approved  TA  for  capacity \ndevelopment for public financial management to the Government of Tuvalu (Appendix 5).20 The \n                                                 \n20  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to Tuvalu for Capacity Development for Public Financial Management. Manila. \nThe TA, while related to the Program, was processed separately to allow the diagnostic analysis of MFEP capacity \nto be undertaken promptly to provide ADB and other development partners with a better understanding of where \ncapacity gaps are and how to better manage for these. \n ", "  23\nTA will enhance fiscal stability through (i) providing for a broad diagnostic analysis of MFEP\u2019s \ncapacity, (ii) supporting government preparation of an MTFF, and (iii) creating the policy and \nlegislative environment for improving the performance of public enterprises. The TA will be \nimplemented over a 3-year period to enable the progress achieved under the Program to be \nbuilt upon through continued support to the implementation of government decisions regarding \nreform of specific public corporations. The TA will not provide for the assessment of program \npolicy actions.  \n \n92.  The MTFF and the capacity assessment of MFEP will both provide important support to \nprogram  activities.  The  MTFF  will  assist  in  strengthening  planning  and  reallocation  of \ngovernment resources against priorities, thereby acting to reinforce program actions regarding \nappropriate assessment of subsidies and costs of community service obligations. The MTFF will \nalso provide an anchor for the debt risk management and mitigation policy and strategy. The \nfindings  of  the  MFEP  capacity  assessment  will  allow  for  identification  of  priority  areas  for \nstrengthening and will provide a mechanism to attract additional development partners\u2019 support \nfor capacity building. Clearly, a stronger MFEP will be of benefit to program implementation.  \n \n93.  Other Assistance. PFTAC will provide support as required for the development and \nimplementation of the financial institutions act through its banking supervision advisor or through \nperipatetic  advisors.  PFTAC  did,  in  2002,  provide  model  legislation  to  Tuvalu  that  had \nundergone  some  development  in-country  but  was  not  completed.  PFTAC  will  seek  to \nreinvigorate this process with the intention of enabling the Government to meet second tranche \nconditions.  \n \n94.  A range of other development partner assistance is also relevant to the sustainability of \nthe program grant outcome and impact. The current and planned assistance from Australia and \nNew Zealand directed toward strengthened financial management creates a sound continuing \nenvironment for program grant implementation. For example, AusAID has funded a budget \nadviser in Tuvalu since 2005, with this position providing support for the development and \nimplementation of an MTFF. AusAID is also funding an advisor to the auditor general, with \nimproved functioning of this office supporting the oversight of public enterprises. ADB\u2019s own \nfuture program of assistance, set out in the Tuvalu CPS 2008\u20132012, provides for a second \nphase of TA to support capacity development for financial management, which is indicative of \nADB\u2019s ongoing commitment to this sector (footnote 2). Thus this TA is situated within a larger \nand ongoing program of development partner support for strengthened financial management. \nAppendix 8 contains a matrix of current and planned external assistance to Tuvalu.  \n \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n95.  The  major  benefits  of  the  Program  will  be  long-term  fiscal  stability  and  improved \nenterprise  performance.  These  benefits  will  act  to  reinforce  the  political  will  to  implement \nchange.  \n \n96.  Fiscal. A reduction in the demand on the budget by public enterprises will create fiscal \nspace and allow for allocation of expenditures to priority areas, thus improving Tuvalu\u2019s fiscal \nperformance. A 2005 estimate suggested that 13% of on-budget expenditure (about $6 million \nin 2005) was directed to supporting the shortfall in operating revenues of public enterprises. \nThere are also clear indications that a significant level of off-budget expenditure is also directed \nto supporting public enterprises.  \n \n ", "24  \n97.  The longer-term impact of the actions supported by the Program will be to reduce the \nGovernment\u2019s responsibility for such support to that of providing for contracted community \nservice obligations. Thus the longer-term fiscal implications of the Program could be savings in \nthe order of 7%\u20138% of on-budget expenditure. The support this level of funds could provide to \nmeeting the fiscal PBIs would facilitate Tuvalu\u2019s access to incentive payments from both AusAID \nand NZAID and so further leverage the benefits of the Program.  \n \n98.  Greater transparency in transfers to public enterprises and the provision of these in \nexchange for services will contribute to greater budget clarity. This will also be served by \nstrengthened financial understanding on the part of both public enterprise employees and board \nmembers.  \n \n99.  Utilization of the fiscal space created by the grant to repay the OIASA overdraft will have \nbenefits both for the Government, in terms of a reduced debt level and improved financial \nposition, and also for NBT, placing NBT in an improved financial position, freeing capital for \nlending and/or investment, thus enabling greater private sector access to funds. Fiscal stability, \nas well as improved NBT liquidity, is likely to engender increased business confidence and the \ninterest  of  the  private  sector  in  new  and  existing  business  development,  and  therefore  to \ncontribute to improvements in social impact including better access to education and health \nservices through reduced household financial pressure.  \n \n100.  Strengthened  Government  Decision  Making.  With  the  adoption  of  the  public \nenterprise governance reform strategic policy, the Government will be well placed to consider \nand  assess  alternate  ownership  and  management  options  for  its  public  corporations  and \ngovernment businesses.  \n \n101.  Government  Oversight  of  Public  Corporations.  Ministries  with  responsibilities  to \npublic enterprises will need to develop a new working relationship with the public enterprises, \nmoving away from a master\u2013servant interaction to a client\u2013provider relationship. Ministries will \ninitially need to work closely with public enterprises to identify community service obligations, \nset these at appropriate levels, and cost them. Ministries will benefit from such a process in that \nthe required supplements to public enterprise budgets will be transparent and related to the \nquality and quantity of services received.  \n \n102.  The  establishment  of  a  public  enterprise  unit  will  consolidate  efforts  to  improve \ngovernment revenue through establishing profitable enterprises by establishing the unit as the \nvehicle for encouraging performance, providing skill development to enterprise managers and \nboards, and monitoring performance against agreed upon indicators. \n \n103.  Improved public enterprise efficiency and performance, including returning a profit, will \nconsolidate the value of fiscal discipline and performance measures. Improved service delivery \n(the way in which services are delivered as well as what is delivered) will both enhance political \ncommitment  and  consolidate  the  public  perception  of  political  commitment  to  better  fiscal \nmanagement as well as effect enterprises. \n \n104.  Public  Enterprise  Management.  The  impact  of  the  Program  will  be  felt  most \nimmediately  by  general  managers  and  staff  of  the  public  enterprises.  Efficiency  and \nperformance will be elevated in importance, and mechanisms will be put in place to monitor \nindicators of these. Current reliance on family and communal connections to overlook poor work \neffort  will  be  reduced  through  the  development  of  job  descriptions  and  clear  performance \ntargets. New and enforced requirements for financial and performance reporting will enforce \nfiscal transparency and promote fiscal discipline within public enterprises.  \n ", "  25\n105.  Within public enterprises, capacities will be developed to support performance-focused \nmanagement and strengthened financial management. This is one of the benefits of undertaking \na holistic approach to the improvement of public enterprise performance outside of a situation of \nfiscal crisis, when the urgency of change would be paramount and capacity development a \nlesser priority.  \n \nB.  Risks \n \n106.  Risks relate mainly to continued political will to establish and carry out a robust policy \nframework  for  improvement  of  enterprise  performance,  availability  and  sustainability  of \nappropriate technical capacity, appropriateness of institutional requirements and government \ncommitment to establish a public enterprise unit, and commitment to capacity development \nsuccess and sustainability. Because external economic factors may affect the willingness of the \npublic and the private sector to take on risk\u2014and therefore may affect lending and business \ndevelopment\u2014they must be included in risk assessment and in management strategies. \n \n107.  Economic. World economic volatility leaves import-reliant Tuvalu vulnerable to price \nescalation. National, Pacific regional, and international economic indicators will need to be \nmonitored as an aid to fiscal management. The recent increase in import prices, such as has \nbeen the case for fuel and food, has left a significant impact on both customers and the \nGovernment. While the global commodity prices, particularly fuel are declining, the impacts of \nthe increases are experienced by Tuvalu with a significant lag as the prices flow through the \nsupply contracts through Fiji Islands, from where supply channels finally transfer the prices to \nTuvalu. This translates to built budgetary pressures that will continue to reduce Tuvalu\u2019s fiscal \nspace in 2009.   \n \n108.  Political Will. The current Government has indicted commitment to the five fiscal PBIs. \nThe  commitment  to  working  toward  achievement  of  the  PBIs  is  fundamental  to  program \nsuccess. A change in the Government or its leadership may weaken this commitment. The \nimpacts of the Program will take time to manifest themselves, but the costs will occur earlier. \nThe Government must be confident and present publicly the benefits of the fiscal reforms on \nmacroeconomic stability and how this will benefit all. Mitigation efforts will be supported by the \nTA, which provides for a local project facilitator who will have the role of developing public and \nstakeholder awareness and understanding of the objectives of the reforms being implemented. \nThis is expected to promote broad-based support for the reforms and will be complemented by \nsimilar educational activities for members of Parliament and public enterprise staff. Mitigation \nmeasures for those who may be negatively affected by the Government\u2019s subsequent actions in \nrelation to public corporation ownership, management, and operations will need to be developed \nby the Government. \n \n109.  The Program will likely increase the workload of board members, as they will have \nimproved information to consider at their meetings and increased skills to apply to their task as \ndirectors. The board will also be expected to play a role in setting the strategic direction of the \npublic enterprise during corporate planning activities. There is a risk that board members will not \nrise  to  this  challenge,  although  this  will  be  mitigated  through  capacity  development  and \nimproved board selection criteria and processes.  \n \n110.  Capacity  Development.  Embarking  on  fiscal  and  enterprise  improvement  of  this \nmagnitude requires both skills and an understanding of the ongoing and iterative nature of the \nprocess. It signifies a commitment to ongoing fiscal improvement. Public servants will require \nongoing capacity development to enable them to have the competence and confidence to \nparticipate fully and take ownership of this process. The low skill base constitutes a significant \n ", "26  \nrisk. This risk will be mitigated through the TA, which ties TA input closely to tranche conditions. \nThe TA will also provide for a local facilitator to assist the technical specialists in increasing \nunderstanding of the issues the program grant and TA are designed to address; and to support \nconsultation, participation, and awareness-raising directed at members of Parliament, relevant \ngovernment and public enterprise staff, as well as the public. This position will further enhance \nthe incorporation of an understanding of issues of political economy in specific activity design.  \n \n111.  Capacity development is both an underlying risk management factor and a risk. Capacity \ndevelopment of a cadre of staff with the critical mass to manage the process of fiscal reform \nthrough to measurable impacts is essential. However, Tuvalu, like the rest of the Pacific, is \nvulnerable to the loss of human resources to the enticement of greater financial rewards and \ncareer opportunities available only in a larger economy. \n \n112.  Government Oversight of Public Corporations. Ministries and government agencies \nwill be placed under greater pressure to meet their obligations to public enterprises for service \nprovision.  The  Government  has  a  poor  track  record  in  paying  its  electricity  and \ntelecommunications bills, although this seems to have been largely addressed recently. It will \nneed to continue to make adequate provision to pay its bills, as in a more performance-focused \noperating environment, TEC and TTC will need to treat the Government in a similar manner to \nall their other customers when it comes to delinquency. Support provided to the Government \nthrough the TA, and by other development partners, to improve annual budget development and \nmanagement will act to further mitigate this concern.  \n \n113.  Social Impact. The public and private sector may also feel the impacts of the Program \nin terms of changes in quality and costs of services. Given the degree of subsidization of \nservices to the consumer, both directly (through artificially low tariffs) and indirectly (through \ngeneral  subsidies  to  public  enterprise  budgets),  there  will  likely  have  to  be  some  upward \nadjustment of prices of services by some public enterprises. It is also expected that an improved \nquality of service will be provided. Again, planning of these adjustments can allow them to be \nstepped over time and also allow for development of programs of assistance to target the \nneediest in society to ensure that their basic service needs are met.  \n \n114.  Rationalization seems a likely path for at least one public enterprise, and such a decision \nmay have social impacts should the Government chose to cut jobs rather than to reposition \nstaff, with reductions being made through natural attrition. Again, making this decision in a less \npressured environment that allows time for analysis and consideration of options means that \nsteps can be taken, in terms of retraining or compensation, to avert the worst social impacts and \nto  avoid  imposing  hardship  on  those  families  directly  involved.  Appendix  9  contains  the \nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy.   \n \n115.  Overall. Achievement of the potential benefits to the Government in terms of fiscal \nstability, and improvements in enterprise performance and in business and public confidence \nthrough supporting the Program far outweigh the risks. Indeed, the cost of no action would be \nborne by the Government through ballooning subsidies to public corporations, and by the \npeople of Tuvalu through declining public services. The overall benefits of the program grant \nconsiderably outweigh the costs and the risks. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  27\nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Special Assurances \n \n116.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will (a) ensure that the policies adopted and actions taken as \ndescribed in the development policy letter, including the policy matrix, continue in \neffect for the duration of the program period and subsequently; and (b) promptly \nadopt all other policies and take all other actions indicated in the development \npolicy letter, including the policy matrix, and ensure that such policies and actions \ncontinue in effect for the duration of the program period and subsequently. \n \n(ii)  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral or bilateral aid agencies that have implications for implementation of \nthe  Program,  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  progress  made  in  carrying  out  the \npolicies and actions set out in the development policy letter and the policy matrix, \nand  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy \nproposals. The Government will continue timely policy dialogue with ADB on \nproblems and constraints encountered during implementation of the Program and \non desirable changes to overcome or mitigate such problems and constraints. \n \n(iii)  Throughout the implementation of the Program, the Government will ensure that \nadequate resources are allocated and released in a timely manner in order to \nensure proper implementation of the Program as described in the development \npolicy letter.  The Government will ensure that the counterpart funds generated \nout of the grant proceeds are directed, first, to the repayment of its overdraft in \nthe OIASA with NBT, and, second, toward the repayment of any outstanding debt \nof the Government to NBT.  \n \n(iv)  The Government will undertake necessary measures to create and sustain a \ncorruption-free environment; ensure that its anticorruption law and regulations \nand ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) are strictly enforced \nand  complied  with  during  the  program  implementation;  and  facilitate  ADB\u2019s \nexercising  its  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. \n \n(v)  The  Government  will  establish,  by  31  January  2009,  a  program  steering \ncommittee chaired by the Secretary of MFEP and comprised of representatives \nof the Office of the Attorney General and MFEP\u2019s budget and public enterprise \noversight areas to monitor and coordinate the Program and supporting technical \nassistance from ADB and other agencies. \n \nB.  Condition to Grant Effectiveness \n \n117.  The Government will have fulfilled all conditions for the release of the first tranche. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "28  \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n118.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the grant not exceeding $3,240,000 to Tuvalu from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for \nthe Improved Financial Management Program, on terms and conditions that are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nC.

The National Bank of Tuvalu (NBT) commenced operations as a government bank, went \nthrough a period in which ownership was shared with a succession of foreign commercial \nbanks, and since 1995 has again been wholly owned by the Government. There is interest in \nprivatization on the part of the Government with some talks with a foreign bank regarding \ncomplete divestiture having taken place intermittently between 2004 and 2006. However, this \ndid not eventuate. There has also been a suggestion of the issuance of shares to the public, \nthough again this would be dependent on reduced government involvement.   \n \n2.  At least two issues proved problematic in moving to private ownership. These included \nconcerns regarding NBT\u2019s level of liquidity and the lack of appropriate banking regulations. The \nGovernment initiated the development of a financial supervisory act; however, this was not \ncompleted.1 Regardless of whether NBT is privatized, dealing with its monopoly position as the \ndominant commercial bank in Tuvalu is also important. The high historical rates of return on \ninvestment suggest this market power has already been exploited. \n \n3.  NBT\u2019s biggest customer is the Government, which has accumulated a large overdraft \nstemming from budget support coupled with a considerable debt (A$3.796 million at 30 June \n2008) from its involvement in the outer islands agency suspense account (OIASA), where \npersonal deposits made by people in the outer islands were remitted back into the consolidated \nrevenues instead of back to NBT in a period when the Government was acting as an agent for \nNBT in the outer islands.  \n \n4.  This, combined with a spate of poor quality lending to local businesses and households, \ncontributed to a liquidity crisis. The financial statements contained in the 2003 annual report \nstates: \u201cAs at 31 December 2003, the Bank\u2019s liquidity position had been severely depleted \nresulting in material uncertainty as to whether the Bank will be able to meet its obligations to \ndepositors  and  discharge  its  short-term  liabilities  in  the  normal  course  of  business.\u201d2  The \nfinancial statements showed the alarming growth in lending and drop in deposits, offset by a \n90% reduction of term deposits with overseas banks during 2003. This trend continued until a \nchange of management recognized the problem and took steps to address it. Outstanding \nloans, at 93% of deposits as of October 2005, subsequently reached well in excess of 100%. As \na result NBT entered into very little new lending. \n \n5.  For a long time NBT was the only institution in Tuvalu that accepted deposits (the \nDevelopment Bank of Tuvalu [DBT] is now able to do so), offering a normal array of savings and \nchecking accounts, currency exchange, money transfers, and loans. For years, it was the only \nbusiness in the country that accepted credit cards (for cash advances), but in 2005 it stopped \nproviding this service. This has caused concern in the tourist industry and allied businesses \ncatering to international travelers.  \n \n6.  The NBT loan portfolio is dominated by personal borrowing, with only about 30% lent for \nbusiness purposes. Only a few well-established, long-time customers are still receiving new \nbusiness  credit;  all  others  are  referred  to  DBT.  Housing  loans\u2014previously  an  important \ncomponent of the business portfolio since most were for rental units\u2014have stopped completely. \n                                                 \n1  The reasons behind the draft FIA as prepared with PFTAC assistance never moving to the stage of parliamentary \ntabling are unknown. All the key players (minister and secretary of finance, attorney general, and NBT general \nmanager) have changed in the intervening period.  \n2  National Bank of Tuvalu. 2004.

Funafuti. \n ", "  Appendix 2  33\nSecurity to date has been limited to automatic payroll deductions from individuals employed by \nthe Government or liens on individual accounts in Tuvalu National Provident Fund.  \n \n7.  Given the NBT\u2019s status as Tuvalu\u2019s only profitable public corporation and the previous \nexpression of private sector interest in involvement in NBT, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ninvited Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre\u2019s (PFTAC) financial sector supervision \nadvisor to join the fact-finding mission to Tuvalu to provide advice to ADB regarding appropriate \ntranche release conditions to support the financial sector, and improve NBT performance in \nparticular. This was done through a review of the general operating condition and performance \nof the NBT and the adequacy of operating policies to determine what factors, if any, may be \nhindering the performance of NBT or which may otherwise deter private sector investor interest \nin  NBT.  The  summary  report  is  presented  in  Box  A2,  with  a  detailed  report having  been \nprovided to both NBT and the Government (as owner).  \n \nBox A2: Summary Report by Financial Sector Supervision Advisor, PFTAC \non the National Bank of Tuvalu \n \nOverall, the condition and performance of NBT appears to be generally satisfactory based on a \nreview of the 2006 audited financial statements and unaudited financial statements for the year \nending 31 December 2007 and for the 6 months to 30 June 2008. Capital is strong, despite the \nlack of accruals for income taxes on the profits for the year December 2007 and for the \n6 months  ending  30  June  2008  and  the  need  to  increase  provisions  for  bad  debts.  After \nadjusting for these items, the bank\u2019s leverage capital ratios (total capital to total assets) are \nestimated at 19.38% as of 31 December 2007 and 20.42% as of 30 June 2008. This high capital \nposition is, however, needed to support the bank\u2019s expanding and high-risk loan portfolio.  \n \nAsset quality is less than satisfactory with a high proportion of loans identified by the bank as \nbeing  nonperforming  (NPL).  The  bank\u2019s  identification  of  NPLs,  however,  is  believed  to be \nunderstated. The bank defines a NPL as any loan past due 180 days or more while the more \ngenerally accepted practice is to recognize loans past due 90 days or more as NPL. The bank\u2019s \nmore liberal definition of NPL also raises questions as the quality of reported earnings and \nincome.  Management was unable to provide a complete aging of past loans due as of 30 June \n2008 to assess the volume and severity of NPLs. Weaknesses have also been identified in the \nbank\u2019s lending and loan grading policies. Earnings performance, as noted above, appears to be \noverstated but is generally satisfactory. Improvement, however, is needed in the budgeting \nprocess. Earnings performance is, however, being hindered by several large interest-free loans \nto government (i.e., the OIASA and long-standing NPLs to Tuvalu Media Corporation and the \nNational Fishing Corporation). Liquidity is satisfactory; however, improvement is needed in \nplanning and management of liquid assets.  \n \nOperations of the bank are generally satisfactory and no major impediments, beyond resolution \nof the large volume of nonearning government borrowings and the need for a banking law, have \nbeen identified, which would discourage outside investor interest in the bank. Lending is guided \nby a written lending policy, a policy for categorizing loans by risk has been adopted and \nmanagement prepares an annual earnings budget. Revisions to these policies are needed to \ncomply with international best practices and the adoption of a written liquidity policy is needed to \nbetter  manage  and  assure  the  maintenance  of  adequate  liquidity.  Resolution  of  the  large \nvolume of nonearning government borrowings totaling about A$5 million as of 30 June 2008 \nwould likely be required if outside investors were to be attracted to the bank.  \n \nNBT = National Bank of Tuvalu, NPL = nonperforming loan, OIASA = outer Islands agency suspense account. \nSource: PFTAC. 2008.

Government expenditure is very high in Tuvalu; the ratio of expenditure and net lending \nto gross domestic product (GDP) ranged from 150% to 220% in 1999\u20132003 and is likely to have \nremained close to 100% subsequently. Hence, government expenditure is the main driver of \neconomic activity, and the fiscal position is a critical dimension of economic management.  \n \n2.  During 2000\u20132002, there was a surge in external revenue from fishing licenses and the \ninternational marketing of the .tv domain name. Grants and revenue from offshore investments \nheld in the Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) were also relatively high during the period. Revenue from \nthese sources then declined in 2003\u20132005, averaging A$9 million per annum compared with the \nannual  average  of  A$35  million  during  2000\u20132002.  These  earnings  have  not  increased \nsignificantly since then, and forward projections indicate declining offshore earnings through \n2010. \n \n3.  Expenditure grew quickly as offshore revenue rose (Figure A3). Much of the additional \nexpenditure was allocated to one-off items such as the sealing of the road network on Funafuti \n(2002), an outer islands electrification project (2000), and grants to the Falekaupule Trust Fund \nestablished to assist outer islands development. Some of the expanding expenditure items were \nrecurrent in nature or incurred some level of recurrent costs, and proved difficult to reduce as \nthe revenue position weakened. This resulted in considerable fiscal pressure. The value of the \nbudget was equivalent to 30% of GDP in 2003, 10% in 2004, and 20% in 2005.  \n \nFigure A3:  Expenditure and Revenue Balance \nA$ million\n60 Estimates\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\n-10 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n-20\nExpenditure and net lending Budget balance\n \nSource: Tuvalu Central Statistics Department, Government audited accounts and budget papers, various years. \n \n4.  The large deficits quickly drew down the Government\u2019s liquid financial reserves. In net \nterms, liquid financial resources stood at 59% of GDP at the end of 2002, but they were \nexhausted by the end of 2005. The downturn in revenue resulted in very tight expenditure \nrestraints and the compression of capital expenditures, particularly on maintenance and on \ngoods and services. Financial relief was provided over 2006 by strengthening in the Australian \ncapital market. This allowed a A$12 million distribution from the Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) in \n2006 and a further distribution of A$7 million in 2007, replenishing the Government\u2019s cash \n ", "  Appendix 3    35\nreserves  held  in  the  Consolidated  Investment  Fund  (CIF).1  The  budget  surplus  was \napproximately 32% of GDP in 2006; however, a deficit of A$1.04 million was recorded for 2007. \nTuvalu is projecting budget deficits for 2008 through 2011 (but the reliability of such projections \nis unclear, given the volatility in key revenue items). \n \n5.  The Government is taking steps to address the fiscal situation, and is committed to a \nprogram of fiscal restraint. This is most clearly demonstrated by its adoption of a set of five \nperformance benchmark indicators (PBIs), which was formulated by the Government, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank, the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), and the \nNew Zealand Agency for International Development (NZAID) to track achievement of the stated \nsocial  sector  outcomes  through  a  focus  on  improved  financial  management  and  fiscal \nconsolidation. The PBIs are as follows: \n(i)  Benchmark 1.1. The Government\u2019s recurrent expenditure each year should not \nexceed the total of its recurrent revenue plus a sustainable TTF distribution (CIF \ndrawdown).  \n(ii)  Benchmark 1.2. The target minimum value of funds retained in the CIF should \nbe not less than 16% of the maintained value of the TTF at the beginning of the \nTTF year so as to ensure that a sustainable distribution is available to help \nfinance annual budgets.  \n(iii)  Benchmark  1.3.  The  Government\u2019s  total  debt  liability  (both  domestic  and \nexternal) at any time should not exceed 60% of GDP, as specified in Te Kakeega \nII. \n(iv)  Benchmark 2.1. In 2008, the Government will increase its budgeted nonsalary \nexpenditure on basic education by at least 5%. \n(v)  Benchmark 2.2. In 2008, the Government will increase its budgeted nonsalary \nexpenditure on primary and preventive health services by at least 5%. \n \n6.  Fiscal performance against the PBIs is being monitored by the Government, by the \nTuvalu  Trust  Fund  Advisory  Committee  (TTFAC),  and  by  international  aid  agencies. \nAssessment  in  April  2008  by  TTFAC  against  the  2007  budget  outturn  found  that  the \nGovernment  had  met  only  benchmarks  1.3,  2.1,  and  2.2,  although  TTFAC  noted  against \nbenchmark 1.2 that there was a marked improvement in the Government\u2019s efforts to achieve the \ntarget minimum balance. The performance against the PBIs is looked to by AusAID and NZAID \nas a basis to assess the Government\u2019s eligibility for incentive payments to support the recurrent \nbudget. \n \nB.  Revenue Collection Systems \n \n7.  The key challenge facing the revenue system is the high degree of volatility in external \nrevenue. For 2000\u20132005, annual external revenue ranged from A$13 million to A$47 million. In \naddition to being volatile, the future year\u2019s revenue is difficult to forecast, and payment of one of \nthe single largest revenue items (viz., fishing licenses) is received very late in the financial year. \nExpenditure decisions are thus made in the face of considerable uncertainty as to how they will \nbe funded. The length and depth of periods of low revenue are difficult to forecast, as they \ndepend on a range of factors outside Tuvalu\u2019s control. Also, considerable uncertainty prevails \n                                                 \n1 The Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) provides budget support from its distribution over and above its maintained value, but \nfluctuates with the performance in the financial markets in Australia. The existence of the TTF has created a \nfinancial asset for current and future generations, provided funding for the budget (at around 10% of recurrent \nexpenditure in 2007), and strengthened external perceptions of Tuvalu\u2019s finances and governance structure. \nHowever, it also has created some complacency in the Government budget planning and a certain level of moral \nhazard, particularly in years of good financial performance.  \n ", "36   Appendix 3 \nwith respect to the volatility in the value of the US dollar, as fishing licenses and income from \nthe  domain  name  are  both  paid  in  that  currency.  These  factors  greatly  complicate  fiscal \nmanagement and have contributed to the emergence of fiscal difficulties. \n \n8.  The most immediate issue facing the internal revenue system is the potential loss of \nrevenue under the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement, which became effective in May \n2008 following ratification in April 2008. Implementation of this by Tuvalu requires that duties on \nimports from other Pacific Island countries will be progressively reduced over a 10-year period. \nThe current import duty system comprises a large range of ad valorem and specific rates \napplied to free-on-board values, with the weighted average import duty estimated at 15% in \n2005. The main concern to Tuvalu is the potential loss of revenue on imports from Fiji, which \naccounted for 14% of import duty or A$0.36 million in 2005. As import duties will only be \nreduced progressively, the loss of revenue will tend to be small initially. Relatively simple \nrevenue measures have been identified that could readily correct for the revenue loss in the \nforeseeable future. \n \n9.  Nonetheless, more extensive import duty reforms are warranted. The intent is to reduce \nthe  reliance  on  import  duties  through  adoption  of  a  broad-based  consumption  tax,  with \nlegislation to be approved in November 2008. There are also grounds for raising charges for \nelectricity, telecommunications, and shipping. Cost recovery initiatives could also be justified for \nmedical and education services, notably for overseas scholarships (with support provided for \nthe disadvantaged), to better spread the benefits of these services through the community. \n \n10.  Revisions  to  the  charges  of  government  businesses  would  be  most  helpful  if \naccompanied by reforms in the management regime, such as the establishment of service \noperating  agreements  for  public  enterprises  and  revisions  to  their  board  structures.  While \nelements of such reforms have been considered, there has been no progress in implementation. \nThere has been a substantial investment in infrastructure recently, but the potential gains are \nimpaired by operating inefficiencies, including shortfalls in funding operating costs and the \nhigher maintenance now required.  \n \nC.  Public Expenditure Program \n \n11.  High staff costs are a key source of fiscal pressure for the medium term. They now \naccount for 40% of on-budget expenditure, well up from the 24% share of 1996. In 1994, the \npublic sector reform program became a core component of the national plan, and a civil service \ndownsizing was proposed. But by 2005, the number of established posts had grown by 37% \nabove the 1994 level, although the population had grown by less than 10%. Average rates of \npay also increased substantially during the period. A recent wage restraint has been lifted with a \nwage rise for public employees included in the FY2009 budget considered by Parliament in \nNovember 2008. Staff costs have risen to such high levels that they are now an ongoing source \nof fiscal pressure and compression of nonstaff expenditure.  \n \n12.  The national development plan, Te Kakeega II, identifies the expenditure priorities as \nbasic education and health care and vocational education. These items receive a very low share \nof the budget and are largely supported through external inputs. Shifting funds to these priorities \nrequires making savings by stopping or cutting back some activities. Candidates for savings \ninclude  overseas  scholarships  (at  7.2%  of  2004  on-budget  expenditure),  travel  expenses \n(2.7%), and subsidies to government businesses. Public expenditure could also be improved \nthrough the adoption of a targeted approach to meeting the needs of the disadvantaged rather \nthan the current broad-brush approach. \n ", "  Appendix 3    37\nD.  Public Financial Management System and Budgeting \n13.  Despite improvements in the quality of financial management, the fiscal position remains \ndifficult to track. Changes in the net cash position (which equals the fiscal balance) are not \nreported publicly and are obscured by the Government\u2019s use of multiple sources of cash. \nGaining a clear interpretation of the Government\u2019s fiscal management is complicated by the \npresence of a range of estimates of expenditure and revenue and the budget balance. The \nbudget papers themselves present more than one estimate of some of the key aggregates (e.g., \nrecurrent expenditure, the wage and salary bill), and historical data presented in the budget \npapers differ significantly from that presented in the audited accounts. This situation appears to \nbe a reflection of the use of multiple accounting systems to prepare the budget as well as a \ngeneral  weakness  in  the  accounting  systems.  A  recent  review  further  identified  significant \nweaknesses  in  public  financial  management  including  the  lack  of  a  medium-term  fiscal \nframework (MTFF).2 Issues identified in this review have been built into the technical assistance \n(TA) components. \n \n14.  Public sector record keeping has generally been in a poor state. Information on the debt \nposition of the public sector and the value of investment and performance of the offshore assets \nare generally not disclosed to the public. The extent of government guarantees is difficult to \ndetermine, even though the policy is for such guarantees to receive parliamentary approval. The \nrecent rundown (now corrected) in the Government\u2019s net cash holdings is still poorly understood \nwithin and outside the Government despite its seriousness.  \n \n15.  Accountability and transparency are impaired by the limited information available on \ngovernment operations and mechanisms for civil society to engage in government decision \nmaking. The main source of information on the Government\u2019s operations is the budget papers. \nThese papers identify the activities of the main sections within each ministry, performance \nindicators, and expenditure by item and revenue. However, there are inconsistencies within the \nbudget papers, and performance measures are often unrealistic. \n \n16.  The Government is committed to setting the economy and fiscal position right, and \nimprovement in public expenditure and financial management are accorded highest priority. \nReforms are been guided by Te Kakeega II. The strength of the plan is its highly participatory \nformulation. A key weakness is its ambitious scope and lack of prioritization.  \n \nE.  Debt Sustainability \n \n17.  The gross value of public debt was estimated as A$24 million as of the end of 2005. \nTaking into account the Government\u2019s cash holdings, the net debt was estimated at 72% of \nGDP, or 45% of GDP in net present value terms. Such debt levels were substantially above \ndesirable levels. Yet the improvement in returns from the Tuvalu Trust Fund meant that by the \nend  of  2006  gross  debt  stood  at  A$21  million  (about  70%  of  GDP),  net  debt  stood  at \nA$10 million  (35%),  and  the  net  present  value  of  net  debt  was  about  A$3  million  (11%). \n                                                 \n2  The National Bank of Tuvalu (NBT) in 2004 appointed the Falekaupule (local council) treasurer as official agent \nfor the bank to receive deposits and lend money. All transactions were recorded daily and sent by facsimile to the \nbank. The treasurer was allowed a maximum cash holding, and any excess was to be transported back to NBT \nand  deposited  into  the  individual  accounts.  It  appears  that  the  money  was  instead  deposited  into  the \nGovernment\u2019s general account, and NBT instead recorded the outstanding amount as a government overdraft. \nHowever, the Government had stipulated that this overdraft would be non-interest bearing, but with an overdraft at \nits peak of around A$5.024 million at the end of 2006, NBT has foregone income of approximately A$500,000 per \nyear.  \n ", "38   Appendix 3 \nEstimates by TTFAC using 2007 data indicated that at year end-2007, the Government\u2019s gross \ndebt was equivalent to 51.6% of estimated GDP.  \n \n18.  The Government has a considerable domestic debt owed to the National Bank of Tuvalu \n(NBT). This is from the outer islands agency suspense account overdraft (A$3.796 million as of \n30 September 2008), a guaranteed loan for the refurbishment of two longline fishing vessels to \nthe government-owned National Fisheries Corporation (NAFICOT) (A$1.23 million as at 30 June \n2008),  and  debt  incurred  by  the  recently  decorporatized  Tuvalu  Media  Corporation  (TMC) \n($121,500 as at 30 June 2008). These loans, and the Government\u2019s failure to make repayments \non them, are hindering the earnings performance of NBT.  \n \n19.  In considering Tuvalu\u2019s debt sustainability, it is important to recognize country-specific \nfactors. One is the presence of the TTF, the maintained value of which was calculated to be \nA$103,907,772 as of 31 March 2008. The TTF is held in trust and is not directly owned by or \nunder the control of the Government; thus it is not recorded as an asset when calculating the \nlevel of government net debt.  \n \n20.  A second country-specific factor is that about A$5 million of the external debt has not \nbeen spent. It has instead been held in the Falekaupule Trust Fund\u2014a trust fund that also \nincludes contributions from local communities to provide a long-term funding source for outer \nislands development. The market value of the Falekaupule Trust Fund stood at A$24.7 million \nas of 31 March 2007. All funds are invested offshore. \n \n21.  The third and most important country-specific factor is the very high volatility in revenue. \nTuvalu has allowed the trend level of expenditure and net lending to rise above the trend level of \nrevenue  and  grants.  This  has  given  rise  to  an  underlying  budget  deficit.  This  is  a  trend \nprojection,  not  the  immediate  position.  Tuvalu  will  probably  be  free  of  fiscal  difficulties  in \nfavorable years\u2014that is, when offshore revenue is relatively high. This was the case over 2006 \nand 2007 and is likely to remain the case as long as Australian capital markets remain strong. \nBut based on past experience, the trend will be for fiscal problems to reemerge in the absence \nof substantial correction of the underlying fiscal pressures.  \n \n22.  Financial buffers need to be built up in good years so they can be used in poor years. \nThe  financial  buffers  are  the  Government\u2019s  holdings  of  liquid  assets  in  the  Consolidated \nInvestment Fund (CIF) and the cash deposits in bank accounts. Action is required on both the \nexpenditure and revenue side of the budget to build these buffers, and some progress has been \nmade. The Government also utilizes an overdraft facility with NBT for its cash management \nneeds, so as to have access to cash throughout the year, since earnings occur predominantly \nlate in the financial year. This practice results in NBT being exposed to large and unexpected \nwithdrawals by the Government.  \n \n23.  While the Government is aware of the problems\u2013\u2013but to a lesser degree how they have \noccurred\u2013\u2013concerns still remain that there is some potential for the Government to again run up \nfurther debt.3 An integrated and operational MTFF will limit this possibility, but decision-making \nprocesses themselves must be reviewed so that implications of decisions, especially regarding \ndebt, are clear before a decision is made.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3  Though debt cannot be incurred again through the OIASA. \n ", "  Appendix 3    39\nF.

The Government of Tuvalu currently owns 11 public corporations (their details and \nperformance  status  are  outlined  in  Table  A3.1),  each  operating  under  individual  enabling \nlegislation: \n(i)  NBT, established as the sole commercial bank; \n(ii)  Development Bank of Tuvalu (DBT), to provide concessional finance to business; \n(iii)  Tuvalu  National  Provident  Fund  (TNPF),  the  country\u2019s  compulsory \nsuperannuation scheme; \n(iv)  NAFICOT, to develop export and local sales of fish by Tuvaluans; \n(v)  Tuvalu Electricity Corporation (TEC), to provide electrical power on all of the \nisland groups; it is illegal to compete with TEC; \n(vi)  Tuvalu Telecommunications Corporation (TTC), which provides phone, mobile \nphone, internet, and other telecommunications services on Funafuti and, to a \nlesser extent, the outer islands; it is illegal to compete with TTC without its \nconsent; \n(vii)  Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute (TMTI), to train seafarers; \n(viii)  Tuvalu  Philatelic  Bureau,  to  produce  and  sell  stamps  for  mailing  and  for \ncollectors; \n(ix)  Vaiaku Lagi Hotel (VLH), to run a hotel, restaurant ,and bar on Funafuti;  \n(x)  Copra Trading Corporation, to purchase and export copra produced domestically; \nand \n(xi)  TMC, to operate the only radio station; competition is permitted but unlikely \nowing to the small size of the economy.4 \n \n25.  The Government does not have an overall policy for public corporations that (i) clearly \ndefines their purpose and objectives, (ii) sets agreed-upon levels of service operation and \nperformance targets, (iii) provides the mechanism for agreement on the necessary funding for \nits community service obligations, and (iv) sets out clear accountability for operational and \nfinancial matters. Instead, corporations each operate under their individual enabling legislation, \nwithout cohesion, and government involvement is dispersed across a number of ministries. The \nGovernment had assumed that, once corporatized, the enterprises could be left to their own \ndevices and would operate profitably. This has not proved to be the case. The lack of a clear \npolicy is a fundamental weakness in government management of its enterprises. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  TMC was decorporatized in 2007 and is now part of the Ministry of Communications and Transport. \n ", "40   Appendix 3 \nTable A3: Status of Tuvalu\u2019s Corporations \nEnabling  Latest  2006  Number \nLegislation  Audit  Profit  Employed \nCorporation  Acronym  (year)  Chair  Year  ($\u2019000)  (2005) \nNational Bank of  NBT  1982  Secretary, MFEP  2006  410  42 \nTuvalu \nDevelopment Bank of  DBT  1990  Government  2006  (153)  19 \nTuvalu  Accountant, MFEP \nTuvalu National  TNPF  1984  Director of Planning,  2006  245  11 \nProvident Fund  MFEP \nTuvalu Electricity  TEC  1990  Secretary, Ministry of  2006  (777)  86 \nCorporation  Public Works and \nUtilities \nTuvalu  TTC  2003  Secretary, Ministry of  2006  (536)  64 \nTelecommunications  Commerce \nCorporation \nNational Fishing  NAFICOT  Not given  Ministry of Natural  2006  (223.4)  4 \nCorporation  Resources \nVaiaku Lagi Hotel  VLH  1988  MFEP  2006  (889)  35 \nTuvalu Maritime  TMTI  2000  Ministry of Education  2000  (39)  \u2013 \nTraining Institute \nTuvalu Philatelic  TPB  Not given  MFEP  2002  (65.9)  \u2013 \nBureau \nTuvalu Copra Trading  TCT  Not given  Ministry of Public  2002  (22.9)  1 \nCorporation  Works and Utilities \nMFEP = Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning. \nSource: Office of the Auditor General. 2008. Report of the Auditor General 2006. Funafuti. \n \n26.  The Report of the Auditor General 2006 (released in June 2008) indicated a high level of \ndebt across all enterprises.3 Several of the enterprises were operating on overdraft, several had \nquestionable financial sustainability, and most did not prepare their own accounts\u2013\u2013hence, the \nactual financial situation was likely not known until the enterprise received an audit report. The \ncorporations have budgets, but do not have business plans. ADB-funded TA revealed that \navailable funding is often inadequate to support the planned level of operations of these public \nenterprises.5 Continuation of the current approach will lead to corporations becoming insolvent \nand reliant upon growing subsidies and guarantees from the Government.  \n \n27.  A number of government businesses are also embedded in individual ministries and are \nnot producing financial and management reports to assess their revenue-earning potential. \nThese additional businesses include the main port, stevedoring operations, a travel agency, two \ninterisland  vessels,  housing,  repair  shops,  outer  islands  fisheries  centers,  and  an  internet \nfacility. The Government is also a (minority) shareholder in Air Fiji. \n \n28.  Of the public enterprises, only NBT and TNPF are profitable in a normal commercial \nsense.  \n \n29.  NBT\u2019s pretax rate of return on assets was 13.2% in 2005 and 27.1% in 2006, with an \nestimate of 41.3% for 2007. NBT\u2019s high profits are suggestive of market domination as well as \ngood management. However, the lack of a financial institutions act in Tuvalu means regulatory \noversight is nonexistent.  \n \n                                                 \n3  Office of the Auditor General. 2008. Report of the Auditor General 2006. Funafuti. \n5  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to Tuvalu for Improving Public Expenditure Management and Accountability. \nManila. \n ", "  Appendix 3    41\n30.  NBT\u2019s profitability has attracted private sector investment interest. An assessment by the \nPacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (Appendix 2) notes that \n(i)  overall  the  condition  and  performance  of  NBT  appears  to  be  generally \nsatisfactory; \n(ii)  capital  is  strong,  but  a  high  capital  position  is  required  to  support  NBT\u2019s \nexpanding and high-risk loan portfolio; \n(iii)  asset quality is less than satisfactory, with nonperforming loans over 10% of total \nloans; \n(iv)  earnings performance appears to be overstated but is generally satisfactory, \nalthough hindered by the high level of nonperforming loans and by large interest-\nfree loans to the Government; and \n(v)  operations of NBT are generally satisfactory, and no major impediments, beyond \nresolution of the large volume of non-earning government assets and the need \nfor a bank law, were identified that would discourage outside investor interest in \nNBT.  \n \n31.  TNPF holds most of its funds offshore, an investment strategy that has underpinned \ngood commercial performance over time. TNPF has entered into lending operations, allowing \nmembers to borrow against their contributions. The implications of this for performance, and for \nsustained operations as an effective provider of superannuation benefits, are substantial but \nhave not been widely considered.  \n \n32.  DBT, NAFICOT, TEC, and TTC have each accumulated losses of more than A$1 million. \nDBT has at times reported a profit, but typically operates at a loss and was required to write \ndown more than A$1 million in bad debts in 2003. NAFICOT has faced commercial difficulties \nsince  its  inception,  and  the  Government  is  now  servicing  a  A$1  million  loan  secured  by \nNAFICOT in 2003 to purchase fishing vessels.  \n \n33.  The setting of tariffs by cabinet at a level below cost and partial payment of bills by the \nGovernment are key factors behind the poor financial performance of TEC and TTC. Debts \nowed by the Government to TTC had accumulated over a number of years, and in 2007 TTC \naccepted A$1.2 million from the Government as full and final payment. Payments owed to TEC \nby the Government were estimated to stand at A$0.4 million in 2006, while a payment of \nA$0.1 million toward this was made in 2007.6 TTC moved to a prepaid service system in 2004 \nbut  subsequently  moved  away  from  it.  TEC  is  also  considering  a  system  of  prepayment, \nalthough it holds concerns about the high upfront capital cost of such a move.  \n \n34.  TMTI does not charge trainees for its service, and TMC has few of its own revenue \nsources.  Both  TMTI  and  TMC  are  reliant  on  government  subsidies  to  meet  day-to-day \nexpenses. The Tuvalu Philatelic Bureau now only operates on a small scale. VLH has been \nunprofitable over a considerable period, although recently there have been adjustments to the \npricing structure and staffing that may flow through to improved financial performance. There \nhave also been periodic discussions of moving to a management contract for VLH; however, \nissues  of  preservation  of  jobs  and  government  maintenance  of  the  assets  have  proved \nproblematic, and no framework has been developed for the introduction of such a scheme.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6  2006 is the most recent year for which audited accounts of TEC are available. \n ", "42   Appendix 3 \n35.  Te Kakeega II identified a number of priorities to improve public enterprise management, \nall of which are still to be implemented: \n(i)  Strengthen management and staff. \n(ii)  Produce annual reports and audited accounts in accordance with legislation, with \nboth available to the public. \n(iii)  Clearly define, cost out, and better target government subsidies. \n(iv)  Assess the viability of privatizing selected public enterprises. \n(v)  Improve the selection process of boards of directors of public enterprises and \nbroaden membership. \n(vi)  Establish clear guidelines on the roles and responsibilities of ministers, boards, \nand management of public enterprises.  \nIn the absence of a strategic plan and operational policies that encompass all enterprises, these \nindividual interventions will have little impact. \n \n36.  The benefits of strengthened public enterprise performance in terms of achievement of \nthe fiscal PBIs are clear. Improving the performance of public enterprises would reduce their \nfinancial  call  on  the  Government  and  so  reduce  recurrent  expenditure  and/or  allow  the \nredirection of this expenditure to basic health and education priority areas. Reduced financial \ndemands by public enterprises would reduce the need to draw down from the CIF. Improving \nthe performance of corporations would also reduce the debt risk to the Government of the \nguarantees it has provided for public enterprises as well as requests to the Government for \nsubsidies to continue service provision. \n \n37.  However, improved enterprise performance is contingent upon the Government putting \ninto  place  overarching  policies  and  regulatory  mechanisms\u2014the  lack  of  which  has  led  to \nconsistent underperformance. \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  43 \nPROBLEM AND CONSTRAINTS ANALYSIS \n \n1.  Tuvalu faces difficulties in fiscal management\u2013\u2013both through external factors such as \nhigh external debt and volatility of external revenue and through internal issues such as weak \nmanagement and planning procedures and controls. Internal factors include the large and \nincreasing size of the public sector, and placing an extreme drain on financial resources\u2014which \nis not commensurate with performance, tariffs, service quality, or overall revenue from its public \nsector workforce.   \n \n2.  As fiscal management is weak, it is difficult for the Government to accurately determine \nits  financial  position,  and  there  are  inconsistencies  between  budget  papers  and  audited \naccounts.  Record  keeping  is  poor  both  within  the  Government  and  as  supplied  by  public \nenterprises.  The  Government  does  not  use  a  medium-term  fiscal  framework  (MTFF)  for \nplanning and monitoring expenditures, and decisions are often unrelated to its current financial \nposition.  This  is  particularly  the  case  with  regard  to  the  provision  of  subsidies  for \nunderperforming enterprises or those with cash flow problems. \n \n3.  The private sector is very weak, and there are limited opportunities for growth without \noversaturation. The Government manages business-like operations that could be tendered or \ntaken up by the private sector under management contracts, but this has not yet occurred. \n \n4.  Only 2 of the 11 public corporations are operating profitably. There is no overarching \nlegislation that defines the obligations of the corporations, and many do not prepare corporate \nplans or state performance targets. Many do not submit annual reports, and some corporations \nhave not been audited for several years due to lack of financial records.  \n \n5.  The economy is fragile and highly dependent on external assistance as well as on trust \nfunds. Options for improving the internal revenue base have been identified but not yet fully \nimplemented. These include tax reforms, tariff reviews, and mechanisms to improve enterprise \nperformance and profitability.   \n \n6.  The key constraints to addressing the broad problem of fiscal sustainability being faced \nby Tuvalu are considered below. \n \nA.  Political Constraints \n \n7.  While Tuvalu has had stable government for some years now, the political will for long-\nterm commitment to reforms has been unclear. The policy intent set down in Te Kakeega II has \nnot been followed through with key elements such as development of a MTFF, and public \nenterprise reform is still outstanding. Steps had been taken toward at least partial privatization \nof the National Bank of Tuvalu and at looking at private sector involvement in the Vaiaku Lagi \nHotel, but this had not been followed through to completion. At the same time, an opposing \nmessage was sent regarding the Government\u2019s policy stance through decorporatization of the \nTuvalu Media Corporation.  \n \nB.  Institutional Constraints \n \n8.  The Government\u2019s ability to manage fiscal pressures and promote fiscal sustainability is \nconstrained  by  the  institutional  environment.  The  Government  lacks  many  key  fiscal \nmanagement  tools  and  disciplines,  including utilization  of  a  MTFF.  This  hampers  effective \npriority setting and budget control.  \n ", "44   Appendix 4 \n9.  The legislative environment, which guides government actions, is also lacking is some \nkey aspects. There is no overarching legal framework to guide public corporations. Nor is there \nan act to allow for the oversight of financial institutions to ensure that they meet international \nstandards.   \n \n10.  The policy environment is a further constraint. There are no policies on government \nownership and divestment despite there having been a range of decisions entered into in these \nareas. The lack of a policy means there is no guiding principle behind decisions, and decisions \ncan even be conflicting or counterproductive.  \n \nC.  Organizational Constraints \n \n11.  Key oversight organizations, such as the offices of the attorney general and the auditor \ngeneral, have failed to take an assertive approach to institutional issues. There has been no \neffort to address the lack of overarching policies that could be applied uniformly, especially to \n(i) enterprise reporting and performance, (ii) wages and staffing of enterprises, (iii) banking \npractices, (iv) ownership, and (v) divestment. \n \nD.  Social and Cultural Constraints \n \n12.  Tuvalu has a very strong community outlook. This has a number of positive impacts in \nterms of welfare, but some negative ones that impact on the level of public sector performance \nas well as the development of the private sector in particular. In such a community-focused \nsociety, it is difficult for competent individuals to stand out, as resources and earnings are \nconsidered the property of the extended family. Because there is no individual reward for effort, \nthe  incentives  for  individual  performance  are  not  present.  Further,  law  enforcement  and \nenforcement of tariffs and bills are difficult due to the constraints imposed by family structures \nand personal relationships.  \n \n13.  Tuvalu is still relatively new to the cash economy, and much of the population remains \nsubsistence-based. Subsistence lifestyle tends to promote a relatively short-term outlook; long-\nterm planning and intergenerational planning concepts, such as wealth creation, are not easily \nassimilated. Monetary trade can sometimes be inconsistent with traditional values and systems. \nThe  interplay  between  traditional  systems  and  market  forces  can  result  in  second-best \noutcomes. \n \n14.  The Government, or the public sector, is the driver of Tuvalu\u2019s domestic economy and as \nsuch is seen as the provider, considered to have infinite capacity to generate and disperse \nfunds. As the population grows and their needs become more sophisticated, the fiscal pressure \ngenerated by growing government expenditure cannot be sustained.   \n \nE.  Implications of Constraints \n \n15.  The constraints described above directly impact on the provision of public services. \nThere are no mechanisms in place to monitor enterprise performance and quality of service \ndelivery. There is no link between performance and remuneration. There are no consequences \nfor  general  managers  or  boards  for  underperformance  and  nonprofitability  of  public \ncorporations.  Government  responsibility  for  public  corporations  is  shared  by  control  being \ndispersed across various ministries, without a policy framework or tradition of enforcement. \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  45\n16.  The constraints also affect the management of public enterprises. The Government is \nholding down prices for electricity, telecommunications, and shipping below cost. The Tuvalu \nMaritime Training Institute does not charge individuals for training and is reliant on external \nassistance  for  service  provision.  The  Government  has  run  up  substantial  debts  to  public \ncorporations, and there have been limited attempts to redress this situation. There has been no \nidentification  of  community  service  obligations  and  cost  apportionment.  Under  these \ncircumstances, sound financial management of public corporations is hampered. \n \n17.  From  a  wider  development  perspective,  the  poor  fiscal  management  of  Tuvalu,  in \ncombination with the poor performance of public corporations, has contributed to the lack of \nopportunities for real private sector development other than through private management of \ngovernment businesses.  \n ", "46  Appendix 5 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved technical assistance (TA) to Tuvalu \nfor Capacity Development for Public Financial Management.1 The intended impact of the TA is \nsustained  economic  growth  and  fiscal  stability,  as  prioritized  in  Tuvalu\u2019s  national  plan,  Te \nKakeega II. The expected outcome is improved government fiscal planning and management \ncapacity. The achievement of the expected outcome will be reflected in the Government\u2019s \ncapacity to achieve the policy, legislative, and institutional changes to which it has committed \nunder the proposed grant for the Improved Financial Management Program. The TA will go \nfurther by improving the management of finances and government enterprises while considering \nissues of strategy and ownership.  \n \nA.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n2.  The TA will develop a medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) and create the policy and \nlegislative  environment  for  improving  the  performance  of  public  enterprises.  It  will \nsimultaneously work with enterprises to put in place management and planning tools to help \nthem understand and improve their performance and enable the Government and its enterprises \nto monitor and manage performance. The TA will provide capacity development and support \nthrough four components: \n \n1.  Component 1: Management Services  \n \n3.  The TA will be supported by augmented management services from the consultant firm, \nwhich will provide ongoing management, liaison, and mentoring, as well as the coordination of \ninputs,  to  ensure  that  inputs  are  directed  toward  the  agreed  upon  objectives  rather  than \nfragmented. The expected output will be effective capacity development and management of \npublic enterprise reforms.  \n \n4.  The main activities will be to (i) support the establishment of a mechanism through which \nthe Government can better manage enterprise monitoring, including a steering committee and a \npublic enterprise unit; (ii) develop an overall strategy and implementation plan for the TA; \n(iii) coordinate  all  TA  inputs,  including  coordination  with  other  development  partner-funded \nactivities; (iv) help the Government review lessons in enterprise ownership and management, \nand  facilitate  their  application;  (v) promote  positive  and  productive  relationships  with \ngovernment, enterprises, development partners, and ADB; and (vi) provide quarterly and annual \nmonitoring of TA progress and associated reporting. \n \n2.  Component 2: Strengthening Fiscal and Enterprise Management \n \n5.  This component will provide stronger and more coherent oversight of fiscal and public \nenterprise performance. The main activities will be to (i) help Ministry of Finance and Economic \nPlanning (MFEP) develop and implement an MTFF; (ii) provide training for staff of the public \nenterprise unit on its role; (iii) develop and implement a strategic policy on public enterprise \ngovernance reform, outlining the Government\u2019s position on enterprise ownership and options for \ndivestment; (iv) prepare the public corporations act as overarching legislation that sets out \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to Tuvalu for Capacity Development for Public Financial Management. Manila \n(3 November). The TA, while related to the Program, was processed separately to allow the diagnostic analysis of \nthe capacity of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MFEP) to be undertaken promptly to provide ADB \nand other development partners with a better understanding of where capacity gaps are and how to better manage \nfor these.  \n ", "  Appendix 5  47\ngovernment  monitoring  requirements  and  management  and  reporting  requirements  for  all \nenterprises;  (v) develop  a  regulatory  framework  for  monitoring  enterprises  and  a  legal \nframework  for  both  establishing  and  divesting  enterprises;  (vi)  coordinate  with  the  Pacific \nFinancial Technical Assistance Centre regarding assistance to develop a financial institutions \nbill; and (vii) assess the tariffs required for the financial sustainability of the Tuvalu Electricity \nCorporation and the Tuvalu Telecommunications Corporation, and provide options for how the \nfinancial requirements of these public enterprises can be balanced with the community services \nrequired of them by the Government.  \n \n3.  Component 3: Results-Based Planning and Management Assistance for \nEnterprise Performance Improvement \n \n6.  The  output  of  this  component  will  be  strengthened  management  capacity  in  public \nenterprises. The main activities will be to (i) work with general managers and boards of directors \nto develop and implement a corporate plan and an action plan for each enterprise, based on the \nGovernment\u2019s overarching public enterprise strategic policy and plan, and help them meet the \nrequirements  of  the  public  corporations  act;  (ii)  improve  accounting  and  management  by \nintroducing basic accounting skills and disciplines to allow standardized and timely accounts to \nbe submitted to boards and then to the public enterprise unit; (iii) provide assistance to support \nspecific  National  Bank  of  Tuvalu  policy  and  practice  changes  to  improve  performance; \n(iv) develop job descriptions for use in all enterprises, together with a performance appraisal \nformat;  and  (v)  support  the  Government\u2019s  assessment  of  the  private  sector  development \npotential in Tuvalu as a basis for decisions on appropriate private sector involvement in public \nenterprises.  \n \n4.  Component 4: Capacity Building \n \n7.  This component will strengthen the capacity in MFEP and public enterprises to provide \nsustainable fiscal management, planning and monitoring, and public enterprise monitoring and \nmanagement. The main activities will be (i) a diagnostic analysis of MFEP capacity, building on \nthe results of the 2007 public expenditure and financial accountability review, and developing a \nframework to measure planned interventions to remedy budgeting and financial management \nproblems (to be financed by the Government of Australia); (ii) formal training, informal on-the-\njob development and learning by doing, and mentoring for MFEP, the Public Enterprise Unit, \nboards, and general managers; and (iii) raising public and stakeholder awareness undertaken in \nregard to specific issues.  \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n \n8.  The TA is estimated to cost $982,750, of which $57,750 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Government of Australia1 and administered by ADB, and $800,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government of Tuvalu will finance $125,000 \nequivalent by providing office space and facilities, legal services, counterpart staff, support \nservices, and office supplies.  \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n9.  MFEP  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  will,  with  TA  support,  establish  a  public \nenterprise unit comprising two professional staff and a secretary. This unit will be the focal point \nfor the TA and will remain as the interface between enterprises and the Government after TA \ncompletion. The secretary for finance will provide guidance for TA implementation with the \nsupport of a steering committee comprising government representatives.  \n ", "48   Appendix 5 \n10.  The TA will finance 25.5 person-months of intermittent international consulting services \nand  8  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  ADB  will  recruit  a  firm  based  on  a \nsimplified technical proposal under the quality- and cost-based selection process, using an \n80:20 weighting for quality and cost. The consultant team will have a (i) team leader and advisor \non  institutional  strengthening  and  public  enterprise  development  (international,  12  person-\nmonths),  (ii)  specialist  in  developing  public  financial  management  capacity  (international, \n2.5 person-months), (iii) public financial management advisor (international, 8 person-months), \n(iv) planning and human resource development advisor (international, 3 person-months), and \n(v) project  facilitator  (national,  8  person-months).  International  advisors  will  be  very  senior \ntechnical specialists in their field, with extensive experience in small island states, as well as \nskilled trainers committed to capacity building.  \n \n11.  TA implementation will be supported with augmented management services from a \nproject manager working approximately 3 person-months and provided by the firm for a lump \nsum.  The  management  and  administrative  input  of  the  project  manager  will  be  provided \nintermittently but according to an agreed upon plan throughout TA implementation. The project \nmanager will be responsible for developing the detailed terms of reference for the advisors and \nthe national consultant. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented intermittently over 38 months starting in December 2008 \nand ending in December 2011. TA implementation will commence with a diagnostic analysis of \nMFEP capacity. The implementation of remaining activities will commence with an inception \nreport prepared for ADB and the Government by the team leader within 4 weeks of the start of \nfield activities, which will include an overall work plan for the full period and a detailed work plan \nfor the first year. Brief quarterly progress reports will be prepared in consultation with the public \nenterprise unit and provided to ADB.

Financial Management Program \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  Pacific Department/Pacific \nProgram Grant \nModality:  Division:  Subregional Office \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of \nthe partner country. \n \nTuvalu has experienced poor economic growth over the last 5 years. Real gross domestic product grew at only around \n2%\u20133% per annum. Economic growth is mainly driven by offshore earnings, public sector expenditure, and construction. \nBroadening of economic activity and private sector development are key strategies for improving economic growth rates \nand reducing poverty.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s Te Kakeega II 2004\u20132010 lays the foundation for sustainable and broad-based economic growth \nsupported by continued reforms and private sector development to improve the quality of life for all people in Tuvalu. In the \nmicro-sized economy of Tuvalu, poor expenditure allocation decisions have significant opportunity costs. For this reason, \neffective fiscal management will make the greatest contribution to meeting Government priorities and is the focus of the \nCPS. Poor people are disproportionately affected by shifts in government expenditure and also by poor reliability and \nquality of utility services (power, water), and by inefficiencies in public utilities \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:   General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nDuring implementation of the public enterprise governance reform strategic policy included in the policy matrix poverty \nanalysis will be required in relation to changes made to public service providing public corporations and government \nbusiness enterprises\u2014these may include providers of power, water, telecommunications and banking services. This \nshould include both analysis of impact of any changes (including in tariffs and service quality) on current clients and also \non potential clients where access to services is increased. This analysis should inform the design of community service \nobligations and allow for better targeting of safety nets to ensure the access of the poorest to basic levels of services.  \n \n2. Design Features.  \nThere are no specific pro-poor design features.  \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nKey Issues. The impact of the program on the budget should provide benefits to the Tuvalu economy and the Tuvaluan \npeople. The specific areas of impact ans scale of impact will be dependent on the decisions government makes once a \nstrengthened policy and legislative environment is put in place and so is unable to be assessed at this point. The potential \nimpacts of resultant government decisions will be assessed and analyzed under the supporting TA.   \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nStakeholder analysis will be undertaken as part of the reform process to fully understand and take into account the views \nof, and interests of, and impacts on all stakeholder groups. This analysis will be supported through the technical \nassistance (TA) for Capacity Development for Public Financial Management.  \n \n2.

This analysis will be supported through the technical \nassistance (TA) for Capacity Development for Public Financial Management.  \n \nThe TA for Capacity Development for Public Financial Management which supports the implementation of the policy matrix \nincludes provision for a local project facilitator, the TOR for which focus on consultation and participation activities to be \nundertaken under the guidance of the technical specialists and advisors. These activities will be directed at client groups \nand public enterprise workers, as well as government officials and parliamentarians. The TA for Capacity Development for \nPublic Financial Management incorporates the preparation and implementation of stakeholder participation and \nconsultations into the reform process. \nC.
