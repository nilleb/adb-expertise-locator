THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $250,000,000 equivalent in US dollars and yuan, comprising (i) an A loan of up to \n$100,000,000  equivalent  in  US  dollars  and  yuan,  and  (ii) a  complementary  loan  of  up  to \n$150,000,000 equivalent in US dollars and yuan to CT Environmental Group Limited (CTEG) for \nthe Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Industrial Wastewater and Sludge Treatment Project in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  In the  PRC,  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  play  an  important role  in \neconomic development, as they are key drivers of income and employment growth. In 2010, \nSMEs  contributed  60%  of  gross  domestic  product,  provided  around  80%  of  new  urban \nemployment (with particular benefit to low-income workers and socially vulnerable groups), and \nintroduced 75% of new technologies.2 The PRC aims to further develop SMEs by accelerating \ntheir  economic  transformation,  enhancing  the  provision  of  services,  and  promoting  their \nsustainable growth.3 \n \n3.  On the other hand, SMEs are becoming major polluters, and are associated with severe \nenvironmental impact in some industrial areas. More than 80% of SMEs generate pollution in \nindustrial production, accounting for 60% of the pollution generated in the PRC.4 Most face \nchallenges in their production processes, such as obsolete technologies, low efficiency, and \nhigh water consumption.5 Among various pollution indicators for wastewater, chemical oxygen \ndemand and ammonia nitrogen have been specially targeted by the government for control. \nIndustries where SMEs are responsible for wastewater with the highest levels of chemical \noxygen demand and ammonia nitrogen are the paper, food processing, chemical, and textile \nindustries. \n \n4.  Industrial wastewater is difficult to treat due to high pollutant concentration, complex \nchemical composition, and high variance in water quantity and quality. In the PRC, treatment of \nindustrial wastewater is handled separately from sewage pipeline networks operated by the \nmunicipal governments. Large industrial enterprises often operate their own treatment systems \non  site,  discharging  treated  wastewater  into  rivers  and  bypassing  municipal  wastewater \ntreatment facilities. Most SMEs, however, do not have sufficient treatment capability and instead \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   W.

An additional challenge arises from sludge, a waste by-product of wastewater treatment \nor waste from industrial processes. More than 80% of sludge is untreated in the PRC, which has \nserious impact on soil and groundwater quality.7 Sludge from industry is particularly toxic, since \nit can be higher in heavy metal content (70%\u201390% of heavy metals are absorbed into sludge). \n \n6.  To address increasing impacts on health caused by pollution from industrial wastewater, \nthe government is taking urgent action. In January 2015, an amended Environmental Protection \nLaw took effect; the law\u2019s amendments raised wastewater discharge standards and imposed \nsevere punishments on noncompliant enterprises, including criminal penalties and uncapped \nfines.8 In April 2015, the State Council released the Water Pollution Prevention and Control \nAction Plan, widely viewed as the PRC\u2019s most comprehensive and aggressive policy measure \nto arrest water pollution.9 Further, wastewater treatment standards have been progressively \ntightened for specific industrial subsectors.10 Tougher regulation raises particular challenges for \nSMEs; whereas environmental agencies tend to monitor and ensure environmental compliance \nfrom larger-scale factories, they have not historically imposed the same measures on SMEs, \nmost of which are noncompliant. Many SMEs lack the technical capability to treat highly toxic \nwastewater  to  meet  the  higher  standards  by  themselves.  Further,  the  investment  and \noperational costs for wastewater treatment equipment are prohibitively high for many SMEs due \nto a lack of economies of scale.11 \n \n7.  To address pollution from SMEs, the government has also launched various initiatives to \npromote  eco-industrial  parks,  which  are  specially  accredited  industrial  parks  that  have \nenvironmental risk control measures, centralize treatment of wastewater, and reuse industrial \nwater. The number of industrial parks accredited as eco-industrial parks increased from 2 in \n2001 to 64 in 2014.12 The government\u2019s initiatives have created new business opportunities to \ntreat wastewater for a cluster of SMEs. \n \n8.  Through continuous dialogue with stakeholders in the PRC wastewater sector, the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  identified  CTEG  as  a  private  sector  pioneer  in  SME  industrial \nwastewater and sludge treatment. The company was confirmed as a viable candidate for ADB \nsupport, following a review of its technical and financial performance, its willingness to meet \nADB standards, and the potential benefits to the PRC environmental services industry resulting \nfrom the company\u2019s expansion. \n                                                \n6  Government of the PRC, Ministry of Environmental Protection. 2014.

The project will support CTEG to build, own, and operate a series of specialized SME \nindustrial  wastewater  and  sludge  treatment  plants  (or  subprojects)  in  designated  areas \ndetermined by the local governments. CTEG\u2019s facilities will target SMEs in highly polluting \nindustrial sectors, such as textile, paper, chemical, and food processing. Treated wastewater \nwill be discharged according to national environmental standards or supplied to industry for \nreuse in manufacturing. \n \n10.  CTEG  will  be  responsible  for  identifying,  evaluating,  selecting,  negotiating, \nimplementing, and administering the subprojects. Subprojects for ADB assistance will meet \neligibility criteria agreed between CTEG and ADB. In selecting a location for each subproject, \nCTEG  will  evaluate  the  local  government\u2019s  accountability,  and  the  volume  and  quality  of \nwastewater discharged by industries. \n \n3.  The Sponsor and the Borrower \n11.  The project sponsor and borrower, CTEG, is a leading provider of integrated water \nsolutions in the PRC, with businesses covering wastewater treatment, industrial water supply, \nand sludge and solid waste treatment. CTEG was founded as Xi Zhou Enterprises Hong Kong \nin 1999 by Tsui Cham To of Hong Kong, China; the company commenced operations in 2003, \nand under Tsui\u2019s leadership became an early leader in its industry. In anticipation of a stock \nexchange listing, in 2010 the company was renamed as CTEG and established as a holding \ncompany incorporated in the Cayman Islands.13 In 2013, CTEG was listed on the Hong Kong \nStock Exchange.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n12.  CTEG differentiates itself from peers in the PRC\u2019s wastewater treatment and water \nsupply market by focusing on industrial SMEs, including customers in the textile, paper, and \nfood processing sectors. The company aggregates wastewater discharge from customers in a \nsingle location, such as an industrial park, and then treats it using a combination of chemical \nand biological processes. CTEG employs custom technologies that are adapted to the specific \ncharacteristics  of  its  customers\u2019  effluent.14 Additionally,  treated  wastewater  is  recycled  to \ncustomers for reuse in manufacturing processes. \n \n13.  As of June 2015, CTEG operated six industrial wastewater treatment plants with total \ntreatment capacity of 545,000 tons per day, three industrial water supply plants with total supply \ncapacity of 280,000 tons per day, one industrial solid waste treatment plant with capacity of \n2,278 tons per day, two municipal wastewater treatment plants with total treatment capacity of \n120,000 tons per day, three sludge treatment plants with total capacity of 3,142 tons per day, \nand five hazardous waste treatment plants with total capacity of 904 tons per day. \n \n14.  CTEG has demonstrated rapid growth since its establishment, especially in the period \nsince 2012.  \n \n                                                \n13   \n14  To achieve the best treatment performance, CTEG uses specialized equipment and technologies developed in-\nhouse, such as rotary solid removal equipment, anaerobic hydrolysis tanks, and solar-powered sludge drying \nsystems. ", "4 \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n15.  Impact. The project will contribute to mitigating water pollution from SMEs, consistent \nwith goals of the State Council of the PRC (footnote 9). \n \n16.  Outcome.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  SME  industrial  wastewater  and  sludge \nmanagement through increased treatment of wastewater and sludge. About one-third of the \ntreated wastewater for SME customers impacted by the project will be reused. \n \n17.  Output. The output will be the installation and operation of SME industrial wastewater \nand sludge treatment plants at designed performance levels. By 2019, wastewater treatment \ncapacity of 450,000 tons per day (to meet the most stringent national standard15), sludge \ntreatment capacity of 4,200 tons per day, and industrial water supply capacity of 240,000 tons \nper day will be developed. The facilities will comply with ADB safeguards and technical and \nfinancial eligibility criteria.16 \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n18.  Consistency with ADB strategy. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review \nof Strategy 2020, which identifies infrastructure and the environment as two of the four strategic \npriorities.17 On infrastructure, the project is in line with the strategy\u2019s focus on water, sanitation, \nand waste management, as well as with its emphasis on public\u2013private partnership. On the \nenvironment,  the  project  mitigates  water  pollution  and  health  threats  and  promotes \nenvironmentally sustainable growth. \n \n19.  Consistency with country partnership strategy. By supporting inclusive growth and \nenvironmental sustainability, the project addresses two of the three development goals of ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for the PRC.18 The project aligns with the country partnership \nstrategy\u2019s sector focus on environmental protection, water management, and pollution control, \nand strongly complements ADB\u2019s current initiatives in wastewater treatment and water pollution \ncontrol in urban areas, including advisory support. \n \n20.  Consistency with the water and urban operational plans. The project aligns with \nADB\u2019s water policy, which recognizes that remedies to water stress must include reversing the \ndegradation of water resources caused by agricultural, industrial, and municipal effluents.19 \nADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 also identifies wastewater management as a key \noperational focus in rapidly industrializing countries like the PRC.20 The project is an example of \nthe type of intervention envisaged by the plan, which promotes water as a core investment area \nand raises ADB\u2019s water investment target to $2.0 billion\u2013$2.5 billion a year by 2020, and targets \nan additional $500 million per year for private sector lending. In addition, the project supports \n                                                \n15  Government of  the  PRC,  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection.  2002.

Table 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n \nTable 2: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  Each subproject is based on a build\u2013own\u2013operate or build\u2013operate\u2013transfer \narrangement. Each subproject will be implemented in accordance with granted \napprovals, and during construction and operation will be subject to government \ninspections  of  various  aspects,  including  environment,  land  acquisition, \ninvoluntary resettlement, ethnic minorities, labor, safety, quality, and sanitation. \nInflow and outflow volumes and quality will be monitored in all the subprojects. \nManagement  CTEG will establish a company for each subproject. CTEG will own and manage \nall of its subproject companies, and will centrally control their development, \nprocurement, and financing. \nImplementation period  January 2016\u2013December 2018 \nProcurement  Goods and services will be required to be procured from ADB member countries \nin  a  transparent  manner,  through  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Each \nsubproject company will enter into engineering, procurement, and construction \ncontracts with subcontractors separately. \nOperations arrangements \nRevenue structure  CTEG  will  directly  negotiate  and  enter  into  agreements  with  customers  to \nprovide industrial wastewater and sludge treatment services or industrial water \nsupply.  Customers  will  undertake  wastewater  pretreatment  to  bring  effluent \nwithin a defined quality range before delivery to CTEG. Treatment fees will \ndepend  on  the  quality  of  the  wastewater  and  sludge  CTEG  treats  or  the \nindustrial water it supplies. The treated wastewater will be discharged to water \nbodies or reused by industries where possible. CTEG will treat sludge from its \nown plants as well as from municipal water treatment plants owned by local \ngovernments; treated sludge will be reused as nutrition soil, bricks, or ceramsite \nwhere technically and commercially possible. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nMajor cost structure  The major costs comprise electricity, materials, labor, and administrative and \nmaintenance expenses. \nOperation and  Operation  and  maintenance  will  generally  be  handled  by  each  subproject \nmaintenance  company\u2019s employees, who will be transferred from CTEG and/or recruited \nexternally. \nPerformance  Key  performance  indicators,  including  output  and  outcome  indicators,  and \nmonitoring  compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements, will be reported by CTEG. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CTEG = CT Environmental Group.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n                                                \n21  ADB. 2013.

Initial financial projections indicate the project would yield a minimum financial internal \nrate of return of higher than the weighted average cost of capital. The project is economically \nviable, as the economic internal rate of return is higher thanthe social discount rate of 12.0%. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n23.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance to CTEG consists of (i) an A loan of up to $100 million \nequivalent  in  US  dollars  and  yuan,  and  (ii)  a  complementary  loan  of  up  to  $150  million \nequivalent in US dollars and yuan. ADB will fund the A loan from its ordinary capital resources \nand the complementary loan from participating banks with ADB acting as lender of record. The \nA loan will have a maturity of up to 10 years from the date of the facility agreement. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n24.  Justification for ADB involvement in the project is based on the following:  \n(i)  Through  ADB\u2019s  partnership  with  a  pioneering  company,  the  project  will \ndemonstrate how SME industrial wastewater and sludge treatment investments \ncan be commercially and technically viable. ADB\u2019s requirements will ensure that \nCTEG operates according to best international practices and adheres to high \nstandards of environmental and social management, serving as a model for the \nindustry.  ADB  assistance  will  build  confidence  in  future  private  sector \nparticipation. \n(ii)  ADB assistance will lower transaction costs by bundling multiple infrastructure \nsubprojects,  which  are  often  too  small  and  time-consuming  for  international \ncommercial banks to finance on a stand-alone basis. ADB will link the cluster of \nsubprojects with the international financing community by arranging syndication \nand providing in-depth technical and safeguard due diligence. \n \nC.  Risks  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n25.  Demand  risk.  Demand  for  CTEG\u2019s  services  depends  on  local  governments\u2019 \ncommitment to develop industrial zones and to attract SMEs into such areas and contract for \nCTEG\u2019s services.  CTEG mitigates this risk by expanding in phases. In addition, ADB loans will \nsupport subprojects developed under arrangements that provide exclusive rights to provide \nservices in designated areas. Lastly, the recent tightening of environmental discharge standards \nand enforcement (para. 6), and the significant investment required for SMEs to build and \noperate  their  own  wastewater  treatment  facilities,  should  encourage  SMEs  to  outsource \nwastewater treatment to CTEG. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n ", "7 \n \n26.  Offtaker  counterparty  risk.  CTEG\u2019s  customers  are  SMEs,  which  pose  increased \ncounterparty risk due to their smaller size and varying credit quality. CTEG\u2019s customers are also \nconcentrated in the highly seasonal textile industry, resulting in volatile cash flows.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n   \n27.  Regulatory  risk.  The  PRC\u2019s  increased  promotion  of  environmental  protection  and \nsustainable  development  imposes  stricter  regulation  on  industrial  water  pollution.  Policies \nimplemented nationally from 2015 significantly tighten standards for industrial effluent quality, \nincrease pollution penalties, and empower local regulators to close noncompliant factories. \nSince the implementation of national regulations varies locally and regulatory practices are \nevolving, the standards and costs under which CTEG operates face some uncertainty. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n28.  Safeguards. The project is classified as category B for environment. The wastewater \nand  sludge  treatment  services  cater  to  various  SMEs,  particularly  in  textile  industries. \nDewatered sludge is transported to a brick-making facility, which is also operated by CTEG. The \nsites for CTEG\u2019s wastewater and sludge treatment plants are selected in coordination with \nrespective  local  governments.  Since  2003,  the  PRC  has  required  wastewater  and  sludge \ntreatment plants to conduct a full environmental assessment. The facilities are to be planned \nand  operated  in  full  compliance  with  PRC\u2019s  laws  and  regulations.  Potential  adverse \nenvironmental impacts during operation include effluent quality, sludge management, noise, \nodor,  and  possible  generation  of  toxic  gases.  Potential  adverse  impacts  associated  with \nconstruction and operation can be mitigated through the adoption of good engineering practices \nand  an  appropriate  environmental  management  plan.  Initial  environmental  examinations \n(including environmental management plans) will be prepared for ADB-funded subprojects in \naccordance  with  Appendix  1  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  CTEG\u2019s \nenvironmental and social management system (ESMS) will include environmental safeguards \nscreening procedures to avoid subprojects with potential to be category A. The subprojects are \ncontingent on local government plans for industrial development and pollution control; CTEG \nbids on and secures specific subprojects before preparing each environmental assessment, \nincluding  the  initial  environmental  examination  requirement  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been identified \nand effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts \nare in the environmental and social audit report, including the corrective action plan. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n29.  The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement and category C for \nindigenous peoples. Subprojects will be located in or near industrial zones. As industrial zones \nare  set  up  by  municipal  governments,  land  acquisition,  compensation,  resettlement,  and \nrehabilitation are expected to be insignificant and, if needed, will be carried out by municipal \ngovernments. The ESMS will reflect the resettlement policy principles of Appendix 2 of ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement and will include procedures to screen subprojects that may be \neligible for ADB funding. Subprojects with potential to be category A for involuntary resettlement ", "8 \nwill be excluded.
