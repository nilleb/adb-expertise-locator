THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia for the Bihar State Highways III Project. \n \n2.  The project will rehabilitate and upgrade about 230 kilometers (km) of state highways in \nBihar state and improve road transport connectivity in line with the state\u2019s road development plan \nfor 2015\u20132035.1 It will involve (i) upgrading state highways to standard two-lane width with paved \nshoulders; and (ii) reconstructing, widening, and strengthening culverts and bridges. The project \nwill include building institutional capacity of the state for road design and maintenance and \nincorporating appropriate new technologies in the state\u2019s road subsector. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  State context. Bihar is the 12th largest state in India by area, covering about 99,000 \nsquare kilometers (km2); the third most populous, with about 104 million inhabitants; and the sixth \nmost densely populated. It is in the eastern region of the country, bordering Uttar Pradesh in the \nwest, West Bengal in the east, and Jharkhand in the south. The Ganga River flows through the \nmiddle of the Bihar plain from west to east, physically dividing the state into northern and southern \nregions. The northern region is bordered by Nepal. In the past, Bihar has lagged behind other \nstates in terms of social and economic development. Based on 2011\u20132012 data, the Government \nof India estimates that 34% of Bihar\u2019s population lives below the poverty line, compared with 22% \nnationally.2 The annual per capita income in Bihar (\u20b929,178 at constant 2011 prices) was about \n35% of the national average in 2016\u20132017, compared with about 28% in 2006. With increased \ninvestment in social infrastructure and improved governance, the state aspires to grow at a faster \nrate than the country average. In 2016\u20132017, the medium-term growth rate for gross state \ndomestic product in Bihar was 10.3%, compared with 7.0% for the national economy.3 \n \n4.  Road network. The road network of the state comprises 226,350 km as of 2017 (Table \n1). All higher-class roads\u2014national highways, state highways, and major district roads\u2014are \npaved, but most rural roads are unpaved. During 2015\u20132016, in terms of road length per 100 km2, \nBihar overtook the national average\u2014219 km against 139 km. However, at 4.7 km per 100 km2, \nthe road density of state highways in Bihar is lower than the national average of 5.1 km per 100 \nkm2 and is much lower than in other developed states in India.4 \n \nTable 1: Road Network in Bihar \nLength \nNo.  Class of Road  (kilometer) \n1  National highway  4,917 \n2  State highway  4,006 \n3  Major district road  11,146 \n4  Rural road  206,281 \nTotal  226,350 \nSource: Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited. \n                                                 \n1  Government of Bihar, RCD. 2015.

The number of motorized vehicles registered in the state has increased from \n1.96 million in 2009 to 5.48 million in 2016, an average annual increase of 20%. Of these, over \n74% were two-wheelers, about 7% were cars and jeeps, and the balance were other categories, \nincluding trucks and buses. The average annual vehicle growth observed during 2009\u20132016 was \nover 17% for two-wheelers and 14% for cars.5 Vehicular densities and current road conditions \nrequire road capacity improvement and upgrading, which this project primarily seeks to address. \n \n6.  Road safety. The road accident fatality rate in Bihar is much higher than the national \naverage. In 2016, 54% of road accidents in Bihar resulted in death against the national average \nof 27%. The absolute number of fatalities is likely to increase as traffic grows, having increased \nfrom 4,390 in 2009 to 4,901 in 2016. To counter the rapid rise in road accident fatalities, the \nproject will put stronger emphasis on road safety measures and will improve awareness through \nroad safety campaigns conducted for the affected villages. \n \n7.  Vision for road development. Bihar\u2019s vision as stated in the road master plan (2015\u2013\n2035) is \u201c(t)here shall be good transport accessibility for all populations in the State of Bihar, with \na high-quality, high-mobility road network available for the transport of people and goods.\u201d6 The \nGovernment of Bihar has stepped up investments in the development of transport infrastructure \nand has been improving the state highways and major district roads through a combination of \nbudgetary support, financial assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, and public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs). The State Highways \nDevelopment Program aims to widen all state highways to two lanes, and to improve bridges and \ndistrict and rural roads. To achieve this, the road master plan estimates a large capital expenditure \nrequirement of $15.8 billion for road improvements until 2035. At present, approximately $8 billion \nhas been allocated for the same period. The road development master plan considers PPPs and \nsome form of cess on fuel will contribute about $4 billion. These measures are aspirational, and \nit appears likely that the master plan investments can only be partially met. The government relies \nheavily on increased budget allocations and multilateral and bilateral agency borrowing. \n \n8.  Road institutions. The Road Construction Department (RCD) is the nodal department \nfor the road subsector. Institutional capacity in the road subsector has been gradually built in Bihar, \nwith support from ADB in prior loans. The Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited \n(BSRDCL) functions as a special-purpose company under the RCD, with delegated powers and \nresponsibilities. The BSRDCL has contributed significantly to the state\u2019s ability in using multilateral \nand bilateral finance, and in developing projects under PPP. \n \n9.  Road maintenance. In Bihar, the RCD manages the national highways (except roads \nunder the National Highway Authority of India), state highways, and major district roads on behalf \nof the Government of Bihar. The RCD is organized into four wings\u2014north Bihar, south Bihar, \nnational highway, and special project\u2014which are responsible for construction and maintenance \nof roads. The RCD receives fiscal allocations from the Government of Bihar. In fiscal year (FY) \n2017, the total allocation was \u20b967.6 billion, which was about three times more than that in FY2007 \nand with an average annual increase rate of 12.1% since FY2007. Meanwhile, the funds available \nfor road maintenance have also increased at a similar pace. Under the Bihar Road Assets \nMaintenance Policy 2013, 7,760 km of state highways and major district roads are currently \nmaintained by 72 output- and performance-based road asset maintenance contracts. \n                                                 \n5  Government of India, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. 2018.

Since 2008, ADB has provided four \nloans, amounting to $1.43 billion, to upgrade about 1,453 km of state highways and to construct \na new bridge over the Ganga River near Patna.7 During the implementation of previous loans, the \nBSRDCL has gradually built institutional capacity, which is now reasonably robust. Previous loans \nhave performed well, except for time overruns related to land acquisition and termination of large \ncontracts. In the present proposal, these risks are mitigated since land acquisition is not significant \nand the size of contracts will be limited to an estimated $40 million. Advance contracting actions \nare under way for both works and supervision consultant contracts. With these measures, it is \nanticipated that the works can proceed without substantive delays. \n \n11.  Project objectives. While the government has been progressively improving carriageway \nwidths of state highways using budgetary and multilateral financing, about 35% of these roads \nare yet to meet the minimum two-lane standard.8 The present proposal seeks to advance this \ngovernment program to upgrade all state highways to at least standard two-lane widths and \nimprove road safety. The roads selected in this project are from the overall master plan, based \non (i) development priorities of the government, (ii) key infrastructure roads for agriculture- and \nindustry-based activities, and (iii) the readiness to implement. The project roads selected are \nspread across Bihar\u2019s rural areas that lack reliable road connectivity, resulting in limited access \nto  health  and  educational  institutions,  commercial  facilities,  and  government  development \nagencies. The project will also establish a state institution, proposed by the RCD, to improve \ninstitutional capacity at a technical level and in a sustained manner. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impact: road transport accessibility in the state of \nBihar improved (footnote 1). The project will have the following outcome: transport efficiency and \nsafety on selected state highways in Bihar improved.9 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  Output 1: State highways widened and upgraded. About 230 km of state highways will \nbe widened and upgraded to all-weather standards with road safety features. \n  \n14.  Output 2: Bihar Road Research Institute established. The Bihar Road Research \nInstitute  (BRRI)  in  Patna  will  be  established  to  institutionalize  and  sustain  technical  and \nmanagement capacity of road agency staff. The BRRI will be operated and staffed by the RCD. \n \n15.  Value added by ADB assistance. The project seeks to continue ADB engagement with \nthe road subsector in the state. The project is consistent with the strategic objective set out in the \ncountry partnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022 on the development of the state core network \nof lagging states, and with the transport sector objective of increased, more efficient, and \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2008.

For this project, the establishment of a state institution, the BRRI, is proposed \nto institutionalize and sustain technical and management capacity over time. The BRRI would \nfocus on areas such as industrial waste utilization in road construction, ground improvements, \nenvironmental pollution, road traffic safety, and road assets performance monitoring. The project \nwill include assistance in constructing facilities to house the BRRI, establishing its operations by \nbuilding capacity in areas mentioned above, and providing institutional support by preparing the \noperational plan. The RCD will fund the staffing and operations of the BRRI. Key staff of the BRRI \nwill consist of a chief engineer, two superintending engineers, three executive engineers, and four \nassistant engineers. The RCD will also provide administrative and support staff. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n16.  The project is estimated to cost $304 million (Table 2). \n \n17.  ADB will finance from its ordinary capital resources a part of the project costs for consulting \nservices and goods, service and civil works contracts, as well as recurrent costs and taxes, as \nrelevant. The project will be implemented over a 4-year period, commencing in November 2018. \nDetailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier are included in the project \nadministration manual (PAM).11 \n \nTable 2: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n23.  The BSRDCL\u2019s consultants prepared detailed design documents for the proposed roads \nfor ADB financing, incorporating ADB requirements of economic, social, and environmental \nstudies into the consultants\u2019 terms of reference. The economic assessment and due diligence on \nenvironmental and social safeguards were conducted to ensure that the design complies with \nADB requirements. The engineering designs were prepared to avoid land acquisition, minimize \nsocial and environmental impacts, incorporate road safety, and mitigate identified climate change \nrisks, particularly extreme flooding. To mitigate climate change risks, adaptation will include \nraising embankment heights, increasing vent of culverts, improving drains, and increasing the \nheight of bridges. In addition, advance actions were taken to ensure that construction can start \nearly. These measures to improve project readiness will facilitate faster project implementation. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  The economic assessment for the five project roads was carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (2017).13 The major benefits are savings \nin vehicle operating costs and passenger travel time. The estimated economic internal rates of \nreturn (EIRR) range from 11.3% to 20.4% and are averaged at 16.4%. The sensitivity analysis \nindicates that the project has an EIRR above 9.0%. If a 20.0% cost increase was combined with a \n20.0% benefit reduction, the EIRR would still be 10.8% for the whole project. Thus, the proposed \nimprovements are economically viable. The sensitivity analysis also showed that the EIRR was \nmore sensitive to changes in economic benefits. For this reason, the state government needs to \npay attention to socioeconomic development of the project area, fostering local transport services, \nand increasing incomes for rural road users. In terms of financial sustainability, the government \nwill not adopt toll collection during operation. The annual average incremental recurrent costs \nassociated with the project are estimated to be about 1.0% of the maintenance budget of the RCD, \nand it is thus reasonable to expect that the budget allocated will be sufficient to meet the \nmaintenance costs. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  Policy, legal, and institutional capacity. The BSRDCL was incorporated on 20 April \n2009 under the Companies Act of 1956 and is a wholly owned company of the Government of \nBihar, established to develop, execute, manage, and maintain all types of roads, highways, and \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "7 \nbridges. The BSRDCL has an 11-member board of directors and is headed by a managing \ndirector, with about 114 staff members. The corporate structure was developed along good-\npractice principles, and the organization is developing a good understanding of business practices \nand commercial ability and aims to provide good standards with regard to safety, performance, \nand user satisfaction and to operate under sound ethical standards. \n \n26.  Financial management. The financial management assessment was conducted in May \n2018 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects \nand the Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note.14 The financial management assessment \nconsidered the capacity of the BSRDCL, including funds flow arrangements, staffing, accounting \nand financial reporting systems, financial information systems, and internal and external auditing \narrangements. The BSRDCL is experienced and familiar with managing ADB-financed projects. \nThe overall financial management arrangements are considered satisfactory, and the overall risk \nis moderate, mainly because the position of the chief account officer is still vacant. The BSRDCL \nwill fill this position before January 2019. \n \n27.  Procurement. The project procurement risk is rated low. BSRDCL has substantive prior \nexperience with ADB procurement, including large contracts using international advertisement, \nsuch as the New Ganga Bridge. For this project, the civil works packages will be via national \nadvertisement due to the smaller contract value. BSRDCL has also procured concessionaires \nunder PPP contracts, including operate-maintain-and-transfer type contracts, so its procurement \nexperience is extensive. Contracts under the project will use ADB standard bidding documents.  \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government of India, the Government of Bihar, and the BSRDCL. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n29.  Poverty reduction and social impact. Households along project roads were surveyed \nand indicated that poor road conditions were preventing safe and reliable travel, especially at \nnight and during bad weather. Communities indicated that positive benefits of the project roads \nwill include (i) improved access to health and education facilities, (ii) faster access to market \nplaces, (iii) increased job opportunities, and (iv) better public and private transport options. An \nefficient road network linking villages, towns, and cities will provide stronger links between rural \ncommunities and urban hubs. Road development encourages other development initiatives, \nwhich together considerably stimulate economic growth. The improvements will significantly \nimprove the socioeconomic situation and enhance poverty reduction in the beneficiary districts \nand the state. Project roads will directly pass through 197 villages located in six districts. \n \n30.  Gender and development. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. A \ngender action plan (GAP) has been prepared. Inequalities between men and women in Bihar are \nmost obvious in (i) health and education, (ii) economic development, (iii) violence against women, \n(iv) participation in public life and policy making, and (v) social attitudes and gender stereotyping. \nGender differentials adversely affect women more than men. Most women in the project area are \nhomemakers, as rural women rarely work outside the home unless they are very poor. During \ngender assessment of the five roads\u2014when 300 women were interviewed and 30 women-specific \nfocus group discussions were conducted\u2014women indicated that improved road conditions would \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2015.

Shorter travel times will allow more time for productive activities, health \ncare, and self-development. However, road construction and improvements may also lead to \npotential negative impacts such as the spread of sexually transmitted infections, human trafficking, \nand road safety issues. \n \n31.  Based on findings from consultations with the local community, including women and the \nexecuting  agency,  practical  and  implementable  gender  mainstreaming  activities  have  been \nincorporated into the project. Some key activities include (i) raising awareness among community \nmembers and contractors\u2019 personnel on sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, \nhealth and hygiene, and human trafficking; (ii) incorporating specific needs of vulnerable users, \ne.g., the elderly, women, children, and disabled people, in the design and modification of roads; \n(iii) community participation in road safety awareness campaigns; and (iv) livelihood skills training \nfor affected communities, including women, to receive micro enterprise development support. \n \n32.  In output 2, which covers the establishment of the BRRI, the GAP envisages (i) 20% of \nstaff assigned to the BRRI are to be women; and (ii) impact assessment of skills training and \nincome-generation activities, and various awareness campaigns to be completed. In addition, the \nBSRDCL  staff  will  be  oriented  to  improve  gender-sensitive  designs,  measures,  and \nimplementation consistent with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development.15 \n \n33.  The project also provides for a robust mechanism and adequate arrangements to ensure \nregular implementation, monitoring, and reporting of gender mainstreaming activities based on \nsex-disaggregated data collection. A gender specialist consultant will be engaged to implement \nthe GAP, supported by a nongovernment organization. A gender focal officer in the BSRDCL is \nassigned to ensure GAP implementation and provide overall supervision and coordination with \nother government departments, as needed. Budgetary provision to implement the GAP has been kept  \nas component A of the project cost, which covers land acquisition, resettlement, and rehabilitation. \n \n34.  Labor. Provisions in the bidding documents for the civil works contractors, among others, \nare to (i) ensure that all applicable labor laws are complied with, including the prohibition against \nemploying children in construction; (ii) encourage the employment of the poor, particularly women; \nand (iii) ensure that wages for men and women are equal for work of equal value. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.16 \n \n36.  Environment (category B). The project involves improvement of five existing state \nhighways totaling about 230 km from single or intermediate lanes to two lanes with paved \nshoulders. No significant, irreversible environmental impacts are anticipated and none of the \nroads  are  located  inside  or  near  protected  or  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  An  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) has been prepared and was disclosed on the ADB website. \nAnticipated  environmental  impacts  from  the  project  entail  typical  issues  related  to  road \nconstruction,  such  as  removal  of  trees,  generation  of  dust,  noise,  exhaust,  waste  from \nconstruction and worker camps, water contamination, occupational health and safety, slope \nfailures, erosion, and siltation. Mitigation measures to address all of these have been included in \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2003. Policy on Gender and Development. Manila. \n16  ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "9 \nthe environmental management plan, which is part of the bid documents, and will be required to \nbe implemented by the contractor. Meaningful consultations have been held with affected persons \nand other key stakeholders, such as forestry officials, while preparing the IEE. Concerns of \naffected people and stakeholders will continue to be addressed during project implementation \nthrough the grievance redress mechanism proposed in the IEE. \n \n37.  The general manager of the BSRDCL will be responsible for the overall implementation of \nsafeguards under the project. At the project implementation unit (PIU) level, the deputy general \nmanager of each of the four PIUs will serve as the focal person for environment and social \nsafeguards supported by two CSC firms which will have environment specialists in their team. \nThe civil works contractors will implement the environmental management plan and will include \nenvironment,  health,  and  safety  officers  in  their  teams.  Supervision  and  monitoring  of  the \ncontractor will be conducted by the CSC. An initial coordination-cum-training workshop will be \norganized by the BSRDCL to clarify the roles and responsibilities of each party for complying with \nenvironment safeguard requirements.  \n \n38.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). The project was developed with a commitment \nto minimize land acquisition through appropriate technical design. While road widening from \nsingle lane to two lanes will occur within existing rights-of-way, some land acquisition cannot be \navoided where alignments will be improved for safety reasons. A 100% census of affected \nhouseholds was conducted based on the detailed design. Five resettlement plans and a due \ndiligence report were prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and the \npolicies and regulations of the governments of India and Bihar. \n \n39.  The project will require 10.74 hectares (ha) of land consisting of 8.23 ha of private land \nand 2.51 ha of government land (including 2.00 ha of vacant land owned by the BSRDCL to be \nused for the BRRI building). The total number of affected households are 4,021 (26,538 people), \nof which 439 are titled households and 3,582 are nontitled households (including sharecroppers, \ntenants, and employees). A total of 4,818 private and community structures will be affected by \nland acquisition and clearing of informal settler structures from the government-owned right-of-\nway.  Some  1,650  households  will  be  physically  displaced  and  2,371  will  be  economically \ndisplaced. About 3,618 households will lose more than 50% of their structure and may need to \nrelocate. The entitlement matrix provides for specific compensation and resettlement assistance \nfor the types of losses caused by the project. Compensation for lost assets will be paid based on \nreplacement cost. Resettlement assistance for lost income and livelihoods will be provided to \ntitleholders and nontitleholders alike, with special measures available to vulnerable households. \nResettlement plans have been disclosed on the ADB and BSRDCL websites, and to affected \ncommunities through local government offices. The existing Environment, Social Development, \nand Resettlement Cell of the BSRDCL will implement this project. The BSRDCL will engage an \nexternal expert to advise on involuntary resettlement safeguard compliance. The total cost of \nresettlement is estimated at $23 million. \n \n40.  Indigenous peoples (category C). During project preparation, social assessment noted \nthat the scheduled tribes live in the project area as individual households and not as indigenous \npeoples communities with distinct practices and collective attachment to land. The assessment \nindicates that scheduled tribe households are well integrated in the general population and will \nnot require indigenous peoples safeguards under the project. One scheduled tribe household will \nbe affected by land acquisition along State Highway 58. The resettlement plan provides that the \nhousehold will receive additional compensation as a vulnerable affected household, in addition to \ncompensation at replacement cost, transition allowances, and income restoration. \n \n ", "10 \nF.
