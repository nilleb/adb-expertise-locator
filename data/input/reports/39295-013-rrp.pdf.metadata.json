Building upon the successful \nimplementation  of  earlier  phases,2 the  project  will  provide  investment  funds  to  pourashavas \nbased on their governance performance. Under the project, towns with high growth potential will \nbe developed in an integrated and holistic way, both in terms of governance and infrastructure, \nwith an aim of making them model towns of the country. In addition to the focused interventions \nto these towns, application of governance performance criteria linked  to fund allocation will be \nrolled out to all class-A pourashavas3 in the country. 4 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nUrbanization. Out of the total population of about 150 million, the urban population has \ngrown rapidly, from 20% in 1991 to 28% (42 million) in 2011. The current annual urban growth \nrate is 3.1%, which is more than double the 1.1% annual growth rate of the entire population.5 \nAt  existing  growth  rates,  the  country\u2019s  urban  population  will  reach  63  million,  or  36%  of  the \npopulation,  by  2025.6 Rapid  urbanization  is  widening  the  deficit  in  infrastructure  and  services. \nAlthough  urban  poverty  was  reduced  to  21.3%  in  2010, 7  many  of  the  urban  poor  live  in \nsubstandard housing conditions with poor infrastructure, often in disaster-prone areas. \n \nUrban  governance.  Pourashavas  typically  have  been  characterized  by  inadequate \n4. \ngovernance  and  lack  of  community  participation  in  the  planning,  implementation,  and \nmanagement  of  projects  and  programs.  There  have  been  limited  incentives  to  improve \ngovernance  in  areas  such  as  accountability  and  transparency,  promotion  of  gender  equity, \npoverty reduction, and financial management and sustainability. However, with the introduction \nof  a  performance-based  fund  allocation  strategy  through  the  urban  governance  improvement \naction  program  (UGIAP)  in  the  Urban  Governance  and  Infrastructure  Improvement  (Sector) \nProject (UGIIP) funded by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  pourashavas  supported  under \nthe  UGIIP  significantly  improved  their  governance  (footnote  2).  Major  achievements  under  the \nUGIIP include (i) establishment of town-level coordination committees (TLCCs) and ward-level \ncoordination  committees  (WLCCs),  which  are  key  vehicles  for  ensuring  citizens\u2019  participation \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2002.

There  are  three  classes;  A,  B,  and  C,  according  to  the \nlevel of own-source annual revenues, with A being the highest, although the rules are not strictly followed. There \nare 126 class A pourashavas.   \n\n5  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2012. Population and Housing Census.

Pourashavas  are  struggling  to  provide  their  citizens  with  key \n5. \nservices  including  drinking  water  supply  and  sanitation,  roads,  solid  waste  management, \ndrainage systems, and other municipal services such as kitchen markets, street lights, and bus \nterminals. Although drinking water supply coverage reached 86% in urban areas in 2012 (85% \nfor the whole country), access to piped water supply in household premises is provided to only \n32%  of the  urban  population,  requiring significant  improvement  in service levels.9 Only  55%  of \nthe  urban  population  had  access  to  improved  sanitation  facilities  in  2012  (57%  for  the  whole \ncountry), which is lower than the average in South Asia. The situation is even more serious in \nslums, as access to sanitation is highly correlated with wealth. Solid waste management is not \nsystematic  and  wastes  are  often  dumped  in  open  areas,  creating  public  health  risks.  Many \nurban roads are dilapidated because of increasing traffic and lack of maintenance. Drainage is \nunderdeveloped  and  poorly  maintained, \nfrequent  waterlogging.  Although \nimprovements have been made through earlier projects, including the UGIIP, most pourashavas \nstill need significant investment support to improve their service delivery.  \n \n6. \nModel  towns  development.  The  two  largest  cities\u2014Dhaka  and  Chittagong\u2014account \nfor  nearly  50%  of  the  urban  population  in  Bangladesh.  To  avoid  further  congestion  in  these \nlargest cities and reduce regional disparities, it is essential to develop livable urban centers with \ngood municipal governance and which are equipped with adequate infrastructure and services, \nwhich  will  trigger  local  economic  development.  In  its  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan  (2011\u20132015)  the \ngovernment thus prioritizes (i) improving city governance, (ii) promoting balanced development \nof  urban  centers,  and  (iii)  mobilizing  urban  resource.10 In  line  with  this  policy  direction,  the \nproject will support 30 pourashavas selected on the basis of (i) population, (ii) population growth \nbetween 2001 and 2011, (iii) municipal own-source revenue target, and (iv) population density, \nwith a priority on district headquarters towns.11 Being major administrative, trade, and economic \ncenters and serving as transportation and distribution hubs, district headquarters towns can play \nan important role for balanced development. Thirty towns have a total population of 2.2 million, \nincluding 20 district headquarters towns. The project intends to develop these towns into model \ntowns of the country, featuring (i) improved municipal service delivery, with at least 95% water \nsupply and sanitation coverage including continuous piped water supply systems in core urban \nareas  (towards  100%  metered  connections  with volumetric tariff structure),  regular  solid  waste \ncollection in core urban areas and safe disposal at a designated site, and core urban areas free \nfrom waterlogging; (ii) financial sustainability, with adequate operation and maintenance (O&M) \nfunding  and  debt  servicing  (if  any)  fully  recovered  by  own-source  revenue;  (iii)  citizen \nparticipation,  accountability,  inclusiveness,  and  transparency,  with  pourashava  development \nplans, urban master plans, GAPs, poverty reduction action plans, and annual budget developed \nthrough  consultation  and  disclosed  to  the  public;  and  (iv)  urban  development  control,  with \nbuildings constructed in accordance with the approved plan.  \n \n\n                                                \n8  ADB.  2012.

Sixth Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015). Dhaka. \n11 Pourashavas  that  have  received  or  will  receive  substantial  investment  support  from  other  projects  are  excluded. \nSeveral pourashavas are included based on special considerations such as strategic importance to the country\u2019s \ndevelopment and support to less-developed regions.   \n\n\fLessons.  Lessons  from  similar  projects  suggest  that  (i)  governance-led  infrastructure \n7. \nimprovement  is  indeed possible  and  desirable,  (ii)  use  of  the  sector  lending  modality  is  highly \nappropriate  for  performance-based  fund  allocation  through  a  phased  approach,  and  (iii)  good \nquality  and  front-loading  capacity  building  support  is  required  for  pourashavas. 12 Thus,  the \nproject  adopts  the  sector  lending  modality,13 and  capacity  building  support  has  been  provided \nduring  project  preparation  and  will  be  continued  during  implementation.  The  allocation  of  less \nthan $3 million to each pourashava for infrastructure improvement in earlier projects was grossly \ninadequate  to  meet  the  demand  for  improved  services.  The  preselected  pourashavas  will \nreceive more substantive investment funding upon fulfilling the UGIAP requirements, depending \nupon actual needs and within their capacity. The project will introduce performance-based fund \nallocation to all class A pourashavas to provide incentive for governance reform. \n \n8. \nThe project is fully consistent with ADB\u2019s urban operational plan and Bangladesh country \npartnership  strategy \ninclusiveness,  environmental \nsustainability,  and  competitiveness\u2014the  three  pillars  of  the  urban  operational  plan.  The  urban \nsector is one of the six priority sectors in the CPS, and the project will also address key thematic \ndrivers of the CPS including good governance, capacity development, and gender equity.   \n \nB. \n\n(CPS). 14  The  project  will  address \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe impact will be an improved living environment in project towns. The outcome will be \nimproved municipal service delivery and urban governance in project towns. Thirty preselected \ntowns will be supported in an integrated manner under the project.   \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nOutput  1:  Municipal  infrastructure  improved  and  made  gender  and  climate \nresponsive. The  project  will  provide  funding to  pourashavas  through  two windows. Window  A \nwill  focus  on  the  30  preselected  towns,  and  the  fund  for  infrastructure  improvements  will  be \nmade  available  in  phases  upon  fulfillment  of  three  phases  of  the  UGIAP  (para.  12).  The \nmaximum  amount  that  each  pourashava  will  receive  will  mainly  depend  on  its  population.15 \nOnce the entry criteria are fulfilled, the first set of priority subprojects amounting to 20%\u201325% of \nthe  ceiling  will  be  supported  (phase  1).  Upon  substantial  progress  of  such  investments  and \nfulfillment of intermediate criteria, additional priority investment subprojects amounting to about \n60% of the ceiling will be implemented (phase 2). Meeting the advanced criteria and progress of \nearlier  subprojects  will  make  these  pourashavas  eligible  for  additional  investment  support \namounting  to  15%\u201320%  of  the  ceiling  (phase  3).  This  phased  approach,  which  has  proven \neffective  in  earlier  projects,  will  ensure  motivation  for  continued  governance  reform  while \ncreating  tangible  development  impacts  in  an  integrated  and  holistic  manner.  In  addition,  the \nperformance-based fund allocation will be rolled out to all class A  pourashavas under Window \nB,  where  class  B  and  C  pourashavas  can  also  voluntarily  participate.  Funding  of  about  $1 \nmillion for infrastructure improvement will be provided to each of about the top 10 pourashavas \nin the governance performance assessment, which will be conducted twice during the project. \n\n                                                \n12 ADB. 2012.

Although the selection of subprojects will generally follow the priorities set \nby each pourashava, the project will focus on key infrastructure such as roads, drainage, water \nsupply  and  sanitation  (including  septage  management),  solid  waste  management,  and  slum \nimprovements.  Other  municipal  facilities  such  as  kitchen  markets  and  bus  terminals  will  be \nsupported if O&M arrangements are clearly planned. Subprojects under phase 1 will not include \nrevenue-generating  subprojects,  other  than  small-scale  water  supply  subprojects  (e.g., \nrehabilitation of existing systems). Subprojects implemented in each phase are stand-alone so \nas  to  avoid  the  risk  of  pourashavas  not  proceeding  to  the  next  phase  because  of  poor \ngovernance  performance.  The  project  will  support  climate-responsive  development  through \nmeasures such as strengthening urban drainage systems that will accommodate additional run-\noff due to increased rainfall intensity, and minimizing methane gas generation from landfill sites \nby  promoting  waste  segregation  at  source  and  organic  waste  composting.  Infrastructure  to  be \nimproved will be also gender-responsive by taking into account women\u2019s needs in the design. \n \n12. \nOutput  2:  Improved  capacity  of  pourashavas  in  urban  service  delivery,  planning, \nand  financial  management.  The implementation of the UGIAP will strengthen the capacity of \npourashavas  in  the  areas  of  (i)  citizen  awareness  and  participation,  (ii)  urban  planning,  (iii) \ngender equality and social inclusion, (iv) local resource mobilization, (v) financial management \nand  accountability,  (vi)  administrative  transparency,  and  (vii)  provision  of  essential  services.16 \nPourashavas will need to fulfill more complex and stringent requirements when moving from the \nentry  criteria  to  intermediate  and  advanced  criteria.  Intensive  support  will  be  provided  to  the \nWindow A pourashavas by the governance improvement and capacity development consultants \nengaged  under  the  loan.  If  the  criteria  are  not  fulfilled  within  the  stipulated  time  frame, \npourashavas will lose entitlement to proceed to the next phase of infrastructure improvement. A \nseparate  set  of  performance  criteria  using  simple,  objective,  and  measurable  governance \nindicators  has  been  prepared  as  the  UGIAP  under  Window  B.  This  will  scale-up  urban \ngovernance reforms in the country. \n \n13. \nOutput 3: Project management and administration system in place. Support will be \nprovided  for  smooth  and  effective  project  implementation  and  operation  by  the  central \ngovernment  and  project  pourashavas.  The  project  management  office  (PMO)  in  the  Local \nGovernment Engineering Department (LGED), with staff from the LGED and the Department of \nPublic Health Engineering (DPHE), will manage overall project implementation, assisted by the \nmanagement,  design,  and  supervision  (MDS)  consultants  and  individual  consultants.  The \nproject  implementation  units  (PIUs)  in  each  project  pourashava  will  be  responsible  for \ninfrastructure  and  governance  improvement,  assisted  by  the  governance  improvement  and \ncapacity development and MDS consultants. \n \nD. \n \n14. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $236.0 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans   \n\n \n\n                                                \n16 The  UGIAP  is  detailed  in  the  project  administration  manual  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\nMunicipal infrastructure improvement  \nCapacity improvement of pourashavas (municipalities) \nProject management and administration \n                                                                     Subtotal (A) \n\nBase Costb \n1.  \n2.  \n3.  \n \nContingenciesc \nFinancing Charges During Implementationd \n\nItem \nA.  \n \n \n \n \nB.  \nC.  \n                                                                                               Total (A+B+C) \na  Includes taxes and duties of $11.8 million to be financed from government resources. \nb  In end-2013 prices. \nc  Physical contingencies computed at 8% for civil works, equipment, consulting services, and recurrent costs.

The government will provide $68.9 million equivalent as a \ngrant to cover (i) part of the infrastructure subproject costs in pourashavas, (ii) land acquisition \nand resettlement, (iii) part of the incremental recurrent staff costs, and (iv) taxes and duties. The \ngovernment has also requested OFID to finance a part of civil works with a loan of $40 million. \nThe  OFID  loan,  to  be  partially  administered  by  ADB,  will  have  a  maturity  of  20  years  with  a \ngrace  period  of  5  years,  and  carry  interest  of  1.5%  per  annum  and  a  service  charge  of  1.0%. \nProject pourashavas will provide $2.1 million equivalent to cover part of the land acquisition and \nresettlement costs. \n \n16. \nThe  financing  plan  is  in  Table  2.  Part  of  the  funds  provided  by  ADB  and  OFID  will  be \nrelent to the project pourashavas. Revenue-generating subprojects, including water supply, bus \nand truck terminals, and kitchen  markets, will be financed by a combination of grant and loan, \nwith a grant\u2013loan ratio satisfactory to ADB. The subloan will have an interest rate of 6% for 20 \nyears,  including  a  5-year  grace  period,  and  will  be  denominated  in  local  currency.  The \ngovernment will bear the foreign exchange risk in repayment to ADB. Other subprojects will be \nfunded 100% by grant. \n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nAmount  \n($ million) \n \n125.0 \n40.0 \n68.9 \n2.1 \n236.0 \n\nShare of Total  \n(%) \n \n53.0 \n16.9 \n29.2 \n0.9 \n100.0 \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \n\nSpecial Funds resources (loan) \n\nOPEC Fund for International Development (loan) \nGovernment (grant) \nPourashavas (municipalities) \nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.   \n\n \nImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n\nThe  LGED  and  DPHE  will  be  the  executing  agencies,  and  project  pourashavas  will  be \n17. \nthe implementing agencies.

The same approach will \nbe followed for subprojects to be prepared during project implementation in accordance with the \nsubproject  selection  and  design  criteria. 19  To  strengthen  urban  climate  resilience,  urban \ndrainage  designs  will  accommodate  additional  flow  caused  by  more  intense  rainfall  due  to \nclimate change, and key facilities such as water treatment plants and production tubewells will \nbe built with freeboard above the highest recorded flood level.20 \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic  analysis.  The  project  will  significantly  improve  the  living  environment  in \n19. \nproject  pourashavas.  The  expected  economic  benefits  consist  of  (i)  reduced  vehicle  operating \ncosts and travel time cost savings for roads; (ii) reduced damage to properties due to flooding; \n(iii) health benefits, resource savings from fetching water from nonpiped sources, and consumer \nsatisfaction  for  water  supply,  quantified  by  the  beneficiaries\u2019  willingness  to  pay;  and  (iv) \nproductivity  gains  and  avoided  medical  costs  for  solid  waste  management.  The  results  of  the \neconomic  and  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  subprojects  show  that  the  proposed  subprojects  are \neconomically viable. Their base economic internal rates of return range from 12.03% to 27.86%, \nabove the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12.00%. The sensitivity analysis indicates that \nthe proposed subprojects are most sensitive generally to a reduction in benefits. These results, \nhowever, are most likely underestimated since the subprojects have benefits that are not easily \nquantifiable  and  not  accounted  for  in  the  analysis.  Subprojects  to  be  prepared  during \nimplementation will need to meet the economic and financial criteria (footnote 19). \n \n\n                                                \n19 The subproject selection and design criteria are detailed in the project administration manual (accessible from the \n\nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n20  Project  Climate  Risk  Assessment  and  Management  Report  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fFinancial  analysis.  Financial  analysis  was  conducted  in  three  sample  towns  for \n20. \nsubprojects  with  a  cost-recovery  objective  by  estimating  the  incremental  costs  and  revenues \nover the project life. Financial internal rates of return for subprojects compare favorably with the \nweighted average cost of capital, estimated at 4.60%. Financial internal rates of return for water \nsupply  range  from  an  estimated  4.67%  to  6.75%  and  are  also  favorable  for  market \ndevelopment, community centers, and bus and truck terminals. Sensitivity analysis confirms that \nthe  subprojects  are  robust.  For  nonrevenue-generating  subprojects,  the  analysis  focuses  on \nsample towns\u2019 financial capacity to meet and sustain recurrent O&M costs of each subproject. \nThe  overall  financial  position  of  each  sample  town  is  projected  reflecting  incremental  revenue \nand  expenditures  and  debt  service.  The  projected  financial  position  confirms  that,  with  some \ngovernment  subsidy,  sample  towns  have  the  financial  capacity  to  meet  O&M  costs  and  other \nrequirements  to  sustain  infrastructure  and service  delivery  for  all  subprojects  supported  under \nthe project. \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\n21. \nBangladesh\u2019s overall governance has improved with key governance and anticorruption \nreforms, including the constitution of the independent Anti-Corruption Commission in 2004 and \nthe enactment of the Right to Information Act in 2009, the Whistleblower Protection Act in 2011, \nand the Money Laundering Prevention Act in 2012. A comprehensive national integrity strategy \nwas adopted in 2012 to address corruption holistically and strengthen governance institutions in \na  phased  manner.  The  financial  management  assessment  of  the  LGED,  DPHE,  and  sample \npourashavas indicated that, with the support of a dedicated consultant in financial management \nin  the  PMO  and  a  dedicated  accountant  in  each  PIU,  there  will  be  adequate  financial \nmanagement  capabilities  and  support  for  implementing  the  project.  The  LGED  has  proven \nexperience  in  procuring  goods,  works,  and  consulting  services  in  accordance  with  ADB \nprocedures  and  requirements.  Since  project  pourashavas  have  limited  experience  in  ADB-\nfinanced  projects,  PIUs  will  be  supported  by  the  PMO  and  procurement  specialists  in  MDS  in \nbid  document  preparation  and  evaluation.  This  will  be  supplemented  by  regular  training  on \nprocurement  and  accounting  for  PIU  and  other  relevant  staff.  Other  measures  to  ensure \ntransparency include the presentation of detailed information on procurement at public meetings \nto supplement web-based disclosure. \n \n22. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the project administration manual (footnote 17). \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n23. \nKey  social  issues  that  affect  the  poor  and  marginalized  groups  at  pourashava  level \ninclude weak participation and representation in pourashava governance and lack of access to \nbasic  urban  services. The  project  will  enhance  inclusiveness  of  poor  and  marginalized  groups \nby  ensuring  their  sufficient  representation  in  TLCCs  and  WLCCs,  preparation  of  a  poverty \nreduction  action  plan  by  each  pourashava,  formation  of  slum  improvement  committees,  and \nbasic  service  improvement  in  slums.  The  implementation  of  poverty  reduction  action  plans, \nincluding pourashavas\u2019 own budget allocation, will be monitored through the implementation of \nthe UGIAP. \n \nGender.  The  project  is  classified  as  having  a  gender  equity  theme.  The  project  will \n24. \ncontribute to  enhancing women\u2019s  decision-making capacity  in  pourashavas  and  increasing the \nfemale  focus  of  service  delivery  and  infrastructure  at  all  levels  of  pourashavas.  More \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fspecifically,  TLCCs  and  WLCCs  will  have  sufficient  female  representation  to  ensure  women\u2019s \nparticipation in pourashava governance. Developing water supply and sanitation will reduce the \nburden  on  women,  who  traditionally  collect  water  and  manage  sanitation.  Each  pourashava \nunder  Window  A  will  develop  a  town-specific  GAP  based  on  the  project\u2019s  GAP,  and  their \nimplementation including budget allocation will be monitored through the implementation of the \nUGIAP. Resources are allocated for implementation and monitoring of the project\u2019s GAP.21 \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\n25. \nEnvironmental  safeguards.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  environmental \nsafeguards.  Five  draft  initial  environmental  examinations  were  prepared  for  representative \ninfrastructure  investments  including  water  supply,  solid  waste  management,  markets,  roads, \nand  drainage  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  government \nlaws.  Subprojects  are  located  outside  sensitive  and  protected  areas,  and  any  construction \nimpacts will be mitigated through implementation of environmental management plans included \nin contract documents. Significant environmental impacts are not foreseen in future subprojects, \nwhich will be guided by environmental subproject selection criteria outlined in the environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  and  monitored  as  part  of  the  semiannual  safeguards \nmonitoring report. Environmental safeguard implementation capacity of the executing agencies \nis  sufficient  from  past  UGIIP  projects,  and  will  be  supported  by  consultants  for  carrying  out \nenvironment-related tasks. \n \n26. \nSocial  safeguards.  The  project  is  categorized  B  for  involuntary  resettlement.  No \npermanent land acquisition or physical displacement is identified from three sample towns. The \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts identified for phase 1 of the sample towns are mostly from the \nroad and drainage subprojects. The main impacts come from 73 semipermanent and permanent \nstructures,  most  of  which  are  shops  or  business  stalls.  Among  the  71  shop  owners  whose \nlivelihood  will  be  affected by  the  subprojects,  one will  have to move out permanently  from  the \ncurrent  location  and  the  remaining  70  will  only  experience  temporary  relocation.  Three  draft \nresettlement  plans  were  prepared  in  consultation  with  the  affected  people  to  mitigate  the \nimpacts.22 The draft resettlement plans will be updated and finalized during detailed engineering \ndesign  of  subprojects.  A  resettlement  framework  was  prepared  to  provide  guidance  for  other \nsubprojects  or  in  the  event  of  unidentified  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  during  the  project \nimplementation period. The project is categorized C for indigenous peoples impacts in the three \nsample  towns.  An  indigenous  peoples  planning  framework  was  prepared  to  provide  guidance \nand appropriate mitigation measures to the ethnic minority (Adivasi) that may be located in other \ntowns  if  their  livelihood  and  dignity  are  affected  by  the  project  activities. 23  A  stand-alone \nindigenous peoples plan document will be prepared following the  indigenous peoples planning \nframework  when  the  impacts  are  significant,  or  else  the  plans  can  be  incorporated  into \nresettlement plans as specific actions for the affected communities and/or peoples. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n\n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 As risks can be mitigated to a managerial \nlevel, the intended benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n                                                \n21 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n22  Resettlement Plan: Lalmonirhat Phase 1, Resettlement Plan: Magura Phase 1, and Resettlement Plan: Naogaon \n\nPhase 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n23 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nBudget allocation is \ninsufficient to meet \nthe increased \ndemand for O&M of \nfacilities built by the \nproject \n\nThe UGIAP requires each pourashava (municipality) to (i) improve property tax \ncollection efficiency to 70% and increase the collection of indirect taxes, fees, \nrentals, and lease charges by 5% per annum, under the intermediate criteria; and \n(ii) improve the same to 85% and increase by at least official inflation rate per \nannum, under the advanced criteria. Pourashavas that do not meet the \nrequirements will not proceed to the next phase of physical investments. It also \nrequires each pourashava to prepare O&M plans including budget provision. \nConsultants will support pourashavas in achieving the above criteria, as well as \nraise awareness of the public regarding payment of taxes and other charges. \nAdvanced action to be taken by pourashavas to begin land acquisition \nimmediately after DPP approval. Progress will be closely monitored by the PMO \nand ADB. Subprojects that require land acquisition will not be selected in phase \n1.   \nCapacity building in financial management, internal auditing, and ADB financial \nmanagement requirements will be provided to staff of PMO and PIUs to ensure \nrobust and transparent project financial management. All PIU subaccounts will \nbe audited every year. Governance criterion requires audit reports by the \nstanding committee to be presented to TLCC and pourashava council and sent \nto PMO within 3 months from the end of each fiscal year.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank,  DPP = development project proforma, O&M  = operation and maintenance, PIU = \nproject implementation unit, PMO = project management office, TLCC = town-level coordination committee, UGIAP = \nurban governance improvement action program. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n\nProlonged process for \nland acquisition will \ncause implementation \ndelay \nLimited financial \nmanagement capacity \nin pourashavas will \nlead to improper \nfinancial management \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n28. \nThe  government  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration  manual  and  loan  documents.
