These changes form a part of the overall\neconomic policy reform to move to a market-based system,\nwith  an  expanded  role  for  the  private  sector,  in  order  to\nincrease  growth  and  reduce  debt.  The  Program  has  been\ndesigned  to  assist  the  Government  in  addressing  key\nconstraints in the agriculture sector regarding productivity and\nprofitability with an emphasis on small and marginal farmers\nand on private sector investors and exporters. It is expected\nthat the Program will increase agricultural growth, investment,\nexports,  and  rural  employment,  and  reduce  rural  poverty.\nBeneficiaries will be provided with opportunities to increase\ntheir crop yields, productivity, incomes, and employment and\nto improve their quality of life through the promotion of efficient\ncommodity markets and support services. The Program will\ncomplement  the  Government's  macroeconomic  reforms,\nwhich are supported by the World Bank and the International\nMonetary Fund.\nThe Program Rationale Despite the progress made in liberalizing agricultural markets\nand  prices  in  recent  years,  direct  intervention  by  the\nGovernment in agricultural markets remains excessive. This\nhas led to low producer prices and low farm profitability. The\nproductivity of most crops is low, and research and extension\nsystems and institutions are outdated and weak. These have\naffected both the upstream linkages for farm inputs such as\nseeds,  fertilizers,  and  machinery  and  the  downstream\nlinkages  to  agro-processing  and  related  industries.  These\nhave  also  adversely  affected  the  well-being  of  the  vast\nmajority  of  small  farmers  and  the  rural  poor,  and  have\nrestrained overall economic growth. Government subsidies in\nthe agriculture sector are expensive to maintain and do not\ntypically  benefit  the  target  beneficiaries\u2014the  small  and\nmarginal farmers.\nPakistan is in the midst of an International Monetary Fund-led\nstructural adjustment program with poverty reduction as the\nkey goal, and revitalization of the agriculture sector as a key\ncomponent  in  the  export-led  strategy.  The  Government\nintends to redefine its role in the agriculture sector to ensure\nthe smooth functioning of markets, promote private sector\nactivities, and reshape public expenditures in agriculture on\npublic goods and market failures.", "iv\nThe Program will promote reforms to expand the role of the\nprivate  sector  through  deregulation,  liberalization,  and\nprivatization, affecting many public input supply and output\nmarketing  enterprises  that  now  operate  in  the  agriculture\nsector. The agricultural subsidy regime that has compounded\nfiscal  difficulties  and  skewed  the  benefits  of  growth  and\ninvestment away from the needy will be gradually dismantled\nto correspondingly increase social sector investments. The\nGovernment  has  demonstrated  its  commitment  to  the\nProgram  by  initiating  actions  in  several  key  areas.  The\nProgram is consistent with ADB\u2019s country assistance plan for\nPakistan and is well anchored with the overall goals of the\nstructural adjustment.\nObjectives and Scope The  primary  objective  of  the  Program  will  be  to  improve\nagricultural productivity and profitability. It includes specific\nreform measures to (i) promote efficient markets for the major\ncommodities, including wheat, cotton, rice, sugar, fertilizer,\nand  seeds;  and  (ii)  strengthen  support  services  in  small\nfarmer extension and training, research, and regulation to\nimprove quality control.\nClassification Thematic: Economic Growth\nEnvironmental Category B\nAssessment Environmental  implications  of  the  proposed  policy  and\ninstitutional  reforms  were  reviewed,  and  environmental\ninterventions have been incorporated as required.\nThe ADB Loan Amount\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide three loans\nand Terms\ntotaling the equivalent of $350 million, including (i) a loan in\nan amount of SDR96,238,000 ($123 million equivalent) from\nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (subject to the availability of\nAsian Development Fund [ADF] resources), with a term of 24\nyears maturity, including a grace period of 8 years, with an\ninterest rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period,\nand 1.5 percent per annum during the amortization period; (ii)\na  loan  in  an  amount  of  Y27,463,500,000  ($225  million\nequivalent at the exchange rate of $1.00=JPY122.060 as of\n12 November 2001) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources\n(OCR), with a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3\nyears, and interest charge to be determined in accordance\nwith ADB's London interbank offered rate-based loan facility;\nand (iii) a technical assistance (TA) loan in an amount of\nSDR1,565,000  ($2  million  equivalent)  from  ADB's  Special\nFunds resources, with a term of 32 years maturity, including a\ngrace period of 8 years, with an interest rate of 1 percent per\nannum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum\nduring the amortization period.", "v\nProgram Period and The Program period will be five years from December 2001.\nTranching The proposed ADB loans will be released in three tranches.\nThe first tranche of $125 million equivalent (SDR39,121,000\nADF and Y9,154,500,000 OCR) will be released upon loan\neffectiveness, based upon its fulfillment of all first tranche\nconditions.  A  second  tranche  of  $100  million  equivalent\n(SDR39,121,000 ADF and Y6,103,000,000 OCR) is expected\nto  be  released  within  18  months  of  loan  effectiveness  or\nearlier, subject to fulfilling the relevant conditions, but is not\ntime-bound.  The  third  tranche  of  $123  million  equivalent\n(SDR17,996,000  ADF  and  Y12,206,000,000  OCR)  is\nexpected  to  be  released  within  60  months  of  loan\neffectiveness  or  earlier  upon  fulfillment  of  the  relevant\nconditions.\nProcurement The proceeds of the loan will be utilized to finance the full\nforeign exchange costs (excluding local taxes and duties) of\ngoods  and  services  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB\nmember countries (other than those items specified in the\nnegative  list  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and\nmultilateral sources).   Procurement of eligible items will be on\nthe basis of normal commercial practices for procurement by\nthe  private  sector  or  standard  Government  procurement\npractices  acceptable  to  ADB  for  procurement  by  the\nGovernment or its representatives.\nUtilization of the Loan The loans will be disbursed until 31 December 2006. Loan\nproceeds from the first tranche can be used to finance eligible\nexpenditures incurred up to 180 days prior to the date of loan\neffectiveness.\nExecuting Agency The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will coordinate and monitor the\nimplementation of the Program and administer the utilization\nof the loan proceeds. MOF will be supported by the Ministry\nof  Food,  Agriculture,  and  Livestock;  the  Ministry  of\nCommerce; and the provincial governments.\nCounterpart Funds The use of the local currency proceeds of the loan will be\nconsistent  with  the  overall  fiscal  framework  defined  in  the\nStandby  Agreement  between  the  Government  and  the\nInternational Monetary Fund. Subject to this agreement, local\ncurrency  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  used  by  the\nGovernment to support the agriculture sector in general as\nwell  as  the  reforms  to  be  initiated  under  the  Program  in\nparticular.\nTechnical Assistance A TA loan will be provided to assist the Government in (i)\npolicy  advice  and  program  coordination,  including  legal,\nmonitoring,  and  environmental  services;  (ii)  improving  the\nefficiency of commodity markets; (iii) small farmer extension,", "vi\nresearch,  and  safety  nets;  and  (iv)  reorganization  and\nrestructuring  of  state-owned  enterprises.  All  procurement\nunder  the  TA  loan  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's\nGuidelines for Procurement. The selection and engagement\nof consultants will be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory\nto  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The\nGovernment has requested that ADB recruit the consultants\non behalf of the Government and assist the Government in\nnegotiating  the  contract  with  the  consultants.  The\nGovernment and the consultant will sign the contract.\nRisks and Safeguards The Government has expressed its strong ownership of and\ncommitment  to  implement  the  Program.  The  relevant\nministries agree that the goals and objectives of the Program\nare  in  line  with  the  national  agricultural  development  and\npoverty reduction strategies. Given the wide acceptability and\nurgency  of  the  reforms,  the  agreed  upon    timeframe  for\nimplementation is considered realistic. The positive response\nfrom  the  stakeholders,  including  policy  makers,  traders,\nprocessors,  nongovernment  organizations,  farmers\u2019\nassociations,  and  small  farmers,  helps  assure  the\nsustainability of program reforms, and minimizes the risk of\npolicy  reversal.  There  are  also  risks  of  full  provincial\nownership  and  slow  implementation  of  the  reforms,\nparticularly regarding the phaseout of the wheat subsidy and\nthe reduction in government procurement and management\nof wheat stocks.\nThe Program envisages the development and implementation\nof a small farmers plan, which would include social safety\nnets and linkages with ongoing safety net mechanisms, such\nas the Food Support Program, to minimize social risks in the\nunlikely  event  of  any  exogenous  shocks  or  fluctuations  in\ninternational  prices  that  may  adversely  affect  the  income\nlevels of poor farmers. The small farmer orientation of the\nsupport  services  will  increase  stakeholder  participation  in\nresearch and extension, facilitate technological improvement,\nand lead to a gradual change in cropping patterns that will\nresult  in  increased  incomes.  The  Program  is  of  sufficient\nduration (up to five years) with three undated tranches to\nprovide  the  Government  and  provincial  governments\nadequate  time  to  implement  the  reforms,  including  wheat\nprice, subsidy, and procurement measures.", "I. THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on proposed loans\nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Agriculture Sector Program II.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. During the Country Programming Mission in May 1999, the Government requested the\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to provide a program loan for reforms in the agriculture sector.\nProject  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  was  approved  in  July  1999,1  and  individual\nconsultants were fielded in Pakistan during 2000 and 2001 to assist in preparing feasibility studies\nfor the proposed program loan. The TA was implemented in a participatory way, and numerous\nstakeholders  representing  the  Government,  farmers,  farmer  groups,  nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs), academia, private sector agribusiness, and external aid agencies were\nconsulted in workshops and meetings.  A draft sector Program was confirmed by the Appraisal\nMission2  in  June  2001.  This  report  is  based  on  the  findings  of  several  ADB  missions  and\ndiscussions with stakeholders. A Program framework is in Appendix 1.\nIII. THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\nA. The Economy\n3. Pakistan is faced with severe macroeconomic imbalances, declining economic growth,\nrising poverty, and underdeveloped human capital. During the 1990s the fiscal deficit and the\ncurrent account deficit as a proportion of the gross domestic product (GDP) averaged 6.9\npercent and 4.5 percent, respectively. The average economic growth rate decelerated from 6.5\npercent in the 1980s to 5.4 percent in the first half of the 1990s, and to 3.6 percent during the\nlast five years. The incidence of poverty increased from less than 20 percent in the late 1980s to\nover 30 percent today.3 In addition, the savings and investment rates, at less than 15 percent of\nGDP in 2001, remain low. The agriculture sector and textile industry continue to dominate the\neconomy. The agriculture sector contributes about 26 percent to GDP and employs about 50\npercent of the work force. The textile sector, which is based on the cotton produced by the\nagriculture sector, is the largest source of employment for the industrial labor force (38 percent)\nand the largest source of foreign exchange earnings (60 percent).\n4. Crises in the management of public finances and external balances dominated the\neconomic policy agenda in Pakistan during the 1990s. However, despite all efforts, and three\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) programs between 1988 and 1999, little progress was made\nin addressing macroeconomic imbalances. Efforts of successive governments to implement\nstructural reforms during this period were often interrupted, due in part to frequent changes of\ngovernments. The result was a decade of stop-go stabilization policies, with the attendant\nnegative  impact  on  growth,  but  without  the  desired  benefits  in  the  form  of  improved\nmacroeconomic fundamentals. The imposition of economic sanctions following the nuclear tests\nof May 1998 further exposed the vulnerabilities of Pakistan\u2019s economy.\n                  \n1 TA 3229-PAK: Agriculture Sector Program, for $350,000, approved on 20 July 1999, and completed on 31 May\n2001.\n2  Comprising R.

Chronic fiscal and external deficits have resulted in the accumulation of large domestic\nand external debt. Public debt (both domestic and external) equaled 92 percent of GDP in 2000,\nand  interest  payments  on  public  debt  accounted  for  over  40  percent  of  the  total  current\nexpenditure of the Government. Within Pakistan\u2019s debt problems, the external debt is the more\ncritical  issue  for  short-  to  medium-term  economic  management.  In  1998,  debt  servicing\nexceeded 50 percent of foreign exchange earnings, and even after debt rescheduling, the\nexternal debt service ratio in 2001 was over 35 percent. As of 30 June 2001, Pakistan\u2019s total\nexternal  debt  was  about  $34.7  billion,  and  the  ratio  of  external  debt  to  foreign  exchange\nearnings stood at over 240 percent.\n6. The military Government that came to power in October 1999 has initiated a number of\nreform programs to address governance problems and long-standing structural challenges, and\nsince  November  2000  Pakistan  has  been  implementing  a  far-reaching  macroeconomic\nstabilization and restructuring program under an IMF Standby Arrangement.4 Drought, high oil\nprices, and deterioration in the terms of trade have aggravated the situation in Pakistan. GDP\ngrowth in 2000 declined to 3.9 percent from 4.2 percent in 1999. The slowdown occurred\ndespite a bountiful harvest, which propelled real agricultural value-added growth from about 2\npercent in 1999 to 6 percent in 2000. In 2001, because of severe drought that resulted in a 40\npercent reduction in the irrigation water supply, agricultural production fell by 2.5 percent, which\nresulted in a further slowing down of the GDP growth rate to 2.6 percent. However, there are\nsome positive signs, as large-scale manufacturing output expanded by over 7 percent in 2001\ncompared with less than 2 percent in 2000. Strong expansion in the volume of exports was an\nimportant factor in the revival of growth in the manufacturing sector.\n7. Exports, which had been stagnating since the mid-1990s, have expanded by 10 percent\nand 7 percent in 2000 and 2001, respectively. However, export growth in 2001 is expected to be\nwell below the target of 11.3 percent. This was largely because of the slowdown in the world\neconomy and the resulting decline in unit values of Pakistan\u2019s principal export items, as exports\nin volume terms increased by 14.8 percent in 2001. While the failure to meet the export target\nhas  resulted  in  pressure  on  the  current  account,  strong  expansion  in  export  volumes  is\nencouraging, as it shows that the restructuring policies are beginning to take effect. While\nPakistan\u2019s non-oil imports declined in 2001 due to depressed domestic demand, higher oil\nprices resulted in an increase of about 6 percent in total imports. The trade deficit declined for\nthe second year in a row, and the current account deficit also declined. Pakistan\u2019s external\nreserves  were  also  higher,  with  the  State  Bank  of  Pakistan\u2019s  foreign  exchange  reserves\nincreasing to over $1.6 billion by 30 June 2001.5\n8. To reduce the large, unsustainable, and chronic fiscal deficit is a major challenge that\nthe  Government  has  started  to  address  effectively.  In  2001,  because  of  weak  domestic\neconomic conditions, total revenues as a share of GDP declined to 16.2 percent from 16.9\npercent in 2000. However, the Government managed to reduce total expenditures in 2001 to\n21.8 percent of GDP from 23.4 percent in 2000. This decline in expenditures was achieved by\n                  \n4  On 29 November 2000, IMF approved a standby credit for Pakistan until 30 September 2001 in an amount of\n$596 million. Pakistan\u2019s performance under the IMF Standby Arrangement has been very good, and the third\ntranche, based on the 31 March 2001 review by IMF, was released on schedule in July 2001.\n5  Since 1999, the State Bank of Pakistan has been forced to purchase dollars in the open market to finance a part\nof the current account deficit and meet its external reserves target. Such purchases increased to over $2 billion in\n2001 from $1.6 billion in 2000.", "3\nreducing both current and development spending.6 Overall, the consolidated budget deficit\ndeclined to 5.6 percent of GDP in 2001 from 6.5 percent in 2000. In the 2002 Budget, the\nGovernment is committed to reducing the fiscal deficit to below 5 percent of GDP.\n9. The medium- and long-term outlook depends on the pace of structural reforms and\nprivatization, as well as the political will necessary for undertaking reorganization of the Central\nBoard of Revenue, which is essential for improving revenue collection and sustaining fiscal\ndiscipline.  Success  in  reviving  investor  confidence  is  critical  for  improving  economic\nperformance in the short to medium term, and for that, successful completion of negotiations\nwith IMF for the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) in 2001 will be critical. Real\nGDP  growth  is  forecast  to  remain  below  5  percent  per  annum  over  the  next  two  years.\nManufacturing is likely to sustain the robust growth witnessed in 2001. Agricultural growth in\n2002 will probably be adversely affected to some extent by the carryover effects of the drought,\nbut it should return to a rate of 4-5 percent by 2003.\nB. Policy and Development Issues\n10. The primary economic policy issue for Pakistan is the reduction of the fiscal deficit to a\nsustainable level. The Government has been able to increase tax revenues in the last two\nyears, but as a proportion of GDP they are well below the average ratio for the 1990s. The\nburden of adjustment in the 1990s has been largely borne by the development expenditure,\nwhich as a proportion of the GDP is now at the lowest level ever. Given Pakistan\u2019s high and\nrising levels of poverty, and the low level of human development, there is a need to increase\ndevelopment spending. Therefore, the Government needs to focus more on reforms to improve\nrevenue collection by broadening the tax base and strengthening tax administration. In addition,\nit must improve public expenditure management; eliminate untargeted subsidies; and most\nimportantly, stop the massive hemorrhaging of public resources by loss-incurring state-owned\nenterprises (SOEs). The Government has announced an ambitious privatization program, and if\nimplemented it would help to reduce the fiscal burden of the loss-incurring SOEs, and also\ngenerate  resources  for  both  debt  retirement  and  poverty  reduction.  However,  thus  far  the\nGovernment has been concentrating on measures to create equal conditions and an enabling\nenvironment for privatization, and now it needs to focus on completing some of the major\nprivatizations planned for the next year to demonstrate its seriousness and commitment.\n11. Another  important  economic  policy  issue  is  economic  restructuring  to  enhance  the\nefficiency  and  outward  orientation  of  the  agriculture  and  manufacturing  sectors.  This  is\nnecessary for Pakistan to improve its external balance, service its huge external debt, and meet\nthe challenges of globalization. The Government has been implementing a program of trade\nliberalization since the 1990s. The maximum tariff rate, which stood at 90 percent in 1991, was\nreduced to 45 percent in 1997 and to 30 percent in 2001. As a result, the effective tariff rate\n(i.e., tax revenues from international trade as a proportion of total imports) declined from 30\npercent in 1991 to 12 percent in 2000. However, the trade liberalization policies have not had\nthe desired impact because of the balance of payments crisis, slow economic growth, and the\nlow level of private investment since the mid-1990s. But the export performance of the last two\nyears gives some hope that the restructuring process is beginning to have an effect.\n12. The key development issue is the need to address the governance failure underlying the\neconomic problems confronting Pakistan today. The Government has initiated a number of civil\n                  \n6  In 2001, development expenditure was reduced to an all-time low of 2.8 percent of GDP. Such low levels of\ndevelopment spending are likely to have serious implications for poverty reduction and physical infrastructure.", "4\nservice and administrative reforms, including an anticorruption drive and merit-based and more\ntransparent  recruitment  and  promotion  systems.  However,  devolution  is  the  centerpiece  of\nPakistan\u2019s governance reform program. The objective is to enhance public accountability and\ntransform the society in the medium term into a more democratic and equitable one. The Local\nGovernment  2000  Plan,  announced  in  March  2000,  envisages  a  three-tiered  local-level\ngovernment  system.  The  basic  underlying  principles  are  \"people-centered,  rights-  and\nresponsibility-based, and service-oriented\" government structures. Elected local governments\ntook power on 14 August 2001. Since delivery of almost all public services will be devolved to\nthe local governments, successful implementation of the plan will have far-reaching implications\nfor accelerating poverty reduction and human development in the country. The implementation\nwill need to be closely monitored because of the fiscal devolution component, which could\nadversely affect the fiscal position of the country as a whole and thus put at risk the ongoing\nstabilization program of the Government.\nC. Poverty Reduction\n13. After falling in the 1980s, the incidence of poverty has been rising in Pakistan since the\n1990s. At the end of the 1980s, one of five Pakistanis was poor; today it is one of three.\nAlthough Pakistan has no official poverty line and estimates vary, there is agreement that the\nincidence of poverty currently ranges between 30 and 35 percent. Despite the Social Action\nProgram, primary and middle school enrolment rates have declined since the 1990s. While\ninfant and maternal mortality rates and the total fertility rate declined during the 1990s, they\ncontinue to be among the highest in the region. Significant gender gaps also remain in key\nindicators of human development. Poverty in rural areas, where two out of five persons are\npoor, is much higher than the national average. Among the rural areas, the incidence of poverty\nis highest in southern Punjab, large parts of Sindh, and almost all of Balochistan. There is also a\nwidening  gap  in  education  between  the  rural  and  urban  areas,  and  the  primary  school\nenrollment rate in the rural areas is only two thirds of the urban rate.\n14. Slow economic growth was the immediate cause of the increase in poverty in Pakistan in\nthe  1990s.  The  underlying  cause,  however,  was  poor  governance,  which  includes  social\nexclusion of the poor; failure to control ethnic and sectarian violence; poor fiscal management;\nfailure  to  address  accountability  and  performance  issues  within  the  public  service;  and\novercentralization, resulting in continuing tensions between the federal and provincial levels of\ngovernment. The slowdown in economic growth and expanding debt burden also resulted in a\nshrinking public sector development program and declining employment opportunities, which\ncompounded the problem of poverty in the 1990s. ADB\u2019s poverty analysis also identified the\nlack  of  nonfarm  employment  opportunities,  which  are  largely  determined  by  the  extent  of\nrural-urban linkages, as the key explanatory variable in the regional differences in the incidence\nof poverty in rural areas.\n15. In  February  2001,  the  Government  released  its  Three-Year  Poverty  Reduction\nProgramme  2001-2004.  The  five  pillars  of  the  program  are  (i)  macroeconomic  reforms  to\npromote growth, (ii) physical asset creation for the poor, (iii) social asset creation for the poor,\n(iv)  provision  of  social  safety  nets  to  protect  the  most  vulnerable  groups,  and  (v)  good\ngovernance. The Government's strategy to achieve higher growth and build a more self-reliant\neconomy includes (i) transforming the agriculture sector into a dynamic, high-yielding, market-\nbased sector; (ii) creating a broad-based manufacturing structure oriented towards exports, with\nparticular attention to small and medium enterprise development; (iii) encouraging oil and gas\nexploration and development; and (iv) developing information technology and the software\nindustry.  However,  structural  adjustment  under  the  IMF  program  involves  reducing  market\ndistortions, fiscal and monetary compression, and structural reforms such as increases in public", "5\nutility tariffs and indirect taxes, which could lead to further pressure on the poor. Therefore, the\nrole of good governance, targeted interventions, and improvements in access to basic services\nwill be crucial in mitigating the adverse impacts of macroeconomic stabilization and structural\nadjustment on the poor.\nIV. THE SECTOR\nA. Background and Recent Performance\n16. Pakistan was a leading world exporter of raw cotton and rice through the 1990s. In 2000,\nthe agriculture sector was the major source of exports  (about 70 percent), including raw and\nprocessed cotton, rice, leather, textiles, and carpets. Over 90 percent of the total farm output\ncomes from irrigated land. Major crops are wheat, cotton, rice, sugarcane, and fodder; and crops\naccounted for about 60 percent of agricultural GDP in 1999 and 26 percent of total GDP. Pakistan\nattained self-sufficiency in wheat production (the staple food) for most of the 1980s but was\nunable to sustain a high growth rate. Wheat surpluses were again attained in 2000 and 2001,\nlargely due to the Government's price supports and improvements in extension deliveries, notably\nin Punjab. However, there are major concerns about agricultural productivity and profitability.\nBetween  1990  and  1999,  the  agriculture  sector  grew  at  about  3  percent  per  year.  Given\nPakistan's rapid population growth rate of about 2.5 percent per year, per capita agricultural\ngrowth is even more discouraging in comparison with other countries in the region, such as\nPeople's Republic of China, Thailand, and Indonesia.\n17. Under a World Bank- and IMF-funded structural adjustment program during the 1980s,\nthe Government committed itself to bringing input and output prices closer to world levels,\nreducing public expenditure, and enhancing the role of the private sector. As a consequence, a\nnumber of policy decisions became inevitable. For example, subsidies on pesticides, seeds, and\nmechanization were withdrawn in one step in the early 1980s. In addition, a phased removal of\nthe fertilizer subsidy was instituted in cooperation with ADB, which has since resulted in periodic\nincreases in fertilizer prices and an expanded role for the private sector in fertilizer production,\ndistribution,  and  import.  However,  the  agriculture  sector  still  remains  distorted.  Several\nmacroeconomic policy changes are currently being implemented in agreement with IMF and the\nWorld Bank as discussed above.\n18. Like price distortions, government intervention in agricultural markets has been quite\ncommon in order to make price controls more effective. For example, since the 1950s, the\nGovernment has continued to procure, store, trade, and distribute major agricultural inputs and\ncommodities to varying degrees. Even after the World Bank and IMF structural adjustment\nprograms during the 1980s, SOEs or parastatal organizations continued to operate along with\nthe newly emerging private sector. The public sector has a major market share in wheat (about\n67 percent of the marketed surplus), fertilizer (40 percent), and seed (50 percent), and SOEs\nregularly intervene in cotton and rice markets.\n19. Local, provincial, and federal governments levy taxes on agriculture in one form or\nanother. These taxes included direct, indirect, and implicit taxes. The historic land revenue and\nits cesses, octroi7 (until its abolition in 2000), income tax, wealth tax, and export duties fall in the\ncategory of direct taxes. There are also indirect taxes (including customs and excise duties, and\nsales taxes) and implicit taxes (such as procurement prices for the major commodities less than\ninternational prices). The sum of direct, indirect, and implicit taxes is very high in agriculture\u2014\n                  \n7  Octroi means a tax on the internal movement of goods.", "6\nestimated at 32 percent of total agriculture income in 1999.8 Even the net tax after subtraction of\nsubsidies and government expenditure on agriculture and irrigation is high, estimated at 29\npercent in 1999. Pakistan has a long history of taxing agriculture through the land revenue\nsystem.  The  replacement  of  the  system  with  an  agricultural  income  tax  has  been  widely\nproposed to meet the financial needs of the growing national economy. Under pressure from\nADB (through the completed Agriculture Program Loan),9 the World Bank, and IMF, Pakistan\nintroduced various types of agricultural income tax, in part in 1993 and in full during 1996, but\nimplementation  problems  remain.  Implicit  taxes  generally  arise  as  a  result  of  government\nintervention  in  the  agricultural  commodity,  input,  and  foreign  exchange  markets.  It  is  this\ninterventionist price policy that has implicitly taxed the agriculture sector from time to time.\nTaking into account such implicit taxation, agriculture's total tax burden has been estimated to\nbe roughly double that of the nonagricultural sectors.\nB. Sector Institutions\n20. The institutions that provide services and regulatory functions both in the public (federal\nand provincial level) and the private (multinational and national) sectors are numerous. A review\nof  the  major  institutions  impacting  on  the  Program  is  provided  with  their  responsibilities,\nperformance, and suggested institutional reforms. Details are in Appendix 2.\n1. Ministry  of Food, Agriculture, and Livestock\n21. The Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Livestock (MINFAL) is responsible for economic\ncoordination and policy planning of agriculture, food security, livestock, and fisheries activities.\nMINFAL is staffed with about 100 officers (technical and administrative) and about 400 support\nstaff.  MINFAL  has  several  wings  namely  (i)  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Wing  (primarily\nresponsible  for  general  administration,  finance,  and  budget),  (ii)  the  Food  Wing  (primarily\nresponsible for supervision of the Directorate General of Food, the Pakistan Agricultural Storage\nand Services Corporation [PASSCO], the Agriculture and Livestock Products Marketing and\nGrading  Department  [ALMA],  and  the  Agricultural  Prices  Commission  [APCOM]),  (iii)  the\nPlanning Wing (primarily responsible for preparation of development programs and annual\nplans), (iv) the Agriculture Development Wing (primarily responsible for supervision of several\nautonomous institutions, including the Fertilizer Import Department [FID], the Soil Survey of\nPakistan, the Federal Seed Certification and Registration Department, the Pakistan Central\nCotton Committee, the Pakistan Cotton Standards Institute, the Pakistan Agricultural Research\nCouncil [PARC], the Pakistan Oilseeds Development Board, and the Korangi Fish Harbor), (v)\nthe  Water  Management  Cell  (primarily  responsible  for  coordination  of  the  on-farm  water\nmanagement activities of the provinces), and (vi) the Economic Wing (primarily responsible for\ncollecting  and  disseminating  agricultural  statistics,  formulation  of  agricultural  policy,  and\npreparation of import and export trade policies, World Trade Organization-related policies, and\nbriefs).\n22. Agriculture  and  livestock  are  mainly  provincial  matters,  and  MINFAL  needs  to  be\nreorganized to rationalize the roles and responsibilities of the secretariat. FID, the Directorate\nGeneral of Food, and PASSCO are responsible for the import, procurement, storage of fertilizer,\nand food distribution at the federal level. These institutions are overstaffed; heavily dependent\non  budgetary  support;  and  wasteful  due  to  poor  governance,  financial  indiscipline,  and\n                  \n8  Chaudhry, M.G., R.M.

With the Government's planned liberalization of trade and expansion of the private\nsector in import, export, and domestic trade and storage activities, these institutions will be\nredundant and should be closed and divested.\n23. Some of the institutions, such as PARC, are overstaffed and generally duplicate the\nfunctions being carried out at the provincial level. The federal institutions can continue to work\nas  clearing  and  coordinating  agencies,  and  can  conduct  other  functions  that  cannot  be\ndecentralized. Some of the institutions such as APCOM and ALMA can be made more effective\nby merging them with MINFAL's Planning Wing.\n2. Other Federal Institutions\n24. The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) is a public sector organization under the\nMinistry of Commerce, responsible for the marketing of surplus agricultural commodities. TCP\nhas incorporated the former parastatals, the Cotton Export Corporation, and the Rice Export\nCorporation of Pakistan, along with their liabilities. The staffs of the two organizations were\nreleased, and a limited number have been absorbed in TCP for winding-up activities. TCP\nreceives  budgetary  support  from  the  Government  for  the  losses  incurred  in  trading  of\nagricultural  commodities.  The  National  Fertilizer  Development  Centre  (NFDC)  under  the\nPlanning Commission is also a candidate for closure, and National Fertilizer Marketing Limited\n(NFML) under the Ministry of Production is being privatized.\n3. Provincial Institutions\n25. Although the Federal Government is largely responsible for policy matters, the provincial\ngovernments are mainly responsible for implementing policy, and agriculture and the social\nsectors are considered provincial subjects. The provincial agriculture departments oversee the\nmanagement of research, extension, maintenance and regulation of commodity markets, the\nprovincial  seed  corporations,  and  provincial  input  supply  organizations.  The  departments\nsupervise  the  agricultural  extension  departments,  agricultural  research  institutes,10  the\nagricultural machinery and engineering departments, the soil conservation departments, and the\non-farm water management departments. They also supervise the provincial seed and fertilizer\nstorage and marketing institutions, such as the Punjab Seed Corporation (PSC), the Sindh Seed\nCorporation (SSC), the Sindh Agricultural Supplies Organization (SASO), and the Agriculture\nDevelopment Agency (ADA) in North-West Frontier Province (NWFP). The research activities\nare very weak due to high establishment costs and inadequate funding for operational activities.\nMoreover, the linkage among research, extension, and farmers is very weak. The research\npursued in the institutes generally does not address farmers' problems. The research institutes,\nto make them responsive to farmers' needs, should be given autonomy, with the majority of the\nmembers of the supervising board drawn from the farming community, processors, and traders.\nThe extension department\u2019s performance is also very poor. The present activities are not farmer\nresponsive. The knowledge and extension methods of field staff are outdated and outmoded.\nLivestock extension also is overstaffed, and the delivery efficiency of services is very poor.\n4. Private Institutions\n26. Numerous  multinational  and  national  private  sector  fertilizer,  pesticide,  and  seed\ncompanies and machinery suppliers are active and provide input supply services along with\n                  \n10  In North-West Frontier Province, the research and outreach functions have been put under the Agricultural\nUniversity, while the Agriculture Department continues to supervise the agricultural extension and agricultural\nmachinery functions.", "8\nextension services. Private seed companies have to compete with public sector companies that\nhave the advantage of budgetary support from the Government. Several NGOs (particularly the\nRural Support Programs throughout the country) have shown interest in the extension activities,\nbut they lack the resources. They can provide these services to farmers in a cost-effective\nmanner by linking farming communities with the relevant research and extension staff.\nC. Constraints and Issues\n27. A number of key issues and constraints affect the sector. A detailed cause and effect or\nproblem tree analysis was conducted during preparation of the Program that proved effective in\nfocusing the proposed Program on a few selected areas. Based on this analysis and substantial\ndiscussion with major stakeholders, a program framework was developed (Appendix 1). The core\nproblems in Pakistan\u2019s agriculture are low productivity and profitability. The major causes of low\nproductivity and profitability include (i) low quality inputs, (ii) imperfect commodity markets (with\nrelated pricing, subsidy, storage, and trade issues), (iii) poor quality support services (research\nand extension services especially for small farmers), (iv) inefficient water resource management,\n(v) poor delivery and sustainability of agricultural finance, (vi) inadequate rural infrastructure, (vii)\ndeteriorating natural resources, and (viii) insecure land tenure. There are problems of land tenure,\ninsecure property rights, and labor markets, particularly in the southern areas of Sindh Province,\nand a separate project is currently being prepared to address these issues.11 ADB and the World\nBank are actively assisting Pakistan in the areas of water resource management, agricultural\nfinance, rural infrastructure, and natural resources. However, there are major gaps in assistance\nfor market development (for both commodity outputs and inputs) and support and regulatory\nservices. The major effects of these problems are low agricultural growth, rising unemployment,\nand increasing rural poverty. Crop production has remained stagnant or has declined in some\ncases due to poor market development, inadequate price incentives, poor seed, low fertilizer use,\ndisease problems, poor water management, and increasing costs of production.\n28. In terms of output per hectare, productivity for wheat and rice has risen slowly in recent\nyears, while productivity growth has remained stagnant for cotton and sugarcane. Growth rates\nin yield during 1990-2000 have averaged 2.0 percent for wheat, 3.1 percent for rice, -0.9\npercent for cotton, and 1.8 percent for sugarcane. Other indicators of productivity are (i) yield\ngaps,  or  the  difference  between  average  and  best  farmers'  yields;  and  (ii)  total  factor\nproductivity, an index of all outputs and inputs. The yield gap is as high as 30 percent for wheat\nand 50 percent for rice, and total factor productivity has either stagnated or declined since the\nmid-1970s.12  Major  obstacles  to  yield  increases  include  resource  constraints  and  policy\ndistortions.\n29. Key resource constraints include a problem-plagued irrigation system, inadequate human\nresources,  poor  infrastructure,  and  resource  degradation.  By  examining  various  cropping\nsystems over a time series from the introduction of the Green Revolution (1966-1974), through\nthe period of intensification (1975-1984), and including the Post Green Revolution (1984-1994),\nAli  and  Byerlee13  demonstrate  that  while  there  is  continuous  and  widespread  resource\n                  \n11  TA 3132-PAK: Sindh Rural Development Project, for $800,000, approved on 22 December 1998, and completed\non 1 November 2000; and TA 3725-PAK: Additional Preparatory Work on the Sindh Rural Development Project,\nfor $150,000, approved on 24 September 2001.\n12  Byerlee, D. and A. Siddiq, \"Has the Green Revolution Been Sustained? The Quantitative Impact of the Seed-\nFertilizer Revolution in Pakistan Revisited,\" World Development, 22:9, 1994.\n13  Ali, M. and D. Byerlee, Productivity Growth and Resource Degradation in Pakistan's Punjab: A Decomposition\nAnalysis, the World Bank, Washington, November 2000.", "9\ndegradation,  the  health  of  the  agrosystem  is  also  related  to  poorly  introduced  modern\ntechnologies, monocropping, and mismanagement of water resources. Increasing population\ngrowth,  decreasing  farm  size,  degrading  soil  and  water  resources,  and  lack  of  diversified\nproduction systems suggest that Pakistan is reaching a point where agricultural sustainability is\nproblematic. With past sources of growth weakening, future growth will have to come primarily\nfrom  productivity  gains,  which  can  be  achieved  by  (i)  allocating  resources  to  crops  that\ndemonstrate comparative advantage, (ii) improving the technical efficiency of inputs and farm\nmanagement, and (iii) increasing cropping intensity.\n30. In  addition  to  resource  constraints,  Pakistan's  agriculture  faces  numerous  policy\nconstraints. Government intervention in agricultural markets remains excessive, and, particularly\nin  the  cases  of  wheat,  sugarcane,  and  seeds,  has  discouraged  sustainable  and  efficient\nproduction and marketing. This intervention, coupled with powerful private marketing associations\nin cotton and quality problems in rice, has led to low farmer prices, low profitability for farmers, and\nfew incentives for growth in productivity. Government spending has been dominated by subsidies\nthat typically do not help farmers, either because of inefficiencies or because the subsidy (on\nwheat in particular) is designed to help consumers at the expense of producers. Producers will\nrespond to credible price reforms that will introduce market-based incentives. Public marketing\nenterprises and subsidies currently crowd out private sector involvement. Restricting membership\nin trading and marketing associations limits competition. Research and extension are particularly\nweak and ineffective, and do not contribute substantially to productivity gains by small farmers.\nThe  proper  role  of  the  Government  should  be  to  encourage  the  development  of  smoothly\nfunctioning markets through institutional and regulatory reforms that facilitate private sector and\nsmall farmer activities. As a result of current government interventions and policies, productivity\nincentives are weak, particularly for small farms (less than 5 hectares), which constitute 80-90\npercent of all farms and include marginal farms (less than 2 hectares).\n31. The problems and constraints in the markets for the major commodities (wheat, cotton,\nrice, and sugar), key inputs (fertilizer and seeds), and support services to farmers (extension and\nresearch) are discussed in detail in the following subsections. Wheat is the major winter or rabi\ncrop, cotton and rice are major summer (monsoon) or kharif crops, and sugarcane is a 9-12\nmonth crop.\n1. Wheat\n32. The production of Pakistan\u2019s major food crop has averaged about 18 million tons per\nannum over the last five years, ranging from about 17 million tons in 1996 and 1997 to 21 million\ntons in 2000. After a hiatus of about 10 years since the 1980s, Pakistan again achieved self-\nsufficiency  in  wheat  in  2000,  and  the  estimated  production  in  2001  is  19-20  million  tons.\nHistorically, about 65-70 percent of the total production is consumed on the farm or traded within\nthe local area, with a marketable surplus of about 5-6 million tons. The Government regularly\nprocures about 4 million tons for the Strategic Reserve and buffer stock. The remaining quantities\nare sold in open markets. However, the Government reserves the right to procure more wheat,\nand in 2000, it procured a total of 8.6 million tons, practically the entire marketed surplus. Punjab\nis the only wheat surplus province, and Pakistan has traditionally imported wheat (about 2 million\ntons  annually),  entirely  through  MINFAL\u2019s  Directorate  of  Food  and  the  US  Embassy  in\nWashington.  Wheat  is  procured  by  the  Government  through  PASSCO,  and  by  provincial\ngovernments  through  their  food  departments,  at  the  support  price  announced  by  MINFAL\n(prepared by APCOM). PASSCO purchases wheat from Punjab, supplies the provincial food", "10\ndepartments, and stores wheat for the national Strategic Reserve.14 The total wheat storage\ncapacity in the public sector is about 5.2 million tons, including 1.3 million tons with PASSCO\nand  3.9  million  tons  with  the  provinces.15  Restrictions  on  wheat  movement,  particularly  in\nPunjab, during harvest time force farmers to sell to the public sector, and as a result, farmers\nreceive lower prices than they would otherwise.\n33. Later, government agencies sell the wheat to flour mills at a subsidized issue (sales)\nprice. The subsidy is equivalent to the procurement price plus incidental costs (storage, debt\nservicing, bags, salaries, and transportation) less the issue price.16 In addition, imported wheat\nmay be subsidized so that the landed price of imports equals the support price. For many years,\nthe support price was below the world price, but in 2000, due to an increase in the procurement\nprice, the procurement price was more or less equivalent to the world price (about $118-125 per\nton). In 2001, the procurement price (about $117 per ton) was less than the export parity price\n(about $126 per ton). The Government, through TCP, exported about 200,000 tons of wheat in\n2001 to Iraq at an average price of about $108 per ton. There were no imports in 2000, but the\ntotal wheat subsidy on domestic procurement was about PRs13 billion ($213 million) paid from\nthe provincial budget funds. In 1999, the wheat subsidy was about PRs9 billion, and in 1998 it\nwas about PRs13 billion. These subsidy amounts are underestimated, because not all the costs\nof handling and storage are included. About two thirds of the subsidy cost is borne by the\nprovincial governments, mainly Punjab. The major part of the subsidy goes to mill owners, and a\nminor part goes to food consumers. The price supports benefit mainly larger farmers and not\nsmall and marginal farmers. The Government also finances the losses of PASSCO and the food\ndepartments.\n34. The public food procurement, storage, and sales program is expensive to operate and\nwasteful of wheat supplies (due to high storage losses), and it does not target the poor (since it\nbenefits all flour consumers) or farmers unless they are net consumers of wheat. When the\nsupport price is below the world price, farmers lose out. When the support price is greater than\nthe world price, the consumer subsidizes wheat farmers. Also, the Punjab Government has until\nrecently restricted the free movement of wheat out of the province and between districts in order\nto guarantee that it can procure all the wheat it wishes at the support price. Punjab\u2019s wheat\nfarmers would benefit from a policy that would encourage a higher farmgate price through free\nmovement of wheat and no subsidies to mill owners. Incentives to investment in private storage\nand to long-term trading have been thwarted through both price policy and restricting free\nmovement of wheat. Conscious of these problems, the Punjab Government constituted in 2001\na Task Force on the Procurement and Marketing of Wheat. This task force is proposing to\nincrease  private  sector  participation  in  wheat  marketing,  storage,  and  export,  as  well  as\nexamining the proper role of government in the wheat trade. Wheat imports and exports should\nalso  be  liberalized  to  improve  food  security.  Poor  consumers  of  wheat  would  be  better\nsupported through direct and targeted programs, and the Government is proposing food support\nand zakat (mandated Islamic cash transfer) programs in this regard.\n                  \n14 In addition to PASSCO's share of the total annual procurement at about 30 percent, the average provincial shares\nare Punjab, 60 percent; Sindh, 10 percent; and NWFP and Balochistan, less than 1 percent each.\n15 Including 2,483,000 tons with Punjab, 709,000 tons with Sindh, 365,000 tons with NWFP, 218,000 tons with\nBalochistan, 44,000 tons with Azad Kashmir, 20,000 tons with the Northern Areas, and 54,000 tons with the\nmilitary. PASSCO\u2019s storage capacity includes 0.45 million tons covered and 0.85 million tons open using raised\nplatforms and tarps.\n16  Currently, the procurement price is PRs300/40 kg or PRs7,500 per ton, and the issue price is PRs8,000 per ton in\nPunjab and PRs8,500 per ton in other provinces. Incidental costs are about PRs1,800 per ton with PASSCO, and\nthe rate of subsidy is about PRs1,300 per ton, not including all the costs of the provincial food departments.", "11\n2. Cotton\n35. The production of Pakistan\u2019s major cash or export crop has averaged about 10 million\nbales per annum over the last five years, ranging from about 9.4 million bales in 1996 to 11.2\nmillion bales in 2000. The estimated production in 2001 is 10.7 million bales. By 1995 cotton had\nbecome almost as important as wheat in terms of value added, accounting for about 3 percent of\nthe total GDP in 1999, more or less equivalent to the share of wheat. Expansion of cotton\nproduction, due in large part to the introduction of insect- and disease-resistant varieties and a\nfree trade policy that was introduced in FY1996 removing import and export duties, caused a\ncorresponding decline in the relative importance of sugar and rice. There are over 1,100 ginning\nfactories that buy from farmers and marketing agents and separate the seed from the lint. The\nginners are organized through the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association. There are about 500\ntextile mills, but there is concern that they are oligopolistic, since they are owned by only 30-40\nextended families and are organized in the powerful All Pakistan Textile Mills Association. The\nKarachi Cotton Association largely dominates exports of raw cotton, lint, and yarn. There is a\nneed for more competition in exports, imports, and processing by encouraging other smaller\ntraders and ginners in order to raise farmgate prices to producers.\n36. In 2000, cotton production reached a record 11.2 million bales, the market price crashed,\nand the domestic price was much below the world price. In an effort to support producers, the\nGovernment, through TCP, procured about 10,000 bales for export in 2000 and about 500,000\nbales in 1999. These actions by the Government encouraged additional exports of cotton lint and\nyarn by the private sector, and the domestic price gradually rose. Unfortunately, TCP's actions\ncrowded out the private sector. There may eventually be a need for a futures market to stabilize\nprices,  especially  for  ginning  factories.  There  is  also  a  need  for  enhanced  quality  control\nmeasures to ensure the private sector supply of quality products for international and domestic\nmarkets.\n3. Rice\n37. The production of milled rice has averaged about 4.5 million tons per annum over the last\nfive years, ranging from 4.0 million tons in 1996 to 5.2 million tons in 2000. The estimated\nproduction in 2001 is 4.8 million tons. Long grain basmati rice production was about 1.8 million\ntons of total production in 2000. Punjab leads the provinces in rice production. Pakistan\u2019s private\nsector exported 1.9 million tons of rice in 2000, and is expected to export about 1.5 million tons in\n2001. Rice has accounted for an average of 6 percent of total export earnings over the last five\nyears. The mixing and export of basmati and short grain rice in 2000 by some in the private sector\nadversely affected the reputation of Pakistani basmati rice, pointing to a need for self-regulation\nand some oversight by the public sector for improved quality control. Due to the high production in\n2000 and the resulting drop in the domestic price soon after harvest, many growers advocated\ngovernment procurement at a support price higher than the open market price. In late September\n2000, the Government announced an increase in the support prices for the various varieties of\nrice, and directed PASSCO to procure up to PRs1 billion ($20 million). Large rice exporting firms\nare  organized  into  the  Rice  Exporters  Association  of  Pakistan  (REAP),  but  they  restrict\nmembership, and new and smaller exporting firms do not have representation or an equal voice\nwith  government  licensing  and  regulatory  authorities.  New  entrants  in  the  market  and  new\nassociations are needed to increase competition with REAP, expand exports, and ensure higher\nprices to producers.", "12\n4. Sugar\n38. The production of sugarcane has averaged about 48 million tons per annum over the last\nfive years. Production in 2000 was about 46 million tons and is estimated to be 43.7 million tons in\n2001. About 25 percent of the annual crop is used to process brown sugar (gur). Molasses is a\nbyproduct. In 2000, about 29 million tons of sugarcane was processed into about 2.4 million tons\nof white sugar. The remainder was processed into brown sugar and molasses. The domestic\ndemand for sugar is 3.1-3.2 million tons annually, and imports average about 0.8-0.9 million tons.\nAlthough Pakistan is the world\u2019s fifth largest producer of sugar, there are major problems. There is\nabout 45 percent overcapacity in the sugar mills, and the average sugar content of sugarcane is\n8.25 percent, below the world average of about 10.0 percent. As measured by the domestic\nresource cost, Pakistani sugarcane appears to be noncompetitive, with a domestic resource cost\nof about 2.17 By comparison, cotton, wheat, basmati rice, oilseeds, and pulses had measures less\nthan one illustrating comparative advantage. The sugar industry has been highly protected in\nrecent years, and the domestic ex-mill sugar price has been about 40 percent higher than the\nlanded world price. Imports were taxed so that the import price plus the tariff would more or less\nequal the domestic price. However in 2000, the duty on imports was reduced from 45 percent to\n20 percent. The import duty was further lowered to 10 percent in June 2001. Relations are also\nstrained between the growers and the 77 mill owners, organized into the powerful Pakistan Sugar\nMills Association (PSMA). The sugar industry has been overprotected, monopsonistic, highly\nindebted to banks, and inefficient, and was kept competitive with active government support at the\nexpense of the taxpayers and sugar consumers. Under the old zoning system, farmers were\nrequired to sell sugarcane to the mills in their area. This was abolished in 2000, and growers can\nnow sell sugarcane to any mill. Farmers have also been restricted from producing brown sugar\nand molasses, a restriction that is being abolished. Brown sugar and molasses are in high\ndemand, in both rural areas and in Afghanistan, and the removal of the restriction would help\nfarmers. Payments are commonly delayed to farmers from sugar mill owners. PSMA is continually\npressuring the Government to reintroduce zoning restrictions and raise import tariffs to protect\ndomestic production and processing.\n5. Fertilizer\n39. The consumption of fertilizer has averaged about 5 million tons per annum over the last\nfive years (5.4 million tons in 1999 and an estimated 6.5 million tons in 2000), at a growth rate of\nabout 5 percent per year, with production of about 4.5 million tons on average and imports of\nabout 0.5 million tons. Urea fertilizer accounts for about 70 percent of total consumption, followed\nby diammonium phosphate (19 percent) and sulphate of potash and compound fertilizers (11\npercent). In terms of nutrients, the ratios of nitrogen to phosphate to potassium use are similar to\nnutrient uses in the region, but below the recommended uses of phosphate and potassium. About\n40 percent of domestic production, largely urea, is in the public sector with the National Fertilizer\nCorporation. The remainder is with three large private fertilizer companies. Imports are currently\nmade entirely by the private sector, and the Government has agreed to close and divest FID.\nImports of urea are very limited. Traditionally, all the diammonium phosphate requirements were\nimported,  but  Fauji  Fertilizer  started  producing  about  700,000  tons  annually  in  2000.  About\n540,000 tons of this fertilizer were imported in 2000, and about 700,000 tons will be imported in\n2001. The National Fertilizer Corporation markets its fertilizer through its subsidiary, NFML, a\n                  \n17 The domestic resource cost is the ratio of domestic (nontraded) inputs to the value of foreign exchange earned per\nunit of the crop, and a measure of comparative advantage. A value of less than 1 indicates a comparative advantage,\nand a value greater than 1 indicates relatively inefficient production. The data was from 1992: Longmire, J. and P.\nDeboard, Agricultural Pricing and Comparative Advantage in Pakistan, World Bank, Washington, 1993.", "13\ncommercial but loss-incurring institution. The five factories of the National Fertilizer Corporation\nare being privatized, starting with the Paksaudi plant in 2001, and NFML will be reorganized and\ndownsized as factories are privatized.\n40. Three provincial government enterprises have until recently been distributing imported\nfertilizer  (from  FID)  and  other  items  such  as  public  sector  seed,  pesticide,  and  machinery,\nincluding the Punjab Agricultural Development and Supplies Corporation, SASO, and ADA in\nNWFP. These are all loss-incurring enterprises that have defaulted on government loans, and\nhave limited functions, given the private sector domination of the fertilizer import and marketing\noperations. The Government and the provincial governments have decided to close or divest all\nthese institutions.\n41. Fertilizer subsidies have been eliminated (direct subsidies from the Government were\neliminated in 1996 in large part due to the completed Agriculture Program Loan), but natural gas\nsubsidies continue. The Government is finalizing its new fertilizer policy in consultation with private\nproducers,  and  is  considering  terminating  gas  subsidies  for  all  new  fertilizer  factories  and\ncontracts. Active government support to public sector fertilizer import, production, and marketing\nagencies acts as a major disincentive to private sector open market operations. The Government\ndirected FID to stop fertilizer imports in 1999 and 2000, and only the private sector has been\nimporting diammonium phosphate, urea, and other fertilizers in the last two years. Private firms\nvoluntarily charge uniform prices throughout the country to stay competitive. In addition, NFDC\nunder  the  Planning  Commission  is  not  serving  any  useful  purpose,  since  data  on  fertilizer\nsubsector is readily available throughout the country. The Government is therefore considering its\nclosure or divestiture. Provincial governments are continuously monitoring and regulating fertilizer\nimports and retail markets for quality control, and there are no major quality problems. However,\nthere is no existing legislation dealing with the import, certification, and use of chemical fertilizer.\nMINFAL is preparing a Fertilizer Control Ordinance to address regulatory needs in (i) monitoring\nthe quality of imported fertilizer, (ii) registering importers, (iii) compiling data on imports and use,\nand (iv) forecasting demand for imports.\n6. Seeds\n42. About  74,000-80,000  tons  of  certified  seed  are  marketed  annually,  with  wheat  seed\naccounting for about 91 percent and cotton seed about 6 percent. Most seed is passed on from\nfarmer to farmer, and the use of retained seed after harvest is very high. There is an urgent need\nto increase the market for high quality seed to meet farmers' unmet demands. The private sector\naccounts for about half of the seed market, partly attributed to the Agriculture Program. There are\nabout 300 private seed companies, including 4 multinationals. However, most of the certified seed\ndistributed by the private sector is imported seed, and the restricted access to research institution\nvarieties and low demand have not encouraged the establishment of seed farms. The two public\nsector seed agencies, PSC and SSC, are largely loss-incurring operations,18 and also discourage\nprivate sector investment in domestic seed farms. They are good candidates for privatization or\nreorganization along commercial lines to effectively compete on equal terms with the private\nsector. The public research institutes are required by the Government to provide breeder seed for\nnew varieties to PSC and SSC, and as a result, private seed companies do not have easy access\nto this seed. This amounts to a virtual monopoly of the public seed companies on the supply of\nbreeder seed. The Federal Seed Certification and Registration Department and the National Seed\n                  \n18 PSC\u2019s performance has been mixed since its establishment in 1976, but SSC has never been able to generate a\nprofit and is highly subsidized by the Sindh Government. SSC depends on PSC for its seed. Details are in Ahmed,\nM. J., Performance Evaluations of PSC and SSC, World Bank, Islamabad, November 1998.", "14\nCouncil under MINFAL are responsible for ensuring high quality seed and genetic material, but\nthey have poor implementation capacity and lack a clear mandate to assist in ensuring and\nregulating quality seed. The private sector should finance its own certifications of high quality seed\naccording to national guidelines.\n7. Extension\n43. There are more than 5,000 extension workers throughout the country, who basically follow\nthe top-down and supply-driven training and visit (T&V) extension system introduced in the 1980s\nlargely with World Bank assistance. This system\u2019s centralized and hierarchical approach targets\nassistance to powerful landlords and larger farmers. Small farmers and women are often ignored.\nIn addition, provincial extension workers, both field workers and agriculture officers at the union\ncouncil level, suffer from lack of funds and mobility and poor linkage with research workers and\navailable technologies. Extension is not coordinated, and each line department at the district level\nand below conducts its own separate extension services. Field workers and agriculture officers\nhave no expertise in organizing small farmers into groups and adopting participatory, bottom-up\nplanning procedures. The World Bank\u2019s Implementation Completion Report for the Agricultural\nResearch II Project (December 1998) found little overall improvement in extension and research\nlinkages. However, the Punjab Government is experimenting with several new initiatives that\nshow considerable promise. Among them is the Model Union Council Project, which works with\nthe leading NGOs in Punjab, the Punjab Rural Support Program, and the National Rural Support\nProgram. The Model Union Council Project has been implemented for one year.\n44. Another alternative to the T&V system that has been successfully replicated throughout\nSoutheast  Asia  (notably  in  Indonesia,  Philippines,  and  Viet  Nam)  is  the  farmer  field  school\napproach to problem solving with groups of farmers. This approach has been implemented in 10\nvillages of Vehari District of Punjab since 1997, and is based on group training mechanisms.\nHand-picked agriculture officers are trained by experienced agriculture officers from Southeast\nAsia in management and key agriculture skills to work with groups of farmers in problem solving.\nAn interesting feature of this approach is that farmers typically choose to use lower levels of inputs\n(pesticides, herbicides, and chemical fertilizers) in the first year, with an immediate benefit in yield\nincrease. They also save money on input use. In the second year, more emphasis is placed on\ncareful crop management and use of inputs to increase the productivity of crops and livestock. In\nSoutheast Asia, some extension services are being privatized as the skills and value of the\nagriculture officers increase, and they voluntarily leave government service to commercially sell\ntheir services to groups of farmers. This program has also been replicated on a modest scale in\nPunjab and Sindh since 2000 in connection with an integrated pest management program under\nMINFAL with financing from ADB.19\n45. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Pilot Food Security Program also uses the\nfarmer field school and group-based extension approach, but is focused on using existing water\nuser associations. These associations are usually dormant after watercourse improvements under\ngovernment programs, and the objective is to make them operational again for crop and livestock\nproductivity improvements.\n                  \n19 TA 3383-PAK: Integrated Pest Management, for $500,000, approved on 28 December 1999, and expected to be\ncompleted on 31 March 2003.", "15\n8. Research\n46. Pakistan  has  a  sizable  network  of  national  and  provincial  research  institutions.  The\nresearch and extension system was originally unified in the agricultural universities patterned after\nthe  United  States  land  grant  model.  But  in  1961,  research,  extension,  and  education  were\ndelinked and given to the provincial governments. PARC under MINFAL coordinates national\nresearch.  PARC  provides  funding  and  supervision  monitoring  to  its  affiliate,  the  National\nAgricultural Research Council (NARC), in the areas of crops, machinery, natural resources,\nanimal sciences, and social sciences, and to four other research institutes. MINFAL supports not\nonly PARC but also research institutes in cotton, marketing, forestry, soils, and zoology. The\nPakistan Atomic Energy Commission also conducts research in the major crops. There are also\nnumerous research institutes at the provincial level in the areas of crops, soils, insects, diseases,\nlivestock,  fisheries,  forestry,  irrigation,  and  economics:  41  in  Punjab,  10  in  Sindh,  10  in\nBalochistan, and 6 in NWFP. In addition, the major agricultural universities in Punjab, Sindh, and\nNWFP are conducting agricultural research. The private sector is also conducting research but\nlacks funding. There is little sharing or coordinating of research findings. Funding for research is a\nproblem with all institutions, and most spend 70-90 percent of their available funds on salaries and\nexpenses. Funding for public sector research has fallen from PRs600 million in 1995, to PRs355\nmillion in 1999. Trained staff and infrastructure exist, but the priorities and linkages between\nresearch and extension are very weak. There is little focus on integrating available information\nand technologies into packages for small farmers. Research institutes are not allowed to sell their\ngenetic  materials  to  private  seed  companies  despite  the  high  demand,  particularly  for  new\nvarieties; nor are they allowed to retain part of the royalties to help meet the funding gaps.\nD. Government Objectives, Strategies, and Plans\n47.  The  Government  is  cognizant  that  agricultural  development  is  vital  in  reviving  the\neconomy  and  reducing  poverty.  The  Government  aims  to  achieve  robust  and  sustainable\ngrowth through efficient import substitution, export orientation, and enhanced productivity. With\nthese key objectives, the main element is to accelerate growth by enhancing per hectare\nproductivity through price incentives, support services, and market reforms. In this way, the\nGovernment  hopes  to  increase  profitability  for  small  farmers.  Attention  will  be  focused  on\nincreasing the production of wheat, cotton, and rice through remunerative market-based prices;\nevolving new technologies through research; help improving marketing and storage facilities,\nboth in the public and the private sectors; and providing access to optimum technologies to the\nfarmers, especially to small and marginal farmers.\n48. The  Economic  Advisory  Board  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  has  prepared  an\nEconomic Revival Program (February 2001). It was recognized that increasing growth in the\nagriculture sector would assure significant poverty reduction in rural areas. In addition, MINFAL\nprepared \u201cAgricultural Strategies for the First Decade of New Millennium\u201d (June 2000), which\nwas approved by the Government in March 2001. TA 3229-PAK (footnote 1) contributed to this\ndocument. This strategy recognizes that agricultural production has stagnated and is no longer\nkeeping pace with population growth. In response, the strategy sets goals at achieving an\nannual rate of production increase averaging 5 percent and achieving food security and self-\nreliance by 2010. The document also highlights the failures in extension and research services\nand the resulting poor yields especially on small farms.\n49. The Government is moving towards market-based agricultural output. It has decided to\nphase out price supports and subsidies. To help safeguard the interest of farmers against\ndeclines in prices during post-harvest periods, the Government is promoting increased exports,\nprivate competition, and joint farmer storage and marketing activities. The primary constraints", "16\nbeing addressed are inadequate farm-to-market roads; fragmented markets; lack of proper\nstorage, transportation, and processing facilities; and inadequate market information. To support\nexports and investment, the Government is providing PRs99 billion in 2001-2002 exclusively for\nthe private sector in five priority areas, including agriculture. Priority areas in agriculture have\nbeen identified as exports, storage, processing, and marketing. In addition, the State Bank of\nPakistan lowered the margin or collateral requirement in 2001 from 75 percent to 10 percent for\nflour mills and processors, and to 15 percent for growers.\n50. To safeguard poor consumers of foodgrains, the Government is developing targeted,\ndirect subsidy programs such as (i) the Khushhal Pakistan Program (small public works) for\nPRs30 billion budgeted for 2002, (ii) the Food Support Program for PRs2.5 billion in 2001 and\nPRs2.9 billion in 2002, and (iii) the Zakat Fund for PRs3.5 billion in 2001.\n51. Water  management  constitutes  a  significant  plank  of  the  Government\u2019s  strategy,\nheightened by the drought in many parts of the country. Desilting of canals, lining of irrigation\ncanals and watercourses, and renovation of watercourses are immediate priorities. For rainfed\nareas, schemes of water harvesting, utilization of small dams, and rejuvenation of farmers\u2019\nminidam schemes are already being implemented. For livestock and fisheries, the emphasis is\non enhancing quality and productivity through genetic improvement, ensuring availability of\nimproved feed and fodder, and comprehensive disease and pollution control. Privatization has\nbeen  identified  as  key  to  better  services.  Value  addition  in  agriculture  will  be  consciously\npromoted through proactive measures to promote rural enterprises through advisory services\nand access to finance.\n52. Regarding economic reforms, under the Three-Year Poverty Reduction Program, 2001-\n2004, a substantial increase in private sector development and participation is called for, including\nin the agriculture sector. The agriculture sector should be revitalized through increased emphasis\nand reforms in pricing policy, marketing, research, extension, water management, and drainage.\nThe strategy also encourages self-sufficiency in wheat, sugar, edible oils, and pulses, so that\nimports of agricultural commodities can be eliminated. Regarding physical asset creation for the\npoor, the strategy encourages increased allocation of available state land to the landless poor,\nand  the  promotion  of  microfinance  through  ongoing  programs  including  the  Microfinance  or\nKhushali  Bank20  and  support  to  NGOs  through  the  Pakistan  Poverty  Alleviation  Fund  (with\nassistance from the World Bank).\nE. External Assistance to the Sector\n53. To assist the Government\u2019s reform efforts and to provide balance of payments support,\nIMF  approved  a  standby  arrangement  amounting  to  $596  million  in  November  2000.\nDiscussions are ongoing for a comprehensive multiyear package under the PRGF, and IMF\nboard consideration is scheduled for the third week of November 2001. ADB is coordinating with\nIMF and the World Bank to ensure that the policy reforms supported by the Program are an\nintegral component of the policy framework paper supported by the PRGF.\n54. For several years, the Government has been undertaking policy reforms in the agriculture\nsector. Many of the significant reforms were carried out under ADB-funded loans, such as the\n                  \n20 Being assisted through Loans 1805-PAK(SF) and 1806-PAK(SF): Microfinance Sector Development Program, for\n$150 million, approved on 13 December 2000.", "17\nAgriculture Inputs Program21 and the Agriculture Program.22 The focus of these policy reforms has\nbeen to eliminate producer and consumption subsidies, progressively eliminate subsidized credit,\nstreamline  and  improve  the  collection  of  agricultural  taxation,  and  improve  crop  productivity\nthrough increased and timely availability of agricultural inputs, including water. Under the National\nDrainage (Sector) Project,23 ADB is supporting policy reforms in the drainage and irrigation sector.\nADB also assists the agriculture sector through area and rural development projects that include\ncomponents of agriculture, livestock, on-farm water management, rural electrification, rural water\nsupply, forestry, rural roads, and microfinance services using NGOs.24 Details are in Appendix 3.\n55. ADB provided three lines of credit to the Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan\n(ADBP) to enhance the supply of agricultural credit.25 ADB is supporting the Microfinance or\nKhushali Bank through the Microfinance Sector Development Program.26 Nearly 50 percent of the\ncredit facilities from the Khushali Bank will be for crop production, and the balance is likely to be\ndivided  among  livestock  and  farm-related  income-generating  activities.  The  program  is  also\nfinancing an external audit of ADBP aimed at reforming ADBP. In the other sectors related to\nagriculture, the ADB-funded Capital Market Development Program,27 Trade Export Promotion\nand Industry Program,28 and Small and Medium Trade Enhancement Finance Project29 aim to\nassist Pakistan attain higher and sustainable private sector and export-led growth through\ncomprehensive  policies  and  innovative  financing.  These  are  expected  to  facilitate  exports,\nincluding agriculture and processed goods, that comprise the major exports of Pakistan, and\nhelp integrate the country with the global economy.\n56. In addition to jointly financing the National Drainage Project and the Agricultural Credit\nProject, the World Bank has provided assistance to ADBP since 1965 through six credit lines. The\nFinancial  Sector  Adjustment  Loan  for  $150  million,  approved  in  1989,  strengthened  the\ncompetitiveness of the banking system by recapitalizing and restructuring commercial banks. The\nPublic  Sector  Structural  Adjustment  Loan  of  $350  million  aims  to  improve  public  sector\ngovernance in the key areas of banking, tax administration, public utilities, and public expenditure.\nThe  Financial  Sector  Deepening  and  Intermediation  Project  is  providing  TA  for  institutional\nbuilding.  In  addition,  the  Banking  Sector  Adjustment  Loan  for  $250  million,  currently  being\ndiscussed with the Government, is being designed to support ongoing banking reforms. The\nWorld Bank is assisting the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund and its financial support to selected\nNGOs  through  the  Poverty  Alleviation  Fund  Project  for  $90  million.  The  On-farm  Water\nManagement Project of the World Bank has been approved for NWFP. Similar on-farm projects\nare under preparation for other provinces. Since 1978, the World Bank has funded six agricultural\nextension and research projects to sustain increases in agricultural production and strengthen the\n                  \n21 Loans 825-PAK(SF) and 826-PAK, for $150 million, approved on 18 December 1986.\n22 Loan 1062-PAK(SF), for $200 million, approved on 11 December 1990, and completed on 30 June 1994.\n23 Loan 1413-PAK(SF), for $140 million, approved on 21 November 1995.\n24  Including  Loan  1467-PAK(SF):  Bahawalpur Rural Development Project,  for  $38  million,  approved  on  26\nSeptember 1996; Loan 1531-PAK(SF): Dera Ghazi Khan Rural Development Project, for $36 million, approved on\n4 September 1997; Loan 1672-PAK(SF): Malakand Rural Development Project, for $41 million, approved on 18\nMarch 1999; and Loan 1787-PAK(SF): NWFP Barani Area Development Project, for $52 million, approved on 28\nNovember 2000.\n25  Loan  617-PAK(SF): Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan Project,  for  $50  million,  approved  on  23\nDecember 1982; Loans 810-PAK(SF) and 811-PAK: Second Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan Project,\nfor $50 million, approved on 4 December 1986; and  Loan 1044-PAK(SF): Agricultural Credit Project, for $150\nmillion, approved on  14 December 1990.\n26  Loan 1805-PAK(SF) and 1806-PAK(SF), for $150 million, approved on 13 December 2000.\n27 Loan 1576-PAK, for $250 million, approved on 6 November 1997.\n28  Loan 1680-PAK, for $300 million, approved on 31 March 1999.\n29  Loan 1796-PAK, for $150 million, approved on 7 December 2000.", "18\nT&V system, both nationwide and separately for Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan.\n57. FAO has been mainly providing TA in the development of agriculture through various\nsmall-scale projects to improve food security, including improvements to farm productivity and\nfarm-level technological innovations. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation  (JBIC) has\nfunded the Punjab Province Agricultural Land Development Project (1978), and the Agriculture\nCredit Program (1992). It has also funded four projects to improve irrigation and drainage\nfacilities, including the National Drainage Program (1995). In the area of rural development,\nJBIC\u2019s assistance includes rural electrification and rural roads. The United Nations Development\nProgramme, the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, and the\nNetherlands Development Assistance have also financed area development projects supporting\nimproved farming practices, community development, and linking communities with sources of\nassistance.\nF. ADB's Sector Strategy\n58. The  country  operational  framework  for  Pakistan  links  poverty  reduction  to  social\nservices, agriculture and rural development, microfinance, development of social infrastructure,\nreforms  in  finance  and  industry  sectors,  and  good  governance.  Consistent  with  the\nGovernment\u2019s  assessment,  ADB  considers  agriculture  as  the  most  important  sector  for\nemployment generation. Reforms to achieve a sustainable production and marketing system,\nmodernization and diversification to improve competitiveness and higher value addition, and a\nsupportive  policy  and  institutional  environment  for  private  investment  are  considered  key\nelements to realize the employment generation potential. In the longer term, constraints that\nneed  to  be  removed  include  imperfections  in  land  markets  and  land  distribution,  irrigation\ninefficiencies and increasing deterioration in land quality, an inadequate rural transport network,\ninefficiencies  in  public  sector  marketing  of  agricultural  inputs  and  outputs,  poor  quality  of\nresearch and extension, and restricted access to credit by small farmers.\n59. Agriculture is also important in the context of rural development and poverty reduction.\nCommunity-based and multisector area development projects focusing on farm and nonfarm\nincome-generating opportunities have proven be successful in poverty reduction. A number of\nrural  development  programs  have  been  included  in  the  pipeline  to  leverage  the  reforms\nsupported  by  this  Program.  However,  success  also  depends  upon  effective  targeting  and\ncommunity-based participatory approaches.\n60. ADB's strategy is supportive of the Government's strategy and program for poverty\nreduction. While the Government has initiated a number of positive structural reforms since\n1999, Pakistan remains in crisis, with modest growth, high levels of debt, low foreign exchange\nreserves, a slowdown in exports, and severe pressures on the fiscal deficit. On a positive note\nthe Government has been spurred to consider actions and embrace agendas that only a few\nyears ago would not have been considered. To support pro-poor growth, ADB's focus will be on\n(i) promoting private sector development, (ii) encouraging growth in employment-generating\nsectors such as agriculture and small and medium enterprises, and (iii) building infrastructure.\nFor social development the focus will be on (i) the development of human capital by increasing\nthe quality of primary education and basic reproductive health care, and (ii) gender development\nto reduce gaps in key social indicators by improving female access to education and health\ncare,  among  others.  For  good  governance  the  focus  will  be  on  (i)  support  for  fiscal\ndecentralization  and  management,  (ii)  reorientation  of  public  expenditures  to  the  poor,  (iii)\nreform of civil service, (iv) restructuring of loss-incurring SOEs, and (v) development of efficient\ncapital markets and good corporate governance.", "19\nG.  Lessons Learned\n61. The program performance audit reports (PPAR) of the previous Agriculture Program\nidentified  important  lessons,  which  have  been  incorporated  in  the  design  of  the  proposed\nProgram.  These  lessons  may  be  grouped  as  (i)  program  prioritization  and  design,  (ii)\nimplementation and timing of politically sensitive reforms, and (iii) program linkages. In addition,\nlessons from other agencies' experiences in the provision of farmer support services have been\ndrawn upon extensively.\n1.  Program Prioritization and Design\n62. The PPAR noted that the first Agriculture Program was based on insufficient sector\nanalysis, contained too many reform measures, and covered too many agriculture subsectors,\ntreating each too broadly to bring about meaningful changes. Thus, that program showed\ninadequate focus, a lack of specificity and prioritization in the reform measures, and a failure to\nset clear targets and performance indicators. In response, the proposed Program has been\nbased on detailed diagnostic analyses of critical sector constraints that began during the project\npreparatory TA and continued through loan processing. Based on the earlier lessons, the\nProgram has intentionally avoided areas of reform which, while important for long-run growth of\nthe sector, will be more effectively addressed over a longer timeframe and through alternative\nlending modalities.30 The design of the Program reflects a much tighter focus on the critical\nareas of market liberalization for key crops and inputs, reduction of budgetary costs for state\ninterventions in these markets, and sharper targeting of support services for small farmers. The\nProgram also entails (i) a clear set of targets and performance indicators, including the size of\nthe Strategic Reserve of wheat; (ii) downsizing of existing public procurement and storage\nprograms; (iii) crop prices, production, and distribution; and (iv) budgetary allocations for staff\nretrenchment and small farmer and rural support programs. Close monitoring of the Program\u2019s\nimplementation  and  impacts  will  be  undertaken  jointly  by  the  Government,  ADB,  and\nindependent research agencies (paras. 93 and 98).\n2.  Implementation and Timing of Politically Sensitive Reforms\n63. The PPAR also recommended that a phased, step-by-step approach to program design\nand implementation is required in a traditional society like Pakistan, where there remain many\npolitically  well-connected  interest  groups  and  limited  governance  capacity.  The  proposed\nProgram has addressed this concern in four ways. First, detailed preparation was undertaken\nwith a comprehensive TA. During the TA and subsequent loan processing, extensive provincial\nconsultations were undertaken with government and nongovernment stakeholders in order to\nencourage understanding and ownership of the Program (para. 88). Second, in light of these\nconsultations, a five-year period of implementation is planned, with three loan tranches to be\ncarefully sequenced in accordance with Federal and provincial government commitments to fully\nimplement the Program. About three years will be required for implementation of the core policy\nagenda, and an additional two years will be required to allow flexibility and ensure adequate\n                  \n30  Two important examples include agricultural taxation and the water resource subsector. Enhanced and more\nequitable taxation of agriculture will require strong political commitment and considerable strengthening of local\ninstitutional capacity for tax assessment and collection. Agricultural taxes will be comprehensively addressed\nunder the IMF's proposed multiyear PRGF (para. 53). Similarly, issues related to integrated water resource\nmanagement in Pakistan require a longer term approach, combining policy dialogue with physical investment,\ninstitutional development, and capacity building for more sustainable management of irrigation and drainage\ninfrastructure. These needs are being comprehensively addressed through a variety of ongoing projects financed\nby ADB and other agencies, such as the National Drainage (Sector) Project (para. 54).", "20\nmonitoring.  Third,  a  proposed  TA  loan  will  assist  the  Federal  and  local  stakeholders  to\neffectively implement, sequence, and monitor the reforms (paras. 99-104). Fourth, local political\ncommitment to the reforms has been strengthened by targeted allocation of counterpart funds to\nthe provinces for the purpose of absorbing many adjustment costs of the reform program. A\ncluster loan approach was considered during the design of the Program, but the Government\nindicated a preference for retaining this package of reforms under a single program that would\nbe implemented in phases over a longer period than the previous agriculture program.\n3.  Program Linkages\n64. The PPAR noted that program reforms should be prioritized based on sector needs and\nADB\u2019s strategic objectives, and that the linkage between reforms must be clearly identified. As\nnoted above, the Program has been designed based on detailed analysis of sector constraints,\npreparation of a detailed problem and objective tree analysis, identification of reform priorities,\nand analysis of the complementarities with ongoing operations in the sector financed by ADB\nand other agencies. The proposed Program is also complementary with the Government\u2019s\nThree-Year  Poverty  Reduction  Programme  2001-2004  (para.  15),  and  with  ADB\u2019s  broader\ncountry  operational  framework,  which  promotes  sustainable  growth  and  poverty  reduction\nthrough improvement of economic efficiency and export competitiveness, human and social\ndevelopment, good governance, and institutional strengthening. Linkage between reforms has\nbeen carefully assessed to enhance their combined impacts (e.g., by linking the expected price\nand supply effects of market liberalization to the redesign of programs for small farmer research\nand extension).\n4.  Lessons from Other Aid Agencies' Experiences\n65. To ensure that agricultural support services are more effective in meeting the needs of\nsmall farmers, the lessons learned from earlier and ongoing externally supported programs\nhave  also  been  considered.  These  include  the  World  Bank-supported  T&V  Program  for\nextension, the United States Agency for International Development-supported farming system\nresearch approach, and ongoing and completed externally supported activities including the\nFAO-funded Farmer Field Schools and Pilot Food Security Program. Most of these models and\napproaches are either ineffective or unsustainable. Some of their major shortcomings include (i)\nintensive capital and human resources at the top, (ii) weak governance structures, (iii) lack of a\ndemand-driven approach, (iv) inadequate training and incentives for middle level and field\nextension staff, (v) weak interface between research and farmers, and (vi) lack of a replicable\nand cost-effective strategy. The TA will assist the Government in (i) conducting studies and\naction plans for institutional reforms to improve governance and autonomy for the research\nsystem,  accountability  to  the  stakeholders,  responsiveness  to  end-users'  needs,  and\naccessibility  to  small  and  poor  farmers;  and  (ii)  assessing  the  feasibility  of  integrating\nagricultural research, education, and extension such that it is cost effective, responsive to\nimproving productivity and efficiency, and financially sustainable.\nV. THE PROGRAM\nA. Rationale\n66. Sustainable growth of the agriculture sector is a prerequisite for economic growth and\npoverty reduction in Pakistan. The agriculture sector employs about 50 percent of the labor\nforce and generates 70 percent of export revenues. Two thirds of the population and about 75\npercent of the poor live in rural areas. Although agricultural income accounts for just half of the\ntotal rural income, dependence of the poor on agriculture is much greater because of the strong\nlinkages between the farm and nonfarm sectors. The increase in the number of poor during the", "21\nlast  decade  is  partly  a  result  of  declining  productivity,  decreasing  rural  employment,  and\nstagnating household income.\n67. Pakistan has made progress in liberalizing agricultural markets and prices in recent\nyears. However, further progress is still needed to enhance the real growth of the agriculture\nsector as the productivity of most crops is low. This has affected both the upstream linkages for\nfarm inputs, such as seeds, fertilizers, and machinery, and the downstream linkages to agro-\nprocessing and related industries. Despite the moves towards market liberalization during the\n1990s, direct intervention by the Government in agricultural markets remains excessive. This\nhas adversely affected sustainable increases in production and crowded out private sector\ninvolvement. Government pricing and marketing interventions on the one hand and private\nsector cartels and market failures on the other hand have led to low producer prices, low farm\nprofitability,  and  dampened  productivity  growth.  Government  subsidies  are  expensive  to\nmaintain and do not typically benefit the target beneficiaries, the small and marginal farmers.\nThe research and extension systems and institutions are outdated and weak. These distortions\ninfluence the productivity and profitability of the major agricultural commodities, including wheat,\ncotton, rice, and sugar; adversely impact on the well-being of the vast majority of small farmers\nand the rural poor; and restrain overall economic growth.\n68. Pakistan is in the midst of a structural adjustment program, with poverty reduction as the\nkey goal and revitalization of the agriculture sector as a key component in the export-led\nstrategy. The Government intends to redefine its role in the agriculture sector to ensure the\nsmooth functioning of markets, promote private sector activities, and adjust public expenditures\nin agriculture more on public goods and market failures and less on agricultural production and\nmarketing activities. Consistent with the overall goals of adjustment, these reforms aim to\nexpand the role of the private sector through deregulation, liberalization, and privatization,\naffecting many public input supply and output marketing enterprises that now operate in the\nagriculture sector. The envisaged adjustment will phase out Government control of activities in\nagricultural production and marketing that the private sector is better equipped to handle. The\nagricultural subsidy regime that has compounded fiscal difficulties and skewed the benefits of\ngrowth and investment away from the needy will be dismantled to correspondingly increase\nsocial sector investments.\n69. The  Government\u2019s  acknowledgement  of  the  seriousness  with  which  the  sector\u2019s\nstructural issues need to be addressed is reflected in the intense dialogue with IMF, the World\nBank, and ADB; public participation; and involvement of other external agencies in designing\nthe Program to set the stage for sustainable growth in the long run. The Government has\ndemonstrated its firm commitment to the Program by initiating action in several key areas\nincluding (i) reducing the public sector procurement and marketing of wheat, (ii) expanding the\nrole of the private sector in wheat and seeds, (iii) phasing out the costly wheat subsidy program,\n(iv) ensuring free movement of wheat and other commodities, (v) allowing unrestricted import\nand export of major commodities, and (vi) allowing free access to breeder seed from research\ninstitutions.\n70. To be firmly placed on a sustainable growth path in order to reduce poverty, Pakistan\nrequires  wide  and  deep  reforms  in  all  the  major  economic  sectors.  The  major  challenge,\nhowever, is to implement the reforms in major economic sectors and reduce fiscal deficits.\nReforms in the agriculture sector are critically needed to ensure the success of all reforms, as\nwell  as  to  enhance  the  sector's  ability  to  provide  sustainable  means  of  livelihood  to\napproximately  half  of  the  country\u2019s  labor  force.  The  costs  of  implementing  these  reforms,\nhowever,  are  substantial  and  so  would  be  the  benefits  when  the  reforms  are  effectively\nimplemented. With the limited fiscal maneuverability of the Government, it will be difficult to", "22\nmeet  the  short-term  adjustment  costs  (paras.  91  and  92)  of  the  reform  agenda  without\nsignificant external assistance. The Government has, therefore, requested ADB support to\nundertake  the  reforms,  which  are  well  anchored  in  and  integral  to  the  ongoing  structural\nchanges in the macroeconomy, and to implement the Program. The implementation period is\nfive years, given the Government's commitment to these difficult reforms and increased private\nsector involvement, coupled with the need to replace ineffective wheat subsidies to consumers\nwith better and targeted programs for small farmers and the poor. The Development Policy\nLetter describing the Government\u2019s reform measures is in Appendix 4 along with the detailed\npolicy matrix.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n71. The Program has been designed to assist the Government in addressing key constraints\nin the agriculture sector regarding productivity and profitability with an emphasis on small and\nmarginal farmers. As a result of increased productivity and profitability, it is expected that the\nProgram  will  increase  agricultural  growth  and  rural  employment  and  reduce  rural  poverty.\nBeneficiaries  will  be  provided  with  opportunities  to  increase  their  crop  yields,  productivity,\nincomes, and employment and improve their quality of life through the promotion of efficient\ncommodity markets and support services. A Program Framework is in Appendix 1, based on a\ndetailed problem and cause-effect analysis of the sector.\n72. The primary objective of the Program will be to improve agricultural productivity and\nprofitability. The Program includes specific reform measures to (i) promote efficient markets for\nthe  major  commodities,  including  wheat,  cotton,  rice,  and  sugarcane,  in  order  to  promote\nmarket-based incentives for farms, especially smallholders; (ii) liberalize markets for fertilizer\nand seed; and (iii) strengthen support services in small farmer extension and training, research,\nand regulation to improve quality control. These reforms will include (i) increased private sector\ninvolvement in the wheat market, with a planned phase-out of support prices and subsidies, and\nremoval of restrictions on internal movement, imports, and exports; (ii) increased private sector\ncompetition in cotton and rice marketing and export to overcome market imperfections; (iii)\nincreased competition in sugar production and marketing with imports; (iv) increased private\nsector competition in fertilizer imports; (v) removal of the public sector monopoly in access to\nbreeder  seeds  and  increased  private  sector  participation;  (vi)  rationalization,  increased\nautonomy, and financial self-reliance of research institutions; and (vii) increased small farmer\nfocus of extension services. Several SOEs will be restructured and/or closed down and divested\nas a result of the rationalization and private-sector orientation of the Program.\nC. Policy Framework and Actions\n1.  Improve Efficiency of Commodity Markets\na.  Remove Market Restrictions\n73. Under the proposed reforms, all restrictions on free movement of wheat and other\nagricultural commodities will be removed. As first tranche conditions, MINFAL, the Ministry of\nCommerce (MOC), and the provincial governments will (i) permanently remove all restrictions,\nexcept those related to antismuggling activities along the borders,31 on the internal movement of\nwheat and other agricultural commodities; (ii) permit free movement throughout each province of\n                  \n31  To minimize the smuggling of agricultural commodities to and from Afghanistan, Pakistan closely monitors the\nmovement of goods within 20 miles of the border.", "23\nseed certified for a particular ecological zone by the provincial governments' seed councils; and\n(iii) ensure that no new public sector seed corporation will be established in the country. At\npresent, there is a restriction on the free movement of cotton seed in order to safeguard against\nthe spread of diseases that could devastate the crop. Also as first tranche conditions, MOC will\nissue a policy announcement that (i) allows unrestricted private sector (which includes both\ndomestic and international firms) imports and exports, subject to tariffs and antidumping rules;\nand (ii) ensures that there are no nontariff barriers to private sector imports and exports of\nwheat, sugar, fertilizer, seed, cotton, and rice.\n74. A major reform program is under way in sugar marketing and processing. Farmers in the\nsugar mill zones are no longer required to sell sugarcane to the mills in their area. Farmers are\nalso not restricted from producing brown sugar and molasses. The tariff for imported sugar was\nreduced on 18 June 2001 from 15 percent to 10 percent. Under the Program, imports of sugar by\nthe private sector will be encouraged. As a first tranche condition, the Government will allow\nunrestricted  imports  of  sugar.  Also,  the  Government  will  remove  all  restrictions  on  the\nproduction, marketing, and export of brown sugar and molasses. As a second tranche condition,\nMINFAL and MOC will issue a policy announcement for (i) the permanent removal of the zoning\nof sugarcane areas and the forced sale to the nearest sugar mill, and (ii) allowing sugar mills to\nmerge and relocate. Regulations of unfair and monopsonistic practices of sugar millers and\nimporters will be improved and enforced by the Government. These measures will improve the\nefficiency of the sugar mills and ensure consumers with plentiful sugar at competitive prices. It is\nexpected that domestic production of sugar will decline over time, and farmers in the less\ncompetitive production and processing regions will replace sugarcane with more profitable crops\nsuch as wheat, cotton, and rice, and with horticulture.\n75. A free trade policy in cotton was introduced in FY1996 that removed import and export\nduties. There is a need for more competition in exports, imports, ginning, and processing. As a\nsecond  tranche  condition,  MOC  will  submit  draft  legislation  to  the  competent  authorities\nconcerning  the  grading  and  standardization  of  cotton.  This  legislation  and  implementing\nregulations will be adopted as a third tranche condition. This is expected to improve the quality\nand international competitiveness of Pakistan\u2019s cotton exports.  Also, as a second tranche\ncondition, MINFAL and the provincial governments will permit unrestricted access to and sale of\nbreeder seed from research institutes and PSC for the production of certified seed to private\nseed companies.\nb.  Improve Public Management of Strategic Reserves of Wheat\n76. The objectives of maintaining a strategic reserve of wheat are to ensure price stability to\nboth producers and consumers and to provide food security in the event of shortages or\nemergency needs. The strategic reserve or buffer stock will provide for domestic consumption\nand help offset any shortages in the market. The public food system will procure and sell a\ndeclining amount until reaching a minimum of 1.0 million tons32 or about 12.5 percent of the\nmarketed surplus, and the private sector will market the balance of wheat. As a first tranche\ncondition, MINFAL and MOC will issue policy announcements that (i) the Government will\nprocure and manage a minimum of 1.0 million tons of wheat strategic reserve (the actual\nrequirements of the strategic reserve will be determined by the Government in March and April\nof each year); (ii) PASSCO and the provincial food departments will only manage the strategic\nreserve of wheat and on a commercial and cost-effective basis; and (iii) the directorates of food\n                  \n32  This level may be adjusted below 1.0 million tons, as agreed between ADB and the Government.", "24\nin the provincial food departments of Sindh, NWFP, and Balochistan will be closed over a five-\nyear period.33 PASSCO will mainly procure, store, and distribute strategic reserves of wheat, but\nother agriculture commodities may be marketed on a commercial and case-by-case basis, and\nonly when special circumstances warrant. All other agricultural commodities and the remaining\nquantities of wheat will be freely traded in open domestic markets. PASSCO will be allowed to\nexport wheat with TCP. The provincial governments will have representation on the board of\nPASSCO. These measures and the permanent removal of restrictions on the internal movement\nof wheat will ensure a higher price to the farmer and improved availability throughout the\ncountry.\n77. For wheat and the other marketing components (including cotton, rice, sugar, fertilizer, and\nseeds), TA will be provided under the Program to assist the Government in (i) implementing the\npolicy reforms, (ii) establishing a market-based information system, (iii) instituting systems of\ninternationally accepted standards and grades for the exported commodities, (iv) managing the\nstrategic reserve and reducing costs, and (v) providing capacity building and training to promote\nmarket reforms and quality standards for exports. The TA will also assist the private sector with (i)\nexports and market performance, (ii) quality control, (iii) storage, and (iv) a possible revival of the\nwheat and cotton futures markets. Details are provided in Chapter VII.\nc.  Phase Out Commodity Price Supports and Subsidies\n78. APCOM under MINFAL will continue to recommend support prices to the Government.\nRegarding support prices for wheat, and as a first tranche condition, MINFAL and MOC will\nissue a policy announcement that (i) the issue price for sale of wheat to flour mills will not be\nuniform throughout the year, but will be allowed to increase seasonally to reflect storage costs;\nand (ii) the issue price will be phased out and replaced by a sales price that reflects the\nprocurement price plus the full costs of storage, distribution, and management. Regarding\nsubsidies on wheat, MINFAL and MOC will issue a policy announcement that the basis for the\nprocurement price will be the international reference price (export or import parity price),34 with\nmarginal adjustments allowed to reflect changes in the cost of production. As third tranche\nconditions, the Government will eliminate (i) the consumer subsidy for wheat by moving to a\nmarket-based sales price; and (ii) the producer subsidy for wheat by moving from a support\nprice to a market-based procurement price (export or import parity price), unless otherwise\nagreed upon between ADB and the Government, except for the losses that may accrue due to\nthe minimum strategic reserve for wheat. These price measures will enable a gradual phasing\nout of the wheat consumer and producer subsidies, while also protecting wheat producers to\nsome extent from rapid and sustained price declines in the competitive market.\n                  \n33  The provincial food departments perform two major functions: (i) procurement, storage, and sale (at prices fixed\nby the Federal Government) of wheat and limited other commodities through the directorates of food (which\ncontain more than 90 percent of their total staff and assets); and (ii) regulatory services including (a) food quality\ninspection through food inspectors, and (b) price determination of essential commodities through food controllers.\nUnder the Program, the provincial food departments will be restructured, involving reorganization and possible\ndownsizing. The directorates of food in three of the food departments (Sindh, NWFP, and Balochistan) will be\nrestructured for eventual closure and divestiture over a five-year period, whereas their regulatory functions will\ncontinue operations. PASSCO and the Punjab Food Department will be restructured and will continue operation\nand management of the strategic reserve. The Punjab Food Department is needed because of the major role that\nwheat plays in the Punjab economy.\n34  This price will then be adjusted for wholesale market-to-port marketing margins, as has traditionally been done for\ncotton.", "25\n79. A first tranche policy announcement will also confirm that (i) for cotton, the Government\nwill continue to use the export parity price as the basis for the procurement price; (ii) for\nsugarcane, the Government will only announce an indicative price to be used for procurement\nby the private sugar mills, and the Government will not procure sugarcane; (iii) for rice and all\nother agricultural commodities, public procurement will be at market prices; and (iv) no new\nsubsidies will be introduced on wheat imports, public seed production and marketing, or fertilizer\nimport and marketing. The Government and the provincial governments will provide incentives\nto promote private sector and joint or cooperative farmer storage of the major commodities. As a\nsecond tranche condition, the Government will prepare and submit to ADB a plan to replace\nuntargeted wheat subsidies with targeted programs for small farmers (the small farmers plan).\nAs a third tranche condition, the Government will commence implementation of the approved\nsmall farmers plan.\nd.  Accelerate Divestiture and Restructuring of SOEs\n80. The Program will assist the federal and provincial governments in closing and divesting\nseveral SOEs in the agriculture sector that are no longer needed. Some SOEs will remain but will\nundergo considerable restructuring in order to perform more effectively in the market. As first\ntranche conditions, SASO and ADA will be closed, and the process of divestiture will be started\nby the provincial governments of Sindh and NWFP. As stated above, no new public sector seed\ncorporation will be established in the country. Private seed companies will continue to certify\ntheir seed as required by the Federal Seed Certification and Registration Department.\n81. The  Cotton  Export  Corporation  and  the  Rice  Export  Corporation  of  Pakistan  have\nalready been closed, and in January 2001 they were merged with TCP. Also, as a first tranche\ncondition, MOC will end all budgetary support, subsidies, and preferential credit at subsidized\ninterest rates for TCP, and ensure that TCP competes on equal terms with private companies.\nSupport prices announced by APCOM will act only as market reference prices and not as public\nprocurement prices. If TCP procures wheat, cotton, and rice, it will be primarily for export and at\nopen  market  or  export  parity  prices.  These  measures  will  expand  exports  at  international\nstandards and help ensure higher prices to farmers. If TCP procures wheat, cotton, and rice, it\nwill be at open market or international preference prices.\n82. As a second tranche condition, MINFAL and the provincial governments will submit plans\nto ADB to reorganize and downsize PASSCO and the provincial food departments to operate on\nmarket-oriented lines and compete on equal terms with the private sector (the PASSCO and\nProvincial  Food  Department  Restructuring  Plans),  and  begin  implementation  (including\nupgrading and leasing storage facilities). Also as second tranche conditions, (i) MINFAL will\nclose FID, responsible in the past for fertilizer imports, and the Directorate of Food, responsible\nfor wheat imports, and begin the process of divestiture; and (ii) the Sindh Government will\nannounce a plan and a timetable to close SSC. Divestiture will entail leasing or selling assets to\nthe  private  sector  (i.e.,  sale  of  stocks  and  lease  of  storage  facilities),  settlement  of  all\noutstanding claims and debt, and assigning staff to the provincial surplus pool.35 It has been\nagreed that the proceeds of the Loan under the Program will be made available by the Federal\nGovernment to the provinces on the same terms and conditions to assist in closing these and\nother SOEs under the Program. Also as a second tranche condition, the Government and the\n                  \n35  In lieu of assigning staff to the surplus pool, the provinces may elect to offer staff a voluntary retirement scheme,\ndepending on the availability of funds and a firm policy on retrenchment. A proposal being considered at the\nFederal level is a payment of 3-5 years of salary and benefits on a monthly basis, instead of a lump sum, with\npermission granted to the staff to work in the private sector during the period of monthly payments.", "26\nprovincial  governments  will  issue  policy  announcements  that  all  staff  affected  under  this\nProgram (both public servants and public corporation staff) will either be placed in the surplus\npool or provided with a severance package consistent with the Government's guidelines. As\nanother second tranche condition, MOC will ensure that TCP is operating on a commercial\nbasis without any budgetary support, subsidies, or exclusive preferential credit in wheat, cotton,\nand rice exports. These measures will increase the market share of the private sector in wheat,\ncotton, and rice marketing.\n83. As third tranche conditions, the Government will cause the Provincial governments to (i)\ncomplete the implementation of the agreed upon PASSCO and provincial food department\nreorganization  plans,  including  provision  of  severance  packages  consistent  with  the\nGovernment's  guidelines;  (ii)  close  the  provincial  food  departments  of  Sindh,  NWFP,  and\nBalochistan and SSC, and begin the process of divesting them; and (iii) end all budgetary\nsupport, subsidies, and preferential credit for PASSCO, except for the costs of managing the\nminimum wheat strategic reserve.\n2.  Strengthen Support Services\na.  Accelerate the Provision of Agricultural Support Services\n84. As a first tranche condition, MOF and MINFAL will issue a statement that the proceeds of\nthe Loan under this Program will be made available for onlending to the provincial governments\non the same terms and conditions as those of the Program Loan, with the Federal Government\nbearing the entire foreign exchange risk, for the purpose of upgrading storage facilities and\nfinancing any staff severance programs, and for programs focusing on small farmers, including\nresearch and extension programs. As second tranche conditions (i) MOC and the provincial\ngovernments  will  make  a  determination  (the  financing  determination)  regarding  financing,\nthrough the provincial trust funds, joint NGO activities, and extension agent programs with a\nfocus on small farmers; and (ii) the Sindh Government will finance, through the provincial trust\nfunds,  a  Sindh  Rural  Support  Program,  similar  to  those  programs  in  the  other  provinces.\nProvincial governments will also promote group-based small farmer storage and marketing\nefforts in order to reduce the dependence on middlemen during the harvest and to obtain higher\nprices. This will increase the scope for private sector competition in agricultural markets. As a\nthird  tranche  condition,  the  provincial  governments  will  finance  new  initiatives  agricultural\nresearch, extension, and higher education by using some of the local currency funds in the\nprovincial trust funds. These funds are additional to annual budgetary funds received by the\nprovinces.\nb. Accelerate the Strengthening and Coordination of Agricultural\nSupport Services\n85. Major  reforms  are  planned  in  agricultural  research.  As  a  second  tranche  condition,\nresearch institutes will be allowed to sell breeder seed to private companies. In addition to\nfinancing innovate extension and small farmer training activities, another potential use of the\nProgram Loan proceeds is innovative research programs to support small farmer development.\nAlso as second tranche conditions (i) the provincial governments will study the feasibility and\nprepare plans (the research institutes plans) to make provincial research institutes autonomous\nand allow them to retain the royalties earned from the sale of seed; (ii) MINFAL and the\nprovincial governments will study the feasibility of reorganizing and strengthening the delivery\nand  coordination  of  agricultural  research,  extension,  and  higher  education  services  (the\nagricultural support service plans); and (iii) MINFAL will prepare and submit for cabinet approval\na plan to substantially reorganize and right-size PARC and NARC (the research councils plan)", "27\nto focus on research coordination with the provinces and special national topics dealing with\nupstream research such as biotechnology. As third tranche conditions, the Government and the\nprovincial  governments  will,  subject  to  the  results  of  the  relevant  study  and  their  joint\nagreement, commence implementation of (i) the research institute plans, (ii) the agricultural\nsupport service plans, and (iii) the research councils plan.\nc.  Quality Control and Regulation Measures\n86. As first tranche conditions, MINFAL will prepare (i) an ordinance on fertilizer regulation,\nand (ii) draft legislation for the regulation and control of agricultural chemicals (including revision\nof the Environmental Protection Act of 1997) to establish legal responsibilities for the handling,\ntransport, storage, and disposal of agricultural chemicals for Government and ADB review. As\nsecond tranche conditions, the Government and the provincial governments will ensure that (i)\nsuppliers of imported fertilizer certify the nutrient contents at the point of origin, and (ii) private\nthird-party laboratories, certified by the Government, are allowed to certify quality at the retail\nlevel for fertilizer and seed, subject to existing Government regulations. Also, MINFAL will\nsubmit (i) the ordinance on fertilizer regulation for promulgation to the cabinet, and (ii) the draft\nlegislation on agricultural chemical regulation to the national assembly.\nD. Social and Environmental Issues\n87. The Program will address policy issues that are presently impeding the performance of\nthe agriculture sector and have significant socioeconomic, poverty-related, and environmental-\nadverse impacts. These issues include (i) inadequate role of the private sector in commodity\ntrade, overshadowed by an inefficient and overstaffed public sector, and in the procurement,\nmarketing, and distribution of agricultural inputs and food grains; (ii) inadequate and ineffective\nregulatory mechanisms, and ill-defined standards and specifications for inputs and farm produce\nto  ensure  quality;  (iii)  ineffective  research  and  extension  services  that  are  top  down  and\ninaccessible  to  small  and  poor  farmers;  (iv)  unsatisfactory  performance,  overstaffing,  and\noverlapping functions and mandates of Federal level research and marketing institutions; (v)\ninadequate  funding  to  target  the  poor  and  marginalized  households;  and  (vi)  absence  of\nmonitoring mechanisms and plans to mitigate possible adverse socioeconomic, physical, and\nbiological impacts from increased use of agrochemicals and other increased agroprocessing\nactivities.\n88. To encourage the role of the private sector, the inefficient public sector trading and\nmarketing organizations will be divested, and, where necessary, their roles and budgetary\nsupport will be reduced. Moreover, credit facilities will be allocated to the private sector to invest\nin expanding marketing linkages. Similarly, monitoring mechanisms to regulate major markets\nand prices will be instituted to ensure the quality of inputs and outputs, and to mitigate any\nadverse environmental impacts. To ensure improved and effective support services, institutional\nrestructuring will be carried out to make research and extension agencies demand driven and\ncost  effective.  Similarly,  research  institutions  will  be  restructured  to  avoid  any  overlapping\nfunctions and wasteful expenditure. Support will be provided to enhance the implementation\ncapacity of the institutions to provide support for marginalized and poor consumers. The major\nimpacts of the Program are provided in Chapter VIII. Details of the major impacts and public\nconsultations are in Appendix 5.", "28\nVI. THE PROPOSED LOANS\nA. Amount of Loans and Source of Funds\n89. Three loans totaling $350 million equivalent are required: (i) a loan in an amount of\nSDR96,238,000 ($123 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources36 to the Islamic\nRepublic of Pakistan, with a term of 24 years maturity, including a grace period of 8 years, with an\ninterest rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum during\nthe amortization period; (ii) a loan in an amount of Y27,643,500,000 ($225 million equivalent) from\nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, with a term of 15 years\nmaturity, including a grace period of 3 years, and with interest to be determined in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s  London interbank offered rate-based loan facility; and (iii) a TA loan in an amount of\nSDR1,565,000 ($2 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources (footnote 36) to the\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan, with a term of 32 years maturity, including a grace period of 8 years,\nwith an interest rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum\nduring the amortization period.\n90. Use of low-cost funds from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources is justified in support of policy\nreforms that address complex and long-standing issues and socially significant measures to (i)\nenhance benefits to small and marginal farmers and the rural poor; (ii) free government resources\ncurrently used in misdirected and nontargeted subsidies, and (iii) improve the terms of trade for\nagriculture  on  which  the  livelihood  of  the  majority  of  the  households,  especially  the  poor,\ndepend. In addition, the adjustment costs to implement the program are substantial.\n91. An estimated net adjustment cost of about $500 million is required to catalyze the\nchanges to enhance productivity and profitability in the agriculture sector through the proposed\nreform measures. About 80 percent of the expected savings of $180 million from phasing out\nuntargeted subsidies and reducing the wheat stock to the level of the wheat strategic reserve is\nmeant  for  targeted  small  farmer  programs  including  contingency  for  safety  nets  for  poor\nhouseholds against fluctuations in the wheat price. As a result, a net savings of $30 million is\nexpected.  Restructuring  and  divestiture  of  SOEs,  including  provision  for  staff  affected  by\nreforms and upgrading storage facilities for leasing or sale, are likely to cost about $340 million\nover the five-year program period. An adjustment cost of about $180 million is expected for\nreorienting the agricultural extension, research, and education services to address small farmer\nneeds.  These  include  community-based  services,  agricultural  productivity  enhancement\nprograms, and private-public associations in the delivery of agricultural services. The cost for\nimproving quality control and regulation measures is estimated at $10 million.\n92. The  proposed  measures  have  been  phased  to  factor  in  resource  availability  during\nimplementation. The reforms will be facilitated by measures that generate savings, such as\nremoval of subsides. The budgetary implication of the proposed reform measures is expected to\nbe positive, and nonquantifiable benefits and savings are expected to be substantial. These would\naccrue through (i) lower expenses on controlling the movement, marketing, import, and export of\nagricultural commodities; (ii) efficiency gains in sugar production, increased price for cotton,\nincreased producer and private sector benefits, and increased tax revenues to the Government;\n(iii) higher efficiency and market orientation of restructured SOEs that will reduce the need for\nbudgetary support; and (iv) divestiture that will lead to recurring savings and reduced personnel\nand administration costs. The rental and sale of upgraded storage facilities could potentially\ngenerate significant revenues.\n                  \n36  Subject to the availability of Asian Development Fund resources.", "29\nB. Implementation Arrangements\n93. MOF will be the Executing Agency and will (i) coordinate with MINFAL, MOC, and the\nprovincial governments on the policy reforms; (ii) oversee compliance of tranche conditions; (iii)\nadminister the use of loan proceeds; and (iv) request ADB for tranche releases. MINFAL will be\nresponsible  for  day-to-day  implementation,  including  monitoring  the  implementation  of  the\nProgram and use of counterpart funds and evaluating the impact of the reforms on stakeholders.\nTo  facilitate  implementation,  MINFAL  will  establish,  prior  to  loan  negotiations  (i)  a  steering\ncommittee composed of senior staff from MINFAL, MOC, MOF, and the provincial planning and\ndevelopment departments (to meet at least quarterly); and (ii) a program implementation unit\n(PIU) in Islamabad, under the direction of the secretary, MINFAL. The steering committee will\nensure that the reforms are undertaken in line with the agreed upon timetable. The PIU will have\nat least three full-time staff to oversee the progress and issues relating to policy implementation.\nIn addition, the PIU will collect baseline data and continually assess program impact. Appendix 6\npresents  (i)  policy  compliance  measures  for  tranche  releases  and  (ii)  program  monitoring\nindicators.\nC. Procurement and Disbursement\n94. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items produced\nand procured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items (Appendix 7). The Government\nwill certify that (i) if the loan proceeds will finance goods already imported, the value of eligible\nimports in the period concerned will exceed the amount of the requested withdrawal; or (ii) if the\nloan proceeds finance items to be imported, the value of eligible imports in the immediately\npreceding one-year period will be equal to or greater than the amount of the requested withdrawal\nplus all other amounts expected to be withdrawn during the succeeding one-year period. All\nprocurement will be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. An audit of the use of\nthe loan proceeds will be undertaken only upon ADB\u2019s request, provided that ADB retains the right\nto (i) audit any account, and (ii) verify the validity of the certification issued by the Government for\neach withdrawal application. Prior to withdrawal, the Government will open an account with the\nState Bank of Pakistan in which all withdrawals will be deposited. The account will be managed,\noperated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.\nD. Use of Loan Proceeds\n95. The use of the local currency proceeds of the loan (counterpart funds) needs to be\nconsistent with the overall fiscal framework defined in the Government's agreement with IMF.\nSubject to this, local currency proceeds of the loan will be used by the Government to support\nthe reforms to be initiated or implemented under the Program in particular, and to redirect the\nsavings from subsidies towards social sector expenditures, which is a government commitment\nto IMF. Considering that agriculture is largely a provincial matter and the cost of the reform\nmeasures will have to be borne by the provinces, the Federal Government has agreed to\nprovide part of the counterpart funds for the provinces on the same terms and conditions as the\nADB loans, with the Federal Government bearing the entire foreign exchange risk.\n96. Allocation of part of the loan proceeds to the provinces is the first such arrangement\nunder a policy loan modality. This has been specifically introduced since the Government is\nalready implementing a time-bound administrative and financial devolution plan. The provincial\ngovernments and the Federal Government will also discuss the cost sharing for closing and\nrationalizing the SOEs. Furthermore, funds allocated to the provinces have been dedicated to\ncommunity-based research, extension, and innovations to enhance productivity. Counterpart\nfunds will therefore directly support ADB\u2019s strategic development objective for poverty reduction", "30\nand also will supplement the policy reforms with measures to enhance the productivity of small\nand poor farm households.\nE. Tranching and Monitoring\n97. The proposed ADB loans will be released in three tranches. The first tranche of $125\nmillion  equivalent  (SDR39,121,000  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund  [ADF]  and\nY9,154,500,000  from  ordinary  capital  resources  [OCR])  will  be  released  upon  loan\neffectiveness, based upon fulfillment of all first tranche conditions. The second tranche of $100\nmillion equivalent (SDR39,121,000 from ADF and Y6,103,000,000 OCR) is expected to be\nreleased within 18 months of loan effectiveness or earlier, subject to fulfilling the relevant\nconditions, but is not time-bound. The third tranche of $123 million equivalent (SDR17,996,000\nfrom ADF and Y12,206,000,000 from OCR) is expected to be released within 60 months of loan\neffectiveness or earlier upon fulfillment of the relevant conditions.\n98. MINFAL, through the PIU and its Economic Wing, will collect benchmark or baseline\ndata at the start of the Program. Regular and close monitoring of the implementation of the\nProgram will be undertaken by both the Government and ADB. Specific program performance\nindicators have been developed to assist with monitoring (Appendix 6). Program impact will be\nassessed particularly from the perspective of productivity gains for small and marginal farmers\nand consumption patterns of the urban and rural poor due to shifts in market prices of staple\nfood items. Mechanisms to monitor these will be assigned to independent research agencies, to\nbe appointed by MINFAL at the start of the Program.\nVII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN\n99. The Government has determined that additional support will be required to effectively\nimplement, sequence, and monitor policy reform actions, and has requested ADB TA for (i)\nprogram coordination; (ii) improving the efficiency of commodity markets; (iii) small farmer\nextension, research, and safety nets; and (iv) reorganization and restructuring of SOEs. Other\nfunding agencies have also indicated that these are the areas where assistance is urgently\nneeded and where ADB assistance would be best targeted.\nA. Program Coordination\n100. To facilitate the design of the elements of the reform, and to sequence them to meet the\ntranche release conditions, assistance will be provided to MINFAL and its provincial counterparts to\n(i) maintain consistency of outputs with the Program objectives of enhancing the profitability of\nagricultural production; (ii) advise the Government on price and subsidy reform measures; (iii)\nreview all policy, legal, and institutional aspects for consistency in promoting efficient markets; (iv)\nensure that the terms of participation of small farmers in commodity markets improve; (v)\nenhance private sector participation in agricultural research, education, and extension; and (vi)\nensure  that  SOEs  are  reorganized  with  adequate  emphasis  on  good  governance  and\nsustainability.\nB. Improving the Efficiency of Commodity Markets\n101. With the deregulation of trade in inputs, foodgrains, cash crops, and intermediate goods\nas part of the Program, the Government has sought assistance to establish an appropriate\nlegislative framework and guidelines for major crops (sugarcane and cotton) and for inputs\n(fertilizer, agricultural chemicals, and seed) to meet the Program's objectives. The TA will also\nprovide support for establishing quality benchmarks and their control mechanisms in the private\nsector that would supplement the limited Government regulatory mechanisms.", "31\nC. Small Farmer Extension, Research, and Safety Nets\n102. The  TA  will  assess  the  most  effective  alternative  means  for  agricultural  extension,\nincluding through NGOs, from among the current pilot projects in Pakistan, and build plans (the\nagriculture support services plans) to reorient its own extension system accordingly. MINFAL\nwill be assisted in (i) preparing plans (the research institutes plans and the research councils\nplan) to reorganize the research establishments and develop a seamless delivery mechanism\nfor education, research, and extension; (ii) developing a plan that will enhance the participation\nand  benefits  for  small  farmers  (the  small  farmers  plan)  and  provide  safety  nets;  and  (iii)\nstructuring the counterpart funds allotted to the provinces into trust funds with defined small\nfarmer focus.\n D. Reorganization and Restructuring of SOEs\n103. The Government will need to direct, manage, and sequence the reorganization and\nrestructuring of SOEs in a manner that increases the opportunities for participation of the private\nsector. The TA will assist the Government in the reorganization of the provincial and national\nresearch  institutions,  and  more  specifically,  in  enabling  PASSCO  to  manage  the  strategic\nreserve. In addition, the TA will assist in the preparation of a corporate governance framework\nand performance standards for the reorganized SOEs, and will develop eligibility criteria for\naccess to public resources.\n104. The total cost of  the TA is estimated to be $2.8 million equivalent, comprising $1.1\nmillion in foreign exchange cost and $1.7 million in local currency cost. ADB will provide $2\nmillion to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $900,000 to partly meet the local currency\ncost. International and domestic consultants will be engaged from a consulting firm to implement\nthe TA. The consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants. The Government has requested that ADB recruit the consultants on behalf of the\nGovernment and assist the Government in negotiating the contract with the consultants. The\nGovernment and the consultants will sign the contract. The Government has requested advance\nprocurement action. An estimated 138 person-months of consulting services will be required,\nincluding 36 person-months of international consultants and 102 persons-months of domestic\nconsulting  services.  TA  components  are  expected  to  begin  in  February  2002  and  will  be\nimplemented over a 2-3 year period. Outline terms of reference and cost estimates are in\nAppendix 8.\nVIII. PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA. Impacts\n105. The Program will have significant social, financial, and economic impacts at both the\nnational and provincial levels on stakeholders including farmers (especially small and poor\nfarmers and landless farm laborers), rural and urban consumers, private sector agribusiness\nenterprises, and employees of the public sector. The impact analysis is based primarily on a\npartial  equilibrium  methodology37  through  changes  in  one  commodity  at  a  time,  and  then\nanalyzing the combined effect. Changes in prices, yields, cropped area, and cropping intensities\n                  \n37  Khan, M.E., Report on the Financial, Economic, and Poverty Impacts of the Proposed Policy Reforms, under TA\n3229-PAK, Islamabad, June 2001.", "32\nare modeled.38\n1.  Impact on Prices\n106. The Program is expected to rationalize agricultural input and output prices through policy\nreforms, including removal of subsidies, discontinuation of wheat price support policy, and trade\nand market liberalization. In the past, government support prices have been generally below the\nrelevant import and export parity prices, except in the case of sugarcane, where the support price\nhas been higher than the import parity price. With the Program, it is expected that in the medium\nterm (2001\u20132005), the farmgate prices in real dollar terms of wheat, basmati paddy, short grain\npaddy, and seed cotton will increase by 11, 24, 8, and 7 percent, respectively; and in the long run\n(by 2010) by 17, 37,19, and 23 percent, respectively. The increase in prices would be realized\nmainly due to two factors: (i) liberalization of trade that would bridge the gap between the export\nparity  price  and  the  support  prices  (and  the  consequent  wholesale  market  price),  and  (ii)\nincreases in world commodity prices.39 In the case of sugarcane, however, as the current and\nprojected import parity prices are significantly lower than the support price, the farmgate price of\nsugarcane would fall by 27 percent in the short run with the unrestricted import of sugar but would\nincrease by 6 percent by 2010. This recovery is expected to be realized from the returns on\ninvestment in extension and research and from increases in world sugar prices. Demand and\nsupply elasticities average -0.9 for sugarcane and 0.5 for wheat, demonstrating that demand and\nsupply are inelastic. Sensitivity analysis on these price changes, assuming a 10 percent change of\nannual growth rate in both directions, demonstrates some sensitivity of wheat and paddy prices,\nranging from 5.3 to 5.7 percent compared with the base average annual growth rate by 2005 of\n5.5 percent.\n107. The first 2-3 years after the commencement of the Program will be an adjustment or\ntransition period. During this period, the private sector market institutions and functionaries will\ngradually  replace  the  role  of  the  public  sector  market  and  institutions,  make  increased\ninvestment, and establish domestic and international marketing linkages. It is likely that during\nthis transition period, prices of major crops except sugarcane may fall slightly. Later, the prices\nwill  recover  and  stabilize  with  the  full  active  role  of  private  sector  institutions.  During  the\ntransition period, the prices for consumers may temporarily decrease. Sugar prices, however,\nwill decrease significantly, due to lower import parity prices. With the elimination of the subsidy\non wheat, the price of wheat flour may increase by about PRs1.25-1.50 per kilogram. This\nwould require an additional expenditure of $1.3-$1.6 (PRs87-100) per household per month,\nmeaning an addition of about 1.0 percent for food expenditures of low-income households\nearning less than $47 (PRs3,000) per month.\n2. Impact on Farm Production\n108. With the policy and price reforms, there will be a shift in cropping patterns, reflecting\ncomparative advantage and the relative profitability of crops. By 2005, it is estimated that yields of\nwheat, paddy, and seed cotton will increase by 5, 2, and 5 percent, respectively. Average cropped\narea and cropping intensities will also increase by about 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively. As\na result, total production of these crops should increase to 23.5, 10.3, and 6.4 million tons,\nrespectively,  representing  increases  of  about  12  percent,  19  percent,  and  11  percent,\n                  \n38  Based mainly on Ahmad, Bashir, Crop and Farm Budget Analysis, prepared under TA 3229-PAK, Faisalabad,\nJune 2001.\n39  Commodity Market Report, World Bank, March 2001.", "33\nrespectively, over the production levels in 2000. The supply and adoption of improved and\ncertified  seed  have  been  a  major  limiting  factor  in  productivity  gains.  Also,  the  supporting\nagricultural services of research and extension have been inefficiently managed due to their\ninappropriate administrative structures and lack of adequate funding. With the removal of seed\nmarketing barriers and increase in private seed company marketing of certified seed, coupled with\nthe restructuring of the service delivery institutions, by 2010 the estimated production will increase\nto 24.7, 10.9, and 6.9 million tons, respectively, for wheat, paddy, and seed cotton. In percentage\nterms, the increases will be 17 percent, 25 percent, and 20 percent for the three crops. Sugar\nproduction, however, is anticipated to decrease to 20.5 million tons from 46.3 million tons by 2005.\nHowever, with improved seed and research and extension services, sugar production is estimated\nto reach 23.0 million tons by 2010.  Sensitivity analysis on yields, assuming 10 percent changes in\nboth directions, indicates some sensitivity of wheat and paddy yields, similar to the results for\nprice sensitivities.\n3. Impact on Agriculture Sector Growth\n109. It is anticipated that by 2005, the sector will be able to realize an annual growth rate of\nabout 4 percent with the marketing reforms alone. When complemented with the increased use\nof certified seed and the restructuring of support services, by 2010 it may increase to a 5\npercent annual growth rate.\n4. Impact on Farm Household Income, Farm Labor, and Poverty Incidence\n110. The Program will have a significant impact on farm household incomes. It is expected that\nwith the Program, by 2005 the annual income of an average farm household will increase from\n$580 to $730 (27 percent). This increase in income should be realized through (i) changes in the\nprices  of  inputs  and  commodities,  and  (ii)  shifts  in  cropping  patterns  based  on  the  relative\nprofitability of crops. By 2010, it is estimated that the average farm income will increase by 67\npercent from the base year due to (i) increased availability of improved seed, and (ii) improved\nsupport to farmers from agricultural research and extension services. The loss of income due to\nthe anticipated decrease in sugarcane prices will be compensated by increases in income from\nsubstituting crops. It is also expected that, with the policy and price reforms alone, the demand for\nfarm laborers in 2005 will increase by about 15 million person-days, or about 2.4 percent. With\nincreased productivity gains from improved seeds and institutional reforms, the labor requirement\nin 2010 will increase by about 37 million person-days or about 6 percent. This will increase the\nhousehold incomes of landless laborers. Moreover, with the increase in the prices of commodities,\nthe wages of landless laborers will also increase. With the Program, the incidence of poverty in\nthe rural areas will be lowered from the existing 35 percent to about 33 percent.  For consumers,\nthe anticipated slight increases in the price of foodgrains will be offset by the decrease in the price\nof sugar. The rise in commodity prices will increase household expenditures on food items of the\nurban and rural nonagricultural households, but by only $7.50 and $10 per year, respectively,\nwhich is an increase of less than 1 percent over present expenditure on food by an average\nhousehold.  In  addition,  the  Government  is  preparing  plans  for  targeted  poverty  reduction\nprograms in both rural and urban areas, and the Program will assist it in setting up these\nsupport programs to target poor households. The annual budgetary requirement, in constant\nterms,  to  mitigate  the  additional  burden  on  households  that  are  below  the  poverty  line  is\nestimated at $27 million.", "34\n5. Impacts on Investment and Employment\n111. By providing appropriate incentives to private sector marketing and investment, the\nproduction,  import,  and  marketing  of  seed  and  fertilizer  will  significantly  improve,  ensuring\ngreater efficiencies through competitive pricing and timely provision of these inputs. With the\nProgram, the private sector will be encouraged to replace public sector marketing and trading\nactivities, particularly regarding wheat and seeds. It is estimated that by the year 2005, 12-15\nmillion tons of marketable surplus wheat  will be available for marketing institutions to handle. This\nincludes 3.5 million tons of wheat for export, after meeting the domestic requirements. Similarly,\nabout 3.3 million tons of rice and about 0.2 ton of cotton will be surplus for export. This will require\na sizeable investment and will generate employment opportunities in the private sector. However,\nflour and sugar mills, generally operating below the installed capacity and with suboptimal milling\nefficiencies, will lose the advantage of subsidized wheat and overvalued sugar prices, and may\nclose down unless they invest in modernization. This may cause some unemployment, but it is\nexpected that the surplus employees will be absorbed in alternate employment in the expanding\nagroprocessing industries. Similarly, the divestment of public sector institutions will render some of\nthe staff surplus. Initially, they will be absorbed in the surplus pool. Nonetheless, if they are\nreleased with severance pay and some training, they should be able to find employment in the\nprivate sector.\n6.  Impact on Public Sector Expenditure and Balance of Payments\n112. A large part of the subsidy, especially for wheat, has benefited the traders and the\nbetter-off urban consumers. Reducing and eventually eliminating the wheat subsidy will result in\nlarge fiscal savings for the Government that can be better spent on the ongoing targeted poverty\nreduction  programs.  The  average  annual  expenditure  on  the  wheat  subsidy  (Federal  and\nprovincial combined) over the last five years was about $145 million. This does not include the\nsubstantial costs of staff and other fixed costs, which will also be a saving to the Government.\n113. With PASSCO commercializing its strategic reserve operations in wheat, the net saving\nto the provinces will be $135-$140 million.40 Similarly, by closing various SOEs,41 there will be\nan additional annual saving of $15-20 million. This saving could then be diverted to public sector\nexpenditures on other social and infrastructure development programs. In addition, the provincial\ngovernments will be able to lease out or privatize the existing wheat storage facilities. Similarly,\nproviding increased autonomy to research organizations will encourage them to generate their\nown funds and be increasingly self-financing, and reorganization and decentralization of these\ninstitutions will reduce expenditures on overlapping functions. This saving will be available for\nincreased funding for the research institutions.\n114. With the policy reforms and liberalization of trade, the private sector will be able to export\nsurplus wheat, rice, and cotton. After adjusting for the value of sugar imports, the estimated value\nof incremental exports in 2005 will be about $1.9 billion. It is anticipated that, with the increase in\nfarm  productivity  achieved  through  seed  improvements  and  restructuring  of  research  and\nextension services, and adjusting for population increases, the total value of incremental exports\nin 2010 will be around $2.0 billion. This will contribute to improving the balance of payments\n                  \n40 The annual operating loss reported by PASSCO in 2000 was about $23 million for the management of about 1.25\nmillion tons. Under the Program, with commercialization of operations and induction of provincial representatives\non the board of governors, there may be some cost savings through improved management and economies of\nscale.\n41  These organizations include FID, SSC, SASO, ADA, and the provincial food departments.", "35\nsituation of the country.\nB.  Justification\n115. The Government is committed to further liberalizing agricultural trade, divesting SOEs,\ndiscontinuing  its  price  support  policy,  withdrawing  subsidies  in  general  and  in  wheat  in\nparticular, restructuring and strengthening research and extension departments, and realigning\nexisting relevant institutions. These reforms will require substantial financial resources to (i)\nbridge the revenue gap in the short run, (ii) implement a staff retrenchment and retraining\nprogram, (iii) establish endowment funds for supporting innovative research and extension\napproaches, (iv) provide incentives and credit to private sector investment, and (v) support\ntargeted poverty reduction programs. The Program will assist the Government in implementing\nthis reform agenda by providing the requisite financial resources.\n116. The overall goals of the Program are consistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy, which aims\nat (i) reducing poverty, (ii) increasing the efficiency of public sector organizations and improving\ngovernance, (iii) expanding the role of the private sector, and (iv) rationalizing the role of public\ninstitutions. The Federal Government has also ensured fair compensation to the provincial\ngovernments to absorb the adjustment costs and to implement the targeted poverty reduction\nprograms.\nC. Risks\n117. The  main  risk  associated  with  program  loans  often  relates  to  the  Government\u2019s\nsustained  support  throughout  the  implementation  period.  The  current  Government  is  fully\ncommitted to the policy and institutional reforms contained in the Program. It is clear that the\nimplementation period of this Program will extend beyond the tenure of this administration, viz.,\nOctober 2002. However, there is a reason to believe that the Program will be equally supported\nby any future administration, as the major benefits of many of its components will start yielding\nresults within the first year and many others relate to irreversible structural changes that will\nhave taken root by then. There is also a risk of unsustained provincial government support for\nthe  Program,  particularly  with  regard  to  the  planned  phaseout  of  the  wheat  subsidy  and\nreduction in provincial government procurement, management, and marketing of wheat. The 5-\nyear implementation period of the Program with three undated tranches will provide adequate\ntime to implement the reforms. Contraction of the government activities in wheat will follow the\nprice and subsidy reforms, coupled with the planned expansion in private sector marketing\nactivities.\n118. Other  than  political  risks,  programs  sometimes  also  face  social  and  financial  risks.\nAlthough the proposed reform agenda is ambitious, it is prioritized, sequenced, and interlinked,\nand was prepared in consultation with all relevant stakeholders in private and public sector\ninstitutes and organizations. Therefore, it is expected to gain wide acceptance among the\nconcerned interest groups and institutions, minimizing the social risk. Many elements of the\ninstitutional reforms of the Program were initiated by the agencies of the Federal and provincial\ngovernments themselves. Therefore, the risk of slow implementation progress is also minimal. A\ngreat majority of the target group of this Program are farmers. They are the main beneficiaries\nof these reforms, in terms of fair prices for farm output and support from public sector research\nand extension services for increasing farm productivity. Consultations with many farmer groups\nat the village level as well as with their representative organizations were held during the\npreparation of the Program. The feedback has demonstrated their positive response. The main\nsocial risk is associated with the well being of the most vulnerable groups both in rural and\nurban areas, who would be worse off due to increased food prices. Targeted poverty reduction", "36\nprograms are included to ensure that the poor benefit through food subsidies and increased\nemployment opportunities.\n119. The  price  stability  of  agricultural  produce,  especially  food  crops,  and  fair  prices  to\nproducers and consumers are among the important objectives of this Program. In case of a\nsudden drop in world commodity prices and/or lack of demand from importing countries, domestic\nprices will also fall. Under the Program, a floor price mechanism will be introduced for wheat as\nexists now for cotton and rice, whereby the Government will intervene in the market and support a\nprice that provides adequate production incentive and return on farmers investment. In such a\nscenario, the Government would continue buying wheat and supporting the floor price until the\nprice  increases,  indicating  shortages  and  increased  market  demand,  at  which  time  the\nGovernment will stop buying. Similarly, in the case of a sudden increase in consumer prices,\ngovernment intervention may be inevitable to provide the necessary safeguards for poor and\nvulnerable groups. Periodic farm income studies by independent research institutes accompanied\nby wide dissemination of findings will help monitor the real impact on farm incomes and assess if\nthe total profit is still higher after slight decreases in prices, compared with the base year.\n120. The monitoring mechanisms for improved management of the wheat strategic reserves by\nPASSCO  and  the  provincial  food  departments  spell  out  clearly  the  threshold  levels  and\nmechanisms for entry and intervention as corrective mechanisms, and an exit strategy, without\ncompromising the objectives of the Program. In addition, during the transition stage, due to\npossible collusion of market functionaries, market failure, or lack of adequate investment capacity\nof the private sector, farmers may not receive satisfactory prices at harvest time. Similarly, traders\nmay hoard the produce to create artificial shortages. In such eventualities, various farmer groups,\nespecially those representing large farmers with political clout, and consumers may pressure the\nGovernment  for  a  reversal  of  reforms.  The  monitoring  mechanisms  will  help  ensure  the\nimplementation of regulatory mechanisms and measures to prevent hoarding and collusion, as\nwell as provision of adequate finances for both working capital and investment.\n121. The  existing  research  system  is  bureaucratically  managed,  underfunded,  and\nnonresponsive to farmers or industry. Given the existing rigid administrative rules of business and\nprocedures, the present system does not offer adequate incentives to research staff, in terms of\ncompensation and returns for high quality research, but provides safeguards to job security with\nminimal  accountability.  With  the  increasing  autonomy  given  to  research  institutes,  the\nperformance of the research staff will be periodically reviewed by the stakeholders managed by\ntheir boards. The pace of the proposed restructuring and transition may be politically resisted by\ninefficient staff who will be vulnerable under the new system. The institutional restructuring aimed\nat  providing  autonomy  to  the  research  system  will  therefore  take  into  account  the  needs,\nperceptions,  and  concerns  of  all  stakeholders,  including  research  staff,  farmers,  commodity\ntraders, agroprocessors, and consumers. There will be a cost to the economy of delaying the\npolicy  reforms.  The  TA  consultants  will  help  ensure  a  practical  time  frame  to  design  and\nimplement the transition of research management.\n122. Similarly,  the  existing  agriculture  extension  system  is  ineffective  due  to  inadequate\nlinkages  and  interface  among  research,  extension,  and  farmers.  The  reorganization  of  the\nextension systems to adopt approaches that are farmer responsive and accessible to small\nfarmers,  with  active  coordination  with  rural  support  programs,  NGOs,  and  input  marketing\nfunctionaries, could be constrained by various factors. There is a need for improved training and\nrefresher courses for extension staff, and increased budget support and mobility. To ensure\neffective and sustainable delivery of services, the performance needs to be monitored and made\naccountable.  Under  the  new  decentralization  and  devolution  plan  of  the  Government,\nstrengthened  local  government  institutions  will  monitor  and  supervise  the  activities  and", "37\nperformance of the extension services at the village level.\nIX.

Introduction\n1. The reforms proposed under the Program will support the long-term and pro-poor growth\npolicies of the Government in general and in rural areas in particular. This will be achieved\nthrough (i) rationalizing the prices of agricultural inputs and outputs through market liberalization\n(removal of international and domestic trade restrictions), (ii) curtailing the role and expenditure\non public sector marketing and storage operations, (iii) encouraging higher returns to investment\nin public sector research and extension services, and (iv) generating employment through\nincreased private sector investment and involvement of nongovernment organizations (NGOs).\nThe proposed strategies reflect the recommendations of the initial and follow-up studies for the\nProgram that were discussed in several provincial and Federal stakeholder workshops in 2000\nand 2001.\n2. Different studies carried out in Pakistan suggest that during the past few years the\nincidence of poverty has increased together with widening income disparity between the rich\nand the poor, and between urban and rural areas. These studies also indicate that, during the\n1970s and 1980s, there was significant reduction in poverty, measured by various indexes. The\ncontributing factors were the green revolution, industrial growth, and overseas remittances. In\nthe 1990s, the poverty incidence showed a reverse trend, and increased from about 20 percent\nto 30-35 percent. Since about 60 percent of the population live in rural areas with relatively\nlower economic opportunities, the incidence of rural poverty is relatively higher.\n3.  The major factors responsible for the rising incidence of poverty include an increase in\nthe  dependency  ratio,  slow  industrial  growth,  fall  in  remittances,  low  investment  in  social,\nphysical, and productive infrastructure (especially in rural areas), higher prices of agricultural\ninputs,  lower  prices  for  outputs,  lack  of  policy  environment  for  increased  private  sector\ninvestment and employment generation, and poor delivery of services by research and livestock\nextension  staff.  To  reverse  this  trend,  the  Government  is  finalizing  its  poverty  reduction\nstrategies and requiring ongoing and upcoming development programs and investments to\nfocus on poverty reduction.\nB. Measuring the Impacts of Reforms\n4.  The overall objectives of the Program are to (i) improve agricultural productivity and\nprofitability; (ii) stabilize prices for producers and consumers; (iii) increase household incomes of\nthe poor, especially marginally and very poor rural households; and (iv) make better use of\npublic sector expenditures. This will lead to capital formation in rural areas, promote the private\nsector,  and  enhance  employment  generation.  The  savings  from  reduced  public  sector\nexpenditure can be diverted to social programs, which again will have a direct impact on quality\nof life of the poor people. Some of the Program recommendations may possibly have some\nnegative impacts, due to divestiture and downsizing of public sector institutions. Nonetheless,\nthese  will  be  offset  by  expansion  in  the  private  sector.  Moreover,  the  reorganization  of\ninstitutions responsible for the provision of services will improve the output and accessibility to\npoor  farmers,  and  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  farm  productivity  and  household  income.\nSimilarly, there will be significant positive ramifications on the overall macroeconomic situation.", "65\nAppendix 5, page 2\nC. Methodology\n5. The Bank\u2019s methodology for conducting a social impact assessment of program loans\nrequires  an  analysis  of  the  impact  that  policy  actions  will  have  on  economic  conditions.\nBudgetary savings to the Federal and provincial governments (PGs) in public expenditures and\nimproved efficiency in the marketing system will have major economic impacts. Two scenarios\nare analyzed: Scenario 1 assumes that the Government will not implement the proposed policy\nand institutional reforms; and Scenario 2 assumes that the Government will implement the\nproposed reforms under the Program.\n6.  The impact of each intervention of the Program is considered and grouped into four\ncategories: (i) direct effects, (ii) indirect effects, (iii) macroeconomic effects, and (iv) effect on the\npoor (both urban and rural and if are there any vulnerable groups). In each category, various\nmeasurement indicators are discussed including (i) the Government\u2019s budgetary position, (ii) the\nrole  of  the  private  sector,  (iii)  prices  of  farm  inputs  and  outputs,  (iv)  performance  and\naccessibility  of  delivery  services,  (v)  farm  productivity  enhancement,  and  (vi)  positive  and\nnegative impacts on poor households.\nD. Policy Options with Significant Impact on the Poor\n7.  The Program will have both direct and indirect impacts on the poverty level. The reforms,\nsuch  as  discontinuation  of  price  support  and  removal  of  restrictions  on  international  and\ndomestic trade, will have positive impacts on the income of farmers, especially small farmers,\nand to some extent the landless poor. Similarly, divesting of public enterprises and withdrawing\nbudgetary support, increasing the role of the private sector, exploring options for increased\nautonomy  of  research  institutions,  revitalizing  extension  services,  and  reorganizing  and\ndecentralizing institutions with redundant and or overlapping functions will also have both direct\nand indirect impacts on the poor. The benefits of the Program to the poor significantly outweigh\nthe  costs  to  vulnerable  groups,  and  any  adverse  impacts  can  be  mitigated  through\nsupplementing the ongoing social safety net and food security and support programs, as well as\nsupporting new programs targeting small farmers.\nE.  Impact Scenarios\n1. Scenario 1: Reforms Not Implemented\n8.  Under this scenario, farmers will continue to receive distorted prices, for both inputs and\noutputs, and as a result will have low farm incomes. The continuation of a monopolistic public\nsector role in the marketing will further constrain the growth of the private sector. The budgetary\nsupport requirement for the wheat subsidy and the public enterprises in the sector would\ncontinue to increase substantially, and contribute to the widening government deficit. Similarly,\nthe service delivery mechanisms (research and extension) in their present form will continue to\nbe inefficient and constrain growth in farm incomes. The inadequate availability of high yielding\nand good quality seed will continue to be a constraint in achieving the potential for higher\nproductivity. Moreover, institutions that are redundant and are engaged in overlapping activities\nwill continue to be a drain on public resources. The performance and accessibility of these\ninstitutions to the poor will further deteriorate.", "66\nAppendix 5, page 3\n    a.  Direct Impact1\n9.  Without reforms, the controls on prices of agricultural inputs and outputs will continue to\ndistort  the  terms  of  trade  for  the  agriculture  sector.  The  Government,  notably  the  Punjab\nGovernment, will continue to procure wheat at the support price but will likely not be willing to\nraise it because of the increasing budgetary cost and inability to dispose of rising surpluses. In\naddition, the restrictions on free interprovince and interdistrict movements will constrain open\nmarket initiatives, and farmers will receive lower and noncompetitive prices. At present, the\nsupport prices of wheat, rice, and cotton are lower than the export parity prices of the respective\ncrops. Without the Program, given the projected increase in commodity prices, the divergence\nbetween the two would further widen. At present, the average annual farm income is less than\nwhat it should be if markets were liberalized.\n10.  Without the Program, given the institutional inefficiencies and leakages, the expenditure\nand budgetary requirements will grow exponentially, and public sector marketing and trading\ncompanies will continue to lose money and increasingly depend on budgetary support. At\npresent,  the  average  annual  public  sector  expenditure  on  organizations  such  as  Pakistan\nAgricultural Storage and Supplies Corporation (PASSCO), and the provincial food departments\nresponsible for wheat procurement, storage, and subsidy is about $143 million. In addition to\nthis, the other related state-owned enterprises (SOEs)2 incur an operation loss of about $15-20\nmillion annually. This expenditure is expected to grow due to increasing operational costs. If this\ntrend continues, the Government will have to reduce the investment in other sectors, especially\nthe social sectors. This will have a direct impact on the quality of life and accessibility to social\nservices for the poor segments of the population.\nb. Indirect Impact\n11.  Without reforms, the price fixation policy will continue to distort the relative profitability of\ncrops. In the case of sugarcane, for which Pakistan does not have a comparative advantage,\nthe support price is higher than the import parity price. This has led to inefficient allocation of\nland and water resources, which otherwise can be allocated to crops such as wheat, rice, cotton\nand to other high-value crops for which Pakistan has a comparative advantage. Consequently,\nthe negative balance of trade would continue to increase. Government budgetary support will\ncontinue  to  provide  protection  to  inefficient  SOEs,  and  will  discourage  private  sector\ninvestments in marketing and agribusiness.  Similarly, as the public sector capacity to produce\nand disseminate high-yielding good quality seed is limited, the yields will continue to be lower\nthan its potential, and will discourage the private sector seed industry that could meet the\ndemand for the quality seed. The bureaucratically administered research institutions, with their\ntop-down approach, will continue to offer insufficient incentive to researchers, and hence low\nreturns. Without adaptive and problem-solving research support, farmers will remain reluctant to\ninvest in new farm production measures, adjust cropping patterns to changes in dwindling water\navailability regimes, or adopt other post harvest and storage methods. The continuation of\ninstitutions with redundant and overlapping functions will waste public resources.\n                  \n1  The estimated magnitude of impact in terms of yields, prices, household incomes, and budgetary savings has\nbeen adopted from \u201cReport on the Financial, Economic, and Poverty Impacts of the Proposed Policy Reforms,\u201d for\nADB TA 3229: Agriculture Sector Program, Islamabad, June 2001.\n2  These organizations include the Fertilizer Import Department, National Fertilizer Development Centre, Sindh Seed\nCorporation, Sindh Agricultural Supplies Organization, and Agriculture Development Agency.", "67\nAppendix 5, page 4\nc. Macroeconomic Impact\n12.  Without reforms, the continuation of distorted prices will result in retarded growth in\nagriculture,  misallocation  of  resources  towards  inefficient  crops,  and  increased  urban-rural\nincome  disparities,  falling  agricultural  rates,  increased  requirement  of  foreign  exchange  to\nimport food grains to feed the increasing population, and decreased balance of payments.\nContinued misallocation of resources to public marketing institutions will encourage the flow of\nfunds out of the agriculture sector to nonagriculture sectors. This will also discourage private\nsector investments. Restrictions on the movement of commodities and storage by public sector\ninstitutions will continue to increase. Similarly, the research and extension services will continue\nto  be  inefficient,  and  public  expenditures  will  have  poor  payoffs  and  little  impact  on  farm\nproductivity. The continuation of institutions with redundant and overlapping agenda will put\ncontinuous pressure on resources. The overall macroeconomic impact will be low growth rates\nin agriculture, and decreasing balance of payments.\nd. Impact on the Poor\n13. The distorted price policy has an adverse impact on small farmers\u2019 incomes due to\nunfavorable terms of trade and low marketable surpluses of food crops. Due to inefficient public\nsector trading enterprises and trade restrictions, the prices of inputs are relatively higher and for\nthe  prices  of  outputs  lower  than  what  may  prevail  in  a  free  trade  environment.  This  is\ntantamount to a regressive tax, especially on the poor and small farmers. Similarly, restricted\nmovement of farm commodities also has an adverse impact on the incomes of poor farmers and\nconsumers.  Poor  farmers  typically  do  not  benefit  from  research  and  new  technologies,\nespecially access to newly developed high-yielding varieties, and good quality seed. Even if\nthey are available, they reach poor farmers after a considerable time lag, resulting in low\nproductivity and income.\n2. Scenario 2: Program Reforms Implemented\n14. The reforms (Scenario 2) would positively affect farm productivity, prices of inputs and\noutputs, household incomes in rural areas (particularly of small, poor, and landless farmers),\nresearch and extension services, agricultural growth rates, and balance of payments. There will\nbe some negative impact on the household expenditure of the urban poor and nonagriculture\npoor, but this will be offset by support to these groups from poverty reduction and food security\nprograms.  This  support  to  the  poor  can  be  financed  either  through  savings  from  reduced\nagriculture subsidies and public expenditure or support from external funding, including the local\ncurrency proceeds of the Program Loan.\na.  Direct Impact\n15. The discontinuation of price interventions with respect to agricultural inputs and outputs\nwill  improve  the  terms  of  trade  for  agriculture.  The  prices  for  inputs  and  outputs  will  be\ndetermined in open and competitive markets. Moreover, farmers will be able to increase their\nincomes and modify their cropping patterns in response to changes in prices and relative\nprofitability. It is estimated that with the discontinuation of support prices and liberalization of\ntrade, by 2005, the real prices of wheat, basmati paddy, short grain paddy, and seed cotton will\nincrease by 11, 24, 8, and 7 percent, respectively. In the long run (by 2010), based on projected\ninternational prices,3  farmgate prices are expected to increase respectively by 17, 37, 19, and\n                  \n3  Commodity Market Report, World Bank, March 2001.", "68\nAppendix 5, page 5\n23 percent, over the base year. It is also anticipated that by 2005, with adjustment to import\nparity prices, sugarcane prices will fall by 27 percent.\n16. Production levels will also change. It is estimated that the production of wheat, paddy,\nand seed cotton will increase in 2005 by 12, 19, and 11 percent, respectively. In the case of\nsugarcane, it is estimated that, due to crop substitution, initially the production will decrease\nfrom 46.3 million tons to 20.5 million tons, but by 2005, it will increase to 23 million tons due to\nimproved seed adoption and to research and extension support services. The major thrust in the\nincrease in yield, especially in the long run (to 2010), will be realized by wider availability of\nnewly developed high-yielding varieties and good quality seed, produced and marketed by\nprivate sector seed enterprises. This will ensure more quantity of seed, both existing and new\nvarieties, better quality, and more timely delivery at lower prices to farmers.\n17. In the likely event that research institutions become increasingly autonomous, they will\nbe more responsive to the needs and priorities of farmers. The research institutes will be able to\ngenerate funds through contract research. This will also provide incentives to researchers to\ndevelop packages using new technologies that are responsive to sector needs. Similarly, the\nProgram will revitalize the extension activities, and strengthen their capacity and capability to\nprovide accessible services to farmers in general and to marginal and poor farmers in particular.\nThis will have a direct impact on farm incomes, especially of marginal, small, and poor farmers.\nIn addition, higher productivity together with the efficient marketing infrastructure will stabilize\nboth producer and the consumer prices.  NGO involvement in innovative extension programs\nwith government support will be able to effectively target small farmers.\n18. It is estimated that by 2005, the annual farm income of an average farm household will\nincrease by 27 percent, and by a total of 67 percent by 2010, based on current prices. The\nchange in income will accrue from removal of price distortions, changes in cropping patterns,\nand increased farm productivity due to access to improved research and extension support.\n19. With the closure of and withdrawal of budgetary support to the public marketing and\ntrading enterprises, the pressure on public expenditures will be eased. It is estimated that, with\nthe reorganization and improved management of PASSCO, and with the closure of SOEs and\nprovincial food departments, there will be a net saving of $135-$140 million annually. With the\nsavings thus generated, the Government will be able to invest in other sectors, especially social\nsectors. This will have a direct impact on the quality of life and accessibility to social services of\nthe poorer segments of the population. Moreover, the divestment of public marketing agencies\nwill promote private sector investment and employment generation. This will also have a direct\nimpact on reducing poverty.\n  b. Indirect Impact\n20.  As subsidies are eliminated and markets liberalized, prices will no longer be fixed but\ndetermined in open markets and farmers will receive higher prices. This will encourage capital\nformation in the sector due to the reduced risk for investment, both at the farm level and at the\nprocessing level. This will also encourage the adoption of new technologies at a faster rate and\nfurther expand capital formation in the agriculture sector. The reorganization and redefinition of\nthe  roles  of  institutions  with  redundant  and  or  overlapping  functions  will  save  public\nexpenditures and will facilitate institutions being responsive to farmers' needs. The public sector\ntrading companies will be phased out and the private sector will fill the gaps through increased\ninvestment and employment opportunities. The seed industry, which was constrained by the\npublic sector monopoly, will be encouraged to invest in the production and marketing of good", "69\nAppendix 5, page 6\nquality  seed  at  competitive  prices.  With  increased  autonomy  to  research  institutions,\nresearchers will address farmers needs, and hence higher returns will be obtained from efficient\nallocation of research funds. With the increase in farm productivity, the farm labor requirement\nwill also increase. It is estimated that the policy reforms alone will generate about 15 million\nperson-days or about 2.4 percent of the current annual labor requirement. With the increased\nuse of certified seed and improved research and extension support, the total annual labor\nrequirement will go up to about 37 million person-days or 6 percent of the current annual labor\nrequirement. This will provide job opportunities and higher income to landless labor.\nc. Macroeconomic Impact\n21. With  the  price  and  market  reforms,  it  is  estimated  that,  by  2005,  the  incremental\ncontribution of agriculture will be about $1.9 billion. In addition, with improved access to seeds\nand  better  research  and  extension  support  services  to  farmers,  the  productivity  gains  will\nincrease by 2010 to about $2.0 billion. It is also anticipated that the annual growth rate of\nagriculture by 2005 will improve to about 5.5 percent. With improved seed delivery and use, and\nmore effective support services, an overall growth rate of about 6.7 percent can be realized by\n2010.\nd. Impact on the Poor\n22.  It is anticipated that, with the improved returns in agriculture and increased farm labor\ndemand, the existing poverty incidence of about 35 percent will decrease to around 33 percent.\nHowever, it is estimated that the annual food expenditures of nonfarm households will increase\nin 2005 by 0.5 percent, and in 2010 by 1.0 percent, or $7.50 in rural areas and $10 in urban\nareas. With market and price liberalization, the prices of inputs and outputs will be rationalized.\nThe lower prices of inputs and higher prices for outputs will translate into higher farm incomes.\nSimilarly, free movement of farm commodities will stabilize prices for farmers. The rationalized\nprices and favorable terms of trade will have positive impacts on farm income especially for\nsmall and poor farmers. The increased role of the private sector will generate employment\nopportunities for the underemployed and the unemployed. In addition, the accessibility of the\npoor to public services will also increase, and poor farmers will benefit in terms of increased\nfarm productivity and farm income.\nF.  Public Consultations\n23.  Two provincial workshops and one Federal-level stakeholder workshop were held in\n2000 during the preparation of the Program to obtain feedback from a mix of policy makers,\nplanners,  research  and  extension  specialists,  representatives  of  farmer  organizations,  and\nNGOs. The proposed policy and institutional reforms were discussed. In addition, consultations\nwere held, most recently in April 2001, with representatives of the Federal Government, the four\nPGs, farmers, heads of farmer associations in Punjab and Sindh, NGOs, and private sector\ninput companies.\n24.  The stakeholders consulted generally agreed with the proposed policy reforms, such as\nliberalization of marketing and trade activities, divestment of SOEs, removal of prohibitions on\nthe interdistrict and interprovincial movement of agricultural commodities, etc. However, the\nfarmers were in favor of a continuation of a wheat support price policy. Although farmers argued\nfor a continuation of subsidy on inputs, they agreed that the private sector should also be\nallowed to import and market inputs without restrictions. However, farmers asserted that the\nGovernment should regulate and monitor the activities and business practices of the private\nsector  so  that  cartels  and  collusion  of  traders  and  importers  do  not  exploit  the  farming", "70\nAppendix 5, page 7\ncommunity. Farmers generally endorsed the idea of monitoring the quality standards of inputs\nand outputs. However, they did not favor any addition to the present agricultural tax structure\nand felt that the sector is already overtaxed. They felt that a crop-based income tax is preferable\nto the current agricultural income tax.\n25.  Regarding the provision of support services, the stakeholders consulted agreed with the\nplans under the National Drainage Program to relocate extension agents along the hydraulic\nboundaries working closely with the newly formed farmer organizations. However, they felt that\nthe extension agents do not have much to offer, as their knowledge is outdated, and hence\nneed training. Most participants agreed that a major reorientation of extension and research is\nrequired.  The  farmers  felt  that  the  veterinary  services  (both  preventive  and  curative)  and\nartificial insemination services should continue to be provided free by the livestock extension\ndepartments. There was general agreement on the proposal to hire women extension agents,\nespecially to work with women on kitchen gardening, fruit and vegetable preservation, and\nlivestock activities.", "COMPLIANCE MEASURES FOR TRANCHE RELEASES AND MONITORING INDICATORS\nPolicy Conditions Actions Required for Compliance Responsible Tranche Monitoring Indicators\nAgency\nA.
