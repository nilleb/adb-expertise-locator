These  changes  form  a  part  of  the  overall\neconomic  policy  reform  to  move  to  a  market-based  system,\nwith  an  expanded  role  for  the  private  sector,  in  order  to\nincrease  growth  and  reduce  debt.  The  Program  has  been\ndesigned \nin  addressing  key\nthe  Government \nconstraints in the agriculture sector regarding productivity and\nprofitability  with  an  emphasis  on  small  and  marginal  farmers\nand  on  private  sector  investors  and  exporters.  It  is  expected\nthat the Program will increase agricultural growth, investment,\nexports,  and  rural  employment,  and  reduce  rural  poverty.\nBeneficiaries  will  be  provided  with  opportunities  to  increase\ntheir  crop  yields,  productivity,  incomes,  and  employment  and\nto improve their quality of life through the promotion of efficient\ncommodity  markets  and  support  services.  The  Program  will\ncomplement \nthe  Government's  macroeconomic  reforms,\nwhich are supported by the World Bank and the International\nMonetary Fund.\n\nDespite the progress made in liberalizing agricultural markets\nand  prices  in  recent  years,  direct  intervention  by  the\nGovernment  in  agricultural  markets  remains  excessive.  This\nhas led to low producer prices and low farm profitability. The\nproductivity of most crops is low, and research and extension\nsystems and institutions are outdated and weak. These have\naffected  both  the  upstream  linkages  for  farm  inputs  such  as\nseeds, \nthe  downstream\nlinkages  to  agro-processing  and  related  industries.  These\nhave  also  adversely  affected  the  well-being  of  the  vast\nmajority  of  small  farmers  and  the  rural  poor,  and  have\nrestrained overall economic growth. Government subsidies in\nthe  agriculture  sector  are  expensive  to  maintain  and  do  not\ntypically  benefit  the  target  beneficiaries\u2014the  small  and\nmarginal farmers.\n\nfertilizers,  and  machinery  and \n\nPakistan is in the midst of an International Monetary Fund-led\nstructural  adjustment  program  with  poverty  reduction  as  the\nkey goal, and revitalization of the agriculture sector as a key\ncomponent  in  the  export-led  strategy.  The  Government\nintends to redefine its role in the agriculture sector to ensure\nthe  smooth  functioning  of  markets,  promote  private  sector\nactivities,  and  reshape  public  expenditures  in  agriculture  on\npublic goods and market failures.\n\n\fiv\n\nthrough  deregulation, \n\nThe  Program  will  promote  reforms  to  expand  the  role  of  the\nliberalization,  and\nprivate  sector \nprivatization,  affecting  many  public  input  supply  and  output\nmarketing  enterprises  that  now  operate  in  the  agriculture\nsector. The agricultural subsidy regime that has compounded\nfiscal  difficulties  and  skewed  the  benefits  of  growth  and\ninvestment away from the needy will be gradually dismantled\nto  correspondingly  increase  social  sector  investments.  The\nGovernment  has  demonstrated \nthe\nProgram  by  initiating  actions  in  several  key  areas.  The\nProgram is consistent with ADB\u2019s country assistance plan for\nPakistan  and  is  well  anchored  with  the  overall  goals  of  the\nstructural adjustment.\n\nits  commitment \n\nto \n\nThe  primary  objective  of  the  Program  will  be  to  improve\nagricultural  productivity  and  profitability.  It  includes  specific\nreform measures to (i) promote efficient markets for the major\ncommodities,  including  wheat,  cotton,  rice,  sugar,  fertilizer,\nand  seeds;  and  (ii)  strengthen  support  services  in  small\nfarmer  extension  and  training,  research,  and  regulation  to\nimprove quality control.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nClassification\n\nThematic: Economic Growth\n\nEnvironmental\n\nAssessment\n\nCategory B\nEnvironmental  implications  of  the  proposed  policy  and\ninstitutional  reforms  were  reviewed,  and  environmental\ninterventions have been incorporated as required.\n\nThe ADB Loan Amount\n\nand Terms\n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide three loans\ntotaling  the  equivalent  of  $350  million,  including  (i)  a  loan  in\nan  amount  of  SDR96,238,000  ($123  million  equivalent)  from\nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (subject  to  the  availability  of\nAsian Development Fund [ADF] resources), with a term of 24\nyears  maturity,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  an\ninterest rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period,\nand 1.5 percent per annum during the amortization period; (ii)\na  loan  in  an  amount  of  Y27,463,500,000  ($225  million\nequivalent  at  the  exchange  rate  of  $1.00=JPY122.060  as  of\n12  November  2001)  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources\n(OCR), with a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3\nyears,  and  interest  charge  to  be  determined  in  accordance\nwith ADB's London interbank offered rate-based loan facility;\nand  (iii)  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  loan  in  an  amount  of\nSDR1,565,000  ($2  million  equivalent)  from  ADB's  Special\nFunds resources, with a term of 32 years maturity, including a\ngrace period of 8 years, with an interest rate of 1 percent per\nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nduring the amortization period.\n\n\fProgram Period and\n\nTranching\n\nProcurement\n\nUtilization of the Loan\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nCounterpart Funds\n\nTechnical Assistance\n\nv\n\nThe  Program  period  will  be  five  years  from  December  2001.\nThe  proposed  ADB  loans  will  be  released  in  three  tranches.\nThe  first  tranche  of  $125  million  equivalent  (SDR39,121,000\nADF  and  Y9,154,500,000  OCR)  will  be  released  upon  loan\neffectiveness,  based  upon  its  fulfillment  of  all  first  tranche\nconditions.

The TA was implemented in a participatory way, and numerous\nstakeholders \nfarmer  groups,  nongovernment\norganizations  (NGOs),  academia,  private  sector  agribusiness,  and  external  aid  agencies  were\nconsulted  in  workshops  and  meetings.    A  draft  sector  Program  was  confirmed  by  the  Appraisal\nMission2  in  June  2001.  This  report  is  based  on  the  findings  of  several  ADB  missions  and\ndiscussions with stakeholders. A Program framework is in Appendix 1.\n\nthe  Government, \n\nrepresenting \n\nfarmers, \n\nIII.\n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\n\nA.\n\nThe Economy\n\n3.\nPakistan  is  faced  with  severe  macroeconomic  imbalances,  declining  economic  growth,\nrising  poverty,  and  underdeveloped  human  capital.  During  the  1990s  the  fiscal  deficit  and  the\ncurrent  account  deficit  as  a  proportion  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  averaged  6.9\npercent and 4.5 percent, respectively. The average economic growth rate decelerated from 6.5\npercent in the 1980s to 5.4 percent in the first half of the 1990s, and to 3.6 percent during the\nlast five years. The incidence of poverty increased from less than 20 percent in the late 1980s to\nover 30 percent today.3 In addition, the savings and investment rates, at less than 15 percent of\nGDP in 2001, remain low. The agriculture sector and textile industry continue to dominate the\neconomy.  The  agriculture  sector  contributes  about  26  percent  to  GDP  and  employs  about  50\npercent  of  the  work  force.  The  textile  sector,  which  is  based  on  the  cotton  produced  by  the\nagriculture sector, is the largest source of employment for the industrial labor force (38 percent)\nand the largest source of foreign exchange earnings (60 percent).\n\n4.\nCrises  in  the  management  of  public  finances  and  external  balances  dominated  the\neconomic  policy  agenda  in  Pakistan  during  the  1990s.  However,  despite  all  efforts,  and  three\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) programs between 1988 and 1999, little progress was made\nin  addressing  macroeconomic  imbalances.  Efforts  of  successive  governments  to  implement\nstructural reforms during this period were often interrupted, due in part to frequent changes of\ngovernments.  The  result  was  a  decade  of  stop-go  stabilization  policies,  with  the  attendant\nnegative  impact  on  growth,  but  without  the  desired  benefits  in  the  form  of  improved\nmacroeconomic fundamentals. The imposition of economic sanctions following the nuclear tests\nof May 1998 further exposed the vulnerabilities of Pakistan\u2019s economy.\n\n                  \n\n2001.\n\n1 TA 3229-PAK: Agriculture Sector Program, for $350,000, approved on 20 July 1999, and completed on 31 May\n\n2  Comprising  R.  Renfro,  Senior  Project  Economist/Mission  Leader,  R.  O'Sullivan,  Counsel,  and  R.  Faruqee,  Staff\nConsultant and Lead Economist, World Bank. N. Hamid, Senior Economist, Pakistan Resident Mission, assisted\nthe Mission.\n\n3   \"Economic Survey, 2000-2001\", Economic Advisor's Wing, Finance Division, Government of Pakistan, 2001.\n\n\f2\n\nChronic fiscal and external deficits have resulted in the accumulation of large domestic\n5.\nand external debt. Public debt (both domestic and external) equaled 92 percent of GDP in 2000,\nand  interest  payments  on  public  debt  accounted  for  over  40  percent  of  the  total  current\nexpenditure of the Government. Within Pakistan\u2019s debt problems, the external debt is the more\ncritical  issue  for  short-  to  medium-term  economic  management.  In  1998,  debt  servicing\nexceeded  50  percent  of  foreign  exchange  earnings,  and  even  after  debt  rescheduling,  the\nexternal  debt  service  ratio  in  2001  was  over  35  percent.  As  of  30  June  2001,  Pakistan\u2019s  total\nexternal  debt  was  about  $34.7  billion,  and  the  ratio  of  external  debt  to  foreign  exchange\nearnings stood at over 240 percent.\n\n6.\nThe military Government that came to power in October 1999 has initiated a number of\nreform programs to address governance problems and long-standing structural challenges, and\nsince  November  2000  Pakistan  has  been  implementing  a  far-reaching  macroeconomic\nstabilization  and  restructuring  program  under  an  IMF  Standby  Arrangement.4  Drought,  high  oil\nprices, and deterioration in the terms of trade have aggravated the situation in Pakistan. GDP\ngrowth  in  2000  declined  to  3.9  percent  from  4.2  percent  in  1999.  The  slowdown  occurred\ndespite  a  bountiful  harvest,  which  propelled  real  agricultural  value-added  growth  from  about  2\npercent in 1999 to 6 percent in 2000. In 2001, because of severe drought that resulted in a 40\npercent reduction in the irrigation water supply, agricultural production fell by 2.5 percent, which\nresulted  in  a  further  slowing  down  of  the  GDP  growth  rate  to  2.6  percent.  However,  there  are\nsome positive signs, as large-scale manufacturing output expanded by over 7 percent in 2001\ncompared with less than 2 percent in 2000. Strong expansion in the volume of exports was an\nimportant factor in the revival of growth in the manufacturing sector.\n\nExports, which had been stagnating since the mid-1990s, have expanded by 10 percent\n7.\nand 7 percent in 2000 and 2001, respectively. However, export growth in 2001 is expected to be\nwell  below  the  target  of  11.3  percent.  This  was  largely  because  of  the  slowdown  in  the  world\neconomy and the resulting decline in unit values of Pakistan\u2019s principal export items, as exports\nin volume terms increased by 14.8 percent in 2001. While the failure to meet the export target\nhas  resulted  in  pressure  on  the  current  account,  strong  expansion  in  export  volumes  is\nencouraging,  as  it  shows  that  the  restructuring  policies  are  beginning  to  take  effect.  While\nPakistan\u2019s  non-oil  imports  declined  in  2001  due  to  depressed  domestic  demand,  higher  oil\nprices resulted in an increase of about 6 percent in total imports. The trade deficit declined for\nthe  second  year  in  a  row,  and  the  current  account  deficit  also  declined.  Pakistan\u2019s  external\nreserves  were  also  higher,  with  the  State  Bank  of  Pakistan\u2019s  foreign  exchange  reserves\nincreasing to over $1.6 billion by 30 June 2001.5\n\n8.\nTo  reduce  the  large,  unsustainable,  and  chronic  fiscal  deficit  is  a  major  challenge  that\nthe  Government  has  started  to  address  effectively.  In  2001,  because  of  weak  domestic\neconomic  conditions,  total  revenues  as  a  share  of  GDP  declined  to  16.2  percent  from  16.9\npercent  in  2000.  However,  the  Government  managed  to  reduce  total  expenditures  in  2001  to\n21.8 percent of GDP from 23.4 percent in 2000. This decline in expenditures was achieved by\n\n                  \n\n4  On  29  November  2000,  IMF  approved  a  standby  credit  for  Pakistan  until  30  September  2001  in  an  amount  of\n$596  million.  Pakistan\u2019s  performance  under  the  IMF  Standby  Arrangement  has  been  very  good,  and  the  third\ntranche, based on the 31 March 2001 review by IMF, was released on schedule in July 2001.\n\n5  Since 1999, the State Bank of Pakistan has been forced to purchase dollars in the open market to finance a part\nof the current account deficit and meet its external reserves target. Such purchases increased to over $2 billion in\n2001 from $1.6 billion in 2000.\n\n\f3\n\nreducing  both  current  and  development  spending.6  Overall,  the  consolidated  budget  deficit\ndeclined  to  5.6  percent  of  GDP  in  2001  from  6.5  percent  in  2000.  In  the  2002  Budget,  the\nGovernment is committed to reducing the fiscal deficit to below 5 percent of GDP.\n\nin  reviving \n\nThe  medium-  and  long-term  outlook  depends  on  the  pace  of  structural  reforms  and\n9.\nprivatization, as well as the political will necessary for undertaking reorganization of the Central\nBoard  of  Revenue,  which  is  essential  for  improving  revenue  collection  and  sustaining  fiscal\ndiscipline.  Success \nimproving  economic\nperformance  in  the  short  to  medium  term,  and  for  that,  successful  completion  of  negotiations\nwith  IMF  for  the  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility  (PRGF)  in  2001  will  be  critical.  Real\nGDP  growth  is  forecast  to  remain  below  5  percent  per  annum  over  the  next  two  years.\nManufacturing  is  likely  to  sustain  the  robust  growth  witnessed  in  2001.  Agricultural  growth  in\n2002 will probably be adversely affected to some extent by the carryover effects of the drought,\nbut it should return to a rate of 4-5 percent by 2003.\n\ninvestor  confidence \n\nis  critical \n\nfor \n\nB.\n\nPolicy and Development Issues\n\nThe primary economic policy issue for Pakistan is the reduction of the fiscal deficit to a\n10.\nsustainable  level.  The  Government  has  been  able  to  increase  tax  revenues  in  the  last  two\nyears,  but  as  a  proportion  of  GDP  they  are  well  below  the  average  ratio  for  the  1990s.  The\nburden  of  adjustment  in  the  1990s  has  been  largely  borne  by  the  development  expenditure,\nwhich  as  a  proportion  of  the  GDP  is  now  at  the  lowest  level  ever.  Given  Pakistan\u2019s  high  and\nrising  levels  of  poverty,  and  the  low  level  of  human  development,  there  is  a  need  to  increase\ndevelopment spending. Therefore, the Government needs to focus more on reforms to improve\nrevenue collection by broadening the tax base and strengthening tax administration. In addition,\nit  must  improve  public  expenditure  management;  eliminate  untargeted  subsidies;  and  most\nimportantly,  stop  the  massive  hemorrhaging  of  public  resources  by  loss-incurring  state-owned\nenterprises (SOEs). The Government has announced an ambitious privatization program, and if\nimplemented  it  would  help  to  reduce  the  fiscal  burden  of  the  loss-incurring  SOEs,  and  also\ngenerate  resources  for  both  debt  retirement  and  poverty  reduction.  However,  thus  far  the\nGovernment  has  been  concentrating  on  measures  to  create  equal  conditions  and  an  enabling\nenvironment  for  privatization,  and  now  it  needs  to  focus  on  completing  some  of  the  major\nprivatizations planned for the next year to demonstrate its seriousness and commitment.\n\n11.\nAnother  important  economic  policy  issue  is  economic  restructuring  to  enhance  the\nefficiency  and  outward  orientation  of  the  agriculture  and  manufacturing  sectors.  This  is\nnecessary for Pakistan to improve its external balance, service its huge external debt, and meet\nthe  challenges  of  globalization.  The  Government  has  been  implementing  a  program  of  trade\nliberalization since the 1990s. The maximum tariff rate, which stood at 90 percent in 1991, was\nreduced  to  45  percent  in  1997  and  to  30  percent  in  2001.  As  a  result,  the  effective  tariff  rate\n(i.e.,  tax  revenues  from  international  trade  as  a  proportion  of  total  imports)  declined  from  30\npercent in 1991 to 12 percent in 2000. However, the trade liberalization policies have not had\nthe desired impact because of the balance of payments crisis, slow economic growth, and the\nlow level of private investment since the mid-1990s. But the export performance of the last two\nyears gives some hope that the restructuring process is beginning to have an effect.\n\n12.\nThe key development issue is the need to address the governance failure underlying the\neconomic problems confronting Pakistan today. The Government has initiated a number of civil\n\n                  \n\n6 \n\nIn  2001,  development  expenditure  was  reduced  to  an  all-time  low  of  2.8  percent  of  GDP.  Such  low  levels  of\ndevelopment spending are likely to have serious implications for poverty reduction and physical infrastructure.\n\n\f4\n\nservice and administrative reforms, including an anticorruption drive and merit-based and more\ntransparent  recruitment  and  promotion  systems.  However,  devolution  is  the  centerpiece  of\nPakistan\u2019s  governance  reform  program.  The  objective  is  to  enhance  public  accountability  and\ntransform the society in the medium term into a more democratic and equitable one. The Local\nGovernment  2000  Plan,  announced  in  March  2000,  envisages  a  three-tiered  local-level\ngovernment  system.  The  basic  underlying  principles  are  \"people-centered,  rights-  and\nresponsibility-based,  and  service-oriented\"  government  structures.  Elected  local  governments\ntook power on 14 August 2001. Since delivery of almost all public services will be devolved to\nthe local governments, successful implementation of the plan will have far-reaching implications\nfor accelerating poverty reduction and human development in the country. The implementation\nwill  need  to  be  closely  monitored  because  of  the  fiscal  devolution  component,  which  could\nadversely  affect  the  fiscal  position  of  the  country  as  a  whole  and  thus  put  at  risk  the  ongoing\nstabilization program of the Government.\n\nC.\n\nPoverty Reduction\n\nAfter falling in the 1980s, the incidence of poverty has been rising in Pakistan since the\n13.\n1990s.  At  the  end  of  the  1980s,  one  of  five  Pakistanis  was  poor;  today  it  is  one  of  three.\nAlthough  Pakistan  has  no  official  poverty  line  and  estimates  vary,  there  is  agreement  that  the\nincidence  of  poverty  currently  ranges  between  30  and  35  percent.  Despite  the  Social  Action\nProgram,  primary  and  middle  school  enrolment  rates  have  declined  since  the  1990s.  While\ninfant  and  maternal  mortality  rates  and  the  total  fertility  rate  declined  during  the  1990s,  they\ncontinue  to  be  among  the  highest  in  the  region.  Significant  gender  gaps  also  remain  in  key\nindicators  of  human  development.  Poverty  in  rural  areas,  where  two  out  of  five  persons  are\npoor, is much higher than the national average. Among the rural areas, the incidence of poverty\nis highest in southern Punjab, large parts of Sindh, and almost all of Balochistan. There is also a\nwidening  gap  in  education  between  the  rural  and  urban  areas,  and  the  primary  school\nenrollment rate in the rural areas is only two thirds of the urban rate.\n\nSlow economic growth was the immediate cause of the increase in poverty in Pakistan in\n14.\nthe  1990s.  The  underlying  cause,  however,  was  poor  governance,  which  includes  social\nexclusion of the poor; failure to control ethnic and sectarian violence; poor fiscal management;\nfailure  to  address  accountability  and  performance  issues  within  the  public  service;  and\novercentralization, resulting in continuing tensions between the federal and provincial levels of\ngovernment. The slowdown in economic growth and expanding debt burden also resulted in a\nshrinking  public  sector  development  program  and  declining  employment  opportunities,  which\ncompounded  the  problem  of  poverty  in  the  1990s.  ADB\u2019s  poverty  analysis  also  identified  the\nlack  of  nonfarm  employment  opportunities,  which  are  largely  determined  by  the  extent  of\nrural-urban linkages, as the key explanatory variable in the regional differences in the incidence\nof poverty in rural areas.\n\nIn  February  2001,  the  Government  released  its  Three-Year  Poverty  Reduction\n15.\nProgramme  2001-2004.  The  five  pillars  of  the  program  are  (i)  macroeconomic  reforms  to\npromote growth, (ii) physical asset creation for the poor, (iii) social asset creation for the poor,\n(iv)  provision  of  social  safety  nets  to  protect  the  most  vulnerable  groups,  and  (v)  good\ngovernance. The Government's strategy to achieve higher growth and build a more self-reliant\neconomy includes (i) transforming the agriculture sector into a dynamic, high-yielding, market-\nbased sector; (ii) creating a broad-based manufacturing structure oriented towards exports, with\nparticular  attention  to  small  and  medium  enterprise  development;  (iii)  encouraging  oil  and  gas\nexploration  and  development;  and  (iv)  developing  information  technology  and  the  software\nindustry.  However,  structural  adjustment  under  the  IMF  program  involves  reducing  market\ndistortions, fiscal and monetary compression, and structural reforms such as increases in public\n\n\f5\n\nutility tariffs and indirect taxes, which could lead to further pressure on the poor. Therefore, the\nrole of good governance, targeted interventions, and improvements in access to basic services\nwill  be  crucial  in  mitigating  the  adverse  impacts  of  macroeconomic  stabilization  and  structural\nadjustment on the poor.\n\nA.\n\nBackground and Recent Performance\n\nIV.\n\nTHE SECTOR\n\nPakistan was a leading world exporter of raw cotton and rice through the 1990s. In 2000,\n16.\nthe  agriculture  sector  was  the  major  source  of  exports    (about  70  percent),  including  raw  and\nprocessed  cotton,  rice,  leather,  textiles,  and  carpets.  Over  90  percent  of  the  total  farm  output\ncomes from irrigated land. Major crops are wheat, cotton, rice, sugarcane, and fodder; and crops\naccounted for about 60 percent of agricultural GDP in 1999 and 26 percent of total GDP. Pakistan\nattained  self-sufficiency  in  wheat  production  (the  staple  food)  for  most  of  the  1980s  but  was\nunable  to  sustain  a  high  growth  rate.  Wheat  surpluses  were  again  attained  in  2000  and  2001,\nlargely due to the Government's price supports and improvements in extension deliveries, notably\nin  Punjab.  However,  there  are  major  concerns  about  agricultural  productivity  and  profitability.\nBetween  1990  and  1999,  the  agriculture  sector  grew  at  about  3  percent  per  year.  Given\nPakistan's  rapid  population  growth  rate  of  about  2.5  percent  per  year,  per  capita  agricultural\ngrowth  is  even  more  discouraging  in  comparison  with  other  countries  in  the  region,  such  as\nPeople's Republic of China, Thailand, and Indonesia.\n\n17.\nUnder a World Bank- and IMF-funded structural adjustment program during the 1980s,\nthe  Government  committed  itself  to  bringing  input  and  output  prices  closer  to  world  levels,\nreducing public expenditure, and enhancing the role of the private sector. As a consequence, a\nnumber of policy decisions became inevitable. For example, subsidies on pesticides, seeds, and\nmechanization were withdrawn in one step in the early 1980s. In addition, a phased removal of\nthe fertilizer subsidy was instituted in cooperation with ADB, which has since resulted in periodic\nincreases in fertilizer prices and an expanded role for the private sector in fertilizer production,\ndistribution,  and  import.  However,  the  agriculture  sector  still  remains  distorted.  Several\nmacroeconomic policy changes are currently being implemented in agreement with IMF and the\nWorld Bank as discussed above.\n\n18.\nLike  price  distortions,  government  intervention  in  agricultural  markets  has  been  quite\ncommon  in  order  to  make  price  controls  more  effective.  For  example,  since  the  1950s,  the\nGovernment has continued to procure, store, trade, and distribute major agricultural inputs and\ncommodities  to  varying  degrees.  Even  after  the  World  Bank  and  IMF  structural  adjustment\nprograms during the 1980s, SOEs or parastatal organizations continued to operate along with\nthe newly emerging private sector. The public sector has a major market share in wheat (about\n67  percent  of  the  marketed  surplus),  fertilizer  (40  percent),  and  seed  (50  percent),  and  SOEs\nregularly intervene in cotton and rice markets.\n\n19.\nLocal,  provincial,  and  federal  governments  levy  taxes  on  agriculture  in  one  form  or\nanother. These taxes included direct, indirect, and implicit taxes. The historic land revenue and\nits cesses, octroi7 (until its abolition in 2000), income tax, wealth tax, and export duties fall in the\ncategory of direct taxes. There are also indirect taxes (including customs and excise duties, and\nsales taxes) and implicit taxes (such as procurement prices for the major commodities less than\ninternational prices). The sum of direct, indirect, and implicit taxes is very high in agriculture\u2014\n\n                  \n7  Octroi means a tax on the internal movement of goods.\n\n\f6\n\nestimated at 32 percent of total agriculture income in 1999.8 Even the net tax after subtraction of\nsubsidies  and  government  expenditure  on  agriculture  and  irrigation  is  high,  estimated  at  29\npercent  in  1999.  Pakistan  has  a  long  history  of  taxing  agriculture  through  the  land  revenue\nsystem.  The  replacement  of  the  system  with  an  agricultural  income  tax  has  been  widely\nproposed  to  meet  the  financial  needs  of  the  growing  national  economy.  Under  pressure  from\nADB  (through  the  completed  Agriculture  Program  Loan),9  the  World  Bank,  and  IMF,  Pakistan\nintroduced various types of agricultural income tax, in part in 1993 and in full during 1996, but\nimplementation  problems  remain.  Implicit  taxes  generally  arise  as  a  result  of  government\nintervention  in  the  agricultural  commodity,  input,  and  foreign  exchange  markets.  It  is  this\ninterventionist  price  policy  that  has  implicitly  taxed  the  agriculture  sector  from  time  to  time.\nTaking into account such implicit taxation, agriculture's total tax burden has been estimated to\nbe roughly double that of the nonagricultural sectors.\n\nB.\n\nSector Institutions\n\n20.\nThe institutions that provide services and regulatory functions both in the public (federal\nand provincial level) and the private (multinational and national) sectors are numerous. A review\nof  the  major  institutions  impacting  on  the  Program  is  provided  with  their  responsibilities,\nperformance, and suggested institutional reforms. Details are in Appendix 2.\n\n1.\n\nMinistry  of Food, Agriculture, and Livestock\n\n21.\nThe  Ministry  of  Food,  Agriculture,  and  Livestock  (MINFAL)  is  responsible  for  economic\ncoordination and policy planning of agriculture, food security, livestock, and fisheries activities.\nMINFAL is staffed with about 100 officers (technical and administrative) and about 400 support\nstaff.  MINFAL  has  several  wings  namely  (i)  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Wing  (primarily\nresponsible  for  general  administration,  finance,  and  budget),  (ii)  the  Food  Wing  (primarily\nresponsible for supervision of the Directorate General of Food, the Pakistan Agricultural Storage\nand  Services  Corporation  [PASSCO],  the  Agriculture  and  Livestock  Products  Marketing  and\nGrading  Department  [ALMA],  and  the  Agricultural  Prices  Commission  [APCOM]),  (iii)  the\nPlanning  Wing  (primarily  responsible  for  preparation  of  development  programs  and  annual\nplans),  (iv)  the  Agriculture  Development  Wing  (primarily  responsible  for  supervision  of  several\nautonomous  institutions,  including  the  Fertilizer  Import  Department  [FID],  the  Soil  Survey  of\nPakistan,  the  Federal  Seed  Certification  and  Registration  Department,  the  Pakistan  Central\nCotton Committee, the Pakistan Cotton Standards Institute, the Pakistan Agricultural Research\nCouncil [PARC], the Pakistan Oilseeds Development Board, and the Korangi Fish Harbor), (v)\nthe  Water  Management  Cell  (primarily  responsible  for  coordination  of  the  on-farm  water\nmanagement activities of the provinces), and (vi) the Economic Wing (primarily responsible for\ncollecting  and  disseminating  agricultural  statistics,  formulation  of  agricultural  policy,  and\npreparation of import and export trade policies, World Trade Organization-related policies, and\nbriefs).\n\n22.\nAgriculture  and  livestock  are  mainly  provincial  matters,  and  MINFAL  needs  to  be\nreorganized  to  rationalize  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  secretariat.  FID,  the  Directorate\nGeneral of Food, and PASSCO are responsible for the import, procurement, storage of fertilizer,\nand food distribution at the federal level. These institutions are overstaffed; heavily dependent\non  budgetary  support;  and  wasteful  due  to  poor  governance,  financial  indiscipline,  and\n\n                  \n\n8  Chaudhry, M.G., R.M.

With  the  Government's  planned  liberalization  of  trade  and  expansion  of  the  private\nsector  in  import,  export,  and  domestic  trade  and  storage  activities,  these  institutions  will  be\nredundant and should be closed and divested.\n\nSome  of  the  institutions,  such  as  PARC,  are  overstaffed  and  generally  duplicate  the\n23.\nfunctions being carried out at the provincial level. The federal institutions can continue to work\nas  clearing  and  coordinating  agencies,  and  can  conduct  other  functions  that  cannot  be\ndecentralized. Some of the institutions such as APCOM and ALMA can be made more effective\nby merging them with MINFAL's Planning Wing.\n\n2.\n\nOther Federal Institutions\n\n24.\nThe  Trading  Corporation  of  Pakistan  (TCP)  is  a  public  sector  organization  under  the\nMinistry  of  Commerce,  responsible  for  the  marketing  of  surplus  agricultural  commodities.  TCP\nhas  incorporated  the  former  parastatals,  the  Cotton  Export  Corporation,  and  the  Rice  Export\nCorporation  of  Pakistan,  along  with  their  liabilities.  The  staffs  of  the  two  organizations  were\nreleased,  and  a  limited  number  have  been  absorbed  in  TCP  for  winding-up  activities.  TCP\nreceives  budgetary  support  from  the  Government  for  the  losses  incurred  in  trading  of\nagricultural  commodities.  The  National  Fertilizer  Development  Centre  (NFDC)  under  the\nPlanning Commission is also a candidate for closure, and National Fertilizer Marketing Limited\n(NFML) under the Ministry of Production is being privatized.\n\n3.\n\nProvincial Institutions\n\nthe  agricultural  extension  departments,  agricultural  research \n\n25.\nAlthough the Federal Government is largely responsible for policy matters, the provincial\ngovernments  are  mainly  responsible  for  implementing  policy,  and  agriculture  and  the  social\nsectors are considered provincial subjects. The provincial agriculture departments oversee the\nmanagement  of  research,  extension,  maintenance  and  regulation  of  commodity  markets,  the\nprovincial  seed  corporations,  and  provincial  input  supply  organizations.  The  departments\nthe\nsupervise \nagricultural machinery and engineering departments, the soil conservation departments, and the\non-farm water management departments. They also supervise the provincial seed and fertilizer\nstorage and marketing institutions, such as the Punjab Seed Corporation (PSC), the Sindh Seed\nCorporation  (SSC),  the  Sindh  Agricultural  Supplies  Organization  (SASO),  and  the  Agriculture\nDevelopment  Agency  (ADA)  in  North-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP).  The  research  activities\nare very weak due to high establishment costs and inadequate funding for operational activities.\nMoreover,  the  linkage  among  research,  extension,  and  farmers  is  very  weak.  The  research\npursued in the institutes generally does not address farmers' problems. The research institutes,\nto make them responsive to farmers' needs, should be given autonomy, with the majority of the\nmembers of the supervising board drawn from the farming community, processors, and traders.\nThe extension department\u2019s performance is also very poor. The present activities are not farmer\nresponsive.  The  knowledge  and  extension  methods  of  field  staff  are  outdated  and  outmoded.\nLivestock extension also is overstaffed, and the delivery efficiency of services is very poor.\n\ninstitutes,10 \n\n4.\n\nPrivate Institutions\n\nNumerous  multinational  and  national  private  sector  fertilizer,  pesticide,  and  seed\n26.\ncompanies  and  machinery  suppliers  are  active  and  provide  input  supply  services  along  with\n\n                  \n\n10  In  North-West  Frontier  Province,  the  research  and  outreach  functions  have  been  put  under  the  Agricultural\nUniversity,  while  the  Agriculture  Department  continues  to  supervise  the  agricultural  extension  and  agricultural\nmachinery functions.\n\n\f8\n\nextension services. Private seed companies have to compete with public sector companies that\nhave the advantage of budgetary support from the Government. Several NGOs (particularly the\nRural Support Programs throughout the country) have shown interest in the extension activities,\nbut  they  lack  the  resources.  They  can  provide  these  services  to  farmers  in  a  cost-effective\nmanner by linking farming communities with the relevant research and extension staff.\n\nC.\n\nConstraints and Issues\n\n27.\nA number of key issues and constraints affect the sector. A detailed cause and effect or\nproblem tree analysis was conducted during preparation of the Program that proved effective in\nfocusing the proposed Program on a few selected areas. Based on this analysis and substantial\ndiscussion with major stakeholders, a program framework was developed (Appendix 1). The core\nproblems in Pakistan\u2019s agriculture are low productivity and profitability. The major causes of low\nproductivity  and  profitability  include  (i)  low  quality  inputs,  (ii)  imperfect  commodity  markets  (with\nrelated  pricing,  subsidy,  storage,  and  trade  issues),  (iii)  poor  quality  support  services  (research\nand extension services especially for small farmers), (iv) inefficient water resource management,\n(v) poor delivery and sustainability of agricultural finance, (vi) inadequate rural infrastructure, (vii)\ndeteriorating natural resources, and (viii) insecure land tenure. There are problems of land tenure,\ninsecure property rights, and labor markets, particularly in the southern areas of Sindh Province,\nand a separate project is currently being prepared to address these issues.11 ADB and the World\nBank  are  actively  assisting  Pakistan  in  the  areas  of  water  resource  management,  agricultural\nfinance, rural infrastructure, and natural resources. However, there are major gaps in assistance\nfor  market  development  (for  both  commodity  outputs  and  inputs)  and  support  and  regulatory\nservices. The major effects of these problems are low agricultural growth, rising unemployment,\nand  increasing  rural  poverty.  Crop  production  has  remained  stagnant  or  has  declined  in  some\ncases due to poor market development, inadequate price incentives, poor seed, low fertilizer use,\ndisease problems, poor water management, and increasing costs of production.\n\n28.\nIn terms of output per hectare, productivity for wheat and rice has risen slowly in recent\nyears, while productivity growth has remained stagnant for cotton and sugarcane. Growth rates\nin  yield  during  1990-2000  have  averaged  2.0  percent  for  wheat,  3.1  percent  for  rice,  -0.9\npercent  for  cotton,  and  1.8  percent  for  sugarcane.  Other  indicators  of  productivity  are  (i)  yield\ngaps,  or  the  difference  between  average  and  best  farmers'  yields;  and  (ii)  total  factor\nproductivity, an index of all outputs and inputs. The yield gap is as high as 30 percent for wheat\nand 50 percent for rice, and total factor productivity has either stagnated or declined since the\nmid-1970s.12  Major  obstacles  to  yield  increases  include  resource  constraints  and  policy\ndistortions.\n\n29.\nKey resource constraints include a problem-plagued irrigation system, inadequate human\nresources,  poor  infrastructure,  and  resource  degradation.  By  examining  various  cropping\nsystems over a time series from the introduction of the Green Revolution (1966-1974), through\nthe period of intensification (1975-1984), and including the Post Green Revolution (1984-1994),\nAli  and  Byerlee13  demonstrate  that  while  there  is  continuous  and  widespread  resource\n\n                  \n\n11  TA 3132-PAK: Sindh Rural Development Project, for $800,000, approved on 22 December 1998, and completed\non 1 November 2000; and TA 3725-PAK: Additional Preparatory Work on the Sindh Rural Development Project,\nfor $150,000, approved on 24 September 2001.\n\n12  Byerlee,  D.  and  A.

Byerlee,  Productivity Growth and Resource Degradation in Pakistan's Punjab: A Decomposition\n\nAnalysis, the World Bank, Washington, November 2000.\n\n\f9\n\ndegradation,  the  health  of  the  agrosystem  is  also  related  to  poorly  introduced  modern\ntechnologies,  monocropping,  and  mismanagement  of  water  resources.  Increasing  population\ngrowth,  decreasing  farm  size,  degrading  soil  and  water  resources,  and  lack  of  diversified\nproduction systems suggest that Pakistan is reaching a point where agricultural sustainability is\nproblematic. With past sources of growth weakening, future growth will have to come primarily\nfrom  productivity  gains,  which  can  be  achieved  by  (i)  allocating  resources  to  crops  that\ndemonstrate  comparative  advantage,  (ii)  improving  the  technical  efficiency  of  inputs  and  farm\nmanagement, and (iii) increasing cropping intensity.\n\n30.\nIn  addition  to  resource  constraints,  Pakistan's  agriculture  faces  numerous  policy\nconstraints. Government intervention in agricultural markets remains excessive, and, particularly\nin  the  cases  of  wheat,  sugarcane,  and  seeds,  has  discouraged  sustainable  and  efficient\nproduction and marketing. This intervention, coupled with powerful private marketing associations\nin cotton and quality problems in rice, has led to low farmer prices, low profitability for farmers, and\nfew incentives for growth in productivity. Government spending has been dominated by subsidies\nthat  typically  do  not  help  farmers,  either  because  of  inefficiencies  or  because  the  subsidy  (on\nwheat  in  particular)  is  designed  to  help  consumers  at  the  expense  of  producers.  Producers  will\nrespond  to  credible  price  reforms  that  will  introduce  market-based  incentives.  Public  marketing\nenterprises and subsidies currently crowd out private sector involvement. Restricting membership\nin trading and marketing associations limits competition. Research and extension are particularly\nweak  and  ineffective,  and  do  not  contribute  substantially  to  productivity  gains  by  small  farmers.\nThe  proper  role  of  the  Government  should  be  to  encourage  the  development  of  smoothly\nfunctioning  markets  through  institutional  and  regulatory  reforms  that  facilitate  private  sector  and\nsmall farmer activities. As a result of current government interventions and policies, productivity\nincentives are weak, particularly for small farms (less than 5 hectares), which constitute 80-90\npercent of all farms and include marginal farms (less than 2 hectares).\n\n31.\nThe  problems  and  constraints  in  the  markets  for  the  major  commodities  (wheat,  cotton,\nrice, and sugar), key inputs (fertilizer and seeds), and support services to farmers (extension and\nresearch) are discussed in detail in the following subsections. Wheat is the major winter or rabi\ncrop,  cotton  and  rice  are  major  summer  (monsoon)  or  kharif crops,  and  sugarcane  is  a  9-12\nmonth crop.\n\n1.\n\nWheat\n\n32.\nThe  production  of  Pakistan\u2019s  major  food  crop  has  averaged  about  18  million  tons  per\nannum over the last five years, ranging from about 17 million tons in 1996 and 1997 to 21 million\ntons  in  2000.  After  a  hiatus  of  about  10  years  since  the  1980s,  Pakistan  again  achieved  self-\nsufficiency  in  wheat  in  2000,  and  the  estimated  production  in  2001  is  19-20  million  tons.\nHistorically, about 65-70 percent of the total production is consumed on the farm or traded within\nthe  local  area,  with  a  marketable  surplus  of  about  5-6  million  tons.  The  Government  regularly\nprocures about 4 million tons for the Strategic Reserve and buffer stock. The remaining quantities\nare  sold  in  open  markets.  However,  the  Government  reserves  the  right  to  procure  more  wheat,\nand in 2000, it procured a total of 8.6 million tons, practically the entire marketed surplus. Punjab\nis the only wheat surplus province, and Pakistan has traditionally imported wheat (about 2 million\ntons  annually),  entirely  through  MINFAL\u2019s  Directorate  of  Food  and  the  US  Embassy  in\nWashington.  Wheat  is  procured  by  the  Government  through  PASSCO,  and  by  provincial\ngovernments  through  their  food  departments,  at  the  support  price  announced  by  MINFAL\n(prepared  by  APCOM).  PASSCO  purchases  wheat  from  Punjab,  supplies  the  provincial  food\n\n\f10\n\ndepartments,  and  stores  wheat  for  the  national  Strategic  Reserve.14  The  total  wheat  storage\ncapacity  in  the  public  sector  is  about  5.2  million  tons,  including  1.3  million  tons  with  PASSCO\nand  3.9  million  tons  with  the  provinces.15  Restrictions  on  wheat  movement,  particularly  in\nPunjab, during harvest time force farmers to sell to the public sector, and as a result, farmers\nreceive lower prices than they would otherwise.\n\n33.\nLater,  government  agencies  sell  the  wheat  to  flour  mills  at  a  subsidized  issue  (sales)\nprice.  The  subsidy  is  equivalent  to  the  procurement  price  plus  incidental  costs  (storage,  debt\nservicing, bags, salaries, and transportation) less the issue price.16 In addition, imported wheat\nmay be subsidized so that the landed price of imports equals the support price. For many years,\nthe support price was below the world price, but in 2000, due to an increase in the procurement\nprice, the procurement price was more or less equivalent to the world price (about $118-125 per\nton). In 2001, the procurement price (about $117 per ton) was less than the export parity price\n(about $126 per ton). The Government, through TCP, exported about 200,000 tons of wheat in\n2001 to Iraq at an average price of about $108 per ton. There were no imports in 2000, but the\ntotal wheat subsidy on domestic procurement was about PRs13 billion ($213 million) paid from\nthe provincial budget funds. In 1999, the wheat subsidy was about PRs9 billion, and in 1998 it\nwas about PRs13 billion. These subsidy amounts are underestimated, because not all the costs\nof  handling  and  storage  are  included.  About  two  thirds  of  the  subsidy  cost  is  borne  by  the\nprovincial governments, mainly Punjab. The major part of the subsidy goes to mill owners, and a\nminor  part  goes  to  food  consumers.  The  price  supports  benefit  mainly  larger  farmers  and  not\nsmall and marginal farmers. The Government also finances the losses of PASSCO and the food\ndepartments.\n\nThe  public  food  procurement,  storage,  and  sales  program  is  expensive  to  operate  and\n34.\nwasteful of wheat supplies (due to high storage losses), and it does not target the poor (since it\nbenefits  all  flour  consumers)  or  farmers  unless  they  are  net  consumers  of  wheat.  When  the\nsupport price is below the world price, farmers lose out. When the support price is greater than\nthe world price, the consumer subsidizes wheat farmers. Also, the Punjab Government has until\nrecently restricted the free movement of wheat out of the province and between districts in order\nto  guarantee  that  it  can  procure  all  the  wheat  it  wishes  at  the  support  price.  Punjab\u2019s  wheat\nfarmers would benefit from a policy that would encourage a higher farmgate price through free\nmovement of wheat and no subsidies to mill owners. Incentives to investment in private storage\nand  to  long-term  trading  have  been  thwarted  through  both  price  policy  and  restricting  free\nmovement of wheat. Conscious of these problems, the Punjab Government constituted in 2001\na  Task  Force  on  the  Procurement  and  Marketing  of  Wheat.  This  task  force  is  proposing  to\nincrease  private  sector  participation  in  wheat  marketing,  storage,  and  export,  as  well  as\nexamining the proper role of government in the wheat trade. Wheat imports and exports should\nalso  be  liberalized  to  improve  food  security.  Poor  consumers  of  wheat  would  be  better\nsupported through direct and targeted programs, and the Government is proposing food support\nand zakat (mandated Islamic cash transfer) programs in this regard.\n\n                  \n\n14\n\n15\n\nIn addition to PASSCO's share of the total annual procurement at about 30 percent, the average provincial shares\nare Punjab, 60 percent; Sindh, 10 percent; and NWFP and Balochistan, less than 1 percent each.\nIncluding  2,483,000  tons  with  Punjab,  709,000  tons  with  Sindh,  365,000  tons  with  NWFP,  218,000  tons  with\nBalochistan,  44,000  tons  with  Azad  Kashmir,  20,000  tons  with  the  Northern  Areas,  and  54,000  tons  with  the\nmilitary. PASSCO\u2019s storage capacity includes 0.45 million tons covered and 0.85 million tons open using raised\nplatforms and tarps.\n\n16  Currently, the procurement price is PRs300/40 kg or PRs7,500 per ton, and the issue price is PRs8,000 per ton in\nPunjab and PRs8,500 per ton in other provinces. Incidental costs are about PRs1,800 per ton with PASSCO, and\nthe rate of subsidy is about PRs1,300 per ton, not including all the costs of the provincial food departments.\n\n\f11\n\n2.\n\nCotton\n\n35.\nThe  production  of  Pakistan\u2019s  major  cash  or  export  crop  has  averaged  about  10  million\nbales  per  annum  over  the  last  five  years,  ranging  from  about  9.4  million  bales  in  1996  to  11.2\nmillion bales in 2000. The estimated production in 2001 is 10.7 million bales. By 1995 cotton had\nbecome almost as important as wheat in terms of value added, accounting for about 3 percent of\nthe  total  GDP  in  1999,  more  or  less  equivalent  to  the  share  of  wheat.  Expansion  of  cotton\nproduction,  due  in  large  part  to  the  introduction  of  insect-  and  disease-resistant  varieties  and  a\nfree  trade  policy  that  was  introduced  in  FY1996  removing  import  and  export  duties,  caused  a\ncorresponding decline in the relative importance of sugar and rice. There are over 1,100 ginning\nfactories  that  buy  from  farmers  and  marketing  agents  and  separate  the  seed  from  the  lint.  The\nginners  are  organized  through  the  Pakistan  Cotton  Ginners  Association.  There  are  about  500\ntextile mills, but there is concern that they are oligopolistic, since they are owned by only 30-40\nextended  families  and  are  organized  in  the  powerful  All  Pakistan  Textile  Mills  Association.  The\nKarachi  Cotton  Association  largely  dominates  exports  of  raw  cotton,  lint,  and  yarn.  There  is  a\nneed  for  more  competition  in  exports,  imports,  and  processing  by  encouraging  other  smaller\ntraders and ginners in order to raise farmgate prices to producers.\n\n36.\nIn 2000, cotton production reached a record 11.2 million bales, the market price crashed,\nand  the  domestic  price  was  much  below  the  world  price.  In  an  effort  to  support  producers,  the\nGovernment,  through  TCP,  procured  about  10,000  bales  for  export  in  2000  and  about  500,000\nbales in 1999. These actions by the Government encouraged additional exports of cotton lint and\nyarn  by  the  private  sector,  and  the  domestic  price  gradually  rose.  Unfortunately,  TCP's  actions\ncrowded out the private sector. There may eventually be a need for a futures market to stabilize\nprices,  especially  for  ginning  factories.  There  is  also  a  need  for  enhanced  quality  control\nmeasures  to  ensure  the  private  sector  supply  of  quality  products  for  international  and  domestic\nmarkets.\n\n3.\n\nRice\n\n37.\nThe production of milled rice has averaged about 4.5 million tons per annum over the last\nfive  years,  ranging  from  4.0  million  tons  in  1996  to  5.2  million  tons  in  2000.  The  estimated\nproduction  in  2001  is  4.8  million  tons.  Long  grain  basmati  rice  production  was  about  1.8  million\ntons of total production in 2000. Punjab leads the provinces in rice production. Pakistan\u2019s private\nsector exported 1.9 million tons of rice in 2000, and is expected to export about 1.5 million tons in\n2001. Rice has accounted for an average of 6 percent of total export earnings over the last five\nyears. The mixing and export of basmati and short grain rice in 2000 by some in the private sector\nadversely affected the reputation of Pakistani basmati rice, pointing to a need for self-regulation\nand some oversight by the public sector for improved quality control. Due to the high production in\n2000  and  the  resulting  drop  in  the  domestic  price  soon  after  harvest,  many  growers  advocated\ngovernment procurement at a support price higher than the open market price. In late September\n2000,  the  Government  announced  an  increase  in  the  support  prices  for  the  various  varieties  of\nrice, and directed PASSCO to procure up to PRs1 billion ($20 million). Large rice exporting firms\nare  organized  into  the  Rice  Exporters  Association  of  Pakistan  (REAP),  but  they  restrict\nmembership, and new and smaller exporting firms do not have representation or an equal voice\nwith  government  licensing  and  regulatory  authorities.  New  entrants  in  the  market  and  new\nassociations are needed to increase competition with REAP, expand exports, and ensure higher\nprices to producers.\n\n\f12\n\n4.\n\nSugar\n\n38.\nThe production of sugarcane has averaged about 48 million tons per annum over the last\nfive years. Production in 2000 was about 46 million tons and is estimated to be 43.7 million tons in\n2001. About 25 percent of the annual crop is used to process brown sugar (gur). Molasses is a\nbyproduct. In 2000, about 29 million tons of sugarcane was processed into about 2.4 million tons\nof  white  sugar.  The  remainder  was  processed  into  brown  sugar  and  molasses.  The  domestic\ndemand for sugar is 3.1-3.2 million tons annually, and imports average about 0.8-0.9 million tons.\nAlthough Pakistan is the world\u2019s fifth largest producer of sugar, there are major problems. There is\nabout 45 percent overcapacity in the sugar mills, and the average sugar content of sugarcane is\n8.25  percent,  below  the  world  average  of  about  10.0  percent.  As  measured  by  the  domestic\nresource cost, Pakistani sugarcane appears to be noncompetitive, with a domestic resource cost\nof about 2.17 By comparison, cotton, wheat, basmati rice, oilseeds, and pulses had measures less\nthan  one  illustrating  comparative  advantage.  The  sugar  industry  has  been  highly  protected  in\nrecent  years,  and  the  domestic  ex-mill  sugar  price  has  been  about  40  percent  higher  than  the\nlanded world price. Imports were taxed so that the import price plus the tariff would more or less\nequal the domestic price. However in 2000, the duty on imports was reduced from 45 percent to\n20 percent. The import duty was further lowered to 10 percent in June 2001. Relations are also\nstrained between the growers and the 77 mill owners, organized into the powerful Pakistan Sugar\nMills  Association  (PSMA).  The  sugar  industry  has  been  overprotected,  monopsonistic,  highly\nindebted to banks, and inefficient, and was kept competitive with active government support at the\nexpense  of  the  taxpayers  and  sugar  consumers.  Under  the  old  zoning  system,  farmers  were\nrequired to sell sugarcane to the mills in their area. This was abolished in 2000, and growers can\nnow  sell  sugarcane  to  any  mill.  Farmers  have  also  been  restricted  from  producing  brown  sugar\nand  molasses,  a  restriction  that  is  being  abolished.  Brown  sugar  and  molasses  are  in  high\ndemand,  in  both  rural  areas  and  in  Afghanistan,  and  the  removal  of  the  restriction  would  help\nfarmers. Payments are commonly delayed to farmers from sugar mill owners. PSMA is continually\npressuring  the  Government  to  reintroduce  zoning  restrictions  and  raise  import  tariffs  to  protect\ndomestic production and processing.\n\n5.\n\nFertilizer\n\n39.\nThe consumption of fertilizer has averaged about 5 million tons per annum over the last\nfive years (5.4 million tons in 1999 and an estimated 6.5 million tons in 2000), at a growth rate of\nabout  5  percent  per  year,  with  production  of  about  4.5  million  tons  on  average  and  imports  of\nabout 0.5 million tons. Urea fertilizer accounts for about 70 percent of total consumption, followed\nby  diammonium  phosphate  (19  percent)  and  sulphate  of  potash  and  compound  fertilizers  (11\npercent). In terms of nutrients, the ratios of nitrogen to phosphate to potassium use are similar to\nnutrient uses in the region, but below the recommended uses of phosphate and potassium. About\n40 percent of domestic production, largely urea, is in the public sector with the National Fertilizer\nCorporation. The remainder is with three large private fertilizer companies. Imports are currently\nmade  entirely  by  the  private  sector,  and  the  Government  has  agreed  to  close  and  divest  FID.\nImports of urea are very limited. Traditionally, all the diammonium phosphate requirements were\nimported,  but  Fauji  Fertilizer  started  producing  about  700,000  tons  annually  in  2000.  About\n540,000 tons of this fertilizer were imported in 2000, and about 700,000 tons will be imported in\n2001.  The  National  Fertilizer  Corporation  markets  its  fertilizer  through  its  subsidiary,  NFML,  a\n\n                  \n\n17 The domestic resource cost is the ratio of domestic (nontraded) inputs to the value of foreign exchange earned per\nunit of the crop, and a measure of comparative advantage. A value of less than 1 indicates a comparative advantage,\nand a value greater than 1 indicates relatively inefficient production. The data was from 1992: Longmire, J. and P.\nDeboard, Agricultural Pricing and Comparative Advantage in Pakistan, World Bank, Washington, 1993.\n\n\f13\n\ncommercial  but  loss-incurring  institution.  The  five  factories  of  the  National  Fertilizer  Corporation\nare being privatized, starting with the Paksaudi plant in 2001, and NFML will be reorganized and\ndownsized as factories are privatized.\n\nThree  provincial  government  enterprises  have  until  recently  been  distributing  imported\n40.\nfertilizer  (from  FID)  and  other  items  such  as  public  sector  seed,  pesticide,  and  machinery,\nincluding  the  Punjab  Agricultural  Development  and  Supplies  Corporation,  SASO,  and  ADA  in\nNWFP.  These  are  all  loss-incurring  enterprises  that  have  defaulted  on  government  loans,  and\nhave  limited  functions,  given  the  private  sector  domination  of  the  fertilizer  import  and  marketing\noperations. The Government and the provincial governments have decided to close or divest all\nthese institutions.\n\n41.\nFertilizer  subsidies  have  been  eliminated  (direct  subsidies  from  the  Government  were\neliminated in 1996 in large part due to the completed Agriculture Program Loan), but natural gas\nsubsidies continue. The Government is finalizing its new fertilizer policy in consultation with private\nproducers,  and  is  considering  terminating  gas  subsidies  for  all  new  fertilizer  factories  and\ncontracts. Active government support to public sector fertilizer import, production, and marketing\nagencies acts as a major disincentive to private sector open market operations. The Government\ndirected  FID  to  stop  fertilizer  imports  in  1999  and  2000,  and  only  the  private  sector  has  been\nimporting  diammonium  phosphate,  urea,  and  other  fertilizers  in  the  last  two  years.  Private  firms\nvoluntarily  charge  uniform  prices  throughout  the  country  to  stay  competitive.  In  addition,  NFDC\nunder  the  Planning  Commission  is  not  serving  any  useful  purpose,  since  data  on  fertilizer\nsubsector is readily available throughout the country. The Government is therefore considering its\nclosure or divestiture. Provincial governments are continuously monitoring and regulating fertilizer\nimports and retail markets for quality control, and there are no major quality problems. However,\nthere is no existing legislation dealing with the import, certification, and use of chemical fertilizer.\nMINFAL is preparing a Fertilizer Control Ordinance to address regulatory needs in (i) monitoring\nthe quality of imported fertilizer, (ii) registering importers, (iii) compiling data on imports and use,\nand (iv) forecasting demand for imports.\n\n6.\n\nSeeds\n\n42.\nAbout  74,000-80,000  tons  of  certified  seed  are  marketed  annually,  with  wheat  seed\naccounting for about 91 percent and cotton seed about 6 percent. Most seed is passed on from\nfarmer to farmer, and the use of retained seed after harvest is very high. There is an urgent need\nto increase the market for high quality seed to meet farmers' unmet demands. The private sector\naccounts for about half of the seed market, partly attributed to the Agriculture Program. There are\nabout 300 private seed companies, including 4 multinationals. However, most of the certified seed\ndistributed by the private sector is imported seed, and the restricted access to research institution\nvarieties and low demand have not encouraged the establishment of seed farms. The two public\nsector seed agencies, PSC and SSC, are largely loss-incurring operations,18 and also discourage\nprivate sector investment in domestic seed farms. They are good candidates for privatization or\nreorganization  along  commercial  lines  to  effectively  compete  on  equal  terms  with  the  private\nsector. The public research institutes are required by the Government to provide breeder seed for\nnew varieties to PSC and SSC, and as a result, private seed companies do not have easy access\nto this seed. This amounts to a virtual monopoly of the public seed companies on the supply of\nbreeder seed. The Federal Seed Certification and Registration Department and the National Seed\n\n                  \n\n18 PSC\u2019s performance has been mixed since its establishment in 1976, but SSC has never been able to generate a\nprofit and is highly subsidized by the Sindh Government. SSC depends on PSC for its seed. Details are in Ahmed,\nM. J., Performance Evaluations of PSC and SSC, World Bank, Islamabad, November 1998.\n\n\f14\n\nCouncil  under  MINFAL  are  responsible  for  ensuring  high  quality  seed  and  genetic  material,  but\nthey  have  poor  implementation  capacity  and  lack  a  clear  mandate  to  assist  in  ensuring  and\nregulating quality seed. The private sector should finance its own certifications of high quality seed\naccording to national guidelines.\n\n7.\n\nExtension\n\n43.\nThere are more than 5,000 extension workers throughout the country, who basically follow\nthe top-down and supply-driven training and visit (T&V) extension system introduced in the 1980s\nlargely with World Bank assistance. This system\u2019s centralized and hierarchical approach targets\nassistance to powerful landlords and larger farmers. Small farmers and women are often ignored.\nIn addition, provincial  extension  workers, both field workers and agriculture officers at the union\ncouncil level, suffer from lack of funds and mobility and poor linkage with research workers and\navailable technologies. Extension is not coordinated, and each line department at the district level\nand  below  conducts  its  own  separate  extension  services.  Field  workers  and  agriculture  officers\nhave no expertise in organizing small farmers into groups and adopting participatory, bottom-up\nplanning  procedures.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Implementation  Completion  Report  for  the  Agricultural\nResearch II Project (December 1998) found little overall improvement in extension and research\nlinkages.  However,  the  Punjab  Government  is  experimenting  with  several  new  initiatives  that\nshow considerable promise. Among them is the Model Union Council Project, which works with\nthe leading NGOs in Punjab, the Punjab Rural Support Program, and the National Rural Support\nProgram. The Model Union Council Project has been implemented for one year.\n\n44.\nAnother  alternative  to  the  T&V  system  that  has  been  successfully  replicated  throughout\nSoutheast  Asia  (notably  in  Indonesia,  Philippines,  and  Viet  Nam)  is  the  farmer  field  school\napproach to problem solving with groups of farmers. This approach has been implemented in 10\nvillages  of  Vehari  District  of  Punjab  since  1997,  and  is  based  on  group  training  mechanisms.\nHand-picked  agriculture  officers  are  trained  by  experienced  agriculture  officers  from  Southeast\nAsia in management and key agriculture skills to work with groups of farmers in problem solving.\nAn interesting feature of this approach is that farmers typically choose to use lower levels of inputs\n(pesticides, herbicides, and chemical fertilizers) in the first year, with an immediate benefit in yield\nincrease. They also save money on input use. In the second year, more emphasis is placed on\ncareful crop management and use of inputs to increase the productivity of crops and livestock. In\nSoutheast  Asia,  some  extension  services  are  being  privatized  as  the  skills  and  value  of  the\nagriculture  officers  increase,  and  they  voluntarily  leave  government  service  to  commercially  sell\ntheir services to groups of farmers. This program has also been replicated on a modest scale in\nPunjab and Sindh since 2000 in connection with an integrated pest management program under\nMINFAL with financing from ADB.19\n\n45.\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Pilot Food Security Program also uses the\nfarmer field school and group-based extension approach, but is focused on using existing water\nuser associations. These associations are usually dormant after watercourse improvements under\ngovernment programs, and the objective is to make them operational again for crop and livestock\nproductivity improvements.\n\n19 TA 3383-PAK: Integrated Pest Management, for $500,000, approved on 28 December 1999, and expected to be\n\n                  \n\ncompleted on 31 March 2003.\n\n\f15\n\n8.\n\nResearch\n\n46.\nPakistan  has  a  sizable  network  of  national  and  provincial  research  institutions.  The\nresearch and extension system was originally unified in the agricultural universities patterned after\nthe  United  States  land  grant  model.  But  in  1961,  research,  extension,  and  education  were\ndelinked  and  given  to  the  provincial  governments.  PARC  under  MINFAL  coordinates  national\nresearch.  PARC  provides  funding  and  supervision  monitoring  to  its  affiliate,  the  National\nAgricultural  Research  Council  (NARC),  in  the  areas  of  crops,  machinery,  natural  resources,\nanimal sciences, and social sciences, and to four other research institutes. MINFAL supports not\nonly  PARC  but  also  research  institutes  in  cotton,  marketing,  forestry,  soils,  and  zoology.  The\nPakistan Atomic Energy Commission also conducts research in the major crops. There are also\nnumerous research institutes at the provincial level in the areas of crops, soils, insects, diseases,\nlivestock,  fisheries,  forestry,  irrigation,  and  economics:  41  in  Punjab,  10  in  Sindh,  10  in\nBalochistan, and 6 in NWFP. In addition, the major agricultural universities in Punjab, Sindh, and\nNWFP  are  conducting  agricultural  research.  The  private  sector  is  also  conducting  research  but\nlacks funding. There is little sharing or coordinating of research findings. Funding for research is a\nproblem with all institutions, and most spend 70-90 percent of their available funds on salaries and\nexpenses. Funding for public sector research has fallen from PRs600 million in 1995, to PRs355\nmillion  in  1999.  Trained  staff  and  infrastructure  exist,  but  the  priorities  and  linkages  between\nresearch  and  extension  are  very  weak.  There  is  little  focus  on  integrating  available  information\nand technologies into packages for small farmers. Research institutes are not allowed to sell their\ngenetic  materials  to  private  seed  companies  despite  the  high  demand,  particularly  for  new\nvarieties; nor are they allowed to retain part of the royalties to help meet the funding gaps.\n\nD.\n\nGovernment Objectives, Strategies, and Plans\n\n47. \nThe  Government  is  cognizant  that  agricultural  development  is  vital  in  reviving  the\neconomy  and  reducing  poverty.  The  Government  aims  to  achieve  robust  and  sustainable\ngrowth through efficient import substitution, export orientation, and enhanced productivity. With\nthese  key  objectives,  the  main  element  is  to  accelerate  growth  by  enhancing  per  hectare\nproductivity  through  price  incentives,  support  services,  and  market  reforms.  In  this  way,  the\nGovernment  hopes  to  increase  profitability  for  small  farmers.  Attention  will  be  focused  on\nincreasing the production of wheat, cotton, and rice through remunerative market-based prices;\nevolving  new  technologies  through  research;  help  improving  marketing  and  storage  facilities,\nboth in the public and the private sectors; and providing access to optimum technologies to the\nfarmers, especially to small and marginal farmers.\n\nThe  Economic  Advisory  Board  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  has  prepared  an\n48.\nEconomic  Revival  Program  (February  2001).  It  was  recognized  that  increasing  growth  in  the\nagriculture sector would assure significant poverty reduction in rural areas. In addition, MINFAL\nprepared  \u201cAgricultural  Strategies  for  the  First  Decade  of  New  Millennium\u201d  (June  2000),  which\nwas approved by the Government in March 2001. TA 3229-PAK (footnote 1) contributed to this\ndocument. This strategy recognizes that agricultural production has stagnated and is no longer\nkeeping  pace  with  population  growth.  In  response,  the  strategy  sets  goals  at  achieving  an\nannual  rate  of  production  increase  averaging  5  percent  and  achieving  food  security  and  self-\nreliance by 2010. The document also highlights the failures in extension and research services\nand the resulting poor yields especially on small farms.\n\n49.\nThe Government is moving towards market-based agricultural output. It has decided to\nphase  out  price  supports  and  subsidies.  To  help  safeguard  the  interest  of  farmers  against\ndeclines in prices during post-harvest periods, the Government is promoting increased exports,\nprivate  competition,  and  joint  farmer  storage  and  marketing  activities.  The  primary  constraints\n\n\f16\n\nbeing  addressed  are  inadequate  farm-to-market  roads;  fragmented  markets;  lack  of  proper\nstorage, transportation, and processing facilities; and inadequate market information. To support\nexports and investment, the Government is providing PRs99 billion in 2001-2002 exclusively for\nthe  private  sector  in  five  priority  areas,  including  agriculture.  Priority  areas  in  agriculture  have\nbeen  identified  as  exports,  storage,  processing,  and  marketing.  In  addition,  the  State  Bank  of\nPakistan lowered the margin or collateral requirement in 2001 from 75 percent to 10 percent for\nflour mills and processors, and to 15 percent for growers.\n\nTo  safeguard  poor  consumers  of  foodgrains,  the  Government  is  developing  targeted,\n50.\ndirect  subsidy  programs  such  as  (i)  the  Khushhal  Pakistan  Program  (small  public  works)  for\nPRs30 billion budgeted for 2002, (ii) the Food Support Program for PRs2.5 billion in 2001 and\nPRs2.9 billion in 2002, and (iii) the Zakat Fund for PRs3.5 billion in 2001.\n\n51.\nWater  management  constitutes  a  significant  plank  of  the  Government\u2019s  strategy,\nheightened by the  drought  in many parts of the country. Desilting of canals, lining of irrigation\ncanals and watercourses, and renovation of watercourses are immediate priorities. For rainfed\nareas,  schemes  of  water  harvesting,  utilization  of  small  dams,  and  rejuvenation  of  farmers\u2019\nminidam schemes are already being implemented. For livestock and fisheries, the emphasis is\non  enhancing  quality  and  productivity  through  genetic  improvement,  ensuring  availability  of\nimproved feed and fodder, and comprehensive disease and pollution control. Privatization has\nbeen  identified  as  key  to  better  services.  Value  addition  in  agriculture  will  be  consciously\npromoted  through  proactive  measures  to  promote  rural  enterprises  through  advisory  services\nand access to finance.\n\nRegarding  economic  reforms,  under  the  Three-Year  Poverty  Reduction  Program,  2001-\n52.\n2004, a substantial increase in private sector development and participation is called for, including\nin the agriculture sector. The agriculture sector should be revitalized through increased emphasis\nand reforms in pricing policy, marketing, research, extension, water management, and drainage.\nThe  strategy  also  encourages  self-sufficiency  in  wheat,  sugar,  edible  oils,  and  pulses,  so  that\nimports of agricultural commodities can be eliminated. Regarding physical asset creation for the\npoor,  the  strategy  encourages  increased  allocation  of  available  state  land  to  the  landless  poor,\nand  the  promotion  of  microfinance  through  ongoing  programs  including  the  Microfinance  or\nKhushali  Bank20  and  support  to  NGOs  through  the  Pakistan  Poverty  Alleviation  Fund  (with\nassistance from the World Bank).\n\nE.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n53.\nTo assist the Government\u2019s reform efforts and to provide balance of payments support,\nIMF  approved  a  standby  arrangement  amounting  to  $596  million  in  November  2000.\nDiscussions  are  ongoing  for  a  comprehensive  multiyear  package  under  the  PRGF,  and  IMF\nboard consideration is scheduled for the third week of November 2001. ADB is coordinating with\nIMF  and  the  World  Bank  to  ensure  that  the  policy  reforms  supported  by  the  Program  are  an\nintegral component of the policy framework paper supported by the PRGF.\n\nFor several years, the Government has been undertaking policy reforms in the agriculture\n54.\nsector.  Many  of  the  significant  reforms  were  carried  out  under  ADB-funded  loans,  such  as  the\n\n                  \n\n20 Being assisted through Loans 1805-PAK(SF) and 1806-PAK(SF): Microfinance Sector Development Program, for\n\n$150 million, approved on 13 December 2000.\n\n\f17\n\nAgriculture Inputs Program21 and the Agriculture Program.22 The focus of these policy reforms has\nbeen to eliminate producer and consumption subsidies, progressively eliminate subsidized credit,\nstreamline  and  improve  the  collection  of  agricultural  taxation,  and  improve  crop  productivity\nthrough increased and timely availability of agricultural inputs, including water. Under the National\nDrainage (Sector) Project,23 ADB is supporting policy reforms in the drainage and irrigation sector.\nADB also assists the agriculture sector through area and rural development projects that include\ncomponents of agriculture, livestock, on-farm water management, rural electrification, rural water\nsupply, forestry, rural roads, and microfinance services using NGOs.24 Details are in Appendix 3.\n\n55.\nADB  provided  three  lines  of  credit  to  the  Agricultural  Development  Bank  of  Pakistan\n(ADBP)  to  enhance  the  supply  of  agricultural  credit.25  ADB  is  supporting  the  Microfinance  or\nKhushali Bank through the Microfinance Sector Development Program.26 Nearly 50 percent of the\ncredit facilities from the Khushali Bank will be for crop production, and the balance is likely to be\ndivided  among  livestock  and  farm-related  income-generating  activities.  The  program  is  also\nfinancing  an  external  audit  of  ADBP  aimed  at  reforming  ADBP.  In  the  other  sectors  related  to\nagriculture,  the  ADB-funded  Capital  Market  Development  Program,27  Trade  Export  Promotion\nand Industry Program,28 and Small and Medium Trade Enhancement Finance Project29 aim to\nassist  Pakistan  attain  higher  and  sustainable  private  sector  and  export-led  growth  through\ncomprehensive  policies  and  innovative  financing.  These  are  expected  to  facilitate  exports,\nincluding  agriculture  and  processed  goods,  that  comprise  the  major  exports  of  Pakistan,  and\nhelp integrate the country with the global economy.\n\n56.\nIn  addition  to  jointly  financing  the  National  Drainage  Project  and  the  Agricultural  Credit\nProject, the World Bank has provided assistance to ADBP since 1965 through six credit lines. The\nFinancial  Sector  Adjustment  Loan  for  $150  million,  approved  in  1989,  strengthened  the\ncompetitiveness of the banking system by recapitalizing and restructuring commercial banks. The\nPublic  Sector  Structural  Adjustment  Loan  of  $350  million  aims  to  improve  public  sector\ngovernance in the key areas of banking, tax administration, public utilities, and public expenditure.\nThe  Financial  Sector  Deepening  and  Intermediation  Project  is  providing  TA  for  institutional\nbuilding.  In  addition,  the  Banking  Sector  Adjustment  Loan  for  $250  million,  currently  being\ndiscussed  with  the  Government,  is  being  designed  to  support  ongoing  banking  reforms.  The\nWorld Bank is assisting the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund and its financial support to selected\nNGOs  through  the  Poverty  Alleviation  Fund  Project  for  $90  million.  The  On-farm  Water\nManagement Project of the World Bank has been approved for NWFP. Similar on-farm projects\nare under preparation for other provinces. Since 1978, the World Bank has funded six agricultural\nextension and research projects to sustain increases in agricultural production and strengthen the\n\n                  \n\n21 Loans 825-PAK(SF) and 826-PAK, for $150 million, approved on 18 December 1986.\n22 Loan 1062-PAK(SF), for $200 million, approved on 11 December 1990, and completed on 30 June 1994.\n23 Loan 1413-PAK(SF), for $140 million, approved on 21 November 1995.\n24  Including  Loan  1467-PAK(SF):  Bahawalpur  Rural  Development  Project,  for  $38  million,  approved  on  26\nSeptember 1996; Loan 1531-PAK(SF): Dera Ghazi Khan Rural Development Project, for $36 million, approved on\n4 September 1997; Loan 1672-PAK(SF): Malakand Rural Development Project, for $41 million, approved on 18\nMarch 1999; and Loan 1787-PAK(SF): NWFP Barani Area Development Project, for $52 million, approved on 28\nNovember 2000.\n\n25  Loan  617-PAK(SF):  Agricultural  Development  Bank  of  Pakistan  Project,  for  $50  million,  approved  on  23\nDecember 1982; Loans 810-PAK(SF) and 811-PAK: Second Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan Project,\nfor  $50  million,  approved  on  4  December  1986;  and    Loan  1044-PAK(SF): Agricultural Credit Project,  for  $150\nmillion, approved on  14 December 1990.\n\n26  Loan 1805-PAK(SF) and 1806-PAK(SF), for $150 million, approved on 13 December 2000.\n27 Loan 1576-PAK, for $250 million, approved on 6 November 1997.\n28  Loan 1680-PAK, for $300 million, approved on 31 March 1999.\n29  Loan 1796-PAK, for $150 million, approved on 7 December 2000.\n\n\f18\n\nT&V system, both nationwide and separately for Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan.\n\n57.\nFAO  has  been  mainly  providing  TA  in  the  development  of  agriculture  through  various\nsmall-scale  projects  to  improve  food  security,  including  improvements  to  farm  productivity  and\nfarm-level technological innovations. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation  (JBIC) has\nfunded the Punjab Province Agricultural Land Development Project (1978), and the Agriculture\nCredit  Program  (1992).  It  has  also  funded  four  projects  to  improve  irrigation  and  drainage\nfacilities,  including  the  National  Drainage  Program  (1995).  In  the  area  of  rural  development,\nJBIC\u2019s assistance includes rural electrification and rural roads. The United Nations Development\nProgramme,  the  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  and  the\nNetherlands Development Assistance have also financed area development projects supporting\nimproved farming practices, community development, and linking communities with sources of\nassistance.\n\nF.\n\nADB's Sector Strategy\n\nin \n\nfinance  and \n\n58.\nThe  country  operational  framework  for  Pakistan  links  poverty  reduction  to  social\nservices, agriculture and rural development, microfinance, development of social infrastructure,\nreforms \nindustry  sectors,  and  good  governance.  Consistent  with  the\nGovernment\u2019s  assessment,  ADB  considers  agriculture  as  the  most  important  sector  for\nemployment  generation.  Reforms  to  achieve  a  sustainable  production  and  marketing  system,\nmodernization and diversification to improve competitiveness and higher value addition, and a\nsupportive  policy  and  institutional  environment  for  private  investment  are  considered  key\nelements  to  realize  the  employment  generation  potential.  In  the  longer  term,  constraints  that\nneed  to  be  removed  include  imperfections  in  land  markets  and  land  distribution,  irrigation\ninefficiencies and increasing deterioration in land quality, an inadequate rural transport network,\ninefficiencies  in  public  sector  marketing  of  agricultural  inputs  and  outputs,  poor  quality  of\nresearch and extension, and restricted access to credit by small farmers.\n\nAgriculture is also important in the context of rural development and poverty reduction.\n59.\nCommunity-based  and  multisector  area  development  projects  focusing  on  farm  and  nonfarm\nincome-generating  opportunities  have  proven  be  successful  in  poverty  reduction.  A  number  of\nrural  development  programs  have  been  included  in  the  pipeline  to  leverage  the  reforms\nsupported  by  this  Program.  However,  success  also  depends  upon  effective  targeting  and\ncommunity-based participatory approaches.\n\n60.\nADB's  strategy  is  supportive  of  the  Government's  strategy  and  program  for  poverty\nreduction.  While  the  Government  has  initiated  a  number  of  positive  structural  reforms  since\n1999, Pakistan remains in crisis, with modest growth, high levels of debt, low foreign exchange\nreserves, a slowdown in exports, and severe pressures on the fiscal deficit. On a positive note\nthe  Government  has  been  spurred  to  consider  actions  and  embrace  agendas  that  only  a  few\nyears ago would not have been considered. To support pro-poor growth, ADB's focus will be on\n(i)  promoting  private  sector  development,  (ii)  encouraging  growth  in  employment-generating\nsectors such as agriculture and small and medium enterprises, and (iii) building infrastructure.\nFor social development the focus will be on (i) the development of human capital by increasing\nthe quality of primary education and basic reproductive health care, and (ii) gender development\nto  reduce  gaps  in  key  social  indicators  by  improving  female  access  to  education  and  health\ncare,  among  others.  For  good  governance  the  focus  will  be  on  (i)  support  for  fiscal\ndecentralization  and  management,  (ii)  reorientation  of  public  expenditures  to  the  poor,  (iii)\nreform of civil service, (iv) restructuring of loss-incurring SOEs, and (v) development of efficient\ncapital markets and good corporate governance.\n\n\f19\n\nG. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n61.\nThe  program  performance  audit  reports  (PPAR)  of  the  previous  Agriculture  Program\nidentified  important  lessons,  which  have  been  incorporated  in  the  design  of  the  proposed\nProgram.  These  lessons  may  be  grouped  as  (i)  program  prioritization  and  design,  (ii)\nimplementation and timing of politically sensitive reforms, and (iii) program linkages. In addition,\nlessons from other agencies' experiences in the provision of farmer support services have been\ndrawn upon extensively.\n\n1. \n\nProgram Prioritization and Design\n\n62.\nThe  PPAR  noted  that  the  first  Agriculture  Program  was  based  on  insufficient  sector\nanalysis, contained too many reform measures, and covered too many agriculture subsectors,\ntreating  each  too  broadly  to  bring  about  meaningful  changes.  Thus,  that  program  showed\ninadequate focus, a lack of specificity and prioritization in the reform measures, and a failure to\nset  clear  targets  and  performance  indicators.  In  response,  the  proposed  Program  has  been\nbased on detailed diagnostic analyses of critical sector constraints that began during the project\npreparatory  TA  and  continued  through  loan  processing.  Based  on  the  earlier  lessons,  the\nProgram has intentionally avoided areas of reform which, while important for long-run growth of\nthe sector, will be more effectively addressed over a longer timeframe and through alternative\nlending  modalities.30  The  design  of  the  Program  reflects  a  much  tighter  focus  on  the  critical\nareas  of  market  liberalization  for  key  crops  and  inputs,  reduction  of  budgetary  costs  for  state\ninterventions in these markets, and sharper targeting of support services for small farmers. The\nProgram also entails (i) a clear set of targets and performance indicators, including the size of\nthe  Strategic  Reserve  of  wheat;  (ii)  downsizing  of  existing  public  procurement  and  storage\nprograms;  (iii)  crop  prices,  production,  and  distribution;  and  (iv)  budgetary  allocations  for  staff\nretrenchment and small farmer and rural support programs. Close monitoring of the Program\u2019s\nimplementation  and  impacts  will  be  undertaken  jointly  by  the  Government,  ADB,  and\nindependent research agencies (paras. 93 and 98).\n\n2. \n\nImplementation and Timing of Politically Sensitive Reforms\n\n63.\nThe PPAR also recommended that a phased, step-by-step approach to program design\nand implementation is required in a traditional society like Pakistan, where there remain many\npolitically  well-connected  interest  groups  and  limited  governance  capacity.  The  proposed\nProgram  has  addressed  this  concern  in  four  ways.  First,  detailed  preparation  was  undertaken\nwith a comprehensive TA. During the TA and subsequent loan processing, extensive provincial\nconsultations  were  undertaken  with  government  and  nongovernment  stakeholders  in  order  to\nencourage  understanding  and  ownership  of  the  Program  (para.  88).  Second,  in  light  of  these\nconsultations,  a  five-year  period  of  implementation  is  planned,  with  three  loan  tranches  to  be\ncarefully sequenced in accordance with Federal and provincial government commitments to fully\nimplement the Program. About three years will be required for implementation of the core policy\nagenda,  and  an  additional  two  years  will  be  required  to  allow  flexibility  and  ensure  adequate\n\n                  \n\n30  Two  important  examples  include  agricultural  taxation  and  the  water  resource  subsector.  Enhanced  and  more\nequitable  taxation  of  agriculture  will  require  strong  political  commitment  and  considerable  strengthening  of  local\ninstitutional  capacity  for  tax  assessment  and  collection.  Agricultural  taxes  will  be  comprehensively  addressed\nunder  the  IMF's  proposed  multiyear  PRGF  (para.  53).  Similarly,  issues  related  to  integrated  water  resource\nmanagement  in  Pakistan  require  a  longer  term  approach,  combining  policy  dialogue  with  physical  investment,\ninstitutional  development,  and  capacity  building  for  more  sustainable  management  of  irrigation  and  drainage\ninfrastructure. These needs are being comprehensively addressed through a variety of ongoing projects financed\nby ADB and other agencies, such as the National Drainage (Sector) Project (para. 54).\n\n\f20\n\nmonitoring.  Third,  a  proposed  TA  loan  will  assist  the  Federal  and  local  stakeholders  to\neffectively implement, sequence, and monitor the reforms (paras. 99-104). Fourth, local political\ncommitment to the reforms has been strengthened by targeted allocation of counterpart funds to\nthe  provinces  for  the  purpose  of  absorbing  many  adjustment  costs  of  the  reform  program.  A\ncluster  loan  approach  was  considered  during  the  design  of  the  Program,  but  the  Government\nindicated a preference for retaining this package of reforms under a single program that would\nbe implemented in phases over a longer period than the previous agriculture program.\n\n3. \n\nProgram Linkages\n\n64.\nThe PPAR noted that program reforms should be prioritized based on sector needs and\nADB\u2019s strategic objectives, and that the linkage between reforms must be clearly identified. As\nnoted above, the Program has been designed based on detailed analysis of sector constraints,\npreparation of a detailed problem and objective tree analysis, identification of reform priorities,\nand  analysis  of  the  complementarities  with  ongoing  operations  in  the  sector  financed  by  ADB\nand  other  agencies.  The  proposed  Program  is  also  complementary  with  the  Government\u2019s\nThree-Year  Poverty  Reduction  Programme  2001-2004  (para.  15),  and  with  ADB\u2019s  broader\ncountry  operational  framework,  which  promotes  sustainable  growth  and  poverty  reduction\nthrough  improvement  of  economic  efficiency  and  export  competitiveness,  human  and  social\ndevelopment,  good  governance,  and  institutional  strengthening.  Linkage  between  reforms  has\nbeen carefully assessed to enhance their combined impacts (e.g., by linking the expected price\nand supply effects of market liberalization to the redesign of programs for small farmer research\nand extension).\n\n4. \n\nLessons from Other Aid Agencies' Experiences\n\n65.\nTo ensure that agricultural support services are more effective in meeting the needs of\nsmall  farmers,  the  lessons  learned  from  earlier  and  ongoing  externally  supported  programs\nhave  also  been  considered.  These  include  the  World  Bank-supported  T&V  Program  for\nextension,  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development-supported  farming  system\nresearch  approach,  and  ongoing  and  completed  externally  supported  activities  including  the\nFAO-funded Farmer Field Schools and Pilot Food Security Program. Most of these models and\napproaches are either ineffective or unsustainable. Some of their major shortcomings include (i)\nintensive capital and human resources at the top, (ii) weak governance structures, (iii) lack of a\ndemand-driven  approach,  (iv)  inadequate  training  and  incentives  for  middle  level  and  field\nextension staff, (v) weak interface between research and farmers, and (vi) lack of a replicable\nand  cost-effective  strategy.  The  TA  will  assist  the  Government  in  (i)  conducting  studies  and\naction  plans  for  institutional  reforms  to  improve  governance  and  autonomy  for  the  research\nsystem,  accountability \nto  end-users'  needs,  and\nthe  stakeholders,  responsiveness \naccessibility  to  small  and  poor  farmers;  and  (ii)  assessing  the  feasibility  of  integrating\nagricultural  research,  education,  and  extension  such  that  it  is  cost  effective,  responsive  to\nimproving productivity and efficiency, and financially sustainable.\n\nto \n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nV.\n\nTHE PROGRAM\n\n66.\nSustainable  growth  of  the  agriculture  sector  is  a  prerequisite  for  economic  growth  and\npoverty  reduction  in  Pakistan.  The  agriculture  sector  employs  about  50  percent  of  the  labor\nforce and generates 70 percent of export revenues. Two thirds of the population and about 75\npercent of the poor live in rural areas. Although agricultural income accounts for just half of the\ntotal rural income, dependence of the poor on agriculture is much greater because of the strong\nlinkages between the farm and nonfarm sectors. The increase in the number of poor during the\n\n\f21\n\nlast  decade  is  partly  a  result  of  declining  productivity,  decreasing  rural  employment,  and\nstagnating household income.\n\n67.\nPakistan  has  made  progress  in  liberalizing  agricultural  markets  and  prices  in  recent\nyears.  However,  further  progress  is  still  needed  to  enhance  the  real  growth  of  the  agriculture\nsector as the productivity of most crops is low. This has affected both the upstream linkages for\nfarm  inputs,  such  as  seeds,  fertilizers,  and  machinery,  and  the  downstream  linkages  to  agro-\nprocessing  and  related  industries.  Despite  the  moves  towards  market  liberalization  during  the\n1990s,  direct  intervention  by  the  Government  in  agricultural  markets  remains  excessive.  This\nhas  adversely  affected  sustainable  increases  in  production  and  crowded  out  private  sector\ninvolvement.  Government  pricing  and  marketing  interventions  on  the  one  hand  and  private\nsector cartels and market failures on the other hand have led to low producer prices, low farm\nprofitability,  and  dampened  productivity  growth.  Government  subsidies  are  expensive  to\nmaintain  and  do  not  typically  benefit  the  target  beneficiaries,  the  small  and  marginal  farmers.\nThe research and extension systems and institutions are outdated and weak. These distortions\ninfluence the productivity and profitability of the major agricultural commodities, including wheat,\ncotton, rice, and sugar; adversely impact on the well-being of the vast majority of small farmers\nand the rural poor; and restrain overall economic growth.\n\n68.\nPakistan is in the midst of a structural adjustment program, with poverty reduction as the\nkey  goal  and  revitalization  of  the  agriculture  sector  as  a  key  component  in  the  export-led\nstrategy.  The  Government  intends  to  redefine  its  role  in  the  agriculture  sector  to  ensure  the\nsmooth functioning of markets, promote private sector activities, and adjust public expenditures\nin agriculture more on public goods and market failures and less on agricultural production and\nmarketing  activities.  Consistent  with  the  overall  goals  of  adjustment,  these  reforms  aim  to\nexpand  the  role  of  the  private  sector  through  deregulation,  liberalization,  and  privatization,\naffecting  many  public  input  supply  and  output  marketing  enterprises  that  now  operate  in  the\nagriculture sector. The envisaged adjustment will phase out Government control of activities in\nagricultural production and marketing that the private sector is better equipped to handle. The\nagricultural  subsidy  regime  that  has  compounded  fiscal  difficulties  and  skewed  the  benefits  of\ngrowth  and  investment  away  from  the  needy  will  be  dismantled  to  correspondingly  increase\nsocial sector investments.\n\nThe  Government\u2019s  acknowledgement  of  the  seriousness  with  which  the  sector\u2019s\n69.\nstructural issues need to be addressed is reflected in the intense dialogue with IMF, the World\nBank,  and  ADB;  public  participation;  and  involvement  of  other  external  agencies  in  designing\nthe  Program  to  set  the  stage  for  sustainable  growth  in  the  long  run.  The  Government  has\ndemonstrated  its  firm  commitment  to  the  Program  by  initiating  action  in  several  key  areas\nincluding (i) reducing the public sector procurement and marketing of wheat, (ii) expanding the\nrole of the private sector in wheat and seeds, (iii) phasing out the costly wheat subsidy program,\n(iv)  ensuring  free  movement  of  wheat  and  other  commodities,  (v)  allowing  unrestricted  import\nand export of major commodities, and (vi) allowing free access to breeder seed from research\ninstitutions.\n\n70.\nTo  be  firmly  placed  on  a  sustainable  growth  path  in  order  to  reduce  poverty,  Pakistan\nrequires  wide  and  deep  reforms  in  all  the  major  economic  sectors.  The  major  challenge,\nhowever,  is  to  implement  the  reforms  in  major  economic  sectors  and  reduce  fiscal  deficits.\nReforms in the agriculture sector are critically needed to ensure the success of all reforms, as\nwell  as  to  enhance  the  sector's  ability  to  provide  sustainable  means  of  livelihood  to\napproximately  half  of  the  country\u2019s  labor  force.  The  costs  of  implementing  these  reforms,\nhowever,  are  substantial  and  so  would  be  the  benefits  when  the  reforms  are  effectively\nimplemented.  With  the  limited  fiscal  maneuverability  of  the  Government,  it  will  be  difficult  to\n\n\f22\n\nmeet  the  short-term  adjustment  costs  (paras.  91  and  92)  of  the  reform  agenda  without\nsignificant  external  assistance.  The  Government  has,  therefore,  requested  ADB  support  to\nundertake  the  reforms,  which  are  well  anchored  in  and  integral  to  the  ongoing  structural\nchanges  in  the  macroeconomy,  and  to  implement  the  Program.  The  implementation  period  is\nfive years, given the Government's commitment to these difficult reforms and increased private\nsector involvement, coupled with the need to replace ineffective wheat subsidies to consumers\nwith  better  and  targeted  programs  for  small  farmers  and  the  poor.  The  Development  Policy\nLetter  describing  the  Government\u2019s  reform  measures  is  in  Appendix  4  along  with  the  detailed\npolicy matrix.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n71.\nThe Program has been designed to assist the Government in addressing key constraints\nin  the  agriculture  sector  regarding  productivity  and  profitability  with  an  emphasis  on  small  and\nmarginal  farmers.  As  a  result  of  increased  productivity  and  profitability,  it  is  expected  that  the\nProgram  will  increase  agricultural  growth  and  rural  employment  and  reduce  rural  poverty.\nBeneficiaries  will  be  provided  with  opportunities  to  increase  their  crop  yields,  productivity,\nincomes,  and  employment  and  improve  their  quality  of  life  through  the  promotion  of  efficient\ncommodity markets and support services. A Program Framework is in Appendix 1, based on a\ndetailed problem and cause-effect analysis of the sector.\n\nThe  primary  objective  of  the  Program  will  be  to  improve  agricultural  productivity  and\n72.\nprofitability. The Program includes specific reform measures to (i) promote efficient markets for\nthe  major  commodities,  including  wheat,  cotton,  rice,  and  sugarcane,  in  order  to  promote\nmarket-based  incentives  for  farms,  especially  smallholders;  (ii)  liberalize  markets  for  fertilizer\nand seed; and (iii) strengthen support services in small farmer extension and training, research,\nand regulation to improve quality control. These reforms will include (i) increased private sector\ninvolvement in the wheat market, with a planned phase-out of support prices and subsidies, and\nremoval of restrictions on internal movement, imports, and exports; (ii) increased private sector\ncompetition  in  cotton  and  rice  marketing  and  export  to  overcome  market  imperfections;  (iii)\nincreased  competition  in  sugar  production  and  marketing  with  imports;  (iv)  increased  private\nsector  competition  in  fertilizer  imports;  (v)  removal  of  the  public  sector  monopoly  in  access  to\nbreeder  seeds  and  increased  private  sector  participation;  (vi)  rationalization,  increased\nautonomy,  and  financial  self-reliance  of  research  institutions;  and  (vii)  increased  small  farmer\nfocus of extension services. Several SOEs will be restructured and/or closed down and divested\nas a result of the rationalization and private-sector orientation of the Program.\n\nC.\n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\n1. \n\nImprove Efficiency of Commodity Markets\n\na. \n\nRemove Market Restrictions\n\n73.\nUnder  the  proposed  reforms,  all  restrictions  on  free  movement  of  wheat  and  other\nagricultural  commodities  will  be  removed.  As  first  tranche  conditions,  MINFAL,  the  Ministry  of\nCommerce  (MOC),  and  the  provincial  governments  will  (i)  permanently  remove  all  restrictions,\nexcept those related to antismuggling activities along the borders,31 on the internal movement of\nwheat and other agricultural commodities; (ii) permit free movement throughout each province of\n\n                  \n\n31  To  minimize  the  smuggling  of  agricultural  commodities  to  and  from  Afghanistan,  Pakistan  closely  monitors  the\n\nmovement of goods within 20 miles of the border.\n\n\f23\n\nseed certified for a particular ecological zone by the provincial governments' seed councils; and\n(iii)  ensure  that  no  new  public  sector  seed  corporation  will  be  established  in  the  country.  At\npresent, there is a restriction on the free movement of cotton seed in order to safeguard against\nthe spread of diseases that could devastate the crop. Also as first tranche conditions, MOC will\nissue  a  policy  announcement  that  (i)  allows  unrestricted  private  sector  (which  includes  both\ndomestic and international firms) imports and exports, subject to tariffs and antidumping rules;\nand  (ii)  ensures  that  there  are  no  nontariff  barriers  to  private  sector  imports  and  exports  of\nwheat, sugar, fertilizer, seed, cotton, and rice.\n\n74.\nA major reform program is under way in sugar marketing and processing. Farmers in the\nsugar mill zones are no longer required to sell sugarcane to the mills in their area. Farmers are\nalso not restricted from producing brown sugar and molasses. The tariff for imported sugar was\nreduced on 18 June 2001 from 15 percent to 10 percent. Under the Program, imports of sugar by\nthe  private  sector  will  be  encouraged.  As  a  first  tranche  condition,  the  Government  will  allow\nunrestricted  imports  of  sugar.  Also,  the  Government  will  remove  all  restrictions  on  the\nproduction, marketing, and export of brown sugar and molasses. As a second tranche condition,\nMINFAL and MOC will issue a policy announcement for (i) the permanent removal of the zoning\nof sugarcane areas and the forced sale to the nearest sugar mill, and (ii) allowing sugar mills to\nmerge  and  relocate.  Regulations  of  unfair  and  monopsonistic  practices  of  sugar  millers  and\nimporters will be improved and enforced by the Government. These measures will improve the\nefficiency of the sugar mills and ensure consumers with plentiful sugar at competitive prices. It is\nexpected  that  domestic  production  of  sugar  will  decline  over  time,  and  farmers  in  the  less\ncompetitive production and processing regions will replace sugarcane with more profitable crops\nsuch as wheat, cotton, and rice, and with horticulture.\n\n75.\nA  free  trade  policy  in  cotton  was  introduced  in  FY1996  that  removed  import  and  export\nduties.  There  is  a  need  for  more  competition  in  exports,  imports,  ginning,  and  processing.  As  a\nsecond  tranche  condition,  MOC  will  submit  draft  legislation  to  the  competent  authorities\nconcerning  the  grading  and  standardization  of  cotton.  This  legislation  and  implementing\nregulations will be adopted as a third tranche condition. This is expected to improve the quality\nand  international  competitiveness  of  Pakistan\u2019s  cotton  exports.    Also,  as  a  second  tranche\ncondition, MINFAL and the provincial governments will permit unrestricted access to and sale of\nbreeder  seed  from  research  institutes  and  PSC  for  the  production  of  certified  seed  to  private\nseed companies.\n\nb. \n\nImprove Public Management of Strategic Reserves of Wheat\n\nThe objectives of maintaining a strategic reserve of wheat are to ensure price stability to\n76.\nboth  producers  and  consumers  and  to  provide  food  security  in  the  event  of  shortages  or\nemergency needs. The strategic reserve or buffer stock will provide for domestic consumption\nand  help  offset  any  shortages  in  the  market.  The  public  food  system  will  procure  and  sell  a\ndeclining  amount  until  reaching  a  minimum  of  1.0  million  tons32  or  about  12.5  percent  of  the\nmarketed  surplus,  and  the  private  sector  will  market  the  balance  of  wheat.  As  a  first  tranche\ncondition,  MINFAL  and  MOC  will  issue  policy  announcements  that  (i)  the  Government  will\nprocure  and  manage  a  minimum  of  1.0  million  tons  of  wheat  strategic  reserve  (the  actual\nrequirements of the strategic reserve will be determined by the Government in March and April\nof each year); (ii) PASSCO and the provincial food departments will only manage the strategic\nreserve of wheat and on a commercial and cost-effective basis; and (iii) the directorates of food\n\n32  This level may be adjusted below 1.0 million tons, as agreed between ADB and the Government.\n\n                  \n\n\f24\n\nin the provincial food departments of Sindh, NWFP, and Balochistan will be closed over a five-\nyear period.33 PASSCO will mainly procure, store, and distribute strategic reserves of wheat, but\nother agriculture commodities may be marketed on a commercial and case-by-case basis, and\nonly when special circumstances warrant. All other agricultural commodities and the remaining\nquantities of wheat will be freely traded in open domestic markets. PASSCO will be allowed to\nexport  wheat  with  TCP.  The  provincial  governments  will  have  representation  on  the  board  of\nPASSCO. These measures and the permanent removal of restrictions on the internal movement\nof  wheat  will  ensure  a  higher  price  to  the  farmer  and  improved  availability  throughout  the\ncountry.\n\n77.\nFor wheat and the other marketing components (including cotton, rice, sugar, fertilizer, and\nseeds), TA will be provided under the Program to assist the Government in (i) implementing the\npolicy  reforms,  (ii)  establishing  a  market-based  information  system,  (iii)  instituting  systems  of\ninternationally  accepted  standards  and  grades  for  the  exported  commodities,  (iv)  managing  the\nstrategic reserve and reducing costs, and (v) providing capacity building and training to promote\nmarket reforms and quality standards for exports. The TA will also assist the private sector with (i)\nexports and market performance, (ii) quality control, (iii) storage, and (iv) a possible revival of the\nwheat and cotton futures markets. Details are provided in Chapter VII.\n\nc. \n\nPhase Out Commodity Price Supports and Subsidies\n\nAPCOM under MINFAL will continue to recommend support prices to the Government.\n78.\nRegarding  support  prices  for  wheat,  and  as  a  first  tranche  condition,  MINFAL  and  MOC  will\nissue  a  policy  announcement  that  (i)  the  issue  price  for  sale  of  wheat  to  flour  mills  will  not  be\nuniform throughout the year, but will be allowed to increase seasonally to reflect storage costs;\nand  (ii)  the  issue  price  will  be  phased  out  and  replaced  by  a  sales  price  that  reflects  the\nprocurement  price  plus  the  full  costs  of  storage,  distribution,  and  management.  Regarding\nsubsidies on wheat, MINFAL and MOC will issue a policy announcement that the basis for the\nprocurement price will be the international reference price (export or import parity price),34 with\nmarginal  adjustments  allowed  to  reflect  changes  in  the  cost  of  production.  As  third  tranche\nconditions,  the  Government  will  eliminate  (i)  the  consumer  subsidy  for  wheat  by  moving  to  a\nmarket-based  sales  price;  and  (ii)  the  producer  subsidy  for  wheat  by  moving  from  a  support\nprice  to  a  market-based  procurement  price  (export  or  import  parity  price),  unless  otherwise\nagreed upon between ADB and the Government, except for the losses that may accrue due to\nthe minimum strategic reserve for wheat. These price measures will enable a gradual phasing\nout  of  the  wheat  consumer  and  producer  subsidies,  while  also  protecting  wheat  producers  to\nsome extent from rapid and sustained price declines in the competitive market.\n\n                  \n\n33  The provincial food departments perform two major functions: (i) procurement, storage, and sale (at prices fixed\nby  the  Federal  Government)  of  wheat  and  limited  other  commodities  through  the  directorates  of  food  (which\ncontain more than 90 percent of their total staff and assets); and (ii) regulatory services including (a) food quality\ninspection through food inspectors, and (b) price determination of essential commodities through food controllers.\nUnder  the  Program,  the  provincial  food  departments  will  be  restructured,  involving  reorganization  and  possible\ndownsizing.  The  directorates  of  food  in  three  of  the  food  departments  (Sindh,  NWFP,  and  Balochistan)  will  be\nrestructured  for  eventual  closure  and  divestiture  over  a  five-year  period,  whereas  their  regulatory  functions  will\ncontinue operations. PASSCO and the Punjab Food Department will be restructured and will continue operation\nand management of the strategic reserve. The Punjab Food Department is needed because of the major role that\nwheat plays in the Punjab economy.\n\n34  This price will then be adjusted for wholesale market-to-port marketing margins, as has traditionally been done for\n\ncotton.\n\n\f25\n\nA first tranche policy announcement will also confirm that (i) for cotton, the Government\n79.\nwill  continue  to  use  the  export  parity  price  as  the  basis  for  the  procurement  price;  (ii)  for\nsugarcane, the Government will only announce an indicative price to be used for procurement\nby the private sugar mills, and the Government will not procure sugarcane; (iii) for rice and all\nother  agricultural  commodities,  public  procurement  will  be  at  market  prices;  and  (iv)  no  new\nsubsidies will be introduced on wheat imports, public seed production and marketing, or fertilizer\nimport and marketing. The Government and the provincial governments will provide incentives\nto promote private sector and joint or cooperative farmer storage of the major commodities. As a\nsecond  tranche  condition,  the  Government  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a  plan  to  replace\nuntargeted wheat subsidies with targeted programs for small farmers (the small farmers plan).\nAs  a  third  tranche  condition,  the  Government  will  commence  implementation  of  the  approved\nsmall farmers plan.\n\nd. \n\nAccelerate Divestiture and Restructuring of SOEs\n\n80.\nThe  Program  will  assist  the  federal  and  provincial  governments  in  closing  and  divesting\nseveral SOEs in the agriculture sector that are no longer needed. Some SOEs will remain but will\nundergo  considerable  restructuring  in  order  to  perform  more  effectively  in  the  market.  As  first\ntranche conditions, SASO and ADA will be closed, and the process of divestiture will be started\nby the provincial governments of Sindh and NWFP. As stated above, no new public sector seed\ncorporation  will  be  established  in  the  country.  Private  seed  companies  will  continue  to  certify\ntheir seed as required by the Federal Seed Certification and Registration Department.\n\n81.\nThe  Cotton  Export  Corporation  and  the  Rice  Export  Corporation  of  Pakistan  have\nalready been closed, and in January 2001 they were merged with TCP. Also, as a first tranche\ncondition,  MOC  will  end  all  budgetary  support,  subsidies,  and  preferential  credit  at  subsidized\ninterest rates for TCP, and ensure that TCP competes on equal terms with private companies.\nSupport prices announced by APCOM will act only as market reference prices and not as public\nprocurement prices. If TCP procures wheat, cotton, and rice, it will be primarily for export and at\nopen  market  or  export  parity  prices.  These  measures  will  expand  exports  at  international\nstandards and help ensure higher prices to farmers. If TCP procures wheat, cotton, and rice, it\nwill be at open market or international preference prices.\n\nAs a second tranche condition, MINFAL and the provincial governments will submit plans\n82.\nto ADB to reorganize and downsize PASSCO and the provincial food departments to operate on\nmarket-oriented  lines  and  compete  on  equal  terms  with  the  private  sector  (the  PASSCO  and\nProvincial  Food  Department  Restructuring  Plans),  and  begin  implementation  (including\nupgrading  and  leasing  storage  facilities).  Also  as  second  tranche  conditions,  (i)  MINFAL  will\nclose FID, responsible in the past for fertilizer imports, and the Directorate of Food, responsible\nfor  wheat  imports,  and  begin  the  process  of  divestiture;  and  (ii)  the  Sindh  Government  will\nannounce a plan and a timetable to close SSC. Divestiture will entail leasing or selling assets to\nthe  private  sector  (i.e.,  sale  of  stocks  and  lease  of  storage  facilities),  settlement  of  all\noutstanding  claims  and  debt,  and  assigning  staff  to  the  provincial  surplus  pool.35  It  has  been\nagreed that the proceeds of the Loan under the Program will be made available by the Federal\nGovernment to the provinces on the same terms and conditions to assist in closing these and\nother SOEs under the Program. Also as a second tranche condition, the Government and the\n\n                  \n\n35  In lieu of assigning staff to the surplus pool, the provinces may elect to offer staff a voluntary retirement scheme,\ndepending  on  the  availability  of  funds  and  a  firm  policy  on  retrenchment.  A  proposal  being  considered  at  the\nFederal  level  is  a  payment  of  3-5  years  of  salary  and  benefits  on  a  monthly  basis,  instead  of  a  lump  sum,  with\npermission granted to the staff to work in the private sector during the period of monthly payments.\n\n\f26\n\nprovincial  governments  will  issue  policy  announcements  that  all  staff  affected  under  this\nProgram (both public servants and public corporation staff) will either be placed in the surplus\npool  or  provided  with  a  severance  package  consistent  with  the  Government's  guidelines.  As\nanother  second  tranche  condition,  MOC  will  ensure  that  TCP  is  operating  on  a  commercial\nbasis without any budgetary support, subsidies, or exclusive preferential credit in wheat, cotton,\nand rice exports. These measures will increase the market share of the private sector in wheat,\ncotton, and rice marketing.\n\nAs third tranche conditions, the Government will cause the Provincial governments to (i)\n83.\ncomplete  the  implementation  of  the  agreed  upon  PASSCO  and  provincial  food  department\nreorganization  plans, \nthe\nGovernment's  guidelines;  (ii)  close  the  provincial  food  departments  of  Sindh,  NWFP,  and\nBalochistan  and  SSC,  and  begin  the  process  of  divesting  them;  and  (iii)  end  all  budgetary\nsupport,  subsidies,  and  preferential  credit  for  PASSCO,  except  for  the  costs  of  managing  the\nminimum wheat strategic reserve.\n\nincluding  provision  of  severance  packages  consistent  with \n\n2. \n\nStrengthen Support Services\n\na. \n\nAccelerate the Provision of Agricultural Support Services\n\n84.\nAs a first tranche condition, MOF and MINFAL will issue a statement that the proceeds of\nthe Loan under this Program will be made available for onlending to the provincial governments\non the same terms and conditions as those of the Program Loan, with the Federal Government\nbearing  the  entire  foreign  exchange  risk,  for  the  purpose  of  upgrading  storage  facilities  and\nfinancing any staff severance programs, and for programs focusing on small farmers, including\nresearch  and  extension  programs.  As  second  tranche  conditions  (i)  MOC  and  the  provincial\ngovernments  will  make  a  determination  (the  financing  determination)  regarding  financing,\nthrough  the  provincial  trust  funds,  joint  NGO  activities,  and  extension  agent  programs  with  a\nfocus on small farmers; and (ii) the Sindh Government will finance, through the provincial trust\nfunds,  a  Sindh  Rural  Support  Program,  similar  to  those  programs  in  the  other  provinces.\nProvincial  governments  will  also  promote  group-based  small  farmer  storage  and  marketing\nefforts in order to reduce the dependence on middlemen during the harvest and to obtain higher\nprices. This will increase the scope for private sector competition in agricultural markets. As a\nthird  tranche  condition,  the  provincial  governments  will  finance  new  initiatives  agricultural\nresearch,  extension,  and  higher  education  by  using  some  of  the  local  currency  funds  in  the\nprovincial  trust  funds.  These  funds  are  additional  to  annual  budgetary  funds  received  by  the\nprovinces.\n\nb.\n\nAccelerate the Strengthening and Coordination of Agricultural\nSupport Services\n\nMajor  reforms  are  planned  in  agricultural  research.  As  a  second  tranche  condition,\n85.\nresearch  institutes  will  be  allowed  to  sell  breeder  seed  to  private  companies.  In  addition  to\nfinancing  innovate  extension  and  small  farmer  training  activities,  another  potential  use  of  the\nProgram Loan proceeds is innovative research programs to support small farmer development.\nAlso  as  second  tranche  conditions  (i)  the  provincial  governments  will  study  the  feasibility  and\nprepare plans (the research institutes plans) to make provincial research institutes autonomous\nand  allow  them  to  retain  the  royalties  earned  from  the  sale  of  seed;  (ii)  MINFAL  and  the\nprovincial  governments  will  study  the  feasibility  of  reorganizing  and  strengthening  the  delivery\nand  coordination  of  agricultural  research,  extension,  and  higher  education  services  (the\nagricultural support service plans); and (iii) MINFAL will prepare and submit for cabinet approval\na plan to substantially reorganize and right-size PARC and NARC (the research councils plan)\n\n\f27\n\nto  focus  on  research  coordination  with  the  provinces  and  special  national  topics  dealing  with\nupstream research such as biotechnology. As third tranche conditions, the Government and the\nprovincial  governments  will,  subject  to  the  results  of  the  relevant  study  and  their  joint\nagreement,  commence  implementation  of  (i)  the  research  institute  plans,  (ii)  the  agricultural\nsupport service plans, and (iii) the research councils plan.\n\nc. \n\nQuality Control and Regulation Measures\n\n86.\nAs first tranche conditions, MINFAL will prepare (i) an ordinance on fertilizer regulation,\nand (ii) draft legislation for the regulation and control of agricultural chemicals (including revision\nof the Environmental Protection Act of 1997) to establish legal responsibilities for the handling,\ntransport, storage, and disposal of agricultural chemicals for Government and ADB review. As\nsecond tranche conditions, the Government and the provincial governments will ensure that (i)\nsuppliers of imported fertilizer certify the nutrient contents at the point of origin, and (ii) private\nthird-party  laboratories,  certified  by  the  Government,  are  allowed  to  certify  quality  at  the  retail\nlevel  for  fertilizer  and  seed,  subject  to  existing  Government  regulations.  Also,  MINFAL  will\nsubmit (i) the ordinance on fertilizer regulation for promulgation to the cabinet, and (ii) the draft\nlegislation on agricultural chemical regulation to the national assembly.\n\nD.\n\nSocial and Environmental Issues\n\nThe Program will address policy issues that are presently impeding the performance of\n87.\nthe agriculture sector and have significant socioeconomic, poverty-related, and environmental-\nadverse  impacts.  These  issues  include  (i)  inadequate  role  of  the  private  sector  in  commodity\ntrade,  overshadowed  by  an  inefficient  and  overstaffed  public  sector,  and  in  the  procurement,\nmarketing, and distribution of agricultural inputs and food grains; (ii) inadequate and ineffective\nregulatory mechanisms, and ill-defined standards and specifications for inputs and farm produce\nto  ensure  quality;  (iii)  ineffective  research  and  extension  services  that  are  top  down  and\ninaccessible  to  small  and  poor  farmers;  (iv)  unsatisfactory  performance,  overstaffing,  and\noverlapping  functions  and  mandates  of  Federal  level  research  and  marketing  institutions;  (v)\ninadequate  funding  to  target  the  poor  and  marginalized  households;  and  (vi)  absence  of\nmonitoring  mechanisms  and  plans  to  mitigate  possible  adverse  socioeconomic,  physical,  and\nbiological  impacts  from  increased  use  of  agrochemicals  and  other  increased  agroprocessing\nactivities.\n\n88.\nTo  encourage  the  role  of  the  private  sector,  the  inefficient  public  sector  trading  and\nmarketing  organizations  will  be  divested,  and,  where  necessary,  their  roles  and  budgetary\nsupport will be reduced. Moreover, credit facilities will be allocated to the private sector to invest\nin  expanding  marketing  linkages.  Similarly,  monitoring  mechanisms  to  regulate  major  markets\nand  prices  will  be  instituted  to  ensure  the  quality  of  inputs  and  outputs,  and  to  mitigate  any\nadverse environmental impacts. To ensure improved and effective support services, institutional\nrestructuring  will be carried out to make research and extension agencies demand driven and\ncost  effective.  Similarly,  research  institutions  will  be  restructured  to  avoid  any  overlapping\nfunctions  and  wasteful  expenditure.  Support  will  be  provided  to  enhance  the  implementation\ncapacity of the institutions to provide support for marginalized and poor consumers. The major\nimpacts  of  the  Program  are  provided  in  Chapter  VIII.  Details  of  the  major  impacts  and  public\nconsultations are in Appendix 5.\n\n\f28\n\nVI.\n\nTHE PROPOSED LOANS\n\nA.\n\nAmount of Loans and Source of Funds\n\n89.\nThree  loans  totaling  $350  million  equivalent  are  required:  (i)  a  loan  in  an  amount  of\nSDR96,238,000  ($123  million  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources36  to  the  Islamic\nRepublic of Pakistan, with a term of 24 years maturity, including a grace period of 8 years, with an\ninterest rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum during\nthe amortization period; (ii) a loan in an amount of Y27,643,500,000 ($225 million equivalent) from\nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  with  a  term  of  15  years\nmaturity,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  and  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s  London interbank offered rate-based loan facility; and (iii) a TA loan in an amount of\nSDR1,565,000  ($2  million  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Fund  resources  (footnote  36)  to  the\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan, with a term of 32 years maturity, including a grace period of 8 years,\nwith an interest rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum\nduring the amortization period.\n\nUse of low-cost funds from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources is justified in support of policy\n90.\nreforms  that  address  complex  and  long-standing  issues  and  socially  significant  measures  to  (i)\nenhance benefits to small and marginal farmers and the rural poor; (ii) free government resources\ncurrently used in misdirected and nontargeted subsidies, and (iii) improve the terms of trade for\nagriculture  on  which  the  livelihood  of  the  majority  of  the  households,  especially  the  poor,\ndepend. In addition, the adjustment costs to implement the program are substantial.\n\n91.\nAn  estimated  net  adjustment  cost  of  about  $500  million  is  required  to  catalyze  the\nchanges to enhance productivity and profitability in the agriculture sector through the proposed\nreform  measures.  About  80  percent  of  the  expected  savings  of  $180  million  from  phasing  out\nuntargeted subsidies and reducing the wheat stock to the level of the wheat strategic reserve is\nmeant  for  targeted  small  farmer  programs  including  contingency  for  safety  nets  for  poor\nhouseholds against fluctuations in the wheat price. As a result, a net savings of $30 million is\nexpected.  Restructuring  and  divestiture  of  SOEs,  including  provision  for  staff  affected  by\nreforms and upgrading storage facilities for leasing or sale, are likely to cost about $340 million\nover  the  five-year  program  period.  An  adjustment  cost  of  about  $180  million  is  expected  for\nreorienting the agricultural extension, research, and education services to address small farmer\nneeds.  These  include  community-based  services,  agricultural  productivity  enhancement\nprograms,  and  private-public  associations  in  the  delivery  of  agricultural  services.  The  cost  for\nimproving quality control and regulation measures is estimated at $10 million.\n\n92.\nThe  proposed  measures  have  been  phased  to  factor  in  resource  availability  during\nimplementation.  The  reforms  will  be  facilitated  by  measures  that  generate  savings,  such  as\nremoval of subsides. The budgetary implication of the proposed reform measures is expected to\nbe positive, and nonquantifiable benefits and savings are expected to be substantial. These would\naccrue through (i) lower expenses on controlling the movement, marketing, import, and export of\nagricultural  commodities;  (ii)  efficiency  gains  in  sugar  production,  increased  price  for  cotton,\nincreased producer and private sector benefits, and increased tax revenues to the Government;\n(iii)  higher  efficiency  and  market  orientation  of  restructured  SOEs  that  will  reduce  the  need  for\nbudgetary support; and (iv) divestiture that will lead to recurring savings and reduced personnel\nand  administration  costs.  The  rental  and  sale  of  upgraded  storage  facilities  could  potentially\ngenerate significant revenues.\n                  \n\n36  Subject to the availability of Asian Development Fund resources.\n\n\f29\n\nB.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n93.\nMOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  will  (i)  coordinate  with  MINFAL,  MOC,  and  the\nprovincial  governments  on  the  policy  reforms;  (ii)  oversee  compliance  of  tranche  conditions;  (iii)\nadminister the use of loan proceeds; and (iv) request ADB for tranche releases. MINFAL will be\nresponsible  for  day-to-day  implementation,  including  monitoring  the  implementation  of  the\nProgram and use of counterpart funds and evaluating the impact of the reforms on stakeholders.\nTo  facilitate  implementation,  MINFAL  will  establish,  prior  to  loan  negotiations  (i)  a  steering\ncommittee composed of senior staff from MINFAL, MOC, MOF, and the provincial planning and\ndevelopment  departments  (to  meet  at  least  quarterly);  and  (ii)  a  program  implementation  unit\n(PIU)  in  Islamabad,  under  the  direction  of  the  secretary,  MINFAL.  The  steering  committee  will\nensure that the reforms are undertaken in line with the agreed upon timetable. The PIU will have\nat least three full-time staff to oversee the progress and issues relating to policy implementation.\nIn addition, the PIU will collect baseline data and continually assess program impact. Appendix 6\npresents  (i)  policy  compliance  measures  for  tranche  releases  and  (ii)  program  monitoring\nindicators.\n\nC.\n\nProcurement and Disbursement\n\n94.\nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items produced\nand procured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items (Appendix 7). The Government\nwill  certify  that  (i)  if  the  loan  proceeds  will  finance  goods  already  imported,  the  value  of  eligible\nimports in the period concerned will exceed the amount of the requested withdrawal; or (ii) if the\nloan  proceeds  finance  items  to  be  imported,  the  value  of  eligible  imports  in  the  immediately\npreceding one-year period will be equal to or greater than the amount of the requested withdrawal\nplus  all  other  amounts  expected  to  be  withdrawn  during  the  succeeding  one-year  period.  All\nprocurement will be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. An audit of the use of\nthe loan proceeds will be undertaken only upon ADB\u2019s request, provided that ADB retains the right\nto (i) audit any account, and (ii) verify the validity of the certification issued by the Government for\neach  withdrawal  application.  Prior  to  withdrawal,  the  Government  will  open  an  account  with  the\nState Bank of Pakistan in which all withdrawals will be deposited. The account will be managed,\noperated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.\n\nD.\n\nUse of Loan Proceeds\n\n95.\nThe  use  of  the  local  currency  proceeds  of  the  loan  (counterpart  funds)  needs  to  be\nconsistent  with  the  overall  fiscal  framework  defined  in  the  Government's  agreement  with  IMF.\nSubject to this, local currency proceeds of the loan will be used by the Government to support\nthe reforms to be initiated or implemented under the Program in particular, and to redirect the\nsavings from subsidies towards social sector expenditures, which is a government commitment\nto  IMF.  Considering  that  agriculture  is  largely  a  provincial  matter  and  the  cost  of  the  reform\nmeasures  will  have  to  be  borne  by  the  provinces,  the  Federal  Government  has  agreed  to\nprovide part of the counterpart funds for the provinces on the same terms and conditions as the\nADB loans, with the Federal Government bearing the entire foreign exchange risk.\n\nAllocation  of  part  of  the  loan  proceeds  to  the  provinces  is  the  first  such  arrangement\n96.\nunder  a  policy  loan  modality.  This  has  been  specifically  introduced  since  the  Government  is\nalready implementing a time-bound administrative and financial devolution plan. The provincial\ngovernments  and  the  Federal  Government  will  also  discuss  the  cost  sharing  for  closing  and\nrationalizing  the  SOEs.  Furthermore,  funds  allocated  to  the  provinces  have  been  dedicated  to\ncommunity-based  research,  extension,  and  innovations  to  enhance  productivity.  Counterpart\nfunds will therefore directly support ADB\u2019s strategic development objective for poverty reduction\n\n\f30\n\nand also will supplement the policy reforms with measures to enhance the productivity of small\nand poor farm households.\n\nE.\n\nTranching and Monitoring\n\nfrom \n\n(SDR39,121,000 \n\nfrom  ordinary  capital  resources \n\nThe  proposed  ADB  loans  will  be  released  in  three  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of  $125\n97.\n[ADF]  and\nmillion  equivalent \nY9,154,500,000 \nloan\neffectiveness, based upon fulfillment of all first tranche conditions. The second tranche of $100\nmillion  equivalent  (SDR39,121,000  from  ADF  and  Y6,103,000,000  OCR)  is  expected  to  be\nreleased  within  18  months  of  loan  effectiveness  or  earlier,  subject  to  fulfilling  the  relevant\nconditions, but is not time-bound. The third tranche of $123 million equivalent (SDR17,996,000\nfrom ADF and Y12,206,000,000 from OCR) is expected to be released within 60 months of loan\neffectiveness or earlier upon fulfillment of the relevant conditions.\n\n[OCR])  will  be  released  upon \n\nthe  Asian  Development  Fund \n\n98.\nMINFAL,  through  the  PIU  and  its  Economic  Wing,  will  collect  benchmark  or  baseline\ndata  at  the  start  of  the  Program.  Regular  and  close  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the\nProgram will be undertaken by both the Government and ADB. Specific program performance\nindicators have been developed to assist with monitoring (Appendix 6). Program impact will be\nassessed particularly from the perspective of productivity gains for small and marginal farmers\nand  consumption  patterns  of  the  urban  and  rural  poor  due  to  shifts  in  market  prices  of  staple\nfood items. Mechanisms to monitor these will be assigned to independent research agencies, to\nbe appointed by MINFAL at the start of the Program.\n\nVII.\n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN\n\n99.\nThe  Government  has  determined  that  additional  support  will  be  required  to  effectively\nimplement,  sequence,  and  monitor  policy  reform  actions,  and  has  requested  ADB  TA  for  (i)\nprogram  coordination;  (ii)  improving  the  efficiency  of  commodity  markets;  (iii)  small  farmer\nextension, research, and safety nets; and (iv) reorganization and restructuring of SOEs. Other\nfunding  agencies  have  also  indicated  that  these  are  the  areas  where  assistance  is  urgently\nneeded and where ADB assistance would be best targeted.\n\nA.\n\nProgram Coordination\n\n100.\nTo  facilitate  the  design  of  the  elements  of  the  reform,  and  to  sequence  them  to  meet  the\ntranche release conditions, assistance will be provided to MINFAL and its provincial counterparts to\n(i)  maintain  consistency  of  outputs  with  the  Program  objectives  of  enhancing  the  profitability  of\nagricultural  production;  (ii)  advise  the  Government  on  price  and  subsidy  reform  measures;  (iii)\nreview all policy, legal, and institutional aspects for consistency in promoting efficient markets; (iv)\nensure  that  the  terms  of  participation  of  small  farmers  in  commodity  markets  improve;  (v)\nenhance private sector participation in agricultural research, education, and extension; and (vi)\nensure  that  SOEs  are  reorganized  with  adequate  emphasis  on  good  governance  and\nsustainability.\n\nB.\n\nImproving the Efficiency of Commodity Markets\n\n101. With the deregulation of trade in inputs, foodgrains, cash crops, and intermediate goods\nas  part  of  the  Program,  the  Government  has  sought  assistance  to  establish  an  appropriate\nlegislative  framework  and  guidelines  for  major  crops  (sugarcane  and  cotton)  and  for  inputs\n(fertilizer, agricultural chemicals, and seed) to meet the Program's objectives. The TA will also\nprovide support for establishing quality benchmarks and their control mechanisms in the private\nsector that would supplement the limited Government regulatory mechanisms.\n\n\f31\n\nC.\n\nSmall Farmer Extension, Research, and Safety Nets\n\n102.\nThe  TA  will  assess  the  most  effective  alternative  means  for  agricultural  extension,\nincluding through NGOs, from among the current pilot projects in Pakistan, and build plans (the\nagriculture  support  services  plans)  to  reorient  its  own  extension  system  accordingly.  MINFAL\nwill  be  assisted  in  (i)  preparing  plans  (the  research  institutes  plans  and  the  research  councils\nplan)  to  reorganize  the  research  establishments  and  develop  a  seamless  delivery  mechanism\nfor education, research, and extension; (ii) developing a plan that will enhance the participation\nand  benefits  for  small  farmers  (the  small  farmers  plan)  and  provide  safety  nets;  and  (iii)\nstructuring  the  counterpart  funds  allotted  to  the  provinces  into  trust  funds  with  defined  small\nfarmer focus.\n\n D.\n\nReorganization and Restructuring of SOEs\n\n103.\nThe  Government  will  need  to  direct,  manage,  and  sequence  the  reorganization  and\nrestructuring of SOEs in a manner that increases the opportunities for participation of the private\nsector.  The  TA  will  assist  the  Government  in  the  reorganization  of  the  provincial  and  national\nresearch  institutions,  and  more  specifically,  in  enabling  PASSCO  to  manage  the  strategic\nreserve. In addition, the TA will assist in the preparation of a corporate governance framework\nand  performance  standards  for  the  reorganized  SOEs,  and  will  develop  eligibility  criteria  for\naccess to public resources.\n\n104.\nThe  total  cost  of    the  TA  is  estimated  to  be  $2.8  million  equivalent,  comprising  $1.1\nmillion  in  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $1.7  million  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  provide  $2\nmillion to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $900,000 to partly meet the local currency\ncost. International and domestic consultants will be engaged from a consulting firm to implement\nthe  TA.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants. The Government has requested that ADB recruit the consultants on behalf of the\nGovernment  and  assist  the  Government  in  negotiating  the  contract  with  the  consultants.  The\nGovernment and the consultants will sign the contract. The Government has requested advance\nprocurement  action.  An  estimated  138  person-months  of  consulting  services  will  be  required,\nincluding  36  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  102  persons-months  of  domestic\nconsulting  services.  TA  components  are  expected  to  begin  in  February  2002  and  will  be\nimplemented  over  a  2-3  year  period.  Outline  terms  of  reference  and  cost  estimates  are  in\nAppendix 8.\n\nVIII.\n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA.\n\nImpacts\n\nThe  Program  will  have  significant  social,  financial,  and  economic  impacts  at  both  the\n105.\nnational  and  provincial  levels  on  stakeholders  including  farmers  (especially  small  and  poor\nfarmers  and  landless  farm  laborers),  rural  and  urban  consumers,  private  sector  agribusiness\nenterprises,  and  employees  of  the  public  sector.  The  impact  analysis  is  based  primarily  on  a\npartial  equilibrium  methodology37  through  changes  in  one  commodity  at  a  time,  and  then\nanalyzing the combined effect. Changes in prices, yields, cropped area, and cropping intensities\n\n37  Khan, M.E., Report on the Financial, Economic, and Poverty Impacts of the Proposed Policy Reforms, under TA\n\n                  \n\n3229-PAK, Islamabad, June 2001.\n\n\f32\n\nare modeled.38\n\n1. \n\nImpact on Prices\n\nThe Program is expected to rationalize agricultural input and output prices through policy\n106.\nreforms, including removal of subsidies, discontinuation of wheat price support policy, and trade\nand market liberalization. In the past, government support prices have been generally below the\nrelevant import and export parity prices, except in the case of sugarcane, where the support price\nhas been higher than the import parity price. With the Program, it is expected that in the medium\nterm (2001\u20132005), the farmgate prices in real dollar terms of wheat, basmati paddy, short grain\npaddy, and seed cotton will increase by 11, 24, 8, and 7 percent, respectively; and in the long run\n(by  2010)  by  17,  37,19,  and  23  percent,  respectively.  The  increase  in  prices  would  be  realized\nmainly due to two factors: (i) liberalization of trade that would bridge the gap between the export\nparity  price  and  the  support  prices  (and  the  consequent  wholesale  market  price),  and  (ii)\nincreases  in  world  commodity  prices.39  In  the  case  of  sugarcane,  however,  as  the  current  and\nprojected import parity prices are significantly lower than the support price, the farmgate price of\nsugarcane would fall by 27 percent in the short run with the unrestricted import of sugar but would\nincrease  by  6  percent  by  2010.  This  recovery  is  expected  to  be  realized  from  the  returns  on\ninvestment  in  extension  and  research  and  from  increases  in  world  sugar  prices.  Demand  and\nsupply elasticities average -0.9 for sugarcane and 0.5 for wheat, demonstrating that demand and\nsupply are inelastic. Sensitivity analysis on these price changes, assuming a 10 percent change of\nannual growth rate in both directions, demonstrates some sensitivity of wheat and paddy prices,\nranging from 5.3 to 5.7 percent compared with the base average annual growth rate by 2005 of\n5.5 percent.\n\n107.\nThe  first  2-3  years  after  the  commencement  of  the  Program  will  be  an  adjustment  or\ntransition period. During this period, the private sector market institutions and functionaries will\ngradually  replace  the  role  of  the  public  sector  market  and  institutions,  make  increased\ninvestment, and establish domestic and international marketing linkages. It is likely that during\nthis transition period, prices of major crops except sugarcane may fall slightly. Later, the prices\nwill  recover  and  stabilize  with  the  full  active  role  of  private  sector  institutions.  During  the\ntransition  period,  the  prices  for  consumers  may  temporarily  decrease.  Sugar  prices,  however,\nwill decrease significantly, due to lower import parity prices. With the elimination of the subsidy\non  wheat,  the  price  of  wheat  flour  may  increase  by  about  PRs1.25-1.50  per  kilogram.  This\nwould  require  an  additional  expenditure  of  $1.3-$1.6  (PRs87-100)  per  household  per  month,\nmeaning  an  addition  of  about  1.0  percent  for  food  expenditures  of  low-income  households\nearning less than $47 (PRs3,000) per month.\n\n2.\n\nImpact on Farm Production\n\n108. With  the  policy  and  price  reforms,  there  will  be  a  shift  in  cropping  patterns,  reflecting\ncomparative advantage and the relative profitability of crops. By 2005, it is estimated that yields of\nwheat, paddy, and seed cotton will increase by 5, 2, and 5 percent, respectively. Average cropped\narea and cropping intensities will also increase by about 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively. As\na  result,  total  production  of  these  crops  should  increase  to  23.5,  10.3,  and  6.4  million  tons,\nrespectively,  representing  increases  of  about  12  percent,  19  percent,  and  11  percent,\n\n38  Based  mainly  on  Ahmad,  Bashir,  Crop and Farm Budget Analysis,  prepared  under  TA  3229-PAK,  Faisalabad,\n\n                  \n\nJune 2001.\n\n39  Commodity Market Report, World Bank, March 2001.\n\n\f33\n\nrespectively,  over  the  production  levels  in  2000.  The  supply  and  adoption  of  improved  and\ncertified  seed  have  been  a  major  limiting  factor  in  productivity  gains.  Also,  the  supporting\nagricultural  services  of  research  and  extension  have  been  inefficiently  managed  due  to  their\ninappropriate administrative structures and lack of adequate funding. With the removal of seed\nmarketing barriers and increase in private seed company marketing of certified seed, coupled with\nthe restructuring of the service delivery institutions, by 2010 the estimated production will increase\nto 24.7, 10.9, and 6.9 million tons, respectively, for wheat, paddy, and seed cotton. In percentage\nterms,  the  increases  will  be  17  percent,  25  percent,  and  20  percent  for  the  three  crops.  Sugar\nproduction, however, is anticipated to decrease to 20.5 million tons from 46.3 million tons by 2005.\nHowever, with improved seed and research and extension services, sugar production is estimated\nto reach 23.0 million tons by 2010.  Sensitivity analysis on yields, assuming 10 percent changes in\nboth  directions,  indicates  some  sensitivity  of  wheat  and  paddy  yields,  similar  to  the  results  for\nprice sensitivities.\n\n3.\n\nImpact on Agriculture Sector Growth\n\nIt is anticipated that by 2005, the sector will be able to realize an annual growth rate of\n109.\nabout 4 percent with the marketing reforms alone. When complemented with the increased use\nof  certified  seed  and  the  restructuring  of  support  services,  by  2010  it  may  increase  to  a  5\npercent annual growth rate.\n\n4.\n\nImpact on Farm Household Income, Farm Labor, and Poverty Incidence\n\n110.\nThe Program will have a significant impact on farm household incomes. It is expected that\nwith  the  Program,  by  2005  the  annual  income  of  an  average  farm  household  will  increase  from\n$580 to $730 (27 percent). This increase in income should be realized through (i) changes in the\nprices  of  inputs  and  commodities,  and  (ii)  shifts  in  cropping  patterns  based  on  the  relative\nprofitability  of  crops.  By  2010,  it  is  estimated  that  the  average  farm  income  will  increase  by  67\npercent  from  the  base  year  due  to  (i)  increased  availability  of  improved  seed,  and  (ii)  improved\nsupport to farmers from agricultural research and extension services. The loss of income due to\nthe  anticipated  decrease  in  sugarcane  prices  will  be  compensated  by  increases  in  income  from\nsubstituting crops. It is also expected that, with the policy and price reforms alone, the demand for\nfarm  laborers  in  2005  will  increase  by  about  15  million  person-days,  or  about  2.4  percent.  With\nincreased productivity gains from improved seeds and institutional reforms, the labor requirement\nin  2010  will  increase  by  about  37  million  person-days  or about  6  percent.  This  will  increase  the\nhousehold incomes of landless laborers. Moreover, with the increase in the prices of commodities,\nthe wages of landless laborers will also increase. With the Program, the incidence of poverty in\nthe rural areas will be lowered from the existing 35 percent to about 33 percent.  For consumers,\nthe anticipated slight increases in the price of foodgrains will be offset by the decrease in the price\nof sugar. The rise in commodity prices will increase household expenditures on food items of the\nurban  and  rural  nonagricultural  households,  but  by  only  $7.50  and  $10  per  year,  respectively,\nwhich  is  an  increase  of  less  than  1  percent  over  present  expenditure  on  food  by  an  average\nhousehold.  In  addition,  the  Government  is  preparing  plans  for  targeted  poverty  reduction\nprograms  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas,  and  the  Program  will  assist  it  in  setting  up  these\nsupport  programs  to  target  poor  households.  The  annual  budgetary  requirement,  in  constant\nterms,  to  mitigate  the  additional  burden  on  households  that  are  below  the  poverty  line  is\nestimated at $27 million.\n\n\f34\n\n5.\n\nImpacts on Investment and Employment\n\n111.\nBy  providing  appropriate  incentives  to  private  sector  marketing  and  investment,  the\nproduction,  import,  and  marketing  of  seed  and  fertilizer  will  significantly  improve,  ensuring\ngreater  efficiencies  through  competitive  pricing  and  timely  provision  of  these  inputs.  With  the\nProgram,  the  private  sector  will  be  encouraged  to  replace  public  sector  marketing  and  trading\nactivities,  particularly  regarding  wheat  and  seeds.  It  is  estimated  that  by  the  year  2005,  12-15\nmillion tons of marketable surplus wheat  will be available for marketing institutions to handle. This\nincludes 3.5 million tons of wheat for export, after meeting the domestic requirements. Similarly,\nabout 3.3 million tons of rice and about 0.2 ton of cotton will be surplus for export. This will require\na sizeable investment and will generate employment opportunities in the private sector. However,\nflour and sugar mills, generally operating below the installed capacity and with suboptimal milling\nefficiencies,  will  lose  the  advantage  of  subsidized  wheat  and  overvalued  sugar  prices,  and  may\nclose  down  unless  they  invest  in  modernization.  This  may  cause  some  unemployment,  but  it  is\nexpected that the surplus employees will be absorbed in alternate employment in the expanding\nagroprocessing industries. Similarly, the divestment of public sector institutions will render some of\nthe  staff  surplus.  Initially,  they  will  be  absorbed  in  the  surplus  pool.  Nonetheless,  if  they  are\nreleased  with  severance  pay  and  some  training,  they  should  be  able  to  find  employment  in  the\nprivate sector.\n\n6. \n\nImpact on Public Sector Expenditure and Balance of Payments\n\n112.\nA  large  part  of  the  subsidy,  especially  for  wheat,  has  benefited  the  traders  and  the\nbetter-off urban consumers. Reducing and eventually eliminating the wheat subsidy will result in\nlarge fiscal savings for the Government that can be better spent on the ongoing targeted poverty\nreduction  programs.  The  average  annual  expenditure  on  the  wheat  subsidy  (Federal  and\nprovincial combined) over the last five years was about $145 million. This does not include the\nsubstantial costs of staff and other fixed costs, which will also be a saving to the Government.\n\n113. With PASSCO commercializing its strategic reserve operations in wheat, the net saving\nto the provinces will be $135-$140 million.40 Similarly, by closing various SOEs,41 there will be\nan additional annual saving of $15-20 million. This saving could then be diverted to public sector\nexpenditures on other social and infrastructure development programs. In addition, the provincial\ngovernments will be able to lease out or privatize the existing wheat storage facilities. Similarly,\nproviding increased autonomy to research organizations will encourage them to generate their\nown funds and be increasingly self-financing, and reorganization and decentralization of these\ninstitutions  will  reduce  expenditures  on  overlapping  functions.  This  saving  will  be  available  for\nincreased funding for the research institutions.\n\n114. With the policy reforms and liberalization of trade, the private sector will be able to export\nsurplus wheat, rice, and cotton. After adjusting for the value of sugar imports, the estimated value\nof incremental exports in 2005 will be about $1.9 billion. It is anticipated that, with the increase in\nfarm  productivity  achieved  through  seed  improvements  and  restructuring  of  research  and\nextension services, and adjusting for population increases, the total value of incremental exports\nin  2010  will  be  around  $2.0  billion.  This  will  contribute  to  improving  the  balance  of  payments\n\n                  \n\n40 The annual operating loss reported by PASSCO in 2000 was about $23 million for the management of about 1.25\nmillion tons. Under the Program, with commercialization of operations and induction of provincial representatives\non  the  board  of  governors,  there  may  be  some  cost  savings  through  improved  management  and  economies  of\nscale.\n\n41  These organizations include FID, SSC, SASO, ADA, and the provincial food departments.\n\n\f35\n\nsituation of the country.\n\nB. \n\nJustification\n\nThe  Government  is  committed  to  further  liberalizing  agricultural  trade,  divesting  SOEs,\n115.\ndiscontinuing  its  price  support  policy,  withdrawing  subsidies  in  general  and  in  wheat  in\nparticular, restructuring and strengthening research and extension departments, and realigning\nexisting  relevant  institutions.  These  reforms  will  require  substantial  financial  resources  to  (i)\nbridge  the  revenue  gap  in  the  short  run,  (ii)  implement  a  staff  retrenchment  and  retraining\nprogram,  (iii)  establish  endowment  funds  for  supporting  innovative  research  and  extension\napproaches,  (iv)  provide  incentives  and  credit  to  private  sector  investment,  and  (v)  support\ntargeted poverty reduction programs. The Program will assist the Government in implementing\nthis reform agenda by providing the requisite financial resources.\n\n116.\nThe overall goals of the Program are consistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy, which aims\nat (i) reducing poverty, (ii) increasing the efficiency of public sector organizations and improving\ngovernance, (iii) expanding the role of the private sector, and (iv) rationalizing the role of public\ninstitutions.  The  Federal  Government  has  also  ensured  fair  compensation  to  the  provincial\ngovernments  to  absorb  the  adjustment  costs  and  to  implement  the  targeted  poverty  reduction\nprograms.\n\nC.\n\nRisks\n\n117.\nThe  main  risk  associated  with  program  loans  often  relates  to  the  Government\u2019s\nsustained  support  throughout  the  implementation  period.  The  current  Government  is  fully\ncommitted  to  the  policy  and  institutional  reforms  contained  in  the  Program.  It  is  clear  that  the\nimplementation period of this Program will extend beyond the tenure of this administration, viz.,\nOctober 2002. However, there is a reason to believe that the Program will be equally supported\nby any future administration, as the major benefits of many of its components will start yielding\nresults  within  the  first  year  and  many  others  relate  to  irreversible  structural  changes  that  will\nhave taken root by then. There is also a risk of unsustained provincial government support for\nthe  Program,  particularly  with  regard  to  the  planned  phaseout  of  the  wheat  subsidy  and\nreduction in provincial government procurement, management, and marketing of wheat. The 5-\nyear  implementation  period  of  the  Program  with  three  undated  tranches  will  provide  adequate\ntime to implement the reforms. Contraction of the government activities in wheat will follow the\nprice  and  subsidy  reforms,  coupled  with  the  planned  expansion  in  private  sector  marketing\nactivities.\n\n118. Other  than  political  risks,  programs  sometimes  also  face  social  and  financial  risks.\nAlthough the proposed reform agenda is ambitious, it is prioritized, sequenced, and interlinked,\nand  was  prepared  in  consultation  with  all  relevant  stakeholders  in  private  and  public  sector\ninstitutes  and  organizations.  Therefore,  it  is  expected  to  gain  wide  acceptance  among  the\nconcerned  interest  groups  and  institutions,  minimizing  the  social  risk.  Many  elements  of  the\ninstitutional reforms of the Program were initiated by the agencies of the Federal and provincial\ngovernments themselves. Therefore, the risk of slow implementation progress is also minimal. A\ngreat majority of the target group of this Program are farmers. They are the main beneficiaries\nof these reforms, in terms of fair prices for farm output and support from public sector research\nand extension services for increasing farm productivity. Consultations with many farmer groups\nat  the  village  level  as  well  as  with  their  representative  organizations  were  held  during  the\npreparation of the Program. The feedback has demonstrated their positive response. The main\nsocial  risk  is  associated  with  the  well  being  of  the  most  vulnerable  groups  both  in  rural  and\nurban areas, who would be worse off due to increased food prices. Targeted poverty reduction\n\n\f36\n\nprograms  are  included  to  ensure  that  the  poor  benefit  through  food  subsidies  and  increased\nemployment opportunities.\n\n119.\nThe  price  stability  of  agricultural  produce,  especially  food  crops,  and  fair  prices  to\nproducers  and  consumers  are  among  the  important  objectives  of  this  Program.  In  case  of  a\nsudden drop in world commodity prices and/or lack of demand from importing countries, domestic\nprices will also fall. Under the Program, a floor price mechanism will be introduced for wheat as\nexists now for cotton and rice, whereby the Government will intervene in the market and support a\nprice  that  provides  adequate  production  incentive  and  return  on  farmers  investment.  In  such  a\nscenario,  the  Government  would  continue  buying  wheat  and  supporting  the  floor  price  until  the\nprice  increases,  indicating  shortages  and  increased  market  demand,  at  which  time  the\nGovernment  will  stop  buying.  Similarly,  in  the  case  of  a  sudden  increase  in  consumer  prices,\ngovernment  intervention  may  be  inevitable  to  provide  the  necessary  safeguards  for  poor  and\nvulnerable groups. Periodic farm income studies by independent research institutes accompanied\nby wide dissemination of findings will help monitor the real impact on farm incomes and assess if\nthe total profit is still higher after slight decreases in prices, compared with the base year.\n\n120.\nThe monitoring mechanisms for improved management of the wheat strategic reserves by\nPASSCO  and  the  provincial  food  departments  spell  out  clearly  the  threshold  levels  and\nmechanisms  for  entry  and  intervention  as  corrective  mechanisms,  and  an  exit  strategy,  without\ncompromising  the  objectives  of  the  Program.  In  addition,  during  the  transition  stage,  due  to\npossible collusion of market functionaries, market failure, or lack of adequate investment capacity\nof the private sector, farmers may not receive satisfactory prices at harvest time. Similarly, traders\nmay hoard the produce to create artificial shortages. In such eventualities, various farmer groups,\nespecially those representing large farmers with political clout, and consumers may pressure the\nGovernment  for  a  reversal  of  reforms.  The  monitoring  mechanisms  will  help  ensure  the\nimplementation  of  regulatory  mechanisms  and  measures  to  prevent  hoarding  and  collusion,  as\nwell as provision of adequate finances for both working capital and investment.\n\nThe  existing \n\nresearch  system \n\nis  bureaucratically  managed,  underfunded,  and\n121.\nnonresponsive to farmers or industry. Given the existing rigid administrative rules of business and\nprocedures, the present system does not offer adequate incentives to research staff, in terms of\ncompensation and returns for high quality research, but provides safeguards to job security with\nthe\nminimal  accountability.  With \nperformance of the research staff will be periodically reviewed by the stakeholders managed by\ntheir boards. The pace of the proposed restructuring and transition may be politically resisted by\ninefficient staff who will be vulnerable under the new system. The institutional restructuring aimed\nat  providing  autonomy  to  the  research  system  will  therefore  take  into  account  the  needs,\nperceptions,  and  concerns  of  all  stakeholders,  including  research  staff,  farmers,  commodity\ntraders,  agroprocessors,  and  consumers.  There  will  be  a  cost  to  the  economy  of  delaying  the\npolicy  reforms.  The  TA  consultants  will  help  ensure  a  practical  time  frame  to  design  and\nimplement the transition of research management.\n\nincreasing  autonomy  given \n\nto  research \n\ninstitutes, \n\nthe \n\n122.\nSimilarly,  the  existing  agriculture  extension  system  is  ineffective  due  to  inadequate\nlinkages  and  interface  among  research,  extension,  and  farmers.  The  reorganization  of  the\nextension  systems  to  adopt  approaches  that  are  farmer  responsive  and  accessible  to  small\nfarmers,  with  active  coordination  with  rural  support  programs,  NGOs,  and  input  marketing\nfunctionaries, could be constrained by various factors. There is a need for improved training and\nrefresher  courses  for  extension  staff,  and  increased  budget  support  and  mobility.  To  ensure\neffective and sustainable delivery of services, the performance needs to be monitored and made\naccountable.  Under \nthe  Government,\nstrengthened  local  government  institutions  will  monitor  and  supervise  the  activities  and\n\nthe  new  decentralization  and  devolution  plan  of \n\n\f37\n\nperformance of the extension services at the village level.\n\nIX.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe Government and the provincial governments have given the following assurances, in\n\n123.\naddition to the standard assurances, which are incorporated in the Loan Agreement:\n\n(i) \n\nthe policies and actions included in the Program and specified in the development\npolicy  letter  and  the  policy  matrix  will  be  adopted  in  a  timely  manner,  and  such\npolicies  and  actions  will  continue  to  be  in  effect  during  the  Program  period  and\nsubsequently; and\n\n(ii) \n\nadequate and timely counterpart funds to implement the Program will be provided.\n\nX.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n124.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB,  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the\nArticles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board approve:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 96,238,000 to\nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Agriculture Sector Program II, with a term\nof 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest rate of 1 percent\nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum  during  the\namortization  period,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in\naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the\nBoard;\n\nthe loan of Y27,463,500,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Agriculture\nSector Program II, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources with a term of 15 years,\nincluding  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  and  with  interest  to  be  determined  in\naccordance  with  ADB's  LIBOR-based  loan  facility,  and  such  other  terms  and\nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan\nAgreement presented to the Board; and\n\nthe technical assistance loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing\nRights  1,565,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Agriculture  Sector\nProgram  II,  with  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  an\ninterest rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per\nannum during the amortization period, and such other terms and conditions as are\nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  TA  Loan  Agreement\npresented to the Board.\n\n22 November 2001\n\nMYOUNG-HO SHIN\nVice-President\n\n\f38\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber Title\n\nProgram Framework\n\nMajor Agriculture Sector Institutions\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\nDevelopment Policy Letter and Policy Matrix\n\nPoverty  and  Social \nConsultation\n\nImpact  Assessment  and  Public\n\nCompliance  Measures  for  Trance  Releases  and  Monitoring\nIndicators\n\nIneligible Items\n\nOutline Terms of Reference for Consulting Services\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n\n(page, para.)\n\n39\n\n46\n\n51\n\n54\n\n64\n\n71\n\n80\n\n81\n\n1,2\n\n6,20\n\n17,54\n\n22,70\n\n27,88\n\n29,93\n\n29,94\n\n31,104\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\n\nFinancial,  Economic,  and  Poverty  Impacts  of  the  Proposed\nPolicy Reforms\n\nEnvironmental Assessment of the Program\n\nProblem and Objective Tree Analyses\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\n\fDesign Summary\n\nPerformance Targets\n\nMonitoring Mechanism\n\nAssumptions and Risks\n\nPROGRAM FRAMEWORK\n\nGoals/Sector Impacts\n1.

This  will  be  achieved\nthrough (i) rationalizing the prices of agricultural inputs and outputs through market liberalization\n(removal of international and domestic trade restrictions), (ii) curtailing the role and expenditure\non public sector marketing and storage operations, (iii) encouraging higher returns to investment\nin  public  sector  research  and  extension  services,  and  (iv)  generating  employment  through\nincreased private sector investment and involvement of nongovernment organizations (NGOs).\nThe proposed strategies reflect the recommendations of the initial and follow-up studies for the\nProgram that were discussed in several provincial and Federal stakeholder workshops in 2000\nand 2001.\n\n2.\nDifferent  studies  carried  out  in  Pakistan  suggest  that  during  the  past  few  years  the\nincidence  of  poverty  has  increased  together  with  widening  income  disparity  between  the  rich\nand the poor, and between urban and rural areas. These studies also indicate that, during the\n1970s and 1980s, there was significant reduction in poverty, measured by various indexes. The\ncontributing  factors  were  the  green  revolution,  industrial  growth,  and  overseas  remittances.  In\nthe 1990s, the poverty incidence showed a reverse trend, and increased from about 20 percent\nto  30-35  percent.  Since  about  60  percent  of  the  population  live  in  rural  areas  with  relatively\nlower economic opportunities, the incidence of rural poverty is relatively higher.\n\nThe major factors responsible for the rising incidence of poverty include an increase in\n3. \nthe  dependency  ratio,  slow  industrial  growth,  fall  in  remittances,  low  investment  in  social,\nphysical,  and  productive  infrastructure  (especially  in  rural  areas),  higher  prices  of  agricultural\ninputs,  lower  prices  for  outputs,  lack  of  policy  environment  for  increased  private  sector\ninvestment and employment generation, and poor delivery of services by research and livestock\nextension  staff.  To  reverse  this  trend,  the  Government  is  finalizing  its  poverty  reduction\nstrategies  and  requiring  ongoing  and  upcoming  development  programs  and  investments  to\nfocus on poverty reduction.\n\nB.\n\nMeasuring the Impacts of Reforms\n\n4.\n  The  overall  objectives  of  the  Program  are  to  (i)  improve  agricultural  productivity  and\nprofitability; (ii) stabilize prices for producers and consumers; (iii) increase household incomes of\nthe  poor,  especially  marginally  and  very  poor  rural  households;  and  (iv)  make  better  use  of\npublic sector expenditures. This will lead to capital formation in rural areas, promote the private\nsector,  and  enhance  employment  generation.  The  savings  from  reduced  public  sector\nexpenditure can be diverted to social programs, which again will have a direct impact on quality\nof  life  of  the  poor  people.  Some  of  the  Program  recommendations  may  possibly  have  some\nnegative  impacts,  due  to  divestiture  and  downsizing  of  public  sector  institutions.  Nonetheless,\nthese  will  be  offset  by  expansion  in  the  private  sector.  Moreover,  the  reorganization  of\ninstitutions responsible for the provision of services will improve the output and accessibility to\npoor  farmers,  and  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  farm  productivity  and  household  income.\nSimilarly, there will be significant positive ramifications on the overall macroeconomic situation.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 5, page 2\n\nC.\n\nMethodology\n\n5.\nThe  Bank\u2019s  methodology  for  conducting  a  social  impact  assessment  of  program  loans\nrequires  an  analysis  of  the  impact  that  policy  actions  will  have  on  economic  conditions.\nBudgetary savings to the Federal and provincial governments (PGs) in public expenditures and\nimproved efficiency in the marketing system will have major economic impacts. Two scenarios\nare analyzed: Scenario 1 assumes that the Government will not implement the proposed policy\nand  institutional  reforms;  and  Scenario  2  assumes  that  the  Government  will  implement  the\nproposed reforms under the Program.\n\n6. \nThe  impact  of  each  intervention  of  the  Program  is  considered  and  grouped  into  four\ncategories: (i) direct effects, (ii) indirect effects, (iii) macroeconomic effects, and (iv) effect on the\npoor  (both  urban  and  rural  and  if  are  there  any  vulnerable  groups).  In  each  category,  various\nmeasurement indicators are discussed including (i) the Government\u2019s budgetary position, (ii) the\nrole  of  the  private  sector,  (iii)  prices  of  farm  inputs  and  outputs,  (iv)  performance  and\naccessibility  of  delivery  services,  (v)  farm  productivity  enhancement,  and  (vi)  positive  and\nnegative impacts on poor households.\n\nD.\n\nPolicy Options with Significant Impact on the Poor\n\nThe Program will have both direct and indirect impacts on the poverty level. The reforms,\n7. \nsuch  as  discontinuation  of  price  support  and  removal  of  restrictions  on  international  and\ndomestic  trade,  will  have  positive  impacts  on  the  income  of  farmers,  especially  small  farmers,\nand to some extent the landless poor. Similarly, divesting of public enterprises and withdrawing\nbudgetary  support,  increasing  the  role  of  the  private  sector,  exploring  options  for  increased\nautonomy  of  research  institutions,  revitalizing  extension  services,  and  reorganizing  and\ndecentralizing institutions with redundant and or overlapping functions will also have both direct\nand indirect impacts on the poor. The benefits of the Program to the poor significantly outweigh\nthe  costs  to  vulnerable  groups,  and  any  adverse  impacts  can  be  mitigated  through\nsupplementing the ongoing social safety net and food security and support programs, as well as\nsupporting new programs targeting small farmers.\n\nE. \n\nImpact Scenarios\n\n1.\n\nScenario 1: Reforms Not Implemented\n\nUnder this scenario, farmers will continue to receive distorted prices, for both inputs and\n8. \noutputs, and as a result will have low farm incomes. The continuation of a monopolistic public\nsector role in the marketing will further constrain the growth of the private sector. The budgetary\nsupport  requirement  for  the  wheat  subsidy  and  the  public  enterprises  in  the  sector  would\ncontinue to increase substantially, and contribute to the widening government deficit. Similarly,\nthe service delivery mechanisms (research and extension) in their present form will continue to\nbe inefficient and constrain growth in farm incomes. The inadequate availability of high yielding\nand  good  quality  seed  will  continue  to  be  a  constraint  in  achieving  the  potential  for  higher\nproductivity. Moreover, institutions that are redundant and are engaged in overlapping activities\nwill  continue  to  be  a  drain  on  public  resources.  The  performance  and  accessibility  of  these\ninstitutions to the poor will further deteriorate.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 5, page 3\n\n   \n\na. \n\nDirect Impact1\n\n9. \nWithout reforms, the controls on prices of agricultural inputs and outputs will continue to\ndistort  the  terms  of  trade  for  the  agriculture  sector.  The  Government,  notably  the  Punjab\nGovernment, will continue to procure wheat at the support price but will likely not be willing to\nraise it because of the increasing budgetary cost and inability to dispose of rising surpluses. In\naddition,  the  restrictions  on  free  interprovince  and  interdistrict  movements  will  constrain  open\nmarket  initiatives,  and  farmers  will  receive  lower  and  noncompetitive  prices.  At  present,  the\nsupport prices of wheat, rice, and cotton are lower than the export parity prices of the respective\ncrops. Without the Program, given the projected increase in commodity prices, the divergence\nbetween the two would further widen. At present, the average annual farm income is less than\nwhat it should be if markets were liberalized.\n\n10.  Without the Program, given the institutional inefficiencies and leakages, the expenditure\nand  budgetary  requirements  will  grow  exponentially,  and  public  sector  marketing  and  trading\ncompanies  will  continue  to  lose  money  and  increasingly  depend  on  budgetary  support.  At\npresent,  the  average  annual  public  sector  expenditure  on  organizations  such  as  Pakistan\nAgricultural Storage and Supplies Corporation (PASSCO), and the provincial food departments\nresponsible  for  wheat  procurement,  storage,  and  subsidy  is  about  $143  million.  In  addition  to\nthis, the other related state-owned enterprises (SOEs)2 incur an operation loss of about $15-20\nmillion annually. This expenditure is expected to grow due to increasing operational costs. If this\ntrend continues, the Government will have to reduce the investment in other sectors, especially\nthe social sectors. This will have a direct impact on the quality of life and accessibility to social\nservices for the poor segments of the population.\n\nb.\n\nIndirect Impact\n\n11.\n Without reforms, the price fixation policy will continue to distort the relative profitability of\ncrops.  In  the  case  of  sugarcane,  for  which  Pakistan  does  not  have  a  comparative  advantage,\nthe  support  price  is  higher  than  the  import  parity  price.  This  has  led  to  inefficient  allocation  of\nland and water resources, which otherwise can be allocated to crops such as wheat, rice, cotton\nand to other high-value crops for which Pakistan has a comparative advantage. Consequently,\nthe  negative  balance  of  trade  would  continue  to  increase.  Government  budgetary  support  will\ncontinue  to  provide  protection  to  inefficient  SOEs,  and  will  discourage  private  sector\ninvestments in marketing and agribusiness.  Similarly, as the public sector capacity to produce\nand disseminate high-yielding good quality seed is limited, the yields will continue to be lower\nthan  its  potential,  and  will  discourage  the  private  sector  seed  industry  that  could  meet  the\ndemand for the quality seed. The bureaucratically administered research institutions, with their\ntop-down  approach,  will  continue  to  offer  insufficient  incentive  to  researchers,  and  hence  low\nreturns. Without adaptive and problem-solving research support, farmers will remain reluctant to\ninvest in new farm production measures, adjust cropping patterns to changes in dwindling water\navailability  regimes,  or  adopt  other  post  harvest  and  storage  methods.  The  continuation  of\ninstitutions with redundant and overlapping functions will waste public resources.\n\n                  \n\n1  The  estimated  magnitude  of  impact  in  terms  of  yields,  prices,  household  incomes,  and  budgetary  savings  has\nbeen adopted from \u201cReport on the Financial, Economic, and Poverty Impacts of the Proposed Policy Reforms,\u201d for\nADB TA 3229: Agriculture Sector Program, Islamabad, June 2001.\n\n2  These organizations include the Fertilizer Import Department, National Fertilizer Development Centre, Sindh Seed\n\nCorporation, Sindh Agricultural Supplies Organization, and Agriculture Development Agency.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 5, page 4\n\nc.\n\nMacroeconomic Impact\n\n12.  Without  reforms,  the  continuation  of  distorted  prices  will  result  in  retarded  growth  in\nagriculture,  misallocation  of  resources  towards  inefficient  crops,  and  increased  urban-rural\nincome  disparities,  falling  agricultural  rates,  increased  requirement  of  foreign  exchange  to\nimport  food  grains  to  feed  the  increasing  population,  and  decreased  balance  of  payments.\nContinued misallocation of resources to public marketing institutions will encourage the flow of\nfunds  out  of  the  agriculture  sector  to  nonagriculture  sectors.  This  will  also  discourage  private\nsector investments. Restrictions on the movement of commodities and storage by public sector\ninstitutions will continue to increase. Similarly, the research and extension services will continue\nto  be  inefficient,  and  public  expenditures  will  have  poor  payoffs  and  little  impact  on  farm\nproductivity.  The  continuation  of  institutions  with  redundant  and  overlapping  agenda  will  put\ncontinuous pressure on resources. The overall macroeconomic impact will be low growth rates\nin agriculture, and decreasing balance of payments.\n\nd.\n\nImpact on the Poor\n\n13.\nThe  distorted  price  policy  has  an  adverse  impact  on  small  farmers\u2019  incomes  due  to\nunfavorable terms of trade and low marketable surpluses of food crops. Due to inefficient public\nsector trading enterprises and trade restrictions, the prices of inputs are relatively higher and for\nthe  prices  of  outputs  lower  than  what  may  prevail  in  a  free  trade  environment.  This  is\ntantamount  to  a  regressive  tax,  especially  on  the  poor  and  small  farmers.  Similarly,  restricted\nmovement of farm commodities also has an adverse impact on the incomes of poor farmers and\nconsumers.  Poor  farmers  typically  do  not  benefit  from  research  and  new  technologies,\nespecially  access  to  newly  developed  high-yielding  varieties,  and  good  quality  seed.  Even  if\nthey  are  available,  they  reach  poor  farmers  after  a  considerable  time  lag,  resulting  in  low\nproductivity and income.\n\n2.\n\nScenario 2: Program Reforms Implemented\n\n14.\nThe  reforms  (Scenario  2)  would  positively  affect  farm  productivity,  prices  of  inputs  and\noutputs,  household  incomes  in  rural  areas  (particularly  of  small,  poor,  and  landless  farmers),\nresearch and extension services, agricultural growth rates, and balance of payments. There will\nbe  some  negative  impact  on  the  household  expenditure  of  the  urban  poor  and  nonagriculture\npoor, but this will be offset by support to these groups from poverty reduction and food security\nprograms.  This  support  to  the  poor  can  be  financed  either  through  savings  from  reduced\nagriculture subsidies and public expenditure or support from external funding, including the local\ncurrency proceeds of the Program Loan.\n\na. \n\nDirect Impact\n\n15.\nThe discontinuation of price interventions with respect to agricultural inputs and outputs\nwill  improve  the  terms  of  trade  for  agriculture.  The  prices  for  inputs  and  outputs  will  be\ndetermined  in  open  and  competitive  markets.  Moreover,  farmers  will  be  able  to  increase  their\nincomes  and  modify  their  cropping  patterns  in  response  to  changes  in  prices  and  relative\nprofitability.  It  is  estimated  that  with  the  discontinuation  of  support  prices  and  liberalization  of\ntrade, by 2005, the real prices of wheat, basmati paddy, short grain paddy, and seed cotton will\nincrease by 11, 24, 8, and 7 percent, respectively. In the long run (by 2010), based on projected\ninternational prices,3  farmgate prices are expected to increase respectively by 17, 37, 19, and\n\n3  Commodity Market Report, World Bank, March 2001.\n\n                  \n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 5, page 5\n\n23  percent,  over  the  base  year.  It  is  also  anticipated  that  by  2005,  with  adjustment  to  import\nparity prices, sugarcane prices will fall by 27 percent.\n\n16.\nProduction  levels  will  also  change.  It  is  estimated  that  the  production  of  wheat,  paddy,\nand  seed  cotton  will  increase  in  2005  by  12,  19,  and  11  percent,  respectively.  In  the  case  of\nsugarcane,  it  is  estimated  that,  due  to  crop  substitution,  initially  the  production  will  decrease\nfrom 46.3 million tons to 20.5 million tons, but by 2005, it will increase to 23 million tons due to\nimproved seed adoption and to research and extension support services. The major thrust in the\nincrease  in  yield,  especially  in  the  long  run  (to  2010),  will  be  realized  by  wider  availability  of\nnewly  developed  high-yielding  varieties  and  good  quality  seed,  produced  and  marketed  by\nprivate sector seed enterprises. This will ensure more quantity of seed, both existing and new\nvarieties, better quality, and more timely delivery at lower prices to farmers.\n\n17.\nIn  the  likely  event  that  research  institutions  become  increasingly  autonomous,  they  will\nbe more responsive to the needs and priorities of farmers. The research institutes will be able to\ngenerate  funds  through  contract  research.  This  will  also  provide  incentives  to  researchers  to\ndevelop  packages  using  new  technologies  that  are  responsive  to  sector  needs.  Similarly,  the\nProgram  will  revitalize  the  extension  activities,  and  strengthen  their  capacity  and  capability  to\nprovide accessible services to farmers in general and to marginal and poor farmers in particular.\nThis will have a direct impact on farm incomes, especially of marginal, small, and poor farmers.\nIn  addition,  higher  productivity  together  with  the  efficient  marketing  infrastructure  will  stabilize\nboth  producer  and  the  consumer  prices.    NGO  involvement  in  innovative  extension  programs\nwith government support will be able to effectively target small farmers.\n\nIt is estimated that by 2005, the annual farm income of an average farm household will\n18.\nincrease  by  27  percent,  and  by  a  total  of  67  percent  by  2010,  based  on  current  prices.  The\nchange  in  income  will  accrue  from  removal  of  price  distortions,  changes  in  cropping  patterns,\nand increased farm productivity due to access to improved research and extension support.\n\n19. With  the  closure  of  and  withdrawal  of  budgetary  support  to  the  public  marketing  and\ntrading enterprises, the pressure on public expenditures will be eased. It is estimated that, with\nthe reorganization and improved management of PASSCO, and with the closure of SOEs and\nprovincial food departments, there will be a net saving of $135-$140 million annually. With the\nsavings thus generated, the Government will be able to invest in other sectors, especially social\nsectors. This will have a direct impact on the quality of life and accessibility to social services of\nthe poorer segments of the population. Moreover, the divestment of public marketing agencies\nwill promote private sector investment and employment generation. This will also have a direct\nimpact on reducing poverty.\n\n \n\nb.\n\nIndirect Impact\n\n20.\n  As  subsidies  are  eliminated  and  markets  liberalized,  prices  will  no  longer  be  fixed  but\ndetermined in open markets and farmers will receive higher prices. This will encourage capital\nformation in the sector due to the reduced risk for investment, both at the farm level and at the\nprocessing level. This will also encourage the adoption of new technologies at a faster rate and\nfurther expand capital formation in the agriculture sector. The reorganization and redefinition of\nthe  roles  of  institutions  with  redundant  and  or  overlapping  functions  will  save  public\nexpenditures and will facilitate institutions being responsive to farmers' needs. The public sector\ntrading companies will be phased out and the private sector will fill the gaps through increased\ninvestment  and  employment  opportunities.  The  seed  industry,  which  was  constrained  by  the\npublic  sector  monopoly,  will  be  encouraged  to  invest  in  the  production  and  marketing  of  good\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 5, page 6\n\nquality  seed  at  competitive  prices.  With  increased  autonomy  to  research  institutions,\nresearchers will address farmers needs, and hence higher returns will be obtained from efficient\nallocation of research funds. With the increase in farm productivity, the farm labor requirement\nwill  also  increase.  It  is  estimated  that  the  policy  reforms  alone  will  generate  about  15  million\nperson-days  or  about  2.4  percent  of  the  current  annual  labor  requirement.  With  the  increased\nuse  of  certified  seed  and  improved  research  and  extension  support,  the  total  annual  labor\nrequirement will go up to about 37 million person-days or 6 percent of the current annual labor\nrequirement. This will provide job opportunities and higher income to landless labor.\n\nc.\n\nMacroeconomic Impact\n\n21. With  the  price  and  market  reforms,  it  is  estimated  that,  by  2005,  the  incremental\ncontribution of agriculture will be about $1.9 billion. In addition, with improved access to seeds\nand  better  research  and  extension  support  services  to  farmers,  the  productivity  gains  will\nincrease  by  2010  to  about  $2.0  billion.  It  is  also  anticipated  that  the  annual  growth  rate  of\nagriculture by 2005 will improve to about 5.5 percent. With improved seed delivery and use, and\nmore effective support services, an overall growth rate of about 6.7 percent can be realized by\n2010.\n\nd.\n\nImpact on the Poor\n\nIt  is  anticipated  that,  with  the  improved  returns  in  agriculture  and  increased  farm  labor\n22. \ndemand, the existing poverty incidence of about 35 percent will decrease to around 33 percent.\nHowever, it is estimated that the annual food expenditures of nonfarm households will increase\nin  2005  by  0.5  percent,  and  in  2010  by  1.0  percent,  or  $7.50  in  rural  areas  and  $10  in  urban\nareas. With market and price liberalization, the prices of inputs and outputs will be rationalized.\nThe lower prices of inputs and higher prices for outputs will translate into higher farm incomes.\nSimilarly, free movement of farm commodities will stabilize prices for farmers. The rationalized\nprices  and  favorable  terms  of  trade  will  have  positive  impacts  on  farm  income  especially  for\nsmall  and  poor  farmers.  The  increased  role  of  the  private  sector  will  generate  employment\nopportunities  for  the  underemployed  and  the  unemployed.  In  addition,  the  accessibility  of  the\npoor  to  public  services  will  also  increase,  and  poor  farmers  will  benefit  in  terms  of  increased\nfarm productivity and farm income.\n\nF. \n\nPublic Consultations\n\n23. \nTwo  provincial  workshops  and  one  Federal-level  stakeholder  workshop  were  held  in\n2000  during  the  preparation  of  the  Program  to  obtain  feedback  from  a  mix  of  policy  makers,\nplanners,  research  and  extension  specialists,  representatives  of  farmer  organizations,  and\nNGOs. The proposed policy and institutional reforms were discussed. In addition, consultations\nwere held, most recently in April 2001, with representatives of the Federal Government, the four\nPGs,  farmers,  heads  of  farmer  associations  in  Punjab  and  Sindh,  NGOs,  and  private  sector\ninput companies.\n\n24. \nThe stakeholders consulted generally agreed with the proposed policy reforms, such as\nliberalization of marketing and trade activities, divestment of SOEs, removal of prohibitions on\nthe  interdistrict  and  interprovincial  movement  of  agricultural  commodities,  etc.  However,  the\nfarmers were in favor of a continuation of a wheat support price policy. Although farmers argued\nfor  a  continuation  of  subsidy  on  inputs,  they  agreed  that  the  private  sector  should  also  be\nallowed  to  import  and  market  inputs  without  restrictions.  However,  farmers  asserted  that  the\nGovernment  should  regulate  and  monitor  the  activities  and  business  practices  of  the  private\nsector  so  that  cartels  and  collusion  of  traders  and  importers  do  not  exploit  the  farming\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 5, page 7\n\ncommunity. Farmers generally endorsed the idea of monitoring the quality standards of inputs\nand  outputs.  However,  they  did  not  favor  any  addition  to  the  present  agricultural  tax  structure\nand felt that the sector is already overtaxed. They felt that a crop-based income tax is preferable\nto the current agricultural income tax.\n\n25. \nRegarding the provision of support services, the stakeholders consulted agreed with the\nplans  under  the  National  Drainage  Program  to  relocate  extension  agents  along  the  hydraulic\nboundaries working closely with the newly formed farmer organizations. However, they felt that\nthe  extension  agents  do  not  have  much  to  offer,  as  their  knowledge  is  outdated,  and  hence\nneed training. Most participants agreed that a major reorientation of extension and research is\nrequired.  The  farmers  felt  that  the  veterinary  services  (both  preventive  and  curative)  and\nartificial  insemination  services  should  continue  to  be  provided  free  by  the  livestock  extension\ndepartments.  There  was  general  agreement  on  the  proposal  to  hire  women  extension  agents,\nespecially  to  work  with  women  on  kitchen  gardening,  fruit  and  vegetable  preservation,  and\nlivestock activities.\n\n\fCOMPLIANCE MEASURES FOR TRANCHE RELEASES AND MONITORING INDICATORS\n\nPolicy Conditions\n\nActions Required for Compliance\n\nTranche\n\nMonitoring Indicators\n\nResponsible\nAgency\n\nMINFAL,\nMOC, PGs\n\n1st\n\n\u2022  Producer prices correspond\nto relevant border prices.\n\u2022  Private  sector\u2019s  share \n\nin\ntotal market seed increases\nfrom 50 to 75 percent.\n\nA.
