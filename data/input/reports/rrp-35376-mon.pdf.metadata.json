The Governance Reform \nProgram (GRP)1 led to the formulation of a 10-year reform roadmap to \nbe implemented over 1999\u20132009. GRP also helped implement critical \nadministrative  and  financial  management  reforms  on  a  pilot  basis  in \nselected  budgetary  agencies  over  1999-2002.  A  milestone \nachievement  of  GRP  was \nthe  Public  Sector \nManagement and Finance Law (PSMFL), which provides a sound legal \nframework  to  guide  budget,  output,  performance,  and  financial \nmanagement reforms. \n \nWhile its processes have been strengthened through GRP, the public \nsector  continues  to  face  significant  challenges  and  constraints.  It  is \nlarge  and  inefficient,  and  significantly  risks  fiscal  instability  unless \nconcerted  reforms  as  provided  by  PSMFL  are  undertaken.  The \nGovernment\u2019s forward-looking approach, formulated with support from \nimprove  public \nADB  and  other \nexpenditure management and enhance the quality of public services to \nreduce  poverty;  (ii)  implement  PSMFL  systematically through learning \nby  doing,  given  the  capacity  constraints;  (iii)  infuse  sound  financial \nresponsibility  at  all \nmanagement  practices \ngovernment  levels;  (iv)  strengthen  the  civil  service;  (v)  address \nmedium-term  issues  of  administrative  consolidation  at  the  regional, \nprovincial (aimag), and district (soum) levels, to enhance economies of \nscale  and  achieve  efficiency  in  delivery  of  public  services;  and \n(vi) mainstream governance reforms in key institutions, including state-\nowned enterprises and the judiciary, among others. \n \nThe proposed program cluster forms an integral part of the governance \nreform  roadmap  and  will  help  further  the  reforms  through  capacity \nbuilding as well as mainstreaming measures. \n \nThe goal of GRP-II is to enhance accountability and efficiency of the \npublic  sector,  to  be  measured  by  fiscal  sustainability  and  tangible \nimprovements in delivery of key public services. The purpose of GRP-\nII, following the measures adopted under GRP on a pilot basis, is to \nsupport  the  gradual  implementation  of  public  sector  administrative \n\nfunding  agencies,  aims \n\nto  enhance \n\nto  (i) \n\nfiscal \n\n \nObjective and Scope  \n\n                                                 \n1 Loan 1713-MON: Governance Reform Program .  \n\n\f \n\niii \n\nand financial management reforms. GRP-II will adopt a three-pronged \napproach to the following:  \n \n(i) \n\nEnhance institutional capacity. \n \n(a) \n\nSupport  implementation  of  PSMFL-related  measures \non strategic planning and output-based budgeting, with \nfocus  on  health,  education,  and  social  welfare  and \nlabor. \nStrengthen \nimplementation \ninstitutional  and \narrangements  for  financial  governance  norms  in  the \npublic sector. \n\nthe \n\n  \n(ii) \n\nImprove fiscal sustainability. \n(a) \n\nInitiate pension reforms to alleviate fiscal pressures on \nthe budget stemming from the public pension system. \nInitiate  administrative  consolidation  to  reduce  multiple \nlayers  of  control  that  impede  efficiency  and  lead  to \nwaste of scarce resources. \n\n(iii)       Mainstream governance reforms.  \n\nEnhance \nthe  State \nthe  enforcement  capacity  of \nService  Council  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  civil \nservice. \nEnhance confidence in key public institutions. \n\n(b) \n\n(b) \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n \nGood governance, economic growth \n\n \nCategory  C.  Environmental  implications  were  reviewed,  and  no \nsignificant adverse environmental impacts identified. \n \n \nGRP-II adopts a cluster approach comprising subprograms 1 and 2. A \nloan  of  SDR9.699  million  (equivalent  to  $13.5  million)  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources will be provided for subprogram 1. The loan \nwill have a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and \nan  interest  charge  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5%  per  year  for  the  remaining  period.  A  loan  of  $10  million  is \nenvisaged for subprogram 2, to be designed and proposed separately \nfor  ADB\u2019s  consideration  upon  satisfactory \nimplementation  of \nsubprogram 1. \n \nSubprogram  1  will  be  implemented  from  October  2003  to  December \n2005,  while  the  program  framework  also  includes  a  number  of \nprogram  measures  have  been  implemented  since  September  2002, \nwhen GRP was completed. Subprogram 2 will be prepared after the \nmidterm review of subprogram 1. The loan for subprogram 2 will be \nin \npresented \n\nfor  ADB\u2019s  consideration,  based  on  progress \n\n \n\n \nPoverty Classification  Other \n \nThematic \nClassification \n \nEnvironmental \nAssessment \n \nThe Program Loan \n \n \n\nLoan   Amount \nand Terms \n\nProgram \nPeriod and Tranching \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nExecuting \nAgency \n\nProcurement \n\nCounterpart \nFunds \n\nThe Technical \nAssistance Loan \nLoan \n \nDescription \n \n\nin \n\nfor  ADB\u2019s  consideration,  based  on  progress \n\npresented \nimplementing in subprogram 1.  \n \nThe  resources  of  SDR9.699  million  under  subprogram  1  will  be \ndivided  into  two  tranches:  the  first,  for  subprogram  1,  for  SDR3.592 \nmillion  (equivalent  to  $5.000  million),  will  be  released  upon  approval \nof  GRP-II  by  ADB  and  loan  effectivity.  Subject  to  satisfactory \nfulfillment  of  all  the  second-tranche  release  conditions  in  the  policy \nmatrix  and  the  other  program  conditions  that  can  be  monitored,  the \nsecond  tranche  of  SDR6.107  million  (equivalent  to  $8.500  million)  is \nexpected to be released by July 2005. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economy  (MOFE)  will  be  the  executing \nagency  for  GRP-II  and  responsible  for  implementing  all  PSMFL-\nrelated  measures,  public  sector  financial  management  reforms,  and \nsocial  security  reforms.  The  Cabinet  Secretariat  (CS)  will  be  the \nimplementing agency for all the local government reform issues, civil \nservice  reforms,  and  the  anticorruption  component.  CS  will  also \nensure  Cabinet-level  coordination  to  implement  GRP-II  efficiently. \nThe  Government  has  established  a  GRP  program  implementation \nunit (PIU) under MOFE.  \n \nGiven  the  coverage  of  a  number  of  cross-sectoral  issues  and  the \ncomplexity  of  the  reforms,  the  Government  will  form  a  steering \ncommittee  and  an  operational  working  group  to  advise  and  support \nMOFE and CS. The steering committee will be led by the chief of CS \nand comprise the minister of finance and economy, minister of social \nwelfare  and  labor,  economic  advisor  to  the  prime  minister,  and  two \nthe  Parliamentary  Working  Group  on \nrepresentatives \nGovernance. The operational working group will be led by the deputy \nminister  of  finance  and  economy,  and  comprise  deputy  chief  of  the \nCS in charge of local government reforms, the heads of fiscal policy \nand accounting departments of MOFE, and head of administration of \nthe National Audit Office (NAO). \n \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs \nof items produced and procured in ADB member countries (other than \nitems  specified  in  the  negative  list  and  imports  financed  by  other \nbilateral  and  multilateral  agencies).  The  Government  will  certify  that \nthe  value  of  eligible  imports  exceeds  the  amount  of  ADB's  projected \ndisbursements under the loan for the given period. ADB reserves the \nright to audit the use of the loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of \nthe Government's certification. \n \nThe Program includes specific components that bear distinct costs of \nstructural adjustments. The counterpart funds to be generated out of \nthe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  cost  of  such  structural \nadjustments and high-priority development projects. \n \n\nfrom \n\nThe  proposed  TA  loan  for  CBGR  will  help  the  Government  enhance \nthe  key  governance-related \nits  overall  capacity \n\nimplement \n\nto \n\n\f \n\n \n\nDescription \n\nLoan   Amount \nand Terms \n\n \n\nExecuting \nAgency \n\nProcurement \n\n \nRisks and Safeguards \n\nv \n\nto \n\nimplement \n\nits  overall  capacity \nthe  key  governance-related \nmeasures  under  GRP-II,  including  on-the-job  training  programs  for \ngovernment accountants and auditors. The scope of CBGR will cover \nthe following: \n \n\n(i)  financial management reforms in public sector accounting, \n\nauditing, and asset valuation; \n\n(ii)  support  for  strategic  planning  in  relation  to  PSMFL \n\nimplementation; and  \n\n(iii) software  and \n\nto  efficiently \nlimited  hardware  support \nundertake financial statement and performance audits and \noutput costing. \n\nA  TA  loan  of  SDR1.437  million  ($2  million  equivalent)  for  CBGR  is \nproposed to be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years. The TA loan will \ncarry  an  interest  charge  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period \nand 1.5% per year for the remaining period. \n \nMOFE  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA  loan.  The  PIU \nestablished  for  GRP-II  will  also  coordinate  all  the  activities  under \nCBGR. CS will support interministerial coordination. \n \nThe  TA  loan  for  CBGR  will  involve  the  use  of  53  person-months of \ninternational consulting services, comprising the following: (i) advisor \nto the accountant general for 18 person-months; (ii) PSMFL strategic \nplanning  advisor  for  13  person-months;  (iii)  advisory  services  to  the \nNAO  for  18  person-months  through  a  team  of  two  international \nauditors,  who  will  work  with  six  NAO  auditors  to  implement  the \nrelevant  GRP-II  conditions;  (iv)  an  asset  valuation  expert  for  2 \nperson-months; (v) a management information systems (MIS) expert \nto  design  a  software  package  for  audits  and  provide  training  for  2 \nperson-months.  About  120  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nsupport  will  also  be  procured  in  the  above  areas,  including  project \nmanagement.  All  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  be \nrecruited  individually  in  accordance  with  quality-  and  cost-based \nprocedures, ADB\u2019s Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants, and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  the  ADB  for  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. \n \nInstitutional  reforms,  particularly  in  the  public  sector,  are  subject  to \nrisks.  As  GRP  has  set  the  overall  direction  of  reforms,  GRP-II  has \nfewer  risks.  However,  subprograms  1  and  2  are  likely  to  face  four \nspecific types of risk, for which the program has sufficient safeguards:  \n \n(i) PSMFL implementation may falter due to capacity constraints. The \nGovernment has thus adopted a gradual, learning-by-doing approach. \nADB  emphasizes  that  implementation  should  allow  for  mid-course \ncorrections.  Ongoing  TAs  and  the  proposed  TA  loan  for  CBGR  will \nprovide  significant  capacity-building  support  to  alleviate  capacity \nconstraints and to assuage the concerns of the civil servants. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nits  concept  paper  and  engages \n\nconstraints and to assuage the concerns of the civil servants. \n \n(ii) Pension reform anywhere is complex as it involves difficult policy \nchoices,  including  elimination  of  early  retirement  privileges,  which \nmay  affect  laborers  in  certain  industries.  However,  the  Government \nrecognizes that the pension system will have serious problems unless \nits generous provisions are changed. Significant advisory support has \nbeen provided to analyze various options, guided by sound actuarial \nmodeling.  The  Government  has  drafted  guidelines  to  gradually \nreduce  early  retirement  privileges.  GRP-II  will  support  wide  public \nconsultations,  education,  and  consensus  building  for  reforms  in  this \narea. \n \n(iii)  Administrative  consolidation  measures  carry  considerable  risks. \nThe  Government  has  undertaken  preliminary  analysis  and \nstakeholder  consultations.  However,  the  degree  of  acceptance  or \nresistance  to  reform  can  be  gauged  only  when  the  Government \nfinalizes \nin  well-structured \nconsultations with the local citizens\u2019  representative assemblies. The \nGovernment  is  optimistic  that  the  much-needed  reforms  can  be \nfacilitated if consolidation measures are designed gradually with local \ninputs. \n \n(iv) Some political risks are associated with a program of this nature. \nIn  particular,  as  Mongolia  will  hold  parliamentary  elections  in  mid-\n2004,  serious  reforms  may  not  be  carried  through.  Short-term \nconcerns  of \nin \nimplementing PSMFL, opposition to pension reforms, and resistance \nto administrative or structural changes may prevail over the need for \nreforms.  Two  factors  could  cushion  reform  against  the  political  risk. \nFirst,  the  Government  and  Parliament  have  been  fully  committed  to \npublic sector reforms. Despite a major change in the Government in \n2000,  reforms  were  implemented  smoothly.  Given  the  significant \npolitical  capital  and  financial  resources  invested,  it  is  also  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  and  Parliament\u2019s  best  interest  to  ensure  that  PSMFL-\nrelated reforms are irreversible. Second, the cluster program modality \ngives  the  Government  greater  flexibility  than  otherwise  possible  by \nproviding the overall program framework and a longer implementation \nperiod. \n\nlocal  governments  with  regard \n\nto  difficulties \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster concept for the Second Phase of the Governance Reform Program in Mongolia \n(GRP-II), (ii) proposed loan to Mongolia for subprogram 1 of GRP-II, and (iii) proposed technical \nassistance  (TA)  loan  for  capacity  building  for  governance  reforms  (CBGR)  to  support  the \nimplementation of subprogram 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \n2. \nUnlike  other  transition  economies  in  East  and  Central  Asia,  Mongolia  managed  its \ntransition  well  until  the  mid-1990s.  Output  decline  in  the  early  years  of  the  transition  was \nreversed in only 4 years, and real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 1% in 1994, and 6% in \n1995.  Inflation  declined  significantly  and  fiscal  deficit  was  brought  down  from  13%  of  GDP  in \n1990 to 7% by 1995. However, the initial gains were not sustained due to various constraints, \nprimarily  lack  of  economic  diversification,  with  heavy  reliance  on  livestock  and  copper \nproduction. Central and local fiscal discipline was also lacking, which led to a build up of on- and \noff-budget  expenditures.  Economic  performance  thus  deteriorated  in  the  second  half  of  the \n1990s, with GDP growth declining from 4% in 1997 to just over 1% in 2000 and 2001. The fiscal \ndeficit increased to 8% of GDP in 1996 and further to 14% of GDP in 1998.  \n \n3. \nFiscal  profligacy  in  the  mid-1990s  was  exacerbated  by  a  variety  of  factors,  including \n(i) weak budget management, reporting, and control frameworks, resulting in inadequate checks \nand  balances;  (ii)  full  devolution  of  expenditure  responsibilities  to  lower  tiers  of  government \nwithout  adequate  accountability;  (iii)  weak  revenue  administration;  (iv)  inadequate  treasury \ncontrols;  (v) weak  political  will  and  bureaucratic  commitment  to  maintaining  overall  fiscal \ndiscipline;  and  (vi)  weak  operational  and  financial  practices adopted by budgetary bodies and \nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs). \n \n4. \nAgainst  this  background,  in  1998  the  Government  sought  ADB\u2019s  support  through  the \nGovernance  Reform  Program  (GRP)2  to  strengthen  public  sector  administration  and  financial \nmanagement. As part of GRP, a 10-year governance reform roadmap was formulated to guide \ngovernance reforms in 1999-2009, with initial implementation support provided on a pilot basis \nunder  the  program  in  1999-2002.  GRP  aimed  to  facilitate  the  transition  to a new structure by \nestablishing  systems  for  sound  public  sector  financial  management  and  accountability  and \ntransparent  data  and  for  information  dissemination.  GRP  thus  focused  on  (i)  improving \naggregate  fiscal  discipline,  (ii)  strengthening  public  sector  budget  formulation  and  execution, \n(iii) enhancing  operational  efficiency  within  the  public  sector,  (iv)  addressing  the  social  impact \nand  financing  needs  of  sector  reforms,  and  (v)  preparing  the  groundwork  for  continuation  of \nreforms. The enactment of the Public Sector Management Finance Law (PSMFL) in June 2002, \nafter  extensive  consultations  in  1997-2002,  was  the  most  important  milestone  of  GRP  as  a \nprogram-end  condition.  PSMFL3  has  placed  Mongolia  ahead  of  the  other  countries  that  have \nintroduced  new  public  sector  management  approaches  but  in  the  absence  of  a  sound  legal \nframework. \n \n5. \nGRP  introduced  reforms  in  strategic  planning,  output  specification,  and  performance \nmanagement, first in five major public service agencies (bunch-1 entities): General Department \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB. 1999.

Based on a review \nof government progress in the bunch-1 agencies, GRP also phased in basic reform measures in \n11 ministries and agencies and two provinces5 with ADB TA support.6 As GRP was envisaged \nas  a  pilot  program,  the  Government  did  not  aim  for  any  structural  changes  in  central  or  local \npublic administration in the first phase.  \n \nWhile  GRP  has  laid  a  sound  foundation  to  guide  public  sector  administration  and \n6. \nfinancial management reforms in Mongolia, a formidable reform agenda remains to be fulfilled. \nIn particular, effective implementation of PSMFL is highly critical to ensure that reforms do not \nfail. The public sector remains large and inefficient, and risks significant fiscal instability. While the \nconstitutional  and  political  structure  have  conferred  significant  administrative  autonomy  to  the \nlocal governments, most local governments, except for three provinces, have relied heavily on \ntransfers  from  the  central  Government  for  more  than  60%  of  their  revenue  needs.  However, \nPSMFL  gives  local  governments  the  flexibility  to  make  expenditure  decisions.  Effective  from 1 \nJanuary 2003, PSMFL calls for fiscal responsibility, accountability, and transparency at all levels\u2014\noutcomes that require time and persistent reforms. \n \n7. \nA 10-year reform roadmap has been adopted  in recognition of the complexity of budget, \noutput, and performance management reforms. While the introduction of output and performance \nmanagement  reforms  was  relatively  easier  for  bunch-1  agencies  due  to  their  well-defined \nfunctions  and  outputs,  reforms  in  line  ministries  and  other  budgetary  agencies have yet to gain \nmomentum.  The  line  ministries  have  to  implement  PSMFL  in  their  agreements  with  local \ngovernments to deliver public services. The central Government should link policy priorities with \nmeasurable  outputs.  Line  ministries  should  strengthen  their  planning,  internal  control,  and \nmonitoring  functions  so  that  local  authorities\u2019  outputs  can  be  evaluated.  Local  authorities,  in \nturn,  should  clearly  articulate  their  local  development  needs  and  ensure  that  they  are \nadequately reflected in national priorities through output agreements. \n \nThe proposed program cluster builds on GRP reforms and the lessons learned.7 PSMFL-\n8. \nrelated measures must be mainstreamed gradually at all levels of the public sector in appropriate \nsequence: (i) PSMFL has clarified the relative functions, roles, and responsibilities of governments \nat different levels; (ii) capacity constraints need to be addressed; (iii) the implementation process \nshould  recognize  such  constraints  and  adopt  a  learning-by-doing  approach;  (iv)  civil  service \nreforms  need  to  be  launched;  and  (v)  structural  constraints,  including  multiple  levels  of  public \nadministration,  need  to  be  removed  gradually.  The  program  cluster  aims  to  support  the \nGovernment through the second phase of reforms, building on  lessons learned from the design \nand implementation of the initial phase of reforms under GRP.  \n \n\n                                                 \n4   NAO used to be the State Audit and Inspection Committee. \n5   These include Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE); Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor (MSWL); Ministry of \nJustice  and  Home  Affairs;  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture,  and  Science  (MOSTEC);  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH); \nMinistry  of  Environment;  State  Financial  Inspection  Department;  Environmental  Protection  Agency;  Land \nAdministrative Authority; State Meteorological Agency; and Clinical Hospital No.1. GRP also focused on two pilot \nprovinces ,  Arhangi  and  Selenge;  and  on  Nalaikh  District  Administration,  a  jurisdiction  within  Ulaanbaatar  City,  to \npilot-test provincial and subprovincial administrative reforms. \n\n6   Appendix  1  presents  information  on  TA  support.  Under  TA  3316-MON:  Initial  Phase  of  Public  Administration \nReforms, a team of domestic experts was trained by the international consultants in international best practices in \npublic sector resource management. Since then, the team has been implementing reforms.  \n\n7   Section IV, subsection B, outlines of lessons learned from GRP. The program completion report for GRP \n\n(December 2002) presents additional details. \n\n\f3 \n\nIII. \n\nRECENT MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS \n\n \n9. \nIn accordance with the GRP, and in line with the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility \n(PRGF)  of  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  the  budgets  for  1999  and  2000  aimed  to \nreduce deficit levels. The budget deficit declined from 12.2% of GDP in 1999 to 6.8% in 2000 \nand  5.3%  in  2001,  which  is  impressive  given  the  expenditure  overruns  due  to  the  dzud (dry \nsummer  followed  by  harsh  winter)  in  those  years.  Improved  collection  of  tax  and  non-tax \nrevenues and a 2.0% increase in value-added taxes and import taxes on energy inputs helped \nraise the revenue-GDP ratio from 27.2% in 1999 to 38.0% in 2001. The recovery in international \ngold prices also helped compensate for expenditure overruns. \n \n10. \nEconomic prospects improved in 2002 after 2 years of stagnation. Despite the continuing \nlow  world  prices  for  copper  and  cashmere,  Mongolia\u2019s  key  exports,  real  GDP  registered 3.9% \ngrowth in 2002. Inflation slowed considerably to 1.6% in 2002, against 8.0% in 2001. However, \nthe  Government,  in  line  with  the  promises  made  in  2000  to  increase  civil  service  wages  and \npensions,  announced  a  20%  rise  in  wages  and  pensions  effective  1  October  2002,  which \npushed  current  expenditure  up  by  as  much  as  1%  of  GDP.  The  Government  and  IMF  had \nestimated that this measure would increase the fiscal deficit to 7.0\u20138.0% significantly above the \n6.5% target under PRGF. With World Bank support, the  Government then embarked on social \nsector  privatization  and  civil  service  reforms.  To  stay  within  the  established  expenditure  and \nrevenue  targets,  an  extraordinary  session  of  Parliament  revised  the  budget  in  August  2002. \nThese efforts, combined with higher-than-expected revenue collection attributable to the sale of \nthe Trade and Development Bank, helped contain the fiscal deficit at 5.6% of GDP. The deficit is \nforecast at 6.1% for 2003, also below the PRGF target. \n \n11. \nSince  the  early  1990s  poverty  reduction  has  been  the  single  most  complex  challenge \nfacing Mongolia. The collapse of the command system led to a general deterioration in access \nto  as  well  as  quality  of  public  services.  The  latest  poverty  figures  are  from  the  1998  living \nstandards  measurement  survey.  While  income  inequality  widened  over  1995-1998,  poverty \nincidence  changed  marginally  from  36.3%  in  1995  to  35.6%  in  1998.  Urban  poverty  is  more \nsevere,  with  poverty  incidence  measured  at  39.4%  in  1998.  Environmental  factors,  including \nfrequent harsh winters, overgrazing of pastures, and weak natural resource management, have \nalso increased household vulnerability to economic shocks.  \n \n12. \nIMF approved the ongoing 3-year PRGF in September 2001 for SDR29 million. The first \nannual review, scheduled for 2002, was not conclusive due to fiscal concerns with regard to the \nincrease in civil service wages. Following the budgetary amendments in August 2002, IMF and \nthe  Government  reached  an  understanding  on  the  fiscal  issues  in  December  2002.  However, \nslippage  in  monetary  targets  coupled  with  the  Bank  of  Mongolia  (BOM)  extending  two  loan \nguarantees  to  private  sector  entities  has  delayed  the  PRGF  release.  IMF  has  formulated  a \nnumber  of  corrective  measures  that  BOM  is  implementing:  (i)  a  clear  policy relinquishing any \nBOM  loan  guarantees  to  the  private  sector,  (ii)  completion  of  a  special  audit  of  BOM\u2019s  net \ninternational reserves at the end of 2002, and (iii) amendments to the Law on the Central Bank \nto  improve  governance  in  BOM.  Subject  to  satisfactory  progress  on  these  fronts,  IMF  is \nexpected to release the pending tranches in the third quarter of 2003. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\n1. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PUBLIC SECTOR8 \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n \n\nOverall Public Sector\u2014Public Administration and Key Fiscal Pressures \n\n13.  Mongolia is one of the least densely populated countries in the world, with 2.45 million \npeople living across 1.6 million square kilometers. The country is divided into 21 provinces and \nthe Ulaanbaataar capital city administration. The 21 provinces are subdivided into 331 districts; \nUlaanbaataar is subdivided into 9 districts. The districts, in turn, are organized as 1,634 villages, \nwhich provide services at the lowest tiers of government. At the central level, 11 ministries, 17 \nregulatory  agencies,  and  30  implementing  agencies  formulate  policy  and  administer  central \nfunctions.9  Five  agencies  report  directly  to  Parliament:  NAO,  SSC,  NSO,  BOM,  and  Securities \nand Exchange Commission. There are close to 6,000 budgetary bodies, including schools and \nhospitals. There are 110 SOEs, with 51% or more of state ownership, which also come under \nthe purview of PSMFL. \n \n14.  Measured  by  expenditure,  the  government  sector  is  larger  than  in  other  comparable \ntransition  economies.  Consolidated  government  expenditure  as  a  share of GDP has averaged \nat around 39% per year in 1993-2000.10 Current expenditures dominate, rising from 57% of total \ngovernment expenditures in early 1990s to around 70% in 2000. In particular, the public sector \nwage bill as a share of GDP, at 8.2% in 2000, is among the highest in region,11 amounting to \n20%  of  total  expenditures.  Tax  administration  reforms  over  the  last  few  years  have  led  to  a \nsurge in overall government revenue from 25.6% of GDP in 1995 to 38.0% in 2001. However, \ntax rates are high: corporate and personal income tax rates can go up to 40%. As a result, tax \nrevenue as a share of GDP stands at 29%, much higher than in comparable Asian economies. \n \nAt  the  end  of  2000  the  public  sector  had  166,700  employees,  of  whom  135,400  were \n15. \nbudgeted  positions  in  the  state  budgetary  bodies,  while  actual  employment  was  116,400, \nindicating a vacancy rate of about 16%. Government service is political (including members of \nParliament, heads of governments at different levels, and heads and staff in foreign missions); \nadministrative;  special  (heads  of  courts,  senior  officers  of  the  armed  forces,  and  heads  of \nagencies reporting to Parliament, etc.); and support (education, health, and other government-\naffiliated  organizations).  In  2001  political  service  accounted  for  1.9%  of  all  government \npositions; administrative service, 5.6%; special service, 21.3%; and support service, 71.2%.  \n \n16. \nThe  public  administration  system  faces  a  number  of  challenges.  Simply  stated,  the \npublic  sector  is  unviable.  Constraints  range  from  organizational  problems  resulting  in  lack  of \ntransparency and poor accountability, to the terrain, which imposes unique constraints on public \nservice  delivery.  The  lack  of  fiscal  responsibility  and  budgetary  discipline  is  mainly  due  to  the \nlarge  public  sector.  There  is  one  public  sector  agency  for  every  350  people.  While  the \n\n                                                 \n8   More  information  on  the  sector  and  its  key  issues  and  challenges  is  in  ADB.  2003.  Governance:  Progress  and \n\nChallenges in Mongolia. (Draft). \n\n9  Of  the  11  ministries,  3  (finance  and  economy,  foreign  affairs,  and    justice  and  home  affairs)  perform  central \nmanagement functions. The rest are line ministries: MOSTEC, MOH, MSWL, environment, defense, infrastructure, \ntrade and industry, and food and agriculture. \n\n10  Uzbekistan  has  had  a  higher  share  over  the  same  period,  while  Kazakhstan,  Bulgaria,  Latvia,  and  Romania, \n\namong others, have had lower shares. \n\n11 For instance, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan have had ratios of less than 5%, and the average for a \n\nset of comparable transition economies stood at just over 6%. \n\n\f5 \n\nGovernment  adopted  various  decentralization  measures  in  1995  to  improve  public  service \ndelivery,  the  public  sector\u2019s  size  has  curtailed  the  benefits  of  decentralization,  given  the \nmultiplicity  of  agencies  performing  similar  tasks.  Besides  administrative  weaknesses,  lack  of \ntechnical skills has been a recurring concern. With regard to the new budget and output-based \nmanagement  reforms,  a  key  weakness  is  the  lack  of  understanding  and  ability  to  define  and \ncost outputs, and to link sector policies with specific measurable outputs and outcomes that can \nbe  monitored.  This  may  be  a  key  constraint  impeding  the  formulation  of  sectoral  budgetary \nappropriations on output basis, which is a requirement under PSMFL. \n \n17. \nIntergovernmental  Fiscal  Relations.  Fiscal  relations  between  the  central  and  local \ngovernments have gone through significant changes over the last decade. In 1990 the share of \nlocal  expenditures  to  general  government  expenditures  stood  at  49.4%,  before  declining  to \n24.4% in 1994. In the mid-1990s the central Government allowed local governments to exercise \nincreasing responsibilities to focus on attaining overall macroeconomic stability. As a result, the \nshare  of  local  in  general  government  expenditures  increased  to  35.8%  in  1995,  but  later \ndeclined  to  29.3%  in  2001.  Over  the  same  period,  the  share  of  local  government  revenue  to \ngeneral  government  revenue  has  also  declined,  from  43.5%  in  1990  to  18.4%  in  2001.  In \nnominal terms, local public sector wage and salary costs increased 10-fold from MNT6.5 million \nin 1993 to MNT66.0 million in 2000, while expenditures on goods and services grew 5-fold from \nMNT13 million to MNT61 million. Overall, local government expenditures have grown from 9.7% \nof GDP in 1995 to 13.0% in 2000, although they are expected to come down to 10.9% in 2002. \n \n18. \nExpenditures  and  revenue  collections  vary  greatly  across  the  provinces:  per  capita \nrevenue  collections  ranged  from  MNT21,000  ($19.00)  in  Bayanulgii  to  MNT70,028  ($63.80)  in \nOrkhon in 2002, or a ratio of almost 4 to 1, although it reflects an improvement over 1999 when \nthe ratio was 8 to 1. Per capita expenditures ranged from MNT51,947 ($47.20) in Uvurkhangai \nto MNT104,626 ($95.10) in Gobisumber, a ratio of 2 to 1. The extent of provinces\u2019 dependence \non  the  center  is  evident  from  ratios  of  local  government  expenditure  to  revenue.  In  2002  the \nratio  stood  at  1.64  for  all  provinces,  and  at  2.20,  excluding  Ulaanbaataar.  Only  two  provinces \n(Ulaanbaataar administration and Orkhon province) were net providers of revenue to the center, \nwhile  all  the  others  relied  on  net  transfers  and  subsidies  for  more  than  60%  of  their  public \nexpenditures.  Education  and  health  have  historically  been  the  most  decentralized  sectors, \nwhere local governments have spent 70% and 63%, respectively, of the total expenditure.  \n \n19. \nUntil the end of 2002, provincial  governors negotiated their budgets directly with Ministry \nof  Finance  and  Economy  (MOFE)  to secure the release of funds. District governors dealt with \nthe provincial governors for budgetary transfers. Under PSMFL, the line ministers will enter into \noutput purchase agreements with  province  governors  for  all  service  delivery,  including  health \nand  education,  and  the  budgetary  allocations  will  be  determined  on  the  basis  of  output  costs. \nHowever,  entity  capacity  constraints  on  performance  contracting  are  more  prevalent  at  lower \ngovernment levels. These constraints need to be placed in the broader context of a number of \nother structural impediments at the  provincial  and  subprovincial  levels,  including  the  following: \n(i)  continuing  tension  between  the  center  and  provinces  arising  from  disparities  between \nexpenditure responsibilities and limited decision-making authority devolved to the lower levels, \nand the resulting conflicts between self-governance and state control from the center; (ii) limited \nprovincial and district revenue-raising capacities; and (iii) multiplicity of administrative layers at \nprovincial,  district,  and  bagh  levels,  which  add  to  significant  public  administration  costs, \nincreased bureaucracy, as well as weak accountability. \n \n20. \nCivil Service. Capacity constraints on performance and output-based management are \nexacerbated by fundamental problems faced by the civil service: (i) capacity constraints within \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nSSC  to  formulate  and  enforce  sound  guidelines  on  recruitment  and  performance-based \nmanagement; (ii) lack of transparency in hiring or firing civil servants; (iii) lack of a civil service \nculture,  wherein  a  permanent,  merit-based,  career-track  civil  service  system  has  not  been \nestablished yet; (iv) frequent staff turnover, particularly at senior levels, caused by past frequent \nchanges  in  the  Government;  (v)  lack  of  political  neutrality  of  the  civil  service;  (vi)  widespread \nviolations of merit principles in recruitment or career progression; and (vii) lack of sound dispute \nresolution  or  administrative  grievance  settlement  processes.  Meritocracy  is  a  difficult  goal  to \nachieve under the current circumstances. \n \n21. \nThe largeness of the public sector has led to wage compression in the civil service and \nfrequently  put  significant  pressure  on  the  budget  despite  lower  average  wages  than  in  the \nprivate sector. The monthly per capita wage in the public sector was $52 in 2001, as against the \nnational average of $67. A comprehensive functional review of the core and non-core functions \nof  the  public  sector  needs  to  be  launched  to  guide  future  reforms.  While  the Government has \nformulated some short-run measures, including the social sector privatization program announced \nin  July  2002,  to  corporatize  and  privatize  or  restructure  56  selected  educational  institutions  and \nhospital facilities to contain public expenditures, the impact of such measures in isolation of other \nmedium- to long-term qualitative improvements is likely to be small. \n \nFiscal  Pressures  from  the  Pension  System.  The  public  pension  system  is  a  major \n22. \nsource of fiscal pressure. Pension expenditure as a share of GDP increased from 0.5% in 1990 to \n5.9%  in  2001,  which  is  much  higher  than  in  the  regional  average.12  In  view  of  the  fiscal \nsustainability  problems \ntransition  economies  with  pay-as-you-go  pension \narrangements,  Mongolia  adopted  a  legal  framework  in  1999  based  entirely  on  individual \ncontributions, applying only to those born after 1960, and to become effective from 2010. Given \nthe  transition  costs  involved,  notional  balances  are  recorded  in  individuals\u2019  accounts.  The \nGovernment\u2019s plan is to convert a portion of the notional accounts into funded privately managed \naccounts,  on  the  assumption  that  the  pension  system  will  begin  to  run  a  surplus  by  2005. \nHowever, the overall system is in deficit, estimated at 1.6% of GDP.  \n \n23. \nThe  pension  system  is  fairly generous.  A  retiree  gets  45.0%  of  the  highest  5  years  of \nwages,  in  addition  to  a  1.5%  additional  credit  for  each  year  of  service  over  20  years.  The \naverage  replacement  rate  stands  at  65%  of  average  wage,  which  represents  almost  a  100% \nreplacement  rate  as  pension  benefits  are  not  taxed.  However,  until  the  mid-1990s,  the  real \nvalue of wages and pensions remained low because of significantly high inflation. There is no \ngood mechanism for indexation. For instance, pensions were not adjusted for inflation  in 2000, \nbut were increased by about 10% in 2001. \n \n24. \n While the retirement age is 60 for men and 55 for women, the actual average retirement \nages are 57 and 50, respectively. Only a quarter of the pensioners are 60 when they begin to \nreceive  pension  benefits.  The  ratio  of  pensioners  to  population  above  60  years  is  close  to  2, \nindicating significant early retirements. Life expectancy at the actual average retirement ages is \n20  years  for  women  and  14  years  for  men.  With  the  generous  early  retirement provisions, \nretirees  do  remain  economically  active  yet  receive  pensions.  An  indication  of  these  negative \npressures on the pension system is the forecast financial position of the pension fund. Without \nany transfers from the budget and any reform measures to increase the average retirement age, \nthe pension fund will be in deficit to the tune of about 9.0% of GDP by 2005, rising to 16.4% by \n2010, and 34.4% by 2020.  \n\nin  all \n\nfaced \n\n                                                 \n12 For example, the ratio is less than 1.5% of GDP in Kazakhstan and 2.6% in the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\n\f7 \n\n2. \n\nFramework for Financial Management and Governance  \n\n \n25. \nThe  Law  on  Accounting,  amended  in  2002,  is  based  on  international  accounting \nstandards (IAS) and covers private sector as well as public sector entities, including budgetary \nbodies. The law provides for an accounting standards committee to set private and public sector \naccounting standards and monitor their implementation. As per the law, the minister of finance \nand  economy  must  provide  implementation  directions  to  the  accounting  profession.  MOFE  is \nresponsible  for  the  final  reconciliation  and  consolidation  of  all  public  sector  budget  accounts, \nincluding those of central and local governments. The state property committee consolidates the \naccounts of SOEs separately, outside the budget. \n \n26.  With  regard  to  public  sector  accounting,  the  budget  classification  system  is  broadly \nconsistent  with  internationally  accepted  government  finance  statistics  principles.  The  budget \nsummarizes the financial position of the Government on a cash basis. With World Bank support, \na  new  chart  of  accounts  has  been  developed  for  the  Government,  based  on  accounting \nstandards  that  are  conducive  to  cash  and  accrual  bases.  GRP  helped  five  bunch-1  pilot \nagencies\u2014GDNT,  CGA,  SSC,  NSO,  and  NAO\u2014convert  to  accrual  accounting.  This  process \nneeds to be expanded across the public sector. \n \nThe State Audit Law, amended in 2003, provides the basic legal framework for financial \n27. \nand performance audit of all budgetary bodies. NAO, the supreme audit institution, implements \nthe  law.  Parliament  appoints  the  chair  of  NAO,  who,  in  turn,  appoints  the  heads  of  NAO\u2019s  22 \nprovincial  boards.  The  chair  and  heads  report  to  and  are  directly  accountable  to  the  local \nassemblies.  As  per  PSMFL,  NAO,  which  has  275  staff  at  central  and  local  levels,  conducts \ncertification audits of the annual financial statements of all budgetary bodies and majority SOEs. \nThe Law on State Inspection, amended in 2003, guides the activities of the State Professional \nInspection  Agency  (SPIA),  which  was  established  under  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office  in  early \n2003  by  merging  all  the  inspection  agencies  in  various  line  ministries.  In  particular,  financial \ninspection of budgetary bodies is the core of SPIA\u2019s activities, a task previously carried out by \nthe State Financial Inspection Agency, which operated under MOFE. SPIA\u2019s finance and control \ndivision,  which  PSMFL  entrusts  with  internal  financial  inspection  of  the  Government,  has  250 \ninspectors. \n \n28. \nThree key organizations are involved in private sector accounting and auditing and have \noverlapping  roles  and  responsibilities:  Accounting  Policy,  Methodology,  and  Auditing \nDepartment  of  MOFE;  Mongolian  Institute  of  Certified  Public  Accountants  (MICPA);  and \nMongolian  Professional  Accounting  Council  (MPAC).  MPAC  was  established  by  the  Law  on \nAccounting  to  license  accounting  firms  and  strengthen  and  regulate the accounting profession \nby performing the following functions: (i) recommend standards for accounting and auditing; (ii) \nreview the curricula for the certified public accountant (CPA) examinations, and provide courses \nfor candidates preparing for the exams; (iii) formulate and conduct CPA exams, and grant and \nrecord CPA certificates; (iv) process and review auditing licenses and make recommendations \nto the minister; (v) maintain a database on auditing companies; and (vi) formulate and ensure \nconformity with codes of professional ethics. \n \n29. \nUnder  PSMFL,  all  budget  entities  are  required  to  generate  accrual-based  financial \nstatements that are prepared in line with the international public sector accounting standards by \nthe  end  of  2003.  PSMFL  also  requires  MOFE  to  consolidate  these  financial  statements  to \nprepare  overall  financial  statements  for  the  Government.  Budget  entities  are  responsible  for \naccounting  and  financial  reporting  as  well  as  financial  management  of  their  budget  funds. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nCentralized accounting systems and uniform chart of accounts are absent, and reports prepared \nby  budget  entities  are  in  a  multi-sheet  form  submitted  to  MOFE  monthly  and  quarterly.  These \nreports are not required to reconcile changes between the beginning and ending balances of a \nspecific period. Treasury consolidates these reports to produce government-wide reports, which \nmay not be accurate. \n \n30. \nPSMFL  provides  for  an  independent  role  for  budget  entities  by  promoting  entity-based \nfinancial  management.  Under  this  structure,  internal  control  is  important.  However,  neither \nMOFE  nor  the  line  ministries  nor  other  budgetary  bodies  have  any  internal  audit  function  to \ncarry out these responsibilities. The usefulness of internal audit functions is not well understood. \nWhile financial inspectors act as internal auditors of central budget governors at budget entities, \nthe  scope  of  work  of  these  inspectors  is  limited  to  inspection  of  certain  documents.  Central \nbudget governors generally appoint financial inspectors, and each central budget governor has \none or two financial inspectors on their payroll. Each line ministry also has its own inspection, \nmonitoring,  and  evaluation  division,  which  monitors  compliance  with  sector  laws  and \nregulations.  However,  most  divisions  have  no  qualified finance specialist or accountant, since \ntheir role is primarily to undertake compliance inspections for the ministries. \n \n31. \nDuplication  of  functions,  weak  auditing  and  accounting  procedures,  and  overall  poor \ncapacity in MOFE, line ministries, budgetary bodies, SPIA, and NAO are some of the problems \nin implementing PSMFL, which requires effective and credible rules along with well-functioning \ninformation systems to improve weak financial management. Almost all private and public sector \naccounting is done on a cash basis. While budgetary bodies present accounting information that \nis relevant for accrual accounting, including data on inventory, fixed assets, accounts payables \nand receivables, etc., all such information is lumped together without any analysis by separate \nasset classes. For fixed assets, data are maintained for information purposes only by recording \nthem at their historical cost. There are no standards for asset revaluation to reflect their present \nvalue on the financial statements required by PSMFL.  \n \n32. \nDespite the adoption of the Law on Accounting, which mandates IAS, progress has been \nseverely constrained due to lack of skills and capacity. In most cases, old systems are in place \nand  entries  are  simply  transposed  onto  the  new  IAS-compliant  financial  statements.  In \nparticular,  asset  valuation,  expense  recognition,  and  accounting  for  equity  have  significant \nproblems. While all enterprises have made some changes from the uniform accounting system, \nonly  a  few  accountants  have  a  reasonable  understanding  of  IAS  and  how  to  apply  them. \nAlthough  accounting  specialists  of  MOFE  are  to  oversee  the  quality  of  accounting  in  private \nenterprises in various  provinces  and  districts , such specialists only verify that financial reports \nhave  been  filed  in  the  correct  format,  and  do  not  examine  the  source  material  for  correct \ntreatment. \n \nB. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \n\n33. \nIn  formulating  the  proposed  program  cluster,  specific  attention  has  been  paid  to \nincorporating  lessons  learned  from  GRP  and  related  TAs  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  evaluation  on \nprogram lending. The GRP-II design is based on the following lessons: \n\n \n(i) \n\nPerformance-based  management \nreforms  have  generally  not  been \nsuccessful.  A key lesson from the evaluation of ADB\u2019s support for public sector \nreforms  in  the  Pacific  countries  is  that  performance-based management has not \nsucceeded. While this has been due to the complexity of such reforms, Mongolia \n\n\f9 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nhas  the  advantage  of  having  PSMFL  and  a  history  of  acute  fiscal  problems \nrequiring  change.  The  Government  and  Parliament  have  demonstrated  strong \ncommitment  in  designing  the  overall  program.  Significant  support  from  funding \nagencies is envisaged for capacity building and policy reforms. \nProper sequencing of reforms is critical. GRP-II will adopt a gradual, learning-\nby-doing approach. The program cluster envisages implementation over 6 years, \nfrom  2003  to  2009.  GRP-II  will  (a)  focus  on  PSMFL-related  training,  (b)  help \ninstitutionalize  financial  management  reforms,  (c)  initiate  measures  to  increase \nfiscal stability,  and  (d)  mainstream  reforms  in  key  public  institutions.  GRP-II will \ntarget full integration of PSMFL-related measures in education, health and social \nwelfare, and labor, which together constitute close to 75% of the overall budget. \nStakeholder  participation  is  vital.  The  success  in  adopting  PSMFL  and \nimplementing the pilot phase has demonstrated the need for close and significant \nstakeholder  involvement.  GRP-II  will  build  on  this  to  introduce  forward-looking \nreforms  based  on  stakeholder  consultations \nin  social  security  reforms, \nadministrative consolidation, and anticorruption work. \nLocal  government  autonomy  and  public  sector  efficiency  should  be \nbalanced. The learning-by-doing approach and the cluster modality are intended \nto  suggest  mid-course  corrections.  The  implementation  of  subprogram  1  will \nguide the level of flexibility between the central and local budgetary bodies. \n \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\nC. \n  \n34.  Although GRP was implemented as a pilot phase, the adoption of PSMFL and support by \nthe  Government  and  Parliament  for  a  comprehensive  fiscal  responsibility  system  are  good \nindicators of their commitment to long-term reforms. ADB and other aid agencies must coordinate \ntheir  support  for  the  reform  momentum  established  under  GRP  to  ensure  that  reforms stay on \ncourse  and  that  good  governance  norms  are  fully  mainstreamed  through  capacity  building  and \nstructural reforms. \n \n35. \nRationale  and  Links  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and \nProgram.  Governance  reform  in  general  and  strengthening  of  public  sector  governance  in \nparticular  are  a  key  pillar  of  ADB\u2019s  country  operational  strategy.  It  calls  for  (i)  strengthening  of \nfiscal discipline and strategic planning in the public sector; (ii) introduction of performance-based \nmanagement at central and local levels; (iii) infusion of transparent and efficient practices to guide \nintergovernmental  fiscal  and  administrative  relations;  (iv)  support  for  SOE  reforms;  and \n(v) formulation  of  effective  interlinkages  between  public  sector  governance  reforms  and  ADB\u2019s \nother  sector-specific  interventions,  which,  in  turn,  will  lead  to  enhanced  accountability  and \ntransparency in those sectors. \n \nADB has provided significant TA support over the last 5 years to formulate and implement \n36. \npublic  sector  governance  reforms.  A  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  overall  governance \nframework, issues, challenges, and opportunities is being finalized. ADB has been the lead donor \nfor  health,  education,  and  social  security  reforms.  Appendix  1  presents  a  list  of ADB TAs and \nloans for broad public sector reforms. The Government has sought continuing ADB support for \nGRP-II.  The  program  cluster  builds  on  the  reform  initiatives  launched  under  GRP  to  ensure  the \nstability and sustainability of PSMFL-related measures.  \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector and Donor Coordination \n\nD. \n \n37.  While  GRP  was  the  first  program  of  support  from  an  international  financial  institution  for \ngovernance  reforms,  IMF,  World  Bank,  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  and \nbilateral  agencies  have  supported  public  sector  management  reforms  (Appendix  1).  IMF  has \nfocused on overall macroeconomic stability to ensure fiscal sustainability, advising on treasury, \nbudget  management,  tax,  and  customs  reforms.  The  treasury  single  account system has been \nestablished with IMF\u2019s support. \n \n38.  World Bank\u2019s support for public administration reforms was initiated through the fiscal TA \nproject,  approved  in  1998  for  $5  million,  to  support  debt  management,  tax  administration,  and \ntreasury  reforms.  The  project  also  supported  a  major  public  expenditure  and  financial \nmanagement  review  in  2001,  which  was  finalized  in  July  2002.  The  review,  undertaken \nconcurrently  by  the  Government  with  the  formulation  of  the  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper \n(PRSP),  identified  a  number  of  constraints  on,  and  weaknesses  faced  by,  the  public  sector. \nBased on the review, and to support PRSP implementation, the World Bank plans to formulate \nthree  poverty  reduction  strategy  credits  (PRSCs)  in  2003-2007.  The  PRSCs\u2019  objective  is  to \ndevelop  and  implement  policies  and  structural  reforms  consistent  with  and  supportive  of  the \noverall  economic  development  strategy  in  a  sequenced  and  phased  manner.  PRSC1  is  being \nproposed for $15 million, likely to be approved by October 2003. The sequence of PRSCs will \nbe  as  follows:  (i)  PRSC1  will  support  public  sector  reforms  to  achieve  macro-fiscal stability; \n(ii) PRSC2  will  focus  on  private  and  real  sector  reform  and  help  create  an  environment  for \nfavorable growth; and (iii) PRSC3 will support social sector reforms and improve access to, and \nthe quality and cost of providing, public services.  \n \n39. \nThe  World  Bank  has  also  designed  the  Economic  Capacity-Building  Technical \nAssistance Credit (ECTAC), for $8 million, to support PRSC implementation. ECTAC will focus \non  public  expenditure  management  reforms,  including  budget  formulation,  execution,  and \nreporting;  measures  to  enhance  accountability;  and  policy  evaluation.  ECTAC  will  also  help \nSSC build its capacity in wage management and establish internal controls in the civil service. \nUNDP has provided advisory support under the Good Governance for Human Security (GGHS) \nProgram  and  also  led  coordination  of  donor  support  for  the  Government\u2019s  anticorruption \nmeasures  through  the  National  Council  on  Anticorruption,  headed  by  the  prime  minister.  The \nGovernment  of  Sweden  is  advising  the  Government  on  local  government  capacity  building  to \nstrengthen  organizational  management.  The  United  States  Agency \nInternational \nDevelopment (USAID) has supported court system reforms. \n \n40. \nGRP  implementation  and  the  consultative  process  leading  to  the  adoption  of  PSMFL \nhave proved as useful windows for coordination between ADB and other funding agencies. The \ndivision  of  labor,  as  it  has  evolved  with  the  World  Bank  and  IMF,  entails  ADB  coordinating \nPSMFL  implementation.  The  PRSCs  and  PRGF  will  help  formulate  and  adopt  MTEF  and \nstreamline  budget  processes.  PRSC1  will  aim  at  short-run  civil  service  reform  measures, \nincluding  design  of  a  database  of  civil  servants  and  adoption  of  a  coherent  system  of  civil \nservice processes. ADB will help ensure that the Government adopts a career-track civil service \nsystem  at  the  end  of  GRP-II.  It  will  help  implement  PSMFL-related  provisions  on  accounting, \nand  financial  and  performance  auditing  reforms,  building  on  earlier  ADB  TA  and  World  Bank \nsupport.  ADB  will  coordinate  closely  with  UNDP  to  enhance  public  confidence  in  the \nGovernment. \n \n\nfor \n\n\f11 \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\n \nObjectives and Scope  \n\nA. \n \nGRP-II aims to enhance public sector accountability and efficiency, to be measured by \n41. \nfiscal  sustainability  and  tangible  improvements  in  delivery  of  key  public  services.  GRP-II\u2019s \npurpose, following measures adopted under GRP on a pilot basis, is to help implement public \nsector  administrative  and  financial  management  reforms.  GRP-II  will  adopt  a  three-pronged \napproach: \n \n\nEnhance institutional capacity. \n\n(i)  \n \n\n(ii) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(b) \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nimplementation  of  PSMFL-related  measures  on  strategic \nSupport \nplanning  and  output-based  budgeting,  with  focus  on  health,  education, \nand social welfare and labor portfolios. \nStrengthen the institutional and implementation arrangements for financial \ngovernance norms in the public sector. \n\n \nImprove fiscal sustainability.  \n \n(a) \n\nInitiate  pension  reforms  to  alleviate  fiscal  pressures  on  the  budget \nstemming from the public pension system. \nInitiate  administrative  consolidation  to  reduce  multiple  layers  of  control \nthat impede efficiency and lead to waste of scarce resources. \n\n(iii)  Mainstream governance reforms.  \n \n\nEnhance  the  enforcement  capacity  of  SSC  to  improve  the  quality  of  the \ncivil service. \nEnhance confidence in key public institutions. \n\nImportant Features \n\nGRP-II will undertake the following to enable reform: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nMainstream governance reforms, centered on output and financial management \nmeasures  in  the  public  sector,  which  eventually  will  trickle  down  to  the  entire \neconomy through well-functioning government at all levels. \nDesign  the  cluster  program  to  facilitate  learning  by  doing,  by  gradually \nimplementing  reforms  in  2003-2009.13  This  approach will (a) allow considerable \nflexibility  and  enable  ADB  to  remain  engaged  in  governance  reforms,  address \ncapacity  constraints,  and  enable  stakeholder  consultations  over  a  longer  period \nof  time  than  otherwise  possible;  and  (b)  mitigate  the  risks  assoc iated  with \nformulating  and  implementing  a  complex  reform  agenda  in  the  run-up  to,  and \nimmediately after, parliamentary elections. \nSupport medium- to long-term administrative consolidation measures, which will \nhelp the Government achieve economies of scale  in administration and delivery \nof  public  services.  The  cluster  design  will  also  enable  extensive  stakeholder \n\n                                                 \n13 Two TAs are included in the 2004-2005 program to help support broad policy analysis of some of the components \n\nof subprogram 1 and program preparation for subprogram 2. \n\n \nB. \n \n42. \n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nconsultation  and  facilitate  consensus  building  on  optimal  approaches  to  merge \nprovincial  and  district  administrations  or  consolidate  the  delivery  of  essential \npublic services. \nTarget  education,  health,  and  social  welfare  and  labor  portfolios  to  complement \nand  leverage  reforms  supported  by  ADB  through  past  and  ongoing  sector-\nspecific interventions. \n\n(iv) \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n \nC. \n \n43.  The policy matrix in Appendix 2 outlines the measures supported under subprogram 1. It \nwill  support  a  number  of  mainstreaming  measures.  Subprogram  2,  as  outlined  under  the \nmilestones  in  Appendix  3,  will  support  a  series  of  critical  follow-up measures to complete  the \nenvisaged  reforms,  and  ensure  sufficient  stakeholder  consultations.  Appendix  4  presents  the \ndevelopment policy letter. The program logical framework is in Appendix 5. \n \n44.  The  policy  matrix  is  organized  on  the  basis  of  the  three  main  components. While GRP \nimplementation was completed in December 2002, GRP-II has adopted a seamless approach of \ntracking government reforms since enactment of PSMFL in June 2002. The principal aim of the \nGovernment since then has been to increase awareness of the law among the public officials to \nfacilitate its implementation. Subprogram 1 has 35 actions across the three components, and 1 \naction  to  ensure  sufficient  budget  for  a  social  safety  net.  As  the  program  is  proposed  in \ncontinuity  of  GRP,  the  Government  has  complied  with  six  important  conditions  before  loan \nnegotiations. Of the remaining 29, 10 are indicated as core second-tranche release conditions, \nand 19 will be monitored throughout the program. \n \n\n1. \n\nEnhance Institutional Capacity \n\n \n\n \n\na. \n\nImplement PSMFL-Related Reforms \n\n \n\n45.  Adopt  an  Implementation  Framework.  To  continue  GRP,  the  Government  has \nundertaken  a  number  of  measures  since  adoption  of  PSMFL.  As  part  of  GRP-II,  the \nGovernment approved a PSMFL implementation plan in September 2002. It envisages a 3-year \ntime  frame,  2003-2005,  consisting  of  the  following:  (i)  preparatory  stage,  July  2002-December \n2002,  to  undertake  initial  work  on  planning  and  budgeting,  the  new  accounting  and  reporting \nsystem,  performance  and  expenditure  management  systems,  establishment of ex post audits, \nand transition to a centralized treasury management system; (ii) second stage, January 2003-\nDecember  2005,  to  introduce  an  output-based  management  system;  and  (iii)  third  stage, \nJanuary  2004  onward,  to  gradually  devolve  input  delegation  to  lower-level  entities.  While  a  3-\nyear time-bound plan has been adopted, the Government is acutely aware of the complexities of \nthe transition, particularly in light of the capacity constraints. Hence, the implementation plan will \nbe treated as a guide that may be amended as appropriate. \n  \n46.  Adopt Guidelines and Consequential Amendments to Legislation. The Government, \nwith ADB TA support, has published a detailed explanation guide in Mongolian on public sector \nfinance  and  management  reforms  and  disseminated  over  1,500  copies  for  use  by  portfolio \nministers, general managers, and key staff of the main agencies. The Government also drafted \nconsequential  amendments  to  75  laws,  necessitated  by  the  adoption  of  PSMFL,  which \nParliament enacted in January 2003. Of particular importance are amendments to the laws on \nbudget,  civil  service,  government,  and  state  audit,  which  clarify  and  reconcile  their  provisions \nwith  PSMFL.  The  Government  has  also  issued  rules  and  regulations  requiring  line  ministries \n\n\f13 \n\nfor  considerable \n\nflexibility  and  autonomy \n\nInitiatives.  To  enhance  awareness  of  PSMFL, \n\nand  budgetary  bodies  to  present  their  budget  estimates  in  a  portfolio  appropriation  format,  in \nline with the PSMFL requirements, on a trial basis in 2003, leading to full adoption of the new \nformat in 2005-2006. The approved budget for 2003 is presented on a portfolio basis. \n \nthe \n47.  Launch  Capacity-Building \nGovernment  has  formulated  a  capacity-building  program,  to  be  initially  funded  through \ncounterpart funds generated under GRP. All state secretaries in the line ministries (who are also \nthe  ministries\u2019  general  managers)  and  the  general  managers  of  all  central  budgetary  bodies \nhave  undergone  an  intensive  training  program  on  the  basics  of  PSMFL.  A  training-of-trainers \nprogram  was  completed,  following  which  three  academic-cum-training  institutions  provided \nbasic  training  sessions  on  PSMFL  implementation  for  central  and  local  government  officials  in \nMay-July  2003.  The  Government  will  evaluate  the  outcomes  and  design  the  follow-up training \nphase. \n \n48.  Strengthen Strategic Planning and Output-Based Budgeting. As part of GRP, all the \n5  bunch-1  agencies  formulated  their  strategic  business  plans  (SBPs),  while  the  12  bunch-2 \nministries  and  agencies  started  to  do  so.  A  key  difficulty  for  central  ministries  has  been \nredefining  their  roles  in  the  post-PSMFL  environment,  given  the  transition  from  focusing  on \npolicy  formulation  and  coordination,  to  undertaking  overall  sector  management.  Although  the \nPSMFL  provides \nto  provincial  and  district \nadministrations  to  define  their  strategic  priorities,  the  law  has  simultaneously  expanded  the \nscope of oversight activities covered by the line ministries. Based on earlier SBPs produced by \na  limited  number  of  entities,  the  Government  will  monitor progress on revisions to the SBPs, \nwhich  will  be  done  continuously  by  all  ministries  and  budgetary  bodies.  ADB  TA  support  has \nbeen  provided  to  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture,  and  Science  (MOSTEC),  Ministry  of  Health \n(MOH),  and  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare  and  Labor  (MSWL)  in  preparing  for  PSMFL \nimplementation.  In  compliance  with  a  second-tranche  condition,  these  ministries  will  finalize \ntheir  SBPs  for  2004-2006,  to  ADB\u2019s  satisfaction,  by  December  2003.  By  November  2003 \nMOSTEC,  MOH,  and  MSWL  will  also  finalize  the  following:  (i)  output  specification  in  the \neducation and health sectors, and standardized methodology and dissemination of the methods \nand formats for reporting; and (ii) sector-specific output-costing guidelines and instructions. By \nMarch 2004 the ministries will agree on quantitative norms on output costs against which their \nportfolio  outcomes  can  be  benchmarked.  Advisory  support  under  CBGR  and  other  sector  TAs \nwill focus on strengthening sector medium-term planning, which, in turn, will feed into improving \nSBPs by evaluating current service delivery performance in the key sectors.  \n \n49.  The output specification and costing process needs to be strengthened at all levels before \nthe  budgetary  bodies  can  comply  with  PSMFL  provisions  on  finalizing  portfolio  appropriation \nestimates  on  the  basis  of  outputs.  In  the  interim  MOFE  will  liaise  with  the  line  ministries  to \nensure that the transition to output-based estimation is well managed. As part of GRP-II, in May \n2003 MOFE submitted to Parliament the fiscal framework statement for 2004-2006 and a draft \nMTEF.  By  October  2003  MOFE  will  also  (i)  formulate  and  issue  the  methodology  for  medium-\nterm expenditure planning on an accrual basis to all line ministries and budgetary bodies, and \n(ii)  formulate  guidelines  and  issue  them  to  all  line  ministries  and  budgetary  bodies  to  enable \nthem to finalize their portfolio appropriation estimates in line with PSMFL provisions. \n \n50. \nIntroduce  Measures  for  Expenditure  Discipline.  The  Government,  through  MO FE\u2019s \ncoordination with MOH, MOSTEC, and MSWL, will start assessing public sector administrative \nexpenditures  incurred  to  fulfill  the  above  portfolio  responsibilities,  and,  by  March  2004,  set  a \nceiling  on  such  expenditures.  The  Government  will  control  expenditures  and  encourage \ncoordinating  agencies  to  conserve  administrative  resources  and  utilize  the  savings  to  provide \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nincentives  to  staff  or  upgrade  infrastructure.  The  Government  will  also  simultaneously  prepare \nand  submit  a  comprehensive  report  to  ADB  annually  every  October  over  2003-2006, focusing \non (i) the quasi-fiscal activities and liabilities resulting from noneconomic state sector activities; \n(ii) contingent liabilities incurred by the Government; and (iii) arrears on taxes and payments to \nthe state budget, categorized by the defaulters\u2019 ownership structure. \n \n\nb. \n\nStrengthen Financial Governance Norms in the Public and Private \nSectors \n\n \n51. \nEstablish Sound Oversight for Public Sector Accounting. Other than the Accounting \nPolicy, Methodology, and Auditing Department of MOFE, which is a policy and standards-setting \nbody, no coordinating department or official oversees actual public sector financial accounting. \nWhile  all  budgetary  bodies  are  required  to  have  an  in-house  chief  accountant,  most  do  not. \nThose  that  do,  have  accountants  who  lack  qualification  and  skills.  To  modernize  the \nGovernment\u2019s financial management system and establish practices leading to sound financial \nreporting  to  the  Government  and  Parliament,  government  accounts  must  be  under  centralized \nleadership and controllership. By January 2004 the Government will establish a new accountant \ngeneral  (AG)  position  at  MOFE,  with  CPA  qualifications,  to  be  responsible  for  all  ex  ante \nfinancial  planning  and  ex  post  financial  reporting,  and  overall  government  accounting \nresponsibilities. Following ADB\u2019s approval of the proposed TA loan for CBGR, the Government \nwill  (i)  appoint  an  international  senior  advisor  to  the  AG  with  support  under  CBGR,  (ii)  ensure \nthat a qualified incumbent staff is nominated as chief accountant in each portfolio ministry and \nprovince, and (iii) establish a hierarchical link between the AG and chief accountants of portfolio \nministries and provinces.  \n \n52. \nThe AG, who will have sound knowledge of accrual accounting and government financial \nmanagement  and  reporting,  will  direct  financial  management  systems  as  well  as  ensure \naccurate  financial  reporting  by  doing  the  following:  (i)  set  accounting  procedures,  establish \nfinancial  management  policies,  and  monitor  implementation  of  these  regulations;  (ii)  develop \naccounting  manuals  to  improve  the  quality  of  financial  reporting;  (iii)  implement  a  uniform  and \nintegrated chart of accounts for accounting, budgeting, and reporting for all government entities; \n(iv)  implement  international  public  sector  accounting  standards  (IPSAS);  (v)  approve  the \nappointment  of  chief  accountants  in  portfolio  ministries  and  budget  entities,  and  monitor  their \nwork plan and performance; (vi) assess the skills of all government accountants and establish \nbenchmarks for quality improvement; and (vii) certify government accountants, based on a well-\ndesigned examination and evaluation process. \n \n53.  Establish  Sound  Internal  Audit  Arrangements.  A  strong  overall  internal  audit  and \ncontrol  environment  is  needed  to  promote  sound  financial  management  in  portfolio  ministries \nand  budget  entities  and  enable  them  to  respond  appropriately  to  significant  operational, \nfinancial,  compliance,  and  other  risks,  including  inappropriate  use  of  assets  or  their  loss  from \nfraud. Liabilities must be identified and managed. Good internal and external reporting requires \nmaintenance  of  proper  records,  and  processes  that  generate  a  flow  of  timely,  relevant,  and \nreliable  information  from  within  and  outside  budget  entities,  and  which  can  be  increased \nsignificantly  through  internal  control.  Internal  audit  also  expedites  compliance  with  applicable \nlaws  and  regulations,  and  also  with  internal  audit  policies.  Accordingly,  by  January  2004,  the \nGovernment will (i) establish internal control functions under the AG\u2019s Office, accountable to the \nAG,  led  by  the  head  of  internal  audit  (HIA);  (ii)  coordinate  the  nomination  of  a  qualified \nincumbent staff as an internal auditor in the portfolio ministries, including MOFE and  provinces, \nreporting to the respective state secretaries and  provincial governors; (iii) set up a hierarchical \n\n\f15 \n\ninternal  audit  certificate  by  meeting  all \n\nlink between the HIA and internal auditors of portfolio ministries and provinces; (iv) ensure that \nthe  AG  formally  defines  the  terms  of  reference  of  internal  audits  in  line  with  the  operational \nstandards  issued  by  the  Institute  of  the  Internal  Auditor;  (v)  ensure  that  the  HIA  obtains  a \ngovernment \ninstitute\u2019s  requirements;  and \n(vi) establish continued professional education requirements for internal auditors. \n \n54.  The  following  institutional  structure  for  the  AG  and  internal  audit  arrangements  will  be \nestablished (see Appendix 6 for more detail):  \n \n\nthe \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nthe  AG,  responsible  for  consolidating  the  financial  report  for  the  whole \nGovernment, will be located within MOFE (but different from the chief accountant \nin  the  Treasury  or  the  Accounting  Policy  and  Methodology  Department)  and \nreport to the state secretary of MOFE;  \nheads  of  the  accounting  department  in  all  portfolio  ministries, including MOFE, \nand  provincial  administrations,  will  be  nominated  as  chief  accountant  of  the \nrespective entities;  \nthe chief accountant for MOFE will be outside the Treasury or accounting policy \nand methodology and auditing departments  to segregate the Treasury (including \ncash  management)  as  well  as  accounting  auditing  policy-setting functions from \nfinancial  accounting  and  reporting,  and  the  MOFE  chief  accountant  will  perform \nthe same functions as the chief accountants in other portfolio ministries;  \nan  internal  controller  in  each  portfolio  ministry  (including  MOFE)  and  provincial \nadministration, will be reporting to the state secretaries or general managers as \nappropriate; and  \nthe  HIA  will  initially  be  located  within  MOFE,  and  all  the  internal  auditors will \nreport to the HIA, who, in turn, will report to the AG. \n\n \n55. \nEnhance  Compliance  with  Internationally  Accepted  Norms  for  Public  Sector \nAccounting.  The  Government  is  in  the  process  of  officially  recognizing  IPSAS  issued  by  the \nPublic Sector Committee of the International Federation of Accountants. Under GRP-II, by May \n2004  MOFE  will  draft  and  submit  to  Parliament  amendments  to  the  Law  on  Accounting  to \nestablish  a  certified  government  accountant  structure  for  the  3,180  public  accountants  at  the \ncentral and local ministries, governors\u2019 offices, and various budgetary bodies. The amendments \nwill also provide for entry and qualification criteria to take effect on a time-bound basis, and for \njob classifications and categories. By May 2004 MOFE will also have designed an examination \nstructure  and  review  courses  to  prepare  candidates  for  the  exams,  and  developed  continued \nprofessional education requirements to certify government accountants. By November 2004 the \nGovernment will have conducted the first exam for government accountants. \n \n56. \nIntroduce  Sound  Asset  Valuation  Standards. To strengthen the rudimentary norms \nand practices used for asset valuation, by June 2005, with support from CBGR, the Government \nwill draft and adopt asset valuation standards on movable, immovable, and nonmaterial assets \n(e.g., trademarks, copyrights, etc.) that are comparable to international standards. \n \n57.  Make the Transition to Accrual Accounting. In line with PSMFL, the Government will \nofficially adopt the  new chart of accounts (developed under the World Bank\u2019s fiscal TA project) \ndesigned  to  operate  on  cash  and  accrual  bases.  To  guide  the  transition,  under  subprogram  1 \nand  with  support  from  CBGR,  by  June  2005  the  Government  will  have  implemented  a  pilot \nprogram for education and health to develop (i) an initial set of accrual-based accounts that will \nrecognize the receivables and payables at the end of each fiscal year, and (ii) asset registers for \nthe pilot sectors.  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n58. \nEnhance  Transparency  through  Financial  and  Performance  Auditing.  PSMFL \nentrusts  NAO  with  financial  and  performance  audits  of  public  sector  agencies.  Under  GRP-II, \nwith advisory support under CBGR, by May 2005 NAO will have conducted financial statement \naudits of (i) MOSTEC, MOH, and MSWL; and (ii) one  province14 (to be undertaken through the \nconcerned state audit office) on a pilot basis, to be selected in consultation with ADB. By May \n2005 NAO will also have undertaken performance audits of selected functions and outcomes of \nCGA,  GDNT,  MOSTEC,  MOH,  and  MSWL,  and  publish  a  summary  of  the  audits  in  major \nnewspapers.  \n \n59. \nUndertake  Forward-Looking  Measures  to  Improve  Financial  Management.  The \nGovernment  will  undertake  a  host  of  financial  management  reforms.  By  May  2005  the \nGovernment  will  have  reviewed  the  functions  of  SPIA,  particularly  in  financial  inspection,  and \nrestructure  SPIA  to  ADB\u2019s  satisfaction.  The  review  objective  will  be  to  ensure  that  the  internal \ncontrol  functions  are  strengthened  in  each  budgetary  agency.  By  June  2004 the Government \nwill also have undertaken measures to improve the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework \nfor  private  sector  accounting,  and  (i)  separate  MICPA  from  MOFE,  (ii)  abolish  the  Mongolian \nProfessional Accounting Council, (iii) translate  international  accounting  and  auditing  standards \ninto Mongolian and adopt them verbatim, and (iv) draft amendments to the Law on Auditing to \nstreamline the CPA examination and certification process. \n\n \n\n2. \n\n \n\nImprove Fiscal Sustainability \n\n \n\na. \n\nthe  Social  Security  System \n\nto  Enhance  Fiscal \n\nStrengthen \nSustainability \n\n \nThe  Government,  based  on  advisory  support  provided  under  earlier  ADB  TAs,15  will \n60. \nundertake  some  critical  measures  to  enhance  the  fiscal  sustainability  of  the  social  security \nsystem.  By  July  2004  MSWL  will  have  drafted  a  white  paper  on  pension  system  reform, \nfocusing on the need to increase retirement ages (by eliminating early retirement privileges and \nequalizing  retirement  ages  of  men  and  women),  revamp  the  notional  defined  contributory \nsystem , and properly index pensions. By March 2005 MSWL will have disseminated the white \npaper  for  stakeholder  consultations  and  finalized  the  reform  measures  to  ADB\u2019s  satisfaction. \nSubprogram 2 will pursue implementation of the reforms. \n \n\n \n\nb. \n\nInitiate  Central  and  Local  Administrative  Consolidation \nStrengthen Public Sector Resource Management \n\nto \n\n \n61. \nThe  Government  has  embarked  on  a  plan  to  develop  five  regional  centers  to  redress \nregional imbalances and evenly distribute the population. While the Government\u2019s objective is to \nachieve equity in growth across the country, any development of regional clusters may lead to \nadditional  layers  of  public  administration.  CS  and  MOFE  have,  therefore,  submitted  to \nParliament a draft law on the regional management providing that regional development will not \ncreate such additional layers or additional expenditure outlays. \n\n                                                 \n14 The Government has requested that the Ulaanbaatar city administration or some of its districts be chosen for this \npurpose, as the city accounts for close to 50% of revenues collected and 40% of public expenditures countrywide. \nAs  the  city  administration  is  focusing  on  a  number  of  anticorruption  measures,  financial  and  performance  audits \nwould  facilitate  the  administration\u2019s  reform  agenda.  The  advisors  under  CBGR  will  assess  the  needs  and  advise \nthe Government. \n\n15 ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Financial Sector Development. Manila; ADB. 1997. Technical \n\nAssistance on Social Safety Net. Manila.   \n\n\f17 \n\n \n62. \nThe Government and public increasingly recognize that low population density in certain \nprovinces  will  threaten  local  fiscal  stability.  The  Government  has  devoted  attention  to \naggregation of localities, and is formulating a three-pronged approach: (i) explore the potential \nfor interprovincial consolidation, by considering the aggregation of Selenge and Darkhan in the \nnorth,  Gobi-sumber  and  Dornogobi  in  the  south,  and  Orkhon  and  Bulgaan  in  the  west; \n(ii) consolidate districts within several provinces; and (iii) establish inter- and subprovincial links \nto  consolidate  public  service  delivery,  including  health,  education,  taxation,  and  other \ncomponents of public administration.  \n \n63. \nGRP-II will support intra- and interprovincial consolidation. As part of subprogram 1, by \nMarch 2004 the Government will have drafted a concept paper on administrative consolidation \nto improve public expenditure management and achieve economies of scale in service delivery, \nconsisting  of  a  framework  to  consolidate  the  following:  (i)  selected  contiguous  provinces;  (ii) \nselected  districts  within  the  same  or  other  provinces;  and  (iii)  selected  public  sector \nadministrative  units,  agencies  and  institutions,  and  service  delivery  functions  in  the  selected \nprovinces  and  districts  Such  measures  should  not  disrupt  the  quality  of,  or  access  to,  public \nservices.  The  plan  will  include  safeguards  and  social  safety  nets  to  provide  for  the  short-run \ntransition costs as well as to mitigate adverse impacts of such measures. \n \nAs part of subprogram 2, the Government will establish consensus through consultations \n64. \nwith  all  the  local  stakeholders,  including  the  public,  local  government  officials,  and  provincial \ncitizens\u2019  representative  assemblies.  The  Government  will  finalize  the  concept  paper  based  on \nlocal  inputs,  and  start  to  formulate  a  legal  framework,  including  amendments  to  relevant \nlegislation,  to  achieve  intra- and  interprovincial  consolidation.  Subprogram  2  will  also  help  the \nGovernment achieve such consolidation to enhance fiscal responsibility and achieve economies \nof scale and efficiency in public sector administration. The Government envisages the following: \n(i) four districts will be consolidated together to the satisfaction of stakeholders and ADB through \nconsultations,  including  by  merging  administrative  jurisdictions  and  jointly  providing  services \nacross districts ; and (ii) six provincial administrations will be consolidated into three. \n \n\n3. \n\nMainstream Governance Reforms \n\na. \n\nEnhance Confidence in Public Institutions \n\n \n65. \nEnhance  Civil  Service  Culture.  GRP-II  will  support  several  measures  to  strengthen \nSSC,  supplementing  advisory  support  from  the  World  Bank,  to  establish  a  sound  information \nsystem  on  civil  servants  and  their  working  conditions.  As  part  of  GRP-II, SSC, with advisory \nsupport  from  ADB  TA,16  will  develop  the  criteria  and  a  code  of  conduct  on  ethics  for  civil \nservants,  which  the  Government  will  adopt  by  May  2004.  SSC  will  (i)  by  May  2004  have \nadopted  an  enforcement  mechanism  to  implement  Parliament\u2019s  rules  on  selecting  candidates \nfor  senior  civil  servant  positions,  and  a  grievance  and  dispute  settlement  mechanism  for  civil \nservants;  and  (ii)  as  part  of  the  regular  annual  report  from  SSC  to  Parliament,  submit  an \nassessment of the enforcement outcomes. \n \n66. \nSSC will also (i) determine if the performance evaluation reports from selected ministries \nand provincial administrations are in line with SSC\u2019s evaluation requirements, and (ii) submit to \nParliament  an  overall  performance  evaluation  report  and  make  it  publicly  available.  This \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB.  2002.  Technical  Assistance  for  Strengthening  Public  Sector  Administration  and  Financial Management. \n\nSeptember. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nexercise  will  be  repeated  for  all  ministries  and  provincial  administrations  for  reporting  on \noutcomes in FY2004. \n \nEnhance  Transparency  and  Accountability  in  Key  Public  Institutions.  The \n67. \nGovernment  has  recently  taken  a  number  of  commendable  steps  in  this  direction,  including \nestablishment of the National Council on Anticorruption (NCAC), headed by the prime minister, \nwith  support  from  UNDP  under  the  GGHS  program.  However,  public  confidence  in  key \ninstitutions,  including  CGA  and  GDNT,  continues  to  be  low,  and  public  service  delivery \nmechanisms and utilization of budgetary funds in health and education sectors. In March 2003 \nNCAC  adopted  the  Action  Plan  on  Anticorruption,  which  focuses  on  improving  confidence  in \npublic institutions.  \n \n68. \nUnder  GRP-II,  in  line  with  item  2  of  the  action  plan  and  with  support  from  UNDP  and \nADB, CS will (i) coordinate the establishment of an NCAC subgroup to comprehensively assess \nthe  role,  performance,  and  efficacy  of  GDNT,  CGA,  and  service  delivery  mechanisms  in \neducation and health, with participation from civil society, academia, and Parliament, and limited \ngovernment  representation;  and  (ii)  formulate  the  subgroup\u2019s  terms  of  reference  to  undertake \nthe  performance  assessments  and  design  remedial  measures.  This  subcomponent  will \ncomplement the financial and performance audit measures in para. 66. By June 2004 CS and \nthe NCAC subgroup, with support from UNDP and ADB, will have submitted a comprehensive \nassessment report and made it publicly available. The Government will start implementing the \nremedial measures outlined in the report by December 2004.  \n \nUnder GRP, a sample of SOEs finalized SBPs and concluded performance agreements \n69. \nwith MOFE. Under subprogram 2 the Government will improve SOE corporate governance and \ncomplete privatization after cleaning up any budgetary arrears and debts (Appendix 3). \n \n\n3.   \n\nFormulate Effective Social Safety Net Measures and Allocate Budgetary  \n\n  Resources \n\nFinancial Implications of the Reform Program \n\n \n70.  The  forward-looking  thrust  of  GRP-II  will  have  an  overall  positive  economic  and  social \nimpact by conserving public financial resources. None of the subprogram 1 measures are likely \nto  have  an  adverse  impact  on  the  poor  or  vulnerable.  However,  to  address  social  safety  net \nneeds arising from the 2003\u20132009 overall reform program, the Government will allocate at least \n$500,000 each year in the annual budgets in 2004-2006. The Government has also agreed that \nthe formulation of specific measures under subprogram 2 will take into account the need for a \nsocial safety net arising from their implementation. \n \nD. \n \n71. \nGRP-II  is  a  time  slice  of  the  10-year  governance  reform  roadmap.  Subprogram \nimplementation  will  cost  an  estimated  $34.1  million  equivalent  over  6  years  (Table  1)  to \nstrengthen \nimplement  other  PSMFL-related  provisions, \nundertake structural  reforms  for  administrative  consolidation,  pay  for  the  social  impact  of  the \nreform measures, and pay the net costs of infusing budgetary discipline into SOEs. While some \ncosts such as establishment of public service delivery facilities in regional centers to prepare for \nconsolidation  are  derived  from  the  Government\u2019s  draft  MTEF,  its  full  adoption  will  lead  to \nperiodic reevaluation of the financing gaps and costs of reform programs and clarify the impact \nof structural adjustments. \n \n\nfinancial  management  systems, \n\n\f19 \n\nPublic sector modernization has other costs that cannot be quantified yet. In particular, \n72. \nsubprogram  1  will  support  PSMFL  implementation  on  a  pilot  basis  while  the  Government \npursues  reform  of  the  entire  public  sector.  To  build  consensus  and  support  for  reform,  the \nGovernment  will  also  have  to  enhance  social  capital,  which  is  not  quantified  or  included  here. \nHence,  the  overall  cost  of  the  reform  process  is  likely  to  be  considerably  higher  than  the \nsubprogram costs. \n \n\nFinancial Implications of the Governance Reform Program, Phase II (2003-2009) \n \n\nCost  \n($ million equivalent) \n\nSubprogram  1  Subprogram  2 \n\n7.0 \n5.0 \n \n\nReform Elements   \n \nStrengthening Financial Management Systems \nNet Costs of Introducing Other PSMFL Provisions \nRestructuring  Costs  Arising  from  Functional  Review  of \nthe Public Sector \nEnsuring  Service  Delivery  through  Inter-provincial  and \nInter-district  Facilities  as  Part  of  Administrative \nConsolidation \nSocial Safety Net Needs  \nNet  Costs  of  Infusing  Budgetary  Discipline  through \nClearing SOE Arrears before Privatization \nSavings from Pension Reform Measures \n      Total \nPSMFL = Public Sector Management and Finance Law, SOE = state-owned enterprise. \n \nE. \n\n \n18.5 \n\n1.5 \n \n\n5.0 \n\nFinancing Plan \n \n\n3.0 \n2.0 \n3.0 \n\n10.0 \n\n4.0 \n10.0 \n\n(16.4) \n15.6 \n\nTotal \n10.0 \n7.0 \n3.0 \n\n15.0 \n\n5.5 \n10.0 \n\n(16.4) \n34.1 \n\n73. \nA program loan of SDR9,699,000 ($13.5 million equivalent) is proposed to be provided \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Fund  resources  to  support  subprogram  1.  The  program  loan  will  have  a \nterm  of  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years.  The  interest  charge  will  be  1.0%  per \nannum during the grace period of 8 years, and 1.5% per year for the remaining period. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n \n74.  MOFE  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  GRP-II  and  responsible  for  implementing  all \nPSMFL-related measures, and reforms relating to public sector financial management and the \nsocial security system. CS will be the implementing agency for all the local government reform \nissues  and  the  civil  service  reform  component.  CS  will  also  ensure  that  all  cabinet-level \ncoordination needed to smoothly implement GRP-II is efficient. \n \n75. \nGiven  the  coverage  of  a  number  of  cross-sectoral  issues  and  the  complexity  of  the \nreform measures agreed upon, GRP-II will follow the steering committee model adopted under \nGRP.  A  steering  committee  and  an  operational  working  group  will  assist  MOFE  and  CS.  The \nsteering committee will comprise the chief of CS (as head of the committee), minister of finance \nand economy, minister of social welfare and labor, economic advisor to the prime minister, and \ntwo  representatives  from  the  parliamentary  working  group  on  governance.  The  operational \nworking group will be led by the deputy minister of MOFE and comprise the deputy chief of CS \nin  charge  of  local  government  reforms,  head  of  MOFE\u2019s  Fiscal  Policy  Department,  head  of \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nMOFE\u2019s  Accounting  Policy  Department,  head  of  MSWL\u2019s  pension  department,  head  of  a \nrelevant department of SSC, and head of administration of NAO. \n \nThe  Government  will  establish  a  GRP-II  program  implementation  unit  (PIU)  in  MOFE \n76. \nbefore  loan  negotiations  with  support  from  domestic  and  international  consultants  under  ADB \nTA  grants  and  the  TA  loan  for  CBGR.  The  PIU  will  comprise  at  least  three  counterpart \nsupporting staff, with one nominated from CS and  the others from MOFE. The PIU will report to \nthe state secretary of MOFE and shall coordinate with the operational working group monthly to \nreport  on  progress.  The  PIU  will  coordinate  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB  on  GRP-II and \nCBGR implementation and submit a program completion report after the Government complies \nwith all the tranche-release conditions that can be monitored. The deputy minister of MOFE and \ndeputy chief of CS will inform the steering committee monthly of all key aspects of GRP-II. \n\n \n2. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\n \nSubprogram  1  will  be  implemented  beginning  from  board  approval  to  December  2005. \n77. \nDepending  subprogram  1\u2019s  progress,  the  subprogram  2  proposal  may  be  presented  to  the \nBoard  for  consideration  in  the  first  quarter  of  2006  and  implemented  until  mid-2009. ADB will \nprepare an interim program completion report, outlining the progress under subprogram 1, along \nwith a finalized policy matrix to guide subprogram 2 based on milestones. A program completion \nreport for the whole cluster will be prepared within 12-18 months after completion of subprogram \n2. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n \n78. \nThe proceeds of the program loan under subprogram 1 will be withdrawn in accordance \nwith ADB's standard disbursement procedures. Before submitting the first application to ADB for \nwithdrawal from the loan account, the MOFE will open a deposit account at BOM, into which all \nwithdrawals will be deposited. The deposit account will be established, managed, and liquidated \nin  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January  2001).  ADB  reserves  the \nright to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the validity of the certification issued by \nthe governments with each withdrawal application. \n \n79. \nIn accordance with the simplified disbursement and procurement procedure for program \nloans, the loan proceeds may be utilized to procure goods and services (excluding local duties \nand taxes) produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member countries, other than those specified \nin the list of ineligible items (Appendix 7) and those financed by other multilateral and bilateral \nofficial sources, and imports from non-ADB member countries. All procurements under the loan \nwill  be  done  through  normal  commercial  practices  for  the  private  sector  or the Government\u2019s \nprescribed  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  with  due  consideration  given  to \neconomy  and  efficiency.  No  supporting  import  documentation  will  be  required  if,  during  each \nyear in which the loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of the Government\u2019s \ntotal imports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed \nunder  other  official  development  assistance  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  loan  amount \nexpected  to  be  disbursed  during  such  year.  The  Government  will,  however,  certify  with  each \nwithdrawal  request  its  compliance  with  this  formula.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under \nexisting  procedures  will  be  required.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan  proceeds \nand verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification.  \n\n\f21 \n\n \n4. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n \n\n80. \nA cluster program modality comprising subprograms 1 and 2 is proposed. Subprogram 1 \nwill  have  two  tranches.  Periodic  reviews  of  implementation  progress  under  subprogram  1  will \nlead in seamlessly to formulating the full reform agenda under subprogram 2, developed on the \nbasis of the milestones in Appendix 3. The first tranche of subprogram 1, of SDR3.592 million \n($5.000  million  equivalent),  will  be  released  upon  approval  of  GRP-II  by  ADB  and  loan \neffectivity.  Subject  to  satisfactory  fulfillment  of  all  the  second-tranche  release  conditions \nappearing in bold in the policy matrix, and other program conditions that can be monitored, the \nsecond  tranche  of  SDR6.107  million  ($8.500  million  equivalent)  is  expected  to  be  released  by \nJuly 2005.  \n \n81. \nTo  finance  subprogram  2\u2019s  adjustment  costs,  ADB\u2019s  lending  program  for  2006  has \nallocated $10 million equivalent based on the forecast indicative planning figures and availability \nof Special Funds resources. ADB\u2019s support will depend on the final scope of subprogram 2 as \nwell as the availability of Special Funds resources. Subprogram 2 will also be divided into two \ntranches, and the amounts disbursed will be decided during design of subprogram 2. \n \n\n5. \n\nProgram Review \n\n \n82. \nGiven  the  reforms\u2019  complexity,  ADB  will  adopt  an  analytical  approach  to  monitoring \nprogram  implementation  and  the  reform  outcomes.  At  least  three  reviews  are  planned  every \nyear  during  program  implementation  and  progress  of  policy  reforms.  The  Mongolia  Resident \nMission  will  help  coordinate  the  addressing  of  emerging  issues  and  needs.  The  governance \nreform  TAs  proposed  for  2004-2005  will  include  evaluation  of  the  costs  and  benefits  of  policy \nmeasures, and assessment of overall PSMFL implementation, integrity of MTEF in key sectors, \nand stakeholder views on consolidation and other measures. These steps in turn, will help the \nGovernment  comply  with  subprogram  1,  and  feed  into  the  formulation  of  subprogram  2.  The \nanalytical  approach  will  also  help  the  Government  formulate  mid-course  corrections  in  the \noverall reform exercise. \n \n\nVI. \n\nTHE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN \n\nObjective and Scope  \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  TA  loan  for  CBGR  will  help  the  Government  enhance  its  overall  capacity  to \n83. \nimplement the key GRP-II governance-related measures through interim management, on-the-\njob training programs, and technical support. CBGR will cover the following: \n \n\nfinancial  management  reforms  in  public  sector  accounting,  auditing,  and  asset \nvaluation; \nsupport for strategic planning of PSMFL implementation; and \nsoftware and limited hardware support to efficiently undertake output costing, and \nfinancial statement and performance audits. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n \n\n84.  CBGR  will  provide  for  long-term  advisors who will (i) help senior management in MOFE \nand other selected ministries implement PSMFL; (ii) provide on-the-job guidance and training to \nthe  staff  of  ministries;  (iii)  identify  areas  that  need  improvement;  and  (iv)  undertake  system \n\nB.  Components \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\ndesign  for  financial  and  performance  audits,  and  install  hardware  and  software,  based  on  the \ntechnical  assessments.  In  total,  the  TA  will  provide  international  consulting  services  for  53 \nperson-months and domestic consulting inputs for 120 person-months. Appendix 9 presents the \nterms of reference for the positions. \n\n \n\n85. \nEstablish  Sound  Oversight  for  Public  Sector  Accounting  and  International  Audit \nArrangements.  To  modernize  the  Government\u2019s  financial  management  system  and  establish \npractices  leading  to  sound  financial  reporting  to  the  Government  and  Parliament,  CBGR  will \nprovide 18 person-months of international advisory assistance to the AG, intermittently, over 36 \nmonths. The resident advisor will be a CPA with government accounting and financial reporting \nexperience in market economies and preferably with experience in transition economies as well. \nThe resident advisor will help the AG direct financial management systems as well as build up \naccurate financial reporting for the Government. In line with their terms of reference (Appendix \n8), the AG and resident advisor will be jointly implement the policy matrix to establish oversight \nfor  public  accounting  and  internal  control  arrangements.  The  resident  advisor  will  also  review \nfunctions  of  financial  inspectors  in  budget  entities  and  portfolio  ministries  to  see  if  their  job \nresponsibilities  can  be  converted  into  internal  audit  functions  through  training  to  develop  and \nstrengthen their internal audit capacity. This review will serve as a foundation for the proposed \ncentral  internal  audit  unit  under  the  AG\u2019s  Office,  and  internal  audit  units  in  the  portfolio \nministries, provinces, and budgetary entities. \n \n86. \nUndertake financial statement and performance audits.  CBGR envisages advisory \nsupport  for  18  person-months  intermittently  over  36  months  to  help  NAO  conduct  financial \nstatement  and  performance  audit.  This  support  will  be  provided  through  on-the-job training for \nNAO  staff  assigned  to  financial  statement  and  performance  audits.  In  consultation  with  NAO\u2019s \nsenior management, the audit advisors will identify special needs of NAO staff and arrange for \nshort-term classroom training programs. A team of two international auditors will be mobilized to \nwork with 18 auditors of NAO to conduct financial statement and performance audits. Financial \nstatement audits will be undertaken for MOSTEC, MSWL, and MOH, and for one  province on a \npilot basis, to be selected in consultation with ADB. Performance audits will first be undertaken \nfor functions and outcomes, to be selected in consultation with ADB, of MOSTEC, MSWL, MOH, \nCGA, and GDNT, and a summary of the audits published in major newspapers.  \n \n87. \nDevelop Asset Valuation Standards. MOFE will be assisted with 2 person-months of \ninternational  consulting  services  in  drafting  asset  valuation  standards  in  line  with  international \nstandards, and in preparing a user\u2019s manual to apply them.  \n \n88. \nSupport  Strategic  Planning  Processes  to  Implement  PSMFL. This component, with \n13 person-months of international advisory inputs, will provide overall strategic planning, output \nspecification, and costing support, in line with PSMFL requirements, to MOH, MOSTEC, MSWL, \nMinistry  of  Infrastructure,  and  two  other  ministries  to  be  selected  in  consultation  with  MOFE, \ndepending on the  level  of  preparedness  and  a  needs  assessment.  This  process  will  entail  a \ncomprehensive  assessment  of  the  strategic  focus,  policy  orientation,  output  planning, \ninterministerial and interagency coordination, and progress in PSMFL implementation within the \nselected  portfolios.  Based  on  these  assessments,  time-bound strategic plans with measurable \nbenchmarks  will  be  formulated  to  guide  process-oriented  as  well  as  structural  reforms.  The \nadvisory component will also help NCAC implement the subcomponent to enhance confidence \nin public institutions.  \n \n \n\n\f23 \n\nCost, Financing Plan, and Implementation Arrangements \n\n89.  Modernize  Financial  Management.  This  component  will  have  two  modules.  The  first \nwill  help  NAO  develop  a  software  package  for  financial  statement  and  performance  audits,  by \nusing system-based computerized methods. The second module will help modernize the output-\ncosting processes in all portfolios. A needs assessment will evaluate the hardware and software \nat  central  and  local  budgetary  bodies.  The  module  will  help  MOFE  procure  a  modern  output-\ncosting  program  with  full  licensing  rights  for  use  by  a  large  number  of  budgetary  entities. \nHardware and basic software support will be provided selectively. The output-costing software \nand associated training are anticipated to be provided to about 3,000 accountants.  To support \nthe software and hardware assessments and design, an international management information \nsystems expert will be recruited for 2 person-months. \n \nC. \n \n90. \nThe total cost of the capacity-building activities is estimated at $2.4 million, of which it is \nproposed  that  ADB  provide  $2  million  equivalent  (SDR1.437  million)  from  its  Special  Funds \nresources.  The  Government  will  provide  $400,000  equivalent  in  counterpart  facilities.  The  TA \nloan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  carry  an  interest \ncharge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per year for the remaining period. \n \n91. \nAll international and domestic consultants will be recruited on an individual basis by the \nPIU through competitive selection. All consultants will be recruited in accordance with the ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  the  ADB  for  the \nselection  and  engagement  of  domestic  consultants. CBGR will be implemented over 3 years, \nfrom October 2003 to September 2006. MOFE will be the executing agency, with coordination \nand  implementation  support  provided  by  CS  for  strategic  planning.  The  PIU,  directly  working \nunder and reporting to  state secretary of the ministry of finance and economy, will be in charge \nof day-to-day implementation. The PIU will submit quarterly progress reports to ADB on CBGR \nimplementation until all TA loan activities are successfully completed.  \n \n92. \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  from  ADB  loan  funds  will  be  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  procurement  of  hardware  and  software  for  the \nmanagement  information  systems  component  will  be  based  on  international  shopping \nprocedures.  The  PIU  will  establish  one  imprest  account  in  foreign  currency  at  a  commercial \nbank acceptable to ADB, to disburse funds to procure equipment and fund operating costs. The \naccount will receive an initial deposit upon loan effectiveness of $150,000 for the first 6 months \nof  implementation,  including  for  payment  to  domestic  consultants  and  procurement  of \nequipment  and  materials.  Eligible  operating  expenditures  under  CBGR  will  be  reimbursed  or \ndrawn from the imprest account advance against satisfactory statements of expenditure subject \nto a maximum for any single payment of $50,000, in accordance with procedures acceptable to \nADB, and in accordance with the Loan Disbursement Handbook.  \n \n93.  MOFE  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting \nprinciples, with sufficient detail to identify all goods and services financed under CBGR and to \nindicate  the  use  to  which  they  were  put.  The  accounts  (including  financial  statements, \nstatements  of  expenditure,  and  imprest  accounts  records)  will  be  audited  annually  by \nindependent  external  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Separate  records  will  be  maintained  for  the \nimprest account. ADB reserves the right to audit these accounts at any time. Costs for annual \naudits  throughout  CBGR  implementation  have  been  included  in  TA  loan  costs.  MOFE  will \nsubmit certified copies of the audited accounts and the auditor\u2019s report to ADB within six months \nof  completion  of  each  fiscal  year.  MOFE  will  also  provide  ADB  with  any  reasonable  additional \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\ninformation concerning the TA loan accounts and financing that ADB may request from time to \ntime.  \n\nVII. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFIT S, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \n\n \n\nBenefits \n\nA. \n \nOverall Benefits. GRP-II will have institutional, fiscal, and public service-user benefits. \n94. \nBy  mainstreaming  modern  management  reforms  in  line  with  PSMFL,  the  program  will  help \nincrease  public  sector  capacity.  Enhanced  efficiency  will  lead  to  lower  administrative \nexpenditures  as  well  as  improved  service  delivery.  The  program  will  directly  help  reduce  the \npressures on the budget through pension reforms and administrative consolidation. \n \n95. \nAdministrative  and  Financial  Management  Reforms.  By  instituting  measures  for \nsound strategic planning on output delivery, GRP-II will help define the role of each public sector \nagency,  and  cost  the  outputs  so  that  entity  budgets  can  be  formulated  accurately.  While \nprovinces  have  derived  most  of  their  revenues  through  resource  transfers  from  the  center, \ndetailed ex ante or ex post financial reports have not been required. PSMFL requires all entities \nto  prioritize  and  formulate  their  medium-term  financial  needs,  unlike  before  when  ad  hoc \ndemands were placed on the center, and to submit complete financial statements at the end of \nthe budget cycle, presenting all relevant information on revenues and expenditures. GRP-II will \nprovide  extensive  policy  and  capacity-building  support  for  PSMFL\u2019s  financial  management \nreforms. GRP-II will institutionalize oversight arrangements at the highest level by establishing \nthe AG\u2019s office at MOFE,  and  at  the  level  of  the  spending  units  by  setting  up  internal  control \nunits.  These  and  the  financial  and  performance  audits  will  help  enhance  transparency  and \naccountability,  besides  cutting  expenditures  through  improved  internal  controls.  As  GRP-II will \nprimarily  focus  on  health,  education,  and  social  welfare  and  labor,  the  reforms  will  release \nscarce resources to improve the quality and quantity of public services in these sectors. \n \n96. \nEnhancing  Fiscal  Sustainability.  GRP-II  aims  to  enhance  fiscal sustainability. While \nPSMFL  requires  strategic  planning,  output,  performance,  and  financial  management  reforms, \nequally critical are policy reforms in certain key areas such as social security. GRP-II measures \nwill  strengthen  the  pension  system  by  gradually  eliminating  early  retirement  privileges  and  ad \nhoc increases in pensions, and by equalizing the retirement ages for men and women. These \nmeasures will benefit the central budget in the long run and help enhance fiscal sustainability. \nLocal  administrative  consolidation  measures  will  enhance  economies  of  scale  in  service \ndelivery.  \n \nB. \n \n97. \nPoverty Impact. Appendix 9 presents the poverty impact assessment. Subprogram 1 is \nnot  expected  to  have  any  adverse  social  impact  or  negative  consequences  for  the  poor.  By \ntargeting  public  sector  administration  and  financial  management  reforms  in  education,  health, \nand social welfare, GRP-II will ensure that the scare resources are utilized well. Subprogram 2 \nadministrative consolidation measures may have a short-term adverse impact on the poor and \nother  vulnerable  groups  run,  particularly  in  education,  health,  or  other  social  service  delivery. \nWhile  the  Government  aims  to  consolidate  provision  of  such  facilities  and  not  eliminate  them, \nthe  location  of  certain  segments  of  the  population  may  reduce  their  access  to  essential  social \nservices.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  formulate  appropriate  measures  to  mitigate  any \nnegative impact of such reforms on the poor. \n\nImpacts \n\n\f25 \n\nPotential Risks \n\n \n98. \nThe Government signed a poverty partnership agreement with the ADB in March 2000. \nTwo  annual  reviews  have  been  undertaken.  Over  The  Government  has  undertaken  several \nmeasures to promote the mainstreaming of poverty reduction in all development activities.  \n \n99. \nOther  Social  Impact.  Subprogram  1  will  not  lead  to  any  other  social  impact.  The \nadministrative  consolidation  measures  under  subprogram  2,  depending  on  their  nature  and \nscope,  may  lead  to  changes  in  the  configuration  and  provision  of  public  services.  If  areas \ntargeted  by  subprogram  2  suffer  decreased  access  to  facilities,  the  Government  will  institute \nmeasures to mitigate such outcome. \n \n100.  Environmental  Impact.  None  of  the  GRP-II  measures  are  likely  to  have  any  adverse \nimpact on the environment. \n \nC. \n \nInstitutional reforms, particularly in the public sector, are subject to various risks. In GRP, \n101. \nthe adoption of PSMFL was delayed due to several political risk factors. Subprogram 1 entails \nfewer risks as the policy and legal framework has already been adopted. In particular, since the \nGovernment has effectively campaigned on the need for the public sector management reforms, \nthe follow-up measures formulated under GRP-II are sufficiently credible. However, some of the \nmeasures in subprograms 1 and 2 are likely to face risks. \n \n102.  First,  the  implementation  of  PSMFL  has  to  be  efficiently  managed.  The  law  requires \nmajor  changes  in  entity-level management practices. For instance, performance management \nreforms  need  detailed  contractual  agreements  between  portfolio  ministries  and \nlocal \ngovernments, and budgetary bodies. ADB has emphasized gradual implementation, guided by \nlearning  by  doing,  to  ensure  that  capacity  constraints  within  the  civil  service  do  not  lead  to \nfatigue. Yet, a whole range of  performance  or  output  delivery  contracts  has  been  drawn  up. \nCentral  and  local  civil  servants,  while  recognizing  the  need  for  reforms,  have  expressed \nreservations  that  PSMFL  has  led  to  considerably  more  \u201cpaper  work.\u201d  Ongoing  TAs  as  well  as \nthe  proposed  TA  loan  for  CBGR  will  provide  significant  capacity-building  support  to  alleviate \ncapacity constraints, and assuage the concerns of civil servants. \n \n103.  Second,  pension  reform  anywhere  is  complex  as  it  involves  difficult  policy  choices, \nincluding  elimination  of  early  retirement  privileges,  which  may  affect  laborers  in  certain \nindustries.  However,  the  Government  recognizes  that  the  pension  system  will  face  serious \nfinancing  problems  unless  its  generous  provisions  are  changed.  Significant  advisory  support \nhas  been  provided  to  analyze  various  options,  guided  by  sound  actuarial  modeling.  Based  on \nthis, MSWL has drafted guidelines on social security reforms. Subject to cabinet endorsement of \nthese guidelines, the Government will initiate the drafting of necessary legal amendments. \n \n104.  Third, measures relating to administrative consolidation do carry considerable risks. The \nGovernment has conducted a preliminary analysis of this area. Some stakeholders have been \nconsulted,  although  their  acceptance  of  or resistance to the reform measures can be gauged \nonly  when  the  Government  finalizes  its  concept  paper  and  holds  well-structured consultations \nwith  local  citizens\u2019  representative  assemblies.  The  Government  is  confident  that  the  much-\nneeded  reforms  can  be  facilitated  if  consolidation  measures  are  designed  gradually  with  local \ninputs. \n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n105.  Fourth,  political  risks  are  associated  with  any  program  of  this  nature.  In  particular, \nMongolia will go for parliamentary elections in mid-2004. The present Government may not want \nto undertake any serious reforms just before or after the elections. Short-term concerns of local \ngovernments  with  regard  to  implementing  PSMFL  and  their  resistance  to  administrative  or \nstructural changes may prevail over any long-term need for public sector reforms. Two factors \nmay  cushion  overall  political  risks.  First,  the  Government  and  the  Parliament  have  been  fully \ncommitted to public sector reforms. Despite a major change in the Government in 2000, reforms \nwere  implemented  in  a  fairly  smooth  manner.  It  is  also  in  the  Government\u2019s  and  Parliament\u2019s \nbest  interest  to  ensure  that  the  PSMFL-related  follow-up  measures  are  implemented  well. \nSecond,  the  cluster  program  modality  gives  the  Government  greater  flexibility  than  otherwise \npossible.  While  it  defines  the  broad  policy  framework,  the  Government  can  formulate  the \nspecific  reform  measures  over  a  period,  based  on  the  outcomes  of  subprogram  1 \nimplementation. \n \n\nVIII.  ASSURANCES \n\n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n106. \nassurances, which will also be incorporated in the legal documents, that it will do the following: \n \n\nFulfill  all  the  conditions  specified  in  the  policy  matrix  to  release  the  tranches  of \nthe  program  loan  and  will  furnish  ADB  with  copies  of all documents evidencing \ncompliance with such conditions. \nEnsure  that  all  the  policies  adopted  and  actions  taken  as  described  in  the \nprogram  framework  and  the  development  policy  letter  continue  in  effect  during \nand after program implementation. \nKeep  ADB  informed  of,  and  exchange  views  with  ADB  on,  the  progress, \nproblems,  and  constraints  encountered  during  GRP-II  implementation  and  on \ndesirable changes to overcome or mitigate such problems and constraints. \nKeep ADB informed of policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral aid \nagencies that have implications for GRP-II implementation, provide ADB with the \nopportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals, and ensure that ADB\u2019s \nviews are considered before such proposals are finalized. \nEstablish a steering committee for GRP-II within one month of loan effectiveness. \nImplement  the  TA  loan  on  time  and  efficiently  so  that  the  program  loan \nrequirements will be met as stipulated. \n\n(vii)  Use  the  counterpart  funds  to  finance  the  adjustment  costs  of  implementing \nreforms as envisaged under GRP-II, except as ADB may otherwise agree. \n\n \n\nIX. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n107. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  program  cluster  concept,  program  loan  and  technical \nassistance loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB  and recommend that the \nBoard approve \n \n\nthe program cluster concept of $25,500,000 equivalent for the Second Phase of \nthe Governance Reform Program in Mongolia; \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 9,699,000 to \nMongolia  for  subprogram  1  of  the  Second  Phase  of  the  Governance  Reform \nProgram, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n\fof 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term \nof  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nLoan Agreement presented to the Board; and \n\n(iii) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 1,437,000 to \nMongolia  for  technical assistance for capacity building for governance reforms, \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Technical \nAssistance Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n\n27 \n\n \n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n \n\n \n8 September 2003 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n \n\n28\n\nSUPPORT FROM FUNDING AGENCIES FOR GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC SECTOR \nREFORMS IN MONGOLIA \n \n\n1. \ngovernance and public sector reforms. \n\nThe following matrix shows donor-funded technical assistance (TA) and loan projects in \n\nSupport from Donors \nWorld Bank \n \n\nInfrastructure  modernization \n\n\u2022  Fiscal  Reform  TA  loan  ($5  million,  since \nof \nfinancial \nIt  also \ntax \n\n1998). \ntreasury \nmanagement \nfocused  on  debt  management  and \nadministration reforms. \n\ninformation  systems. \n\ngovernment \n\nand \n\n\u2022  Economic  Capacity  Building  TA  Credit  ($8 \nmillion,  proposed \nfor  approval).

Among\nin  the  first  half  of  the\nthe  transition  economies,  Mongolia  achieved \nfollowing  the  dismantling  of  the ,command  system.  The  decline  in  economic\n1990s,  immediately \nin  a  span  of  4  years  (GDP  grew  by  2.3%  and  6.3%  in  1994  and  1995\nfall  was  reversed \nin\nrespectively).  However, \ncountry'  economy  have  also  been  significant.  The  second  half  of  the  1990s  saw  a  building  up\nexpenditures  stemming  from  lack  of  fiscal  discipline  at  various  levels.  As  a result,  we  recorded\nlarge  fiscal  deficits  until  1999,  at  12.5%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  1998  and  10.6%  of\nGDP  in  1999.\n\nthe  large  size  of  the  country  has  meant  that  the  resource  needs \n\nimpressive  performance \n\nlocation, \n\nA.\n\nThe Governance Reform Program\n\nreforms \n\nIn  order  to  enhance  fiscal  sustainability,  Mongolia  has  pursued  public  sector  reforms\n2. \nthe\nactively  since  the  mid-1990s,  with  support  from  multilateral  and  bilateral  donors,  including \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  World  Bank, \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  United\nNations  Development  Program,  USAID,  and  Government  of Japan,  among  others.  We  began  to\n(T A)  from  the\nfocus  on  governance \ndonors.  Our  initial  attempts  were  centered  on  short-term  measures  on  fiscal  management \nIn\n1998,  we  sought  ADB's  support \nin  undertaking  a  comprehensive  program  of  governance\nreforms.  Subsequently,  a  10-year  Governance  Reform  Program  (GRP)  was  formulated  and\nstarted  to  implement  by  the  Government  and  ADB  in  1999  to  reform  the  dysfunctional  public\nsector \nled  to  misallocation  of\nbudgetary  resources,  adversely  affected  operational  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  government\nservices,  and  undermined  public  and  private  sector  investments  and  growth,  and  efforts \nto\nreduce  poverty.\n\nin  1996,  with  a  series  of  technical  assistance \n\nin  Mongolia,  which  had  contributed \n\nto  large  fiscal  deficits, \n\n3. \nWhile the GRP was fonnulated and approved during the previous Government's tenure,\nmuch of its main mandate was implemented after the present Government came to power in\nmid-2000. The  implementation of  GRP has  achieved several significant milestones: the\n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n40\n\nforemost  being  the  enactment  of  the  Public  Sector  Management  and  Finance Law (PSMFL),\nwhich  places  Mongolia  ahead  of  the  other  countries  that  have  adopted  similar public  sector\nreforn1 measures.  The  extensive  consultative  process  leading  to the  enactment of  PSMFL is\nevidence in favor of stakeholder participation,  a key indicator in itself of good governance.\n\n4. \nGRP  also  supported  the  introduction  of  budget,  output  and  financial  management\nreforms on a pilot basis in 2 sets of agencies.  The primary focus was on showcasing the actual\nprocess  through  implementation  of  the  reform  measures  in  Custom  General  Administration\nStatistical  Organization\n(CGA),  General  Department  of  National  Taxa~5eIf1)~ational \n(NSO), State Audit  Board  (subsequently  renamed  as  Nationa~ Audit  Office - NAO) and  State\nService Council (SSC).  This was replicated on a selective basis in a set of \"bunch 2\" agencies,\nincluding  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economy  (MOFE);  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare  and  Labor;\nMinistry of  Justice  and  Home Affairs,  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture,  and Science;  Ministry of\nHealth;  Ministry  of  Environment;  State  Financial  Inspection  Department;  Environmental\nProtection  Agency;  Land  Administrative  Authority;  State  Meteorological Agency;  and  Clinical\nHospital No.1. In addition, GRP also focused  on two pilot aimags, Arhangi and Selenge, and the\nNalaikh District Administration,  a jurisdiction  within  Ulaanbaatar City, to pilot test administrative\nreforms at the provincial and sub-provincial levels.\n\n5. \nMr. President,  let me highlight some  of  the key achievements under GRP, to place the\ncurrent  reform  agenda  in  context.  To  improve  fiscal  management  and  provide  coherence  in\nexpenditure  planning,  the  Govemment  formulated  and  adopted  a  basic  fiscal  framework\nstatement  (FFS)  FFS  for  2001-2003.  The  FFS  aims  to develop  sustainable  fiscal  deficit\nforecasts over the medium term by ensuring  consistency with the strategic growth priorities and\nprojections,  and  external  and  domestic  borrowing  capacity.  The  Government  also  prepared\nguidelines for incorporating contingent liabilities in annual budgets and estimated accumulation\nof liabilities at the aggregate level and within the five bunch 1 agencies.\n\n6. \nTo bring about budgetary discipline, the GRP's focus was on process-oriented reforms\non a pilot basis for a limited number of budgetary bodies. Fuller application of the medium-term\nexpenditure framework (MTEF), work on which has been launched, and output-based budgeting\nmeasures will gradually result in integrating strategic priorities with overall expenditure planning\nat all levels of the Government. Also, recourse to off-budgetary funds and ad hoc transactions\nfrom the central to local governments or between budgetary bodies on a barter basis is being\nreduced. These and the other measures being adopted by the Government as part of the GRP\nin line with the financial and personnel management provisions of the PSMFL are likely to\nfacilitate expenditure discipline as well as revenue enhanceme~t in the medium term.\n\nAs  a  part  of  the  GRP,  the  Government  with  support  of  IMF took  initiatives  to  establish  a\n7. \nnew  treasury  single  account  (TSA)  system.  Under  Government  Decree  132  of  2001,  TSA  was\nintroduced  on  a  pilot  basis  in  11 public  sector  agencies.  The  TSA  system  involves  transference\nof  the  government  deposits  in the  banking  system  into  a  single  account  at  BOM  to centralize  all\ndisbursement  and  accounting \nresponsibilities  at  MOFE.  The  Government  has  closed  all  off.\nbudget  bank  accounts  held  by  the  ministries  and  public  sector  agencies.  A  comprehensive\nsurvey  of  all  extra  budgetary  funds  has  been  undertaken  to  facilitate  proper  accounting.  Based\nin  the  pilot  agencies,  effective  July  2002  the  TSA  has  been\non  the  successful  outcomes \nextended  to  cover  the  entire  budgetary  bodies.\n\nTo  provide  a  strategic  focus  to  the  process  of  budget  formulation  and  execution, \n\n8. \nGovernment  developed \nDevelopment  Guidelines  for  2002.  These  documents, \n\nthe\nthe  Development  Vision  for  2003-2005  and  the  Economic  and  Social\nin combination  with  the  Action  Plan  of  the\n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n41\n\nGovernment  of  Mongolia  for  2000-2004,  establish  the  strategic  priorities  to  guide  budget\nformulation  over  the  medium term.  To  better  implement  these  priorities,  a  3-year  rolling  PIP\nframework  has  been  formulated  as  an  integral  part  of  the  MTEF.  The  PIP  framework  is\nintegrated with  recurrent budgets to  ensure  adequate  maintenance  of the  capital  investments\nundertaken. The  PIP is being presented to external assistance agencies and finalized  annually\nbased on confirmed commitments.\n\nUnder  the  GRP,  the  Government  has  further  adopted  the  framework  for  a rolling  output-\nthe  development  of  a  system  of  forward  estimates, \n\n9. \nbased  MTEF,  including \nlinkages  between  planning  and  budgeting.  This  process  first  established  a system  for  integrating\nthe  requirements  of the  line  agencies  into  the  MTEF,  which  was  initially  piloted  in the  five  bunch\n1  agencies.  The  actual  process  of  deciding  on  the  top-down  and  bottom-up  elements  of  the\nMTEF  has  involved  a number  of  steps,  including:  (i)  national  articulation  of  fiscal  objectives  and\nstrategies;  (ii)  macroeconomic \nforecasting  and  assessment  of  resource  availability;  (iii) issuance\nof  indicative  sector  budgetary  ceilings  approved  by  COM;  (iv)  determination  of  subprograms  by\nministries  and  agencies;  (v)  negoti~tions  between  MOFE  and  line  ministries  over  the  programs\n(vi)  integration  of  forward  estimates  and  basic  formulation  of  the  MTEF;  and\nand  subprograms; \nin  the\n(vii)  submission \nline\nPublic  Expenditure  Management  Operational  Guidelines, \nministries,  and  other  budgetary  bodies.\n\nfor  Parliamentary  approval.  These  procedures  have  been  consolidated \n\nfor  use  by  MOFE, \n\nto  impr~~\n\nissued \n\n~\n\nfinancial  management \n\nTo  complement \ntreasury \n\n10. \nthe  TSA,  the  Government  has  taken  steps  to  introduce  a  modem  and\n(I)\nintegrated \nelaboration  and  control  of  budget  accounting  and  reporting;  (ii)  administration  of  the  treasury's\nbanking \nincluding\nmonitoring  of  accounts  payables  and  receivables,  asset  management,  and  inventory  control  and\nmanagement \nprotocols  are  being  developed  for  public  borrowings  and  for  investment  management \n\nreporting.  To  ensure  effective  control  of  risks,  procedures  and  corresponding\nfunctions.\n\ninformation  system,  which  aims \n\n(iii)  execution  of  core \n\nfinancial  management \n\ntransactions; \n\nto  integrate \n\nfunctions, \n\nto  the \n\nMoving \n\nimplementation  of  entity-level \n\n11. \nreforms  as  part  of  the  pilot  program\nto  these\nsupported  under  GRP  for  bunch  1  agencies,  we  have  catalyzed  ADB  T A  support \nagencies  to  build  capacity  through  a  number  of  workshops  as  well  as  hands-on  training  in the\nformulation  of  their  strategic  business  plans  (SBPs);  preparation  of  financial  statements;\nspecification  of  the  outputs  produced  by  each  agency  including  description,  quantity,  quality,\nto\nand  cost;  preparation  of  output-based \nperformance  contracts.\n\nforward  estimates;  and  formulation  of  and  adherence \n\nEx-post  financial  statements  were  prepared  for  all  bunch  1 entities  for  the  years  ending\n12. \nDecember  1998  and  December  1999,  and  audited  by  NAO.  A  key  step  in  this  process  was  the\nshift  in  emphasis  in  financial  accounting \nfrom  a  cash  basis  to  accrual  basis.  With  T A  support,\nAudit  Victoria  (the  Auditor  General's  Office  of the  State  of  Victoria,  Australia)  has  helped  assess\nfor  all  bunch  1 entities  and  verified  their  quality  as well  as  that  of  the  underlying\nthe  statements \nfinancial  control  systems.  All  the  agencies  were  trained  in  improved  public  sector  accounting\npolicies,  and  familiarized  with  the  format  and  content  of  revised  financial  statements  and  output-\n\ncosting  methodologies.\n\n13. \nThe entire bunch 1 and some of the key bunch 2 agencies and ministries also prepared\nforecast  financial  statements,  in  accordance  with  IAS. A  typical  forecast  financial  statement\nincludes a statement of  responsibility from the  general manager of the agency;  a statement of\nthe  accounting  policies adopted  and the forecasting  assumptions  employed;  a  balance  sheet\ncovering a 3-year planning horizon; a statement of the changes in the  net-worth position of the\n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n42\n\nagency over this period; and a statement of cash flows. Formulated in this manner, the medium-\nterm forecasts  for assets and liabilities will improve strategic budget planning.\n\n14. \nsaps  were  also prepared for all bunch  1 agencies  (for 2001-2003 and 2002-2004)  and\na  rough  format  for  11  bunch  2  (for  2002-2004)  agencies. A  typical  sap  includes  an  overall\nvision  statement,  the  strategic priorities,  outputs  planned for  the  period, forward  appropriation\nestimates and forecast financial statements, and a linkage between the functions of the agency\nand  the  overall  strategic  priorities  of  the  Government.  The  saps  provide  strategic  planning\ndirections and priorities to the budgeta~~~an.d \nfully integrate the output requirem.ents and\nthe  projections for  budget appropriation estimates..\"1n-terms of implementation, however, a key\nconstraint  has  been  the  difficulty  involved  in clearly aefining the  output to  be produced  at the\nentity  level,  particularly  in  agencies  responsible  for  policy  formulation  and  execution,  where\noutputs  may  not  be  tangible  or  immediately  evident  as  in  the  case  of  public  sector  entities\nresponsible for production of physical outputs.\n\nB.\n\nSetting the Stage for the Second Phase of Reforms\n\n15. \nGovernance  reforms are complex,  and generally involve a long-drawn process.  Having\ndescribed  the achievements thus far,  let me turn to the forward-looking agenda, which  is quite\nchallenging.  The  Government  considers  GRP  essentially as  a  pilot program.  It has  helped  to\nenhance  awareness  of  the  need  for  modernizing  public  sector  administration  and  financial\nmanagement.  Its implementation has prepared the groundwork for continuation of reforms.\n\n16. \nThe  PSMFL  is  effective  from  January  1, 2003  and  the  Government has  formulated  a\nsound  plan  to  implement  the  new  law  in  a  phased  manner  in  next  four  years.  The  PSMFL\napplies  to  all  levels  of  government  including  SOEs  and  provides  an  effective  framework  to\nregulate  all relations of responsibility and authority between the government organizations  and\nindividuals with regards to the preparation, approval, implementation and reporting of budgets,\noperational  and  personnel  management  in  budgetary  bodies,  and  budget  control  and  other\nresponsibility  systems. The objective is to  integrate strategic planning at all levels with  budget\nmaking  and  execution,  decentralize  decision  making through  sound  personnel  management\npractices and enhanced budget control, accountability and transparency mechanisms.\n\n17. \nThe  adoption  of the legal framework  gives a sound footing  to move forward.  Based on\nthe  lessons  learnt  from  the  Government's  initiatives  through  GRP  and  support  from  other\ndonors, let me outline a list of the priority areas for the Government:\n\n.\n\n.\n\nit  is  essential \n\nContinuous  capacity  enhancement  at all levels  ot  the  Government,  to  ensure  that\nthe  momentum  is  maintained  to  implement  PSMFL  in a well-sequenced  manner.\nMore  importantly, \nthat  a  \"hand-holding\"  process  is  necessary  at\nsome  levels  to  ensure  that  the  reform  objectives,  directives  and  measures  are\nclearly  understood. \nrecognizes  that  we  need  to\nadopt  a  leaming-by-doing  approach  to  reforms,  so  that  lessons  learnt  along  the\nway  can  be  incorporated \ninto  the  PSMFL  implementation  plan,  and  appropriate\nmid-course  corrections  can  be  allowed.\n\nIn  this  regard,  the  Government \n\nAn  integral  part  of  such  capacity  building  is  support  for  financial  management\nin\nreforms.  Based  on the  emphasis  on improving  fiscal  and  financial  transparency \nPSMFL, \nthat  financial  management  systems  are\nupgraded  within  the  Government  and  the  larger  public  sector.  A  key  component\nin  this  regard  is  to  establish  good  internal  control  and  audit  systems  within  the\n\nit  is  of  critical \n\nimportance \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n43\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nline  ministries  and  budgetary  agencies.  Equally  significant  is  the  need  for\nensuring  that  the  financial  and  performance  audit  requirements  outlined  in\nPSMFL are effectively  implemented.\n\nFiscal sustainability is  of  paramount importance. This is  the guiding concern\nbehind: (i) the whole govemance reform agenda; (ii) the Government's initiatives\nfor national economic development; (iii) its formulation of the Poverty Reduction\nStrategy Paper (PRSP), which has been effectively coordinated with all donors,\nand (iv) the  Government's efforts aimed at  reforms in  sever\"IMy=idtfediens\nunder the  Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) being implemented\nwith support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). \n\n!\n\nSpecific attention is needed in some areas to help pave the way for medium- and\nlong-term fiscal sustainability. We have identified 3 critical areas on which this\nGovernment would like to initiate reforms: (i) alleviating the fiscal pressures on\nthe budget stemming from the pension system; (ii) the need for reducing the\nmultiple layers of administrative controls at the lower tiers of governments, at the\naimag and soum levels; and (iii) strengthening of the civil service.\n\nThe present  Government has launched significant  reforms  in the above 3 areas\naimed at enhancing  fiscal sustainability. With ADS TA support, the Government\nhas  drafted  Social  Security  Reform  Guidelines,  which  incorporate  the  much-\nneeded reforms to increase retirement ages on a gradual basis.\n\nThe  PSMFL  is our  launch-pad  to  initiate  and  accelerate  civil  service  refonT1s, and\nthe Government  has been working closely with IMF I  World  Bank and ADB in this\narea.  Our  goal  is  to  eventually  have  in  place:  (i)  sound  wage  and  employment\n-  a  key\npolicies,  with \ningredient \ninfonT1ation system;\nand  (ii)  a  career-track,  perfonT1ance-oriented  civil  service  system  that  utilizes  tax\nin an efficient  manner  to  deliver  public  services  at  low costs.\npayers'  contributions \n\nfor  this  is  a  sound  human  resource  management \n\nequity  and  efficiency \n\nconsiderations \n\ntransparency, \n\nAdministrative  consolidation  measures  are  sensitive  and  complex.  Efforts  have\nbeen  underway  for  sometime  to  explore  various  avenues  for  consolidating  aimag\nand  soum  jurisdictions,  given  the  geographic  spread  of  Mongolia  and  the  high\ncosts  of  delivering  services.

On  SOE  reforms,  this\nGovernment  has  made  significant  advances.  For  example,  our  efforts  have  led to\nsome  of  the  largest  privatizations \nin  Mongolian  history,  with  the  sale  of  the  Trade\nand  Development  Bank  and  Agriculture  Bank  of  Mongolia.  Yet,  it is essential  that\ngovernance  measures  are  well  integrated  in  SOEs,  to  ensure  that  their  viability\ncan  be  enhanced  and  value  increased.\n\n\fAppendix 4\n\n44\n\n.\n\nThe Government has undertaken significant efforts with the support of  UNDP\nthrough the Good Governance for Human Security Program. A key initiative has\nbeen the establishment of the National Council on Anti-Corruption, which I am\nprivileged to chair.

It  will  primarily  advise  on  public  sector  financial  management  reforms,  principally  to \nensure  that  the  Government  can  implement  the  policy  conditions  agreed  upon  in  the  policy \nmatrix (Appendix 2) efficiently and on time. CBGR will also help design a software component to \nsupport financial management reforms, and adopt a system-based framework for output costing \nin all portfolio ministries and budgetary bodies. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nCBGR  will  use  53  person-months  of  international  consulting  services,  comprising  the \nfollowing: (i) advisor to the accountant general (AG) for 18 person-months, intermittently over 36 \nmonths;  (ii)  advisory  services  to  the  National  Audit  Office  (NAO)  for  18  person-months, \nintermittently  over  36  months,  to  work  with  18  NAO  auditors  to  implement  the  policy  matrix \nconditions; (iii) Public Sector Management and Finance Law (PSMFL) strategic planning advisor \nfor  13  person-months  to  review  internal  functions  in  selected  budgetary  entities;  (iv)  an  asset \nvaluation expert for 2 person-months to help the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE) draft \nasset  valuation  standards;  (v)  systems  and  management  information  system  (MIS)  expert  to \ndevelop  a  software  program  for  NAO  to  conduct  computer-based  financial  statement  and \nperformance audits and help modernize the output costing in all portfolios for 2 person-months. \nAbout  120  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  support  will  also  be  procured  in  the above \nareas,  including  project  management.  All  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  be \nrecruited on an individual basis, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. \n \n3. \nThe following outlines the advisors\u2019 terms of reference (TORs).  As government advisors, \nthe  long-term  consultants  must  be  flexible  to  be  able  to  meet  a  range  of  demands.

Yes \n \n\nA. \n \nSector identified as a national priority in country poverty \nanalysis? Yes \n \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Mongolia: \n \nLack of fiscal responsibility has been a primary factor in large public expenditures and low public sector efficiency. The \nproposed  program  cluster  aims  to  introduce  a  number  of  measures  to  improve  public  expenditure  management; \nincrease fiscal and financial transparency; and enhance the quality of service delivery in health, education, and social \nwelfare sectors. \n \n \nB. \n \n \nAnalysis: \n  \n1. \nGood governance is an integral part of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategy to reduce poverty and is \nessential  for  efficient  management  of  a  developing  country's  scarce  public  resources.  The  Second  Phase  of  the \nGovernance  Reform  Program  (GRP-II)  seeks  to  advance  the  reform  initiatives  for  public  sector  management,  i.e., \nbring in strategic focus, efficiency and effectiveness, transparency and predictability, accountability, and participation, \nwhich  GRP  began.  GRP-II  aims  to  enhance  the  capacity  of  public  sector  institutions  to  enable  them  to  generate \nrevenues for public services, and provide a sound regulatory environment to promote public interest, competition, and \noverall  governance.  The  program  will  directly  benefit  the  poor  by  improving  delivery  of  social  and  other  services. \nIndirectly  in  the  longer  term,  the  program  will  help  achieve  macro  stability,  improve  governance,  supplement  private \nsector development, and, hence, help boost economic growth and control inflation. GRP-II thus has strong linkages to \npoverty reduction. \n \n2. \nThe  Government  remains  committed,  and  is  designing  a  strategy,  to  reduce  poverty  on  the  basis  of \nevaluation  of  current  economic  and  social  conditions.  Since  2000  Mongolia  has  been  implementing  the  national \nprogram on good governance for human security (GGHS). Consensus among policymakers and stakeholders is now \nessential.  GGHS  facilitates  policy  focus,  coherence,  and  sustainability  for  poverty  reduction  programs  by  enlisting \nsupport from all stakeholders, state administration, related organizations, media and press, private sector, and civil \nsociety. \n \nThe  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  (PRSP)  states  that  the  Government  is  committed  to  formulating \n3. \nmacroeconomic  policies  in  the  context  of  a  medium -term  framework  to  support  rapid,  private  sector-led growth and \npoverty  reduction.  The  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility,  being  implemented  with  support  of  the  International \nMonetary Fund (IMF), aims to create a stable macroeconomic environment conducive to high private investment and \ngradually  raising  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  to  4\u20136%  per  annum  with  a  single-digit  inflation  rate.  The \nGovernment's  structural  reform  program  will be guided by the need to strengthen the institutions of macroeconomic \nmanagement. In the fiscal area, the highest priority has been given to reforms to improve transparency, accountability, \nand enforcement mechanisms in budget implementation and to ensure more efficient allocations of public expenditure. \nBanking sector reforms will aim to consolidate the shift to a market-oriented system of indirect monetary management, \nstrengthen  bank  supervision,  and  accelerate  privatization  of  state-owned  banks.  Efforts  will  be  stepped  up  to \nrestructure  and  privatize  nonfinancial  public  enterprises,  establish  a  sound  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  and \nmaintain  an  open  trade  and  investment  regime.  These  measures  are  expected  to  enhance  opportunities  and \nincentives for private participation, including by foreign investors. \n \n4. \nThus,  in  line  with  the  PRSP,  the  Government  considers  the  next  10  years  as  the  phase  to  improve  its \nstrategic  focus,  make  delivery  of  public  services  more  effective  and  efficient,  and  the  social  security system more \nviable;  and  to  establish  better  accountability  and  transparency  mechanisms.  More  effective  and  accountable \ninstitutions  will  make  sound  economic  policies  and  raise  public  confidence,  promote  investment  and  economic \ndevelopment, and increase  living  standards.  The  Government  successfully  implemented  GRP  over  1999\u20132002 with \nADB\u2019s support, and has requested for a follow-up second phase to further the reforms to develop nascent institutions \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n59 \n\nParticipation Process \n\nADB\u2019s support, and has requested for a follow-up second phase to further the reforms to develop nascent institutions \nand strengthen public sector management to improve efficiency and accountability. GRP-II supports the Government\u2019s \npoverty reduction strategy and is in line with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy. The Government is also formulating a \nseries of poverty reduction strategy credits (PRSCs) with World Bank support to help implement the PRSP. \n \nGRP-II is likely to benefit the poor and socially vulnerable through direct as well as indirect channels. Benefits \n5. \nwill be enhanced transparency and less public expenditure, which will improve service delivery and access and reduce \nprices. While some measures may have short-term adverse effects, these are likely to be more than compensated for \nby the significant medium - and long-term overall benefits. \n \n \nC. \n \n6.          Stakeholder analysis? Yes. The proposed program cluster forms a part of the 10-year governance reform road \nmap  developed  under  GRP.  As  part  of  GRP,  Parliament  adopted  the  Public  Sector  Management  and  Finance  Law \n(PSMFL)  following  5  years  of  extensive  stakeholder  consultations.  The  proposal  allows  for  continued  significant \nstakeholder involvement. \n \nParticipation strategy? Yes. The program allows for a participatory approach to formulating the specific measures with \nregard to pension reforms and administrative consolidation. \n \nD. Gender and Development \n  \n7.            Strategy  to  maximize  impacts  on  women:  As  part  of  its  PRSCs,  the  World  Bank  is  formulating  a  gender \ndevelopment strategy in Mongolia. Given that the PRSCs\u2019 focus is on improving public expenditure management, it is \nproposed that the strategy paper be reviewed by ADB, gender-linkages to the overall thrust of PSMFL identified, and \nmeasures formulated as part of subprogram 2 if needed. \n \n8.        Gender plan prepared? No. The proposed measures under the program cluster will not have any  differential \neffects between men and women. \n \n \nE. \n\nSocial Safeguards and other Social Risks \n \n \nSignificant/ \nNonsignificant/ \nNone \nNone \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n \nNo negative impacts to be mitigated \n\nNone \n\nNo negative impacts to be mitigated \n\nResettlement \n\n \nIndigenous Peoples  \n \n\nLabor \n\nNonsignificant \n\nAffordability \n\nNonsignificant \n\n \n\n \n\nthe \n\nimpact  assessment  below  discusses \n\nThe  poverty \nchannels through which labor may be affected. \nSubprogram 1 is not likely to have any immediate impact on \naccess  or  affordability  of  public  services.

Poverty increased \n1. \nduring the last decade of transition as a result of sudden withdrawal from the socialist system in \nthe  face  of  weak  alternative  public  institutions  and  policies  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  the \ntransition. As economic growth declined, public access to basic education, health services, and \nsocial  conditions  deteriorated,  particularly  in  early  part  of  the  transition.  The  Government  thus \nlaunched reforms such as trade and price liberalization, a floating exchange rate, privatization of \npublic  sector  assets,  and  tight  monetary  and  fiscal  policies.  Growth  in  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP) recovered to 2.3% in 1994 and has remained positive since then. Hyperinflation declined \nto  66.3%  in  1994,  averaged  27  percent  in  1995\u20131999  and  further  declined  to  8.1  percent  by \n2000. Unemployment has also gradually decreased since 1996. \n \n2. \nThe  1998  living  standards  measurement  survey  showed  that  about  36  percent  of  the \nMongolian population was poor. While poverty appeared to have stabilized over 1995-2000, the \ndepth  and  severity  of  poverty  increased  and  inequality  worsened.  Various  surveys  indicated \nconcentration  of  poverty  in  four  population  categories:  single-parent  households  with  many \nchildren;  households  with  less  than  100  heads  of  livestock;  the  uneducated;  and  vulnerable \ngroups (elderly, disabled, street children, and orphans). The survey confirms a direct correlation \nbetween poverty and unemployment, and indicates that cost for education and health services \nis  a  heavy  burden  on  the  poor.  Migration  to  urban  areas  has  been  substantial  since  1996, \nconcentrating poverty in urban areas. \n \n3. \nThe economy has slowed down in recent years due to several reasons. Several external \nfactors adversely affected the economy: harsh weather (dzuds, severe winters followed by dry \nsummers);  onslaught  of  the  foot-and-mouth  disease;1  and  sharp  fall  in  prices  of  main  export \nearners  (copper,  cashmere,  and  gold).  Acute  shortage  of  management  skills  has  inhibited \nprivate sector development.  Privatization  caused  a  large  number  of  plant  closures,  job  losses, \nand disruptions in production and supply, resulting in revenue shortfalls, which, combined with \ninefficient and rising public expenditures, led to large reinforcing deficits and deteriorating public \nservice  delivery.  The  recent  economic  slowdown  in  2000-01  appears  to  have  exacerbated \npoverty.  \n \n4. \nIn summary, while Mongolia has made substantial progress in the transition to a market \neconomy  over  the  last  10  years,  serious  challenges  remain  to  be  overcome  to  raise  living \nstandards  and  reduce  poverty.  The  economy  has  recorded  a  positive  growth  for  seven \nconsecutive  years,  and  inflation  has  been  brought  down  to  single  digits.  The  economy  is  now \nmore open, citizens have the right and opportunity to set and pursue their economic goals, and \na  regulatory  base  for  a  free  and  competitive  environment  for  private  enterprise  has  been \ncreated. Yet, the country\u2019s economic base is narrow and highly vulnerable to external shocks. \nFinancial intermediation remains fragile. Given the relatively small market, the Government and \nstate-owned  enterprises  wield  a  lot  of  influence.  These  factors  weaken  private  sector \nconfidence,  especially  of  foreign  investors.  The  public  sector  is  not  well  managed,  which, \ncombined  with  excessive  government  controls,  has  led  to  deteriorating  access  and  quality  of \nbasic  services,  such  as  education,  health,  etc.  Reforms  in  governance  and  public  sector \nmanagement are thus the key to development and poverty reduction. \n \n                                                 \n1   Animal husbandry is the leading industry, and the disease killed a large number of cattle in the last couple of years. \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n61 \n\nPolicy Actions and their Impact on Poverty and Other Social Dimensions \n\n2.  \n \n5. \nThe  first  component  of  the  Second  Phase  of  the  Governance  Reform  Program  (GRP-\nII)\u2014to  formulate  a  sound  implementation  framework  to  guide  public  sector  governance \nreforms\u2014seeks  to  widen  and  deepen  the  reforms  initiated  as  part  of  the  Public  Sector \nManagement  and  Finance  Law  (PSMFL)  to  the  whole  Government.  These  reforms  relate  to \nrevamping  planning,  budget,  and  expenditures;  introducing  a  performance  management \nsystem;  adopting  accounting  and  auditing  systems  in  line  with  international  standards;  and \nbringing  in  more  transparent  reporting  systems.  The  framework  proposes  to  adopt  PSMFL-\nrelated  guidelines  and  legislation,  launch  process-related  capacity-building initiatives, institute \nexpenditure  control  measures,  and  set  up  accountable  institutional  structures.  These  reforms \nhave obvious links to good governance and poverty reduction and will directly benefit the poor \nby giving them improved access to quality public services. Indirect long-term benefits are also \nsignificant.  Transparent  use  of  public  funds  and  effective  delivery  of  key  services  will  improve \npublic  participation,  boost  private  sector  development,  accelerate  economic  growth,  and \nincrease jobs. Good growth and employment prospects will have a favorable impact on public \nsector finances and help reinforce growth, control inflation, and reduce poverty (Table 1).  \n \n6. \nimpact, including on indigenous people or any other vulnerable groups. \n \n\nOther  than  the  impacts  identified  below,  GRP-II  is  not  likely  to  have  any  other  social \n\nTable A9.1: Poverty Impact of Public Sector Governance Reforms \n\n \nType of Effect \nChannel  \n\nLabor \n\nDirect Effect \n\nIndirect Effect \n\nMacro Effect \n\nEffect on the \nNonpoor \nEfficiency will be \nimproved. \n\nTransparent use of \npublic funds to \ndeliver key services \nwill improve public \nparticipation, boost \nprivate sector \ndevelopment, and \nlead to better \neconomic growth \nand more jobs. \n\nIf public sector \nefficiency \ntranslates into \nwage increases, \nit may encourage \nmigration to cities \nand raise private \nsector wages, \nthereby adding to \nurban \nunemployment \nand social \nsecurity budgets \nin the short term. \n\nIn general, \nimprovements in \nadministrative \nprocesses will make \npublic sector human \nresources more \nefficient. \nRationalization of \nemployment is likely in \nsome entities following \na close scrutiny of \nexpenditures under \nthe newly developed \nstrategic business \nplans, output \ncontracts, and \nperformance \nmanagement \nagreements. However, \nbased on the \noutcomes in the \nrecent government-\ninitiated organizational \nrestructuring, \nrationalized labor has \nbeen redeployed \nthrough contracting-\n\n\fout-type reforms. \nHence, the net effect \nis not likely to be \nnegative, even in the \nshort term. \nPositive. By \nenhancing efficiency \nin service delivery, the \nproposed activities will \nreduce overall \nexpenditures and \neventually lower \nprices.  \nAccess to public \nservices will improve \nbecause of adequate \nfunding and effective \nservice delivery. \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n \n\n62 \n\nPrices \n\nAccess for \nthe Poor  \n\nTransfers \nCrucial \nAssumptions \n\nTotal Net \nEffect \nNarrative \n\nPrices will be \nstable.  \n\nAccess will \nimprove. \n\nPrivate sector \ndevelopment and \nbetter growth will \nhelp stabilize \ngovernment \nfinances and, hence, \nprices. \n\nPSMFL, with a \nstable \nmacroeconomic \nenvironment, will \nenhance growth \nprospects and \nimprove economic \nopportunities and \naccess for the poor.  \n \n\n \n\nNo change \nReform is successful and not subjected to institutional capture, and expenditure \nincreases in program implementation are matched by savings in administrative \nexpenditure. \nPositive \n\n \n\nThe implementation framework attempts to widen and deepen PSMFL-related reforms \nto  the  whole  Government.  These  include  revamping  planning,  budgeting,  and \nexpenditure  management;  introducing  a  performance  management  system;  adopting \naccounting  and  auditing  systems  in  line  with  international  standards;  and  bringing  in \ntransparent  reporting  systems.  The  framework  proposes  to  adopt  PSMFL-related \nguidelines  and  legislation,  launch  process-related  capacity-building initiatives, institute \ncertain  expenditure  control  measures,  and  set  up  more  accountable  institutional \nstructures.  These  reforms  have  obvious  direct  links  to  good  governance  and  poverty \nreduction.  \n\n \n7. \nPSMFL  financial  governance  norms  propose  to  establish  institutional  structures  for \nfinancial management; adopt accrual-based accounting, asset valuation, and auditing according \nto  internationally  accepted  standards;  and  strengthen  public  sector  auditing  and  inspection \nsystems  and  the  private  sector  accounting  and  auditing  regulatory  framework.  These  norms \npropose  to  create  certain  key  missing  roles;  staff  them  with  qualified  people;  reinforce  certain \nfor  accounting,  valuation,  audits,  and \ninter-institutional  relations;  prescribe  standards \ninspections;  and  incorporate  necessary  changes  in  related  laws.

While \nexpenditures may \nincrease due to the \ninitiation of new \nstructures, enhanced \ntransparency and \nimproved internal \ncontrols are likely to \nlower expenditures \nand, hence, prices.  \nThe quality of public \nservices in education, \nhealth, and social \nwelfare will improve \nbecause of better \ninternal controls, and \nhigher expenditure \nsavings, which can be \ndiverted to poverty \nreduction initiatives. \nNo change \nImplementation is effective, needed skills become available, retraining is successful, \nand expenditure increases are matched by savings elsewhere. \nPositive \n\nMacro effects will \nreinforce and \nimprove access to   \npublic services.  \n\nAccess will \nimprove. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  financial  governance  norms  propose  to  establish  sound  institutional  structures  for \neffective  financial  management,  adopt  accrual-based  accounting,  asset  valuation,  and \nauditing  according  to  internationally  accepted  standards,  strengthen  public  sector \nauditing  and  inspection  systems,  and  strengthen  the  regulatory  framework  for  private \nsector  accounting  and  auditing.  These  norms  propose  to  create  certain  key  missing \nroles;  staff  them  with  qualified  people;  reinforce  certain  inter-institutional  relations; \nprescribe  standards  for  accounting,  valuation,  audits,  and  inspections;  and  amend \nrelated laws as needed.  \n\n \n8. \nThe second component to improve fiscal sustainability has two aims. The first is to make \nthe  social  security  system  more  sustainable.  Overall  social  security  payments,  particularly \npensions,  have  been  rising  fast  because  of  early  retirements  and  generous  benefits.  This, \ntogether  with  ad  hoc,  improperly  indexed  increases  in  pensions,  threatens  the  system\u2019s \nmedium-term  fiscal  stability.  Hence,  GRP-II  proposes  a  gradual  increase  in  retirement  ages, \n\n\felimination  of  early  retirement  privileges,  and  indexation  of  pensions.  These  provisions may \nhave  a  short-run  negative  impact  on  some  of  the  poor  but  will  benefit  most  by  making  social \nsecurity more sustainable. Credible social security institutions will serve the poor well and have \nbeneficial macro effects on saving, growth, inflation, and poverty reduction. \n \n\nTable A9.3: Poverty Impact of Strengthening the Social Security System  \n\nAppendix 9 \n \n\n64 \n\n \nType of Effect \nChannel  \n\nLabor \n\nPrices \n\nAccess for \nthe Poor \n\nCrucial \nAssumptions \nTotal Net \nEffect \nNarrative \n\nPositive \n\n \n\nSustainable and \nwell-funded social \nsecurity systems will \nensure effective \nparticipation of the \nvulnerable, generate \nresources for \ninvestment, and \nimprove growth and \nemployment \nprospects. \nHigher growth will \nhelp stabilize public \nfinances and prices. \n\nEffect on the \nNonpoor \nSocial security \nand jobs will \nimprove. \n\nPrices will be \nstable. \n\nImproved access  \n\nDirect Effect \n\nIndirect Effect \n\nMacro Effect \n\nThe reform will \nimprove real \nwages by \nreducing risks of \nthe social \nsecurity system. \n\nThere may be some \nshort-term effect on \nthe currently \nunemployed. \nHowever, the \nemployed will \nsignificantly benefit \nfrom ensured income \nsupport during \nretirement. \n\nStable funding of \nsocial security and \nother public services \nwill improve the \naccess for poor.  \n\nConsumption will \nbe smoothed, \nenabling prices to \nrise gradually. \n\nSocial security \nbenefits for the \nneedy will be \nimproved by \nreducing the risk \nof default. \n\nProper indexation of \nwages and pensions \nwill moderate the \nimpact on consumer \nprices, unlike the \ncurrent system of ad \nhoc increases.  \nFor the unemployed, \nthere may be a short-\nterm negative impact \nuntil better \nmacroeconomic \nprospects help create \nmore jobs. However, \nindirect job creation is \nmuch more \nsustainable than the \npresent system. \nEffects will be \nnegative in the short \nterm but significantly \npositive in the future \nthrough better growth \nopportunities. \nPhasing in of reform is based on careful assessment of flows. \n\nThe pension \nsystem will \nbecome more \nsecure. \n\nEffect will be \npositive.  \n\nThe  social  security  bill,  particularly  pensions,  has  been  rising  fast  because  of  early  \nretirements  and  lavish  benefits  despite  incomplete  and  ad  hoc  indexation  of  pensions, \nwhich threatens the whole system. Hence, gradual increases in retirement age, a more \nsystematic  indexation,  and  partial  funding  of  pensions,  along  with  some  key  capacity-\nbuilding steps for this transition, are proposed to make the system more sustainable. \n\nTransfers \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n65 \n\nGRP-II  aims  to  consolidate  central  and  local  administration  to  streamline  public  sector \n9. \nadministration  and  strengthen  resource  management.  Public  expenditures  have  risen  rapidly \ndue  to  administrative  proliferation  at  different  government  levels.  The  proposed  consolidation \nmeasures  under  GRP-II  aim  to  achieve  economies  of  scale  and  strengthen  public  sector \nresource  management.  The  purpose  is  to  conserve  public  resources and use them in priority \nareas.  Consolidation  measures  thus  naturally  tie  in  with  the  effectiveness  of  government \ninstitutions  and  reinforce  macro  linkages  for  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  as  in  the  first \ncomponent. While there may be some negative outcomes in the short term, these are likely to \nbe compensated for by beneficial outcomes in the medium and long term. Significant follow-up \nmeasures will be undertaken in subprogram 2 of GRP-II. \n \n\nTable A9.4: Poverty Impact of Central and Local Administrative Consolidation  \n \n\nDirect Effect \n\nIndirect Effect \n\nMacro Effect \n\nType of Effect \nChannel  \n\nLabor \n\nEffect on the \nNonpoor \nEmployment \nopportunities will \nimprove. \n\nIntra- and \ninterprovincial \nconsolidation \nmeasures will \nprovide greater \neconomic \nopportunities in \nlocal areas and \nreduce out-\nmigration to \ncities. \n\nConsolidation will \nhelp save public \nresources, which will \nenable more \neffective service \ndelivery, promote \nmacro stability, and \nreinforce growth and \nemployment.  \n\nPrices \n\nLower prices on \naverage.  \n\nLower prices on \naverage.  \n\nAs non-core services \nare likely to be \ncontracted out, which \nmight have a short-\nterm negative effect \non labor, there will be \nsignificant \nopportunities for \nredeployment.
