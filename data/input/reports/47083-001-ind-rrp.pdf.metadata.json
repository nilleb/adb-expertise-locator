The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n2. \nThe  MFF  involves  a  sovereign  loan  of  $700  million  to  IIFCL  to  support  renewed \ngovernment  efforts  to  accelerate  infrastructure  growth  through  increased  private  sector \ninvestment given competing pressures for fiscal resources.  \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nImportance  of  infrastructure  financing  for  development. India\u2019s infrastructure deficit \nis  arguably  the  critical  development  challenge  facing  the  country.  The  weak  state  of \ninfrastructure  represents  a  drag  on  higher,  sustainable  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth \nreflecting  supply-side  constraints.  It  impedes  economic  development  and  poverty  reduction \nefforts.1 To meet the growing aspirations of its citizens including for better service delivery, India \nwill  have to identify  new means  to  expand  infrastructure financing given  limits  on fiscal  space, \nexternal  commercial  borrowing,  and  bank  balance  sheets.  The  solution  to  overcoming  these \nlimits  lies  in  part  on  increasingly  leveraging  private  capital.  To  achieve  the  targeted  real  GDP \ngrowth  rate  of  8.4%  in  the  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan  (2012\u20132017),  the  government  estimates \ninfrastructure  investment  of  about  $1  trillion  will  be  required.  Of  this,  about  47%  is  targeted  to \ncome from private capital as compared with about 38% under the Eleventh Plan and 22% under \nthe Tenth Plan. 2  \n \nInfrastructure  financing  gap.  The  infrastructure  investment  funding  gap  during  the \n4. \nTwelfth Five-Year Plan is estimated to be about $113 billion. The government projects sourcing \nthe shortfall from the private sector.3 \n \nInfrastructure challenges across sectors. According to the 2012 report of the Reserve \n5. \nBank  of  India  (RBI),  the  total  fixed  investment  by  large  firms  in  new  projects,  led  mainly  by \ninfrastructure and metals, which were sanctioned financial support during FY2011, dropped by \n46% compared with the previous year. Investments in infrastructure during FY2012 declined by \n52%.4  The  unfavorable investment  climate  includes  increasing  losses  of public  sector  utilities, \ndelays in legal and environmental clearances for roads, and constraints in availability of finance \nto project companies that are already leveraged and unable to raise more debt in the absence \nof fresh equity capital including quasi equity. All these factors contribute to the recent slowdown \nin infrastructure investment.5  \n \n\n                                                \n1  According  to  the  World  Economic  Forum\u2019s  Global  Competitiveness  Report,  India  ranked  82nd  of  142  countries \n\nduring 2010\u20132013. \n\n2  According  to  the  interim  report  of the  high-level  committee on  financing  of  infrastructure of  August  2012,  GDP  is \n\nassumed to grow at 7% in FY2012, 8% in FY2013, and 9% for the remainder of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan. \n\n3  A  detailed  estimate  on  the  infrastructure  financing  gap  is  provided  in  the  Framework  Financing  Agreement \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n4  Reserve Bank of India. 2012. Reserve Bank of India Annual Report 2011\u201312. Mumbai. \n5   Sector Assessment (Summary): Infrastructure Financing (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n\n2). \n\n \n\n\f2     \n \n\n \n\nFinancing  challenges.  To  date,  the  banking  sector  has  been  the  main  driver  of \n6. \ninfrastructure  financing  in  India.  However,  it  is  facing  increasing  challenges  in  addressing  the \ninfrastructure\u2013financing  gap.  First,  high  credit  expansion  for  infrastructure  in  recent  years  has \nresulted  in  an  increasing  asset\u2013liability  mismatch  for  banks.  Second,  banks  are  approaching \nexposure  limits  to  borrowers  and  infrastructure  sectors.  Third,  the  asset  quality  of  banks \ndeteriorated  considerably  during  the  half  year  ending  September  2012  with  the  gross  (net) \nnonperforming advances ratio for all banks rising sharply to 3.6% (1.7%) from 2.9% (1.2%) as of \nend  March  2012.  Should  the  slowdown  in  GDP  growth  persist  and  interest  rates  remain  at \ncurrent levels, estimates suggest the risk of further increases in nonperforming loans.  \n \n7. \nEquity  availability.  Based  on  a  70:30  debt  equity  mix,  $500  billion  funding  in  private \ncapital implies mobilizing $150 billion of equity over the Twelfth Five-Year Plan. While the sector \nhas  a  market  capitalization  of  $55  billion  (50%  promoter  share),  generating  $95  billion  of \nadditional equity will be a challenge. A periodic dilution of promoters\u2019 share may not be possible \ndue  to  contract  restrictions;  excessive dilution will  suppress  the market. As  most  infrastructure \ncompanies  do  not  generate  significant  free  cash  flow,  new  equity  will  have  to come  from  new \nfund raising. However, markets can be unfavorable due to limitations on exit options hindering \nthe raising of equity.  \n \nOther  nonbank  financing.  Historically,  development  finance  institutions  (DFIs) 6 \n8. \nprovided infrastructure finance,  raising  low-cost, long-term funds from  multilateral  and  bilateral \nagencies  and  government-guaranteed  bonds.  As  DFIs  were  exposed  to  high-risk  sectors  like \ninfrastructure, they were dependent on government equity. Thus, the government decided which \nDFIs  to  support  and  which  to  convert  into  a  bank  or  nonbank  finance  company  (NBFC). 7 \nConsequently,  several  former  DFIs  such  as  Industrial  Credit  and  Investment  Corporation  of \nIndia and Industrial Development Bank of India became universal banks. In 2003, RBI set up a \nworking  group  to  address  the  regulatory  and  supervisory  issues  of  DFIs,  within  the  broader \nNBFC framework.8 The working group suggested that the exclusive role of DFIs as providers of \ndevelopment  finance  is  unnecessary  and  that  banks  may  extend  project  finance  and  develop \nrequired  skills.  More  recently,  RBI  indicated  that  NBFCs  and  banks  will  be  subject  to  similar \nasset  classification,  income  recognition  and  provisioning  norms,  and  prudential  measures  for \nsystemic risk.9 Thus, the flexibility of NBFC operations may be reduced in the future.10  \n \n9. \nIn  this  context,  IIFCL  is  the  only  DFI  that  receives  both  periodic  government  equity \ninfusion and guarantees for its borrowings.11 Thus, to justify government support and to respond \nto  evolving  market  needs,  IIFCL  operations  are  increasingly  geared  to  leveraging  market \n\n                                                \n6  Other NBFCs, such as Rural Electrification Corporation and Power Finance Corporation, have a limited subsector \n\nfocus and do not have a specific public\u2013private partnership mandate. \n\n7  Reserve Bank of India. 1998. Narasimham Committee on Banking Sector Reforms. Mumbai.  \n8  In  2003,  RBI  set  up  a  working  group  to  examine,  within  the  broader  framework  of  NBFCs,  regulatory  and \n\nsupervisory aspects including access to short-term resources for the DFIs as a separate category. \n\n9  The time for classifying a loan as a nonperforming asset for an NBFC will be reduced from the existing 180 days to \n\n120 days from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015, and ultimately to 90 days (bank standard). \n\n10 Reserve  Bank  of  India.  2011.  Working  Group  on  the  Issues  and  Concerns  in  the  NBFC  Sector  Report  and \n\nRecommendations. Mumbai. \n\n11 IIFCL was established on 5 January 2006 as a wholly owned government company with the mandate to (i) play a \ncatalytic  role  by  leveraging  resources  and  specialized  skills,  and  (ii)  be  a  nodal  public-private  partnership  (PPP) \nfinancing agency as an integral element of the overall PPP development strategy. IIFCL provides commercial long-\nterm  debt  financing  for  stand-alone  nonrecourse  infrastructure  projects,  such  as  project-specific  special  purpose \nvehicles established for PPP. \n\n\f3 \n\n \n\nresources  and  complementing  bank  financing  by  expanding  its  products  to  include  take-out \nfinancing,12 subordinate debt, and credit enhancements.  \n \n10. \nPolicy  framework:  developing  an  enabling  environment.  Against  the  backdrop  of \nthese  challenges,  the  government  identified  the  need  for  further  reforms  to  enhance  private \nsector  participation  in  infrastructure.  These  include  strengthening  public\u2013private  partnership \n(PPP)  support; 13  promoting  project  finance  schemes  in  infrastructure  development; 14  and \ndeveloping new sources of take-out project bond financing, including infrastructure debt funds.15 \nWith  these  reforms  in  place,  the  government  plans  to  accelerate  infrastructure  investment  to \nabove  9%  of  GDP  during  the  Twelfth  Plan  compared  with  7%  during  the  Eleventh  Plan.  The \ngovernment  has  also  targeted  IIFCL,  an  apex  organization  established  for  promoting  PPP \nprojects,  to  play  a  larger  role  in  infrastructure  financing.  As  such,  the  government  amended \nIIFCL\u2019s  scheme  for  financing  viable  infrastructure  (SIFTI)  to  accommodate  the  need  of  the \nmarket for subordinate debt and added a new scheme, Take-out Finance Scheme for Financing \nViable Infrastructure Projects.16 \n \nThe  proposed  facility  has  two  pillars:  (i)  positioning  IIFCL  to  play  a  larger  role  in \n11. \ninfrastructure financing with newly introduced financial products and modalities; and (ii) building \non  the  strong  relationship  and  successful  performance  of  previous  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) facilities with IIFCL support for PPPs.17 The facility will involve a sovereign loan to IIFCL18 \nto support three main areas: (i) direct lending, including to renewable and clean energy; (ii) take-\nout financing; and (iii) subordinate debt, all in line with the scheme. IIFCL provides up to 20% of \nits  business  in  direct  lending,  resulting  in  efficient  capital  allocation  for  lending  consortium \nmembers.  \n \n12. \nThe  new  initiative  to  include  the  take-out  financing  option  in  the  facility  would  help \naddress  the  exposure  and  asset\u2013liability  mismatch  constraints  of  banks and provide  space for \n\n                                                \n12  Take-out financing is a method of providing long-term financing for projects by banks. Under this method, the loan \nwill  be  taken  out  of  books  of  the  financing  bank  within  the  pre-fixed  period,  by  another  institution,  thereby \npreventing any possible asset-liability mismatch.  \n\n13 ADB provided a total of eight technical assistance projects of $11.8 million during 2006-\u20132010 for mainstreaming \n\nPPPs at both the state and central governments of India as well as for capacity building for IIFCL.  \n\n14 As pilot demonstration project finance, ADB financed the Bangalore Metro Project under its nonsovereign window \nin 2011.

Under  the  SIFTI,  IIFCL  lends  to  project  special  purpose  vehicles  of  PPP \nprojects up to a maximum of 20% of the total project cost as part of a lending consortium. Further, under the SIFTI, \nthe project  special purpose vehicle has its loan appraised by a lead bank or by a reputed institution.

Manila (MFF 0037-IND, approved on 17 November, $700 million). \n\n18 IIFCL has $1 billion of authorized capital and $500 million paid-up capital. Apart from equity, IIFCL raises long-term \ndebt from the domestic market and debt from bilateral and multilateral institutions. IIFCL\u2019s borrowings are backed \nby a sovereign guarantee. \n\n \n\n\fto  meet \n\nto  support  government  efforts \n\nnew bank lending.19 In addition, IIFCL offers take-out at financial close to take-out a portion of \nbank debt after project completion. The terms are based on subproject ratings and can result in \nlong-term borrowing cost reduction. Thus, a key value addition of the facility is to provide long-\nterm resources to IIFCL to sustain the long-term take-out finance option. The support for IIFCL's \nsubordinate  debt  product  through  the  proposed  facility  will  enable  overleveraged  subproject \ndevelopers  in  raising  additional  debt  without  having  to  raise  additional  equity  and  assist \nsubprojects in achieving financial closure. In addition, the facility will include new areas such as \ngreen  and  renewable  energy \nthe  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and support PPP initiatives in lagging states for inclusive growth.  \n \n13.  Multitranche  financing  facility.  The  MFF  modality  is  well  suited  for  PPPs  as  PPP \nsubprojects  are  typically  developed  in  a  phased  manner  based  on  project  implementation \nrequirements. 20 The MFF modality provides IIFCL with flexibility to release financing in line with \nsubproject readiness based on achievement of phased benchmarks including finalization of risk-\nsharing  arrangements,  readiness  of  engineering  and  procurement  contracts,  and  phased \nrelease  of  equity  by  subproject  promoters.  In  addition,  disbursement  of  a  subproject  can  take \nplace  through  multiple  tranches  with  the  introduction  of  time-slicing  in  the  MFF.  This  provides \nthe much-needed flexibility for IIFCL to properly and cost-effectively plan the disbursements of \nsubprojects allocated for financing under the facility. \n \nADB  assistance  to  IIFCL  and  performance.21 To  support  government  initiatives  to \n14. \nmainstream PPP in infrastructure development, ADB provided two MFFs totaling $1.2 billion to \nIIFCL  under  the  India  Infrastructure  Project  Financing  Facility  (IIPFF)  (footnote  17).  The  \nIIPFF  I  (comprising  two  tranches)  was  fully  disbursed  for  30  PPP  infrastructure  subprojects, \nincluding  major  international  airports  such  as  the  Delhi  and  Mumbai  international  airports.  It \nachieved financial closure on 26 August 2011, ahead of the target closure date. The IIPFF II for \n$700 million  comprises  three  tranches.  To  date,  the  first  and  second  tranches,  totaling \n$460 million,  were  fully  disbursed  well  ahead  of  the  target  closing  date  (December  2014)  for  \n14 subprojects. The third and final tranche, approved by ADB Management in December 2011, \nis  also  performing  well  with  disbursement  to  date  of  $118.90  million  for  10 subprojects.  ADB \nexpects to disburse the entire third tranche of $240 million by November 2013, 1 year ahead of \nthe  target  closing  date.  The  average  fund  mobilization  ratio  of  these  two  facilities  is  about  \n12  times,  which  means  that  every  dollar  drawn  down  from  the  facilities  has  mobilized  $12  of \nadditional funding.  \n \n15. \nStrategic  context.  The  ADB  country  partnership  strategy,  2009\u22122012  for  India \nemphasizes infrastructure development and is based on four pillars: (i) supporting inclusive and \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, (ii) catalyzing investment, (iii) increasing results orientation \nand  knowledge  solutions,  and  (iv)  supporting  regional  cooperation.22 The  facility  supports  all \npillars  given  the  link  between  growth and  infrastructure development  and the  need  to mobilize \nfinancing.23 The  strategy  also  supports  the  role  of  financial  intermediaries  for  providing  long-\n\n                                                \n19 Infrastructure  projects  are  initially  funded  by  banks  or  a  consortium  of  banks.  Such  projects  require  long-term \n\nfunding of 20\u201325 years, while traditional bank funding cannot be extended beyond 10\u201312 years. \n20 ADB. 2005. Innovation and Efficiency Initiative: Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities. Manila. \n21 The evaluation of benefits and impacts of the two IIPFFs shows that they have generated significant benefits. They \nsupported  upgrading  and  expansion  of  more  than  1,800  kilometers  of  the  road  network  across  India  and  added \n3,200  megawatts  of  power  generation  capacity.  Given  that  on  average  20,000  person-days  of  employment  are \ngenerated  per  kilometer  of  road  construction,  the  IIPFFs  have  resulted  in  about  36  million  person-days  of \nemployment. This employment opportunity has significantly benefited rural workers in the unorganized sector.  \n\n22 ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009\u20132012.

The facility incorporates lessons from earlier financial intermediation loans for \ninfrastructure  and,  in  particular,  from  implementing  the  IIPFFs. 24  First,  building  a  strong \npartnership  among  stakeholders \nincluding  subproject  developers,  executing  agency, \ngovernment, and ADB is essential to meaningfully pursue PPP development in India. Therefore, \na  holistic  approach  has  been  taken  to  support  the  government\u2019s  infrastructure  development \npriorities  and  assist  executing  agencies  with  capacity  building,  policy  advice,  and  provision  of \nfinancing to promote PPP. Second, the facility supports IIFCL\u2019s ability to leverage resources and \nexpand the infrastructure investor base, and sustain a tested business model that has resulted \nin  a  robust  pipeline  of  projects.  Third,  while  IIFCL  follows  the  lead  bank  in  the  lending \nconsortium  with  respect  to  credit  terms,  its  risk  profile  and  appetite  is  different  from  the  lead \nbanks. Thus going forward, IIFCL could use its resources to price its loans differently from the \nlead bank. In addition, as the facility will also support take-out financing and subordinate debt, \nan  additional  innovation  of  offering  take-out  financing  for  a  part  of  the  loan  after  commercial \noperation commences, at the time of financial closure itself, may also be explored through the \nfacility.25  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n17. \nThe impact of the facility will be the increased availability of infrastructure. The outcome \nwill  be  facilitated  private  sector  investment  in  infrastructure  PPPs.  This  will  be  achieved  by \nsupporting the evolution of the market for new financial products and modalities. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n18. \nThe  outputs  will  be  enhanced  availability  of  long-term finance for  PPP subprojects  and \nimproved  project  management.  The  indicative  pipeline  of  subprojects  will  be  subject  to  due \ndiligence to ensure conformity with ADB requirements.26 Subprojects will be financed for roads, \nrailways,  airports,  energy  (including  renewable  energy),  and  urban  infrastructure.  The  pipeline \ncomprises 31 subprojects for direct lending, including subordinate debt and take-out financing. \nUp  to  $300  million  of  bank  capital  is  expected  to  be  released  for  new  greenfield  projects  by \nFY2018. For tranche 1, 12\u201314 subprojects from the pipeline for the facility  will be taken up for \nfinancing.  Tranche  2  will  include tranche  1 subprojects  that  are  still  in  construction  phase  and \n15\u201317 new subprojects. Increased use of subordinate debt and take-out finance modalities may \nbe envisaged based on market requirements.  \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nD. \n \nBy the end of March 2013, IIFCL had a pipeline of 300 sanctioned projects27 with a total \n19. \nproject  cost  of  Rs4,631.8  billion  ($89.1  billion),  of  which  IIFCL  financing  is  estimated  at \nRs537.6 billion  ($10.3  billion).  The  IIFCL  pipeline  is  expected  to  grow  on  average  by  40\u201350 \n\n                                                \n24 The  IIPFF  I  is  rated  highly  successful.  ADB.  2012.

Accordingly, the MFF \nis included in the India country operations business plan for FY2013. The proposed facility will \ncapture approximately 7.4% of the IIFCL financing plan during the investment period. The MFF \nwill  comprise  two  tranches  of  $400  million  and  $300  million  respectively,  subject  to  IIFCL\u2019s \nsubmission  of  related  periodic  financing  requests  (PFRs),  execution  of  the  related  loan  and \nguarantee  agreements  for  each  tranche,  and  fulfillment  of  terms  and  conditions  and \nundertakings  set forth in  the framework financing agreement. The first tranche  of the  MFF  will \nhave a 19.5-year term, including a grace period of 4 years, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan \nand guarantee agreements.  \n \n21. \nCoordination  with  development  partners.  ADB  coordinated  with  development \npartners  during  processing  and  implementation  of  its  first  two  MFFs  to  IIFCL,  as  well  as \nprocessing of the proposed facility. Coordination efforts with development partners are aimed at \navoiding  duplication  of  resources  and  exploring  possible  cofinancing,  as  well  as  providing \ncontinued  capacity  building  support  to  IIFCL  for  institutional  strengthening,  particularly  in  the \nareas  of  safeguards  and  financial  management.  Development  partners  such  as  Agence \nthrough  KfW,  Japan \nFran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement,  German  development  cooperation \nInternational Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank either have ongoing lines of credit with \nIIFCL  or  are  in  discussions  for  possible  lending.  Some  development  partners  have  indicated \ntheir interest in the possibility of providing cofinancing with ADB in a subsequent tranche of the \nfacility.29  \n \n22. \nFramework  financing  agreement.  IIFCL  and  the  government  have  entered  into  a \nframework financing agreement (FFA) with ADB. The FFA satisfies requirements established in \nADB\u2019s  Innovation  and  Efficiency  Initiative.  The  FFA  records  the  full  set  of  assurances, \nwarranties,  and  representations  on  cross-cutting  themes  covering  safeguards,  governance, \nanticorruption,  financial  management,  procurement,  disbursement,  and  subproject  selection. \n\n                                                \n28 IIFCL  sanctioned  37  (Rs74,020  million)  new  projects  in  FY2011,  47  (Rs69,140  million)  in  FY2012,  and  \n\n66 (Rs69,140 million) in FY2013. \n\n29 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6     \n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\n \n\nThe government  and  IIFCL  have  ensured full  compliance with the  terms  and conditions  of the \nFFA before submission of the PFR to ADB. \n \n23. \nPeriodic  financing  request. Subloans will be extended under the facility to a range of \nsubprojects subject to submission of the related PFR by IIFCL and execution of related loan and \nguarantee agreements. Each PFR will be accompanied by a list of identified subprojects. IIFCL \nhas submitted the first PFR in line with the FFA. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail in \n\n24. \nthe facility administration manual.30 \n \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \n\nEstimated completion date \n\nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nJanuary 2014\u2013March 2019 \nJanuary 2014\u2013December 2016 (tranche 1) \n31 March 2019 \nDecember 2016 (tranche 1) \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agency \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nHarsh Kumar Bhanwala \nExecutive director, presently holding charge of chairman and \nmanaging director \nIndia Infrastructure Finance Company Limited \nIndia Infrastructure Finance Company Limited  \nChief general manager  \n\nSource: India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited. \n \n25. \nProject management. IIFCL will be the executing and implementing agency. The IIFCL \nboard will provide policy direction and strategic oversight. The IIFCL project management unit, \nestablished at the inception of the IIPFF I, will monitor day-to-day implementation of the facility. \nThe  environment  and  social  safeguards  management  unit  (ESMU),  established  in  February \n2010 at the inception of the IIPFF II, will be responsible for compliance with state and national \npolicies and the environmental and social safeguards framework (ESSF) of IIFCL.31  \n \n26.  Maximum  subloan  size  and  free  limit.  As  IIFCL  can  only  finance  up  to  20%  of \nsubproject  cost  for  direct  lending  and  up  to  30%  for  take-out  financing,  ADB  will  not  stipulate \nany additional limitation on subloan size. Under each tranche, ADB may, subject to its policies \nand  procedures,  permit  on  request  a  free  limit  for  the  borrower  for  up  to  $30  million  of  the \nqualified  subproject  financed  under  the  SIFTI.  A  suitable  free  limit  for  the  subproject  financed \nunder the take-out finance scheme may be considered for the second tranche, based on ADB \nassessment  of  IIFCL\u2019s  operating  performance,  appraisal  standards,  portfolio  quality,  and \naverage loan size on take-out finance during facility implementation. \n \n27. \nRetroactive  financing.  Under  each  tranche,  ADB  may,  subject  to  its  policies  and \nprocedures, permit on request retroactive financing of eligible expenditures for the facility up to \n20%  of  the  individual  loan,  incurred  prior  to  loan  effectiveness  but  not  earlier  than  12  months \nbefore the date of signing of the related legal agreement. IIFCL acknowledges that any approval \n\n                                                \n30 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 The  ESSF  was  developed  with  ADB  assistance  in  2007,  updated  in  2010  to  reflect  the  adoption  of  ADB\u2019s \n\nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009), and further revised in July 2013. \n\n \n\n\f8     \n \n\n \n\nof advance contracting and/or retroactive financing will not constitute a commitment by ADB to \nfinance the related project. \n \n28. \nSubproject  and  subborrower  selection  criteria  and  approval  procedures.  The \nscheme  provides  the  details  of  the  definitions,  eligibility  criteria,  appraisal,  and  monitoring  and \nlending terms for subprojects. Thus, the eligibility requirements for subproject and subborrower \nselection  criteria  of  the  facility  will  adhere  to  the  scheme,  which  includes  appraisal  of  the \nsubproject  by  the  designated  specialized  appraisal  agency  for  technical,  economic,  and \ncommercial  viability  and  review,  and  acceptance  of  the  results  of  the  appraisal  by  the  lead \nbank.32 In  addition,  subborrowers  will  be  required  to  meet  ADB  requirements  and  follow  the \nsubproject  approval  procedure  details  stipulated  in  the  loan  agreement,  FFA,  and  the  facility \nadministration  manual.  The  assessment  of  compliance  with  undertakings  under  the  FFA  and \nloan agreements of the IIPFF II confirms that IIFCL is in full compliance.33  \n \n29. \nProcurement  and  disbursement.  All  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  under  the \nfacility will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  The  individual  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2012,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  under  chapter  11  for \ndevelopment finance institutions.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe facility is expected to catalyze an investment estimated at more than $5 billion from \n30. \nthe private sector to finance 30 subprojects. While the projects sanctioned by IIFCL are spread \nacross  all  infrastructure  subsectors,  most  subprojects  identified  for  the  facility  are  mainly  for \nroads  and  energy. The economic  efficiency  of road  projects  is  typically  high  with an  economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR)  of 25%\u201330% and financial internal rate of return (FIRR)  of 10%\u2013\n15%. The estimates are also robust from a sensitivity perspective with the EIRRs and FIRRs not \ndeclining  significantly  even  in  worst-case  scenarios.  Further,  the  EIRRs  and  FIRRs  are \nsignificantly above the opportunity cost of capital. The facility is also expected to finance roads, \npower, and airport projects where EIRR estimates meet benchmark requirements.34  \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nFinancial management. IIFCL has the financial management capacity to administer the \n31. \nfacility. IIFCL board members actively oversee operations and have suitable industry and policy \nbackgrounds. IIFCL staffing has significantly increased since the inception of the IIPFF I and it \nhas meanwhile deepened its technical capacities. Accounting policies are well established and \nfollow national statutes. IIFCL is currently upgrading its management information systems. The \nnew system, which IIFCL has agreed to implement within 6 months of the facility\u2019s signing, will \nrepresent  a  significant  enhancement  and  improve  internal  reporting.  Given  the  government\u2019s \n                                                \n32 IIFCL's scheme requires IIFCL to only finance commercially viable projects and provide financing on commercial \nterms  and  price  loans  accordingly.  Thus,  all  aspects  of  project  economics  and  creditworthiness  with  regard  to \nsubprojects are subject to extensive due diligence prior to loan approval by IIFCL.  \n\n33 Compliance  Review  Matrix  of  Legal,  Environmental,  and  Social  Safeguards  of  the  Second  India  Infrastructure \n\nProject Financing Facility (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n34 The EIRRs of ADB-funded energy projects in India were higher than 12% (ranging from 13% to 31.5%), implying \neconomic efficiency in resource allocation and use. Independent Evaluation Department. 2007.  Sector Assistance \nProgram Evaluation: Energy Sector in India. Manila: ADB. Research conducted by a local research firm in India in \n2012 shows the EIRR of four road projects at 16%\u201321%.  \n\n\f9 \n\n \n\nAnticorruption  policy.  Consistent  with \n\nhistorical and expected support, IIFCL should have sufficient equity to absorb the $700 million \nfacility without breaching its regulatory capital requirements.35  \n \n32. \nto  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  examine  and  review  directly  any \nalleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the subprojects under the \nMFF.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  from  time  to  time)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  IIFCL  and  the  government. \nThe  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  facility \nadministration manual (footnote 30).  \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nits  commitment \n\n33. \nInfrastructure  development  strongly  impacts  poverty  incidence  by  supporting  inclusive \ngrowth.  A  recent  ADB  empirical  study  indicates that the  higher  the  overall  productivity  growth, \nthe  faster  is  the  pace  of  poverty  reduction.36 The  anticipated  key  impact  of  the  MFF  will  be \nthrough  greater  affordability  of  high-quality  infrastructure  facilities  that  stimulates  productivity \nincreases,  which  in  turn  increase  employment  and  income  opportunities  leading  to  poverty \nreduction.  The  poor  are  acutely  affected  by \nimpedes \ndiversification  and  improvement  of  their  livelihoods.  Shocks  to  the  national  economy,  such  as \nthe  rationing  of  the  supply  of  electricity  will  particularly  impact  many  people  who  depend  on \nsmall enterprises in the informal sector for their livelihood.  \n \nD. \n\ninfrastructure \n\nSafeguards \n\ninadequate \n\nthat \n\n34. \nIn  2007,  ADB  assisted  IIFCL  in  formulating  its  safeguard  policy  and  framework  in \nconsultation  with  development  partners.  The  environmental  and  social  safeguards  framework \n(ESSF)  was  updated  during  the  processing  of  the  IIPFF  II  in  2010.37 IIFCL  again  revised  and \nupdated the ESSF in July 2013 to reflect recent legislative and regulatory changes pertaining to \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards  and  changes  in  safeguard  policies  of  development \npartners.  IIFCL  has  uploaded  the  ESSF  on  its  website.  It  will  continue  to  ensure  that  all \nsubproject  proposals,  to  be  financed  under  the  facility,  comply  with  ESSF  safeguard \nrequirements.  Safeguard  compliance  performance  during  the  IIPFF  I  and  II  was  found  to  be \nsatisfactory. 38 IIFCL  is  in  the  process  of  further  strengthening  its  ESMU  with  an  adequate \nnumber of qualified specialists in environmental and social safeguards to be headed by a senior \nsafeguard  professional.  The  ESMU  will  be  supported  by  an  external  consulting  organization \nand/or specialists to conduct field visits, safeguard assessments, monitoring, and review. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nPotential key risks are mostly related to the impact of continued financial market volatility \n35. \nrecently  observed  in  India  and  in  particular  (i)  significant  increase  in  borrowing  costs  making \n                                                \n35 IIFCL\u2019s current capital adequacy ratio is 18.2%. Net nonperforming assets were nil in FY2009\u2013FY2012 and 0.7% in \nFY2012\u2013FY2013.  Further  details  on  IIFCL\u2019s  financial  management  are  provided  in  the  Financial  Management \nAssessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n36 R.

These  risks  are  unlikely  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  IIFCL \noperations  and  can  be  effectively  mitigated. The integrated  benefits  and impacts  of  the  facility \nare expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.39 A short analysis of the impact of financial \nmarket volatility is provided as a supplementary document.40  \n \n36. \nClimate change. A screening report for subprojects under the facility has been prepared \nfor climate change risks on subprojects. Screening criteria to score subprojects used a score of \n1  indicating  low  risk  and  2  indicating  higher  risk  for  risks  stemming  from  sea  level  rise, \nlandslides due to precipitation, and others. Thus, the facility will prioritize supporting subprojects \nby declining level of risk.41  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n37. \nIIFCL  and  the  government  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  facility  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the facility administration manual and loan documents. \n\n \nIIFCL and the government have given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which are \n38. \nset  forth  in  the  FFA.  Specific  covenants  agreed  by  IIFCL  and  the  government  with  respect  to \nindividual tranches under the MFF are set forth in the loan agreement and guarantee agreement \nfor the respective tranches.  \n \n39. \nConditions for loan  effectiveness.  As a condition precedent to the loan effectiveness \nof  the  first  tranche,  IIFCL  will  fully  staff  its  ESMU.
