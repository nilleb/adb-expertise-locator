SDPL takes a cluster approach and consists \nof  two  back-to-back  subprograms.  All  policy  conditions  of  SDPL-\nSubprogram I were complied with in October 2006. \n \nTargeting Classification: General intervention \nSectors: Law, economic management, and public policy \nSubsector: Economic management \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth, private sector development, \ngovernance \nSubthemes: Promoting economic efficiency and enabling markets, \npolicy/institutional/legal/regulatory reforms, financial and economic \ngovernance \n \nCategory C \n\n \nInvoluntary resettlement \u2013 Category C \nImpact on indigenous people \u2013 Category C \n \nThere is consensus among the Government, the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB),  and  the  aid  community  on  the  urgent  need  to  support \nthe  development  of  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  to \nsustain economic growth and to progressively reduce the incidence \nof  poverty  in  Viet  Nam.  The  traditional  approach  to  assisting  SME \ndevelopment,  which  aimed  to  fill  SMEs'  funding  and  technical  gaps \nthrough  provision  of  subsidized  credit  or  services,  has achieved \nlimited  results,  and  is  often  considered  unsustainable.  Increasingly, \ntherefore,  SME  support  programs  are  shifting  to  creation  of  an \nenabling business environment. \n \nThe SDPL Cluster is ADB\u2019s first policy loan in Viet Nam specifically \ndesigned to foster an enabling environment for the SME sector as a \nkey means for poverty reduction. Building from the achievements of \nSubprogram  I,  Subprogram  II  adopts  a  process-oriented  approach \nand  is  designed  to  systematically  identify  and  resolve  issues  and \nconstraints  on\nthrough \nintergovernmental coordination and stakeholder consultation.  \n \nThe ADB Board approved SDPL\u2019s cluster concept and Subprogram I \nfor  $60  million  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  on  21 \nSeptember  2004.  Subprogram  I  achieved  concrete  outputs,  and  all \nSubprogram  I  second  tranche  release  conditions  had  been  fully \ncomplied  with  by  October  2006.  The  Government  has  shown  solid \ncommitment  to  the  reform  program  and  is  ready  to  continue  with \nSubprogram II.   \n\nbusiness,  particularly  on  SMEs, \n\n\fii \n \n \n\n \nObjective and \nScope \n\n  \n\nSubprogram  II,  building  on  achievements  of  Subprogram  I,  will \ncontinue  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  effort  to  create  an  enabling \nbusiness environment in Viet Nam, which is facing challenges due to \ndeficiencies  common  to  developing  economies  in  transition.  In \nselecting  areas  to  be  covered  by  the  SDPL,  priority  was  given  to \nthose  assessed  to  be  (i)  significant  for  SMEs'  current  business \noperations, (ii) backed by Government commitment to reform in line \nwith best practices, (iii) linked to ADB's past and ongoing operations, \nand (iv) complementary to activities of other aid agencies. \n \nMany  measures  adopted  under  the  SDPL  support  the  Government \nin  undertaking  market-friendly interventions  and  eliminating  policy \nbias  against  SMEs,  thus  strengthening  the  environment  for  private \nsector development. Beneficiaries of such measures are expected to \ninclude the poor. \n \nThe objective of the SDPL is to support the Government\u2019s efforts to \ncreate a business environment that is conducive to economic growth \nand  employment  generation.  To  achieve  this  objective,  the  SDPL \nfocuses on the following: \n \n(i) \n\nlicensing \n\nEnhancing  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework.  The \nProgram  aims  to  (a)  improve the  business  registration  and \nlicensing  systems  by  implementing  uniform,  consistent \nregistration  procedures  nationwide,  and  streamlining \nbusiness \nthe \nprocedures; \nGovernment\u2019s institutional framework for SME development \nand  for  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  sector; \nand (c) promote closer public-private sector partnership and \nproviding systems that make information on the regulations \non  enterprises  accessible  to  the  public.  Policies  and \nprograms  will  be  based  on  a  comprehensive  SME  sector \ndatabase  and  a  coordinated  SME  development  policy \nstrategy. \n\nestablish \n\n(b) \n\nthrough  a \n\nImproving SMEs\u2019 access to resources (finance and land \nuse  rights).  The  SDPL  aims  to  (a)  reduce  the  costs and \nrisks of lending to SMEs by developing an SME accounting \nsystem, establishing land registration and valuation methods \nto improve the use of land use rights certificates (LURCs) as\ncollateral,  and  supporting  the  use of  movable  properties  as \ncollateral \ntransactions \nregistry; (b) improve the operational environment of financial \nleasing  companies  by  expanding  the  types  of  leasing \nproducts  and  diversifying  their  funding  source;  and  (c) \ncomplete  legal  and  institutional  frameworks  for  market-\nbased  transactions  on  land  by  establishing  the  legal  basis \nland \nfor \naccessible to the public, and promoting good governance in \nadministrative procedures. \n\nissuance  of  LURCs,  making \n\nfunctioning  secured \n\ninformation  on \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\niii\n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\ninternational  markets \nFacilitating  SMEs\u2019  access  to \n(industrial/technical  standards). The SDPL aims to lower \nthe  structural  barrier  on  industrial  and  technical  standards \nfor SMEs by (a) completing the legal framework on industrial\ninstitutional \nand \nreforms  of  certification  bodies  and  ensuring  SME \nrepresentation \n(c)  making \ninformation on standards readily available to the public. The \noverall objective is to make the standards more transparent. \n\nin  setting  standards,  and \n\ntechnical  standards, \n\n(b)  undertaking \n\n(iii)  enhance  policy  structure \n\nThe Program Framework is in Appendix 1. SDPL-Subprogram II is \ndesigned to continue the reforms initiated in Subprogram I and its \nmain benefits are to (i) improve key legal and regulatory structure; \n(ii)  facilitate  greater  transparency  through  improved  information \nflows; \nthrough  stakeholder \nconsultation  and  feedback  in  policy  formulation;  (iv)  improve \nthrough  private  sector  monitoring  of  business \ngovernance \nenvironment (and its indicators) and performance of regulatory and \nadministrative  agencies;  and  (v)  engage  third-party  regulatory \nreviews \nthe  above.  These  positive  elements \nincorporated in the SDPL-Subprogram II will increasingly be felt as \nthe  existing  systems  are  transformed  and  modernized  to  better \nsupport  a  progressively  market-oriented  economy.  Successful \nimplementation will form the basis for further developing the private \nsector in Viet Nam.  \n\nthat  reinforce \n\n \n\n \nProgram Period and  \nTranching \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  Subprogram  II  of  SDPL  will  comprise  a  loan  of  $20  million  to  be \ndrawn from the Asian Development Fund (ADF). The loan will have \na repayment period of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, \nand  will  carry  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace \nperiod  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  Subprogram  II  of  SDPL  is \nproposed to be cofinanced by Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement \n(AFD)  of  France  for  \u20ac13  million,  and  by  KfW  Entwicklungsbank \n(KfW) of Germany for \u20ac6 million.  \n \nSubprogram  II  will  be  implemented  within  18  months  after  loan \neffectiveness.  The  $20  million  loan  for  Subprogram  II  will  be \nreleased in a single tranche. Implementation of Subprogram II is \nplanned for 1 January 2007 to 1 July 2008. \n \nThe Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) will be the Executing \nAgency for Subprogram II of the SDPL. The implementing agencies \ninclude  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  Ministry  of  Justice  (MOJ), \nMinistry  of  Science  and  Technology  (MOST),  Ministry  of  Natural \nResources  and  Environment  (MONRE),  and  the  State  Bank  of \nVietnam (SBV).  \n \nThe  proceeds  of  the  SDPL-Subprogram  II  will  be  disbursed  for  a \nbroad range of imports, subject to a negative list of ineligible items. \nProcurement of goods and services produced in and originating from \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nProcurement \n\n\fiv \n \n \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n  \n\nADB  member  countries  will  be  made  with  due  consideration  to \neconomy  and  efficiency  in  accordance  with  standard  public  sector \nprocedures  in  Viet  Nam  and  normal  private  sector  commercial \npractices acceptable to ADB. The Borrower will certify that the value \nof  total  imports  minus  (i)  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  (ii) \nineligible  imports,  and  (iii)  disbursements  made  under  other  official \ndevelopment assistance, is greater than the amount expected to be \ndisbursed during the year. ADB will have the right to audit the use of \nthe  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Borrower's \ncertification. \n \nThe policy framework for the SDPL-Subprogram II includes specific \ncomponents  that  bear  distinct  costs  of  structural  adjustments.  The \nGovernment  has  provided  assurances  that  funding  will  be  made \navailable to cover these costs. \n \nimplementation  among  government \nTo  coordinate  program \nministries  and  agencies,  the  program  steering  committee  (PSC)  for \nSDPL-Subprogram  I  will  be  maintained.  The  PSC,  chaired  by  a \ndeputy  minister  of  MPI,  will  comprise  senior  officers  from ministries \nand government agencies (MOF, MONRE, MOST, MOJ, and SBV). \nThe  PSC  will  meet  at  least  twice  a  year  to  review  pending  issues \nand  propose  concrete  actions  for  their  resolution  to  ensure  timely \nprogram implementation. \n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions  There are four principal risks in implementing the SDPL-Subprogram \nII. The first involves effective coordination and cooperation within the \ngovernment,  both  horizontally  among  ministries  and  agencies \nconcerned,  and  vertically  with  the  provincial  and  district  authorities. \nConsultation  and  coordination  with  the  private  sector  and  the  aid \ncommunity  active  in  SME  development  will  also  be  required.  It  is \nexpected that coordination and cooperation among all stakeholders \nwill gradually improve with the increased coordination capacity of the \nAgency  for  SME  Development  (ASMED),  thus  reducing  the  risk  of \noverlap  and  inconsistencies  in  SME  support  activities.  Technical \nassistance  grants  (TA)  in  support  of  the  SDPL  implementation  will \ninclude  capacity  building  for  ASMED  to  reduce  this  risk.  Overall, \nwhile  coordination  among  government  agencies  significantly \nimproved  during  the  Subprogram  I  implementation,  it  remains an \nimportant issue.  \n \nA second risk pertains to good governance of the central, provincial, \nand  district  governments.  Governance  at  the  provincial  and  district \nlevels is particularly important since the positive impact of the SDPL \nwill  be  felt  only  through  effective  implementation  of  policies  at  the \nground level. These risks are common to several programs and are \nbeing  addressed  through  the  implementation  of  the  comprehensive \nPublic Administration Reform Master Program for 2001\u20132010, which \nis being supported by ADB. \n \nA  third  risk  relates  to  the  technical  capacities  of  implementing \n\n\f  \n\nv\n\n \n\nfourth  risk  relates \n\nagencies.  Experience  suggests  that,  given  adequate  technical \nsupport,  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  reforms  is  more  readily \ntranslated into effective and timely implementation. In implementing \nprevious programs, delays were caused predominantly by the lack of \ntechnical expertise and the consensus-building approach in enacting\nlaws  and  regulations.  To  reduce  this  risk,  a  series  of  TA  projects \nfrom  ADB,  KfW,  and  AFD  have  been \nimplemented during \nSubprogram  I, with  implementing  agencies  at  the  technical  level. \nAlthough  the  TA  projects  have  significantly  contributed  towards \ncapacity building, more needs to be done. \n \nThe \nto \nimplement the necessary reforms. The SPDL contains the issuance \nof a number of legal documents.  While a good progress has been \nmade  to  meet  the  conditions,  this  does  not  necessarily  lead  to \neffective  implementation  of  the  legal  documents.    As  noted  above, \nimplementation  requires  good  capacity,  coordination \neffective \namong  key  agencies,  and  political  commitment.  For  Viet  Nam, \nhowever,  such  commitment  seems  to  be  clear\u2014particularly  based \non  the  successful  Subprogram  I  implementation.  The  fact  that  Viet \nNam  is  accessing  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  regime \nalso indicates their commitment to market-based development. The \nnew  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (SEDP)  also  emphasizes \nthe  importance  of  SME  development.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1) has been enhanced to ensure that ADB can \neffectively examine the implementation progress.  \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  commitment \n\nto \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f  \n \n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  Subprogram  II  of  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise \nDevelopment Program Loan (SDPL). \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nThe SDPL was approved by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board of Directors on \n2. \n21  October  2004.1  It  comprises  two  subprograms  for  $100  million,  with  Subprogram  I  for  $60 \nmillion.2  Subprogram  I  is  to  be  disbursed  in  two  tranches:  (i)  $25  million  upon  fulfillment  of \nspecified first tranche release conditions upon loan effectiveness, and (ii) $35 million subject to \nfulfillment  of  specified  second  tranche  release  conditions  approximately  18  months  after  loan \neffectiveness. Subprogram II will provide a loan of $20 million.3\n \n3. \nThe  objective  of  the  SDPL  is  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  create  a  business \nenvironment that is conducive to economic growth and employment generation. To achieve this \nobjective, the SDPL will focus on the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nEnhancing  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework.  The  Program  aims  to  (a) \nimprove the business registration and licensing systems by implementing uniform, \nconsistent  registration  procedures  nationwide,  and  streamlining  business \nlicensing  procedures;  (b)  establish  the  Government\u2019s  institutional  framework  for \nSME development and for effective monitoring and evaluation of the sector; and \n(c)  promote  closer  public-private  sector  partnership  and  providing  systems  that \nmake information on government regulations on enterprises easily accessible to \nthe public. Policies and programs will be based on a comprehensive database on \nthe SME sector and a coordinated SME development strategy \n \nImproving  SMEs\u2019  access  to  resources  (finance  and  land  use  rights).  The \nSDPL aims to (a) reduce the costs and risks of lending to SMEs by developing an \nSME  accounting  system,  establishing  land  registration  and  valuation methods  to \nimprove  the  use  of  land  use  rights  certificates  (LURCs)  as  collateral,  and \nsupporting  the  use  of  movable  properties  as  collateral  through  a  functioning \n\n                                                \n \n1   The Loan Agreement for the SDPL-Subprogram I was signed in November 2004. The Government\u2019s provision of a \nlegal opinion was endorsed by ADB. With the establishment of the Program Steering Committee and the Program \nImplementation Unit within MPI, the loan became effective in April 2005. ADB\u2019s first tranche release was completed \nin August 2005. \n\n2   There  are  two  cofinanciers  for  the  SDPL.  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  of  France  is  providing \ncofinancing of \u20ac35 million\u2014\u20ac22 million for Subprogram I, and \u20ac13 million for Subprogram II. For AFD, Subprogram \nI is to be disbursed in two tranches: (i) \u20ac11 million upon fulfillment of specified first tranche release conditions, and \n(ii)  \u20ac11  million  subject  to  the  fulfillment  of  specified  second  tranche  release  conditions.  The  Loan  Agreement \nbetween  AFD  and  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  was  signed  in  November  2005.  AFD\u2019s  first  tranche  release  was \ncompleted in December 2005. KfW Entwicklungsbank (KfW) of Germany is providing cofinancing of \u20ac20 million\u2014\n\u20ac14 million for Subprogram I, and \u20ac6 million for Subprogram II. For KfW, Subprogram I is to be disbursed in two \ntranches: (i) \u20ac7 million upon fulfillment of specified first tranche release conditions, and (ii) \u20ac7 million subject to  the \nfulfillment of specified second tranche release conditions. The Loan Agreement for Subprogram I between KfW and \nthe Government of Viet Nam was signed in April 2005. KfW\u2019s first tranche release was completed in August 2005. \n3  Per  the  Government\u2019s  request,  a  $20  million  project  loan  for  the  development  of  the  leasing  industry,  which  was \noriginally  a  component  of  Subprogram  II,  will  be  processed  separately  in  2007.  Through  its  financial  sector \noperations,  ADB  has  been  supporting  the  Government  to  develop  an  enabling  regulatory  environment  for  the \nleasing industry. In addition, ADB has been providing assistance to the leasing industry association to support the \nindustry\u2019s capacity building.  \n\n\f \n\n2 \n \n \n\n \n\nsecured transactions registry; (b) improve the operational environment of financial \nleasing  companies  by  expanding  the  types  of  leasing  products  and  diversifying \ntheir  funding  source;  and  (c)  complete  legal  and  institutional  frameworks  for \nmarket-based transactions on land by establishing the legal basis for issuance of \nLURCs, making information on land accessible to the public, and promoting good \ngovernance in administrative procedures.  \n\n(iii) \n\nFacilitating  SMEs\u2019  access  to  international  markets  (industrial/technical \nstandards).  The  SDPL  aims  to  lower  the  structural  barrier  on  industrial  and \ntechnical standards for SMEs by (a) completing the legal framework on industrial \nand  technical  standards,  (b)  undertaking  institutional  reforms  of  certification \nbodies  and  ensuring  SME  representation  in  setting  standards,  and  (c)  making \ninformation on standards readily available to the public. \n\n \n4. \nTo  support  the  SDPL  implementation,  ADB  launched  an  advisory  technical  assistance \n(TA-4418:  Capacity  Building  for  SME  Development)  in  May  2005. 4  KfW  began  a  technical \nassistance (TA) project that supports the leasing components of the SDPL in August 2005. AFD \nis expected to launch a TA project to support capacity-building efforts in regards to the technical \nstandards by December 2006.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nMACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\n5. \nViet Nam's annual economic growth rate accelerated to an estimated 8.1% in 2005, up \nfrom  7.5%  in  2004,  and  7.1%  in  2003.  The  healthy  performance  was  achieved  despite  the \nadverse  impact  of  avian  influenza,  drought  for  part  of  the  year,  a  more  challenging  export \nmarket  for  clothing,  and  rising  prices  of  key  imported  inputs.  Domestic  demand  was  the  main \ncontributor to growth; exports also remained strong. Gross fixed investment continued to grow, \nreflecting  improvements  in  the  business  environment.  Investments  accounted  for  37.6%  of \ngross domestic product (GDP) in 2005, up from 29% in 1998.  \n \n6. \nMarket  liberalization  is  an  integral  part  of  the  country\u2019s  preparations  for  access  to  the \nWorld  Trade  Organization  (WTO).  Official  recognition  of  the  private  sector\u2019s  contribution  to \neconomic  activity  is  increasingly  explicit,  improving  the  prospects  for  further  reforms  toward  a \nmarket-based  economy.  In  2005,  the  National  Assembly  passed  a  new  Enterprise  Law  (NEL) \nand  a  Common \ninvestment  by  reducing \nadministrative  barriers  to  business  development  and  to  facilitate  WTO  membership.  Efforts  to \nimprove  the  business  climate  have  helped  generate  strong  growth  in  domestic  private \ninvestment  and  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI).  Some  38,100  private  enterprises  were  newly \nregistered in 2005, up from 14,400 in 2000.5 Viet Nam has about 200,000 private enterprises, \nwith  a  total  registered  capital  of  about  $26  billion. 6   The  improved  investment  climate  has \ncontinued to support FDI growth, with $2.4 billion in investment in the first 5 months of 2006, up \n19.7% year on year.  \n \nThe trade deficit narrowed to $4.5 billion in 2005, after a sharp widening in the trade gap \n7. \nin recent years. Total merchandise exports rose by 20% in value, below the 30% leap recorded \nin 2004 but still impressive and higher than the rise in imports.

Net  private \nremittances leaped by nearly $1 billion to $3.2 billion. Gross official reserves rose to $7.7 billion \nin  2005  (equivalent  to  about  2.6  months  of  imports).  The  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan \n(SEDP)  for  2006\u20132010  envisages  average  annual  GDP  growth  of  7.5\u20138.0%,  with  3.0\u20133.2%  in \nagriculture, forestry, and fisheries; 10.0\u201310.2% in industry; and 7.7\u20138.2% in services. Inflation is \nprojected to average about 5% and the current account deficit about 3% of GDP.7\n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Analysis \n\nSMEs are defined as businesses and production establishments that have a registered \n8. \ncapital  of  less  than  D10  billion  (about  $670,000)  and/or  fewer  than  300  annual  permanent \nemployees.  About  165,000  enterprises  have  been  registered  under  the  1999  Enterprise  Law \n(EL)  since  its  enactment  in  2000.  This  number  does  not  include  the  estimated  800,000 \nregistered  household  and  small  enterprises  without  tax  codes,  or  the  several  million  informal \nhousehold  enterprises  not  obliged  to  register  at  local  government  offices. 8   Of  all  formal \nenterprises, 79,420 had a registered capital of less than D10 billion (accounting for 86.6% of the \ntotal),  while  88,222  had  less  than  300  employees  (96.1%  of  total).  Thus,  based  on  the  two \ncriteria  of  registered  capital  and  average  number  of  employees,  SMEs  account  for  more  than \n86%  of  the  total  number  of  registered  enterprises.  Even  when  household  enterprises  are \nexcluded, it can be deduced that more than 86% of registered companies are SMEs. A profile of \nthe sector is presented in Appendix 2 and is summarized in Table 1. \n \n\nTable 1: \n\nProfile of the Small- and Medium-size Enterprise Sector \n\n2000 \n\n2002 \n\n2004 \n\n \nItem \nTotal Number of Large Firms (>D10 billion) \nTotal Number of SMEs  \n\n \n\nSMEs with less than D1 billion in capital \nSMEs with D1 billion\u20135 billion in capital \nSMEs with D5 billion\u201310 billion in capital \n\nTotal Number of Large Firms (>300 employees) \nTotal Number of SMEs (<300 employees)  \n\nSMEs with less than 5 employees \nSMEs with 5\u20139 employees \nSMEs with 10\u201349 employees \nSMEs with 50\u2013299 employees  \n\nSMEs by Sector (based on employees)  \n\n \n\n5,983 \n36,305 \n22,801 \n10,759 \n2,745 \n2,391 \n39,897 \n10,169 \n10,900 \n12,071 \n6,757 \n39,897 \n3,230 \n13,142 \n23,525 \n\n% \n\u2013\u2013 \n100.0 \n62.8 \n29.6 \n7.5 \n\u2013\u2013 \n100.0 \n25.5 \n27.3 \n30.3 \n16.9 \n100.0 \n8.1 \n32.9 \n59.0 \n\n \n8,692 \n54,216 \n29,585 \n20,141 \n4,490 \n3,077 \n59,831 \n12,079 \n18,139 \n20,718 \n8,895 \n59,831 \n3,223 \n21,300 \n35,308 \n\n% \n\u2013\u2013 \n100.0 \n54.6 \n37.1 \n8.3 \n\u2013\u2013 \n100.0 \n20.2 \n30.3 \n34.6 \n14.9 \n100.0 \n5.4 \n35.6 \n59.0 \n\n \n 12,335 \n79,420 \n39,378 \n32,739 \n 7,303 \n3,533 \n88,222 \n17,977 \n26,459 \n32,443 \n11,343 \n88,222 \n2,221 \n32,679 \n53,322 \n\n% \n\u2013\u2013 \n100.0 \n49.6 \n41.2 \n9.1 \n\u2013\u2013 \n100.0 \n20.4 \n30.0 \n36.8 \n12.9 \n100.0 \n2.5 \n37.0 \n60.5 \n\nAgriculture, forestry, and fishery  \nIndustry and construction  \nServices and commerce  \n\u2013\u2013 = not available, SME = small- and medium-sized enterprise. \nSource: General Statistics Office and Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n\n \n9. \nThe fastest growing segment of the formal SME sector appears to be those companies \nwith 10\u201349 employees, which grew from 30.3% of total SMEs in 2000 to 36.8% in 2004. In 2004, \nformal SMEs (defined as enterprises with fewer than 300 employees) were concentrated mainly \nin services and commerce (60.5% of total SMEs), followed by industry and construction (37% of \ntotal). The industry and construction subsector has attracted the largest number of new SMEs \n                                                 \n7   The macroeconomic assessment from the IMF will be submitted to the Board separately. \n8   The Establishments Census conducted  by  the General Statistics Office in 2003 showed that Viet Nam had more \n\nthan 2.7 million business establishments engaging over 8.3 million people in 2002. \n\n\f \n\n4 \n \n \nsince 2000, growing from 32.9% of total SMEs in 2000 to 37% in 2004. Since 2004, the SME \nsector  has  continued  to  grow  as  the  private  sector  has  gained  increasing  importance  in  the \neconomy.  In  2004,  the  private  sector  produced  70%  of  the  country\u2019s  non-oil  exports,  27%  of \ntotal  investment,  and  absorbed  39%  of  domestic  bank  credit.9  The  private  sector  has  also \nconsistently outpaced the state-owned enterprise (SOE) and foreign-invested sector in terms of \nindustrial  output  growth,  with  output  growing  at  22.2%  in  2004  and  24.1%  in  2005.  The  exact \npercentage of SMEs as a component of the private sector is not systematically recorded, but it \nis generally accepted to be around 90% of registered enterprises. Viet Nam continues to have \none of the world\u2019s highest rates of export growth, with non-oil exports rising 30.2% in 2004 and \n20%  in  2005.  Non-oil  exports  accounted  for  61.3%  of  GDP  in  2005,  up  from  47.6%  in  2002. \nWhile the percentage of exports produced by SMEs is not tracked by official statistics, surveys \nhave  suggested  that  it  remains  small,  with  the  vast  majority  of  firms  with  fewer  than  100 \nemployees  producing  exclusively  for  the  domestic  sector.  Finally,  the  Ministry  of  Trade \nsuggested  that,  as  of  October  2004,  the  SMEs  accounted  for  84.2%  of  the  total  number  of \nexporting enterprises (data on export value is not available). \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Issues \n\nBased  on  the  in-depth  analysis  undertaken  while  preparing  for  the  SDPL  in  2004,  and \n10. \nbased  on  lessons  learned  while  implementing  Subprogram  I,  the  following  major  challenges \nfacing the sector have been identified.  \n \nLack of a National SME Development Plan and Coordination Framework. In view of \n11. \nthe  multidimensional  constraints  of  SMEs  that  cut  across  different  sectors  and  mandates  of \ngovernment  ministries  and  agencies,  SME  development  requires  vision,  strategic  direction,  as \nwell  as  effective  coordination  between  the  different  stakeholders  in  policy  delivery,  both \nhorizontally as well as vertically. No overall national development plan has existed to fulfil these \nfunctions in the past; support programs remain uncoordinated and often overlap, thus reducing \ntheir  impact.  With  a  view  to  developing  an  enabling  policy  and  regulatory  environment,  it  is \ntherefore  important  to  establish  the  Government\u2019s  policy  and  institutional  framework  for  SME \ndevelopment through a coordinated, public-private partnership. \n\n \n12. \nIncomplete  and  Inconsistent  Business  Registration  and  Licensing  System.  While \nthe EL simplified business registration by reducing time, costs, and documentation requirements, \nnewly issued guidelines and interpretations by the local authorities, which are not in line with the \nEL,  have  brought  further  complications  for  entering  the  market.  Similarly,  while  the  number  of \nlicenses was reduced after passing the EL, a range of new licenses has emerged, bringing the \ntotal documented number to 298 licenses and sublicenses.10 This increase in licenses imposes \na substantial burden on SMEs as well as on government administration. There is a clear need \nfor rationalizing existing licenses while applying procedural approaches that ensure more careful \nissuance of new licenses. This can now be achieved with the passage of the NEL. At the same \ntime,  the  business  registration  process  requires  streamlining,  combined  with  an  expansion  of \nthe  National  Business  Information  System  (NBIN)  to  incorporate  all  provinces,  to  provide \n\n \n                                                \n9   Sources:  Vietnam  Development  Report  2006.

These joint activities will contribute to \nan improved business environment.  \n\n \n13. \nLimited Access to Financial and Physical Resources. Access to finance remains one \nof  the  most  significant  problems  for  SMEs.  The  financial  sector,  which  is  used  to  lending  to \nSOEs  with  Government  guarantees,  still  perceives  financing  for  SMEs  to  be  costly  and  highly \nrisky.  While  collateral  is  an  important  means  to  access  finance,  the  limited  access  to  LURCs \nreduces its use for collateral purpose. This will require a completion of the corresponding legal \nand regulatory framework under which LURCs are issued and a streamlining and unification of \nregistration  procedures  of  subsequent  transactions.  Moreover,  to  support  banks  in  pricing  the \ncollateral, price valuation methods of land need to be updated to conform to market principles \nand  to  reflect  actual  market  values.  SMEs\u2019  access  to  finance  will  be  further  enhanced  by  an \neffective secured transactions registry that clearly establishes the prioritization of creditors\u2019 and \nlien  holders\u2019  rights  while  registering.  In  addition,  the  lack  of  collateral  is  compounded  by \nunreliable financial information on SMEs. Financial reporting requirements are felt to be overly \ncomplex  and  difficult  to  comply  with.  This  situation  needs  to  be  alleviated  by  introducing  a \nsimplified SME accounting system that adheres to the International Accounting Standards (IAS).  \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy \n\ntargets  reduction  of  poverty \n\nThe  Government's  development  goals  and  poverty  reduction  targets  are  stated  in  the \n14. \nSEDP  (2006-2010),  various  sector  strategies,  and  the  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and \nGrowth  Strategy  (CPRGS).  The  CPRGS \nincidence  by \napproximately 12% between 2001 and 2010 through increased efficiency in resource use, social \nprogress  and  equity  in  income  distribution,  and  development  of  corruption-free  and  efficient \nstate functions.  \n  \n15. \nTo support the private sector, the Government issued Decree 90/2001/ND-CP\u2013\u2013Support \nfor Development of SMEs (Decree 90)\u2013\u2013in November 2001 and officially recognized SMEs for \nthe first time in Viet Nam. Decree 90 provides a framework for the Government to support and \nencourage  private  sector  development  and  covers  the  establishment  of  (i)  an  SME  Promotion \nCouncil with cross-ministry membership to act as an advisory body to the Prime Minister, and (ii) \nASMED in MPI to coordinate SME-related activities. \n \n16. \nTo  further  support  Government  initiatives  for  private  sector  development,  the  SDPL \nprovides  assistance  for  (i)  completing  the  supporting  legal  and  policy  frameworks;  (ii) \nestablishing  efficient  mechanisms  for  coordination  among  various  government  ministries, \nagencies, and other stakeholders including the private sector; and (iii) effectively implementing \ncurrent legal and policy measures at the central, provincial, and local levels.   \n \nViet  Nam\u2019s  expected  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  marks  a \n17. \nhistorical  milestone  in  its  long-lasting  and  continuous  endeavor  for  integration  to  the  global \neconomy,  since  the  launch  of  Doi  Moi  in  1986  and  the  country\u2019s  initial  application  for \nmembership  in  1995.  Upon  completion  of  the  ratification  process,  Viet Nam  will  be  part  of the \nmultilateral  trading  system,  under  which  trade  policy  in  goods  and  services  and  protection  of \ntrade-related aspects of intellectual property rights are pursued in a transparent and, in principle, \nnon-discriminatory manner. Accordingly, the WTO accession is both timely and consistent with \nthe  SDPL\u2019s  overall  objective  of  fostering  an  enabling  environment  for  the  enterprises.  The \ncountry  will  also  have  access  to  WTO\u2019s  dispute  settlement  system  and  trade  policy  review \nmechanism. \n \n\n\f6 \n \n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nThe Asian Development Bank's Strategy and Operations in the Sector \n\n18. \nThe  SDPL  Cluster  was  originally  included  in  ADB\u2019s  lending  program  for  Viet  Nam  to \naddress  a  strategic  priority  set  under  the  2002\u20132004  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP),11 \nnamely,  improving  the  business  environment  for  private  sector  development,  with  a  focus  on \ndomestic  SMEs.  On  account  of  critical  roles  of  private  sector  and  SMEs  for  business-led  and \npro-poor economic growth, the CSP (2007\u20132010)12 continuously addresses establishment of an \nenabling  environment  for  enterprises  operating  in  Viet  Nam,  through  proposed  support  for \neffective implementation of the NEL and the Common Investment Law.13\n \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\nExternal assistance to SMEs in Viet Nam started in the mid-1990s. In addition to ADB, \n19. \nmajor  multilateral  funding  agencies  active  in  SME  development  include  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme  (UNDP),  United  Nations  Industrial  Development  Organization \n(UNIDO), and the World Bank Group. More specifically, UNDP and UNIDO have worked closely \nwith  the  Government  on  implementing  Decree  90  and  a  number  of  aspects  related  to  the  EL. \nThe World Bank, in coordination with ADB and a number of bilateral sources, has put in place a \ncomprehensive package of reforms under its Poverty Reduction and Support Credit.   \n \nBilateral aid agencies from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, the European Union, \n20. \nFrance, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the \nUnited  Kingdom,  and  the  United  States  (US)  are  also  active.  Appendix  6  presents  a  matrix  of \naid activities in the SME sector, spread across (i) policy and institutional support; (ii) legal and \nregulatory  enhancement;  (iii)  human  resource  development,  such  as  vocational  and  training \ncenters;  (iv)  line  of  credit  for  SMEs;  and  (v)  business  development  services.  Despite  diverse \nassistance,  there  has  been  limited  policy-based  lending  support  (other  than  the  SDPL)  for \nspecifically developing the sector in Viet Nam. ADB closely coordinates with these agencies to \nmaximize synergies where possible, and avoid duplication of efforts.   \n \n\n5. \n\nLessons  \n\nADB's past operations in SME development suggest a number of key lessons.  \n\n21. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nFor  program  loans,  commitment  of  the  developing  member  country  (DMC)  is \ncrucial  for  successful  outcomes.  Merely  passing  legislative  and  regulatory \nchanges to satisfy ADB conditions does not guarantee successful outcomes. \n\nPrograms must provide sufficient flexibility to allow for rapidly changing economic \nand political conditions.  \n \nThe  focus  of  SME  development  should  be  on  fostering  an  enabling  business \nenvironment.  The  traditional  approach  to  assisting  SME  development,  which \n\n                                                \n \n11  ADB. 2001. Country Strategy and Program (2002\u20132004): Viet Nam. Manila. \n12  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2007\u20132010): Viet Nam. Manila. \n13  The new CSP  specifically  illuminates  areas  of policy reforms that validate ADB\u2019s  assistance, including: (i) further \ndevelopment  of  the  national  business  registration  system,  and  streamlining  the  business  licensing  system;  (ii) \npolicy and institutional reforms to complete the Government\u2019s framework for private sector and SME development; \n(iii) enhancement of financial disclosure through development of a simplified accounting system for SMEs; and (iv) \nnecessary policy initiatives to enhance access to finance through efficient use of land, fixed assets, and movable \nproducts as collaterals. These are fully reflected in the design of Subprogram II of the SDPL Cluster. \n\n\f  \n\n7\n\n \n\n \n\naimed  to  fill  SMEs'  funding  and  technical  gaps  through  provision  of  subsidized \ncredit  or  services,  has  achieved  limited  results\u2014and  is  oftentimes  considered \nunsustainable.14 \n\n \nDistinct features of the SDPL, which address shortcomings of ADB's past operations for \n22. \nSME development, include the consultative approach taken throughout its formulation. A series \nof workshops for each component was organized with a view to achieving commitment from the \nGovernment  and  stakeholders.  For  the  SDPL  to  maintain  its  relevance  throughout  its \nimplementation  period,  it  was  approved  as  a  program  cluster  modality,  which  would  allow \noperational flexibility and adjusting to changing economic and political conditions. \n \n23. \nThe SDPL formulation also reflects the lessons learned from other donor projects. Often, \nthe  projects  have  been  scattered  without  much  coordination.  Such  projects  can  be duplicative \nand  overlapping.  Therefore,  it  was  important  to  have  a  roadmap,  which  facilitates  a  close \ncoordination  of  among  the  Government,  donor  agencies,  and  other  stakeholders.  The  SME \nRoadmap,  which  became  the  basis  for  the  SME  policy  strategy,  was  supported  by  ADB.  \nFurther,  as  ADB  is  serving  as  a  co-chair  for  the  SME  Working  Group  (a  donor\u2013Government \nworking group), there have been significant improvements in coordination.   \n \n\nV. \n\nSDPL-SUBPROGRAM I\u2014STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION \n\nA. \n\nProgram Implementation  \n\n24. \nThe  following  section  details  the  progress  and  achievements  of  Subprogram  I.  Further \ndetails  are  provided  in  Appendix  8.  Appendix  1  provides  measurable  targets  and  indicators  of \nthe major development impacts. ADB will continue to identify an appropriate set of indicators for \nthe impact evaluation based on consultation with the Government.  \n \n\n1. \n\nImproved Business Licensing and Registration Systems \n\n25. \nThe  SDPL-Subprogram  I  supported  the  improvement  of  the  regulatory  environment  for \nSMEs  by  (i)  introducing  a  more  rigorous  process  for  business  licensing,  and  (ii)  facilitating \nbusiness  registration.  The  EL  of  1999  shifted  the  paradigm  of  business  registration  and \nlicensing from permitting companies to carry out only certain activities, to allowing companies to \nengage  freely  in  all  activities  not  expressly  prohibited  by  law.  The  EL  concurrently  abolished \nmore  than  150  business  licenses  and  introduced  a  one-stop  registration  system  that \ndramatically simplified the registration process.\n \n26. \nKeeping  business  registration  and  licensing  processes  simple  and  ensuring  consistent \nand  fair  implementation  of  the  processes  have  reduced  uncertainty,  risks,  and  costs  for \nbusinesses. However, developments prior to Subprogram I showed some reversals from earlier \nmeasures simplifying business registration and licensing requirements. In terms of licensing, the \nbenefits of eliminating more than 150 license requirements with the promulgation of the EL were \nmitigated by the issuance of a large number of new business licenses. The Task Force for the \nEnforcement of the Enterprise Law (Task Force) identified 80 remaining licenses that contradict \nthe  spirit  of  the  EL  and  recommended  their  removal.  To  date,  only  three  of  these  license \n\n                                                \n \n14  The  lessons  learned  from  other  donor  agencies  are  similar. The World  Bank,  for  example,  suggests  that  lines  of \ncredit  have  only  a  50%  success  rate  It  suggests  that  credit  lines  are  effective  when  the  overall  business \nenvironment  accommodates  for  SME  development.

Washington, DC. \n\n\f \n\n8 \n \n \nrequirements  have  been  removed  due  to  continued  resistance  from  issuing  ministries.  As  of \nMarch 2006, Viet Nam had about 300 business license requirements in effect.  \n \n27.  With  the  promulgation  of  the  NEL  in  November  2005,  the  Government  has  laid  the \nfoundation  for  fundamental  licensing  reform,  thereby  complying  with  the  SDPL-Subprogram  I \nCondition  (2-1).  Article  7  of  the  NEL  further  restricts  the  issuance  of  business  licenses,15  and \nrequires that both new and existing business licenses be reviewed and evaluated for regulatory \nmerit,  only  after  which  they  are  to  be  considered  effective. 16   This  process  will  allow  the \nGovernment  to  exercise  greater  control  over  the  quality  and  number  of  license  requirements, \nand will protect enterprises from having to secure \u201cunofficial\u201d licenses.  \n \n28. \nThe NEL establishes the policy framework for fundamental licensing reform. The impact \nof  these  reforms,  however,  will  be  largely  dependent  on  the  viability  of  the  institutional \nmechanisms  and  procedures  developed  for  their  implementation.  ADB  will  further  support  the \nGovernment in this implementation effort through Subprogram II of the SDPL. \n \nIn the area of business registration, Subprogram I supported the adoption of increased \n29. \nuniformity in procedures for business registration throughout Viet Nam. The EL of 1999, which \nsimplified  the  registration  process,  reduced  registration  barriers  by  minimizing  time,  document \nrequirements, and costs; and eliminating minimum capital requirements. Regardless, the costs \nof market entry in Viet Nam remain high. On average, launching a business in Viet Nam takes \nmore  than  50  days  and  11  steps,  at  a  cost  equal  to  51%  of  gross  national  income  (GNI)  per \ncapita.  While  this  is  on  par  with  the  regional  average  of  52.5  days  and  8.0  steps,  it  is \nsubstantially  more  than  the  average  19.5  days  and  6.5  steps  in  the  OECD. 17   Sometimes \nadditional  steps  must  be  completed  before  lodging  the  required  application  forms.  As  such, \nprocessing  times  can  be  significantly  longer  than  the  statistics  suggest.  Accordingly, \nSubprogram  II  has  identified  further  measures  to  improve  the  registration\u2019s  procedures  and \nrequirements.  \n \n30. \nDespite  genuine  public  and  government  interest  in  improving  the  registration  process, \nturning  theory  into  practice  has  proven  difficult,  as  the  issues  cut  across  local,  national,  and \nagency  jurisdictions  and  include  complex  legal  and  technical  considerations.  The  registration \nprocess remains fragmented, without a vertically integrated business registration organization or \nsupporting information systems. This in turn undermines national oversight and makes it more \ndifficult for the provincial and district registration offices to accomplish their assigned tasks. The \nNEL  addresses  this  weakness  by  calling  for  greater  information  sharing  between  business \nthe  successful \nregistration  offices  as  well  as  other  regulating  agencies.  Critical \nimplementation of these reforms will be the support of a national business registration database \nand  management  information  system,  and  expansion  of  the  National  Business  Information \nNetwork  (NBIN).  The  plan  for  the  NBIN  expansion  has  been  supported  through  Subprogram  I \nCondition (2-2).  \n \n\nto \n\n                                                \n \n15  Article  7  expressly  prohibits  ministries,  People\u2019s  Committees,  and  People\u2019s  Councils  of  all  echelons  from  issuing \n\nregulations relating to business conditions, i.e., business licenses. \n\n16 Specifically, Article 7 requires line ministries and local governments to (i) review and examine periodically business \nconditions in order to annul or recommend annulling any business condition that is no longer necessary, (ii) amend \nor recommend amending any business condition that is no longer appropriate, and (iii) issue or recommend issuing \nnew business conditions necessary to the requirement of state management. \n\n17 Source: World Bank. 2006.

Washington, DC. \n\n\f  \n\n9\n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nEstablishment of the Government\u2019s Policy and Institutional Framework for \nSME Development \n\n31. \nThe SDPL has been supporting the development of an effective policy and institutional \nframework  for  SME  development,  one  that  can  formulate  and  implement  a  coordinated \ndevelopment  strategy  for  the  sector.  While  a  diverse  range  of  government  policies  and  plans \nreferred to the importance of SME  development before the SDPL, the  Government had yet to \nintegrate them into a national SME development strategy. The process has been constrained by \nlimited institutional resources and capacity, lack of a coordination mechanism, insufficient efforts \nto promote public-private partnerships, and a weak statistical base on SMEs.  \n \n\na. \n\nFormulation of a Coordinated Plan for SME Development \n\n32. \nASMED  was  created  under  Decree  90.  Its  tasks  and  responsibilities  are  wide-ranging \nand  include  formulation  of  an  SME  development  strategy.  Under  TA  4031,18  ADB  provided \ntechnical  inputs  into  the  preparation  of  the  roadmap  for  SME  development.  The  road  map, \ntogether  with  a  modernized  information  system,  forms  the  basis  for  the  SME  development \nstrategy. To put the strategy into action, the Minister of Planning and Investment (as chairman \nof the SME Promotion Council) has issued a decision authorizing ASMED to draft a long-term, \nmultisectoral and interministerial SME Development Action Plan. The SME Development Action \nPlan 2006\u20132010, prepared with SDPL support and in coordination with UNIDO, was submitted \nto the Minister of Planning and Investment in January 2006, per Subprogram I Condition (2-3). \nOverall,  the  strategy  aims  to  facilitate  more  coordinated  approaches  to  the  implementation  of \nSME  development  policy  among  various  government  agencies.  It  also  aims  to  support  more \neffective donor coordination.   \n \n33. \nThe SME Promotion Council was created under Decree 90 to advise the Prime Minister \non  mechanisms  and  policies  on  SME  development.  It  will  play  an  integral  role  in  monitoring \nimplementation  of  the  SME  Development  Action  Plan.  The  SME  Promotion  Council  has \nmembers  from  various  ministries,  yet  it  has  limited  membership  from  the  private  sector.  To \nensure  that  the  evolving  concerns  of  SMEs  are  more  consistently  addressed  by  government \npolicies, the Minister of Planning and Investment issued Decision 649/BKH on 12 July 2005 to \nconfirm  that  representatives  of  other  organizations  will  have  the  same  rights  as  standing \nmembers.  \n \n\nb. \n\nDevelopment of a System for Collecting Information on SMEs \n\n34. \nAccurate,  up-to-date  information  enables  the  Government  to  identify  constraints  to  the \nestablishment  and  growth  of  businesses.  Thus,  targeted  interventions  to  eliminate  such \nconstraints  may  be  initiated  with  predefined  and  quantified  baselines  for  measuring  policy \nimpact. Data on the SME sector in Viet Nam, as defined by Decree 90 (and further segmented \nby number of employees), are not systematically collected. The two main sources of business \ndata\u2014General  Statistics  Office  (GSO)  and  NBIN\u2014have  not  yet  been  formally  mandated  with \nthis task.  \n \n35. \nThe  new  national  business  registry  (\u201cNBIN\u201d  is  used  as  a  generic  term  to  refer  to  this \nregistry) will cover all provinces in Viet Nam and will be linked to the online SME portal that was \nlaunched  in  July  2006.  The  portal  was  developed  by  MPI,  per  Subprogram  I  Condition  (2-4), \n\n                                                \n \n18 ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing SME Development Program. \n\nManila (approved for $650,000 in December). \n\n\f10 \n \n \nwith support from UNIDO. It serves as a gateway to information on regulations and procedures \nfor  compliance,  Government  support  programs,  business  associations,  and  other  business \nsupport  providers.  Closer  collaboration  with  GSO  will  also  be  important  in  order  to \nsystematically gather SME indicators, which can then also be linked to the SME portal.  \n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nEnhanced  Mechanisms  for  Improving  SMEs\u2019  Access  to  Financial  and \nPhysical Resources \n\nAccess  to  finance  is  perhaps  the  most  often  cited  inhibitor  of  SME  growth.  Under  the \n36. \ncurrent  operational  environment,  banks  are  becoming  increasingly  interested  in  lending  to \nprivate  sector  SMEs.  However,  high  transaction  costs  associated  with  lending  to  SMEs  have \nheld  back  actual  growth  in  SME  loans.  Availability  of  collateral,  which  can  potentially \ncompensate for SMEs' perceived high credit risk, is limited, given the SMEs\u2019 weak asset base. \nThe  SDPL  supports  measures  to  reduce  the  cost  and  risks  of  lending  by  addressing  the \nbottlenecks  SMEs  face  in  providing  financial  information  and  offering  collateral  to  lenders. \nFurthermore, it is also developing an alternative channel for SME financing through new funding \nsources and a diversified range of products for the leasing industry. \n \n\na. \n\nDevelopment of an SME Accounting System \n\nThe accounting system for SMEs in Viet Nam has been under development since 1996, \n37. \nwith the issuance of Decision 1177, which was later amended by Decision 144 on 21 December \n2001.  Both  decisions  imposed  accounting  standards  for  SMEs  that  were  similar  to  those  for \nlarger enterprises. There are currently 25 accounting books applicable to all types of enterprises \nand 39 supporting documents (compulsory and guiding) in accordance with Decisions 1177 and \n144. \n \n38. \nOn 17 June 2003, the National Assembly passed the Law on Accounting, considerably \nmodernizing the accounting rules in Viet Nam. SME accounting, however, has failed to keep up. \nThe  new  Accounting  Law,  which  became  effective  on  1  January  2004,  supersedes  Decisions \n1177  and  144,  but  replacement  decisions  have  yet  to  be  issued.  The  Vietnamese  accounting \nstandards are being revamped to conform with the IAS, and a new general accounting system \nwas adopted on 20 March 2006, with MOF Decision 15/2006/QD-BTC. \n \n39. \nDespite  these  significant  developments,  the  accounting  and  financial  reporting  policies \nand  procedures  for  SMEs  remain  too  complicated  and  burdensome.  Staff  with  limited \naccounting skills cannot comply with all the requirements. The existing SME accounting system \ndoes  not  support  the  management  information  needs  of  the  SMEs,  and  it  does  not  provide \nadequate  information  for  prospective  creditors  and/or  lenders.  The  SDPL  has  therefore \nsupported  MOF  in  developing  a  simplified  SME  accounting  framework,  including  the  chart  of \naccounts,  financial  statements,  accounting  books,  and  voucher  system.  Per  Subprogram  I \nCondition  (2-5),  MOF  has  issued  an  SME  accounting  system,  consistent  with  the  IAS  and \naccounting legal framework of Viet Nam. The SDPL-Subprogram II will continue to support the \nMOF with assistance to complete and disseminate the new SME accounting system.19  \n \n\n \n                                                \n19  In  addition,  ADB\u2019s  financial  sector  operations  have  been  supporting  the  accounting  industry  development.  \nParticularly,  with  the  MOF,  ADB  has  been  developing  a  road  map  for  the  industry  to  adopt  the  IAS.  The \nVietnamese  Accounting  Association,  formed  with  ADB  support,  has  been  operating  as  a  self-regulatory \norganization.   \n\n\f  \n\n11\n\n \n\n \n\nb. \n\nImproved Legal Framework for Effective Use of Collateral \n\ni. \n\nLand Use Rights Certificates \n\nBank  credit  to  SMEs  in  Viet  Nam  typically  requires  high  levels  of  collateral,  as  SMEs \n40. \nrarely have adequate financial records or business plans to mitigate credit risk, and few banks \nhave the skills to effectively assess those risks. Given the weak asset base of most SMEs, their \nland use rights are often the only assets that they can collateralize. Yet issuance of LURCs to \nSMEs  has  been  extremely  time-consuming,  with  a  series  of  checks  that  must  be  cleared  and \nrequirements for legal documents that vary from province to province. To collateralize the land \nuse  rights,  SMEs  have  to  be  equipped  with  the  relevant  LURCs,  so  that  they  can  show  their \nlegitimate  ownership  upon  such  lands.  The  situation  is  further  complicated  by  the  lack  of  a \nsingle LURC for buildings and/or assets attached to land. \n \n41. \nAccording to the Land Law of 2003 and its implementing decrees and circulars, the local \nPeople\u2019s Committee shall be responsible for final issuance of LURCs. The People\u2019s Committee \napproves, signs, and seals the LURC before issuance by the land title offices (LTOs), which is \nlimited to a  purely administrative role. The implementation of the Land Law and its supporting \ndecrees, especially the uniform procedures for issuance of the LURCs, has proven difficult. This \nis essentially due to (i) conflicting and/or ambiguous provisions of existing legislation regarding \npolicies and procedures, (ii) the level of bureaucracy involved at local agency level, and (iii) the \nhigh cost of LURC issuance. Compounding these problems is the lack of a national land policy \nand registry system with clear operating guidelines for local LTOs. \n \nThe  SDPL-Subprogram  I  has  been  addressing  these  shortcomings  through  technical \n42. \nassistance to clarify the legal framework and develop workable models for LURC issuance and \nregistration  at  the  provincial  level,  where  all  LURCs  for  SMEs  are  processed.  Specific  inputs \nhave included identification of the problems within the current operational model and legislative \nframework,20 including conflicting articles within the relevant decrees and circulars. Subprogram \nI  (per  Condition  2-11)  has  provided  support  to  MONRE  in  revising  Decision  2421  (format  and \ncontent of LURCs) and Circular 29 (cadastral records management, including process for LURC \nregistration).  \n \n43. \nSubprogram I (per Condition 2-7) has supported the development of uniform procedures \nto be followed by all provincial and district offices of MONRE for (i) land registration and LURC \nissuance,  and  (ii)  information  collection  on  the  issued  LURCs.  Pilot  exercises  have  been \nconducted  in  three  provincial  LTOs  in  Ha  Nam,  Thai  Binh  and  Bac  Ninh  to  develop  new \nstandardized  registration  processes  and \ninformation-sharing  arrangements.  Registration \nprocesses emphasized transparency, simplification, uniformity, standardization, and compliance \nwithin  the  current  legal  framework.  Electronic  links  were  orchestrated  between  the  LTOs  and \ntwo  other  principle  stakeholders  in  the  land  administration  framework  (the  departments  of \nnatural  resources  and  environment,  and  the  provincial  People\u2019s  Committee),  so  that  data  on \nland use, ownership, and subdivision changes could be shared. The pilots were conducted from \nOctober  2005  to  January  2006.  Subprogram  II  will  further  assist  MONRE  in  summarizing  and \ndisseminating  the  lessons  learned  from  the  three  pilots  so  that  the  national  rollout  plan \nincorporates the improved uniform procedures within the land registration system.   \n                                                \n \n20 This framework consists of Decree 181/2004 (procedures for LURC issuance), Circular 29/2004 (compilation and \nadjustment  of  cadastral  records),  Decision  24/2004\u2013Article  2  (format  and  content  of  LURCs),  and  Interminsterial \nCircular 01/2005 (standardized system of registration).  \n\n21  Incorporating the lessons learned from the pilot LTOs (per Condition 2-7), Decision 24 has been revised and the \n\nnew Decision 8/2006/QD-BTNMT was issued by MONRE on 21 July 2006.  \n\n\f \n\n12 \n \n \n \n44. \nLastly, Subprogram I (per Condition 2-6) has also supported the implementation of new \nguidelines for land valuation for use by local authorities (Decree 188/2004/ND-CP and Circular \n114/2004/TT-BTC).  Market-based  land  valuation  is  a  key  innovation  of  the  new  Land  Law,  as \nland  has  traditionally  been  priced  by  People's  Committees  for  purposes  of  taxation  and \ncompensation.22  While  the  legislative  framework  is  now  in  place,  implementation  has  proved \ndifficult  as  (i)  market  transactions  to  realize  the  market  prices  are  not  effectively  recorded,  (ii) \nthe private sector\u2019s role in price valuations remains underdeveloped, and (iii) an estimated 50% \nof land transactions continue to be conducted informally, as a way of avoiding taxes and other \nadministrative burdens. ADB supported MONRE to conduct three field surveys to measure the \nextent  of  compliance  with  Decree  188,  and  developed  recommendations  to  facilitate \nimplementation of its core principles.  \n \n\nii. \n\nMovable Property \n\n45. \nTo  facilitate  SME  use  of  movable  properties  (e.g.,  equipment,  inventories,  and \nreceivables)  as  collateral,  emphasis  has  been  placed  on  the  development  of  a  secured \ntransactions registration system. Under the First Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL I),23 the \nGovernment  issued  a  Secured  Transactions  Decree  (Decree  165)  in  1999  and  a  Decree  on \nEstablishing  the  Registry  for  Secured  Transactions  (Decree  08)  in  2000. 24  These  decrees \nprovided the legal foundation for sole responsibility of MOJ for establishing, administering and \nmaintaining a national database for all types of secured transactions on moveable goods.  \n \n46. \nTo  develop  a  nationwide  computerized  secured  transactions  registration  system,  the \nfor  Secured \nMinistry  of  Justice  (MOJ)  established \nTransactions (NRAST) in 2002. For the proper functioning of the secured transactions registry, \nlegal  documents  must  clearly  establish  prioritization  of  creditors'  and  lien  holders'  rights  upon \nregistering  their  interest.  Furthermore,  the  computerized  system  must  ensure  efficiency  and \ntransparency for potential creditors or purchasers.  \n \n47. \nViet Nam\u2019s amended Civil Code, which became effective in January 2006, abolishes the \ndistinction  between  pledges  and  mortgages  on  the  basis  of  whether  the  security  assets  are \nmoveable  or  immoveable.  Instead, pledges  and  mortgages  will  be  distinguished  by  who  holds \nthe  security  assets\u2014a  transaction  will  be  a  pledge  when  the  secured  party  holds  the  security \nassets  and  it  will  be  a  mortgage  when  the  securing  party  keeps  the  security  assets.  With  this \nconceptual change, there is a need to make an amendment of Decree 165 and Decree 08. Thus, \nthe Government, with support from ADB (and per Subprogram I Condition 2-10), has prepared a \ndraft  implementing  decree  for  the  prioritization  of  creditors'  and  lien  holders'  rights  upon \nregistering  their  interest  on  the  NRAST.25  The  decree  addresses  the  formalities  of  creating \n\nthe  National  Registration  Agency \n\n                                                \n \n22   Under  the  2003  Land  Law,  the  MOF  (Land  Price  Division  of  the  Price  Control  Department)  has  legislative \nresponsibility for land valuation, but land prices are to be determined in three ways: (i) by city/provincial authorities, \n(ii) in auctions, and (iii) by land users in market transfers and leases. \n\n23  ADB.  1996.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Financial  Sector  Program.  Manila \n(approved for $90 million on 19 November 1996).  \n\n24  Decree 08/2000/ND-CP establishes a single registration regime for secured transactions with a centralized general \nregistry  for  moveable  property  and  four  complementary  specialized  registries  for  security  in  seagoing  vessels, \naircraft, LURs, and immoveable property. \n\n25  ADB  will  also  provide  assistance  to  MOJ  on  the  technical  requirements  for  the  functionality  of  an  Internet-based \nsecured  transaction  registry.  Overall,  Viet  Nam  amended  the  Civil  Code  whereby  the  priority  orders  upon \nregistrations  of  secured  transactions  are  clarified.  The  implementation  decree  for  the  Civil  Code\u2019s  provisions \n\n\f  \n\n13\n\n \n\n \nsecurity, priority rules that flow from registration, and the enforcement rights of secured creditors \nupon default. \n \n48. \nThe  procedures  for  secured  transactions  development  are  proceeding  in  the  right \ndirection.  Once  the  implementing  decree  on  secured  transactions  is  issued,  establishing  the \nprioritization  system  between  types  of  instruments,  the  main  emphasis  should  be  on \nimplementation, \nthe \nregistration system, and completing the legal framework to enable electronic transactions. The \nnew  Law  on  Electronic  Transactions,  and  its  yet-to-be  issued  implementing  decree,  should \nprovide key supporting guidelines for electronic signatures, submission of documents, payments \nand other modalities. The activities will be supported through Subprogram II.  \n \n\nthe  electronic  capacity  and  sophistication  of \n\nincluding  enhancing \n\nc. \n\nImproved Legal Environment for Financial Leasing Companies \n\n49. \nFinancial leasing operations in Viet Nam are governed by Decree 16 (May 2001), which \nwas later amended by  Decree 65 (June 2005) and Circular No. 8/2001/TT-NHNN (September \n2001) issued by the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV). The activities of financial leasing companies \n(FLCs)  are  confined  to  (i)  financial  leasing  for  machinery,  equipment,  vehicles,  and  other \nmovable assets; (ii) advising clients on matters relating to financial leasing operations; and (ii) \nother  services  related  to  financial  leasing.  Decree  65  permits  sale  and  leaseback  transactions \nand syndicated leasing, but implementing regulations have to be issued. Transactions in foreign \ncurrency are subject to the foreign exchange control regulations of SBV. FLCs are permitted to \nmobilize capital from (i) short-, medium-, and long-term borrowing from credit institutions in Viet \nNam  and  abroad;  (ii)  issuance  of  bonds  with  a  term  of  more  than  1  year  (subject  to  SBV \napproval); and (iii) other means as stipulated in Article 16 of Decree 16. \n \n50. \nThe  development  of  the  leasing  industry  in  Viet  Nam  is  particularly  constrained  by \nshortcomings in the legal framework that restrict both the activities and the funding mechanisms \nof FLCs. The Government recognizes that the absence of implementing regulations for sale and \nleaseback  transactions  and  syndicated  leasing  constrains  FLCs  from  offering  a  fuller  product \nrange  tailored  to  market  needs.  Long-term  funding  also  presents  a  problem  for  some  FLCs, \nincluding subsidiaries of state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) that source all or most of their \nfunds from their respective parent banks. Thus, in general, there is a mismatch in financing in \nFLCs  between  their  borrowing  (short-term)  and  lending  (long-term,  as  leasing  transactions). \nLeasing companies have cited difficulties in attracting term loans of more than 1 year at viable \ninterest rates, and relatively few have been successful in issuing medium- or long-term bonds.  \n \n51. \nTo address these constraints, Subprogram I (per Conditions 2-8 and 2-9) has supported \nthe  SBV  in  the  issuance  of  implementing  guidelines  for  Decree  65,  to  specify  policies  and \nprocedures  for  (i)  sale  of  lease  receivables,  (ii)  sale  and  leaseback  transactions,  and  (iii) \nsyndicated leasing.  A pilot program was launched in March 2006 with the following participating \ninstitutions: (i) Viet Nam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, (ii) Viet Nam International \nLeasing Company, (iii) Asia Commercial Bank, and (iv) Bank for Industrial Development of Viet \nNam.  Under  the  pilot,  provisional  guidelines26  have  been  developed  by  the  SBV  to  allow  the \nparticipating  institutions  to  sell  lease  receivables.  As  of  mid-June  2006,  total  transactions \nexecuted under the pilot were valued at VND105 billion. The pilot is deemed critical to identify \n\n                                                                                                                                                         \n \nregarding  secured  transactions  was  issued  to  clarify  the  priority  orders  among  various  secured  transactions,  and \ntransactions similar to secured transactions, including lease transactions. \n\n26 SBV Official Document No. 2585 \n\n\f \n\n14 \n \n \nalternative  source  of  finance  for  FLCs,  and  will  be  further  pursued  through  a  leasing  industry \nloan by ADB in 2007.  \n \n52. \nA key achievement of the pilot exercise to date has been the development of provisional \nguidelines  for  the  sale  of  lease  receivables  within  the  current  legal  framework.  Beyond \nlegislative  reform,  however,  the  longer-term  expansion  of  the  financial  leasing  industry  will \nrequire a stronger system of lease right enforcement. Current weaknesses in the court system \nmake it difficult for creditors to recover collateral (and leased goods) upon default of lessees. In \nthe  absence  of  reliable  enforcement,  the  risks  of  lending  will  remain  high,  thereby  dampening \nthe  expansion  of  all  forms  of  SME  credit.  Accordingly,  Subprogram  II  will  support  the \nGovernment to further refine and improve the necessary legal framework. \n \n\n4. \n\nStrengthened  Legal  Framework \nTransactions  \n\nfor  Land \n\nto  Allow  Market-Based \n\n53.  Many SME surveys in Viet Nam point to limited access to land as the foremost constraint \nto  their  growth.27  Issues  on  SMEs\u2019  access  to  land  revolve  around  inefficiencies  resulting  from \ninconsistencies and biases distinct to economies in transition. For example, there is a significant \ndifference in the proportion of land use rights held by SOEs compared with those held by private \nsector  SMEs.  The  economic  transformation  process  has  resulted  in  a  large  amount  of  prime \ncommercial  and  industrial  land  being  allocated  to  SOEs.  However,  many  do  not  take  full \nadvantage  of  the  land  allocated  to  them  in  their  industrial  or  commercial  activities.  Much  land \nallocated to SOEs is left idle with no plans for future use, while the rapidly growing private SMEs \nare  suffering  from  lack  of  land.  Consequently,  leasing  idle  land  from  SOEs  has  become  the \nmost  common  method  used  by  private  sector  SMEs  to  obtain  land,  although  subletting  from \nSOEs is, in most cases, illegal. \n \n54. \nThe  Government  is  taking  proactive  measures  to  clarify  the  principles  of  land  law  and \nmake them consistent for developing a property market in Viet Nam. For example, the new Land \nLaw of 2003, supported under the SDPL, recognized the property market for the first time in Viet \nNam and stipulates that land pricing should be based on real market transfer prices of land use \nrights under normal circumstances. The Land Law also augments and improves the framework \nfor state management of land in terms of (i) land zoning and planning, (ii) transferring the power \nto  allocate  or  lease  land  and  issue  LURCs  from  the  Government  to  the  provincial  and  district \nPeople\u2019s Committees, (iii) establishing the organization (nonprofit public service SOE) to create \nand manage land funds, (iv) establishing a uniform land registration system for undertaking all \nland registration in Viet Nam, (v) making clear the procedures for settling of land disputes, and \n(vi) clarifying the guiding principles for land pricing. \n \n55. \nOne  of  the  key  achievements  of  the  new  Land  Law  is  making  land  use  rights \ntransferable  with  market-based  pricing  mechanisms.  It  also  introduced  a  single  nationwide \nregistry  system,  a  uniform  procedure  for  issuing  LURCs,  and  measures  to  improve  the  use  of \nidle land. A simplified and more transparent legislative framework will benefit SMEs by making \nthe law easier to understand, particularly for owners or operators who have no legal background, \nand by generally reducing transaction costs.  \n \n\n                                                \n \n27  Reports  and  surveys:  Institute  of  Economics.  2001.

A simpler and \nclearer set of standards are required, since they can also be onerous for SMEs and there can \nbe a trade-offs between quality assurance and market access. The standards can also become \na  regulatory  burden  for  SMEs,  and  thus  the  SDPL  has  supported  the  Government  to  improve \ntheir  legal  framework.  For  governments,  standards  offer  an  opportunity  for  deregulation  and \nimproved  governance  as  they  help  to  ease  the  level  of  regulatory  details  to  essential \nrequirements for health protection, safety, and  the environment. Standardization is therefore a \nkey part of microeconomic infrastructure that is still in the development phase in Viet Nam. The \nSDPL-Subprogram I supported the Government in developing industrial and technical standards \nin conformity with best international practices, which promoted participation of all stakeholders. \n \n\na. \n\nEnhanced the Legal Framework on Industrial and Technical \nStandards in Conformity with International Best Practices \n\n57. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  legal  framework  on  industrial  and  technical  standards  is  currently  being \nupdated  to  bring  it  in  line  with  international  best  practices.  In  November  2004,  this  framework \nwas  composed  of  the  1999  Ordinance  on  Product  Quality  and  its  implementing  Decree  179 \nProviding for State Management over Goods and Product Quality (per Subprogram I Condition \n2-12).  Additional  legal  texts  were  required  to  effectively  implement  the  Ordinance,  including \nPrime Ministerial Decision 50/2006 which contains a revised \u201cList of Import and Export Products \nfor which Quality Needs to be Checked by the State in 2000\u201d.  \n \n58. \nIn September 2005, MOST announced that the 1999 Ordinance on Product Quality is to \nbecome a law to be promulgated in November 2006. The SDPL will continue to support MOST \nin  preparing  this  Law.  Similarly,  the  Ordinance  on  Technical  Standardization  has  also  been \nupgraded  to  a  law,  with  the  National  Assembly  promulgating  the  new  Law  on  Standards  and \nTechnical  Regulations  on  29  June  2006  (complying  with  Subprogram  I  Condition  2-14).  This \nLaw is in line with international practices that specify technical regulations.28 This Law and the \nDecision as noted above comply with Subprogram I Condition (2-13).   \n \n\nb. \n\nContinued Institutional Reforms  \n\n59. \nThe  current  institutional  framework  for  certification  and  accreditation  requires  reform  to \nfoster  a  more  competitive  environment  and  allow  greater  SME  participation.  The  Bureau  of \nAccreditation  is  the  only  accreditation  body  in  Viet  Nam.  Because  of  capacity  constraints, \nhowever,  this  Bureau  has  yet  to  accredit  a  single  certification  body.  It  would  therefore  be \nbeneficial  to  authorize  international  institutions  to  accredit  certification  bodies  in  Viet  Nam. \nAccordingly, under Subprogram II the SDPL will support MOST to draft a decision requiring that \nany certification body operating in Viet Nam must be accredited by either a signatory member of \ninternational/regional accreditation body, or Viet Nam's Board of Accreditation. \n \n60. \nThe  Directorate  for  Standards  and  Quality  (STAMEQ),  as  authorized  by  MOST,  had \noriginally been the only institution to certify  standardized products, quality assurance systems, \n\n                                                \n \n28 Technical regulations are focused on health, safety, and environmental parameters, while technical standards refer \n\nto material and performance measures, as outlined in the Vietnamese National Technical Standards (TCVN) \n\n\f \n\n16 \n \n \nand  testing  laboratories.  These  functions  have  now  been  transferred  to  technical  service \ninstitutions, yet STAMEQ continues to undertake certification. There is a conflict of interest for \nSTAMEQ  to  act  as  an  accreditation  body  and  as  a  service  institution  providing  certification  in \ncompetition  with  private  certification  providers.  To  address  this  issue  and  facilitate  the \ndevelopment of private certification providers, the SDPL has been supporting MOST in planning \nthe  separation  of  STAMEQ's  state  administrative  functions  from  its  commercial  activities. \nDecree  115/2005/ND-CP  was  issued  in  September  2005,  providing  the  legal  basis  for  the \nseparation of the commercial and administrative functions of STAMEQ, thereby complying with \nSubprogram I Condition (2-16).29  Under Subprogram I of the SDPL, technical assistance was \nprovided  to  complete  a  diagnostic  study  of  the  functions  and  activities  of  STAMEQ,  as  a \npreparatory step to developing a detailed implementation plan for its legal restructuring.30  \n \n\nc. \n\nProvision of Information on Both National and International \nStandards  \n\n61. \nThe SMEs in Viet Nam currently have limited knowledge of international standards and \nnational  standards  of  other  countries.  Availability  of  information  about  competitors  and  market \nrequirements related to product quality is also limited. A database of international standards and \nnational  standards  of  other  countries  has  been  developed  by  the  Information  Center  of \nSTAMEQ  and  additional  information  regarding  technical  standards  and  product  quality  is \nprovided  by  other  ministerial  departments.  However,  it  is  not  always  immediately  apparent  to \nSMEs  how  this  information  relates  to  their  business,  and  finding  simple  answers  to  basic \nquestions is often difficult for SMEs that have little knowledge of how standards and conformity \nassessment  systems  work.  SMEs  also  have  limited  access  to  information  on  testing  services \nprovided by Vietnamese and international testing laboratories.  \n \n62. \nLack of access to information and knowledge on standards can be a major competitive \ndisadvantage for SMEs attempting to enter domestic or international markets. To overcome this \nbarrier,  and  as  required  per  Subprogram  I  Condition  (2-15),  MOST  has  developed  an  online \ndatabase  providing  SMEs  with  information  on  (i)  international/national  standards  of  other \ncountries,  and  cross-recognition  schemes;  (ii)  certification  bodies,  testing  laboratories,  and \nquality management providers; and (iii) relevant information on technology transfer.   \n \n63. \nOperationalization  of  the  database  will  require  continued  technical  assistance.  In  the \nmeantime,  several  websites  are  providing  SMEs  with  information.  Data  and  links  to  technical \nstandards  of  other  countries  and  international  standards,  e.g.,  ISO,  can  be  found  on  the  Viet \nNam  Standards  Center  website  (www.vsc.org.vn).  Summary  information  on  cross-recognition \nschemes  is  available  on  www.tcvn.gov.vn.  The  STAMEQ\u2019s  Viet  Nam  Productivity  Centre \nwebsite  (www.vpc.org.vn)  has  a  list  of  certification  bodies  in  Viet  Nam.  A  list  of  testing \nlaboratories in Viet Nam is available on the Bureau of Accreditation website (www.boa.gov.vn). \nIn  addition,  some  information  on  quailty  management  providers,  particularly  QUACERT \n(www.quacert.gov.vn),  is  provided  on  www.tcvninfo.org.vn.  The  information  on  technology \ntransfer,  and  the  legal  framework  on  intellectual  property  rights,  is  provided  on  the  website  of \nthe National Office of Intellectual Property of Viet Nam (www.noip.gov.vn).  \n \n\n \n                                                \n29  Circular 12 was issued in June 2006 as an implementing guideline to Decree 115.  \n30  Additional technical assistance (via an AFD TA) will now be provided to STAMEQ to develop this implementation \n\nplan during the Subprogram II implementation. \n\n\f  \n\n17\n\n \n\n \nB. \n\nPerformance Monitoring \n\n64. \nquantitative indicators (see Table 2).  \n  \n\nTo  facilitate  performance  monitoring,  baseline  data  were  collected  for  subsectors  with \n\nTable 2: Performance Monitoring Baseline Data \n\n \n\nPerformance Data \nNumber of newly registered enterprises \nTotal registered capital of private enterprises (D billions) \nPrivate sector share in employment \nPrivate sector share in total domestic bank credit \nAnnual growth of bank credit to SMEs \nPrivate sector share in gross investment  \nNumber of days required to start a business \nNumber of days required to register property \nValue of lease receivable sale transactions (first 6 months of 2006)\nAverage number of transactions registered at NRAST per month \nAverage number of NRAST discharges per year \nNumber of enterprises with ISO 9001-2000 certification \nNumber of enterprises awarded National Quality Award \nNumber of legally protected business closures \n\n2003 \n27,751 \n57,965 \n31.8% \n30% \n37% \n30% \n63 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n1,237 \n81 \n\u2014 \n\n2004 \n36,795 \n75,125 \n33.5% \n39% \n20% \n32% \n56 \n78 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n1,598 \n96 \n\u2014 \n\n2005 \n39,951 \n107,297 \n\u2014 \n40% \n22% \n33% \n50 \n67 \nD105 billion \n1,800 \n500 \n1,682 \n132 \nAbout 100 \n\nSources:  Ministry  of  Finance,  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam,  Ministry  of  Justice,  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment, \nGeneral Statistics Office, Ministry of Science and Technology, World Bank Doing Business Database. \n\n \n\nDuring SDPL-Subprogram I implementation, Viet Nam\u2019s private sector has continued its \n65. \nexpansion.  More  and  more  enterprises  are  registered  every  year  (43%  more  in  2005  than  in \n2003), and greater access to finance (private sector share of bank credit grew from 30% in 2003 \nto 40% in 2005) has led to faster capital accumulation. The private sector accounted for 33% of \ntotal gross investment in 2005, up from 30% in 2003.   \n \n66. \nThe  net  effect  of  reforms  in  business  registration,  licensing,  and  land  registration  are \nalso apparent, with the total number of days required to start a company falling from 63 days in \n2003 to 50 days in 2005, and the total number of days required to register property falling from \n78  days  in  2004  to  67  days  in  2005.  These  trends  are  expected  to  continue  with  continued \nsupport from SDPL-Subprogram II.  \n \nActivity at NRAST has been growing steadily since its creation in 2002, with an average \n67. \nof  1,800  secured  transactions  registered  per  month  in  2005.  Similarly,  the  implementation  of \nSBV\u2019s  pilot  program  for  the  sale  of  lease  receivables  has  resulted  in  VND105  billion  worth  of \ntransactions in the first 3 months of the pilot (April\u2013June 2006). The private sector share of total \ndomestic  bank  credit  grew  from  30%  in  2003  to  40%  in  2005.  Simplified  processes  for  LURC \nissuance and secured transactions have expanded the use of collateral, further supporting this \ntrend.  According  to  the  SBV,  the  annual  growth  rate  of  banking  credit  to  SMEs  rose  to  an \nestimated 22% in 2005, up from 20% in 2004.  \n \n68. \nReforms  to  improve  the  quality  management  and  certification  process under  the  SDPL \nare  critical  to  facilitating  SME  access  to  international  markets.  A  host  of  legislative  changes \nsupported by the SDPL have helped to pave the way for a simpler product quality and standards \nmanagement. The number of firms receiving ISO 9001-2000 certification increased from 1,598 \nin  2004  to  1,682  in  2005.  Similarly,  the  number  of  firms  receiving  the  National  Quality  Award \nincreased from 96 in 2004 to 132 in 2005.  \n\n\f \n\n18 \n \n \n \nC. \n\nConclusion on Implementation of Subprogram I \n\n69. \nOverall, based on the data as illustrated above, Viet Nam\u2019s SME sector has shown the \nmost  rapid  growth  among  the  neighboring  countries  in  the  Mekong  region.  Further,  the \nimprovements  in  the  regulatory  environment,  as  assessed  through  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Doing \nBusiness 2006 Survey, indicate that Viet Nam is one of the top performers in the Asian region.   \n \n70.  While  many  challenges  remain,  the  implementing  agencies'  commitment  to  complete \nSDPL-Subprogram  I  under  Loan  No.  2095-VIE  (SF)  was  visible  in  the  steady  progress  made \ntoward  completing  all  policy  actions  throughout  implementation.  The  completion  of  the \nconditions  that  were  geared  on  improving  the  regulatory  environment  are  indicative  of  the \nimprovements  that  have  been  made.    Accordingly,  the  Government  has  complied  with  all  16 \nconditions  of  the  second  tranche.  The  quality  of  outputs  under  Subprogram  I  has  been \nsatisfactory.  The  capacity  to  implement  reforms  varied,  however,  and  periodic  shortages  of \nqualified staff caused delays in the reform agenda. Capacity of implementing agencies is being \ndeveloped  under  TA-4418  and  the  TAs  of  KfW  and  AFD.  The  Government  is  committed  to \ncontinuing the reform program, and is ready to proceed with SDPL-Subprogram II. In view of the \nsignificant progress made in the implementation of the overall Program and the full compliance \nwith the second tranche conditions, release of the second tranche of the SDPL-Subprogram I is \njustified. \n \n\nVI. \n\nSDPL-SUBPROGRAM II\u2014PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope  \n\n71. \nThe objective of SDPL-Subprogram II is to support the Government\u2019s efforts to create a \nbusiness  environment  that  is  conducive  to  economic  growth  and  employment  generation. \nSpecifically, Subprogram II will continue to support reform measures for (i) enhancing the policy \nand regulatory framework, (ii) improving SMEs\u2019 access to finance and land use rights, and (iii) \nfacilitating SMEs\u2019 access to markets by improving industrial and technical standards. \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n72. \nThe  Government  has  demonstrated  its  commitment  to  reform  by  taking  advanced \nactions in a number of key areas, including three conditions on which progress must be made \nfor ADB Board consideration of Subprogram II (3-1, 3-9, and 3-11). The refined policy matrix is \nprovided  in  Appendix  3,  while  the  details  on  the  refinements  in  regards  to  Subprogram  II  are \nfurther  explained  in  Appendix  9.31  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \nAppendix 4.  \n \n\n1. \n\nImproving the Current Business Registration and Licensing Systems \n\n73. \n Two  implementing  decrees  to  the  NEL  are  in  the  process  of  being  issued  to  further \ndetail  the  Government\u2019s  new  policies  for  business  licensing  and  registration.  Subprogram  II \nCondition  (3-1)  requires  the  Government  to  assign  the  Task-Force  on  Enterprise  Law  and \nInvestment Law Enforcement to undertake a regulatory review existing as well as proposed new \nlicenses, as stated in Articles 7 and 172 of the Enterprise Law, including: (a) publication of all \neffective licenses, and (b) stakeholder-initiated regulatory reviews.  This is to ensure continuous \n\n \n                                                \n31  Accordingly, the Development Policy Letter from the Government is provided in Appendix 5.  \n\n\f  \n\n19\n\n \n\n \nmonitoring and improvements of the business regulatory systems.  This component is revised to \nreflect  the  spirit  of  the  New  Enterprise  Law.    ADB  intends  to  support  its  implementation  as \nrequired.   \n \nProgress  towards  implementing  the  NBIN  expansion  plan  in  all  provinces  and  some \n74. \ndistricts (Subprogram II Condition 3-2) is being made with the drafting of the new implementing \ndecree and circulars for business registration under the new NEL. These legal documents are \ndefining  the  new  registration  processes,  responsibilities  of  registration  agencies  at  all  levels, \napplication  forms,  registration  certificate  formats,  data  standardization,  business  classification \ncode,  and  other  information  critical  to  the  rollout  of  a  national  business  registration  system \nnationwide.  While  the  Government  had  already  developed  a  plan  for  NBIN  expansion  under \nSubprogram I of the SDPL, the promulgation of the NEL has required a review and adjustment \nof  this  plan.  The  plan\u2019s  revision,  approval,  and  implementation  will  now  be  supported  by \nSubprogram II Condition (3-3). \n \n\n2. \n\nEstablishing the Government\u2019s Policy and Institutional Framework for SME \nDevelopment \n\n75. \n Subprogram  II  loan  conditions  are  focused  on  securing  Prime  Ministerial  approval  for \nthe  SME  Development  Five-Year  Plan  2006\u20132010  (Condition  3-4),  publication  of  an  annual \nState  of  the  SME  Sector  report  (Condition  3-5),  and  operationalization  of  an  SME  information \nwebsite (Condition 3-6). Substantial progress has been made in all three of these areas. \n \n(3-4)   The  SME  development  action  plan  (\u201cSME  Development  Five-Year  Plan  2006\u20132010\u201d), \nprepared with SDPL support, was submitted to the Minister of Planning and Investment \nin  January  2006.  The  action  plan  is  finalized  with  the  integration  of  interministerial \ncomments and was submitted to the Prime Minister for approval.  \n\n \n(3-5)   The  State  of  the  SME  Sector  report,  which  is  to  be  issued  annually  to  monitor  the \nimplementation  progress  of  the  SME  Development  Five-Year  Plan,  will  require \nquantitative  indicators  on  SMEs  that  are  not  currently  being  collected.  ASMED,  with \nsupport from UNIDO and ADB, has (i) identified the data requirements for the report, (ii) \nidentified the source of the data, and (iii) defined the report template. It is expected that \nGSO and NBIN will provide critical data inputs to the report. \n\n \n(3-6)  The  ASMED\u2019s  new  online  SME  portal  was  launched  in  July  2006.  The  website  has \n\ninformation on markets, regulations, and other topics of interest to SMEs.   \n\n \n\n3. \n\nEnhancing SMEs\u2019 Access to Financial and Physical Resources \n\nThe  Government  has  made  good  progress  towards  completing  five  of  the  seven \n76. \nSubprogram  II  policy  actions  designed  to  enhance  SME  access  to  financial  and  physical \nresources. In the area of accounting development, there are three Subprogram II conditions. \n \n(3-7)  The  MOF  is  required  to  issue  a  decision  on  a  SME  accounting  system  based  on \nVietnamese and International Accounting Standards, which includes a simplified chart of \naccounts. \n\n \n(3-8)  The MOF is required to issue user-guidelines with instructions on: (i) simplified chart of \naccounts;  (ii)  system  of  accounting  books;  and  (iii)  formats  for  the  financial  reporting \nrequirements. \n\n\f20 \n \n \n \n(3-9)  The MOF and the Vietnamese Accounting Association are to conduct training programs \n\n \n\n(including production of training manuals) to train the SMEs and business associations. \n\n \nIt is expected that Conditions (3-7) and (3-8) will be met with the issuance of the MOF decision \non  the  new  SME  accounting  system  in  2006,  as  this  system  will  include  (i)  simplified  chart  of \naccounts;  (ii)  system  of  accounting  books;  and  (iii)  formats  for  the  financial  reporting \nrequirements,  all  of  which  have  already  been  developed  as  part  of  the  draft  SME  accounting \nframework.  With  the  expected  adoption  of  the  new  SME  accounting  system,  the  Government \nintends  to  implement  an  extensive  training  program  for  SMEs  (with  support  from  ADB) \nthroughout 2007, thereby meeting Condition (3-9). \n \nSubprogram  II  Condition  (3-10)  requires  MONRE  to  prepare  a  plan  for  the  national \n77. \nrollout  of  the  uniform  land  registration  system.  Progress  towards  meeting  this  condition  is \nrequired for Board consideration of loan processing of Subprogram II. Satisfactory progress has \nbeen  made,  with  an  initial  plan  developed  by  MONRE  in  October  2005,  which  is  now  being \nrefined  with  technical  assistance  from  the  World  Bank.  The  plan  will  cover  all  major  land \nadministration functions handled at the provincial level, including registration, and it is expected \nto begin implementation in 2008.  \n \nUnder Subprogram II Condition (3-11), the Government is to leverage the results of the \n78. \npilot  program  to  allow  the  expansion  of  sale  of  lease  receivables  to  any  institution,  and  if \nnecessary,  to  amend  the  legal  framework  to  allow  this  activity.  Provisional  guidelines  for  the \nsale of lease receivables (SBV Official Document No. 2585), developed for the pilot, state that \nany institution or individual may purchase lease receivables.32 Resale of the lease receivables is \nalso permitted, in which case the rights of the subsequent purchaser must be governed by any \nlimitations set out in the primary sale agreement. Compliance with this Subprogram II condition \ncan be met by formalizing the provisional guidelines for the sale of lease receivables. \n \n79. \nSubprogram  II  Condition  (3-12)  calls  for  the  MOJ  to  submit  to  the  Government  a  draft \nimplementing  decree  to  the  ordinance  on  registration  of  secured  transactions  which  permits \nanyone to obtain free non-certified reports through an Internet-based search of NRAST records.  \nIt should be noted that NRAST functions today as a paper-based registry, and as such already \nshares  reports  through  an  automated  facsimile  process.  To  enable  the  electronic  functions, \nlegislative reforms and information technology upgrades will be required, as per Subprogram II \nCondition  (3-13).  A  critical  first  step  in  this  direction  will  be  the  issuance  of  an  implementing \ndecree  for  prioritization  of  creditors'  and  lien  holders'  rights  upon  registering  their  interest  with \nNRAST,  as  per  policy  Condition  (2-10).  The  MOJ,  with  support  from  ADB,  has  submitted  the \ndraft decree to the Government in October 2006. \n \n\n4. \n\nEnhancing SMEs\u2019 Access to International Markets \n\n80. \nTo support SME access to international markets, Subprogram II has three policy actions \nrelated  to  the  legal  framework  for  technical  standards  and  certification  (Conditions  3-14,  3-15, \nand  3-16),  one  policy  action  related  to  institutional  reform  at  STAMEQ  (Condition  3-17),  and \nanother  related  to  SME  participation  in  standards  development  (Condition  3-18).  These \n                                                \n \n32  Much  of  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  leasing  is  being  undertaken  by  the  Viet  Nam:  Second  Financial \nSector Program Loan Cluster (ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors \non a Proposed Loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Second Financial Sector Program Loan Cluster. \nManila),  approved  in  2003.  The  cluster  supports  the  issuance  of  various  legal  documents  and  regulatory \nguidelines.  \n\n\f  \n\n21\n\n \n\n \nmeasures attempt to complete the reform agenda, consistent with WTO requirements, to make \nthe  legal  and  institutional  framework  more  transparent  and  accessible  to  the  public.  Overall, \nthese  efforts  ensure  that  the  technical  standards  legal  framework  supports  the  enterprises\u2019 \naccess to markets, and is not used as a barrier for both imports and exports.   \n \nC. \n\nImportant Features: Refined Actions for Subprogram II  \n\n81. \nFive  policy  actions  have  been  amended  and  two  more  added  to  reflect  the  changing \npace  and  context  of  the  reforms  under  the  SDPL.  In  the  area  of  business  licensing  and \nregistration,  proposed  revisions  comprise  (i)  amending  one  policy  action  (3-1)  proposing  a \nsystem  for  business  licenses  that  establishes  a  stronger  institutional  framework  for  effective \nlicensing  reform,  (ii)  amending  one  policy  action  (3-2)  calling  for  the  completion  of  the  NBIN \nexpansion  plan  to  one  that  recognizes  the  recent  promulgation  of  the  NEL  and  its  impact  on \nfuture  NBIN  functionalities,  and  (iii)  adding  a  policy  action  (3-3)  to  leverage  the  new  NBIN  to \nfurther simplify the business application process.  \n \nTo further enhance SMEs\u2019 access to financial and physical resources, one policy action \n82. \n(3-13)  related  to  operationalizing  the  electronic  functionalities  of  the  NRAST  was  reworded  to \nmake the scope of needed changes more  explicit.  \n \nTo further support SME access to international markets, (i) one policy action (3-15) was \n83. \nadded  to  support  the  implementation  of  the  Law  on  Product  Quality;  and  (ii)  a  second  policy \naction  (3-17)  was  amended  to  allow  more  resources  to  be  allocated  to  the  detailed \nimplementation plan for the legal separation of STAMEQ.  \n \n\n1. \n\nImproving the Current Business Registration and Licensing Systems \n\n84. \nAs  noted  above,  Subprogram  II  Condition  (3-1)  stipulates  that  the  Task-Force  on \nEnterprise Law and Investment Law Enforcement is assigned by the Government to undertake \na regulatory review existing as well as proposed new licenses, as stated in the Enterprise Law, \nincluding: (a) publication of all effective licenses, and (b) stakeholder-initiated regulatory reviews.  \nThis is expected to result in continuous monitoring and improvements of the business regulatory \nsystems.    This  component  is  revised  to  reflect  the  spirit  of  the  New  Enterprise  Law.    ADB \nintends to support its implementation as required.   \n \n85. \nOn business registration, with the promulgation of the NEL, the MPI now has the legal \nbasis to expand NBIN and its national business names database (per Condition 3-2). The SDPL \nwill continue to support ASMED with technical assistance for the implementation phase of this \nwork,  in  line  with  the  new  prescriptions  of  the  draft  implementing  decree  and  circulars  and  in \nclose collaboration with other ongoing donor programs, most notably UNIDO.  \n \n86.  While  the  new  national  business  registry  system  will  be  an  essential  management  tool \nfor ASMED, and will provide valuable statistical information for MPI and GSO, it is also meant to \nserve the business community by facilitating and enhancing the transparency of procedures for \nlegal compliance. This can be done by allowing a convergence of registration and tax codes, so \nas  to  eliminate  the  need  for  companies  to  register  with  both  the  Business  Registration  Office \nand tax authority, and to facilitate selected data sharing between the registry system and the tax \nauthorities. \n \n87. \nPrime  Ministerial  Instruction  1842/VPCP-CCHC  dated  7  April  2006  is  an  initial  step  in \nthis  direction.  It  requires  the  MPI,  MOF,  and  Ministry  of  Public  Security  to  issue  an  inter-\n\n\f(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n22 \n \n \nministerial circular describing new procedure for combining the issuance of business registration \ncertificates,  tax  codes,  and  business  seals  in  a  single,  \u201cone  stop  shop\u201d  process.  Ultimately, \nbusinesses  should  be  able  to  download  a  single,  standard  business  start-up  application  form \nfrom  the  Internet  (or  retrieve  it  from  their  provincial  registration  offices),  which  would  combine \nthe information requirements of the MPI, MOF, and Ministry of Public Security. In this way the \nbusiness  would  only  need  to  submit  one  form,  at  one  time,  to  complete  its  basic  business \napplication  process.33  To  support  these  initiatives,  Condition  (3-3)  has  been  added  to  develop \nand implement the new simplified application process in all provinces. \n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nEnhancing SMEs\u2019 Access to Financial and Physical Resources \n\n88. \nCondition  3-13  of  Subprogram  II  requires  the  MOJ  to  establish  NRAST  in  accordance \nwith the ordinance and implementing decree referenced in condition 3-11, i.e., in such a way as \nto  fully  enable  its  online  functionalities.  Technical  conversion  to  an  electronic,  web-based \nsystem  (required  for  compliance  with  the  condition)  will  require  enhancing  the  electronic \ncapacity  and  sophistication  of  the  registration  system,  and  completing  the  legal  framework  to \nenable  electronic  transactions.  Types  of  legislation  to  be  considered  will  include  e-commerce, \nwhich  would  have  provisions  for  the  acceptance  of  electronic  signatures,  documents,  and \npayments.34 To capture the scope of the required reforms and provide further support to MOJ \nunder the SDPL, policy Condition (3-12) has been amended to include:  \n \n\nthe  issuing  of  an  implementing  legal  normative  document(s)  that  enable(s)  an  \ne-Government service delivery model to be operated by NRAST for the purposes \nof secured transactions; and \n\nthe development of a project implementation plan for NRAST that includes: (a) a \ndetailed budget for the development of an online secured transaction registration \nsystem, (b) planned activities to increase public awareness, (c) capacity-building \nactivities for the system operators, and (d) a detailed project roll-out schedule.  \n\n \n89. \nFinally,  while  there  are  no  specific  changes  to  the  policy  conditions,  the  SDPL-\nSubprogram  II  will  continue  to  support  the  SMEs\u2019  access  to  finance  via  improving  the  legal \nframework on leasing as well as training the SMEs on the SME accounting system.  \n \n\n3. \n\nEnhancing SMEs\u2019 Access to International Markets \n\nTo  further  enhance  the  legal  framework  for  product  quality,  the  Government  plans  to \n90. \npromulgate a Law on Product Quality by the mid-2007. As part of its ongoing support of these \nreforms, the SDPL proposes to include the issuance of the implementing decree to this Law as \na  new  policy  action  (3-15)  under  Subprogram  II.    ADB  will  support  this  efforts  based  on \ncoordination with other donor agencies.  \n \n91. \nCondition  (3-17)  calls  for  the  Government  to  approve  and  implement  the  plan  for  the \nSTAMEQ\u2019s  separation  of  commercial  and  state  administrative  activities.  With  the  issuance  of \nDecree  115/2005/ND-CP  in  September  2005,  the  legal  basis  for  the  separation  of  the \ncommercial  and  administrative  activities  of  MOST  has  been  established,  but  detailed \n\n                                                \n \n33  In  this  regard  the  electronic  registration  already  available  in  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  is  noteworthy,  but  it  does  not  yet \n\ncombine the tax code and seal application requirements. \n\n34 The new Law on Electronic Transactions and its future implementing regulations are expected to guide electronic \n\nsignatures, submission of documents, and acceptance of payments. \n\n\f  \n\n23\n\n \n\n \nimplementation  planning  has  not  been  completed.  In  addition,  Circular  No.12/2006/TTLT/ \nBKHCN-BTC-BNV (June 2006) was issued to guide the implementation of Decree 115, on the \nautonomy  and  self-responsibility  mechanism  applicable  to  public  scientific  and  technological \ninstitutions. An AFD-funded TA, scheduled to begin by December 2006, will support STAMEQ in \nthis  effort.  The  implementation  plan  will  include  all  legal,  financial,  and  organizational \narrangements to complete the separation by the target date of 2009. Approval of the plan will be \nvia  a  prime  ministerial  decision  replacing  Decision  140  on  the  functionalities  of  STAMEQ. \nSTAMEQ  expects  that  this  process  could  take  more  than  18  months,  so  that  approval  of  the \nplan before June 2008 (end date of the SDPL) is unlikely. Because an intermediary step in the \napproval  process,  such  as  submission  of  the  detailed  plan  to  the  Government,  can  be \ncompleted within the timeframe of the SDPL, the condition has been reworded accordingly.  \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n92. \nThe  lending  modality  of  the  SDPL  is  a  program  cluster,  comprising  two  back-to-back \nsubprograms.  For  Subprogram  I,  an  ADB  loan  of  $60  million  equivalent  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF)  has  been  approved.  For  the  succeeding  Subprogram  II\u2014based  on \nresource availability and satisfactory performance of Subprogram I\u2014an ADB loan of $20 million \nequivalent from ADF is proposed. Further, the SDPL is being cofinanced by AFD and KfW. AFD \nis  providing  cofinancing  of  \u20ac35  million\u2014\u20ac22  million  for  Subprogram  I  and  \u20ac13  million  for \nSubprogram II. KfW has proposed cofinancing of \u20ac20 million\u2014\u20ac14 million for Subprogram I and \n\u20ac6 million for Subprogram II. \n \n93. \nThe total amount for the SDPL and loan amounts for the subprograms are determined \non the basis of the strategic importance of developing the SME sector and the costs of structural \nreforms  to  be  supported  under  the  SDPL.  Such  costs  arising  from  reform  measures  to  be \nimplemented are estimated to be around $190 million to $250 million equivalent during the 36 \nmonths  of  program  implementation.35  It  has  been  estimated  that  streamlined  licensing,  and \nbusiness  and  land  registration  procedures  will  reduce  fees  in  the  range  of  $35  million  to  $55 \nmillion  per  year.  Equipment,  software,  and  hardware  for  establishing  systems  in  support  of  a \nstreamlined  and  efficient  business  and  land  registration  systems  in  the  pilot  phase  will  incur \ncosts  of  approximately  $20  million.  Training,  including  for  those  at  local  and  district  levels,  is \nestimated  to  cost  $12  million  per  year.  Institutional  reform  measures,  including  those  for  the \nAgency for SME Development, Business and Land Registration Section at the district level, and \nSTAMEQ, are estimated to cost about $28 million. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n94.  MPI will be the Executing Agency for the SDPL. MONRE, MOF, MOST, MOJ, and SBV \nwill be the implementing agencies. MPI will be responsible for overall program implementation, \nincluding  administration  and  preparation  of  semiannual  progress  reports  on  program \nimplementation.  \n \n95. \nTo  coordinate  program  implementation  among  government  ministries  and  agencies \nconcerned, a program steering committee (PSC) was established for Subprogram I and will be \nmaintained  for  Subprogram  II.  The  PSC,  chaired  by  a  deputy  minister  of  MPI,  will  comprise \nsenior officers from all ministries and government agencies concerned (MOF, MONRE, MOST, \n\n                                                \n \n35 ADB estimates. \n\n\f24 \n \n \nMOJ,  and  SBV).  The  PSC  will  meet  twice  yearly  and  on  an  ad  hoc  basis  to  review  pending \nissues  and  propose  concrete  actions \ntimely  program \nimplementation. A program implementation and coordination unit will also be maintained within \nMPI  to  assist  the  PSC  and  ADB  in  implementing  the  Program.  The  unit  will  be  headed  by  a \nsenior  officer  of  MPI  and  staffed  with  MPI  officials.  The  unit  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nimplementation of the SDPL. \n \n\ntheir  resolution \n\nto  ensure \n\nfor \n\n \n\n2. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n96. \nIn accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram loans, all goods and services produced and originating in ADB member countries will \nbe  procured,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in  accordance  with  standard \npublic  procedures  in  Viet  Nam  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices  acceptable  to \nADB.36  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international  commodity  markets  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB. 37\n \nThe proceeds of the SDPL-Subprogram II will be disbursed for a broad range of imports, \n97. \nexcept for a list of ineligible items. The Borrower will certify that the value of total imports minus \n(i) imports from nonmember countries; (ii) ineligible imports; and (iii) disbursements made under \nother  official  development  assistance,  is  greater  than  the  amount  expected  to  be  disbursed \nduring the year. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the \naccuracy of the Borrower's certification.  \n \n\n3. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n98. \nThe  Government  has  assured  that  sufficient  funds  will  be  made  available  to  meet  the \ncosts  associated  with  the  reform  program  supported  by  the  SDPL-Subprogram  II.  Any \ncounterpart funds not required for the reforms will be used for general budget support. \n \n\n4. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\n99. \nThe  Government  and  ADB  (along  with  cofinanciers  in  AFD  and  KfW)  will  continue  to \nengage  in  active  policy  dialogue  on  sector  issues,  policy  reforms,  and  other  measures  during \nthe  SDPL-Subprogram  II  implementation  and  on  additional  reforms  that  may  be  considered \nnecessary or desirable.  \n \n100.  For  its  effective  implementation,  the  program  lending  modality  requires  an  appropriate \nregime  for  public  financial  management,  including  budget  development,  execution  and \nmonitoring,  external  fiscal  reporting,  and  transparency.  The  aid  community  in  Viet  Nam  has \nmade  collective  efforts  to  assess  the  status  of  the  public  financial  management  system  and \nII \nproduced  a  number  of  periodic  diagnostic  reports.  During \nimplementation, ADB will, from time to time, review reports on the public financial management \nsystem in Viet Nam prepared by other aid agencies and will request the Government to clarify \nand discuss issues identified in such reports. Overall, based on the fiduciary framework in place, \nand  the  experience  with  the  Subprogram  I  implementation,  it  seems  that  the  financial \nmanagement arrangements for the SDPL-Subprogram II appear to be sufficient. \n \n\nthe  SDPL-Subprogram \n\n                                                \n \n36  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n37  The list of ineligible items is in Appendix 7.  \n\n\f  \n\n25\n\n \n\n \n101.  The  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  consolidated  semiannual  reports  on  the  SDPL-\nSubprogram II implementation and accomplishment of objectives. The consolidated reports, to \nbe submitted in such form and detail and within the period that ADB may reasonably request, \nwill  cover  (i)  progress  made  and  specific  problems  encountered  during  the  6  months  under \nreview, (ii) steps taken or proposed to resolve the problems, and (iii) proposed SDPL activities \nand expected progress during the following 6 months. ADB will send regular review missions to \nconfirm compliance with conditions for the release for Subprogram II, and advise on actions to \nmaintain the SDPL-Subprogram II implementation on course. To the extent possible, the review \nmissions  will  be  fielded  jointly  with  AFD  and  KfW.  Within  3  months  from  completion  of  the \nSDPL-Subprogram II or at such time as deemed appropriate, the Government will prepare and \nsubmit  to  ADB  a  consolidated  program  completion  report  on  the  overall  impact  of  the  policy \nreforms implemented.  \n \n102.  Subprogram  II. The proposed loan for Subprogram II is processed separately after the \nsuccessful completion of Subprogram I and presented to the Board for approval. Subprogram II \ncomprises  a  loan  of  $20  million  equivalent  from  ADF.  It  is  designed  as  a  single-tranche  loan. \nThe  current  design  is  consistent  with  the  requirement  that  the  principal  concept  of  Board \nconsideration conditions must be maintained in Subprogram II. The conditions for Subprogram II \nare envisioned to be implemented within 18 months from its effectiveness.38  \n \n103.  Anticorruption  Policy.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  Government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the proposed \nSDPL. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the Loan Agreement. \n \n\nVII. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impact \n\nin  accessing  credit,  acquiring \n\n104. \nIn  resolving  legal,  institutional,  and  technical  constraints  that  place  SMEs  at  a \nland-use  rights,  and  achieving  regulatory \ndisadvantage \ncompliance,  the  SDPL-Subprogram  II  takes  a  market-based  participatory  approach.  For \ninstance,  the  SDPL  acknowledges  the  fundamental  role  of  information  for  markets  to  allocate \nresources  efficiently  and  the  essential  need  for  all  market  participants  to  have  access  to  that \nsame  relevant  public  information.  The  SDPL-Subprogram  II  also  attempts  to  utilize  current \ntechnology in making as much pertinent information as possible obtainable in the public domain.  \n \n105.  Subprogram II also attempts to further enhance the governance and transparency of the \nGovernment. In conjunction with the PARM, the SDPL includes various components to support \nthe  Government\u2019s  efforts  for  reducing  corruption.  Accordingly,  adopting  simple  and  uniform \nsystems and administrative procedures is the basic principle that guides the SDPL-Subprogram \nII.  Simple  and  uniform  systems  and  administrative  procedures  have  the  merit  of  avoiding \nconfusion,  arbitrariness,  and  rent-seeking  behavior  in  delivering  public  services,  particularly  at \nthe  provincial  and  district  levels.  They  also  bring  the  benefits  of  economies  of  scale  when \nimplemented through a nationwide system, thus reducing the total cost of service delivery; and \nthe cost of doing business for enterprises would also be reduced. Specific examples include (i) \n\n                                                \n \n38  Based on loan effectiveness, it is estimated that the tranche release for Subprogram II is expected in June 2008. \n\n\f \n\n26 \n \n \nbusiness licensing and registration procedures, (ii) simplified accounting system for SMEs, (iii) \nprocedures for issuance of LURCs, and (iv) uniform standardization systems.  \n \n106.  Accordingly,  in  sum,  the  SDPL-Subprogram  II  has  continued  the  reforms  initiated  in \nSubprogram I and concentrate on the following: (i) improving key legal and regulatory structure, \n(ii)  facilitating  greater  transparency  through  improved  information  flows,  (iii)  enhancing  policy \nstructure through stakeholder consultation and feedback in policy formulation, and (iv) seeking \nbetter governance through private sector participation in regulatory activities of the Government. \nThese positive elements incorporated in the SDPL-Subprogram II will increasingly be felt as the \nexisting  systems  are  transformed  and  modernized  to  better  support  a  progressively  market-\noriented  economy.  Successful  implementation  will  form  the  basis  for  further  developing  the \nprivate sector in Viet Nam.  \n \nB. \n\nRisks and Safeguards \n\n107.  There are four principal risks in implementing the SDPL-Subprogram II. The first involves \nensuring effective coordination and cooperation within the government, both horizontally among \ndifferent  ministries  and  agencies  concerned  and  vertically  with  the  provincial  and  district \nauthorities. Consultation and coordination with the private sector and the aid community active \nin  SME  development  will  also  be  required.  It  is  expected  that  coordination  and  cooperation \namong  all  stakeholders  will  gradually  improve  with  the  increased  coordination  capacity  of \nASMED, thus reducing the risk of overlap and inconsistencies in SME support activities. TA in \nsupport  of  SDPL  implementation  will  also  include  capacity  building  for  ASMED  to  reduce  this \nrisk. \n \n108.  A  second  risk  pertains  to  good  governance  (particularly  as  related  to  effective  and \ntransparent  implementation  of  the  existing  policies  and  laws)  in  the  central,  provincial,  and \ndistrict  governments.  Governance  at  the  provincial  and  district  level  is  particularly  important, \nsince the positive impact of the SDPL requires effective implementation of policies at the ground \nlevel. Also important is the need for the Government to allocate sufficient resources and staffs \nfor  policy  implementation.  These  risks  are  common  to  several  programs  and  are  being \naddressed  through  the  implementation  of  the  comprehensive  Public  Administration  Reform \nMaster Program (PARM) for 2001\u20132010, which is being supported by ADB.39\n \n109.  A  third  risk  relates  to  the  technical  capacities  of  implementing  agencies.  Experience \nsuggests  that,  given  adequate  technical  support,  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  reforms  is \nstrong.  In  implementing  previous  programs,  delays  were  caused  predominantly  by  the  lack  of \ntechnical expertise and of the consensus-building approach in enacting of laws and regulations. \nTo reduce this risk, the TAs from ADB, AFD, and KfW have been formulated and implemented \nthrough  discussions  with  all  implementing  agencies  at  the  technical  level.  Many  requirements \npertain to completing the legal framework and putting in place modern information technology-\nbased systems, taking into consideration the experience of other countries. The SDPL will also \ninvolve coordination with aid agencies in their respective areas in each component. As ADB has \nbeen serving as a co-chair of the donor coordination committee, this remains an important task.  \n \n\n                                                \n \n39  ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Program Loan \nCluster, Phase I of the Proposed Program Loan and Technical Assistance Grants to the Socialist Republic of Viet \nNam  to  Support  Implementation  of  the  Public  Administration  Reform  Master  Program.  Manila  (approved  for  $45 \nmillion on 19 January). \n\n\f  \n\n27\n\n \n\n \n110.  Finally,  the  final  risk  relates  to  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  implement  the \nnecessary reforms. The SPDL contains the issuance of a number of legal documents.  While a \ngood progress has been made to meet the conditions, this does not necessarily lead to effective \nimplementation of the legal documents.  As noted above, the effective implementation requires \ngood  capacity,  coordination  among  key  agencies,  and  political  commitment.    For  Viet  Nam, \nhowever,  such  commitment  seems  to  be  clear\u2014particularly  based  on  the  successful \nSubprogram  I  implementation.  The  fact  that  Viet  Nam  is  accessing  to  the  WTO  regime  also \nindicates \nfor  market-based  development.  The  new  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Plan  also  emphasizes  the  importance  of  SME  Development.  The  Design  and \nMonitoring  Framework  (Appendix  1)  has  been  enhanced  to  ensure  that  ADB  can  effectively \nexamine the implementation progress. \n \n\ntheir  commitment \n\nVIII.  ASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n111. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n(i) \n\nThe policies adopted and actions taken before the date of the Loan Agreement of SDPL \nSubprogram II as described in the development policy letter will continue to operate. \n\nThe  Government  will  promptly  adopt  the  policies  and  actions  included  in  SDPL \nSubprogram II, and specified in the development policy letter of SDPL, and will ensure \nthat such policies and actions continue to operate. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n112.  As  a  subprogram,  SDPL-Subprogram  I  does  not  have  specific  conditions  for  loan \neffectiveness. The Government has assured that the following loan effectiveness conditions for \nthe SDPL cluster as originally agreed will be maintained: (i) establishment and maintenance of \nthe PSC; and (ii) establishment and maintenance of a program implementation and coordination \nunit,  responsible  for  day-to-day  program  implementation,  headed  by  a  senior  officer  of  MPI \n(ASMED) and staffed with MPI officials. \n \nC. \n\nConditions for Disbursement \n\n113.  The  disbursement  of  the  single  tranche  under  SDPL-Subprogram  II  is  subject  to \nfulfillment  of  specified  tranche  release  conditions  and  satisfactory  compliance  with  the  overall \nprogram, as set out in the policy matrix in Appendix 3.  \n \n\nIX. \n\nPRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION AND RECOMMENDATION \n\n114. \nIn  view  of  the  substantial  progress  made  in  the  implementation  of  Subprogram  I  and \nsubstantial  compliance  with  each  of  the  16  conditions  for  release  of  the  second  tranche  of \nSubprogram I, I, acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of \nthe  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  have  authorized  the  release  of  the  second  tranche  of  the \nSDPL-Subprogram I. In accordance with the established procedure, the release of the second \ntranche will be effected not less than 10 working days after the circulation of this report. \n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n \nB. \n\n\f28 \n \n \nI am also satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \n115. \nADB  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the  provisions  of

This new segmentation further breaks out the SME category into microenterprises (fewer \nthan 10 persons), small enterprises (10 to 49 persons) and medium-sized enterprises (50 to 299 \npersons). While data on SMEs are not yet collected according to this segmentation, the formal \nadoption of the SME Development Plan will provide the needed mandate going forward. \n \nB. \n\nSize and Diversity of the SME Sector: 2000\u20132004 \n\n2. \nAlthough  improving,  data  on  the  SME  sector  in  Viet  Nam  are  still  limited.  The  main \nsources of data are the national statistical network with data collected by the General Statistics \nOffice  (GSO),  and  the  National  Business  Information  Network  (NBIN)  of  the  MPI.  Some \ntentative  conclusions  as  to  the  size  and  diversity  of  the  sector  can  be  drawn,  using  data \ncollected by these organizations for other purposes.  \n \n3. \nTable  A2.1  outlines  the  overall  profile  of  formal  enterprises  in  Viet  Nam  from  2000  to \n2004. About 165,000 enterprises have been registered under the 1999 Enterprise Law since its \nenactment  in  2000.  This  number  does  not  include  the  several  hundred  thousand  registered \nhousehold  and  small  enterprises  without  tax  codes,  or  the  several  million  informal  household \nenterprises not obliged to register at local government offices.1\n \n\nTable A2.1: Number of Firms in Viet Nam, 2000\u20132004 \n\nType of Firm \n   SOEs  \n   Non-SOEsa\n   FIEs \nTotal \nSOEs (% of total) \nNon-SOEs (% of total) \nFIEs (% of total) \n\nTotal \n\n2000 \n\n5,759 \n35,004 \n1,525 \n42,288 \n13.6 \n82.8 \n3.6 \n\n100 \n \n \n\n2001 \n\n5,355 \n44,314 \n2,011 \n51,680 \n10.4 \n85.7 \n3.9 \n\n100 \n \n \n\n2002 \n\n5,364 \n55,236 \n2,308 \n62,898 \n8.5 \n87.8 \n3.7 \n\n100 \n \n\n \n\n2003 \n\n2,641 \n\n4,845 \n\n2004 \n4,596 \n64,526  84,003 \n3,156 \n72,012  91,755 \n5.1 \n91.6 \n3.4 \n100 \n33.5 \n39 \n\n100 \n31.8 \n30 \n\n6.7 \n89.6 \n3.7 \n\nPrivate sector share in employment (%) \nPrivate sector share in domestic bank credit (%) \nFIE = foreign invested enterprise; SOE = state-owned enterprise.  \na Almost 90% of the registered enterprises are considered as SMEs. \nSource: General Statistics Office. \n\n \nFurthermore, other indicators that identify the performance of private enterprise in the economy, \nincluding  share  of  employment  and  share  of  bank  credit,  indicate  the  positive  trends  in  the \ndevelopment of the sector.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   The Establishments Census conducted  by  the General Statistics Office in 2003 showed that Viet Nam had more \n\nthan 2.7 million business establishments engaging over 8.3 million people in 2002. \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nIn  1998  there  were  592,234  non-tax-coded  enterprises.  The  number  increased  to \n4. \n649,284 in 2002, and to an estimated 800,000 in 2004. These enterprises are assumed to be \nsmall  in  size  and  scope  of  operation.  As  there  are  no  systematic  statistical  data  on  these \nenterprises, the analysis will assume that enterprises without tax codes have registered capital \nbelow D10 billion, employ fewer than 300 employees, and hence are also SMEs.  \n \n5. \nGSO  data  allow  the  disaggregation  of  only  those  enterprises  with  tax  codes,  as \nillustrated  in  Table  A2.1.  The  data  show  that  the  number  of  non-SOEs  since  2000  has  grown \nmore  rapidly  than  SOEs  or  FIEs,  with  non-SOEs  representing  91.6%  of  the  total  number  of \nformal registered firms with tax codes. The number of SOEs is observed to have declined from \n6,498 in 1998 to 4,596 enterprises in 2004 due to SOE equitization. \n \nTable A2.2 shows that based on the registered capital criterion, at the end of 2004, there \n6. \nwere 79,420 formal enterprises with registered capital below D10 billion.2 SMEs accounted for \n86.6% of total enterprises. The proportion of SMEs in comparison to large firms seems to have \nremained fairly stable during 2000\u20132004.  \n \n\nTable A2.2: Classification of Formal Firms by Registered Capital \n\n \n \nRegistered Capital \n\nSMEs \nLess than 1 billion \n1\u20135 billion \n5\u201310 billion \n\nTotal SMEs \n\nLarge Firms \nGreater than 10 \nbillion \n\nTotal Firms \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n% of \nTotal \nFirms \n\nNumber \nof Firms\n\n% of \nTotal \nFirms\n\nNumber \nof Firms\n\n% of \nTotal \nFirms\n\nNumber \nof Firms\n\n% of \nTotal \nFirms \n\nNumber \nof Firms\n\nNumber \nof Firms \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n   \n\n \n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n22,801  53.9    26,729\n25.4   14,556\n10,759 \n3,385\n2,745 \n36,305  85.9    44,670\n\n6.5  \n\n51.7\n28.2\n6.5\n86.4\n\n29,585\n20,141\n4,490\n54,216\n\n47.0\n32.0\n7.1\n86.2\n\n31,744\n24,737\n5,496\n61,977\n\n44.1   39,378\n34.4   32,739\n7,303\n86.1    79,420\n\n7.6  \n\n   \n\n% of \nTotal \nFirms\n\n \n\n42.9\n35.7\n8.0\n86.6 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5,983 \n\n14.1  \n\n7,010\n\n13.6\n\n8,692\n\n13.8\n\n10,035\n\n13.9   12,335\n\n13.4\n\n42,288  100.0    51,680\n\n100.0\n\n62,908\n\n100.0\n\n72,012\n\n100.0   \n\n91,755\n\n100.0\n\nSME = small- and medium-size enterprise. \nSource: General Statistics Office. \n \nTable A2.3 shows that in 2004, 88,222 enterprises (96.1% of total enterprises) had fewer \n7. \nthan  300  employees.

However,  since  the  SMEs \nconstitute  an  overwhelming  proportion  of  enterprises  in  Viet  Nam,  their  contribution  to  GDP  is \nregarded  as  significant.3  Though  data  on  the  contribution  of  the  SME  sector  to  the  national \neconomy are not available, it can be assumed that the SME contribution is largely equivalent to \nthat contributed by the  non-state sector. Table A2.5 shows the reported GDP contributions by \nSOEs, non-SOEs, and FIEs. In 2004, the state sector contribution was about 39%; non-SOEs \ncontributed  about  46%  and  FIEs  about  15%.  Since  1998,  the  relative  contribution  of  foreign-\ninvested enterprises to GDP has risen 5%, while that of non-state enterprises has declined by \n4.4% and that of SOEs by 1%. In considering strictly industrial output, the total contribution of \nthe private sector rose to 63% in 2004, up from 52% in 1998. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n3   See, for example, United Nations Industrial Development Organization\u2013Ministry of Planning and Investment. 1999. \nAssistance  to  Industrial  SMEs  in  Viet  Nam.

Thus,  one  can  say  that \nalmost  all  non-state  registered  enterprises  are  SMEs.

Industrial growth is drawing on inexpensive labor and \nimproved infrastructure. Manufacturing, which accounts for about half of industry\u2019s value added, \nhas been a major contributor to gains in both output and employment, with output rising by 13% \nin  2005.  Furniture  and  electronic  goods  account  for  a  fast-rising  share  of  total  manufactured \nexports  and,  though  the  growth  of  clothing  and  footwear  decelerated,  they  are  still  important. \nOverall, the proportion of light manufactured goods in total exports increased from 36% in 2001 \nto an estimated 40% in 2005. \n \n13.  Market  liberalization  continues  as  an  integral  part  of  the  country\u2019s  World  Trade \nOrganization  (WTO)  accession.  Official  recognition  of  the  private  sector\u2019s  contribution  to \neconomic  activity  is  increasingly  explicit,  improving  the  prospects  for  further  reforms  toward  a \nmarket-based  economy.  In  2005,  the  National  Assembly  passed  a  new  Enterprise  Law  and  a \nCommon  Investment  Law,  designed  to  boost  private  investment  by  reducing  administrative \nbarriers  to  business  development  and  to  facilitate  WTO  membership.  Efforts  to  improve  the \nbusiness climate have helped generate strong growth in both domestic private investment and \nforeign  direct  investment  (FDI).  Enterprise  registrations  are  rising  rapidly,  with  162,672  new \nenterprises  registered  during  2000\u20132005,  more  than  3.2  times  more  than  in  1991\u20131999  (see \nFigure A.2). 5 Some 39,951 private enterprises were newly registered in 2005, up from 14,400 in \n2000. \n \n\nFigure A2.1: Growth in Number of Registered\nFigure A2: Growth in Number of Registered \n \n-\n-2005\nEnterprises and Capital 2000 2005\nEnterprises and Capital 2000\n\n120000 \n120,000\n100000 \n100,000\n\n80,000\n80000\n\n60,000\n60000\n\n40,000\n40000\n\n20,000\n20000\n\n0\n0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2000\n2000\n\n2001\n2001\n\n2002\n2002\n\n2003\n2003\n\n2004\n2004\n\n2005\n2005\n\nregistered capital\nregistered capital\n\nregistered enterprises\nregistered enterprises\n\n \n\n \n14. \nPrivate  sector  expansion  has  been  supported  by  increased  access  to  finance.  The \nprivate  sector  share  of  total  domestic  bank  credit  grew  from  30%  in  2003  to  40%  in  2005. \nSimplified  processes  for  LURC  issuance  and  secured  transactions  have  expanded  the  use  of \ncollateral,  further  supporting  this  trend.  According  to  the  State  Bank  of  Vietnam,  the  annual \ngrowth rate of banking credit to SMEs rose to an estimated 22% in 2005, up from 20% in 2004.  \n \nD. \n\nSupporting Legislative Changes \n\n \n\n15. \nThe  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  supporting  SME  sector  development  has  been \ndemonstrated  in  a  series  of  legislative  and  institutional  reforms  since  2004.  The  principal \nreforms affecting the SME sector, and which have been supported by SDPL-Subprogram I, are \nsummarized below. \n\n                                                 \n5   Source: Agency for SME Development, 2006 \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nLeveling  the  playing  field.  The  new  Enterprise  Law  and  Common  Investment \nLaw,  promulgated  in  November  2005  and  taking  effect  on  1  July  2006,  further \nleveled  the  playing  field  for  all  enterprises  (private,  state-owned,  foreign), \nreduced the scope of the Government to impose licensing and other restrictions \non business, and simplified the licensing and registration process. Implementing \ndecrees  for  these  laws  are  currently  under  development,  and  as  such,  the  net \nimpact of these new laws on the SME sector will be measurable only after 2006.  \n\nImproving  access  to  resources.  The  principal  inhibitor  to  SME  growth,  as \ndetermined  by  numerous  surveys  and  statistical  analyses,  is  the  difficulty  in \naccessing  finance.  The  Government  has  been  addressing  this  constraint  by \nfurther  formalizing  the  use  of  collateral  assets  (e.g.,  land  use  right  certificates \n[LURCs],  movable  property)  and  the  mechansims  necessary  for  their  effective \nuse  in  securing  bank  finance  (e.g.,  land  valuation, 6   LURC  issuance  and \nregistration  systems, 7   secured  transaction  registration,  and  sale  of  lease \nreceivables).  Pilot  exercises  to  implement  the  simplified  LURC  issuance  and \nregistration  processes  have  been  conducted  in  three  provinces  in  2005/2006, \nresulting  in  a  set  of  documented  workflows  that  can  now  be  rolled  out  to  other \nprovinces.  Development  of  the  National  Registration  Agency  for  Secured \nTransactions  (NRAST)  and  supporting  legislation,  most  notably  amendments  to \nthe Civil Code and implementing decrees to allow the prioritization of creditor and \nlien-holder  rights,  have  facilitated  the  use  of  both  movable  and  immovable \nproperty  as  collateral.  Activity  at  NRAST  has  been  increasing  every  year, \nreaching  an  average  of  1,800  registered  transactions  per  month  in  2005.  Pilot \nexercises for the sale of lease receivables, conducted from April to August 2006, \nresulted  in  D105  billion  worth  of  transactions  as  of  the  end  of  June  2006.  To \nfurther  simplify  the  process  of  applying  for  credit  and  assessing  credit  risk,  the \nGovernment  has  developed  a  new  SME  accounting  framework,  based  on  the \nnew  general  accounting  system  adopted  by  the  Government  in  March  2006.8 \nThis framework will allow SMEs to use a more simplified set of accounts, better \nsuited to their business activities and resources.  \n\nImproving  the  policy  environment.    Under  the  SDPL,  the  Agency  for  SME \nDevelopment  issued  the  country\u2019s  first  formal  SME  development  strategy.  The \nSME  Development  Five-Year  Plan  2006-2010  is  a  long-term,  multisectoral  and \ninterministerial  program  designed  to  focus  and  integrate  government  policy \nactions in support of the sector. The Action Plan was submitted to the Minister of \nPlanning and Investment in January 2006, and is currently being finalized before \nsubmission to the Prime Minister for approval. The Action Plan, once approved, \nwill  give  the  Government  the  ability  to  more  effectively  gather  data  on  SMEs  in \norder to track progress and guide future policy development. \n\nOpening  up  export  markets.  Viet  Nam  has  seen  strong  export  growth  since \n1997, with an average annual growth rate of 14% between 1997 and 2003, 30% \nin  2004,  and  20%  in  2005.  Exports  represented  approximately  58%  of  GDP  in \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\n                                                 \n6   Decree 188/2004/ND-CP and Circular 114/2004/TT-BTC. \n7   Circular  29/2004/TT-BTNMT  of  1  November  2004,  Decree  181/2004/ND-CP  of  29  October  2004,  Decision \n\n24/2004/QD-BTNMT, and Circular 01/2005/TT-BTNMT of 13 April 2005.  \n\n8   MOF Decision 15/2006/QD-BTC. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n43 \n\n2004.  Rapid  export  growth  has  been  aided  by  bilateral  and  regional  trade \nagreements  that  came  into  effect  during  this  period,  most  notably  the  ASEAN \nFree  Trade  Area  (AFTA)  and  the  US  Bilateral  Trade  Agreement.  In  addition, \nWTO  commitments  are  likely  to  preserve  the  momentum  toward  domestic \nreforms. Further removal of tariff and non-tariff trade barriers and barriers to FDI \nwill  facilitate  the  introduction  of  new  technology,  increased  productivity,  and  the \ndevelopment of a more competitive economy. Moreover, when it does join WTO, \nViet Nam will be eligible for most-favored nation treatment by WTO members and \nwill  no  longer  be  subject  to  quotas\u2014a  crucial  point  for  the  textile  and  clothing \nindustry (as well as footwear to some degree). \n\n \n16. \nFurther supporting the development of export markets has been the country\u2019s efforts to \nimprove  the  quality  of  domestic  manufacturing.  Various  milestones,  including  (i)  establishment \nof  industry  quality  standards;  (ii)  certification  mechanisms;  and  (iii)  mutual  recognition \nagreements  with  trading  partners,  have  facilitated  the  access  of  domestic  firms  to  foreign \nmarkets.  Legislative  reforms  in  support  of  export  development  (supported  by  the  SDPL)  have \nincluded (i) Decree 179/2004, providing for State Management over Goods Product Quality; (ii) \nDecision 50/2006, detailing the list of import and export products for which quality needs to be \nchecked by the state; (iii) the new Law on Standards and Technical Regulations (promulgated in \nJune  2006);  and  (iv)  Decree  115/2005,  calling  for  the  separation  of  the  commercial  and \nadministrative  activities  of  STAMEQ.  By  the  end  of  2005,  the  number  of  firms  receiving  ISO \n9001-2000 certification increased to 1,682, up 5% from 1,598 in 2004. Similarly, the number of \nfirms receiving the National Quality Award increased from 96 in 2004 to 132 in 2005.  \n \nQuantitative indicators of the impact of reforms supported through SDPL-Subprogram I \n17. \nshould become more pertinent in 2006\u20132008, as implementation takes hold with the adoption of \nand  new  polices,  procedures,  tools,  and  legislative  frameworks.  The  momentum  of  reforms \ncreated  under  SDPL-Subprogram  I  is  evident  in  the  progress  made  to  date  in  anticipation  of \nSubprogram  II  policy  actions.  Rapid  growth  of  the  private  sector,  including  increasing \nformalization  of  SMEs  (as  evidenced  by  the  surge  in business  registrations) is set to  continue \nunder SDPL-Subprogram II.   \n \n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nPOLICY MATRIX \n\n \nDevelopment Goal:  Fostering  an  enabling  policy  and  regulatory  environment,  eliminating \nstructural  barriers  constraining  the  access  of  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs)  to  key  resources\u2014credit  and  land-use  rights,  and \nsupporting  SMEs\u2019  market  entry  by  improving  the  technical  standards \nframework. \n\n \n\nSubprogram I: \n(1st Tranche Conditions) \nNovember 2004 \n\nSubprogram I: \n(2nd Tranche Conditions) \nNovember 2004\u2013October  2006 \n\n \nSubprogram II: \nJanuary 2007\u2013July 2008 \n\nI.

Since  the  early  1990s,  sustained  overall \neconomic  growth  and  private-sector-led  employment  generation  have  actually  been  major  contributors  to  a  sharp \ndecline in poverty in Viet Nam. The Viet Nam Household Living Standard Survey in 2004 showed that the poverty rate \nfell  from  58%  in  1993  to  19.5%  in  2004.  Improvements  in  the  social  conditions,  such  as  education  levels  and  infant \nmortality, have been reflected in an increase in the country\u2019s ranking in the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s \nhuman development index.2   \n \nIn turn, the poverty assessment by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in its country strategy and program (CSP) for \n2007\u20132010 endorses the contribution of economic growth to poverty reduction, with particular attention to the roles of \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and associated job creation in the industry and service sectors.3   \n \nIn  particular,  the  proposed  Subprogram  II  of  the  SME  Development  Program  Loan  (SDPL)  Cluster  will  support \nimplementation  of  the  country\u2019s  new  Enterprise  Law,  which  is  envisaged  to  ease  entry  barriers  to  start  up  formal \nbusinesses through reform in registration and licensing procedures. In the medium term, resulting competition among \nenterprises is expected to stimulate the economy\u2019s overall productivity, raising the potential growth rate. The benefits \nof improved productivity will be multiplied by improved access to financial resources by enterprises, also addressed by \nthe  SDPL,  further  enriching  the  growth  potentials.  In  Viet  Nam,  a  strong  positive  correlation  has  been  empirically \nobserved  between  a  rise  in  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and  poverty  reduction  over  the  past  decade \n(based on Viet Nam Living Standards Surveys in 1993, 1998, and 2002)4 and, if this trend continues in the years to \ncome, growth-oriented reforms supported by SDPL are likely to contribute positively to poverty reduction in an indirect \nmanner. \n \nSDPL-supported reforms would also have critical importance to mitigate the temporary adverse impacts, if any, which \nmay  result  from  Viet  Nam\u2019s  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  and  other  reforms  for  the  country\u2019s \ntransition  to  a  market  economy.  In  the  process  of  trade  liberalization  adjustment,  factors  of  production\u2014including \nlabor\u2014would  have  to  shift  from  less  productive  sectors  to  more  productive  ones.  Through  streamlining  the  formal \nprocesses to start up new businesses, the SDPL  will facilitate this adjustment process  by creating new  employment \nopportunities in the emerging competitive sectors, and hence relieve its negative impacts on the poor.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \n\nTargeting Classification: General Intervention \n\nThe findings from a number of empirical cross-country studies indicate a positive correlation between improvements in \nthe  business  environment  and  factors  that  contribute  to  poverty  reduction.  For  instance,  the  quartiles  group  of \ncountries  ranked  as  being  less  restrictive  on  business  have  been  experiencing  relatively  higher  economic  growth \n(2.6%)  compared  with  a  groups  of  countries  with  a  more  difficult  business  environment  (1.0%),  and  relatively \nbusiness-friendly  countries  are  achieving  a  higher  level  of  human  development.5  Empirical  cross-country  evidence \n\n                                                 \n1  The Poverty Partnership Agreement was signed on 25 February 2002.   \n2  ADB. 2006.

Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n51 \n\nalso confirms a positive correlation between facilitative procedures to start up a business and productivity.6 Listening \nto the poor in 50 countries across the globe revealed that a majority perceives starting a business as an effective way \nout of poverty, and the unemployment rate is lower in countries where doing business is less difficult.7\n\nApart  from  these  cross-country  evidences  that  point  to  the  positive  impacts  of  creating  an  enabling  business \nenvironment for the poor, what may deserve specific attention in the context of SDPL implementation in Viet Nam are \nthe  effects  of  its  land  policy  reforms  components.  As  transaction  of  land  use  right  certificates  (LURCs)  becomes \neasier, less productive households, which may comprise the poor, can choose to transfer the land they have received \nto more productive entities. This phenomenon may potentially bring about landlessness among the poor. However, in \nViet Nam, the population group that faces potential landlessness is the emerging middle class, rather than the poor, \nbecause they tend to move out of poverty at the time they move out of farming (which is land-intensive in nature). It is \nestimated that roughly three quarters of the overall increase in landlessness is associated with the decline in poverty.8 \nThus, more active land transaction is expected to bring about positive impacts on poverty reduction, and would not be \nan immediate cause for concerns. Rather, it is expected that formalization of the poor\u2019s de facto properties, such as \nLURCs,  would  allow  proper  use  of  these  as  collaterals  and  hence  improve  access  to  finance,  which  in  turn  would \nincrease their income opportunities.  \n\n No  \n\n Yes \n\n Yes     \n\nIn summary, no adverse impact requiring mitigating measures has been identified to result from SDPL implementation. \n  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nNo formal stakeholder analysis is required.

To achieve the target for reducing incidence \nof  poverty  in  the  country,  there  must  be  rapid  economic  growth,  social  progress  and  equity,  and \ndevelopment  of  a  corruption-free  and  strong  state  apparatus.  Sector  strategies  for  achieving  these  goals \nhave been delineated in the Socioeconomic Development Plan and the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction \nand Growth Strategy (CPRGS). \n\n2. \n To sustain rapid economic growth, realize social progress and equity and develop a corruption-free \nand  strong  state  apparatus,  the  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  establishing  an  enabling \nenvironment for the private sector, the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in particular, which make up \nmajority  of  the  private  sector.  CPRGS  targets  reduction  of  poverty  incidence  by  approximately  12 \npercentage points between 2001 and 2010. Economic growth required for Viet Nam to realize such target \nwill increasingly be dependent on the performance of the private/SME sector, perceived as the main engine \nfor the next round of economic growth. \n\n3. \nViet  Nam  has  made  series  of  efforts  in  support  of  the  private  sector.  The  Communist  Party \nResolution  14/NQ-TW  (2002)  and  Prime  Minister's  Decision  94/2002/QD-TTg  (2002)  formally \nrecognized the private sector as an important pillar for economic development and employment generation. \nTo  support  the  SMEs,  the  Government  also  issued  Decree  90/2001/ND-CP  on  \"Support  for \nDevelopment of SMEs\" in November 2001 and officially indicated for the first time its solid commitment \nto  support  SME  development  in  Viet  Nam.  Further,  with  the  promulgation  of  the  new  Enterprise  Law \n(NEL) in November 2005, the Government has laid the foundation for the continued reforms to promote \nthe development of the SME sector. \n\n4. \nThe  Government  recognizes  the  fact  the  SME  sector  still  faces  many  challenges  in  creating  an \nenabling  business  environment  in  Viet  Nam  due  in  part  to  its  incomplete  policy,  legal,  and  institutional \nframeworks  in  support  of  business  operations.  However,  the  Government's  commitment  to  meet  and \novercome these challenges is strong in order to establish an environment conducive to the development of \nan efficient, market-oriented SME sector. The process for building such an environment is viewed by the \nGovernment as being indispensable for the country to achieve its target economic growth and prosperity that \nis free of poverty. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n   \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\n \n\n \nA. \n \n\n5. \nTo establish an environment conducive to development of an efficient market-oriented SME sector, \nthe Government agrees with the need to undertake the proposed Subprogram II under the support of SME \nDevelopment  Program  Loan  Cluster  (SDPL)  from  ADB  and  put  in  place:  (i)  improved  current  business \nregistration  and  licensing  systems;  (ii)  policy  and  institutional  framework  for  SME  development;  and  (iii) \nSME's enhanced access to financial and physical resources; (iv) legal framework for land to allow market-\nbased transactions; and (v) SME's enhanced access to international markets. \n\nImproving the Current Business Registration and Licensing Systems \n\n6. \nAlthough  the  original  Enterprise  Law  simplified  business  registration  by  reducing  time,  cost,  and \ndocumentation  requirements,  recent  guidelines  and  their  interpretation  by  local  authorities  have  not  been \nconsistent with the law, resulting in further complications for SMEs. Similarly, while the number of licenses \nrequired decreased after the Enterprise Law was passed, new licenses have emerged, imposing an additional \nburden  on  both  SMEs  and  the  government  administration.  There  is  a  clear  need  to  rationalize  existing \nlicenses and to apply standard approaches to limit the number of new licenses. While the business licensing \nreform  plan,  as  a  decree  under  the  NEL,  has  been  drafted,  the  Government  is  committed  to  further \nestablish the institutional capacity to implement it effectively, so as to fully reflect the specific features and \noverall spirit of the new NEL. \n\n \n\nEstablishing Policy and Institutional Framework for SME Development \n\n \n7. \nEffectively  of  the  new  NEL  in  July  2006  has  launched  the  new  phase  of  related  reforms.  These \ninclude  an  expansion  of  the  National  Business  Information  Network  (NBIN)-the  business  registration \nsystem-to  cover  at  least  5  provinces  and  to  provide  information  to  the  private  sector  on  licensing \nrequirements  and  procedures.  In  addition,  a  legal  framework  to  further  improve  the  registration  process, \nwhich will occur based on inter-ministerial coordination, will be issued as well. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nThe many and varied constraints facing SMEs mean that their development requires vision, strategic \ndirection, and effective coordination between the different stakeholders in policy delivery, both horizontally \nand  vertically.  There  has  in  the  past  been  no  overall  national  development  plan  that  could  fulfill  these \nfunctions. Support programs remain uncoordinated and often overlap, reducing their impact. \n \n9. \nThe  Government  formulated  an  SME  development  action  plan,  but  its  implementation  requires \nfurther assistance. In particular, the action plan needs to be disseminated to major stakeholders and SMEs \nand  an  assessment  made  of  its  overall  impact  -  in  a  form  of  report  on  the  state  of  the  SME  sector.  The \nGovernment  also  needs  support  for  the  coordinated  implementation  of  its  policy  and  institutional \nframework for the development of the SME sector, including more active involvement by the private sector. \nThe Government is also keen to have ADB play an important role in stakeholder coordination and has been \nserving as the co-chair of the SME partnership group (made up of funding agencies, government agencies, \nand private sector representatives). Further, as a system to disseminate the necessary information to SMEs \nhas been developed, it will require support for effective implementation and maintenance. \n \nC.  \n \n10. \nAccess to finance remains one of the most critical issues for the SMEs. The costs and risks related \nto lending to SMEs need to be addressed. First, the Government has recognized that limited access to land \nuse  rights  certificates  (LURCs)  reduces  their  use  for  collateral  purposes.  The  legal  and  regulatory \nframework  under  which  LURCs  are  issued  needs  to  be  formalized  and  registration  procedures  for \nsubsequent  transactions  need  to  be  streamlined  and  unified.  SMEs'  access  to  finance  would  also  be \nimproved  by  an  effective  secured  transactions  registry  that  clearly  prioritizes  creditors'  and  lien  holders' \n\nEnhancing SME's Access to Financial and Physical Resources \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 5          55 \n\n \n\nCompleting the Legal Framework for Land to Allow Market-based Transactions \n\nrights upon  registration. Lack  of  collateral  is  compounded  by  unreliable  financial  information  on  SMEs. \nHere,  it  is  important  to  ensure  effective  functionalities  of  the  registries  for  both  land  and  movable \nproperties  -  based  on  sound  legal  framework,  which  the  Government  is  committed  to  formulate  and \nimplement. Second, financial reporting requirements are felt to be complex and difficult to comply with. \nImplementation  of  the  simplified  SME  accounting  system  that  adheres  to  International  Accounting \nStandards  needs  to  be  promoted.  Considerable  training  is  needed  to  ensure  that  SMEs  are  fully  familiar \nwith the accounting- system and guidelines. Finally, as leasing represents a key financial product for SMEs, \nthe  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  has  been  working  to  specify  policies  and  procedures  for  (i)  sale  of  lease \nreceivables, (ii) sale and lease back transactions and (iii) syndicated leasing. A pilot program was launched \nin  March  2006  to  test  the  sale  of  lease  receivables.  Continued  improvements  in  the  current  legal \nframework are envisioned. \n \nD. \n \n11.  The  Government  improved  the  LURC  issuance  process  in  a  group  of  pilot  provinces  and  will \nformulate a plan for a full nationwide expansion of the process. Based on the Law of 2003, registration \nprocesses emphasized transparency, simplification, uniformity and standardization and compliance within \nthe current legal framework. Electronic linkages were developed between the land transaction offices and \ntwo  other  principle  regulators  in  the  land  administration  framework  (the  departments  of  the  natural \nresources  and  environments  and  the  Local  People's  Committee),  so  that  data  on  land  use,  ownership  and \nsubdivision changes could be shared. In the next phase, the Government aims to plan for a national rollout \nof  the  registries  for  land.  In  addition,  the  Government.  is  also  committed  to  effectively  implement  new \nguidelines  for  land  valuation  for  use  by  local  authorities  (Decree  188/2004/ND-CP  and  Circular \n114/20041TT-BTC).  Market-based  land  valuation  is  a  key  innovation  of  the  new  Land  Law,  as  land  has \ntraditionally been priced by People's Committees for purposes of taxation and compensation \n \nE. \n \n12. \nAs SMEs look to access international markets, a good framework on technical standards helps to \ncreate a common trading language, and reduce costs for manufacturing and warehousing. For governments, \nstandards offer an opportunity for deregulation and improved governance as they help to ease the level of \nregulatory  details  to  essential  requirements  for  health  protection,  safety,  and  the  environment. \nStandardization is therefore a key part of microeconomic infrastructure that is still in the development phase \nin Viet Nam. The Government is committed to developing industrial and technical standards in conformity \nwith best international practices, which promote participation of all stakeholders, including SMEs. This will \nbe  achieved  through  improving  the  current  legal  framework.  Also,  it  will  ensure  that  involved  institutions \nwill be reformed to separate its commercial and public administrative activities, and will function based on \npublic private pay partnership. \n\nEnhancing SME's Access to International Markets \n\n \n\nPROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION \n\n \n13. \nThe  Government  understands  that  successful  Subprogram  II  implementation  depends  on  the \nability  of  the  Executing  Agency  to  undertake  reform  measures  in  a  timely  manner.  Strong  support  will  be \nrequired  from  all  Government  ministries  and  agencies  concerned  as  well  as  the  ability  of  the  Executing \nAgency to coordinate and execute the Program components to fully meet the objectives of the Subprogram. \nAs  such,  the  Government  has  chosen  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  as  the  Executing  Agency. \nContinuance  of  the  existing  SDPL  Program  Steering  Committee  (PSC)  ensures  that  the  Subprogram  is \nimplemented  as  planned.  The  PSC,  chaired  by  Vice  Minister  of  MPI,  comprises  senior  officers  from  all \nministries  and  government  agencies  concerned,  including  the  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and \nEnvironment, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Justice, and State Bank \nof Viet Nam. Likewise, the SDPL Program Implementation and Coordination Unit within MPI, headed by a \nsenior officer of MPI (Agency for SME Development), assists the PSC and ADB on the responsibility for \nday-to-day implementation of the Subprogram. \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\n \n14. \nconditions are fully implemented. \n \n\nThe  Government  will  dedicate  counterpart  funds  generated  from  the  loan  to  ensure  that  policy \n\nTHE GOVERNMENT'S REQUEST \n \n\n15. \nThe Government Emily believes that economic development can only be sustained by undertaking \nrefonn measures that would improve economic efficiency and productivity of the country. Prior consultation \nand  dialogue  with  ADB  have  put  in  place  the  frameworks  as  well  as  the  sequence  of  necessary  actions  to \nenhance the business environment for SMEs. \n \n16. \nThe Government is committed to undertake the policy actions under Subprogram II of the SDPL. \nThe Government is confident that it can implement the proposed reforms and achieve the objectives of the \nSDPL.  The  Government  will  therefore  seek  ADB's  consideration  for  a  program  loan  of  $20  million  to \nsupport the policy reforms committed under Subprogram II of the SDPL. The Government will collaborate \nclosely with ADB in implementing the proposed reforms to facilitate the process and ensure that it conforms \nto the requirements of the Subprogram. \n\n17.  With the successful implementation of the SDPL, the Government aims to support development of \nthe  SME  sector  in  Viet  Nam.  This  would  be  a  necessary  condition  for  sustaining  Viet  Nam/s  economic \n\ngrowth and thereby reduce incidents of poverty in the country. \n\n \n\nYours sincerely, \n\n \n\nVo Hong Phuc  \nMinister \nMinistry of Planning and Investment \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n\nAppendix 6   \n\n57 \n \n\nProject/Program \n\nSource \n\nTiming\n\nRationale and Demand for Assistance \n\nCost  \n\n1.

In the Law, Article 7 establishes the \nlegal basis for licensing reform, and Article 172 authorizes the \nGovernment agencies to implement the required reform. ADB will \ncontinue to assist the Government for effective implementation as \nrequired.  \n\nComplied with. \nAn NBIN expansion plan was prepared by the Ministry of Planning and \nInvestment (MPI) in December 2004, and further updated in December \n2005 with support from the SME Development Program Loan (SDPL). It \nlays out the functional requirements for linking all provinces and districts \nto a central national business registry, as per requirement (a) of the \ncondition. Chapter II (articles 13-37) of the November 2005 UEL sets out \nthe rights and obligations of enterprises and business registrars to \nestablish and manage business registration information, including a \nnational business names database, as per requirement (b) of the \ncondition. In September 2005, MPI issued Decision 867/QD-BKH which \nprovides the budgetary basis for the NBIN expansion, per requirements \n(a) and (d). Compliance with requirement (c) is also addressed in \nCondition 2-4 regarding the SME information gateway. MPI drafted a \ndecree on business registration, which is expected to be issued by \nAugust 2006. Based on the prescriptions of the decree and associated \ncirculars, MPI will initiate NBIN expansion. \n\nComplied. \nThe SME Promotion Council has authorized the Agency for SME \nDevelopment to draft the SME Development Five Year Plan 2006-2010, \nand a draft was submitted by the Minister of Planning and Investment to \nthe Prime Minister in January 2006.  The draft is currently being updated \nby MPI to integrate inter-ministerial comments, and it is expected to be \napproved by the Government by the second quarter of 2006.  It is a long \nterm, multi-sectoral and inter-ministerial SME development plan as \nrequired by the condition.  \n\nSecond Tranche  \nRelease Policy Actions \n\n(2-1)  To streamline the \nbusiness registration and \nlicensing process, the Prime \nMinister to issue a Decision on \nabolishment, supplementation \nor amendment of the \ninappropriate regulations \nstipulated in all types of \nexisting licensing based on the \nrecommendations made by the \nTask Force on Enterprise Law \nEnforcement (\u2018Task Force\u2019) in \naccordance with Directive \n27/2003/CT-TTg. \n\n(2-2)  To enhance the \nmechanism for business \nregistration and collect \ninformation on SMEs, the \nGovernment to approve a plan \nto expand and maintain the \nNational Business Information \nNetwork (NBIN) which: (a) \ncovers all provinces and \ndistricts including specific time \nschedule; (b) incorporates an \non-line national business \nnames database; (c) has \nlinkages with the General \nStatistics Office and SME \ninformation gateway; and (d) \nincludes a capital and \noperational budget. \n\n(2-3)  To ensure a \ncoordinated SME development \nstrategy, the Minister of MPI, \nas the Chairman of the SME \nPromotion Council, to issue a \ndecision authorizing the \nAgency for SME Development \nto draft a long-term, multi-\nsectoral, and inter-ministerial \nSME development action \nprogram enabling detailed \nimplementation of Decree 90, \nin line with the SME Roadmap. \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n62 \n \n \n\nSecond Tranche  \nRelease Policy Actions \n\n(2-4)  To enhance \ninformation flow to the SMEs, \nthe MPI to approve a plan for \nan on-line SME-information \nwebsite (\u201cinformation \ngateway\u201d) which includes: (a) \ninformation on market, \ngovernment regulations, and \nother topics of interest to \nSMEs; (b) an SME statistical \ndatabase; (c) linkages with the \nGeneral Statistics Office and \nthe NBIN; and (d) a capital and \noperational budget and time-\ntable for the implementation. \n\n(2-5)  To rationalize the \nregulations on SME \naccounting, the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) to issue \nclarifications to Decisions 1177 \nand 144 on the Accounting \nSystem of SMEs to make them \nconsistent with the new \nAccounting Law and the new \nVietnamese accounting \nstandards. \n\n(2-6)  The Government to \nissue a decree on measures \nfor land pricing and price frame \nfor types of land. \n\n(2-7)  To enable wider use of \nland use rights as collateral on \na nation-wide basis, the \nMinistry of Natural Resources \nand Environment (MONRE) to \nestablish, on a pilot basis, at \nleast three provincial-level, \ninter-linked land registries with \na standardized system of \nregistration. \n \n\nStatus of Implementation \n\nComplied with. \nWith support from the United Nations Industrial Development \nOrganization (UNIDO), ASMED has developed an SME portal  \n(www.business.gov.vn). The website provides dynamic content on \nmarkets, government regulations, and other topics of interest to SMEs, \nincluding datasheets on all 309 business licenses currently in effect (as \nper requirement (a) of the condition). The website also has links to the \n10-province NBIN (as per requirement (c) of the condition), and other \ngovernment institutions. As NBIN is expanded to all 64 provinces, the \nwebsite will link into the nationwide business names database. SME \nstatistics (as per requirement (b) of the condition) are also available on \nthe website. The website\u2019s second version, to be developed after the \nPrime Minister approves the Plan, will include statistics from the annual \nState of the SME Sector reports to be prepared by ASMED. A link to \nGSO, which currently is not provided, will be added once GSO has been \ngiven the mandate to collect data on SMEs and a revised definition of \nSMEs has been agreed, as is envisaged in the SME Development Plan \n2006\u20132010.  \n\nComplied with. \nThe new SME accounting system will be composed of a framework and \nimplementing guidelines, both consistent with the revised general \naccounting standards (GAS), issued by MOF in March 2006. With \nsupport from ADB, MOF completed a framework for the new SME \naccounting system, and has issued Decision 48/2006/QD-BTC in \nSeptember 2006 as the detailed implementing guidelines. This decision \nreplaces Decisions 144 and 1177 and meeting the second tranche \nrelease condition.  \n\nComplied with. \nThe Government issued Decree 188/2004/ND-CP (on matters related to \nland, land use, pricing, and land valuation) in November 2004, and also \nCircular 114/2004/TT-BTC (operational and technical guidelines for the \nimplementation of the Decree).   \n\nComplied with. \nWith support from ADB, MONRE identified pilot land transaction offices \n(LTOs) in (i) Ha Nam, (ii) Thai Binh, and (iii) Bac Ninh; and secured \nagreement from the provincial People\u2019s Committees to conduct the pilot \nfrom October 2005 to January 2006. The pilot facilitated the \nestablishment of three pilot LTOs with documented standardized \nworkflows for land use rights certificate (LURC) issuance. The pilot \nidentified a process for sharing information electronically among the \nlocal agencies and LTOs. The three LTOs agreed in principle to use a \nstandard registration process, which was consistent with existing \nlegislation. The standard workflows and documents developed during \nthe pilot can be used for the development of (i) a guideline for drafting \namendments to implementing decrees and circulars for more efficient \nissuance of LURCs, and (ii) a provincial rollout strategy and plan \n. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nSecond Tranche  \nRelease Policy Actions \n\n(2-8)  To facilitate \ndiversification of funding \nsources of financial leasing \ncompanies, SBV to: (a) obtain \nGovernment approval of an \namended Decree 16 that \nallows financial leasing \ncompanies the sale of lease \nreceivables; and (b) issue \nimplementing guidelines for the \nsale of lease receivables, for \nsale and lease back \ntransactions and for syndicated \nleasing. \n\n(2-9)  SBV to allow financial \nleasing companies to \nimplement the sale of lease \nreceivables on a pilot basis. \n\n(2-10)  To increase lending \nsecured by movable property, \nthe Ministry of Justice (MOJ) to \nsubmit to the National \nAssembly a draft legal \nnormative document which, \nupon enactment, establishes a \nsystem of prioritization of \ncreditors' and lien holders' \nrights upon registering their \ninterest at the National \nRegistration Agency for \nSecured Transactions \n(NRAST). \n\n(2-11)  To enhance access to \nland use by SMEs and also to \nencourage a more active \nmarket for land use (and land \nuse rights certificates), the \nMONRE to issue a circular \nwhich stipulates uniform \nprocedures which includes  \ninformation collection for all \nlocal agencies on issuance of \nland use certificates and \nsubsequent registration of land \nuse rights. \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n63 \n\nStatus of Implementation \n\nComplied with. \nDecree 65, amending Decree 16 to permit sale of finance lease \nreceivables, was issued in June 2005. SBV has also issued three \nseparate implementation guidelines on (i) sale of lease receivables \n(Guidelines 09/2006/TT-NHNN, on 23 October 2006), (ii) sale and \nleaseback transactions (Guidelines 07/2006/TT-NHNN, on 7 September \n2006), and (iii) syndicated leasing (Guidelines 08/2006/TT-NHNN, on 12 \nOctober 2006).  \n\nComplied with. \nWith support from KfW, the following financial institutions have been part \nof the pilot: (i) Viet Nam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, (ii) \nViet Nam International Leasing Company, (iii) Asia Commercial Bank, \nand (iv) Bank for Industrial Development of Viet Nam. The pilot began in \nMarch 2006 and is expected to run through August 2006.         \n\nComplied with. \nThe National Assembly approved the amendments to the Civil Code in \nJune 2005, and they became effective in January 2006. The amended \nCivil Code, together with its draft implementing decree on secured \ntransactions, establishes a system of prioritization of creditors' and lien \nholders' rights upon registering with NRAST. This draft decree was \nsubmitted to the Government on 28 September 2006. This decree, for \nwhich ADB has been providing assistance, will replace Decree \n165/1999.   \n\nComplied with. \nInformation collection by local agencies regarding LURC issuance and \nregistration is also covered in Circular 29/2004/TT-BTNMT of  \n1 November 2004, which guides the compilation, adjustment \nmanagement, and dissemination of cadastral documents. Furthermore, \nas Decree 181/2004/ND-CP of 29 October 2004 stipulated that uniform \nprocedures be used for LURC registration, Decision 24/2004/QD-\nBTNMT specified the format and content of LURCs. As a related legal \ndocument, MONRE issued Circular 01/2005/TT-BTNMT on 13 April \n2005 to guide the implementation of a number of articles of the \nGovernment\u2019s Land Law Implementing Decree 181/2004/ND-CP.  \nDecree 17/2006/ND-CP was issued in January 2006 to supplement \nDecree 181, and Decree 187/2004/ND-Cp was issued related to \nconverting state-owned enterprises into joint stock companies. Circular \n01/2005 provides additional guidelines for these procedures as they \nrelate to the issuance, amendment, and withdrawal of LURCs.
