A  technical\nassistance (TA) grant will be provided on approval of the SSSDP.\n\nFrom  1921  to  1990  Mongolia  achieved  high  levels  of  human\ndevelopment with no recorded poverty. Since 1990 poverty levels\nhave risen to over 35 percent, with real unemployment estimated\nat  over  17  percent.  Among  the  most  adversely  affected  are  the\nelderly, disabled, children, and single parent families. Government\npolicy  for  poverty  reduction  is  to  (i)  reduce  unemployment,  (ii)\nprovide  essential  social  welfare  services  for  the  most  vulnerable\nwho  are  incapable  of  working,  and  (iii)  provide  social  insurance\nservices  to  support  working  people  at  risk  of  falling  into  poverty.\nCivil  society  has  also  become  active  in  addressing  poverty\nthrough providing informal social security services.\n\nHowever,  much  of  the  formal  social  security  system  has  shown\nitself  to  be  increasingly  ineffective.  In  particular,  its  emphasis  on\nuniversal  coverage  has  proven  unsustainable  given  severe\nbudgetary  constraints.  Average  disbursements  to  more  than  the\nover 228,000 beneficiaries of the Social Assistance Fund in 2000\namounted to just $3.82 equivalent per person per month. There is,\ntherefore,  an  urgent  need  to  focus  public  resources  more  on  the\npoorest to allow for increased levels of assistance per beneficiary.\nIn  addition,  the  Government  needs  to  mobilize  communities  and\nto work with the private sector to increase resources and improve\nefficiency  of  social  services  provided  to  the  most  vulnerable.\nCombating  unemployment  is  hindered  by  the  low  coverage  of\nemployment  services,  including  retraining  and  job  counseling,\nwhich reach only a small proportion of the unemployed. The ability\nof  social  insurance  systems  to  prevent  people  from  falling  into\npoverty  has  also  been  curtailed  by  the  falling  number  of  people\ncontributing  to  the  schemes  and  employers\u2019  low  levels  of\ncompliance with compulsory contributions. Arrears of public sector\nagency social insurance payments exceed $3.1 million equivalent.\n\nReform is, therefore, necessary to ensure that the social security\nsystem  can  serve  Mongolia\u2019s  needs.  Top  priorities  must  be  the\nmaintenance  and  improvement  of  social  welfare  services  for  the\nmost  vulnerable:  the  elderly,  disabled,  and  children,  and  single-\nparent  families.  At  the  same  time,  the  system  needs  to  help  the\nunemployed  and  underemployed \nfind  productive  and\nsustainable jobs.\n\nto \n\n\fii\n\nincluding \n\nlack  of  experience \n\nExternal  support  is  required  for  restructuring  the  social  security\nsystem  given  the  Government\u2019s  financial  and  technical  capacity\nconstraints, \nin  market-based\nsystems. This process will require investments at both policy and\ninvestment levels for social welfare, employment promotion, social\ninsurance,  and  improved  sector  planning.  Loan  resources  will  be\ndirected  at  establishing  effective  and  sustainable  social  security\nsystems  in  line  with  the  development  requirements  of  modern\nMongolia.\n\nClassification\n\nCore Poverty Intervention\nThematic: Human Development\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nCategory  C:  Environmental  implications  were  reviewed  and  no\nsignificant adverse environmental impacts were identified.\n\nThe Sector Development Program\n\n    Objectives and Scope\n\nThe  sector  goals  are  to  reduce  poverty  and  increase  security\namong  vulnerable  groups  by \nincreasing  employment  and\nproviding essential social security services for those incapable of\nworking.  The  specific  purpose  of  the  SSSDP  is  fully  compatible\nwith  the  sector  goals  and  aims  to  strengthen  the  social  security\nsystem\u2019s  ability  to  deliver  essential  welfare,  insurance,  and\nemployment services to the ultra poor, very poor, and those close\nto the poverty line.\n\nAs a core poverty intervention, the SSSDP will include both direct and\nindirect poverty interventions. Policy reforms to social welfare services\nand  benefits,  employment  services,  and  social  insurance  systems\n(unemployment  and  occupational  injury  and  disease  insurance),  will\ndirectly benefit up to 820,000 people, of whom 72 percent live below\nthe  poverty  line.  Primary  beneficiary  groups  are  people  with\ndisabilities,  the  elderly,  female-headed  households,  the  unemployed,\nand  children  in  difficult  circumstances.  The  SSSDP  will  contribute  to\nhuman development by providing employment-oriented education and\ntraining  for  the  unemployed  and  vulnerable groups,  including  people\nwith disabilities. The SSSDP will also improve the quality of life for the\npoor  who  depend  on  social  welfare  services  by  improving  existing\nservices  and  developing  community-based  social  welfare  services\nmore sensitive to local needs and demands.\n\nThe  investment  project  will  directly  assist  2,500  poor,  especially\npeople  with  disabilities  and  the  elderly  in  difficult  circumstances,  by\nupgrading nursing services and the National Center for Rehabilitation\nof  the  Disabled.  In  addition,  three  pilot  social  security  centers  will\nimprove service provision to more than 5,000 poor clients. Targeting\nthe  extremely  poor,  the  investment  project  will  initiate  community-\nbased  projects  supporting  4,000  people.  The  investment  project  will\nalso aim to promote employment of the poor by educating and training\n14,000  unemployed  people  and  developing  essential  employment\n\n\fiii\n\nadvisory and counseling services.\n\nDevelopment  of  a  social  security  master  plan  will  indirectly  benefit\npoor  people  by  improving  social  welfare,  social  insurance,  and\nemployment  services.  The  intervention  will  contribute  to  a  shift  from\nuncoordinated  short-term  interventions  to  a  more  effective  system,\nwhich will address poverty reduction on a sustainable basis.\n\nThe SSSDP will consist of a policy program with four policy areas and\nan  investment  project  with  four  components.  Associated  with  the\nSSSDP  will  be  an  advisory  TA  for  strengthening  policy  for  social\nsecurity reform.\n\nimprove \n\nthe  quality  and  coverage  of  services \n\nThe  SSSDP  will  support  the  development  of  comprehensive\npoverty reduction policies focusing on employment promotion and\nthe provision of essential social welfare and insurance services to\nthe most vulnerable, who are unable to work. The SSSDP will aim\nthrough\nto \nstrengthening Government capacities and fostering the role of the\nprivate  sector  in  providing  social  security  services,  in  a  bid  to\nmobilize additional resources and to achieve greater efficiencies.\nThe  SSSDP  will  also  promote  long-term  strategies  for  the\ndevelopment  of  social  security  in  Mongolia,  covering  a  10-year\nperiod.\n\nThe policy loan will support (i) improving the quality and coverage\nof  social  welfare  services  and  benefits,  (ii)  developing  pro-poor\nlabor  market  policies,  (iii)  strengthening  participation  in  social\ninsurance    (unemployment  and  occupational  injury  and    disease\ninsurance), and (iv) developing a social security master plan.\n\nCapacity building is included in each component of the investment\nproject,  including  support  for  central  and  local  government\nagencies, \ncommunity-based\norganizations.\n\nnongovernment \n\nand \n\nand \n\n     Policy Framework\n     and Actions\n\n      Capacity Building\n\n      The Investment Project The  investment  project  shares  the  same  structure  as  the  policy\nprogram  portion  of  the  SSSDP  and  focuses  on  reducing  poverty\nthrough  promoting  employment  while  addressing  the  needs  for\nsocial welfare and insurance services of the most vulnerable. The\nproject aims to develop the Government\u2019s capacity to provide high\nquality services and to expand coverage while fostering the role of\nthe private sector in service development and provision.\n\nThe  project  has  four  components  with  several  subcomponents.\nThe  social  welfare  component  includes  (i)  developing  and\nupgrading  social  welfare  service  facilities  for  the  elderly  and\ndisabled, (ii) developing community-based social welfare services,\nand (iii) strengthening the State Social Welfare Agency\u2019s capacity\nfor  social  welfare  management.  The  employment  promotion  and\nimprovement  of  working  conditions  component  includes  support\n\n\fiv\n\n(iii)  capacity  building \n\nfor (i) demand-driven skills training for the unemployed and poor;\n(ii)  entrepreneurship  development  for  the  unemployed  and  poor;\nfor  employment  services  and\nand \nimprovement  of  working  conditions,  including  support  for  the\nCentral  Employment  Regulation  Office  and  the  Labor  and  Social\nWelfare  Inspection  Agency.  The  social  insurance  component\nincludes support for (i) social insurance management in the State\nSocial Insurance General Office, and (ii) training social insurance\nlevels.  The  project\ninspectors  at  provincial  and  district \nmanagement  support  component  will  assist  the  executing  and\nimplementing  agencies \nthe  efficient  and  effective\nimplementation of project activities.\n\nin \n\nSocial  and  environmental  assessments  indicated  that  no  SSSDP\nelements  will  have  an  adverse  impact  on  the  poor,  or  on  the\nenvironment.  The  integrated  package  of  policy  measures  and\ninvestments in social security services will both directly and indirectly\nbenefit the poor and the unemployed living throughout the country.\n\nto  support \n\nA  loan  of  $8  million  equivalent  is  proposed  from  ADB\u2019s  Special\nFunds  resources \nto  meet\nadjustment costs of $9.5 million. The loan will have a maturity of\n24  years  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years.  Interest  will  be\ncharged at 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5\npercent thereafter.\n\nthe  policy  program, \n\nThe  loan  will  be  used  over  four  years  from  the  date  of  loan\neffectiveness. The loan funds will be disbursed in three tranches,\nthe  first  of  $2  million  and  two  subsequent  tranches  of  $3  million\neach.  The  first  tranche  will  be  released  upon  loan  effectiveness.\nThe  second  tranche  will  be  released  24  months  after  the  initial\ntranche,  when  five  conditions  have  been  met.  The  third  tranche\nwill  be  released  when  four  more  conditions  are  met,  48  months\nafter release of the first tranche.\n\nThe proceeds of the policy loan will be used to finance the foreign\nexchange  cost  of  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB\u2019s\nmember  countries  (other  than  items  specified  in  a  negative  list\nand  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources).\nEligible  items  will  be  procured  through  normal  commercial\npractices  by \nthe  private  sector  or  standard  Government\nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB  for  procurement  by  the  public\nsector.\n\nThe  counterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  support  the  costs  of  the\npolicy program. Any counterpart funds not required for the policy\nprogram will be used first to finance local currency costs of other\nADB-financed  projects  and,  second,  for  general  development\n\n     Social and\n     Environmental\n     Measures\n\nThe Policy Loan\n     Loan Amount and\n     Terms\n\n     Program Period and\n     Tranching:\n\n      Counterpart Funds\n\n      Executing Agency\n\nThe Ministry of Finance and Economy\n\n      Procurement\n\n\fv\n\npurposes.\n\nThe Investment Loan\n\n       Loan Amount and\n       Terms\n\n      Executing Agency\n      and Implementation\n      Arrangements\n\n      Procurement and\n      Consulting Services\n\nThe total project cost is $10 million equivalent.

Interest will be charged at 1 percent per annum during\nthe grace period and 1.5 percent thereafter.\n\nThe  investment  loan  project  will  be  cofinanced  by  the  Nordic\nDevelopment  Fund  (NDF)  on  a  parallel-financing  basis.  The\nproposed NDF loan is for $4 million equivalent. The loan will have\na  maturity  of  40  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  10  years.  A\nservice charge of 0.75 percent per annum and a commitment fee\nof 0.5 percent per annum will be levied.\n\nThe  Executing  Agency  for  the  investment  project  will  be  the\nMinistry  of  Social  Welfare  and  Labor  (MSWL).  The  Ministry  of\nEducation, Culture and Science (MECS) will be the Implementing\nAgency  for  skills  training  for  the  unemployed  and  poor  and\nentrepreneurship development subcomponents of the investment\nproject. To ensure effective implementation, a steering committee\nwith  broad  representation  chaired  by  the  Minister  of  Social\nWelfare and Labor has been created.\n\nAll procurement under the ADB loan will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement. Procurement of equipment, vehicles, and\nfurniture will be awarded based on international shopping. Civil works\ncontracts  up  to  $300,000  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  local\ncompetitive  bidding.  Small  contracts  valued  at  less  than  $100,000\nequivalent  each  may  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  direct  purchase.\nSmall-scale  civil  works  may  be  carried  out  on  the  basis  of  force\naccount  or  community  participation,  depending  on  their  nature.\nConsulting  services  include  50  person-months  of  international  and\n153 person-months of domestic consulting services.

The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $0.72  million  equivalent,\ncomprising  $0.45  million  in  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $0.27\nmillion  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  provide  $0.6\nmillion  on  a  grant  basis  to  finance  the  entire  foreign  exchange\ncost and part of the local currency cost.\n\n\f     Risks and safeguards\n\nvi\n\nAlthough  the  Government  is  committed  to  the  policy  measures\nsupported  by  the  SSSDP,  a  potential  risk  to  the  policy  program  is  a\ndelay in implementing policy actions due to institutional constraints of\nsocial  security  agencies  or  unexpected  socioeconomic  problems.\nSafeguards include a three-tranche structure to encourage sustained\npassage  of  reforms  and  a  period  of  one  year  between  the  third\ntranche  and  the  end  of  the  program  to  give  adequate  time  for  the\ncompletion  of  the  reform  program.  In  addition,  most  of  the  policy\nmeasures  are  integrated  with  components  of  the  investment  project\nand  associated  TA,  so  that  support  is  indirectly  provided  for\nimplementing the policy measures.\n\nA  potential  risk  for  the  investment  project  involves  the  provision  of\nadequate  counterpart  financing.  The  governance  program  approved\nby ADB in 1999 will, however, reduce such risks by improving public\nexpenditure management.\n\nThe successful implementation of the project will also depend on the\ncapacity  of  the  social  security  agencies  at  national,  provincial,  and\ndistrict  levels.  All  project  components,  however,  comprise  capacity\nbuilding  and  training  activities  to  address  this  issue.  In  addition,  the\nproject  management  support  provided  under  the  investment  project\nincludes assistance for improving monitoring and evaluation systems.\n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\n1.\nI submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on two proposed\nloans  to  Mongolia  for  the  Social  Security  Sector  Development  Program  (SSSDP).  The  Report\nalso describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening Policy for Social Security\nReform,  and  if  the  proposed  loans  are  approved  by  the  Board,  I,  acting  under  the  authority\ndelegated to me by the Board, shall approve the TA.\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nIn  1996,  the  Government  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  to\ndevelop an investment proposal for poverty reduction and social protection activities to address\nthe  needs  of  the  poor,  including  the  most  vulnerable1,  the  unemployed,  and  those  at  risk  of\nslipping into poverty. In response, ADB undertook a sector review in mid-1997 and approved a\nTA to support the design of a sector development program (SDP) proposal for social safety net\nstrengthening.2  Although the 1998 country assistance plan included the proposed Social Safety\nNet SDP, the SDP was removed from the pipeline because the Government was dissolved on\n24  July  1998.  Processing  of  all  proposed  loan  projects  was  halted  until  ADB  could  confirm\ninvestment priorities with the Government.\n\nIn February 2000, the Government reiterated its request for ADB assistance to support\n3.\nthe social safety net. Other key stakeholders also confirmed the need to reform the social safety\nnet to help reduce poverty. An ADB fact-finding mission subsequently visited Mongolia in April\n2000 to define the objectives and scope of the Social Safety Net SDP.\n\n4.\nFollowing general elections in July 2000 and the formation of a new Government by the\nMongolian People\u2019s Revolutionary Party, a preappraisal mission was fielded in November 2000\nto review the proposed SDP taking into account changes in priorities and policy directions of the\nnew  Government,  changes  in  ministerial  structures,  and  the  Poverty  Partnership  Agreement\n(PPA) between the Government and ADB. Agreement was reached on revising the objectives\nand overall scope of the SDP to focus on a narrower range of issues in the Government\u2019s social\nsecurity system.3 The SDP\u2019s name was changed to the Social Security SDP (SSSDP).\n\nThe  ADB  appraisal  mission  was  fielded  in  February  2001.4  To  ensure  full  consultation\n5.\nwith  all  stakeholders  a  national  consultative  workshop  was  held  in  April  2001.  Members  of\nparliament, local and central government officials, civil society organizations, the private sector,\nand  the  international  funding  community  endorsed,  and  provided  extensive  feedback  on  the\nscope and activities of SSSDP.\n\n6.\nThis report is based on the various TA reports; consultations with the Government, civil\nsociety,  international  organizations,  and  other  stakeholders;  findings  of  the  Mission;  and\nsubsequent work by ADB staff. Appendix 1 presents the program framework.\n\n                  \n\n1 The most vulnerable groups are  the elderly, disabled, children and single-parent families.\n2 TA 2978-MON: Social Safety Net Strengthening, for $985,000 approved on 31 December 1997.\n3 The  principal  elements  of  the  system  are  (i)  social  welfare  (ii)  social  insurance  (iii)  employment  promotion  and\n\ncreation and (iv) ensuring minimum standards for working conditions\n\n4 The mission consisted of (i) R. Schoellhammer, Mission Leader; (ii) G. Altay, Senior Counsel; (iii) L. Kulp, Social\n\nSector Specialist; (iv) T. Konishi, Programs Officer; and (v) S. Wendt, Social Development Specialist.\n\n\f2\n\nIII.\n\nTHE SECTOR\n\nA. \n\nMacroeconomic and Social Context\n\n1.\n\nMacroeconomic Context\n\n7.\nSince  the  beginning  of  the  transition  in  1990,  Mongolia  has  made  great  progress  in\ndeveloping a democratic form of government and a market-based economic system. During the\nfirst  four  years  of  adjustment,  the  economy  contracted  sharply  due  to  the  withdrawal  of\nassistance  from  the  former  Soviet  Union,  equivalent  to  about  30  percent  of  gross  domestic\nproduct (GDP), and the break up of the trading system with the member countries of the Council\nfor  Mutual  Economic  Assistance.  The  collapse  of  the  state  budget  led  to  drastic  cuts  in\nsubsidies  and  welfare  programs.  Furthermore,  economic  restructuring  and  the  privatization\nprocess led to a severe retrenchment in public sector employment, and to the closure of many\nnonviable  enterprises.  Although  much  of  the  labor  force  shed  was  absorbed  by  the  extensive\nlivestock  sector,  and  by  the  growing  informal  economy,  unemployment  and  poverty  increased\nrapidly.\n\n8.\nFrom 1994 to 1999 the economy recovered, with real GDP growth averaging 3.6 percent\nannually.  The  source  of  growth  was  primarily  a  private-sector-led  recovery  in  agriculture\nfollowing  the  privatization  of  livestock,  manufacturing,  and  services.  In  1996  the  Government\nadopted  an  ambitious  reform  program  to  complete  the  transition  to  a  market  economy,\naccelerate growth, and reduce poverty. Key elements of the program included reducing inflation,\nliberalizing prices, streamlining the public sector, developing the private sector, and establishing\na restructured social security system. As a result, private sector activity increased sharply and\nexports grew as terms of trade improved in 1997. The exchange rate stabilized and inflation fell\nfrom  47  percent  in  1996  to  20  percent  in  1997.  In  1997  Mongolia  joined  the  World  Trade\nOrganization and most import taxes were abolished.\n\n9.\nHowever,  in  1998  the  terms  of  trade  deteriorated  following  the  financial  crises  in  Asia\nand the Russian Federation. Lower tax revenues and undermining bank loan portfolios and thus\ncontributing  to  severe  problems  in  the  banking  system.  Political  uncertainty,  resulting  in  two\nchanges of Government, undermined Mongolia\u2019s capacity to respond to these external changes.\nThe  fiscal  deficit  widened  to  12  percent  of  GDP,  from  9  percent  in  1997,  and  the  togrog\ndepreciated by 11 percent against the United States dollar. Despite external shocks and political\ncrises,  the  economy  continued  to  grow  and  inflation  declined  to  6  percent.  But  the  number  of\nhouseholds  living  below  the  poverty  line  remained  almost  unchanged,  suggesting  less\ninequitable growth. 5\n\n10.\nIn 1999, economic growth was sustained at 3.5 percent and income per capita reached\nan  estimated  $435  equivalent.  Mainly  due  to  the  disruption  of  oil  supplies  from  the  Russian\nFederation  and  increasing  world  market  prices  for  petroleum  products,  inflation  picked  up  and\nreached 10 percent by the end of the year. The exchange rate depreciated by 19 percent thus\ncontributing to a reduction in the trade balance from 15 percent of GDP in 1998 to 9 percent in\n1999. Fiscal performance improved in 1999 as a result of a package of revenue measures, and\nthe external imbalance and the budget deficit were increasingly met by external borrowings at\n\n                  \n\n5 According  to  the  Government\u2019s  income-based  poverty  line,  26  percent  of  the  population  was  living  below  the\npoverty line in 1998. Living standards measurement surveys carried out in 1995 and 1998 estimated that in both\nyears about 36 percent of the population lived below the expenditure based poverty line.\n\n\f3\n\nlong-term concessional rates. By the end of 1999, the external debt had grown to 78 percent of\nGDP, and official development assistance contributed to 30 percent of the budget.\n\n11.\nAccording  to  the  action  plan  of  the  new  Government  that  came  to  power  in  July  2000,\nthe economic policy during the next four years will focus on continuing and deepening economic\nreform  and  accelerating  economic  growth.  This  includes  ensuring  macroeconomic  stability;\nsetting  up  a  sound  banking  system  and  financial  sector;  restoring  domestic  industries;\npromoting exports, in particular livestock and raw materials; and developing infrastructure.\n\n12.\nMajor  achievements  in  macroeconomic  management  during  the  second  half  of  the\n1990s  include  the  control  of  inflation  and  continued  growth;  however,  short  to  medium  term\neconomic  prospects  are  uncertain.  The  dependence  of  the  economy  on  the  export  of  a  few\nprimary  commodities,  such  as  copper,  gold,  and  cashmere,  makes  the  country  vulnerable  to\nexternal shocks and contributes to the weakness of the external account. The extremely harsh\nwinters  of  1999-2000  and  2000-2001  have  resulted  in  the  loss  of  close  to  20  percent  of\nMongolia\u2019s livestock, which may have far reaching implications for growth and poverty reduction\nin  the  coming  years.  Tax  revenue  collection  needs  to  be  improved  to  strengthen  the  fiscal\nposition and direct foreign investment should be encouraged. The banking system continues to\nbe  relatively  weak,  and  the  range  of  available  financial  services  narrow,  thereby  constraining\nprivate sector development and employment growth.\n\n2. \n\nSocial Context\n\n13.\nUnder the command economy before 1990, the social sectors in Mongolia received high\nlevels  of  investment  and  fiscal  support.  Access  to  employment  was  nearly  universally\nguaranteed  and  there  was  no  recognized  unemployment.  Health  and  education  services  were\nwidespread  and  accessible  because  of  the  high  priority  the  Government  placed  on  human\ndevelopment. The social security system was based on a combination of consumer subsidies,\nuniversal  benefits  supported  by  the  central  budget,  and  state  sector  wages.  All  sectors  of\nsociety  were  covered  by  the  pension  system  and  the  state  also  provided  a  comprehensive\nrange of social protection benefits to families, children, and groups designated as \u201cvulnerable.\u201d\nAbout 40 percent of Government expenditures were devoted to social development.6\n\n14.\nFollowing  transition,  the  Government  made  steps  to  change  the  social  welfare  system\nfrom  provision  of  universal  access  to  targeted  interventions.  Expenditures  on  social  security\nremained  relatively  high,  at  16.5  percent  of  total  public  expenditures  in  1998.  Despite  these\nefforts,  the  social  welfare  system,  which  covers  retirement,  disability  and  survivor  pensions,\nwork  injury,  unemployment,  maternity  benefits,  health,  social  insurance  system,  and  the\nNational Poverty Alleviation Program (NPAP) has had limited success in reducing poverty.\n\nThe  1995  and  1998  Living  Standards  and  Measurement  Surveys  showed  incidence  of\n15.\npoverty  stable  at  about  36  percent,  with  about  20  percent  of  the  population  living  in  extreme\npoverty.7 The last official estimate showed that poverty was disproportionately urban, with 57.2\npercent  of  the  poor  residing  in  urban  and  42.8  percent  in  rural  areas.  However  the  weather-\ninduced  shock  of  the  harsh  storms  in  the  winters  of  1999-2000  and  2000-2001  and  the\nintervening drought in the summer of 2000 has had a deleterious impact on the rural population.\n\n                  \n\n6 Mongolia, A Poverty Reduction Strategy for ADB Operations in Mongolia, May 2000.\n7 From the 1998 Living Standards and Measurement Survey. The survey is based on an expenditure-based poverty\n\nline for an intake of 2,100 kilocalories, which is comparable to other developing countries.\n\n\f4\n\nGrowth in income poverty since 1990 has been accompanied by a concomitant decline\n16.\nin the ability to fill basic needs. Malnutrition among children under five and low birth rates have\nraised  concerns  about  food  security.  Previous  achievements  in  education  have  been  eroded.\nEnrollment  in  grades  1  to  8  declined  from  near  universal  levels  at  99  percent  in  1990  to  82\npercent  in  1997.  While  concerted  efforts  by  the  Government  resulted  in  an  increase  in\nenrollment  rates  to  90  percent,  the  decline  in  the  intervening  years  has  produced  a  large\nnumber of children whose capacities in the long term have been impaired by the years of lost\neducation.\n\nThe  official  unemployment  rate  is  6.5  percent8  (39,000  people),  but  actual  levels  are\n17.\nundeniably  higher  and  are  estimated  (after  adjusting  for  persons  employed  outside  the  formal\nsector)  at  17-23  percent  of  the  population.  The  provinces in  particular  have  suffered  from\nmassive layoffs of workers by private firms and the public service. Also, the incidence of young\npeople being unable to find work is increasing, with severe social and economic consequences.\nLoss of employment is the most prevalent trigger of poverty in Mongolia;9 nearly 58 percent of\nthe unemployed are poor.\n\n18.\nThe Government has identified orphans, the physically handicapped, single pensioners,\nfemale-headed  households,  households  with  more  than  four  children,  the  unemployed,  and\nsmall-scale  herders  in  remote  areas  to  be  particularly  vulnerable  to  poverty.  The  groups\nidentified as the poorest and most vulnerable include those who work outside the formal sector\nand hence find themselves ineligible for assistance from the formal social security system.\n\n19.\nHowever, the most important source of social security for the very poor and vulnerable\ngroups  remains  the  informal  safety  nets  through  extended  kinship  networks,  usually  from\nyounger  to  older  members  of  the  family.  This  is  particularly  strong  in  rural  areas,  but  has\nincreased  in  urban  areas  as  a  result  of  the  dramatic  rural-to-urban  migration  during  the\ntransition.  Growing  inequality  has  modified  the  nature  of  kinship  networks,  often  turning  them\nmore into patron-client relations, as poorer relatives offer their labor to wealthier kin in exchange\nfor food and other services.\n\n20.\nDuring  the  transition,  the  economic  and  social  independence  of  women  has  been\nseverely  undermined.  More  women  than  men  were  released  when  state  factories  closed.\nKindergartens  have  become  costly  or  have  closed,  maternity  homes  have  closed,\nunemployment benefits have been limited in duration and are inadequate. Reduction in health\nand/or social services results in women having to spend more time caring for the young, sick,\nand  elderly.  In  practice  women  tend  to  have  less  job  security  than  men  and  less  access  to\ninformation  and  credit.  In  1998  in  Ulaanbaatar,  the  proportion  of  poor  female-headed\nhouseholds  (44  percent)  was  more  than  twice  the  proportion  of  male-headed  households  (21\npercent).\n\n21. Women account for 52.2 percent of the unemployed.10 Women were the first to be laid\noff during restructuring of the processing, service, and trade industries, industries where women\nwere  predominantly  employed.  After  the  disintegration  of  Government-owned  farms  and\n\n                  \n\n8 The  official  definition  recognizes  only  people  who  have  registered  with  the  labor  registry  as  unemployed.  This\nexcludes first time-labor market entrants ineligible for labor registry services and those who perceive no value in\nregistering. Hidden unemployment is estimated at 12 percent (footnote 6).\n\n9 Participatory Living Standards Assessment, Draft, 2000\n10 The National Convention on Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) Watch Network Center, 2001\n\n\f5\n\nprivatization of livestock and machinery, more than 20,000 trained women lost their jobs.11 Only\n40 percent of women receive any social benefits as compared to 60 percent of men.\n\n22.\nA survey conducted by the National Center for Rehabilitation for the Disabled in March\n2001 showed that Mongolia had 115,000 people with disabilities (PWD). Of an estimated 39,700\nPWD capable of working, only 5,200 (13.1 percent) were actually employed. The unemployment\nrate  of  PWD  is  therefore,  extremely  high  at  87  percent.  Due  to  the  massive  deterioration  of\nsocial  welfare  and  social  insurance  services  for  PWD  since  1991,  50  percent  of  PWD  live  in\npoverty,  60  percent  of  them  women.  Although  legislation  to  protect  and  support  PWD  is  fairly\nwell  developed,  implementation  is  inadequate  due  to  severe  budgetary  constraints.  In  the  first\nthree  quarters  of  2000,  20,085  PWD  received  disability  pensions  from  the  Ministry  of  Social\nWelfare  and  Labor  (MSWL).  However,  the  assistance  to  which  they  are  entitled  is  inadequate\nand forces them to rely on relatives and/or charity for support.\n\nB. \n\nThe Social Security Sector\n\n1.\n\nOverview\n\n23.\nDespite  acute  budgetary  constraints,  the  Government  is  working  to  maintain  the\nachievements  of  the  socialist  period  while  restructuring  the  overall  social  sector  to  meet  tight\nfiscal constraints and the new concept of the state\u2019s role. Prior to the transition, social services\nwere  fully  funded  by  the  state  through  its  central  ministries  with  semistate  and  semiparty\norganizations12  responsible  for  the  delivery  of  services.  However,  since  1990,  the  old  system\nhas collapsed as semistate organizations disappeared. In response, the Government created a\nnew  social  security  system  comprising  three  key  elements  (i)  social  welfare  services  and\nassistance benefits, (ii) employment services, and (iii) social insurance.\n\nExtensive \n\nlegislation  governs \n\n24.\nthe  social  security  sector,  although  effective\nimplementation  has  been  constrained  by  acute  resource  constraints.  MSWL  has  the  central\npolicy role for the social security sector and is responsible for ensuring the welfare of vulnerable\ngroups  such  as  the  children,  elderly,  poor,  and  disabled.  MSWL  has  six  specialized  agencies\nresponsible  for  the  implementation  and  regulation  of  social  insurance,  social  assistance,  and\nemployment and labor markets. An organization chart for MSWL and its agencies is provided in\nAppendix 2.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Welfare Services\n\n25.\n\nA number of laws define social welfare service provision in Mongolia.\n\n(i) \n\nThe Social Welfare Law (November 1998) regulates provision of social welfare to\nvulnerable  groups  including  the  disabled,  very  poor,  poor,  elderly,  orphans,\nparents with many children, and single elderly or disabled persons unable to live\nindependently.\n\n(ii) \n\nThe Elderly Persons Social Welfare Law (November 1998) defines requirements\nfor the elderly to be eligible for social welfare services and discounts.\n\n                  \n\n11 Situational Analysis of Women in Mongolia, 2000, Draft. United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM).\n12 State-funded  autonomous  entities:  included  the  Women\u2019s  Federation,  National  Children\u2019s  Committee,  Veterans\u2019\nAssociation,  Youth  Federation  and  Red  Cross,  which  maintained  branches  nationwide  at  provincial  and  district\nlevel guaranteeing almost universal coverage.\n\n\f6\n\n(iii) \n\nThe  Disabled  Persons  Social  Welfare  Law  (November  1998)  defines  eligibility\nrequirements for the disabled for social welfare services and discounts.\n\nThe  State  Social  Welfare  Agency  (SSWA),  established  in  April  1997,  is  the  lead\n26.\norganization  for  the  delivery  of  social  welfare  services  and  social  assistance  benefits.  SSWA\ndelivered such assistance to over 228,000 people in 2000. The assistance comprises:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nin-kind services including residential facilities for the elderly and disabled as well\nas services for the poor and homeless such as feeding and bathing;\n\ndiscounts  to  the  elderly,  disabled,  and  other  groups  to  reduce  the  costs  of\nhousing, health care, wheelchairs, and hearing aids; and\n\n(iii)  monetary  benefits  from  the  Social  Assistance  Fund  (SAF),  including  short-term\nbenefits  for  pregnancy  and  delivery,  child  care  and  infant  nursing,  support  for\nadopting orphans as well as for families with large numbers of children, and long-\nterm pensions for those not eligible for pensions from the social insurance funds\n(due to insufficient contributions having been made). Many benefits are means-\ntested, based on a living-standard minimum that in 2000 was $12-$16 equivalent\ndepending on the region.\n\n27.\nSSWA  has  a  national  vertically  structured  delivery  mechanism  comprising  the  central\nSSWA  office  plus  social  welfare  and  service  centers  in  nine  districts  of  Ulaanbaatar  and  21\nprovinces,  and  social  welfare  inspectors  in  341  districts.13  As  in  many  transition  countries,  the\nprovision  of  in-kind  social  welfare  services  is  dependent  on  the  institutionalization  of\nbeneficiaries. These include residential facilities under SSWA such as (i) 11 nursing homes for\nelderly and disabled persons (about 500 residents), and (ii) sanitoria for short-term (2-3 weeks)\nmedical care for the elderly. Children use sanitoria facilities in the summer. The National Centre\nfor Rehabilitation of the Disabled under the MSWL is concerned with rehabilitation and training\nof  people  with  disabilities.  In  addition  to  the  services  offered  by  SSWA,  the  Ministry  of\nEducation, Culture and Science (MECS) is responsible for residential and day care services for\ndisabled and orphaned children. Approximately 800 children reside in MECS homes. In addition,\na number of national and international nongovernment organizations (NGOs), have established\nhomes for children in especially difficult circumstances.\n\nGiven the high costs14 and debatable benefits of institutionalization, the Government is\nincreased  promotion  of  community-based  approaches15  and  away \nfrom\n\n28.\nmoving \ninstitutionalization. Key features of community-based approaches are as follows:\n\nto \n\n(i) \n\nEmphasis  on  preventive  rather  than  reactive  measures.  By  identifying  potential\nsocial problems in advance, mitigating measures can be taken earlier and will be\nmore  effective.  For  this,  a  system  of  social  workers  with  a  broad  mandate  will\n\n                  \n\nand poverty issues.\n\n13 The district government officer in charge of social policy is responsible for social welfare inspection, employment\n\n14 For  example,  a  total  of  about  $250,000  equivalent  is  spent  annually  on  the  500  residents  of  11  state  nursing\n\nhomes, amounting to $500 per resident, a figure higher than Mongolia\u2019s annual GDP/capita.\n\n15 One key example is with street children. Although some donors have expressed interest in establishing homes for\nstreet  children,  the  Government  is  concerned  that  this  could  provide  an  incentive  for  children  in  difficult\ncircumstances to leave home. As such, the preferred policy is to place children in need with foster families.\n\n\f7\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nneed  to  be  established  to  work  at  the  community  and  family  levels.  Mongolia\ndoes not currently have such a system.\n\nUse  of  community  resources  to  supplement  state  resources.  With  acute\nbudgetary  constraints,  mobilizing  additional  community  resources  can  have  a\nsubstantial impact on increasing coverage of services. This can include involving\ncommunity  service  organizations  in  delivering  services  to  vulnerable  groups  or\nraising  funds  at  the  community  level  to  meet  essential  needs.  Mongolia  has  a\nwealth  of  suitable  community-based  organizations  throughout  the  country\nincluding  district-based  offices  of  national  NGOs  such  as  the  Veterans\u2019\nAssociation, National Children\u2019s Committee, and Youth Federation.\n\nImproved quality of life for beneficiaries of social welfare services. By delivering\nservices in a decentralized manner, beneficiaries are able to stay within their own\ncommunities.\n\nImproved  efficiency  of  service  delivery.  By  eliminating  the  large  overhead  costs\nof  centralized  institutions,  the  costs  of  service  delivery  will  decline.  If  real\nexpenditure  levels  are  maintained,  greater  numbers  of  vulnerable  groups  could\nreceive  essential  services.  Targeting  of  beneficiaries  can  be  done  more\neffectively at the community level given the greater levels of transparency.16\n\n29.\nSince  1990,  the  number  of  NGOs  has  increased  significantly  in  the  country.  Mongolia\ncurrently has more than 400 registered domestic and international NGOs. Although not all are\neffective, most are filling gaps in social service delivery especially to vulnerable groups. Many\nGovernment  and  international  donor  programs  in  the  social  sector  are  contracted  out  to  and\nimplemented  by  NGOs  that  have  proven  highly  effective  in  promoting  and  strengthening  the\ncommunity mobilization aspects of projects and raising public awareness at the local level.\n\n3. \n\nEmployment Services and Worker Safety\n\n30.\nThe  Central  Employment  Regulation  Office  (CERO)  is  the  primary  agency  responsible\nfor providing employment services to the unemployed. These include information and advisory\nservices as well as support for direct job placement (e.g., through public works) or organization\nof  training courses for the  unemployed. CERO has 20 staff in its central office responsible for\n117 staff throughout the country in 29 employment regulation offices (EROs).\n\n31.\nThe EROs are the primary point of contact for the unemployed in their search for jobs.\nHowever,  availability  of  services  is  restricted  to  only  a  small  proportion  of  the  de  facto\nunemployed, due to complex registration requirements. To be formally registered with EROs, a\nworker must have contributed to the unemployment insurance fund for two years prior to being\nunemployed,  or  have  worked  continuously  for  the  preceding  nine  months.  These  criteria\neffectively  exclude  the  young  and  recent  school  graduates  with  no  work  experience,  who\ncomprise  the  majority  of  the  population  looking  for  work,  and  people  working  in  the  informal\nsector.  Consequently  in  2000  only  8,842  people,  23  percent  of  the  formally  unemployed  were\neligible to receive employment services. However, as most unemployment is unrecorded, fewer\nthan 8 percent of the de facto unemployed are likely to be able to avail of employment services.\n\n                  \n\n16 Of the roughly 100 residents in the state nursing home for the elderly in Huvsgul, fewer than 40 percent actually\n\nmeet the eligibility criteria for residency at the home\n\n\f8\n\nTraining  for  employment  is  a  key  element  of  the  Government\u2019s  active  labor  market\n32.\npolicy. The MSWL is responsible for organizing such training and contracting training providers\nfor this purpose. The dominant training institutions for this purpose are the 24 MECS vocational\ntraining  and  production  centers,  which  are  located  around  the  country.  By  design,  the  centers\ncater primarily for formal full-time vocational training courses for pupils in grades 8 to 10 (where\napproximately  10,000  students  are  currently  enrolled).  Nonformal  vocational  training  provided\nby the public and private sectors together with NGOs has expanded rapidly in recent years and\nis  supported  by  the  Centre  for  Nonformal  education  under  MECS.  During  the  4-year  National\nProgram for the Development of Nonformal Education, nearly 30,000 people have participated\nin  short-term  skills  training  aimed  at  promoting  employment  and  entrepreneurship.  On-the-job\ntraining  by  private  sector  employers  is  rare,  partly  due  to  the  lack  of  any  tradition  for\napprenticeships or similar  schemes but primarily because of the lack of resources to organize\nstructured training programs.\n\n33.\nEstablished  in  1996,  the  Labor  and  Social  Welfare  Inspection  Agency  (LSWIA)  is  the\nregulatory  agency  under  MSWL  responsible  for  occupational  safety  and  health.  LSWIA  has  a\nstaff  of  25  in  the  central  office  and  1  to  2  in  each  province.  It  has  a  wide  range  of  functions\nrelated  to  labor  issues,  particularly  with  ensuring  compliance  with  the  Labor  Law,  and  is\nresponsible  for  monitoring  wage  rates,  hours  of  work,  and  industrial  relations;  inspecting\nworking conditions in industrial establishments to ensure they meet safety standards; monitoring\nemployment  injuries  and  occupational  disease  insurance;  and  assessing  loss  of  capacity  for\nPWD  claiming  insurance  benefits  (whether  under  employment  injuries  or  normal  disabilities\ninsurance). LSWIA is also responsible for monitoring the implementation of laws and regulations\ngoverning all social insurance and social welfare payments.\n\n4. \n\nSocial Insurance\n\n34.\n\nA number of laws define social insurance provision in Mongolia, including the\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nLaw on Unemployment Benefits provided by the Fund of Social Insurance (June\n1994), which governs eligibility for payment of unemployment benefits;\n\nLaw on Benefits provided by the Fund of Social Insurance Against Employment\nInjury  and  Occupational  Diseases  (January  2000),  which  governs  matters\nrelating  to  pensions,  benefits,  and  other  payments  for  employment  injuries  and\noccupational diseases; and\n\n(iii) \n\nLaw  on  Social  Insurance  (June  1999),  which  defines  the  branches  of  social\ninsurance and its operations, financing, and services.\n\nThe  lead  Government  agency  responsible  for  social  insurance  is  the  State  Social\n35.\nInsurance  General  Office  (SSIGO),  established  in  1994,  with  nationwide  representation  and  a\nvertically  organized  delivery  system.  SSIGO  has  22  staff  at  the  central  level,  and  791  staff\nworking in 9 districts of Ulaanbaatar, 21 provinces, and in over 300 districts. SSIGO administers\nfive  insurance  funds  including  pensions,  benefits,  health,  employment  injury  and  occupational\ndisease,  and  unemployment.  The  funds  are  supported  by  insurance  fees  and  budgetary\nsubsidies. At present, 92 percent of the employed are covered by compulsory social insurance\nand  22  percent  of  herders  and  the  self-employed  are  covered  on  a  voluntary  basis.  Over  92\npercent  of  the  population  are  covered  by  health  insurance.  Compulsory  contributors  and  their\nemployers  pay  29  percent  of  their  salaries  (10  percent  and  19  percent,  respectively)  to  the\nSocial Insurance Fund (SIF), while voluntary contributors pay only 11.5 percent of salaries.\n\n\f9\n\n36.\nTotal expenditure for social insurance was $40.2 million equivalent in 1999 covering old\nage  pensions,  disability  pensions,  military  retirees\u2019  pensions,  survivors\u2019  pensions,  temporary\nworking disability benefits, funeral benefits, professional disability pensions, work-related injury\nbenefits,  and  unemployment  benefits  and  to  approximately  650,000  beneficiaries.  The  largest\nexpenditure item was old age pensions, which received $15.3 million equivalent from the central\nbudget.  In  2000,  327,702  people  received  financial  disbursements  from  the  SIF;  8,842  people\nreceived  unemployment  benefits;  and  6,131  people  receiving  benefits  and  pensions  for  work-\nrelated injuries and diseases.\n\nC. \n\nConstraints and Issues\n\n1. \n\nSocial Welfare Services\n\n37.\nMongolia currently is attempting to maintain a complex and very extensive social welfare\nnetwork  on  minimal  resources.17  With  few  resources  available  in  the  SAF,  benefits  are\ncompletely  inadequate  to  lift  beneficiaries  out  of  poverty.  In  2000  228,014  SAF  beneficiaries\nreceived  an  average  of  just  $3.82  equivalent  per  month.  In  addition,  well  over  650,000  poor\npeople are unable to avail of even this support under the SAF. This is compounded by the fact\nthat a large number of SAF beneficiaries are not poor, as benefits are provided on a universal\nbasis.  With  little  prospect  of  increased  budgetary  support,  existing  resources  should  be  better\nfocused on the ultra poor and very poor who are not capable of working.\n\n38.\nEffective planning and targeting of scarce resources is, however, difficult given the lack\nof comprehensive data available to policy makers and planners. Although excellent information\non poverty exists at the district level, the processing of such information up to the central level is\nweak, which makes it difficult for planners to respond adequately to shifting patterns of demand\nfor social welfare services. Improved information systems are needed.\n\n39. With  regard  to  in-kind  services  (including  nursing  homes),  Mongolia\u2019s  reliance  on\ncentralized  institutions  for  the  elderly  and  disabled  is  costly,  and  limits  coverage  of  services,\nexcluding  many  in  need.  While  institutionalization  may  be  required  for  a  limited  number  of\npeople,  a  complementary  system  needs  to  be  developed  to  expand  service  coverage.  The\nGovernment  prefers  a  community-based  approach  whereby  services  are  developed  and\nprovided  at  the  community  level.  In  Mongolia  this  can  typically  be  done  at  the  district  level.\nAlthough  such  approaches  have  been  implemented  in  Mongolia  in  a  limited  manner,  they  are\nstill  relatively  new.  They  do,  however,  offer  substantial  scope  for  mobilizing  vitally  needed\nresources at the community level for the provision of social welfare services to the vulnerable in\ntheir own communities.\n\n2. \n\nEmployment Services\n\n40.\nDuring the socialist era, Mongolia had no recorded unemployment although, as in most\ncommand economies, underemployment was rife. During the early years of the transition, many\npeople lost their jobs as industries closed. In 2000, the working age population was 1.3 million,\nwith  a  labor  force  of  870,000,  of  whom  830,000  were  formally  employed.  However,  official\nunemployment figures remain low at just 6.5 percent in 2000 (about 39,000 persons) with urban\nunemployment  especially  high.  This  represents  an  improvement  from  7.5  percent  in  1997.\n\n17 In  2000,  the  SAF  administered  more  than  30  types  of  pensions  and  benefits  with  a  total  expenditure  of  $10.45\n\n                  \n\nmillion equivalent.\n\n\f10\n\nHowever, these figures represent only those unemployed formally registered with EROs. Recent\nMSWL  surveys  estimate  the  real  unemployment  rate  to  be  over  15  percent  with  148,000\nunemployed.\n\nUnemployment  is  serious  for  most  families  due  to  the  high  dependency  ratio  in\n41.\nMongolia.  With  approximately  47  percent  of  the  population  under  20  years  of  age,  Mongolia\nfaces an acute problem of labor absorption. Current cohorts between the ages of 15 and 19 and\n19 and 24 constitute 11 and 10 percent of the labor force, respectively. Every year the country\nneeds  to  absorb  25,000  new  workers  into  the  labor  market,  making  new  job  creation  a  major\nchallenge for the country.\n\nOf \n\nthe  de \n\n42.\nfacto  unemployed,  approximately  75  percent  have  no  professional\nqualification,  making  it  very  difficult  for  them  to  find  employment.  Many  of  the  poor  and\nunemployed  also  lack  basic  literacy  and  numeracy  skills.  Although  the  registered  unemployed\nare  entitled  to  a  small  grant  for  vocational  training,  the  amount  is  considered  too  small  to\npurchase suitable training. Adult education and training programs are also limited in number and\nnormally  confined  to  major  population  centers.  Although  there  is  a  nationwide  network  of\nvocational  training  institutions,  their  courses  are  geared  to  the  vocational  training  needs  of\nyounger  pupils  in  grades  8  to  10  and  to  general  education.  Their  capacity  for  providing\nemployment-related  training  is  limited  by  low  investments  over  recent  years.  As  a  result\ncurricula,  methodology,  materials,  equipment,  facilities  need  overhauling  before  training  that\nbetter  meets  the  requirements  of  labor  markets  can  be  provided.  Although  some  training  is\nprovided  by  the  private  sector,  providers  are  limited  by  lack  of  access  to  suitable  facilities,\nequipment, and materials as well as funds for contracting well-qualified trainers. To encourage\nthe private sector, the Government intends to promote contracting out of training services and to\nsupport  private-public  sector  partnerships  in  employment  promotion  and  entrepreneurship\ndevelopment.\n\nAdvisory  services  also  need  reform,  especially  as  they  are  available  only  to  the  few\n43.\nunemployed  registered  at  EROs.  Advisory  services  must  be  made  available  to  all  the\nunemployed,  and  EROs  need  to  develop  their  activities  to  cover  informal  and  formal\nemployment labor markets. Advisory services must also be expanded to help the unemployed to\ndevelop their own businesses; this can include providing information and counseling on sources\nof finance, legal provisions and obligations, and specific training for this purpose.\n\n44. Worker safety is of increasing concern with increases in informal sector employment and\nfew  resources  available  to  enforce  adherence  to  relevant  safety  legislation.  Although  LSWIA\nexists  for  this  purpose,  its  role  is  hampered  by  institutional  inefficiencies  and  overlaps;  for\nexample,  the  function  most  closely  associated  with  the  employment  injury  responsibilities  of\nLSWIA  (occupational  diseases)  is  also  covered  by  the  Center  for  Occupational  Diseases  of\nSSIGO.  Both  are  responsible  for  administration  of  the  same  piece  of  legislation,  providing\ncompensation  for  victims  of  occupational  diseases  or  employment  injuries/disabilities.  LSWIA\nstaff  need  to  be  better  trained  and  equipped  to  deal  with  issues  of  worker  safety  in  the\nincreasingly diverse environment of Mongolia\u2019s economy. Improved information systems will be\nessential for LSWIA to be able to effectively enforce employment legislation on worker safety.\n\n3.\n\nSocial Insurance\n\nMongolia  retains  a  valuable  social  insurance  system  that  could  be  vital  in  efforts  to\n45.\nreduce poverty and prevent more people from falling below the poverty line. However, chronic\nunder funding means that the disbursements to the 327,702 beneficiaries in 2000 amounted to\n\n\f11\n\njust under $14 equivalent per month. Apart from general budgetary constraints, another reason\nfor the under funding is due to evasion of compulsory social insurance contributions. This has\nbeen  compounded  by  the  increasing  number  of  people  working  informally  and  in  self-\nemployment, areas not covered by social insurance schemes. In addition, the large population\nof nomadic herders is not covered by social insurance.\n\n46.\nContribution  and  participation  problems  are  not  confined  to  these  sectors.  Arrears  of\nstate  employers  currently  exceed  $3.1  million  equivalent,  despite  budgetary  allocations  for\nsocial  insurance  contribution  obligations.  Private  sector  employers  commonly  fail  to  meet\nobligations too, and account for $6.1 million worth of arrears. The ability of SSIGO to increase\ncompliance  is  hampered  by  the  lack  of  information  on  employment  records  and  the  relatively\nlimited powers of social insurance inspectors to enforce compliance. Data available to taxation\nauthorities  are  not  routinely  available  to  SSIGO  and  social  insurance  inspectors  do  not    have\nsufficient investigative authority.\n\n47.\nCoverage  of  social  insurance  schemes  needs  to  be  expanded,  particularly  to  the  poor\nand unemployed. The current unemployment insurance system assists only a small proportion\nof  the  unemployed  in  terms  of  the  provision  of  benefits  and  training.  Currently,  only  about  20\npercent of the registered unemployed, and none of the unemployed in the informal sector, are\nable to avail of unemployment insurance benefits.18 With high levels of noncompliance, people\ninjured at work or afflicted with an occupational disease cannot seek compensation. They may\nalso find it difficult to gain alternative sources of income from social assistance benefits, given\nthe low coverage of this scheme.\n\nOne  of  the  principal  issues  concerns  coverage  of  herders  and  the  self-employed.  The\n48.\nwinter  storms  of  the  last  two  years  have  demonstrated  the  vulnerability  of  these  communities.\nDespite  the  potential  benefits  of  participation  in  social  insurance  schemes,  the  feasibility  of\nexpanding services to these communities must first be carefully examined, especially as many\nherders live in a barter economy and may not have the means with which to make contributions.\n\n4.\n\nInstitutional Issues and Capacity\n\nDelivery and administration of social welfare and employment services and the payment\n49.\nof social welfare benefits and insurance across a sparsely populated country is costly in terms\nof  human  and  financial  resources.  More  appropriate  and  cost  effective  institutional  structures\ncan be developed, especially at the local level. Clarification of the roles and responsibilities of\nthe  various  organizations  within  the  social  security  sector  is  required  to  reduce  overlapping\nresponsibilities and duplication of services.\n\n50.\nCapacities  need  to  be  developed  across  all  organizations  in  the  social  security  sector,\nespecially in the context of movement toward new systems of delivery. An important area that\nneeds  strengthening  is  information  collection,  analysis,  and  dissemination.  Systems  for\ninformation sharing among agencies and clients need to be improved. LSWIA, with limited staff\nand  outreach,  has  to  deal  with  over  30,000  enterprises  with  no  existing  information  network\nbetween  their  offices  and  those  of  the  agency.  Related  to  this  is  the  need  to  build  capacity  to\n\n                  \n\n18 The minimum amount payable for unemployment insurance is equivalent to 75 percent of the minimum wage and\nbenefits  are  payable  for  a  maximum  of  76  days.  The  amount  of  benefits  payable  ranges  from  45  percent  of  the\naverage of wages received in the last three months for a person with less than five years of contributions, to 70\npercent for those who have contributed for 15 years or more\n\n\f12\n\nevaluate  different,  new,  and  often  innovative  interventions  within  the  sector,  to  learn  lessons,\ndevelop best practices, and inform policy makers.\n\n51.\nOrganizations  need  to  develop  the  ability  and  willingness  to  cooperate  more  with  civil\nsociety  organizations  and  with  the  private  sector  in  carrying  out  their  duties.  Equally,\ncoordination  and  linkages  across  ministries  and  agencies  with  the  responsibility  of  different\nministries  needs  to  be  strengthened.  Strengthening  collaboration  and  cooperation  between\nMSWL and MECS in training for employment is essential.\n\nD. \n\nGovernment Expenditure\n\nIn 2000 Mongolia spent $13.4 million equivalent on social security,19 amounting to 14.1\n52.\npercent of GDP. This marks a large increase since 1996 (8.7 percent of GDP), and reflects the\nincreasing number of ultra poor and very poor people in Mongolia. During the transition years,\nbudgets  for  health,  education,  and  social  security  and  welfare  as  a  percentage  of  GDP\ndecreased  markedly.  The  decline  continued  until  1995,  and  not  until  1996  was  overall  social\nsector expenditure increased. Expenditures for social protection from 1991-2000 are shown in\nAppendix 3. While overall social sector expenditures have increased since 1996,  education and\nhealth  expenditures  (in  terms  of  GDP  and  total  government  expenditure)  have  declined  since\n1991. At the same time, social security and welfare expenditures have increased from about 12\npercent of total Government expenditures in 1991 to nearly 18 percent in 2000.\n\nE. \n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategies\n\nThe 2000-2004 Action Plan of the new Government adopted in September 2000 outlines\n53.\nkey  objectives  in  the  main  policy  areas  including  economic,  social,  and  regional  and  rural\ndevelopment  policy.  The  stated  objective  in  the  plan  is  that  it  \u201cshall  improve  the  wealth  and\nincome  distribution  system,  stall  the  decline  in  the  living  standard  of  the  people,  narrow  the\nincome gap among social groups, and eliminate absolute poverty.\u201d Key elements related to the\nsocial security system include\n\n(i) \n\nreducing  the  number  of  poor  households  living  under  the  poverty  line  by  half\nthrough  a  complex  set  of  social  and  economic  measures  to  prevent  living\nstandard decline and by providing jobs to poor citizens of working age, and\n\n(ii) \n\ndeveloping and strengthening a national social security system.\n\n54.\nThe action plan includes other elements within the three areas of social security cover by\nthe  SSSDP.  Within  social  welfare,  the  plan  aims  to  (i)  improve  social  protection  measures  for\npoor and disabled people, and mothers with many children; (ii) increase the number and types\nof  benefits  and  services  rendered  to  senior  veterans;  and  (iii)  create  favorable  conditions  for\nneglected children to live in their own homes and provide them with assistance and services.\n\n55. Within  the  area  of  employment  promotion  and  worker  conditions,  the  plan  aims  to  (i)\nrevise and enforce the labor safety and sanitary standards in accordance with the Labor Law,\n(ii)  provide  unemployment  insurance  for  uninsured  people  and  professional  training  and  labor\nmarket activities, and (iii) develop the content of vocational training and activities of centers for\nvocational training.\n\n19 $6.91 million equivalent from the budget, $1.04 million from the SAF, and $5.44 million from the SIF\n\n                  \n\n\f13\n\n56. Within  social  insurance  the  plan  aims  to  (i)  expand  social  insurance  coverage,\nstrengthen  the  responsibility  for  timely  payment  of  insurance  contributions,  and  improve  self\nfinancing of social insurance contributions; (ii) cover herders and the self-employed and improve\ntheir  social  protection;  and  (iii)  enforce  the  regulation  on  payment  from  the  occupational\ninjuries/diseases  insurance  fund  of  (a)  benefits  to  people  disabled  by  industrial  accidents  or\nprofessional sickness, and (b) expenses for the resulting care and treatment.\n\n57.\nTo  identify  priority  interventions  and  reforms  required  within  the  action  plan,  the\nGovernment  has  developed  the  Good  Governance  for  Human  Security  Program.  The  SSSDP\nwill  contribute  to  achieving  overall  human  security  by  reducing  poverty  and  unemployment,\noptimizing  income  distribution,  and  improving  living  standards.  The  Government  is  also\ndeveloping an interim poverty reduction strategy that will lead the way to the development of a\nfull  poverty  reduction  strategy  program.  The  poverty  reduction  strategy  program  will  help\ncoordinate  all  interventions  aimed  at  reducing  poverty  and  integrate  social  security  sector\ninvestments and policy reforms into a comprehensive package for poverty reduction.\n\nF. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n58.\nThe  SSSDP  has  been  designed  to  be  fully  compatible  with  other  external  support  for\nsocial security development. During preparation, close coordination was maintained with other\nfunding  agencies  including  Gesellschaft  fuer  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ)  of  Germany,\nJapan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  United  Nations  Development  Programme\n(UNDP),  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  United  States  Agency  for  International\nDevelopment (USAID), and the World Bank to ensure optimal coordination and to benefit from\nthe experience of other agencies active in the sector. Although several other interventions are\nongoing in the broad field of social security, the SSSDP will make ADB the lead external agency\nin this field. Other agencies and their activities are described in the following paragraphs.\n\nIn  the  social  welfare  subsector,  support  has  been  focused  on  the  needs  of  vulnerable\n59.\nchildren.  UNICEF,  with  $6.1  million  financing  since  1997,  has  played  the  leading  role  in\nassisting  (i)  street  and  neglected  children,  and  (ii)  community-based  rehabilitation  of  disabled\nchildren, in addition to its activities in health and education. UNICEF also supports community-\nbased  interventions  to  help  vulnerable  groups.  GTZ  has  provided  $140,000  equivalent  since\n1997  to  assist  street  children  and  children  in  especially  difficult  circumstances.  International\nNGOs,  including  Save  the  Children  Fund,  United  Kingdom,  and  World  Vision  are  also\nimplementing major activities focusing on vulnerable children.\n\n60.\nIn  employment  promotion,  the  European  Union  (EU)  has  taken  the  lead  role  in\nstrengthening  employment  services  through  two  grant-financed  projects  totaling  $2.63  million\nequivalent. The EU observatory program has supported sustainable labor market analysis. GTZ\nis leading support to develop the formal vocational training system, with $1.12 million equivalent\nfinancing  between  2000  and  2003.  Under  its  $10  million  Gobi  Regional  Economic  Initiative,\nUSAID  is  supporting  skills  training  and  entrepreneurship  development  for  the  provinces  in  the\nregion  of  the  Gobi  Desert.  In  addition,  UNDP,  the  Swedish  International  Development  Agency\nand  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization  and  Danish  International\nDevelopment  Agency  are  providing  support  to  nonformal  training  for  employment.  The\nemployment  promotion  activities  envisaged  within  the  SSSDP  will  also  be  linked  with  existing\nexternally-supported microfinance schemes.20\n\n20 These include the UNDP-supported micro-start program and other schemes supported by EU, GTZ, and USAID.\n\n                  \n\n\f14\n\nADB  has  provided  two  advisory  TAs  to  support  reform  in  social  insurance.  Additional\n61.\nassistance  for  reform  of  pension  financing  is  being  provided  through  the  ADB-supported\nFinancial  Sector  Program.21  From  1997  to  2000,  USAID  provided  $2  million  in  TA  to  promote\npension  reform,  with  focus  on  capacity  building  of  SSIGO.  The  SSSDP  has  been  designed  to\ncomplement and continue activities supported under these programs.\n\n62.\nThe development of a social security master plan within the SSSDP with the support of\ninterested  funders  will  facilitate  donor  coordination  and  resource  mobilization  for  key\ninterventions  in  this  area  not  covered  by  the  current  program.  Major  external  agencies  and\nprojects in support of the social security sector are listed in Appendix 4.\n\nG. \n\nADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n\n1. \n\nADB\u2019s Country Strategy\n\nThe  country  operational  strategy  (COS)  for  Mongolia22  states  that  the  objectives  of\n63.\ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction  can  best  be  achieved  by  focusing  on  five  core  sectors,  one  of\nwhich  is  the  social  sector  (education,  health,  and  social  protection).  The  COS  is  foremost  a\npoverty reduction strategy. This has been confirmed through the PPA signed by ADB and the\nGovernment in March 2000. The PPA aims to increase the productivity of the economy through\nimproved governance, and of the people through viable employment generation. The SSSDP is\nfully compatible with the principal elements of the PPA, which aims, inter alia, to provide for the\nspecific needs of different income groups as follows:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nfor  people  above  the  poverty  line  but  likely  to  become  poor:  skills  development\nand labor advisory programs, and small enterprise development;\n\nfor  the  poor  below  but  close  to  the  poverty  line:  skills  development  and  labor\nadvisory  programs,  small  enterprise  development,  sustaining  access  to  social\nservices, and developing social infrastructure;\n\nfor  the  very  poor:  training  and  labor  advisory  programs,  sustaining  access  to\nsocial services, and developing social infrastructure; and\n\nfor  the  ultra  poor:  targeted  assistance  for  the  really  vulnerable  including  PWD,\naged, orphans, and multi children households.\n\n64.\nADB\u2019s strategy to reduce poverty is to (i) generate viable and widespread employment,\nparticularly  in  the  urban  and  provincial  centers  where  the  poor  and  unemployed  are\nconcentrated;  (ii) involve the private sector to deliver the needed employment opportunities; (iii)\nput  in  place  a  strong  social  security  system  for  the  very  poor  and  vulnerable  who  might  be\nbeyond the reach of the self-help opportunities; and (iv) maintain active social service delivery to\nthe  poor  and  vulnerable,  particularly  in  the  rural  areas,  to  prevent  levels  of  deprivation  from\nincreasing.\n\n65.\nPoverty  in  Mongolia  is  not  a  transitory  problem;  rather  it  is  a  structural  one.  The\nincreasing depth of poverty indicates that the current level of development and economic growth\n\n                  \n\n21 Loan  1743-MON: Second Financial Sector Program,  for  $15  million,  approved  on  22  June  2000  (in  cooperation\n\nwith the World Bank\u2019s $32 million Financial Sector Adjustment Credit).\n\n22 Mongolia Country Operational Strategy, ADB, February 2000.\n\n\f15\n\nis  inadequate  to  generate  sufficient  opportunities  for  viable  employment  and  income,  and  the\npoor  are  sinking  deeper  into  poverty  through  asset  depletion  and  a  breakdown  in  vital  kinship\nnetworks. The SSSDP is well in line with the COS as it provides for a one-time intervention to\nestablish a strong security system for the very poor and most vulnerable who might be beyond\nthe reach of self-help opportunities. However, the SSSDP recognizes that social insurance and\nwelfare are not sufficient to reduce structural poverty in a sustainable way and hence addresses\npro-poor growth through promoting employment and income generation activities.23\n\n2. \n\nADB Experience\n\n66.\nSince  Mongolia  joined  ADB  in  1990,  ADB\u2019s  activities  in  the  social  security  sector  have\nincluded  two  advisory  TAs  to  support  social  insurance  development,24  one  advisory  TA  to\nsupport the NPAP,25 and one preparatory TA to support the development of the SSSDP.26\n\n67.\nExperience  from  the  social  insurance  TAs  revealed  the  principal  constraints  facing  this\nsubsector,  including  (i)  low  compliance  with  payments  by  individual  and  employers  from  both\npublic and private sectors; (ii) low coverage levels, with nomadic herders and the self-employed\nnot  covered;  and  (iii)  a  need  to  enhance  the  capacity  of  social  insurance  management  with\nfocus on SSIGO. Work under the TAs led to provision being made under the Second Financial\nSector Reform Program27 for pensions development and under the SSSDP for  unemployment\nand occupational injuries and diseases.\n\n68.\nUnder the support for the NPAP, ADB gained experience working in poverty reduction,\nincluding  areas  such  as  employment  generation  and  social  welfare.  The  specific  areas  of\nactivity  were  to  determine  appropriate  means  of  measuring  poverty,  and  to  update  Mongolian\nagencies  on  cost-effective  methodologies  and  techniques  needed  to  implement  the  national\npoverty reduction activities. These activities highlighted the need in the social security sector to\nbetter  identify  and  target  the  poor,  including  development  of  means-testing  and  management\ninformation systems, both of which are being addressed under the SSSDP. Activities related to\nthe NPAP also revealed the need to increase cost-effectiveness of social security programs by\nverifying that public spending is allocated for actual provision of social services and the need to\nensure  that  institutional  structures  are  in  place  for  the  delivery  of  social  security  programs.\nFindings  indicate  that,  overall,  local  structures  (particularly  those  involving  local  NGOs  with\nstrong  community  participation)  have  been  successful  in  achieving  beneficiary  impact,\naddressing local needs, and sustainability. These lessons have all been taken into consideration\nin the design of the SSSDP.\n\nThe preparatory TA28 built on the findings of the previous TA interventions in designing\n69.\nthe  SSSDP.  In  its  preparation,  support  was  provided  for  amending  legislation  in  key  areas,\nincluding  reform  of  the  Social  Welfare  Law  to  allow  greater  focus  on  community-based\napproaches  for  social  welfare  service  deals  as  well  as  the  drafting  of  a  new  employment  law.\n\n                  \n\n23) pp. 15-17 and Appendix 1.\n\n23 For a detailed poverty analysis refer to the poverty impact assessment (Appendix 5) and the ADB COS (footnote\n\n24 TA  2252-MON:  Strengthening Social Insurance,  for  $84,000,  approved  on  20  December  1994;  TA  2371-MON:\n\nAdministrative Reform of Social Insurance, for $900,000, approved on 28 July 1995.\n\n25 TA  2683-MON:  Strengthening  the  National  Poverty  Alleviation  Program,  for  $422,000,  approved  on  7  November\n\n1996.\n\n26 TA 2978-MON: Social Safety Net, for $985,000, approved on 31 December 1997.\n27 Loan 1743-MON: Second Financial Sector Reform Program, for $15 million, approved on 22 June 2000.\n28 Footnote 2.\n\n\f16\n\nEmphasis  was  also  placed  on  making  the  SSSDP  fully  compatible  with  interventions  of  other\nagencies working on poverty reduction activities in Mongolia.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n70.\nFrom  1921  to  1990,  Mongolia  achieved  substantial  progress  in  human  development.\nThese  gains  are,  however,  being  rapidly  eroded,  largely  through  declines  in  quality  and\ncoverage of social security and other social services, and poverty levels have risen sharply. The\nGovernment  has  responded  though  interventions  such  as  the  NPAP  as  well  as  commencing\nmajor  reforms  in  the  social  sector.  Civil  society  has  responded  well  to  the  challenges  as\nwitnessed  by  the  rapid  development  of  NGOs  providing  informal  social  security  services.  The\nnew Government has also adopted an action plan that sets reducing unemployment as the main\npillar of its bid to reduce poverty, while providing social welfare services to the most vulnerable\nand social insurance services to prevent people from falling into poverty.\n\n71.\nHowever, much of the formal social security system has shown itself to be increasingly\nineffective  in  Mongolia\u2019s  move  to  a  market-oriented  economy.  In  particular,  its  emphasis  on\ncash  transfers  to  a  large  number  of  beneficiaries  has  proven  unsustainable  under  the  severe\nbudgetary  constraints  faced  by  the  Government.  In  addition,  employment  promotion  services\nand unemployment insurance systems reach only a small proportion of the de facto unemployed\nand even when they do so, are largely ineffective. Reform is, therefore, necessary.\n\nTop priorities must be the maintenance and improvement of social welfare services for\n72.\nthe most vulnerable groups of society to help them out of poverty and to ensure all their basic\nneeds are met. These groups are most affected by poverty. At the same time, the system needs\nto support the unemployed and underemployed to find productive, viable, and sustainable jobs.\n\n73.\nExternal  support  is  required  for  restructuring  the  social  security  system  given  the\nGovernment\u2019s  financial  and  technical  capacity  constraints,  including  lack  of  experience  in\nmarket-based  systems.  This  process  will  require  investments  at  both  policy  and  investment\nlevels  for  social  welfare,  employment  promotion,  social  insurance,  and  better  sector  planning.\nLoans will need to be directed at establishing effective and sustainable social security systems\nin line with the development requirements of modern Mongolia.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n74.\nThe objective of the SSSDP is to reduce poverty among the most vulnerable groups of\nsociety  through  strengthening  the  social  security  system.  The  SSSDP  will  include  direct  and\nindirect poverty interventions, and poor people are expected to comprise at least 72 percent of\nthe  beneficiaries.  The  primary  strategic  development  objective  is  poverty  reduction  and  the\nsecondary objective is human development. The SSSDP is fully in line with the COS, the PPA,\nand the Government\u2019s Action Plan.\n\n75.\nImproving  the  sustainability  of  the  social  security  system  is  a  principal  immediate\nobjective  of  the  SSSDP.  To  ensure  this,  the  SSSDP  will  seek  to  maintain  real  levels  of  public\nspending on social security and to mobilize additional resources, particularly at the community\nlevel. Simultaneously, the SSSDP will improve the effectiveness of the social security system for\npoverty  reduction  by  better  targeting  of  the  poor  while  increasing  the  efficiency  of  services  by\n\n\f17\n\nshifting  focus  more  to  preventative  approaches  at  the  community  and  family  levels  and  away\nfrom reactive, centralized approaches.\n76.\nThe  SSSDP  comprises  a  policy  program  with  four  policy  areas  and  the  investment\nproject  with  four  components.  Associated  with  the  SSSDP  will  be  TA  for  Strengthening  Policy\nfor Social Security Reform.\n\nC.\n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\nThe  policy  reform  agenda  is  designed  to  build  on  issues  identified  and  addressed  in\n77.\nprevious  TA  interventions  in  the  social  security  sector  in  Mongolia  as  well  as  from  the\nexperience of other agencies in this field. The policy loan will support essential reforms in social\nwelfare,  social  insurance,  and  employment  services  for  poverty  reduction  and  to  enhance  the\nsocial  and  economic  security  of  vulnerable  groups.  It  will  also  define  a  long-term  vision  and\nstrategic framework for the sector, through a social security master plan.\n\n78.\nThe  program  of  policy  reforms  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  action  plan  adopted  in\nSeptember 2000, and will support several of the Government\u2019s planned initiatives. The program\nis also closely linked to the SSSDP\u2019s investment component. The development policy letter is in\nAppendix 6 and the policy matrix setting out the policy framework is in Appendix 7. The policy\nprogram will support the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  program  will  help  (a)  rationalize  the  system  of  social  assistance  to  focus\nresources on the poorest by modifying eligibility criteria to include only the poor\nand  those  at  risk  of  poverty;  and  (b)  develop  community-based  social  welfare\nservice  delivery  mechanisms  to  mobilize  additional  resources  for  social  security\nand  improve  access  to,  choice  of,  and  quality  of  such  services.  Social  work\nservices will also be reorganized to reflect the need for more flexible community-\nbased  systems,  which  can  work  more  on  poverty  prevention  than  on  current\npractices, that focus on inspection and reporting.\n\nThe  program  will  help  develop  pro-poor  labor  market  policies,  including\nexpanding  the  eligibility  for  employment  services  (education  and  training,\ninformation  and  counseling  services,  public  works  programs)  to  the  uninsured\nunemployed  and  to  the  poor.  New  education  and  training  programs  will  be\ndeveloped  and  provided  in  collaboration  with  the  private  sector.  New  programs\nwill  also  be  delivered  at  district  level29  in  collaboration  with  district-level\nsecondary schools.\n\nThe program will strengthen social insurance to increase the resources available\nfor insurance for unemployment and injuries and diseases. Related policy action\nincludes  strengthened  cooperation  between  SSIGO  and  the  State  Taxation\nGeneral  Office  (STGO),  particularly  on  information  sharing.  State  budgetary\norganizations will be required to clear social contributions\u2019 arrears amounting to\nmore  than  $3.1  million  and  the  enforcement  powers  of  the  social  insurance\ninspectors  will  be  increased.  A  public  education  campaign  will  be  launched  to\nencourage  eligible  people  to  make  social  insurance  contributions.  As  self-\nemployed  people  including  herders  are  not  covered  by  the  existing  system,\noptions for including them will also be formulated.\n\n29 The vast majority of training programs are available only in cities or at the provincial level and are out of reach of\n\n                  \n\nmost unemployed people.\n\n\f18\n\n(iv) \n\nThe  program  will  develop  a  medium-  and  long-term  policy  and  planning\nframework  for  the  social  security  sector.30  Related  policy  actions  include\nformulation  and  approval  of  a  comprehensive  20  year  sector  master  plan  for\nsocial security. The strategy will be realized through a series of rolling programs,\neach  of  three  years\u2019  duration.  The  Government  will  request  all  external  funding\nagencies  to  provide  support  within  the  framework  of  this  program.  The  master\nplan  will  also  address  the  issue  of  program  budgeting  in  the  social  security\nsector.\n\n79.\nDuring  the  National  Consultative  Workshop  hosted  by  MSWL  in  Ulaanbaatar  in  April\n2001, policy measures under the SSSDP were discussed with the principal stakeholders in the\nsocial security sector (including parliamentarians, central and local government officials, social\nsecurity  specialists,  and  representatives  of  NGOs  and  funding  agencies).  Valuable  feedback\nwas  provided  and  incorporated  into  the  SSSDP  design  and  full  endorsement  gained  for  the\nSSSDP.\n\nD.  Capacity Building\n\n80.\nThe  SSSDP\u2019s  investment  project  will  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  oversee,\ncoordinate, and manage social security services. It will also boost the role of the private sector,\ncivil society organizations, and communities in service development and provision. To achieve\nthis,  the  SSSDP  will  support  a  comprehensive  program  of  staff  development  to  ensure  that\nMongolia gains access to the highest levels of knowledge and experience of other countries in\nsocial  security  issues.  In  addition,  staff  will  be  supported  in  their  work  through  access  to\npertinent \ninformation  and\ncommunications technologies (ICT). To combat the high turnover in Government staff, plans will\nbe developed to ensure optimum use of limited staff resources. The functions of MSWL and its\nspecialized agencies will be analyzed to identify means of improving service delivery.\n\nreference  materials  and  systems, \n\nincluding \n\nfacilities \n\nfor \n\n81.\nThe SSSDP will also support the establishment and operation of benefit monitoring and\nevaluation systems to facilitate higher efficiency and effectiveness of social security services on\na sustained basis.\n\nE.  The Investment Project\n\nThe  investment  project  will  address  each  of  the  three  main  elements  of  the  social\n82.\nsecurity  sector  in  Mongolia:  social  welfare,  employment  services,  and  social  insurance  in  line\nwith  the  goals  of  the  PPA  to  promote  training  and  advisory  programs  and  maintain  social\nassistance and social services for the ultra poor, very poor, and those near the poverty line. It\nwill be implemented nationwide.\n\n1.\n\nComponent 1: Social Welfare\n\na. \n\nDevelopment and Upgrading of Social Welfare Service Facilities\n\n83.\nSocial  welfare  services  for  members  of  ultra-poor  vulnerable  groups  will  be  improved\nunder  the  project.  Specifically,  support  will  be  provided  to  improve  the  national  system  of\n\n30 In  the  area  of  social  insurance,  the  framework  will  cover  only  insurance  for  unemployment  and  occupational\n\n                  \n\ndiseases and injuries.\n\n\f19\n\nnursing  homes  for  the  elderly  and  disabled.  The  project  will  support  a  shift  away  from  large,\ncentralized  institutions  to  smaller,  more  sustainable  community-based  facilities,  which  can\nsupport integration of vulnerable groups into the community. The project will support renovation\nof  five  community-based  facilities;31  construction  of  new  cost-efficient  facilities;32  provision  of\nfurniture, equipment, materials, staff training, and communications; and assistance for planning\nand management. Project consultants will help MSWL (i) draw up plans for the gradual phasing\nout  of  the  centralized  facilities  at  Batsumber  and  Huvsgul,  and  (ii)  propose  modifications  to\nregulations on nursing homes to permit a more flexible approach to service delivery. The project\nwill  improve  rehabilitation  services  and  supplies  of  artificial  limbs  and  other  aids  for  PWD  by\nupgrading  the  National  Centre  for  Rehabilitation  of  the  Disabled,  and  identify  options  for  the\nprivate  sector  to  supply  necessary  items  (domestic  as  well  as  imported  products).  Support  for\nthe National Centre for Rehabilitation of the Disabled will include furniture, equipment, materials,\nstaff training, planning,  management, and marketing, and establishment of links with overseas\nentities. The improvement of nursing homes will be undertaken in close coordination within the\noverall  strategy  to  develop  more  community-based  approaches  to  social  welfare  delivery.  The\nProject will also establish three pilot social security centers at provincial level. The centers will\noffer  the  full  range  of  social  security  services  in  one  facility.  The  number  of  expected\nbeneficiaries for the various activities under this component is provided in Appendix 1.\n\n      b.\n\nDevelopment of Community-Based Social Welfare Services\n\n84.\nThe  project  will  support  the  development  of  community-based  social  welfare  services\naimed  at  the  ultra-poor  and  very  poor  (including  the  elderly,  children,  PWD  and  single-parent\nfamilies)  through  pilot-testing  of  innovative  small-scale  projects  designed  and  implemented  at\nthe  community  level  by  government  agencies,  NGOs,  individuals,  or  groups.  Maximum\nemphasis will be placed on contracting services to private sector providers, in line with reforms\nundertaken under the policy program. Eligible activities are aimed at the poorest and will include\nup to 4,000 beneficiaries during the project. Activities will include development and provision of\nday-care  and  preschool  services,  recreational  and  educational  services,  catering  services,\ncounseling and advisory services, accommodation-related services, and  skills training. Training\nand public education programs will also be provided to support the new activities, for which both\nprivate  and  public  entities  will  be  eligible.  The  small-scale  subcomponents  will  be  financed\nthrough a community social welfare innovation facility  to be established under the project. State\nagencies, NGOs, community organizations, groups, and individuals will be eligible to apply for\ngrants  from  the  facilities  up  to  a  ceiling  of  $10,000  equivalent  for  community-based  projects.\nFurther  details  of  the  facility  are  set  out  in  Appendix  8.  Lessons  from  the  community  social\nwelfare innovation facility subcomponents will support the development of a national strategy for\ncommunity-based  social  welfare  service  delivery  and  refinement  of  procedures  for  contracting\nout services to the private sector and identifying of the most successful practices.\n\n            c.\n\nStrengthening Social Welfare Management\n\n85.\nThe  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  social  welfare  service  and  benefit  delivery  will  be\nimproved  by  the  project.  Support  will  be  provided  to  help  SSWA  develop  management\ninformation systems, including provincial and district-level branches, to improve management of\nsocial welfare resources, and monitoring and evaluation of social welfare services and benefits.\n\n                  \n\n31 Nine small-scale nursing homes are run by provincial administrations in addition to two large centralized institutions\nat  Batsumber  and  Huvsgul.  The  five  homes  to  be  renovated  are  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  Regional\nDevelopment Programme.\n\n32 Although plans have not yet been finalized, the National Consultative Workshop proposed that in some cases tent\n\ncommunities could be established.\n\n\f20\n\nInputs will include modern ICT (which will be integrated with social insurance and employment\nservices\u2019 systems), equipment, furniture, materials, and support for planning and management.\nA  training  needs  analysis  will  be  conducted  among  officials  from  MSWL  and  SSWA  and\npersonnel from private sector agencies, Minor renovations will also be made to SSWA facilities\nat provincial level and in Ulaanbaatar to allow for increased efficiency of operations.\n\nComponent 2: Employment Promotion and Improvement of Working\n\n2.\n           Conditions\n\n           a.\n\nSkills Training for the Unemployed and the Poor\n\n86.\nFollowing  a  labor  market  analysis  and  survey  of  the  training  needs  of  the  poor,  the\nproject  will  support  the  availability  of  demand-driven  education  and  training  courses  for  the\nunemployed  and  poor  people  who  wish  to  upgrade  or  obtain  skills  and  knowledge.  Principal\ntarget groups will include the very poor, the poor below but close to the poverty line, and people\nabove  the  poverty  line  but  likely  to  become  poor.  Up  to  25  private  and  public  training\ninstitutions33 will be selected as employment training centers (ETCs) under the subcomponent,\nto  provide  capacity  for  training  up  to  5,000  participants  per  year.  In  addition,  a  network  of  6\nregional resource centers will be established on the base of existing training institutions; these\ncenters will provide methodological support for ETCs and serve as training centers for staff from\nthe  ETCs.  Up  to  40  interdistrict  schools  (schools  that  serve  multiple  districts)  will  also  be\nselected as employment education centers and will provide basic skills and vocational education\n(including  literacy  and  numeracy  training)  for  up  to  4,000  unemployed  and  poor  people.  The\nsubcomponent  will  support  selected  training  providers  with  civil  works,  furniture,  management\nsupport,  curriculum  and  syllabus  development,  learning  materials,  and  teachers\u2019  guides,\nprograms for training of trainers, training, and administrative equipment. The subcomponent will\nalso  develop  assessment  systems  and  methodologies  to  enable  trainees  to  receive  formal\ncertification  on  successful  completion  of  training  courses.  To  support  the  sustainable\ndevelopment of the skills training programs, the subcomponent will support the establishment of\na  national  curriculum  and  methodological  center  for  vocational  and  skills  training  within  an\nexisting  educational  institution.  The  subcomponent  is  directly  linked  to  policy  reform  regarding\nestablishment of a strategy for national training for employment.\n\nb. \n\nEntrepreneurship Development for the Unemployed and Poor\n\n87.\nThe subcomponent will support potential and existing entrepreneurs (who are classified\nas  poor,  unemployed,  or  likely  to  become  poor)  to  develop  and  manage  small  enterprises.\nExisting advisory services will be reviewed and upgraded. ETCs will offer training in enterprise\ndevelopment to cover aspects such as (i) procedures for establishing a business, (ii) preparation\nof a business plan, (iii) availing of credit, (iv) basic accounting, (v) fiscal and legal obligations,\n(vi)  production,  and  (vii)  marketing.  A  system  of  business  incubators  will  also  be  established\nwithin  five  pilot  ETCs  to  support  up  to  750  new  entrepreneurs  in  developing  their  businesses.\nThe  subcomponent  will  provide  ETCs  with  management  and  marketing  support,  basic\nproduction  and  management  equipment,  information  materials,  and  programs  for  training  of\ntrainers.  The  subcomponent  will  cooperate  closely  with  the  proposed  ADB-financed  Rural\nFinance  SDP  and  GTZ  to  facilitate  access  of  beneficiaries  to  microloans  available  under  their\nmicrofinance programs.\n\n33 These  will  include  MECS  Vocational  Training  and  Production  Centers  as  well  as  private  sector  and  nonformal\n\n                  \n\ntraining providers.\n\n\f21\n\nc.\n\n            \n\nCapacity Building for Employment Services and Improvement of\n Working Conditions\n\n88.\nThe  subcomponents  will  enable  CERO  to  develop  management  information  systems,\nincluding  province  and  district-level  branches,  to  improve  (i)  management  of  resources  for\nservices  to  the  unemployed,  and  (ii)  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  employment  services.  The\nsubcomponent  will  provide  ICT  equipment,  management  support,  and  a  full  program  of  staff\ntraining.  LSWIA  will  also  be  strengthened  through  provision  of  technical  equipment,  staff\ntraining,  and  development  of  new  systems  for  improved  monitoring  of  employment  conditions\nand  worker  safety.  Public  education  campaigns34  will  also  be  undertaken  to  encourage  the\nunemployed to avail more of employment services.\n\n 3. \n\nComponent 3: Social Insurance Management and Training\n\n89.\nThe  component  will  support  upgrading  of  SSIGO\u2019s  capacity  for  managing  social\ninsurance  programs  by  providing  staff  training,  advanced  information  and  communications\ntechnologies,  and  information  materials.  Support  will  be  provided  for  upgrading  accounting\nsystems, and  strengthening the unemployment and occupational disease insurance programs.\nA  study  will  also  be  conducted  to  identify  mechanisms  for  including  the  self-employed  in  the\nsocial insurance system and to develop an action plan for expanding systems accordingly.\n\n90.\nA training needs analysis for provincial and district social insurance inspectors will also\nbe  conducted  to  assess  their  (i)  knowledge  of  most  recent  practices  and  procedures,  (ii)\ncomputer  literacy  and  data  processing  skills,  and  (iii)  management  skills  and  client  relations.\nBased on the assessment, a training program will be launched for up to 250 inspectors around\nthe  country.  The  subcomponent  will  also  support  a  public  information  campaign  through  the\nmass media on participation in social insurance schemes. The campaign will include provision\nof brochures, newspaper, television, and radio advertisements.\n\n 4. \n\nComponent 4: Support for Project Management\n\n91.\nThe Project will establish a project management unit (PMU) in MSWL to support project\nimplementation.  A  sub-PMU  will  also  be  established  in  MECS  to  implement  the  skills  training\nand  entrepreneurship  development  subcomponents  of  the  employment  promotion  component.\nThe  PMU  and  sub-PMU  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  aspects  of  implementation  in  their\nareas  of  responsibility,  including  procurement,  disbursement  issues,  reporting,  and  logistical\nsupport.  The  PMU  will  be  involved  in  technical  issues  related  to  the  project,  in  close\ncoordination with the relevant departments of MSWL and local administrations. The PMU will be\nstaffed  by  a  project  manager,  project  management  adviser  (international  consultant  for  eight-\nperson-months),35  a  social  welfare  and  insurance  specialist,  a  procurement  officer,  an\naccountant,  a  secretary,  and  a  driver.  The  sub-PMU  will  be  headed  by  a  project  coordinator\n(duties  will  include  responsibility  for  procurement)  who  will  report  to  the  project  manager,  and\nwill  be  staffed  by  a  training  specialist  and  an  accountant.  Each  unit  will  be  provided  with  the\nnecessary facilities and equipment, and a vehicle. Key PMU and sub-PMU staff will be trained in\nproject  planning  and  management,  monitoring,  and  evaluation.  The  component  will  also  fund\nthe  PMU\u2019s  recurrent  operational  expenses  under  normal  Government  budgetary  allocations.\nThe Project organization chart is provided in Appendix 9.\n\n                  \n\n34 Public  education  campaigns  will  be  conducted  jointly  with  the  social  insurance  component  to  ensure  optimal\n\ncoordination.\n\n35 With support from TA 2978 (footnote 28), MSWL has commenced recruiting the consultant.\n\n\f22\n\nF.  Social and Environmental Measures\n\n1.  Environmental Analysis\n\nNo  adverse  environmental  effects  are  expected  from  the  SSSDP.  Civil  works  will  be\n\n92.\nmostly upgrading of existing social welfare facilities scattered throughout the country.\n\n2.  Social Analysis\n\n93.\nThe social analysis  (Appendix 10) indicates that the SSSDP will improve the quality and\ncoverage  of  social  assistance  benefits  and  welfare  services,  employment  services,  and  social\ninsurance for poor people, including vulnerable groups (para.18) in particular. The SSSDP will\nincrease  the  proportion  of  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  that  are  covered  and  the  amount  they\nreceive through improved means testing.\n\n94.\nThe  current  system  of  welfare  services  for  the  elderly,  PWD,  and  children  in  difficult\ncircumstances is highly centralized and institution based. The SSSDP will focus on development\nof community-based approaches to providing welfare services, to enable those requiring social\nservices  to  remain  close  to  their  communities.  A  community-based  approach  has  proved  very\neffective  in  targeting  the  intended  beneficiaries.  In  economic  terms,  a  community-based\napproach provides benefits, delivery costs will be reduced, and income generation opportunities\nfor the local economy will increase. A community-based approach is based on an understanding\nof  peoples\u2019  vulnerability  and  needs,  and  of  their  assets  and  capabilities.  Different  groups  in\ndifferent  localities,  will  require  varied  types  of  interventions.  To  support  a  community-based\napproach,  a  new  framework  for  social  services  is  required  to  define  the  institutions,  assign\nresponsibilities, and ensure proper training of social workers to adapt to the new system.\n\n95.\nOne  of  the  main  factors  contributing  to  the  high  poverty  level  in  Mongolia  is  lack  of\nemployment  opportunities.  Vocational  and  skills  training  is  required  to  upgrade  the  skills  of  a\nlabor  force  that  has  been  trained  to  meet  the  job  requirements  of  a  command  economy.\nVocational and skills training is also essential for the many young people who need to enter the\nlabor  market  for  the  first  time.  There  is  a  marked  rural-urban  disparity  in  access  to  training\nopportunities. By decentralizing vocational and skills training as suggested in the SSSDP, rural\nunemployed will have increased access to improve their skills and employment opportunities.\n\n96.\nThe social analysis indicates that Mongolia has a large number of PWD who are capable\nof working. Mainstreaming PWD in vocational and skills training will provide these groups with\nincome  opportunities,  lift  a  significant  number  of  PWD  out  of  poverty,  and  integrate  some\nexcluded groups in the mainstream of the economy.\n\nSocial  insurance  systems  have  been  recognized  as  important  because  they  provide  a\n97.\nbuffer  against  poverty.  Many  families  in  Mongolia  depend  almost  entirely  on  the  income  from\ntheir social insurance (pensions), and all recipients of social insurance would be poor if they did\nnot receive their pensions. Almost 90 percent of pensioners are poor. At present 92 percent of\nthe employed are covered by social insurance on a compulsory basis. However, only 22 percent\nof herders and the self-employed are covered on a voluntary basis. Thus, most of these groups\nare vulnerable to loss of income due to illness, disability, work injury, and old age.\n\nUnemployment  benefits  from  the  social  insurance  system  only  cover  3  percent  of  the\n98.\nunemployed.  The  incidence  of  unemployment  and  number  of  unemployed  is  very  high  among\n\n\f23\n\nthe  age  group  15-25,  who  are  ineligible  for  unemployment-related  services  through  the  labor\nregistry, and informal sector workers are not eligible for labor force registry services.\n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED LOANS\n\nA. \n\nThe Policy Loan\n\n1. \n\nAmount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n\n99.\nThe proposed loan is for $8 million equivalent from the ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources,\nand will support the SSSDP policy program. The Borrower will be Mongolia. The loan will have a\nmaturity of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years. The interest charge during the grace\nperiod will be 1 percent per annum and 1.5 percent thereafter. The loan is expected to be used\nover 48 months, commencing from the date of loan effectiveness.\n\n100. Anticipated  total  costs  arising  from  the  policy  reform  program  will  exceed  $9.5  million\nequivalent. This figure comprises structural adjustment costs, which are estimated as being at\nleast  $6.5  million  equivalent  (Appendix  11)  and  costs  of  settling  arrears  pertaining  to  social\ninsurance  contributions  of  state  budget-funded  entities,  currently  amounting  to  about  $3.1\nmillion.  Structural  adjustment  costs36  will  result  from  the  following  policy  measures:  (i)\nrestructuring  SSWA  (including  Ulaanbaatar,  21  provincial  offices,  and  341  district  offices  to\nimplement the reformed social welfare benefits\u2019 system targeting the ultra poor and very poor;\n(ii) commencing phasing out of centralized social welfare institutions and restructuring of SSWA\nto  permit  greater  community-level  service  provision,  including  extensive  contracting  out  to  the\nprivate  sector;  (iii)  restructuring  of  EROs,  the  vocational  training  system,  and  district-based\nschools  to  introduce  employment-related  education  and  training  for  the  unemployed,  including\nprovision  for  contracting  out  training  services  to  the  private  sector;  (iv)  restructuring  of  the\nCERO and EROs so that uninsured unemployed people can avail of employment services; (v)\nrestructuring  of  SSWA  and  branches  to  develop  a  new  community-  and  family-based  social\nwork  service;  and  (vi)  restructuring  of  SSIGO  and  the  STGO  to  permit  greater  information\nexchange and improved support to social insurance inspectors for enforcing payment of social\ninsurance contributions.\n\n101.\nThe expenditure impact of reforms to social welfare services and benefits is expected to\nbe neutral. The expenditure impact on developing pro-poor labor market policies is expected to\nbe positive, due to the expansion of employment services to greater numbers of unemployed.\nThe  establishment  of  new  structures  for  development  and  delivery  of  employment  services  is\nexpected to increase expenditure. However, as existing structures will be used, the increase is\nexpected to be modest. The social insurance reforms are expected to increase revenues due to\nincreased  levels  of  compliance  and  settlement  of  arrears.  Increased  costs  of  the  reforms  are\nexpected to be offset by greater efficiencies in the sector as a result of (i) improved policies and\ndevelopment  plans,  (ii)  greater  management  and  monitoring  capacity  within  government\nagencies, and (iii) contracting services to the private sector.\n\n                  \n\n36  Defined  as  one-time,  nonrecurrent  costs  to  finance  reform  to  government  and  other  agencies,  institutions,  and\nother  structures  and  systems  to  reorient  themselves  in  accordance  with  the  demands  of  the  reformed  social\nsecurity system.\n\n\f24\n\n2.        Implementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\n\n102.\nThe  Executing  Agency  for  the  policy  program  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and\nEconomy  (MFE).  MFE  will  be  responsible  for  initiating  withdrawals  under  the  policy  loan,  the\nuse of counterpart funds generated by the loan proceeds, and the monitoring of these funds.\n\n103. A  steering  committee  for  the  SSSDP  as  a  whole  will  comprise  the  Minister  of  Social\nWelfare  and  Labor  as  chair;  Vice  Minister  of  Finance  and  Economy  as  deputy  chair;\nrepresentatives  from  MECS,  MFE,  MSWL,  and  the  Ministry  of  Health  (including  the  project\ndirector);  and  appropriate  representation  from  stakeholder  groups  such  as  the  National\nChildren\u2019s  Committee,  Veterans\u2019  Association,  NGOs  representing  PWD,  and  employers\u2019\nrepresentatives. The steering committee will provide policy guidance for the investment project.\nThe steering committee will be established prior to loan effectiveness, and will meet as often as\nnecessary, but at least once every three months.\n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement\n\n104. Eligible items will be procured through normal commercial practices by the private sector\nor  standard  Government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  for  procurement  by  the  public  sector.\nABD will ensure that standard procurement procedures used in the country are adequate from\nthe point of view of competition and efficiency.\n\n105.\nThe proceeds of the policy loan will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost of\nitems produced in and procured from ADB member countries (other than those items specified\nin a negative list [Appendix 12] and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources).\nDisbursements  will  be  made  under  the  simplified  procedures  for  program  loans,  approved  by\nADB\u2019s Board of Directors on 16 April 1998. With each withdrawal request, the Government will\ncertify that the value of Mongolia\u2019s total eligible imports is equal to or greater than the amount of\nADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the loan in a given period. ADB will have the right to audit\nthe use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification.\n\n4. \n\nCounterpart Funds\n\n106.\nThe  local  currency  generated  by  the  loan  proceeds  (i.e.,  the  counterpart  funds)  will  be\nused to support the costs of the policy loan program. Any counterpart funds not required for the\npolicy program will be used first to finance local currency costs of other ADB-financed projects\nand, second, for general development purposes.\n\n5. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching\n\n107. MSWL  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  policy  program,  and  will  prepare  and\nsubmit  to  ADB  quarterly  reports  on  the  implementation  of  the  policy  matrix,  including  the\ncompletion  of  the  actions  set  forth  in  the  development  policy  letter  and  the  policy  matrix.  The\nGovernment  and  ADB  will  review  implementation  semiannually,  and  assess  the  impact  of  all\nrelevant reforms on the social security sector and labor markets in particular and the economy\nin  general.  This  will  include  active  policy  dialogue  between  the  Government  and  ADB,  and\nconsultations  with  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies  supporting  social  security\ndevelopments  and  employment  promotion.  On  behalf  of  the  Government,  MFE  in  cooperation\nwith  MSWL  and  MECS  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  policy  reforms  supported  by  the\nSSSDP. Training for monitoring and evaluation in MSWL and MECS will assist the Government\n\n\f25\n\nin  monitoring  program  impacts.  ADB  will  combine  its  reviews  of  the  investment  project  with  a\nreview of the implementation of the policy program.\n\n108.\nThe  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  three  tranches,  the  first  of  $2  million  and  two\nsubsequent tranches of $3 million each. This allocation of funds allows for a relatively slow start\nto the process of policy reform, given the capacity of key agencies. Once capacity building and\nother activities commence under the investment project and the attached TA, the Government\nwill be able to accelerate the reform process by the time the second and third tranches are due.\nThe three-tranche structure allows for a more sustained passage of reform over a longer period\nof  time,  which  is  essential  for  the  more  complex  policy  components  to  succeed.  Such\ncomponents  include  promotion  of  community-based  approaches,  rationalizing  of  social\nassistance  benefits,  and  expansion  of  employment  services.  In  addition,  the  three-tranche\nstructure will allow for improved monitoring of the implementation of reforms and their impact on\nthe poor. The first tranche will be released upon loan effectiveness. The Borrower has satisfied\nthree  conditions  prior  to  Board  consideration  of  the  program  loan.  The  nine  conditions  for\nrelease of the second and third tranches, which are expected to take place 18 and 36 months\nafter the loan becoming effective, respectively, are set forth in the policy matrix (Appendix 7).\n\n109.\n\nThe Government will fulfill the following second tranche conditions by 31 October 2003:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nin  consultation  with  ADB,  amend  the  Social  Welfare  Law  to  allow  for  more\ncommunity-based  approaches  to  social  welfare,  including  participation  of  civil\nsociety organizations and the private sector;\n\nbased on the related study and in consultation with ADB, introduce the necessary\nregulatory framework concerning eligibility of people to benefit from employment\nservices, including training;\n\nSSIGO  and  the  STGO  will  design  and  implement  a  nationwide  program  of\nsharing data between themselves, in consultation with ADB; and\n\na social security master plan will be developed covering medium- and long-term\ndevelopment  of  MSWL\u2019s  mandated  areas  of  responsibility,  including  social\nwelfare, employment services, and social insurance (insurance to unemployment\nand occupational injuries and diseases).\n\n110.\n\nThe Government will fulfill the following third tranche conditions by 31 October 2005:\n\nfollowing  amendment  of  Social  Welfare  Law,  introduce  new  systems  for  the\ndistribution  of  social  assistance  benefits  and  means  testing  on  a  nationwide\nbasis,  and,  in  agreement  with  ADB,  allocate  sufficient  financial  resources  from\nthe budget and staff to implement the system;\n\ndevelop  a  legislative  framework  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  providing  training  for\nemployment;  include  provision  to  promote  competition  between  public  and\nprivate organizations offering training services and to allow private sector training\nproviders  to  lease  and  operate  state-owned  training  institutions,  facilities,  and\nassets;\n\n(iii) \n\ndevelop procedures and criteria (including core standards) for accrediting public\nand private sector vocational and skills training entities; develop and maintain a\n\n\f26\n\ndatabase  of  accredited  providers;  and  develop  and  implement  supervision\nsystems  to  safeguard  the  quality  of  training  in  accredited  institutions,  to  the\nsatisfaction of ADB;\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nin  consultation  with  ADB,  introduce  the  regulatory  framework  necessary  to\nensure  full  access  to  skills  and  vocational  training  for  PWD,  both  in  terms  of\nphysical  accessibility  and  suitability  of  courses,  and  establish  mechanisms  to\nmonitor implementation of the regulatory framework; and\n\nhave  MFE  deduct  the  outstanding  social  insurance  contributions  owed  by  state\nbudget-funded  entities  from  budget  allocations  in  2004,  and  transfer  the\nresources  to  the  appropriate  social  insurance  fund  as  defined  by  the  Social\nInsurance Law.\n\nThe policy program also includes other conditions that ADB will require the Borrower to\n\n111.\nfulfill prior to the end of the Program (expected in October 2005).\n\nB. \n\nThe Investment Loan\n\n1.\n\nAmount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n\n112.\nThe total project cost is $10 million equivalent. The proposed ADB loan is for $4 million\nequivalent,  from  its  Special  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  32  years,\nincluding a grace period of 8 years. Interest will be charged at 1 percent per annum during the\ngrace  period,  and  1.5  percent  thereafter.  The  Project  will  be  cofinanced  by  the  Nordic\nDevelopment  Fund  (NDF)  on  a  parallel-financing  basis.  NDF  will  finance  skills  training  and\nenterpreneurship  development  subcomponents  under  the  employment  promotion  component.\nThe proposed NDF loan is for $4 million equivalent. The loan will have a maturity of 40 years,\nincluding  a  grace  period  of  10  years.  A  service  charge  of  0.75  percent  per  annum  and  a\ncommitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum will be levied. Project cost estimates are provided in\nAppendix 11 and summarized in Table 1.\n\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates\n($ \u2018000)\n\nComponent\n\n     Foreign\n  Exchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nPercent of\nBase Cost\n\nSocial Welfare\n\nEmployment Services and\nWorking Conditions\n\nSocial Insurance\n\nProject Management Support\n\nPhysical Contingencies\n\nPrice Contingencies\n\nService Charge\n\n830\n\n2,610\n\n468\n\n642\n\n455\n\n109\n\n200\n\n1,314\n\n2,302\n\n397\n\n63\n\n408\n\n204\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n2,144\n\n4,912\n\n864\n\n705\n\n862\n\n313\n\n200\n\n25\n\n57\n\n10\n\n8\n\nTotal\n\n5,313\n\n4,687\n\n10,000\n\n\f27\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ \u2019000)\n\nSource\n\nAsian\nDevelopment\nBank\nNordic\nDevelopment\nFund\n\nGovernment\n\n            Total\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal Cost\n\nPercent\n\n2,773\n\n2,540\n\n0\n\n5,313\n\n1,226\n\n1,461\n\n2,000\n\n4,687\n\n4,000\n\n4,000\n\n2,000\n\n10,000\n\n40\n\n40\n\n20\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\n\n           a.\n\nExecuting Agency and Implementing Agency\n\n113. MSWL will be the executing agency for the investment project. The subcomponents on\nskills  training  and  entrepreneurship  development  will  be  implemented  by  MECS,  arranged\nthrough a joint order between MSWL and MECS outlining their responsibilities.\n\nb.\n\nProject Management Arrangements\n\nThe Minister, MSWL, will appoint a project director who will assume responsibility for the\n114.\noverall execution and supervision of the project. The steering committee for the SSSDP (para.\n103) will be established prior to loan effectiveness, and will meet as often as necessary, but at\nleast once every three months. A PMU will be established in MSWL37 (para. 91), appointed by\nthe Government subject to ADB and NDF concurrence. A sub-PMU will also be established in\nMECS to implement the skills training and entrepreneurship development subcomponents of the\nemployment promotion component. Staff will be seconded from MSWL, SSWA, CERO, SSIGO,\nLSWIA, provincial and district administrations, MECS vocational training and production centers,\nnursing homes, and other social welfare facilities to ensure effective implementation of project\nactivities. MSWL will be requested to provide a staffing plan prior to loan effectiveness detailing\nstaff resources available to the project.\n\nThe  project  director  will  be  responsible  for  coordination  with  other  externally-financed\n115.\ninterventions, including the Business Services Development Project financed by UNDP and the\nSwedish International Development Agency as well as with the GTZ Microfinance Program. The\nproject  director  will  also  be  involved  in  coordinating  the  SSSDP  with  the  proposed  ADB  Rural\nFinance  Project  and  GTZ,  to  ensure  that  beneficiaries  of  training  and  other  support  under  the\nSSSDP have facilitated access to support under their microloans program.\n\n                  \n\n37 MSWL commenced preparations for establishing the PMU in the latter half of April 2001, and appointed key staff\n\npositions to coincide with loan negotiations.\n\n\f                       c. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n28\n\n116.\nThe project will be implemented over five years in accordance with the implementation\nschedule  given  in  Appendix  13.  It  is  expected  to  commence  in  October  2001,  and  to  be\ncompleted by October 2006. Given MSWL\u2019s relative inexperience with ADB- and NDF-financed\nprojects, a relatively slow start to the project has been planned, with only 7.5 percent of funds\nprojected  for  disbursement  in  the  first  year  of  implementation.  This  will  allow  a  focus  on\nestablishment of project management, implementation, monitoring systems, and initial surveys\nand other analyses required to implement of the key project activities. Disbursement rates are\nexpected to peak in the third year, reaching 30 percent of total project funds.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement and Consulting Services\n\na.\n\nProcurement\n\n117. All  procurement  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines for\nProcurement. Procurement  of  equipment,  furniture,  vehicles,  and  materials  will  be  awarded\nthrough  international  shopping  for  contract  packages  of  less  than  $300,000  equivalent,  in\naccordance  with  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Small  contracts  of  less  than  $100,000\nequivalent each may be filled by direct purchase. Local competitive bidding will be undertaken\nfor civil works contracts. The PMU will be responsible for overall procurement activities; the sub-\nPMU  will  be  responsible  for  procurement  activities  under  skills  training  and  entrepreneurship\ndevelopment subcomponents implemented by MECS.\n\n118. Civil works under the Project will involve the construction, upgrading, and rehabilitation\nof social welfare and training facilities. These include (i) nursing homes for the elderly and other\nvulnerable groups, (ii) the National Center for Rehabilitation of the Disabled, (iii) technical and\nvocational  schools,  (iv)  common  premises  for  MSWL  agencies,  and  (v)  provincial  and  district\nsocial  security  centers.  As  these  civil  works  components  are  relatively  small  and  scattered\nthroughout the country they are unlikely to attract the interest of international construction firms.\nTherefore, procurement will be through local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB,\nwithout  precluding  interested  foreign  bidders  from  participating.  Suitable  contractors  will  be\nidentified through prequalification. Contractors will be required to give appropriate warranties for\ntheir  work.  Given  the  small  size  of  many  contracts,  where  the  borrower  has  the  capacity  to\nundertake works expeditiously and at reasonable cost, a force account may be used. Similarly,\ncommunity participation in small-scale civil works will be promoted where applicable. Appendix\n14 shows the indicative contract packages for procurement.\n\nb.\n\nConsulting Services\n\nThe  project  provides  for  a  total  of  50  person-months  of  international  services  and  153\n119.\nperson-months  of  domestic  consulting.  Consulting  services  will  also  be  provided  under  civil\nworks  contracts  on  a  lump  sum  basis.  The  international  and  domestic  consultants,  with  input\nduration ranging from 1 to 12 months, will support MSWL, its specialized agencies, MECS, and\nother social security entities covered by the project in all aspects of training and development.\nInternational consultants under the ADB loan will be selected and recruited in accordance with\nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Domestic consultants will be recruited by the PMU\n\n\f29\n\nunder  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB.38  The  terms  of  reference  of  the  consultants  are\nsummarized in Appendix 15.\n\n4.\n\nDisbursement Arrangements and Imprest Fund\n\n120. All  forms  of  disbursements  under  the  project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with\nGovernment and ADB guidelines and procedures. To expedite disbursement of loan proceeds,\nthe project will use an imprest account. The imprest account will be established in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements between the Government\nand  ADB.  The  account  will  be  opened  by  the  PMU  in  a  commercial  bank  to  be  selected\naccording to Government and ADB guidelines. The initial amount to be deposited in the imprest\naccount will not exceed six months of project expenses and is estimated at $250,000.\n\n121. Statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures\nunder  the  project,  and  to  liquidate  advances  provided  to  the  imprest  accounts  in  accordance\nwith procedures satisfactory to ADB and consistent with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.\nEach individual payment reimbursed or liquidated under the procedures will not exceed $50,000\nequivalent for each item of expenditure.\n\n122. While  the  community  social  welfare  innovation  facility  will  be  governed  by  its  own\nspecific  procedures  (Appendix  8),  the  funds  for  this  development  facility  will  be  disbursed\naccording  to  the  same  guidelines  and  procedures  as  for  other  project  components.  Upon\napproval  of  proposals  and  by  the  technical  committee,  the  PMU  may  use  either  the  project's\nimprest account or submit withdrawal applications to ADB to release the required funds.\n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption\n\n123. During  project  processing,  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  Government\nofficials,  including  the  need  to  ensure  transparency  and  accountability  in  all  project  activities.\nThey were advised that (i) ADB will reject a proposal of award if it determines that a bidder has\nengaged in corrupt or fraudulent practices when competing for the contract in question; (ii) any\nexpenditure  incurred  with  or  through  corrupt  or  fraudulent  practices  will  not  be  reimbursable;\n(iii) any firm or individual found to have engaged in such practices will be declared ineligible for\nADB-financed contracts, either indefinitely or for a stated period; and (iv) where such practices\nhave  been  engaged  in  and  the  Government  has  not  taken  timely  and  appropriate  remedial\naction, the relevant portions of the loan may be canceled.\n\n6. \n\nProject Reviews\n\n124.\nIn addition to semiannual reviews, a comprehensive midterm review will be undertaken\nby the Government and ADB at about the end of the second year of project implementation to\nassess the project\u2019s progress and achievements against its objectives; to identify any difficulties\nbeing encountered; and recommend remedial action, if and where required.\n\n7. \n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\n125.\nThe  PMU  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  project  implementation  and  provide  them  to\nADB  within  30  days  after  the  end  of  the  applicable  period.  The  reports  will  be  provided  in  the\n\n                  \n\n38 According the specific packages of consulting services, domestic consultants will be recruited both under separate\n\ncontracts and under the same contracts as international consultants.\n\n\f30\n\nformat of ADB\u2019s project performance report and will include progress made against established\ntargets and problems encountered during the period under review, steps taken and proposed to\nbe  taken  to  resolve  the  problems,  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  and  the  work  program\nproposed to be undertaken during the succeeding quarter. Brief monthly reports by facsimile or\nelectronic mail are also recommended to enhance proactive project management. The PMU will\nmonitor the progress of implementation. Within three months after the physical completion of the\nproject,  MSWL  will  submit  a  project  completion  report  to  ADB  providing  details  on\nimplementation, accomplishments, benefits, and evaluation.\n\n126. Separate records and accounts for all expenditures to be financed out of the proceeds of\nthe  loans  will  be  maintained  by  MSWL  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  The\nsub-PMU at MECS will also maintain separate reports and accounts for NDF-financed activities\nunder the employment promotion and improvement of working conditions component. They will\nspecify the expenditures for all activities and identify all expenditures to be financed out of the\nloan  proceeds.  Project  accounts,  including  financial  statements,  statements  of  expenditures,\nand  imprest  account  records,  will  be  audited  annually  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The\nauditors\u2019 report, and copies of the certified accounts and related financial statements, including\nthe auditors\u2019 opinions on the use of loan proceeds, compliance with loan covenants, and the use\nof the imprest account under ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedures, will be submitted to\nADB in English not later than six months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate.\n\n8.  Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n127. MSWL  will  modify  the  existing  management  information  system  for  the  social  security\nsystem to allow clear and ongoing impact assessment of project activities without establishing\nduplicate  reporting  structures.  This  will  include  quantitative  and  qualitative  data  on  social\nwelfare,  social  insurance,  and  employment  promotion  services  and  will  include  indicators\nspecified  in  the  SSSDP  framework  (Appendix  1).  Efficiency  of  service  provision  will  also  be\nmeasured under this system. The project will support achievement of the required modifications.\nMSWL  will  develop  additional  indicators  for  the  system  and  the  finalized  system  will  be\nsubmitted to ADB for concurrence within three months after loan effectiveness.\n\nVI.\n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n\n128.\nThe SSSDP will be accompanied by advisory TA to support the Government\u2019s efforts to\nstrengthen  social  security  reform.  Specifically,  the  TA  for  Strengthening  Policy  for  Social\nSecurity Reform will help develop a long-term vision and strategic framework and action plans\nfor social security development in the country. The TA will build the activities started during the\nproject  preparatory  TA  and  assist  Government  officials  in  carrying  out  a  full  review  of  the\ncountry\u2019s  strengths,  weaknesses,  opportunities,  and  threats  with  respect  to  the  social  security\nsector.  Existing  legislation,  policies,  and  programs  will  be  reviewed  and  proposals  for\nimprovement  enshrined  in  a  social  security  master  plan,  which  will  developed  with  full\nparticipation  of  key  stakeholders  and  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies.  MSWL  will  be  the\nExecuting  Agency  for  the  TA.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $720,000  equivalent,  comprising\n$450,000 in foreign exchange and $270,000 equivalent in local currency cost. Of these costs,\nADB  will  provide  $600,000  equivalent  on  a  grant  basis,  from  the  ADB-funded  TA  program  to\nfinance  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $150,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.\nThe TA is described in Appendix 16.\n\n\f31\n\nVII.\n\nBENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA. \n\nExpected Impacts\n\n1. \n\nBenefits\n\n129.\nThe  main  benefit  of  the  SSSDP  will  be  to  reduce  poverty  and  increase  security  of\nvulnerable  groups  by  creating  a  sustainable  social  security  system  that  is  (i)  capable  of\ndelivering  adequate  essential  services  to  the  poor,  and  (ii)  cost  effective  and  efficient.  The\nproject  will  improve  quality  and  coverage  of  social  assistance  benefits  and  welfare  services,\nemployment  services,  and  social  insurance,  which  will  directly  benefit  poor  and  vulnerable\ngroups  dependent  on  social  services.  Principal  beneficiaries  of  the  reformed  social  security\nsystem  will  include  870,000  people,  72  percent  living  below  the  poverty  line.  The  direct\nbeneficiaries of the investment components of the project are 20,000 very poor, including most\nvulnerable children, elderly and PWD: all groups that have disproportionately borne the brunt of\nthe difficult transition period.\n\n130. Developing  management  information  systems  in  social  welfare  agencies  and  EROs  at\nprovincial  and  district  levels,  will  contribute  to  more  effectively  monitoring  mechanisms  of  the\nimpact  of  different  social  welfare  and  employment  services,  and  thus  allow  for  more  effective\nand equitable use of social welfare resources and improved employment conditions.\n\n131.\nThe  focus  on  fostering  private  sector  participation  in  providing  social  security  services\nover the medium to long term is expected to mobilize resources to supplement public budgetary\nexpenditure and provide users with a greater choice of services. Improved targeting will mean a\nmore  efficient  use  of  resources  and  institutional  and  organizational  reforms  will  result  in\nsignificant recurrent cost savings.\n\nThe development of a comprehensive master plan will benefit the social security sector\n132.\nby providing a formal framework for medium- and long-term policy and planning. This will permit\na  shift  from  short-term,  uncoordinated  interventions  to  a  more  effective  system  better  able  to\naddress poverty reduction on a sustainable basis.\n\n2. \n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n133.\nThe SSSDP addresses key areas of reform in social protection and labor markets. The\npolicy  conditions  of  the  SSSDP  are  pro-poor  and  contribute  to  overall  poverty  reduction  by\npromoting  human  resource  development,  improved  governance,  and  pro-poor  growth  through\nallowing  the  poor  to  compete  better  in  challenging  labor  markets.  Policy  reforms  related  to\nimproving  the  quality  and  coverage  of  social  welfare  benefits  and  allowances  will  have  a\nsubstantial  impact  on  the  welfare  of  the  poor  by  increasing  the  proportion  of  poor  who  are\ncovered by the system.\n\n134. Up  to  230,000  people  are  expected  to  benefit  from  the  social  assistance  and  welfare\npolicy  services  component  of  whom  160,000  currently  live  below  the  poverty  line.  The  main\nbeneficiaries are the most vulnerable among the elderly, PWD, pregnant and nursing mothers,\nmothers with many dependent children and single-headed households.\n\n135. Policy  reforms  related  to  the  labor  market  and  skills  training  will  enable  access  to\nadvisory and counseling services offered by EROs and quality employment-oriented education\nand training to increased numbers of the unemployed who currently have no such opportunities.\n\n\f32\n\nThe availability of such programs will be enhanced by enabling private sector participation in the\ndelivery  of  education  and  training  programs.  Up  to  260,000  unemployed  people,  of  whom\n143,000 live below the poverty line, are likely to benefit from expanded access to employment\nservices.\n\n136.\nImproving  SSIGO\u2019s  ability  to  enforce  compliance  of  social  insurance  payments  will\nincrease  levels  of  security  for  workers  close  to  the  poverty  line  by  ensuring  that  they  receive\nbenefit payments in the case of unemployment or occupational injuries or diseases. Clearing up\nthe sizable arrears of state budget organizations will reduce delays in providing social insurance\nbenefits, a major source of income for poor households. About 330,000 people will benefit from\nthis intervention, including 285,000 who live below the poverty line.\n\nThe  investment  project  is  directly  targeting  the  extreme  poor  and  vulnerable  groups.\n137.\nSocial welfare service facilities will be improved, targeting, among others, PWD and elderly. To\ntarget the extreme poor, community-based projects will be established to improve the quality of\nlife, protect the poorest of the poor, and raise levels of human development in selected areas.\nAbout 10,000 poor people will directly benefit from these activities. Additionally, 9,750 very poor\nunemployed  (of  whom  females  are  disproportionately  represented)  will  be  trained  to  increase\ntheir income opportunities under the investment component.\n\nB.\n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\n138. Political  Risks.  Although  the  Government  changed  frequently  in  the  late  1990s,\ndelaying  the  processing  of  the  SSSDP,  the  current  Government  is  stable  and  the  SSSDP\u2019s\nimplementation  is  not  likely  to  be  disrupted.  Implementation  of  reforms,  which  will  change\ncriteria for entitlement to social welfare benefits, could prove controversial and may encounter\nresistance.  Consequently,  effective  support  measures,  especially  for  employment  promotion,\nneed to be provided for people whose entitlement is removed. At the same time, the quality of\nsocial welfare services must be improved to convince the public of the need for such reforms.\nReforms in social insurance must also be handled carefully to prevent loss of confidence in the\nsystem.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  the  principal  safeguard  will  be  ensuring  maximum  popular\nparticipation in designing and implementing the measures. To achieve this, the local parliaments\nmust  have  a  role  in  the  change,  and  public  education  campaigns  should  be  well  used  to  gain\nsupport for policy reforms.\n\n139.\nInstitutional Risks. A potential risk to effective implementation is the lack of institutional\ncapacity  for  undertaking  and  sustaining  wide-ranging  reforms,  given  the  severe  budgetary\nconstraints  that  have  led  to  shortages  of  qualified  personnel.  Capacity  building,  with  focus  on\nupgrading of  skills and knowledge  of key staff, will, therefore, be crucial to the success of  the\nSSSDP.  Foreign  and  local  training  should  be  offered  at  postgraduate  levels  to  ensure  that\nMongolian  specialists  have  access  to  the  latest  and  most  comprehensive  learning  resources.\nThis will also serve as a major incentive to staff to remain in public service.\n\n140.\nIn  addition,  the  implementation  of  the  SSSDP  requires  close  coordination  between\nseveral  central-  and  regional-level  government  agencies.  Costs  of  communication,  staff\nshortages,  and  imperfect  coordination  procedures  generally  render  this  difficult.  Furthermore,\nkey  agencies  have \nincluding\nmanagement  of  efficient  procurement  and  disbursement  processes.  While  capacity-building\nmeasures should be in place to develop these competencies, a dedicated project management\nstructure  should  be  established  for  the  lifetime  of  the  SSSDP  to  ensure  achievement  of  its\nobjectives.\n\ninternational  project  management, \n\nlittle  experience  with \n\n\f33\n\n141. Economic Risks. One of the key objectives of the SSSDP is to reduce unemployment.\nAs, however, the responsibility now for creation of new jobs lies primarily in the private sector,\nthe  overall  enabling  environment,  and  especially  the  macroeconomic  situation,  will  determine\ntheir  ability  to  provide  employment.  Thus,  the  SSSDP  will  need  to  coordinate  fully  with  other\ninterventions  designed  to  promote  macroeconomic  stability  and  engender  economic  growth  in\nMongolia.\n\n142. Other Risks. The Government\u2019s formal social security system is an important element of\na comprehensive social security system but not the only one. The design and implementation of\nthe  social  security  system  must  be  coordinated  with  strategies  aimed  at  addressing  other\ndimensions of vulnerability for the Mongolian people.\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVIII.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n143.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\nWithin six months after the loans become effective, MSWL will develop indicators\nfor modification of the standard monitoring and evaluation subsystem, and submit\nthe specifications of the modified system for ADB\u2019s concurrence.\n\n(ii)  Within  18  months  after  the  loans  become  effective  the  Government  will\nthe\n\nretraining,  and  skills  upgrading  programs \n\ncommence \nunemployed, in accordance with a plan acceptable to ADB.\n\ntraining, \n\nfor \n\n(iii)  Within  18  months  after  the  loans  become  effective,  the  Government  will\ncommence  implementing  a  program  for  facilitating  access  of  beneficiaries  to\nongoing  and  planned  microfinance  schemes,  in  accordance  with  a  plan\nacceptable to ADB.\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  first  three  applications  slated  for  approval  by  the  community  social  welfare\ninnovation  will be reviewed jointly with ADB before final approval.\n\nThe Borrower will ensure that the investment project is carried out, and all project\nfacilities  are  constructed,  operated,  maintained,  and  monitored  in  accordance\nwith  the  existing  laws,  regulations,  and  standards  of  the  Borrower  concerning\nenvironmental protection, and with ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines.\n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Negotiations\n\n144.

Access  to  employment  was  nearly  universally\nguaranteed  and  there  was  no  recognized  unemployment.  Health  and  education  services  were\nwidespread  and  accessible  because  of  the  high  priority  the  Government  placed  on  human\ndevelopment. The social security system was based on a combination of consumer subsidies,\nuniversal  benefits  transferred  from  the  central  budget,  and  state  sector  wages.  All  sectors  of\nsociety  were  covered  by  the  pension  systems  and  the  state  also  provided  a  comprehensive\nrange of social protection benefits to families, children, and groups designated as \u201cvulnerable.\u201d\nAbout 40 percent of government expenditures were devoted to social development.a\n\nFollowing transition, the Government made steps to change the social welfare  system\n2.\nfrom provision of universal access to targeted interventions. Additionally, expenditures allocated\nto  social  security  remained  relatively  high,  16.5  percent  of  total  public  expenditures  in  1998.\nDespite these efforts the present social welfare system, which covers retirement, disability and\nsurvivor  pensions,  work  injury,  unemployment,  maternity  benefits,  health,  a  social  insurance\nsystem, and a national poverty alleviation program have had limited impact on poverty.\n\nA.       Poverty and Social Characteristics\n\n3.\nThe  incidence  of  poverty  in  Mongolia  is  high;  about  36  percent  of  the  population  live\nbelow the poverty line and about 20 percent live in extreme poverty.b The last official estimate of\npoverty showed that poverty was disproportionately urban, with 57.2 percent of the poor resided\nin urban areas and 42.8 percent residing in rural areas. However the weather-induced shock of\nthe severe storms in the winters of 1999 \u2013 2000 and 2000-2001 and the intervening drought in\nthe summer of 2000 has had a deleterious impact on the rural population.\n\nGrowth in income poverty since 1990 has been accompanied by a concomitant decline\n4.\nin the ability to enjoy basic capabilities. Problems of malnutrition among children under five have\nraised  concerns  about  food  security.  Previous  achievements  in  education  have  been  eroded.\nEnrollment  in  grades  1  to  8  declined  from  near  universal  levels  (99  percent)  in  1990  to  82\npercent  in  1997.  While  concerted  efforts  by  the  Government  resulted  in  an  increase  in\nenrollment  rates  to  90  percent,  the  decline  in  the  intervening  years  however,  has  produced  a\nlarge number of children whose capacities in the long term have been impaired by the years of\nlost education.\n\nThe  official  rate  of  unemployment  is  6.5  percentc  (39,000  people)  but  actual  levels  are\n5.\nundeniably higher. Actual unemployment (after adjusting for those employed outside the formal\nsector) ranges from 17 to 23 percent of the population. The provinces in particular have suffered\nfrom massive layoffs of workers by private firms and the public service. Also, the incidence of\nyoung  people  unable  to  work  is  increasing  with  severe  social  and  economic  consequences.\nLoss  of  employment  is  the  most  prevalent  trigger  of  impoverishment  in  Mongolia.d  Nearly  58\npercent of all unemployed are poor.\n\n                  \n\na  Mongolia, A Poverty Reduction Strategy for ADB Operations in Mongolia, May 2000.\nb  From the 1998 Living Standard and Measurement Survey, (LSMS). The LSMS is based on an expenditure-based\npoverty line for an intake of 2,100 Kilocalorie., which is comparable with the norm in other developing countries.\nc  The  official  definition  considers  the  unemployed  to  be  the  number  of  people  who  have  registered  with  the  labor\nregistry  as  unemployed.  This  excludes  first  time  labor  market  entrants  ineligible  for  labor  registry  services  and\nthose who perceive no value in registering. Hidden unemployment is estimated at 12 percent (footnote 1).\n\nd  Participatory Living Standards Assessment, Draft, 2000\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 5, page 2\n\nThe existing social security system has proved inadequate dealing with poverty. Social\n6. \ninsurance and social assistance do not guarantee recipients freedom from poverty as minimum\nand  average  pension  rates  are  very  low,  and  access  to  unemployment  benefits  is  limited  for\ngroups  such  as  small-scale  herders  and  informal  sector  workers.  Only  9,000  individuals\nreceived unemployment benefits from the social insurance system in 2000. The unemployment\ninsurance  system  is  performing  virtually  no  role  in  reducing  poverty  because  the  eligibility\ncriteria for payment exclude are too strict in relation to the mainly young unemployed population.\nNor is the system assisting in  employment generation, as few beneficiaries take advantage of\nthe small training grant to which they are entitled.\n\n7.\nAddressing  the  structural  nature  of  poverty  in  Mongolia,  the  social  security  system,\nincluding employment generation, should be the main program for assisting the poor.e Studies\non sources of livelihood in Ulaanbaatar, provincial centers, and district Centers indicate that the\npoor and the very poor in particular rely significantly on pension and allowances,f indicating the\nimportance  of  strengthening  these  schemes  to  improve  the  economic  and  social  security  for\npoor and vulnerable groups.\n\n8.\nThe  social  welfare  system  will  need  considerable  restructuring  to  reduce  the  cost  of\nservices  delivered  and  to  streamline  social  welfare  beneficiary  rolls  (some  categories  such  as\nwar  veterans  have  tripled  in  size  over  a  three-year  period).  Significant  new  investment  is\nneeded as there has been little investment in the last 10 years and the legacy infrastructure of\nthe Soviet era is expensive to operate. The level of services has deteriorated due to decaying\ninfrastructure-heating and electricity are examples. Deterioration is also apparent in health and\neducation  services  and  the  number  and  quality  of  facilities  and  homes  for  those  with  physical\nand  mental  disabilities  have  been  reduced.  Families  are  finding  it  harder  to  take  care  of  their\nmore  vulnerable  members  in  the  difficult  economic  circumstances  and  the  traditional  social\nnetworks of assistance are gradually breaking down. Finally, some of the subsidies provided are\nenjoyed more by nonpoor than poor.\n\nB.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n1. \n\nVulnerable Groups\n\n9.\nThe  Government  has  identified  orphans,  people  with  disabilities  (PWD),  single\nhousehold  pensioners,  female-headed  households,  households  with  more  than  four  children,\nthe unemployed, and small herders in remote areas to be particularly vulnerable to poverty. The\ngroups  identified  as  the  poorest  and  vulnerable  include  those  who  work  outside  the  formal\nsector and hence find themselves ineligible for the formal safety net.\n\n10.\nThe most important safety net for very poor and vulnerable groups in Mongolia remains\nthe  informal  safety  nets  through  extended  kinship  networks,  usually  from  younger  to  older\nmembers  of  the  family.  This  is  particularly  strong  in  rural  areas,  but  has  increased  in  urban\nareas as a result of the dramatic rural-to-urban migration that has been taking place during the\ntransition.  Kinship  networks  are  likely  weaker  than  before  but  still  play  an  important  role  in\n\n                  \n\ne  The Poverty Partnership Agreement between the Government and Asian Development Bank (ADB) has identified\n\nf \n\nunemployment as one of the leading causes of poverty\nIn Ulaanbaatar, 56 percent of the poor and 100 percent of the very poor rely on pension and allowances. The same\nfigure  is  46  percent  and  89  percent  in  provincial  center,  and  50  percent  and  61  percent  in  district  centers.\nParticipatory Living Standards Assessment, Draft, 2000.\n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 5, page 3\n\ncoping  strategies  for  households.  The  growing  inequality  has  modified  the  nature  of  kinship\nnetworks, often turning them into patron-client relations, as poorer relatives offer their labor to\nthe wealthier kin in exchange for food and other services.\n\n2. \n\nGender\n\n11.\nDuring the transition to a new market economy, the economic and social independence\nof the female half of the population has been severely undermined. Reduction in health and/or\nsocial services results in women having to spend more time caring for the young, sick, and/or\nelderly.\n\n12. Women account for 52.2 percent of the unemployed.g Women were the first to be laid off\nupon  closure  or  restructuring  of  processing,  and  trade  industries  that  traditionally  hired  many\nwomen.  After  disintegration  of  Government-owned  agricultural  farms  and  privatization  of  their\nlivestock and machinery, more than 20,000 trained women lost their jobs.h Only 39.7 percent of\nwomen receive any social benefits as compared to 60.4 percent of men.\n\n13. \nAccording to the Law on Pensions and Benefits from the Social Insurance Fund (1995),\nmany women aged 36-55 who had 4 or more children are pushed into retirement. Because of\nthis law, women\u2019s right to work, and choose their jobs is limited. Additionally, women aged 55\nwho  contributed  to  the  Pension  Fund  for  not  less  than  20  years  can  receive  pension  if  they\ndesire so; men must be 60. This forces women into earlier retirement than men.\n\n14.\nSpecific attention needs to be paid to women\u2019s unique problems and life patterns when\nconsidering social welfare services and benefits, labor market policies, and strengthening of the\nsocial insurance system. Labor market interventions must go beyond a purely traditional agenda\nto  adequately  address  special  concerns  of  women,  such  as  a  higher  incidence  of  homework,\ncompeting demands from other household responsibilities, and the particular needs surrounding\nchild  bearing.  Social  insurance  programs  need  to  be  designed  to  take  into  account  the  longer\nlives of women, and the additional implications for women of the risk of loss of support due to\ndeath, of abandonment by or divorce from a spouse, and the less stable earning patterns found\namong women.\n\n3. \n\nPeople with Disabilities\n\n15.\nA survey conducted by the National Center of Vocational Training and Rehabilitation in\nMarch 2001, showed that Mongolia has 115,000 PWD. Of an estimated 39,700 PWD capable of\nworking,  only  5,200  (13.1  percent)  are  actually  employed.  The  unemployment  rate  of  PWD  is\ntherefore,  extremely  high  at  86.9  percent.  Combined  with  the  massive  deterioration  of  social\nwelfare  and  social  insurance  services  for  PWD  since  1991,  poverty  rates  of  PWD  show  that\nmore than 50 percent live in poverty and more than 60 percent are women.\n\n16.\nAlthough legislation to protect and support PWD is fairly well developed, implementation\nis  insufficient  due  to  severe  budgetary  constraints.  In  the  first  three  quarters  of  2000,  20,085\nPWD  received  disability  pensions  from  the  MWSL.  However,  the  social  welfare  to  which  they\nare  entitled  is  frequently  insufficient  and  forces  them  to  rely  on  relatives  and/or  charity  for\nsupport.\n\n                  \n\ng  The National CEDAW Watch Network Center, 2001\nh  Situational Analysis of Women in Mongolia, 2000, Draft.

Improving the quality and coverage of social welfare\nservices and benefits will sharpen the targeting of benefits to cover a greater proportion of  the\npoor  through  improved  means  testing.  The Project will benefit 870,000 individuals of which\n72.3 percent is living below the poverty line.\n\n18.\nComponent  1.  The  beneficiaries  of  the  social  assistance  and  welfare  policy  services\ncomponent  are  the  currently  about  230,000  social  welfare  beneficiaries  receiving  short-term\nbenefits,  discounts,  and  in-kind  benefits.  The  main  recipients  of  social  assistance  benefit  and\nwelfare  services  are  the  elderly,  PWD,  pregnant  and  nursing  mothers,  mothers  with  many\ndependent  children,  and  surviving  dependents  of  household  that  have  lost  their  main\nbreadwinner.  About  70  percent  of  the  social  welfare  beneficiaries  can  be  considered  income\npoor.  Thus,  about  160,000  poor  people  will  benefit  directly  from  improving  the  quality  and\ncoverage of social welfare services and benefits.\n\n19.\nThe  investment  component  will  upgrade  nursing  homes  and  the  National  Center  for\nRehabilitation of the Disabled. Upgrading of nursing homes will improve access for 1,000 poor\npeople especially PWD and elderly. The support to the National Center for Rehabilitation of the\nDisabled  will  provide  improved  service  to  1,500  PWD.  Three  pilot  social  security  centers  will\nimprove  services  to  more  than  5,000  poor  clients.  To  target  the  extreme  poor,  and  develop\nmodels for community-based social welfare services, the investment component will initiate 50\ncommunity-based projects supporting up to 4,000 people, including vulnerable groups such as\nPWD, elderly, children, and single-parent families.\n\nDeveloping community-based social service delivery will lower cost and increase quality\n20.\nand  the  utilization  rate  by  the  needy  who  remain  largely  unserved.  At  the  same  time,  a\ncommunity based approach will help keep social welfare clients in their own communities while\ncreating needed income generating opportunities.\n\n21.\nComponent  2.  Employment  services  focus  on  upgrading  the  skills  of  the  labor  force\nwhich is key to expansion of the private sector generating sustainable employment creation and\nto  enabling  Mongolia  to  compete  in  an  increasingly  globalized  economy.  Policy  reform  will\nenable access to labor registry services and quality vocational and skills training to the bulk of\nunemployed  who  remain  unserved  and  ensure  that  unemployed  are  equipped  with  skills\nrelevant  to  the  labor  market.  The  availability  of  skills  training  resources  will  be  enhanced  by\nenabling private sector participation in the delivery of skills training. The increased pool of skilled\nworkers will support expansion of the private sector currently hampered by limited availability of\nskilled workers and promote pro-poor growth. This in turn will generate revenues through taxes\nthat  can  be  used  to  fund  further  investment  in  human  resource  development  and  social\nprotection.\n\n22.\nIncreased  vocational  and  skills  training  will  be  provided  to  about  260,000  unemployed\npeople.  As  55  percent  of  the  unemployed  are  poor,  the  number  of  poor  beneficiaries  is\nestimated at 143,000, including about 90,000 school graduates and  leavers who are unable to\nfind employment and not eligible for unemployment-related services through the labor registry.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 5, page 5\n\nComponent  2  will  rehabilitate  25  Employment  Training  Centers  (ETCs)  and  train  5,000\n23. \nunemployed people.  Decentralized Employment Education Centers (EECs)  will  be established\nproviding  training  opportunities  for  4,000  young  unemployed.i  Business  development  services\nwill be developed in 10 ETCs, targeting the unemployed and poor in particular; 5,000 people will\nbe trained in business development services. Increasing the provision of vocational training and\nskills  training  programs  to  the  unemployed  and  poor  will  reduce  these  groups\u2019  risk  of/and\nvulnerability to interruption of income due to illness or temporary unemployment.\n\nComponent 3. In 1999, social insurances covered 650,000 individuals. Social insurance\n24.\ncover  pensions,  benefits,  health,  employment  injury,  and  unemployment.    The  SSSDP  will\nupgrade the management capacity of the Social Insurance General Office (SSIGO), which will\nensure  more  efficient  and  effective  handling  of  social  insurance  services.  Increasing  the\ncoverage to the self-employed and herders will improve security of many vulnerable people, at\nrisk of falling into poverty.\n\n25.\nMany retirees and their families depend almost entirely on the income from their social\ninsurance,  and  most  recipients  of  social  insurance  would  be  poor  if  they  did  not  receive  their\npensions. Some proportions of social insurance recipients are poor because their pension may\nbe  the  only  income  of  the  household.  About  330,000  beneficiaries  will  benefit  from  the  social\ninsurance program, and 285,000 of the beneficiaries live below the poverty line.\n\n26.\nIndirectly  the  SSSDP  will  benefit  the  poor  by  developing  management  information\nsystems in social welfare agencies and Central Employment Regulation Office at provincial and\ndistrict  levels. This will  contribute  to  more  effectively  monitoring  mechanisms  of  the  impact  of\ndifferent  social  welfare  and  employment  services,  and  thus  allow  for  more  effective  and\nequitable use of social welfare resources as well as improved employment conditions.\n\n27. \nThe development of a comprehensive master plan will benefit the social security sector\nby providing a formal framework for medium-and long-term policy and planning. This will permit\na  shift  from  short-term,  uncoordinated  interventions  to  a  more  effective  system  better  able  to\naddress poverty reduction on a sustainable basis.\n\n28.\n\nEstimated number of beneficiaries of SSSDP are detailed in the following table:\n\nTable A5.1: Investment Project Beneficiaries\n\nComponents\n\nNo. of Beneficiaries\n\nNo. of poor beneficiaries\n\nAssistance \n\nSocial \nWelfare Services\nEmployment Services\nSocial Insurance\nTotal\n\nand\n\n230,000\n\n260,000\n330,000\n820,000\n\n160,000\n\n143,000\n285,000\n588,000\n\nD.\n\nPoverty Impact of Policy Actions under the Program\n\nPercentage of poor\nbeneficiaries\n70\n\n43\n85\n72\n\n29.\nImproving the Quality and Coverage of Social Welfare Services and Benefits. The\nobjective  is  to  be  achieved  by  (i)  rationalizing  the  system  of  social  assistance,  (ii)  developing\ncommunity-based  social  welfare  service  delivery  mechanisms;  (iii)  establishing  a  new\nframework for social work services. Table A5.2 shows the benefits.\n\ni The highest rate of unemployment is among the group age 15 to 24, the first time labor market entrants.\n\n                  \n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 5, page 6\n\nTable A5.2 Benefits of Improving the Welfare Services\n\nChannel\n\nDirect\n\nIndirect\n\nMacro\n\nNon-poor\n\nfor\n\nGreater  coverage\nof \nsocial\nassistance  for  the\npoor\n\nOpportunity for\nImproved \nservices \ngroups  such  as \nelderly and orphans\n\nof\ndelivery \nfor  vulnerable\nthe\n\nBetter use of\navailable resources\n\nLabor\nAccess \nPoor\n\nPrices\nTransfers\n\nCrucial\nAssumptions\nNet Impact\nBrief Narrative\n\nPositive\nThese measures will result in an improvement in the targeting and coverage of social welfare\nassistance.  The levels of current allowances paid are too low to have a substantial impact on\nthe welfare of the poor while a large proportion of the poor are not covered.  Developing\ncommunity- based social service delivery will lower cost and increase quality  and the utilization\nrate by the needy who remain largely unserved.  At the same time, a community based\napproach will help keep social welfare clients in their own community while creating needed\nincome generating opportunities.  Development of a framework is needed to institute the reforms\ndeveloped under the program.\n\n30.\nDeveloping  Pro-Poor  Labor  Market  Policies.  The  objective  is  to  be  achieved  by  (i)\nincreased provision of vocational and skills training programs to the unemployed and poor, and\n(ii) expanded eligibility for employment services to uninsured and unemployed applicants. The\npurpose of this policy area is to expand the provision of vocational and skills training program in\na manner responsive to the needs of the private sector.  Introducing standards for accreditation,\nimproving supervision, and upgrading training programs and teachers protects the students by\nensuring a relevant and quality education is provided. Table A5.3 summarizes the benefits.\n\nTable A5.3 Benefits of Pro-poor Labor Market Policies\n\nChannel\n\nDirect\n\nIndirect\n\nNon-poor\n\nMacro\nSustainable  employment\ncreation \nincreases  GDP\nand tax revenues\nprivate\nEncouraging \nsector \nparticipation\nincreases  the  availability\nof resources for training\n\nLabor\n\nAccess for\nPoor\n\nProvision  of  labor\nregistry \nservices\nand  quality  skills\ntraining \nto\ncurrently  ineligible\nincluding  60,000\nunemployed\nyoung  and  new\nlabor \nmarket\nentrants\n\nPrices\nTransfers\nCrucial\nAssumptions\nNet Impact\n\nUnemployed are poor\n\nPositive\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 5, page 7\n\nBrief Narrative\n\nThese measures promote access to labor registry services and quality post school skills\ntraining enabling young labor market entrants and the unemployed formerly self-employed or\ninformal sector workers to access the labor market. These measures will ensure vocational high\nschool skills training students with skills relevant to the labor market. Encouraging private\nsector participation in the delivery of skills training increases level of resources for skills\ntraining.  The increased pool of skilled workers will support expansion of the private sector\ncurrently hampered by limited availability of skilled workers and will thus promote pro-poor\ngrowth. This in turn will generate revenue through taxes that can be used to fund further\ninvestment in human resources development and social protection.\n\n31.\nStrengthening  Social  Insurance  to  Increase  Compliance.  The  objective  is  to  be\nachieved  by  (i)  improve  institutional  framework  and  organizational  structures  for  Social\nInsurance;  (ii)  clearing  of    arrears  in  contributions  from  state  budget  organizations,  (iii)\nupgrading of the powers of social insurance inspectors to those of tax inspectors, (iv) expanded\nsocial insurance for self-employed and herders. Table A5.4 shows the benefits.\n\nTable A5.4: Benefits of Strengthening Social Insurance\n\nDirect\n\nIndirect\n\nMacro\n\nNon-poor\n\nWorkers pensions\nnot shortchanged\nby under-reporting.\n\nTax collection improves\n\nPensions paid on\ntime.\n\nMore tax revenue available\nfor social expenditures.\n\nWorkers\npensions not\nshortchanged by\nunderreporting.\n\nPositive\nThese  measures  are  important  for  reducing  the  vulnerability  of  pensioners.    Improving  the\norganization of the State Social Insurance General Office, particularly the information systems,\nand amending the powers of social insurance inspectors helps ensure that workers receive the\nlevel  of  pension  to  which  they  are  entitled.    Clearing  up  the  sizable  arrears  of  state  budget\norganizations will improve the financial health of SSIGO reducing delays in payment pensions,\na major source of income for poor households.\n\nDeveloping a Social Security Master Plan. A comprehensive master plan will benefit\n31.\nthe  social  security  sector  greatly  by  providing  a  formal  framework  for  medium-and  long-term\npolicy  and  planning.    This  will  lead  to  improvements  in  services  to  social  welfare  recipients,\nsocial insurance beneficiaries, and recipients of employment services. This will permit the shift\nfrom short-term, uncoordinated interventions to a more effective system better able to address\npoverty reduction on a sustainable basis.

At  present,  Mongolia  relies  on  an  inherited  system  of  institutional  social\nwelfare  services  for  vulnerable  groups.  The  system  is  not  cost  effective,  is  against  traditional\nMongolian regard for the family, and (most important) is not the best way to deal with members of\nvulnerable  groups  in  need  of  assistance.  While  institutionalization  may  be  required  for  a  limited\nnumber  of  people,  community-based  approaches  to  social  welfare  services  will  address  the\nabove  issues.  Although  such  approaches  have  been  implemented  in  Mongolia  in  a  limited\nmanner  they  are  comparatively  new.  They  also  require  adapting  to  the  specific  situation  in\nMongolia  today  and  people  will  need  time  to  adjust  to  them.  They  will  also  require  cooperation\nbetween  local  government  and  civil  society  organizations.  To  gain  greater  understanding  of  the\npossible interventions suitable to Mongolia, to demonstrate the effectiveness of such approaches,\nand  to  support  the  development  of  a  national  strategy  for  community-based  social  service\ndelivery, a development facility for innovations in this area will be incorporated into the project.\n\n2.\nObjective.  This  facility  is  intended  to  support  community-based  social  welfare  service\ninterventions on a pilot basis. It will address issues related to vulnerable groups, including, (i) the\nelderly, (ii) people with disabilities (PWD) (iii) children, and  (iv) single-parent families.\n\n3.\nNature of the Facility. Funding will be provided for implementing innovative approaches\nto  community-based  interventions  for  social  welfare  services.  Proposals  will  be  reviewed  and\napproved by a technical committee appointed by the minister of the Ministry of Social Welfare and\nLabor (MSWL) and chaired by the director of MSWL\u2019s Policy Coordination Department. 1 Awards\nwill be in the form of block grants not normally in excess of $10,000 equivalent; the exact amount\nand phasing of disbursements will depend on the proposal. The amount of each block grant may\nvary, and will be determined by the technical committee.\n\n4.\nCriteria  for  Evaluation  and  Award.  Evaluation  criteria  for  the  proposals  will  include\ntechnical  soundness  of  the  proposed  innovation,  relevance  to  priority,  development  and\nimplementation  costs,  beneficiary  coverage  and  needs,  potential \nreplication,  and\nsustainability.  Special  consideration  will  be  given  to  proponents  who  can  provide  counterpart\nsupport  or  mobilize  community  or  local  government  support.  The  State  Social  Welfare  Agency\n(SSWA)  and  Policy  Coordination  Department  of  the  MSWL  in  consultation  with  the  technical\ncommittee  will  be  responsible  for  developing  and  submitting  the  detailed  criteria  for  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) concurrence, also as a condition of disbursement.\n\nfor \n\nEligible  Participants.  The  facility  may  be  availed  of  by  local  government  agencies,\n5.\nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  groups  or  individuals.  Government  agencies  may  also\navail of the facility for contracting services out to private sector social security service providers.\n\nImplementation Arrangements. The funds for the facility will be disbursed according to\n6.\nguidelines  and  procedures  acceptable  to  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  funds  will  be\nadministered by the project management unit (PMU) under the guidance of SSWA and MSWL\u2019s\nPolicy Coordination Department. Block grants will be disbursed in a phased manner according to\nmonitorable  milestones  or  indicators  that  must  be  elaborated  in  the  proposal.  The  PMU  will\nconduct training workshops for all eligible participants about the availability and operating policies\nand guidelines of the fund. Proposals will be reviewed and approved quarterly. The deadlines for\n\n                                                          \n1\n\nThis  committee  is  envisaged  to  include  representation  from  the  MSWL  and  the  State  Social  Welfare  Agency\n(SSWA). The exact membership and specific terms of reference of the committee will be finalized during project\nimplementation, subject to ADB\u2019s concurrence, as a condition of disbursement.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 8, page 2\n\nsubmitting  proposals  for  each  quarter  will  be  set  by  the  PMU  in  consultation  with  the  technical\ncommittee.\n\n\f\f74\n\nAppendix 10, page 1\n\nBudgetary Implications and Structural Adjustment Costs of Policy Measures\n\nPolicy Measure\n\nShort-Term Budgetary\nImpact\n(1.5 years)\n\nMedium and Long-Term\nBudgetary Impact\n(1.5 years +)\n\n1.

Reflecting  their  communist  origins  in  Mongolia,  social  security  services  remain\nvery much the preserve of the Government, with relatively little participation of civil society or the\nprivate  sector.  In  addition,  the  lack  of  effective  coordination  of  donor  activities  means  that  this\nassistance does not always yield optimal results.\n\n3.\nThere is, therefore, an urgent need for a sector-wide framework for policy and strategy \u2013\nwhich  has  broad  popular  support  -  to  better  guide  programs  of  support  and  to  ensure  that  they\nare in accordance with domestic legislation, policies and priorities.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe TA for Strengthening Policy for Social Security Reform will assist the government in\n4.\nthe development of a comprehensive Social Security Sector Master Plan comprising policies and\nstrategies  designed  to  establish  an  efficient  social  security  sector  appropriate  to  a  market-\noriented  economy.  The  TA  will  help  the  Government,  and  the  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare  and\nLabor (MSWL) in particular, develop a comprehensive framework for the medium and long-term\ndevelopment  of  the  social  security  sector.  It  will  also  render  support  for  mobilization  and\ncoordination of both internal and external resources for financing of the social security sector.\n\nC. \n\nScope\n\nThe TA has four components:\n\n5.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nDevelopment of legislative and policy frameworks for the social security sector, including\nclarification  of  the  role  of  MSWL  and  other  stakeholders  in  the  sector  (attention  will  be\npaid to (a) MSWL\u2019s role policy and strategy and for ensuring standards, and (b) promoting\npublic-private sector partnerships for service delivery);\n\nSupport  for  institutional  organization  of  the  sector  including  reforms  to  MSWL,  its\nregulatory  and  implementing  agencies,  and  other  organizations  within  its  structure  or\nreporting to MSWL.\n\nDevelopment of an overall social security sector strategy (the Master Plan) for 10 years as\nwell as the first rolling three-year plans of action for implementing it.\n\nDevelopment  of  the  following  strategies  and  mechanisms  that  will  feed  into  the  overall\nSocial Security Sector Master Plan (i) social assistance benefit delivery and eligibility (ii)\ncommunity-based social service delivery (iii) community-based social worker system.\n\n\f87\n\n         Appendix 16, page 2\n\nD. \n\nConsultant Requirements\n\n6.\nThe TA will provide a total of 47 person-months of consulting services.

The  TA  will  start  during  the  first  year  of  Project\nimplementation and will be implemented over two phases (4.5 months for the first and 1.5 months\nfor the second).\n\n\f88\n\n         Appendix 16, page 3\n\nTable A16: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan ($\u2019000)\n\nItem\n\nLocal Currency\n\nTotal Costs\n\nA.
