The \nsummary is attached as an appendix. \n \nThe  Project  is  to  (i)  rehabilitate  the  Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf \nroad  (140.3  kilometers  [km])  and  the  Bamian\u2013Yakawlang  road \n(98.9  km),  (ii)  install  cross-border  facilities  in  Spin  Boldak,  (iii) \nsupport campaigns to prevent HIV/AIDS and increase awareness \nof human trafficking; (iv) provide support for project management \nand  monitoring,  and  (v)  provide  project  management  support  to \nthe Ministry of Public Works (MPW).  \n \nSince rehabilitation of roads started after more than two decades \nof  conflict,  the  focus  of  the  road  rehabilitation  program  has  been \nthe reconstruction and completion of the regional highways. Once \nthe  current  or  planned  projects  are  completed  by  2008,  the \nexisting  regional  highway  network  will  be  improved  to  a  two-lane \nbitumen-paved road standard, with certain four-lane sections near \nKabul  and  Kandahar.  In  contrast,  more  than  90%  of  national \nhighways  and  provincial  roads  are  either  earth  or  gravel,  and \nmore  than  60%  are  in  poor  condition.  Many  are  impassable  at \nspecific  locations  such  as  rivers  and  where  severe  erosion  or \nlandslides  have  occurred.  Except  for  newly  constructed  bridges, \nmost bridges and culverts along national highways and provincial \nroads  are  in  bad  condition.  Many  are  in  danger  of  collapse  from \nheavily loaded vehicles or of being washed away.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s next priority is development of the north\u2013south \nand east\u2013west corridors, which connect the ring road horizontally \nand  perpendicularly  and  improves  access  for  people  living  in \nremote areas at the center of the country.  \n \nDuring  the  first  phase  of  road  rehabilitation,  after  resuming  its \noperation  in  Afghanistan  in  2002,  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) gave priority attention to rehabilitation of regional highways, \nparticularly  the  ring  road,  with  emphasis  on  trade  links  to \nneighboring  countries,  including  bridges,  disintegrated  pavement, \ndrainage  erosion  protection,  and  routine  maintenance.  With \nrehabilitation  of  regional  highways  nearing  completion,  ADB  is \nplacing   priority    on   connecting   the   ring   road   through    the \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nnorth\u2013south  corridor  or  the  east\u2013west  corridor  as  recommended \nby  the  road  master  plan  prepared  with  ADB  assistance.  The \nproject  roads  comprise  the  north\u2013south  and  east\u2013west  corridors, \nwhich  connect  the  central  of  the  country  to  the  major  cities  such \nas Mazar-e-Sharif and Kabul, through which the ring road passes. \n \nAfghanistan has made significant progress since the ouster of the \nTaliban regime. The  Government has implemented a wide range \nof  structural  reforms  and  adhered  to  almost  all  quantitative \nindicators  and  structural  benchmarks  under  the  Staff-Monitored \nProgram, led by the International Monetary Fund. Notwithstanding \nthese achievements and sustained economic growth over the last \n2  years,  the  economic  and  fiscal  situation  continues  to  be \nextremely  fragile.  Security,  economic,  social,  and  administrative \nchallenges are formidable. Afghanistan continues to need external \ndevelopment  finance  that  does  not  fiscally  burden  the  nascent \nadministration. To achieve growth  targets over the medium term, \nthe  Government  must  aim  for  broad-based  and  sustainable \ndevelopment and identify new drivers of growth. Investment in the \nroad  sector  is  a  prerequisite  for  sustained  economic  growth,  and \nthe grant will greatly help accelerate this transition.  \n \n \nThe  Project  will  help  the  Government  to  promote  economic  and \nsocial  development,  and  reduce  poverty  by  rehabilitating  the \nnational highway network to connect the central remote regions of \nAfghanistan to the ring road.  \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $140.9 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $1.7 million.  \n \nA  loan  of  $78.2  million  and  a  grant  of  $40.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Fund  resources  will  be  provided.  The  proposed  loan  will \nhave a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, with \nan annual interest rate of 1% per annum. The total amount of the \ninterest  charge  during  the  grace  period  will  be  capitalized  and \ncharged to the loan account. The grant will finance (i) resettlement \ncosts,  (ii)  civil  works  for  the  Bamian\u2013Yakawlang  road,  (iii) \ncampaigns  to  prevent  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking,  and  (iv) \nincremental project management support. The loan will finance (i) \ncivil  works  for  the  Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf  road,  (ii)  cross-\nborder facilities, and (iii) project management and monitoring.  \n \nThe ADB loan and grant totaling $118.2 million will finance 84 % \nof  the  project  cost,  excluding  land  acquisition,  and  taxes  and \nduties  of  $2.7  million,  which  will  be  incurred  by  the  Government. \nThe  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  will  provide  an  additional \ngrant  of  $20  million  to  finance  civil  works  for  the  Bamian\u2013\nYakawlang road.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\n31 December 2010 \n\n \nLoan: 1 July 2007\u250030 June 2017 \nGrant: 30 June 2011 \n \nMinistry of Public Works (MPW ), Ministry of Finance (MOF), and \nMinistry of Public Health (MOPH) \n \nThe  Project  will  be \nthe  existing  Project \nimplemented  by \nManagement Unit, which handles the ongoing ADB road projects. \nMPW  will  assign  a  team  of  two  engineers,  one  land/revenue \nofficer,  and  one  office  administrator  to  the  site  offices  of  the \nproject  management  consultants  so  that  they  can  liaise  with  the \nproject management consultants, contractors, local governments, \nand people in the project areas. MPW staff, stationed in the field, \nwill handle day-to-day project implementation.  \n \nThe  component  of  cross-border  facilities  will  be  implemented  by \nMOF\u2019s Customs Department. The director general of the Customs \nfor  day-to-day  project \nDepartment  will  be \nimplementation. \n \nMOPH will implement the component on HIV/AIDS prevention and \nanti-human trafficking awareness campaign. \n \n \nProcurement  of  goods,  services,  and  civil  works  to  be  financed \nunder the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines.  Civil  works  contracts  will  be  procured \nthrough  international  competitive  bidding.  A  single-stage,  two-\nenvelope  procedure  (without  prequalification)  will  be  used. \nEquipment  for  cross-border  facilities  will  be  procured  by  limited \ninternational  bidding.  All \ninternational  procurement  will  be \nundertaken by the Government procurement unit operating under \nthe Afghanistan Reconstruction and Development Services. \n \n\nresponsible \n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nPeriod of Loan and Grant \nUtilization \n \nExecuting Agencies \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nTwo consultant teams and two individual consultants will be hired \nto  help  MPW,  MOF,  and  MOPH  implement  the  Project.  The \nconsultant  teams  will  (i)  oversee  overall  project  management;  (ii) \nsupervise  construction  and  installation  of  equipment,  including \nreviewing detailed designs prepared by contractors; (iii) supervise \nimplementation of the HIV/AIDS component; (iv) certify completed \nworks by contractors; (v) provide on-the-job training for MPW staff \nassigned  to  the  consultant  team;  and  implement  and  supervise \nthe  training  component  of  the  Project;  and  (vi)  undertake  benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation. The individual consultant will assist (i) \nMPW and the Afghan Reconstruction and Development Services \nin evaluating the technical and financial proposals for supervision \nconsultants, evaluating the proposals for civil works contracts, and \npreparing  final  bid  evaluation  reports;  and  (ii)  the  Customs \nDepartment of MOF in supervising procurement and installation of \ncross-border facilities. All consultants financed from the ADB loan \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nwill  be  selected  and  engaged \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \nThe Project will lead to both direct and indirect poverty reduction \nimpacts.  The  direct  poverty  impact  will  be  on  income  generation \nand  demand  for  unskilled  labor  and  wages  accruing  during \nconstruction of the project road. Other benefits will be lower travel \ntime  and  travel  costs,  and  higher  agricultural  product  profit \nmargins.  \n \nImproved roads will lead to a shift from subsistence agriculture to \nmarket-based  production  enabling  farmers  to  grow  perishable \ncommercial products like vegetables and fruits and transport them \nmore quickly to markets. The farmers in the provinces will be able \nto  diversify  their  cropping  patterns;  cultivate  high-value  crops; \ngrow larger marketable surpluses to improve their income earning \ncapacities;  and  generate  more  agricultural  wage  employment, \nparticularly benefiting the poor. \n \nImproved  road  conditions  will  lead  to  growth  of  affordable \ntransport  facilities  and  thus  the  poor,  especially  women  and \nchildren  will  have  more  reliable,  affordable,  and  timely  access  to \neducational  and  medical  facilities.  Lower  transportation  costs  will \nincrease  mobility  among \nfind  employment \nopportunities  in  other  areas.  Increased  access  to  local  and \nnational markets will lead to growth of local trade and production \nactivities,  and  reduced  prices  of  agricultural  commodities  and \nother products. \n\nthe  poor \n\nto \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions \n\nv\n\nthe \n\nThe benefit of the improved road in terms of reduction of vehicle \noperating  costs  will  not  only  be  transferred  to  the  road  users  but \nwill  decrease  accident  deaths  and  disabilities  that  result  from \nextremely poor road conditions. Thus increased economic activity \nand  easy  access  to  social  services  are  expected  to  significantly \nincrease  household  incomes  and  quality  of  life  thereby  reducing \noverall poverty incidence. \n \nThe  risks  are  related  to  (i)  the  Government\u2019s  continued  weak \nimplementation  capacity, \ntimely  provision  of \nincluding \ncounterpart  personnel;  (ii) \nthe  prevailing  security  situation, \nincluding  a  recent  increase  in  activities  by  antigovernment \nelements; (iii) possible increased trafficking of narcotics along the \nimproved  roads;  and  (iv)  an  increase  in  HIV/AIDS  transmission \nand/or human trafficking as a result of improved road connectivity \nand increased movement of people.  \n \nThese  risks  will  be  mitigated  to  the  greatest  extent  possible \nthrough (i) allocation of resources under the Project for consulting \nservices to facilitate project management and implementation, as \nwell  as  continued  technical  assistance  to  MPW;  (ii)  continued \nclose  monitoring  and  coordination  with \nlocal  and  central \nauthorities,  United  Nations  agencies,  and  International  Security \nAssistance  Force  and  coalition  military  establishments  to  ensure \n(iii) \nadequate  exchange  of \nimprovement of border procedures to contain narcotics trafficking; \nand  (iv)  development  of  mitigating  measures  by  the  project \ncomponent for the HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-human trafficking \nawareness campaign.  \n \n \n  \n\nsecurity-related \n\ninformation; \n\nThe views expressed herein are

 for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan,  (ii)  a  proposed  grant,  and  (iii)  proposed  administration  of  a  grant  to  be  provided  by  the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction, in each case to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the \nNorth\u2013South Corridor Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \nA. \n \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nRoad Infrastructure \n\n \n2. \nAfghanistan  is  a  landlocked  country.  With  a  large  area  (about  652,000  square \nkilometers)  and  an  estimated  population  of  22.8  million  widely  spread  across  the  largely \nmountainous  terrain,  roads  are  the  principal  means  of  transport.  The  road  network  comprises \nabout 3,300 kilometers (km) of regional highways, 4,900 km of national highways, 9,700 km of \nprovincial roads, 17,000\u201323,000 km of rural roads, and about 3,000 km of urban roads including \n1,060  km  in  Kabul.  Regional  highways  (comprising  the  2,300  km  ring  road  that  connects \nAfghanistan\u2019s  major  regional  centers  [Herat,  Kandahar,  Mazar-e-Sharif,  Maymaneh,  and \nSheberghan]  with  Kabul,  and  the  roads  linking  to  neighboring  countries)  foster  regional  trade \nand economic linkages between Afghanistan and neighboring countries such as Iran, Pakistan, \nTajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan.  National  highways  extend  regional  highways  to \nprovincial  capitals  contributing  to  economic  growth  and  national  integration.  Provincial  roads \nimprove  the  administrative,  trade,  and  economic  contacts  between  district  headquarters  and \nrespective  provincial  capitals,  and  between  important  district  headquarters;  while  rural  roads \nbring remote areas into commercial contact with markets.  \n \nSince  rehabilitation  of  roads  started  after  more  than  two  decades  of  conflict,  the  road \n3. \nrehabilitation  program  has  focused  on  reconstruction  and  completion  of  regional  highways. \nOnce  the  current  or  planned  projects  are  completed  by  2008,  the  existing  regional  highway \nnetwork  will  be  improved  to  a  two-lane  bitumen-paved  road  standard,  with  certain  four-lane \nsections  near  Kabul  and  Kandahar.  In  contrast,  more  than  90%  of  national  highways  and \nprovincial  roads  are  either  earth  or  gravel,  and  over  60%  are  in  poor  condition.  Many  are \nimpassable  at  specific  locations  such  as  rivers  and  where  severe  erosion  or  landslides  have \noccurred.  Except  for  newly  constructed  bridges,  most  bridges  and  culverts  along  national \nhighways  and  provincial  roads  are  in  poor  condition.  Many  are  in  danger  of  collapse  from \nheavily loaded vehicles or of being washed away.  \n \n\n2. \n\nRoad Transport Service \n\n \n4. \nThe number of vehicles has increased significantly over the past 2 years. According to \nstatistics  provided  in  a  recent  International  Monetary  Fund  country  report  on  Afghanistan, \ntransport of goods by road increased from 1.9 million tons in 2000, to 3.7 million tons in 2001 \nand  5  million  tons  in  2002,  representing  an  almost  fourfold  increase.  The  number  of  taxicabs \nnearly  doubled  from  17,000  in  2000  to  33,500  in  2002.  More  than  147,000  vehicles  are \nestimated to be registered in Kabul. Most vehicles are owned and operated by the private sector \nas the Ministry of Transport-operated fleet has been severely depleted.  \n \n5. \nThe  Afghan  private  sector  has  historically  played  a  dominant  role  in  trucking  and  has \nmaintained its presence, including individuals and firms that relocated in Pakistan during the war \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nyears.  Long  distance  public  transport,  linking  major  cities  and  neighboring  countries,  which \ndeteriorated due to road and vehicle conditions as well as suppressed demand for road travel, \nhas  been  regaining  its  role.  However,  security  remains  a  key  impediment  for  its  full-scale \nrestoration of operations.  \n \n6. \nUrban  transport,  once  dominated  by  the  public  sector,  is  now  mostly  provided  by \nprivately owned buses, taxis, and minivans, but with little regulation. It is constrained by lack of \ntransport capacity; congestion, pollution; lack of accessibility; inadequate route coverage; poor \nroad condition; and lack of depots, stops, and terminals as well as designated road space. The \nurban  transport  system  needs  integrated  planning.  Vehicle  fleet  support  services  are  mostly \nprivately  provided,  with  government  workshops  operating  poorly,  including  those  at  border \npoints.  Forms  of  regional  transport  depend  on  the  state  of  the  roads  and  the  availability  of \nvehicles.  People  and  goods  move  together,  blurring  distinction  between  passenger  and \ncommercial  freight  traffic.  Private  agencies  operate  provincial  and  district  routes.  Some  165 \nregistered  long-distance  private  bus  companies  are  estimated  to  be  operating\u2014101  based  in \nKabul, 64 in the provinces\u2014with a total of 14,007 buses, mostly old minibuses and vans. \n \n\n3. \n\nRoad Sector Management \n\n \n7. \nThe  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (MPW)  is  responsible  for  development,  operation,  and \nmaintenance of regional highways, national highways, and provincial roads in the country. It had \na  large  engineering  organization  with  staff  stationed  in  every  major  provincial  capital  carrying \nout  work  through  force  account.  Over  the  course  of  the  conflict,  MPW  lost  most  of  its  trained \nstaff.  The  current  staff  of  2,900  require  substantial  skill  enhancement  to  perform  their  duties. \nThe  Ministry  of  Rehabilitation  and  Rural  Development  is  responsible  for  development  of  rural \ninfrastructure,  including  rural  roads.  Municipalities  are  responsible  for  the  construction  and \nmaintenance of urban roads. \n \nThe Ministry of Transport regulates the private sector transport industry. With a current \n8. \nstaffing level of 1,180, the ministry\u2019s primary function now is coordinating agreements between \nprivate sector and international transporters, and establishing offices in neighboring countries to \nfacilitate  international  trade.  The  ministry\u2019s  private  sector  department  sets  technical  standards \nfor  private  commercial  vehicles  and  inspects  them  for  compliance  during  the  licensing  and \nrenewal process. It collects a fee of 5% per carriage contract from private trucks and 3% per trip \nfrom interprovincial private buses, based on authorized charge rates. These fees are collected \nat national or provincial borders or the outskirts of major cities.  \n \n9. \n \nB. \n \n\nAppendix 2 presents an analysis of the road sector.  \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nGovernment Strategy for Road Sector Development  \n\n \n10. \nThe  Government  has  identified  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  the  road  system, \nespecially of regional highways, as the country\u2019s top priority in reconstruction. Since 2002, with \nexternal assistance, the Government has been making massive efforts to reestablish the road \nnetwork,  particularly  for  regional  highways,  to  facilitate  provision  of  basic  social  services  to \nremote  provinces,  to  provide  security,  and  to  involve  all  the  population  in  undertaking  nation-\nbuilding  activities.  Afghanistan  is  receiving  extensive  assistance  from  the  international  aid \ncommunity  to  reconstruct  and  develop  the  road  network.  For  regional  highways,  almost  $1.2 \nbillion  has  been  provided  or  committed  to  rehabilitate  3,100  km  of  roads.  These  rehabilitation \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nworks will be completed by 2008. For national highways, about $270 million has been provided \nto  reconstruct  and  improve  1,200  km  of  roads.  These  commitments  are  mainly  to  rehabilitate \ndamaged roads. \n \nAnticipating the work on regional highways to be completed by 2008, the Government\u2019s \n11. \nnext priority is development of the north\u2013south and east\u2013west corridors, which connect the ring \nroad horizontally and perpendicularly and provide better access to people living in remote areas \nin  the  center  of  the  country.  The  Government  is  preparing  the  priority  road  development \nprogram for the next 10 years (2006\u20132015) in line with the recommendation of the road master \nplan  being  prepared  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance.1 The  least-cost  option \nrecommended by the road master plan envisages (i) upgrading 281 km of high-traffic regional \nhighways  to  4  lanes,  (ii)  improving  2,700  km  of  high  priority  national  highways,  and  (iii) \nimproving  5,000  km  of  high  priority  provincial  roads.  The  required  road  expenditure  to \nimplement  the  recommended  option  is  $1.7  billion,  excluding  ongoing  projects  with  financing \nresources secured.  \n \n\n2. \n\nADB\u2019s Strategy \n\n \n12. \nADB  places  its  first  priority  on  rehabilitating  the  road  system,  which  is  critical  for  a \nlandlocked country. According to the Initial Country Strategy and Program (2002\u20132004),2 roads \nare needed to rebuild the economy  by establishing major economic linkages domestically and \nwith  neighboring  countries.  The  strategic  direction  for  the  rehabilitation,  reconstruction,  and \ndevelopment of the road sector comprises (i) policy and institutional development; (ii) capacity \nbuilding;  (iii)  private  sector  development;  (iv)  employment  generation;  (v)  community \nparticipation; (vi) decentralization of network management; (vii) sustainable sector financing and \ncost  recovery;  (viii)  protection  and  preservation  of  the  environment;  (ix)  avoidance  and \nmitigation  of  resettlement;  and  (x)  involvement  of  returnee  refugees,  ex-combatants,  women, \nand the nongovernment organization (NGO) community in road construction and maintenance.  \n \n13. \nDuring the first phase of road rehabilitation, after resuming its operation in Afghanistan in \n2002, ADB gave priority attention to rehabilitating regional highways, particularly the ring road, \nwith  emphasis  on  trade  links  to  neighboring  countries,  including  bridges,  disintegrated \npavement,  drainage  erosion  protection,  and  routine  maintenance.  As  rehabilitation  of  regional \nhighways  is  completed,  ADB  is  focusing  on  connecting  the  ring  road  through  the  north\u2013south \nand east\u2013west corridors as recommended by the road master plan (para. 11). This is also in line \nwith the Government\u2019s priority investment projects identified for the national transport program. \nAccordingly, the Project is included in the Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008).3  \n \n\n3. \n\nExternal Assistance and Aid Coordination \n\n \nThe  ring  road  is  being  rehabilitated  with  financial  and  technical  assistance  (TA)  from \n14. \nbilateral  and  multilateral  funding  agencies.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment  (USAID)  and  Japanese  government  provided  support  for  rehabilitation  of  the \nKabul\u2013Kandahar  road.  USAID,  and  the  Japanese  and  Saudi  Arabian  governments  provided \nfinancing  for  rehabilitating  the  Kandahar\u2013Herat  road.  The  World  Bank  and  the  Islamic \nDevelopment  Bank  provided  support  for  rehabilitation  of  the  Kabul\u2013Doshi-Pul-e  Khumri  road, \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2004.

ADB\u2019s  Emergency \n\nInfrastructure  Rehabilitation  and \nincluding  repair  of  Salang \nReconstruction Project4 finances rehabilitation of the road from Pul-e Khumri via Mazar-e-Sharif \nto  Andkhuouy.  For  the  Herat\u2013Andkhuouy  section,  Iran  provided  support  for  the  Herat\u2013Armalik \nroad, while ADB provided support for the Ankhoy\u2013Bala Murghab road. The remaining 183 km of \nthe  Armalik\u2013Bala  Murghab  road  will  be  rehabilitated  by  support  from  Saudi  Arabia  and  the \nIslamic Development Bank.  \n \n15. \nIn 2004, ADB provided TA (footnote 7) for preparation of a road master plan, for a road \ndevelopment program for the next 5\u201310 years. The program is to promote efficient and effective \nroad rehabilitation focusing on identifying major east\u2013west and north\u2013south corridors to cross-\nlink  the  ring  road.  The  TA  will  also  assess  financing  requirements  for  sustainable  road \nmaintenance, and propose desirable and sustainable financing mechanisms. ADB\u2019s next phase \nassistance for road rehabilitation will be based on the road development program. Appendix 3 \nprovides a summary of external assistance provided for the road sector. \n \n\n4. \n\nRoad Maintenance \n\n \n16. \nRoutine  road  maintenance  expenditures  are  projected  to  increase  steadily  as  road \nprojects are completed: from $8 million in 2006 to $25 million in 2015. Periodic maintenance will \nnot be required until 2010, when expenditures will increase significantly to about $45 million per \nyear  from  2011  to  2015  when  the  regional  and  national  highway  projects  currently  under \nconstruction will require their first periodic maintenance.  \n \n17. \nThe  most  immediate  maintenance  requirement  is  for  special  maintenance  works  on \nnational highways and provincial roads of which maintenance has long been delayed, beginning \nwith  an  estimated  $26  million  in  2006  and  gradually  decreasing  to  $14  million  in  2015  as  the \nbacklog of work is eliminated. During 2006\u20132015, the need for special works will decrease while \nthe  need  for  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  will  increase,  approximately  balancing  each \nother.  During  2006\u20132010  the  average  annual  requirement  for  routine,  periodic,  and  backlog \nmaintenance ranges from $34 million to $47 million; this will increase to $87 million for 2011\u2013\n2015 because of the significant increase of periodic maintenance. \n \nThe expected road revenue falls far short of the required road maintenance expenditure. \n18. \nThe  main  source  of  road  revenue,  road  tolls  which  the  Government  will  reinstate  for \nrehabilitated regional highways, is expected to generate $13 million\u2013$23 million for 2006\u20132015 \non  the  basis  of  the  toll rate  of  $0.005  per  passenger  car  equivalent  per  km.  Even  considering \nvehicle registration fees currently collected and expected to generate $3 million\u2013$6 million per \nyear during 2006\u20132015, the expected road revenue will be able to finance about 30%\u201350% of \nthe road maintenance requirement.  \n \nTo relieve the shortfall of road revenue, the Government will evaluate other sustainable \n19. \nmethods for revenue generation such as setting up a dedicated road maintenance fund based \non  fuel  levies,  vehicle  licensing,  and  other  road-user  related  taxes;  and  will  complete  this \nevaluation by December 2007. At present, fuel prices in Afghanistan rank among the lowest in \nthe region (about $0.5 per liter) with no tax levied except customs duty of 9%. Taxes on fuel in \nother  countries  range  from  13%  to  70%.  Based  on  fuel  usage  and  estimated  number  of \nvehicles,  the  total  amount  of  fuel  used  for  road  transport  is  estimated  at  582  million  liters  per \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB.  2003.

If a \n10%\u201315%  fuel  tax  is  introduced,  it  will  generate  $29  million\u2013$48  million  of  additional  road \nrevenue, which will be sufficient to cover the shortfall of current road revenue. The development \npartners\u2019  local  consultative  group,  comprising  major  financiers  such  as  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational Cooperation, USAID, and World Bank, considers introduction of fuel tax as a key \nagenda  item  for  policy  dialogue  and  will  continue  its  dialogue  with  the  Government  to  secure \nstable financing sources for sustainable road maintenance. \n \n\n5. \n\nCapacity Development  \n\n \n20. \nUpon  resuming  its  operation  in  Afghanistan  in  2002,  ADB  focused  its  efforts  on \nstrengthening  the  capacity  of  MPW  to  implement  aid-assisted  projects.  ADB  has  taken  the \napproach of assigning a team of international and domestic experts to MPW to compensate for \nMPW\u2019s  lack  of  capacity  to  implement  large-scale  projects,  and  provide  on-the-job  training  for \nMPW  staff.  Under  the  ongoing  TA  cluster  for  Capacity  Building  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment,5 ADB is providing such assistance for MPW to strengthen its capacity to plan and \nmanage projects. Under the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project \nand  the  Andkhuouy\u2013Qaisar  Road  Project,  the  Project  Implementation  Unit  established  within \nMPW is gradually building capacity to handle day-to-day project implementation with the aid of \nproject management consultants. Several MPW staff have been attached to the contractor and \nthe  supervision  consultants  to  receive  on-the-job  training  in  project  administration  and \nimplementation.  \n \n21. \nAlthough  this  arrangement  of  capacity  strengthening  worked  well  and  contributed  to \nbuilding  MPW\u2019s  capacity  for  project  management,  it  focused  on  immediate  needs  for  project \nimplementation  with  little  regard  to  long-term  sustainability  of  these  efforts.  Building  basic \ncapacity immediately after the civil strife and conflict might justify various piecemeal measures \nto  quickly  attend  to  urgent  requirements.  However,  as  MPW\u2019s  operation  is  normalized  with  its \nattention shifting to long-term planning and quality control of road works from quick rehabilitation \nof  damaged  roads,  the  paradigm  for  capacity  building  of  MPW  needs  to  be  changed  from \nmeeting immediate needs to establishing a sustainable arrangement that is self-sufficient, with a \nminimum of external support.  \n \n22. \nADB\u2019s  capacity  building  assistance  is  now  designed  to  set  up  a  self-sustainable \nmechanism in strengthening MPW\u2019s capacity for road sector management. Under the 2005 TA \nfor  Capacity  Building  for  Road  Sector  Institutions6 and  2006 Road  Rehabilitation  and  Capacity \nBuilding Cluster,7 international and domestic consultants will be assigned to MPW and lead the \ndevelopment  of  sustainable  and  self-sufficient  capacity  building  mechanisms  by  twinning  key \nplayers  including  the  local  construction  industry  and  Kabul  Polytechnic  University.  The  TA  will \nassist  the  twinned  group  by  strengthening  the  curricula  of  Kabul  Polytechnic  University, \nparticularly for project management and procurement, road database management, and quality \ncontrol  of  road  works,  to  have  a  stable  supply  of  qualified engineers. The  TA  will  also  involve \nfaculty members of Kabul Polytechnic University to develop and provide retraining courses for \nMPW  staff  and  engineers  in  the  local  construction  industry,  and  design  exchange  programs \nbetween MPW and the local construction industry.  \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB.  2002.

The capacity building TA being prepared by the World Bank will \nassist  MPW\u2019s  restructuring  by  assigning  four  international  consultants  to  the  capacity  building \nunit in MPW for 3 years to support MPW\u2019s restructuring initiatives. In particular, the consultants \nwill assist MPW in applying and obtaining the priority reform and restructuring status in line with \nthe  Government\u2019s  priority  reform  and  restructuring 8  scheme.  USAID  provided  an  extensive \ntraining  program  for  MPW  staff  through  the  United  Nations  Office  of  Project  Service  covering \nquality assurance and quality control; road operation and maintenance; planning, administration, \nand financing of road construction; contract management; and computer and English skills. The \nprogram  will  continue  to  2007.  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  focuses  on  capacity \nbuilding of MPW middle management and senior engineers in the area of road maintenance. \n \n\n6. \n\nSubregional Cooperation for Transport Corridor Development \n\n \n24. \nAfghanistan\u2019s  efforts  to  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  its  shattered  road  network  have \ndrawn much attention from its neighboring countries. An improved road network in Afghanistan \nwill  result  in  an  improved  transport  network  in  the  subregion.  Landlocked  Central  Asian \nrepublics  are  showing  great  interest  in  establishing  transport  corridors  through  Afghanistan  to \nwarm-water ports on the Arabian Sea and Gulf. Iran and Pakistan are rapidly developing their \nports and improving roads connecting to the ports in expectation of increased import/export and \ntransit  shipment  of  goods  through  their  ports.  In  2005,  Afghanistan  joined  the  South  Asia \nAssociation  for  Regional  Cooperation  and  decided  to  participate  in  the  Central  Asia  Regional \nEconomic  Cooperation  program  led  by  ADB.  Afghanistan\u2019s  role  as  a  land  bridge  to  link  two \nsubregions,  South  Asia  and  Central  Asia,  becomes  more  critical  with  Afghanistan\u2019s  active \nparticipation in regional cooperation initiatives. \n \n25. \nADB  has  been  actively  involved  in  this  subregional  initiative  to  develop  effective \ntransport  corridors.  Under  the  TA  cluster  (footnote  5),  ADB  provided  assistance  to  develop  a \nframework  and  legislation  to  facilitate  cross-border  trade.  This  evolved  into  the  initiative  to \nestablish the Central and South Asia Transport and Trade Forum9 in 2003 as an instrument for \nsubregional  cooperation  supported  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners.  It  seeks  to \nencourage  opportunities  for  increasing  investment,  income,  and  employment  in  Central  and \nSouth  Asia  through  greater  transport  connectivity  and  expanded  subregional  and  interregional \ntrade. Under the TA for Cross-Border Trade and Transport Facilitation approved in 2004,10 ADB \nassists Afghanistan in developing an instrument to facilitate the smooth transportation of goods \nacross the corridors linking Afghanistan with neighboring countries.  \n \n\n7. \n\nSecurity Situation \n\n \n26. \nPoor security remains a key constraint to Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction and development. \nWithout improved security, the country will fail to achieve key national goals for private sector-\nled  economic  growth,  national  reconciliation,  and  social  development.  Despite  the  continued \npresence of the International Security Assistance Force and United States-led coalition troops, \n\n                                                 \n8  Priority  reform  and  restructuring  is  an  institutional  reform  scheme  based  on  the  Presidential  Decree  on  Priority \nReform  and  Restructuring  within  Ministries  and  Government  Agencies  issued  on  12  July  2003.  The  intent  of  the \nscheme  is  to  promote  the  reform  and  restructuring  of  ministries  and  Government  agencies.  Once  ministries  and \nGovernment  agencies  obtain  policy  reform  and  restructuring  status,  employees  who  fill  new  posts  under  the \nrestructured organization are compensated with additional salary in the form of an interim additional allowance.  \n9   The  Central  and  South  Asia  Transport  and  Trade  Forum  comprises  Afghanistan,  Pakistan,  Tajikistan, \n\nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, with Iran as an observer.  \n\n10  ADB. 2004. Afghanistan: Cross-Border Trade and Transport Facilitation. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nas  well  as  ongoing  efforts  by  the  international  community  to  train  and  strengthen  the  Afghan \nnational army, incidents involving antigovernment elements have increased over the past year. \nIn addition, the problem of poor security has spread to an increased number of provinces.  \n \nDespite a disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration program aimed at reducing the \n27. \nnumber  and  size  of  illegal  armed  groups,  in  some  parts  of  the  country  regional  warlords  and \nmid-level  commanders  have  retained  significant  military  strength  as  well  as  political  influence. \nAs such, full political normalization has not yet been achieved.  \n \n28. \nContinued insecurity may adversely affect project implementation through disruptions or \ndelays  in  construction  work,  including  the  timely  provision  of  raw  materials.  Poor  security \nconditions  also  may  constrain  effective  supervision  of  construction  work  by  consultants  and \nADB  staff.  However,  the  project  area  is  relatively  unpopulated  and  generally  has  not  been \naffected by problems of insecurity.  \n \n29. \nAs  with  ADB\u2019s  earlier  road  projects,  efforts  will  be  made  to  win  the  support  of \ncommunities near the construction site through consultations with local government officials and \nvillage  leaders.  ADB  also  has  an  ongoing  security  TA11 that  is  helping  provide  a  safe  work \nenvironment for on-site personnel assigned by contractors and consulting firms.  \n \n\n8. \n\nOpium-Related Problems \n\n \n30. \nPoppy  cultivation  and  downstream  narcotics  production  and  trade  constitute  a  major \nthreat to Afghanistan\u2019s security and stability as the trade in opium, including opium debt, ties the \npoor rural population to regional warlords and international crime syndicates. Afghanistan\u2019s drug \neconomy continues to represent nearly half of the country\u2019s total licit economy. As such, control \nand  eradication  of  opium  poppy  production  and  narcotics  trafficking  represents  a  huge \nchallenge to Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction and development.  \n \n31. \nAfghanistan  is  the  world\u2019s  largest  producer  of  illicit  opium,  comprising  87%  of  world \nproduction, or some 4,200 metric tons. Narcotics also constitute the largest sector of the Afghan \neconomy; valued at $2.8 billion, the opium economy equaled some 60% of the country\u2019s 2003 \ngross domestic product ($4.6 billion, if only licit activity is measured). Opium is a major source of \ncash income for farmers because of the high profitability of opium poppy compared with other \nagricultural crops, as well as the lack of livelihood alternatives in rural areas. In 2005, more than \n2  million  Afghans,  or  nearly  10%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  population  were  estimated  to  be \nsomehow engaged in the production of opium.  \n \n32. \nThe  Government\u2019s  overall  antinarcotics  strategy  is  to  eliminate  the  production, \nconsumption,  and  trafficking  of  illicit  drugs  into,  within,  and  from  Afghanistan,  focusing  on  the \nprovision of alternative livelihoods for Afghan poppy farmers, extension of drug law enforcement \nthroughout  Afghanistan,  implementation  of  drug  control  legislation,  establishment  of  effective \ninstitutions,  and \nfor  addicts.  The \ndevelopment partners are contributing to the Government\u2019s antinarcotics efforts with a focus on \nalternative  livelihoods,  including  rural  credit  to  address  problems  of  opium  debt,  as  well  as \nsupport  for  improved  law  enforcement  and  interdiction  and  legal  and  judicial  reform.  The \ndevelopment  partners  are  also  attempting  to  mainstream  the  antinarcotics  agenda  into  other \ndevelopment activities.  \n\nintroduction  of  prevention  and \n\ntreatment  programs \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Security of ADB-Financed Projects \n\nin Afghanistan. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nAs a key objective of counternarcotics activities is to build stability and the rule of law in \n33. \nAfghanistan, the success of such efforts will not only reduce the amount of opium poppy grown \nby Afghan farmers, but curtail the flow of income and accumulation of wealth by traffickers and \ncorrupt  Government  officials,  while  at  the  same  time  promote  growth  of  the  country\u2019s  legal \neconomy through alternative livelihoods, employment creation, market diversification, etc. ADB \nsupports the antinarcotics agenda by focusing on helping farm households develop sustainable \nalternatives  to  opium  poppy  cultivation.  ADB  activities  in  this  regard  include  rehabilitating \nirrigation systems and improving water resources management, as well as helping to create an \nenabling  environment  for  the  commercialization  and  diversification  of  agricultural  production. \nADB  recently  completed  a  review  of  its  activities  in  Afghanistan,  including  its  support  to \ntransport, through an antinarcotics perspective. The results of this review will be incorporated in \nADB\u2019s new country strategy and program, and future programming.  \n \n34. \nAlthough irregular border crossings currently are preferred for illegal trafficking, as formal \nborder  crossings  improve  and  volumes  of  cargo  and  passengers  increase,  the  volume  of \nnarcotics  trafficked  by  way  of  formal  border  crossings  and  through  the  main  roads  is  likely  to \nincrease. While the project area is not a main opium-producing region, the link provided by the \nnorth\u2013south  corridor  may  facilitate  trafficking  in  narcotics  as  well  as  humans.  Thus  training  of \npolice and customs officers is needed as well as improved interdiction methods, as highlighted \nby an ADB-commissioned report on cross-border law enforcement.12 \n \n\n9. \n\nHIV/AIDS13 Prevention Strategy \n\n \n35. \nHIV/AIDS  prevalence,  as  reported  by  the  Ministry  of  Public  Health  (MOPH),  is  51  HIV \ncases and 4 AIDS deaths (as of 2006), although many  more cases in the country\u2019s 22 million \npopulation  could  go  undetected  and  unreported.  The  National  HIV/AIDS/STI  (sexually \ntransmitted infection) Control Program, adopted in July 2003, is currently being revised and the \nfirst  draft  of  the  National  Strategic  Plan  of  HIV/AIDS/STI  Control  (2006\u20132010)  has  been \nprepared in consultation with different development partners working in the sector. The strategic \nplan prepared by MOPH outlines the priority areas of intervention: (i) surveillance and research; \n(ii) prevention of HIV/AIDS through an information, education, and communication program for \nhigh-risk groups and the general population; (iii) prevention and management of STIs; (iv) blood \nsafety;  and  (v)  voluntary  counselling  and  testing,  care,  treatment,  and  support.  MOPH  is \nplanning to conduct surveillance surveys and social mapping to identify the behavioral patterns \nof  high-risk  groups.  MOPH  together  with  the  Ministry  of  Religious  Affairs  and  support  from \ndevelopment  partners  (United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  and  United  Nations  Population  Fund), \norganized the Religious Leaders National Consultative Conference on HIV/AIDS in July 2004, in \nwhich the role of the religious leaders on raising awareness of HIV/AIDS and STIs was identified \nand an action plan prepared. Understanding the sociocultural and economic factors and power \nrelations  between  men  and  women,  among  men,  and  among  women  is  essential  for \nunderstanding the behavioral underpinnings of the spread of HIV/AIDS.  \n \n36. \nThe  Government,  with  support  from  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund,  will  develop  an \nevidence-based  communication  strategy  on  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  control  by  March  2007, \nframework,  appropriate \nbased  on \ncommunications  materials,  pretesting,  finalization  of  materials  based  on  the  pretesting,  and \n\nresearch,  development  of  a  strategic \n\nformative \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB.  2004.

From experience with project \nimplementation in Afghanistan, lessons include (i) procurement actions need to be taken far in \nadvance  to  expedite  implementation,  and  (ii)  recruitment  of  consultants  should  be  expedited. \nThese  lessons  of  experience  are  fully  incorporated  in  the  project  design,  and  in  particular, \nprocurement actions will proceed in parallel with project processing to avoid any start-up delay \nof project implementation. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n38. \nThe  Project  will  help  the  Government  promote  economic  and  social  development  and \nreduce poverty by rehabilitating the national highway network, which will connect remote areas \nin  central  Afghanistan  to  the  ring  road.  The  project  roads  pass  through  Balkh,  Bamian,  and \nSamangan  provinces,  which  are  located  at  the  center  of  the  country  and  characterized  by \nmountainous terrain with altitudes up to 3,500 meters (m). The population of these provinces is \nabout 1.7 million, comprising 8.4% of the total Afghanistan population. Rural farmers make up \nabout  90%  of  the  population;  the  urban  population  comprising  the  remaining  10%  is \nconcentrated  in  large  cities  such  as  Bamian  and  Mazar-e-Sharif.  In  Bamian  and  Dara-i-Suf, \nproduction of coal reserves and iron ore deposits will lead to growth of the mining industry in the \nregion, decreasing dependence on agriculture.  \n \nB. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nRehabilitation of the North\u2013South National Highways \n\n \n39. \nThe Project will finance rehabilitation of the Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf road (140.3 km) \nand  the  Bamian\u2013Yakawlang  road  (98.9  km),  which  comprise  the  north\u2013south  corridor \nconnecting the ring road through central Afghanistan. The Project will improve the project road \nto  a  two-lane  asphalt-paved  standard  that  will  allow  smooth  passage  of  heavy  vehicles.  The \ntypical  cross  section  suggested  for  flat  and  rolling  terrains  is  3.50  m  wide,  with  two  granular \nshoulders of 1.5 m and two verges of 0.5 m, with a total width of 11.0 m. In mountainous terrain, \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nto  reduce  the  construction  cost  because  of  slower  traffic  speeds,  the  typical  cross  section \nsuggested is reduced to 9.0 m, by reducing the width of the carriage way to 3.0 m and width of \nthe  shoulder  to  1.0  m.  In  exceptional  cases  where  the  alignment  passes  through  unavoidable \nconstrained areas such as religious structures, confined river sides, reducing the carriage and \nshoulder width to 6.0 m and 0.50 m is recommended. The current condition of the project road \nand proposed design standards are in Appendix 5. \n \n40. \nRoad safety measures will be incorporated in the construction design, which will include \nsafety barriers to separate pedestrians from vehicles, marker posts for vehicles to recognize the \nroad at night, and signage to indicate road blind spots, potential accident areas, or proximity to \npublic  community  buildings  such  as  schools.  In  areas  where  alignments  provide  little  space \nbetween housing structures and the road, barriers and underground or bridge walkways will be \nconsidered.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProvision of Cross-Border Facilities \n\n \nThe Project will finance installation of cross-border customs facilities including gamma-\n41. \nray scanner, computers with internet connection, solar panel, and other office equipment in the \nborder  point  of  Spin  Boldak  where  ADB\u2019s  previous  road  project  helped  with  rehabilitation  and \nprovision of border access roads.  \n \n\n3. \n\nHIV/AIDS Prevention and Anti-Human Trafficking Awareness Campaign \n\n \n42. \nThe  Project  recognizes  the  importance  of  preventing  HIV/AIDS  as  a  crosscutting \ndevelopment  issue,  which  is  linked  to  and  exacerbated  by  the  human  trafficking  issue.  The \nprogram to combat trafficking will help mitigate the spread of HIV/AIDS, and hence is included in \nthe  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  human  trafficking  awareness  campaign.  The  Project  will  support \nimplementation  of  an  evidence-based  communication  strategy  on  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and \ncontrol in Afghanistan that will be developed by MOPH with the assistance of the United Nations \nChildren\u2019s  Fund.  The  activities  under  this  component  include  (i)  support  to  MOPH  to  develop \nMPW  capacity  to  work  with  the  National  HIV/AIDS/STI  Control  Program  in  developing  a \nconcerted approach to HIV/AIDS prevention and transmission in transportation and related road \nconstruction;  (ii)  capacity  development  of  local  NGOs  to  increase  outreach  and  impact  of \nHIV/AIDS  prevention,  trafficking,  and  regulation  of  migration  in  the  project  area;  and  (iii) \nawareness  and  prevention  initiatives  to  target  high-risk  groups  including  injecting  drug  users \nand commercial sex workers, young people and adolescents, contractors, construction workers, \nand communities along the corridor of influence. Briefing sessions for imams and mullahs will be \nprovided  in  the  districts,  and  for  opinion  leaders  and  community  leaders  in  villages  and \ncommunities. Religious leaders\u2019 role in increasing community awareness of HIV prevention will \nbe  enhanced.  Gender-relevant  aspects  of  HIV/AIDS  prevention,  such  as  counseling  for \nadolescent  girls  and  women,  and  the  prevention  of  parent-to-child  transmission,  will  be \nsupported. Details of cost and implementation arrangements are in Appendix 4. \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Management and Monitoring \n\n \n43. \nTwo consultant teams and two individual consultants will be hired to help MPW, MOPH, \nand  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  implement  the  Project.  The  consultant  teams  will  closely \ncoordinate  with  the  Project  Management  Unit  (PMU)  established  under  MPW  and  be \nresponsible  for  (i)  overseeing  overall  project  management;  (ii)  supervising  construction  and \ninstallation  of  equipment,  including  reviewing  detailed  designs  prepared  by  contractors;  (iii) \nsupervising  implementation  of  the  HIV/AIDS  component;  (iv)  certifying  completed  works  by \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\ncontractors; (v) providing on-the-job training for MPW staff assigned to the consultant team, and \nimplementing and supervising the training component of the Project; and (vi) undertaking project \nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  individual  consultant  will  assist  MPW  and  the \nAfghan  Reconstruction  and  Development  Services  in  evaluating  the  technical  and  financial \nproposals  for  supervision  consultants,  evaluating  the  proposals  for  civil  works  contracts,  and \npreparing final bid evaluation reports. The consultant will also help the Customs Department in \nMOF  to  supervise  procurement  and  installation  of  cross-border  facilities.  The  outline  terms  of \nreference  for  supervision  consulting  services  and  the  individual  consultant  are  provided  in \nsupplementary appendixes A and B. \n \n\n5. \n\nIncremental Project Management Support \n\nADF IX Grant Component \n\n \nThe  Project  will  finance  the  engagement  of  external  auditors  to  audit  project  accounts \n44. \nand  the  payment  of  additional  salary  to  MPW  staff  assigned  to  the  PMU  and  the  consultant \nteam. The additional salary to MPW staff will not be higher than that allowed for MPW staff with \npriority  reform  and  restructuring  status  (footnote  8).  MOF  will  review  the  request  for  additional \nsalary  to  MPW  staff  included  in  the  development  budget  request  and  allocate  the  budget \nthrough the regular fiscal budgeting processes.  \n \nC. \n \nUnder  the  ADF  IX  resolution, 14 donors  agreed  that  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF) \n45. \ngrants could be used to assist poor countries make the transition from postconflict to peace and \nstability. Afghanistan was identified as one of the poorest postconflict countries and eligible for \nADF  grants. 15  Prolonged  conflict  has  endangered  the  poor,  destroyed  their  economic \nopportunities, damaged infrastructure, and disrupted delivery of basic services to the neediest. \nThe  Bamian\u2013Yakwalang  section  of  the  Project,  due  to  its  remoteness  and  harsh  weather \nconditions, is still in need of continued humanitarian aid and assistance in basic social services. \nImprovement  to  the  road,  along  with  other  grant-financed  components  of  resettlement,  public \ncampaign  on  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking,  and  project  management  support,  will  facilitate \naccess to such social services and provide better access to markets for agricultural produce and \nlower transportation costs thereby contributing to development of some of the poorest areas in \nthe region.  \n \n46. \nAfghanistan has made significant progress since the ouster of the Taliban regime. The \nGovernment  has  implemented  a  wide  range  of  structural  reforms  and  adhered  to  almost  all \nquantitative indicators and structural benchmarks under the Staff-Monitored Program, led by the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund.  Notwithstanding  these  achievements  and  sustained  economic \ngrowth over the last 2 years, the economic and fiscal situation continues to be extremely fragile. \nSecurity, economic, social, and administrative challenges are formidable. Afghanistan continues \nto need external development finance that does not fiscally burden the nascent administration. \nTo  achieve  growth  targets  over  the  medium  term,  the  Government  must  aim  for  broad-based \nand sustainable development, and identify new drivers of growth. Investment in the road sector \nis a prerequisite for sustained economic growth, and the grant will greatly help accelerate this \ntransition.  \n \n\n                                                 \n14  Eighth  Replenishment  of  the  Asian  Development  Fund  and  Third  Regularized  Replenishment  of  the  Technical \n\nAssistance Special Fund (ADF IX Resolution). \n\n15  ADB. 2004.

The  grant  effectiveness  will  be  assessed  within  the  broader \ncontext  of  project  performance.  The  Project\u2019s  design  and  monitoring  framework  has  clear \nindicators to measure the inputs, activities, and outputs. \n \nD. \n \n48. \nA recent International Monetary Fund report expressed serious concern about the fiscal \nsustainability  of  the  Government  payroll  and  security  expenditures,  and  highlighted  the \nimportance  of  continued  assistance  from  external  funding  agencies.  Moreover,  in  view  of  the \nexceptionally  difficult  postconflict  circumstances  that  continue  to  prevail  in  Afghanistan,  the \nGovernment  has  requested  more  concessional  funding  for  its  transition  and  reconstruction \nphase. The ADF lending terms from ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, while generous, are not sufficient \nfor  sustainable  development  of  Afghanistan.  This  loan  is  proposed  to  be  made,  similar  to \nseveral previous loans since 2002,16 on the following concessional terms: (i) grandfathering pre-\n1999  ADF  lending  terms  so  that  the  loan  has  a  40-year  maturity  including  a  10-year  grace \nperiod, with a 1% interest charge throughout this period, and (ii) capitalizing interest during the \ngrace period. \n \nE. \n \n49. \n$1.7 million as shown in the Table 1.

The loan will \nhave  a  term  of  40  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  10  years,  with  an  annual  interest  rate  of \n1%.  The  total  amount  of  the  interest  charge  during  the  grace  period  will  be  capitalized  and \ncharged to the loan account. The grant will finance (i) resettlement costs, (ii) civil works for the \nBamian\u2013Yakawlang  road,  (iii)  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-human  trafficking  awareness  campaign,  and \n(iv) incremental project management support. The loan will finance (i) civil works for the Mazar-\ne-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf  road,  (ii)  cross-border \nfacilities,  and  (iii)  project  management  and \nmonitoring.  \n \nThe  ADB  loan  and  grant  totaling  $118.2  million  will  finance  84%  of  the  project  cost, \n51. \nexcluding  taxes  and  duties  of  $1.7  million  and  land  acquisition  of  $1.0  million,  which  will  be \nincurred by the Government.

The structure of project management is in Appendix 9. \n \nMOPH  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-human \n54. \ntrafficking  awareness  campaign  component.  A  steering  committee  will  be  established  under \nMOPH  comprising  representatives  from  ADB,  MOPH,  MPW,  and  UNICEF.  The  steering \ncommittee  will  set  the  direction  for  implementation  of  the  evidence-based  strategy,  supervise \nNGOs  that  will  be  recruited  to  implement  the  public  campaign  in  the  field,  and  monitor \ncomponent  progress.  MOPH  will  designate  an  official  who  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating \nand monitoring the day-to-day execution of the program through the NGOs. \n \nMOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  component  on  cross-border  facilities;  the \n55. \ndirector  general  of  the  Customs  Department  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  project \nimplementation. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n56. \nThe Project will be implemented over 42 months starting from the date of loan and grant \neffectiveness. By employing the design-build contract modality, the lead time required for project \npreparation has been reduced. The consulting services contracts are expected to be awarded \nand consultant teams mobilized by the end of 2006. Civil works contract will be awarded by the \nend of the second quarter of 2007. Civil works will be completed in the second quarter of 2010 \nfor  the  Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf  road  and  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2010  for  the  Bamian\u2013\nYakawlang road. Implementation schedules are in Appendix 9.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nProcurement of goods, services, and civil works to be financed under the ADB loan will \n57. \nbe  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (April  2006).  Civil  works \ncontracts  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  A  single-stage,  two-\nenvelope procedure (without prequalification) will be used. Equipment for cross-border facilities \nwill be procured by limited international bidding. All international procurement will be undertaken \nby the Government procurement unit operating under Afghan Reconstruction and Development \nServices.  The  procurement  plan  is  in  Appendix  10.  Before  the  commencement  of  any \nprocurement  activity  under  national  competitive  bidding,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  review \nthe  Government\u2019s  public  procurement  law  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines.  Any  necessary  modifications  or  clarifications  will  be  reflected  in  the  procurement \nplan.  Similarly,  the  Government\u2019s  standard  procedures  for  selecting  and  engaging  individual \nconsultants will also be reviewed, and modifications, if any, will be reflected in the procurement \nplan. \n \n58. \nThe  project  area  is  located  in  the  remote  areas  in  the  center  of  the  country,  where \ncountries that are not ADB members, particularly those in the Gulf region, provide competitive \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB. 2004.

Explicit  procurement \nrestrictions  may  preclude  civil  works  contractors  under  the  Project  from  seeking  the  best \nbusiness  terms,  and  ultimately  erode  economic  efficiency.  To  maximize  the  Project\u2019s \ndevelopment \nthat  civil  works \ncontractors  under  the  Project  be  allowed  to  procure  the  bitumen  required  for  road  pavement \nfrom any country, including from countries that are not ADB members.19 This special treatment \nwas  applied  to  three  previous  transport  projects  in  Afghanistan,  i.e.,  the  Regional  Airports \nRehabilitation  Project,  Andkhuouy\u2013Qaisar  Road  Project,  both  approved  in  2004,  and  Qaisar\u2013\nBala Murghab Road Project approved in 2005. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nA  total  of  181  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  740  person-months  of \n59. \nnational consultants will be engaged to supervise construction contracts and implementation of \nthe HIV/AIDS component. A total of 6 person-months of international individual consultants will \nbe engaged for procurement management. All consultants financed from the ADB loan will be \nselected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  Asian \nDevelopment Bank and Its Borrowers. ADB has approved advanced recruitment of consultants \non the understanding that such action will not necessarily commit ADB to financing the Project. \nAll  consultants  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants following the quality- and cost-based selection and \nthe full proposal method. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \nADB\u2019s anticorruption policy20 was explained to and discussed with the Government and \n60. \nMPW.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy are included in the loan and grant regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  will  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  MPW,  MOF,  and  MOPH,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n61. \nThe Government will ensure (i) submission of a general procurement notice to ADB for \npublication;  and  (ii)  upon  receiving  ADB\u2019s  no  objection  to  the  recommendation  of  the  contract \naward, it will publish in the newspaper dailies circulated nationally, both in English and the local \nlanguage, the results identifying the bid and lot numbers, and also (a) name of each bidder; (b) \nbid prices as read out at bid opening; (c) name and evaluated prices of each bid evaluated; (d) \nnames of bidders whose bids were rejected and the reasons for their rejection; and (e) name of \nthe winning bidder, and the price it offered, as well as the duration and summary scope of the \ncontract awarded.  \n \nThe  Government  will  allow  and  assist  ADB's  representatives  to  carry  out  random  spot \n62. \nchecks  on  the  work  in  progress  and  utilization  of  funds  for  the  Project.

In  the  interim,  ADB  is  separately  assisting  the \nGovernment to develop a comprehensive transparency and anticorruption strategy.21 \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n63. \nLoan  and  grant  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (January  2001),  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  An  imprest  account,  primarily  for \nincremental expenditures related to project management support for MPW, will be established \nfor a loan account and grant account under MOF with a designated treasurer in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The designated treasurer will open a deposit account at \nthe  Da  Afghanistan  Bank  to  which  ADB\u2019s  loan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  transferred  and \nagainst which the treasurer\u2019s checks will be issued. The initial amount to be deposited into the \nimprest  account  will  be  6  months  of  estimated  expenditures  or  10%  of  the  loan  and  grant \namount, whichever is lower. Statement of expenditure procedures will be used for reimbursing \neligible expenditures and liquidating the imprest account for any individual payment transaction \nup to $50,000 equivalent.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nMPW,  the  Customs  Department  of  MOF,  and  MOPH  will  maintain  separate  accounts \n64. \nand records for the Project in accordance with sound accounting principles, adequate to identify \nthe  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  financing  resources,  expenditures \nincurred for the Project, and the use of local funds. These project accounts and related financial \nstatements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  standards  by \nindependent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  MPW,  MOF,  and  MOPH  will  submit  to  ADB  the \naudited  project  account  for  2007  no  later  than  8  months  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year,  the \naudited project account for 2008 no later than 7 months after the end of the fiscal year, and the \naudited project account for 2009 and thereafter no later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal \nyear.  The  annual  audits  will  include  an  audit  of  the  imprest  account,  statement  of  expenditure \nrecords, and a separate opinion on the audit.  \n \nMPW  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  for  performance  monitoring,  issues \n65. \nresolution, and periodic action plans. The quarterly reports will serve as feedback to update and \nimprove procedures and project implementation. Within 3 months of physical completion of the \nProject, MPW will submit a project completion report on the overall impact of the Project. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n66. \nMPW will be responsible for overall project monitoring. The PMU will establish a system \nfor preparing quarterly reports, for performance monitoring and issues resolution, plus periodic \naction plans. Aided by the PMU,  MPW will undertake quantitative and qualitative performance \nmonitoring of each project component to evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the \nproject benefits accrued. With the help of the project management consultants, no later than 3 \nmonths following loan effectiveness, MPW will develop a comprehensive system for monitoring \nthe Project\u2019s performance. ADB will review and approve this system. ADB and the Government \nwill agree on the performance parameters to be monitored during project implementation and for \n3 months after project completion. \n\n                                                 \n21  ADB.  2003.

The  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  a  detailed \nprogress report on the Project\u2019s implementation and achievements prior to the midterm review. \nTerms  of  reference  for  the  midterm  review  will  be  included  in  the  project  administration \nmemorandum to be prepared by ADB\u2019s inception mission for the Project.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nSocial and Poverty Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \nIn  Afghanistan,  nearly  53%  of  the  population  are  classified  as  poor22 and  live  on  less \n68. \nthan $1 a day. The project road passes through the provinces of Balkh, Samangan, and Bamian \nand will benefit a total population of 1,735,800.23 Before the war, these provinces were known \nfor their agriculture, livestock, handicrafts, and carpet industry. The existing road condition is the \nbiggest constraint as people are unable to transport their products to market and currently crops \nare  grown  on  a  small  scale  only  for  household  consumption.  Poverty  in  these  provinces  is \nestimated  to  be  60%  with  the  majority  of  the  population  living  in  mud  houses  (80%\u201395%) \nwithout electricity, clean water, proper sanitation facilities, and garbage disposal system. As per \nthe  data  available,  only  10%\u201311%  of  the  households  in  these  three  provinces  had  access  to \nclean water; only 10% in Balkh province had a garbage disposal system. The social assessment \nindicates  that  the  population  living  along  the  proposed  alignment  is  generally  poor  with  about \n48%  having  an  annual  income  of  less  than  $600  with  an  average  household  size  of  9.  The \nsurvey also indicates that 75% were engaged in subsistence agriculture and allied activities for \ntheir livelihood, while the rest had small businesses in the town areas.  \n \nThe  Project  will  lead  to  both  direct  and  indirect  poverty  reduction  impacts.  The  direct \n69. \npoverty  impact  will  be  on  income  generation  and  demand  for  unskilled  labor  and  wages \naccruing  during  construction  of  the  project  road.  Other  benefits  will  be  lower  travel  time  and \ntravel  costs,  and  higher  agricultural  product  profit  margins.  Improved  roads  will  lead  to  a  shift \nfrom  subsistence  agriculture  to  market-based  production  enabling  farmers  to  grow  perishable \ncommercial products like vegetables and fruits and to more quickly transport them to markets. \nImproved road conditions will lead to growth of affordable transport facilities and thus the poor, \nespecially  women  and  children  will  have  more  reliable,  affordable,  and  timely  access  to \neducational and medical facilities. Lower transportation costs will also increase mobility among \nthe poor to find employment opportunities in other areas. Increased access to local and national \nmarkets  will  lead  to  growth  of  local  trade  and  production  activities,  and  reduced  prices  of \nagricultural commodities and other products. Thus increased economic activity and easy access \nto  social  services  are  expected  to  significantly  increase  household  incomes  and  quality  of  life \nthereby reducing overall poverty incidence. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy \nis in Appendix 11. \n \n\n                                                 \n22  ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n23  Central Statistics Office Afghanistan, 2003 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\nB. \n \n70. \nOverall,  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impact  for  the  Project  will  be  significant. \nThe  total  land  requirement  for  the  Project  is  estimated  to  be  212.6  hectares  (ha),  comprising \n162  ha  of  barren  unproductive  government-owned  land  and  50.6  ha  of  privately  owned \nagricultural land. Although most of the improvement works will be carried out within the existing \nright-of-way, a narrow strip of agricultural land to be acquired will affect about 1,515 households \nthat  will  lose  a  portion  of  their  total  agricultural  landholding  and  4,000  wood  trees.  Nearly  59 \nhouseholds  will  lose  a  portion  of  their  residential  structure;  of  these  only  8  households  will \nrequire  relocation.  About  141  households  operating  roadside  shops/small  businesses  will  be \naffected  with  the  majority  losing  their  building  extensions,  except  for  23  households  who  will \nrequire  relocation.  No  common  property  resources  or  religious  structures  will  be  affected. \nOverall the Project will affect 2,583 households and 21,517 people. The affected households will \nreceive  cash  for  land  and  assets  at  replacement  prices.  Compensation  will  be  provided  for \ntemporary loss of income, relocation assistance, and additional assistance to vulnerable groups. \nNo  indigenous  people  will  be  affected  by  the  Project.  A  summary  resettlement  plan  is  in \nAppendix  12.  The  summary  resettlement  plan  was  translated  into  Dari  and  disclosed  to  those \naffected.  The  resettlement  plan  will  also  be  publicly  available  at  MPW,  ADB  Afghanistan \nResident Mission, and the ADB website. \n \nC. \n \n71. \nThe  economic  analysis  was  conducted  separately  for  the  two  district  roads  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. The highway design \nand maintenance model (HDM-IV) was used to calculate vehicle operating costs and time costs \nwith modification for conditions in Afghanistan. The major inputs include vehicle characteristics \nand related costs, and construction and maintenance costs. The major benefits are derived from \nsavings of vehicle operating costs and travel time due to rehabilitation of the project road, which \nwill provide a stimulus for economic growth in the project area.  \n \n72. \nThe economic evaluation resulted in an economic internal rate of return of 29.8% for the \nMazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf  road  and  20.7%  for  the  Bamian\u2013Yakawlang  road.  The  Project\u2019s \neconomic costs include the resource costs for traded and nontraded costs, materials, and labor. \nAll cost elements are valued at border prices, using a world price numeraire, with all taxes and \nduties  excluded.  A  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.95  was  applied  to  the  financial  costs  of \nnontraded inputs to calculate economic prices.  \n \n73. \nThe sensitivity of the economic internal rate of return for the project roads was analyzed \nwith respect to changes in the benefit and cost streams such as (i) construction costs increase \nby  20%,  (ii)  benefits  decrease  by  20%,  (iii)  no  time  savings  considered,  (iv)  no  diverted  and \ngenerated  traffic,  and  (v)  the  combination  of  (i)  and  (ii).  The  results  show  that  the  quantified \neconomic benefits are robust to various sensitivity tests for the overall project road, even in the \nworst  case  of  no  diverted  and  generated  traffic.  Details  of  economic  analysis  are  in  Appendix \n13. \n \nD. \n \n74. \nBased on the type of project activities and environmental conditions of the project areas, \nthe  Project  is  categorized  as  \u201cB\u201d  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Guidelines  on  Environmental \nAssessment.  Therefore  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  study  for  rehabilitation  and \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nreconstruction  of  two  project  roads  was  undertaken  as  part  of  the  feasibility  study.  The  IEE \nreport will be submitted to MPW for approval. \n \n75. \nThe IEE found that the environmental impacts associated with the Project would mostly \noccur during construction. The impacts are temporary and most of the mitigation measures will \nbe incorporated into the contract document. However, careful monitoring needs to be conducted \nfor  blasting  related  activities,  disposal  of  spoiled  (earth  waste)  materials,  and  potential \nlandslides due to location of the Project mostly in mountainous and hilly areas. The contractor \nwill be required to strictly implement the proposed mitigation measures. The IEE recommends \nthat  no  environmental  assessment  study  be  conducted  as  the  environmental  impacts  are \ntemporary and insignificant. The summary of the IEE and environment monitoring plan matrix is \nattached in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n76. \nThe  proposed  mitigation  measures  are  manageable  and  most  can  be  incorporated  in \nthe  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  the  Project.  The  mitigation  measures  during \nconstruction will be incorporated in the contractor job assignments, therefore the IEE report will \nalso be made available to the contractor. An environmental engineer, who will be hired as part \nof  the  consultant  team  supervising  civil  works  for  MPW,  will  assist  in  preparing  contractual \ndocuments  so  that  the  bidding  documents  and  other  contractual  obligations  of  the  contractor \nclearly  identify  environmental  responsibilities  and  describe  penalties  for  noncompliance.  MPW \nthrough its site offices will be responsible for implementing the overall environmental monitoring \nand management plan. Any change on alignment needs to be reported to ADB, and therefore \nthe necessary environmental assessment study would be conducted. In addition, MPW, in close \nconsultation  with  ADB,  will  provide  remedial  measures  for  unforeseen  environmental  impacts \nthat were not covered in the IEE report.  \n \nE. \n \n77. \n \n\nImplementation of the Project entails a number of risks: \n\nRisks \n\nThe overall political and security situation remains volatile. ADB will need to closely \nmonitor the situation and coordinate with local and central authorities and the United \nNations to ensure adequate protection.24 ADB\u2019s TA for the Security of ADB-Financed \nProjects  in  Afghanistan  will  provide  advice  on  how  to  ensure  a  safe  work \nenvironment for on-site personnel assigned by the contractors, subcontractors, and \nconsulting  firms.  Under  the  prevailing  conditions,  however,  this  security  risk  cannot \nbe  mitigated  completely,  and  delays  in  project  implementation,  if  security  hazards \noccur in project locations, will be inevitable. \n\nRegional  warlords  and  militia  leaders  retain  their  military  strength  and  consequent \ninfluence in regional politics. Such political instability could hamper smooth supply of \nraw  materials  and  equipment  transported  through  areas  controlled  by  regional \nwarlords  and  militia  leaders,  and  could  constrain  supervision  of  construction  works \nby the consultants and ADB staff.  \n\nImproved  roads  can  be used  as  a  route  to  transport  opium.  As  part  of the  national \ncounternarcotics strategy, the Government will improve border procedures to contain \n\n                                                 \n24  Coordination  with  the  provincial  reconstruction  teams  providing  security  for  development  activities  in  the  project \n\narea will also be explored.  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\n\f \n\nthe trafficking of narcotics. However, the trafficking of narcotics cannot be completely \ncontained unless opium poppy cultivation is eradicated.  \n\nThe risks of road connectivity improvements contributing to the spread of HIV/AIDS \nand anti-human trafficking are addressed by the Project\u2019s HIV/AIDS prevention and \nhuman trafficking component.  \nBecause  Government  implementation  capacity  remains  very  weak,  implementation \nof key activities may be delayed. Resources will be allocated for consulting services \nto  help  with  project  management  and  implementation.  Additional  capacity  building \ninitiatives focusing on financial management are provided under the TA cluster. The \nGovernment  will  establish  a  strong  coordination  and  monitoring  mechanism.  ADB \nwill field review missions as frequently as necessary. \n\nThe Government may have difficulty  meeting its project cost obligations in a timely \nmanner,  e.g.,  operation  and  maintenance  costs  and  counterpart  funding.  In \nparticular,  lack  of  road  sector  revenue  may  constrain  MOF\u2019s  allocation  of  sufficient \nroad maintenance budget, which will jeopardize the sustainability of road investment. \nADB  will  work  closely  with  MPW  to  address  this  issue  by  examining  mitigating \nmeasures to enhance road sector revenues and put in place a mechanism to secure \nsufficient budget for road maintenance (paras. 16-19). \n\n(vii)  The  risk  of  corruption  and  poor  governance  will  be  addressed  by  ADB\u2019s  parallel \nsupport  for  development  of  a  comprehensive  transparency  and  anticorruption \nstrategy,  the  Government\u2019s  disclosure  of  detailed  progress  with  bid  evaluation  and \nresults  in  the  newspaper,  and  ADB\u2019s  conduct  of  random  spot  checks  on  work  in \nprogress and utilization of funds for the Project.  \n\n \n78. \nlikelihood of the risks occurring and risk mitigation measures to be applied. \n \n\nThe  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs,  given  the \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n79. \ngiven the following specific assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government, MPW , MOF, and MOPH have \n\nSecurity.  The Government will make its best effort to provide adequate security for \nthe  smooth  and  uninterrupted  implementation  of  the  Project.  In  addition,  the \nGovernment will ensure that all civil works contracts will require the preparation of an \naction  plan  for  adequate  security  and  smooth  and  uninterrupted  implementation  of \nthe Project, that the cost of implementing such a plan will be included in the budget \nfor such civil works, and that such a plan is fully implemented. \n\nRoad maintenance financing. The Government will allocate and make available, in \na timely manner, sufficient funds from its budget for each fiscal year for the operation \nand  proper  maintenance  of  the  project  roads.  The  Government  will  ensure \nimplementation  of  a  toll  collection  system  on  the  ring  road,  which  has  been \nrehabilitated  by  donors'  assistance  for  its  maintenance.  The  Government  will  adopt \nadequate procedures to promote transparency and accountability in the collection of \nthe  proceeds  from  the  toll  collection  system  and  will  install  proper  procedures \nincluding spot audits to detect any abuse in collection and use of the proceeds. The \nGovernment  will  also  evaluate  other  sustainable  methods  for  revenue  generation \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n21\n\nsuch as setting up a dedicated road maintenance fund based on fuel levies, vehicle \nlicensing,  and  other  road  user  related  taxes,  and  will  complete  this  evaluation  by \nDecember 2007. \n\nImplementation  of  the  Road  Master  Plan.  Within  3  months  of  loan effectiveness, \nthe Government will approve the Road Master Plan for Road Network Improvement \nas  a  document  guiding road  development  and  maintenance,  and  will establish,  and \nsufficiently  resource  and  empower,  the  Master  Plan  Unit  in  MPW  to  program  and \nimplement the Road Master Plan. \n\nRoad  safety.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  road  safety  measures  agreed  upon \nwith  ADB  are  incorporated  in  the  design  of  the  Project  and  that  public  awareness \ncampaigns related to such measures are conducted on a periodic basis. \n\nAnticorruption.  The  Government  will,  in  addition  to  its  application  of  ADB\u2019s \nanticorruption  policy,  undertake  other  measures  to  ensure  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  including  (a)  submitting  a  general  procurement \nnotice  to  ADB  for  publication  in  accordance  with  the  Procurement  Guidelines;  (b) \npublishing,  upon  receiving  ADB\u2019s  \u201cno  objection\u201d  to  the  recommendation  of  the \ncontract  award,  in  newspaper  dailies  circulated  nationally,  both  in  English  and  the \nlocal  language  (Dari),  the  results  identifying  the  bid  and  lot  numbers,  and  also  (i) \nname  of  each  bidder;  (ii)  bid  prices  as  read  out  at  bid  opening;  (iii)  name  and \nevaluated  prices  of  each  bid  evaluated;  (iv)  names  of  bidders  whose  bids  were \nrejected and the reasons for their rejection; and (v) name of the winning bidder and \nthe  price  it  offered,  as  well  as  the  duration  and  summary  scope  of  the  contract \nawarded;  and  (c)  allowing  and  assisting  ADB's  representatives  to  carry  out  random \nspot checks on the work in progress and utilization of funds for the Project. \n\nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  activities  will  be  carried  out  promptly  and  efficiently,  in \naccordance  with  (a)  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Islamic  Republic  of \nAfghanistan;  (b)  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement  policy; 25 and  (c)  the  agreed-upon \nresettlement plan, The Government will ensure that (a) all people affected are given \nadequate  opportunity  to  participate  in  resettlement  planning  and  implementation, \nparticularly  in  entitlement  and  income  restoration  measures  as  set  out  in  the \nresettlement  plan;  (b)  compensation  and  other  assistance  are  paid  to  the  affected \npersons  in  the  first  section  of  the  project  road(s)  under  each  contract  package  3 \nmonths prior to their displacement from their houses, land, and assets; and prior to \ncommencement of civil works in such first section; (c) civil works for the subsequent \nsections of the project road(s) under each contract package will not commence until \nthe payment of compensation and other assistance to the affected persons has been \ncompleted prior to their displacement from their houses, land, and assets; (d) MPW \nwill  provide  quarterly  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  on  resettlement  implementation \nincluding  detailed  compensation  assessment  and  resettlement  assistance  for  each \naffected  person,  and  date  and  amount  of  funds  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the \nresettlement plan, separately for the Government and ADB financed components; (e) \nMPW  will  engage  an  external  monitor,  acceptable  to  ADB  and  with  terms  of \nreference included in the agreed resettlement plan, within 3 months of loan and grant \neffectiveness,  who  will  provide  to  ADB  biannual  monitoring  and  social  audit  reports \n\n                                                 \n25  ADB. 1995.

regional highways, \n1. \n4,900 km of national highways, 9,700 km of provincial roads, 17,000\u201323,000 km of rural roads,1 \nand about 3,000 km of urban roads including 1,060 km in Kabul. Regional highways, comprising \nthe  2,300  km  ring  road  that  connects  Afghanistan\u2019s  major  regional  centers  (Herat,  Kandahar, \nMazar-e-Sharif, Maymaneh, and Sheberghan) with Kabul, and the roads linking to neighboring \ncountries,  foster  regional  trade  and  economic  linkages  between  Afghanistan  and  neighboring \ncountries such as Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. National highways \nextend  regional  highways  to  provincial  capitals  contributing  to  economic  growth  and  national \nintegration. Provincial roads improve the administrative, trade, and economic contacts between \ndistrict  headquarters  and  respective  provincial  capitals,  and  between  important  district \nheadquarters; while rural roads bring remote areas in commercial contact with markets.  \n \n\nTable A2.1: Road Network in Afghanistan \n\nRoad Classification  \nRegional Highway \nNational Highway \nProvincial Road \n \nRural Road (estimate) \n\nSubtotal \n\nkm = kilometer \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nTotal \n \n\n \n\nLength (km) \n3,242 \n4,884 \n9,656 \n17,782 \n17,000 \n34,782 \n\n \nSince rehabilitation of roads started after more than two decades of conflict, the focus of \n2. \nthe  road  rehabilitation  program  has  been  the  reconstruction  and  completion  of  the  regional \nhighways.  Once  the  current  or  planned  projects  are  completed  by  2007,  the  existing  regional \nhighway network will be improved to a two-lane, bitumen-paved road standard, with certain four-\nlane sections near Kabul and Kandahar. In contrast, more than 90% of national highways and \nprovincial  roads  are  either  earth  or  gravel,  and  over  60%  are  in  a  poor  condition.  Many  are \nimpassable at specific locations such as rivers and sections where severe erosion or landslides \nhave occurred. Except for newly constructed bridges, most bridges and culverts along national \nhighways and provincial roads are in bad condition. Many are in danger of collapse from heavily \nloaded vehicles or of being washed away. Details of road conditions are provided in Table A2.2. \n \n3. \nAfghanistan  is  receiving  extensive  assistance  from  the  international  aid  community  to \nreconstruct  and  develop  the  road  network.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  is  the  primary \nImplementing  Agency.  The  focus  of  the  road  program  is  the  reconstruction  and  completion  of \nthe  ring  road  and  principal  road  connections  with  neighboring  countries  (the  regional  highway \nnetwork). Together, the current and planned projects will complete the existing regional highway \nnetwork  to  a  two-lane  paved  road  standard,  with  certain  four-lane  sections  near  Kabul  and \nKandahar.  The  next  development  stage  will  be  improving  high-traffic  sections  to  a  four-lane \nstandard.  Other  road  programs  are  being  carried  out  to  reconstruct  or  improve  national \nhighways,  provincial  roads,  and  rural  roads.

According  to \nstatistics provided in a recent International Monetary Fund country report,2 transport of goods by \nroad  increased  from  1.9  million  tons  in  2000  to  3.7  million  tons  in  2001  and  5  million  tons  in \n2002,  representing  an  almost  fourfold  increase.

More than 147,000 vehicles were estimated to be registered \nin  Kabul,  which  under  certain  assumptions  would  translate  into  about  304,000  vehicles \ncountrywide. Most vehicles are owned and operated by the private sector.  \n\n                                                 \n2   International  Monetary  Fund.  2003.  Islamic  State  of  Afghanistan:  Rebuilding  a  Macroeconomic  Framework  for \n\nReconstruction and Growth. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  is  the  road  transport  regulator,  road  transport  service \n5. \nprovider, as well as policymaker. It regulates the private sector transport industry and manages \nthe government-owned vehicle fleet. Before 1978, freight and long distance bus services were \nleft  to  the  private  sector,  while  the  public  sector  played  a  role  in  the  Kabul  bus  service.  New \nlegislation  in  1978  authorized  the  Government  to  provide  nationwide  freight  and  passenger \nservices.  In  1990,  MOT  reportedly  controlled  1,600  trucks,  1,000  buses,  and  extensive \nworkshops. During the conflict, however, almost all fleets were lost. MOT provincial checkpoints \nthat  once  tracked  performance  and  location  of  its  fleets  and  all  other  traffic  now  only  monitor \nprivate vehicles. \n \n6. \nWith  a  current  staffing  level  of  1,180,  MOT\u2019s  primary  function  now  is  coordinating \nagreements  between  private  sector  and  international  transporters,  and  establishing  offices  in \nneighboring countries to facilitate international trade. MOT is structured to have 10 departments \nunder  the  minister  and  two  deputy  ministers.  Over  70%  of  the  staff  is  in  the  private  sector \ndepartment,  which  sets  technical  standards  for  private  commercial  vehicles,  inspects  them  for \ncompliance during the licensing/renewal process, and collects a carriage fee from private trucks \nand  a  trip  fee  from  interprovincial  private  buses.  These  fees  are  collected  at  national  or \nprovincial borders or the outskirts of major cities.  \n \n7. \nThe  Afghan  private  sector  has  historically  played  a  dominant  role  in  trucking  and \nmaintained its presence, including individuals and firms that relocated in Pakistan during the war \nyears.  Long  distance  public  transport,  linking  major  cities  and  neighboring  countries,  which \ndeteriorated due to road and vehicle conditions as well as suppressed demand for road travel, \nhas been regaining its role. However, security remains a major impediment for full restoration of \noperations.  \n \n8. \nUrban  transport,  once  dominated  by  the  public  sector,  is  now  mostly  provided  by \nprivately owned buses, taxis, and minivans, but with little regulation. It is constrained by lack of \ntransport capacity; congestion; pollution; lack of accessibility; inadequate route coverage; poor \nroad condition; and lack of depots, stops, and terminals as well as designated road space. The \nurban  transport  system  needs  integrated  planning.  Vehicle  fleet  support  services  are  mostly \nprivately  provided,  with  government  workshops  operating  poorly,  including  those  at  border \npoints.  Forms  of  regional  transport  depend  on  the  state  of  the  roads  and  the  availability  of \nvehicles.  People  and  goods  move  together,  blurring  distinction  between  passenger  and \ncommercial  freight  traffic.  Private  agencies  operate  provincial  and  district  routes.  Some  165 \nregistered  long-distance  private  bus  companies  are  estimated  to  be  operating\u2014101  based  in \nKabul, 64 in the provinces\u2014with a total of 14,007 buses, mostly old minibuses and vans. \n \n9. \nThe taxi system in Afghanistan is widespread and well organized. According to MOT, 24 \ntaxi  unions  registered  in  Kabul  and  27  in  the  provinces  have  a  total  of  29,131  vehicles. \nAccording to the Transport Sector Review, the real number of taxis in Kabul is perhaps 30,000. \nTaxis  seem  to  operate  freely,  with  little  adherence  to  zonal  or  any  other  rules.  In  addition, \nintermediate size vehicles of all sizes and shapes transport passengers and goods. \n \nC.  \n \n10. \nRoad administration is highly centralized. Before the protracted hostilities, the Ministry of \nPublic Works (MPW), through its 15 departments, was virtually responsible for all government \nconstruction and maintenance, including roads and bridges, airports, public housing, and water \nsupply.  A  number  of  MPW  construction  units  carried  out  all  aspects  of  planning,  design, \nconstruction,  and  maintenance.  Before  1992,  just  one  of  MPW\u2019s  departments,  Road \n\nRoad Administration \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n31\n\nRoad Sector Revenues and Expenditures \n\nConstruction  and  Development,  had  more  than  5,000  employees.  In  addition,  MPW  had  a \nmultitude of other responsibilities such as city planning and collection of road tolls. Theoretically, \nMPW retains all of these responsibilities. The Ministry of Rehabilitation and Rural Development \nis  responsible  for  development  of  rural  infrastructure,  including  rural  roads.  Municipalities  are \nresponsible for the construction and maintenance of urban roads. \n \n11. \nOver the course of the conflict, the Government ministries lost a majority of their trained \nstaff. In provinces where staff and equipment were retained, they were often under the influence \nof provincial governments and not fully under the control of ministry headquarters in Kabul. This \nsituation is gradually being realigned as the central Government successfully extends its control \noutside  Kabul  to  the  provinces.  The  current  staffing  level  of  MPW  is  about  2,900:  900  are \nemployed on a permanent basis, 1,900 are paid daily wages, and 140 are military officers. Most \nof the current staff require substantial skill enhancement to perform their duties. \n \n12. \nTo  fill  the  capacity  gap,  most  of  the  externally  funded  projects  are  being  implemented \nwith  assistance  of  international  consultants  in  project  management.  Civil  works  are  packaged \ninto  large  contracts  and  bid  out  through  competitive  procedures  to  private  sector  contractors. \nConsultants  engaged  by  MPW  supervise  the  works  of  contractors.  MPW  is  being  transformed \ninto  a  lean  and  thin  organization  with  its  primary  task  being  nationwide  policy  formation, \nplanning  of  the  countrywide  road  network,  setting  of  standards  (including  technical,  safety, \nsocial, and environmental safeguards), regulation and enforcement functions, and management \nof roads under its jurisdiction.  \n \nD.  \n \n13. \nSince 2002, with external assistance, the Government has been making massive efforts \nto reestablish the road network, particularly for regional highways, in order to facilitate provision \nof basic social services to remote provinces, provide security, and involve all the population in \nundertaking  nation-building  activities.  Afghanistan  is  receiving  extensive  assistance  from  the \ninternational  aid  community  to  reconstruct  and  develop  the  road  network.  For  regional \nhighways, almost $1.2 billion has been provided or committed to rehabilitate 3,100 km of roads. \nThese rehabilitation works will be completed by 2007. For national highways, about $270 million \nhas  been  committed  to  reconstruct  and  improve  1,200  km  of  roads.  These  commitments  are \nmainly to rehabilitate damaged roads. \n \n14. \nThe  Government  is  preparing  the  priority  road  development  program  for  the  next  10 \nyears  (2006\u20132015)  in  line  with  recommendations  of  the  road  master  plan  currently  being \nprepared with Asian Development Bank assistance. The least-cost option recommended by the \nroad master plan envisages (i) upgrading 281 km of high-traffic regional highways to four lanes, \n(ii)  improving  2,700  km of  high  priority  national highways,  and  (iii)  improving  5,000  km  of  high \npriority provincial roads. The required road expenditure to implement the recommended option \nis  $1.7  billion  excluding  ongoing  projects  with  financing  resources  secured.  Considering  the \nlimited prospect for private sector financing of these large investments in the foreseeable future, \nthe  public  sector  and  external  assistance  will  continue  to  be  responsible  for  meeting  the  road \nexpenditure requirement.  \n \n15. \nRoutine  road  maintenance  expenditures  are  projected  to  increase  steadily  as  road \nprojects are completed, from $8 million in 2006 to $25 million in 2015. Periodic maintenance will \nnot  be  required  until  2010,  but  then  the  expenditure  will  increase  significantly  to  about  $45 \nmillion per year from 2011 to 2015 because the regional and national highway projects currently \nimmediate \nunder  construction  will  require \n\nfirst  periodic  maintenance.  The  most \n\ntheir \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nmaintenance requirement is for special maintenance work on national highways and provincial \nroads for which maintenance has long been delayed, beginning with an estimated $26 million in \n2006  and  gradually  decreasing  to  $14  million  in  2015  as  the  backlog  of  work  is  eliminated. \nDuring  2006\u20132015,  the  need  for  special  works  will  decrease  while  the  need  for  routine  and \nperiodic maintenance will increase, approximately balancing each other. During 2006\u20132010, the \naverage annual maintenance requirement including routine, periodic, and backlog maintenance \nranges from $34 million to $47 million, increasing to $87 million during 2011\u20132015 because of \nthe significant increase of periodic maintenance. \n \n\nTable A2.4: Average Annual Maintenance Requirement 2011\u20132015 \n($ million) \n\n \nItem \nRoutine Maintenance \nPeriodic Maintenance \n \nSpecial Works \nTotal  \n \n\nSubtotal  \n\nRegional \nHighways \n10 \n28 \n38 \n0 \n38 \n\nNational \nHighways \n8 \n9 \n17 \n8 \n25 \n\nProvincial \nRoads \n4 \n9 \n13 \n11 \n24 \n\n \nTotal \n22 \n46 \n68 \n19 \n87 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \nExpected road revenue falls far short of the required road maintenance expenditure. The \n16. \nmain  source  of  road  revenue,  road  tolls  which  the  Government  will  reinstate  for  rehabilitated \nregional  highways,  is  expected  to  generate  $13  million\u2013$23  million  during  2006\u20132015  on  the \nbasis of the toll rate of $0.005 per passenger car equivalent per km. Even considering vehicle \nregistration  fees  currently  collected  and  expected  to  generate  $3  million\u2013$6  million  per  year \nduring  2006\u20132015,  the  expected  road  revenue  will  be  able  to  finance  about  30%\u201350%  of  the \nroad maintenance requirement.  \n \nTo relieve the shortfall of road revenue, the Government is considering introducing a fuel \n17. \nlevy. At present, fuel prices in Afghanistan rank among the lowest in the region (about $0.5 per \nliter) with no tax levied except customs duty of 9%, while taxes on fuel in other countries range \nfrom  13%  to  70%.  Based  on  fuel  usage  and  estimated  vehicle population,  the  total  amount  of \nfuel used for road transport is estimated at 582 million liters per year, which can translate into \n$291  million  in  expenditure  for  fuel  consumed  by  road  users.  A  10%\u201315%  fuel  tax  would \ngenerate $29 million\u2013$48 million of additional road revenue, which will be sufficient to cover the \nshortfall of current road revenue. The development partners\u2019 local consultative group, consisting \nof  major  financiers  such  as  the  World  Bank,  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation, considers introduction of a fuel tax \nas a key agenda item for policy dialogue and will continue its dialogue with the Government to \nsecure stable financing sources for sustainable road maintenance. \n \n\n \n\n\fEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SECTOR \n\n \n\n \n\nProject \n\n \nA.

The project road \nruns  through  the  remotest  and  least  developed  areas  of  the  country.  Rehabilitating  and \nimproving the north\u2013south link will contribute to promoting increased connectivity and linkages \nfor  isolated  communities,  create  employment  opportunities  for  unskilled  laborers  involved  in \nroad  construction  and  maintenance  (with  possible  targeting  of  internally  and/or  internationally \ndisplaced  persons  and  ex-combatants),  promote  increased  access  to  basic  social  services \n(education and health), and support income-generating opportunities for poor households. Other \nthan  positive  impacts  on  poverty  reduction,  improved  transport  network  connectivity  (and  the \nrelated  increased  road  traffic  and  mobility)  will  encourage  the  introduction  of  sex  workers  and \nmigrant labors, leading to a potential increase in the spread of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking \nrisks in the project area. Women\u2019s greater exposure to HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections \n(STIs),  and,  increasingly,  human  trafficking  is  acknowledged  and  forms  the  rationale  for  the \nproposed initiatives under this component. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nAfghanistan is, on the surface, a conservative Islamic country, making the issues of sex, \ngender  relations,  and  HIV/AIDS  sensitive  issues  to  discuss.  HIV/AIDS  prevalence  as  reported \nby the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) is 51 HIV cases and 4 deaths (as of 2006). Diagnostic \ncapacity varies and the real number of cases may be far higher as screening has been limited to \nblood  donors.  Little  is  known  about  the  factors  that  influence  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  in \nAfghanistan.  However,  many  existing  vulnerability  factors  could  fuel  the  epidemic,  and \ncontribute to women\u2019s greater vulnerability to the risks and impacts of HIV/AIDS. These include \nthe following: \n \n\nThe Current HIV/AIDS Situation \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nLow  status  of  women.  Two  decades  of  conflict  have  not  only  led  to  a \nbreakdown  of  infrastructure  and  delivery  of  services  in  Afghanistan,  but  also \ncontributed  to  the  downward  trend  of  women's  rights.  The  gender  development \nindex is among the lowest in the world. According to a 2006 World Bank report, \nopportunities  available  to  Afghan  women  in  the  areas  of  health,  education, \nemployment, and legal and political rights are extremely low by world standards. \nThey  lack  access  to  information  on  how  to  protect  themselves.  Although  little \ndata  is  available,  many  women  may  be  forced  into  sex  work  to  support  their \nfamilies. \n\nHigh number of refugees and displaced people. As a result of poverty, lack of \namenities, and conflict situations, Afghanistan has the second largest number of \nrefugees  in  the  world  after  Palestine.  According  to  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme\u2019s  Human  Development  Report,  2004,  3.4  million \nAfghans  continue  to  remain  outside  the  country.  In  addition,  the  southern  and \nwestern  parts  of  the  country  host  nearly  200,000  internally  displaced  persons. \nAlthough  little  is  known  about  the  HIV  risk  behaviors  of  Afghan  refugees  and \ndisplaced  people,  such  groups  generally  have  little  access  to  information  about \nHIV/AIDS and are often vulnerable due to isolation from their families and lack of \nhope or the means to support themselves. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n35\n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nInjecting drug use. Afghanistan is one of the world's largest producers of opium, \nwhich is used to make heroin. Easy access to drugs could result in high use of \ninjecting  drugs.  The  combination  of  poverty  and  lack  of  information  makes  the \nwidespread sharing of needles more likely. \n\nLack  of  a  health  system. Much of the population lacks access to basic health \nservices,  and  most  rural  areas  have  an  acute  shortage  of  health  facilities  and \ntrained  staff,  particularly  female  staff.  An  estimated  40%  of  all  basic  health \nfacilities lack female staff. \n\n \n3. \nThe  National  HIV/AIDS  and  STI  Control  Program  (NACP),  adopted  in  July  2003,  is \ncurrently  being  revised.  The  first  draft  of  the  National  Strategic  Plan  of  HIV/AIDS  and  STI \nControl  (2006\u20132010)  has  been  prepared  in  consultation  with  different  aid  partners  working  in \nthis sector. The strategic plan prepared by MOPH outlines the priority areas of intervention: (i) \nsurveillance  and  research;  (ii)  prevention  of  HIV/AIDS  through  information,  education,  and \ncommunication  (IEC)  for  high-risk  groups  and  the  general  population;  (iii)  prevention  and \nmanagement  of  STIs;  (iv)  blood  safety;  and  (v)  voluntary  counselling  and  testing,  care, \ntreatment,  and  support.  The  NACP  office  in  Kabul  reports  that  three  voluntary  test  and \ncounselling  centers  are  operating  in  Kabul,  Jalalabad,  and  heart;  and  three  more  are  being \nopened in other provinces with support from the development partners. The NACP office notes \na severe lack of information on HIV/AIDS prevalence among different high-risk groups and the \ngeneral  population.  MOPH  is  planning  to  conduct  surveillance  surveys  and  social  mapping  to \nidentify  behavioral  patterns  of  high-risk  groups.  MOPH  together  with  the  Ministry  of  Religious \nAffairs and support from development partners (United Nations Children\u2019s Fund [UNICEF] and \nthe  Religious  Leaders  National \n[UNFPA]),  organized \nUnited  Nations  Population  Fund \nConsultative  Conference  on  HIV/AIDS  in  July  2004,  in  which  the  role  of  religious  leaders  on \nincreasing  awareness  of  HIV/AIDS  and  STIs  was  identified  and  an  action  plan  prepared. \nUnderstanding  the  sociocultural  and  economic  factors  and  power  relations  between  men  and \nwomen,  among  men,  and  among  women  is  essential  to  understanding  the  behavioral \nunderpinnings of the spread of HIV/AIDS. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nHuman  trafficking  is  the  forced  removal  and  migration  of  people  against  their  will. \nAccording to the International Organisation for Migration, Afghanistan is prone to both internal \nand  international  trafficking.  Human  trafficking  victims  are  often  women  and  children,  usually \ndestined  for  Middle  Eastern  countries.  Numerous  types  of  activities  are  related  to  human \n55trafficking, many are linked to poverty in the country. These include (i) commercial sex work, \n(ii) forced labor in the carpet industry and servitude, (iii) forced recruitment into armed groups, \n(iv) forced religious training, and (v) sale of body organs (as indicated by local nongovernment \norganizations [NGOs]).  Poppy cultivation is  also supposed to be a sign  of poverty and human \ntrafficking for labor, but people are reported to voluntarily do this work as it provides substantial \nfinancial return. With respect to this project, since cross-border traffic is not expected to use the \nproject roads, the possibility of internal trafficking could materialize. \n \nD. \n \n5. \nIn  2005,  in  the  design  of  the  Qaisar  to  Bala  Murgab  Road  Project,  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  adopted  a  set  of  guiding  principles  with  regard  to  the  prevention  of \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking,  in  consultation  with  international  and  national  NGOs,  United \nNations  agencies  (UNFPA,  UNICEF,  World  Health  Organization),  and  MOPH  involved  in \n\nGuiding Principles HIV/AIDS and Trafficking  \n\nThe Current Human Trafficking Situation \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking prevention in Afghanistan. Since HIV/AIDS is a difficult issue to \nbroach in a conservative society like Afghanistan, similar guiding principles will be adopted for \nthis Project. They are as follows: \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\nAn awareness program on HIV/AIDS will be designed in line with the NACP. Any \nintervention  program  will  be  designed  and  implemented  in  coordination  with \nMOPH and in consultation with other development partners. \n\nSensitization  workshops,  to  be  carried  out  by  MOPH  with  support  from \ndevelopment  partners  for  MPW,  Department  of  Religious  Affairs,  and  partner \nNGOs,  will  emphasize \nlinkage  between  construction  of  roads  and \ntransmission of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. \n\nthe \n\nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness will be implemented not as a stand-\nalone  component  but  rather  integrated  to  relevant  ongoing aid-assisted  projects \nor  will  be  discussed  along  with  other  priority  issues  linked  to  basic  health \nservices, reproductive health, hygiene awareness, and literacy programs. \n\nleaders,  opinion \n\nCommunity \nleaders,  and  women\u2019s \norganizations  will  be  involved;  and  community  awareness  and  training  on \nHIV/AIDS and combating human trafficking will be provided for better outreach. \n\nreligious \n\nleaders, \n\nAs a start point, increasing awareness of HIV/AIDS, STIs, and human trafficking \nwill  be  initiated  in  cities,  urban  areas,  and  market  places;  once  successful, \ninformation on the issues will be disseminated in remote areas. \n\n \n(vi)  MPW  with  assistance  from  MOPH  will  collaborate  with  different  development \npartners (UNFPA, UNICEF, World Bank, World Health Organization, and others) \nto prepare a detailed operational plan for increasing awareness of HIV/AIDS and \nhuman trafficking for the Project. \n\n \n(vii)  MPW  with  assistance  from  MOPH  will  collaborate  with  different  development \npartners  to  seek  technical  expertise  on  training,  IEC,  capacity  building  on \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  issues;  and  support  on  counselling,  condom \ndistribution, and treatment services. \n\nHIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking Subcomponent \n\n \nE. \n \n6. \nBaseline information data on HIV/AIDS, migration, and human trafficking patterns in the \nproject area, including a list of local government and NGO stakeholders, will be gathered based \non existing quantitative and qualitative data.1 In line with the national and international priorities, \ni.e.  Millennium  Development  Goals  and  the  targets  sets  in  the  Afghanistan  National \nDevelopment Strategy, UNICEF\u2019s Mid-Term Strategic Plan, Advancement of Women in the UN \nSecretary  General\u2019s  Office,  and  the  MOPH  National  Health  Policy  and  Strategy  (2005\u20132009), \nthe  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  subcomponent  will  have  the  following  key  areas  of \nactivities: \n \n\n                                                 \n1   At this stage, the feasibility of carrying out a baseline survey in the project area is uncertain. It will be assessed by \n\nthe NACP and the selected international organization during project inception. \n\n \n\n\f(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n37\n\nInstitutional development of government agencies. MOPH realizes HIV/AIDS \nis  a  major  emerging  public  health  problem. 2  Thus,  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment  is  required  to  ensure  adequate  leadership,  management,  and \nmonitoring  of  the  country\u2019s  HIV  program.  While  continuous  support  may  be \nprovided  to  MOPH,  emphasis  will  be  on  developing  the  capacity  of  MPW  to \nengage  with  MOPH  and  the  NACP  in  developing  a  concerted  approach  to \nHIV/AIDS  prevention  in  transportation  and  related  road  construction.  The \ncapacity upgrading will be through technical support, sponsored exchange visits, \nand participation in international conferences and relevant venues. \n\nCapacity  development  for  local  NGOs.  This  subcomponent  will  consist  of \ntraining  of  selected  local  NGOs,  based  on  their  current  involvement  and/or \npotential  to  increase  the  outreach  and  impact  of  HIV/AIDS  prevention,  and \nmeasures  to  combat  trafficking  and  regulation  of  migration  in  the  project  area. \nThe  training  module  will  be  developed  by  the  international  organization  and \nrelevant  government  agencies,  and  provide  (i)  technical  skills  (social,  gender, \nmedical,  and  psychological  aspects  related  to  HIV/AIDS,  human  trafficking,  and \nmigration);  (ii)  administrative,  financial,  and  management  skills;  (iii)  proposal \nwriting skills, to ensure quality proposals and sustainable access to aid funding; \nand  (iv)  development  of  a  behavior  change  communication  strategy  and \nmaterials for both literate and illiterate communities.3 Upon successful completion \nof  the  training,  local  NGOs  will  be  involved  in  implementing  socioculturally \nsensitive HIV/AIDS preventative initiatives within the framework provided by other \nhealth programs, which include nutrition (i.e., breastfeeding in relation to parent-\nto-child  transmission);  maternal  health  (i.e.,  safe  blood  transfusion,  infection \nprevention measures, antenatal and postnatal care); and community-awareness. \nCondom  promotion  and  distribution  at  critical  points  and  during  the  awareness \nraising training will be supported. \n\nAwareness  and  prevention  initiatives.  Lack of awareness and low knowledge \nof  HIV/AIDS  and  STI  in  general,  and  HIV  prevention  in  particular,  is  a  reality  in \nAfghanistan.  Over  the  coming  months,  MOPH,  with  support  from  UNICEF,  will \ndevelop an evidence-based communication strategy on HIV/AIDS prevention and \ncontrol  in  Afghanistan.  The  strategy  will  be  based  on  a  desk  review,  formative \nresearch,  development  of  a  strategic  framework,  development  of  appropriate \ncommunications  materials,  pretesting  and  finalization  of  materials  based  on  the \npretesting, and preparation of detailed specifications for mass production of IEC \nmaterials.4 Awareness  and  prevention  initiatives  will  target  (i)  high-risk  groups \nincluding  injecting  drug  users  and  commercial  sex  workers,  as  well  as  young \npeople  and  adolescents;  (ii)  contractors  and  construction  workers;  and  (iii) \ncommunities  along  the  corridor  of  influence.  Briefing  sessions  for  imams  and \nmullahs  will  be  carried  out  in  the  districts,  and  opinion  leaders  and  community \nleaders  in  the  villages  and  communities.  Religious  leaders\u2019  role  in  increasing \ncommunity  awareness  of  HIV  prevention  will  be  enhanced.  Gender-relevant \naspects  of  HIV/AIDS  prevention,  such  as  counseling  for  adolescent  girls  and \nwomen, and the prevention of parent-to-child transmission will be supported.

The awareness generation will aim at \nconveying  behavioral  change  messages,  and  providing  safe  migration  tips  to \nvulnerable groups. \n\nSelection Criteria for International Organization and National NGOs \n\n \nF. \n \n7. \nInternational  Organization.  A  qualified  international  organization  will  be  recruited  for \noverall management of the HIV/AIDS and human trafficking component. Proposed activities aim \nat mitigating the risks associated with the rehabilitation of the north\u2013south corridor for high-risk \nand target groups. The international organization will be selected based on the following criteria: \n(i)  expertise  in  promoting  community-based  approaches  in  STI  prevention,  regulation  of \nmigration,  and  combating  trafficking;  (ii)  commitment  to  promoting  gender  equality  and  the \nempowerment  of  women  within  its  policy,  programs,  and  activities;  (iii)  expertise  in  providing \ncapacity building of local governments and national NGOs involved in STI prevention, regulation \nof  migration,  and  combating  trafficking;  and  (iv)  expertise  in  facilitating  and/or  promoting \nsustainable  partnership  modalities  between  government  and  civil  society  NGOs.  The \ninternational  NGO  may  subcontract  the  implementation  of  subcomponent  activities  to  local \nNGOs. \n \n8. \nNational  NGO.  To  be  eligible  for  funding,  national  NGOs  (women\u2019s  NGOs  and/or \nHIV/AIDS NGOs) must be a not-for-profit organization; be legally registered (at least 3 years) as \nan NGO in an ADB member country; have operated for at least 3 years; have a minimum of five \npaid staff; be committed to the principles of gender equality in terms of its own staffing; have a \nmanagement  or  advisory  board;  maintain  a  proper  accounting  and  financial  system;  have  a \ndemonstrated  track  record  to  promote  HIV/AIDS  prevention,  combating  trafficking,  and \nregulation  of  migration;  have  a  long-term  presence  and  credibility  in  districts  relevant  for  the \nproject  area;  have  openness  to  work  with  government  focal  agencies;  and  improve  public-\nprivate partnerships in promoting HIV/AIDS prevention, combating trafficking, and migration. \n \nG. \n \n9. \nThe  component  will  be  implemented  intermittently  over  3  years.  MOPH  will  be  the \nExecuting  Agency  and  responsible  for  overall  implementation  of  the  component.  An  MOPH \nofficial will be responsible for providing technical support for overall component implementation. \nA consultant with expertise in gender, health, and HIV/AIDS issues will be engaged for 2 years \nto assist MOPH in preparing the overall strategy, work plan, and fund utilization mechanism for \nthe  component  in  consultation  with  other  development  partners.  The  consultant  will  assist \nMOPH  in  monitoring  implementation  throughout  the  project  period.  A  qualified  international \norganization (including but not limited to international NGOs) will be engaged under the quality- \nand cost-based selection method to manage and coordinate implementation during the 3-year \nroad  rehabilitation  process.  The  international  organization  will  consult  with  MOPH  on  the \ndetailed design of the subcomponents. \n \n10. \nAt  the  central  level,  the  international  organization  will  be  responsible  for  organizing \nquarterly meetings of an advisory working group in Kabul, chaired by the director of the NACP, \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n39\n\nand include representatives from MPW; MOPH; MWA; other government agencies involved in \nHIV/AIDS,  trafficking,  and  regulation  of  migration;  and  relevant  international  organizations  and \nlocal NGOs. At the provincial level, it will be responsible for organizing quarterly meetings of an \nadvisory  working  group,  chaired  by  the  department  of  health,  and  include  local  government \nrepresentatives,  local  representatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s  Affairs,  and  community \nleaders.  Advisory  working  groups  will  provide  guidance  on  implementation  and  constitute  a \nforum  for  technical  discussions  and  mutual  update  on  ongoing  Government  and/or  aid-funded \nprograms  that  may  inform  and/or  contribute  to  focusing  the  proposed  interventions.  The  ADB \ngender specialist located in the Afghanistan Resident Mission will support implementation and \nwork in close relationship with the international organization to ensure the timely and effective \nimplementation of the subcomponent. \n \nH.  \n \n11. \nThe  NACP  is  finalizing  national  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  HIV/AIDS \nprevention  programs.  The  following  is  a  list  of  output  indicators  that  may  be  adapted,  as \nneeded, during project inception to ensure consistency with the national indicators:5 \n \n\nReporting, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nnumber of Government agencies and local NGOs trained in the project area; \nnumber  of  Behavioral  Communication  Change  (BCC)  initiatives  carried  out  and \ntarget and high-risk groups reached; \nnumber of labor skill transfer initiatives for women carried out and target groups \nreached; \nnumber of HIV testing kits, STI treatment packages, and condoms distributed; \npercentage of people seeking information on HIV/AIDS testing and counseling; \npercentage of people being tested for HIV; and \nnumber of STI patients seeking care and treatment. \n\n \nThe  international  organization  will  submit  a  detailed  work  program  1  month  after \n12. \nsignature of the contract and submit quarterly and annual reports to the NACP for transmission \nto the MPW\u2019s PMU and ADB.

The proposed corridor includes two \nsections:  Mazar-e-Sharif  (kilometer  [km]  0.00)  to  Dara-i-Suf  (km  140.30)  and  Yakawlang  (km \n0.00) to Bamian (km 98.90). Most of the two sections are gravel roads in poor condition, with the \nexception of a short section (17 km) of paved road between Mazar i Sharif and Kot Baraq.  \n\nSection1:  Mazar-e  Sharif  (km  0.00)  to  Dara-i-Suf  (km  140.30)  is  divided  in  two \n\n \n(i) \nsubpackages with the following silent features: \n \n\ntraverses \n\nMazar-e  Sharif  (km  0.00,  altitude  369  meters  [m])  to  Pul-I  Baraq  (km \n78.80,  altitude  662  m) \nflat  (60%),  rolling  (16%),  and \nmountainous  (24%)  terrain  with  six  bridges  of  total  length  168  m.  Two \nbridges need to be rehabilitated. \nPul-I Baraq (km 78.80, altitude 662 m) to Dara-i-Suf (km 140.30, altitude \n1,340  m)  traverses  flat  (24%),  rolling  (16%),  and  mountainous  (60%) \nterrain, and includes seven bridges of total length 208 m. One bypass is \nproposed in this section to avoid large scale resettlement. \n\n(ii) \nfeatures: \n\nSection  2:  Yakawlang  (km  0.00)  to  Bamian  (km  98.90)  has  the  following  silent \n\n \nYakawlang (km 0.00, altitude 2,561m) to Qarganatu (km 53.30, 3,309 m) \ntraverses  flat  (32%),  rolling  (25%),  and  mountainous  (43%)  terrain  with \nfour bridges of total length 80 m. \nQarganatu (km 53.30) to Bamian (km 98.90) traverses flat (36%), rolling \n(22%),  and  mountainous  (42%)  terrain  with  three  bridges  of  total  length \n135 m. \n \n\n2. \nProposed  Design  Standards:  Cross  Section.  The  national  highway  network  is \nplanned  to  promote  trade  and  economic  linkages;  extend  regional  highways  to  provincial \ncapitals; and contribute to peace, security, stability, economic growth, and national integration. \nMost parts of the two sections are highly prioritized due to its significant function in the national \nhighway  network.  In  flat  terrain  sections,  traffic  speed  is  expected  to  be  higher  than  on  other \nminor roads. Based on these economic and safety features, flat sections with high traffic volume \nand  in  built-up  areas  will  have  a  typical  cross  section  designed  for  two  traffic  lanes  of  3.50  m \nwide each, with two granular shoulders of 1.5 m and two verges of 0.5 m, with a total width of \n11.0 m.  \n \n3. \nIn  rolling  and  mountainous  terrain,  to  reduce  the  construction  cost  and  account  for \nslower traffic speeds, the typical cross section suggested is 9.0 m, by reducing the width of the \ncarriage way to 6.0 m and shoulder to 1.0 m. In exceptional cases where the alignment passes \nthrough  unavoidable  constrained  areas  such  as  religious  structures  or  confined  river  sides, \nreducing the carriage and shoulder width to 6.0 m and 0.50 m is recommended.  \n \n4. \nThe pavements were designed in accordance with accepted international standards and \nprocedures  for  a  15-year  life,  with  provision  for  overlays  during  or  at  the  end  of  10  years  to \ncover the serviceability loss and extend the life to 15 years, while maintaining the international \nroughness  index  at  recommended  levels.  The  designs  are  based  on  traffic  counts  and  traffic \nprojections  (for  capacity),  and  axle-load  surveys  and  projections  (for  structural  capacity). \nRoughness  values  for  the  completed  pavements,  expressed  in  international  roughness  index \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nterms, should be 2.0\u20132.5. The suggested pavement thickness includes five layers totaling 1,150 \nmillimeters  (mm):  (i)  100  mm  asphalt  layers  with  100  mm  granular  shoulder;  (ii)  250  mm \ncrushed stone base; (iii) 200 mm granular subbase; and (iv) 500 mm frost-free subgrade. \n \nGeometric  Design. The design standards proposed for the Project, in principle, follow \n5. \nAmerican  Association  of  State  Highway  and  Transportation  Official  standards.  For  different \nterrain conditions, minimum design standards corresponding to the following design speeds are \nadopted: (i) flat terrain (80 km/hour), (ii) rolling terrain (60 km/hour), and (iii) mountainous terrain \n(40 km/hour).

Once  the  current  or  planned  projects  are  completed  by  2008,  the  existing  regional \nhighway network will be improved to a two-lane bitumen-paved road standard, with certain four-\nlane  sections  near  Kabul  and  Kandahar.

Many of them \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n47\n\n \n\n \nare motorable along the greater part of their length but are impassable at specific locations such \nas  rivers  and  sections  where  severe  erosion  or  landslides  have  occurred.  Except  for  newly \nconstructed  bridges,  most  bridges  and  culverts  along  national  highways  and  provincial  roads \nare in bad condition. Many are in danger of collapse from heavily loaded vehicles or from being \nwashed away.  \n \nAnticipating  regional  highway  work  to  be  completed  by  2008,  the  Government  put  its  next \npriority  to  development  of  the  north\u2013south  corridor  and  the  east\u2013west  corridor,  which  connect \nthe  ring  road  horizontally  and  perpendicularly  and  provide  better  access  to  people  in  the \nhinterland at the center of the country.  \n \nDuring the first phase of road rehabilitation after resuming its operation in Afghanistan in 2002, \nADB  gave  its  priority  attention  to  rehabilitation of  regional highways,  particularly  the  ring  road, \nwith  emphasis  on  trade  links  to  neighboring  countries,  including  bridges,  disintegrated \npavements, drainage erosion protection, and routine maintenance. As rehabilitation of regional \nhighways is completed, ADB is placing its next priority to connection of the ring road through the \nnorth\u2013south  corridor  or  the  east\u2013west  corridor  as  recommended  by  the  road  master  plan \nprepared  with  ADB  assistance.  The  project  roads  comprise  the  north\u2013south  and  east\u2013west \ncorridor, which connect the central hinterland of Afghanistan to the major cities such as Mazar-\ne-Sharif and Kabul where the ring road passes. Bamian, the main focus of the JFPR component, \nis  renowned  for  its  abundant  historical  and  cultural  relics,  which  should  be  protected  and \npreserved.  Improved  road  connection  to  Bamian  will  generate  a  synergy  to  ongoing \ndevelopment partner activities to preserve such invaluable assets.  \n \n\n4.  \n\nInnovation  \n\n \nThere are no innovations in the design of the project in terms of poverty reduction interventions, \nbeing primarily a road construction project. However, to the extent possible, local labor will be \nused to generate local employment. \n \nImproved roads will also lead to shift from subsistence agriculture to market-based production \nenabling  farmers  to  grow  perishable  commercial  products  like  vegetables  and  fruits  allowing \nthem to transport these goods at much shorter time. The farmers in the provinces would also be \nable  to  diversify  their  cropping  patterns,  cultivate  high-value  crops,  grow  larger  marketable \nsurpluses  to  improve  their  income-earning  capacities  as  well  as  generate  more  agricultural \nwage employment, particularly benefiting the poor. \n \nImproved road conditions will lead to growth of affordable transport facilities and thus the poor, \nespecially  women  and  children,  will  have  more  reliable,  affordable,  and  timely  access  to \neducational and medical facilities. Lower transportation costs will also increase mobility among \nthe poor to find employment opportunities in other areas. Increased access to local and national \nmarkets will lead to growth of local trade, increased production activities, and reduced prices of \nagricultural commodities and other products.  \n \n\n5.  \n\nSustainability \n\n \nRoutine road maintenance expenditures are projected to increase steadily as road projects are \ncompleted,  from  $8  million  in  2006  to  $25  million  in  2015.  Periodic  maintenance  will  not  be \nrequired until 2010, when the expenditure will increase significantly to about $45 million per year \nfrom  2011  to  2015  because  the  regional  and  national  highway  projects  currently  under \nconstruction will reach the stage requiring the first periodic maintenance.  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n48 \n \nThe  most  immediate  maintenance  requirement  is  for  special  maintenance  works  on  national \nhighways and provincial roads of which maintenance has long been delayed, beginning with an \nestimated $26 million in 2006 and gradually decreasing to $14 million in 2015 as the backlog of \nwork is eliminated. Over the period of 2006\u20132015, the need for special works will decrease while \nthe  need  for  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  will  increase,  approximately  balancing  each \nother.  For  the  years  2006\u20132010,  the  average  maintenance  annual  maintenance  requirement \nincluding  routine,  periodic,  and  backlog  maintenance  ranges  from  $34  million  to  $47  million, \nwhile the same will increase to $87 million for the years of 2011\u20132015 because of the significant \nincrease of periodic maintenance. \n \nThe  expected  road  revenue,  however,  falls  far  short  of  the  required  road  maintenance \nexpenditure.  The  main  source  of  road  revenue,  road  tolls  which  the  Government  will  reinstate \nfor  rehabilitated  regional  highways,  is  expected  to  generate  $13  million\u2013$23  million  for  the \nperiod of 2006\u20132015 on the basis of the toll rate of $0.005 per passenger car equivalent per km. \nEven  considering  vehicle  registration  fees  currently  collected  and  expected  to  generate  $3 \nmillion\u2013$6 million per year for the period of 2006\u20132015, the expected road revenue will be able \nto finance around 30%50% of road maintenance requirement.  \n \nTo  relieve  the  shortfall  of  road  revenue,  The  Government  will  evaluate  other  sustainable \nmethods for revenue generation such as setting up a dedicated road maintenance fund based \non  fuel  levies,  vehicles  licensing,  and  other  road-user  related  taxes;  and  will  complete  this \nevaluation by December 2007. At present, fuel prices in Afghanistan rank among the lowest in \nthe  region  (about  $0.5 per  liter)  with  no  tax  levied  except  customs  duty  of  9%,  while  taxes  on \nfuel  in  other  countries  range  from  13%  to  70%.  Based  on  fuel  usage  and  estimated  vehicle \npopulation, the total amount of fuel used for road transport vehicles is estimated as 582 million \nliters per year, which can translate into $291 million in expenditure for fuel consumed by road \nusers. If a 10%\u201315% fuel tax is introduced, it will generate $29 million\u2013$48 million of additional \nroad  revenue,  which  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  the  shortfall  of  current  road  revenue.  The \ndevelopment partners\u2019 local consultative group, consisting of major financiers such as the World \nBank,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  and  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational Cooperation, considers introduction of fuel tax as one of its key agenda for policy \ndialogue and will continue its dialogue with the Government to secure stable financing sources \nfor sustainable road maintenance. \n \n\n6.  \n\nParticipatory Approach \n\n \nThe  project  development  and  activities  were  discussed  with  the  local  communities  during  the \nconsultation  meetings  at  various  project  locations.  The  discussions  were  held  with  all  the \nprimary  stakeholders  and  the  secondary  stakeholders  including  the  local  administration,  Land \nAsset  Agriculture  Department,  etc.  and  with  various  other  international  and  local  agencies \ninvolved  with  the  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  in  Afghanistan.  The  directly  affected \npopulations  were  consulted  to  understand  their  concerns  regarding  the  road  construction  and \ngather  suggestions  on  the  types  of  mitigation  measures  that  should  be considered  to  address \nthe envisaged impacts. The consultations and discussions with the project affected people will \nthe  project.  During \nbe  a  continuing  activity \nimplementation, MPW will be assisted in conducting the consultations by the NGO that will be \ncontracted  for  resettlement  plan  implementation.  A  summary  of  the  resettlement  plan  and  the \nentitlement  matrix  will  be  translated  into  the  local  language  (Dari)  and  disclosed  to  affected \npersons  and  made  available  in  local  MPW  offices,  Afghanistan  Resident  Mission,  and  ADB \nwebsite. The NGO will keep the affected people informed about the impacts, compensation, and \nassistance  proposed  for  them;  and  facilitate  addressing  any  grievances  among  the  project \naffected people. The affected persons will participate in all the decisions and implementation of \n\nimplementation  stage  of \n\nthroughout \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n49\n\n \n\n \nresettlement  plan;  and  be  involved  in  the  grievance  redress  committee  to  review  and  resolve \nany dispute concerning compensation and other resettlement benefits. There will be continuous \non-site consultation during the implementation stage to ensure that those affected receive their \ndue  entitlements/benefits,  particularly  the  direct  benefits  they  can  reap  by  being  hired  as \nconstruction workers. Resettlement impact was fully assessed and a full resettlement plan was \nprepared as part of the main project. \n\n \n\n7.  \n\nCoordination \n\n \nThe  ring  road  is  being  rehabilitated  with  financial  and  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  bilateral \nand  multilateral  funding  agencies.  The  Government  of  Japan  and  USAID  provided  support  for \nrehabilitation of Kabul\u2013Kandahar road. USAID, Government of Japan, and Government of Saudi \nArabia provided financing for rehabilitating the Kandahar\u2013Herat road. The World Bank and the \nIslamic Development Bank provided support for rehabilitation of the Kabul\u2013Doshi-Pul-e-Khumri \nroad  including  repair  of  Salang  tunnel.  ADB\u2019s  Emergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  and \nReconstruction Project1 finances rehabilitation of the road from Pul-e-Khumri via Mazar-e-Sharif \nto  Andkhuouy.  For  the  Herat\u2013Andkhuouy  section,  Iran  provided  support  for  the  Herat\u2013Armalik \nroad, while ADB provided support for the Ankhoy\u2013Bala Murghab road. The remaining 183 km of \nArmalik\u2013Bala  Murghab  will  be  rehabilitated  with  support  from  Saudi  Arabia  and  the  Islamic \nDevelopment Bank.  \n \nIn 2004, ADB provided TA for preparation of a road master plan to develop a road development \nprogram  for  the  next  5\u201310  years.  The  program  is  to  provide  efficient  and  effective  road \nrehabilitation focusing on identifying major east\u2013west and north\u2013south corridors to cross-link the \nring road. The TA will also assess financing requirements for sustainable road maintenance and \npropose desirable and sustainable financing mechanisms. ADB\u2019s next  phase of assistance for \nroad rehabilitation will be based on the road development program of the TA; the World Bank \nhas no road improvement program in the pipeline as the ring road is completed. \n \nThe  proposal  was  fully  discussed  with  the  Embassy  of  Japan  in  Kabul  (Junichi  Sumi,  head, \nEconomics Section), which expressed strong support for JFPR funding for the proposal. JICA in \nKabul  (Shigehiko  Sugita,  assistant  resident  representative)  also  expressed  support  for  the \nproposal.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2003.

Roads \nare needed to rebuild the economy by establishing major economic linkages both domestically \nas  well  as  with  neighboring  countries.  The  strategic  framework  for  the  rehabilitation, \nreconstruction, and development of the road sector consists of the following elements: (i) policy \nand  institutional  development;  (ii)  capacity  building;  (iii)  private  sector  development;  (iv) \nemployment  generation; \n(vi)  decentralization  of  network \nmanagement;  (vii)  sustainable  sector  financing  and  cost  recovery;  (viii)  protection  and \npreservation  of  environment;  (ix)  avoiding  and  mitigating  resettlement;  (x)  absorbing  returnee \nrefugees,  ex-combatants,  and  women  in  road  construction  and  maintenance;  and  (xi) \ninvolvement of the NGO community in road construction and maintenance \n \n\n(v)  community  participation; \n\nDuring the first phase of road rehabilitation after resuming its operation in Afghanistan in 2002, \nADB  gave  its  priority  attention  to  rehabilitation of  regional highways,  particularly  the  ring  road, \nwith  emphasis  on  trade  links  to  neighboring  countries,  including  bridges,  disintegrated \npavements, drainage erosion protection, and routine maintenance. As rehabilitation of regional \nhighways completes, ADB gives its next priority to connection of the ring road through the north-\nsouth  corridor  or  the  east-west  corridor  as  recommended  by  the  road  master  plan  which  is \nunder  preparation  by  ADB\u2019s  assistance.  This  is  also  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  priority \ninvestment projects identified for the transport national program. Further, ADB\u2019s assistance for \nroads  rehabilitation  will  include  capacity  building.  As  recommended  by  the  road  master  plan, \nADB\u2019s approach to road planning and design will take into account the subregional links, which \nwill demand a higher standard than would be the case if roads were for the use of Afghanistan \nalone.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n51\n\n \n\nDocument \nNumber \n\nDate of Last \nDiscussion \n\n \n\n \n\nObjective(s) \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nDocument \n\nCountry \nStrategy and \nProgram \nUpdate \n2006\u20132008 \n \n\n2.  \n\nLinkage to Specific ADB-Financed Operation \n\nProject Name \n\nProject Number \n\nDate of Board Approval \n\n37075 \n\n \n\nNorth\u2013South Corridor Project \n\nLoan and Grant Amount ($ million) \n\n78.2 for loan and 40.0 for grant \n\n3.  \n\nDevelopment Objective of the Associated ADB-Financed Operation  \n\n \n \n \nThe Project will help the Government to promote economic and social development and reduce \npoverty by rehabilitating the national highway network which will connect the central hinterland \nof Afghanistan to the ring road. The proposed JFPR grant will finance the Bamian\u2013Yakawlang \nroad which constitutes the north\u2013south corridor, a key connection route of the central hinterland \nto the ring road.  \n \n \n \n\nList the Main Components of the Associated ADB-Financed Operation  \n\n4.  \n\nNo. \n1. \n\nComponent Name \n\nLand Acquisition and \nResettlement  \n\n2. \n\nCivil Works \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nCross-Border Facilities \n\nHIV/AIDS and Anti-Human \nTrafficking Awareness Campaign \n\nProject Management and \nMonitoring \n\nIncremental Project Management \nSupport \n\nBrief Description \n1.1 212.6 hectares (ha) of land, out of which 162 ha is \nbarren unproductive (government owned) land and \nremaining (50.6 ha) is privately owned agricultural land \n($1 million). \n1.2 Resettlement and relocation of 2,583 affected \nhouseholds ($1 million) \n2.1 Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf Road of 140.3 km ($54.2 \nmillion) \n2.2 Bamian\u2013Yakawlang Road of 98.9 km ($48.2 million)\nInstallation of cross- border customs facilities in the \nborder point of Spin Boldak ($4 million) \nOrientation and sensitization of project-related people \non HIV/AIDS and human trafficking and public \nawareness campaign ($1.5 million) \nConstruction supervision consultants and procurement \nmanagement consultants ($5.4 million) \n\nEngagement of external auditors and payment of \nadditional salary to executing agency staff assigned to \nproject management unit and the consultant team ($1.2 \nmillion) \n\n \n\n\f52 \n \n\n7. \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nContingencies \n\n8. \n\nInterest during Grace Period \n\nPhysical contingencies computed at 15% for civil works \nand installation of cross-border facilities and price \ncontingencies computed at 1.9% on foreign exchange \nand local currency cost ($19.6 million) \nCapitalization of interest incurred 10-year grace period \n($4.8 million) \n\n5.  \n\nRationale for Grant Funding versus ADB Lending \n\n \n \n \nThe  ADF  resources  allocated  to  the  North\u2013South  Corridor  Project  are  $118.2  million.  The \nproject was supposed to finance only a part of Bamian\u2013Yakawlang road because of insufficient \nproject budget. During the fact-finding of the project, the Embassy of Japan in Kabul expressed \ntheir interest to participate in rehabilitation of Bamian\u2013Yakawlang road with $20 million of JFPR. \nAccordingly, the scope of rehabilitation of Bamian\u2013Yakawlang road was expanded to cover the \ncomplete stretch of road with the increased project budget.  \n \nD.  \n \n\nImplementation of the Proposed Grant \n\n1.  \n\nImplementing Agency:   Ministry of Public Works  \n\n \nProcurement  of  goods,  services,  and  civil  works  to  be  financed  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006). Civil works contracts \nwill  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB).  A  single-stage  two-envelope \nprocedure  with  no  separate  prequalification  will  be  used.  Equipment  for  cross-border  facilities \nwill  be  procured  by  limited  international  bidding.  All  international  procurements  will  be \nundertaken  by \nthe  Afghanistan \nthe  Government  procurement  unit  operating  under \nReconstruction and Development Services. \n \nThe project area is located in the western part of the country, where ADB nonmember countries, \nparticularly  those  in  the  Gulf  region,  provide  competitive  sources  of  materials,  especially \nbitumen required for road pavement. Explicit procurement restrictions may preclude civil works \ncontractors  under  the  Project  from  seeking  the  best  business  terms,  and  ultimately  erode \neconomic efficiency. To maximize the Project\u2019s development impact and economic efficiency, it \nis  proposed  that  civil  works  contractors  under  the  Project  be  allowed  to  procure  the  bitumen \nrequired  for  road  pavement  from  all  countries,  including  from  countries  that  are  not  ADB \nmembers. 2  This  special  treatment  was  applied  to  three  previous  transport  projects  in \nAfghanistan,  i.e.,  the  Regional  Airports  Rehabilitation  Project,  the  Andkhuouy\u2013Qaisar  Road \nProject, both approved in 2004, and Qaisar\u2013Bala Murghab Road Project approved in 2005. \n \nAll  consultants  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.   \n \n  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2   This is pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the ADB Charter, which provides that the Board may, by a vote of the directors \nrepresenting  not  less  than  two  thirds  of  the  total  voting  power  of  the  members,  agree  to  permit  in  special \ncircumstances procurement from non-ADB member countries \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n2.  \n\nRisks Affecting Grant Implementation \n\nType of Risk \nSecurity  \n\nBrief Description \n\nThe overall political and security \nsituation remains volatile \n\nImproved roads can be used as a route \nto transport opium \n\nImproved connectivity can contribute \nthe spread of HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking  \nImplementation of key activities may be \ndelayed. \n\nWeak  Capacity  of \nGovernment \n\nGovernment\u2019s \ncounterpart \ncontribution \n\nThe Government might have difficulty in \nmeeting in a timely manner its Project \ncost obligations such as operating and \nmaintenance costs and counterpart \nfunding.  \n\n3.  \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nKey Performance Indicator \n\nReporting Mechanism \n\nA 50% increase in production and \ntrade of major farm products in the \nproject areas over 3 years of project \ncompletion \n \n \n\nNational,  provincial,  and district \nfrom \nsocioeconomic  statistics \nthe Central Statistics Office  \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB) project performance \naudit report  \n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n53\n\n \n\nMeasure to Mitigate the Risk \nADB will closely monitor the situation \nand coordinate with local and central \nauthorities and the UN to ensure \nadequate protection.3 ADB\u2019s TA for \nthe Security of ADB-Financed \nProjects in Afghanistan will provide \nadvice on how to ensure a safe work \nenvironment for on-site personnel \nassigned by the contractors, \nsubcontractors, and consulting firms.  \nThe Government will improve, as part \nof the national counternarcotics \nstrategy, border procedures to \ncontain the trafficking of narcotics. \nThe  Project\u2019s  HIV/AIDS  prevention \nand anti human trafficking component \nwill promote public awareness. .  \nResources will be allocated for \nconsulting services to help with \nproject management and \nimplementation.

Currently the country\u2019s \nroad  network  comprises  regional  highways  (ring  roads  and  links  to  neighboring  countries)  and  several  national \nhighways. However, no roads connect the central region from the north to south, which has resulted in traffic having to \nuse a circuitous route. This increases both travel distance and travel time. Thus the construction of a north\u2013south link \nroad  will reduce travel distance and time, and promote economic growth in the region. The inadequate road system \nkeeps  many  farmers  dependent  on  subsistence  agriculture  with  no,  or  limited,  access  to  markets,  education,  and \nhealth  care.  The  project  roads  run  through  the  remotest  and  least  developed  areas  of  the  country.  Portions  of  the \nexisting road are paved but most is merely mud truck tracks where most of the sections easily turn impassable after \nthe  rains.  Rehabilitating  and  improving  the  north\u2013south  link  will  also  contribute  to  employment  creation,  income \ngeneration  for  poor  households,  and  rehabilitation  of  internally  and/or  internationally  displaced  persons  and  ex-\ncombatants, thus reducing the incidence of poverty in the project area. \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                        Poverty Classification: General intervention \n \nIn Afghanistan, nearly 53% of the population are classified as poor1 and live on less than $1 a day. The project road \npasses  through  the  provinces  of  Balkh,  Samangan,  and  Bamian  and  will  benefit  a  total  population  of  1,735,800.2. \nBefore  the  war,  these  provinces  were  known  for  their  agriculture,  livestock,  handicrafts,  and  carpets  industry.  The \nexisting  road  condition  is  the  biggest  constraint  as  people  are  unable  to  transport  their  products  to  markets  and \ncurrently crops are grown  only  on a small scale,  which is enough for household consumption. Irrigation facilities are \nlimited and few farmers still cultivate poppies to increase their income. Poverty in these provinces is estimated at 60%, \nwith  most  of  the  population  living  in  mud  houses  (80\u201395%)  and  the  majority  of  households  living  without  electricity, \nclean  water,  proper  sanitation  facilities,  and  garbage  disposal.  As  per  the  data  available,  only  10%\u201311%  of  the \nhouseholds in these three provinces have access to clean water; only 10% in Balkh province have a garbage disposal \nsystem. The social assessment indicates that the population living along the proposed alignment is generally poor with \nabout 48% having an annual income of less than $600 with an average household size of 9. The survey also indicates \nthat  75%  are  engaged  in  subsistence  agriculture  and  allied  activities  for  their  livelihood,  while  the  rest  have  small \nbusinesses in the town areas.  \n \nAfghanistan  ranks  4th  highest  for  under-5  mortality  rate  at  257  deaths/1,000;  the  infant  mortality  rate  is  at  a  high \n165/1,000.  Among  the  three  provinces  Balkh  has  four  hospitals,  Samangan  has  only  one  provincial  hospital,  and \nBamian  has  only  one  district  hospital  with  a  limited  number  of  beds  to  cater  to  the  entire  population.  The  survey \nreveals that the local population in these provinces has to use private transport facilities to reach the hospitals, which \nis expensive due to poor road conditions and limited availability. Due to poor road conditions, some emergency cases \ncould not reach the hospitals on time. Apart from difficulty accessing district and provincial hospitals, people travelled \n1\u20132 hours on foot to reach the nearest health center. Malnutrition among children is very common in the project area, \nwhile  adults  and  children  also  suffer  from  diseases  like  malaria,  diarrhoea,  and  bronchitis  due  to  the  unclean \nenvironment resulting from lack of clean water and air pollution. Lack of adequate and accessible educational facilities \nis another major problem in the project area. Although, the provinces have primary and secondary schools, only the \npopulation living near the towns send their children to school, while children living in smaller settlements are deprived \nof  schooling  due  to  poor  road  conditions  and  lack  of  transport  facilities.  Some  schools  lack  proper  buildings  and \nteaching equipment. Poor road conditions and accessibility also constrain teachers and health personnel from working \nin this region.  \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006): Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Manila. \n2   Central Statistics Office Afghanistan, 2003. \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nThe  Project  will  lead  to  direct  and  indirect  poverty  reduction  impacts.  The  direct  poverty  impact  will  be  on  income \ngeneration and demand for unskilled labor and wages accruing during construction of the project road. Other benefits \nwill be lower travel time and travel costs, and higher agricultural product profit margins. Improved roads will lead to a \nshift  from  subsistence  agriculture  to  market-based  production  enabling  farmers  to  grow  perishable  commercial \nproducts  like  vegetables  and  fruits  that  they  can  transport  to  market  more  quickly.  The  farmers in  the  provinces  will \nalso  be  able  to  diversify  their  cropping  patterns;  cultivate  high-value  crops;  grow  larger  marketable  surpluses  to \nimprove their income-earning capacities; and generate more agricultural wage employment, particularly benefiting the \npoor. Road improvement will facilitate revival of the carpet and handicraft industry in the region, especially benefiting \npoor women by increasing their income. Improved road conditions will lead to growth of affordable transport facilities \nand thus the poor, especially women and children will have more reliable, affordable, and timely access to educational \nand  medical  facilities.  Lower  transportation  costs  will  increase  mobility  among  the  poor  to  find  employment \nopportunities  in  other  areas.  Increased  access  to  local  and  national  markets  will  lead  to  growth  of  local  trade  and \nproduction activities, and reduced prices of agricultural commodities and other products. The benefit of the improved \nroad  in  terms  of  reduction  of  vehicle-operating  costs  will  not  only  be  transferred  to  road  users  but  will  decrease  the \nchances of accident deaths and disabilities that result from extremely poor road conditions. Thus increased economic \nactivity and easy access to social services are expected to significantly increase household incomes and quality of life, \nthereby reducing the overall poverty incidence.  \n \nThe Project proposes to utilize, to the extent possible, labor-intensive construction methods to provide much-needed \nemployment  and  income-generation  opportunities  during  project  implementation,  and  use  the  services  of  the  local \npopulation  for  postconstruction  maintenance  activities.  It  will  contribute  to  social  stability  and  poverty  reduction  by \nengaging, among others, refugees and ex-combatants. Thus, the investment is expected to significantly improve the \nsocioeconomic situation and mitigate the pervasive poverty spread in the project area. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe  Project  has  identified  and  consulted  with  both  primary  and  secondary  stakeholders.  During  social  analysis \nextensive  consultations  were  carried  out  with  the  local  people  (men  and  women),  road  users,  truck  drivers,  vehicle \noperators, shop owners, farmers, traders, nongovernment organizations in the prominent towns, villages in the project \ninfluence area to ascertain their response to the construction of road, and their needs and demands from the Project. \nApart from the public meetings, focus group discussions were organized with the young, old, men, and women from \ndifferent  occupations  and  population  groups  to  ensure  a  comprehensive  perspective  on  the  Project  as  well  as  its \nimpacts.  All  those  consulted  had  positive  reactions  toward  the  Project  and  welcomed  the  benefits  that  improved \naccess and/or road conditions  would provide. They also emphasized that households that  will be adversely  affected \nshould be compensated by the Project for their losses, so that they are able to reestablish their livelihoods and take \nadvantage of road improvement.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \n\n  Yes \n  Yes \n\n  No \n  No \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen in Afghanistan are generally denied inheritance rights, adequate food and nutrition, choice of education, and \nparticipation  in  the  decision-making  process  of  household  economic  activities.  They  lack  authority  to  the  resources \nand  power  to  decision-making  in  major  household  and  other  economic  activities.  However,  with  the  appreciation  for \neducation  for  women  and  changing  socioeconomic  realities,  especially  due  to  the  increased  number  of  women \nheading households, as a consequence to loss of male members, the role of women in economic activities is slowly \nbeginning  to  be  recognized.  The  role  of  the  women  in  the  project  area  is  mostly  limited  to  household  activities  as \nmothers and housewives, and helping the family in farming activities. They are also seen traveling 1\u20132 km distances \nto  local  markets  to  purchase  households  items,  collect  drinking  water  from  wells  or  rivers,  and  collect  wood  or  fuel. \nThe women in the project influence area are also engaged in carpet making. The road improvement will facilitate the \nrevival  of  the  carpet  and  handicraft  industry,  thus  allowing  women  to  increase  their  income-earning  capacities.  The \nProject will provide benefits to women in the form of reduced travel times and transport costs, resulting in more cash \nincome  for  the  household.  Although,  women  will  not  benefit  from  employment  opportunities  working  on  the \nconstruction of the highway, but with increased transportation facilities women and children will find it easier to reach \nschools, clinics, hospitals, markets, and if needed to district and provincial capitals. \n \n\n \n\n\f \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \n\nItem \n\n \n\n \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n Significant \n\nResettlement \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n63\n\nPlan \nRequired \n\n \n\n \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n \n\nOverall, the land acquisition and resettlement impact for the \nProject  will  be  significant.  The  total  land  requirement  has \nbeen estimated to be  212.6  hectares (ha),  of  which  162 ha \nis  barren  unproductive  land  and  the  remainder  (50.6  ha)  is \nprivately  owned  agricultural  land.  Although  most  of  the \nimprovement  works  will  be  carried  out  within  the  existing \nright-of-way,  a  narrow  strip  of  agricultural  land  to  be \nacquired  will  affect  about  1,515  households  who  will  lose  a \nportion of their total agricultural landholding and 4,000 wood \ntrees.  On  average,  the  agricultural  households  would  lose \n0.028\u20130.008  hectares.  Nearly  59  households  will  lose  a \nportion  of  their  residential  structure,  of  these  only  8 \nhouseholds  will  require  relocation.  About  141  households \noperating  roadside  shops/small  businesses  will  be  affected \nwith  the  majority  losing  extended  areas;  23  households  will \nrequire  relocation.  No  common  property  resources  or \nreligious  structures  will  be  affected  but  110  employees  and \n785  sharecroppers  will  suffer  temporary  income  losses. \nOverall the Project  will affect 2,583 households and 21,517 \npeople. \n\n \nBoth  rich  and  poor  will  benefit  from  improved  access  to \nmarkets  and  better  quality  of  goods.  The  local  population \ncan have better access to district and provincial capitals with \nno additional cost to them. The reduction in travel time and \ntransport  costs  will  result  in  reduction  of  transport  service \ncharges and thus improve affordability of transport services \nin the project area thereby benefiting the poor. \n \nNo job losses will occur. The Project is expected to generate \nemployment  opportunities  for  local  communities  during  the \nconstruction  phase,  and  thereafter  for  maintenance.  The \nProject  will  utilize  labor-intensive  construction  methods  to \nprovide  employment  and  income  generation  opportunities. \nEfforts will be made to engage, among others, refugees and \nex-combatants.  \n \nSocial  analysis  found  no  indigenous  people  in  the  project \narea. \n\nThe social analysis did not record any other risks, including \nthat  of  human  trafficking,  sexually  transmitted  disease,  or \nHIV/AIDS.  However,  considering  the  possible  risks  of \nHIV/AIDS  transmission  and  human  trafficking  in  the  long \nterm,  an  HIV/AIDS  and  human \ntrafficking  awareness \nstrategy  has  been  prepared.  Apart  from  this,  a  suitable \nclause  in  the  civil  works  contracts  requiring  the  contractors \nto  conduct \ninformation,  education,  and  communication \nactivities  related  to  HIV/AIDS  for  their  employees  will  be \nincluded. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n \nAffordability \n\n \n \nLabor \n\n \n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n \nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n\nProject Description and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe road section, from Mazar-e-Sharif (kilometer [km] 0.00) to Dar I Suf (km 140.30) \nis located in the two provinces of Balkh and Samanyan,  while the section from Yakawlang \n(km  0.00)  to  Bamian  (km  98.90)  traverses  only  through  Bamian  province.  The  first  78  km \nroad section from Mazar-e-Sharif to Pul-e-Baraq passes mostly through flat terrain while the \nremaining portion until Dar I Suf is mostly mountainous. The road section from Yakawlang to \nBamian  is  mostly  rolling  and  mountainous.  The  Project  envisages  improving  the  existing \nroad to a well-designed, paved two-lane highway; and building bridges, culverts, and other \nstructures for safe passage of traffic along the road. \n \nMost of the road improvement work will be carried out within the existing right-of-way, \n2. \nexcept  for  a  narrow  strip  of  agricultural  land.  The  study  covered  a  15  meter  (m)  width \nrequired to establish a corridor of impact.1 All the structures and land within this width were \nexamined and a census of the people affected by the Project and an assets inventory were \ncarried out. In addition, a poverty and social assessment (based on a socioeconomic survey \nsimultaneous  with  the  census  and  assets  inventory)  and  public  consultations  were  carried \nout  along  the  project  road. While  finalizing  the road  alignment,  efforts were  made  to  adopt \nappropriate  engineering  designs \nimpacts.  To  minimize \ndisplacement  and  reduce  disruption  of  livelihoods,  one-side  widening  in  village  and \ncongested sections and a 1.2 km bypass is proposed at Sholgara bazaar (Mazar-e-Sharif to \nDara-i-Suf road section) to avoid nearly 398 small shops/businesses. The resettlement plan \naddresses the impact and outlines the measures, including resettlement of people affected \nin  accordance  with  the  involuntary  resettlement  policy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB).2 The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) will be the Executing Agency for the Project.  \n \nB. \n \nThis  resettlement  plan  is  designed  to  address  adverse  impacts  of  the  Project.  It \n3. \nprovides  an  analysis  of  the  impacts,  identifies  the  nature  and  types  of  losses,  and \nestablishes an entitlement matrix as a guide to payments of compensation and resettlement \nbenefits.  It  also  contains  a  budget,  institutional  arrangement  for  implementing  the \nresettlement plan, implementation framework, and monitoring arrangements.  \n\nObjectives of the Resettlement Plan \n\nto  minimize \n\nresettlement \n\nSurveys and Data Analysis  \n\nC. \n \nResults of the investigations, surveys, and the social impacts are presented in Table \n4. \nA12.1.

About   \n4,000 ordinary wood trees are used for fuel. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nThe total land requirement for the Project is estimated to be 212.6 hectares (ha), of \n5. \nwhich 162 ha is barren unproductive (government-owned) land and the remaining (50.6 ha) \nis privately owned agricultural land. Although most of the improvement works will be carried \nout  within  the  existing  right-of-way,  a  narrow  strip  of  agricultural  land  will  be  acquired \naffecting about 1,515 households who will lose a portion of their total agricultural landholding \nand  4,000  wood  trees.  Nearly  47%  of  the  agricultural  households  own  less  than  0.4047 \nhectare of land, 31% own 1 acre, and the remaining 22% own 0.6 hectare. On average, the \nhouseholds  will  lose  0.028\u20130.008  hectare  of  agricultural  land.  All  the  1,515  households \nlosing  agricultural  land  are  titleholders,  while  about  785  leaseholders/sharecroppers  are \ncultivating their land. The agricultural landowners did not have any legal document to prove \ntheir  ownership,  however  consultation  with  the  district  offices  revealed  that  the  prolonged \nwar  situation  in  the  country  destroyed  the  land  records  but  the  titleholder/owners  can  be \nverified by the community people, government officials, and the political leaders of the area.  \n \n6. \nNearly 59 households will lose a portion of their residential structure (primarily walls \nand  gardens),  of  which  only  8  households  will  require  relocation  and  the  remaining  can \nrebuild their residences on the existing land. Adequate land is available in the villages of Sar \nAsya  and  Taiboti  for  these  8  households  to  relocate.  All  the  households  losing  their \nresidential structure were titleholders. Most of the residential structures (52) are mud houses \nwith  thatched  roofs,  while  the  remaining  7  are  temporary  structures/tents.  About  141 \nhouseholds  operating  roadside  shops/small  businesses  will  be  affected  with  the  majority \nlosing their extended sections and can push back within their own land; 23 households will \nrequire  relocation.  Adequate  land  is  available  on  the  existing  right-of-way  for  these  23 \nshops/households to relocate. The majority (136) of the shops are semipermanent in nature. \nAmong  the  141  households  about  83  are  tenants.  No  common  property  resources  or \nreligious structures will be affected, but 110 employees will suffer temporary income losses. \nApart from these losses nearly 8 km of irrigation channels will be affected due to acquisition \nof agricultural land; they can be diverted and rebuilt. \n \nIn  terms  of  the  occupational  profile  of  the  affected  households,  68%  work  in \n7. \nagriculture, 7% as wage earners, 12% in business, and the remaining are engaged in other \nallied  agricultural  activities.  The  average  household  size  of  affected  households  is  nine. \nAmong the affected households, 27% had an annual income of less than $500, 50% had an \nannual income between $501 and $800, and the remaining had between $801 and $1,100. \nAbout 774 households can be considered as poor, i.e., living below the poverty line, and of \nthese,  155  are  households  headed  by  women.  In  Afghanistan,  the  main  ethnic  groups  are \nAimaqs,  Pushtoons,  Tajik,  Turkoman,  and  Uzbek.  Nearly  62%  of  the  affected  households \nare  Hazaras,  15%  are  Sadat, 14%  are  Pushtoons, 8%  are  Uzbeks,  and 1%  are Tajiks.  All \nthese  ethnic  groups  speak  their  own  language  and  coexist  in  the  same  village.  The  social \nassessment  did  not  identify  any  differential  impacts  among  these  ethnic  groups,  as  all  will \nbenefit equally in terms of access to social and economic services by the improved road.  \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nGender issues \n\nCompensation and Relocation Options \n\nD. \n \n8. \nThe  women  of  the  affected  families  are  generally  housewives.  Gender  is  a  mute \nissue in the project area, that is, nobody discusses it. The women\u2019s role is mostly limited to \nhousehold  activities  as  mothers  and  housewives  and  helping  the  family  with  farming \nactivities.  The  road  improvement  will  facilitate  the  revival  of  the  carpet  and  handicraft \nindustry, thus allowing women to increase their income-earning capacities. The Project will \nprovide benefits to women in the form of reduced travel times and transport costs, resulting \nin more cash income for the household. Although women will not benefit from employment \nopportunities working on construction of the highway, with increased transportation facilities \nwomen and children will more easily reach schools, clinics, hospitals, markets, and if needed \ndistrict and provincial capitals. The Project  will adversely affect 401 households headed by \nwomen, of which 390 will lose agricultural land, 6 will lose a residential structure, and 5 will \nlose their shops. \n \nE. \n \nAll  the  affected  households  opted  for  cash  compensation  at  market/replacement \n9. \nvalue.  The  8  households  losing  residential  structures  and  23  losing  shops  (having  to \nrelocate) also opted for self relocation and wanted compensation to be paid at replacement \nvalue. In terms of livelihood losses of the agricultural households, shop owners, employees, \nand sharecroppers will be transitional in nature as the majority will be able to reestablish in \nthe same location. Similarly the tenants can continue to live in the existing premises. Thus \nthe  affected  households  will  be  supported  for  their  livelihood  losses  during  the  transitional \nphase, and provided with rental assistance and shifting assistance for transportation of the \nsalvageable  materials.  All  land  acquisition  payments  and  assistance  will  be  paid  to  those \naffected  at  least  3  month\u2019s  prior  to  relocation  and  will  be  completed  before  possession  of \nland and other assets. \n \nF. \n  \n10. \nThe  policy  framework  is  based  on  laws  and  practices  of  the  Government  of \nAfghanistan  and  ADB  requirements.  The  resettlement  entitlement  matrix  (Table  A12.2) \nrecognizes  different  types  of  losses  associated  with  dislocation  and  resettlement.  These \ninclude  the  loss  of  agricultural  land,  and  residential  and  commercial  structures.  The  land \nacquisition at the identified places will be carried out based on the Land Acquisition Law of \nAfghanistan  (2000).  As  per  the  current  practice,  the  compensation  is  provided  as  per \ngovernment  rate  determined  by  the  legally  constituted  committee.  If  land  and  property  is \nacquired,  the  owner  receives  the  (i)  value  of  the  land,  (ii)  value  of  residential  houses  and \nbuildings,  and  (iii)  value  of  trees  and  orchards  and  other  assets  on  the  land.  The  act  also \nstates that the person who loses a residential land plot will receive a new plot of land of the \nsame  value.  If  they  wish  they  can  get  a  residence  or  house  on  government  property  in \nexchange  under  proper  procedures.  Thus,  under  the  existing  land  acquisition  law  when \nprivate  landholdings  are  acquired  for  public  purposes,  compensation  is  paid  to  the  owner \nbased  on  the  category  and  location  of  the  land,  and  the  value  of  land  for  compensation  is \ndetermined by the Council of Ministers. The decision is based on the recommendation of a \ncommittee  consisting  of  the  following  (i)  the  landlord  or  person  who  uses  the  land  or  their \nrepresentatives, (ii) official representative of the agency that needs to acquire the land (e.g., \nMinistry  of  Public  Works),  (iii)  representative  of  the  local  municipality,  (iv)  representative  of \nthe Ministry of Finance, and (v) representative of the Ministry of Justice. The land acquisition \nprocess  is  initiated  with  the  constitution  of  the  committee.  As  land  is  acquired  for  a  public \npurpose,  the  law  apparently  does  not  entertain  any  objection  to  the  acquisition  of  an \nindividual\u2019s property. However, if any dissatisfaction arises with the acquisition, which mostly \nrelates to the value of compensation, the committee inquires into the matter and arrives at a \nsolution. The whole process is based on a negotiated approach and as the affected person \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlement Matrix \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n67\n\nis  also  a  member  of  this  legally  constituted  committee,  a  consensus  is  reached  on  the \nreplacement value of the land and assets lost. The committee thus also performs the tasks \nof  a  grievance  redress  committee.  Once  the  value  of  a  piece  of  land  to  be  acquired  is \nsuccessfully negotiated, the land acquisition process is completed within 3 months. As part \nof  the  survey,  an  assessment  was  also  carried  out  on  the  present  market  price  of  land. \nHowever,  the  market  for  land  sale  and  purchase  in  the  rural  areas  is  limited  and  most \naffected households or the shop owners do not know the present market price.  \n \n11. \nPeople  affected  will  receive  replacement  value  for  the  property  and  other  physical \nassets,  based  on  the  assessment  of  the  legally  constituted  committee  for  land  acquisition \nand valuation of the structures. Those affected will be allowed to salvage whatever material \nis  useful  after  demolition  to  rebuild  their  structures.  In  the  case  of  agricultural  land,  the \naffected  farmers  will  be  given  an  appropriate  time  frame  to  harvest  the  standing  crops  (if \nany)  or  be  compensated  for  the  crop  as  per  market  value.  The  households  requiring \nrelocation will be assisted by the government in identifying alternate land for relocation and \nbe provided basic facilities in the new site if required. If the people are not able to establish \nthe title of the land or the structure they are utilizing, those affected identified at the time of \nthe census will be legally noticed as the occupiers of the land or structure and considered for \ncompensation and assistance under this Project.  \n \n\nItem \n\nApplication \n\nEntitlement \n\nTable A12.2: Resettlement Entitlement Matrix \n \n\nDefinition of \nAffected People \n \nOwner(s): a person \nwith ownership \ncertificate of land \n \nOwner(s): a person \nwithout ownership \ncertificate but \nidentified by the \ncensus \n\nOwners of crops/ \nsharecroppers \n\nLoss of \nagricultural land \n\nLand affected \nby right-of-way \n(ROW) \n\nLoss of crops \nand trees \n\nStanding crops \non land \naffected by \nROW \n\nLoss of \nresidential land \nand structure  \n\nResidential \nland and \nstructure on \nROW \n\nOwner(s) of \nresidential land \nand structures \n\nLoss of \ncommercial land \nand structure  \n\nCommercial \nland/ structure \non ROW \n\nOwners of \ncommercial \nstructure \n\nExpected \nResults \n\nCompensation \nfor lost land  \n\nCompensation \nfor standing \ncrops and trees \n\nCompensation \nfor lost land and \nreconstruction of \nstructure \n\nCompensation \nfor lost land and \nreconstruction of \nstructure \n\n(cid:131)  Cash compensation at \n\nreplacement/market value \n\n(cid:131)  All fees, taxes, and other charges, \nas applicable under relevant laws \nincurred in the relocation and \nresource establishment are to be \nborne by the Project \nTransitional allowance for \nlivelihood losses at AF2,500 for 3 \nmonths \n\n(cid:131) \n\n(cid:131)  Advance notice to harvest crops \n(cid:131)  Grant equal to market value of \n\ncrop lost plus cost of replacement \nof seeds for the next season \n(cid:131)  Compensation for trees based on \n\nmarket price  \n\n(cid:131)  Cash compensation at \n\nreplacement/market value for \nresidential land and structure \nwithout depreciation \n\n(cid:131)  Right to salvage materials from \nthe demolished structure \n(cid:131)  Shifting assistance of AF2,000 a \n(cid:131) \nLump sum temporary disruption \nallowance of AF2,500 a \n(cid:131)  Cash compensation at \n\nreplacement / market value for \ncommercial land and structure \nwithout depreciation \n\n(cid:131)  Right to salvage materials from \nthe demolished structure \n\n(cid:131)  Shifting assistance of AF2,000 a. \n(cid:131) \nTransitional allowance for \nlivelihood losses at AF2,500 for 3 \nmonths \n\n \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nItem \n\nApplication \n\nEntitlement \n\nDefinition of \nAffected People \n \nRenters of structure \n\nStructure on \nROW \n\n(cid:131)  Right to salvage materials from \nthe demolished structure \n(cid:131)  Shifting assistance of AF2,000 \n(cid:131) \n\nLump sum temporary disruption \nallowance as rental assistance of \nAF2,500 \n\n(cid:131)  One-time lump sum grant; \n\nminimum one month\u2019s income \nassessed on a case-to-case \nbasis.  \n\n \n(cid:131) \n\nactivities \n\n(cid:131)  Project will ensure that irrigation \nchannels are diverted and \nreclaimed to previous standard \n\nExpected \nResults \n\nShifting charges \nand disruption \nallowance as \nrental assistance \n\nCompensation \nfor lost income \n\nAdditional \nincome \nrestoration \nassistance \nRestoration of \nirrigation \nchannels \n\nLand and \nstructure on \nROW \n\nEmployees in \nshops and \nsharecroppers \n\nLand on ROW  Households losing \n\nagricultural land \nand irrigation \nchannels \n\nLand/ \nstructures on \nROW \n\nPeople affected \nliving below poverty \nline and WHH \n\nLump sum assistance of AF2,500 \nfor 1 month \n\n(cid:131)  Employment in construction \n\nLoss of \nstructure \n(residential, \ncommercial) by \ntenants  \n\nLoss of income \nby employees \nand \nsharecroppers  \n\nSpecial \nAssistance to \nvulnerable \ngroups \nImpacts on \nirrigation \nchannels \n\nOther \nunanticipated \nimpacts \n\nUnforeseen impacts will be documented and mitigated based on the principles agreed in this \nresettlement plan \n\na This will be paid to owners who are also occupiers of the structure. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nConsultation Meetings, Stakeholder Participation, and Grievance Redress \n\nG. \n \nThe  project  development  and  activities  were  discussed  with  the  local  communities \n12. \nduring the consultation meetings at various project locations. The discussions were held with \nall the primary and secondary stakeholders including the local administration and land asset \nagriculture department, and with various other international and local agencies involved with \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  in  Afghanistan.  The  directly  affected  populations  were \nconsulted  to  understand  their  concerns  regarding  the  road  construction  and  gather \nsuggestions on the types of mitigation measures that should be considered to address the \nenvisaged  impacts.  The  consultations  and  discussions  with  the  project-affected  people  will \nbe  a  continuing  activity  throughout  the  implementation  stage  of  the  Project.  During \nimplementation, MPW will be assisted in conducting the consultations by the nongovernment \norganization (NGO) that will be contracted for resettlement plan implementation. A summary \nof  the  resettlement  plan  and  entitlement  matrix  will  be  translated  into  the  local  language \n(Dari) and disclosed to those affected and made available in local MPW offices, Afghanistan \nResident Mission, and ADB website. The NGO will keep the people affected informed about \nthe impacts, compensation, and assistance proposed for them; and facilitate addressing any \ngrievances.  Those  affected  will  participate  in  all  the  decisions  and  implementation  of  the \nresettlement  plan.  They  will  be  involved  in  the  grievance  redress  committee  to  review  and \nresolve  any  dispute  concerning  compensation  and  other  resettlement  benefits.  Finally,  on-\nsite  consultation  will  be  continuous  during  project  implementation  to  ensure  that  those \naffected receive their due entitlements/benefits. \n \nH. \n \n13.  MPW,  through  the  two  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementation of the resettlement plan. Each PIU will be headed by a project manager and \nan NGO will be appointed to implement the resettlement plan. Two officers deputed to the \nPIU  from  MPW  or  Land  Assets  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  will  act  as  the  social \ndevelopment officers (SDO) and monitor resettlement plan implementation. The supervision \nconsultants  will  also  provide  one  international  resettlement  specialist  and  two  domestic \n\nImplementation Responsibilities and Cost Estimates \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n69\n\nresettlement  specialists  to  assist  the  SDOs.  The  SDOs,  PIU  officials,  and  NGO  staff  will \nundergo 1 week of training on ADB\u2019s policy on resettlement, and resettlement management \nand  implementation  provided  by  the  international  resettlement  specialist.  The  appointed \nNGO will generally be located at the project road sites for carrying out implementation of the \nresettlement  plan.  In  Afghanistan,  finding  NGOs  with  prior  experience  in  handling \nresettlement issues is difficult; however a large number of NGOs working in the education, \nhealth,  and  other  infrastructure  sectors  can  be  trained  adequately  to  assist  the  PIUs  in \nresettlement implementation. The resettlement implementation will commence from the end \nof 2007 and be completed by the last quarter of 2008. Since the Project will be implemented \nthrough  a  design  and  build  contract,  the  international  resettlement  specialist  supported  by \nthe  domestic  resettlement  specialists  will  be  responsible  for  assisting  the  PIUs  in  updating \nthe resettlement plan based on detailed design and submit it to ADB for approval. \n \nDue  to  the  prolonged  war  situation  in  Afghanistan  and  poor  land  record  system,  a \n14. \nland  management  committee  will  be  formed  at  the  central  level  and  will  include  members \nfrom the Supreme Court, MPW, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Energy and Water, and the \nGeology and Cartography Department. The primary task of the committee will be to resolve \nissues  related  to  land  records  and  ownership.  Following  loan  negotiations,  a  grievance \nredress  committee  will  be  constituted  for  each  district,  comprising  (i)  a  representative  of \nthose  affected,  (ii)  a  representative  of  the  local  administration  (the  chief  administrator  from \nthe office of the governor), (iii) a representative from MPW, and (iv) a representative from the \nlocal  legal  department.  The  grievance,  if  any,  will  be  put  forward  to  this  committee  and  a \ndecision should be taken within 7\u201310 working days. In the case of the absence of any of the \nmembers  during  the  decision-making  process,  an  appropriate  candidate  will  be  nominated \nby  the  original  representative.  This  is  only  to  hasten  the  process  of  decision-making  and \nfacilitate  the  civil  works.  Presently  the  appeal  mechanism  available  in  rural  areas  includes \nthe  district  commissioner  and  the  district  police  chief,  who  in  case  of  complaints  by  the \npeople  resolves  such  conflicting  issues  through  individual  and  local  consultations.  The \nproposed  grievance \nlocal \nadministration  and  the  affected  individual.  Therefore,  grievances  are  expected  to  be \nredressed locally within the existing framework. \n \n15. \nThis is the first project to involve land acquisition. Consultations were carried out with \nthe  deputy  minister,  Land  Assets,  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  and  local  officials  to  identify  the \ntime  frame  and  method  of  assessment  of  compensation  for  land  and  assets.  Discussions \nrevealed  that  land  acquisition  will  take  less  time  in  rural  areas.  Since  the  country  has  no \nsimilar experience with regard to assessing and paying compensation at replacement rate in \nrural areas, where the  market for land is minimal, the ministry and local officials confirmed \nthat the method of assessment is based on a negotiated approach as is the case between a \nwilling seller and willing buyer.  \n \n16. \nThe  estimated  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  $2.0  million.  The \nGovernment will finance the land acquisition of $1.0 million and ADB the resettlement cost of \n$1.0 million. The unit values of compensation and assistance were calculated based on the \ninformation gathered during the social surveys from the local administration officials and the \nproject-affected  community.  MPW  will  provide  the  entire  fund  for  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement activities. The PIUs will ensure that resettlement budgets are delivered on time \nto  the  implementing  NGO  for  timely  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan.  Individual \nentitlements  on  a  household  basis  will  be  processed  by  the  NGO  based  on  confirmed \ncensus/SES  data.  Each  entitled  person  will  receive  an  identity  card.  All  land  acquisition \npayments  and  assistances  will  be  paid  to  those  affected  at  least  3  month\u2019s  prior  to \nrelocation,  and  will  be  completed  before  possession  of  land  and  other  assets  prior  to \ncommencement of civil works. \n \n\nredress  committee \n\nrepresentative \n\nincludes  a \n\nfrom \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nMonitoring Arrangements \n\nI. \n \n17.  MPW  will  supervise  and  monitor  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  internally \nthrough the SDOs in the PIUs supported by the resettlement specialist from the supervision \nconsultants. The SDOs will report to ADB on a quarterly basis during implementation of the \nresettlement plan. The monitoring report will deal with all aspects of relocation, resettlement, \nand  rehabilitation  of  the  households.  The  NGO  implementing  the  resettlement  plan  will \nconduct  field  monitoring  on  a  monthly  basis,  assess  progress  in  the  field;  and  prepare  the \nmonthly  report  for  the  SDOs.  An  external  monitor  will  be  engaged  by  MPW  to  submit \nbiannual  reports  and  provide  feedback  on  resettlement  plan  implementation  to  both  MPW \nand  ADB.  External  monitors  will  be  hired  by  MPW  with  ADB  concurrence  within  3  months \nafter  loan  approval.  A  set  of  monitoring  indicators  and  terms  of  reference  for  the  external \nevaluation agency has been developed and included in the resettlement plan. \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n71\n\nSUMMARY OF ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe  road  components  of  the  Project  comprise  improvement  to  two  sections  of  the \nMazar-e-Sharif  and  Bamian/Panjab  road:  between  Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf,  and  between \nBamian\u2013Yakawlang. Except for the 17 kilometer (km) section between Mazar-e-Sharif and Kota \nBaraq,  the  surface  of  the  existing  road  is  earth  or  gravel,  is  in  poor  condition,  and  requires \nreconstruction. \n \n2. \nthe  highway  design  and  maintenance  model  (HDM4)  with \nmodification  for  conditions  in  Afghanistan.  Data  under  the  same  conditions  in  neighboring \ncountries  were  adopted  for  unavailable  input  data.  Economic  evaluation  was  made  by \ncomparing two cases of with and without the Project, which are defined as follows: \n \n\nThe  analysis  used \n\n(i) \n\nWithout the Project. The without-project scenario leaves all planned alignments \nin \nthe  current  construction  status,  requiring  only  routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance.  No  capital  investment  costs  are  involved.  Gravel  roads  will  have \nroutine  and  limited  periodic  maintenance  (grading  and  spot  regraveling)  of  the \ngravel roads. Paved roads will have routine and periodic maintenance in the form \nof patching and sealing.  \n\n \n(ii)  With the Project. The with-project case will construct two-lane paved road over \nthe whole stretch of the sections and reconstruct the 17 km of paved road. The \nroad will have two types of treatments: (i) construction of asphalt-concrete road, \nand  (ii)  maintenance  of  the  paved  road  in  the  form  of  patching,  sealing,  and \noverlay  in  accordance  with  road  deterioration,  and  routine  maintenance.  In \naddition,  gravel  roads  will  have  maintenance  before  upgrading  to  asphalt-\nconcrete. \n\n \n3. \nThe project road was evaluated up to and including 2027. The improved road will reduce \noperating costs and travel time, which will lead to a stimulus to economic growth in the project \narea. All benefits and costs are expressed in 2006 constant prices. \n \nB. \n \n\nTraffic Demand \n\n1. \n\nExisting Traffic \n\n \n4. \nClassified  traffic  volumes  on  the  project  road  are  estimated  based  on  traffic  surveys \nundertaken in 2005, which was adjusted to the average daily traffic, and those resulting from the \ntransport network model developed under the draft transport master plan (Table A13.1). \n \n\n \n\n\f72 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n\nSection \n\nSubsection \n\nAverage \ndaily traffic \n(veh/day) \n\nTable A13.1: Traffic on the Project Road in 2005 \n\nMazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf \n\nMazar-e-Sharif\u2013Kota \nBaraq \n\nKota Baraq\u2013Pul-e-\nBaraq \n\nPul-e-Baraq\u2013Dara-\ni-Suf \n\n2,015 \n\n1,010 \n\n640 \n\nBamian\u2013\nYakawlang \n\n \n\n266 \n\nSources: Consultants and the draft transport master plan. \n \n\n2. \n\nTraffic Growth Rate \n\n \nDifferent economic growth rates are assumed by road influence area based on distinct \n5. \nsocioeconomic  characteristics  in  accordance  with  the  draft  road  master  plan,  which  is  much \nmore  conservative  than  the  optimistic  scenario  set  out  in  Securing  Afghanistan  Future,  and  is \nonly a little higher than the scenario set out in Putting Afghanistan\u2019s Future at Risk. The demand \nelasticity  for  the  2005\u20132015  is  assumed  at  1.2,  which  is  a  conservative  estimate,  based  on \nestimates from traffic and gross domestic product growth trends in other developing countries. \nBecause  little  information  is  available  and  the  expectation  that  the  economy  will  expand \nsignificantly, a single elasticity is assumed for all types of vehicles. Table A13.2 summarizes the \nestimated economic and traffic growth rates for 20052015.  \n \n\nTable A13.2: Estimated Traffic Growth Rates \n \n\nMazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf \n\nMazar-e-Sharif\u2013Kota \nBaraq \n\nKota Baraq\u2013Pul-e-\nBaraq \n\nPul-e-Baraq\u2013\nDara-i-Suf \n\n6.9 \n\n8.3 \n\n5.1 \n\n6.1 \n\n5.1 \n\n6.1 \n\nBamian\u2013\nYakawlang \n\n \n\n6.9 \n\n8.3 \n\nSection \n\nSubsection \n\nEconomic Growth \nRate (%) \nTraffic Growth \nRate (%) \n\nSources: Consultants and the draft transport master plan. \n \n6. \nDuring  construction,  the  growth  rates  are  assumed  to  be  reduced  by  50%.  For  traffic \nforecasts  beyond  2015,  the  traffic  growth  rates  are  assumed  to  be  reduced  by  25%  during \n2015\u20132025, and a further 25% after 2025. \n \n\n3. \n\nTraffic Diversion \n\n \nAssuming  the  completion  of  the  east\u2013west  corridor  and  the  southern  half  of  the  north\u2013\n7. \nsouth highway, traffic may be diverted from the ring road. The analysis assumes that 5% of the \nring-road traffic will be diverted to the project road based on the traffic modeling of the draft road \nmaster plan. \n \n8. \nAnother potential diversion is the shift of existing traffic of the Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf \nsection  to  the  provincial  road  between  Dara-i-Suf  and  Aybak,  which  is  in  very  bad  condition, \nincluding seasonal closure. The provincial road is likely to be taken up for development in the \nvery near future as it is one of the highest priority provincial roads. Based on the road master \nplan modeling, 40% of the traffic observed in 2005 between the Pul-e-Baraq\u2013Dara-i-Suf section \nis assumed to be diverted to the Dara-i-Suf\u2013Aybak section. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n73\n\n4. \n\nGenerated and Induced Traffic \n\n \n9. \nThe increase of traffic generated by the road improvement is assumed to be 20% for the \nKota Baraq\u2013Pul-e-Baraq section, 25% for the Pul-e-Baraq\u2013Dara-i-Suf section, and 50% for the \nBamian\u2013Yakawlang  section.  The  latter  assumes  the  higher  increase  to  generated  traffic \nbecause  the  condition  of  the  existing  road  is  very  bad  with  seasonal  closure.  The  analysis \nassumes no generated traffic for the Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Kota Baraq section.  \n \nDara-i-Suf  and  Bamian  areas  have  large  quantities  of  natural  resources  (coal  and  iron \n10. \nore) and solid plans for substantial expansion of coal mining and establishment of a large-scale \ncement plant as well as a power plant in the Dara-i-Suf area. The developments are assumed to \ncreate an urban center in Dara-i-Suf with a population of about 40,000. The resulting passenger \nand goods traffic relating to that as estimated by the road master plan traffic model are added. \n \n11. \nDevelopment  of  the  east\u2013west  corridor,  including  the  Bamian  and  Yakawlang  section, \nwill be substantial. The draft road master plan traffic modeling shows the substantial increase of \nthe traffic along the east\u2013west corridor due to the expected development along the corridor. The \ngovernments  of  Italy  and  Japan  are  providing  financing  to develop  the  section  between  Kabul \nand Bamian, which will substantially generate traffic on the project road section. \n \n\n5. \n\nSummary of Traffic Forecast \n\n \n12. \nTable  A13.3  summarizes  the  estimated  traffic  forecast.  The  estimate  for  all  sections \nunder  this  feasibility  study  is  consistent  with  the  ones  estimated  under  the  draft  road  master \nplan study for 2015. \n \n\nSection \nSubsection  Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013\n\nTable A13.3: Traffic Forecast \n \n\nMazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf \nKota Baraq\u2013Pul-e-\nBaraq \n\nPul-e-Baraq\u2013Dara-\ni-Suf \n\nBamian\u2013Yakawlang \n \n\n754 \n903 \n2,467 \n3,850 \n4,550 \n\nKota Baraq \n2005a \n1,759 \n2011b \n2,245 \n2015 \n3,884 \n2025 \n7,100 \n2030 \n8,910 \na  Adjusted base year traffic. \nb  Opening year traffic. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTraffic composition is based on the traffic survey in 2005 for normal traffic and assumes \n13. \na  higher  proportion  of  heavy  trucks  and  truck  trailers  due  to  shipment of  cal  and  cement  from \nDara-i-Suf from 2012.

Economic  costs  exclude  price  contingencies,  taxes,  and \nduties.  Afghanistan  currently  does  not  apply  any  taxes  other  than  import  duties.  The  foreign \nexchange  rate  does  not  have  any  significant  distortions.  Based  on  this,  a  conversion  factor of \n0.95 is used to convert the financial cost of nontradables to economic costs. A residual value is \nassumed \nresidual  value  assumed  where  more \ncutting/mountainous sections are involved. \n \nD. \n \n15. \nThe  main  quantifiable  benefits  of  the  investment  are  (i)  savings  in  vehicle  operating \ncosts  and  (ii)  savings  in  travel  time.  Vehicle  operating  cost  savings  were  calculated  using  the \nhighway  design  and  maintenance  model  for  each  vehicle  type.  All  the  input  data  is  based  on \nrecent road feasibility studies in Afghanistan. The benefits for generated traffic are considered to \nbe 50% of those for normal traffic. \n \nE.  \n \n16. \nAn economic evaluation was undertaken by section. The maintenance standard for the \nwithout-project case is (i) patching and sealing grading for the asphalt-concrete road (Mazar-e-\nSharif\u2013Kota  Baraq)  to  keep  the  surface  condition  at  the  minimum  level  of  international \nroughness  index  (IRI)  of  8  m/km  and  spot  graveling  every  year  for  gravel  roads  to  keep  the \nsurface  condition  at  the  minimum  level  of  an  IRI  of  20.  For  the  with-project  case,  overlay  is \nconduced when the surface roughness of the road reaches an IRI of 5 m/km. \n \nThe annual benefit and cost streams for the Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf section and the \n17. \nBamian\u2013Yakawlang section are summarized in tables A13.5 and A13.6. The calculation of the \neconomic internal rate of return results in 29.8% for the Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf section and \n20.7% for the Bamian\u2013Yakawlang section. \n \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return   \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n75\n\nTable A13.5: Calculation of the Economic Internal Rate of Return  \nfor the Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf Section \n($ million) \n \n\nBenefitsa \n\nCosts \n\nYear \n \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n \n \n\nCapitalb \n6.00 \n18.01 \n24.02 \n12.01 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n(2.37) \n3.14 \n3.21 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n(12.01) \n \n \n( ) = negative, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \na  Savings  are  realized  due  to  the  difference  in  maintenance  timing  required  between  the  with-  and \n\nTime Saving \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.34 \n0.50 \n0.54 \n1.04 \n1.37 \n1.50 \n1.60 \n1.69 \n1.78 \n1.87 \n1.97 \n2.07 \n2.18 \n2.15 \n2.25 \n2.36 \n2.44 \n2.65 \n2.60 \n2.69 \n\nVOC Saving \n0.00 \n0.04 \n4.97 \n7.31 \n7.91 \n18.81 \n22.82 \n24.09 \n24.99 \n25.72 \n26.43 \n27.14 \n27.86 \n28.56 \n29.30 \n28.95 \n31.07 \n34.34 \n35.26 \n37.55 \n36.89 \n37.61 \n\nRecurrent \n(0.12) \n(0.41) \n(0.11) \n0.04 \n0.03 \n0.19 \n0.11 \n0.19 \n0.10 \n0.12 \n1.00 \n0.95 \n1.64 \n1.43 \n1.42 \n0.87 \n0.31 \n0.31 \n0.31 \n0.31 \n0.31 \n0.31 \n \n\nNet Benefits \n \n(5.88) \n(17.56) \n(18.60) \n(4.24) \n8.41 \n19.66 \n24.09 \n25.40 \n26.50 \n27.29 \n27.22 \n28.07 \n28.19 \n29.20 \n32.43 \n27.09 \n29.80 \n36.39 \n37.39 \n39.90 \n39.19 \n51.19 \n29.8 \n79.68 \n\nInternal Rate of Return \nNet Present Value \n\nb \n\nwithout-project cases. \nIncluding the savings of generated traffic. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nTable A13.6: Calculation of the Economic Internal Rate of Return  \nfor the Bamian\u2013Yakawlang Section \n($ million) \n \n\nCosts \n\nBenefits \n\nCapital  \n5.32 \n15.95 \n15.95 \n15.95 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\nRecurrent  \n(0.09) \n(0.10) \n(0.11) \n0.17 \n0.28 \n0.28 \n0.28 \n0.28 \n0.28 \n\nMT VOC \n0.00 \n(0.01) \n(0.03) \n7.05 \n8.50 \n10.81 \n11.58 \n12.16 \n12.64 \n\nMT Time  \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.44 \n0.58 \n0.81 \n0.89 \n0.95 \n1.00 \n\nNet Benefits \n \n\n(5.23) \n(15.86) \n(15.87) \n(8.63) \n8.80 \n11.34 \n12.19 \n12.83 \n13.36 \n\nYear \n\n \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n\n \n\n\f76 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nYear \n\nBenefits \n\nCosts \n\nNet Benefits \n \n13.89 \n14.41 \n13.79 \n15.42 \n14.79 \n16.94 \n15.82 \n16.28 \n11.88 \n21.18 \n21.93 \n33.32 \n20.7 \n29.30  \n\nMT VOC \n13.12 \n13.59 \n14.05 \n14.48 \n14.93 \n16.73 \n15.71 \n16.11 \n16.41 \n19.87 \n20.56 \n21.26 \n\nMT Time \n1.05 \n1.11 \n1.16 \n1.22 \n1.27 \n1.48 \n1.38 \n1.44 \n1.49 \n1.59 \n1.65 \n1.71 \n\nCapital  \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n5.75 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n(10.63) \n \n \n\nRecurrent  \n0.28 \n0.28 \n1.42 \n0.28 \n1.42 \n1.28 \n1.28 \n1.27 \n0.28 \n0.28 \n0.28 \n0.28 \n\n \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n \n \n( ) = negative \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF. \n \n18. \nThe sensitivity of economic internal rate of return for the core road and the project road \nshown  in  Table  A13.7  was  analyzed  with  respect  to  changes  in  the  benefit  and  cost  streams. \nThe following sensitivity test cases were examined: (i) construction costs increase by 20%, (ii) \nbenefits  decrease  by  20%,  (iii)  no  time  savings  considered,  (iv)  no  diverted  and  generated \ntraffic, and (v) the combination of (i) and (ii). \n \n19. \ntests for the overall project road, even in the worst case of no generated traffic. \n \n\nThe results show that the quantified economic benefits are robust to various sensitivity \n\nInternal Rate of Return \nNet Present Value \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\nTable A13.7: Results of Sensitivity Tests  \n\nCase \n\nBase Case \n\n \n\n1.
