THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Kingdom of Cambodia for the Livable Cities Investment Project. The report also describes the \nproposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction for the Technical Support and Capacity Development in Urban Planning, and \nif the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the administration of the TA. \n \n2.  The project will support inclusive and sustainable development of the secondary cities of \nBavet, Kampot, and Poipet, by providing (i) access to improved wastewater services to 26,850 \npeople, (ii) improved solid-waste management services benefiting 91,130 people, (iii) reduced \nflooding through improved urban stormwater and drainage systems benefiting 23,960 people, and \n(iv) capacity development to strengthen the institutional capacity of the municipal administrations \nin the operation and maintenance (O&M) of public services. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Economic outlook. Between 1998 and 2019, Cambodia\u2019s economy grew at an average \nrate of 7.7% per year. The opening of Cambodia\u2019s borders to international trade attracted foreign \ndirect investments that supported the manufacturing and tourism industries, and its high growth \ncontributed toward a decline in the poverty rate from 47.8% in 2007 to 13.5% in 2014.1 Travel \nrestrictions and lockdowns as a result of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, however, \nhave resulted in a decline in the construction, garment, and manufacturing industries and the \ncollapse of the tourism and hospitality sector with a decline of 80.2% in international arrivals in \n2020.2 The economy contracted by 3.1% in 2020 and, although the full effects of the pandemic \nremain uncertain, it is expected to recover with growth projected to increase to 1.9 % in 2021 and \n5.5% in 2022.3  \n \n4.  Urban development and planning constraints. From 2008 to 2019, the population of \nCambodia grew at an average of 1.4% per year from 13.4 million to 15.5 million and, by 2030, is \nexpected to approach 20.0 million. During the same time, the urban population has increased at \na rate of 8.1% per year from 2.60 million to 6.14 million, growing from 19.5% to 39.4% as a \nproportion of the total population.4 Currently, most of the urban population is concentrated around \nthe capital city of Phnom Penh, but it is slowly spreading to secondary cities where limited access \nto urban infrastructure and services is resulting in increased environmental degradation and \ndeteriorating livability. The provision of basic infrastructure services is critical to attracting private \nsector investments and promoting economic competitiveness.5 However, the weak institutional \ncapacity and limited availability of resources of the municipal administrations constrain effective \nplanning and service delivery to meet the needs of the growing population. \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2021. Basic 2021 Statistics. Manila. \n2  Government of Cambodia. 2020. Tourism Statistics Report in 2020. Phnom Penh. Compared to the pre-pandemic \nlevel, the decline in international arrivals in 2021 is estimated to be 91.3%. (ADB. 2021. Asian Development Outlook \n2021 Update: Transforming Agriculture in Asia. Manila.) \n3  ADB. 2021. Asian Development Outlook 2021 Update: Transforming Agriculture in Asia. Manila. \n4  Government of Cambodia. 2020. General Population Census of the Kingdom of Cambodia 2019. Phnom Penh. \n5  ADB. 2017. Tourism Sector Assessment, Strategy and Road Map for Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nMyanmar, and Viet Nam, 2016\u20132018. Manila. \n \n ", "2 \n5.  Access to urban infrastructure and services. In 2019, about 46.7% of the urban \npopulation had access to piped water supply in dwellings, with 10.6% reliant on piped water in a \ncompound, public taps, or standpipes. About 44.8% of the urban population had access to a pour \nflush toilet connected to sewerage, and 34.7% had access to a pour flush toilet connected to a \nseptic tank or pit (footnote 4). Many cities across the country experience poor wastewater service \nbecause of the absence of wastewater treatment plants and poor sanitation management. \nUntreated sewage is commonly discharged to the open environment through combined sewers \nand road drains, or indirectly via open canals. Solid-waste services are limited and are often \noutsourced to private contractors, but inconsistent performance of the waste contractors and \nweak enforcement have resulted in a large proportion of solid waste remaining uncollected, \ndumped in open canals or the open environment, or burned.  \n \n6.  Institutional arrangements. As part of the decentralization reform, the government \nadopted a regulation in December 2019 under which planning, delivery, and O&M of public \nservices are delegated to the municipal administrations.6 The municipal administrations currently \ndo not have the capacity to deliver these services due to limited financial independence, lack of \ntechnical capacity and human resource constraints,7 and will need to be supported initially by the \nprovincial government, and central line ministries. Unlike for water supply provision and solid-\nwaste services in some cities, private sector investments in the delivery of urban services for \nwastewater and stormwater are limited because of the low revenue potential. \n  \n7.  Project area. The country partnership strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nCambodia, 2019\u20132023 identified the need to focus on the development of the cities of Bavet, \nKampot, and Poipet because of their location along the Greater Mekong Subregion Southern \nEconomic Corridor, their potential to service cross-border trade (Bavet as the key border entry \npoint to Cambodia from Viet Nam, and Poipet as the key border entry point from Thailand) and \nopportunities to promote tourism (Kampot).8  \n \n8.  Access to services in the project area. While ADB has been supporting the government \nto improve urban infrastructure in the three participating cities,9 access to infrastructure remains \nlimited.10 There are currently no wastewater treatment plants in operation in Bavet and Poipet, \nand a significant proportion of raw sewage is discharged to the open environment through a series \nof combined sewers and road drains. Solid-waste services in these two cities are also inadequate. \nFor Kampot, there is a need to provide additional investments to expand the existing wastewater \nnetwork to service the urban population. Table 1 provides an overview of the state of urban \ninfrastructure and services in the three project cities. \n \n   \n \n6  Government  of  Cambodia.  2019.  No.  182  ANK.BK.  Sub-Decree  on  Functions  and  Structure  of  Municipal \nAdministrations. Phnom Penh. Under the subdecree, the municipal administrations, through the Public Works, \nTransportation, Hygiene, Environment, and Public Order Office, will provide public services including wastewater, \nstormwater drainage, and solid-waste management.  \n7  Staff resources of municipal administrations are limited. Currently, only three staff members for Bavet, five for Poipet, \nand seven for Kampot are engaged under the Public Works, Transportation, Hygiene, Environment and Public Order \nOffice.  \n8  ADB. 2019.

Financial capacity and operation and maintenance. The financial capacity of the \nmunicipal administration of the three participating cities is weak. The municipal administrations \nrely heavily on transfers from the central government to subsidize operations and to maintain a \nbreak-even cash situation.11 Revenue from the operation of the public utility services is limited, \nand the O&M of the existing combined wastewater and drainage network has been funded by the \nmunicipal budget and central transfers. As a result, it is subject to significant uncertainties \ndepending on other budgetary priorities. \n \n10.  Strategic alignment. The government is guided by the Rectangular Strategy Phase IV \n(RSIV) which aims to promote economic development, strengthen the capacity and governance \nof  public  institutions,  improve  service  delivery,  and  foster  inclusive  and  sustainable \ndevelopment.12 The RSIV is supported by the National Strategic Development Plan 2019\u20132023, \nwhich details an action plan to develop cities with improved services, achieving 100% service \ncoverage for both water supply and sanitation, and strengthening the management of solid \nwaste.13 The project is aligned with the RSIV and will promote (i) development of land use plans \nto facilitate effective urban planning; (ii) digitalization to improve the management of urbanization; \n(iii) infrastructure master plans to support the provision of basic and essential infrastructure; and \n(iv) core cities and urban areas that incorporate smart city principles, including conservation of \nbuildings and green cities. The project is also consistent with ADB's Strategy 2030 (Table 2)14 \nand pillar 4 on improving governance of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Cambodia, 2019\u2013\n2023 (footnote 8); the GMS Urban Development Strategic Framework;15 and the ADB Action Plan \nfor Healthy Oceans and Sustainable Blue Economies.16 \n \nTable 2: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priority  Project Interventions \nAddressing remaining  Improve services to women, poor people, and vulnerable groups through pro-poor \npoverty and reducing  initiatives (providing household connections and waste facilities including personal \ninequalities  hygiene facilities to improve livelihoods and working conditions of waste pickers). \nAccelerating progress in  Provide opportunities for women\u2019s participation in technical fields through the \ngender equality  provision of scholarships in engineering and development of gender-responsive \nand inclusive recruitment and training plans within each municipal administration. \n \n11 Between 2016 and 2018, transfers from the central government averaged 94% of Bavet's income, 93% of Kampot's, \nand 76% of Poipet\u2019s. \n12 Government of Cambodia. 2018.

Lessons learned. Since 1993, ADB has provided $544.3 million17 of funding support to \nthe water and sanitation sector of Cambodia to improve water and urban infrastructure. While \nearlier interventions18  have improved access to basic infrastructure, there is growing recognition \nthat any further infrastructure investments should be approached with a long-term planning \nperspective. Otherwise, delivery of partial infrastructure solutions through stand-alone projects \nmay have only limited impact on communities. The project builds on these lessons by (i) adopting \nan  integrated  infrastructure  planning  approach  that  complements  the  proposed  land  use, \nanticipated growth, and development of the cities; (ii) strengthening the technical capacity of the \nmunicipal administrations in urban and land use planning and public utility management to ensure \noperations are sustainable in the long term; and (iii) raising awareness on health, hygiene, and \nsanitation, particularly among women. \n \n12.  Development  partner coordination.  ADB  is a  lead  partner  in the  urban  sector  in \nCambodia, working alongside other development partners including the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de \nD\u00e9veloppement,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  and  the  World  Bank.  These \npartners have focused on improving water supply and sanitation services in Phnom Penh, Siem \nReap, Battambang, Kampot, and Kampong Thom, and are also involved in the development of \nsanitation laws and regulations on tariff setting. In addition, the Government of Australia has been \nassisting the government in the development of a financing and cost recovery framework for \nwastewater. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n13.  The project is aligned with the following impact: livability of secondary cities improved \n(footnote 12).

These will include climate-resilient and gender-responsive and inclusive \nmeasures, taking into account the different needs of women, men, and vulnerable groups. \n \n15.  Output 2: Urban infrastructure improved. The project will improve access to urban \ninfrastructure through (i) construction of wastewater treatment plants and sewerage network in \nBavet and Poipet, and expansion of the sewerage network in Kampot; (ii) rehabilitation of existing \ncanals and construction of new stormwater drains in Bavet and Poipet; and (iii) construction of \nlandfills, including sorting and composting plants, in Bavet and Poipet.21 A behavior change \ncampaign to promote awareness of pollution prevention and waste minimization measures will \nalso be developed. Expanded access to improved sanitation will be particularly beneficial to \nvulnerable households, including those headed by women. \n \n16.  Output  3:  Institutional  effectiveness  and  governance  improved.  Institutional \ndevelopment  plans  for  each  participating  city  will  be  developed  to  guide  the  municipal \nadministrations to become self-sufficient service providers. The plans will include tariff reform to \ncover O&M and to reduce the risk of ineffective service delivery because of poor infrastructure \nmaintenance. A program for recruitment, mobility, and training will be developed to ensure that \nregular skills development. Women\u2019s participation in the sector will be encouraged through the \npromotion of women to technical and decision-making positions and provision of scholarships for \nwomen in engineering or relevant disciplines. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s involvement in the water and sanitation sector has supported the government to \nimprove the livability of cities by increasing access to basic infrastructure. The project will build \non the progress made in the sector and assist the government in adopting good practices in urban \nand infrastructure planning and providing tools for effective monitoring.  \nNoteworthy Features of the Project  \n(i) Effectively integrating long-term planning solutions: The project will support the development of spatial and \nland use plans for each participating city, which will form the basis for future interventions and ensure the long-\nterm sustainable development of the cities. The municipal administration will be supported through training and \ncapacity building programs to improve their oversight of urban development and planning in their respective cities.  \n(ii) Boosting capacity and accountability for effective operations and maintenance: Institutional development \nplans, including tariff reforms and cost-recovery mechanisms, will be prepared for each municipal administration, \nand capacity development assistance will be provided to ensure that the municipal administrations have the \ncapacity to operate the investments sustainably and with greater accountability for operations and maintenance.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n20 The spatial and land use plans will consider provisions to improve special conservation areas, biodiversity areas, \nborder zones, and coastal and riverfront areas, and to promote green infrastructure and sustainability principles. \n21 Output 2 will include (i) in Bavet, constructing a wastewater network including a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) \nwith a capacity of 3,930 cubic meters per day (m3/day), 1,522 household connections, 9.6 km of new or rehabilitated \ndrainage network, and a sorting and a composting plant with a controlled landfill of 516,305 m3 capacity with waste \ncollection vehicles; (ii) in Poipet, constructing a wastewater network including a WWTP with a capacity of 9,576 \nm3/day, 2,415 household connections, 7.13 km of new or rehabilitated drainage network, and a sorting and a \ncomposting plant with a controlled landfill of 632,784 m3 capacity with waste collection vehicles; and (iii) in Kampot, \nextending the existing sewerage network (being delivered under the Second Greater Mekong Subregion Corridor \nTowns Development Project (footnote 18) by constructing additional sewerage gravity lines and providing 1,515 \nhousehold connections.  \n \n ", "6 \nD.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n23.  The attached TA is estimated to cost $2 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The TA will complement the \nproject by developing the capacity of the municipal administrations in urban and infrastructure \nplanning to ensure the cities\u2019 sustainable development and resilience to climate changes. The TA \nwill focus on two key outputs: (i) spatial and land use planning improved and (ii) institutional \ncapacity and governance strengthened. ADB will administer the TA, which will be implemented \nduring 2021\u20132024. The Ministry of Land Management Urban Planning and Construction will be \nthe executing agency and will coordinate with the three participating cities and the other relevant \nline ministries for national regulatory and policy reforms. The Ministry of Land Management Urban \nPlanning and Construction, provincial governments, and municipal administrations will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of staff, local data collection and coordination, and other in-kind \ncontributions.24 \n \n   \n \n24 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "8 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  Technical due diligence involved a detailed assessment of different treatment, layout and \nrouting options, and estimated capital and operational expenditure. For wastewater, treatment \noptions  using  waste  stabilization  ponds  and  conventional  activated  sludge  systems  were \nassessed;25 for stormwater drainage, climatic change mitigation and storm runoff rates were \nconsidered;  and  for  solid  waste,  different  collection  and treatment  options  were  assessed, \nincluding the use of presorting and composting facilities to reduce the amount of waste going to \nlandfill.26 Digital solutions (telemetry systems, sensors, and transmitters) were incorporated in the \ndesigns  to  improve  efficiencies  in  public  service  management  and  to  facilitate  real-time \nmonitoring. \n \n25.  Climate change and environmental provisions. The participating cities are expected to \nexperience increased localized flooding and the proposed investments have been designed to be \ncompatible with local conditions and resilient to the anticipated climatic changes, such as rainfall \nincrease, rising sea levels, and storm surge. Climate adaptation measures proposed include \nincreasing the capacity of the stormwater drainage network and constructing embankments to \nisolate the wastewater treatment plants from flooding. The proposed installation of solar panels \nto complement the building power requirements and the construction of sorting and composting \nplants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will contribute to climate change mitigation.27 \n \n26.  Safe work practices. Project implementation will be responsive and flexible to meet \nevolving occupational health and safety protocols. The project will incorporate best construction \npractices to manage COVID-19 risks and follow guidance from the government and ADB on safe \nwork practices under COVID-19 conditions.28 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n27.  Economic analysis. The project is economically viable with a 12.1% economic internal \nrate of return for the overall project, using a 9.0% economic opportunity cost of capital.29 The \nproject\u2019s economic benefits include improvements to public health; lower health care expenditure; \nreduction in groundwater, waterway, and general environmental pollution; and savings in time \nand convenience with improved access to sanitation and waste disposal facilities. Sensitivity \nanalysis showed that the project is economically robust against all adverse scenarios.  \n \n28.  Financial analysis. The financial analysis for the three cities confirmed that revenue from \nthe project components will not be sufficient to achieve a positive cash flow throughout the project \nlife or generate a sufficient return to offset the capital investment and O&M costs without proper \ntariffs in place. Ongoing commitment from the municipal administrations, the executing agency, \n \n25 The assessment of the treatment options considered the required quality level of treated effluent and land availability \nfor the treatment facility to accommodate the projected future flows. \n26 Sorting and composting plants were determined to be the appropriate treatment options to reduce the amount of \nwaste going to landfill, and controlled landfills were determined to be the most appropriate waste disposal option.   \n27  This aligns with the Cambodia Climate Change Strategic Plan, which promotes low-carbon planning and technologies \nto support sustainable development.

Interim Advisory Note: Protecting the Safety and Well-Being of Workers and Communities from COVID-\n19. Manila. \n29 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The economic internal rate of return \nwas calculated to be 15.5% for Bavet, 15.2% for Kampot, and 9.7% for Poipet. \n \n ", "9 \nand project implementation agencies to support the implementation of tariff reforms will be \nessential to meet the ongoing O&M costs and to ensure the financial sustainability of the project.30 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n29.  The capacity of the municipal administrations is limited, and its financial sustainability will \ndepend on the ability to raise revenue through adequate tariffs and fund the operational expenses. \nEach participating municipal administration will be required to adopt an institutional development \nplan that includes tariff reform, with procedures to raise tariffs, when necessary, during the \noperation of the project infrastructure and services. Deficiencies in O&M will need to be supported \nthrough budget allocations by the central government. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport \n(MPWT),  as the  responsible  line  ministry,  will  be  required to  provide continuous  technical \nguidance and ensure that sufficient budgetary and resourcing requirements are allocated to \nsupport the municipal administrations in the O&M of the infrastructure.31 \n \nD.  Governance \n \n30.  Procurement.  The  MPWT  is  experienced  in  ADB-financed  projects  however,  the \npremitigation procurement risk is rated high due to limited: (i) understanding of the procurement \nframework,  and  (ii)  project  and  contract  management  capabilities.  The  procurement  risk \nassessment  concluded that  capacity  development  initiatives  will  be required  to reduce  the \nprocurement risk to medium. The strategic procurement planning process will support the project \nin achieving value for money.32 All procurement of civil works and consulting services will comply \nwith the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n31.  Financial management. The assessed premitigation financial management risk is rated \nsubstantial  as  the  provincial  departments  of  public  works  and  transport  and  municipal \nadministrations have limited human resources for financial management, lack experience in \nimplementing large projects, and have low financial autonomy. A time-bound action plan to \nmitigate risks has been prepared. Measures include developing a financial management training \nplan and financial management manual, implementing an internal audit function, and installing a \ncomputerized financial management system. \n \n32.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 22). \n \n \n30 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The government is conducting a tariff \nstudy on wastewater services, including mechanisms for billing. Each participating city\u2019s municipal administration \nhas confirmed its commitment to follow the national guidelines (once developed and implemented) and to promote \nawareness and information sharing regarding the tariffs for services. \n31 In accordance with the government\u2019s Standard Operating Procedure on Project Management for all Externally \nFinanced Projects/Programs in Cambodia (promulgated under Sub-Decree No. 181.ANK.BK on 2 December 2019), \nthe MPWT, as the executing agency, will be required to prepare a financing plan that outlines the budgetary \nrequirements to service any financing gaps to ensure sustainability of the investments. \n32 Value for money will be achieved by (i) adopting appropriate evaluation criteria that address sustainability, cost, \nquality, and risks; (ii) ensuring that abnormally low bid provisions are included in open competitive bidding fro \ninternationally advertised packages to manage risks from substandard subcontracting; (iii) adopting the use of \ncontract management plans for civil works; and (iv) applying the most appropriate procurement method and contract \ntype based on past lessons to ensure that  bidding is open to all parties and attracts qualified bidders. \n \n ", "10 \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n33.  Poverty targeting. The project is classified as a general intervention for poverty targeting. \nThe project will improve access to urban services for 28,200 households (141,940 people) across \nthe  three  cities,  including  632  poor  and  vulnerable  households  (3,170  people).  Targeted \ninterventions include pro-poor and social inclusion design features to ensure that the poor and \nvulnerable communities benefit from the improved urban infrastructure and services.33 \n \n34.  Gender features. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming and a \ngender equality and social inclusion action plan has been prepared.34 The gender analysis \nidentified  that  women  are  the  primary  contributors  to  household  and  sanitation  tasks,  are \nunderrepresented in decision-making processes outside of the household, and hold very few \ntechnical and decision-making positions in the water and sanitation sector. Households headed \nby women were also found to spend a larger proportion of the household budget on health \nexpenses. The project\u2019s gender features include (i) development of gender-responsive and \ninclusive  guidelines  on  financial  planning,  tariff  setting,  and  reporting;  (ii)  behavior  change \nanalysis and development of strategy on wastewater and solid-waste management targeting \nwomen, men, and vulnerable groups in the project area; (iii) development of gender-responsive \nand inclusive recruitment and training plans for participating municipal administrations; and (iv) \naward of at least 20 scholarships to female employees of the MPWT, the provincial departments \nof public works and transport, and/or municipal administrations to study engineering or other \nrelevant sciences at an accredited institution to advance their careers in the water and sanitation \nsector. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows:35 \n \n36.  Environment  (category  B).  Three  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  and \ncorresponding environmental management plans (EMPs) have been prepared for the project in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  government  laws  and \nregulations.36 The IEEs were prepared based on meaningful consultations during the project \npreparation. It is expected that the project sites will experience short-term, localized impacts \nduring construction. These impacts will be site specific and reversible and can be avoided, \nminimized, or mitigated to an acceptable level with good construction practices and mitigation \nmeasures as defined in the EMPs and the corresponding site-specific construction EMPs to be \nprepared and implemented by the contractors.37 Further consultations will be carried out during \nthe implementation stage, and the IEEs and corresponding EMPs will be updated based on \ndetailed engineering designs approved by the government, cleared by ADB, and disclosed before \ncontract award. Updated EMPs will be included in the bidding documents. Civil works will \n \n33 As part of the project, household connections (or provision of septic tanks) for ID poor and vulnerable households, \nas identified by the government, who are unable to connect to the system will be included as part of the capital works. \nPublic sanitation blocks will be constructed in public areas and/or marketplaces where there are no public toilets. \n34 Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n35 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n36 Initial Environmental Examination: Bavet; Initial Environmental Examination: Kampot; and Initial Environmental \nExamination: Poipet (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 Potential environmental impacts include temporary disruption of roads and access to properties, increase in dust \nconcentration and noise levels, sediment runoff, solid-waste generation and disposal, and occupational and \ncommunity health and safety. Longer-term impacts associated with landfill sites (e.g., odor) have been appropriately \nassessed and will be mitigated in line with national and international requirements. \n \n ", "11 \ncommence only after domestic national environmental clearances have been secured and the \nrelevant construction EMP has been approved by the project management unit. \n \n37.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). Draft resettlement plans were prepared for the \nthree participating cities in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and \ngovernment laws and regulations.38 Based on the feasibility study, the project may require a total \narea of 518,924.40 square meters (m2) to be acquired,39 with 200 households (685 people) \naffected, of which (i) 19 households (81 people) may experience major impacts with loss of more \nthan 10% of their productive land, and (ii) 17 households (60 people) are potentially vulnerable.40 \nNo relocation will be required, and all other impacts are minor such as on secondary structures \nand trees. The draft resettlement plans will be updated based on the detailed engineering designs, \napproved  by  the  government,  cleared  by  ADB,  and  disclosed  prior  to  contract  award. \nCompensation and allowances are to be provided prior to commencement of works. The General \nDepartment for Resettlement will oversee finalization, implementation, monitoring, and reporting \nof the resettlement plans during the project implementation stage. \n \n38.  Indigenous peoples (category C). An indigenous peoples due diligence report has been \nprepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and government laws and \nregulations.41 Meaningful consultations were carried out with 83 representatives from ethnic \nminorities, including 47 women, as part of the feasibility study, and the social impact assessments \nfound that (i) there are no indigenous peoples communities that will be positively or negatively \naffected within the project impact area; (ii) there is a small number of ethnic Vietnamese people \nin Bavet; (iii) the Cham minorities in Poipet and Kampot are well-integrated into Cambodian \nsociety in terms of citizenship, language, education, and political representation, and enjoy equal \nrights and opportunities as Cambodian citizens; and (iv) the project will not have differential \nimpacts on ethnic minorities, and any potential minor  involuntary resettlement impacts are \nadequately addressed in the resettlement planning documents. During project implementation, \nthe MPWT will ensure regular consultations with the ethnic minorities as well as the Khmer \npopulation. \n \n39.  Grievance redress mechanism. Field visits, meaningful consultations, and focus group \ndiscussions were held with the project beneficiaries as part of the project due diligence and will \ncontinue throughout the project implementation period.42 A grievance redress mechanism has \nbeen defined in the IEEs and resettlement plans and will be established in accordance with \ngovernment regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) to address any project-\nrelated complaints. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n40.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 6 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.43 \n \n \n38 Basic Resettlement Plan: Bavet; Basic Resettlement Plan: Kampot; and Basic Resettlement Plan: Poipet (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n39 The estimated area to be acquired is 189,204.9 m2 in Bavet, 456.5 m2 in Kampot, and 329,263.0 m2 in Poipet. \n40 The total area to be acquired and the number of affected households will be confirmed at the time of detailed \nengineering design measurement survey, and will be documented in the updated resettlement plans. \n41 Indigenous Peoples Due Diligence Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n42 Project beneficiaries include the poor, ethnic groups, households headed by women, people with a disability, the \nelderly, and youth.
