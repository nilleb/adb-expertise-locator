The report also describes the proposed administration \nof a loan of up to $4,200,000 to be provided by the Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector \nin Asia II (CFPS II)1 for the Prime Road National Solar Park Project, and if the Board approves \nthe  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  approve  the \nadministration of the CFPS II loan. \n \n2. \nThe  limited  recourse  project  finance  loan  will  support  the  borrower  in  developing  and \noperating a 60-megawatt alternating current (MWac) solar photovoltaic power plant in Kampong \nChhnang  Province,  in  Cambodia  (the  project).  The  project  is  the  culmination  of  a  One  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) effort over several years to develop a solar park in Cambodia involving \nthe  Southeast  Asia  Department  (SERD),  the  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change \nDepartment,  the  Office  of  Public\u2013Private  Partnership,  and  the  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment  (PSOD).  Prime  Road  Alternative  (Cambodia)  Company  Limited  was  awarded  the \nproject through a competitive reverse auction tender process that resulted in the lowest utility-\nscale solar tariff in Southeast Asia at the time: $0.03877 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). The ADB loan \nwill meet the borrower\u2019s requirements for longer-tenor, United States dollar-denominated project \nfinancing, which local financial institutions are unable to provide. ADB has led the transaction and \nwill  mobilize  more  than  $5  of  cofinancing  from  commercial,  development  finance,  and \nconcessional  sources  for  every  $1  of  ADB  investment.  CFPS  II  concessional  financing  helped \ncontribute to a financially viable bid result with a competitive tariff. The project will contribute to \nADB\u2019s  climate  change  mitigation  efforts  by  reducing  annual  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  the \nenergy sector by 110,700 tons per year. Classified effective gender mainstreaming, the project \nwill also promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in Cambodia. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n1. \n\nProject Identification \n\n3. \nSince the early 1990s, Cambodia has enacted wide-ranging reforms and transformed itself \nfrom a country beset by 3 decades of civil conflict and instability to a high-growth, market-oriented \neconomy.  Its  economic  growth  reached  an  average  rate  of  6.4%  from  2009  to  2019,2 and  the \npoverty rate fell substantially from 30.1% in 2009 to 12.9% in 2018.3 The household electrification \nrate also increased significantly from 19% in 2009 to 75% in 2019.4 \n \n4. \nTotal electricity demand grew from 2,077 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2009 to 12,015 GWh \nin 2019, and is expected to reach 24,184 GWh by 2025 under a medium-growth scenario that \nADB helped prepare for Cambodia\u2019s Power Development Master Plan (2020\u20132040).5 While the \n\nDevelopment (\u201cDFATD\u201d). \n\n \n\n1  Financing partner: The Government of Canada, as represented by the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and \n\n2  ADB. 2020.

Technical  Assistance  for  Southeast  Asia  Energy  Sector  Development, \n\nInvestment Planning and Capacity Building Facility. Manila (TA 9600-REG). \n\n\f2 \n\ncoronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  will  likely  lead  to  a  deceleration  of  this  growth \ntrajectory,  pre-crisis  growth  patterns  are  expected  to  reemerge  in  tandem  with  an  eventual \neconomic recovery. \n \nCambodia\u2019s power supply still depends heavily on hydropower, coal, diesel, and imports \n5. \nfrom  neighboring  countries.  Its  installed  capacity  totaled  2,756  megawatts  (MW)  at  the  end  of \n2019,  of  which  hydropower  accounted  for  the  largest  share  (48%),  followed  by  coal  (24%). \nCambodia relies on a further 627 MW of cross-border capacity from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  However,  solar  is  a  promising  renewable  energy  source  in \nCambodia, potentially complementing hydropower resources and reducing reliance on coal and \ndiesel generation. The country enjoys some of the highest solar resources in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion, with solar irradiance measuring on average 1,400 kWh\u20131,800 kWh per square meter \nper year throughout the country, for an estimated technical potential of more than 8,000 MW.6 \n \n6. \nIn June 2016, the Government of Cambodia received approval from the multidonor climate \ninvestment funds for an investment plan under the Scaling-Up Renewable Energy for Low-Income \nCountries  Program.  The  program  investment  plan  in  Cambodia  included  $21.3  million  to \naccelerate solar power through both the public and private sectors.7 In 2016, ADB also approved \na  loan  to  support  the  first  utility-scale  solar  project  in  Cambodia,  the  Bavet  solar  project.8 The \nsuccess  and  experience  with  this  project  helped  Electricit\u00e9  du  Cambodge  (EDC),  the  national \nutility, get more comfortable with intermittent solar resources. \n \n7. \nIn  2017,  at  the  government\u2019s  request,  SERD  developed  a  preliminary  national  solar \nphotovoltaic grid integration study and road map for EDC. Following this study, SERD presented \nthe  idea  of  a  large-scale  solar  park  to  EDC,  to  promote  solar  at  scale  and  help  EDC  gain \nexperience  in  procuring  power  from  the  private  sector  through  transparent  and  competitive \nprocesses,  using  standardized  legal  and  commercial  agreements.  In  2019,  ADB  approved the \nCambodia National Solar Park Project, which will be able to accommodate at least 100 MWac of \nsolar  photovoltaic  capacity  and  consists  of  150\u2013200  hectares  (ha)  of  land,  fencing,  drainage, \nroads, and plant buildings, a substation, and a transmission line.9 The solar park will also host the \nfirst  utility-scale  pilot  battery  energy  storage  installation  in  Cambodia  with  up  to  16  megawatt-\nhours  of  capacity.10 Transaction  advisory  services  provided  by  ADB\u2019s  Office  of  Public\u2013Private \nPartnership to EDC helped prepare and conduct a competitive reverse auction11 tender to procure \nthe first 60 MWac of power from the solar park which has culminated in this project. The remaining \n40 MWac of capacity in the solar park will be tendered in a second phase.12 \n \n8. \n \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\nThe project is in Kampong Chhnang Province 70 kilometers from the capital, Phnom Penh, \n9. \none of the main electricity demand centers in Cambodia responsible for about 70% of the national \nelectricity demand.

The  sponsor  won  the  project  through  a  competitive  international \nbidding  process  among  26  short-listed  participants.  PSOD  supported  20  of  the  bidders  with  a \nletter of support and indicative term sheet. The project achieved the then lowest utility-scale solar \ntariff in Southeast Asia of $0.03877 per kWh. This will help lower the electricity price in Cambodia, \nwhich is among the highest in the region.14 The project company has entered into a 20-year power \npurchase agreement (PPA) with EDC, the state-owned utility, to supply 60 MWac of power to the \ndesignated EDC substation inside the solar park. EDC will provide the project land. EDC is also \nbuilding a dedicated transmission line for the solar park with ADB sovereign assistance. \n \n11. \nCambodia has policies on both renewable energy and gender equality, but these are not \nintegrated  or  mutually  conducive.  In  energy-related  public  sector  operations,  men  still  tend  to \ndominate the technical and managerial roles, while women are typically hired into finance and \naccounting functions. This is particularly true across the lower Mekong region.15 The low literacy \nand education levels of women in the workforce, combined with attitudes toward gender roles that \nemphasize women as \u201clower status\u201d and \u201chousehold managers,\u201d limit their livelihood alternatives \nor opportunities for higher-level occupations and decision-making positions.16 \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsor \n\n12. \nThe borrower is Prime Road Alternative (Cambodia) Company Limited, a special-purpose \nvehicle  incorporated  in  Cambodia  to  implement  the  project.  It  will  be  about  100%17 owned  by \nPrime  Road  Alternative  Company  Limited (Prime  Road  Alternative, the sponsor),  a  pioneering \nsolar energy system developer in Thailand and a part of the Prime Road Group. \n \n13. \nPrime Road Group is an investment group based in Thailand with diversified interests in \nrenewable  energy,  real  estate,  and  waste  management,  and  a  regional  focus  in  Asia  and  the \nPacific.  The  group  is  a  new  client  for  ADB.  Prime  Road  Power  Public  Company  Limited  is  the \ninvestment holding company for the group\u2019s renewable energy business (holding 100% interest in \nthe sponsor) with a market capitalization of B8.0 billion as of 3 November 2020. CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED. The group has a 7-year track record in the development, construction, \nand  operations  of  solar  power  plants;  its  total  portfolio  of  286  MW  consists  of  22  projects  in \noperation  with  an  installed  capacity  of  178  MW,  and  four  projects  under  development  and \nconstruction with an aggregate capacity of 108 MW. \n \n14. \n \n15. \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n\n \n\n13 Bifacial solar panels can generate power using light absorbed from both sides of the module.

While  Cambodia  reported  relatively  few \nCOVID-19 cases, the virus-induced global economic slowdown will affect its three most important \nindustries\u2014construction,  tourism,  and  apparel  exports\u2014which  account  for  more  than  70%  of \neconomic  growth  and  almost  40%  of  total  employment. 18  ADB  estimates  that  Cambodia\u2019s \neconomic growth will be negative in 2020, before returning to a positive growth rate of nearly 6% \nin 2021.19 Reports suggest that COVID-19 has affected power demand in the first half of 2020.20 \nHowever, it has not had any material impact on the project\u2019s progress. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nOutcome. The project will have the following outcome: energy generated from renewable \n\n17. \nImpacts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) exploration and development \nof  environmentally  and  socially  acceptable  energy  resources  needed  to  supply  all  sectors  of \nCambodia's economy encouraged, and (ii) renewable energy to reduce Cambodia\u2019s greenhouse \ngas emissions promoted. \n \n18. \nsources increased. \n \n19. \nOutputs. The project has four outputs: (i) a new solar power plant constructed, (ii) local \nemployment  with  enhanced  gender  equality  generated,  (iii)  gender  equality  of  employment \nstrengthened, and (iv) gender equality in the community increased. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n20. \nConsistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,  which  outlines  seven  operational  priorities  to  tackle  the  development \nchallenges  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.21 The  project  supports  three  of  them:  (i)  tackling  climate \nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; (ii) \naddressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; and (iii) accelerating progress in gender \nequality.  It  also  supports  Strategy  2030\u2019s  objectives  to  expand  the  role  of  private  sector \noperations, mobilize additional resources on top of ADB\u2019s own financing, and deliver $80 billion \nof cumulative climate financing by 2030. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy,  2019\u20132023  for  Cambodia,  which  calls  for  continued  ADB  investment  into  renewable \nenergy in support of sustainable and inclusive growth.22 \n \nConsistency with sector strategy. The project aligns with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which \n21. \nsupports wider access to energy through investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy \nprojects.23 Consistent with the One ADB approach, the project benefitted from close coordination \nwith ADB\u2019s SERD in assessing and analyzing Cambodia\u2019s energy sector. \n \n22. \n \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n\n \n\n18 World Bank. 2020.

The ADB financing will meet the borrower\u2019s requirements for longer-\ntenor,  United  States  dollar-denominated  project  financing,  which  local  financial  institutions  are \nunable  to  provide.  The  concessional  financing  from  CFPS  II  helped  contribute  to  a  financially \nviable bid result with a competitive tariff. ADB has been leading the transaction which is expected \n\n24 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nto  mobilize  cofinancing  from  commercial,  development  finance,  and  concessional  sources. \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n28. \nBecause of concerns about political risk and the nascent state of the local banking sector, \nobtaining  long-term  financing  necessary  for  infrastructure  investments  remains  a  challenge  in \nCambodia.  ADB\u2019s  lead  role  in  the  transaction  helps  to  mobilize  a  comprehensive  long-term \nfinancing package for a landmark renewable energy project in the region. Its early engagement \nin  the  project  and  its  ability  to  catalyze  long-term  loans  from  a  variety  of  sources,  including  a \ncommercial bank, gave bidders more confidence that debt finance would be available, thereby \ncontributing to lower tariff bids. \n \n29. \nADB\u2019s  strong  support  at  all  stages  of  the  project  will  demonstrate  the  benefits  of \ntransparent  and  competitive  bidding,  long-term  financing,  and  clean  energy  at  scale.  It  also \nhighlights  the  potential  to  develop  Cambodia\u2019s  power  supply  through  low-cost  public\u2013private \npartnership arrangements from domestic renewable energy sources, providing an alternative to \ncoal-fired  generation.  A  successful  implementation  will  show  that  solar  power  infrastructure \nprojects can  be  developed  in  a  transparent manner,  while  achieving  very  competitive tariffs  at \nlevels  well  below  grid  parity  even  in  frontier  markets  that  are  perceived  as  more  challenging. \nADB\u2019s  involvement  also  helped  enhance  the  project\u2019s  environmental  and  social  management \npractices, including stronger gender benefits. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n\n \nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n30. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous  peoples.  The  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  project  have  been \nidentified, and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. \n \n31. \nAn  independent  consultant  prepared  an  initial  environmental  and  social  examination \nreport for the project. No protected areas or particularly sensitive environmental receptors were \nidentified within or adjacent to the project site. The potential environmental impacts (e.g., noise, \nvibration,  dust,  waste  generation,  ground  contamination,  and  soil  erosion)  are  generally \nassociated with construction activities. These impacts are considered to be site-specific and short-\nterm,  and  can  be  effectively  managed  by  implementing  good  engineering,  construction,  and \nproject management practices as well as preventive and control measures reflected in the World \nBank  Group\u2019s  Environmental,  Health,  and  Safety  General  Guidelines,  and  detailed  in  the  site-\nspecific environmental management plans. Occupational health and safety risks will be mitigated \nthrough the development of a health and safety plan that will include routine training, monitoring, \nand the provision of personal protective equipment. Environmental and occupational health and \nsafety  provisions,  consistent  with  the  requirements  of  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  will  be \nincorporated into the contractor agreements. \n \n\n\f7 \n\nThe  project  does  not  require  involuntary  resettlement,  and  no  distinct  and  vulnerable \n32. \nindigenous  people  groups  were  identified  in  the  area.

The borrower will report regularly to ADB on (i) its (and its contractors\u2019) compliance \nwith such laws, and (ii) the measures taken. The borrower will annually submit a safeguards and \nsocial  monitoring  report  that  will  include  information  on  the  project\u2019s  compliance  with  the \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  Information  disclosure  and  consultation  with  affected  people  will \nfollow ADB requirements.25 \n \nINFORMATION  DELETED. \n34. \nFollowing  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development  (1998),  the  borrower  has  incorporated \nmeasures to  promote  gender  equality  and/or  women\u2019s  empowerment  in  its  business  activities. \nKey  features  of  the  gender  action  plan  include  (i)  increasing  gender  inclusiveness  in  its \nprocurement,  (ii)  taking  on  female  interns  in  technical  roles,  (iii)  implementing  an  anti-sexual \nharassment  policy,  and (iv)  delivering  a  community  project  that caters  to  women\u2019s  needs.
