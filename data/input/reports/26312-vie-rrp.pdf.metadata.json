An environmental impact assessment (EIA) was\nundertaken and the Summary EIA was circulated to the Board on\n31 May 1996.\n\nRationale : After decades of conflicts and economic isolation, Viet Nam's\ninfrastructure, particularly its transport infrastructure, is badly\ndeteriorated and is a constraint to general economic recovery and\ninvestment from the emerging private sector. The Government\nhas requested external assistance for rehabilitating the national\nhighway system, over 70 percent of which is in poor condition.\nThe highest priority is given to National Highway No. 1, the most\nimportant north-south link. The Bank, World Bank, and Overseas\nEconomic Cooperation Fund (OECF) have already responded to\nthis request with loans to rehabilitate the highway from Ho Chi\nMinh City to Nha Trang (the Bank) and from Hanoi to Vinh and Ho\nChi Minh City (HCMC) (World Bank). OECF is funding the\nreplacement and construction of major bridges (over 20 meters in\nlength). The proposed Project continues this assistance with\nfunding from the Bank and OECF to improve an additional 161 km\nof National Highway No. 1 from the PRO border south to Hanoi.\nTo improve access and economic linkage to the rural population\ninfluenced by the national highway, the Project includes\nimprovement of over 600 km of rural roads to enhance transport\nreliability on provincial, district and commune roads. This\ncomponent will help raise agricultural productivity and on-farm\nincome and is associated with the development of off-farm\nincome opportunities. In addition, it is a critical determinant to\nincreasing social benefits. The Government accords high priority\nto the Project, which is also in line with the Bank's strategy to\nencourage the increased use of transport linkages, especially in\nupgrading and extending transport corridors, rehabilitating critical\nefficient and sustainable\ninfrastructure, and developing \t\ninstitutions.\n\n\t\n\t\n\fI\n\nObjectives\t\n: The main objectives of the Project are to (i) rehabilitate National\nand Scope Highway No. 1 from Hanoi north to the PRC border to Hanoi to a\nstandard appropriate to the level and type of traffic using the\nroad, (ii) improve rural accessibility and agricultural incomes, (iii)\nreduce transport costs by facilitating more efficient transport\nservices, (iv) improve road safety, and (v) strengthen the\ninstitutions concerned with road management and administration.\n\nCost Estimates : The total Project cost is estimated at $237.0 million equivalent, of\nwhich $150.0 million (63.3 percent) is the foreign exchange cost\nand $87.0 million equivalent (36.7 percent) is the local currency\ncost.\n\nFinancing Plan\t\n\n($ million)\n\nSource\t\n\nForeign\t\nExchange Currency\t\n\nLocal\n\nTotal Percentage\n\nBank\t\nOECF\t\nGovernment\t\n\n97.0\n52.1\n0.9\n\nTotal\t\n\n150.0\n\n23.0\t\n11.9\t\n52.1.\t\n\n87.0\t\n\n120.0\n64.0\n53.0\n\n50.6\n27.0\n22.4\n\n237.0\n\n100.0\n\nLoan Amount\t\n: The equivalent in various currencies of SDR 83,331,000 million\nand Terms ($120.0 million equivalent) from the Bank's Special Funds\nresources, with an amortization of 40 years, including a grace\nperiod of 10 years, and a service charge of 1 percent per annum.\n\nPeriod of Utilization : 31 December 2001\n\nImplementation\t\nMOT's Project Management Unit -1 (PMU-1) will be responsible\nArrangements for Project implementation. Civil works for the national highway\nwill be carried out by contractors and for the rural roads by\ndomestic contractors; their work will be supervised by consultants.\nConsultants will also help carry out the institutional strengthening\ncomponent.\n\nProcurement :  Road civil works for the national highway will be in four contract\npackages and will be carried out by contractors selected following\ninternational competitive bidding procedures in accordance with\nthe Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.  Procurement of rural\nroad civil works contracts will be carried out in accordance with\nprocedures acceptable to the Bank.\n\nConsulting Services : An international consulting firm will be engaged to provide about\n300 person-months of international and 600 person-months of\ndomestic consultants for national highway construction\nsupervision. Consultants will also be retained to rrepare and\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\flit\n\nimplement the rural road component. International and domestic\nconsultants will implement the Institutional Strengthening\ncomponent. All consultants will be selected in accordance with\nthe Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other\narrangements satisfactory to the Bank.\n\nEstimated Project\t\nCompletion Date\n\n: 31 December 2001\n\nProject Benefits\t\nThe main quantifiable benefits from improvement of the national\nand Beneficiaries highway will be savings in vehicle operating and road\nmaintenance costs resulting from an improved road surface and\nalignment and reduced interference from slow traffic. The overall\nestimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for this\ncomponent of the Project is 30.0 percent on the basis of\neconomic costs and benefits estimated over a 20-year period.\nSensitivity analysis shows that the Project will remain viable under\nthe most adverse scenario. The rural road component\nsubprojects will have a minimum EIRR of 12 percent emerging\nmainly from agricultural benefits and reduced transport costs.\nThe benefits will help induce accelerated economic growth, which\nwill contribute to attaining the Government's regional development\nobjectives including increased rural incomes and improved living\nstandards. Reliable rural roads have significant impacts on labor\nmobility and economic status, allowing local residents the\nopportunity to pursue more off-farm employment. Social benefits\nincluding health and education opportunities are also likely to\naccrue in those communities. Other beneficiaries will be road\ntransport operators and road users. The institutional\nstrengthening component will continue assistance to the MOT and\nits Viet Nam Road Administration, and help make them more\nefficient and effective Government agencies.\n\n\flv\n\n105\u00b00bE'\t\n\nI 10\u00b0OE\n\n\tCal Gng\t\n\nnao\t\n\nLChw\t\n\nTuyen\t\n\nLang Son\n\nVIETNAM\nSECOND ROAD\nIMpROVEMFNTPRn.IFrT\n\nT T\n\n- 20\u00b000N\n\n/ J_Jk\t\n\nz Ninn Binh\t\n\ni,u1f of Tonkvi\t\n\n-\n\n_-\n\n20\u00b000'N -\n\nlx\n\nNa Mao\t\n\nNamCau\t\n\nPass\t\n\n/ \nJThanhHoa\t\n\n/\t\n\nSam Son\n\nVinh\n\nPass K Nue\n\n0\t\n\n50\t\n\n100\t\n\n200\n\nKilometers\t\n\nProvinces br Projects\t\nRural Roads Component\t\n\n\u00ae\t\n\nC\t\n\nNational Ca\u00f8ital\t\n\nCitylrown\n\nNational Road\n\nProvincial Road\t\n\nProject Road\n\nRailway\t\n\nAiroort\n\nPort\t\n\n-\t\n\nNavigable Rive\n\nProvincial Boundary\t\n\nInternational Boundary\t\n\n(undaries not necessaril y auThoritative)\t\n\nProvinces under the Project \t\n\n1 Cao Bang\t\nncr\t\n\npass;\u00ec\n\n\\p00g Hoi\n\n\u2022 (TPHue\n\nLaoBaoj .-,\\\t\n\n' '.

A loan 1 for improving the HCMC-Nha Trang Section was\napproved by the Bank in November 1993. A project preparatory technical assistance (TA)2\nwas approved at the same time and provided for a feasibility study of other sections of\nHighway No. 1, including the 161 km section from the PRC border to Hanoi and the 700-km\nsection from Dong Ha to Nha Trang. The study found improvement to both stretches to be\nfeasible on economic grounds. The Government accorded highest priority to the PRO-Hanoi\nsection, which also had the highest economic internal rate of return (EIRR). At the request of\nthe Government, a rural road component was prepared to complement the improvements to\nNational Highway No. 1.\n\n3.\nThe Project was appraised by a Bank Mission that visited Viet Nam from 13 to\n24 May 1996 and a Follow-up Mission which visited Viet Nam from 2 to 5 July 1996. This\nReport is based on the Mission's findings; discussions with Government officials and staff from\nconcerned multilateral and bilateral agencies, including the World Bank and Japan's Overseas\nEconomic Cooperation Fund (OECF); and the findings and recommendations of the feasibility\nstudy.\n\nIll.\t\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.\t\n\nThe Transport Sector\n\nGeneral\n\n4.\nViet Nam extends about 1,600 km from its northern border with the PRO to the\nGulf of Thailand in the south. Its two densely populated river deltas (Red River and Mekong),\nwhich are about 1,000 km apart, are linked by a narrow (40 to 60 km wide) land strip. The\ncountry has about 331,000 km 2 of land area and a total population of about 73.7 million.\nUrbanization is starting to grow rapidly, but about 80 percent of the population still live in rural\nareas. Although economic diversification is taking place, agriculture, forestry, and fishery still\naccount for more than a third of gross domestic product (GDP) and for more than 70 percent of\n\nLoan No. 1272-VIE: Road Improvement Project, for $120 milhon, approved on 23 November 1993.\nTA. No. 1997-VIE: Second Road improvement,  for $2.1 million, approved on 23 November 1993.\nThe Mission comprised the following: T. Jones, Sr. Project Economist (Mission Leader): J. Cooney. Sr\nProject Engineer, IWTC: CE Dark, Economist, PW3, S. Lateef, Social Development Specialist. SOCD,\nand K. Wentz, Counsel, OGC\nThe Mission comprised G HecKer, Mission Leader, and Mr. T Jones, Sr. Project Economist.\n\n\f2\n\ntotal employment. Viet Nam has a rich natural resource base; a relatively well educated,\nskilled, and disciplined work force; and a good potential for long-term economic growth. The\nreal GDP grew by 8-9 percent annually during 1992-1994 and by 9.5 percent in 1995. This\nrate of growth is expected to continue for the next 2-3 years. Recent estimates place the\nannual per capita income at about $270; the Government plans to increase this figure to $400\nby the year 2000.'\n\n5.\nWith the rapidly increasing transformation of Viet Nam's economy from a\ncentrally-planned to a market-based system, Government policies are being radically\nreoriented; public administration is being reorganized; and industry deregulation, price\nliberalization, and commercialization of state enterprises are being implemented in all sectors,\nincluding the transport sector. The rapid transition of Viet Nam's transport sector requires that\ntransport agencies and operators adapt to the new economic environment to improve transport\nefficiency and to create an institutional, legal, and financial framework conducive to\nsustainable economic growth.\n\n6.\nBecause Viet Nam is long and narrow, with a mountainous spine, transport\nmovements are concentrated in the coastal areas. Much of the infrastructure in the northerr\npart of the country was originally constructed 50-100 years ago; few improvements have been\nmade since and maintenance and rehabilitation have been constrained by a lack of resources.\nIn the south, infrastructure was improved and maintained up to about 1970. Low levels of\nmaintenance were carried out subsequently but because of age and lack of substantial\nrehabilitation resources, this infrastructure is also largely in poor condition and requires\nsubstantial resources if the existing infrastructure investment is to be maintained.\n\n7.\nViet Nam's transport system includes all modes and has (i) about 105,100 km o\nroads, 2,600 km of railways, and 19,500 km of navigable waterways, of which 7,000 km are\nclassified as main waterways; (ii) seven main ports; (iii) three international airports; and (iv) 13\nsmaller airports serving domestic traffic (see Appendix 1 for modes of transport other than\nroads). Although some progress is being made, transport statistics are limited and of dubious\nreliability. A transport data base is being prepared under a Bank-funded TA Z but, until that\ndata base is firmiy established, most statistics come from other official sources and a number\nof objective specific studies that have been carried out recently. Road transport is the\ndominant mode, carrying about 58 percent of freight and about 76 percent of passengers,'\nwhile inland waterways and coastal shipping account for about 37 percent of freight tonnage\n(28 percent and 9 percent, respectively) and about 13 percent of passenger volumes. The\nrailways and civil aviation share the rest. The modal split of traffic is expected to remain in the\nnear future with a slight increase in passenger movements by road and in freight movements\nby inland waterways (see Appendix 2).\n\nA Board information Paper entitled \"Country Economic Review\" (CER:VIE 96013) was circulated to the\nBoard of Directors on 5 August 1996 (IN. 142-96).\nTA No. 1996-VIE: Institutional Strengthening of the Ministry of Transport,  for $1.9 million, approved on 2\nNovember 1993.\nStatistics are not available for the private sector, which is estimated to carry about 30  p ercent o the tote:\ntraffic volume.\n\n\f3\n\n2.\t\n\nTransport Planning and Coordination\n\n8.\nAt the highest policy level is the National Assembly, which meets twice a year\nand has an advisory standing committee acting on its behalf in the intervening periods. The\nNational Assembly makes decisions on major economic policies, and approves the national\nplan and state budget after they have been approved by the Prime Minister. The Ministry of\nPlanning and Investment (MPI) reports to the Prime Minister. Major policy decisions, transport\nplans, and large projects, including those for external financing, require review by the National\nAppraisal Committee, which is headed by the Minister of MPI. and approval by the Prime\nMinister.\n\n9.\nThe Ministry of Transport (MOT) is responsible for the overall management and\ndevelopment of the transport sector (see Appendix 3). Four modal administrations within MOT\nare responsible for the different transport modes, one each for roads, railways, inland\nwaterways, and ports. 1 MOT has been introducing new modal administrations since 1992.\nThe Viet Nam Road Administration (VNRA), Maritime Administration, and Inland Waterway\nAdministration were approved in June 1993, while the Viet Nam National Railways was\nestablished earlier. MOT has been slowly adjusting its internal organization to establish well-\ndefined modal responsibilities and support departments.\n\n10.\nThe Planning and Investment Department of MOT undertakes overall policy\ncoordination, investment priorities, programming, and budgeting in the transport sector with\nsupport from its Center for Statistics and a number of other institutions. At the provincial and\ndistrict level, planning and programming for transport sector investments and operations are\nvested with the provincial transport authorities (PTAs), which have links to MOT and the\nprovincial people's committees 2 , but no direct responsibility to MOT except for the\nimplementation of some road works. Planning and programming functions within MOT are yet\nto be fully developed to include modern economic analysis methods and cost recovery\nsystems in transport sector planning and project selection. Nevertheless, these methods and\nsystems are slowly being introduced through MOT staff participation in recently completed and\nongoing transport related studies, seminars, lectures, and study tours. Formal training is\nrequired for a full appreciation of such techniques and systems.\n\n3.\t\n\nInvestments\n\n11. Insufficient capital and maintenance expenditure is a major constraint to\nimproving and maintaining national transport infrastructure capacity. In 1993, the national\nbudget for transport infrastructure amounted to about $131 million equivalent, representing\nabout 14 percent of the Government's total capital expenditures and about 0.8 percent of\nGDP. The allocation for the transport sector is low compared to that in most developing\ncountries, where 2-3 percent of GDP is more common. These investments reached about\n$200 million in 1995 and are expected to increase as externally funded projects are initiated.\nFor 1996 to 2000, the Government has put forward a transport sector assistance program to\nthe external funding community totaling $5,200 million, with the road sector alloted 67 percent\nof transport sector investment, railways 15 percent. and the other modes about 18 percent.\n\nThe Civil Aviation Administration was established in Februar y 1993 ana now re p orts directly to the\nGovernment\nProvncra p eooie s committees are responsibie for the Government aoministratron of the provinces\n\n\f4\n\nDetails on actual and planned transport infrastructure expenditures during 1991 to 2000 are\ngiven in Appendix 4.\n\n4.\t\n\nThe Road and Road Transport Subsector\n\na.\t\n\nThe Road Network\n\n12.\nThe road network in Viet Nam consists of about 105,100 km of roads classified\nas national (11,400 km); provincial (14,200 km); district (25,300 km); village (46,200 km); urban\n(2,500 km); and special (5,500 km) roads (see Appendix 5). Viet Nam's road density,\ncompares favorably with that in other developing countries, at 0.32 km/km 2 . It exceeds that of\nThailand (0.20) and Malaysia (0.25). Some mountainous areas are, however, still inaccessible\nby road. The longest and most important road, National Highway No. 1, extends from the PRC\nborder in the north through Hanoi, Da Nang, Nha Trang and HCMC to Nam Can in the south.\nOther important roads include National Highway No. 5 from Hanoi to Haiphong, National\nHighway No. 18 from the junction of National Highway No. 5 at Bac Ninh to Halong Bay, and\nNational Highway No. 51 from HCMC to Vung Tau. Of importance to the Greater Mekong\nSubregion 1 are National Highway No. 22 from HCMC to Moc Bai at the Cambodia border, and\nNational Highway Nos. 8, 9, 40, which connect central Viet Nam with Thailand through Laos.\nAnother important Greater Mekong Subregion connection is the road from Hanoi to Kunming\nin Yunnan Province of the PRC.\n\n13.\nMost of the national roads are old, as very lithe new construction has been\ncarried out since reunification of the country 2 in 1975, In the north, with minor exceptions,\nroads were built before 1954 and in the south, little construction took place after 1970. While\ngeometric standards are generally adequate, pavements were not rehabilitated when needed.\nthe residual strength of most roads is very poor, and, while the riding surface is fair because of\ncontinual but costly pothole patching, major maintenance, renabilitation, or improvement is\nurgently needed. For the national roads, 62 percent of the total length is paved and about 43\npercent is in good or fair condition. About 21 percent of provincial roads are paved and 25\npercent are in good or fair condition. Although the condition of urban or speciat roads has not\nbeen surveyed, it appears that urban roads are generally in good or fair condition but are\nrapidly facing capacity constraints from increasing traffic volumes. District and commune\nroads are usually earth or gravel surfaced, in poor condition, and not passable to motorized\ntraffic especially during the rainy season. MOT estimates that there are about 8,160 bridges\nwith total length of 168 km on the road network; the average length per bridge is 20.6 m. The\ncondition of these bridges is generally unknown. except for those along the 2,220 km of\nNational Highway No. 1 surveyed in 1991, most of which are in poor condition. In the north,\nover one third of the bridges were built as temporary structures, while in the south, some 50\npercent are temporary and need upgrading, rehabilitating or replacing. Also, a few bridges on\nmain roads serve rail as well as road traffic but are only one lane wide and can cause major\ntraffic delays. In addition, many of the bridges in fair condition are old and designed for low\nloads and cannot accommodate a vehicle of over 10 tons gross weight. A study financed by\nthe Overseas Development Administration (ODA) of the United Kingdom is evaluating major\n\nCambodia, the Peoples Republic of China (Yunnan Province), Lao Peocies Democraho Repubo,\nMyanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam comprise the Greater Mekong SubreQion\nSome roaas are currently beino improved and rehabilitated with both bilaterai and multilateral assistance\n\n\f5\n\nbridges on the national road network and helping to build local capacity for bridge maintenance\nmanagement.\n\nb.\t\n\nVehicle Fleet and Traffic\n\n14.\nStatistics regarding the number of vehicles actually using the roads in Viet Nam\nare not reliable. Initial registration data are available, but annual operating license data are\nnot. Most sources indicate that there were about 323,000 motor vehicles (excluding about 2.8\nmillion motorcycles, 24,000 three-wheelers, and military vehicles) registered in 1994, which\nconsisted of 129,000 cars and pickups, 42,000 buses, and 152,000 trucks (Appendix 6 gives\nthe most recent breakdown up to 1990). The increase of new vehicles registered and licensed\nin Viet Nam is believed to be quite high in recent years, particularly with the infusion of large\nforeign investments, but the exact increase is not known. Much of the fleet is old and\ninefficient, mostly comprising gasoline-powered small trucks with payloads under 6 metric tons;\nbut new and larger trucks are being imported and used on the national roads. Passenger cars\nconstitute a rapidly growing portion of the vehicle fleet, while two-wheeled vehicles including\nbicycles and motorcycles are used exclusively for short distance passenger travel and for\ncarrying small amounts of freight. Two-wheeled vehicles are used extensively in cities and on\ninterurban roads.\n\n15.\nRegular traffic counts are carried out in Viet Nam by the PTAs and the regional\nroad maintenance unions (RRMU), but there is not at present a structured system of collecting\nand collating these data in a usable form. Data collected for the preparation of this and other\nprojects and studies indicate traffic volumes on the road network. Average daily traffic on the\nnational roads near HCMC and Hanoi ranges from 3,000 to 21,000 four-wheeled vehicles per\nday (vpd) and congestion is becoming a serious problem. In other areas, traffic is below 1,000\nvpd on most of the national and provincial roads and below 100 vpd on local roads. Excluding\ntwo- and three-wheeled vehicles, traffic is about 65 percent heavy vehicles and 35 percent\npassenger cars. The 1994 traffic count on National Highway No. 1 ranged from 4,200 vpd\nnear Hanoi to about 1,500 vpd an the least traveled sections.\n\n16.\nViet Nam has a high number of road accidents with fatality rates about 10 times\nhigher than in neighboring countries and some 40 times higher than in more industrialized\ncountries. In 1994, 4,533 persons were killed and 13,900 persons were injured in the 13,118\naccidents reported to the police. The major causes of accidents are the undisciplined behavior\nof vehicle operators, bicyclists, and pedestrians; the confusing and dangerous mix of fast and\nslow-moving vehicles; and the use of pavements for various nontraffic-related purposes. High\naccident rates are also attributed to inadequate laws and regulations for vehicles and traffic,\ntheir lax enforcement, the poor condition of roads, and absence of action to identify and\nimprove hazardous locations. The Government is beginning to address the most critical safety\nissues and has passed legislation (Decree 36-CP 1 ), which, with new road regulations issued in\nMay 1995, provide for clearance of encroachments within the right-of-way of the road and\nreorganization of roles and responsibilities related to road safety. Since implementation of\nDecree 36-CP, the Government reports that accident rates have declined by 30 percent. Bank\ninvolvement in road and road safety issues will continue through Project design and\nimplementation and continuing dialog with concerned Government officials. The proposed\nProject provides paved shoulders throughout the length of the national highway, suitable for\n\nAssistance was g iven to MOT/VNRA in the preparation of this decree under TA Nc 1996-VIE  institutional\nStren gthening of the Ministry of T ranspor\u00b1 for $1.9 million. ap p roved on 23 November 1993\n\n\f6\n\nthe separation of slow from fast moving traffic, improved intersection design, and various  road\nfurniture including lighting, road signs, and guardrails to facilitate safe operations.\n\nc.\t\n\nRoad Transport Industry\n\n17.\nBefore economic reforms were introduced in 1986, the transport industry  was\nentirely Government-owned and operated under rigid regulation and price control. In 1989, the\nroad freight industry was deregulated allowing private participation, as was passenger road\ntransport in 1990. Road freight rates and  passenger fares have been progressively\nderegulated on interprovincial routes, except for certain basic commodities such  as rice, salt,\nand fertilizer, for which price controls have been maintained. The Government prepares a\nschedule of road freight tariffs periodically, which, if implemented, would make road transport\nvery expensive, but these official tariffs are considered indicative and the consignor usually\nnegotiates the rates with the transport operator. Passenger fares are normally subject to\nprovincial control but they are not strictly enforced particularly for intermediate journeys.\nMinibuses and shared taxis are entitled to collect higher fares than large buses, reflecting\nshorter waiting times and quicker journeys.\n\n18.\nOwnership of road transport companies can be classified into five major\ncategories: (I) MOT-owned enterprises (all are located in the north and were established before\n1975; recently they became financially autonomous); (ii) provincial or district enterprises; (iii)\nown-account operators (Government agencies, private manufacturers, and traders), with their\nown vehicle fleets; (iv) private individual operators; and (v) cooperative associations of private\noperators organized by the province or district, owner-drivers, or small enterprises. Of the\napproximately 145,000 trucks in Viet Nam, about 40 percent belong to the Government -\neither MOT, which operates commerciai haulage fleets in the north, or other ministries\n(including the military), which usually carry goods for their own accounts supplemented\nsometimes with commercial haulage. The private sector, which includes cooperatives and joint\nventures, accounts for about 21 percent of all trucks and about 15 percent of capacity. Almost\nall private operators have only one vehicle. The public passenger transport fleet is mostly\nprivately owned or operated by cooperatives, and includes tricycles, converted jeeps, and\nminibuses. The larger buses are usually state-owned\n\nd.\t\n\nRoad Subsector Revenues and Expenditures\n\n19.\nNeither the total amount of highway expenditure, nor its allocation to the various\nroad classes and types, nor the structure of their financing, is fully understood at this time.\nThe fragmented information available indicates that, because of the acute shortage of\nresources over the last few years, expenditures have been minimal, particularly for road\nmaintenance. A large part of the expenditure for major construction and rehabilitation is met\nfrom external sources. Recent estimates of road user revenues and expenditures are shown\nin Appendix 7.\n\n20.\nViet Nam applies a wide range of road user charges. These include charges\nthat are: (i) purchase-related (duties on imported vehicles and ownership transfer taxes when\nvehicles change hands); (ii) ownership-related (annual registration fees); and (iii) use-related\n(import duties on spare parts. tires, and lubricants). Furthermore, the fuel used in road\n\n\f7\n\ntransport is taxed at Dl ,267 per liter for gasoline and D607 per liter for diesel  (1995).1 The\nGovernment has recently introduced a surcharge of D300 on fuel used in road transport (traffic\nfee) whose purpose is, according to Decree No. 1 86-CP dated 7 December  1994, \"to generate\nfunds for regular repair and maintenance of the transport system of the whole country.\" It is\nnot known yet whether these funds have been allocated for the stated purpose. See Appendix\n8 for the structure of road user charges.\n\n21.\nTotal revenues from road user charges in 1993 were estimated at $193 million\n(D2,050 billion), of which about 95 percent was collected from fuel taxes. The new traffic fee\nwould have yielded (at 1993 fuel consumption levels) an additional $43 million (D470 billion).\nThe total revenue collected from road users approximately matches the funding requirements\nfor recurrent road expenditures (operating and maintenance). Road user revenues and\nexpenditures are important matters and are the subject of ongoing policy dialogue between the\nGovernment and the Bank.\n\ne.\t\n\nRoad Administration\n\ni.\t\n\nOrganization and Structure\n\n22.\nOne of the major changes resulting from MOT's reorganization starting in 1992\nis the introduction of modal administrations that are responsible for each of the major transport\nmodes. The Viet Nam Road Administration (VNRA) was established in January 1993 (Decree\n07-CP) as a department directly subordinate to the Minister (see Appendix 3). VNRA has a\nsubstantial degree of autonomy and broad powers. It has its own legal status, is accountable\nto the State Treasury, and prepares its own budget, which is reviewed by MOT and submitted\nto the Prime Minister for approval, Its role and responsibilities encompass the five key road\nadministration tasks: policy formation, planning, guidance, control, and execution.2\n\n23.\nVNRA is directly responsible for administering national roads as well as for\nregulating the road transport industry and road traffic rules and regulations. In 1995, it took\nover vehicle and driver licensing and vehicle inspection responsibility from the Ministry of\nInterior. Local authorities are responsible for provincial, district, and other local roads under\ntheir jurisdiction. VNRA is headed by a General Director assisted by two Deputy General\nDirectors, one responsible for construction and maintenance and the other for transport\nservices (the latest organization chart for VNRA is shown in Appendix 9). VNRA is poorly\nequipped to handle its broad powers and responsibilities but is being assisted by the Bank's\nTA No. 1996-VIE. VNRA is in the process of adjusting to its role. At the regional level,\nnational roads are being administered and maintained by four RRMUs, each responsible for\nabout 1,000-1.900 km of national roads. Under each RRMU are a number of sub-RRMUs with\n200-300 staff responsible for maintaining specific sections of roads.\n\nAll motor fuels are imported. Fuel taxes range from 72 percent of the cost insurance, and freight price for\ngasoline to 50 percent for diesel.\nThe Viet Nam Road Administration: Issues  and Options for Institutional Strengthening, Working Paper Al\nN. 0. Lea International Ltd., May 1995. Funded under TA No 1996-VIE: Institutional Strengthening of the\nMinistr of Transport; see p a g e 2 nara T\n\n\f8\n\nii.\t\n\nPlanning and Design\n\n24.\nMOT through VNRA is responsible for long-term planning of the national road\nnetwork and to some extent for the provincial roads. MOT, with guidance on budgetary\nmatters from the Ministry of Finance and MPI, seeks the Prime Minister's approval of its five-\nyear plan. The long-term planning exercise is carried out by the Department of Planning and\nInvestment of MDI with inputs from VNRA (and its RRMUs), and local consultants such as the\nTransport Development Strategy Institute and the Transport Engineering and Design Institute.\nThese institutes have recently been made financially independent and compete as consultants\nwith other domestic organizations for Government and internationally funded projects. MOT\nhas just started to implement a five-year plan to rehabilitate and improve about 7,200 km of the\nroad network.\n\n25.\nIn addition to the five-year plan, MOT prepares annual capital and maintenance\nplans. MOT starts the process in August of each year, when MPI issues planning guidelines.\nRRMUs submit annual plan requests to VNRA, which reviews and submits them to MOT's\nDepartment of Planning and Investment. The Department finalizes the plans and submits\nthem to MPI for approval in December, with specific allocations for major projects and a lump\nsum allocation for other projects.\n\n26.\nMOT is responsible for technical feasibility studies and detailed design of major\nroad works and bridges on the national and some of the provincial road network, usually\nthrough its in-house institutes; the RRMUs design small-scale works related to rehabilitation of\nroads and bridges. VNRA reviews the design of major works prior to implementation. Because\nof the long period of isolation, road design knowledge and techniques in the country are\noutdated and inadequate, particularly in pavement evaluation and engineering. To assist MOT\nin its modernization in the short-term and to ensure that large-scale projects are well designed,\ninternational agencies are insisting that designs be undertaken by international consultants.\nusually in association with domestic consultants. Some technology transfer takes place from\nthe international to the domestic consultants, but its effects are limited by the small number of\nlocal staff involved and continuity in terms of keeping such staff involved in this work. Results\nof Bank-financed design works have been mixed and the need is clear for more intensive\ntraining, including overseas degree programs for qualified staff. To manage the\ndecentralization of planning, design, and construction, particularly of foreign-funded major\nconstruction projects, VNRA will have to improve its design quality control and contract\nmanagement capabilities. As an interim measure, MOT has set up a number of project\nmanagement units (PMUs) responsible for the administration and control of foreign-funded\nprojects. The PMUs are learning to perform their function fairly well. They will eventually be\nabsorbed into VNRA.\n\niii.\t\n\nConstruction\n\n27. Until recently, all major road and bridge construction works have been carried\nout by force account through six construction corporations directly under MOT and for minor\nworks by the RRMUs either through contract or force account. Recently the Government has\nmade the construction companies' operations commercially oriented and for most of the large\ninternationally financed construction works in Viet Nam, these companies have formed joint\n\n\f9\n\nventures with foreign firms on commercial terms. 1 These joint ventures are still in the nascent\nstage and some administrative, accounting, and procedural changes will be required for them\nto be successful. Outside of the joint ventures, the autonomy given to the construction\ncompanies is promoting competition among them for local contracts through open bidding for\ncivil works domestically financed or allowed under international funding. The local construction\ncompanies and the executing agencies all need modernization, including management skills,\nquality control, and physical resources. The ongoing and proposed externally financed road\nimprovement projects will further stimulate the development of the domestic construction\nindustry and introduce internationally accepted contract management and quality control\nsystems. The proposed Project will continue to help domestic construction companies build\ntheir capabilities and capacities through joint venture and subcontractual arrangements with\ninternational contractors.\n\niv.\t\n\nMaintenance\n\n28.\nMOT is responsible for programming the maintenance of the national road\nnetwork and provides advice on PTA maintenance proposals. MOT issues technical standards\nand guidelines for all road classes. The road maintenance companies under RRMUs are\nresponsible for maintaining major national roads (46 percent of the national road network),\nwhile PTAs are responsible for the remainder of the national road network and the provincial,\ndistrict, and commune roads. This is not a very efficient or consistent organization for national\nroad maintenance management. Alternative arrangements have been developed and are\nbeing discussed with MOT and VNRA officials.\n\n29.\nThe most recent study, 2 by Kirkpatrick, covering development of a road\nmaintenance strategy estimates that maintenance expenditures for national roads cover only\nabout 25 percent of needs; thus, maintenance on most of the national road network is being\nneglected. However, despite the budget p roblem, PTAs and RRMUs have mobilized existing\nresources to maintain vital sections of these roads. Nonetheless, substandard maintenance\nhas resulted in relatively high surface roughness levels, often soon after repairs have been\ncompleted. In addition, the planning and programming for maintenance does not rely on\nsystematic information on road conditions and completed maintenance activities. An\nappropriate road maintenance management system is needed to help planners of VNRA,\nPTAs, and RRMUs decide on major maintenance intervention levels, timing, and monitoring.\nThe Kirkpatrick study undertook a detailed evaluation of selected national and provincial roads\nand recommended that a road inventory management system be put in place and used as a\nbasis for investment and maintenance planning. Operationally, the World Bank is providing\nequipment and TA to the RRMUs for implementing maintenance and minor road works on a\npilot basis. For rural road maintenance, the consultants to be provided under the proposed\nProject in collaboration with parallel World Bank initiatives will help prepare a maintenance\nplan and budget and suggest alternative funding sources.\n\n2\t\n\nVietnamese contractors have successfully completed a BanK-financed road improvement contract in the\nLao Peoples Democratic Republic.\nScott Wilson Kirkpatrick.

The study was funded by ODA (UK\n\n\fB.\t\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n10\n\n30.\nThe Government intends to increase real per capita GDP to $400 by the year\n2000. To realize this goal, the Government recognizes that significant constraints need to be\novercome. The major constraints are (i) a low level of domestic savings, (ii) inadequate and\ndilapidated physical infrastructure, (iii) an insufficiently developed financial system, (iv) a\nregulatory and institutional framework that is not yet fully compatible with the needs of a\nmarket-oriented economy or of the private sector, and (v) the lack of managerial and technical\nskills required by a market based system.\n\n31.\nThe Government is implementing a transport sector reform program that aims to\nimprove transport efficiency and create an institutional and financial framework conducive to\neconomic growth. Most notably in the past few years, the Government has taken a number of\nreforms in this direction, such as (i) eliminating cargo allocation to specific modes, (ii)\nabolishing prescribed tariffs for road and inland waterway freight transport (except for certain\ncommodities considered of strategic and social importance) and decentralizing control over\npassenger fares, which are now determined by the provinces, (iii) relaxing of controls over\nentry by less restrictive licensing arrangements and allowing own-account fleets (including the\nmilitary) to carry for third parties, (iv) opening of interurban passenger transport to competition,\nin stages, and placing of urban passenger transport under the control of the provincial people's\ncommittees, which allocate routes and determine prices, (v) commercializing state transport\nenterprises and abolishing most direct operating subsidies to them, (vi) granting permission for\nthe establishment of private transport enterprises and private sector participation in transport\ninfrastructure investment and operation, (vii) reorganizing MOT into modal administrations with\nbroad responsibilities under the overall authority of the minister, and (viii) initiating steps\ntOwards cost recovery from users of transport infrastructure provided by the state. In the\nfuture, these reform initiatives need to be expanded and enhanced to eliminate remaining\nimpediments to efficient markets and transport institutions. Under the Enhanced Structural\nAdjustment Facility arrangement with the International Monetary Fund, certain policy reforms\nrelated to transport are expected to be accomplished from 1996 to 1998, including\nrehabilitation and development of the road network, the urban transport systems, ports, and\ninland waterways; an improved regulatory framework for private transport services; and\nimproved cost recovery, operations, and maintenance procedures. Bilateral and multilateral\nfunding agencies are assisting the Government to achieve these objectives. The Bank, in\nparticular, is assisting with institutional development including organization, policy reform, and\ninvestment and maintenance planning.\n\nC.\t\n\nExternal Assistance to the Road Subsector\n\n32. Until the drastic cutbacks in aid from the former Soviet Union and other member\ncountries of the former Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) in the late 1980s, Viet\nNam had been heavily dependent on aid from these countries. Most assistance was in the\nform of equipment, construction materials, and TA (mostly for the construction of major\nbridges). Following the cessation of CMEA assistance, some grants for sector studies and\npreparation of projects for external funding have been provided to MOT. In 1990, the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) provided a $970,000 grant for the preparation of\nthe National Transport Sector Review. For road project preparation, the Finnish international\nDevelopment Agency granted $500,000 (Fmk2.0 million) and the Canadian International\nDevelopment Agency $550,000 for detailed engineering and preparation of tender documents\nfor the rehabilitation of about 430 km of road along National Highway 1 from Hanoi to Vinh\n\n\fli\n\nwhich has Deen funded by the World Bank, and about 435 km of National Highway I from\nHCMC to Nha Trang, which has been financed by the Bank. 1 With the relaxing of sanctions\nagainst external funding, Viet Nam has received considerable project and technical assistance\nfor the road subsector (see Appendix 10). The Bank and the World Bank assistance is\nfocused on rehabilitation of sections of National Highway 1; OECF is funding the major\nbridges on these same stretches. France is funding construction of a new bridge on National\nHighway I at Gianh. Improvement of National Highway 5 from Hanoi to Haiphong (106 km) is\nbeing financed by Taipei,China and Japan, and National Highway 18 from Chi Linh to Bai\nChan (81 km) is being financed by the Republic of Korea. The Bank and the World Bank are\nalso preparing additional financial assistance for the improvement of the remaining stretches of\nNational Highway 1 and selected improvements to rural roads. Australia is funding the\npreparatory activities and construction of a major bridge across the Mekong River at My Thuan.\nBilateral assistance for studies has also been forthcoming, most notably for an investment and\nmaintenance strategy study of national and provincial roads and a study of all major bridges,\nboth funded by ODA (UK). Because of the volume of assistance received and proposed,\ncoordination among the various agencies is essential. The Bank is taking a very active role on\nthis. While the annual meeting between the Government and funding agencies provides a\nbasic framework for aid coordination, these meetings are being supplemented by regular\nsubsectoral meetings. A transport sector meeting, organized by the Government with support\nfrom the World Bank was held in October 1994. The Bank provided the main support to the\nGovernment in organizing a road subsector conference of funding agencies in January 1996\nand the Government is organizing a follow-up meeting scheduled for November 1996. These\nmeetings are essential to understanding the Government's needs and the capacity of the\nfunding agencies to help meet these needs in a coordinated manner. UNDP is assisting with\npreparation of an aid coordination data base.\n\nD.\t\n\nLessons Learned\n\n33. Although the Bank's road sector assistance to Viet Nam commenced only\nrecently, a number of lessons have already been learned. The most difficult preconstruction\nactivities under the earlier project have now been completed, and the lessons learned will be\nsufficient to allow the Project to proceed through to contract award without significant difficulty.\nHowever, the first project showed that the Government's approval procedures are very slow\nand require streamlining. The proposed Project addresses this problem by using advance\naction for procurement of civil works contractors and selection of a supervision consultant\n(approved in March 1995). Both activities are now proceeding, with the objective that civil\nworks and consultant's contracts will be ready to sign immediately after the Project loan has\nbeen declared effective. The Project also addresses the involuntary resettlement issue based\non experience gained from the World Bank's concurrent first and second highway rehabilitation\nprojects (there was very little resettlement required for the Bank's ongoing first road\nimprovement project). The project preparatory TA for the proposed Project has produced a\ndetailed resettlement action plan, an Ethnic Minorities Action Plan, and the TA consultant is\nassisting PMU-1 with delineating the required right-of-way boundaries in the field as a first step\nin the land acquisition and resettlement process. Residents required to relocate will have been\nidentified and compensated, and will be moved before their land is required for the road works\nso that the required right-of-way will be available for work to commence immediately after the\nProject loan has become effective.\n\nLoan No i272-VE Road /rnDrc;vernenf Project, for $12OU mThon. aporoved on 23 November 1993\n\n\fE.\t\n\nThe Bank's Sectoral Strategy\n\n12\n\n34.\nThe Bank's program of activities in Viet Nam in the initial period following the\nresumption of operations in October 1993 was guided by the Interim Operational Strategy\nformalized in 1993. The Country Operational Strategy Study (December 1995) was\nsubsequently prepared and focuses on facilitating the country's transition and restructuring of\nthe economy according to market-based principles while promoting balanced and sustainable\ndevelopment. The Bank's strategic objectives are to promote efficient economic growth,\npoverty reduction, and environmentally sound development, guided by the concept of\ngeographic linkages. These linkages are centered on Hanoi in the north, Danang in the\ncentral area, and HCMC in the south. The development of linkages between these growth\nareas and their hinterlands is central to the Bank's and the Government's strategy, and the\nBank is, inter alia, concentrating its project interventions on transport corridors and related\ndevelopment zones that best serve the Government's goal of rapid but balanced economic\ngrowth. Upgraded transportation corridors connecting the growth areas and selected rural\nareas would improve the overall business environment within which households and\nenterprises in Viet Nam could seek out and develop new market and employment\nopportunities. Feeder roads to the transportation corridors would reach out into the remote\nareas and help bring them more into the economic mainstream. Linkages not only apply to\ntransport but also to other economic sectors and include private and public sector participation\nand complimentarity between the operations of the Bank and other funding agencies. Given\nthis strategic framework, the Bank is addressing selected critical constraints in five areas of\nspecial interest: (i) policy reform and institutional development, (ii) infrastructure development,\n(iii) rural development, (iv) human development, and (v) resource management.\n\n35.\nThe Bank's project and technical assistance to Viet Nam's road subsector has\nbeen recognized as critical for achieving these linkages and for supporting the country's\neconomic development. While special priority is given to promoting rapid but balanced\neconomic growth, particularly through a substantial increase in investment in essential\neconomic infrastructure, the Bank's program of assistance through the proposed Project\ncoupled with the Bank's TA program, will also contribute to rural development, institutional and\npolicy reforms, and improved public sector management. The proposed Project is in line with\nthe Bank's strategy and is included in the Bank's operational program for Viet Nam.\n\nF.\t\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n36. The introduction of modern policies is dependent on the development of the\npolicy making institutions. The Bank, World Bank and some bilateral agencies are actively\nassisting MOT and VNRA to become modern well-managed Government agencies. This is a\ncontinuing process and considerable progress has been achieved. The main areas for\ncontinuing policy dialogue which fit within the overall transport sector policy dialogue\nframework of the external assistance community and the Government are outlined below.\n\n\f13\n\n1.\t\n\nknstitutional strengthening\n\n37.\nInstitutional strengthening is a major concern of the Government and is being\naddressed under the Bank's ongoing TA No. 1996-VIE. 1 The focus of the TA is broad,\nencompassing activities involving assistance to help (I) improve the organization and the\nadministrative efficiency of VNRA; (ii) VNRA implement road and road transport subsector\nreforms being pursued by the Government in collaboration with the international lending\nagencies; (iii) in drafting a road act and related rules and regulations; (iv) in the establishment\nof a computerized transport data base for the better management and planning of the overall\ntransport sector, and training of staff in transport statistic preparation, analysis, and\ndissemination; and (v) in strengthening PMU-1 capabilities to deal efficiently with foreign-\nassisted projects. Within the context of these five tasks, specific direction was given to focus\non private sector participation within a regulatory framework in which the Government\nincreasingly adopts the role of supervisor and regulator rather than carrying out operations on\nits own. Much has been achieved toward the accomplishment of these objectives. Assistance\nto PMU-1 has been completed under this TA but is being continued by the consultants\nassisting with ongoing project supervision. A computerized transport data base for the national\nroad network and inland waterway system has been set up within MOT. This needs to be\nexpanded to cover the other modes. The basic contents of a new road act have been\nprepared and some of its provisions have been implemented through a decree concerning\nroad safety (Decree 36-CP). Additionally, the TA has helped VNRA meet its new\nresponsibilities including driver examination, driver training and licensing, and collection of\nperformance data. Setting of vehicle safety standards, evaluation of the vehicle inspection\nsystem, and preparation of documents for vehicle license examination have been addressed.\n\n38.\nVNRA, established in 1993, needs continued help to develop into a more\neffective institution. VNRA has been assigned increasing responsibilities designed to make it a\ntruly modal-specific agency. The TA consultant has been assisting VNRA in establishing the\nappropriate organization, systems, and procedures to address these responsibilities.\nFollowing completion of the TA, the next step for institutional strengthening would embrace the\ndevelopment of support systems, manuals and control documents, and training of staff in a\nwide range of management and technical processes. The most pressing needs are for\nimproving road network planning capabilities, needs identification for road infrastructure\nplanning activities, enhancement of information management systems for user and\ninfrastructure activities, and refinement of guidance and control documents for maintenance\noperations. In addition, modernization of technical standards, specifications, and quality\nassurance systems and the upgrading of staff skills are very important. Such assistance is\nprovided for under the proposed Project.\n\n2.\t\n\nInsufficient Road Maintenance and Investment\n\n39.\t\nInsufficient road maintenance and investment can be traced to two main\nproblems: inadequate planning and minimal funding. Institutional support for road\nmaintenance organization is being provided through TA (see para. 38). A recent study funded\nby ODA (UK) provided an initial identification of a maintenance strategy and estimated the\nmagnitude of the problem. The World Bank is providing funding for more road maintenance\n\nTA No 1996-VIE institutional Strengthening of the Ministry of Transport, for $1.2 miIIon, approved on 23\nNovember 1993\n\n\f14\n\nequipment; the introduction of competitive contracting methods for periodic maintenance; and\ntraining for road agencies and domestic contractors in contract administration, management\nand supervision. The Bank and the World Bank are collaborating on future steps to improve\nroad maintenance planning and implementation.\n\n3.\t\n\nRoad User Charges\n\n40.\nRoad user charges are a significant source of revenue for the Government.\nWith the recent introduction of the \"traffic fee,\" the level of road-user revenues is now roughly\nequivalent to the marginal cost of road use. However, significant distortions remain and should\nbe eliminated within the structure of road-user charges. Diesel fuel and heavy vehicles are still\ntaxed at a low rate, which amounts to an indirect subsidy to heavy vehicles and thus provides\nlittle incentive for the use of efficient vehicles and the efficient use of these vehicles. Also,\ntaxes specific to the weight of the vehicle and the damage it causes to the roads need to be\nintroduced. These matters are the subject of study and, based on study results, will be\npursued further. The Bank is currently encouraging the Government to set up a dedicated\nfund for road maintenance as a short-term measure to ensure adequate funding.\n\n41.\nThe Government has agreed to keep the Bank informed of the progress of all\npolicy, strategy, and technical studies related to transport sector issues, ongoing or to be\nundertaken under various external assistance, by providing the Bank with any related\ndocuments, including consultants' reports, and seeking the Bank's comments thereon. The\nBank will continue to coordinate with the World Bank and other agencies during Project\nimplementation  V\n\nA.\t\n\nRationale\n\nIV. THE PROJECT\n\n42.\nAfter decades of conflicts and economic isolation, Viet Nam's infrastructure,\nparticularly its transport infrastructure, is badly deteriorated and is a constraint to general\neconomic recovery and investment from the emerging private sector. The Government has\nrequested external assistance for rehabilitating the national highway network, over 70 percent\nof which is in poor condition, as well for other components of the road network. The highest\npriority is given to National Highway No. 1, the most important north-south link. Immediate\nneed for rehabilitating this route was also strongly supported by the findings of the National\nTransport Sector Review. 1 The Bank, World Bank and OECF have already responded to this\nrequest through provision of loans for the rehabilitation of the stretch from Nha Trang to HCMC\n(Bank) and the stretch from Hanoi to Vinh (World Bank). OECF is funding the replacement\nand construction of major bridges (over 20 meters (m) in length) on these sections. The\nproposed Project, which has been prepared through a Bank-financed TA, 2 and will be\ncofinanced by OECF, continues this assistance. The Project will improve an additional 161 km\nof National Highway No. 1 from the border with the PRC south to Hanoi and will also improve\nselected provincial, district, and commune roads in Ha Bac, Lang Son, and Cao Bang\nprovinces to help ensure reliable road access to the primary road network. The Project will\n\nBCEOM, United Nations, Viet Nam National Transport Sector Rev,ew, Final Report, 1992\nTA No 1997-VIE:  Second Road improvement Proiecr, approved for $21 million on 23 November 1993 A\nsupplementary grant for $0.85 millior, was approved on 31 May 1995\n\n\f15\n\nhelp the Government improve the national and rural road accessibility and reliability, thereby\nfacilitating efficient transport services and promoting balanced regional development. The\nGovernment is committed to enabling poverty reduction. This involves the development of\nrural infrastructure that focuses on upgrading and extending of rural roads. The Government\nhas also stated that rapid broad-based economic development in combination with targeted\ninfrastructure and social service provision are the best approaches for reducing poverty. The\nGovernment accords high priority to the Project, in line with the Bank's operational strategy,\nwhich encourages the increased use of linkages, particularly transport, with a strong\ngeographic dimension to improve living conditions for the rural population. The strategy also\nencourages the development of sustainable Government institutions.\n\nB.\t\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n1.\t\n\nObjectives\n\n43. The Project will assist the Government with (I) improving  161 km of Highway No.\n1, from the PRC border south to Hanoi (the national highway component [NHC}); (ii) improving\nabout 600 km of provincial, district, and commune roads in Lang Son and Ha Bac provinces,\nthrough which the NHC passes, and the adjacent Cao Bang province (the rural roads\ncomponent [RRC]); and (iii) strengthening the institutions charged with managing Viet Nam's\nroad sector (the institutional strengthening component [ISO]).\n\n2.\t\n\nProject Area\n\n44.\nThe NHC starts at the PRO border and traverses two provinces (Ha Bac and\nLang Son) and the northern suburbs of Hanoi, and provides an important linkage with the\nadjacent Cao Bang Province. Excluding Hanoi (population about 2.3 million) the influence\narea of the Project Road is about 21,250 km 2 with a population of about 3.6 million.\n\n45.\nLang Son Province shares a border with the PRC and four other provinces. It\nhas a total area of 8,200 km 2 and a population of 690.000. Lang Son is a border town and is\nthe focal point for trade with the PRO. This has been increasing rapidly, from 334,500 metric\ntons (mt) in 1991 to more than 1.6 million mt in 1994. It is expected to increase to 2.5 million\nmt in 1996. Virtually all of this is carried by road. From the PRO border through Lang Son\nProvince to Ha Bac Province, a distance of about 102 km via the national highway, the terrain\nis mostly mountainous and rolling midland and produces mainly tobacco, maize, soy beans,\nand tea. Because much of the land is not suitable for rice cultivation, Lang Son Province is a\nrice deficit area. Most forest cover was destroyed long ago; no significant forest areas remain,\nalthough some reforestation projects are under way. Throughout most of this length, the\nnational highway has a minimal two-lane width and surface condition and pavement strength\nare poor. Continual maintenance at high cost is required to keep the road trafficable.\n\n\f16\n\n46.\nFor the southern section from the Lang Son-Ha Bac Province border to Hanoi\nwhere the NRC terminates at National Highway No. 5, a distance of about 66 km, the terrain is\nmostly plains in the Red River delta. Ha Bac Province is heavily populated, with 2.3 million\npeople, and a total area of 4,600 km2 , of which about 60 percent is intensively cultivated. The\nmain crops, in addition to rice which is in surplus, are soy beans, maize, peanuts, sugarcane,\nand tea. There are no significant forests or fisheries. Except near Hanoi where the road has a\nconcrete pavement, the road is old and the pavement is weak. Traffic composition for four-\nwheeled or larger vehicles is about 63 percent buses and trucks while the remainder is\npassenger cars and utility vehicles. Close to Hanoi there is a very large usage of bicycles and\nmotorbikes. Pedestrian traffic can be substantial and there is some animal drawn carriage.\nTogether, these reduce the road capacity significantly.\n\n47.\nCao Bang Province, which is included in the RRC, is adjacent to and northwest\nof Lang Son Province. Cao Bang Province is influenced by the Project road mainly through its\nroad connection with Lang Son town. The land and topography are similar to Lang Son\nProvince. While rice is the most important crop, it is in deficit. Other important market crops\ninclude sugarcane, tobacco, cassava, soybeans, maize, and sweet potato. The 75-km stretch\nof National Highway No. 4 from Cao Bang town to Lang Son town and National Highway No.\n3, which traverses the province, are in fair paved condition; almost all other roads are not\npaved and are mostly in poor condition.\n\n3.\t\n\nScope\n\n48.\nThe Project comprises six components: (i) civil works for the NHC, including\nconstruction of new or replacement bridges up to 20 m long; (ii) construction of new or\nreplacement bridges longer than 20 m; (iii) consulting services for supervision of the NHC; (iv)\ncivil works for the RRC; (v) consulting services for the RRC; and (vi) the ISC. The Bank-\nfinanced portion of the Project will consist of (i) the NHC with associated consultant services;\n(ii) the RRC with associated consulting services; and (iii) the ISO. The OECF-financed portion\nwill comprise bridges over 20 m long over the entire NHC length.\n\na.\t\n\nNational Highway Component\n\nThis component will cover 161 km of Highway No. 1. Within this length, about\n49.\n60 km immediately north of Hanoi will be constructed on a new alignment to the east of the\nexisting highway. tt will comprise the first carriageway of an ultimate dual carriageway facility\nthrough this densely populated and rapidly developing corridor, and is being constructed in\npreference to improving the existing highway because of the unacceptable resettlement\nrequirements that the latter would require. The remaining 100-km length is largely on a new\nalignment, to improve geometry and to avoid the towns and villages that have grown up along\nthe existing road. The highway improvement works will include rehabilitation or replacement of\nall bridges up to 20 ni in length, and the rehabilitation of existing bridges greater than this\nlength.\n\n\f1^\n\nb.\t\n\nBridges Longer than 20 m\n\n50.\t\nalignment is involved) under parallel projects to be financed by OECF.'\n\nBridges longer than 20 m will be replaced or newly constructed (where re-\n\nc.\t\n\nConsulting Services for the National Highway Component\n\n51. Consulting services for the NHC will be for construction supervision, and will\ninclude environmental impact and resettlement monitoring, and a substantial training\ncomponent for Government officials and domestic consultant personnel.\n\nd.\t\n\nRural Roads Component\n\n52. The RRC will improve about 600 km of provincial, district, and commune roads,\nin Lang Son, Ha Bac, and Cao Bang provinces, to provide two levels of access: (i) reliable\naccess, which provides vehicular access for most of the year, with some short-term\ninterruptions being acceptable; and (ii) minimum access, which provides a lower level of\nservice, and with longer interruptions being acceptable. The roads to be improved, and the\nextent and nature of the improvements, will be decided on the basis of population served, the\nextent of economic activity, existing traffic and, for about 20 percent of the roads in each\nprovince, social criteria. The improvements will be implemented through spot repairs to road\npavements and formations, repair and replacement of minor drainage structures, and\nconstruction of surface drainage systems. Design standards and specifications will be simple,\nand will provide for the maximum possible use of labor-based construction techniques, and for\nthe involvement of small-scale domestic contractors. There will be little or no change to\nexisting horizontal and vertical alignments, and very little, if any, requirement for land\nacquisition or resettlement.\n\ne.\t\n\nConsulting Services for the Rural Roads Component\n\n53.\nFor the RRC, services will be provided for (i) assisting with surveys based on the\nagreed road selection criteria; (ii) selecting candidate roads; (iii) developing technical designs,\ncontract documents, and specifications; (iv) procuring equipment and materials; (v)\nadministering contracts; and (vi) training. As rural road maintenance is poor because of\nfunding and management constraints, the consultants will work with PMU-1 and the PTAs to\ndevelop a system of maintenance planning and management. The World Bank will\nsimultaneously undertake a similar project in other provinces. The Bank, Government, and\nWorld Bank have agreed to coordinate closely on all aspects of the two projects, including\np lanning, management, and maintenance.\n\nInstitutional Stren gthening for the Viet Nam Road Administration\n\n54.\nThe ISC will include further assistance to MOT and VNRA, and training for MOT\nand PMU-1 staff. The exact scope will be determined based on the recommendations of the\nongoing TA and discussions of needs with MOT and VNRA management. Some of the needs\nhave been presented in para 38.\n\nOECF has already included the bodges between Hanoi and Bac Giang, about 60 km from the southern\nterminus of the Proiect road, in its program of assistance to Viet Nam. The Government is finalizing with\nOECF further assistance for the bridges on the remaining 100 km of the Project road.\n\n\fC.\t\n\nCost Estimates\n\n18\n\n55. The estimated total cost of the Project is about $237.0 million equivalent.\nincluding bridges, land acquisition, utility relocation, resettlement, civil works, and consulting\nservices. The cost comprises $150.0 million in foreign exchange, including $4.4 million for\nservice charge during construction (63.3 percent of the total) and $87.0 million (36.7 percent)\nin local currency. The cost estimates are based mainly on detailed engineering estimates,\nwhich assume that civil works will be carried out by international contractors and supervised\nby international consultants.

The Project's financing plan is set out in Table 2. The proposed Bank loan will\nprovide $120 million equivalent, denominated in Special Drawing Rights from the Bank's\nSpecial Fund Resources with an amortization period of 40 years including a grace period of 10\nyears with a service charge of 1 percent per annum. The loan will finance all of the foreign\nexchange costs for the Bank-financed portion of the Project, estimated at $97.0 million (40.9\npercent of total Project cost), and a portion of the local currency costs, estimated at $23.0\nmillion (9.8 percent but excluding customs duties and taxes), together equivalent to about 50.6\npercent of the Project cost. The OEOF loan will be for $64.0 million equvaient and wiU finance\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\f19\n\nall of the related foreign exchange costs, excluding service charge, and part of the related\nlocal currency costs, together amounting to 27.0 percent of the total Project cost. The\nremaining Project costs estimated at $53.0 million (22.4 percent) will be financed from the\nGovernment's own resources. The Borrower will be the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. The\nproceeds of the loan will be made available by the Borrower to MOT through appropriate\nbudgetary allocations.\n\nTable 2: Proposed Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nSource\n\nBank\nOECF\nGovernment\nTotal\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\n97.0\n52.1\n0.9\n150.0\n\n23.0\n11.9\n52.1\n87.0\n\nTotal\t\nCost\n\n120.0\t\n64.0\t\n53.0\t\n237.0\t\n\nPercent\n\n50.6\n27.0\n22.4\n100.0\n\n57. The amount of local currency funding takes account of the current fiscal\nsituation in Viet Nam. The country is one of the poorest in the world and the Government has\ndifficulty mobilizing sufficient funds from its own resources to meet all development\ncommitments, including rehabilitation and upgrading critical physical and social infrastructure.\nAlthough the need to generate domestic resources to finance investments for sustaining\neconomic growth is well recognized, the country has not yet developed the resource base\nnecessary to finance adequately the required level of investments without external assistance.\nUnder the current circumstances, a large investment-savings gap will continue exerting\npressure on development programs; thus external support is needed to meet some of the local\ncurrency costs of projects. In line with the Bank's policy to help provide local currency cost\nfinancing particularly for projects that address priority poverty concerns in the economically\nless developed regions, about 19 percent of the loan will be for that purpose.\n\nE.\t\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nProject Organization\n\n58.\n\nThe following summarizes the Project's organization:\n\nPMU-1 will be the Executing Agency for all components.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nPMU-1 will be responsible for day-to-day implementation of the Project.\n\nProject coordination to improve and expedite decision making will be through\nthe Vice Minister responsible for the Project.\n\n(iv) Project consultants will be employed (one each) for the NHC and the RRC, both\nthrough PMU-1. The consultant for the ISC will be selected by MOT and VNRA\nin coordination with PMU-1 with overall guidance provided by the Vice Minister.\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\f20\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n(vii)\n\nEach consultant will appoint a team leader from the consultant's international\nfirm. The team leaders will be responsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe consulting services.\n\nFor the NHC, the consultants will mobilize civil works supervision teams for the\nfour civil works contracts and, for the RRC, one team for each of the three\nprovinces.\n\nFor the ISC, appropriate arrangements will be made for the various likely\ncomponents, such as overseas training, local training, and development of\nguidelines and standards for MOT and VNRA.\n\n2.\t\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n59. A summary implementation schedule for the Bank-financed portion of the\nProject, based on a detailed schedule, is provided in Appendix 12. The NHC will commence\nimmediately after loan effectiveness, expected in early 1997, and will be completed by end-\n2000. The RRC, which will include consultant selection, identification of subprojects, and\npreparing appropriate arrangements for civil works will also commence at loan effectiveness\nand will be completed by early-2000. The ISC will commence in late 1997 and will be\ncompleted by the end of 1999. The OECF-financed bridge works are expected to follow a\nschedule similar to that for the NHC. The total implementation period from loan effectiveness\nwill be about 4 years.\n\n3.\t\n\nCivil Works Procurement\n\na.\t\n\nNational Highway Component\n\n60. The civil works will comprise four contracts, each covering about 40 km of\nhighway and valued at about $30 million to $40 million. Procurement will be undertaken in\naccordance with the international competitive bidding procedures set out in the Bank's\nGuidelines on Procurement.  As defined in the conditions under which the contracts will be\nadministered, the employer for the contracts will be MOT, acting through PMU-1; the engineer\nwill be the international supervision consultant, and the engineer's representative will be the\nconsultant's team leader.\n\nb.\t\n\nRural Road Component\n\n61. The RRC civil works will be implemented through a large number of small\ncontracts, expected to range in value up to $250,000. These contracts will be procured using\nlocal competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank. The bidding documents will\nrequire contractors to engage a reasonable proportion of the labor from the immediate area of\nthe road to be improved. Appendix 13 provides additional details of the procedures for\nprocurement under the RRC.\n\n\f21\n\n4.\t\n\nConsulting Services\n\na.\t\n\nNational Highway Component\n\n62. The consulting services required for the NHC contract supervision will be\nprovided by an international consultant in association with domestic consultants. The\nconsultant will be selected in accordance with the Bank's  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to the Bank. Staffing inputs will be about 300\nperson-months of international consultants and 600 person-months of domestic consultants.\nOutline terms of reference for the consulting services are in Appendix  14. Expertise required\nwill include project and contract management, materials and pavement engineering, structural\nengineering, and social and environmental impact assessment and monitoring. The overall\nperiod of the services will be about 45 months. Facilities and services required by the\nsupervision consultant - accommodation, vehicles, offices and equipment, etc. - will be\nsupplied through the civil works contracts.\n\nb.\t\n\nRural Road Component\n\n63. The consulting services required for the RRC will be provided by an international\nconsultant in association with domestic consultants. Staffing inputs will be about 40 person-\nmonths of international consultants and 240 person-months of domestic consultants. Outline\nterms of reference for the services are in Appendix 15. The consultants will be selected in\naccordance with the Bank's  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements\nsatisfactory to the Bank.\n\n5.\t\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\na.\t\n\nReports\n\n64. Prior to beginning the civil works under the Project, PMU-1 will provide the Bank\nwith brief progress reports on the status of preconstruction activities. Thereafter, the NHC and\nRRC consultants will prepare brief monthly progress reports on their components for PMU-1\nand the Bank. The format of these reports will be discussed and agreed upon prior to\ncommencement of the consulting services. Once the works have been completed, PMU-1 will\narrange for the Project consultants to submit Project completion reports. Quarterly progress\nreports will be required from the consultants involved in the !SC, plus subject-specific and other\nreports as may be required from time to time by MOT and VNRA and the Bank.\n\nb.\t\n\nRecords and Accounts\n\n65. PMU-1 will maintain records and accounts adequate to (i) identify the goods and\nservices financed out of the proceeds of the loan and from counterpart local funds for all\nProject components; (ii) identify the use of these goods and services on the Project; (iii) record\nthe progress of the Project, including its cost; and (iv) reflect in accordance with consistently\nmaintained sound accounting principles its operations and financial condition.\n\n\f22\n\n66. These Project accounts and related financial statements will be audited annually\nby auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audited reports and related financial statements, to be\nprepared in English, will be furnished by PMU-1 to the Bank not later than 12 months after the\nend of the fiscal year to which they relate.\n\nc.\t\n\nImprest Account\n\n67. The Bank has agreed in principle to the establishment of an imprest account for\neligible payments for RRC civil works. This will benefit the Project by improving contractors'\ncash flows and reducing the risk of company failure. The account will be established and\noperated in accordance with the Bank's  Guidelines on Imprest Fund and Statement of\nExpenditures Procedures and arrangements agreed upon between the Government and the\nBank.\n\n6.\t\n\nMidterm Review\n\n68. The Bank will conduct regular reviews throughout Project implementation. In\nparticular, in November and December 1998, the Bank will undertake with PMU-1, MOT and\nVNRA a detailed review of the Project and its implementation status. This review will cover the\nentire scope of the Project, to determine whether any adjustments to its scope and\nimplementation arrangements are warranted. The review will also address any outstanding\nprocurement problems, financing, and scheduling matters.\n\n7.\t\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n69. For the NHC, PMLJ-1, with the assistance of the NHC supervision consultants,\nwill carry out benefit monitoring and evaluation by compiling and analyzing appropriate traffic,\naxle load, and other data. For this purpose, PMU-i will arrange for surveys to be carried out to\nestablish base line data at the start of the NHC and immediately after it has been completed\nand handed over to the Government. The findings and supporting data will be incorporated\ninto the Project completion report. Systems for recording data and statistics for such\nmonitoring will be established as part of Project implementation management. PMU-i will\nevaluate the benefits of the Project in accordance with a schedule and terms of reference to\nbe agreed upon with the Bank.\n\n70. For the RRC, the Bank will agree upon the following with PMU-1 during the early\nstage of Project implementation: (i) the nature and extent of benefit monitoring, (ii) factors to\nbe measured, and (iii) base line data to be collected.\n\nF.\t\n\nExecuting Agency\n\n1.\t\n\nNational Highway Component\n\n71. For the NHC, the Executing Agency will be PMU-1. PMU-1 will be responsible\nfor day-to-day implementation of the Project. PMU-1, headed by a General Director who\nreports to the MOT Vice-Minister responsible. is charged with all works related to the\nimprovement of Highway No 1. PMU-1 is presently responsible for implementing the Bank-\n\n\f23\n\nfinanced Road im p rovement Project (Loan No 1272-VIE[SF]), 1 for which it is performing well.\nPMU-1 wi!l be responsible for all Project preconstruction activities, including selection of\nsupervision consultants, award of civil works contracts, land acquisition, management of the\nresettlement and rehabilitation plan, an ethnic minorities action plan, and relocation of utilities.\n'Once contracts tave been stoned, PMU-1 will provide day-to-day administration of the Project,\nincluding processu-g contractors' and consultant's payments, preparing loan withdrawal\napplications, monitorir1g bar, disbursements, and arranging for audits in accordance with the\nloan agreement.\n\n2.\t\n\nRural Road Component\n\n72. The RRC will be implemented by PMU-1 in association with the PTAs of Ha\nBac, Lang Son, and Cao Bang provinces. PMU-1 will establish a Project implementation unit,\nto be headed by a full-time Project manager, and will also establish sub-PMU-ls in each of the\nthree provinces. The sub-PMU-ls will include suitable staff from the PTAs. The Project\nimplementation unit will be responsible for monitoring and providing advice and assistance to\nthe sub-PMU-ls, and for overall Project implementation, including any centralized procurement\nthat is to be carried out under the Bank's  Guidelines for Procurement  or other procedures\napproved by the Bank. The sub-PMU-ls will be responsible for all of the rural road\nimprovement activities within their respective provinces. The nature and scope of these\nactivities will be defined during the early stages of the Project, but they will include preparing\nwork plans, procuring civil works contracts, obtaining approvals to award contracts, and\nmanaging contract implementation.\n\n3.\t\n\nInstitutional Strengthening Component\n\n73.\nThe ISO will be implemented by MOT and  VNRA. The Vice-Minister responsible\nwill oversee all aspects of implementation while the Director Genera ! of VNRA will be\nresponsibte for day-to-day implementation in coordination with other concerned department\nheads within MOT.\n\nG.\t\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\t\n\nEnvironmental Impacts\n\na.\t\n\nNational Highway Component\n\n74.\nSince the NHC follows a new alignment for much of its length, environmental\nimpacts require particular attention. Under the Project Preparatory  TA, and in accordance with\nthe Bank's Guidelines on the Environmental Impacts of Infrastructure Projects,  a detailed\nenvironmental impact assessment  (EIA) has been carried out, and a summary environmental\nimpact assessment (SEIA) report has been prepared. The SEIA was circulated to the Bank's\nBoard of Directors on 31 May 1996. The main impacts involve disruption of agricultural\nactivities, resettlement and land acquisition, and minor erosion along rivers. The NHC's\ndesigns and contract documentation provide details of the necessary environmental mitigation\nmeasures, and the contractual means by which they are to be implemented during\nconstruction. The scope of the supervision consulting services will include environmental\n\nSee p ara 2\n\n\f24\n\nimpact monitoring and mitigation. Specific tasks will include air and water quality monitoring\nbefore and during construction, and the establishment of procedures to continue the\nmonitoring after the works have been completed.\n\n75. With regard to NHC environmental clearances, PMU-1 has complied with the\nrequirements of the Government's EIA regulations, as issued in April 1995. In brief, the\nregulations require PMU-1, as the NHC proponent, to obtain approval of the Project's EIA\nreport from the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment, and specifically from its\nNational Environment Agency.\n\nb.\t\n\nRural Road Component\n\n76. Since the roads to be improved already exist and the proposed improvements\nwill not involve realignments or major earthworks, environmental impacts will be minimal.\nProject preparation will include an initial environmental examination and an EIA, if necessary.\nContract documentation will include provisions for minimizing construction-related impacts.\n\n2.\t\n\nSocial Impacts\n\na.\t\n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement\n\n77. The NHC will require substantial land acquisition (about 450 hectares), and\nresettlement of about 960 households, comprising about 3,430 residents (Project-affected\nPersons\u2014PAPs). Under the Project Preparatory TA, a detailed social impact survey was\ncarried out and a comprehensive resettlement and rehabilitation pian orepared (see summary\nat Appendix 16). PMU-1 will arrange for the necessary land to be acquired, and for PAPs to be\nresettled and compensated in accordance with the Government's procedures and the Banks\nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement. Where there are differences between the Government's\nprocedures and the Bank's re q uirements, the latter wifl generally govern. PMU-1 agreed to\ninform the Bank of such differences. if any.\n\n78. Reflecting the importance that the Bank places on the carefui and effective\nimplementation of the resettlement plan, the loan agreement contains a number of covenants\nrelated to this issue. These covenants require,  inter a/ia, that the people who must be\nresettled do not face a material reduction in incomes, deterioration in living standards, or\nunnecessary social and cultural dislocations, and that MOT and PMU-1 will implement and\nmonitor the resettlement plan in a manner consistent with the Government's procedures and\nthe Bank's requirements. Specifically, PMU-1 will engage a domestic agency acceptable to\nthe Bank, under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. to monitor the implementation of\nthe resettlement plan. The Bank will also monitor the resettlement process through regular\nreview missions.\n\nb.\t\n\nEthnic Minorities Action Plan\n\n79. For the NHC, 31 percent of PAPs are from ethnic minority communities. To\ncomply with the Bank's policy on indigenous peoples, the Government conducted a special\nsurvey of these PAPs and has submitted to the Bank an acceptable ethnic minorities action\nplan. This action plan includes an identification of the various ethnic minority communities and\ntheir social and economic organization, provides details of their tenancy status, identifies\ncompensation options preferred by these communities assesses any adverse tm pacts as a\n\n\f25\n\nconsequence of their minority status, and suggests mitigation measures to address the\npotential adverse impacts.\n\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\t\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n1.\t\n\nNational Highway Component\n\n80.\nVehicle operating cost (VOC) savings and maintenance cost savings were the\nonly benefits quantified in the economic evaluation. Resettlement costs were the major\ndisbenefits quantified; benefits from resettlement were not quantified. VOCs were calculated\n\"without\" and \"with\" the road improvements for typical vehicles representative of the traffic on\nthe Project road. The methodology employed for the economic evaluation, which is commonly\nfollowed in Bank-financed road projects, is outlined in Appendix 17. Two homogeneous road\nsections, the north and south sections were identified for economic evaluation purposes. The\naverage VOC savings per kilometer range from 30.8 percent on the north section to 22.6\npercent on the south section in constant mid-1995 prices. The difference is mainly due to\ndifferences between the existing roughness and the vertical and horizontal alignments of the\ntwo sections. Most of the VOC savings is attributable to passenger transport vehicles (59.3\npercent). Maintenance cost savings account for less than 3.5 percent of total benefits: VOC\nsavings account for the rest.\n\n81.\nThe economic evaluation was carried out for the two homogeneous road\nsections and for the full length of the highway to be improved. For the derivation of the\neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR), cost and benefit streams were estimated over a period\nof 20 years starting in 2001, which is considered to cover the economic life of the road\nimprovements, including periodic resurfacing of the pavement. Costs and benefits were\nestimated net of duties and taxes and were expressed in constant mid-1995 prices.\nImprovement costs include provision for construction supervision, resettlement, rights-of-way,\nand physical contingencies. Shadow pricing was not used for estimating the relative value of\ntraded and nontraded goods, but shadow wage rates were used for local labor. The annual\ncost and benefit streams are given in Appendix 17. The base EIRR for the NHC is 30.0\npercent, with the EIRRs for the homogeneous sections about the same (30.9 percent and\n29.3 percent). The sensitivity of the EIRRs was analyzed with respect to changes n the\nunderlying cost and benefit parameters (see Appendix 17). Under the most adverse\nassumption of a 10 percent increase in costs and a simultaneous reduction in benefits of 10\np ercent, the overall EIRR remains viable at 24.4 percent.\n\n2.\t\n\nRural Road Component\n\n82. The RRC is a \"pilot\" undertaking by the Bank. Because there may be delays\nand adjustments in procedures and approaches particularly during the initial stages. The RRC\nwill be monitored closely by the Bank. The RRC covers Cao Bang, Lang San, and Ha Bac\nprovinces, where the annual per capita GDP in 1993 was $100, $107, and $146 respectively.\nThe population of the three provinces totals about 3.6 million with a total area of 21.300 km2.\nTypically, an average of 5 percent of the road network in the provinces is classified as national\nroad, 7 percent is provincial road, 14 percent is district road, and 74 percent is communal road.\nAbout 7 percent of the roads are paved with an all-weather surface. Assuming that 20 percent\nof the population in these provinces are urban residents and that the rest are distributed evenly\n\n\fon the provincial, district, and communal roads, 1 km of district road has a direct influence on\nabout 2.3 km 2 and about 300 people.\n\n83.\nMost rural roads selected for improvement will meet specified economic criteria,\nbut some will be selected on the basis of social criteria. An economic rate of return of 12\npercent or more will be required for 80 percent of the selected rural roads, to be derived from a\nsimplified economic analysis of producer's and consumer's surplus. For 20 percent of the\nselected rural roads, social criteria will be used. This 20 percent will target less-privileged\nmountain and ethnic populations in areas where population density is low and economic\npotential dim. The social criterion to be used in these areas is that more than 30 percent of the\nroad's influence area is populated by an ethnic minority.\n\n3.\t\n\nProject Risks\n\n84.\nThe NHC is not subject to any significant economic risks, as EIRRs are\nexpected to remain acceptable even with adverse changes in cost and benefit parameters.\nOne possible risk is that the improved highway may not be adequately maintained after\ncompletion. Through a loan covenant, the Government will be required to review the\nmaintenance allocations regularly and to ensure that sufficient funds are available.\nAdditionally, the Bank and other members of the donor community are actively involved in\nimproving road maintenance management, planning, and implementation capabilities. The\nBank is also encouraging the Government to set up a dedicated road maintenance fund as an\ninterim measure until adequate funds can be assured under the normal budgetary process.\nDelays could also occur during implementation because PMU-i is not yet fully familiar with\nBank procedures. However, this risk is being reduced through advance action that has already\nbeen approved and is well advanced and through timely visits of Bank project administration\nmissions. The construction supervision consultants will also contribute to reducing this risk. A\nfurther possible risk is that the cross-border trade with the PRC will stagnate and traffic growth\nwill not materialize at the 10-13 percent annual rate forecast. To test this, the EIRR was\nrecalculated assuming that VOC benefits would grow at 50 percent of the forecast and that\nconstruction costs would increase by 10 percent; this yielded an EIRR of about 18 percent for\nthe overall Project.\n\nB.\t\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n85.\nThe NHC and RRC deliver substantial nonquantifiable benefits such as quicker,\nless costly market access for farmers and tradesmen, increased access for social\ncommunications, decreased waiting time for passengers, decreased time for movement of\ntrade goods with higher reliability, and, in general, better transport services for the entire\nregion. Directly affected will be the 3.6 million people living in the three provinces in the zone\nof influence of the improved highway and rural roads plus the population of Hanoi (about 2.3\nmillion). The improved roads will directly influence the transport costs of maize, soybeans,\nsugarcane, tobacco, and fresh vegetables, all of which are important crops in the area. The\narea served by the northern section has a rice deficit (Lang Son and Cao Bang provinces)\nwhile the south section (Ha Bac Province) has a surplus. The movement of rice will be\nfacilitated by the improved national highway and the improved rural roads, potentially\nimproving nutrition levels in the deficit areas. The reduction of VOCs resulting from the\nimprovement will benefit road users, particularly road transport operators. Since transport\ncharges mainly depend on road conditions, it is expected that a portion of the VOC savings will\nbe passed on to road transport users. Through this and improved efficiency the road\n\n\f27\n\nimprovements will help enable small-scale producers to participate more actively in the market\neconomy.\n\n86.\nThe inclusion of the RRC in the scope of the Project reflects the strong linkages\nbetween rural poverty and inadequate physical infrastructure. Appendix 18 describes these\nlinkages in detail, in the context of Viet Nam and the Project area. Some of the more important\nconclusions drawn in Appendix 18 are summarized here. Good rural roads affect labor\nmobility, which in turn is significantly related to economic status. People in communities\ncharacterized by labor mobility engage in more economic activities, and are more likely to have\nready access to a reliable road. This leads to greater economic diversification and more\nproductive use of farm land, all of which contribute to improved living standards. Social\nbenefits including increased educational attendance are likely to be enhanced by roads that\nare accessible for at least the greater part of the year. Better rural roads also assist in\nimmunization, mother-child health, and preventive health care programs by allowing reliable\naccess to communes and villages. In addition, a healthier rural population is an important\nfactor in lessening the number of farming days lost to illness.\n\n87.\nThe RRC provides an important additional benefit. Construction techniques will\nbe largely labor based and will distribute about $2.5 million to labor in the local area. This is\nimportant, since many villagers maintain subsistence livelihoods with minimum cash incomes.\nThe cash income earned from the Project will provide them with important additional\nresources.\n\nVI. ASSURANCES\n\n88.\nassurances, which have been incorporated into the legal documents:\n\nThe Government has given the following assurances, in addition to the standard\n\n(I)\t\n\nimplementation\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nThe Government will take all necessary actions to ensure that all land,\nrights-of-way, easements, leases and other rights in land or privileges\nrequired for the Project are made available promptly to ensure timely Project\nimplementation free from any impediment to the Project.\n\nThe Government will ensure that the notice to proceed for the\nsupervision consultancy services is issued prior to the Bank's approval of\nthe first civil works contract.\n\nThe Government will ensure that all environmental mitigation measures\nidentified in the SEIA report are incorporated in the NHC design, and are\nfollowed during construction, operation, and maintenance of the improved\nhighway and rural roads. The Govemment will further ensure that the Project\nis designed and constructed in accordance with the Banks  Environmental\nGuidellnes for Selected Infrastructure Projects (Highways and Roads).\n\nMidway through the Project implementation period (November/December\n1998), the Government, in cooperation with the Bank, will undertake a\ndetailed review of the Project and its implementation status. The scope\nof the review will include all aspects of the Project, including land\n\n\f28\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\nacquisition and resettlement. Following completion of the review, the\nBorrower will take all necessary actions to correct any problems in\nProject implementation identified.\n\nResettlement. The Government will take all measures necessary to implement\nto the satisfaction of the Bank the timebound Resettlement Action Plan\ndeveloped in conjunction with the Bank, as may be amended from time to time\nby the agreement between the Government and the Bank. The Government will\nensure that all PAPs are compensated and resettled in accordance with the\nrequirements of the Resettlement Action Plan. PMU-1 will engage a domestic\nagency acceptable to the Bank, under terms of reference acceptable to the\nBank, to monitor implementation of the RAP.\n\nEthnic Minorities Action Plan.  The Government will take all measures\nnecessary to implement to the satisfaction of the Bank the ethnic minorities\naction plan agreed to with the Bank. Status reports on the implementation of\nthe Plan will be submitted to the Bank as part of the monthly reports for the\nNHC.\n\nOperation and Maintenance.  The Government will ensure that the improved\nroads are maintained to design standards and in accordance with sound\nmaintenance practices. The Government will further ensure that annual road\nmaintenance plans are prepared for the improved roads, on the basis of the\nagreed-upon maintenance standards, traffic volumes, and assessment of\nneeds.\n\nBenefit Monitoring. The Government will monitor and evaluate NHC benefits by\ncompiling and analyzing traffic and condition data for the improved roads. PMU-\n1 wiV be responsible for collecting and analyzing the data through traffic,\nroughness. and other appropriate surveys conducted at the commencement\nand completion of the Project, and will collaborate with other agencies of the\nGovernment as necessary. The findings and supporting data of such surveys\nwill be incorporated in the Project completion report to be submitted to the Bank\nThe data to be collected and the methodology for their analysis will be agreed\nupon by PMU-1 and the Bank. For the RRC. PMU-1 and the Bank will agree on\nthe nature and extent of the benefit monitoring to be conducted and the\nmethodology for its accomplishment.\n\n(vi)\n\nSector Studies\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nThe Government will keep the Bank informed of all transport sector and\nroad subsector studies undertaken in Viet Nam, and will provide the\nBank with copies of all documents relevant to such studies, including\nconsultants' reports, and will ensure that the Bank has the opportunity to\ncomment on the recommendations contained therein.\n\nThe Government and the Bank will from time to time exchancie views on\nthe progress of the Government in carrying out the  p oiices and actions\nrecommended by such sector and subsector studies. The Government\n\n\f29\n\nwill maintain a policy dialogue with the Bank in respect of problems and\nconstraints affecting the growth and development of the road subsector.\n\n(vii) Rural Road Component.  The roads to be included under this component, and\nthe work to be undertaken on them, will be determined by the Government in\ncooperation with the Bank, and will be approved by the Bank. The roads will be\nselected on the basis of criteria agreed between the Bank and the Government,\nthe criteria to include (a) the population served by the road; (b) the extent of\neconomic activity; (c) existing traffic; and (d) for about 20 percent of the roads in\neach province, agreed social criteria to target less-privileged mountain and\nethnic populations. These sociat criteria will include the requirement that not\nless than 30 percent of the population served by the roads in Lang Son and Cao\nBang provinces must belong to ethnic minority groups.\n\nVii. RECOMMENDATION\n\n89. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of\nAgreement of the Bank and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies\nequivalent to Special Drawing Rights 83,331,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the\nSecond Road Improvement Project, with a service charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum\nand with an amortization period of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, and such\nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft\nLoan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\n30 October 1996\n\nMITSUO SATO\nPresident\n\n\fAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber\t\n\nTitle\t\n\nPage Cited On\n\n(page, para.)\n\nOrganization Chart of the Viet Nam Road Administration\n\nPage 7, para. 23\n\nTransport Modes Other than Roads\n\nDomestic Freight and Passenger Transport by Mode\n\nOrganization Structure of the Ministry of Transport\n\nPublic Expenditure on Transport\n\nRoad Network by Class and Surface Type\n\nMotor Vehicle Statistics\n\nRoad User Revenues and Road Expenditures\n\nStructure of Road User Charges\n\nExternal Assistance to the Road Subsector\n\nSummary Cost Estimates\n\nSummary Implementation Schedule\nOutline of Procurement Procedures for the\nRural Roads Component\n\nI\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nII\n\n12\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\nPage 2, para. 7\n\nPage 2, para. 7\n\nPage 3, para. 9\n\nPage 3, para. 11\n\nPage 4, para. 12\n\nPage 5, para. 14\n\nPage 6, para. 19\n\nPage 6, para. 20\n\nPage 10, para. 32\n\nPage 18, para. 55\n\nPage2O,para.59\nPage 20, para. 61\n\n30\t\n\n34\t\n\n35\t\n\n36\t\n\n37\t\n\n38\t\n\n39\t\n\n40\t\n\n42\t\n\n43\t\n\n44\t\n\n45\t\n46\t\n\n47\t\n\n48\t\n\n52\t\n\n60\t\n\n65\t\n\nOutline Terms of Reference for Construction Supervision\n\nPage2l,para.62\n\nOutline Terms of Reference for the Rural Roads Component\n\nPage2l,para.63\n\nSummary Resettlement Plan\n\nOutline of the Economic Evaluation\n\nRural Roads and Poverty Reduction\n\nPage 24, para. 77\n\nPage 25, paras. 80/81\n\nPage 27, para. 87\n\n\f30\t\n\nAppendix 1 page 1\n\nTRANSPORT MODES OTHER THAN ROADS\n\nA.\t\n\nInland Waterways\n\nInland navigation uses about 2.000 kilometers (km) of waterways in the north\n1.\nalong the Red River and its tributaries, and 4,500 km. in the south along the Mekong River and\nnumerous canals and tributaries. Small-scale navigation also exists on several rivers and\ninlets located between the two major deltas. Most shipping routes are open waterways. The\nmajor constraint in the use of the system is the substantial fluctuation in depth and high\nsiltation rates. During the dry season, many channels are no more than 1 meter deep. The\nchannels require dredging, but this is not possible because of inadequate budgets and\nequipment. A large backlog of dredging has thus accumulated, estimated at 10 million cubic\nmeters.\n\nInland waterway transport is operated at different levels: state, provincial,\n2.\ncooperative, and private. At the state level, the Inland Waterway Management Unit was\nresponsible to the Department of Infrastructure Management under the Ministry of Transport\n(MOT). This responsibility has been transferred to a newly established Viet Nam Inland\nWaterways Administration (VIWA). VIWA exercises management and operational\nresponsibility for all navigable river and canal systems in Viet Nam. This responsibility extends\nto maintenance and development of navigation facilities and buoys and shipping channels.\nOwn account and provincial or district (small ports) are operated by the company or local\ngovernment authority. MOT also has two river transport enterprises, but there is no\nmanagement connection between these and VIWA. The main activities of VIWA are\nengineering, maintenance, and where possible, improvements to the waterway system such as\ndredging and canal works, installation and maintenance of navigational aids, and the\nhydrographic survey and charting of the system.\n\nin 1992, 15 million tons of cargo was transported by river, accounting for 27.5\n3.\npercent of Viet Nam's total domestic freight volume, and  22.3 percent of the total passenger\ntraffic. In the north, state-owned enterprises account for 30 percent of the total tonnage and\n47 percent of the ton-km transported. In the south, the corresponding figures are 10 percent\nand 15 percent. Passenger transport is organized by provincial fleets. Trends in inland\nwaterways transport are sustained growth in the south and sustained traffic in the north.\n\nThe Red River system has five major ports: Hanoi, Habac, Hoa Binh, Ninh Binh,\n4.\nand Viet Tn. About 1,500 barges grossing 400,000 tons operate with about 280 tugs totaling\n50,000 horse power. In 1991/93, a total of 7.5 million tons of freight were transported annually\nin the system over an average distance of 220 km. The main commodity transported was coal,\ntotaling 3.6 million tons, from the Quang Ninh coal mine; most of this was carried to three\npower plants: (i) Bac Lang, 190 km from the mine; (ii) Ninh Binh, 320 km; and (iii) Uong Bi, 60\nkm. The rest of the freight consisted primarily of construction materials, foodstuffs, and\npetroleum products.\n\nThe Mekong system has 4,500 km of navigable channels, of which some 2,600\n5.\nkm can be considered as principal waterways connecting Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) with the\nsea and approximately 30 river ports in the south. Total fleet capacity is estimated at 260000\ntons. The Mekong system is navigable for small sea-going ships all the way to Phnom Penh,\n332 km from the coast. HCMC port. which is on the Saigon River 85 km from the coast and is\nconnected to the Mekong by canals, is deep enough to accommodate large ocean-going\n\n\f31\t\n\nAppendix 1, page 2\n\nvessels and is thus the focus of inland navigation in the Mekong Delta; export cargo such  as\nrice is transshipped here, commonly directly from river barge to sea-going ship. Other\nimportant ports are in Can Tho and An Giang.\n\nB.\t\n\nRailways\n\n6. Presently, the rail network consists of six single-track lines in operation and two\nbranch lines, totaling 2,561 km about 60 percent of which are in the north of the country.\nAbout 84 percent of the network is narrow gauge, 7 percent is standard gauge and 9 percent\nis combination of narrow and standard gauges. The main trunk line linking Hanoi to HCMC is\n1,730 km long. There are 260 stations and, as an average, there is one passing track per 8\nkm. of line.\n\n7.\nAll lines are operated by the Viet Nam National Railways (VNR), which  is\nconstituted as self-financing state enterprise based in Hanoi.  Three subsidiary unions, one\neach in the north, center, and south of the country, are responsible for the management and\noperation of the rail system. A number of other unions of enterprises are responsible for\nvarious aspects of the rail industry. MOT gives overall direction to VNR and provides\nconstruction funds for new routes. VNR is required to obtain approval for its expenditure plans\nfrom MOT and other Government departments as are the other transport subsectors.\n\n8.\nFollowing deregulation, passenger traffic decreased from 24 million passengers\nin 1987 to 11 million in 1990, and further to 8.8 million in 1992. VNR statistics show a sharp\ndecrease in freight traffic, from 4 million tons in 1988 to 2.8 million in 1992, partly explained by\na change n recording procedures. Seven major commodities\u2014i.e. coal, construction\nmaterials, cement, apatite, fertilizer, machinery, and ore\u2014accounted for 83 percent of the\nfreight traffic in 1992. Haulage distances vary considerably from 1.405 km for foodstuffs to\n142 km for construction materials, with an average of 367 km.\n\n9.\nThe railway system suffered extensive damage during the Viet  Nam war when\nvirtually all bridges in the north were destroyed. Since then, bridges with a total length of\n10,000 m have been repaired, but many only on a temporary basis. Although about 1,300 km\nof new track were laid since 1975 (much of it south of Da Nang, where services had ceased\nand rails had been partly dismantled), overall track conditions are generally poor, rails are\nweak on many stretches, and rails and sleepers are often in deteriorated and unsafe condition.\n\nC.\t\n\nPorts\n\n10.\nSeven of the largest ports for sea-going vessels are under the Viet Nam\nNational Maritime Group (VINAMARINE). In terms of throughput, Saigon Port is the largest\n(4.3 million tons in 1990), followed by Hai Phong (2.5 million tons), Da Nang (430 million tons),\nQuy Nhon (300 million tons), Nha Trang (221 million tons). Quang Ninh (298 million tons). and\nNghe Tinh (80 million tons).\n\n11.\nIn addition, some ports are exclusively for coal loading and are administered by\nthe Ministry of Energy, such as Cam Pha and Hong Hai ports in Quang Ninh Province. The\nmain oil ports, administered by the ministry of Heavy Industry, are in the vicinity of Hong Hal,\nHal Phong, Da Nang, HCMC. and Vung Tau. A number of small ports are managed by\nprovinces: the largest ones are Ben Nge in HCMC and Can Tho on the Bassac River.\n\n\f32\t\n\nAppendix 1, page 3\n\n12.\nInternational (overseas) traffic in ports reached nearly 10 million tons in 1990,\nwhile coastal freight totaled about 3 million. Of the total international traffic, 60 percent was\nloaded or unloaded in VINAMARINE  ports while 40 percent of the movements were in\ndedicated ports for petroleum products or coal. Commodities with the largest international\ntraffic volumes were petroleum products (30 percent of the total); food grain (16 percent);\nfertilizer (12 percent); and coal (8 percent).\n\n13.\nAll ports under VINAMARINE handle general cargo, bulk cargo, and containers.\nOnly the ports of Hal Phong and Saigon have berths for container carriers. Port equipment is\ngenerally old. In most cases, port operations are not efficiently conducted, partly due to the\ninadequacy of cargo handling e q uipment. None of the ports are adequately equipped for\nhandling containers.\n\n14.\nVINAMARINE, based in Hai Phong, was reformed in 1990 from the previous\nstate organization, General Marine Department, which was established in 1975. In late 1992,\nVINAMARINE was replaced by the Maritime Transport Administration. As VINAMARINE, the\norganization provided overall management of the ports and shipping system and. through its\nvarious subsidiaries, owned the country's seven ventures with Vietnamese and overseas\ninterests and held part ownership of a further eight shi pping companies. Another 30\nenterprises under VINAMARINE ownership included stevedoring, freight forwarding and\nshipping, pilotage, harbor services, chandlers, a bank, a hoteL and other maritime service\ncompanies. A maritime college that provides ships offic& and crew trainina also came under\nthe purview of VINAMARINE,\n\n15.\nIn the new structure. trw Transport Aaministration is to be the policy\nand regulatory agency for the marine sector. p rovidina rnanagemen a. the state leveL out wil\nno longer exercise direct control over the business management of MOT-owned enterprises in\nthe maritime industry.\n\nD.\t\n\nAir Transport\n\n16.\nOf 16 airports in the country . onl y three (No Ba at HanoL Than Son Nhat at\nHCMC, and at Dc Nang) nave internationa passenger and freight handling services. Four\nairports (a Hal Phong, Nne Trang Buon Me Tnout. and Phu Quoc) provide scheouled\ndomestic services. The remaining nine airports are not served on a scheduled basis. Terminal\nfacilities, even at the three main airports, are in urgent need of upgrading and modernizing.\nSmaller airports have little chance to develop in the near future.\n\n17.\nThere are international scheduled flights between the two iargest airports in Viet\nNam (Nd Bai and Than Son Nhat) and about 15 cities, mostly in Soutneast Asia and Europe.\nin 1990, the three international airports handled about 18,600 aircraft, more than half flying\ninternational flights. Than Son Nhat is the most active airport in the country.\n\n18.\nThere were 8.666 domestic aircraft movements and 10,010 international\nmovements in 1990. The number of domestic passengers is estimated at 273,000\u2014an\nincrease of 15 percent over 1989\u2014and the number of international passengers at 579,000\nover half being foreign visitors. International traffic grew at an. annuai rate of over 30 percent\ndurng the last four years. Passenger services, both on the grounc and in the ai are below\nstandard\n\n\f33\t\n\nAppendix 1, page 4\n\nVietnam Airlines is a fully Government-owned entity. As of 1991, its\n19.\nresponsibilities included (i) management, operation, and development of the national airline; (ii)\nmanagement and development of all airports; (iii) management and development of air\nnavigation services; (iv) fuel supply to aircraft; and (v) management of enterprises unrelated to\ncivil aviation.\n\nVietnam Airlines' fleet consists of Soviet aircraft: Tupolev 134, Antonov 24, and\n20.\nYakovlev 40. As of mid-1991, only 12 aircraft operated and they had an average utilization\nratio of three hours per day. The present aircraft fleet is inadequate because of high operating\ncosts and low occupancy rates of passenger and freight. Air navigational equipment are\ngenerally in poor condition and need to be upgraded and adapted to new technologies in order\nto cope with the maintenance requirements of modern aircraft.\n\nCivil aviation has not historically been within the authority of MOT but this was\n21.\nrecently changed. A Civil Aviation Law passed in late 1991 is a first step in modifying the\norganization of the civil aviation subsector. The Department of Civil Aviation was created\nwithin the MOT in 1992, its function being to advise the Ministry on strategic issues related to\nair transport. This department has changed to a new Civil Aviation Administration in June\n1993.\n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 2\n\nDOMESTIC FREIGHT AND PASSENGER TRANSPORT BY

Civil works will consist essentially of upgrading the level of service of\nselected provincial and district roads, and possibly commune roads, by repairing\nembankments, constructing missing drainage structures, improving road drainage systems,\nand providing gravel overlays. The works will include the protection of waterway banks when\nthese coincide with road embankments or have the potential for damaging the road. Bidding\ndocuments will be simple in their commercial and technical aspects, and will be developed at\nan early stage of Project implementation.\n\n3.\nThe Project's civil works will be packaged into contracts with values typically\naround $100,000-150.000 with a maximum of $250,000. each covering about 10-20 kilometer\n(km) of road improvement. dependino on the extent of pavement gravelling work and the\nnumber and size of structures within the road length.

The main objective of the consultancy services is to ensure that the highest\npossible construction quality is achieved. This will be done through strict supervision of the\ncontractors' activities to ensure that all work is carried out in full compliance with the\nengineering design, technical specifications, and other contract documents. A second\nobjective is to promote technology transfer by: (I) requiring the consultants to employ suitably\nqualified Vietnamese professionals and provide them with on-the-job training; and (ii)\nappointing qualified Ministry of Transport (MOT) personnel as counterparts. A third objective is\ngenerally to facilitate the implementation and liaison with all the concerned Government\nofficials and local organizations, including, but not limited to, Project Management Unit No. 1\n(PMU-1), the rural roads maintenance unions (RRMUs), the police, and the district/commune\nadministrations.\n\nB.\t\n\nScope of Services\n\n2. The services to be provided by the consultant will include (I) reviewing the\ndesign to identify inconsistencies, etc, and advising PMU-1 of the potential impacts of these;\nand undertaking additional design work where this is found to be necessary; (iii) administering\nthe civil works contracts as the Engineer, as defined in the contract documents; (iv) preparing\nprogress and other reports (primarily monthly progress and Project completion reports); (v)\nmonitoring compliance with the environmental impact mitigation measures included in the\nscope of the Project's civil works; (vi) assisting PMU-1 with monitoring the resettlement action\nplan; (vii) assisting PMU-1 with loan disbursement documentation and monitoring; and (viii)\ntraining PMU-1 and domestic consultants' staff in contract management procedures and other\nrelevant activities. On present scheduling, it is not intended that the consultant will be involved\nin selection of the contractors; this will be undertaken by PMU-1 with assistance from other\nconsultants prior to the appointment of the supervision consultant.\n\nC.\t\n\nStaffing and Other Inputs\n\nThe consultant will provide the international and senior domestic staffing defined\n3.\nin the Project's organization and staffing charts. In summary, staffing inputs will be about 300\nperson-months for internation& consultants and 600 person-months for domestic consultants,\nover a total Project period of about 42 months. In addition, the consultant will provide such\ntechnical and administrative support staff required to adequately carry out the services. Office\nand residential accommodation, vehicles, office and other equipment, and other support staff,\nwill be provided through the civil works contracts.\n\nThe consultant must structure its staffing to maximize the efficiency of the\n4.\nsupervision operation as a whole. Therefore, the Engineer/Project Manager will manage four\nadditional professional individuals who will be dispatched and utilized by the supervision teams\non a routine or as-needed basis. These individuals will be as follows:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n\nEnvironmental/Resettlement Monitor Consultant (foreign), initially full time, then\nintermittent;\nSenior Pavement/Materials Engineer (foreign), full time;\nSenior Construction Scheduler/Quantity Surveyor (foreign), 15 months;\nAssistant to the Project Manager (domestic., ful! time.\n\n\t\n\f48\t\n\nAppendix 15, Page 1\n\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE RURAL ROADS COMPONENT\n\nA.\t\n\nIntroduction\n\n1. The Project contains a component to improve selected lengths of provincial,\ndistrict, and, possibly, commune roads in Lang Son, Ha Bac, and Cao Bang provinces. The first\ntwo are the provinces through which the length of Highway 1 to be improved under the highway\nimprovement component of the Project passes. Cao Bang province adjoins Lang Son province to\nthe west and will also be affected by the Project road. The component will be implemented in two\nparts, the first broadly to develop selection methods and, using these, to select candidate roads\nto be improved, and the second to implement the improvement works. The component will be\nprepared and implemented taking into account the approach adopted for the concurrent World\nBank-financed Rural Transport Project, which has adopted a low-cost spot improvement\napproach. The objective of this approach is to improve the reliability of road access to as large a\nproportion of the provinces' populations as possible, while keeping costs low and maximizing the\nuse of local resources. The component's Executing Agency will be Project Management Unit\n(PMU-1 within the Ministry of Transport (MOT). PMU-1 will establish a Project implementation unit\n(PIU) to manage the component on a day-to-day basis. At the province level, the component will\nbe the responsibility of sub-PMUs.\n\nB.\t\n\nObjectives\n\n2. The principle obiectives of the component are to (i) assist the Government with\nimproving the selected roads. to im prove the reliability of access to inhabitants of the Project\nprovinces; and (ii) develop the capability of domestic organizations - Government and private\nsector - to prepare and implement projects of this nature. About 6D percent of the road length\nwill be selected using economic criteria; and 20 percent using social criteria to target less-\nprivileged mountain and ethnic population in areas where population density is low and economic\np otential dim and the economic return criteria of 12 percent cannot be met.\n\nC.\t\n\nScope\n\n3.\t\nbeen divided, will be broadly as foow.\n\nThe scoDe of the services, for each of the two  parts into which the component has\n\n1.\t\n\npart  I - Preparation\n\nThe activities to be undertaken b y the consultant for Par I of the services will\n\ninclude the following, to be implemented over six months.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\t\n\nreview available studies to determine poverty and other indicators for the Project\nprovinces, and undertake additional investigations and interviews that are\nnecessary to accurately define their social characteristics, in particular the\navailability and quality of rural road transport\n\nfor each of the Project provinces, identify the rurai road network using an\nappro priate road inventory approach;\n\nprioritize the roads usina a simple screening indicato oased on ponulation density.\nimorovement cos'. ano sccia an other reievsn fac:or tne ex.ored eoonorn\n\n\f(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n(vii)\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n49\t\n\nAppendix 15, Page 2\n\nrate of return should be 12 percent or higher, except for the roads selected under\npurely social criteria;\n\ndevelop technical guidelines for the improvement works, to be based on the spot\nimprovement approach and to make use of simple labor intensive methods to the\nextent possible and appropriate;\n\nbased on a study of existing institutional arrangements, develop a Project\nimplementation structure that will allow the component to be effectively prepared,\nmanaged, and implemented;\n\nanalyze the available contractor resources in the provinces, in terms of number of\ncontractors, capability, resources, etc, and develop an approach to effectively\ninvolve these contractors in the component;\n\norganize appropriate training programs for Government staff involved with the\ncomponent, drawing on the resources of provinces that have received similar\ntraining under the World Bank's Rural Transport Project, to enable them to carry\nout the preparation work in their provinces.\n\n2.\t\n\nPart 2\u2014 Implementation\n\n5. Part 2 of the services will commence after the Government and the Bank have\nreviewed and agreed on the outcome of Part 1, in particular on the selection of roads to be\nimproved, technical aspects, and institutional arrangements. The consultant's Part 2 activities, to\nbe implemented over about two years, will include the following, in support of the PIU and the\nsub-PM Us:\n\ngeneral coordination, including planning and budget activities;\n\nengineering and technical matters;\n\nProject and contract management, including supervision, monitoring, evaluating,\nand reporting;\n\nfinancial management, including providing advice on managing and accounting for\nthe loan funds disbursed by the Bank to the component's imprest account;\n\ninstitutional strengthening, including training for Government personnel and for\nprivate sector contractors undertaking the component's civil works;\n\npreparation of manuals for Project management, technical aspects of road\nconstruction, procurement, maintenance, and other relevant activities;\n\n(vii)\n\nassistance with procuring civil works and equipment; and\n\n(viii)\n\nreview, assessment and analysis of the social impact of rural road improvements\nunder the Project and preparation of benchmark information to evaluate/review on\na regular basis the impacts on the surrounding population.\n\n\f50\t\n\nAppendix 15, Page 3\n\nD.\t\n\nStaffing and Other Inputs\n\n6. The consultant will provide two long-term specialists, and a number of short-term\nspecialists, all international, for a total input of about 40 person-months. The long-term specialists\nwill be an adviser and a construction supervisor. In addition, about 240 person-months of\ndomestic consultants will be required. The consultant will be provided with office accommodation,\nfacilities, and resources by the PIU and the PPMUs. These will be financed through the Project\nloan.\n\nE.\t\n\nReporting and Documentation Requirements\n\n7. The consultant will provide PMU-1 and the Bank with an inception report, a design\nreport, a procurement report, monthly progress reports, and a Project completion report. The\nconsultant will also provide draft and final bid documents. The consultant will submit these reports\nand documents in the form and number of copies specified by PMU-1 and the Bank, in\naccordance with the implementation schedule agreed during contract negotiations.\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 16, page 1\n\nA.\t\n\nIntroduction\n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN\n\n1.\nDuring Project preparation, it became apparent that roadside, or ribbon,\ndevelopment was so extensive in the southern 60 kilometer (km) length of the Project road, and\nfor considerable but isolated lengths in the northern 100 km, that the existing alignment could not\nbe improved to the standard required for a national highway without substantial involuntary\nresettlement. Initial surveys indicated that about 20,000 residents, in about 5,000 households,\nwould have to move. In the northern section, the requirement for resettlement was less\nsubstantial, but the existing road traversed a mountain pass, with very poor horizontal and vertical\nalignments. From traffic safety and economic considerations, it was considered desirable to\nimprove the alignment over this length wherever possible.\n\nTo reduce the resettlement and alignment problems to acceptable proportions,\n2.\nextensive lengths of the existing highway would be by-passed by new alignments. As finally\ndesigned, the Project road will consist of about 110 km of new alignment (60 km in the south, the\nfirst two-lane stage of an ultimate six-lane divided dual-carriageway highway, and about 50 km in\nthe north). The remaining 58 km will remain predominately on the existing alignment.\n\n3. Although the proposed alignment was selected\nenvironmental impacts 1 and does reduce the resettlement problem,\ninvoluntarily resettle about 3,400 residents in about 960 households.\nwill have to be acquired, most rural but some urban. As part of\ndetailed social impact survey was carried out, on the basis c\nresettlement and rehabilitation plan has been prepared.\n\nto minimize social and\nit will still be necessary to\nAbout 450 hectares of land\nhe Project's preparation. a\nf which a comprehensive\n\nB.\t\n\nPrinciples of Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n\nThe principles of land acquisition and resettlement for the Project are derived from\n4.\ntwo sources. First, the Bank has formally set out its requirements in its  Policy Paper on\nInvoluntary Resettlement, Second, the Government has promulgated a number of decrees and\nregulations that define its approach to land acquisition and resettlement resulting from\ndevelopment projects. The basic approach adopted by the Government is in accord with the that\nof the Bank, and essentially with that of the World Bank, which has invested considerable effort\nin encouraging and assisting the Government to adopt principles and procedures that comply with\ninternational practice.\n\nThe common objective of these policies is to ensure that people displaced by the\n5.\nProject (Project affected persons - PAPs) should generally be at least as well off, if not better off,\nthan they would have been without the Project. The land acquisition and resettlement plans have\nbeen prepared with this as a guiding principle. The parameters addressed, and the manner in\nwhich they have been addressed, are summarized in Table 1.\n\nSee the Pro j ect's Environmental Impact Assessment report for details of the approach adopted for corridor\nana alianment selection and for identif y ing and mittoating socra and environmental impacts\n\n\t\n\f52\n\nAppendix 16, page 2\n\nTable 1: Resettlement Parameters and Approach\n\nParameter\t\n\nApproach Applied\n\n1. Involuntary resettlement should be minimized \t\n\n2. Plans should be prepared for those displaced\n\n3. There is to be community participation\n\nNew alignments have been selected where high\npopulation densities would have necessitated\nsubstantial resettlement.\n\nSocioeconomic surveys have been completed; PAPs\nhave been identified; and their land, buildings, and\nother assets enumerated.\n\nDuring the surveys, meetings were held at the\nprovince, district, town, and commune levels, with\nofficials and with residents. Further community\nparticipation and consultation will be conducted\nthrough the provincial, district, and commune\nresettlement committees (PRCs, DRCs and CRCs)\nfollowing the completion of the detailed measurement\nsurvey (DMS) and the ethnic minorities action plan and\nprior to implementation of the resettlement action plan\n(RAP). These consultations will be supplemented by a\npublic information campaign conducted by the Project\nmanagement unit. A Resettlement Information Booklet\nwill also be prepared and distributed by the PMU for all\nstockholders (affected people, PRCs, DMCs, CRCs)\nthat includes the basic features of the RAP\n(compensation/resettlement principles, procedures,\nand entitlements of the PAPs)\n\nCompensation will be provided for land, structures,\ncrops, etc, in accordance with existing procedures. The\nRAP includes provisions for relocation allowances,\nassistance with dismantling, transporting and\nreconstructing structures, alternative employment\ntraining, and 6 months rental subsidies for PAPs who\nare tenants.\n\nResettlement areas to be developed, with land,\nutilities, and access.\n\nGovernment will engage a domestic agency\nacceptable to the Bank, under terms of reference also\nacceptable to the Bank, to monitor the land acquisition\nand resettlement program. and to report on it to the\nGovernment and the Bank.\n\nThe corridor and alignment selection process have\nincluded environment and resettlement aspects as\nmajor factors; the initial road alignment has been\naltered to minimize impacts on people (land\nacquisition and resettlement) and Project schedules\nincluding the loan processing schedule, and to take\ninto account land acquisition and resettlement\nschedules.\n\n4.

The 1993 Land Law is a comprehensive land administration law, superseding the\nearlier 1987 version. The new law is arguably one of the most important and fundamental laws to\nhave been promulgated since the country's independence, and has had a profound effect on the\neconomy and on people's lives. In almost all respects, the Land Law gave the people access to\nland through land user rights which are similar to private ownership. The law, which went into\neffect on 15 October 1993, covers a wide range of issues. A comprehensive summary is included\nin the Project's resettlement action plan. Some of the more important issues that are relevant to\nland usage, acquisition, and resettlement, are summarized below, with some explanatory notes.\nThese issues have also been chosen to illustrate the often substantial differences in the concepts\nof land ownership and usage between socialist and more market-oriented economies.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n(vii)\n\nLand belongs to the people, with the State as its sole administrator. No private\norganization or individual has the right to own land.\n\nThe State reserves the right to allocate land and determine its usage.\n\nFamilies and individuals who have been allocated land have the right to exchange\ntheir land for another piece; transfer their right to use the land to another party; and\nrent bequeath or use their right to the land as collateral. These privileges are the\nmost significant aspect of the Land Law, in effect transferring management of the\nland back to individuals. There are, however, some important management\ndecisions the State still reserves for itself.\n\nThe Peoples' Councils at all levels (province, district, and commune) are\nresponsible for the administration of land use in their localities; the Peoples'\nCommittees at all levels are responsible for managing land issues in their domains.\n\nBased on its usage, land is classified as agricultural, forestry, rural residential,\nurban, specialized, or unused. The issue of land usage remains one of the last\nimportant management decisions that has not been turned over to private\nindividuals. Reflecting what is primarily a fear that scarce agricultural land will be\ntransferred for industrial or residential use, the Government retains exclusive\nauthority over the determination of land usage. This issue is becoming increasingly\nmore controversial, as recently promulgated rules and regulations suggest.\n\nThe State reserves the right to determine the value of all kinds of land for the\npurpose of taxation, collection of fees, allocation and compensation. These values\nwill be determined by region and time period.\n\nThe State reserves the right to appropriate land when truly necessary, in cases of\nnational defense or security, or national and public interest. In these cases, the\nland user will be compensated for loss of possessions. \"National and public\ninterest\" is defined in Decree No 90-OP as including all transportation and\ninfrastructure projects (this provides the basis for the right-of-way acquisition\ncrucial to the implementation of the Project).\n\n\f(ix)\n\n(x)\n\n(xi)\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n(vii)\n\n54\t\n\nAppendix 16, page 4\n\n(viii) Before land is appropriated, the user must be informed of the reason for\nappropriation, time schedule and plan for resettlement, if necessary, and options\nfor compensation.\n\nCertificates verifying the household and individual's right to use the land will be\nissued to those who have been lawfully allocated land by the local government.\nThis certification has not always been implemented incorrectly.\n\nIndividuals who have been allocated agricultural, forest, or residential land, have\nthe right to bequeath this land in accordance with the inheritance law.\n\nIndividuals allocated agricultural land have the right to rent this land out for a\nmaximum of three years if they lack the resources for production or are\nexperiencing economic difficulties.\n\n2.\t\n\nOther Relevant Laws and Regulations\n\n7. A substantial number of other laws, regulations, and decrees are relevant to land\nacquisition and resettlement. The more important of these are listed below: a summary of each is\nprovided in the Project's Resettlement Action Plan.\n\nResidence Law, 26 March 1991, of the State Council, which gives individuals the\nright to own residential housing;\n\nDecree No. 60-CF. 5 July 1994. property ownership and the right to use urban\nresidential land:\n\nDecree No. 64-CP, 15 September 1993. reguatons concerning the allocation of\nagricultural land to households and individuals to use in a long-term and stable\nmanner for agricultural production:\n\nOfficiai Message No 1044/KTN, of the Prime Minister. 3 March 1995, declaring a\nmoratorium on the transfer of rice-land to other uses;\n\nDecree No. 87/CP, 17 August 1994. regulations concerning the pricing of different\nland types;\n\nDecree No. 90/CP, 17 August 1994, compensation for appropriation of land for\ndefense, security, or national and public interest; and\n\ntransportation regulations, of which there are a considerable number; the most\nrecent is Decree No. 36/CP which, inter a/ia, deals with clearance of obstructions\nand encroachments from highway rights-of-way.\n\nD.\t\n\nSocioeconomic Survey\n\n8. As part of Project Preparation, detailed dwelling unit, asset, and land-use surveys\nwere carried out in June, July, and August 1995. The dwelling unit survey (affected structures)\nwas conducted during June and July 1995 on approximately 90 percent of the affected population.\nThis survey was camed out before the alignment was finally fixed. so that the objective of minimizing\n\n\f55\t\n\nAppendix 16, page 5\n\nresettlement through appropriate alignment selection could be achieved. Accordingly, the number of\nhouseholds interviewed (1,300) at the time was greater than necessary. Ultimately, once the alignment\nhad been fixed, the number of affected households was reduced to 960. Also, to assist with\npreparation of a plan for households that will have agricultural and forest land affected by the Project,\nthe survey teams conducted a sample survey of agricultural villages in the Project area in August\n1995. This survey, which was to determine the impact of the Project on agricultural activities, was\ncarried out over a two-week period, during which 895 households were interviewed.\n\n9.\t\nand summarized as follows:\n\nThe results of the surveys are presented in the Project's Resettlement Action Plan\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nThe affected population is estimated to be 3,460 in 960 households.\n\nOf the people affected, about 31 percent are from ethnic minority groups, mainly\nTay and Nung, located mainly in Lang Son Province, and about 18 percent of\nhousehold heads are war veterans, for whom the Government provides special\nprograms.\n\nLand-use certificates are held by 63 percent of affected people, and a further 36\npercent of affected people have verbal permission from the local authority to use\nthe land. Less than 1 percent of affected people have no legal permit to use the\nland on which they reside.\n\nE.\t\n\nCompensation Issues and Procedures\n\n10.\t\nsocioeconomic surveys and the Government's and the Bank's requirements and procedures.\n\nThe approach to land acquisition and resettlement is based on the Project's\n\n1.\t\n\nDefinitions\n\na.\t\n\nProject Affected People\n\n11. Project Affected People (PAP) means (i) anyone whose name appears in the June\nand July 95 survey list, prepared as part of the Project's resettlement survey, or a subsequent\ndetailed measurement survey (DMS); (ii) anyone who has become affected by a subsequent\nrealignment of the Project road; (iii) anyone who has become affected as a consequence of the\nrural roads component and whose structures would be partly dismantled or relocated or whose\nland would be acquired for the road works or for resettlement site development as a consequence\nof the Project. PAPs include people within the project road length who have been affected by the\nimplementation of Decree 36/OP.\n\nb.\t\n\nClear area\n\n12. For the existing alignment, the area to be cleared includes widening the road to the\ndesign width (defined as the toe-to-toe width for embankments and top of cut to top of cut width\nfor cuts) plus 7 meters (m) on either side of the highway (for rural areas) and 3-5 m (for urban\nareas), measured perpendicular to and away from the toe of the embankment slope, or the top of\nthe cut slope. For new alignment, the clear area includes the width between the toe of the\nembankment slope or the top of the cut slope plus an additional 7 m on either side.\n\n\f56\t\n\nAppendix 16, page 6\n\nc.\t\n\nStructures - Legality\n\n13. Legal structures that belong to the PAP include the structures within the right-of-\nway and built before 1982 or, if built after 1982 has permission from the responsible authority.\nIllegal structures that belongs to the PAP are within the right-of-way and were built after 1982\nwithout any eligible permission.\n\nd.\t\n\nLand\u2014Legality\n\n14.\t\nland belongs to a PAP, but the owner has inadequate legal documentation.\n\nLegal land belongs to a PAP, and the owner has a legal title to the land. Illegal\n\ne.\t\n\nEncroachment\n\n15.\t\n\nLand that a PAP occupies but does not own.\n\n2.\t\n\nCompensation and Assistance Policies\n\na.\t\n\nStructures\n\n16. For legal structures, compensation will be 100 percent of new construction cost.\nFor illegal structures, assistance equivalent to 60 percent of new construction cost will be\nprovided. Unit prices for new construction will be as established periodically by relevant provincial\npeople's committees (PPCs) based on materials and labor costs. These are updated\napproximately every three months. Compensation and assistance will be provided in the form of\ncash or kind or both.\n\nb.\t\n\nLand\n\n17. Compensation will be paid for land that is taken permanently for road construction;\nis in the clear area (see para. 12) and is covered by structures as part of the road construction (in\nurban areas only); and is taken for resettlement site development (including access roads).\nCompensation will be made in accordance with the following methods: (i) legal PAPs whose land\nwill be acquired are compensated land for land with the same value and usage purpose or\ncompensated in cash and land, at the PAPs' option; and (ii) PAPs whose loss of land is small can\nbe compensated wholly in cash.\n\n16. PAPs with legal residential land, if the land remaining after the land required for the\nroad and clear area is less than 40 square meters (m 2) in urban areas and 60 m 2 (in rural areas),\ncan opt to stay or move to a resettlement site. The criteria for relocation in a resettlement site are\nas follows:\n\n(I) The PAP's land value is first calculated in accordance with the prices set in Decree\n87/CP to convert the acquired land to the replacement land. After the conversion, if\nthe acquired land is smaller than 60 m 2 , its owner is entitled to a 60 m 2 plot in the\nresettlement area;\n\n(ii) If the lost land is larger than 60 m 2 , its owner is entitled to a plot in the resettlement\narea equivalent to the lost area, provided that it is no larger than 120 m 2 . The\ndifference, if any, will be compensated as cash.\n\n\f57\t\n\nAppendix 16, page 7\n\n(iii) PAPs who would lose only their shops (without residence) will be provided a plot\nequivalent to the affected area, with a minimum area of 14 m 2 , in a resettlement\nsite or a business center.\n\n19. For PAP's with illegal residential land but who, based on existing regulations, are\neligible for a legal land use right title, land-use will be legalized and the PAPs will be\ncompensated in the same manner as for legal PAPs.\n\nc.\t\n\nEncroachers\n\n20. Encroachers, presently estimated to make up about 0.4 percent of PAPs\n(equivalent to 4 households), in principle will not be compensated for land, but will be provided\nwith assistance equivalent to 60 percent of new construction cost and with relocation of\nstructures. Consideration will be focused on the poorest groups of encroachers to give them a\nplot of 60 m 2 in a resettlement area if it is confirmed by the local authority that they have\ninadequate or no land for a residence.\n\n3.\t\n\nCompensation Rates for Land (including  land taken for reseftlement sites)\n\n21. Compensation for land will be based on the prices established for each class,\ncategory, and location of land, as issued by relevant PPCs pursuant to Decree 87/C P. Present\nvalues are set out in the Project's Resettlement Action Plan. The category of land defined for\ncompensation will be the one defined when the land was originally allocated to the owner. The\nvalue of land for the purpose of compensation will be the current value of similar land.\n\n4.\t\n\nCompensation for Structures and Other Physical Assets\n\n22. Compensation for structures and physical assets will be decided on the basis of\nDecree 90/OP, subject to the amounts to be paid to PAPs for these items will not be less than the\nnew replacement cost at the time individual compensation entitlements are calculated.\n\n5.\t\n\nCompensation for Trees, Crops and Graves\n\n23. Compensation will follow clauses 12 and 13 of Chapter III of Decree 90/OP. Details\nof amounts to be paid will be provided by the PPCs. The compensation rates for crops will reflect\ncurrent values for the crops, with appropriate provision for lost future crop income from the PAP's\nland.\n\n6.\t\n\nOther Assistance\n\n24. PAPs who are to resettle will be entitled to a relocation and subsistence allowance,\nwith a minimum value of D500,000 (about $50). PAPs whose structures are partially dismantled\nwill be entitled to half this amount. Each household will be entitled to send a member to a training\ncourse for simple skills, of duration 3-6 months, with the costs to be covered by the Project. Social\nassistance will be made available for the poorest and minority groups. Farmer PAPs who will lose\nmore than 20 percent of their total income will be entitled to training in a suitable career in\naddition to compensation for land and crops.\n\n\f58\t\n\nAppendix 16, page 8\n\nF.\t\n\nBudget Issues\n\n25. The cost of land acquisition and resettlement is presently estimated to be about\n$15.5 million. This consists of about $11.0 million for land, $1.5 million for dwelling unit\ncompensation, $1.6 million for other compensation, and about $1.4 million for administration and\ncontingencies. The total amount, although included in the Project cost, is to be financed entirely\nby the Government from its own resources, and will be required, in approximately equal parts, in\nthe 1997 and 1998 fiscal years.\n\nG.\t\n\nOrganizational Responsibility\n\n26. The Ministry of Transport (MOT) is the Executing Agency for the Project, acting\nthrough Project Management Unit No. 1 (PMU-1). PMU-1 will be responsible for the land\nacquisition and resettlement programs, for which it has established within its organization a\nresettlement department. This department has undertaken similar tasks for earlier projects\nfinanced by the Bank and the World Bank financed projects. PMU-1 will liaise closely with the\nprovincial, district, and commune people's committees in the affected area, who have established\nresettlement committees and wifl be closely involved with the programs. Training or\ncompensation standards, procedures, entitlements, implementation, grievance, and monitorino\nprocedures for the provincial resettlement committees (PRCs), district resettlement committees\n(DRCs), and commune resettlement committees (CRCs) will be conducted by PMU-1. A Public\nInformation campaign will be conducted and an information booklet will be prepared and\ndistributed by PM U-I.\n\nH.\t\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n27. A detailed implementation schedule for the land acquisition and resettlement\nprograms was agreed between the Government and the Bank during appraisal. Resettlement and\nland compensation schedules will be completed before construction activities begin in an area.\nPAPs will be informed at least three months prior to the intended displacement of the various\noptions available, the compensation rates, and the implementation schedule and procedures to\nenable PAPs to make informed choices regarding the available options and to prepare for\nrelocation, identification of replacement lands, and alternative livelihoods. PAPs will be given at\nleast two months final notice prior to demolition or land acquisition, and all compensation\npayments will be paid and resettlement sites identified at least one month prior to the actual\ndislocation. In essence, the schedule requires that the actual programs be completed in two\nyears, commencing in January 1997. Preliminary activities, including detailed surveys, final\nvaluations, preparation and submission of budget re q uirements, and establishment of monitoring\nprocedures, will be completed by 31 December 1996.\n\nI.\t\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\n28. PMU-1. will engage a suitable domestic agency acceptable to the Bank, under\nterms of reference acceptable to the Bank, to monitor the land acquisition and resettlement\nprograms. The agency will provide PMU-1 will status reports each quarter from January 1997 to\nDecember 1998, or until the programs have been completed. PMU-1 will provide the Bank with\ncopies of these reports. In addition, PMU-1 will ensure that the Project's consultants include in\ntheir progress reports the status of the resettlement action plan (RAP, to include information on\nlocation and numbers of people relocated, compensation amounts paid b y item, and assistance\nprovided to PAPs. Once the land acquisition and resettlement  p rograms have been completed.\n\n\f59\t\n\nAppendix 16, page 9\n\nPMU-1 will provide the Bank with a final report, to be followed two years later by a follow-up\nevaluation of the resettlement program, setting out the extent to which the program has achieved\nits primary objective, that the well-being of the people affected by the Project should be no worse\nthan it would have been had the Project not been implemented. The evaluation, to include\ncomprehensive socioeconomic analysis techniques, will include recommendations for mitigation\nmeasures required to remedy shortcomings that have become evident.\n\nJ.\t\n\nGrievance Procedures\n\n29. To ensure that affected people have avenues for redressing their grievances related to\nany aspect Of land acquisition and resettlement, detailed procedures for redressing grievances have\nbeen established for the Project.\n\n30. Any person who is aggrieved by any aspect of the resettlement program, he or she\ncan lodge a written or oral grievance with the commune peoples committee or commune\nresethement committee. If a person is not satisfied with the decision, he or she has a right to\nappeal to the relevant district resettlement committee, the District Inspectorate. If a satisfactory\nresolution is not reached, the person can appeal to the provincial level. If an oral complaint is\nmade, it will be recorded by the committee to which it is made and processed. Grievances\nregistered with commune and district resettlement committees will be conveyed by them to the\nprovince resettlement committees. The PPC must resolve the issue within 21 days. Detailed\nimplementation of the process will be in line with Decree 38 and its attached guidelines.\n\na.\t\n\nStage I\n\nb.\t\n\nStage 2\n\n31. lIthe person making the complaint is not satisfied with the decision or receives no\nresponse within 21 days of registering the grievance, he or she can appeal to the local office of PMU-1\nfor redressing the grievance. The appeal should be lodged within three months of registering the\noriginal complaint. PMU-1 will provide the affected person with a decision within one month of\nregistering the appeal.\n\nc.\t\n\nContents of grievances\n\n32. The grievances lodged by an affected person can relate to any aspect of the land\nacquisition and resettlement programs including the compensation offered. The detailed\nprocedures for redressing grievances and the appeal process will be publicized widely in the area\naffected by the Project through a resettlement information booklet to be distributed to all affected\npersons.\n\n\f60\t\n\nAppendix 17, page 1\n\nECONOMIC EVALUATION\n\nA.\t\n\nBase Case and Options\n\n1.\nThe northern terminus of the Project section of National Highway No. I starts at the\nPeople's Republic of China (PRC) border crossing point near Lang Son. Moving southward the\nroad passes through Lang Son Province and crosses into Ha Bac Province at kilometer (km) 102,\ninto Hanoi Province at km 161, and is joined National Highway No. 5 at km 168, which is the\nsouthern terminus. The northern section from the PRC border to the Border with Ha Bac\nProvince (Ni) (102 km) is lightly populated mainly because of the rolling, hilly, and rugged\nnature of the land and it's limited usefulness because of deforestation. The road is in very poor\ncondition and the vertical and horizontal curvatures are often substandard for modem traffic. The\nbase case for this section was to improve the road along the existing right-of-way, which would\nresult not only in high construction costs but other costs associated with land acquisition and\nresettlement. During the feasibility study, various options were investigated and resulted in\nfollowing the existing alignment with bypasses or new and better alignments (for example, a\nbypass of the Sai Ho Pass following an existing but abandoned railway alignment) and bypasses\nof towns where the alignments were often poor and large-scale resettlement would be required.\n\n2.\nThe southern section from the northern border of Ha Bac Province to the junction\nwith National Highway No. 5 (N2), with a length of about 66 km, passes through intensively\ncultivated farm land with high density mainly strip development along the right-of-way. The\nalternative to widening and improving the existing road was to bypass the smaller towns near the\nnorthern terminus and then to move to a completely new alignment of about 51 km, bypassing the\nbuilt-up areas through to the junction with National Highwa y Nc.5 at Hanoi. The new alignment o\nN2 will initially be constructed to a two-iane standard but is designed for expansion to six lanes  K\naccommodate increasing traffic volumes. For NI and N2. the alternative was selected or\neconomic, engineering, and sociai impact grounas. In both cases the existing highway wili\ncontinue in service and will accommodate short local tri ps by motor vehicles as well as the high\nvolume of local slower moving traffic such as motorbikes. bicycles, iivestock, and pedestrians.\n\nB.\t\n\nMethodology\n\n3. The economic evaluation was carried out for the two homogeneous road sections\n(Ni and N2) and for the Project as a whole. Vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings and\nmaintenance cost savings were the only benefits quantified in the economic evaluation. Project\ncosts included construction, supervision, right-of-way and resettlement, maintenance, and\nphysical contingencies. Economic costs were used throughout mainly by adjusting the estimated\nfinancial costs by 5 percent to account for taxes and duties and a small adjustment for the\nshadow wage rate of local labor. For the derivation of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR),\nthe cost and benefit streams were estimated over a 24-year period starting in 1997 from the\nbeginning of construction until the year 2020, which covers the economic life of the road\nimprovements, including periodic resurfacing of the pavements. Appropriate sensitivity tests were\nthen carried out along with the Sensitivity Indicators.\n\nC.\t\n\nRoad Condition and Traffic\n\n4.\t\nNi from the northern terminus at the PRO border to the southern border of Lang\nSon Province is 100.8 km long, is narrow (7 to 8 meters [ml) and has various asphalt paved\nsurfaces that are not in good condition. Roughness averages about 8 to 12 m per km, which\nvery high and results in high VOC. The horizonta and verca geometric . are functional!\\\nobsolete with an average horizontal curvature o 18 aeareeE De V.fl' whic contriute rx\n\n\f61\t\n\nAppendix 17, page 2\n\ninefficient vehicle operating characteristics. Average annual daily traffic in 1994 amounted to\n1,570 four-wheeled vehicles per day (vpd).\n\n5.\nN2 through Ha Bac Province to the junction with National Highway No.5 in Hanoi is\n67 km long, is also narrow (7 to 8 m) and, except near Hanoi where it becomes four lane, has\nvarious asphalt paved surfaces that are not in good condition and are often flooded in the wet\nseason. Roughness, while lower than the Ni section, is still high at 6.2 m per km. The horizontal\nand vertical curvatures are generally acceptable as the road mostly passes through areas\nadjacent to paddy fields. Traffic is very high, with about 4,200 four-wheeled vpd.\n\n6.\nHistoric traffic counts in Viet Nam are very limited in scope and application. The\nfeasibility study team undertook extensive traffic counts and origin-destination surveys to\ndetermine the number and type of vehicles using the Project road as well as their purpose and\norigin-destination characteristics. These data were compared with the available traffic counts and\nan analysis of the relationship between gross domestic product (GDP) growth and road traffic\ngrowth was undertaken both for data available in Viet Nam and in comparison with other\ncountries in the region when they were at a similar stage of development and their present level\nof motorization. Based on an expected average growth in GDP of 8.8 percent per year and\nelasticities of 1.53 for passengers and 1.42 for freight, annual growth rates for passenger traffic\nare estimated to be 13.5 percent and for freight, 12.5 percent until 2001. After that, growth rates\nare estimated to decline to 12.0 percent and 10.0 percent, respectively. In view of experience in\nother countries and because Viet Nam is in the early stage of modern economic development,\nthese rates are considered reasonable. A summary of the road condition and traffic is given in\nTable 1.\n\nTable 1: Road Condition and Traffic\n\nCurrent\nRoughness\t\nLevel (mlkm) I Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT)\n\nTraffic Volume 1994\n\nRoad Section\n\nAverage\n\nTwo-wheeled\t\n\nCars\t\n\nBuses\t\n\nTrucks\n\nTota l a j\t\n\npb\n\nGrowth Rate\n\n794\t\n\n653\n\n222\n\n1,4741 13.5\t\n\n12.5\n\n3.538\t\n\n2.296\n\n360i\t\n\n1,531\n\n4,1871 13.5\t\n\n12.5\n\nPRO border\nto Ha Bac\nProvincial\nBoundary\n\nNi\n\nN2\n\nHa Bac\nProvincial\nBoundary to\nJunction\nHighway No. 5\n\n9.5\n\n6.2\n\nb\t\n\nC\t\n\nExcluding two-wheeled vehicles.\nPassenger traffic to 2001 with a subsequent decline to 12.0 percent per annum thereafter\nFreight traffic to 2001 with a subsequent decline to 10 percent per annum thereafter.\n\nSource: Feasibility Study\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\f62\t\n\nAppendix 17, page 3\n\nC.\t\n\nCosts\n\n1.\t\n\nVehicle Operating Costs\n\n7.

VOCs for six typical vehicle types were estimated using the highway design and\nmaintenance-VOC model, which takes into account Project-induced changes in surface\nconditions, gradients, and vehicle speeds as well as a number of other factors such as the VOC\ncomponents (vehicle, fuel, oiL tires, crew, maintenance. interest, overhead, and insurance costs).\nThe resulting unit VOCs for the representative vehicles for the preferred alternative and the base\ncase are given in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Unit VOC for Representative Vehicles\n($/vehicle/km)\n\nVehicle Type\n\nRoad Section IBase\t\n_______________ -\t\n\nret\t\n\nre\t\n\n1\t\n\ncar\t\n\n'Jthity Vehicle\t\nBas\t\n\nBus\t\n\nBasc Pref\t\n\nj Medium Truck Heavy Truck Very Heav y T\nBase Pref\nBase Pref\t\n\nBase Pref\t\n\n1\n\nN\t\nN2\t\n\n0.15\t\n0.13\t\n\n1t\t\n1.2\t\n\n0.36 0.16\t\n\nC.26 0.16\t\n\n0.36 0.30\t\n3,32 0.30\t\n\n0.21\t\n0.18\t\n\n016\t\n0.15\t\n\n0.35\t\n0.28\t\n\n0.25 ' 0.55\t\n0.42\t\n0.23\t\n\n0.38\n0.3\n\nSource:\t\n\nFeasibility Study\n\n2.\t\n\nConstruction and Maintenance Costs\n\n8.

The area traversed by the NI\nis a rice deficit area while that area served by N2 is a rice surplus area. The movement of rice\nwill be facilitated by the improvement of the Project road. The reduced VOC resulting from the\nimproved Project road will benefit road users, particularly road transport operators. Since\ntransport charges mainly depend on road conditions, it is expected that a portion of the VOC\nsavings will be passed on to road transport users. Through this and improved efficiency, the road\nimprovements will help enable small-scale producers to participate more actively in the market\neconomy. Finally, cross-border trade with the PRC has been increasing recently. The road\nimprovement will encourage this trend through faster, safer, and more reliable transport between\nproduction and consumption centers.\n\nE.\t\n\nEconomic Evaluation\n\n10. The EIRRs have been calculated using the standard process of iterative\ndiscounting until the cost/benefit ratio is equal to one. VOCs were calculated using the HDM-\nVOC model, while the other costs and benefits were introduced exogenously. For the evaluation,\nit was necessary to compare the base-case improvement without any realignment and the\npreferred alternative, which includes a number of realignments to avoid resettlement or to\nsignificantly improve the Project road's substandard geometncs. The base EIRR for the Project\noverafi is 30.0 percent, with the EIRRs for the individual sections about the same with 30.9\npercent for Ni and 29.3 percent for N2. The alternatives with significant realignments were\nclearly preferred over the base-case improvements. The EIRRs for the base case with\nimprovements were 22 percent for Ni and 13 percent for N2. The cost of the preferred\nalternative was also significantly less than the base case with improvements. NI with the\npreferred alternative was estimated to cost $92,000 less per km than the improved base-case,\nwhile N2 was $1.55 million less per km, including construction and resettlement costs. FOr both\nstretches, the cost of improvement of the existing alignment was high mainly because of the very\nhigh costs associated with resettlement. The sensitivity of the EIRRs for the preferredcase were\nanalyzed with respect to the underlying cost and benefit parameters and the implementation\nperiod. Under the most adverse assumption of a 10 percent increase in costs and a\nsimultaneous reduction in benefits of 10 percent, the overall EIRR remains viable at 24.4 percent.\nA summary of the economic evaluation is shown in Table 3 while the cost and benefit streams are\ngiven in Table 4.\n\nTable 3: Summary of Economic Evaluation  and Sensitivit y Test\n\nEIRR in Percent\n\nRoad\nSection\n\nBase\t\nCase a\t\n\nAlternative Preferred\t\nAlternative\t\n\nI\t\nb\t\n\nC\t\n\n10% Capital\t\nCost\t\nIncrease\t\n\n10% VOC\t\nSavings\t\nReduction\t\n\nCase 1 +\nCase 2\t\n\nCombination Sensitivity lndicator'\n\nCase 1\t\n\nCase 2\n\nNi\n\nN2\n\na\t\n\nb\t\n\nNi+ N2\n\n22.0\n\n13.0\n\n18.0\n\n22.0\t\n\nI\t\n\n29.3\n\n30.9\t\n\n30.0\n\n(Case 1)\t\n29.0\t\n\n(Case 2)\n28.7\t\n\nI\t\n\n27.5\t\n\n26.2\t\n\nI\t\n\n27.3\t\n\n27.9\t\n\n27.0\t\n\n25.6\t\n\n24.4\t\n\n0.65\t\n\n0.71\n\n1.03\t\n\nI\t\n\n0.68\n\n1.08\t\n\n0.7\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nImprovement of the road stretch on the existing alignment.\nNew Construction on a totally new alignment (done for N2 only) to 4-lanes.\nFor Ni, alignment changes where needed to minimize resettlement or improve the\n\nhorizontal and vertical alignment.

The Bank's Country Operational Strategy Study for Viet Nam has two primary\nobjectives: (I) the need to enhance and sustain rapid broad-based economic growth; and (ii)\nhuman development. To facilitate these thrusts, the strategy encourages the increased use of\nlinkages, particularly transport,with a strong geographic dimension. This translates into the\nupgrading and extension of transport corridors and the use of feeder roads into rural areas to\nfoster economic opportunities and reduce poverty in underserved areas.\n\n2. The Government of Viet Nam, in its commitment to reduce poverty, is\nformulating an integrated National Program for Hunger Eradication and Poverty Reduction and\nis creating an enabling environment for poverty elimination. The initiative includes, among\nothers, a rural infrastructure component which focuses on the upgrading and extension of rural\nroads. Government has stated that rapid broad-based economic development in combination\nwith targeted infrastructure and social service provision are the best approaches for reducing\npoverty.\n\nB.\t\n\nImportance of Rural infrastructure\n\n3.\nThe Bank and the Government, acknowledge the important contribution of rural\ninfrastructure in reducing poverty. Rural infrastructure, particularly rural roads, is a critical\ndeterminant of agricultural productivity and is also associated with the development of off-farm\nincome opportunities and greater participation in the market economy. In Viet Nam. evidence\nsuggests that people who live near existing infrastructure or have reasonable access to it.\nhave higher living standards and have been able to take better advantage of the market\nreforms than those who do not (about $127 annually compared to $101 - Viet Nam Living\nStanaards Survey (VLSS), 1993). Furthermore, people living in communities located near\nreliable roads have significantly higher average per capita expenditures.\n\nIn fact, the presence and condition of rural roads and village electrification were\n4.\nalso shown to have significant impacts on paddy production (as well as on-farm and off-farm\nlabor supply). The VLSS revealed that if a community is more than 3 kilometer (km) from a\nroad, paddy productivity begins to decrease, at the substantial rate of 402 kilogram per hectare\n(kg/ha) for every additional km away from the road. Moreover, road conditions matter.\nEstimates show that yields decrease 26 kg/ha for every additional month that the road is\nimpassable. Communities with road access are also more likely to have a permanent market\nlocated in their village: to engage in more than one economic activity; to leave the village to\nseek work; to sell agricultural surplus; and to be better served by public and/or private\ntransport.\n\nThe existence of reliable rural roads appears to affect labor mobility, which in\n5.\nturn is significantly related to economic status. On average, households in communities with\nlabor mobility (e.g. which report having residents that sometimes leave the village to seek work\nelsewhere) have per capita expenditures of D1.2 million compared to D1.0 million for\ncommunities without labor mobility (World Bank, Poverty Assessment and Strategy, 1995).\n\n\f66\t\n\nAppendix 18, page 2\n\nPeople in communities characterized by labor mobility engage in more economic activities, and\nare more likely to have ready access to a reliable road.\n\n6.\nIn the absence of a good transport network, agricultural development is\nhindered in several ways: prices for inputs (fertilizer, seeds, etc.) are higher and output lower;\nmarketing of high value perishable products is impossible; farmgate prices are lower; and\naccess to new technology and information is limited. In Viet Nam, the presence of reliable\nrural roads appears to indicate improved flow of goods. services and information. This leads to\ngreater economic diversification, labor mobility, more productive use of farm land, all of which\ncontribute to improvements in living standards.\n\nSocial benefits, which are more difficult to quantify. are also likely to accrue to\n7.\nthose communities which have access to reliable roads. Educational attendance by primary\nand secondary students is likely to be enhanced by roads which are passable all year round.\nBetter educational attainment through to secondary and post-secondary education has shown\nto significantly contribute to off-farm earnings and opportunities. Teacher absenteeism is also\nlikely to decline given proper access to and from schools. Combined, these factors have\nimportant implications for economic and social development. Long term health benefits are\nalso likely to accrue. Better reiiabiiitv of existing rural roads will assist in realizing immunization\nand vitamin cam paigns. and enhancing mother-child health programs. Easier access to health\nfacilities will also serve the Government's primary and preventive health care programs,\nparticularly contagious disease control through regular and ali-weather access to communes\nand villages. In addition, a healthier rural population is an important factor in lessening the\nnumber of farming days lost due to ill-health and the consequent negative im pacts on potentia\nincome.\n\nC.\t\n\nPoverty Situation in Project Areas\n\nPoverty is widespreac in Viet Nam According to a recent study (World Bank\n8.\nPoverty Assessment Strategy, 1995). over 51  percent of the oopuiation is classified as living in\npoverty, and over 90 percent of the rural po pulation is classified as on or below the poverty\nline. Incomes are lower in the Central Highlands Region (50 percent o the national average),\nNorthern U plands Region (5 oercent where the Proiect is located, and the North Oentra\nRegion (71 percentI. However, levels of poverty are not uniform throughout each region and\nselected pockets of poverty exist in all regions. Within each of the targeted provinces (Ha Bac,\nLang Son and Cao Bang) a great deal of variation in living standards exists. The presence of\nethnic minority groups, or the p h ysical access of villages tc rural roads and waterwa y s. may\nmean marked differences within a province or district.\n\n9.\nMany rural households, often the poorest and also often belonging to minority\nethnic groups, live in remote mountainous areas where infrastructure provision is extremely\nlimited. Overall, access to infrastructure in rural areas is generally deficient, with less than one\nthird of the population having access to a combination of a passable road, public transport and\na permanent market. Only 27 percent of the rural poor have access to this combination of\ninfrastructure compared with 40 percent of the non-poor. in Cao Bang Province, for example,\nonly 63 percent of communes are served by a rural road, while less than 50 percent have a\npermanent market. In Lang son Province, only 17 percent of communes have a permanent\nmarket. In Ha Bac orovince. 53 percent of communes have such a riare\n\n\f67\t\n\nAppendix 18, page 3\n\n10.\nAccording to the VLSS, monthly per capita income for rural areas in the\nNorthern Uplands region is only D75,370 compared to the national rural average of D94,440.\nFor the rural poor in this region, the figure is even lower - D24,230 compared to the national\nrural average monthly income of D25,520. The Project area reveals an increasing disparity\neven within provinces. Average monthly income per capita in Cao Bang, Lang Son and Ha\nBac is D92,370, D97,930, and D134,950, respectively.\n\n11.\nIn Viet Nam, the prevalence of poverty amongst ethnic minority groups is much\nhigher than the national average. Poverty amongst these groups tends to be severe: almost\n66 percent of the Tay, 67 percent of the Thai, 70 percent of the Nung, and 89 percent of the\nDao, live in poverty. In Lang Son and Cao Bang, ethnic minority groups comprise at least 70\npercent of the population. Potential exists for enhanced economic opportunities for some of\nthe ethnic minority communities through improved access to a reliable all-weather rural road.\n\n12.\nHowever, two distinct groups of the poor need to be recognized. The first\ngroup, comprising the majority of the poor, are poor now but face better prospects in the\nfuture. As villages and communes in the Project area are provided with improved roads,\naccess to wider markets and increased credit facilities will develop. Members of this group\ncould progress to growing commercial crops or to taking up nonfarm work, thereby improving\ntheir living standards. This group will benefit significantly from the provision of rural\ninfrastructure, economic growth, and market liberalization.\n\n13.\nThe second group, ethnic minority communities living in remote and\nmountainous areas, which are more disconnected from economic and social infrastructure, are\nless likely to participate in a growing market economy without substantial and sustained\ngovernment assistance. Potentially, they could become exceedingly marginalized and\nvulnerable. Improving the quality of life for these more disadvantaged groups will require\ntargeted poverty reduction programs and social services alongside improved access to roads\nand other physical infrastructure.\n\n14.\nIdentifying, formulating, and implementing comprehensive policies and\nprograms on poverty reduction and rural development wilt assist in uplifting those groups that\nhave access to economic and social opportunities. Through these programs, national poverty\nlevels should be reduced, and additional resources should become available to target areas\nand regions not substantially impacted by market reforms.\n\nD.\t\n\nGovernment Polices and Programs\n\n15.\nThe Government's industrialization and modernization program for the\nremainder of the century contains a number of strategic aims. They include the development\nof agriculture, forestry in combination with agro-industries, and the rehabilitation and expansion\nof infrastructure. A large proportion of the Government's targeted investment capital during\n1996-2000 will be put in three focal geographic areas (the north, center, and south) in order to\ncreate growth regions to stimulate overall economic activity in the entire country. In particular,\nspecial attention will be given to socioeconomic development in mountain areas that are within\nthe Project influence area.\n\nTo achieve these aims, the Government intends to launch a number of\n16.\nimportant socioeconomic programs including agricultural and rural economic development,\n\n\f68\t\n\nAppendix 18, page 4\n\nindustrial development, infrastructure development, regional development, socioeconomic\ndevelopment for mountainous areas, and a national program for poverty alleviation.\n\n17.\nAgriculture will continue to play a strategic role in Viet Nam's development.\nFrom now up to the year 2000, food crops wifl provide most of Viet Nam's agricultural output.\nThis is expected to continue for a number of reasons: the Government's strategy in promoting\nincreased food production; increases in food prices are expected, providing farmers with\nincentives for commercial food production; and investment promotion for agriculture, especially\ninvestment in irrigation and rural roads, will open further opportunities for expanding markets\nand increasing crop yields.\n\n18.\nThus, Government policy has an important role to play in promoting rural\ndevelopment and reducing poverty. Increased public investment and maintenance of rural\ninfrastructure\u2014including rural roads\u2014and agricultural research and extension services will need\nto be formulated to assist in raising rural incomes in areas that have economic potential. In\naddition, rural development will also depend on enabling improvements in the functioning of\ncredit and land markets. The Government has recognized these linkages and is formulating\nnational programs for rural development that aim to take a coordinated and intersectoral\napproach to rurai develo pment (e.g., agricultural productivity, linkage with rural infrastructure,\nenvironmental protection, credit availability, social service provision, etc.). Completion of the\nstrategy is expected by late 1996.\n\n\fRRP:VIE 26312\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\nOF THE\n\nPRESIDENT\n\nTO THE\n\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nPROPOSED LOAN\n\nONA\n\nTO THE\n\nSOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIET NAM\n\nFOR THE\n\nSECOND ROAD IMPROVEMENT PROJECT\n\nOctober 1996\n\n\fCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 14 October 1996)\n\nCurrency Unit\t\nD1.00\t\n$1.00\t\n\n-\t\n=\t\n=\t\n\nDong (D)\n$0000091\nD11,027\n\nFor the purposes of calculations in this Report, a rate of Dli 000 = $1.00 has been used, which\nwas the approximate rate prevailing at the time of Project appraisal.\n\nCMEA\nEIA\nEIRR\nGDP\nISC\nHCMC\nkm\nkm2\nm\nm2\nMOT\nMPI\nNHC\nODA\nOECF\nPAP\nPIU\nPMU\nPMU-1\nPPC\nPRC\nPTA\nRRC\n\nABBREVIATIONS\n\nCouncil for Mutual Economic Assistance\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return\nGross Domestic Product\nInstitutional Strengthening Component\nHo Chi Minh City\nkilometers\nsquare kilometers\nmeters\nsquare meters\nMinistry of Transport\nMinistry of Planning and Investment\nNational Highway Component\nOverseas Development Administration\nOverseas Economic Cooperation Fund\nProjected Affected Person\nProject Implementation Unit\nProject Management Unit\nProject Management Unit No. 1\nProvincial People's Committee\nPeople's Republic of China\nProvincial Transport Authority\nRural Roads Component\n\nNOTES\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n\nThe fiscal year of the Government ends on 31 December.\nIn this Report, $ refers to US dollars.\n\n\fRRMU\nSEIA\nTA\nUK\nUNDP\nVINAMARINE\nVNR\nVNRA\nVIWA\nVOC\nvpd\n\nRegional Roads Maintenance Union\nSummary Environmental Impact Assessment\nTechnical Assistance\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited Nations Development Programme\nViet Nam National Maritime Group\nViet Nam National Railways\nViet Nam Road Administration\nViet Nam Inland Waterways Administration\nVehicle Operating Cost\nvehicles per day\n\n\fTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nLOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY\n\nMAP\n\nI.

An environmental impact assessment (EIA) was\nundertaken and the Summary EIA was circulated to the Board on\n31 May 1996.\n\nRationale : After decades of conflicts and economic isolation, Viet Nam's\ninfrastructure, particularly its transport infrastructure, is badly\ndeteriorated and is a constraint to general economic recovery and\ninvestment from the emerging private sector. The Government\nhas requested external assistance for rehabilitating the national\nhighway system, over 70 percent of which is in poor condition.\nThe highest priority is given to National Highway No. 1, the most\nimportant north-south link. The Bank, World Bank, and Overseas\nEconomic Cooperation Fund (OECF) have already responded to\nthis request with loans to rehabilitate the highway from Ho Chi\nMinh City to Nha Trang (the Bank) and from Hanoi to Vinh and Ho\nChi Minh City (HCMC) (World Bank). OECF is funding the\nreplacement and construction of major bridges (over 20 meters in\nlength). The proposed Project continues this assistance with\nfunding from the Bank and OECF to improve an additional 161 km\nof National Highway No. 1 from the PRO border south to Hanoi.\nTo improve access and economic linkage to the rural population\ninfluenced by the national highway, the Project includes\nimprovement of over 600 km of rural roads to enhance transport\nreliability on provincial, district and commune roads. This\ncomponent will help raise agricultural productivity and on-farm\nincome and is associated with the development of off-farm\nincome opportunities. In addition, it is a critical determinant to\nincreasing social benefits. The Government accords high priority\nto the Project, which is also in line with the Bank's strategy to\nencourage the increased use of transport linkages, especially in\nupgrading and extending transport corridors, rehabilitating critical\nefficient and sustainable\ninfrastructure, and developing \t\ninstitutions.\n\n\t\n\t\n\fI\n\nObjectives\t\n: The main objectives of the Project are to (i) rehabilitate National\nand Scope Highway No. 1 from Hanoi north to the PRC border to Hanoi to a\nstandard appropriate to the level and type of traffic using the\nroad, (ii) improve rural accessibility and agricultural incomes, (iii)\nreduce transport costs by facilitating more efficient transport\nservices, (iv) improve road safety, and (v) strengthen the\ninstitutions concerned with road management and administration.\n\nCost Estimates : The total Project cost is estimated at $237.0 million equivalent, of\nwhich $150.0 million (63.3 percent) is the foreign exchange cost\nand $87.0 million equivalent (36.7 percent) is the local currency\ncost.\n\nFinancing Plan\t\n\n($ million)\n\nSource\t\n\nForeign\t\nExchange Currency\t\n\nLocal\n\nTotal Percentage\n\nBank\t\nOECF\t\nGovernment\t\n\n97.0\n52.1\n0.9\n\nTotal\t\n\n150.0\n\n23.0\t\n11.9\t\n52.1.\t\n\n87.0\t\n\n120.0\n64.0\n53.0\n\n50.6\n27.0\n22.4\n\n237.0\n\n100.0\n\nLoan Amount\t\n: The equivalent in various currencies of SDR 83,331,000 million\nand Terms ($120.0 million equivalent) from the Bank's Special Funds\nresources, with an amortization of 40 years, including a grace\nperiod of 10 years, and a service charge of 1 percent per annum.\n\nPeriod of Utilization : 31 December 2001\n\nImplementation\t\nMOT's Project Management Unit -1 (PMU-1) will be responsible\nArrangements for Project implementation. Civil works for the national highway\nwill be carried out by contractors and for the rural roads by\ndomestic contractors; their work will be supervised by consultants.\nConsultants will also help carry out the institutional strengthening\ncomponent.\n\nProcurement :  Road civil works for the national highway will be in four contract\npackages and will be carried out by contractors selected following\ninternational competitive bidding procedures in accordance with\nthe Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.  Procurement of rural\nroad civil works contracts will be carried out in accordance with\nprocedures acceptable to the Bank.\n\nConsulting Services : An international consulting firm will be engaged to provide about\n300 person-months of international and 600 person-months of\ndomestic consultants for national highway construction\nsupervision. Consultants will also be retained to rrepare and\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\flit\n\nimplement the rural road component. International and domestic\nconsultants will implement the Institutional Strengthening\ncomponent. All consultants will be selected in accordance with\nthe Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other\narrangements satisfactory to the Bank.\n\nEstimated Project\t\nCompletion Date\n\n: 31 December 2001\n\nProject Benefits\t\nThe main quantifiable benefits from improvement of the national\nand Beneficiaries highway will be savings in vehicle operating and road\nmaintenance costs resulting from an improved road surface and\nalignment and reduced interference from slow traffic. The overall\nestimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for this\ncomponent of the Project is 30.0 percent on the basis of\neconomic costs and benefits estimated over a 20-year period.\nSensitivity analysis shows that the Project will remain viable under\nthe most adverse scenario. The rural road component\nsubprojects will have a minimum EIRR of 12 percent emerging\nmainly from agricultural benefits and reduced transport costs.\nThe benefits will help induce accelerated economic growth, which\nwill contribute to attaining the Government's regional development\nobjectives including increased rural incomes and improved living\nstandards. Reliable rural roads have significant impacts on labor\nmobility and economic status, allowing local residents the\nopportunity to pursue more off-farm employment. Social benefits\nincluding health and education opportunities are also likely to\naccrue in those communities. Other beneficiaries will be road\ntransport operators and road users. The institutional\nstrengthening component will continue assistance to the MOT and\nits Viet Nam Road Administration, and help make them more\nefficient and effective Government agencies.\n\n\flv\n\n105\u00b00bE'\t\n\nI 10\u00b0OE\n\n\tCal Gng\t\n\nnao\t\n\nLChw\t\n\nTuyen\t\n\nLang Son\n\nVIETNAM\nSECOND ROAD\nIMpROVEMFNTPRn.IFrT\n\nT T\n\n- 20\u00b000N\n\n/ J_Jk\t\n\nz Ninn Binh\t\n\ni,u1f of Tonkvi\t\n\n-\n\n_-\n\n20\u00b000'N -\n\nlx\n\nNa Mao\t\n\nNamCau\t\n\nPass\t\n\n/ \nJThanhHoa\t\n\n/\t\n\nSam Son\n\nVinh\n\nPass K Nue\n\n0\t\n\n50\t\n\n100\t\n\n200\n\nKilometers\t\n\nProvinces br Projects\t\nRural Roads Component\t\n\n\u00ae\t\n\nC\t\n\nNational Ca\u00f8ital\t\n\nCitylrown\n\nNational Road\n\nProvincial Road\t\n\nProject Road\n\nRailway\t\n\nAiroort\n\nPort\t\n\n-\t\n\nNavigable Rive\n\nProvincial Boundary\t\n\nInternational Boundary\t\n\n(undaries not necessaril y auThoritative)\t\n\nProvinces under the Project \t\n\n1 Cao Bang\t\nncr\t\n\npass;\u00ec\n\n\\p00g Hoi\n\n\u2022 (TPHue\n\nLaoBaoj .-,\\\t\n\n' '.

A loan 1 for improving the HCMC-Nha Trang Section was\napproved by the Bank in November 1993. A project preparatory technical assistance (TA)2\nwas approved at the same time and provided for a feasibility study of other sections of\nHighway No. 1, including the 161 km section from the PRC border to Hanoi and the 700-km\nsection from Dong Ha to Nha Trang. The study found improvement to both stretches to be\nfeasible on economic grounds. The Government accorded highest priority to the PRO-Hanoi\nsection, which also had the highest economic internal rate of return (EIRR). At the request of\nthe Government, a rural road component was prepared to complement the improvements to\nNational Highway No. 1.\n\n3.\nThe Project was appraised by a Bank Mission that visited Viet Nam from 13 to\n24 May 1996 and a Follow-up Mission which visited Viet Nam from 2 to 5 July 1996. This\nReport is based on the Mission's findings; discussions with Government officials and staff from\nconcerned multilateral and bilateral agencies, including the World Bank and Japan's Overseas\nEconomic Cooperation Fund (OECF); and the findings and recommendations of the feasibility\nstudy.\n\nIll.\t\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.\t\n\nThe Transport Sector\n\nGeneral\n\n4.\nViet Nam extends about 1,600 km from its northern border with the PRO to the\nGulf of Thailand in the south. Its two densely populated river deltas (Red River and Mekong),\nwhich are about 1,000 km apart, are linked by a narrow (40 to 60 km wide) land strip. The\ncountry has about 331,000 km 2 of land area and a total population of about 73.7 million.\nUrbanization is starting to grow rapidly, but about 80 percent of the population still live in rural\nareas. Although economic diversification is taking place, agriculture, forestry, and fishery still\naccount for more than a third of gross domestic product (GDP) and for more than 70 percent of\n\nLoan No. 1272-VIE: Road Improvement Project, for $120 milhon, approved on 23 November 1993.\nTA. No. 1997-VIE: Second Road improvement,  for $2.1 million, approved on 23 November 1993.\nThe Mission comprised the following: T. Jones, Sr. Project Economist (Mission Leader): J. Cooney. Sr\nProject Engineer, IWTC: CE Dark, Economist, PW3, S. Lateef, Social Development Specialist. SOCD,\nand K. Wentz, Counsel, OGC\nThe Mission comprised G HecKer, Mission Leader, and Mr. T Jones, Sr. Project Economist.\n\n\f61\t\n\nAppendix 17, page 2\n\ninefficient vehicle operating characteristics. Average annual daily traffic in 1994 amounted to\n1,570 four-wheeled vehicles per day (vpd).\n\n5.\nN2 through Ha Bac Province to the junction with National Highway No.5 in Hanoi is\n67 km long, is also narrow (7 to 8 m) and, except near Hanoi where it becomes four lane, has\nvarious asphalt paved surfaces that are not in good condition and are often flooded in the wet\nseason. Roughness, while lower than the Ni section, is still high at 6.2 m per km. The horizontal\nand vertical curvatures are generally acceptable as the road mostly passes through areas\nadjacent to paddy fields. Traffic is very high, with about 4,200 four-wheeled vpd.\n\n6.\nHistoric traffic counts in Viet Nam are very limited in scope and application. The\nfeasibility study team undertook extensive traffic counts and origin-destination surveys to\ndetermine the number and type of vehicles using the Project road as well as their purpose and\norigin-destination characteristics. These data were compared with the available traffic counts and\nan analysis of the relationship between gross domestic product (GDP) growth and road traffic\ngrowth was undertaken both for data available in Viet Nam and in comparison with other\ncountries in the region when they were at a similar stage of development and their present level\nof motorization. Based on an expected average growth in GDP of 8.8 percent per year and\nelasticities of 1.53 for passengers and 1.42 for freight, annual growth rates for passenger traffic\nare estimated to be 13.5 percent and for freight, 12.5 percent until 2001. After that, growth rates\nare estimated to decline to 12.0 percent and 10.0 percent, respectively. In view of experience in\nother countries and because Viet Nam is in the early stage of modern economic development,\nthese rates are considered reasonable. A summary of the road condition and traffic is given in\nTable 1.\n\nTable 1: Road Condition and Traffic\n\nCurrent\nRoughness\t\nLevel (mlkm) I Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT)\n\nTraffic Volume 1994\n\nRoad Section\n\nAverage\n\nTwo-wheeled\t\n\nCars\t\n\nBuses\t\n\nTrucks\n\nTota l a j\t\n\npb\n\nGrowth Rate\n\n794\t\n\n653\n\n222\n\n1,4741 13.5\t\n\n12.5\n\n3.538\t\n\n2.296\n\n360i\t\n\n1,531\n\n4,1871 13.5\t\n\n12.5\n\nPRO border\nto Ha Bac\nProvincial\nBoundary\n\nNi\n\nN2\n\nHa Bac\nProvincial\nBoundary to\nJunction\nHighway No. 5\n\n9.5\n\n6.2\n\nb\t\n\nC\t\n\nExcluding two-wheeled vehicles.\nPassenger traffic to 2001 with a subsequent decline to 12.0 percent per annum thereafter\nFreight traffic to 2001 with a subsequent decline to 10 percent per annum thereafter.\n\nSource: Feasibility Study\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\f62\t\n\nAppendix 17, page 3\n\nC.\t\n\nCosts\n\n1.\t\n\nVehicle Operating Costs\n\n7. VOC savings and maintenance cost savings were the only benefits quantified in\nthe economic evaluation. VOC were calculated without and with the road improvements for both\nthe base case and the recommended alternative for vehicles typical of the traffic on the Project\nroad. VOCs for six typical vehicle types were estimated using the highway design and\nmaintenance-VOC model, which takes into account Project-induced changes in surface\nconditions, gradients, and vehicle speeds as well as a number of other factors such as the VOC\ncomponents (vehicle, fuel, oiL tires, crew, maintenance. interest, overhead, and insurance costs).\nThe resulting unit VOCs for the representative vehicles for the preferred alternative and the base\ncase are given in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Unit VOC for Representative Vehicles\n($/vehicle/km)\n\nVehicle Type\n\nRoad Section IBase\t\n_______________ -\t\n\nret\t\n\nre\t\n\n1\t\n\ncar\t\n\n'Jthity Vehicle\t\nBas\t\n\nBus\t\n\nBasc Pref\t\n\nj Medium Truck Heavy Truck Very Heav y T\nBase Pref\nBase Pref\t\n\nBase Pref\t\n\n1\n\nN\t\nN2\t\n\n0.15\t\n0.13\t\n\n1t\t\n1.2\t\n\n0.36 0.16\t\n\nC.26 0.16\t\n\n0.36 0.30\t\n3,32 0.30\t\n\n0.21\t\n0.18\t\n\n016\t\n0.15\t\n\n0.35\t\n0.28\t\n\n0.25 ' 0.55\t\n0.42\t\n0.23\t\n\n0.38\n0.3\n\nSource:\t\n\nFeasibility Study\n\n2.\t\n\nConstruction and Maintenance Costs\n\n8.

Maintenance costs with the improvements are\nexpected to be substantially reduced and average $1500  p er km for routine maintenance.\n$9,500 per km for a single bituminous surface treatment in the fifth and fifteenth year after\noDening. and $18,000 per m for ar asphaltic concrete ovenay n tne tenrn vea afte r cpening,\n\nD.\t\n\nBenefits and Beneficiaries\n\n9. The main quantifiable benefits of the Project include VOC savings and\nmaintenance cost savings. Operating costs for trucks are estimated to decline by 16-31 percent.\nTypical travel time for trucks will be reduced from about 3.5 hours to 2.25 hours, or 35 percent.\nThe travel time savings to trucks alone in the opening year would be about 720.000 hours and is\nreflected in the estimated VOCs. The importance of the Proiect road tc Viet Narn suggests that\nthere will be substantial nonquantifiable benefits, such as quicker, less costly market access for\nfarmers and tradesmen, increased access for sociai communicatione. decreased waiting and\ntravel times for passengers, decreased time for the movement oi trade coods witn higher\nreliability and in oenera better transoort services fo the n're ro ' '2 \t\n2 0 millic rs oeoole livinc 'n ne twn nrnv'ce travee \t\ni-ianc (about 2 million at ts soutnern tetm:nus.

The area traversed by the NI\nis a rice deficit area while that area served by N2 is a rice surplus area. The movement of rice\nwill be facilitated by the improvement of the Project road. The reduced VOC resulting from the\nimproved Project road will benefit road users, particularly road transport operators. Since\ntransport charges mainly depend on road conditions, it is expected that a portion of the VOC\nsavings will be passed on to road transport users. Through this and improved efficiency, the road\nimprovements will help enable small-scale producers to participate more actively in the market\neconomy. Finally, cross-border trade with the PRC has been increasing recently. The road\nimprovement will encourage this trend through faster, safer, and more reliable transport between\nproduction and consumption centers.\n\nE.\t\n\nEconomic Evaluation\n\n10. The EIRRs have been calculated using the standard process of iterative\ndiscounting until the cost/benefit ratio is equal to one. VOCs were calculated using the HDM-\nVOC model, while the other costs and benefits were introduced exogenously. For the evaluation,\nit was necessary to compare the base-case improvement without any realignment and the\npreferred alternative, which includes a number of realignments to avoid resettlement or to\nsignificantly improve the Project road's substandard geometncs. The base EIRR for the Project\noverafi is 30.0 percent, with the EIRRs for the individual sections about the same with 30.9\npercent for Ni and 29.3 percent for N2. The alternatives with significant realignments were\nclearly preferred over the base-case improvements. The EIRRs for the base case with\nimprovements were 22 percent for Ni and 13 percent for N2. The cost of the preferred\nalternative was also significantly less than the base case with improvements. NI with the\npreferred alternative was estimated to cost $92,000 less per km than the improved base-case,\nwhile N2 was $1.55 million less per km, including construction and resettlement costs. FOr both\nstretches, the cost of improvement of the existing alignment was high mainly because of the very\nhigh costs associated with resettlement.

The Bank's Country Operational Strategy Study for Viet Nam has two primary\nobjectives: (I) the need to enhance and sustain rapid broad-based economic growth; and (ii)\nhuman development. To facilitate these thrusts, the strategy encourages the increased use of\nlinkages, particularly transport,with a strong geographic dimension. This translates into the\nupgrading and extension of transport corridors and the use of feeder roads into rural areas to\nfoster economic opportunities and reduce poverty in underserved areas.\n\n2. The Government of Viet Nam, in its commitment to reduce poverty, is\nformulating an integrated National Program for Hunger Eradication and Poverty Reduction and\nis creating an enabling environment for poverty elimination. The initiative includes, among\nothers, a rural infrastructure component which focuses on the upgrading and extension of rural\nroads. Government has stated that rapid broad-based economic development in combination\nwith targeted infrastructure and social service provision are the best approaches for reducing\npoverty.\n\nB.\t\n\nImportance of Rural infrastructure\n\n3.\nThe Bank and the Government, acknowledge the important contribution of rural\ninfrastructure in reducing poverty. Rural infrastructure, particularly rural roads, is a critical\ndeterminant of agricultural productivity and is also associated with the development of off-farm\nincome opportunities and greater participation in the market economy. In Viet Nam. evidence\nsuggests that people who live near existing infrastructure or have reasonable access to it.\nhave higher living standards and have been able to take better advantage of the market\nreforms than those who do not (about $127 annually compared to $101 - Viet Nam Living\nStanaards Survey (VLSS), 1993). Furthermore, people living in communities located near\nreliable roads have significantly higher average per capita expenditures.\n\nIn fact, the presence and condition of rural roads and village electrification were\n4.\nalso shown to have significant impacts on paddy production (as well as on-farm and off-farm\nlabor supply). The VLSS revealed that if a community is more than 3 kilometer (km) from a\nroad, paddy productivity begins to decrease, at the substantial rate of 402 kilogram per hectare\n(kg/ha) for every additional km away from the road. Moreover, road conditions matter.\nEstimates show that yields decrease 26 kg/ha for every additional month that the road is\nimpassable. Communities with road access are also more likely to have a permanent market\nlocated in their village: to engage in more than one economic activity; to leave the village to\nseek work; to sell agricultural surplus; and to be better served by public and/or private\ntransport.\n\nThe existence of reliable rural roads appears to affect labor mobility, which in\n5.\nturn is significantly related to economic status. On average, households in communities with\nlabor mobility (e.g. which report having residents that sometimes leave the village to seek work\nelsewhere) have per capita expenditures of D1.2 million compared to D1.0 million for\ncommunities without labor mobility (World Bank, Poverty Assessment and Strategy, 1995).\n\n\f66\t\n\nAppendix 18, page 2\n\nPeople in communities characterized by labor mobility engage in more economic activities, and\nare more likely to have ready access to a reliable road.\n\n6.\nIn the absence of a good transport network, agricultural development is\nhindered in several ways: prices for inputs (fertilizer, seeds, etc.) are higher and output lower;\nmarketing of high value perishable products is impossible; farmgate prices are lower; and\naccess to new technology and information is limited. In Viet Nam, the presence of reliable\nrural roads appears to indicate improved flow of goods. services and information. This leads to\ngreater economic diversification, labor mobility, more productive use of farm land, all of which\ncontribute to improvements in living standards.\n\nSocial benefits, which are more difficult to quantify. are also likely to accrue to\n7.\nthose communities which have access to reliable roads. Educational attendance by primary\nand secondary students is likely to be enhanced by roads which are passable all year round.\nBetter educational attainment through to secondary and post-secondary education has shown\nto significantly contribute to off-farm earnings and opportunities. Teacher absenteeism is also\nlikely to decline given proper access to and from schools. Combined, these factors have\nimportant implications for economic and social development. Long term health benefits are\nalso likely to accrue. Better reiiabiiitv of existing rural roads will assist in realizing immunization\nand vitamin cam paigns. and enhancing mother-child health programs. Easier access to health\nfacilities will also serve the Government's primary and preventive health care programs,\nparticularly contagious disease control through regular and ali-weather access to communes\nand villages. In addition, a healthier rural population is an important factor in lessening the\nnumber of farming days lost due to ill-health and the consequent negative im pacts on potentia\nincome.\n\nC.\t\n\nPoverty Situation in Project Areas\n\nPoverty is widespreac in Viet Nam According to a recent study (World Bank\n8.\nPoverty Assessment Strategy, 1995). over 51  percent of the oopuiation is classified as living in\npoverty, and over 90 percent of the rural po pulation is classified as on or below the poverty\nline. Incomes are lower in the Central Highlands Region (50 percent o the national average),\nNorthern U plands Region (5 oercent where the Proiect is located, and the North Oentra\nRegion (71 percentI. However, levels of poverty are not uniform throughout each region and\nselected pockets of poverty exist in all regions. Within each of the targeted provinces (Ha Bac,\nLang Son and Cao Bang) a great deal of variation in living standards exists. The presence of\nethnic minority groups, or the p h ysical access of villages tc rural roads and waterwa y s. may\nmean marked differences within a province or district.\n\n9.\nMany rural households, often the poorest and also often belonging to minority\nethnic groups, live in remote mountainous areas where infrastructure provision is extremely\nlimited. Overall, access to infrastructure in rural areas is generally deficient, with less than one\nthird of the population having access to a combination of a passable road, public transport and\na permanent market. Only 27 percent of the rural poor have access to this combination of\ninfrastructure compared with 40 percent of the non-poor. in Cao Bang Province, for example,\nonly 63 percent of communes are served by a rural road, while less than 50 percent have a\npermanent market. In Lang son Province, only 17 percent of communes have a permanent\nmarket. In Ha Bac orovince. 53 percent of communes have such a riare\n\n\f67\t\n\nAppendix 18, page 3\n\n10.\nAccording to the VLSS, monthly per capita income for rural areas in the\nNorthern Uplands region is only D75,370 compared to the national rural average of D94,440.\nFor the rural poor in this region, the figure is even lower - D24,230 compared to the national\nrural average monthly income of D25,520. The Project area reveals an increasing disparity\neven within provinces. Average monthly income per capita in Cao Bang, Lang Son and Ha\nBac is D92,370, D97,930, and D134,950, respectively.\n\n11.\nIn Viet Nam, the prevalence of poverty amongst ethnic minority groups is much\nhigher than the national average. Poverty amongst these groups tends to be severe: almost\n66 percent of the Tay, 67 percent of the Thai, 70 percent of the Nung, and 89 percent of the\nDao, live in poverty. In Lang Son and Cao Bang, ethnic minority groups comprise at least 70\npercent of the population. Potential exists for enhanced economic opportunities for some of\nthe ethnic minority communities through improved access to a reliable all-weather rural road.\n\n12.\nHowever, two distinct groups of the poor need to be recognized. The first\ngroup, comprising the majority of the poor, are poor now but face better prospects in the\nfuture. As villages and communes in the Project area are provided with improved roads,\naccess to wider markets and increased credit facilities will develop. Members of this group\ncould progress to growing commercial crops or to taking up nonfarm work, thereby improving\ntheir living standards. This group will benefit significantly from the provision of rural\ninfrastructure, economic growth, and market liberalization.\n\n13.\nThe second group, ethnic minority communities living in remote and\nmountainous areas, which are more disconnected from economic and social infrastructure, are\nless likely to participate in a growing market economy without substantial and sustained\ngovernment assistance. Potentially, they could become exceedingly marginalized and\nvulnerable. Improving the quality of life for these more disadvantaged groups will require\ntargeted poverty reduction programs and social services alongside improved access to roads\nand other physical infrastructure.\n\n14.\nIdentifying, formulating, and implementing comprehensive policies and\nprograms on poverty reduction and rural development wilt assist in uplifting those groups that\nhave access to economic and social opportunities. Through these programs, national poverty\nlevels should be reduced, and additional resources should become available to target areas\nand regions not substantially impacted by market reforms.\n\nD.\t\n\nGovernment Polices and Programs\n\n15.\nThe Government's industrialization and modernization program for the\nremainder of the century contains a number of strategic aims. They include the development\nof agriculture, forestry in combination with agro-industries, and the rehabilitation and expansion\nof infrastructure. A large proportion of the Government's targeted investment capital during\n1996-2000 will be put in three focal geographic areas (the north, center, and south) in order to\ncreate growth regions to stimulate overall economic activity in the entire country. In particular,\nspecial attention will be given to socioeconomic development in mountain areas that are within\nthe Project influence area.\n\nTo achieve these aims, the Government intends to launch a number of\n16.\nimportant socioeconomic programs including agricultural and rural economic development,\n\n\f68\t\n\nAppendix 18, page 4\n\nindustrial development, infrastructure development, regional development, socioeconomic\ndevelopment for mountainous areas, and a national program for poverty alleviation.\n\n17.\nAgriculture will continue to play a strategic role in Viet Nam's development.\nFrom now up to the year 2000, food crops wifl provide most of Viet Nam's agricultural output.\nThis is expected to continue for a number of reasons: the Government's strategy in promoting\nincreased food production; increases in food prices are expected, providing farmers with\nincentives for commercial food production; and investment promotion for agriculture, especially\ninvestment in irrigation and rural roads, will open further opportunities for expanding markets\nand increasing crop yields.\n\n18.\nThus, Government policy has an important role to play in promoting rural\ndevelopment and reducing poverty. Increased public investment and maintenance of rural\ninfrastructure\u2014including rural roads\u2014and agricultural research and extension services will need\nto be formulated to assist in raising rural incomes in areas that have economic potential. In\naddition, rural development will also depend on enabling improvements in the functioning of\ncredit and land markets. The Government has recognized these linkages and is formulating\nnational programs for rural development that aim to take a coordinated and intersectoral\napproach to rurai develo pment (e.g., agricultural productivity, linkage with rural infrastructure,\nenvironmental protection, credit availability, social service provision, etc.). Completion of the\nstrategy is expected by late 1996.\n\n\f56\t\n\nAppendix 16, page 6\n\nc.\t\n\nStructures - Legality\n\n13. Legal structures that belong to the PAP include the structures within the right-of-\nway and built before 1982 or, if built after 1982 has permission from the responsible authority.\nIllegal structures that belongs to the PAP are within the right-of-way and were built after 1982\nwithout any eligible permission.\n\nd.\t\n\nLand\u2014Legality\n\n14.\t\nland belongs to a PAP, but the owner has inadequate legal documentation.\n\nLegal land belongs to a PAP, and the owner has a legal title to the land. Illegal\n\ne.\t\n\nEncroachment\n\n15.\t\n\nLand that a PAP occupies but does not own.\n\n2.\t\n\nCompensation and Assistance Policies\n\na.\t\n\nStructures\n\n16. For legal structures, compensation will be 100 percent of new construction cost.\nFor illegal structures, assistance equivalent to 60 percent of new construction cost will be\nprovided. Unit prices for new construction will be as established periodically by relevant provincial\npeople's committees (PPCs) based on materials and labor costs. These are updated\napproximately every three months. Compensation and assistance will be provided in the form of\ncash or kind or both.\n\nb.\t\n\nLand\n\n17. Compensation will be paid for land that is taken permanently for road construction;\nis in the clear area (see para. 12) and is covered by structures as part of the road construction (in\nurban areas only); and is taken for resettlement site development (including access roads).\nCompensation will be made in accordance with the following methods: (i) legal PAPs whose land\nwill be acquired are compensated land for land with the same value and usage purpose or\ncompensated in cash and land, at the PAPs' option; and (ii) PAPs whose loss of land is small can\nbe compensated wholly in cash.\n\n16. PAPs with legal residential land, if the land remaining after the land required for the\nroad and clear area is less than 40 square meters (m 2) in urban areas and 60 m 2 (in rural areas),\ncan opt to stay or move to a resettlement site. The criteria for relocation in a resettlement site are\nas follows:\n\n(I) The PAP's land value is first calculated in accordance with the prices set in Decree\n87/CP to convert the acquired land to the replacement land. After the conversion, if\nthe acquired land is smaller than 60 m 2 , its owner is entitled to a 60 m 2 plot in the\nresettlement area;\n\n(ii) If the lost land is larger than 60 m 2 , its owner is entitled to a plot in the resettlement\narea equivalent to the lost area, provided that it is no larger than 120 m 2 . The\ndifference, if any, will be compensated as cash.\n\n\f57\t\n\nAppendix 16, page 7\n\n(iii) PAPs who would lose only their shops (without residence) will be provided a plot\nequivalent to the affected area, with a minimum area of 14 m 2 , in a resettlement\nsite or a business center.\n\n19. For PAP's with illegal residential land but who, based on existing regulations, are\neligible for a legal land use right title, land-use will be legalized and the PAPs will be\ncompensated in the same manner as for legal PAPs.\n\nc.\t\n\nEncroachers\n\n20. Encroachers, presently estimated to make up about 0.4 percent of PAPs\n(equivalent to 4 households), in principle will not be compensated for land, but will be provided\nwith assistance equivalent to 60 percent of new construction cost and with relocation of\nstructures. Consideration will be focused on the poorest groups of encroachers to give them a\nplot of 60 m 2 in a resettlement area if it is confirmed by the local authority that they have\ninadequate or no land for a residence.\n\n3.\t\n\nCompensation Rates for Land (including  land taken for reseftlement sites)\n\n21. Compensation for land will be based on the prices established for each class,\ncategory, and location of land, as issued by relevant PPCs pursuant to Decree 87/C P. Present\nvalues are set out in the Project's Resettlement Action Plan. The category of land defined for\ncompensation will be the one defined when the land was originally allocated to the owner. The\nvalue of land for the purpose of compensation will be the current value of similar land.\n\n4.\t\n\nCompensation for Structures and Other Physical Assets\n\n22. Compensation for structures and physical assets will be decided on the basis of\nDecree 90/OP, subject to the amounts to be paid to PAPs for these items will not be less than the\nnew replacement cost at the time individual compensation entitlements are calculated.\n\n5.\t\n\nCompensation for Trees, Crops and Graves\n\n23. Compensation will follow clauses 12 and 13 of Chapter III of Decree 90/OP. Details\nof amounts to be paid will be provided by the PPCs. The compensation rates for crops will reflect\ncurrent values for the crops, with appropriate provision for lost future crop income from the PAP's\nland.\n\n6.\t\n\nOther Assistance\n\n24. PAPs who are to resettle will be entitled to a relocation and subsistence allowance,\nwith a minimum value of D500,000 (about $50). PAPs whose structures are partially dismantled\nwill be entitled to half this amount. Each household will be entitled to send a member to a training\ncourse for simple skills, of duration 3-6 months, with the costs to be covered by the Project. Social\nassistance will be made available for the poorest and minority groups. Farmer PAPs who will lose\nmore than 20 percent of their total income will be entitled to training in a suitable career in\naddition to compensation for land and crops.\n\n\f58\t\n\nAppendix 16, page 8\n\nF.\t\n\nBudget Issues\n\n25. The cost of land acquisition and resettlement is presently estimated to be about\n$15.5 million. This consists of about $11.0 million for land, $1.5 million for dwelling unit\ncompensation, $1.6 million for other compensation, and about $1.4 million for administration and\ncontingencies. The total amount, although included in the Project cost, is to be financed entirely\nby the Government from its own resources, and will be required, in approximately equal parts, in\nthe 1997 and 1998 fiscal years.\n\nG.\t\n\nOrganizational Responsibility\n\n26. The Ministry of Transport (MOT) is the Executing Agency for the Project, acting\nthrough Project Management Unit No. 1 (PMU-1). PMU-1 will be responsible for the land\nacquisition and resettlement programs, for which it has established within its organization a\nresettlement department. This department has undertaken similar tasks for earlier projects\nfinanced by the Bank and the World Bank financed projects. PMU-1 will liaise closely with the\nprovincial, district, and commune people's committees in the affected area, who have established\nresettlement committees and wifl be closely involved with the programs. Training or\ncompensation standards, procedures, entitlements, implementation, grievance, and monitorino\nprocedures for the provincial resettlement committees (PRCs), district resettlement committees\n(DRCs), and commune resettlement committees (CRCs) will be conducted by PMU-1. A Public\nInformation campaign will be conducted and an information booklet will be prepared and\ndistributed by PM U-I.\n\nH.\t\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n27. A detailed implementation schedule for the land acquisition and resettlement\nprograms was agreed between the Government and the Bank during appraisal. Resettlement and\nland compensation schedules will be completed before construction activities begin in an area.\nPAPs will be informed at least three months prior to the intended displacement of the various\noptions available, the compensation rates, and the implementation schedule and procedures to\nenable PAPs to make informed choices regarding the available options and to prepare for\nrelocation, identification of replacement lands, and alternative livelihoods. PAPs will be given at\nleast two months final notice prior to demolition or land acquisition, and all compensation\npayments will be paid and resettlement sites identified at least one month prior to the actual\ndislocation. In essence, the schedule requires that the actual programs be completed in two\nyears, commencing in January 1997. Preliminary activities, including detailed surveys, final\nvaluations, preparation and submission of budget re q uirements, and establishment of monitoring\nprocedures, will be completed by 31 December 1996.\n\nI.\t\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\n28. PMU-1. will engage a suitable domestic agency acceptable to the Bank, under\nterms of reference acceptable to the Bank, to monitor the land acquisition and resettlement\nprograms. The agency will provide PMU-1 will status reports each quarter from January 1997 to\nDecember 1998, or until the programs have been completed. PMU-1 will provide the Bank with\ncopies of these reports. In addition, PMU-1 will ensure that the Project's consultants include in\ntheir progress reports the status of the resettlement action plan (RAP, to include information on\nlocation and numbers of people relocated, compensation amounts paid b y item, and assistance\nprovided to PAPs. Once the land acquisition and resettlement  p rograms have been completed.\n\n\f59\t\n\nAppendix 16, page 9\n\nPMU-1 will provide the Bank with a final report, to be followed two years later by a follow-up\nevaluation of the resettlement program, setting out the extent to which the program has achieved\nits primary objective, that the well-being of the people affected by the Project should be no worse\nthan it would have been had the Project not been implemented. The evaluation, to include\ncomprehensive socioeconomic analysis techniques, will include recommendations for mitigation\nmeasures required to remedy shortcomings that have become evident.\n\nJ.\t\n\nGrievance Procedures\n\n29. To ensure that affected people have avenues for redressing their grievances related to\nany aspect Of land acquisition and resettlement, detailed procedures for redressing grievances have\nbeen established for the Project.\n\n30. Any person who is aggrieved by any aspect of the resettlement program, he or she\ncan lodge a written or oral grievance with the commune peoples committee or commune\nresethement committee. If a person is not satisfied with the decision, he or she has a right to\nappeal to the relevant district resettlement committee, the District Inspectorate. If a satisfactory\nresolution is not reached, the person can appeal to the provincial level. If an oral complaint is\nmade, it will be recorded by the committee to which it is made and processed. Grievances\nregistered with commune and district resettlement committees will be conveyed by them to the\nprovince resettlement committees. The PPC must resolve the issue within 21 days. Detailed\nimplementation of the process will be in line with Decree 38 and its attached guidelines.\n\na.\t\n\nStage I\n\nb.\t\n\nStage 2\n\n31. lIthe person making the complaint is not satisfied with the decision or receives no\nresponse within 21 days of registering the grievance, he or she can appeal to the local office of PMU-1\nfor redressing the grievance. The appeal should be lodged within three months of registering the\noriginal complaint. PMU-1 will provide the affected person with a decision within one month of\nregistering the appeal.\n\nc.\t\n\nContents of grievances\n\n32. The grievances lodged by an affected person can relate to any aspect of the land\nacquisition and resettlement programs including the compensation offered. The detailed\nprocedures for redressing grievances and the appeal process will be publicized widely in the area\naffected by the Project through a resettlement information booklet to be distributed to all affected\npersons.\n\n\f60\t\n\nAppendix 17, page 1\n\nECONOMIC EVALUATION\n\nA.\t\n\nBase Case and Options\n\n1.\nThe northern terminus of the Project section of National Highway No. I starts at the\nPeople's Republic of China (PRC) border crossing point near Lang Son. Moving southward the\nroad passes through Lang Son Province and crosses into Ha Bac Province at kilometer (km) 102,\ninto Hanoi Province at km 161, and is joined National Highway No. 5 at km 168, which is the\nsouthern terminus. The northern section from the PRC border to the Border with Ha Bac\nProvince (Ni) (102 km) is lightly populated mainly because of the rolling, hilly, and rugged\nnature of the land and it's limited usefulness because of deforestation. The road is in very poor\ncondition and the vertical and horizontal curvatures are often substandard for modem traffic. The\nbase case for this section was to improve the road along the existing right-of-way, which would\nresult not only in high construction costs but other costs associated with land acquisition and\nresettlement. During the feasibility study, various options were investigated and resulted in\nfollowing the existing alignment with bypasses or new and better alignments (for example, a\nbypass of the Sai Ho Pass following an existing but abandoned railway alignment) and bypasses\nof towns where the alignments were often poor and large-scale resettlement would be required.\n\n2.\nThe southern section from the northern border of Ha Bac Province to the junction\nwith National Highway No. 5 (N2), with a length of about 66 km, passes through intensively\ncultivated farm land with high density mainly strip development along the right-of-way. The\nalternative to widening and improving the existing road was to bypass the smaller towns near the\nnorthern terminus and then to move to a completely new alignment of about 51 km, bypassing the\nbuilt-up areas through to the junction with National Highwa y Nc.5 at Hanoi. The new alignment o\nN2 will initially be constructed to a two-iane standard but is designed for expansion to six lanes  K\naccommodate increasing traffic volumes. For NI and N2. the alternative was selected or\neconomic, engineering, and sociai impact grounas. In both cases the existing highway wili\ncontinue in service and will accommodate short local tri ps by motor vehicles as well as the high\nvolume of local slower moving traffic such as motorbikes. bicycles, iivestock, and pedestrians.\n\nB.\t\n\nMethodology\n\n3. The economic evaluation was carried out for the two homogeneous road sections\n(Ni and N2) and for the Project as a whole. Vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings and\nmaintenance cost savings were the only benefits quantified in the economic evaluation. Project\ncosts included construction, supervision, right-of-way and resettlement, maintenance, and\nphysical contingencies. Economic costs were used throughout mainly by adjusting the estimated\nfinancial costs by 5 percent to account for taxes and duties and a small adjustment for the\nshadow wage rate of local labor. For the derivation of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR),\nthe cost and benefit streams were estimated over a 24-year period starting in 1997 from the\nbeginning of construction until the year 2020, which covers the economic life of the road\nimprovements, including periodic resurfacing of the pavements. Appropriate sensitivity tests were\nthen carried out along with the Sensitivity Indicators.\n\nC.\t\n\nRoad Condition and Traffic\n\n4.\t\nNi from the northern terminus at the PRO border to the southern border of Lang\nSon Province is 100.8 km long, is narrow (7 to 8 meters [ml) and has various asphalt paved\nsurfaces that are not in good condition. Roughness averages about 8 to 12 m per km, which\nvery high and results in high VOC.

Initial surveys indicated that about 20,000 residents, in about 5,000 households,\nwould have to move. In the northern section, the requirement for resettlement was less\nsubstantial, but the existing road traversed a mountain pass, with very poor horizontal and vertical\nalignments. From traffic safety and economic considerations, it was considered desirable to\nimprove the alignment over this length wherever possible.\n\nTo reduce the resettlement and alignment problems to acceptable proportions,\n2.\nextensive lengths of the existing highway would be by-passed by new alignments. As finally\ndesigned, the Project road will consist of about 110 km of new alignment (60 km in the south, the\nfirst two-lane stage of an ultimate six-lane divided dual-carriageway highway, and about 50 km in\nthe north). The remaining 58 km will remain predominately on the existing alignment.\n\n3. Although the proposed alignment was selected\nenvironmental impacts 1 and does reduce the resettlement problem,\ninvoluntarily resettle about 3,400 residents in about 960 households.\nwill have to be acquired, most rural but some urban. As part of\ndetailed social impact survey was carried out, on the basis c\nresettlement and rehabilitation plan has been prepared.\n\nto minimize social and\nit will still be necessary to\nAbout 450 hectares of land\nhe Project's preparation. a\nf which a comprehensive\n\nB.\t\n\nPrinciples of Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n\nThe principles of land acquisition and resettlement for the Project are derived from\n4.\ntwo sources. First, the Bank has formally set out its requirements in its  Policy Paper on\nInvoluntary Resettlement, Second, the Government has promulgated a number of decrees and\nregulations that define its approach to land acquisition and resettlement resulting from\ndevelopment projects. The basic approach adopted by the Government is in accord with the that\nof the Bank, and essentially with that of the World Bank, which has invested considerable effort\nin encouraging and assisting the Government to adopt principles and procedures that comply with\ninternational practice.\n\nThe common objective of these policies is to ensure that people displaced by the\n5.\nProject (Project affected persons - PAPs) should generally be at least as well off, if not better off,\nthan they would have been without the Project. The land acquisition and resettlement plans have\nbeen prepared with this as a guiding principle. The parameters addressed, and the manner in\nwhich they have been addressed, are summarized in Table 1.\n\nSee the Pro j ect's Environmental Impact Assessment report for details of the approach adopted for corridor\nana alianment selection and for identif y ing and mittoating socra and environmental impacts\n\n\t\n\f52\n\nAppendix 16, page 2\n\nTable 1: Resettlement Parameters and Approach\n\nParameter\t\n\nApproach Applied\n\n1. Involuntary resettlement should be minimized \t\n\n2. Plans should be prepared for those displaced\n\n3. There is to be community participation\n\nNew alignments have been selected where high\npopulation densities would have necessitated\nsubstantial resettlement.\n\nSocioeconomic surveys have been completed; PAPs\nhave been identified; and their land, buildings, and\nother assets enumerated.\n\nDuring the surveys, meetings were held at the\nprovince, district, town, and commune levels, with\nofficials and with residents. Further community\nparticipation and consultation will be conducted\nthrough the provincial, district, and commune\nresettlement committees (PRCs, DRCs and CRCs)\nfollowing the completion of the detailed measurement\nsurvey (DMS) and the ethnic minorities action plan and\nprior to implementation of the resettlement action plan\n(RAP). These consultations will be supplemented by a\npublic information campaign conducted by the Project\nmanagement unit. A Resettlement Information Booklet\nwill also be prepared and distributed by the PMU for all\nstockholders (affected people, PRCs, DMCs, CRCs)\nthat includes the basic features of the RAP\n(compensation/resettlement principles, procedures,\nand entitlements of the PAPs)\n\nCompensation will be provided for land, structures,\ncrops, etc, in accordance with existing procedures. The\nRAP includes provisions for relocation allowances,\nassistance with dismantling, transporting and\nreconstructing structures, alternative employment\ntraining, and 6 months rental subsidies for PAPs who\nare tenants.\n\nResettlement areas to be developed, with land,\nutilities, and access.\n\nGovernment will engage a domestic agency\nacceptable to the Bank, under terms of reference also\nacceptable to the Bank, to monitor the land acquisition\nand resettlement program. and to report on it to the\nGovernment and the Bank.\n\nThe corridor and alignment selection process have\nincluded environment and resettlement aspects as\nmajor factors; the initial road alignment has been\naltered to minimize impacts on people (land\nacquisition and resettlement) and Project schedules\nincluding the loan processing schedule, and to take\ninto account land acquisition and resettlement\nschedules.\n\n4. PAPs to receive fair compensation for all losses, \t\n\ninciuding assets and livelihoods \t\n\n5.

The 1993 Land Law is a comprehensive land administration law, superseding the\nearlier 1987 version. The new law is arguably one of the most important and fundamental laws to\nhave been promulgated since the country's independence, and has had a profound effect on the\neconomy and on people's lives. In almost all respects, the Land Law gave the people access to\nland through land user rights which are similar to private ownership. The law, which went into\neffect on 15 October 1993, covers a wide range of issues. A comprehensive summary is included\nin the Project's resettlement action plan. Some of the more important issues that are relevant to\nland usage, acquisition, and resettlement, are summarized below, with some explanatory notes.\nThese issues have also been chosen to illustrate the often substantial differences in the concepts\nof land ownership and usage between socialist and more market-oriented economies.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n(vii)\n\nLand belongs to the people, with the State as its sole administrator. No private\norganization or individual has the right to own land.\n\nThe State reserves the right to allocate land and determine its usage.\n\nFamilies and individuals who have been allocated land have the right to exchange\ntheir land for another piece; transfer their right to use the land to another party; and\nrent bequeath or use their right to the land as collateral. These privileges are the\nmost significant aspect of the Land Law, in effect transferring management of the\nland back to individuals. There are, however, some important management\ndecisions the State still reserves for itself.\n\nThe Peoples' Councils at all levels (province, district, and commune) are\nresponsible for the administration of land use in their localities; the Peoples'\nCommittees at all levels are responsible for managing land issues in their domains.\n\nBased on its usage, land is classified as agricultural, forestry, rural residential,\nurban, specialized, or unused. The issue of land usage remains one of the last\nimportant management decisions that has not been turned over to private\nindividuals. Reflecting what is primarily a fear that scarce agricultural land will be\ntransferred for industrial or residential use, the Government retains exclusive\nauthority over the determination of land usage. This issue is becoming increasingly\nmore controversial, as recently promulgated rules and regulations suggest.\n\nThe State reserves the right to determine the value of all kinds of land for the\npurpose of taxation, collection of fees, allocation and compensation. These values\nwill be determined by region and time period.\n\nThe State reserves the right to appropriate land when truly necessary, in cases of\nnational defense or security, or national and public interest. In these cases, the\nland user will be compensated for loss of possessions. \"National and public\ninterest\" is defined in Decree No 90-OP as including all transportation and\ninfrastructure projects (this provides the basis for the right-of-way acquisition\ncrucial to the implementation of the Project).\n\n\f(ix)\n\n(x)\n\n(xi)\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n(vii)\n\n54\t\n\nAppendix 16, page 4\n\n(viii) Before land is appropriated, the user must be informed of the reason for\nappropriation, time schedule and plan for resettlement, if necessary, and options\nfor compensation.\n\nCertificates verifying the household and individual's right to use the land will be\nissued to those who have been lawfully allocated land by the local government.\nThis certification has not always been implemented incorrectly.\n\nIndividuals who have been allocated agricultural, forest, or residential land, have\nthe right to bequeath this land in accordance with the inheritance law.\n\nIndividuals allocated agricultural land have the right to rent this land out for a\nmaximum of three years if they lack the resources for production or are\nexperiencing economic difficulties.\n\n2.\t\n\nOther Relevant Laws and Regulations\n\n7. A substantial number of other laws, regulations, and decrees are relevant to land\nacquisition and resettlement. The more important of these are listed below: a summary of each is\nprovided in the Project's Resettlement Action Plan.\n\nResidence Law, 26 March 1991, of the State Council, which gives individuals the\nright to own residential housing;\n\nDecree No. 60-CF. 5 July 1994. property ownership and the right to use urban\nresidential land:\n\nDecree No. 64-CP, 15 September 1993. reguatons concerning the allocation of\nagricultural land to households and individuals to use in a long-term and stable\nmanner for agricultural production:\n\nOfficiai Message No 1044/KTN, of the Prime Minister. 3 March 1995, declaring a\nmoratorium on the transfer of rice-land to other uses;\n\nDecree No. 87/CP, 17 August 1994. regulations concerning the pricing of different\nland types;\n\nDecree No. 90/CP, 17 August 1994, compensation for appropriation of land for\ndefense, security, or national and public interest; and\n\ntransportation regulations, of which there are a considerable number; the most\nrecent is Decree No. 36/CP which, inter a/ia, deals with clearance of obstructions\nand encroachments from highway rights-of-way.\n\nD.\t\n\nSocioeconomic Survey\n\n8. As part of Project Preparation, detailed dwelling unit, asset, and land-use surveys\nwere carried out in June, July, and August 1995. The dwelling unit survey (affected structures)\nwas conducted during June and July 1995 on approximately 90 percent of the affected population.\nThis survey was camed out before the alignment was finally fixed. so that the objective of minimizing\n\n\f55\t\n\nAppendix 16, page 5\n\nresettlement through appropriate alignment selection could be achieved. Accordingly, the number of\nhouseholds interviewed (1,300) at the time was greater than necessary. Ultimately, once the alignment\nhad been fixed, the number of affected households was reduced to 960. Also, to assist with\npreparation of a plan for households that will have agricultural and forest land affected by the Project,\nthe survey teams conducted a sample survey of agricultural villages in the Project area in August\n1995. This survey, which was to determine the impact of the Project on agricultural activities, was\ncarried out over a two-week period, during which 895 households were interviewed.\n\n9.\t\nand summarized as follows:\n\nThe results of the surveys are presented in the Project's Resettlement Action Plan\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nThe affected population is estimated to be 3,460 in 960 households.\n\nOf the people affected, about 31 percent are from ethnic minority groups, mainly\nTay and Nung, located mainly in Lang Son Province, and about 18 percent of\nhousehold heads are war veterans, for whom the Government provides special\nprograms.\n\nLand-use certificates are held by 63 percent of affected people, and a further 36\npercent of affected people have verbal permission from the local authority to use\nthe land. Less than 1 percent of affected people have no legal permit to use the\nland on which they reside.\n\nE.\t\n\nCompensation Issues and Procedures\n\n10.\t\nsocioeconomic surveys and the Government's and the Bank's requirements and procedures.\n\nThe approach to land acquisition and resettlement is based on the Project's\n\n1.\t\n\nDefinitions\n\na.\t\n\nProject Affected People\n\n11. Project Affected People (PAP) means (i) anyone whose name appears in the June\nand July 95 survey list, prepared as part of the Project's resettlement survey, or a subsequent\ndetailed measurement survey (DMS); (ii) anyone who has become affected by a subsequent\nrealignment of the Project road; (iii) anyone who has become affected as a consequence of the\nrural roads component and whose structures would be partly dismantled or relocated or whose\nland would be acquired for the road works or for resettlement site development as a consequence\nof the Project. PAPs include people within the project road length who have been affected by the\nimplementation of Decree 36/OP.\n\nb.\t\n\nClear area\n\n12. For the existing alignment, the area to be cleared includes widening the road to the\ndesign width (defined as the toe-to-toe width for embankments and top of cut to top of cut width\nfor cuts) plus 7 meters (m) on either side of the highway (for rural areas) and 3-5 m (for urban\nareas), measured perpendicular to and away from the toe of the embankment slope, or the top of\nthe cut slope. For new alignment, the clear area includes the width between the toe of the\nembankment slope or the top of the cut slope plus an additional 7 m on either side.\n\n\f41\n\nAppendix 8, page\n\nROAD USER TAXES\n\nCategory\n\nRates\n\n3.

Civil works will consist essentially of upgrading the level of service of\nselected provincial and district roads, and possibly commune roads, by repairing\nembankments, constructing missing drainage structures, improving road drainage systems,\nand providing gravel overlays. The works will include the protection of waterway banks when\nthese coincide with road embankments or have the potential for damaging the road. Bidding\ndocuments will be simple in their commercial and technical aspects, and will be developed at\nan early stage of Project implementation.\n\n3.\nThe Project's civil works will be packaged into contracts with values typically\naround $100,000-150.000 with a maximum of $250,000. each covering about 10-20 kilometer\n(km) of road improvement. dependino on the extent of pavement gravelling work and the\nnumber and size of structures within the road length.

The main objective of the consultancy services is to ensure that the highest\npossible construction quality is achieved. This will be done through strict supervision of the\ncontractors' activities to ensure that all work is carried out in full compliance with the\nengineering design, technical specifications, and other contract documents. A second\nobjective is to promote technology transfer by: (I) requiring the consultants to employ suitably\nqualified Vietnamese professionals and provide them with on-the-job training; and (ii)\nappointing qualified Ministry of Transport (MOT) personnel as counterparts. A third objective is\ngenerally to facilitate the implementation and liaison with all the concerned Government\nofficials and local organizations, including, but not limited to, Project Management Unit No. 1\n(PMU-1), the rural roads maintenance unions (RRMUs), the police, and the district/commune\nadministrations.\n\nB.\t\n\nScope of Services\n\n2. The services to be provided by the consultant will include (I) reviewing the\ndesign to identify inconsistencies, etc, and advising PMU-1 of the potential impacts of these;\nand undertaking additional design work where this is found to be necessary; (iii) administering\nthe civil works contracts as the Engineer, as defined in the contract documents; (iv) preparing\nprogress and other reports (primarily monthly progress and Project completion reports); (v)\nmonitoring compliance with the environmental impact mitigation measures included in the\nscope of the Project's civil works; (vi) assisting PMU-1 with monitoring the resettlement action\nplan; (vii) assisting PMU-1 with loan disbursement documentation and monitoring; and (viii)\ntraining PMU-1 and domestic consultants' staff in contract management procedures and other\nrelevant activities. On present scheduling, it is not intended that the consultant will be involved\nin selection of the contractors; this will be undertaken by PMU-1 with assistance from other\nconsultants prior to the appointment of the supervision consultant.\n\nC.\t\n\nStaffing and Other Inputs\n\nThe consultant will provide the international and senior domestic staffing defined\n3.\nin the Project's organization and staffing charts. In summary, staffing inputs will be about 300\nperson-months for internation& consultants and 600 person-months for domestic consultants,\nover a total Project period of about 42 months. In addition, the consultant will provide such\ntechnical and administrative support staff required to adequately carry out the services. Office\nand residential accommodation, vehicles, office and other equipment, and other support staff,\nwill be provided through the civil works contracts.\n\nThe consultant must structure its staffing to maximize the efficiency of the\n4.\nsupervision operation as a whole. Therefore, the Engineer/Project Manager will manage four\nadditional professional individuals who will be dispatched and utilized by the supervision teams\non a routine or as-needed basis. These individuals will be as follows:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n\nEnvironmental/Resettlement Monitor Consultant (foreign), initially full time, then\nintermittent;\nSenior Pavement/Materials Engineer (foreign), full time;\nSenior Construction Scheduler/Quantity Surveyor (foreign), 15 months;\nAssistant to the Project Manager (domestic., ful! time.\n\n\t\n\f48\t\n\nAppendix 15, Page 1\n\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE RURAL ROADS COMPONENT\n\nA.\t\n\nIntroduction\n\n1. The Project contains a component to improve selected lengths of provincial,\ndistrict, and, possibly, commune roads in Lang Son, Ha Bac, and Cao Bang provinces. The first\ntwo are the provinces through which the length of Highway 1 to be improved under the highway\nimprovement component of the Project passes. Cao Bang province adjoins Lang Son province to\nthe west and will also be affected by the Project road. The component will be implemented in two\nparts, the first broadly to develop selection methods and, using these, to select candidate roads\nto be improved, and the second to implement the improvement works. The component will be\nprepared and implemented taking into account the approach adopted for the concurrent World\nBank-financed Rural Transport Project, which has adopted a low-cost spot improvement\napproach. The objective of this approach is to improve the reliability of road access to as large a\nproportion of the provinces' populations as possible, while keeping costs low and maximizing the\nuse of local resources. The component's Executing Agency will be Project Management Unit\n(PMU-1 within the Ministry of Transport (MOT). PMU-1 will establish a Project implementation unit\n(PIU) to manage the component on a day-to-day basis. At the province level, the component will\nbe the responsibility of sub-PMUs.\n\nB.\t\n\nObjectives\n\n2. The principle obiectives of the component are to (i) assist the Government with\nimproving the selected roads. to im prove the reliability of access to inhabitants of the Project\nprovinces; and (ii) develop the capability of domestic organizations - Government and private\nsector - to prepare and implement projects of this nature. About 6D percent of the road length\nwill be selected using economic criteria; and 20 percent using social criteria to target less-\nprivileged mountain and ethnic population in areas where population density is low and economic\np otential dim and the economic return criteria of 12 percent cannot be met.\n\nC.\t\n\nScope\n\n3.\t\nbeen divided, will be broadly as foow.\n\nThe scoDe of the services, for each of the two  parts into which the component has\n\n1.\t\n\npart  I - Preparation\n\nThe activities to be undertaken b y the consultant for Par I of the services will\n\ninclude the following, to be implemented over six months.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\t\n\nreview available studies to determine poverty and other indicators for the Project\nprovinces, and undertake additional investigations and interviews that are\nnecessary to accurately define their social characteristics, in particular the\navailability and quality of rural road transport\n\nfor each of the Project provinces, identify the rurai road network using an\nappro priate road inventory approach;\n\nprioritize the roads usina a simple screening indicato oased on ponulation density.\nimorovement cos'. ano sccia an other reievsn fac:or tne ex.ored eoonorn\n\n\f(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n(vii)\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n49\t\n\nAppendix 15, Page 2\n\nrate of return should be 12 percent or higher, except for the roads selected under\npurely social criteria;\n\ndevelop technical guidelines for the improvement works, to be based on the spot\nimprovement approach and to make use of simple labor intensive methods to the\nextent possible and appropriate;\n\nbased on a study of existing institutional arrangements, develop a Project\nimplementation structure that will allow the component to be effectively prepared,\nmanaged, and implemented;\n\nanalyze the available contractor resources in the provinces, in terms of number of\ncontractors, capability, resources, etc, and develop an approach to effectively\ninvolve these contractors in the component;\n\norganize appropriate training programs for Government staff involved with the\ncomponent, drawing on the resources of provinces that have received similar\ntraining under the World Bank's Rural Transport Project, to enable them to carry\nout the preparation work in their provinces.\n\n2.\t\n\nPart 2\u2014 Implementation\n\n5. Part 2 of the services will commence after the Government and the Bank have\nreviewed and agreed on the outcome of Part 1, in particular on the selection of roads to be\nimproved, technical aspects, and institutional arrangements. The consultant's Part 2 activities, to\nbe implemented over about two years, will include the following, in support of the PIU and the\nsub-PM Us:\n\ngeneral coordination, including planning and budget activities;\n\nengineering and technical matters;\n\nProject and contract management, including supervision, monitoring, evaluating,\nand reporting;\n\nfinancial management, including providing advice on managing and accounting for\nthe loan funds disbursed by the Bank to the component's imprest account;\n\ninstitutional strengthening, including training for Government personnel and for\nprivate sector contractors undertaking the component's civil works;\n\npreparation of manuals for Project management, technical aspects of road\nconstruction, procurement, maintenance, and other relevant activities;\n\n(vii)\n\nassistance with procuring civil works and equipment; and\n\n(viii)\n\nreview, assessment and analysis of the social impact of rural road improvements\nunder the Project and preparation of benchmark information to evaluate/review on\na regular basis the impacts on the surrounding population.\n\n\f50\t\n\nAppendix 15, Page 3\n\nD.\t\n\nStaffing and Other Inputs\n\n6. The consultant will provide two long-term specialists, and a number of short-term\nspecialists, all international, for a total input of about 40 person-months. The long-term specialists\nwill be an adviser and a construction supervisor. In addition, about 240 person-months of\ndomestic consultants will be required. The consultant will be provided with office accommodation,\nfacilities, and resources by the PIU and the PPMUs. These will be financed through the Project\nloan.\n\nE.\t\n\nReporting and Documentation Requirements\n\n7. The consultant will provide PMU-1 and the Bank with an inception report, a design\nreport, a procurement report, monthly progress reports, and a Project completion report. The\nconsultant will also provide draft and final bid documents. The consultant will submit these reports\nand documents in the form and number of copies specified by PMU-1 and the Bank, in\naccordance with the implementation schedule agreed during contract negotiations.\n\n\f31\t\n\nAppendix 1, page 2\n\nvessels and is thus the focus of inland navigation in the Mekong Delta; export cargo such  as\nrice is transshipped here, commonly directly from river barge to sea-going ship. Other\nimportant ports are in Can Tho and An Giang.\n\nB.\t\n\nRailways\n\n6. Presently, the rail network consists of six single-track lines in operation and two\nbranch lines, totaling 2,561 km about 60 percent of which are in the north of the country.\nAbout 84 percent of the network is narrow gauge, 7 percent is standard gauge and 9 percent\nis combination of narrow and standard gauges. The main trunk line linking Hanoi to HCMC is\n1,730 km long. There are 260 stations and, as an average, there is one passing track per 8\nkm. of line.\n\n7.\nAll lines are operated by the Viet Nam National Railways (VNR), which  is\nconstituted as self-financing state enterprise based in Hanoi.  Three subsidiary unions, one\neach in the north, center, and south of the country, are responsible for the management and\noperation of the rail system. A number of other unions of enterprises are responsible for\nvarious aspects of the rail industry. MOT gives overall direction to VNR and provides\nconstruction funds for new routes. VNR is required to obtain approval for its expenditure plans\nfrom MOT and other Government departments as are the other transport subsectors.\n\n8.\nFollowing deregulation, passenger traffic decreased from 24 million passengers\nin 1987 to 11 million in 1990, and further to 8.8 million in 1992. VNR statistics show a sharp\ndecrease in freight traffic, from 4 million tons in 1988 to 2.8 million in 1992, partly explained by\na change n recording procedures. Seven major commodities\u2014i.e. coal, construction\nmaterials, cement, apatite, fertilizer, machinery, and ore\u2014accounted for 83 percent of the\nfreight traffic in 1992. Haulage distances vary considerably from 1.405 km for foodstuffs to\n142 km for construction materials, with an average of 367 km.\n\n9.\nThe railway system suffered extensive damage during the Viet  Nam war when\nvirtually all bridges in the north were destroyed. Since then, bridges with a total length of\n10,000 m have been repaired, but many only on a temporary basis. Although about 1,300 km\nof new track were laid since 1975 (much of it south of Da Nang, where services had ceased\nand rails had been partly dismantled), overall track conditions are generally poor, rails are\nweak on many stretches, and rails and sleepers are often in deteriorated and unsafe condition.\n\nC.\t\n\nPorts\n\n10.\nSeven of the largest ports for sea-going vessels are under the Viet Nam\nNational Maritime Group (VINAMARINE). In terms of throughput, Saigon Port is the largest\n(4.3 million tons in 1990), followed by Hai Phong (2.5 million tons), Da Nang (430 million tons),\nQuy Nhon (300 million tons), Nha Trang (221 million tons). Quang Ninh (298 million tons). and\nNghe Tinh (80 million tons).\n\n11.\nIn addition, some ports are exclusively for coal loading and are administered by\nthe Ministry of Energy, such as Cam Pha and Hong Hai ports in Quang Ninh Province. The\nmain oil ports, administered by the ministry of Heavy Industry, are in the vicinity of Hong Hal,\nHal Phong, Da Nang, HCMC. and Vung Tau. A number of small ports are managed by\nprovinces: the largest ones are Ben Nge in HCMC and Can Tho on the Bassac River.\n\n\f32\t\n\nAppendix 1, page 3\n\n12.\nInternational (overseas) traffic in ports reached nearly 10 million tons in 1990,\nwhile coastal freight totaled about 3 million. Of the total international traffic, 60 percent was\nloaded or unloaded in VINAMARINE  ports while 40 percent of the movements were in\ndedicated ports for petroleum products or coal. Commodities with the largest international\ntraffic volumes were petroleum products (30 percent of the total); food grain (16 percent);\nfertilizer (12 percent); and coal (8 percent).\n\n13.\nAll ports under VINAMARINE handle general cargo, bulk cargo, and containers.\nOnly the ports of Hal Phong and Saigon have berths for container carriers. Port equipment is\ngenerally old. In most cases, port operations are not efficiently conducted, partly due to the\ninadequacy of cargo handling e q uipment. None of the ports are adequately equipped for\nhandling containers.\n\n14.\nVINAMARINE, based in Hai Phong, was reformed in 1990 from the previous\nstate organization, General Marine Department, which was established in 1975. In late 1992,\nVINAMARINE was replaced by the Maritime Transport Administration. As VINAMARINE, the\norganization provided overall management of the ports and shipping system and. through its\nvarious subsidiaries, owned the country's seven ventures with Vietnamese and overseas\ninterests and held part ownership of a further eight shi pping companies. Another 30\nenterprises under VINAMARINE ownership included stevedoring, freight forwarding and\nshipping, pilotage, harbor services, chandlers, a bank, a hoteL and other maritime service\ncompanies. A maritime college that provides ships offic& and crew trainina also came under\nthe purview of VINAMARINE,\n\n15.\nIn the new structure. trw Transport Aaministration is to be the policy\nand regulatory agency for the marine sector. p rovidina rnanagemen a. the state leveL out wil\nno longer exercise direct control over the business management of MOT-owned enterprises in\nthe maritime industry.\n\nD.\t\n\nAir Transport\n\n16.\nOf 16 airports in the country . onl y three (No Ba at HanoL Than Son Nhat at\nHCMC, and at Dc Nang) nave internationa passenger and freight handling services. Four\nairports (a Hal Phong, Nne Trang Buon Me Tnout. and Phu Quoc) provide scheouled\ndomestic services. The remaining nine airports are not served on a scheduled basis. Terminal\nfacilities, even at the three main airports, are in urgent need of upgrading and modernizing.\nSmaller airports have little chance to develop in the near future.\n\n17.\nThere are international scheduled flights between the two iargest airports in Viet\nNam (Nd Bai and Than Son Nhat) and about 15 cities, mostly in Soutneast Asia and Europe.\nin 1990, the three international airports handled about 18,600 aircraft, more than half flying\ninternational flights. Than Son Nhat is the most active airport in the country.\n\n18.\nThere were 8.666 domestic aircraft movements and 10,010 international\nmovements in 1990. The number of domestic passengers is estimated at 273,000\u2014an\nincrease of 15 percent over 1989\u2014and the number of international passengers at 579,000\nover half being foreign visitors. International traffic grew at an. annuai rate of over 30 percent\ndurng the last four years. Passenger services, both on the grounc and in the ai are below\nstandard\n\n\f33\t\n\nAppendix 1, page 4\n\nVietnam Airlines is a fully Government-owned entity. As of 1991, its\n19.\nresponsibilities included (i) management, operation, and development of the national airline; (ii)\nmanagement and development of all airports; (iii) management and development of air\nnavigation services; (iv) fuel supply to aircraft; and (v) management of enterprises unrelated to\ncivil aviation.\n\nVietnam Airlines' fleet consists of Soviet aircraft: Tupolev 134, Antonov 24, and\n20.\nYakovlev 40. As of mid-1991, only 12 aircraft operated and they had an average utilization\nratio of three hours per day. The present aircraft fleet is inadequate because of high operating\ncosts and low occupancy rates of passenger and freight. Air navigational equipment are\ngenerally in poor condition and need to be upgraded and adapted to new technologies in order\nto cope with the maintenance requirements of modern aircraft.\n\nCivil aviation has not historically been within the authority of MOT but this was\n21.\nrecently changed. A Civil Aviation Law passed in late 1991 is a first step in modifying the\norganization of the civil aviation subsector. The Department of Civil Aviation was created\nwithin the MOT in 1992, its function being to advise the Ministry on strategic issues related to\nair transport. This department has changed to a new Civil Aviation Administration in June\n1993.\n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 2\n\nDOMESTIC FREIGHT AND PASSENGER TRANSPORT BY

These Project accounts and related financial statements will be audited annually\nby auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audited reports and related financial statements, to be\nprepared in English, will be furnished by PMU-1 to the Bank not later than 12 months after the\nend of the fiscal year to which they relate.\n\nc.\t\n\nImprest Account\n\n67. The Bank has agreed in principle to the establishment of an imprest account for\neligible payments for RRC civil works. This will benefit the Project by improving contractors'\ncash flows and reducing the risk of company failure. The account will be established and\noperated in accordance with the Bank's  Guidelines on Imprest Fund and Statement of\nExpenditures Procedures and arrangements agreed upon between the Government and the\nBank.\n\n6.\t\n\nMidterm Review\n\n68. The Bank will conduct regular reviews throughout Project implementation. In\nparticular, in November and December 1998, the Bank will undertake with PMU-1, MOT and\nVNRA a detailed review of the Project and its implementation status. This review will cover the\nentire scope of the Project, to determine whether any adjustments to its scope and\nimplementation arrangements are warranted. The review will also address any outstanding\nprocurement problems, financing, and scheduling matters.\n\n7.\t\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n69. For the NHC, PMLJ-1, with the assistance of the NHC supervision consultants,\nwill carry out benefit monitoring and evaluation by compiling and analyzing appropriate traffic,\naxle load, and other data. For this purpose, PMU-i will arrange for surveys to be carried out to\nestablish base line data at the start of the NHC and immediately after it has been completed\nand handed over to the Government. The findings and supporting data will be incorporated\ninto the Project completion report. Systems for recording data and statistics for such\nmonitoring will be established as part of Project implementation management. PMU-i will\nevaluate the benefits of the Project in accordance with a schedule and terms of reference to\nbe agreed upon with the Bank.\n\n70. For the RRC, the Bank will agree upon the following with PMU-1 during the early\nstage of Project implementation: (i) the nature and extent of benefit monitoring, (ii) factors to\nbe measured, and (iii) base line data to be collected.\n\nF.\t\n\nExecuting Agency\n\n1.\t\n\nNational Highway Component\n\n71. For the NHC, the Executing Agency will be PMU-1. PMU-1 will be responsible\nfor day-to-day implementation of the Project. PMU-1, headed by a General Director who\nreports to the MOT Vice-Minister responsible. is charged with all works related to the\nimprovement of Highway No 1. PMU-1 is presently responsible for implementing the Bank-\n\n\f23\n\nfinanced Road im p rovement Project (Loan No 1272-VIE[SF]), 1 for which it is performing well.\nPMU-1 wi!l be responsible for all Project preconstruction activities, including selection of\nsupervision consultants, award of civil works contracts, land acquisition, management of the\nresettlement and rehabilitation plan, an ethnic minorities action plan, and relocation of utilities.\n'Once contracts tave been stoned, PMU-1 will provide day-to-day administration of the Project,\nincluding processu-g contractors' and consultant's payments, preparing loan withdrawal\napplications, monitorir1g bar, disbursements, and arranging for audits in accordance with the\nloan agreement.\n\n2.\t\n\nRural Road Component\n\n72. The RRC will be implemented by PMU-1 in association with the PTAs of Ha\nBac, Lang Son, and Cao Bang provinces. PMU-1 will establish a Project implementation unit,\nto be headed by a full-time Project manager, and will also establish sub-PMU-ls in each of the\nthree provinces. The sub-PMU-ls will include suitable staff from the PTAs. The Project\nimplementation unit will be responsible for monitoring and providing advice and assistance to\nthe sub-PMU-ls, and for overall Project implementation, including any centralized procurement\nthat is to be carried out under the Bank's  Guidelines for Procurement  or other procedures\napproved by the Bank. The sub-PMU-ls will be responsible for all of the rural road\nimprovement activities within their respective provinces. The nature and scope of these\nactivities will be defined during the early stages of the Project, but they will include preparing\nwork plans, procuring civil works contracts, obtaining approvals to award contracts, and\nmanaging contract implementation.\n\n3.\t\n\nInstitutional Strengthening Component\n\n73.\nThe ISO will be implemented by MOT and  VNRA. The Vice-Minister responsible\nwill oversee all aspects of implementation while the Director Genera ! of VNRA will be\nresponsibte for day-to-day implementation in coordination with other concerned department\nheads within MOT.\n\nG.\t\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\t\n\nEnvironmental Impacts\n\na.\t\n\nNational Highway Component\n\n74.\nSince the NHC follows a new alignment for much of its length, environmental\nimpacts require particular attention. Under the Project Preparatory  TA, and in accordance with\nthe Bank's Guidelines on the Environmental Impacts of Infrastructure Projects,  a detailed\nenvironmental impact assessment  (EIA) has been carried out, and a summary environmental\nimpact assessment (SEIA) report has been prepared. The SEIA was circulated to the Bank's\nBoard of Directors on 31 May 1996. The main impacts involve disruption of agricultural\nactivities, resettlement and land acquisition, and minor erosion along rivers. The NHC's\ndesigns and contract documentation provide details of the necessary environmental mitigation\nmeasures, and the contractual means by which they are to be implemented during\nconstruction. The scope of the supervision consulting services will include environmental\n\nSee p ara 2\n\n\f24\n\nimpact monitoring and mitigation. Specific tasks will include air and water quality monitoring\nbefore and during construction, and the establishment of procedures to continue the\nmonitoring after the works have been completed.\n\n75. With regard to NHC environmental clearances, PMU-1 has complied with the\nrequirements of the Government's EIA regulations, as issued in April 1995. In brief, the\nregulations require PMU-1, as the NHC proponent, to obtain approval of the Project's EIA\nreport from the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment, and specifically from its\nNational Environment Agency.\n\nb.\t\n\nRural Road Component\n\n76. Since the roads to be improved already exist and the proposed improvements\nwill not involve realignments or major earthworks, environmental impacts will be minimal.\nProject preparation will include an initial environmental examination and an EIA, if necessary.\nContract documentation will include provisions for minimizing construction-related impacts.\n\n2.\t\n\nSocial Impacts\n\na.\t\n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement\n\n77. The NHC will require substantial land acquisition (about 450 hectares), and\nresettlement of about 960 households, comprising about 3,430 residents (Project-affected\nPersons\u2014PAPs). Under the Project Preparatory TA, a detailed social impact survey was\ncarried out and a comprehensive resettlement and rehabilitation pian orepared (see summary\nat Appendix 16). PMU-1 will arrange for the necessary land to be acquired, and for PAPs to be\nresettled and compensated in accordance with the Government's procedures and the Banks\nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement. Where there are differences between the Government's\nprocedures and the Bank's re q uirements, the latter wifl generally govern. PMU-1 agreed to\ninform the Bank of such differences. if any.\n\n78. Reflecting the importance that the Bank places on the carefui and effective\nimplementation of the resettlement plan, the loan agreement contains a number of covenants\nrelated to this issue. These covenants require,  inter a/ia, that the people who must be\nresettled do not face a material reduction in incomes, deterioration in living standards, or\nunnecessary social and cultural dislocations, and that MOT and PMU-1 will implement and\nmonitor the resettlement plan in a manner consistent with the Government's procedures and\nthe Bank's requirements. Specifically, PMU-1 will engage a domestic agency acceptable to\nthe Bank, under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. to monitor the implementation of\nthe resettlement plan. The Bank will also monitor the resettlement process through regular\nreview missions.\n\nb.\t\n\nEthnic Minorities Action Plan\n\n79. For the NHC, 31 percent of PAPs are from ethnic minority communities. To\ncomply with the Bank's policy on indigenous peoples, the Government conducted a special\nsurvey of these PAPs and has submitted to the Bank an acceptable ethnic minorities action\nplan. This action plan includes an identification of the various ethnic minority communities and\ntheir social and economic organization, provides details of their tenancy status, identifies\ncompensation options preferred by these communities assesses any adverse tm pacts as a\n\n\f25\n\nconsequence of their minority status, and suggests mitigation measures to address the\npotential adverse impacts.\n\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\t\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n1.\t\n\nNational Highway Component\n\n80.\nVehicle operating cost (VOC) savings and maintenance cost savings were the\nonly benefits quantified in the economic evaluation. Resettlement costs were the major\ndisbenefits quantified; benefits from resettlement were not quantified. VOCs were calculated\n\"without\" and \"with\" the road improvements for typical vehicles representative of the traffic on\nthe Project road. The methodology employed for the economic evaluation, which is commonly\nfollowed in Bank-financed road projects, is outlined in Appendix 17. Two homogeneous road\nsections, the north and south sections were identified for economic evaluation purposes. The\naverage VOC savings per kilometer range from 30.8 percent on the north section to 22.6\npercent on the south section in constant mid-1995 prices. The difference is mainly due to\ndifferences between the existing roughness and the vertical and horizontal alignments of the\ntwo sections. Most of the VOC savings is attributable to passenger transport vehicles (59.3\npercent). Maintenance cost savings account for less than 3.5 percent of total benefits: VOC\nsavings account for the rest.\n\n81.\nThe economic evaluation was carried out for the two homogeneous road\nsections and for the full length of the highway to be improved. For the derivation of the\neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR), cost and benefit streams were estimated over a period\nof 20 years starting in 2001, which is considered to cover the economic life of the road\nimprovements, including periodic resurfacing of the pavement. Costs and benefits were\nestimated net of duties and taxes and were expressed in constant mid-1995 prices.\nImprovement costs include provision for construction supervision, resettlement, rights-of-way,\nand physical contingencies. Shadow pricing was not used for estimating the relative value of\ntraded and nontraded goods, but shadow wage rates were used for local labor. The annual\ncost and benefit streams are given in Appendix 17. The base EIRR for the NHC is 30.0\npercent, with the EIRRs for the homogeneous sections about the same (30.9 percent and\n29.3 percent). The sensitivity of the EIRRs was analyzed with respect to changes n the\nunderlying cost and benefit parameters (see Appendix 17). Under the most adverse\nassumption of a 10 percent increase in costs and a simultaneous reduction in benefits of 10\np ercent, the overall EIRR remains viable at 24.4 percent.\n\n2.\t\n\nRural Road Component\n\n82. The RRC is a \"pilot\" undertaking by the Bank. Because there may be delays\nand adjustments in procedures and approaches particularly during the initial stages. The RRC\nwill be monitored closely by the Bank. The RRC covers Cao Bang, Lang San, and Ha Bac\nprovinces, where the annual per capita GDP in 1993 was $100, $107, and $146 respectively.\nThe population of the three provinces totals about 3.6 million with a total area of 21.300 km2.\nTypically, an average of 5 percent of the road network in the provinces is classified as national\nroad, 7 percent is provincial road, 14 percent is district road, and 74 percent is communal road.\nAbout 7 percent of the roads are paved with an all-weather surface. Assuming that 20 percent\nof the population in these provinces are urban residents and that the rest are distributed evenly\n\n\fon the provincial, district, and communal roads, 1 km of district road has a direct influence on\nabout 2.3 km 2 and about 300 people.\n\n83.\nMost rural roads selected for improvement will meet specified economic criteria,\nbut some will be selected on the basis of social criteria. An economic rate of return of 12\npercent or more will be required for 80 percent of the selected rural roads, to be derived from a\nsimplified economic analysis of producer's and consumer's surplus. For 20 percent of the\nselected rural roads, social criteria will be used. This 20 percent will target less-privileged\nmountain and ethnic populations in areas where population density is low and economic\npotential dim. The social criterion to be used in these areas is that more than 30 percent of the\nroad's influence area is populated by an ethnic minority.\n\n3.\t\n\nProject Risks\n\n84.\nThe NHC is not subject to any significant economic risks, as EIRRs are\nexpected to remain acceptable even with adverse changes in cost and benefit parameters.\nOne possible risk is that the improved highway may not be adequately maintained after\ncompletion. Through a loan covenant, the Government will be required to review the\nmaintenance allocations regularly and to ensure that sufficient funds are available.\nAdditionally, the Bank and other members of the donor community are actively involved in\nimproving road maintenance management, planning, and implementation capabilities. The\nBank is also encouraging the Government to set up a dedicated road maintenance fund as an\ninterim measure until adequate funds can be assured under the normal budgetary process.\nDelays could also occur during implementation because PMU-i is not yet fully familiar with\nBank procedures. However, this risk is being reduced through advance action that has already\nbeen approved and is well advanced and through timely visits of Bank project administration\nmissions. The construction supervision consultants will also contribute to reducing this risk. A\nfurther possible risk is that the cross-border trade with the PRC will stagnate and traffic growth\nwill not materialize at the 10-13 percent annual rate forecast. To test this, the EIRR was\nrecalculated assuming that VOC benefits would grow at 50 percent of the forecast and that\nconstruction costs would increase by 10 percent; this yielded an EIRR of about 18 percent for\nthe overall Project.\n\nB.\t\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n85.\nThe NHC and RRC deliver substantial nonquantifiable benefits such as quicker,\nless costly market access for farmers and tradesmen, increased access for social\ncommunications, decreased waiting time for passengers, decreased time for movement of\ntrade goods with higher reliability, and, in general, better transport services for the entire\nregion. Directly affected will be the 3.6 million people living in the three provinces in the zone\nof influence of the improved highway and rural roads plus the population of Hanoi (about 2.3\nmillion). The improved roads will directly influence the transport costs of maize, soybeans,\nsugarcane, tobacco, and fresh vegetables, all of which are important crops in the area. The\narea served by the northern section has a rice deficit (Lang Son and Cao Bang provinces)\nwhile the south section (Ha Bac Province) has a surplus. The movement of rice will be\nfacilitated by the improved national highway and the improved rural roads, potentially\nimproving nutrition levels in the deficit areas. The reduction of VOCs resulting from the\nimprovement will benefit road users, particularly road transport operators. Since transport\ncharges mainly depend on road conditions, it is expected that a portion of the VOC savings will\nbe passed on to road transport users. Through this and improved efficiency the road\n\n\f27\n\nimprovements will help enable small-scale producers to participate more actively in the market\neconomy.\n\n86.\nThe inclusion of the RRC in the scope of the Project reflects the strong linkages\nbetween rural poverty and inadequate physical infrastructure. Appendix 18 describes these\nlinkages in detail, in the context of Viet Nam and the Project area. Some of the more important\nconclusions drawn in Appendix 18 are summarized here. Good rural roads affect labor\nmobility, which in turn is significantly related to economic status. People in communities\ncharacterized by labor mobility engage in more economic activities, and are more likely to have\nready access to a reliable road. This leads to greater economic diversification and more\nproductive use of farm land, all of which contribute to improved living standards. Social\nbenefits including increased educational attendance are likely to be enhanced by roads that\nare accessible for at least the greater part of the year. Better rural roads also assist in\nimmunization, mother-child health, and preventive health care programs by allowing reliable\naccess to communes and villages. In addition, a healthier rural population is an important\nfactor in lessening the number of farming days lost to illness.\n\n87.\nThe RRC provides an important additional benefit. Construction techniques will\nbe largely labor based and will distribute about $2.5 million to labor in the local area. This is\nimportant, since many villagers maintain subsistence livelihoods with minimum cash incomes.\nThe cash income earned from the Project will provide them with important additional\nresources.\n\nVI. ASSURANCES\n\n88.\nassurances, which have been incorporated into the legal documents:\n\nThe Government has given the following assurances, in addition to the standard\n\n(I)\t\n\nimplementation\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nThe Government will take all necessary actions to ensure that all land,\nrights-of-way, easements, leases and other rights in land or privileges\nrequired for the Project are made available promptly to ensure timely Project\nimplementation free from any impediment to the Project.\n\nThe Government will ensure that the notice to proceed for the\nsupervision consultancy services is issued prior to the Bank's approval of\nthe first civil works contract.\n\nThe Government will ensure that all environmental mitigation measures\nidentified in the SEIA report are incorporated in the NHC design, and are\nfollowed during construction, operation, and maintenance of the improved\nhighway and rural roads. The Govemment will further ensure that the Project\nis designed and constructed in accordance with the Banks  Environmental\nGuidellnes for Selected Infrastructure Projects (Highways and Roads).\n\nMidway through the Project implementation period (November/December\n1998), the Government, in cooperation with the Bank, will undertake a\ndetailed review of the Project and its implementation status. The scope\nof the review will include all aspects of the Project, including land\n\n\f28\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\nacquisition and resettlement. Following completion of the review, the\nBorrower will take all necessary actions to correct any problems in\nProject implementation identified.\n\nResettlement. The Government will take all measures necessary to implement\nto the satisfaction of the Bank the timebound Resettlement Action Plan\ndeveloped in conjunction with the Bank, as may be amended from time to time\nby the agreement between the Government and the Bank. The Government will\nensure that all PAPs are compensated and resettled in accordance with the\nrequirements of the Resettlement Action Plan. PMU-1 will engage a domestic\nagency acceptable to the Bank, under terms of reference acceptable to the\nBank, to monitor implementation of the RAP.\n\nEthnic Minorities Action Plan.  The Government will take all measures\nnecessary to implement to the satisfaction of the Bank the ethnic minorities\naction plan agreed to with the Bank. Status reports on the implementation of\nthe Plan will be submitted to the Bank as part of the monthly reports for the\nNHC.\n\nOperation and Maintenance.  The Government will ensure that the improved\nroads are maintained to design standards and in accordance with sound\nmaintenance practices. The Government will further ensure that annual road\nmaintenance plans are prepared for the improved roads, on the basis of the\nagreed-upon maintenance standards, traffic volumes, and assessment of\nneeds.\n\nBenefit Monitoring. The Government will monitor and evaluate NHC benefits by\ncompiling and analyzing traffic and condition data for the improved roads. PMU-\n1 wiV be responsible for collecting and analyzing the data through traffic,\nroughness. and other appropriate surveys conducted at the commencement\nand completion of the Project, and will collaborate with other agencies of the\nGovernment as necessary. The findings and supporting data of such surveys\nwill be incorporated in the Project completion report to be submitted to the Bank\nThe data to be collected and the methodology for their analysis will be agreed\nupon by PMU-1 and the Bank. For the RRC. PMU-1 and the Bank will agree on\nthe nature and extent of the benefit monitoring to be conducted and the\nmethodology for its accomplishment.\n\n(vi)\n\nSector Studies\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nThe Government will keep the Bank informed of all transport sector and\nroad subsector studies undertaken in Viet Nam, and will provide the\nBank with copies of all documents relevant to such studies, including\nconsultants' reports, and will ensure that the Bank has the opportunity to\ncomment on the recommendations contained therein.\n\nThe Government and the Bank will from time to time exchancie views on\nthe progress of the Government in carrying out the  p oiices and actions\nrecommended by such sector and subsector studies. The Government\n\n\f29\n\nwill maintain a policy dialogue with the Bank in respect of problems and\nconstraints affecting the growth and development of the road subsector.\n\n(vii) Rural Road Component.  The roads to be included under this component, and\nthe work to be undertaken on them, will be determined by the Government in\ncooperation with the Bank, and will be approved by the Bank. The roads will be\nselected on the basis of criteria agreed between the Bank and the Government,\nthe criteria to include (a) the population served by the road; (b) the extent of\neconomic activity; (c) existing traffic; and (d) for about 20 percent of the roads in\neach province, agreed social criteria to target less-privileged mountain and\nethnic populations. These sociat criteria will include the requirement that not\nless than 30 percent of the population served by the roads in Lang Son and Cao\nBang provinces must belong to ethnic minority groups.\n\nVii.

Small-scale navigation also exists on several rivers and\ninlets located between the two major deltas. Most shipping routes are open waterways. The\nmajor constraint in the use of the system is the substantial fluctuation in depth and high\nsiltation rates. During the dry season, many channels are no more than 1 meter deep. The\nchannels require dredging, but this is not possible because of inadequate budgets and\nequipment. A large backlog of dredging has thus accumulated, estimated at 10 million cubic\nmeters.\n\nInland waterway transport is operated at different levels: state, provincial,\n2.\ncooperative, and private. At the state level, the Inland Waterway Management Unit was\nresponsible to the Department of Infrastructure Management under the Ministry of Transport\n(MOT). This responsibility has been transferred to a newly established Viet Nam Inland\nWaterways Administration (VIWA). VIWA exercises management and operational\nresponsibility for all navigable river and canal systems in Viet Nam. This responsibility extends\nto maintenance and development of navigation facilities and buoys and shipping channels.\nOwn account and provincial or district (small ports) are operated by the company or local\ngovernment authority. MOT also has two river transport enterprises, but there is no\nmanagement connection between these and VIWA. The main activities of VIWA are\nengineering, maintenance, and where possible, improvements to the waterway system such as\ndredging and canal works, installation and maintenance of navigational aids, and the\nhydrographic survey and charting of the system.\n\nin 1992, 15 million tons of cargo was transported by river, accounting for 27.5\n3.\npercent of Viet Nam's total domestic freight volume, and  22.3 percent of the total passenger\ntraffic. In the north, state-owned enterprises account for 30 percent of the total tonnage and\n47 percent of the ton-km transported. In the south, the corresponding figures are 10 percent\nand 15 percent. Passenger transport is organized by provincial fleets. Trends in inland\nwaterways transport are sustained growth in the south and sustained traffic in the north.\n\nThe Red River system has five major ports: Hanoi, Habac, Hoa Binh, Ninh Binh,\n4.\nand Viet Tn. About 1,500 barges grossing 400,000 tons operate with about 280 tugs totaling\n50,000 horse power. In 1991/93, a total of 7.5 million tons of freight were transported annually\nin the system over an average distance of 220 km. The main commodity transported was coal,\ntotaling 3.6 million tons, from the Quang Ninh coal mine; most of this was carried to three\npower plants: (i) Bac Lang, 190 km from the mine; (ii) Ninh Binh, 320 km; and (iii) Uong Bi, 60\nkm. The rest of the freight consisted primarily of construction materials, foodstuffs, and\npetroleum products.\n\nThe Mekong system has 4,500 km of navigable channels, of which some 2,600\n5.\nkm can be considered as principal waterways connecting Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) with the\nsea and approximately 30 river ports in the south. Total fleet capacity is estimated at 260000\ntons. The Mekong system is navigable for small sea-going ships all the way to Phnom Penh,\n332 km from the coast. HCMC port. which is on the Saigon River 85 km from the coast and is\nconnected to the Mekong by canals, is deep enough to accommodate large ocean-going\n\n\fE.\t\n\nThe Bank's Sectoral Strategy\n\n12\n\n34.\nThe Bank's program of activities in Viet Nam in the initial period following the\nresumption of operations in October 1993 was guided by the Interim Operational Strategy\nformalized in 1993. The Country Operational Strategy Study (December 1995) was\nsubsequently prepared and focuses on facilitating the country's transition and restructuring of\nthe economy according to market-based principles while promoting balanced and sustainable\ndevelopment. The Bank's strategic objectives are to promote efficient economic growth,\npoverty reduction, and environmentally sound development, guided by the concept of\ngeographic linkages. These linkages are centered on Hanoi in the north, Danang in the\ncentral area, and HCMC in the south. The development of linkages between these growth\nareas and their hinterlands is central to the Bank's and the Government's strategy, and the\nBank is, inter alia, concentrating its project interventions on transport corridors and related\ndevelopment zones that best serve the Government's goal of rapid but balanced economic\ngrowth. Upgraded transportation corridors connecting the growth areas and selected rural\nareas would improve the overall business environment within which households and\nenterprises in Viet Nam could seek out and develop new market and employment\nopportunities. Feeder roads to the transportation corridors would reach out into the remote\nareas and help bring them more into the economic mainstream. Linkages not only apply to\ntransport but also to other economic sectors and include private and public sector participation\nand complimentarity between the operations of the Bank and other funding agencies. Given\nthis strategic framework, the Bank is addressing selected critical constraints in five areas of\nspecial interest: (i) policy reform and institutional development, (ii) infrastructure development,\n(iii) rural development, (iv) human development, and (v) resource management.\n\n35.\nThe Bank's project and technical assistance to Viet Nam's road subsector has\nbeen recognized as critical for achieving these linkages and for supporting the country's\neconomic development. While special priority is given to promoting rapid but balanced\neconomic growth, particularly through a substantial increase in investment in essential\neconomic infrastructure, the Bank's program of assistance through the proposed Project\ncoupled with the Bank's TA program, will also contribute to rural development, institutional and\npolicy reforms, and improved public sector management. The proposed Project is in line with\nthe Bank's strategy and is included in the Bank's operational program for Viet Nam.\n\nF.\t\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n36. The introduction of modern policies is dependent on the development of the\npolicy making institutions. The Bank, World Bank and some bilateral agencies are actively\nassisting MOT and VNRA to become modern well-managed Government agencies. This is a\ncontinuing process and considerable progress has been achieved. The main areas for\ncontinuing policy dialogue which fit within the overall transport sector policy dialogue\nframework of the external assistance community and the Government are outlined below.\n\n\f13\n\n1.\t\n\nknstitutional strengthening\n\n37.\nInstitutional strengthening is a major concern of the Government and is being\naddressed under the Bank's ongoing TA No. 1996-VIE. 1 The focus of the TA is broad,\nencompassing activities involving assistance to help (I) improve the organization and the\nadministrative efficiency of VNRA; (ii) VNRA implement road and road transport subsector\nreforms being pursued by the Government in collaboration with the international lending\nagencies; (iii) in drafting a road act and related rules and regulations; (iv) in the establishment\nof a computerized transport data base for the better management and planning of the overall\ntransport sector, and training of staff in transport statistic preparation, analysis, and\ndissemination; and (v) in strengthening PMU-1 capabilities to deal efficiently with foreign-\nassisted projects. Within the context of these five tasks, specific direction was given to focus\non private sector participation within a regulatory framework in which the Government\nincreasingly adopts the role of supervisor and regulator rather than carrying out operations on\nits own. Much has been achieved toward the accomplishment of these objectives. Assistance\nto PMU-1 has been completed under this TA but is being continued by the consultants\nassisting with ongoing project supervision. A computerized transport data base for the national\nroad network and inland waterway system has been set up within MOT. This needs to be\nexpanded to cover the other modes. The basic contents of a new road act have been\nprepared and some of its provisions have been implemented through a decree concerning\nroad safety (Decree 36-CP). Additionally, the TA has helped VNRA meet its new\nresponsibilities including driver examination, driver training and licensing, and collection of\nperformance data. Setting of vehicle safety standards, evaluation of the vehicle inspection\nsystem, and preparation of documents for vehicle license examination have been addressed.\n\n38.\nVNRA, established in 1993, needs continued help to develop into a more\neffective institution. VNRA has been assigned increasing responsibilities designed to make it a\ntruly modal-specific agency. The TA consultant has been assisting VNRA in establishing the\nappropriate organization, systems, and procedures to address these responsibilities.\nFollowing completion of the TA, the next step for institutional strengthening would embrace the\ndevelopment of support systems, manuals and control documents, and training of staff in a\nwide range of management and technical processes. The most pressing needs are for\nimproving road network planning capabilities, needs identification for road infrastructure\nplanning activities, enhancement of information management systems for user and\ninfrastructure activities, and refinement of guidance and control documents for maintenance\noperations. In addition, modernization of technical standards, specifications, and quality\nassurance systems and the upgrading of staff skills are very important. Such assistance is\nprovided for under the proposed Project.\n\n2.\t\n\nInsufficient Road Maintenance and Investment\n\n39.\t\nInsufficient road maintenance and investment can be traced to two main\nproblems: inadequate planning and minimal funding. Institutional support for road\nmaintenance organization is being provided through TA (see para. 38). A recent study funded\nby ODA (UK) provided an initial identification of a maintenance strategy and estimated the\nmagnitude of the problem. The World Bank is providing funding for more road maintenance\n\nTA No 1996-VIE institutional Strengthening of the Ministry of Transport, for $1.2 miIIon, approved on 23\nNovember 1993\n\n\f14\n\nequipment; the introduction of competitive contracting methods for periodic maintenance; and\ntraining for road agencies and domestic contractors in contract administration, management\nand supervision. The Bank and the World Bank are collaborating on future steps to improve\nroad maintenance planning and implementation.\n\n3.\t\n\nRoad User Charges\n\n40.\nRoad user charges are a significant source of revenue for the Government.\nWith the recent introduction of the \"traffic fee,\" the level of road-user revenues is now roughly\nequivalent to the marginal cost of road use. However, significant distortions remain and should\nbe eliminated within the structure of road-user charges. Diesel fuel and heavy vehicles are still\ntaxed at a low rate, which amounts to an indirect subsidy to heavy vehicles and thus provides\nlittle incentive for the use of efficient vehicles and the efficient use of these vehicles. Also,\ntaxes specific to the weight of the vehicle and the damage it causes to the roads need to be\nintroduced. These matters are the subject of study and, based on study results, will be\npursued further. The Bank is currently encouraging the Government to set up a dedicated\nfund for road maintenance as a short-term measure to ensure adequate funding.\n\n41.\nThe Government has agreed to keep the Bank informed of the progress of all\npolicy, strategy, and technical studies related to transport sector issues, ongoing or to be\nundertaken under various external assistance, by providing the Bank with any related\ndocuments, including consultants' reports, and seeking the Bank's comments thereon. The\nBank will continue to coordinate with the World Bank and other agencies during Project\nimplementation  V\n\nA.\t\n\nRationale\n\nIV. THE PROJECT\n\n42.\nAfter decades of conflicts and economic isolation, Viet Nam's infrastructure,\nparticularly its transport infrastructure, is badly deteriorated and is a constraint to general\neconomic recovery and investment from the emerging private sector. The Government has\nrequested external assistance for rehabilitating the national highway network, over 70 percent\nof which is in poor condition, as well for other components of the road network. The highest\npriority is given to National Highway No. 1, the most important north-south link. Immediate\nneed for rehabilitating this route was also strongly supported by the findings of the National\nTransport Sector Review. 1 The Bank, World Bank and OECF have already responded to this\nrequest through provision of loans for the rehabilitation of the stretch from Nha Trang to HCMC\n(Bank) and the stretch from Hanoi to Vinh (World Bank). OECF is funding the replacement\nand construction of major bridges (over 20 meters (m) in length) on these sections. The\nproposed Project, which has been prepared through a Bank-financed TA, 2 and will be\ncofinanced by OECF, continues this assistance. The Project will improve an additional 161 km\nof National Highway No. 1 from the border with the PRC south to Hanoi and will also improve\nselected provincial, district, and commune roads in Ha Bac, Lang Son, and Cao Bang\nprovinces to help ensure reliable road access to the primary road network. The Project will\n\nBCEOM, United Nations, Viet Nam National Transport Sector Rev,ew, Final Report, 1992\nTA No 1997-VIE:  Second Road improvement Proiecr, approved for $21 million on 23 November 1993 A\nsupplementary grant for $0.85 millior, was approved on 31 May 1995\n\n\f15\n\nhelp the Government improve the national and rural road accessibility and reliability, thereby\nfacilitating efficient transport services and promoting balanced regional development. The\nGovernment is committed to enabling poverty reduction. This involves the development of\nrural infrastructure that focuses on upgrading and extending of rural roads. The Government\nhas also stated that rapid broad-based economic development in combination with targeted\ninfrastructure and social service provision are the best approaches for reducing poverty. The\nGovernment accords high priority to the Project, in line with the Bank's operational strategy,\nwhich encourages the increased use of linkages, particularly transport, with a strong\ngeographic dimension to improve living conditions for the rural population. The strategy also\nencourages the development of sustainable Government institutions.\n\nB.\t\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n1.\t\n\nObjectives\n\n43. The Project will assist the Government with (I) improving  161 km of Highway No.\n1, from the PRC border south to Hanoi (the national highway component [NHC}); (ii) improving\nabout 600 km of provincial, district, and commune roads in Lang Son and Ha Bac provinces,\nthrough which the NHC passes, and the adjacent Cao Bang province (the rural roads\ncomponent [RRC]); and (iii) strengthening the institutions charged with managing Viet Nam's\nroad sector (the institutional strengthening component [ISO]).\n\n2.\t\n\nProject Area\n\n44.\nThe NHC starts at the PRO border and traverses two provinces (Ha Bac and\nLang Son) and the northern suburbs of Hanoi, and provides an important linkage with the\nadjacent Cao Bang Province. Excluding Hanoi (population about 2.3 million) the influence\narea of the Project Road is about 21,250 km 2 with a population of about 3.6 million.\n\n45.\nLang Son Province shares a border with the PRC and four other provinces. It\nhas a total area of 8,200 km 2 and a population of 690.000. Lang Son is a border town and is\nthe focal point for trade with the PRO. This has been increasing rapidly, from 334,500 metric\ntons (mt) in 1991 to more than 1.6 million mt in 1994. It is expected to increase to 2.5 million\nmt in 1996. Virtually all of this is carried by road. From the PRO border through Lang Son\nProvince to Ha Bac Province, a distance of about 102 km via the national highway, the terrain\nis mostly mountainous and rolling midland and produces mainly tobacco, maize, soy beans,\nand tea. Because much of the land is not suitable for rice cultivation, Lang Son Province is a\nrice deficit area. Most forest cover was destroyed long ago; no significant forest areas remain,\nalthough some reforestation projects are under way. Throughout most of this length, the\nnational highway has a minimal two-lane width and surface condition and pavement strength\nare poor. Continual maintenance at high cost is required to keep the road trafficable.\n\n\f16\n\n46.\nFor the southern section from the Lang Son-Ha Bac Province border to Hanoi\nwhere the NRC terminates at National Highway No. 5, a distance of about 66 km, the terrain is\nmostly plains in the Red River delta. Ha Bac Province is heavily populated, with 2.3 million\npeople, and a total area of 4,600 km2 , of which about 60 percent is intensively cultivated. The\nmain crops, in addition to rice which is in surplus, are soy beans, maize, peanuts, sugarcane,\nand tea. There are no significant forests or fisheries. Except near Hanoi where the road has a\nconcrete pavement, the road is old and the pavement is weak. Traffic composition for four-\nwheeled or larger vehicles is about 63 percent buses and trucks while the remainder is\npassenger cars and utility vehicles. Close to Hanoi there is a very large usage of bicycles and\nmotorbikes. Pedestrian traffic can be substantial and there is some animal drawn carriage.\nTogether, these reduce the road capacity significantly.\n\n47.\nCao Bang Province, which is included in the RRC, is adjacent to and northwest\nof Lang Son Province. Cao Bang Province is influenced by the Project road mainly through its\nroad connection with Lang Son town. The land and topography are similar to Lang Son\nProvince. While rice is the most important crop, it is in deficit. Other important market crops\ninclude sugarcane, tobacco, cassava, soybeans, maize, and sweet potato. The 75-km stretch\nof National Highway No. 4 from Cao Bang town to Lang Son town and National Highway No.\n3, which traverses the province, are in fair paved condition; almost all other roads are not\npaved and are mostly in poor condition.\n\n3.\t\n\nScope\n\n48.\nThe Project comprises six components: (i) civil works for the NHC, including\nconstruction of new or replacement bridges up to 20 m long; (ii) construction of new or\nreplacement bridges longer than 20 m; (iii) consulting services for supervision of the NHC; (iv)\ncivil works for the RRC; (v) consulting services for the RRC; and (vi) the ISC. The Bank-\nfinanced portion of the Project will consist of (i) the NHC with associated consultant services;\n(ii) the RRC with associated consulting services; and (iii) the ISO. The OECF-financed portion\nwill comprise bridges over 20 m long over the entire NHC length.\n\na.\t\n\nNational Highway Component\n\nThis component will cover 161 km of Highway No. 1. Within this length, about\n49.\n60 km immediately north of Hanoi will be constructed on a new alignment to the east of the\nexisting highway. tt will comprise the first carriageway of an ultimate dual carriageway facility\nthrough this densely populated and rapidly developing corridor, and is being constructed in\npreference to improving the existing highway because of the unacceptable resettlement\nrequirements that the latter would require. The remaining 100-km length is largely on a new\nalignment, to improve geometry and to avoid the towns and villages that have grown up along\nthe existing road. The highway improvement works will include rehabilitation or replacement of\nall bridges up to 20 ni in length, and the rehabilitation of existing bridges greater than this\nlength.\n\n\f1^\n\nb.\t\n\nBridges Longer than 20 m\n\n50.\t\nalignment is involved) under parallel projects to be financed by OECF.'\n\nBridges longer than 20 m will be replaced or newly constructed (where re-\n\nc.\t\n\nConsulting Services for the National Highway Component\n\n51. Consulting services for the NHC will be for construction supervision, and will\ninclude environmental impact and resettlement monitoring, and a substantial training\ncomponent for Government officials and domestic consultant personnel.\n\nd.\t\n\nRural Roads Component\n\n52. The RRC will improve about 600 km of provincial, district, and commune roads,\nin Lang Son, Ha Bac, and Cao Bang provinces, to provide two levels of access: (i) reliable\naccess, which provides vehicular access for most of the year, with some short-term\ninterruptions being acceptable; and (ii) minimum access, which provides a lower level of\nservice, and with longer interruptions being acceptable. The roads to be improved, and the\nextent and nature of the improvements, will be decided on the basis of population served, the\nextent of economic activity, existing traffic and, for about 20 percent of the roads in each\nprovince, social criteria. The improvements will be implemented through spot repairs to road\npavements and formations, repair and replacement of minor drainage structures, and\nconstruction of surface drainage systems. Design standards and specifications will be simple,\nand will provide for the maximum possible use of labor-based construction techniques, and for\nthe involvement of small-scale domestic contractors. There will be little or no change to\nexisting horizontal and vertical alignments, and very little, if any, requirement for land\nacquisition or resettlement.\n\ne.\t\n\nConsulting Services for the Rural Roads Component\n\n53.\nFor the RRC, services will be provided for (i) assisting with surveys based on the\nagreed road selection criteria; (ii) selecting candidate roads; (iii) developing technical designs,\ncontract documents, and specifications; (iv) procuring equipment and materials; (v)\nadministering contracts; and (vi) training. As rural road maintenance is poor because of\nfunding and management constraints, the consultants will work with PMU-1 and the PTAs to\ndevelop a system of maintenance planning and management. The World Bank will\nsimultaneously undertake a similar project in other provinces. The Bank, Government, and\nWorld Bank have agreed to coordinate closely on all aspects of the two projects, including\np lanning, management, and maintenance.\n\nInstitutional Stren gthening for the Viet Nam Road Administration\n\n54.\nThe ISC will include further assistance to MOT and VNRA, and training for MOT\nand PMU-1 staff. The exact scope will be determined based on the recommendations of the\nongoing TA and discussions of needs with MOT and VNRA management. Some of the needs\nhave been presented in para 38.\n\nOECF has already included the bodges between Hanoi and Bac Giang, about 60 km from the southern\nterminus of the Proiect road, in its program of assistance to Viet Nam. The Government is finalizing with\nOECF further assistance for the bridges on the remaining 100 km of the Project road.\n\n\fC.\t\n\nCost Estimates\n\n18\n\n55. The estimated total cost of the Project is about $237.0 million equivalent.\nincluding bridges, land acquisition, utility relocation, resettlement, civil works, and consulting\nservices. The cost comprises $150.0 million in foreign exchange, including $4.4 million for\nservice charge during construction (63.3 percent of the total) and $87.0 million (36.7 percent)\nin local currency. The cost estimates are based mainly on detailed engineering estimates,\nwhich assume that civil works will be carried out by international contractors and supervised\nby international consultants.

The Project's financing plan is set out in Table 2. The proposed Bank loan will\nprovide $120 million equivalent, denominated in Special Drawing Rights from the Bank's\nSpecial Fund Resources with an amortization period of 40 years including a grace period of 10\nyears with a service charge of 1 percent per annum. The loan will finance all of the foreign\nexchange costs for the Bank-financed portion of the Project, estimated at $97.0 million (40.9\npercent of total Project cost), and a portion of the local currency costs, estimated at $23.0\nmillion (9.8 percent but excluding customs duties and taxes), together equivalent to about 50.6\npercent of the Project cost. The OEOF loan will be for $64.0 million equvaient and wiU finance\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\f19\n\nall of the related foreign exchange costs, excluding service charge, and part of the related\nlocal currency costs, together amounting to 27.0 percent of the total Project cost. The\nremaining Project costs estimated at $53.0 million (22.4 percent) will be financed from the\nGovernment's own resources. The Borrower will be the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. The\nproceeds of the loan will be made available by the Borrower to MOT through appropriate\nbudgetary allocations.\n\nTable 2: Proposed Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nSource\n\nBank\nOECF\nGovernment\nTotal\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\n97.0\n52.1\n0.9\n150.0\n\n23.0\n11.9\n52.1\n87.0\n\nTotal\t\nCost\n\n120.0\t\n64.0\t\n53.0\t\n237.0\t\n\nPercent\n\n50.6\n27.0\n22.4\n100.0\n\n57. The amount of local currency funding takes account of the current fiscal\nsituation in Viet Nam. The country is one of the poorest in the world and the Government has\ndifficulty mobilizing sufficient funds from its own resources to meet all development\ncommitments, including rehabilitation and upgrading critical physical and social infrastructure.\nAlthough the need to generate domestic resources to finance investments for sustaining\neconomic growth is well recognized, the country has not yet developed the resource base\nnecessary to finance adequately the required level of investments without external assistance.\nUnder the current circumstances, a large investment-savings gap will continue exerting\npressure on development programs; thus external support is needed to meet some of the local\ncurrency costs of projects. In line with the Bank's policy to help provide local currency cost\nfinancing particularly for projects that address priority poverty concerns in the economically\nless developed regions, about 19 percent of the loan will be for that purpose.\n\nE.\t\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nProject Organization\n\n58.\n\nThe following summarizes the Project's organization:\n\nPMU-1 will be the Executing Agency for all components.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nPMU-1 will be responsible for day-to-day implementation of the Project.\n\nProject coordination to improve and expedite decision making will be through\nthe Vice Minister responsible for the Project.\n\n(iv) Project consultants will be employed (one each) for the NHC and the RRC, both\nthrough PMU-1. The consultant for the ISC will be selected by MOT and VNRA\nin coordination with PMU-1 with overall guidance provided by the Vice Minister.\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\f20\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n(vii)\n\nEach consultant will appoint a team leader from the consultant's international\nfirm. The team leaders will be responsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe consulting services.\n\nFor the NHC, the consultants will mobilize civil works supervision teams for the\nfour civil works contracts and, for the RRC, one team for each of the three\nprovinces.\n\nFor the ISC, appropriate arrangements will be made for the various likely\ncomponents, such as overseas training, local training, and development of\nguidelines and standards for MOT and VNRA.\n\n2.\t\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n59. A summary implementation schedule for the Bank-financed portion of the\nProject, based on a detailed schedule, is provided in Appendix 12. The NHC will commence\nimmediately after loan effectiveness, expected in early 1997, and will be completed by end-\n2000. The RRC, which will include consultant selection, identification of subprojects, and\npreparing appropriate arrangements for civil works will also commence at loan effectiveness\nand will be completed by early-2000. The ISC will commence in late 1997 and will be\ncompleted by the end of 1999. The OECF-financed bridge works are expected to follow a\nschedule similar to that for the NHC. The total implementation period from loan effectiveness\nwill be about 4 years.\n\n3.\t\n\nCivil Works Procurement\n\na.\t\n\nNational Highway Component\n\n60. The civil works will comprise four contracts, each covering about 40 km of\nhighway and valued at about $30 million to $40 million. Procurement will be undertaken in\naccordance with the international competitive bidding procedures set out in the Bank's\nGuidelines on Procurement.  As defined in the conditions under which the contracts will be\nadministered, the employer for the contracts will be MOT, acting through PMU-1; the engineer\nwill be the international supervision consultant, and the engineer's representative will be the\nconsultant's team leader.\n\nb.\t\n\nRural Road Component\n\n61. The RRC civil works will be implemented through a large number of small\ncontracts, expected to range in value up to $250,000. These contracts will be procured using\nlocal competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank. The bidding documents will\nrequire contractors to engage a reasonable proportion of the labor from the immediate area of\nthe road to be improved. Appendix 13 provides additional details of the procedures for\nprocurement under the RRC.\n\n\f21\n\n4.\t\n\nConsulting Services\n\na.\t\n\nNational Highway Component\n\n62. The consulting services required for the NHC contract supervision will be\nprovided by an international consultant in association with domestic consultants. The\nconsultant will be selected in accordance with the Bank's  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to the Bank. Staffing inputs will be about 300\nperson-months of international consultants and 600 person-months of domestic consultants.\nOutline terms of reference for the consulting services are in Appendix  14. Expertise required\nwill include project and contract management, materials and pavement engineering, structural\nengineering, and social and environmental impact assessment and monitoring. The overall\nperiod of the services will be about 45 months. Facilities and services required by the\nsupervision consultant - accommodation, vehicles, offices and equipment, etc. - will be\nsupplied through the civil works contracts.\n\nb.\t\n\nRural Road Component\n\n63. The consulting services required for the RRC will be provided by an international\nconsultant in association with domestic consultants. Staffing inputs will be about 40 person-\nmonths of international consultants and 240 person-months of domestic consultants. Outline\nterms of reference for the services are in Appendix 15. The consultants will be selected in\naccordance with the Bank's  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements\nsatisfactory to the Bank.\n\n5.\t\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\na.\t\n\nReports\n\n64. Prior to beginning the civil works under the Project, PMU-1 will provide the Bank\nwith brief progress reports on the status of preconstruction activities. Thereafter, the NHC and\nRRC consultants will prepare brief monthly progress reports on their components for PMU-1\nand the Bank. The format of these reports will be discussed and agreed upon prior to\ncommencement of the consulting services. Once the works have been completed, PMU-1 will\narrange for the Project consultants to submit Project completion reports. Quarterly progress\nreports will be required from the consultants involved in the !SC, plus subject-specific and other\nreports as may be required from time to time by MOT and VNRA and the Bank.\n\nb.\t\n\nRecords and Accounts\n\n65. PMU-1 will maintain records and accounts adequate to (i) identify the goods and\nservices financed out of the proceeds of the loan and from counterpart local funds for all\nProject components; (ii) identify the use of these goods and services on the Project; (iii) record\nthe progress of the Project, including its cost; and (iv) reflect in accordance with consistently\nmaintained sound accounting principles its operations and financial condition.\n\n\f2\n\ntotal employment. Viet Nam has a rich natural resource base; a relatively well educated,\nskilled, and disciplined work force; and a good potential for long-term economic growth. The\nreal GDP grew by 8-9 percent annually during 1992-1994 and by 9.5 percent in 1995. This\nrate of growth is expected to continue for the next 2-3 years. Recent estimates place the\nannual per capita income at about $270; the Government plans to increase this figure to $400\nby the year 2000.'\n\n5.\nWith the rapidly increasing transformation of Viet Nam's economy from a\ncentrally-planned to a market-based system, Government policies are being radically\nreoriented; public administration is being reorganized; and industry deregulation, price\nliberalization, and commercialization of state enterprises are being implemented in all sectors,\nincluding the transport sector. The rapid transition of Viet Nam's transport sector requires that\ntransport agencies and operators adapt to the new economic environment to improve transport\nefficiency and to create an institutional, legal, and financial framework conducive to\nsustainable economic growth.\n\n6.\nBecause Viet Nam is long and narrow, with a mountainous spine, transport\nmovements are concentrated in the coastal areas. Much of the infrastructure in the northerr\npart of the country was originally constructed 50-100 years ago; few improvements have been\nmade since and maintenance and rehabilitation have been constrained by a lack of resources.\nIn the south, infrastructure was improved and maintained up to about 1970. Low levels of\nmaintenance were carried out subsequently but because of age and lack of substantial\nrehabilitation resources, this infrastructure is also largely in poor condition and requires\nsubstantial resources if the existing infrastructure investment is to be maintained.\n\n7.\nViet Nam's transport system includes all modes and has (i) about 105,100 km o\nroads, 2,600 km of railways, and 19,500 km of navigable waterways, of which 7,000 km are\nclassified as main waterways; (ii) seven main ports; (iii) three international airports; and (iv) 13\nsmaller airports serving domestic traffic (see Appendix 1 for modes of transport other than\nroads). Although some progress is being made, transport statistics are limited and of dubious\nreliability. A transport data base is being prepared under a Bank-funded TA Z but, until that\ndata base is firmiy established, most statistics come from other official sources and a number\nof objective specific studies that have been carried out recently. Road transport is the\ndominant mode, carrying about 58 percent of freight and about 76 percent of passengers,'\nwhile inland waterways and coastal shipping account for about 37 percent of freight tonnage\n(28 percent and 9 percent, respectively) and about 13 percent of passenger volumes. The\nrailways and civil aviation share the rest. The modal split of traffic is expected to remain in the\nnear future with a slight increase in passenger movements by road and in freight movements\nby inland waterways (see Appendix 2).\n\nA Board information Paper entitled \"Country Economic Review\" (CER:VIE 96013) was circulated to the\nBoard of Directors on 5 August 1996 (IN. 142-96).\nTA No. 1996-VIE: Institutional Strengthening of the Ministry of Transport,  for $1.9 million, approved on 2\nNovember 1993.\nStatistics are not available for the private sector, which is estimated to carry about 30  p ercent o the tote:\ntraffic volume.\n\n\f3\n\n2.\t\n\nTransport Planning and Coordination\n\n8.\nAt the highest policy level is the National Assembly, which meets twice a year\nand has an advisory standing committee acting on its behalf in the intervening periods. The\nNational Assembly makes decisions on major economic policies, and approves the national\nplan and state budget after they have been approved by the Prime Minister. The Ministry of\nPlanning and Investment (MPI) reports to the Prime Minister. Major policy decisions, transport\nplans, and large projects, including those for external financing, require review by the National\nAppraisal Committee, which is headed by the Minister of MPI. and approval by the Prime\nMinister.\n\n9.\nThe Ministry of Transport (MOT) is responsible for the overall management and\ndevelopment of the transport sector (see Appendix 3). Four modal administrations within MOT\nare responsible for the different transport modes, one each for roads, railways, inland\nwaterways, and ports. 1 MOT has been introducing new modal administrations since 1992.\nThe Viet Nam Road Administration (VNRA), Maritime Administration, and Inland Waterway\nAdministration were approved in June 1993, while the Viet Nam National Railways was\nestablished earlier. MOT has been slowly adjusting its internal organization to establish well-\ndefined modal responsibilities and support departments.\n\n10.\nThe Planning and Investment Department of MOT undertakes overall policy\ncoordination, investment priorities, programming, and budgeting in the transport sector with\nsupport from its Center for Statistics and a number of other institutions. At the provincial and\ndistrict level, planning and programming for transport sector investments and operations are\nvested with the provincial transport authorities (PTAs), which have links to MOT and the\nprovincial people's committees 2 , but no direct responsibility to MOT except for the\nimplementation of some road works. Planning and programming functions within MOT are yet\nto be fully developed to include modern economic analysis methods and cost recovery\nsystems in transport sector planning and project selection. Nevertheless, these methods and\nsystems are slowly being introduced through MOT staff participation in recently completed and\nongoing transport related studies, seminars, lectures, and study tours. Formal training is\nrequired for a full appreciation of such techniques and systems.\n\n3.\t\n\nInvestments\n\n11. Insufficient capital and maintenance expenditure is a major constraint to\nimproving and maintaining national transport infrastructure capacity. In 1993, the national\nbudget for transport infrastructure amounted to about $131 million equivalent, representing\nabout 14 percent of the Government's total capital expenditures and about 0.8 percent of\nGDP. The allocation for the transport sector is low compared to that in most developing\ncountries, where 2-3 percent of GDP is more common. These investments reached about\n$200 million in 1995 and are expected to increase as externally funded projects are initiated.\nFor 1996 to 2000, the Government has put forward a transport sector assistance program to\nthe external funding community totaling $5,200 million, with the road sector alloted 67 percent\nof transport sector investment, railways 15 percent. and the other modes about 18 percent.\n\nThe Civil Aviation Administration was established in Februar y 1993 ana now re p orts directly to the\nGovernment\nProvncra p eooie s committees are responsibie for the Government aoministratron of the provinces\n\n\f4\n\nDetails on actual and planned transport infrastructure expenditures during 1991 to 2000 are\ngiven in Appendix 4.\n\n4.\t\n\nThe Road and Road Transport Subsector\n\na.\t\n\nThe Road Network\n\n12.\nThe road network in Viet Nam consists of about 105,100 km of roads classified\nas national (11,400 km); provincial (14,200 km); district (25,300 km); village (46,200 km); urban\n(2,500 km); and special (5,500 km) roads (see Appendix 5). Viet Nam's road density,\ncompares favorably with that in other developing countries, at 0.32 km/km 2 . It exceeds that of\nThailand (0.20) and Malaysia (0.25). Some mountainous areas are, however, still inaccessible\nby road. The longest and most important road, National Highway No. 1, extends from the PRC\nborder in the north through Hanoi, Da Nang, Nha Trang and HCMC to Nam Can in the south.\nOther important roads include National Highway No. 5 from Hanoi to Haiphong, National\nHighway No. 18 from the junction of National Highway No. 5 at Bac Ninh to Halong Bay, and\nNational Highway No. 51 from HCMC to Vung Tau. Of importance to the Greater Mekong\nSubregion 1 are National Highway No. 22 from HCMC to Moc Bai at the Cambodia border, and\nNational Highway Nos. 8, 9, 40, which connect central Viet Nam with Thailand through Laos.\nAnother important Greater Mekong Subregion connection is the road from Hanoi to Kunming\nin Yunnan Province of the PRC.\n\n13.\nMost of the national roads are old, as very lithe new construction has been\ncarried out since reunification of the country 2 in 1975, In the north, with minor exceptions,\nroads were built before 1954 and in the south, little construction took place after 1970. While\ngeometric standards are generally adequate, pavements were not rehabilitated when needed.\nthe residual strength of most roads is very poor, and, while the riding surface is fair because of\ncontinual but costly pothole patching, major maintenance, renabilitation, or improvement is\nurgently needed. For the national roads, 62 percent of the total length is paved and about 43\npercent is in good or fair condition. About 21 percent of provincial roads are paved and 25\npercent are in good or fair condition. Although the condition of urban or speciat roads has not\nbeen surveyed, it appears that urban roads are generally in good or fair condition but are\nrapidly facing capacity constraints from increasing traffic volumes. District and commune\nroads are usually earth or gravel surfaced, in poor condition, and not passable to motorized\ntraffic especially during the rainy season. MOT estimates that there are about 8,160 bridges\nwith total length of 168 km on the road network; the average length per bridge is 20.6 m. The\ncondition of these bridges is generally unknown. except for those along the 2,220 km of\nNational Highway No. 1 surveyed in 1991, most of which are in poor condition. In the north,\nover one third of the bridges were built as temporary structures, while in the south, some 50\npercent are temporary and need upgrading, rehabilitating or replacing. Also, a few bridges on\nmain roads serve rail as well as road traffic but are only one lane wide and can cause major\ntraffic delays. In addition, many of the bridges in fair condition are old and designed for low\nloads and cannot accommodate a vehicle of over 10 tons gross weight.

Initial registration data are available, but annual operating license data are\nnot. Most sources indicate that there were about 323,000 motor vehicles (excluding about 2.8\nmillion motorcycles, 24,000 three-wheelers, and military vehicles) registered in 1994, which\nconsisted of 129,000 cars and pickups, 42,000 buses, and 152,000 trucks (Appendix 6 gives\nthe most recent breakdown up to 1990). The increase of new vehicles registered and licensed\nin Viet Nam is believed to be quite high in recent years, particularly with the infusion of large\nforeign investments, but the exact increase is not known. Much of the fleet is old and\ninefficient, mostly comprising gasoline-powered small trucks with payloads under 6 metric tons;\nbut new and larger trucks are being imported and used on the national roads. Passenger cars\nconstitute a rapidly growing portion of the vehicle fleet, while two-wheeled vehicles including\nbicycles and motorcycles are used exclusively for short distance passenger travel and for\ncarrying small amounts of freight. Two-wheeled vehicles are used extensively in cities and on\ninterurban roads.\n\n15.\nRegular traffic counts are carried out in Viet Nam by the PTAs and the regional\nroad maintenance unions (RRMU), but there is not at present a structured system of collecting\nand collating these data in a usable form. Data collected for the preparation of this and other\nprojects and studies indicate traffic volumes on the road network. Average daily traffic on the\nnational roads near HCMC and Hanoi ranges from 3,000 to 21,000 four-wheeled vehicles per\nday (vpd) and congestion is becoming a serious problem. In other areas, traffic is below 1,000\nvpd on most of the national and provincial roads and below 100 vpd on local roads. Excluding\ntwo- and three-wheeled vehicles, traffic is about 65 percent heavy vehicles and 35 percent\npassenger cars. The 1994 traffic count on National Highway No. 1 ranged from 4,200 vpd\nnear Hanoi to about 1,500 vpd an the least traveled sections.\n\n16.\nViet Nam has a high number of road accidents with fatality rates about 10 times\nhigher than in neighboring countries and some 40 times higher than in more industrialized\ncountries. In 1994, 4,533 persons were killed and 13,900 persons were injured in the 13,118\naccidents reported to the police. The major causes of accidents are the undisciplined behavior\nof vehicle operators, bicyclists, and pedestrians; the confusing and dangerous mix of fast and\nslow-moving vehicles; and the use of pavements for various nontraffic-related purposes. High\naccident rates are also attributed to inadequate laws and regulations for vehicles and traffic,\ntheir lax enforcement, the poor condition of roads, and absence of action to identify and\nimprove hazardous locations. The Government is beginning to address the most critical safety\nissues and has passed legislation (Decree 36-CP 1 ), which, with new road regulations issued in\nMay 1995, provide for clearance of encroachments within the right-of-way of the road and\nreorganization of roles and responsibilities related to road safety. Since implementation of\nDecree 36-CP, the Government reports that accident rates have declined by 30 percent. Bank\ninvolvement in road and road safety issues will continue through Project design and\nimplementation and continuing dialog with concerned Government officials. The proposed\nProject provides paved shoulders throughout the length of the national highway, suitable for\n\nAssistance was g iven to MOT/VNRA in the preparation of this decree under TA Nc 1996-VIE  institutional\nStren gthening of the Ministry of T ranspor\u00b1 for $1.9 million. ap p roved on 23 November 1993\n\n\f6\n\nthe separation of slow from fast moving traffic, improved intersection design, and various  road\nfurniture including lighting, road signs, and guardrails to facilitate safe operations.\n\nc.\t\n\nRoad Transport Industry\n\n17.\nBefore economic reforms were introduced in 1986, the transport industry  was\nentirely Government-owned and operated under rigid regulation and price control. In 1989, the\nroad freight industry was deregulated allowing private participation, as was passenger road\ntransport in 1990. Road freight rates and  passenger fares have been progressively\nderegulated on interprovincial routes, except for certain basic commodities such  as rice, salt,\nand fertilizer, for which price controls have been maintained. The Government prepares a\nschedule of road freight tariffs periodically, which, if implemented, would make road transport\nvery expensive, but these official tariffs are considered indicative and the consignor usually\nnegotiates the rates with the transport operator. Passenger fares are normally subject to\nprovincial control but they are not strictly enforced particularly for intermediate journeys.\nMinibuses and shared taxis are entitled to collect higher fares than large buses, reflecting\nshorter waiting times and quicker journeys.\n\n18.\nOwnership of road transport companies can be classified into five major\ncategories: (I) MOT-owned enterprises (all are located in the north and were established before\n1975; recently they became financially autonomous); (ii) provincial or district enterprises; (iii)\nown-account operators (Government agencies, private manufacturers, and traders), with their\nown vehicle fleets; (iv) private individual operators; and (v) cooperative associations of private\noperators organized by the province or district, owner-drivers, or small enterprises. Of the\napproximately 145,000 trucks in Viet Nam, about 40 percent belong to the Government -\neither MOT, which operates commerciai haulage fleets in the north, or other ministries\n(including the military), which usually carry goods for their own accounts supplemented\nsometimes with commercial haulage. The private sector, which includes cooperatives and joint\nventures, accounts for about 21 percent of all trucks and about 15 percent of capacity. Almost\nall private operators have only one vehicle. The public passenger transport fleet is mostly\nprivately owned or operated by cooperatives, and includes tricycles, converted jeeps, and\nminibuses. The larger buses are usually state-owned\n\nd.\t\n\nRoad Subsector Revenues and Expenditures\n\n19.\nNeither the total amount of highway expenditure, nor its allocation to the various\nroad classes and types, nor the structure of their financing, is fully understood at this time.\nThe fragmented information available indicates that, because of the acute shortage of\nresources over the last few years, expenditures have been minimal, particularly for road\nmaintenance. A large part of the expenditure for major construction and rehabilitation is met\nfrom external sources. Recent estimates of road user revenues and expenditures are shown\nin Appendix 7.\n\n20.\nViet Nam applies a wide range of road user charges. These include charges\nthat are: (i) purchase-related (duties on imported vehicles and ownership transfer taxes when\nvehicles change hands); (ii) ownership-related (annual registration fees); and (iii) use-related\n(import duties on spare parts. tires, and lubricants). Furthermore, the fuel used in road\n\n\f7\n\ntransport is taxed at Dl ,267 per liter for gasoline and D607 per liter for diesel  (1995).1 The\nGovernment has recently introduced a surcharge of D300 on fuel used in road transport (traffic\nfee) whose purpose is, according to Decree No. 1 86-CP dated 7 December  1994, \"to generate\nfunds for regular repair and maintenance of the transport system of the whole country.\" It is\nnot known yet whether these funds have been allocated for the stated purpose. See Appendix\n8 for the structure of road user charges.\n\n21.\nTotal revenues from road user charges in 1993 were estimated at $193 million\n(D2,050 billion), of which about 95 percent was collected from fuel taxes. The new traffic fee\nwould have yielded (at 1993 fuel consumption levels) an additional $43 million (D470 billion).\nThe total revenue collected from road users approximately matches the funding requirements\nfor recurrent road expenditures (operating and maintenance). Road user revenues and\nexpenditures are important matters and are the subject of ongoing policy dialogue between the\nGovernment and the Bank.\n\ne.\t\n\nRoad Administration\n\ni.\t\n\nOrganization and Structure\n\n22.\nOne of the major changes resulting from MOT's reorganization starting in 1992\nis the introduction of modal administrations that are responsible for each of the major transport\nmodes. The Viet Nam Road Administration (VNRA) was established in January 1993 (Decree\n07-CP) as a department directly subordinate to the Minister (see Appendix 3). VNRA has a\nsubstantial degree of autonomy and broad powers. It has its own legal status, is accountable\nto the State Treasury, and prepares its own budget, which is reviewed by MOT and submitted\nto the Prime Minister for approval, Its role and responsibilities encompass the five key road\nadministration tasks: policy formation, planning, guidance, control, and execution.2\n\n23.\nVNRA is directly responsible for administering national roads as well as for\nregulating the road transport industry and road traffic rules and regulations. In 1995, it took\nover vehicle and driver licensing and vehicle inspection responsibility from the Ministry of\nInterior. Local authorities are responsible for provincial, district, and other local roads under\ntheir jurisdiction. VNRA is headed by a General Director assisted by two Deputy General\nDirectors, one responsible for construction and maintenance and the other for transport\nservices (the latest organization chart for VNRA is shown in Appendix 9). VNRA is poorly\nequipped to handle its broad powers and responsibilities but is being assisted by the Bank's\nTA No. 1996-VIE. VNRA is in the process of adjusting to its role. At the regional level,\nnational roads are being administered and maintained by four RRMUs, each responsible for\nabout 1,000-1.900 km of national roads. Under each RRMU are a number of sub-RRMUs with\n200-300 staff responsible for maintaining specific sections of roads.\n\nAll motor fuels are imported. Fuel taxes range from 72 percent of the cost insurance, and freight price for\ngasoline to 50 percent for diesel.\nThe Viet Nam Road Administration: Issues  and Options for Institutional Strengthening, Working Paper Al\nN. 0. Lea International Ltd., May 1995. Funded under TA No 1996-VIE: Institutional Strengthening of the\nMinistr of Transport; see p a g e 2 nara T\n\n\f8\n\nii.\t\n\nPlanning and Design\n\n24.\nMOT through VNRA is responsible for long-term planning of the national road\nnetwork and to some extent for the provincial roads. MOT, with guidance on budgetary\nmatters from the Ministry of Finance and MPI, seeks the Prime Minister's approval of its five-\nyear plan. The long-term planning exercise is carried out by the Department of Planning and\nInvestment of MDI with inputs from VNRA (and its RRMUs), and local consultants such as the\nTransport Development Strategy Institute and the Transport Engineering and Design Institute.\nThese institutes have recently been made financially independent and compete as consultants\nwith other domestic organizations for Government and internationally funded projects. MOT\nhas just started to implement a five-year plan to rehabilitate and improve about 7,200 km of the\nroad network.\n\n25.\nIn addition to the five-year plan, MOT prepares annual capital and maintenance\nplans. MOT starts the process in August of each year, when MPI issues planning guidelines.\nRRMUs submit annual plan requests to VNRA, which reviews and submits them to MOT's\nDepartment of Planning and Investment. The Department finalizes the plans and submits\nthem to MPI for approval in December, with specific allocations for major projects and a lump\nsum allocation for other projects.\n\n26.\nMOT is responsible for technical feasibility studies and detailed design of major\nroad works and bridges on the national and some of the provincial road network, usually\nthrough its in-house institutes; the RRMUs design small-scale works related to rehabilitation of\nroads and bridges. VNRA reviews the design of major works prior to implementation. Because\nof the long period of isolation, road design knowledge and techniques in the country are\noutdated and inadequate, particularly in pavement evaluation and engineering. To assist MOT\nin its modernization in the short-term and to ensure that large-scale projects are well designed,\ninternational agencies are insisting that designs be undertaken by international consultants.\nusually in association with domestic consultants. Some technology transfer takes place from\nthe international to the domestic consultants, but its effects are limited by the small number of\nlocal staff involved and continuity in terms of keeping such staff involved in this work. Results\nof Bank-financed design works have been mixed and the need is clear for more intensive\ntraining, including overseas degree programs for qualified staff. To manage the\ndecentralization of planning, design, and construction, particularly of foreign-funded major\nconstruction projects, VNRA will have to improve its design quality control and contract\nmanagement capabilities. As an interim measure, MOT has set up a number of project\nmanagement units (PMUs) responsible for the administration and control of foreign-funded\nprojects. The PMUs are learning to perform their function fairly well. They will eventually be\nabsorbed into VNRA.\n\niii.\t\n\nConstruction\n\n27. Until recently, all major road and bridge construction works have been carried\nout by force account through six construction corporations directly under MOT and for minor\nworks by the RRMUs either through contract or force account. Recently the Government has\nmade the construction companies' operations commercially oriented and for most of the large\ninternationally financed construction works in Viet Nam, these companies have formed joint\n\n\f9\n\nventures with foreign firms on commercial terms. 1 These joint ventures are still in the nascent\nstage and some administrative, accounting, and procedural changes will be required for them\nto be successful. Outside of the joint ventures, the autonomy given to the construction\ncompanies is promoting competition among them for local contracts through open bidding for\ncivil works domestically financed or allowed under international funding. The local construction\ncompanies and the executing agencies all need modernization, including management skills,\nquality control, and physical resources. The ongoing and proposed externally financed road\nimprovement projects will further stimulate the development of the domestic construction\nindustry and introduce internationally accepted contract management and quality control\nsystems. The proposed Project will continue to help domestic construction companies build\ntheir capabilities and capacities through joint venture and subcontractual arrangements with\ninternational contractors.\n\niv.\t\n\nMaintenance\n\n28.\nMOT is responsible for programming the maintenance of the national road\nnetwork and provides advice on PTA maintenance proposals. MOT issues technical standards\nand guidelines for all road classes. The road maintenance companies under RRMUs are\nresponsible for maintaining major national roads (46 percent of the national road network),\nwhile PTAs are responsible for the remainder of the national road network and the provincial,\ndistrict, and commune roads. This is not a very efficient or consistent organization for national\nroad maintenance management. Alternative arrangements have been developed and are\nbeing discussed with MOT and VNRA officials.\n\n29.\nThe most recent study, 2 by Kirkpatrick, covering development of a road\nmaintenance strategy estimates that maintenance expenditures for national roads cover only\nabout 25 percent of needs; thus, maintenance on most of the national road network is being\nneglected. However, despite the budget p roblem, PTAs and RRMUs have mobilized existing\nresources to maintain vital sections of these roads. Nonetheless, substandard maintenance\nhas resulted in relatively high surface roughness levels, often soon after repairs have been\ncompleted. In addition, the planning and programming for maintenance does not rely on\nsystematic information on road conditions and completed maintenance activities. An\nappropriate road maintenance management system is needed to help planners of VNRA,\nPTAs, and RRMUs decide on major maintenance intervention levels, timing, and monitoring.\nThe Kirkpatrick study undertook a detailed evaluation of selected national and provincial roads\nand recommended that a road inventory management system be put in place and used as a\nbasis for investment and maintenance planning. Operationally, the World Bank is providing\nequipment and TA to the RRMUs for implementing maintenance and minor road works on a\npilot basis. For rural road maintenance, the consultants to be provided under the proposed\nProject in collaboration with parallel World Bank initiatives will help prepare a maintenance\nplan and budget and suggest alternative funding sources.\n\n2\t\n\nVietnamese contractors have successfully completed a BanK-financed road improvement contract in the\nLao Peoples Democratic Republic.\nScott Wilson Kirkpatrick.

The study was funded by ODA (UK\n\n\fB.\t\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n10\n\n30.\nThe Government intends to increase real per capita GDP to $400 by the year\n2000. To realize this goal, the Government recognizes that significant constraints need to be\novercome. The major constraints are (i) a low level of domestic savings, (ii) inadequate and\ndilapidated physical infrastructure, (iii) an insufficiently developed financial system, (iv) a\nregulatory and institutional framework that is not yet fully compatible with the needs of a\nmarket-oriented economy or of the private sector, and (v) the lack of managerial and technical\nskills required by a market based system.\n\n31.\nThe Government is implementing a transport sector reform program that aims to\nimprove transport efficiency and create an institutional and financial framework conducive to\neconomic growth. Most notably in the past few years, the Government has taken a number of\nreforms in this direction, such as (i) eliminating cargo allocation to specific modes, (ii)\nabolishing prescribed tariffs for road and inland waterway freight transport (except for certain\ncommodities considered of strategic and social importance) and decentralizing control over\npassenger fares, which are now determined by the provinces, (iii) relaxing of controls over\nentry by less restrictive licensing arrangements and allowing own-account fleets (including the\nmilitary) to carry for third parties, (iv) opening of interurban passenger transport to competition,\nin stages, and placing of urban passenger transport under the control of the provincial people's\ncommittees, which allocate routes and determine prices, (v) commercializing state transport\nenterprises and abolishing most direct operating subsidies to them, (vi) granting permission for\nthe establishment of private transport enterprises and private sector participation in transport\ninfrastructure investment and operation, (vii) reorganizing MOT into modal administrations with\nbroad responsibilities under the overall authority of the minister, and (viii) initiating steps\ntOwards cost recovery from users of transport infrastructure provided by the state. In the\nfuture, these reform initiatives need to be expanded and enhanced to eliminate remaining\nimpediments to efficient markets and transport institutions. Under the Enhanced Structural\nAdjustment Facility arrangement with the International Monetary Fund, certain policy reforms\nrelated to transport are expected to be accomplished from 1996 to 1998, including\nrehabilitation and development of the road network, the urban transport systems, ports, and\ninland waterways; an improved regulatory framework for private transport services; and\nimproved cost recovery, operations, and maintenance procedures. Bilateral and multilateral\nfunding agencies are assisting the Government to achieve these objectives. The Bank, in\nparticular, is assisting with institutional development including organization, policy reform, and\ninvestment and maintenance planning.\n\nC.\t\n\nExternal Assistance to the Road Subsector\n\n32. Until the drastic cutbacks in aid from the former Soviet Union and other member\ncountries of the former Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) in the late 1980s, Viet\nNam had been heavily dependent on aid from these countries. Most assistance was in the\nform of equipment, construction materials, and TA (mostly for the construction of major\nbridges). Following the cessation of CMEA assistance, some grants for sector studies and\npreparation of projects for external funding have been provided to MOT. In 1990, the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) provided a $970,000 grant for the preparation of\nthe National Transport Sector Review. For road project preparation, the Finnish international\nDevelopment Agency granted $500,000 (Fmk2.0 million) and the Canadian International\nDevelopment Agency $550,000 for detailed engineering and preparation of tender documents\nfor the rehabilitation of about 430 km of road along National Highway 1 from Hanoi to Vinh\n\n\fli\n\nwhich has Deen funded by the World Bank, and about 435 km of National Highway I from\nHCMC to Nha Trang, which has been financed by the Bank. 1 With the relaxing of sanctions\nagainst external funding, Viet Nam has received considerable project and technical assistance\nfor the road subsector (see Appendix 10). The Bank and the World Bank assistance is\nfocused on rehabilitation of sections of National Highway 1; OECF is funding the major\nbridges on these same stretches. France is funding construction of a new bridge on National\nHighway I at Gianh. Improvement of National Highway 5 from Hanoi to Haiphong (106 km) is\nbeing financed by Taipei,China and Japan, and National Highway 18 from Chi Linh to Bai\nChan (81 km) is being financed by the Republic of Korea. The Bank and the World Bank are\nalso preparing additional financial assistance for the improvement of the remaining stretches of\nNational Highway 1 and selected improvements to rural roads. Australia is funding the\npreparatory activities and construction of a major bridge across the Mekong River at My Thuan.\nBilateral assistance for studies has also been forthcoming, most notably for an investment and\nmaintenance strategy study of national and provincial roads and a study of all major bridges,\nboth funded by ODA (UK). Because of the volume of assistance received and proposed,\ncoordination among the various agencies is essential. The Bank is taking a very active role on\nthis. While the annual meeting between the Government and funding agencies provides a\nbasic framework for aid coordination, these meetings are being supplemented by regular\nsubsectoral meetings. A transport sector meeting, organized by the Government with support\nfrom the World Bank was held in October 1994. The Bank provided the main support to the\nGovernment in organizing a road subsector conference of funding agencies in January 1996\nand the Government is organizing a follow-up meeting scheduled for November 1996. These\nmeetings are essential to understanding the Government's needs and the capacity of the\nfunding agencies to help meet these needs in a coordinated manner. UNDP is assisting with\npreparation of an aid coordination data base.\n\nD.\t\n\nLessons Learned\n\n33. Although the Bank's road sector assistance to Viet Nam commenced only\nrecently, a number of lessons have already been learned. The most difficult preconstruction\nactivities under the earlier project have now been completed, and the lessons learned will be\nsufficient to allow the Project to proceed through to contract award without significant difficulty.\nHowever, the first project showed that the Government's approval procedures are very slow\nand require streamlining. The proposed Project addresses this problem by using advance\naction for procurement of civil works contractors and selection of a supervision consultant\n(approved in March 1995). Both activities are now proceeding, with the objective that civil\nworks and consultant's contracts will be ready to sign immediately after the Project loan has\nbeen declared effective. The Project also addresses the involuntary resettlement issue based\non experience gained from the World Bank's concurrent first and second highway rehabilitation\nprojects (there was very little resettlement required for the Bank's ongoing first road\nimprovement project). The project preparatory TA for the proposed Project has produced a\ndetailed resettlement action plan, an Ethnic Minorities Action Plan, and the TA consultant is\nassisting PMU-1 with delineating the required right-of-way boundaries in the field as a first step\nin the land acquisition and resettlement process.
