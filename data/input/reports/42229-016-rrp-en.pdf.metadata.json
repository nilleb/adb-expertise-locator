THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Kingdom of Bhutan for the Secondary Towns Urban Development Project.  \n \n2.  The project will improve water supply in three secondary towns of Samdrup Jongkhar, \nSarpang, and Trashigang; improve sewerage in Samdrup Jongkhar; and develop drainage and \nroad infrastructure in Sarpang\u2019s new satellite town.1 The project will support the strengthening of \ninstitutional capacity for the management and operation and maintenance (O&M) of municipal \ninfrastructure assets; and develop water tariff guidelines. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Bhutan has a population of 692,895 and is urbanizing at a rapid pace; the urbanization \nrate in 2017 was 38.4%, up from 25.4% in 2000.2 At this rate, 50% of Bhutan\u2019s population will be \nurban by 2030 and about 75% by 2040.3 Rapid urbanization in Bhutan is characterized by two \nkey features. First is that the pace of urban infrastructure development and basic services have \nfallen  short  of  the  growing  demand,  resulting  in  a  deficit  of  urban  infrastructure  and  the \ndeterioration of basic urban services. Second is the unbalanced growth, predominantly around \ntwo cities that account for 40% of Bhutan\u2019s urban population: Thimphu, the country\u2019s capital city; \nand Phuentsholing, the main trading gateway with India. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nbeen supporting Bhutan\u2019s urban development since 1983 and much of the assistance since 1998 \nhas focused on developing Thimphu and Phuentsholing.4 ADB\u2019s timely support in these two cities \nhas prevented urban sprawl, encouraged planned urban expansion, introduced land pooling,5 \nenhanced livability, improved connectivity, and boosted growth. \n \n4.  The growth of Bhutan\u2019s secondary towns is constrained by deficiencies in infrastructure \nand basic urban services resulting from inadequate urban planning, weak urban institutions and \nmunicipal  finances,  limited  budgetary  support,  and  limited  local  capabilities  for  urban \ninfrastructure development. Water supply service in the majority of secondary towns is intermittent \nfor 2\u201312 hours daily. Without a continuous water supply, it is difficult to assess nonrevenue water \nbut estimates suggest the range to be 30%\u201355%.6 Water tariffs cover only about 20% of the O&M \n                                                \n1  The project preparation was supported by technical assistance: Asian Development Bank (ADB).

Under the Land Pooling Rules of the Kingdom of Bhutan (2009), the contribution ratio from \nlandowners should not exceed 30% of their original property area.  \n6  ADB. 2016. Sector Assessment Report. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila (TA 8551-BHU). \n \n ", "2 \ncosts of water supply. Less than half of secondary towns have a piped sewerage system (footnote \n6). The government is concerned about this unbalanced urbanization.7 \n \n5.  To  enable  balanced  and  equitable  growth,  the  government\u2019s  strategy  for  urban \ndevelopment  (footnote  7)  aims  to  foster  secondary  towns  into  regional  growth  centers  by \ndeveloping trade, transport, logistics, and manufacturing.8 Medium-scale industries are being \nestablished along the regional centers in southern Bhutan that border India, including Samdrup \nJongkhar and Sarpang, both of which are secondary towns identified as growth centers. The \nsecondary towns need substantial urban infrastructure improvements to realize the government\u2019s \nvision. The project is designed to complement the government\u2019s efforts to develop secondary \ntowns to ensure Bhutan\u2019s balanced urbanization. \n \n6.  The project will support infrastructure development and institutional strengthening in three \nimportant secondary towns\u2014Samdrup Jongkhar and Sarpang in the southern border region of \nBhutan, which are planned as growth centers with high economic potential (para. 5); and \nTrashigang, the largest urban center in eastern Bhutan, which has gained importance with the \nopening in 2017 of the Yonphula airport, which was supported by ADB.9 These towns were \nselected for their strategic economic importance.  \n \n7.  Samdrup  Jongkhar  and  Sarpang  will  host  two  of  the  four  industrial  estates  being \ndeveloped by the government to promote manufacturing and create jobs.10 Samdrup Jongkhar, a \ngateway town to India\u2019s Assam state, is a key border town in the South Asia Association for \nRegional Cooperation road corridor 5.11 It is located 8 kilometers (km) from the 58.7 hectare \nMotanga industrial estate, which has capacity for 20 heavy manufacturing units. Sarpang, also \nlocated close to the Assam border, is 16 km from the 306-hectare Jigmeling industrial estate \n(footnote 10). Trashigang\u2019s recent access to air connectivity and strategic location on the east\u2013\nwest highway makes it an important tourist gateway to the less-explored eastern Bhutan. In \npreparation for the changes that will come with these strategic developments, these towns are \nalready undertaking planned urban expansions, including the development of a new satellite town \nin Sarpang.12  \n \n8.  There is a need to improve basic urban services and expand infrastructure in the newly \nplanned town extensions to meet the specific needs. Residents of Samdrup Jongkhar and \nSarpang get less than 8 hours water supply per day, while residents of Trashigang have adequate \nwater supply but are affected by poor water quality and more than 40% nonrevenue water losses. \nSamdrup Jongkhar, which is the largest of the three project towns, needs to extend its sewerage \n                                                \n7  Government of Bhutan, Ministry of Works and Human Settlements. 2008.

Kingdom of Bhutan: Air Transport Connectivity Enhancement Project.  \n10  The government, with the support of the Government of India, is developing four industrial estates with capacity for \nmore than 300 small and medium-sized enterprises and 200 major industries. These estates are Jigmeling in \nSarpang, Motanga in Samdrup Jongkhar, Dhamdum in Samtse, and Bondeyma in Mongar. Motanga and Jigmeling \nare expected to be fully operational by 2019. \n11  The road corridor runs between Samdrup Jongkhar, Shillong, Sylhet, Dhaka, and Kolkata.

The local governments were \nclosely involved in project preparation ensuring that the solutions were tailor-made to the unique \ncontext of each town.14 \n \n9.  Strategic context. The project is aligned with the government\u2019s Eleventh Five-Year Plan, \n2013\u20132018,  which  focuses  on  balanced  and  sustainable  urban  development  of  human \nsettlements.15 It is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for Bhutan, which \nidentifies inclusive economic growth as a key strategic pillar; and is included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan for Bhutan, 2018\u20132020.16 It will contribute to Sustainable Development \nGoals 6 (ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all) and 11 \n(making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable). \n \n10.  Lessons. The project incorporates the following lessons from ADB\u2019s previous urban \ndevelopment  operations  in  Bhutan:  (i)  strengthen  municipal  capacities  in  O&M  and  asset \nmanagement, (ii) ensure high project readiness for timely start of construction activities, and (iii) \nsupport infrastructure investments in planned town extensions to prevent urban sprawl.17  \n \n11.  Value addition. The project will deepen regional economic cooperation by complementing \nthe government\u2019s investments in two growth center towns bordering India, and support one town \nwith high tourism potential in the poorer eastern region. The project will support proactive, planned \nurbanization through infrastructure investments in planned town expansions, including enabling \nthe development of Sarpang\u2019s satellite town, for which land was made available through land \npooling. The project will also complement ongoing infrastructure developments being undertaken \nby the government and ADB in the three towns.18 To ensure operational sustainability, the project \nwill support municipal capacity building for the management and O&M of urban infrastructure \nassets (including nonrevenue water reduction) and develop a staged water tariff framework to \nenable regular tariff increases.19 Nonrevenue water will be significantly reduced through metering, \npressure management, and training. Targeted community initiatives such as water, sanitation, \nhygiene behavior change, communication, and increasing women\u2019s role in project activities will \ncomplement institutional strengthening.  \n \n \n \n                                                \n13  Due to low population densities, piped sewerage is not recommended in Sarpang and extension areas of Trashigang, \nwhere appropriate septage management is practiced.  \n14 Sarpang and Trashigang do not have municipal governments and fall within the jurisdiction of the respective \ndzongkhags (district administration). Samdrup Jongkhar has its own municipal government (thromde).  \n15 Government of Bhutan, Gross National Happiness Commission. 2013. Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2013\u20132018). \nThimphu.

Manila. \n17  Lessons from the success of the ADB-supported land pooling in south Thimphu under the Urban Infrastructure \nProject (footnote 4) have been incorporated into the infrastructure investments in the new satellite town of Sarpang.  \n18 The project\u2019s water supply investments in Samdrup Jongkhar (network and household connections) will complement \nthe investments under ADB\u2019s ongoing Urban Infrastructure Project (footnote 4), which is financing upstream \ninfrastructure (intake and water supply treatment) and are expected to be completed by mid-2018. The sewerage \nnetwork investments in Samdrup Jongkhar will complement government\u2019s ongoing investments in waste water \ntreatment. In Trashigang and Sarpang, the loan will complement the government\u2019s recent investments in water \ntreatment. \n19 In Bhutan, water supply and sewerage services are maintained by the town administrations. Tariff increases are \napproved by the Ministry of Finance. As of May 2018, no guidelines exist for tariff preparation and approvals. \n ", "4 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impact: balanced and sustainable development of \nhuman settlements in Samdrup Jongkhar, Sarpang, and Trashigang ensured (footnote 15). The \nproject will have the following outcome: quality, efficiency, and sustainability of urban services \nimproved.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  Output 1: Urban infrastructure expanded and/or upgraded. The project will support (i) \nconstruction of 46.8 km of new water transmission lines, 36.7 km of new water distribution \npipelines, and upgrading of 2.5 km of existing water transmission pipelines; (ii) construction of six \nnew  ground-level  service  reservoirs  with  total storage capacity  of  1,300  cubic  meters; (iii) \nconstruction of two new water intake structures with 3.5 million liters per day (MLD) capacity; (iv) \ncommissioning of one new water treatment plant  with 1.2 MLD capacity and augmenting one \nwater treatment plant from 0.6 MLD to 1.0 MLD capacity; (v) provision of 800 new metered water \nsupply  connections  (685  residential  connections  and  115  institutional  connections);  (vi) \nconstruction of 2.5 km of sewage collection pipelines with 250 new connections (210 residential \nconnections and 40 institutional connections); and (vii) provision of 9 km of new and improved \ndrains and 3.74 km of new roads in Sarpang. Features of the subprojects include improving \nservices in existing town areas, expanding service coverage to the recently planned town \nextensions,  enhancing  climate  resilience  of  facilities,20 and  completing  water  supply  and \nsewerage infrastructure in Samdrup Jongkhar, building on the ongoing ADB loan and government \ninterventions (footnote 18).  \n \n14.  Output 2: Capacity of institutions and local communities strengthened. This includes \n(i)  developing  a  staged  water  tariff  framework  for  the  three  project  towns;  (ii)  conducting \nawareness-raising campaigns for at least 3,500 people (40% women) on gender and public \nhealth-related issues such as water conservation; solid-waste segregation and reduction; and \nwater,  sanitation,  and  hygiene;  (iii)  improving  knowledge  and  skills  on  O&M  and  asset \nmanagement of municipal infrastructure for 50 staff (at least 25% women) from the project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU),  project  implementation  units,  and  other  municipal  units;  and  (iv) \nmonitoring project gender equality results through the gender equality monitoring system of the \nNational Commission for Women and Children. \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  The technical due diligence included a comprehensive review of the project\u2019s feasibility \nstudies, detailed engineering designs, cost estimates, and site investigations. Technical aspects \nwere appraised based on (i) relevance, benefits, proposed designs, ease of implementation, and \ncost-effective operations; (ii) most cost-effective technical process; (iii) full lifecycle costs; (iv) \nmaximizing coverage area; (v) minimizing adverse environmental and social impacts; and (vi) \noptimal timelines for implementation through high project readiness. The detailed designs are \ntailored to enable seamless integration of the new infrastructure with existing facilities, considering \nleast lifecycle cost of the entire system and use of relatively simple maintenance methods. The \nworks are small and standard, and the country has sufficient capacity for their execution. The \ndetailed designs will address flood and landslide risks associated with increased precipitation \nbecause of climate change (footnote 20). The deployment of full-time site engineers through the \nproject management and supervision consultant will ensure timely and quality construction.  \n \n ", "7 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n21.  Economic analysis. The economic internal rates of return of subprojects range from 9.2% \nto 21.0%, with the combined economic internal rate of return calculated at 15.3%, which is higher \nthan the economic opportunity cost of capital of 9.0%, indicating significant economic returns. The \nanalysis captured the value added from improved water supply and sanitation resulting in health \nbenefits and saved resources for the beneficiaries in the three towns. The sensitivity analysis \nrevealed that the results are also satisfactory against all downside risks, i.e., (i) a capital cost \noverrun of 20%, (ii) an overrun in O&M costs of 20%, (iii) a decline in estimated benefits of 20%, \n(iv) a 1-year delay of implementation, and (v) all downside risks combined.25 \n \n22.  Financial analysis. The financial analysis assessed whether the project towns can cover \nthe incremental and recurrent  costs of the proposed project, since all the subprojects are \nestimated not to generate sufficient revenues to cover the full costs, including capital and \noperation expenditures. The overall municipal financial position is projected reflecting incremental \nrevenues and expenditures as well as debt service requirements based on past performance, \ngrowth  trend  of  revenue  streams,  and  expected  population  growth.  The  annual  average \nincremental recurrent costs of the project are estimated to represent about 5% of the maintenance \nbudget of project towns. The government has also committed to providing adequate funds toward \nthe  O&M  of  project  facilities  through  budgetary  allocations  or  other  means.  The  financial \nprojections of the towns demonstrate that, by improving collection efficiency, rationalizing tariffs, \nand continuing the government\u2019s financial support, the revenue accounts will remain in surplus.26 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n23.  Financial  management.  The  financial  management  assessment,  procurement \nassessment, and the assessment of the anticorruption policy conducted for the Ministry of Works \nand  Human  Settlements  (MOWHS)  identified  no  major  issues.  The  financial  management \nassessment concluded that the MOWHS could undertake the financial management of ADB-\nfinanced projects. The overall financial management risk assessment for the project is moderate \nas the MOWHS has experience in handling ADB- and World Bank-funded projects of substantial \nvalue. In addition, the MOWHS has an established legal, institutional, and monitoring framework \navailable  for  budgeting,  accounting,  and  auditing.  The  risk  mitigation  measures  include  (i) \nstrengthening the accounts and finance divisions of the PMU by engaging qualified staff for the \ntimely preparation of financial reports, (ii) procuring a suitable accounting package for establishing \nbetter reporting and monitoring systems, (iii) training PMU staff on project financial management, \nand (iv) effectively implementing the systematic plans of the MOWHS and project towns for \nenhancing revenues and reducing costs.  \n \n24.  Procurement. The procurement classification is B. Procurement will be undertaken at the \nexecuting agency level. The procurement risk assessment concluded that the overall procurement \nrisk for the project is moderate, highlighting the need for procurement training and additional \nassistance  through  consultants.  To  address  these  issues,  the  project  management  and \nsupervision consultants will provide support to the PMU and conduct regular procurement training \nsessions to improve procurement capacity.  \n \n25.  Anticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  MOWHS.  The  specific  policy \n                                                \n25 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. The mitigation measures \nin the project design require the PMU to establish (i) a project website for transparency in project \nimplementation and safeguards, and (ii) a grievance redress system for handling complaints. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n26.  The poverty rate in the three towns is 14.8%, higher than the national poverty rate of \n8.2%.27 The satellite areas of the towns have lower access to basic services and economic \nopportunities as well as lower household incomes (around 60% of the average household \nincomes in the main town). Lack of access to reliable and quality services, time spent on water \ncollection, and the burden of waterborne disease are some of the key issues that affect the poor. \nThe project\u2019s pro-poor design features include (i) providing improved water supply including \nmetered connections in all the three towns (covering all poor and vulnerable households), \nbenefitting 18,500 people (including 8,917 women); (ii) providing piped sewerage collection \nsystems in new town extension areas of Samdrup Jogkhar (covering all poor and vulnerable \nhouseholds), benefitting 3,500 people (including 1,687 women); (iii) preparing tariff guidelines to \nensure lifeline tariffs and possible cross-subsidies for the poor; and (iv) generating jobs for skilled \nand unskilled labor, including the poor, vulnerable groups, and women, during construction. \nCompliance with host country core labor standards has been included in the loan agreement and \nbidding documents.  \n \n27.  Gender. The project is categorized as \u201ceffective gender mainstreaming.\u201d Poor households \nheaded by women comprise about 3.5% of the population, with the major issue facing women \nbeing time poverty because of the burden of water collection and maintaining household hygiene. \nThe  gender  action  plan  addresses  these  issues  and  is  designed  with  clear  targets, \nresponsibilities, and allocation of resources.28 Gender design features include (i) increasing \nwomen\u2019s access to safe water and sanitation, thereby reducing time poverty; (ii) awareness-\nraising campaigns for water conservation, solid-waste reduction and segregation, and water, \nsanitation, and hygiene to target at least 3,500 people (40% women); (iii) including women in \nproject  management  and  municipal  trainings;  (iv)  capacity  building  on  gender  for  project \nstakeholders; (v) conducting sample impact evaluation to assess women\u2019s satisfaction with \nimproved services; and (vi) project gender reporting through the national gender reporting system.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n28.  Environment. The project is categorized B for the environment in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). The project involves the construction and/or upgrade of water \ntreatment plants, water transmission and distribution networks, a sewerage network, urban roads, \nand drainage. The project components do not pass through environmentally sensitive areas, and \nno  significant  and  irreversible  environmental  impacts  are  expected.  Eight  draft  initial \nenvironmental examination reports including environmental management plans were prepared \nbased  on  detailed  designs  and  preliminary  designs  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website.29 \nAnticipated environmental impacts during implementation include construction-related issues \nsuch as dust, noise, waste from construction and worker camps, traffic congestion, erosion, \nsiltation, and occupational health and safety issues. Key operational impacts include health \nhazards because of poor water quality, increased generation of sewage and sullage because of \n                                                \n27 ADB. 2016.

Six initial environmental \nexamination reports (covering five contract packages) have been prepared based on detailed designs.  \n ", "9 \nenhanced water supply, and the need to dispose of waste from filter beds in treatment plants. To \naddress these impacts, the project design includes adequate water monitoring guidelines and \nmethods for safe disposal of waste. The environmental management plans\u2014which are part of the \nbidding document and mandatory for the contractors\u2014include mitigation measures to address all \nconstruction- and operation-related impacts. The draft initial environmental examinations will be \nupdated  and  finalized  based  on  detailed  engineering  designs  and  alignments  and  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB for disclosure. \n \n29.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement. The project will not result in physical and economic displacement. One resettlement \nplan and three due diligence reports were prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009), and will be updated after detailed measurement surveys are completed.30 \nInvoluntary resettlement impacts of the project have been adequately assessed and the proposed \nmitigation measures are adequate. The resettlement impacts include tree and/or crop loss for up \nto 19 agricultural landholders for the laying of about 2 km of water transmission pipelines in \nSarpang. Land for development of basic services in the Sarpang satellite town was acquired \nthrough land pooling initiated in 2011, wherein 93 landowners donated their land in exchange for \ndevelopment of basic urban services. Land pooling was not undertaken in anticipation of ADB \nfinancing.31 The due diligence process (including a third-party independent assessor\u2019s report) \nconfirms that there was no asymmetry in information availability, land inclusive of nonland assets \nwas voluntarily pooled, no coercion was involved, and the process was undertaken in a fair and \ntransparent manner. Compensation for nonland assets was paid in line with government policy. \nThe safeguard documents are disclosed on the ADB website and information shared with the \naffected people.  \n \n30.  Project preparation included meaningful and widespread consultation, and the concerns \nof affected people and stakeholders have been incorporated into the project design. Consultation \nwith all communities in the project area will continue during implementation, and a grievance \nredress mechanism will be established. The executing agency is familiar with ADB safeguard \npolicies, having previously implemented two ADB-funded projects and currently implementing \nanother ADB urban project in Thimphu, Phuentsholing, and Samdrup Jongkhar (footnote 4). It \nhas adequate institutional capacity and commitment to manage social and environmental risks. \n \n31.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified category C for indigenous peoples. No \ndistinct and separate indigenous peoples live in the project areas.  \n \n32.  Climate change. The climate change risk screening confirms that the project has medium \nclimate  change  risk.  The  project  will  incorporate  measures  to  mitigate  risks  related  to \nearthquakes, landslides, floods, and climate change.32 Water intake structures and transmission \nlines were designed for enhanced resilience to flooding and landslides (footnote 20).  \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n30  Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Land pooling was done voluntarily and not in anticipation of ADB financing and, therefore, does not trigger principles \nunder Safeguard Requirements 2: Involuntary Resettlement (Appendix 2 of Safeguard Policy Statement).  \n32  Project Climate Risk Assessment and Management Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n \n ", "10 \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n33.  The  project  is  considered  low  risk.  Significant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are \nsummarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management \nplan.33 The overall benefits are expected to outweigh the costs of mitigation. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisk  Mitigating Measures \nExtreme events (such as  Adaptation or resilience measures to protect the investments from pre-\nflash floods) delay  identified  risks  will  be  incorporated  into  the  project  design.

The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in the PAM and loan \ndocuments. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR6,868,000 (footnote 22) to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Secondary \nTowns Urban Development Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter, for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \n \npresented to the Board.\n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n28 May 2018\n                                                \n33  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \n \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nBalanced and sustainable development of human settlements in Samdrup Jongkhar, Sarpang, and \nTrashigang ensured (Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2013\u20132018)a  \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nQuality,  By 2024:      \nefficiency, and  Samdrup Jongkhar, Sarpang, and  a\u2013b and d\u2013e.
