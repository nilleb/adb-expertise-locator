First is that the pace of urban infrastructure development and basic services have \nfallen  short  of  the  growing  demand,  resulting  in  a  deficit  of  urban  infrastructure  and  the \ndeterioration of basic urban services.  Second is the unbalanced growth, predominantly around \ntwo cities that account for 40% of Bhutan\u2019s urban population: Thimphu, the country\u2019s capital city; \nand Phuentsholing, the main trading gateway with India. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nbeen supporting Bhutan\u2019s urban development since 1983 and much of the assistance since 1998 \nhas focused on developing Thimphu and Phuentsholing.4 ADB\u2019s timely support in these two cities \nhas  prevented  urban  sprawl,  encouraged  planned  urban  expansion,  introduced  land  pooling,5 \nenhanced livability, improved connectivity, and boosted growth. \n \nThe growth of Bhutan\u2019s secondary towns is constrained by deficiencies in infrastructure \n4. \nand basic urban services resulting from inadequate urban planning, weak urban institutions and \nmunicipal  finances,  limited  budgetary  support,  and  limited  local  capabilities  for  urban \ninfrastructure development. Water supply service in the majority of secondary towns is intermittent \nfor 2\u201312 hours daily. Without a continuous water supply, it is difficult to assess nonrevenue water \nbut estimates suggest the range to be 30%\u201355%.6 Water tariffs cover only about 20% of the O&M \n\n                                                \n1  The project preparation was supported by technical assistance: Asian Development Bank (ADB).

Under  the  Land  Pooling  Rules  of  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  (2009),  the  contribution  ratio  from \nlandowners should not exceed 30% of their original property area.  \n\n6  ADB. 2016. Sector Assessment Report. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila (TA 8551-BHU). \n \n\n \n\n\fcosts of water supply. Less than half of secondary towns have a piped sewerage system (footnote \n6). The government is concerned about this unbalanced urbanization.7 \n \n5. \nTo  enable  balanced  and  equitable  growth,  the  government\u2019s  strategy  for  urban \ndevelopment  (footnote  7)  aims  to  foster  secondary  towns  into  regional  growth  centers  by \ndeveloping  trade,  transport,  logistics,  and  manufacturing.8 Medium-scale  industries  are  being \nestablished along the regional centers in southern Bhutan that border India, including Samdrup \nJongkhar  and  Sarpang,  both  of  which  are  secondary  towns  identified  as  growth  centers.  The \nsecondary towns need substantial urban infrastructure improvements to realize the government\u2019s \nvision.  The  project  is  designed  to  complement  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  develop  secondary \ntowns to ensure Bhutan\u2019s balanced urbanization. \n \nThe project will support infrastructure development and institutional strengthening in three \n6. \nimportant secondary towns\u2014Samdrup Jongkhar and Sarpang in the southern border region of \nBhutan,  which  are  planned  as  growth  centers  with  high  economic  potential  (para.  5);  and \nTrashigang, the largest urban center in eastern Bhutan, which has gained importance with the \nopening  in  2017  of  the  Yonphula  airport,  which  was  supported  by  ADB.9 These  towns  were \nselected for their strategic economic importance.  \n \n7. \nSamdrup  Jongkhar  and  Sarpang  will  host  two  of  the  four  industrial  estates  being \ndeveloped by the government to promote manufacturing and create jobs.10 Samdrup Jongkhar, a \ngateway  town  to  India\u2019s  Assam  state,  is  a  key  border  town  in  the  South  Asia  Association  for \nRegional  Cooperation  road  corridor  5.11 It  is  located  8  kilometers  (km)  from  the  58.7  hectare \nMotanga industrial estate, which has capacity for 20 heavy manufacturing units. Sarpang, also \nlocated  close  to  the  Assam  border,  is  16  km  from  the  306-hectare  Jigmeling  industrial  estate \n(footnote 10). Trashigang\u2019s recent access to air connectivity and strategic location on the east\u2013\nwest  highway  makes  it  an  important  tourist  gateway  to  the  less-explored  eastern  Bhutan.  In \npreparation for the changes that will come with these strategic developments, these towns are \nalready undertaking planned urban expansions, including the development of a new satellite town \nin Sarpang.12  \n \n8. \nThere is a need to improve basic urban services and expand infrastructure in the newly \nplanned  town  extensions  to  meet  the  specific  needs.  Residents  of  Samdrup  Jongkhar  and \nSarpang get less than 8 hours water supply per day, while residents of Trashigang have adequate \nwater supply but are affected by poor water quality and more than 40% nonrevenue water losses. \nSamdrup Jongkhar, which is the largest of the three project towns, needs to extend its sewerage \n\n                                                \n7  Government of Bhutan, Ministry of Works and Human Settlements. 2008.

These  estates  are  Jigmeling  in \nSarpang, Motanga in Samdrup Jongkhar, Dhamdum in Samtse, and Bondeyma in Mongar.

The local governments were \nclosely involved in project preparation ensuring that the solutions were tailor-made to the unique \ncontext of each town.14 \n \n9. \nStrategic context. The project is aligned with the government\u2019s Eleventh Five-Year Plan, \n2013\u20132018,  which  focuses  on  balanced  and  sustainable  urban  development  of  human \nsettlements.15 It is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for Bhutan, which \nidentifies  inclusive economic growth as  a key  strategic  pillar;  and  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country \noperations business plan for Bhutan, 2018\u20132020.16 It will contribute to Sustainable Development \nGoals 6 (ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all) and 11 \n(making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable). \n \n10. \nLessons.  The  project  incorporates  the  following  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  previous  urban \ndevelopment  operations  in  Bhutan:  (i)  strengthen  municipal  capacities  in  O&M  and  asset \nmanagement, (ii) ensure high project readiness for timely start of construction activities, and (iii) \nsupport infrastructure investments in planned town extensions to prevent urban sprawl.17  \n \n11. \nValue addition. The project will deepen regional economic cooperation by complementing \nthe government\u2019s investments in two growth center towns bordering India, and support one town \nwith high tourism potential in the poorer eastern region. The project will support proactive, planned \nurbanization through infrastructure investments in planned town expansions, including enabling \nthe  development  of  Sarpang\u2019s  satellite  town,  for  which  land  was  made  available  through  land \npooling. The project will also complement ongoing infrastructure developments being undertaken \nby the government and ADB in the three towns.18 To ensure operational sustainability, the project \nwill  support  municipal  capacity  building  for  the  management  and  O&M  of  urban  infrastructure \nassets  (including  nonrevenue  water  reduction)  and  develop  a  staged  water  tariff  framework  to \nenable regular tariff increases.19 Nonrevenue water will be significantly reduced through metering, \npressure  management,  and  training.  Targeted  community  initiatives  such  as  water,  sanitation, \nhygiene behavior change, communication, and increasing women\u2019s role in project activities will \ncomplement institutional strengthening.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n13  Due to low population densities, piped sewerage is not recommended in Sarpang and extension areas of Trashigang, \n\nwhere appropriate septage management is practiced.  \n\n14 Sarpang  and  Trashigang  do  not  have  municipal  governments  and  fall  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  respective \n\ndzongkhags (district administration). Samdrup Jongkhar has its own municipal government (thromde).  \n\n15 Government  of  Bhutan,  Gross  National  Happiness  Commission.  2013.  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan  (2013\u20132018). \n\nThimphu.

The sewerage \nnetwork  investments  in  Samdrup  Jongkhar  will  complement  government\u2019s  ongoing  investments  in  waste  water \ntreatment.  In  Trashigang  and  Sarpang,  the  loan  will  complement  the  government\u2019s  recent  investments  in  water \ntreatment. \n\n19 In  Bhutan,  water  supply  and sewerage  services  are maintained by  the  town  administrations.  Tariff increases  are \n\napproved by the Ministry of Finance. As of May 2018, no guidelines exist for tariff preparation and approvals. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nB. \n \n12. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: balanced and sustainable development of \nhuman settlements in Samdrup Jongkhar, Sarpang, and Trashigang ensured (footnote 15). The \nproject  will  have the following  outcome: quality, efficiency,  and sustainability  of  urban  services \nimproved.  \n \nC. \n \n13. \nOutput 1: Urban infrastructure expanded and/or upgraded. The project will support (i) \nconstruction  of  46.8  km  of  new  water  transmission  lines,  36.7  km  of  new  water  distribution \npipelines, and upgrading of 2.5 km of existing water transmission pipelines; (ii) construction of six \nnew  ground-level  service  reservoirs  with  total  storage  capacity  of  1,300  cubic  meters;  (iii) \nconstruction of two new water intake structures with 3.5 million liters per day (MLD) capacity; (iv) \ncommissioning  of one  new  water  treatment  plant   with 1.2  MLD  capacity  and augmenting  one \nwater treatment plant from 0.6 MLD to 1.0 MLD capacity; (v) provision of 800 new metered water \nsupply  connections  (685  residential  connections  and  115  institutional  connections);  (vi) \nconstruction of 2.5 km of sewage collection pipelines with 250 new connections (210 residential \nconnections and 40 institutional connections); and (vii) provision of 9 km of new and improved \ndrains  and  3.74  km  of  new  roads  in  Sarpang.  Features  of  the  subprojects  include  improving \nservices  in  existing  town  areas,  expanding  service  coverage  to  the  recently  planned  town \nextensions,  enhancing  climate  resilience  of  facilities, 20  and  completing  water  supply  and \nsewerage infrastructure in Samdrup Jongkhar, building on the ongoing ADB loan and government \ninterventions (footnote 18).  \n \nOutput 2: Capacity of institutions and local communities strengthened. This includes \n14. \n(i)  developing  a  staged  water  tariff  framework  for  the  three  project  towns;  (ii)  conducting \nawareness-raising  campaigns  for  at  least  3,500  people  (40%  women)  on  gender  and  public \nhealth-related  issues  such  as  water  conservation;  solid-waste  segregation  and  reduction;  and \nwater,  sanitation,  and  hygiene;  (iii)  improving  knowledge  and  skills  on  O&M  and  asset \nmanagement  of  municipal  infrastructure  for  50  staff  (at  least  25%  women)  from  the  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU),  project  implementation  units,  and  other  municipal  units;  and  (iv) \nmonitoring project gender equality results through the gender equality monitoring system of the \nNational Commission for Women and Children. \n \nD. \n \n15. \nexpenditure category and by financier are in the project administration manual (PAM).21 \n \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $12  million  (Table  1).

Technical aspects \nwere appraised based on (i) relevance, benefits, proposed designs, ease of implementation, and \ncost-effective  operations;  (ii)  most  cost-effective  technical  process;  (iii)  full  lifecycle  costs;  (iv) \nmaximizing  coverage  area;  (v)  minimizing  adverse  environmental  and  social  impacts;  and  (vi) \noptimal  timelines  for  implementation  through  high  project  readiness.  The  detailed  designs  are \ntailored to enable seamless integration of the new infrastructure with existing facilities, considering \nleast lifecycle cost of the entire system and use of relatively simple maintenance methods. The \nworks  are  small  and  standard,  and  the  country  has  sufficient  capacity  for  their  execution.  The \ndetailed  designs  will  address  flood  and  landslide  risks  associated  with  increased  precipitation \nbecause of climate change (footnote 20). The deployment of full-time site engineers through the \nproject management and supervision consultant will ensure timely and quality construction.  \n \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nB. \n \n21. \nEconomic analysis. The economic internal rates of return of subprojects range from 9.2% \nto 21.0%, with the combined economic internal rate of return calculated at 15.3%, which is higher \nthan the economic opportunity cost of capital of 9.0%, indicating significant economic returns. The \nanalysis captured the value added from improved water supply and sanitation resulting in health \nbenefits  and  saved  resources  for  the  beneficiaries  in  the  three  towns.  The  sensitivity  analysis \nrevealed  that  the  results  are  also  satisfactory  against  all  downside  risks,  i.e.,  (i)  a  capital  cost \noverrun of 20%, (ii) an overrun in O&M costs of 20%, (iii) a decline in estimated benefits of 20%, \n(iv) a 1-year delay of implementation, and (v) all downside risks combined.25 \n \n22. \nFinancial analysis. The financial analysis assessed whether the project towns can cover \nthe  incremental  and  recurrent  costs  of  the  proposed  project,  since  all  the  subprojects  are \nestimated  not  to  generate  sufficient  revenues  to  cover  the  full  costs,  including  capital  and \noperation expenditures. The overall municipal financial position is projected reflecting incremental \nrevenues  and  expenditures  as  well  as  debt  service  requirements  based  on  past  performance, \ngrowth  trend  of  revenue  streams,  and  expected  population  growth.  The  annual  average \nincremental recurrent costs of the project are estimated to represent about 5% of the maintenance \nbudget of project towns. The government has also committed to providing adequate funds toward \nthe  O&M  of  project  facilities  through  budgetary  allocations  or  other  means.  The  financial \nprojections of the towns demonstrate that, by improving collection efficiency, rationalizing tariffs, \nand continuing the government\u2019s financial support, the revenue accounts will remain in surplus.26 \n \nC. \n \n23. \nfinancial  management  assessment,  procurement \nassessment, and the assessment of the anticorruption policy conducted for the Ministry of Works \nand  Human  Settlements  (MOWHS)  identified  no  major  issues.  The  financial  management \nassessment  concluded  that  the  MOWHS  could  undertake  the  financial  management  of  ADB-\nfinanced projects. The overall financial management risk assessment for the project is moderate \nas the MOWHS has experience in handling ADB- and World Bank-funded projects of substantial \nvalue. In addition, the MOWHS has an established legal, institutional, and monitoring framework \navailable  for  budgeting,  accounting,  and  auditing.  The  risk  mitigation  measures  include  (i) \nstrengthening the accounts and finance divisions of the PMU by engaging qualified staff for the \ntimely preparation of financial reports, (ii) procuring a suitable accounting package for establishing \nbetter reporting and monitoring systems, (iii) training PMU staff on project financial management, \nand  (iv)  effectively  implementing  the  systematic  plans  of  the  MOWHS  and  project  towns  for \nenhancing revenues and reducing costs.  \n \n24. \nProcurement. The procurement classification is B. Procurement will be undertaken at the \nexecuting agency level. The procurement risk assessment concluded that the overall procurement \nrisk  for  the  project  is  moderate,  highlighting  the  need  for  procurement  training  and  additional \nassistance  through  consultants.  To  address  these  issues,  the  project  management  and \nsupervision consultants will provide support to the PMU and conduct regular procurement training \nsessions to improve procurement capacity.  \n \n25. \nAnticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  MOWHS.  The  specific  policy \n\nFinancial  management.

The mitigation measures \nin the project design require the PMU to establish (i) a project website for transparency in project \nimplementation and safeguards, and (ii) a grievance redress system for handling complaints. \n \nD. \n \n26. \nThe  poverty  rate  in  the  three  towns  is  14.8%,  higher  than  the  national  poverty  rate  of \n8.2%.27 The  satellite  areas  of  the  towns  have  lower  access  to  basic  services  and  economic \nopportunities  as  well  as  lower  household  incomes  (around  60%  of  the  average  household \nincomes in the main town). Lack of access to reliable and quality services, time spent on water \ncollection, and the burden of waterborne disease are some of the key issues that affect the poor. \nThe  project\u2019s  pro-poor  design  features  include  (i)  providing  improved  water  supply  including \nmetered  connections  in  all  the  three  towns  (covering  all  poor  and  vulnerable  households), \nbenefitting  18,500  people  (including  8,917  women);  (ii)  providing  piped  sewerage  collection \nsystems  in  new  town  extension  areas  of  Samdrup  Jogkhar  (covering  all  poor  and  vulnerable \nhouseholds), benefitting 3,500 people (including 1,687 women); (iii) preparing tariff guidelines to \nensure lifeline tariffs and possible cross-subsidies for the poor; and (iv) generating jobs for skilled \nand  unskilled  labor,  including  the  poor,  vulnerable  groups,  and  women,  during  construction. \nCompliance with host country core labor standards has been included in the loan agreement and \nbidding documents.  \n \n27. \nGender. The project is categorized as \u201ceffective gender mainstreaming.\u201d Poor households \nheaded by women comprise about 3.5% of the population, with the major issue facing women \nbeing time poverty because of the burden of water collection and maintaining household hygiene. \nThe  gender  action  plan  addresses  these  issues  and  is  designed  with  clear  targets, \nresponsibilities,  and  allocation  of  resources. 28  Gender  design  features  include  (i)  increasing \nwomen\u2019s  access  to  safe  water  and  sanitation,  thereby  reducing  time  poverty;  (ii)  awareness-\nraising  campaigns  for  water  conservation,  solid-waste  reduction  and  segregation,  and  water, \nsanitation,  and  hygiene  to  target  at  least  3,500  people  (40%  women);  (iii)  including  women  in \nproject  management  and  municipal  trainings;  (iv)  capacity  building  on  gender  for  project \nstakeholders;  (v)  conducting  sample  impact  evaluation  to  assess  women\u2019s  satisfaction  with \nimproved services; and (vi) project gender reporting through the national gender reporting system.  \n \nE. \n \n28. \nEnvironment. The project is categorized B for the environment in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). The project involves the construction and/or upgrade of water \ntreatment plants, water transmission and distribution networks, a sewerage network, urban roads, \nand drainage. The project components do not pass through environmentally sensitive areas, and \nno  significant  and \ninitial \nenvironmental  examination  reports  including  environmental  management  plans  were  prepared \nbased  on  detailed  designs  and  preliminary  designs  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website. 29 \nAnticipated  environmental  impacts  during  implementation  include  construction-related  issues \nsuch  as  dust,  noise,  waste  from  construction  and  worker  camps,  traffic  congestion,  erosion, \nsiltation,  and  occupational  health  and  safety  issues.  Key  operational  impacts  include  health \nhazards because of poor water quality, increased generation of sewage and sullage because of \n                                                \n27 ADB. 2016.

The  project \n\nenhanced water supply, and the need to dispose of waste from filter beds in treatment plants. To \naddress  these  impacts,  the  project  design  includes  adequate  water  monitoring  guidelines  and \nmethods for safe disposal of waste. The environmental management plans\u2014which are part of the \nbidding document and mandatory for the contractors\u2014include mitigation measures to address all \nconstruction- and operation-related impacts. The draft initial environmental examinations will be \nupdated  and  finalized  based  on  detailed  engineering  designs  and  alignments  and  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB for disclosure. \n \ninvoluntary \n29. \nresettlement. The project will not result in physical and economic displacement. One resettlement \nplan and three due diligence reports were prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement  (2009),  and  will  be  updated  after  detailed  measurement  surveys  are  completed.30 \nInvoluntary resettlement impacts of the project have been adequately assessed and the proposed \nmitigation measures are adequate. The resettlement impacts include tree and/or crop loss for up \nto  19  agricultural  landholders  for  the  laying  of  about  2  km  of  water  transmission  pipelines  in \nSarpang.  Land  for  development  of  basic  services  in  the  Sarpang  satellite  town  was  acquired \nthrough land pooling initiated in 2011, wherein 93 landowners donated their land in exchange for \ndevelopment  of  basic  urban  services. Land  pooling  was not  undertaken  in anticipation  of  ADB \nfinancing.31 The  due  diligence  process  (including  a  third-party  independent  assessor\u2019s  report) \nconfirms that there was no asymmetry in information availability, land inclusive of nonland assets \nwas voluntarily pooled, no coercion was involved, and the process was undertaken in a fair and \ntransparent manner. Compensation for nonland assets was paid in line with government policy. \nThe  safeguard  documents  are  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  and  information  shared  with  the \naffected people.  \n \n30. \nProject preparation included meaningful and widespread consultation, and the concerns \nof affected people and stakeholders have been incorporated into the project design. Consultation \nwith  all  communities  in  the  project  area  will  continue  during  implementation,  and  a  grievance \nredress  mechanism  will  be  established.  The  executing  agency  is  familiar  with  ADB  safeguard \npolicies,  having  previously  implemented  two  ADB-funded  projects  and  currently  implementing \nanother  ADB  urban  project  in Thimphu,  Phuentsholing,  and  Samdrup  Jongkhar  (footnote  4).
