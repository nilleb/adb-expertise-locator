I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $100,000,000 to Yoma Strategic Holdings (YSH) for the Connectivity Infrastructure \nDevelopment Project in Myanmar.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Myanmar is in the middle of a dynamic economic and social transition. Since its opening \nto the outside world, and following the progress of various political and economic reforms, the \ncountry has been experiencing rapid economic growth, which was estimated at 7.5% in fiscal \nyear 2013 (ended 31 March 2014) and is expected to grow by 7.8% per year in fiscal years \n2014 and 2015.2 However, after decades of international isolation, economic stagnation, and \nresulting underinvestment, Myanmar has grossly underdeveloped infrastructure and run-down \n(or nonexistent) facilities, and the country\u2019s growth potential has not been fully exploited as a \nresult. \n \n3.  In particular, Myanmar remains one of the least-connected countries in the world in \nterms of telecommunication, transportation, and logistics. In 2012, fixed line penetration stood at \napproximately 1%, mobile penetration at 7%, and internet penetration at less than 1% of the \npopulation.3 In a country with 676,000 square kilometers of land area, there are only 33,000 \nkilometers of paved roads, which translates into the road density of less than one-fifth of the \naverage of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries. While the number of vehicles \ngrew  at  a  constant  annual  growth  rate  of  about  18%  during  2004\u20132013,  the  number  of \nregistered vehicles in Myanmar was 3.6 million in 2013, or 70 vehicles per 1,000 people, which \nis relatively low compared to Thailand (250 vehicles per 1,000 people) and Indonesia (370 \nvehicles per 1,000 people). Inland waterways in Myanmar play an important role for freight \ntraffic, with 5 million tons transported along these waterways in 2011 thanks to the established \nnetwork along the Ayeyarwaddy and Chidwin rivers and underdeveloped land transportation.4 \nHowever,  the  vessels  and  ports  are  old,  resulting  in  an  underutilized  and  malfunctioning \nnetwork. \n  \n4.  Better  connectivity  infrastructure  contributes  to  sustainable  economic  growth  by \nfacilitating access to better economic opportunities and by improving the productivity of many \nsectors.5 A nationwide mobile network would be inclusive since people in remote areas would \nhave  access  to  market  information  and  other  opportunities,  which  would  remove  market \ninefficiencies and result in welfare benefits for them.6 It is estimated that a 10% increase in \nmobile penetration would raise gross domestic product by 1.2% (footnote 3). Development of \ntransport and logistics infrastructure would enable farmers and other producers to broaden their \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2014.

Investment in connectivity infrastructure is therefore a key factor in giving \npeople and goods better access to more opportunities and markets, reducing transportation and \nother transaction costs, promoting domestic and international trade, and attracting investors into \ndiverse geographic areas and sectors. Furthermore, Myanmar could potentially benefit from a \n\u201cgreenfield\u201d  advantage  (i.e.,  it  is  unencumbered  by  investments  in  earlier  technologies), \nmeaning it can immediately adopt more cost-effective, sustainable infrastructure. The caveat is \nthat the government lacks the budget and capacity to undertake projects in various connectivity \nsectors  at  once,  which  is  necessary  to  meet  Myanmar\u2019s  enormous  infrastructure  needs.7 \nTherefore, the role of the private sector is crucial to successfully address the connectivity \nbottlenecks. \n \n5.  Against this backdrop, an increasing number of private sector connectivity infrastructure \nopportunities are emerging, including  in telecommunications, transport, logistics, agriculture \nvalue chain, and related support infrastructure. However, private sector financing for these \nopportunities remains a major challenge for the following reasons: (i) many of these projects are \neither too small for complex project finance structuring in an untested legal environment in \nMyanmar, and/or are perceived to be too risky to finance on a standalone basis; (ii) the banking \nsector and capital market in Myanmar are highly underdeveloped, meaning (a) local banks do \nnot have the skills or capacity to finance such projects, and (b) project promoters do not have \naccess  to  alternative  funding  sources;  (iii)  although  Myanmar  is  experiencing  an  influx  of \ninvestors, investments have been concentrated in the oil, gas, and other mineral sectors, as well \nas  light  manufacturing;  and  (iv)  few  international  investors  have  the  necessary  in-depth \nunderstanding to structure and implement local connectivity infrastructure projects, while most \nlocal investors lack the financial and managerial capacities to undertake such projects. \n \n6.  YSH  has  been  identified  as  a  sound  partner  to fill this gap.  As  a  Singapore-listed \ncompany focusing on Myanmar and led by Serge Pun, a reputable Myanmar entrepreneur, YSH \nhas  become  a  preferred  business  partner  for  major  multinational  corporations  including \nMitsubishi, Sumitomo, Case New Holland, and Digicel Group. Through its work with various \nrenowned international partners, YSH has emerged as a potential aggregator of the connectivity \nsubprojects, which will also enable them to diversify the risks of individual subprojects. Since \nlong-term commercial debt, which is necessary to undertake such connectivity infrastructure \nprojects, remains extremely scarce in Myanmar, YSH has requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to consider extending assistance. In addition to ADB\u2019s direct contribution through \nfinancing the project, ADB\u2019s involvement and presence are expected to catalyze commercial \ndebt funding to both YSH and to individual subprojects. \n \n2.  Project Design \n7.  The  project  will  support  YSH\u2019s  long-term  investments  in  connectivity  infrastructure \nsubprojects  in  Myanmar  to  advance  inclusion  of  isolated  people,  reduce  urban\u2013rural \ndevelopment gaps, and attract private investment into diverse geographic areas and sectors. \nDevelopment of connectivity infrastructure contributes to these objectives by (i) giving people \nand goods better access to more opportunities and markets, (ii) improving productivity through \nreduction of transport and other transaction costs, and (iii) promoting domestic and international \ntrade. \n \n                                                \n7  It is estimated that total investment gaps for infrastructure could be as much as $80 billion from 2014 to 2030.

YSH  intends  to  significantly  increase  its  presence  in  the  connectivity  infrastructure \nsectors such as transport, telecommunications, and logistics, both in terms of asset base and \nsales.  The  projects  ADB  will  initially  support  are  described  in  Table  1  and  paras,  9\u201311. \nSubsequently, ADB will support further subprojects that meet eligibility criteria as YSH secures \nnew  connectivity  subprojects  in  transportation,  distribution  and  logistics,  agricultural  value \nchains, or international education, in addition to the subprojects mentioned in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Summary of Yoma Strategic Holdings\u2019 Connectivity Subprojects \nSubproject  Project Description  Partner \nTelecom towers  Construction and leasing of telecom towers  Digicel Group \nCold storage logistics   Construction of warehouses, development of  Kokubu & Co.

In the telecommunications sector, YSH has partnered with Digicel \nGroup and established Myanmar Tower Company (MTC) to build telecom towers in Myanmar. \nDigicel  Group  is  a  global  telecom  operator  that  operates  in  the  Caribbean,  Pacific  island \ncountries, and other developing countries. MTC has signed agreements with Ooredoo, one of \nthe two telecom license winners, to provide 1,250 towers initially. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n  \n10.  Cold storage logistics. YSH and First Myanmar Investment (FMI)8 have established \nKOSPA Cold Chain Logistics (KCCL), a joint venture with Kokubu & Co., Ltd.

It has overseas presence in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) and Viet Nam.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n11.  Fleet  leasing.  YSH  has  established  a  logistics  fleet  company,  Yoma  Fleet,  in \npartnership with FMI to address the shortage of trucks, tractors, and other logistics vehicles. \nMyanmar\u2019s freight transport market has been characterized by an old, inefficient fleet. However, \nas the government lifted the restrictions on the import of modern trucks, the fleet is modernizing, \ncreating huge business opportunities and bringing substantial benefits to various sectors.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n3.  The Borrower \n12.  The  borrower  will  be  YSH,  a  Singapore-listed  company  with  property,  agriculture, \ntourism, and automobile dealership businesses in Myanmar. YSH was listed on the main board \nof the Singapore Exchange in 2006 and has a current market capitalization of over $632 million \nequivalent.9 YSH was founded by Serge Pun, who is the chairman. A Myanmar national with a \nsuccessful  business  track  record  across  Asia,  Serge  Pun  is  considered  to  have  a  solid \n                                                \n8  FMI is a Myanmar public company that is majority owned by Serge Pun. Established in 1992, FMI is a diversified \ncompany  with  a  core  focus  in  property  development  followed  by  automotive,  services  (e.g.,  healthcare), \nbanking,agriculture, retail, and tourism. As a Myanmar public company, FMI has a broad local shareholder base of \nmore than 6,000. While YSH is an international flagship company  with international shareholders  to make \ninvestments in Myanmar, FMI is a local vehicle of Serge Pun with local shareholders. YSH often makes co-\ninvestments with FMI because of this association. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n9  As of 10 October 2014. \n ", "4 \n \nreputation  which  has  led  to  YSH\u2019s  business  partnerships  in  Myanmar  with  renowned \nmultinational corporations. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n  \n13.  YSH is led by a team of international management professionals and is known for its \ngood corporate governance systems and practices, including (i) a board of directors with a \nmajority of independent directors; (ii) a clearly set-out code of conduct; (iii) an audit committee, \nnominating committee, and remuneration committee comprised solely of independent directors; \nand  (iv)  well-established  whistleblower  and  internal  control  systems,  evidenced  by  YSH\u2019s \nranking in the top 5% of Singapore Exchange-listed companies in the 2014 Governance & \nTransparency Index.10 \n \n14.  Aside from Serge Pun, no YSH shareholder owns 10% or more shares.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n15.  Successful implementation of the project will contribute to (i) increased domestic trade; \n(ii) increased labor productivity,  because of the increased share of secondary and tertiary \nsectors increase, which have higher productivity than the primary sector; and (iii) increased \nforeign direct investment, in Myanmar. \n \n2.  Outcome \n16.  The project\u2019s expected outcome will be improved connectivity of people and goods in \nMyanmar. The first three subprojects to be supported by the ADB facility will result in (i) an \nincrease in the number of mobile subscribers, (ii) transportation of perishable goods through \nimproved cold chain logistics, and (iii) high utilization of logistics fleets. \n \n3.  Outputs \n17.  The project\u2019s outputs are (i) the successful completion of initial investments (paras. 8\u2013\n11) by 2017,11 and (ii) the establishment of an environmental and social management system \n(ESMS) and implementation of project-level safeguard plans in compliance with ADB safeguard \npolicies. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n18.  Consistency with Midterm Review of Strategy 2020. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which identifies inclusive growth and infrastructure \ndevelopment as two of the four strategic priorities to sharpen ADB\u2019s operational focus.12 The \nproject is fully in line with the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020\u2019s emphasis on private sector \noperations in Asian Development Fund-recipient countries, and expanding connectivity. \n \n                                                \n10 YSH was ranked 26th out of the 644 listed companies on the Singapore Exchange.

The  project  is  also  aligned  with \nADB\u2019s interim country partnership strategy for Myanmar, 2012\u20132014, which places importance \non  enhancing  connectivity.13 The  project  addresses  the  critical  shortage  of  connectivity, \npromotes access to markets and basic social services, improves rural infrastructure to boost \nproductivity and incomes, lowers transaction costs, enhances opportunities for domestic and \ncross-border trade and investment, and improves access to reliable and sustainable utility \nservices.  The  project  will  also  complement  various  projects  being  processed  by  ADB\u2019s \nSoutheast Asia Department, including several road projects and technical assistance projects.14  \nSince Myanmar was long isolated from regional and international markets, a combination of \nsovereign  and  nonsovereign  connectivity  projects  to  strengthen  the  country\u2019s  capacity  to \ncompete will be critical in supporting Myanmar's reintegration with its regional neighbors. \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n20.  ADB\u2019s  corporate  loan  to  YSH  will  be  directed  to  several  connectivity  infrastructure \nsubprojects and is composed of two tranches amounting up to $50 million each. \n \n21.  The project cost for the first tranche comprises investments in the telecom sector to be \nundertaken by MTC, cold storage logistics by KCCL, and fleet leasing by Yoma Fleet.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n22.  The  project  cost  for  the  second  tranche  comprises  investments  in  connectivity \nsubprojects in transportation, fleet leasing, telecommunication towers, distribution and logistics, \nagricultural value chains, or international education.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n \nE.

ADB\u2019s proposed assistance is a direct loan to YSH of up to $100 million, comprising two \ntranches.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n25.  ADB\u2019s participation in the project will add substantial value in the following ways: \n(i)  ADB\u2019s assistance will be critical, as the financial market in Myanmar is shallow, \nand debt financing is extremely scarce from local banks and from international \nbanks.  Local  banks  currently  lack  the  financial  and  technical  capacities  to \nundertake large and long-term financing. \n(ii)  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  support  development  of  much-needed  connectivity \ninfrastructure to help reduce transportation and other transaction costs, improve \nproductivity, and enhance access to opportunity and services that will effectively \ncontribute to sustainable economic growth and poverty alleviation objectives. \n(iii)  The project structure will enable ADB to extend its reach to multiple connectivity \nsubprojects that would be difficult to assist directly. \n(iv)  ADB\u2019s  substantial  participation  will  signal  to  the  Government  of  Myanmar, \nmultinationals, and international financiers that private sector-led infrastructure \ninvestments can be undertaken successfully and sustained in Myanmar under \nsectors  that  implement  sound  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  and/or  are \nfounded on the principles of transparent and competitive bidding procedures. \n  \nC.  Risks \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n26.  The project is processed as general corporate finance, with ADB funds expected to be \nallocated for  implementing  YSH\u2019s  connectivity  infrastructure  projects.  Telecom towers,  cold \nstorage logistics, and fleet leasing subprojects will be taken up in the first tranche. In addition, \nconnectivity subprojects in transport, agribusiness, and education sectors are likely to be taken \nup in the second tranche. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the \nproject is classified category B for environment, category B for involuntary resettlement, and \ncategory C for indigenous peoples. The potential environmental and social  impacts of the \nproject  have  been  identified  and  effective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and \ncompensate for the adverse impacts will be incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. In \naddition to compliance with the safeguard requirements for individual subprojects, YSH and the \nproject companies under which the specific connectivity subprojects will be undertaken will \nestablish and maintain an ESMS to screen, assess, and address environmental and social ", "77  \n \nimpacts and risks meeting the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, including the \nsubmission and review of safeguards documents. The borrower is committed to implement \nenvironmental and social safeguards in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement on \nsubprojects funded directly by it or through its subsidiaries. \n \n27.  Proposed  infrastructure  will  not  be  located  within  the  boundaries  or  traversing \nenvironmentally sensitive areas such as protected areas, wetlands, or historical or cultural site. \nPotential impacts during construction (e.g., noise, soil erosion, air, and water pollution) can be \nmitigated, and are short-term and temporary. Potential residual impacts during operation (e.g., \nvisual; pollution of land and water from hazardous materials and wastes; occupational and \ncommunity health and safety, including electromagnetic exposure) can also be mitigated using \ntested  mitigation  measures. The  building  of  telecom towers  and  the  cold  storage  logistics \nfacilities  will  be  carried  out  by  the  project  companies  on  lands  to  be  leased  from  willing \nlandowners on a long-term basis. The site selection criteria and processes by the project \ncompanies exclude sites with landowners who are not willing to enter into leases or lands with \npotential  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples. Involuntary  resettlement  impacts  and  impacts  on \nindigenous peoples are not envisaged with respect to the building of telecom towers and cold \nstorage facilities. For government lands allotted for locating facilities, YSH and the project \ncompanies will assess and address any compliance gaps pertaining to involuntary resettlement \nimpacts  in  line  with  ESMS  provisions  and  ADB  requirements.  Information  disclosure  and \nconsultations will be carried out in accordance with ADB requirements.15 \n \n28.  A corporate audit was conducted on YSH\u2019s ESMS. The audit identified corrective actions \nrequired  to  ensure  compliance  of  the  ESMS  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nrequirements. The corrective actions have been discussed and agreed upon with YSH. The key \ncorrective actions include (i) enhancing YSH\u2019s corporate ESMS to meet ADB requirements and \ndeveloping entity-level environmental and social procedures for the three project companies; (ii) \nformalizing  a  procedure  for  screening,  scoping,  and  categorizing  projects  and  undertaking \nappropriate  environmental  and  social  assessment;  (iii)  developing  stakeholder  engagement \nplans and establishing a grievance redress mechanism for the project companies; (iv) providing \nspecific occupational health and safety and community health and safety strategies for the \nproject  companies;  and  (v)  incorporating  in  the  corporate  ESMS  a  policy  statement  and \nprocedures for addressing impacts on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. YSH \ncommits to have a Safeguard Policy Statement-compliant ESMS that is satisfactory to ADB in \nplace  prior  to  the  first  disbursement.  YSH  will  submit  annual  environmental  and  social \nmonitoring  reports  on  the  implementation  of  its  ESMS  and  the  subprojects,  including  the \nimplementation of corrective actions in the audit report. In addition, safeguard documents for the \nsubprojects  in  line  with  the  ESMS  requirements  will  be  prepared  for  the  connectivity \ninfrastructure subprojects to be taken up. \n \n29.  The project is classified as having some gender elements, and the borrower commits to \n(i) prioritizing women for at least 40% of construction-related jobs created, and (ii) hiring at least \n30%  women  employees  for  employment  requirements  in  the  connectivity  subprojects.  In \naddition, YSH\u2019s human resources policies promote equal opportunities for women and ensure \nthat the rights of women are protected. YSH will comply with ADB's Social Protection Strategy \nand report regularly to ADB on compliance (including compliance by contractors) with national \nlabor laws and adherence to internationally recognized core labor standards.16 \n \n                                                \n15 Entity-level environmental and social procedures for the other connectivity sectors, in line with the ESMS of YSH, \nwill be prepared and approved by ADB prior to the second tranche disbursement. \n16 ADB. 2003.
