THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed debt \ninvestment of senior unsecured nonconvertible debentures up to $75,000,000 (in Indian rupee \nequivalent) in Au Financiers (India) Limited (AUF) for the Expanding Micro, Small, and Medium-\nSized Enterprises Lending in Semi-Urban and Rural Areas Project in India.1 At least 50% of \nfunding of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be deployed in less-developed states.2 \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  Financial sector overview. The Indian financial sector is still developing with banks \ndominating the sector. As of the end of FY2016 (FYE2016), there were 216 banks, including 149 \nscheduled commercial banks. Total deposits of all banks stood at Rs99.3 trillion as of FYE2016 \nand total loans outstanding amounted to Rs77.2 trillion.3 As of FYE2016, 11,682 nonbank finance \ncompanies (NBFCs) were registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), with total loans \noutstanding  of  Rs13.0  trillion.4 Gross  nonperforming  assets  (NPAs) for  the  banking  sector \n(according to the RBI\u2019s definition) worsened from 3.5% in FY2013 to 4.6% in FY2015 and 7.6% \nin FY2016 as a result of difficulties experienced in certain sectors (e.g., power, iron, and steel) \nand the adoption by RBI of stricter policies in recognizing problem loans. However, loans \nundergoing restructuring decreased from 5.5% in FY2013 to 3.9% in FY2016, due to changes in \nRBI's guidelines, which made it more difficult for banks to restructure loans. The capital adequacy \nratio of the banking sector declined from 14.0% in FY2013 to 13.2% in FY2016. Profitability in the \nbanking sector also declined, as evidenced by the reduction in the return on assets from 0.8% to \n0.4% from FY2015 to FY2016 and the fall in the return on equity from 9.3% to 4.8% over the same \nperiod. Similar to commercial banks, the gross NPAs for the NBFC sector increased from 3.6% \nin FY2013 to 4.6% in FY2016 as a result of a slowdown in certain sectors, such as commercial \nvehicles, power, and other infrastructure. The capital adequacy ratio for NBFCs was 24.3% as of \nFYE2016, compared to 27.3% as of FYE2015.5 Profitability for the NBFC sector has remained \nstable over the last year, with return on assets of 2.2% and return on equity of 10.6% for FY2016. \n6 \n \n3.  In September 2015, to promote financial inclusion and access to credit, the RBI awarded, \nin-principle, small finance bank (SFB) licenses to 10 applicants. The awardees have 18 months \nto comply with the various requirements and start banking operations. Under RBI guidelines, \nSFBs will be allowed to function like normal banks and will have the ability to raise deposits, but \nwill have higher priority sector lending (PSL) requirements (75% compared to 40% for a standard \ncommercial bank) and need to focus on smaller loans, with at least 50% of the loan portfolio \nconstituting loans of less than $37,000.7 SFBs are expected to continue focusing on microloans, \nwhile increasing their focus on small individual loans and loans to micro, small, and medium-sized \nenterprises (MSMEs). \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The less-developed areas to be targeted under the transaction are in Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, \nMadhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh. All states are classified as least-developed \nor less-developed as per  Raghuram Rajan Panel Report. Government of India. 2013. Report of the Committee for \nEvolving a Composite Development Index of States. Delhi. \n3  RBI.

According  to \nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC) data,8 there are 29.8 million MSMEs in India operating \nacross  all  industries  and  employing  more than  69  million  people.  Included  are  2.2 million \nenterprises headed by women and 15.4 million rural enterprises, many of which focus on primary \nagriculture activities. As of 2012, MSMEs accounted for 45% of Indian industrial output and 40% \nof  exports.  Around  94%  of  MSMEs  are  unregistered,  making  statistical  estimates  difficult. \nHowever, the contribution of MSMEs to GDP is estimated to be growing at 11.5% annually, higher \nthan overall GDP growth.  \n \n5.  Access to finance and credit. Notwithstanding the size of the financial sector and the \nsignificant strides the government is making, including the successful Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan \nYojana (Prime Minister\u2019s People Money Scheme) and the introduction of SFBs, access to finance \nfor individuals in India remains a key issue.9 Access to credit is also severely limited, with fewer \nthan 15.8% of men and 11.3% of women accessing credit through formal channels.10 For MSMEs \nas well, the lack of adequate access to finance has been the biggest challenge to further growth. \nWhile financing needs depend on each MSME\u2019s sector, the size of its operations, and its stage of \ndevelopment, financial institutions have typically limited exposure to MSMEs versus larger more \nestablished  commercial  enterprises,  due to a higher  risk  perception and  limited  access to \nimmovable collateral. According to the IFC report (footnote 8), the total requirement for financing \nIndia\u2019s MSME sector is approximately Rs32.5 trillion, of which Rs26.0 trillion is for debt financing. \n \n6.  Investment rationale. Given the continued need to address issues related to access to \nfinance and credit for many underserved and lower-income customer segments in India, ADB\u2019s \nnon-sovereign  operations  has  sought  to  identify  financial  institution  partners  that  have \ndemonstrated the ability to reach underbanked segments on a profitable and sustainable basis. \nIn 2014, ADB approved a project with two private banks in India to address access to credit for \nwomen borrowers in self-help groups and access to funding for small farmers.11 In the following \nyear, it approved a project with another private bank to support financial inclusion in India.12 In \n2016, ADB approved a project to support microfinance lending to women borrowers and sanitation \nfinancing.13 In addition to its direct funding to banks and microfinance institutions for onlending to \nunder-banked  segments,  ADB  has  also  supported  financial  inclusion  in  India  through  the \nMicrofinance Risk Participation Program and through an equity investment in a credit rating \nagency.1415 Looking to build on such initiatives to promote financial inclusion in the country, ADB \nis targeting partnerships with financial institutions involved in the SME segment, which is starting \nto be serviced on a more wide-scale basis by NBFCs and the new SFBs. \n                                                \n8  IFC. 2012.

AUF is an NBFC based in Rajasthan that has operated in the market since 1996 as a \npioneer, becoming a significant provider of asset finance and credit to MSMEs. Through its robust \ncustomer-centric business model, AUF caters to the needs of the unbanked and under-banked \nsegments of society, with over 85% of its total loans categorized as PSL under RBI guidelines, \nwhile its comprehensive underwriting systems have enabled it to maintain solid asset quality and \nprofitability  while  achieving  above  industry  average  growth  rates.  AUF  is  the  only  non-\nmicrofinance NBFC to have received an in-principle SFB license from the RBI. The proposed \ntransaction seeks to support AUF\u2019s growth as it transitions to an SFB and looks to diversify and \nincrease the tenor of its liabilities while it builds its deposit franchise, and in doing so, support AUF \nas it expands its MSME lending activities in line with government programs. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n8.  Overview. AUF is a non-deposit-taking NBFC that started its operations as a regionally \nfocused commercial vehicle financing company targeting lower income customers in Rajasthan. \nIn 2010, AUF attained NBFC status and began its micro and small enterprises (MSEs) and small \nand medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) business. In 2011, the company established Au Housing \nFinance Limited and expanded its operations into Goa, Madhya Pradesh, and Punjab. In 2012, \nthe company started Au Insurance, a licensed insurance broking company, and diversified its \nliability mix to multiple sources and instruments. It also expanded to Chhattisgarh. During 2013\u2013\n2014, AUF expanded into Delhi, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh. As of FYE2016, AUF had a \npresence in 10 states through 291 branches, the majority of which were in Rajasthan (130), \nGujarat (42), Maharashtra (39), and Madhya Pradesh (36). In October 2015, the company \nreceived RBI\u2019s in-principle approval to convert to an SFB. The target date for transitioning to an \nSFB is April 2017. \n \n9.  As of FYE2016, AUF\u2019s loan portfolio totaled Rs82.2 billion with over 235,000 active \ncustomers across all business lines. AUF has the following three key business lines: \n(i)  Micro and small enterprises. Representing 23.4% of the overall loan portfolio as \nof FYE2016, AUF\u2019s MSE lending activities target customers such as micro and \nsmall  manufacturers  (truck  and  tractor  body manufacturers, fabrication  units, \nfurniture manufacturers); service enterprises (schools, vehicle workshops, medical \nclinics);  retailers  (grocery  stores,  hardware  and  electronic  shops);  and  agri-\nbusinesses (small oil mills, flour mills, dairy farms). AUF offers a broad range of \nloan products to this segment for working capital, business expansion, information \ntechnology, and facilities upgrades. \n(ii)  Small and medium-sized enterprises and structured finance. The SME and \nstructured finance unit comprised 25.0% of the portfolio as of FYE2016 and is \nsubdivided into SMEs (38.8%), construction finance (36.0%), and NBFCs (25.2%). \nTargeted  customers  for  SMEs  include  traders,  wholesalers,  distributors,  and \neducation and health care facilities. Key loan products for this unit include revolving \ncredit facilities and term loans. \n(iii)  Commercial vehicle finance. AUF provides commercial vehicle loans to low-\nincome, self-employed, first-time, and small transport entrepreneurs. Historically \nAUF\u2019s primary business line, commercial vehicle loans, comprised 51.6% of the \nportfolio (as of FYE2016). The commercial vehicle portfolio is subdivided into multi-\nutility  commercial  vehicles  (36.0%),  heavy  commercial  vehicles  (4.0%),  light \ncommercial vehicles (6.0%), small and multi-utility commercial vehicles (25.0%), \nthree wheelers (6.0%), and cars (23.0%). \n10.  Business strategy. With its transition to an SFB, AUF seeks to broaden the range of \nfinancial products and services offered to targeted lower-income customers by offering agriculture \n ", "4 \nloans, consumer loans, savings accounts, and other financial services such as insurance. In \naddition to extending its product offerings, AUF also intends to increase its customer reach, \ninitially through deeper penetration into areas where it currently operates and later through \nexpansion into neighboring states. Becoming an SFB will further enhance AUF\u2019s brand, playing \nto its competitive advantages, including its quick turnaround time, broad coverage in largely \nuntapped semi-urban and rural markets, solid asset quality, diversified loan portfolio, lack of \nunsecured lending, and well-qualified local staff with high retention rates. \n \n \n11.  To assist in building operational capabilities for conversion to an SFB, AUF has engaged \na number of consultants to work with management. Ernst & Young is engaged as the overall \nproject manager for SFB conversion and is also advising on any enhancements that may be \nrequired  in  risk,  compliance,  and  treasury  functions.  Accenture  is  advising  on  information \ntechnology infrastructure and implementation, as well as the development of processes and \npolicies for asset and liability products. Aon Hewitt is advising management on revising its human \nresources strategy to meet AUF\u2019s evolving needs. \n \n12.  RBI regulations do not allow banks or SFBs to own more than a 10% stake in NBFCs. To \nmeet these regulations, AUF divested 90% of its shareholding in its wholly owned subsidiary Au \nHousing  Finance  Limited  to  Kedaara  Capital  and  Partners  Group  on  30  June  2016.  The \ntransaction also allowed AUF to comfortably meet the minimum capitalization requirements of \nRs1.0 billion for an SFB without raising new equity. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n13.  Ownership. In 2008, AUF received its first outside equity infusion from a well-known \nbrokerage house in India, Motilal Oswal Securities, followed by regular private equity infusions \nfrom high-quality domestic and international institutional investors. Its shareholding structure as \nof 30 June 2016 comprised Sanjay Agarwal (managing director) and family (31.30%); Warburg \nPincus (through Redwood Investment) (21.79%); IFC (11.04%); Chrys Capital (through Labh \nInvestment) (8.21%); Kedaara Capital (through Ourea Holdings) (7.71%); MYS Holdings (2.72%); \nMotilal  Oswal  Securities  (1.20%);  Kedaara  Capital  (direct  investment)  (0.32%);  various  life \ninsurance companies (5.31%); and individuals and employees (10.40%). Integrity due diligence \nwas conducted in accordance with ADB's Integrity Due Diligence Guidelines for Nonsovereign \nOperations. \n \n14.  Corporate governance. AUF\u2019s board comprises eight directors, two executive directors, \nthree shareholders\u2019 nominee directors, and three independent directors. The board is chaired by \nSanjay Agarwal, who is also the managing director. The directors have substantial experience in \nthe fields of finance, transportation, and housing finance. The board is supported by a number of \ncommittees, including the audit committee, corporate governance committee, nominations and \nremuneration committee, assets-liabilities management committee, credit and risk management \ncommittee, corporate social responsibility committee, and executive committee. \n \n15.  Management. AUF has a well-defined organizational structure. Senior management is \ncomprised of the managing director, executive director, chief operating officer, and chief financial \nofficer, with separate business and credit managers for its commercial vehicle finance, MSME, \nSME, and structured finance units. In addition to the overall management of the company, Sanjay \nAgarwal is responsible for risk, treasury, human resources, and SME business. Uttam Agarwal, \nexecutive  director,  has been  with  AUF  since  2003  and  looks  after  business  development, \ncollections, and credit. Deepak Jain, chief financial officer, is a chartered accountant who has \nbeen with the company since 1999, and is responsible for internal audit, information technology \n ", "5 \ninfrastructure, and overall control over the operations and accounts functions. As of FYE2016, \nAUF had 5,062 employees, with the majority of professionals at middle and senior levels qualified \nas chartered accountants (or the equivalent). \n \n16.  Risk management. The AUF\u2019s credit and risk management committee has instituted a \nrisk management framework covering all aspects of credit, operation, and market risks. In terms \nof the credit process, AUF starts with requiring adequate collateral for all types of loans and has \nan in-house technical team for collateral assessment. Every loan applicant has to meet the \nrespective approving authority and verification of each know-your-customer, income tax, and bank \ndocument is done by the risk containment unit. Once the application clears the initial assessment, \nrelationship officers complete cash flow assessment for the loan, which has to clear three levels \nof checks (relationship officer, business manager, and credit manager), before the loan file is \nsubmitted for approval. After disbursement, an internal team of chartered accountants reviews \nfiles and ensures that proper documentation, process and compliance of credit, and operation \npolicy have been done. Management reviews monthly portfolio reports to identify and rectify any \npotential risk areas. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n17.  ADB will provide debt financing to AUF by subscribing to up to $75 million (in Indian rupee \nequivalent) of senior unsecured nonconvertible debentures having recourse to AUF\u2019s balance \nsheet.16  \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  Use of proceeds. AUF will use the proceeds of ADB\u2019s debt financing to finance loans to \nMSMEs in semi-urban and rural areas in India. At least 50% of funding from ADB will be deployed \nin less-developed states as classified in the Raghuram Rajan Panel Report, 2013. \n \n19.  Monitoring and reporting. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department will carry out \nproject monitoring. AUF will provide ADB with financial reports at predetermined regular intervals \nand as requested. These will include (i) unaudited financial statements on a quarterly basis, (ii) \naudited  financial  statements  on  an  annual  basis,  (iii)  compliance  certificates  for  financial \ncovenants on a quarterly basis, (iv) reporting on the MSE and SME and structured finance loan \nportfolios  on  a  semiannual  basis,  and  (v)  semiannual  reporting  on  selected  development \nindicators agreed by ADB and the borrower. \n \n20.  Evaluation. Monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB regularly, and at \nleast  annually.  The  first  report  will  be  submitted  no  later  than  12  months  after  the  first \ndisbursement. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n21.  Support  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  growth  and  government \npriority sectors. ADB\u2019s funding will support growth of AUF\u2019s MSE and SME and structured \nfinance portfolios, and reach underserved customer segments in India directly as well as through \n                                                \n16 Nonconvertible debentures are a form of fixed maturity debt security (that cannot be converted to company equity or \nstock) regulated by the RBI and the Securities and Exchange Board of India. Upon issuance, the nonconvertible \ndebentures will be listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange/National Stock Exchange. \n ", "6 \nother NBFCs. Over 85% of AU\u2019s loan portfolio is classified as PSL and will have significant \nfinancial inclusion and job creation effects. It will also support education and health care segments \nin rural India. AUF has provided funding to 250 schools, helping approximately 30,000 rural \nchildren with improved educational infrastructure in rural and semi-urban areas. \n \n22.  Provide access to longer tenor debt. AUF had historically focused on commercial \nvehicle financing, with relatively short loan tenors. As AUF management continues to diversify its \nloan portfolio and grow its MSE and SME and structured finance segments of the loan portfolio, \nwhich have relatively longer tenors, AUF needs additional sources of longer tenor financing. This \nis also highlighted in ICRA\u2019s credit ratings note issued in March 2016.17 ADB\u2019s loan will provide \nscarce medium-term funds to AUF needed to diversify its product portfolio. \n \n23.  Strengthen financial sector and diversify funding sources. With its conversion to an \nSFB,  AUF\u2019s  funding  structure  will  change.  In  accordance  with  RBI  guidelines,  access  to \ncommercial bank funding will be restricted to a maximum cap of 300% of AUF\u2019s net worth, and \nmore importantly, the nature of these borrowings going forward will be extremely short-term. In \naddition, while bilateral assignments and securitization with other banks have been significant \nsources for AUF\u2019s funding during the past several years, as it transitions to an SFB, management \nwill focus on retaining a higher percentage of assets on its books and decrease its reliance on \nbilateral assignments and securitizations with other banks. AUF has a net funding gap of an \nestimated $1.1 billion until FY2018 and projects to grow its MSME portfolio by 37% over the same \nperiod. ADB\u2019s funding will support AUF as it diversifies its funding sources during its transition to \nan SFB, a key component of the government\u2019s financial inclusion strategy. \n \n24.  Support for women borrowers increased. ADB\u2019s funding will benefit female micro and \nsmall  enterprise  borrowers.

ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 emphasizes ADB\u2019s support to the financial sector \nby  helping  to  develop  financial  infrastructure,  institutions,  and  products  and  services.  The \nproposed transaction contributes to financial sector development by supporting the growth of an \nSFB, an important component of the financial sector in India.19 ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy \n2020 also seeks to promote inclusive growth. Without access to formal financial services, lower-\nincome people or underserved segments will be excluded from the growth process and its \nbenefits.  According  to  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  India,  2013\u20132017,  ADB\u2019s \nnonsovereign operations will continue to support the infrastructure and financial sectors by \nundertaking selective projects for physical and social infrastructure and financial infrastructure.20 \nThe proposed transaction will support the development of microfinance in India, part of the \nfinancial infrastructure identified in the country partnership strategy, and a high priority for the \ngovernment. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n29.  The debt investment is classified as category FI for impacts on the environment and FI \ntreated as C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The investment's potential \nenvironment and social impacts, its risks associated with the financial intermediary's existing \nand/or likely future portfolio, and its commitment and capacity for environmental and social \nmanagement, have been assessed. AUF has an existing environmental and social management \nsystem that applies an exclusion list and procedures based on the size of the loan to address \nenvironmental and social risks of projects. Prior to disbursement of the ADB financing, the \ncompany will enhance its existing environmental and safeguards management system to comply \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) requirements by updating its exclusion list and its \nscreening and categorization procedures21. The proposed debt investment will be used by AUF \nto support inclusive sector segments, including MSE, SME, and structured finance, with targeted \ncustomers  involved  in  trading,  wholesale,  distribution,  education  and  health  care  facilities, \ncommercial vehicle finance, and construction finance. AUF will not utilize ADB funding to finance \nprojects with category A impacts on the environment or projects with category A or B impacts for \ninvoluntary resettlement or indigenous peoples. \n \n30.  AUF will apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, ensure that investments using \nADB funds abide by applicable national laws and regulations, and comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. It will also comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social \nProtection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core \nlabor standards.22 AUF will report regularly to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws, and (ii) \nthe  measures  taken.  Information  disclosure  and  consultation  with  affected  people  will  be \nconducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s requirements. The transaction is classified as having some \ngender elements. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n31.  AUF was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating  corruption, money  laundering,  and  the financing  of terrorism.  AUF\u2019s know-your-\ncustomer and anti-money laundering policy mitigates the risks of money laundering and terrorist \nfinancing.
