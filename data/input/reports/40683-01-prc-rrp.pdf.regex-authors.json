I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Risk  Mitigation  and  Strengthening  of \nEndangered Reservoirs in Shandong Province Project. The report also describes proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Effective Reservoir Utilization for Integrated Water Resources \nManagement,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n2.  The PRC has developed rapidly. From 1978 to 2008, its economy grew by about 10% \nper year on average. This rapid economic growth has depended in part on reservoirs, which \nhave been important in flood control, irrigation, hydropower generation, and water supply. The \nreservoirs in the PRC have a total storage capacity of about 554 billion cubic meters (m3), about \none-sixth of the total yearly runoff nationwide. They control an irrigation area of about 16 million \nhectares  (ha),  about  one-third  of  the  country\u2019s  total  irrigation  area.  Their  total  generation \ncapacity of about 70 million kilowatts is about one-third of the total national power generation. \nThe reservoirs provide about 500 billion m3 of water supply yearly, about 20 billion m3 of this for \nhousehold use. In 1998, 1,335 large and medium-sized reservoirs in the PRC stored about \n53 billion m3 of floodwater and protected more than 200 cities and 2.3 million ha of farmland \nfrom flooding, reducing the number of people who fell victim to flooding by 27.4 million.  \n \n3.  The PRC has 87,085 reservoirs.1 About 90% were built during the period of the Great \nLeap  Forward  and  the  Cultural  Revolution  (1958\u20131976),  using  outdated  and  low  technical \nstandards and inadequate plans, surveys, designs, and construction. Most of these reservoirs \nhave been used for 30\u201350 years, and many of the water-retaining dams and equipment are \ndamaged and need to be repaired and strengthened. Many of the reservoirs do not meet \nmodern safety standards.  \n \n4.  The PRC has three safety classes of reservoirs according to the Safety Assessment \nMethods for Dams2 and the Guidelines on Dam Safety Assessment.3 In the class III (most \nunsafe)  category  are  37,032  reservoirs,  43%  of  the  total.4 The  potential  failure of  class III \nreservoirs  threatens  lives  and  property  downstream.  In  1954\u20132007,  3,503  reservoirs\u2014an \naverage of 65 reservoirs each year\u2014collapsed and killed at least 27,876 people in the PRC.  \n \n5.  The  storage  water  level  of  many  reservoirs  was  originally  designed  to  match  the \nhydrometeorological features of the watershed and downstream water demand. Now, however, \nmany  endangered  reservoirs  do  not  store  water  up  to  the  design  level  because  of  water \nleakage, instability of water-retaining dams, and inadequate spillway capacity for emergency \ndischarge of rapidly rising floodwaters. As a result, these endangered reservoirs cannot control \nfloods, supply irrigation water, generate hydropower, or provide household water year-round to \n                                                 \n1  The data are as of the end of 2006. Not included are reservoirs in Hong Kong, China; Macau, China; and \nTaipei,China. \n2  Ministry of Water Resources. 1995. Safety Assessment Methods for Dams. Document No. 86. Beijing; and Ministry \nof Water Resources. 2003. Safety Assessment Methods for Dams. Document No. 271. Beijing. \n3  Ministry of Water Resources. 2001. Guidelines on Dam Safety Assessment. SL258-2000. Beijing. \n4  The data are as of the end of 2006. The number of class III reservoirs is changing as reservoirs are rehabilitated \nand new ones enter into this class. The class III reservoirs are below national standards in actual flood control \ncapacity, do not work as designed, and pose a high safety risk. ", "2 \nusers. Strengthening these reservoirs will increase water supply at a lower cost and with less \nadverse impact on the environment and people than building new reservoirs. Strengthened \nreservoirs  will  also  have  potentially  positive  benefits  downstream,  especially  on  the \nenvironment, by increasing reservoir releases for environmental flow. The 1,346 reservoirs that \nwere  recently  rehabilitated  are  estimated  to  have  increased  the  storage  capacity  by \n500 million m3,  equivalent  to  the  increase  in  capacity  from  the  construction  of  540  new \nmedium-sized reservoirs. The cost of reservoir rehabilitation per cubic-meter increase in storage \ncapacity (CNY2\u2013CNY3) is lower than the cost of new reservoir construction (CNY6). \n \n6.  The government has given high priority to strengthening endangered reservoirs. The \nMinistry of Water Resources set up the National Reservoir Strengthening Program in 2001, with \nfinancial assistance from the government. The first phase of this program has been successfully \ncompleted, and 1,346 reservoirs are now operating at design capacity. The second phase, \ninvolving the strengthening of 2,112 class III reservoirs, began in 2003. To speed up the \nrehabilitation of unsafe reservoirs, the third phase of the program was prepared in October 2007 \nspecifically for 6,240 reservoirs, including those uncompleted in the second phase. \n \n7.  The  National  Reservoir  Strengthening  Program  will  be  completed  during  the \n11th Five-Year Plan period (2006\u20132010). But reservoir rehabilitation will continue beyond the \nprogram. More than 30,000 unsafe reservoirs still have to be rehabilitated, and class I and II \nreservoirs, which are not part of the program, are foreseen to deteriorate and urgently need \nrehabilitation. In addition, reservoirs rehabilitated under the program must be properly operated, \nmaintained, and managed for safety and effective use; otherwise, the rehabilitation would have \nbeen  futile.  To  address  these  issues,  sustainable  reservoir  rehabilitation  and  management \nmodels should be established in a province where reservoir safety is a serious issue, and \nsuccessful models should be replicated throughout the PRC. \n \n8.  Shandong Province, in the lower reaches of the Yellow River in northeastern PRC, has a \npopulation  of  about  92  million,  the  second  largest  in  the  PRC.  It  is  among  the  country\u2019s \nfastest-developing provinces, but it is also a province where water scarcity is most serious, with \nwater resources per capita of about one-sixth of the national average. Saltwater intrusion into \ncoastal catchments has rendered the available water resources less usable. Rapid economic \ndevelopment in recent years has been increasing the demand for water. \n \n9.  Reservoir safety is of great concern to Shandong Province, among other provinces in \nthe PRC. Of its 5,820 reservoirs, 4,114\u201471%, the highest proportion in the country\u2014are in the \nmost unsafe (class III) category.5 Reservoirs in the province collapsed 255 times and killed \n225 people in 1966\u20132008, for a reservoir collapse ratio of 4.4%, much higher than the national \naverage of 4.0%.  \n \n10.  The People\u2019s Government of Shandong Province (SPG) recognizes the urgent need for \nreservoir  rehabilitation  as  well  as  the  importance  of  managing  the  rehabilitated  reservoirs \nproperly to be able to use them safely and effectively for economic development. Besides the \n137  class III  reservoirs  in  Shandong  Province  that  are  included  in  the  National  Reservoir \nStrengthening  Program,  other  unsafe  reservoirs  in  the  province  are  being  rehabilitated \naccording to a plan drawn up by the SPG.6 But the provincial government is facing technological \nand financing difficulties. It seeks methodologies for rehabilitating a huge number of unsafe \n                                                 \n5  The data are as of the end of 2008. \n6  SPG. 2008.

The SPG has therefore requested a loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nestablish  sustainable  reservoir  rehabilitation  and  management  models,  through  the \nrehabilitation, management, monitoring, and evaluation of model reservoirs. ADB\u2019s assistance \nwill give the SPG access to international expertise and experience in reservoir rehabilitation and \nmanagement.  The  established  models  will  be  used  in  Shandong  Province  and  replicated \nthroughout the PRC. \n \n12.  The proposed project will contribute to integrated water resources management (IWRM) \nby establishing sustainable reservoir rehabilitation and management models, and is therefore in \nline with the priorities of ADB\u2019s water policy in promoting IWRM. The project is also in line with \nthe  country  partnership  strategy  (2008\u20132010)  for  the  PRC,  which  assigns  priority  to \nenvironmental  sustainability  through  more  effective  natural  resources  management,  and \nsupports the government\u2019s objectives in the water sector.7 \n \n13.  The project will have a direct positive impact on poverty reduction and the environment \nsince it will (i) reduce the risk of reservoir failure and protect lives, property, and livelihoods \ndownstream,  where  poverty  incidence  is  high;  (ii) provide  more  water  for  agriculture  and \nhousehold use to the poor living downstream of the reservoirs; and (iii) improve the quantity of \nreservoir releases, especially in the dry season, to sustain wetlands and the health of flora and \nfauna, maintain fisheries, preserve water quality, and improve groundwater resources.  \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s experience in the PRC indicates that water resources management projects in the \ncountry are generally well planned and implemented. Reflecting lessons learned from previous \nprojects, the project design requires (i) strong commitment to the project by the executing and \nimplementing  agencies,  including  the  provision  of  adequate  financial  and  staff  resources; \n(ii) thorough review of technical designs and technologies, rigorous economic  and financial \nanalysis, and detailed assessment of cash flows and social issues; (iii) comprehensive analysis \nof the institutional capacity of the executing and implementing agencies and adequate capacity \ndevelopment of these agencies at various levels; (iv) thorough guidance of the executing and \nimplementing  agencies  on  ADB  policies,  guidelines,  and  procedures  for  resettlement, \nenvironmental protection, and procurement; and (v) the introduction of an appropriate project \nperformance management system.  \n \n15.  Several projects have brought out the importance of sound watershed management. \nCommunities have been flooded after storms or prolonged rains partly because of denuded \nuplands and watersheds. A number of irrigation and rural development projects have also \nunderscored the dangers of improper watershed management, and flood control projects have \nshown the necessity of strengthening IWRM. River basin development demands an integrated \nand  coordinated  approach  involving  upper  watershed  management  and  conservation,  and \ndownstream rural development. The design of the project reflects all of these lessons. The \nsustainable reservoir management model to be established under the project will assist the SPG \nin setting out principles and procedures for watershed management. \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2008.

The impact of the project will be improved economic development in areas downstream \nof reservoirs. The outcome will be the sustainable rehabilitation and management of reservoirs. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nC.  Output \n17.  The project will establish sustainable reservoir rehabilitation and management models \nfor replication throughout the PRC, through a cycle of rehabilitation, management, monitoring, \nand evaluation of model reservoirs. It will have three components: (i) rehabilitation of model \nreservoirs, (ii) establishment of sustainable reservoir rehabilitation and management models, \nand (iii) project management support.  \n \n18.  Component 1: Rehabilitation of model reservoirs. The project will rehabilitate nine \nendangered reservoirs so that they meet modern technical standards of safety. These nine \nreservoirs will become model reservoirs for the sustainable rehabilitation and management of \nreservoirs.8 Through the monitoring and evaluation of technologies used in the rehabilitation of \nthe model reservoirs, technical guidelines for reservoir rehabilitation will be established under \ncomponent 2.  Also  to  be  set  up  under  component 2  were  methodologies  for  reservoir \nrehabilitation planning and proper reservoir management, which will be established by being \npilot-tested at the model reservoirs.  \n \n19.  Component  2:  Establishment  of  sustainable  reservoir  rehabilitation  and \nmanagement models. The project will develop a model for sustainable reservoir rehabilitation \nand  management,  consisting  of  (i) technical  guidelines  for  reservoir  rehabilitation,  (ii) a \nmethodology  for  estimating  the  risk  of  dam  failure  due  to  hydrologic  overloading,  (iii) a \nrisk-based methodology for reservoir rehabilitation planning, (iv) a reservoir portfolio database \nfor the province, (v) watershed management measures, and (vi) a reservoir safety management \nmodel. \n \n20.  Practical and cost-effective technologies for reservoir rehabilitation will be developed \nthrough the monitoring and evaluation of technologies used in the rehabilitation of the model \nreservoirs, a review of pertinent guidelines, and an assessment of the applicability of current \ninternational rehabilitation technologies to reservoirs in the PRC. Methodologies for estimating \nthe probability of dam failure due to hydrologic overloading and for systematically ranking the \nhuge number of reservoirs will be established by being pilot-tested at the model reservoirs to \nprovide a factual basis for rehabilitation planning. Functions will be added to the reservoir \nportfolio database for the province to enable the SPG to (i) estimate the risk of reservoir failure, \n(ii) estimate the adverse effects of reservoir failure, (iii) rank reservoirs on the basis of the \nforegoing  estimates,  and  (iv) assess  the  economic  impact  of  reservoirs  before  and  after \nrehabilitation. Watershed management measures that will improve water quality and reduce \nsedimentation in the model reservoirs will be identified on the basis of an assessment of water \nquality and sedimentation in these reservoirs, and current watershed management activities for \nthe reservoirs. A reservoir safety management model will be established for the operation and \nmaintenance, safety evaluation, post-earthquake safety inspection, emergency responsiveness, \nand financing of the model reservoirs, which will also be provided with facilities and equipment \n                                                 \n8  In addition to these nine reservoirs, during project implementation, about 10 small reservoirs which will be \nrehabilitated  separately  from  the  project  will  also  be  selected  as  model  reservoirs  and  surveyed  for  the \nestablishment of sustainable reservoir rehabilitation and management models. \n ", "5 \nfor operation and management. The SPG and the implementing agencies will secure adequate \nfunds for the operation and maintenance of all project facilities.  \n \n21.  In addition, a model for the effective use of the reservoirs for IWRM will be established \nunder an associated TA. \n \n22.  Component 3: Project management support. Through training and workshops, the \nproject will strengthen the capacity of the SPG and the implementing agencies, including the \nprovincial  project  management  office  and  the  local  project  management  offices,  for  (i) the \nsustainable rehabilitation and management of reservoirs; (ii) the effective use of reservoirs for \nIWRM; and (iii) project management, including project monitoring and evaluation, procurement, \ndisbursement, resettlement, and environmental protection. The project will also provide the SPG \nwith project management consultants, and the implementing agencies with office equipment and \nvehicles for project management.  \nD.

The government has requested a loan of $29.80 million,9 including taxes and duties,10 \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a term of \n25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined according to \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.15%  per  year,  and  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \n                                                 \n9  Includes funds for services (such as transportation and insurance) related to goods (equipment and materials) that \nare material and relevant to the success of the project. \n10 The calculation of taxes and duties to be financed under the project is based on the following principles: (i) the \namount of taxes and duties financed by the ADB loan should not represent an excessive share of the project \ninvestment plan, (ii) the taxes and duties should apply only to ADB-financed expenditures, and (iii) the financing of \ntaxes and duties should be material and relevant to the success of the project. \n ", "6 \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n25.  The ADB loan will finance 33.1% of the project cost (base cost, including taxes and \nduties). The Government of the PRC will finance 28.2%, and the SPG 20.2% (base cost, \nincluding taxes and duties, and physical contingency). The county governments will finance \n18.6% (base cost, including taxes and duties; and costs for land acquisition, resettlement, and \nenvironmental  protection;  physical  and  price  contingencies;  and  financial  charges  during \nimplementation).11 The PRC will be the borrower of the loan; it will make the proceeds available \nto the SPG, and hence to the municipal governments and to the project county governments. \nThe loan proceeds made available to the SPG, the municipal governments, and the project \ncounty governments will carry the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. The \ncounty governments will assume the foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks on the \nADB loan. Counterpart funds will be self-financed by the government, the SPG, and the county \ngovernments.

Implementation Arrangements \n26.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual (PAM).12 \n \n27.  An assessment of the procurement capacity of the executing and implementing agencies \nhas  confirmed  that  these  agencies,  acting  through  a  procurement  agency  and  with  the \nassistance of ADB and the consultants, would capably conduct procurement, including advance \ncontracting, meeting ADB\u2019s requirements. A procurement agency that is familiar with ADB\u2019s \nprocurement procedures was hired by the SPG in March 2010 to procure all works and goods \nunder the project on behalf of the executing and implementing agencies.13 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspect  Arrangements \nImplementation  December 2010\u2013December 2014 \nperiod \nEstimated project  31 December 2014 (project completion date) \ncompletion and  30 June 2015 (loan closing date) \nloan closing dates \n                                                 \n11  The seven counties include three county-level cities and one district. \n12  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Measures that would mitigate procurement risks are detailed in the Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nAspect  Arrangements \nProject management \n(i)   Oversight body  Leading group  Vice governor (chair) \nDeputy director of the SPG Office and the deputy directors \ngeneral of the SPFD, the SPDRC, and the SPWRD \n(members) \nLocal leading  Mayor or vice mayor (chair) \ngroups  Officials of the county government, including finance and \nwater resources bureaus, and the development and reform \ncommissions (members) \n(ii)  Executing  SPG \nagency \n(iii)  Key  Seven county governments directly responsible for the nine model reservoirs \nimplementing \nagencies \n(iv)  Implementation  PPMO established in the SPG  30 staff members \nunit  LPMOs established in the implementing agencies  About 50 staff members in \ntotal \nProcurement  NCB  30 contracts  $36.2 \nmillion \nConsulting services  QCBS  19.5 person-months of international  $1.0 \nconsulting services and 73.0 person-months  million \nof national consulting services \nIndividual consultants  12.0 person-months of national consulting  $0.1 \nservices   million  \nRetroactive  The executing agency has requested advance contracting and retroactive \nfinancing and  financing to enable the early start of procurement of civil works, goods, and \nadvance  services, including consultant services and training.

In addition to the loan, the SPG has requested a policy and advisory TA grant for \nEffective Reservoir Utilization for Integrated Water Resources Management to establish a model \nfor  effective  reservoir  use  for  IWRM.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $625,000 \nequivalent, of which $300,000 will be financed from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF\u2013other sources). The Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility will provide cofinancing of $200,000 equivalent on a grant basis, to be administered by \nADB.14 The Multi-Donor Trust Fund will be used to establish an effective reservoir use model for \nintegrated water use and to further increase environmental benefits downstream. The remaining \n$125,000 will be financed by the SPG through in-kind contributions, including the services of \ncounterpart staff and office accommodation. The TA will establish, for a selected river basin in \nShandong Province, model plans for (i) integrated water use, (ii) integrated flood management, \n                                                 \n14 Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, and Spain. \n ", "8 \nand (iii) greater environmental benefits downstream; and will disseminate the established model \nand develop capacities for effective reservoir use through workshops and training. The SPG will \nbe the executing agency; and the city, district, and county governments in the model river basin \nwill be the implementing agencies. The leading group established for the project will provide \noverall guidance for TA implementation. The provincial project management office established \nfor the project will also administer day-to-day TA activities. The TA will be implemented over \n24 months,  from  April  2011  to  March  2013.  International  (13  person-months)  and  national \nconsultants (25 person-months) will be recruited through quality- and cost-based selection at a \nquality\u2013cost weighting ratio of 80:20. \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n29.  Individual  reservoirs  and  the  project  as  a  whole  have been  subjected  to  economic \nanalysis. The primary economic benefit from the project will be improved flood control. Flood \ncontrol  benefits  cannot  be  overstated  considering  the  expected  increase  in  frequency  of \nextremes in weather as a result of climate change. These benefits were estimated by reservoir \ndesign institutes on the basis of extensive survey data and flood mapping. Improved crop \nproduction with the expansion of the irrigated land area, and increased aquaculture production \nbecause of greater water retention, will be secondary benefits. The economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) of the project is 16.2%; for the individual reservoirs, the EIRR ranges from 14.8% \nfor Muyu reservoir to 20.8% for Yangzhuang reservoir. Both the project as a whole and the \nindividual  reservoir  subprojects  are  therefore  economically  viable.  Sensitivity  analysis  has \nfurther  confirmed  that  the  economic  viability  will  remain  quite  robust  even  if  costs  should \nincrease or benefits decline in the future.  \n \n30.  The assessment of the financial viability and sustainability of the project considered the \nfollowing aspects: (i) the fiscal impact of counterpart funding of project expenditures, (ii) the \nfinancial management capacity of the project, and (iii) the financial sustainability of the project. \nThe fiscal impact of counterpart funding for implementation will be insignificant compared with \nthe total fiscal revenues of the province and the local governments. The analysis concluded that \nthe repayment of the ADB loan will not significantly affect the financial capacity of the county \ngovernments. Recurrent and maintenance costs will be financed by funds derived from water \nsupply tariffs and additional funds provided by the county governments.  \nB.  Governance \n31.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out according to \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The relevant sections of \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  will  be  included  in  all \nprocurement documents and contracts.  \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy has been explained to and discussed with the Government \nof the PRC and the SPG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 12). \nC.  Poverty and Social \n33.  The project will (i) decrease the threat of reservoir failure and mitigate flood damage for \na population of 1.0 million, including 55,000 poor people; and (ii) increase irrigation water supply \nfrom 143.1 million m3 per year to 183.5 million m3 per year, and irrigation areas from 27,300 ha \n ", "9 \nto 38,300 ha for 587,000 persons, including 33,000 poverty persons. Such improvements could \nincrease the average yields and incomes for most downstream farmers, thus helping to reduce \npoverty. The project will also improve water supply conditions for 180,000 persons, including \n2,000  poor  persons.  During  project  implementation,  13,500  jobs  will  be  created  for  local \nunskilled persons, including poor persons, with at least 5 months of temporary employment.  \n34.  No significant gender issues are associated with any of the components of the project, \nbut planned developments in irrigation and water supply would increase women\u2019s income. \nWomen\u2019s living standards could also improve, since women and men use water differently \n(particularly in the household) and are vulnerable in different ways to natural disasters such as \nfloods (women, for example, bear more responsibility for the protection of children and older \npeople).  \nD.  Safeguards \n35.  Land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  Eight  of  the  nine \nsubprojects will require land acquisition or household relocation, but the impact will not be \nsignificant.  The  project  is  in  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). In total, 20.2 ha of collectively owned land, 89% of which is \ncultivated farmland, will be affected permanently. Four of the nine subprojects will require the \ndemolition of 1,056 square meters of housing and the relocation of six households with a total of \n27 persons. Some productive assets, ground attachments, basic infrastructure, and special \nfacilities will also be affected. The implementing agencies, with the assistance of the consultants \nhired  under  the  project  preparatory  TA,  have  prepared  eight  resettlement  plans  and  one \ndue-diligence  report.  The  pre-examination  of  land  use  was  domestically  approved  for  all \nsubprojects.  The  local  governments  have  endorsed  the  plans  and  disclosed  the  relevant \ninformation to affected persons. The key issue for the social safeguards is ensuring that the \nlocal governments fulfill their commitment to provide investment financing for development \nprojects in the communities that were affected by the construction of the dams in 1960\u20131980.15 \nLand acquisition and resettlement costs will be fully financed by the implementing agencies. \nThere are no indigenous peoples within the project locations; the project is therefore in category \nC in this regard.  \n \n36.  Environment.  The  project  is  in  environmental  category  B,  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. An environmental assessment of the project conforming to the \nPRC regulatory framework and ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) has been \ncarried  out.  The  initial  environmental  examination  report  summarizes  the  findings  of  the \nenvironmental assessment reports on the nine subprojects and the due-diligence review of the \nassociated  facilities.  Extensive  public  consultations  involving  stakeholder  and  focus  group \ndiscussions were undertaken twice during project preparation. The potential adverse impact \nduring rehabilitation and operation includes the limited standard impact of construction and the \nunsafe disposal of dredged sediments, construction spoil, wastewater, and solid waste. This \nimpact will be prevented or minimized to acceptable levels through the implementation of an \nenvironmental management plan with adequate mitigation and monitoring arrangements. \n                                                 \n15 In 2006, the central government required local governments to extend post-resettlement development support to \ncommunities that had to resettle because of the construction. Annual cash subsidies are being provided to eligible \npersons but development plans approved by the affected counties have been implemented too slowly. As of 2009, \nonly 12% of the investment budgeted for the nine reservoir subprojects had been spent. \n ", "10 \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n37.  The major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.16 \n \nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisk  Mitigating Measures \nReservoir safety. Although the  A dam safety panel of eminent national engineers has been \nrehabilitation designs of all nine model  established to review the rehabilitation of the reservoirs and \nreservoirs have been appraised and their  provide technical guidance. \ntechnical feasibility has been confirmed, \nreservoir rehabilitation should be \ncarefully conducted to ensure reservoir \nsafety. \n \nProject management. The PPMO and  Capacity development workshops in procurement, financial \nLPMOs have the capacity to implement  management,  resettlement,  and  environmental  protection \nthe project but are less experienced in  were  held  under  the  project  preparatory  TA.  During  the \nadministering foreign-funded projects.  implementation of the project, the capacity of the SPG and \nthe  implementing  agencies,  including  the  PPMO  and \nLPMOs,  will  also  be  strengthened  under  the  project \nmanagement component, with the help of consultants.  \nLPMO  =  local  project  management  office,  PPMO =  provincial  project  management  office,  SPG =  People\u2019s \nGovernment of Shandong Province, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nV.  ASSURANCES \n38.  The Government of the PRC and the SPG have assured ADB that the implementation of \nthe  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n39.  The Government of the PRC and the SPG have agreed with ADB on certain covenants \nfor the project, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements.  \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n40.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$29,800,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Risk Mitigation and Strengthening of \nEndangered Reservoirs in Shandong Province Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nwith  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n                                                                                                                              President \n28 October 2010 \n                                                 \n16  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Reporting \nSummary  Indicators with Baseline  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved  80% increase in crop output  Municipal and  Provincial and county \neconomic  value, from CNY13.7 billion in  county annual  governments maintain their \ndevelopment in  2007 to CNY24.6 billion by 2020,  reports, records,  commitment to manage \nareas  in the seven counties downstream  and statistics on  reservoirs applying the \ndownstream of  of the nine model reservoirs  agriculture and  established reservoir \nreservoirs    poverty  rehabilitation and \n50% reduction in poverty    management models. \nincidence, from 7.4% in 2007 to    \n3.7% by 2020, in the seven  Decreased reservoir failure \ncounties downstream of the nine  risk and flood damage \nmodel reservoirs  increase investment in the \nareas. \n \nIncreased investment in the \nareas increases employment \nopportunities for the poor. \n \nRisks \nClimate change adversely \naffects the river regime and \nwater storage and supply. \n \nUnexpected recession \nreduces wages, investment, \nand employment \nopportunities in the areas. \nOutcome      Assumptions \nSustainable   Establishment of the sustainable  Provincial,  Adequate funds are \nrehabilitation and  reservoir rehabilitation and  municipal, and  available for continuous \nmanagement of  management models by 2014 and  county annual  reservoir rehabilitation. \nreservoirs  rehabilitation of 200 class III  reports, records,   \nreservoirs yearly in Shandong  and statistics on  The rehabilitated reservoirs \nProvince following the model after  reservoir  are operated as designed.  \n2014  rehabilitation and   \n  management, flood  Investments are made to \nOperation of reservoir  management, and  improve the irrigation \nmanagement model in the nine  irrigation  system. \nmodel reservoirs in Shandong     \nProvince by 2014  MWR records on  Risks \n  reservoir  Tariffs do not cover full O&M \nReplication of the reservoir  rehabilitation and  cost. \nrehabilitation and management  management   \nmodels in at least five provinces    Poor governance and \nby 2015  Records on  corruption distort the process \n  reservoir  of development, and \nReduction in the threat of  rehabilitation and  disproportionately affect the \nreservoir failure and mitigation of  management of  poor. \nthe threat of flood damage for 1.0  the provinces   \nmillion people on 1,303 km2 of the  where the models \nareas downstream of the nine  are replicated \nmodel reservoirs by 2011   \n \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \n \nData Sources and \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Reporting \nSummary  Indicators with Baseline  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nIncrease in irrigation area, from \n27,300 ha in 2009 to 38,300 ha by \n2015, in the areas downstream of \nthe nine model reservoirs \nOutput      Assumptions \n1.
