Agriculture has developed rapidly and contributed substantially \nto the PRC's overall economic development. However, the transition to modern agriculture has \nnot  kept  pace  with  the  country\u2019s  urbanization  and  industrialization.  Given  agriculture\u2019s \nfundamental contribution to poverty reduction and improved rural livelihoods, the Government of \nthe  PRC  continues  to  prioritize  agriculture  modernization,  especially  by  encouraging  stronger \nparticipation of private companies. \n \n3. \nFood security concerns. PRC's arable land, which represents 10% of the world\u2019s total \narable  land,  supports  nearly  20%  of  the  world\u2019s  population.1 Limitations  in  cultivated  land  and \nwater resources (the PRC has 7% of the world\u2019s potable water), the adverse effects of climate \nchange,  population  growth,  and  ecological  vulnerabilities  impede  food  security  and  food \nproduction (footnote 1). Agricultural production in the PRC requires the efficient use of agricultural \nresources, including agricultural input, to meet the country\u2019s food demand.  \n \nInefficient use of agricultural inputs. The PRC is the world\u2019s largest fertilizer consumer \n4. \nand  producer,  accounting  for  about  one-third  of  total  global  production  capacity.  The  PRC\u2019s \nfertilizer industry has been overusing simple fertilizers,2 which has reduced soil fertility and crop \nyields  and  caused  environmental  damage  to  farmland  and  water  pollution,  threatening  public \nhealth and food production. In 2014, the PRC used 565 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare (ha) of \narable  land  -  three  times  higher  than  the  average  consumption  in  other  upper-middle  income \neconomies.3 Food  production  should  be  intensified  in  an  environmentally  sustainable  manner, \nand alternatives to simple fertilizers should be supported.  \n \n5. \nGovernment priorities for agricultural inputs. The Government of the PRC is promoting \nthe use of compound fertilizers4 and organic fertilizers to improve efficiencies and increase crop \nyields.  The  increasing  application  of  compound  and  specialty  fertilizers,5 including  enhanced \nefficiency fertilizers such as controlled-release and water-soluble fertilizers, could lower fertilizer \nconsumption  because  of  their  higher  nutrient-use  efficiency  and  reduce  nutrient  losses  to  the \nenvironment. However, the penetration rate of compound fertilizers in the PRC was only 35% of \n\n                                                \n1  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD).  2015.  Agricultural  Policy  Monitoring  and \n\nEvaluation 2015. Paris.  \n\n2  Simple fertilizers contribute single nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. \n3  World Bank. World Development Indicators. http://databank.worldbank.org/wdi (accessed 30 June 2017). \n4  Compound fertilizers combine nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in a single product. \n5  Specialty fertilizers are high-efficiency fertilizers with a tailored chemical composition and unique features, such as \n\nslow or controlled-released fertilizers and water-soluble fertilizers (to be used in drip irrigation systems). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ntotal fertilizer use in 2015, lower than the global average of 50%.6 The government\u2019s determination \nto increase fertilizer efficiency is translated into an ambitious policy goal of slowing the growth of \nfertilizer consumption to zero by 2020.7 \n \nChallenges facing  PRC  farmers.  Farmers  in the PRC  lack technical  skills,  education, \n6. \nmarket information, sales channels, and access to finance. Emigration out of rural communities, \nencouraged by higher wages in urban communities, has left an older labor force in the rural PRC. \nFrom 1992 to 2012, the PRC\u2019s rural population declined by 150 million people. This situation has \ndeprived the sector of the modern, skilled workforce it needs for more complex and larger-scale \nfarming operations, including using modern machinery and equipment.8     \n \n7. \nEmerging land consolidation. The lack of access to knowledge-intensive agriculture is \nattributed to the small size of farms in the PRC, which prevents farmers from reaching the critical \nmass required to invest in modern farming techniques. The average size of farms in the PRC is \nonly 0.6 ha, as opposed to an average of 30.0 ha in high-income countries and 1.5 ha in low- and \nmedium-income countries.9 To address this issue, the government is promoting farmland transfer, \nwhich allows the PRC\u2019s farmers to rent farmland from other farmers and encourages large-scale \nfarming  in  the  country.10 Rural  farmers  are  also  increasingly  turning  to  agricultural-production \noutsourcing services to overcome agricultural production constraints. An agricultural-production \noutsourcing service is a contract arrangement whereby a farm household pays service fees to an \nindividual  or  organization  to  complete  production  tasks  such  as  plowing  fields,  sowing  seeds, \ntransplanting seedlings, and harvesting. However, machine and equipment owners are normally \nindividuals or small-scale cooperatives that lack professional farming knowledge and have limited \ncapacity to provide technical support to farmers. The PRC\u2019s farmers and small-scale cooperatives \nstill need comprehensive technical assistance that combines efficient agricultural input products, \nfarming and irrigation equipment, and tailored services.  \n \n8. \nProject  selection.  The  project\u2019s  sponsor  is  Kingenta  Ecological  Engineering  Group \n(Kingenta),  the  largest  compound  and  specialty  fertilizer  producer  and  supplier  in  the  PRC. \nThrough  this  project,  Kingenta  established  a  new  company  Kingfarm  to  help  it  transform  from \nbeing a leading fertilizer manufacturer to becoming an integrated solution provider to farmers. The \nproject  team  identified  Kingfarm  as  a  suitable  candidate  for  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nsupport because of (i) Kingenta\u2019s leading position in the PRC\u2019s compound and specialty fertilizers \nindustry, with advanced technical capability and satisfactory financial performance, (ii) Kingfarm\u2019s \ngrowth  potential  via  its  rollout  of  300  one-stop  shops  for  farmers  through  Kingenta\u2019s  existing \nnetwork to provide quality agricultural input and services to about 3 million smallholder farmers in \nthe PRC, and (iii) Kingenta\u2019s actions following the government\u2019s policy to curb the excessive use \nof  simple fertilizers  and encourage the  application  of  enhanced  efficiency  fertilizers,  which  will \nhelp in the environmentally sustainable transformation of agricultural development in the PRC. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n \n9. \nKingfarm  will  (i)  establish  300  crop  production  service  (CPS)  centers  that  will  provide \ncompound and specialty fertilizers, seeds, and other agricultural inputs, and agricultural services \n\n                                                \n6  L.

Headquartered in Linshu, Shandong province, Kingenta was established in \n1998 by Lianbu Wan, its current chair and chief executive officer. It is the PRC\u2019s largest compound \nand specialty fertilizer producer and distributor with a solid record of gaining market share (11%) \nin a fragmented industry, and the largest controlled-release fertilizer producer (50% market share) \nand nitro-compound fertilizer producer (30% market share) (footnote 6). It has about 10,000 staff, \nincluding 650 in research and development and 3,000 in marketing.  \n \n11. \nabout $3.4 billion at the end of June 2017.  \n \n12. \nIntegrity due diligence was conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Integrity Due Diligence \nGuidelines for Nonsovereign Operations. 12 Tax integrity due diligence was also conducted.13 No \nsignificant or potentially significant integrity risks were identified.14 \n   \nB. \n \n13. \nImpacts. The project aligns with the government\u2019s strategic orientations for agricultural \nmodernization and rural development, particularly the government\u2019s calls to (i) improve the quality \nand  competitiveness  of  the  PRC\u2019s  agricultural  products  through  high-quality  farmland  and \nprofessional farmers, (ii) increase the nutrient use efficiency of fertilizers from the current 33% to \n40% in 2020, and (iii) slow the growth in fertilizer consumption to zero by 2020.15  \n \nOutcome. The project will improve the accessibility and affordability of high-efficiency and \n14. \nenvironmentally sustainable compound fertilizers and other quality agricultural inputs for about 3 \nmillion  smallholder  farmers  in  eight  PRC  provinces.  The  project  also  promotes  modern  and \nenvironmentally sound agricultural production with more efficient agricultural input and services \nin  the  PRC.  The  project  will  reduce  the  use  of  conventional  nitrogen  and  phosphate  fertilizers \nthrough  climate-smart  agriculture  and  precision-farming  practices.  Higher  efficiency  in  nutrient \ndelivery  will result in less fertilizer being applied, leading to improved productivity and reduced \nsoil contamination and pollution to waterways and the atmosphere. Performance indicators with \ntargets are in the design and monitoring framework (footnote 15). \n \n15. \nplants constructed.

The project aligns with ADB\u2019s \nMidterm Review of Strategy 2020, which emphasizes the need to contribute to food security and \nagricultural productivity and to promote food safety and quality standards.16 The project is also \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2016\u20132020  for  the  PRC,17 which  supports \n(i) modern  agriculture  through  high-efficiency  agricultural  input  and  mechanical  equipment; \n(ii) circular  agriculture  through  value  chains  to  reduce  resource  inputs  and  waste  outputs; \n(iii) knowledge sharing between the public and private sectors; and (iv) climate resilience through \nagricultural infrastructure, technology, and practices. Through this project, ADB will support the \nsustainable development of knowledge-intensive agriculture in the PRC through the application \nof science and technology and agriculture services that CPS centers would provide.  \n \n17. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  aligns \nwith ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources, which stresses that ADB\u2019s \nprivate  sector  agribusiness  investments  \u201chave  the  potential  to  benefit  millions  of  smallholder \nfarmers directly and contribute to public goods, such as food security, food safety, and reduced \nsoil and water pollution.\u201d 18 The project will complement a proposed PRC sovereign project, which \naims to develop inclusive agricultural service systems through the application of information and \ncommunication technology along agriculture and food value chains. 19 \n\nD. \n\n \nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 1 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n\nTable 1: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nKingenta and Kingfarm are subject to the general laws and industry-specific rules and regulations in \nthe PRC, particularly the (i) Regulations on Safe Management of Hazardous Chemicals (2011), (ii) \nEnvironmental Protection Law (2015), and (iii) Food Safety Law (2009, amended in 2015). \nMost  of  Kingfarm\u2019s  senior  management  team  are  from  Kingenta  and  have  substantial  industry \nknowledge and experience.  \nThe  CPS  centers  will  provide  farmers  agricultural  input  for  high-value  crops  such  as  fruits  and \nvegetables;  and  staple  crops  such  as  wheat,  rice,  and  corn.  They  also  offer  farmers  agricultural \nservices across the entire crop cycle from seeding, planting, fertilizing, plant protection to harvesting. \nKingfarm  will  implement  an  advanced  management  information  system  and  enterprise  resource \nplanning system to monitor the operations, sales, cash flows, and inventory of the CPS centers. \nAt a minimum, Kingfarm will report quarterly on KPIs, including financial and operational KPIs; and \nannually on safeguard and development indicators (i.e., output and outcome targets).  \n\nCPS = crop production service, Kingenta = Kingenta Ecological Engineering Group, Kingfarm = Kingfarm Agricultural \nServices, KPI = key performance indicator, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSources: Kingenta and Asian Development Bank.  \n\n                                                \n16 ADB. 2014.

Kingfarm\u2019s  unique  business  model  in  the  PRC  will  ensure  reliable  supply  of \nenvironmentally  sustainable,  and  efficient  agricultural  inputs  and  services  to  about  3  million \nsmallholder farmers in eight PRC provinces.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nADB will invest $30 million equity in Kingfarm and provide a $50 million general corporate \n\nThe Assistance  \n\n \nA. \n \n20. \nfinance loan to Kingfarm OpCo. \n \nB. \n \n21. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nADB assistance will add value on three fronts: \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nLong-term capital. ADB will provide long-term financing in the form of equity and \ndebt, which is not readily available from local capital market. Long-term financing \nis particularly important given the scale and \u201cgreenfield\u201d (new) nature of the project \nin a cyclical sector. ADB is in a unique position to offer such long-term financing \nbecause of its understanding of the agriculture sector, particularly in the PRC.   \nBest  safeguard  practices.  Kingenta  recognizes  ADB\u2019s  added  value  in  helping \nKingfarm develop and implement a robust and integrated environmental and social \nmanagement system (ESMS) and monitor the progress during implementation.  \nInclusive and innovative business model. ADB\u2019s investment will help Kingfarm \nestablish  an  innovative  business  model  that  can  help  millions  of  smallholder \nfarmers with quality agricultural inputs and professional farming services. ADB\u2019s \nparticipation  will  also  help  enhance  the  image  of  Kingfarm  in  preparation  for  a \nfuture  IPO.  In  addition,  ADB  could  facilitate  replication  of  Kingfarm\u2019s  innovative \nbusiness model in other countries of Asia and the Pacific.  \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \n22. \ncategory B for environmental impacts and category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been identified and \neffective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  are \nincorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. Potential risks and impacts during construction \nare  generally  site-specific,  short-term,  and  can  be  effectively  managed  by  good  engineering, \nconstruction,  and  housekeeping  practices  based  on  construction  environmental  management \n\n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\n[redacted] \n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nplans. No involuntary resettlement or indigenous people issues are envisaged for the project. The \nnew facilities (upgrade plants) will either be constructed within existing premises and facilities or \nin  adjoining  lands  belonging  to  industrial  parks  or  zones.  Subprojects  with  significant \nenvironmental or social impacts will not be supported by the proceeds of ADB\u2019s investment. The \ninstitutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  Kingenta  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n23. \nA  corporate  audit  was  undertaken  by  an  external  third  party  in  accordance  with  the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The corporate audit assessed that the operations of the company \ncomplied with statutory requirements.
