The facility will finance a series of small-value activities to support and complement larger \nprojects financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the country. \n \n2. \nIn particular, the facility will fund (i) project preparatory support for design and procurement \nreadiness  of  ensuing  projects;  (ii)  small  pilot  projects  to  demonstrate  new  technologies, \ninternational  standards,  and  management  approaches  for  potential  scale-up  under  ensuing \nprojects;  (iii)  project  implementation  support  for  ongoing  ADB  projects  to  ensure  the  efficient \ndelivery of project outcomes; and (iv) capacity building and supplemental support for completed \nADB projects in operation and maintenance (O&M), asset management, facility upgrading to meet \ncritical needs, and post-disaster rehabilitation assistance. The first activity to be financed under \nthe facility will enhance the sustainability of a completed ADB-financed investment in urban water \nproject. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FACILITY \n\nRationale  \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nCountry portfolio overview. Despite ADB\u2019s assistance portfolio in the Kyrgyz Republic \ntripling from 2000 to 2018, capacity constraints remain in the country, resulting in project start-up \ndelays that affect contract awards and disbursement rates. Other challenges include inadequate \ndesigns and cost overruns. \n \n4. \nProject sustainability risks. Key factors leading to sustainability risks in ADB\u2019s project \nportfolio include (i) low tariffs (below intended O&M cost recovery levels), (ii) weak operational \nefficiency through traditional technologies, (iii) weak O&M capacity, and (iv) limited resources and \nknowledge of asset management. Moreover, there is an immediate need to support upgrades to \ncompleted water supply infrastructure to meet updated standards. \n \nStrategic context. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS), 2018\u20132022 for the Kyrgyz \n5. \nRepublic,1 which is aligned with government priority sectors under the Development Program of \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic,2 prioritizes  support  for  minimizing  project  start-up  delays,  and  improving \nprocurement  and  project  implementation  capacity  through  technical  assistance  and  on-the-\nground  support  from  ADB\u2019s  resident  mission.  In  line  with  the  CPS,  the  SEFF  will  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s strategic priorities. The proposed assistance under the facility is also aligned with \nthe Strategy 2030 operational priorities to (i) address remaining poverty and reduce inequalities, \n(ii) accelerate progress in gender equality, (iii) make cities more livable, (iv) tackle climate change \nand enhance environmental sustainability, (v) promote rural development and food security, (vi) \nstrengthen  governance  and  institutional  capacity,  and  (vii)  foster  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration.3 \n \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018.

The SEFF will deliver on CPS priorities by \n6. \n(i) supporting early design work and advanced procurement actions to alleviate project start-up \nbottlenecks; (ii) strengthening the government\u2019s project implementation capacity; (iii) introducing \nnew technologies, standards, and management approaches; (iv) enhancing the sustainability of \nADB-financed  investments  through  improved  asset  management  and  O&M  practices;  and  (v) \nbringing  completed  infrastructure  investments  in  conformance  with  up-to-date  performance \nstandards. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nObjective.  Activities  under  the  facility  will  improve  the  efficiency,  sustainability, \nresponsiveness,  and  readiness  of  ADB-financed  operations.  They  will  contribute  to  the \nachievement of the outputs and outcomes of the linked ADB-financed projects. \n \n8. \nFacility scope. The facility will finance a series of small-scale activities related to one or \nmore of the outputs (para. 9).4 Each activity will be linked to a planned, ongoing, or completed \nADB-financed project. Under the current CPS, priority sectors are agriculture, natural resources, \nand rural development; education; energy; public sector management; transport; and water and \nother urban infrastructure and services. \n \n9. \nthe linked ADB-financed projects.  \n \n10. \nOutput  1:  Project  implementation  readiness  for  ensuing  projects  improved.  The \nfacility  will  support  project  preparation,  design  activities,  and  institutional  strengthening  for \ninvestments  to  be  financed  under  one  or  more  ensuing  ADB-financed  projects,  including  the \nNaryn  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Development  Program\u2014the  country\u2019s  first  results-\nbased lending operation\u2014planned for 2019 approval.5  \n \n11. \nOutput 2: New technology, innovation, or improvement in design standards pilot-\ntested. The facility will support pilot-testing advanced technologies and management approaches \nto  reduce  life-cycle  costs,  improve  service  efficiency  and  quality,  and  minimize  negative \nenvironmental and social impacts. Development of road asset management is an example of a \nnew technology or management approaches activity under the facility. \n \n12. \nOutput  3:  Project  efficiency  and  sustainability  enhanced.  The  facility  will  enhance \nproject efficiency and sustainability, including capacity and implementation support for ongoing \nprojects,  post-disaster  rehabilitation,  O&M,  and  upgrading  of  completed \ninfrastructure \ninvestments to conform with up-to-date performance standards. The first activity under this output \nis the Osh\u2013Plotina water treatment plant (WTP) chlorine neutralization unit. \n \nC. \n \n13. \nThe  first  activity  under  the  facility  will  support  the  physical  upgrades  of  the  chlorine \nneutralization unit at the Osh\u2013Plotina WTP, completed in September 2016 under  the Emergency \nAssistance  for  Recovery  and  Reconstruction  project. 6 The  unit  will  be  upgraded  to  a  higher \n                                                \n4  List of Indicative Activities (accessible from the list of linked documents in the Appendix). \n5  ADB.

The project completion report concluded that the project was successful, \nbut noted that upgrading the chlorine neutralization unit at the Osh\u2013Plotina WTP to meet up-to-\ndate water supply standards with the highest safety levels remains a priority.7 Given its urgency, \nthe government requested the chlorine neutralization unit upgrade at the Osh\u2013Plotina WTP as \nthe first activity under the facility. The upgraded chlorine neutralization unit will ensure enhanced \nneutralization of any chlorine leakage, which is essential to the safe and sustainable operations \nof the WTP. The activity will enhance ADB\u2019s development impact at an overall cost of $625,000.8 \n \nD. \n \n15. \nThe government has requested a facility in an amount up to $10 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFund  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  to  help  finance  the  activities.  The  facility  amount \nincludes the total estimated cost of activities to be financed, including taxes and duties, physical \nand price contingencies, and other charges during implementation (Table 1). \n \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n\nItem \nA.

As  described  in  para.  12,  the  first  activity  will  enhance  the \ntreatment performance of the chlorine neutralization unit at the Osh\u2013Plotina WTP. The water tariff \nlevied by Vodokanal, the city\u2019s water utility, can sufficiently cover O&M costs. \n \n23. \nThe  economic  analysis for the completed project  was updated  to take  into account the \nadditional costs associated with the subgrant for the first activity. The analysis showed that the \noverall project will remain viable, with an economic internal rate of return of 18.7% compared with \nthe 19.1% reflected on the project completion report and a financial internal rate of return of 2.4% \ncompared with the initial estimate of 2.8%, as the outputs have not changed, and the increase in \ncapital expenses is negligible in relation to the size of the linked project. \n \n24. \ntaking into account activity subgrants for the concerned projects. \n \nThe Ministry of Finance and ADB will agree on all activities to be financed under the facility, \n25. \ntaking  into  consideration  that  (i)  activities  should  be  consistent  with  the  CPS  and  the  facility \noutputs,  (ii)  activities  would  not  be  classified  category  A  for  safeguards  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009), and (iii) the maximum activity size will not exceed $3 million. \n \nB. \n \nThe  financial  management  risk  for  the  implementing  agency  for  the  first  activity  is \n26. \nsubstantial.
