THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) the proposed \nloans, and (ii) the proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the Clean Technology \nFund (CTF), both to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the additional financing of the Ha Noi \nMetro Rail System Project (Line 3: Nhon\u2013Ha Noi Station Section). The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The project will develop a 12.5 kilometer (km) dual-track rail line between the suburb of \nNhon and the main railway station of Viet Nam\u2019s capital city, Ha Noi\u20143.5 km underground, 8.5 \nkm elevated, and 0.5 km on a transition ramp. The project works include a depot with ancillary \nbuildings at Nhon, elevated viaducts, a transition tunnel portal, bored tunnels, and 12 stations. \nThe  project  will  provide  electrical  and  mechanical  systems,  including  all  railway  systems \nrequired to operate a modern metro line. The project also includes support for detailed design, \nprocurement, construction supervision, design verification, project management, and capacity \ndevelopment. The additional loans will finance an expected increase in the cost of the civil \nworks contract, as well as consulting services for a second phase of project management \nsupport (PMS).  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Line 3 of the Ha Noi metro system is one of four priority rail lines planned under the \ngovernment\u2019s urban transport master plan for Ha Noi that was approved by the Prime Minister in \n2008.1 The project will enhance access to transport in six districts of Ha Noi and form an integral \npart of a better public transport system that aims to improve connectivity and raise the share of \npublic  rail  and  bus  transport  to  40%  of  passenger  demand.  This  will  shift  travelers  from \ncomparatively  high-carbon  urban  travel  modes  such  as  private  motorcycles  and  cars  and \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions. The executing agency is the Ha Noi People\u2019s Committee \n(HPC), which is the city government. The implementing agency is the Ha Noi Metropolitan \nRailway Management Board (MRB), which was established in 2003 by HPC with responsibility \nto carry out implementation of those portions of the Ha Noi Metro Rapid Transit network not \ndirectly operated by Viet Nam Railways.  \n \n4.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided technical assistance in 2006 for an initial \nfeasibility study of the metro line 3 project.2 ADB approved a $293 million loan from ordinary \ncapital resources (OCR) for the current project on 29 March 2011, and it became effective on 13 \nMarch 2012. Nine civil works and equipment contracts and four consulting services contracts \nhave been financed with cofinancing of \u20ac110 million from Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement \n(AFD), \u20ac250 million from Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tr\u00e9sor (DGT) of France, and \u20ac73 million from \nthe European Investment Bank (EIB). ADB is financing the civil works contract for the tunnel \nsection of line 3 and four underground stations through contract package 3.3 \n \n                                                \n1  JICA. 2007. The Comprehensive Urban Development Programme in Hanoi Capital City. Ha Noi. \n2   ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Ha Noi Metro Rail System \nProject. Manila (TA 4900-VIE). The feasibility study was subsequently updated and completed by DGT-funded \nconsultants.  \n3  ADB originally had two contracts to finance, one of them jointly with AFD. After restructuring, ADB is fully financing \none contract.   ", "2 \n5.  The ADB-financed feasibility study in 2009 estimated the overall project cost at \u20ac895.4 \nmillion, then equivalent to $990.5 million.4 Detailed design and updated cost estimates were \ncompleted  by  the  project  implementation  consultant  in  March  2012  with  DGT  financing. \nHowever, delays and cost increases caused by design changes, audits, contractual issues, the \nremoval of existing utility lines, preparation and implementation of resettlement plans,  and \ncontinued price escalation have raised the project cost in US dollars to the current estimate of \n$1,375.7 million.5 The Government of Viet Nam approved the revised project outlines on 5 and \n23 December 2014 and authorized the needed increases in official development aid financing. \nThis approval and the additional financing will ensure that the project will be completed in 2019 \nand help the government achieve economic development objectives laid out in the Ha Noi urban \ntransport master plan (footnote 1). \n \n6.  Additional loans for the project were approved in December 2014 by AFD (\u20ac69.0 million) \nand DGT (\u20ac85.0 million). EIB expects to approve its proposed additional loan of \u20ac70.0 million by \nthe end of 2015. The government has asked ADB to provide additional financing of $59.0 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s OCR and $50.0 million from the CTF6 to finance potential future increases in the \ncost of the project\u2019s civil works, as well as $5.8 million from the Asian Development Fund (ADF) \nto finance additional PMS consulting services. The government\u2019s application for CTF financing \nwas approved by the CTF Trust Fund Committee on 28 October 2014. The additional financing \nfrom ADB and the cofinanciers is likely to be enough to complete the project. The government \nhas committed to providing additional counterpart funds to finance taxes and duties, utility \nremovals, and land acquisition and resettlement (LAR).  \n \n7.  Four  out  of  the  nine  contract  packages  for  civil  works  and  equipment  have  been \nawarded. Current rates of progress are about 14% for contract package 1, 21% for contract \npackage 2, 90% for contract package 4, and 23% for contract package 5. The depot and the \n8.5-km elevated section of line 3 are expected to be completed in late 2016. Procurement is \nongoing for four contracts, and awards are expected by the end of 2015. The ADB-financed \ncontract package 3 was awarded on 22 October 2015. The civil works under this contract are \nexpected to be completed by mid-2019, and all the line 3 works should be finished by the end of \n2019. \n \n8.  The project includes the first railway tunnel ever constructed in Ha Noi, and this work \nrequires strong international technical and project management expertise. Because the project \nis highly complex, MRB staff requires continuous support in managing daily activities to ensure \nthat  implementation  meets  the  cofinanciers\u2019  requirements  and  high  international  quality \nstandards. The consulting services for phase 1 of PMS under the current project were financed \nby AFD, but the contract for this phase expired on 30 September 2015. ADB will finance phase \n2 of PMS consulting services from its proposed additional financing. The PMS consultant is to \nbe mobilized immediately after loan effectivity, which is currently scheduled for April or May \n2016. ADB will assign individual staff consultants to ensure that the PMS services continue until \n                                                \n4  This proposed additional financing project uses an August 2015 exchange rate of \u20ac1.0 = $1.1 to convert financial \nfigures, including the financing to be provided by the cofinanciers in euros. The current project used a February \n2011 exchange rate of \u20ac1.0 = $1.3 to estimate the overall project cost, including the financing by the cofinanciers in \neuros, which was equivalent at that rate to $1,077.2 million.     \n5  The civil works costs may rise because houses and buildings above the tunnel section may prove to be obstacles \nto construction. Before tunnel boring starts, the contractor for the ADB-financed contract package 3 will identify \nobstacles through a preliminary assessment and develop a detailed work plan that will include actions, a schedule, \nand costs for land acquisition and resettlement.  \n6  The CTF is part of the multidonor global Climate Investment Fund, which supports low-carbon transport to promote \ngreenhouse gas emission reduction. \n ", "3 \nthe phase 2 consulting firm has been mobilized. The terms of reference for the PMS phase 2 \nconsulting services are in the project administration manual (PAM).7  \n \n9.  Based on the criteria of ADB Operations Manual, the current project is not performing \nwell because (i) expected outputs are being delivered 4 years behind schedule; and (ii) contract \nawards and disbursements are significantly behind schedule.8 9 Therefore, ADB has applied a \nstrict business process to improve the performance of the project. A concept review for the \nadditional  financing  for  the  project  was  conducted  in  line  with  the  requirements  of  ADB \nOperations Manual.10 The review examined options for restructuring the project. It found that the \nneed to connect the maintenance depot in Nhon to a major central interchange through line 3 \nmade it impractical to reduce the project to a scale that could be covered by the original \nfinancing. Doing so would result in a significant loss of benefits. The due diligence for the \nadditional  financing  demonstrated  that  the  project  remains  technically  feasible.  It  remains \neconomically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of more than 12%. It has a financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  of  \u20131.22%,  below  the  weighted  cost  of  capital  of  0.70%.  HPC  has \ncommitted to maintaining the subsidy necessary to make the project financially sustainable \nthroughout the metro system\u2019s life. Such a subsidy is the norm for most metro systems around \nthe world. \n   \n10.  Compliance with the loan\u2019s social covenants has been satisfactory, and compliance with \nthe environmental covenants has been generally satisfactory. HPC has not complied with the \nfinancial  covenants,  because  it  has  not  produced  audited  financial  statements  for  the \ncofinanciers\u2019 project accounts for FY2012, FY2013, and FY2014. Initial delays in LAR have \nbeen mitigated. Resettlement related to the project\u2019s depot and access road components is \nnearing completion, and resettlement plans for the underground section are being finalized. \nADB-cleared environmental monitoring plans have been incorporated into all works contracts, \nand monitoring reports are being provided and disclosed. Submission of the audited financial \nstatements for the original project for FY2012, FY2013, and FY2014 will be a condition for HPC \nto be able to withdraw from the ADF loan account, to ensure that the loan\u2019s financial covenants \nare complied with. With the award of the tunneling contract, the overall project performance \nfrom  now  to  completion  is  expected  to  be  satisfactory  with  the  additional  financing.  The \nproposed loan for the additional financing is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan \nfor Viet Nam for 2015\u20132017.11  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The aggregate impact and outcome of the project will not change with the additional \nfinancing. The impact will be the establishment of an integrated, sustainable public transport \nsystem in six districts of Ha Noi.12 The outcome will be the establishment of competitive metro \nrail services along the project line 3 corridor.  \n \n                                                \n7  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  ADB. 2011.

Outputs \n \n12.  The project outputs with additional financing will remain the same: (i) line 3 of the Ha Noi \nmetro system put into operation, and (ii) the improvement of implementation capacity at the \nMRB. The additional financing will cover the additional costs of developing line 3 and the \nconsulting  services  for  phase  2  PMS  to  further  improve  the  MRB\u2019s  implementation  and \noperations abilities. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n13.  Based on the current euro\u2013US dollar exchange rate in August 2015, the original overall \nproject cost estimate was equivalent to $990.5 million. Due to expected increases in the costs of \nthe civil works and potential LAR, the project cost is now estimated to be equivalent to $1,375.7 \nmillion (Table 1).  \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \nCurrent  Additional \nItem  Amounta  Financingb  Total \nA.

The overall ADB project cost comprises $293.0 million of ADB\u2019s existing financing for the \ncurrent project and the proposed additional financing from ADB and the CTF of $114.8 million. \nThe additional ADB and CTF loans will finance the expected increase in the civil works costs \nand the cost of consulting services for phase 2 PMS, excluding any taxes and duties to be \nimposed on the works and services, as well as financing charges during implementation. All \nfinancing charges are to be capitalized.  \n \n ", "5 \n15.  Under  the  parallel  collaborative  cofinancing  arrangement,  additional  loans  already \napproved of \u20ac69.0 million ($75.9 million equivalent) from AFD and \u20ac85.0 million ($93.5 million \nequivalent) from DGT, along with the loan of \u20ac70.0 million ($77.0 million equivalent) expected \nfrom the EIB, will finance the expected increase in the costs of the civil works, electrical and \nmechanical  systems,  rolling  stock,  and  consulting  services  under  their  respective  contract \npackages. The cofinanciers\u2019 financing, per the project\u2019s investment plan, and their collaboration \nwith ADB will be subject to the satisfactory conclusion of their internal approval processes.  \n \n16.  The government\u2019s additional counterpart funds of $24.0 million will finance taxes and \nduties, any additional LAR costs, and utility lines diversion, according to the cost estimates \napproved by the Prime Minister in December 2014. \n \n17.  The government has requested a loan equivalent to $59.0 million from ADB's OCR and \na loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR4,107,000.00 ($5.8 million) from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources, to help finance the project. The OCR loan will have a 20-year term, including \na grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The ADF \nloan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per \nannum during the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan and project agreements. The CTF will cofinance the project with a loan of $50 \nmillion with a 40-year term, including a grace period of 10 years, a management fee of 0.18% \nper annum on the undisbursed balance of the loan, and an interest charge of 0.25%.13 ADB will \nadminister the CTF loan in accordance with the CTF loan agreement with the government. \n  \n18.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  No change will be made to the project\u2019s implementation arrangements with the additional \nfinancing. Other changes from the original financing arrangements have been recorded in the \nPAM (footnote 7), for which the project administration manual has been updated. HPC will be \nthe  executing  agency  and  MRB  the  implementing  agency.  HPC  has  established  a  major \nprojects steering committee for metro system development. It is chaired by the HPC vice-\nchairman, who is responsible for project oversight and coordination. MRB is overseeing the \nplanning, design, and implementation of the metro system.  \n \n20.  To address issues hindering project performance, ADB and the PMS consultants have \nconducted project implementation training for MRB staff on project management, social and \nenvironmental safeguards, and financial management. MRB has also gained improved skills \nand  knowledge  during  the  procurement  of  major  project  contract  packages.  Project \nperformance, costs, and compliance with agreed schedules are monitored by MRB and the \ncofinanciers in monthly project progress meetings and during project review missions. All project \ndocuments are disclosed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy 2011. The \ncentral  government  has  also  agreed  to  provide  stronger  coordination  and  support  for  the \ndevelopment of the Ha Noi metro system through regular national steering committee meetings \nthat are also attended by the development partners. The project is scheduled to be physically \ncompleted by 30 June 2019, and the targeted additional loan closing date is 31 December 2019. \n \n21.  ADB, AFD, DGT, and the EIB will inform one another in advance of any missions, \nexplore joint participation in such missions, and report to one another on the findings of the \nmissions and the progress of their respective project components. The cofinanciers agree that a \nsingle  process  for  social  and  environmental  assessment  and  planning,  safeguard \ndocumentation,  consultation,  and  disclosure  be  conducted  that  satisfies  both  their  own \nrequirements and those of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). ADB will be responsible \nfor  conducting  due  diligence,  reviewing  documents,  and  monitoring  project  activities  in \naccordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement and will share all documents related to this \nprocess with the cofinanciers. AFD, DGT, and EIB will conduct the due diligence, monitoring \nand document reviews, and supervision of activities that are not required by ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement but may be required by the other cofinanciers. \n \n22.  ADB, AFD, DGT, and EIB will administer their respective contracts in accordance with \ntheir own policies and procedures. The cofinanciers will inform one another promptly of any \nevent that interferes or threatens to interfere with the processing and implementation of their \nrespective  loans.  The  cofinanciers  will  each  retain  their  independent  rights  of  action  and \ndecision under their respective legal agreements with the government. \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  February 2016\u2013June 2019 \nEstimated closing date  31 December 2019 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Vice-chairman of the HPC (chair); Department of Investment and Planning, \nDepartment of Finance; and others under the HPC and line ministries \n(director-general and/or deputy-director-general levels)    \n(ii)   Executing agency  Ha Noi People\u2019s Committee \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Ha Noi Metropolitan Railway Management Board \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Project implementation division 1, 41 staff \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based  216 person-months  $ 4.7 million  \nselection (80:20, full  127 person-months international,   \n ", "7 \nAspects   Arrangements \ntechnical proposal)  89 person-months national \nProcurement  International competitive bidding \nDisbursement   The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CTF = Clean Technology Fund, HPC = Ha Noi People\u2019s Committee, OCR = \nordinary capital resources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n \n23.  Technical  requirements  will  remain  unchanged.  After the  award  of  remaining major \ncontracts, scheduled by the end of 2015, the project is expected to perform satisfactorily until \ncompletion. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  Economic analysis. The project remains economically viable despite cost increases \nand delays. The 2010 economic analysis was updated taking into account the actual (i) capital \ncosts, (ii) construction schedule, (iii) changes in the income per capita in Ha Noi, and (iv) \ndifference between the 2009 and 2014 real dong\u2013US dollar exchange rates. The original traffic \nforecasts were assumed to have been achieved 5 years later than anticipated by the original \nanalysis. The revised economic internal rate of return of the project is 12.9%, slightly higher \nthan the original 12.7% estimate. \n \n25.  Financial  analysis. The project\u2019s financial internal rate of return is \u20131.22%, with a \nweighted average cost of capital of 0.70%. Therefore, the project is not considered financially \nviable. Based on projected fare revenues, the project is expected to require a total subsidy over \nits life of $709 million, which subjects the project to a high financial sustainability risk. The large \namount of subsidy the government must provide over the long term as well as uncertainty over \nwhether sufficient expertise will be available to properly operate and maintain the rail system \nafter construction puts a heavy burden on the government agencies.  \n \n26.  To  address  these  issues,  the  loan  agreements  include  covenants  requiring  the \npreparation of a financial management and sustainability action plan (FMSAP). The plan will \nseek to develop alternative models for revenue generation that have been used successfully \nelsewhere in the world to help finance public transit systems, including for example the sale of \nadvertising space in the metro stations, government surcharges on the price of fuel, as well as \ncredit enhancement mechanisms (including of escrow mechanisms for government subsidies) \nand give firm recommendations for implementation of the action plan by the government. The \nplan will also examine how international private sector metro rail operators can be brought in to \nstrengthen the operations and maintenance functions once the project line goes into operation. \nThe government is determined to making all efforts to make the project sustainable. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, HPC, and MRB. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 7). A project integrity risk assessment determined \nthat the poor project performance and cost increases so far could not be attributed to poor \n ", "8 \ngovernance or corruption. Project-related governance has improved at both the national and \nlocal  government  levels.  Financial  probity  has  increased,  and  national  legislation  covering \nfinancial reporting and accounting standards has improved. However, the management and \ninstitutional capacity of the MRB remains a concern.  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n28.  The better public transit system to be provided under the project will benefit all people in \nthe areas served by line 3, especially those whose mobility is restricted. Among the prime \nbeneficiaries will be workers from the rural and suburban areas, women, elderly people, and \nstudents, all of whom use public transport more than other groups. The gender category for \ncurrent  project  and  the  additional  project  financing  is  effective  gender  mainstreaming. \nImplementation of the project\u2019s gender action plan has been delayed but has slowly improved \nsince the MRB mobilized a full-time gender specialist in July 2015 to monitor it.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  No additional environmental, resettlement, or indigenous peoples\u2019 impacts will result \nfrom  the  additional  financing.  The  project\u2019s  physical  scope  remains  the  same,  and  all \nsafeguards documents prepared for the current project will remain in effect. The project with the \nadditional financing will continue to be considered category C for all safeguards. \n \n1.  Involuntary Resettlement \n \n30.  A draft resettlement plan for the line 3 works was prepared in 2011. ADB approved an \nupdated resettlement plan for the depot and the access line in February 2014. Compensation \npayments were completed in January 2015. ADB conducted a due diligence review of the \nresettlement activities during February\u2013April 2015. The review concluded that the compensation \nand assistance provided to affected households, the consultations with affected persons, and \nthe grievance redress procedures generally followed the provisions in the resettlement plan. \nThe decision for forced land recovery followed the procedures provided by the government\u2019s \nexisting regulations. An updated resettlement plan was approved by ADB in August 2015 to \ncover the impacts of development of line 3\u2019s underground section. This followed an updating \nand improvement of entitlements for the affected households, as well as consultations and \nsurveys. The payment of compensation and provision of assistance to affected households is a \nprecondition  for  the  start  of  the  underground  section  civil  works.  An  addendum  to  the \nresettlement plan will be needed once the impacts of work on the tunnel section have been \nverified by the civil works contractor. Internal and external monitoring of resettlement activities \nfor the entire alignment on line 3 is being conducted. \n \n2.  Environment \n \n31.  ADB conducted an environmental due diligence review of ongoing works in March 2015. \nIt found the construction sites to be generally tidy and organized. Security personnel were \nassigned at the construction site, and the public was denied access to the area. The workers \nwere using proper protective equipment and were provided with satisfactory facilities. Disposal \nsites for hazardous materials had been allocated and approved by the relevant authorities. \nDespite some noise generated by project vehicles on some nights, no major environmental \nissues were observed. In May 2015, however, two accidents occurred at the construction site \n ", "9 \ninvolving the operation of heavy equipment.14 These incidents resulted from noncompliance with \nthe  project\u2019s  safety  requirements  that  are  included  in  the  site-specific  environmental \nmanagement plans. MRB has addressed the issues by instructing the contractors to prepare \nand implement preventive and corrective action plans. The construction supervision consultant \nis carefully monitoring the implementation of the contractor\u2019s method statements as well as \nconducting regular safety training sessions and supervising the corrective actions.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  The risk category for the additional loan is complex because ADB\u2019s overall financing \nexceeds $200 million and project progress has been slow. The individual risks were assessed, \nand the overall project risk was rated medium.  The assessment found the limited financial \nmanagement capacity of MRB and the uncertainty over the project\u2019s financial sustainability to \npose the highest risks. The major project risks and mitigating measures are summarized in \nTable 4 and detailed in the risk assessment and risk management plan.15 Overall, benefits and \npositive impacts are expected to outweigh any mitigation costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Major Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack of government policy support  The  government,  HPC,  and  MRB  will  (i)  prepare  future \nfor modal shift from use of private  projections for use of public transport and approve implementing \nvehicles to use of public transport.  rules for the modal shift, and (ii) the cofinanciers will support the \nimplementation of policy measures with adequate refinancing \nand improvement of HPC\u2019s and MRB\u2019s capacity through training. \nCosts increase more than expected  International  experts  will  be  engaged  to  support  project \nand the project is delayed.   management.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n33.  The government, HPC, and MRB have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n34.  The government, HPC, and MRB have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n35.  The government has agreed that (i) the OCR, ADF, and CTF loan agreements will be \nsubject to cross-effectiveness and will not be declared effective until all three agreements have \nbeen duly authorized or ratified by and executed and delivered on behalf of the government; \nand (ii) no withdrawals will be made from the ADF loan account for consulting services until the \ngovernment submits to ADB the audited financial statements for the original project for FY2012, \nFY2013, and FY2014. \n \nV.
