The programmatic approach, with three subprograms during 2016\u2013\n2018,  builds  on  previous  policy-based  operations  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and \nother  development  partners that sustain government  efforts to  improve  (i)  its fiscal  position  by \nadopting  prudent  policies  and  better  public financial  management (PFM),  and  (ii)  the  business \nclimate by continuing policy, regulatory environment, and public enterprise reforms. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDevelopment  constraints.  Tonga  faces  challenges  to  macroeconomic  resilience \nbecause of geographic disadvantages, exposure to shocks, and internal bottlenecks. The public \nsector  largely  drives  economic growth,  which  is  highly  volatile.  Gross  domestic  product (GDP) \ngrew  1.1%  on  average  during  FY2005\u2013FY2015,  compared  with  3.8%  globally.  Recovery  in \nagricultural  production  after  a  drought  in  2015, strong  remittances,  and construction  related  to \nTonga\u2019s  hosting  of  the  2019  Pacific  Games  led  to  estimated  GDP  growth  of  3.1%  in  FY2016. \nContinued construction for the Pacific Games and tourism will drive medium-term growth. \n \n4. \nAlthough the fiscal position has improved since the global economic crisis, Tonga remains \ndependent on external assistance. Cost overruns or funding shortfalls for the Pacific Games and \nexternal  shocks  such  as  substantial  crop  and  infrastructure  damage  from  Tropical  Cyclone \nWinston in February 2016 could undermine fiscal sustainability. System and capacity weaknesses \naffect procurement and financial management. Tonga\u2019s business environment is strong relative \nto  most  Pacific  developing  countries,  but  the  private  sector  faces  several  constraints.2 Legal \nframeworks for bankruptcy, foreign investment, and contracting need further improvement, and \nthe lack of reliable credit information raises the cost of extending credit to new clients. Tonga\u2019s \nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs) accounted for 19%\u201323% of the country\u2019s total capital stock, but \ncontributed only 7% to GDP in FY2014.3 To improve the commercial returns of the SOE portfolio, \nthe government must further emphasize governance, monitoring, and divestment of assets that \ncan be more efficiently operated by the private sector. \n \n5. \nGovernment reforms. Tonga has adopted a reform program to address constraints on \nthe public and private sectors.4 Despite limited policy-making and administrative capacity and a \npolitical economy environment where intertwined political and social networks pose inherent risks \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The program is in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016. \nCountry Operations Business Plan: Tonga, 2017\u20132019. Manila. It aligns with ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u2013\n2020. Manila. The concept paper for the program was circulated to the Board of Directors on 22 July 2015. \n\n2  In the 2017 Doing Business survey, Tonga was the top-ranked Pacific developing country, but was 85th among 190 \n\ncountries worldwide. World Bank. 2017. Doing Business 2017: Equal Opportunity for All. Washington, DC. \n\n3  The commercial activities of Tonga\u2019s 14 active SOEs include utilities, banking, and transportation. As of FY2014, \ntotal SOE portfolio assets stood at about $227 million, or just over half that year\u2019s GDP. The four largest SOEs\u2014\nTonga Power Limited, Tonga Development Bank, Tonga Communications Corporation, and Tonga Cable Limited\u2014\naccount for almost three-quarters of total assets. \n\n4  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n\n \n\n2). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nto  reform  implementation,  Tonga  has  made  good  progress  on  reforms  as  successive \ngovernments have shown persistence. The current government, in office since January 2015, is \ncommitted to \u201ca more progressive Tonga supporting a higher quality of life.\u201d5 \n \nAddressing  fiscal  challenges.  The  government  is  committed  to  prudent  fiscal \n6. \nmanagement.  Annual  average  domestic  revenue  growth  of  6.5%  outstripped  annual  average \ngrowth  in  recurrent  expenditure  of  5.0%  during  FY2011\u2013FY2016.  Increased  tax  rates  on \npetroleum products and unhealthy foods (partly offset by tax reductions on healthy alternatives) \nwere the major source of domestic revenue. The wage bill also went up during the period, amid \nfrequent pressures for public sector pay increases and cost of living adjustments. A remuneration \nstructure introduced in FY2017 is expected to stabilize longer-term wage growth, after a one-time \ncost of transitioning to the new structure. Tonga intends to minimize the cost of new developments \nand finance the Pacific Games through domestic revenues, grants, and corporate sponsorship. \nThere is a moratorium on nonconcessional debt. \n \n7. \nTonga\u2019s fiscal situation improved as the deficit (including grants) fell from 7.4% of GDP in \nFY2011 to a modest surplus of 1.7% of GDP in FY2014. Despite strong domestic revenues, the \nfiscal  position  returned  to  a  deficit  of  3.1%  of  GDP  in  FY2016  (Table  1)  because  of  current \nexpenditure  growth  (including  a  public  sector  pay  settlement) 6  and  lower  grants.  Tonga\u2019s \nimproved  debt  sustainability  led  the  World  Bank  and  ADB  to  move  from  100%  to  50%  grant \nfinancing. Increasing tax revenues and a declining wage bill are projected to reduce the deficit in \nFY2017\u2013FY2018.  Excluding  grants,  the  fiscal  deficit  averaged  7.9%  during  FY2011\u2013FY2016, \nindicating heavy dependence on external financing. \n \n\nof which: tax revenue \n\nItem \nTotal revenue and grants \nTotal revenue \n \n \n \n \nGrants \nTotal expenditure \n \n \n\nCurrent expenditure \n \n\n \n\nof which: wages and salaries \n\nTable 1: Fiscal Framework, FY2014\u2013FY2019 \n(% of GDP unless otherwise indicated) \nFY2015 \n28.1 \n21.4 \n18.3 \n6.7 \n29.3 \n25.8 \n11.4 \n\nFY2016p \n27.3 \n23.7 \n20.4 \n3.6 \n30.4 \n27.8 \n12.5 \n\nFY2014 \n27.5 \n20.0 \n17.3 \n7.5 \n25.7 \n25.0 \n11.2 \n\nFY2017f \n27.5 \n24.1 \n20.7 \n3.4 \n29.4 \n26.4 \n13.4 \n\nFY2018f \n28.6 \n24.6 \n21.0 \n4.0 \n29.8 \n26.1 \n12.8 \n\nFY2019f \n28.8 \n24.7 \n21.1 \n4.1 \n29.9 \n26.0 \n12.2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nin $ million \n\nin $ million \n\n(1.2) \n(5.1) \n(7.9) \n(33.9) \n49.0 \n429.0 \n\n(3.1) \n(13.3) \n(6.7) \n(28.8) \n48.7 \n430.0 \n\n(1.9) \n(8.7) \n(5.3) \n(23.8) \n48.2 \n446.0 \n\n(1.2) \n(5.8) \n(5.2) \n(24.4) \n48.7 \n466.0 \n\n1.7 \nOverall balance (including grants) \n7.6 \n \n(5.8) \nOverall balance (excluding grants) \n(25.4) \n \n45.8 \nPublic debt (domestic and external) \nGDP ($ million, current prices) \n439.0 \n( ) = negative, f = forecast, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, p = preliminary. \nSources: Asian Development Bank, Government of Tonga, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank. \n \n8. \nImproving the business climate. The government has introduced reforms to create a \nbetter business environment for the private sector and improve the efficiency of public enterprises. \nReforms  include  a  simpler  business  registration  system,  a  new  legislative  framework  for \nreceiverships,  and  a  clear  governance  framework  for  natural  resources.  Tonga  has  supported \npublic\u2013private partnerships, improved governance, and liquidated insolvent SOEs.

However, \nthe performance of the public enterprise portfolio is volatile and can be further improved through \nreforms to the governance and ownership structure of individual SOEs. \n \n9. \nADB contributions. ADB has supported government reforms through budget support and \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  improve  Tonga\u2019s  fiscal  performance  and  business  environment \n(figure). ADB disbursed budget support for Tonga in FY2010, FY2014, and FY2016 to address \ndevelopment  financing  needs,  cover  reform  costs,  and  provide  incentive  for  implementation \n(footnote 6). It backed the government\u2019s tax revenue mobilization and administrative efficiency \nmeasures,  which  led  to  rapid  domestic  revenue  growth  (para.  6).  ADB  assists  PFM  and  civil \nservice  reforms  through  TA 8 and  is  the  lead  external  partner  on  SOE  reforms.  Following  a \ndecrease in the return on equity of Tonga\u2019s public enterprise portfolio from about 5.6% in FY2006 \nto  0.1%  in  FY2009,  ADB-supported  measures  to  strengthen  the  Public  Enterprises  Act  2002, \nimplement skills-based SOE director selection, and commercialize selected SOEs helped push \nup the return on equity to 4.0% in FY2015. Reforms to improve SOE governance and efficiency, \nenhance  service  regulation,  and  strengthen  public  procurement  and  audit  positively  affect  and \ndirectly complement ADB\u2019s sector investments. \n \n\nADB Support for Fiscal and Business Environment Reforms in Tonga \n\n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PFM = public financial management, PSDI = Private Sector Development Initiative, \nSOE = state-owned enterprise, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nPartner  coordination.

Manila. \n9  The Joint Policy Reform Matrix, FY2016\u2013FY2018 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) forms \n\nthe basis for reforms supported under the program. \n\n \n\n\fImpacts and Outcome \n\nProgrammatic approach. ADB\u2019s Building Macroeconomic Resilience Program supports \n11. \ngovernment  reforms  through  three  subprograms  during  FY2016\u2013FY2018.10 The  programmatic \ndesign  allows  for  reform  sequencing  across  multiple  areas  to  account  for  Tonga\u2019s  limited \nimplementation  capacity,  while  providing  flexibility  to  respond  to  emerging  opportunities  and \nconstraints. ADB developed the policy matrix (Appendix 4) in consultation with the government \nand  other  development  partners,  and  in  alignment  with  national  priorities.  Subprogram  1  was \ncompleted in FY2016, and supported reforms focused on fiscal consolidation, PFM strengthening, \nand improving the business environment. \n \n12. \nSubprogram  2  continues  the  reform  agenda.  During  subprogram  1  preparation,  10 \nindicative  triggers  for  subprogram  2  were  identified.  Consultation  with  the  government  on  the \nevolution  of  reform  priorities  and  context  led  to  the  finalization  of  nine  policy  actions.11 Since \nsubprogram  3  will  conclude  the  program,  the  indicative  triggers  for  subprogram  3  were \nrationalized in line with government priorities and capacity, to strengthen and consolidate reforms \nimplemented under subprograms 1 and 2. The overall program is expected to close in FY2018, \nprior to the general election scheduled for November 2018. ADB will discuss the need for a follow-\non multiyear budget support program with the new government after the elections. \n \nB. \n \nThe  program  aligns  with  the  following  impacts  in  the  Tonga  Strategic  Development \n13. \nFramework, 2015\u20132025: (i) more inclusive and sustainable growth and development; (ii) a more \ninclusive, sustainable, and dynamic knowledge-based economy; and (iii) more responsive good \ngovernance  (footnote  5).  The  outcome  will  be  an  improved  fiscal  position  and  business \nenvironment  in  Tonga.  The  program  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Approach  2016\u20132020 \n(footnote 1), which supports greater resilience to external shocks and risks and a better business \nenvironment as key outcomes. \n \nC. \n \n14. \nThe  program  has  four  outputs.  The  first  three  outputs  are  in  line  with  the  JPRM,  and \ncontinue  government  reform  efforts  supported  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners.  The \nfourth  output  responds  to  damage  from  Tropical  Cyclone  Winston  in  the  Vava\u2019u  island  group, \nwhich increased financing needs in FY2016. \n \n15. \nSubprogram  2  supports  nine  policy  actions,  which  build  on  subprogram  1  reforms  and \naddress the critical challenges facing Tonga in improving its fiscal position and business climate. \nThe government has completed all nine actions. Additionally, nine indicative triggers have been \nidentified for subprogram 3, which may be refined based on government priorities and capacity. \n \nOutput  1:  Fiscal  resilience  supported.  Policy  actions  under  subprogram  1  included \n16. \nmeasures  to  strengthen  tax  revenue  mobilization.  The  government  conducted  a  civil  service \nremuneration review and introduced a new debt management strategy under subprogram 1. \n\nOutputs \n\n(i) \n\nFiscal  targets.  Subprogram  2  supported  the  development  of  a  fiscal  strategy \nbased on internally consistent medium-term targets for debt, revenue, and public \nservice wage affordability. The government\u2019s previous fiscal strategies and targets \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB.  2016.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Programmatic \nApproach  and  Policy-Based  Loan  and  Grant  for  Subprogram  1  to  the  Kingdom  of  Tonga  of  the  Building \nMacroeconomic Resilience Program. Manila. \n\n11 Indicative Triggers and Policy Actions Accomplished for Subprogram 2 (accessible from the list of linked documents \n\nin Appendix 2) summarizes the changes in the policy actions for subprogram 2. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nwere short term in nature. While Tonga\u2019s fiscal management has been prudent, \nexternal  shocks  and  spending  pressures  related  to  the  Pacific  Games  could \nundermine sustainability. The new strategy brings together three fiscal targets to \nbe maintained over the medium term: (a) external debt is below 50% of GDP, with \nonly highly concessional debt contracted; (b) domestic revenue is above 22% of \nGDP; and (c) public remuneration is below 53% of domestic revenue.12 This will \nhelp the government\u2019s planning, build resilience to shocks, and provide sustainable \nfunding for public services. \nTax revenues. Subprogram 2 continued tax regime changes related to health and \nthe  environment  through  increases  in  selected  excise  and  import  duty  rates  (on \nfuel, alcohol, tobacco and processed food items). The government raised the fuel \nexcise tax by 16% or T$0.09 per liter. It also introduced changes in other excise \ntax and import duty rates to improve revenue mobilization and provide incentives \nfor the consumption of healthy foods.13 Development partners estimate that similar \nmeasures  under  subprogram  1  raised  excise  tax  and  import  duty  revenue \ncollections by T$7.5 million (0.9% of GDP in FY2016), and that measures under \nsubprogram  2  will  raise  collections  by  a  further  T$10.2  million  (1.1%  of  GDP  in \nFY2017). These reforms have contributed to raising tax revenue to an estimated \n20.7% of GDP in FY2017. \nCivil  service  reforms.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government  conducted  a \ncomprehensive public remuneration review.  Based on its recommendations, the \ngovernment approved for subprogram 2 a new public service salary structure with \na  revised  pay  scale  that  provides  fair  and  appropriate  remuneration  (para.  6). \nPublic  servants  are  being  progressively  moved  to  the  new  payscale. 14  The \ngovernment also introduced a moderated performance assessment process under \nsubprogram 2.15 Following a brief adjustment period, these changes will achieve \ncost  savings  by  ending  automatic  salary  progressions  and  relieve  pressure  for \nuniversal  pay  settlements  from  civil  servants  at  the  top  of  their  pay  bands.  The \nwage bill as a share of domestic revenue is projected to fall below 50% of domestic \nrevenue (in line with fiscal targets) by FY2018. \n\n \n17. \nSubprogram  3  will  continue  the  tax  revenue  and  civil  service  reforms  to  help  meet \nsustainable wage bill targets. ADB is presently providing TA for civil service reforms (para. 9), and \nJPRM partners expect to provide TA for the tax reforms. \n \n18. \nOutput  2:  An  inclusive,  modern,  and  accountable  state  supported.  Policy  actions \nunder  subprogram  1  included  approval  of  new  public  procurement  regulations  and  other  PFM \nimprovements,  such  as  improved  audit  follow-up  procedures.  An  independent  regulator  with \npowers to regulate communication services was also established.16 \n\n(i) \n\nProcurement.  Subprogram  2  built  on  past  efforts  to  establish  a  centralized \nprocurement  system.  It  supported  the  implementation  of  a  new  procurement \n\n                                                 \n12  This includes employer social security contributions. The target moves to 50% over time.  \n13 Government of Tonga, 2016. Ministry of Revenue and Customs. Customs Duty (Amendment) 2016.

The  government  will  also  immediately \ntransition  other  staff  who  remain on  the  same  or  higher  salary  point under  the new  system.  Staff  whose existing \nsalary point is above the band for their new grade will remain on the existing pay scale. The government will remap \nsuch positions to the new pay scale as they are vacated and re-advertised. \n\n15 The performance assessment process was supposed to be introduced in FY2018 (under subprogram 3) but was \n\nintroduced in FY2017, indicating rapid reform progress in this area. \n\n16 The  Parliament  approved  the  establishment  of  the  Communications  Commission  with  powers  to  regulate \ncommunication services and manage license issuance, fee setting, monitoring, and consultation with the public. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthrough \n\ntracking database, which introduced an institutional mechanism that will enable the \nMinistry  of  Finance  and  National  Planning  (MFNP), \nits  Central \nProcurement Office, to maintain a detailed record of all procurements above the \nsmall-item  threshold  (T$7,500).  Compliance  and  performance  indicators  and \nassociated  targets,  which  will  allow  the  government  to  monitor  procurement \nperformance and maintain records, were also established under subprogram 2. \nRegulation.  Subprogram  2  supported  the  cabinet  approval  of  a  draft  national \nenergy bill, which includes provisions to regulate all energy sub-sectors (electricity, \ngas,  petroleum)  under  a  combined  sector  regulator.  Regulation  of  the  energy \nsector currently involves a variety of arrangements, with the Electricity Commission \nregulating distribution and supply and the Tonga Competent Authority regulating \npetroleum prices. The bill will establish an energy sector regulator that will merge \nthe responsibilities of both entities. The government will address the regulation of \nother  utilities  such  as  water  and  waste  management  after  the  energy  sector \nregulatory reform is completed. \n\n \nSubprogram 3 is expected to support legislation to improve labor market functioning while \n19. \nsafeguarding employee rights, as well strengthening of the national energy bill. The government \nplans  to  improve  its  accounting  procedures  with  Pacific  Financial  and  Technical  Assistance \nCentre support. ADB TA will help upgrade the financial management system.17 \n \n20. \nOutput 3: A more dynamic and inclusive economy supported. Business environment \nreforms  under  subprogram  1  included  public  enterprise  governance  improvements  and \ncommercialization of the Tonga Water Board. ADB provides advisory services through the Pacific \nPrivate Sector Development Initiative for these outputs.18 \n\nForeign investment. Foreign direct investment in Tonga is currently about 2.8% \nof GDP and is encumbered by burdensome and complex legislation. ADB\u2019s earlier \nbudget  support  saw  the  development  of  a  new  investment  policy,  which  was  a \npreliminary  step.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  cabinet  has  approved  foreign \ninvestment  legislation  that  makes  it  easier  to  invest  in  Tonga.  The  Foreign \nInvestment (Amendment) Bill includes (a) a clearer definition of what constitutes \nforeign  investment,  (b)  new  principles  and  procedures  to  manage  reserved  and \nrestricted lists, (c) transparent procedures for vetting potential investments, and (d) \na requirement for foreign investors to report the status of their investments annually. \nThrough rationalized restrictions, the bill is expected to generate increased interest \nfrom foreign investors, by signaling that the government is serious about cutting \nred tape and by improving the potential profitability of investing in Tonga. \nReceivership.  To  facilitate  insolvency  proceedings,  the  cabinet  approved  the \nReceivership  Bill  in  2013  to  establish  a  process  for  identifying  and  nominating \nreceivers  and  establishing  clear  receivership  procedures. 19  Following  delayed \nParliament approval in September 2015, the receivership act was tabled to the \nPrivy  Council  in  October  2015.  After  a  Privy  Council  decision  directed  the \ngovernment  to  note  the  grievances  concerning  asset  acquisition  detailed  in  a \npetition to the King of Tonga, the government held four rounds of consultations \nwith petitioners to address their concerns, which were amicably resolved with no \nchanges to the bill\u2019s provisions. Under subprogram 2, the cabinet approved the \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for Pacific Economic Management (Phase 2).

A receiver is a person or manager who is appointed \nthrough terms of agreement or by an order from the Supreme Court. \n\n\f7 \n\n(iii) \n\nact for resubmission to the Privy Council. A bankruptcy policy will be prepared \nafter the act is proclaimed and published in the government gazette. \nPublic  enterprises.  Subprogram  2  continued  a  successful  reform  program  to \nimprove  the  financial  viability  of  the  government\u2019s  overall  SOE  portfolio.  The \ncabinet  directed  the  Ministry  of  Public  Enterprises  to  proceed  with  a  sale  of \ngovernment shares in Tonga Cable Limited (TCL). The government holds 82% of \nTCL shares, and the Tonga Communications Corporation, another SOE, holds the \nremainder. The government has approved the sale of 18% of its shares to Digicel, \ntreatment  of \na  private \ntelecommunications  operators  and  competitive  pricing.  In  addition,  Tonga \nCommunications Corporation has commissioned asset and enterprise valuations \nas  a  required  step  to  partial  privatization,  recognizing  the  need  for  strategic \npartnerships  in  capital  and  expertise  to  better  meet  the  demands  of  a  growing \nmarket for data through mobile and fixed-line internet connections. \n\ntelecommunications  operator, \n\nto  ensure  equal \n\n \n21. \nSubprogram  3  is  expected  to  support  better  credit  information  by  mandating  credit \nreporting,  with TA from JPRM  partners.  Subprogram  3  will  also  support  the  revision  of foreign \ninvestment regulations, including reserved and restricted lists, and work permit rules to support \nforeign  investment  legislation  approved  under  subprogram  2.  Other  areas  for  support  include \ncontinuing successful public enterprise reforms. Work on a private sector development strategy \nto  guide  reforms  over  the  medium  term  is  under  way  and  targeted  to  be  finalized  during \nsubprogram 3. ADB will continue TA through the Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative. \n \n22. \nOutput  4:  Effective  response  to  disasters  supported.  Subprogram  1  supported  a \nresponse plan to alleviate the hardship and secure the livelihoods of the populations affected by \nTropical Cyclone Winston. While this output area is not part of the triggers for subprograms 2 and \n3, it has allowed Tonga to address damage in the Vava\u2019u group of islands. Although reconstruction \nwork is behind the ambitious schedule envisaged in the initial 6-month response plan, activities \nundertaken  so  far  include  crop  rehabilitation  and  disaster-proofing  community  shelters.  The \nrebuilding of damaged schools has also commenced. \n \nD. \n \n23. \nExcluding  grants,  the  fiscal  deficit  in  FY2017  is  estimated  to  be  $23.8  million  (5.3%  of \nGDP). Grants in FY2017 are expected to total $15.1 million, of which $10.3 million is confirmed \nbudget support. ADB will contribute $2.3 million in budget support grants. Budget support grants \nalso include $2.1 million from the European Union, $3.1 million from the Government of Australia, \n$1.1 million  from  the  Government  of  New  Zealand,  and  $1.7  million  from  the  World  Bank,  as \nparallel collaborative partner financing not administered by ADB.20 This will leave a deficit of $8.7 \nmillion  (1.9%  of GDP)  in  FY2017, financed  partly through  budget  support  loans  of  $6.0 million \n($2.7 million from ADB and $3.3 million from the World Bank). Concessional project loans and \ndomestic bonds will fill the remaining fiscal gap of $2.7 million for FY2017. Excluding grants, the \nestimated fiscal deficit is $24.4 million in FY2018 and $25.6 million in FY2019. Grants of $18.6 \nmillion in FY2018 and $20.0 million in FY2019 will partly finance these deficits. Of these grants, \n$10.9 million is expected in the form of annual budget support (including $2.3 million from ADB). \nThe rest will be filled by $5.0 million in annual budget support loans (including $2.7 million from \nADB) and from external project financing and domestic borrowing. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n20 The World Bank\u2019s policy matrix for its parallel project, the Second Inclusive Growth Development Policy Operation, \nsupports eight of the nine prior policy actions for subprogram 2 in ADB\u2019s policy matrix (Appendix 4). The action on \ncabinet approval of the Receivership Bill (para. 20) appears only in the ADB policy matrix. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe government has requested (i) a concessional loan in various currencies equivalent to \n24. \nSDR2.026 million  ($2.75 million  equivalent) 21 from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  and (ii)  a \ngrant22 not  exceeding  $2.25  million  from  ADB's  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development \nFund) to help finance subprogram 2. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period \nof  8  years;  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement. The loan and \ngrant proceeds will finance expenditures under subprogram 2, excluding ineligible items,23 and \nwill be withdrawn, upon effectiveness, following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as \namended from time to time). \n \nE. \n \nThe existing institutional structure for aid management in Tonga will be used to implement \n25. \nand  monitor  the  policy  actions  supported  by  the  program.  The  government\u2019s  Budget  Support \nManagement  Committee,  which  leads  the  JPRM  process,  oversees  the program. Through  the \ncommittee,  the  MFNP  will  provide  overall  guidance  and  assume responsibility  for  coordinating \nprogram  implementation,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  as  the  executing  agency.  The  Ministry  of \nCommerce,  Consumer,  Trade,  Innovation  and  Labour;  Ministry  of  Meteorology,  Energy, \nInformation,  Disaster  Management,  Climate  Change  and  Communications;  Ministry  of  Public \nEnterprises; Ministry of Revenue and Customs; and Prime Minister\u2019s Office are the implementing \nagencies. Government authorities have confirmed this arrangement. \n \n26. \nSubprogram  2  is  implemented  from  July  2016  to  June  2017.  Implementation  of \nsubprogram 3 is tentatively scheduled from July 2017 to June 2018, in line with Tonga\u2019s budget \ncycle. The policy matrix details the program framework, including the policy actions completed \nbefore  Board  consideration  of  subprograms  1  and  2,  and  those  indicatively  proposed  for \nsubprogram 3. Subprogram 3 will be presented for Board consideration after appropriate policy \nactions are completed. The JPRM process will continue to facilitate broad consultations on reform \npriorities. Government authorities will lead consultations on individual reform initiatives, which will \nbe discussed with private sector and civil society as needed.24 \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n27. \nThe  reforms  will  build  Tonga\u2019s  macroeconomic  resilience  and  ability  to  respond  to \neconomic  shocks.  Envisaged  reform  impacts  include  allocative  efficiency  gains  from  the \nrebalancing of expenditure to priority areas. Increased domestic revenue from tax changes (para. \n16)  and  higher  returns  (or  less  fiscal  drain)  from  more  efficient  SOEs  (para.  20)  will  gradually \nreduce future development financing needs. A declining wage bill will also contribute to a better \nfiscal position (para. 16). Increased macroeconomic resilience will reduce the negative impact of \nexternal shocks, including on growth and service delivery.25 \n                                                 \n21 SDR0.7366 = $1.00 as of 10 April 2017. \n22 A country's eligibility for ADF grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its risk of debt distress. The \nlatest  debt  sustainability  analysis  determined  that  Tonga  had  a moderate  risk  of debt  distress  and  was  therefore \neligible to receive 50% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n\n23 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Consultations are planned around the energy bill, foreign investment legislation, and the private sector strategy. \n25 Macroeconomic resilience comprises fiscal health (i.e., manageable fiscal deficits and public debt levels), adequate \nPFM  systems  and  regulation  for  efficient  and  effective  service  delivery,  sufficient  cash  and  foreign  reserves  to \nrespond to external shocks, and a growing and gradually diversifying economic base. The last element is supported \nby reforms to streamline foreign investment. \n\n\f9 \n\nGovernance \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nB. \n \n28. \nPromoting good governance is a key national priority. The government is implementing its \nPFM  reform  road  map,  FY2015\u2013FY2019,  to  close  gaps  identified  through  two  PFM \nassessments. 26  Despite  capacity  limitations  stemming  largely  from  its  small  size,  the \nassessments  indicate  that,  compared  with  international  best  practice,  Tonga\u2019s  PFM  system  is \nmostly operating at average levels. The assessments indicate that the government has the ability \nto implement its budget but there are procurement, accounting, financial reporting, and auditing \nweaknesses. This program, complemented by development partner TA (footnote 6), addresses \nthose weaknesses. Tonga has taken steps to strengthen anticorruption measures, including by \ncreating  the  Parliament  Standing  Committee  on  Anti-Corruption  in  2015.  Consultations  on \nappointing  an  independent  anticorruption  commissioner  are  ongoing. 27  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) has been explained to and discussed with the government. \nADB  will  incorporate further anticorruption-related  activities,  as feasible and  appropriate,  in TA \nsupport under subprogram 3. \n \nC. \n \n29. \nExtreme poverty is rare in Tonga, but material deprivation is an issue. The public sector \nis a key provider of infrastructure and services to low-income households, and output 1 will help \nensure that the government has the fiscal resources to respond to future economic shocks and \nnatural  disasters  (which  tend  to  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the  poor)  while  maintaining  critical \npublic services. The government\u2019s expenditure program includes increased allocations to social \nsectors and infrastructure. Output 2 will increase private sector competition and ensure effective \nregulation,  and make  basic goods  and  services affordable.  More  effective  electricity  regulation \nshould  lead  to  lower  prices  and  improved  service  delivery,  benefiting  the  materially  deprived \nsections. Output 3 will improve the environment for private sector activity, which would help bring \nmore  jobs  and  opportunities  to  Tonga.  While  subprogram  2  is  classified  as  having  no  gender \nelements,  subprogram  3  will  support  women\u2019s  labor  market  access  and  rights,  and  women\u2019s \nparticipation in the private sector through provisions under the Employment Relations Bill and the \nprivate sector development strategy already under preparation.28 \n \nD. \n \n30. \nFollowing  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  subprogram  2  is  classified  as \ncategory  C  for  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  Program \nactivities  will  be  confined  to  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  No  activity  will  result  in  or  lead  to \ninvoluntary resettlement, or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \nE. \n \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail in \nthe  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.29 PFM  systems  are  assessed  as  capable  of \nsupporting mostly reliable services. The remaining fiduciary risks will be addressed through policy \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                 \n26 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability. 2010.

Technical \nassistance will be mobilized by development partners on a \nneeds basis to supplement capacity. \nDevelopment partners will hold regular coordination discussions \nwith the government to identify and bridge gaps. \nThe government will finance the Pacific Games from domestic \nrevenues, grants, and corporate sponsorship, with a moratorium \non nonconcessional debt. The fiscal targets introduced under \nthe program include a debt ceiling.  \nA stronger fiscal position and a more diversified private sector \nreduce external vulnerability. The government will seek \nadditional development partner assistance in case of disasters. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nThe government and the MFNP have assured ADB that implementation of the program \n32. \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail \nin the loan and grant documents.
