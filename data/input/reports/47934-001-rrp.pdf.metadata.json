Access  to finance  is  the foremost  constraint for  Mongolian  MSMEs\u201430%  of \nsmall  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  in  Mongolia  perceive  access  to  finance  as  the \nlargest  issue  for  their  operations.2 It  is  estimated  that  only  10%  of  about  37,000  Mongolian \nSMEs regularly access finance through banks.3 A World Bank study notes that when finance is \navailable  to  SMEs,  loan terms  and  conditions  are  characterized  by  high  interest  rates,  shorter \nmaturities,  and  smaller  amounts  that  do  not  meet  the  full  financial  needs  of  these  companies \nand primarily require immovable collateral (footnote 2).  Overall, bank lending has continued to \nincrease  since  the  global  financial  crisis  of  2008\u20132009.  However,  a  marked  gap  remains  in \nterms of funding needs for the numerous MSMEs, as many banks continue to focus on top-tier, \nlarger companies, which are perceived to be of less risk.4  \n \nGiven  the  access  to  finance  issues  in  Mongolia  for  MSMEs,  the  Asian  Development \n3. \nBank (ADB) met with several banks in 2013 to identify suitable candidates with the interest and \nability to serve the SME segment, and to reach the microenterprise segment. Additionally, ADB \nsought banks that could effectively address the needs  of MSMEs, with outreach to rural areas \noutside  Ulaanbaatar.  Rural  areas  tend  to  have  higher  incidences  of  poverty  in  Mongolia.5 The \nbank has  a  sound  credit  profile,  strategic focus on  MSMEs,  and  the  largest  branch  network  in \nrural  areas.  Khan  Bank  has  a  developed  and  growing  MSME  platform,  and  has  received \ntechnical  advisory  services  from  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  for \nthe  creation  of  institutional  structures,  and  training  and  education  programs  designed  for  local \nstaff.  The  proposed  assistance  builds  on  an  ADB  nonsovereign  loan  amounting  to  $10 million \nprovided  to  Khan  Bank  in  2007,  which  was  general  in  nature.6 As  the  bank  has  matured  and \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   World Bank. 2012. Financial Sector Assessment: Mongolia. Washington, DC.  \n3  The World Bank Enterprise Surveys. http://www.enterprisesurveys.org/. Other constraints noted were the tax rate, \ninadequately  educated  workforce,  informal  sector  practices,  political  instability,  and  licensing  and  permitting \nproblems.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2  \n \n\n \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\nfinancing  needs  of  MSMEs  have  emerged,  the  assistance  will  target  this  important  customer \nsegment. Fitch Ratings has rated Khan Bank\u2019s long-term issuer default ratings B (stable).7 \n \nB. \n \n4. \nOverview.  Khan Bank, established in 1991, is Mongolia\u2019s largest bank in terms of total \nassets,  loans,  and  deposits\u2014with  market  shares  of  23%  (assets),  23%  (loans),  and  26% \n(deposits) in 2013. The bank, previously known as the Agriculture Bank of Mongolia, was owned \nby  agricultural  cooperatives,  herdsmen,  and  farmers.  It  was  privatized  in  2003  and  renamed \nKhan  Bank  in  a  post-Soviet  effort  to  privatize  the  banking  sector.  Although  privatized,  it \ncontinues to maintain a focus on reaching the underserved in rural areas with inclusive finance \nas  a  priority  in  strategy  and  planning.  Khan  Bank  has  335  ATMs,  accounting  for  34%  of  all \nATMs  in  Mongolia,  and a  branch network  of  528  (100 in Ulaanbaatar  and 428 in  rural  areas), \nproviding banking services to at least 62% of households in Mongolia (1.8 million customers out \nof  a  population  of  2.9  million).8 The  bank  is  also  the  largest  single  employer  in  the  financial \nsector with 5,000 employees. Female staff represented 63% of total employees in 2013.  \n \nKhan  Bank\u2019s  principal  activities  are  corporate  and  MSME  lending,  as  well  as  retail  and \ninstitutional  lending. 9  Product  lines  include  a  range  of  loan  and  deposit  products,  foreign \nexchange, trade finance, cash management, and international payment services.  \n \n5. \nKhan  Bank\u2019s  current  MSME  portfolio  is  well  diversified  in  terms  of  sectors,  comprising \nmainly  trade  and  commerce,  construction,  agriculture,  and  transportation  loans.  Khan  Bank \nbegan  officially  segregating  its  lending  to  MSMEs  in  2000.  A  separate  SME  center  was \nestablished  in  2010,  which  enabled  a  more  focused  approach  to  MSME  lending.10 Through  its \nexpanded  branch  network,  Khan  Bank  plans  to  offer  new  products,  such  as  working  capital, \ntrade  finance,  and  capital  expenditure  financing  through  electronic  and  mobile  banking  to \npromote cost efficiencies. As part of its strategy, Khan Bank intends to implement a structured \ncustomer acquisition process, maximize cross-sale opportunities, and position Khan Bank as a \ntotal solutions provider to the MSME segment.  \n \n6. \nKhan  Bank  tailors  its  relationship  management  approach  and  product  offering  to  each \nsubsegment. In addition, Khan Bank has established a business incubator center in 2006, which \nprovides  practical  assistance  to  improve  business  management  skills,  connects  MSMEs  to \ndesired partners, provides updated information to enable them to make business decisions, and \nhelps to maintain long and stable relations with these businesses.  \n \nC. \n \n7. \nOwnership. The largest shareholder of Khan Bank is Sawada Holdings (Japan), which \nowns  41.3%  of  the  bank\u2019s  capital.

The current average \nloan size is MNT36 million. \n\n10 Seven SME centers\u2014five in Ulaanbaatar and two in the largest rural areas (Darkhan and Erdenet)\u2014specialize in \n\nproviding banking services to MSMEs, with higher authorization levels and more specialized staff.  \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nExchange and has total assets of $3.0 billion as of December 2013.

The  three  board  committees\u2014audit  committee,  risk  management  committee,  and \ngovernance and remuneration committee\u2014are chaired by board directors.  \n \nD. \n \nKhan  Bank  has  had  healthy  growth  from  2010  to  2013.  Total  assets  grew  from \n11. \n$1,125 million in 2010 to $2,904 million in 2013, representing a compound annual growth rate of \n37.18%. Gross customer loans grew from $568 million in 2010 to $1,502 million in 2013. Total \ncustomer deposits grew at a robust pace of 22.7% (3-year compound annual growth rate) from \n$955 million in 2010 to $1,763 million in 2013. Financial highlights of Khan Bank are provided in \nthe financial analysis.13 \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n \n12. \nEarnings. In 2013, net income was MNT96.7 billion, which represented a growth rate of \n35% from MNT71.4 billion in 2012. The increase can be attributed to the increase in net interest \nincome  (29.4%  in  2013  and  19.2%  in  2012)  as  a  result  of  the  growth  in  the  loan  portfolio \nresulting  from  effective  marketing  and  sales  efforts  and  Khan  Bank\u2019s  reputation.  Despite  the \nfalling  interest  rate  environment,  the  net  interest  margin  was  still  healthy  (6.8%  in  2013  and \n8.0%  in  2012)  across  all  business  segments.  Operating  efficiency  improved  despite  branch \nexpansion,  training,  and  adaptation  to  new  information  software  (cost-to-income  ratio  was \n46.3% in 2013 and 52.7% in 2012). In 2013, return on average assets (ROAA) was 2.5% and \nreturn  on  average  equity  (ROAE)  was  34.0%.  This  was  above  the  banking  sector  average \n(2.17% ROAA and 28% ROAE) and is the highest among its peers.  Khan Bank has managed to \n\n                                                \n11 D.  Hulan  is  a  citizen  of  Mongolia  and  is  a  founder  and  shareholder  of  Tavan  Bogd  Group.  Since  2003,  she  has \n\nbeen the executive vice-president of Tavan Bogd Group. \n\n12 Ownership, Management, and Governance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f4  \n \n\n \n\nmaintain a stable ROAA of above 2.5% and an ROAE of at least 30% in 2011\u20132013 because of \nits leading position in the market as well as its well diversified deposit and loan portfolio. \n \n13. \nCapitalization.  Khan  Bank  had  a  tier  1  capital  adequacy  ratio  (CAR)  of  11.1%  and  a \ntotal  CAR  of  16.6%  in  2013  (2012:  tier  1  CAR,  10.8%,  total  CAR,  16.6%).  The  bank\u2019s \ncapitalization was above that of its peers, which had an average CAR of 15.5% in 2013 resulting \nfrom an increase in subordinated debt obtained from IFC. The total CAR year-end results were \nsimilar  to  2012  and  the  bank  met  the  new  regulatory  requirements  of  tier  1  CAR  of  9.0%  and \ntotal  CAR  of  14.0%,  which  came  into  effect  on  30  June  2013.  Total  growth  in  capital  was \nsupported  by  retained  earnings  and  new  subordinated  debt  provided  by  FMO  and  DEG \namounting  to  $32  million  in  2012  and  most  recently  $40  million  from  IFC,  which  were  fully \ndisbursed in March 2014.  \n \n14. \nFunding and liquidity structure. In 2013, Khan Bank\u2019s funding structure comprised the \nfollowing:  customer  deposits  (64.7%),  short-term  borrowings  (16.3%),  long-term  borrowings \n(11.4%),  equity  and  retained  earnings  (7.0%),  and  others  (0.6%).  Customer  deposits  grew  by \n34% in 2013 (14.4% in 2012), which was slightly above the sector average growth rate of 32% \nin 2013.14 It also receives specialized funding, as do the other large banks, from the government \nto provide subsidized funding to SMEs active in specific industries (e.g., meat and flour), as well \nas for home loans. This funding comprised 19% of total liabilities as of December 2013. Khan \nBank  has  existing  credit  lines  with  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development, \nFMO, and IFC, and trade finance facilities with ADB; and will continue to maintain and develop \nrelationships with local and international commercial banks. In 2013, Khan Bank\u2019s cash reserve \nratio  was  15.8%  (14.7%  in  2012)  and  its  liquidity  ratio  (liquid  assets  as  a  percentage  of  total \nassets)  was  46%  (34.6%  in  2012).  Both  were  compliant  with  the  Bank  of  Mongolia  (BOM) \nminimum requirement of 12% (cash reserve ratio)15 and 25% (liquidity ratio).  \n \n15. \nLoan  portfolio. Khan Bank\u2019s total loan portfolio of MNT2,484.8 billion as of December \n2013  is  segmented  as  follows:  corporate  banking  (20%),  MSME  (26%),  and  retail  (54%).  In \n2013,  gross  loans  were  concentrated  in  (i)  consumption  loans\u2014including  salary,  pension, \nleasing,  mortgage,  and  employee  loans  (49%);  (ii)  trade  and  finance  (16%);  (iii) construction \n(10%);  (iv)  agriculture  (3%);  (v)  industrial  (8%);  (vi)  mining  (4%);  and  (vii)  others  (10%). \nGeographically, the portfolio is in Ulaanbaatar (55%) and rural areas (45%). As more branches \nopen in rural areas, demand for banking services is expected to increase. 16   \n \n16. \nExposure  to the top  20 group obligors  is moderate,  at  17.3% (18.2%  in 2012)  of gross \nloans  in  2013.  The  largest  single  borrower  accounted  for  12%  of  the  total  exposure  to  top \n20 borrowers;  and  is  a  large  Mongolian  conglomerate  whose  operations  are  mainly  in  retail, \nwholesale  trade,  manufacturing,  and  construction.  Exposure  to  the  largest  individual  and/or \ngroup accounted for 12.5% of the bank\u2019s total capital, which is below the 20% regulatory limit. \nLoans to related parties amounted to MNT17.9 billion and accounted for 3.8% of total capital in \n2013  (6.4%  in  2012).  Related  party  loans  are  to  Tavan  Bogd  and  its  affiliates  as  well  as  key \nmanagement personnel.  \n \n\n                                                \n14 ADB\u2019s Mongolia Resident Mission; Bank of Mongolia.

Nonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  were \n17. \nreported  at  1.5%  of gross  loans  in  2013  (0.9%  in  2012),  which is  below  the  sector  average of \n5.3%  (4.2%  in  2012).17 NPLs  of  MSMEs  amounted  to  1%  in  2013  (0.9%  in  2012).  Khan  Bank \nplans  to  maintain  its  total  gross  NPL  ratio  below  5%  at  all  times.  Khan  Bank  uses  the  BOM \nstandard  loan  classification  specification.18 Since  2012,  Khan  Bank\u2019s  loan  loss  coverage  ratio \nhas been above 100%.19  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nA. \n \n18. \nADB  proposes  to  provide  a  senior  unsecured  $40  million  loan for  a  tenor  of  5  years to \nKhan Bank for the exclusive purpose of funding MSMEs in Mongolia. The borrower shall use the \nproceeds to extend new loans to eligible MSME sub-borrowers.20  \n \nB. \n \n19. \nKhan  Bank  will  provide  ADB  with  development  effectiveness,  safeguards,  financial \nreports,  and  MSME  loan  portfolio  information  at  predetermined  regular  intervals  and  as \nrequested.  ADB  will  review  these  reports  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  monitor  the  facility \naccordingly.  Monitoring  reports  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB\u2019s  Office  of  Risk \nManagement  on  a  regular  basis,  but at  least  annually.21 The first  such report  will  be  submitted \nno later than 12 months after Board approval.  \n \nC. \n \n20. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nADB\u2019s value addition is expected to be the following: \n(i) \n\nThe  financial  sector  in  Mongolia  is  underdeveloped.  The  country\u2019s  capital \nmarkets  are  nascent  and  commercial  bank  funding  is  not  readily  available  in \nlarge amounts. Moreover, loans with longer tenors are particularly in short supply. \nAs  a  result,  domestic  credit  provided  by  the  banking  sector  was  36.8%  and,  as \nsuch,  the  country  lags  behind  its  peers.22 Mongolia  has  also  been  impacted  by \nthe  banking  sector  crisis  in  Europe,  as  European  commercial  banks  and \ninvestors have curtailed their lending. This has resulted in a shortage of funding. \nHence,  international  financial  institutions  are  needed  to  fill  this  funding  gap. \nADB\u2019s longer tenor loan will address a funding gap estimated to total $223 million \nby 2016, and help the bank to reduce asset\u2013liability mismatches as it will, in turn, \nprovide longer-tenor funding to MSMEs. \nAccess to credit remains one of the most critical obstacles to the development of \nthe  MSME  sector.  ADB  assistance  will  help  to  address  this  gap  and  support  a \nbank  that  is  active  in  MSME  lending  through  (i)  the  provision  of  long-term \nfinancing, which will result in more private businesses serving the local economy, \n\n(ii) \n\n                                                \n17 Average NPLs were 4.6% in 2009\u20132013. \n18 Joint Resolution of the Governor of the Bank of Mongolia and the Minister of Finance. 2010.

Mongolia\u2019s  economy  is  largely  reliant  on  the \nagricultural and mining sectors. It is also exposed to the slowing growth in the People\u2019s Republic \nof China. Recent high inflation and the depreciating currency have further exposed the banking \nsector to economic and policy risks. Solid economic growth prospects, together with progress in \neconomic  stabilization  and  an  open,  market-led  economy,  partly  mitigate  these  weaknesses. \nThe  banking  industry  is  viewed  as  having  an  underdeveloped  regulatory  framework\u2014lacking \nstrict  enforcement  of  regulatory  requirements.  Transparency  and  disclosure  are  considered \nweak  by  international  standards.  However,  authorities  have  taken  measures  to  tighten \nprudential regulations on capital requirements, asset classification, and loss provisions. To help \nmitigate  the  risks  imposed  by  the  operating  environment,  Khan  Bank  carefully  manages  its \ncapital  position,  keeps  a  significant  liquidity  buffer,  and  maintains  a  diversified  and  highly \ngranular loan portfolio with prudent sector and borrower concentration limits.  \n \n22. \nmore slowly, asset quality may deteriorate. However, Khan Bank has a comprehensive risk \nmanagement system that defines, assesses, and monitors risks. \n \n\nAsset quality. As Khan Bank\u2019s portfolio expands and the economy continues to grow \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n \nA. \n \n23. \nImpacts.  ADB  assistance  will  lead  to  (i)  increased  contribution  of  MSMEs  to  gross \ndomestic product; and (ii) increased access to credit by MSMEs in Mongolia. Growth of MSMEs \nin  non-mineral-based  resource  sectors  will  help  diversify  and  strengthen  the  resilience  of  the \neconomy.  \n \n24. \nOutcome.  The  outcome  will  be  the  growth  and  sustainability  of  Khan  Bank\u2019s  financial \nservices to MSMEs. Khan Bank\u2019s MSME loan portfolio is expected to grow beyond the level of \nADB\u2019s funding. Providing financing to MSMEs through loans for working capital and investment \nwill contribute to job creation, capital formation, and asset creation, including through loans for \nagriculture.  \n \n25. \nBank; and (ii) increased tenor of MSME loans.  \n \nB. \n \n26. \nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and country strategy. Under Strategy 2020, ADB will \npromote  inclusive  growth  at  the  regional  and  national  levels  by  helping  to  develop  financial \n\nOutputs. The outputs will be the (i) increased availability of MSME financing from Khan \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\ninfrastructure,  institutions,  and  products  and  services. 23  Through  such  initiatives,  ADB  will \ncontinue  to  assist  in  channeling  the  region\u2019s  savings  into  the  most  productive  investments,  as \nwell as build the capacity of financial institutions by introducing international best practices. ADB \nassistance supports institutional and financial sector development through the deepening of the \nfinancial  sector  by  increasing  the  ability  of  Khan  Bank  to  expand  lending  to  MSMEs  and  by \nstrengthening the bank\u2019s capital base.  \n \n27. \nThe country partnership strategy for Mongolia highlights private sector development as a \ndriver of change, and states that ADB will help strengthen financial markets to support long-term \ninvestment,  innovation,  and  access  to  finance.24 The  strategy  also  notes  that  access  of  SMEs \nand the rural population to formal sources of credit is limited. ADB\u2019s financial sector assessment \nfor Mongolia concludes that broader and deeper financial intermediation is necessary to achieve \nsustainable,  long-term  growth. 25 The  finance  sector  assessment  recommends  the  continued \ndevelopment of the finance sector and improvements in access to finance. The proposed loan is \nalso  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  SME  development  program  targeting  SME  capacity \ndevelopment and job creation. \n \n28. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  An  independent \nevaluation  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance to the  financial  sector  was  conducted  in 2008.26 Based  on  the \nanalysis  conducted  and \nfinancial  sector, \nfuture  challenges  and  opportunities \nrecommendations were put forward for future operations. These included (i) considering equity \ninvestments  and  loans  to  strengthen  the  operational  capacity  of  Mongolian  banks;  (ii)  using \nbanks to channel credit to address the gap in the supply of rural finance; (iii) providing longer-\nterm loans to meet the needs of MSMEs; and (iv) supporting the development of nonbank and \ncapital market sectors. The proposed assistance to Khan Bank is therefore consistent with the \nrecommendations put forward in this evaluation. \n \n\nthe \n\nin \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n29. \nThe  investment  is  classified  category  FI  for  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  investment\u2019s  potential  environment  and  social \nimpacts,  its  risks  associated  with  Khan  Bank\u2019s  existing  and/or  likely  future  portfolio,  and  its \ncommitment  and  capacity  for  environmental  and  social  management,  have  been  assessed. \nKhan Bank will apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list,  ensure that investments using \nADB  funds  abide  by  applicable  national  laws  and  regulations,  comply  with  ADB  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009),  and  establish  and  maintain  an  appropriate  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system satisfactory to ADB before disbursement for the financing of investments. \nADB  funds  will  exclude  financing  of  subprojects  classified  category  A  for  environment,  and \ncategory A and B for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples safeguards.27 \n \n\n                                                \n23 ADB.  2008.
