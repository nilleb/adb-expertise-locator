THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nequity investment of up to $1,000,000 in a company to be formed to act as the general partner \nof the Climate Public\u2013Private Partnership Fund; (ii) a proposed equity investment of up to \n$1,000,000 in a company to be formed to act as the special limited partner of the fund; and (iii) a \nproposed  equity  investment  as  a  limited  partner  in  the  fund  of  up  to  the  balance  of \n$100,000,000, less the amounts contributed under items (i) and (ii). \n \nII.  THE FUND \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n2.  Description. The fund is envisaged to invest in environmental finance in Asia. The fund \nwill use a unique platform that combines private sector investment expertise with development \nfinance institutions to provide equity, debt, and grant facilities to climate- and environment-\nrelated sectors in the developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). ADB will invest up to 25% in the general partner of the fund, provide extensive services \nunder a service agreement to assist the fund manager in day-to-day operations, and invest as a \nlimited partner in the fund.1  \n \n3.  Investment identification. The fund\u2019s concept was initially driven by the interest of a set \nof large institutional investors, who view climate change challenges in Asia as a compelling \ninvestment opportunity. On four occasions during 2007\u20132009, the Prince of Wales convened \nsome of the world\u2019s largest public pension funds, which collectively represent approximately  \n$3 trillion of assets, with key experts to discuss and develop investment strategies for tackling \nclimate change risks. Inspired by existing and possible models, these investors approached the \nDepartment for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom and then ADB to \ncollaborate with them to design an innovative, commercially viable vehicle for climate and \nenvironmental finance investment in developing Asia.2  \n \n4.

Policymakers include \nthe International Investors Group on Climate Change, the UNEP Finance Initiative, the Global Leadership for \nClimate  Action,  and  the  Group  of  8  (G8).  Reference  documents  include:  2009.  Mobilizing  Private  Sector \nInvestments for Clean Energy in Developing Countries.

Ownership, Management, and Governance \n1.  Ownership and management \n \n8.   The fund will be managed by its general partner, a limited liability company to be \nincorporated in a jurisdiction satisfactory to ADB. ADB will hold up to 25% of the equity shares \nof the general partner. The general partner will delegate responsibility for day-to-day operations \nand management of the fund to the fund manager, as is customary.3 The fund manager will \nenter into a service agreement with ADB, pursuant to which ADB will perform certain services \nfor the fund manager. ADB will share day-to-day fund management work and, in consideration \nof the services performed for the fund manager, ADB will be paid a service fee. \n \n9.

ADB\u2019s  private  equity  practice  has  committed  more  than  \n$919 million to 61 private equity fund investments in Asia. As of 30 September 2011, active \ninvestments (vintage years 2001\u20132008) had generated a net return of 9.73% and a multiple of \n1.3 times. ADB has been making investments in low-carbon and resource-efficiency sectors \nsince 2003, and had committed over $144 million to ten funds as of 30 September 2011. ADB \nfund investments that are consistent with the fund\u2019s strategy have generated an aggregate \nunderlying fund net return of 9.0% as of 30 September 2011. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n15.  ADB will provide (i) a proposed equity investment of up to the lesser of $1,000,000 and \n25% of the shares in a company to act as the general partner of the Climate Public\u2013Private \nPartnership Fund; (ii) a proposed equity investment of up to the lesser of $1,000,000 and 25% \nof the shares in a company to act as the special limited partner of the fund; and (iii) a proposed \nequity investment as a limited partner in the fund of up to the balance of $100 million less the \namounts contributed under items (i) and (ii). ADB will also contribute human resources to the \nfund under the terms of a service agreement to be entered into between it and the fund \nmanager. Each of the investee companies (i.e the general partner and the special limited \npartner  entities)  will  be  formed  after  the  date  of  finalization  of  fund  documentation.  The \nremainder of this paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.  \n \n                                                           \n3\n  All of the management and other fees relating to the fund will be paid to the fund manager. ", "3 \n16.   This paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  In keeping with its stake in the general partner and to help ensure the fund\u2019s success, \nADB will take an active role in fund management with the involvement of core and extended \nteams of ADB staff. At the outset, PSOD will dedicate some of its own staff to the fund initiative; \nadditional staff may be deployed over time as the fund\u2019s investments expand. ADB expects to \nemploy additional staff with funds generated by the management fee it receives via the service \nagreement.4  The remainder of this paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive \ninformation. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n18.  The fund initiative is designed around the concept of a partnership between a private \nsector fund manager and a public sector development bank, working in concert to execute the \nfund\u2019s mandate.

A second risk relates to deal flow, and whether the fund can develop a deal \npipeline of the scale needed to support the fund\u2019s investments. The remainder of this paragraph \nhas been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.     \n \n25.  Execution and resource allocation. Risk is associated with the ability to execute the \nfund\u2019s mandate (i.e., source, make, and exit investments; and generate returns for the fund). \nThe remainder of this paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n \n26.  Limit to liability. The general partner will be a limited liability company, and accordingly, \nits shareholders will have the general protection provided by law in respect of limited liability \ncompanies. ADB will ascertain that in the jurisdiction of establishment of the fund and the \ngeneral  partner  (which  jurisdiction  must  be  satisfactory  to  ADB)  no  special  or  potentially \nunlimited liability arises as the result of ADB being an investor in the general partner and, at the \nsame time, a limited partner.  \n \n27.  This paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.    \n \n                                                           \n4\n Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) provides further \ninformation on the funding arrangements.  \n  \n ", "4   \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n28.  Outputs and outcome. The key output of ADB\u2019s investment will be the establishment of \nthe  fund.  The  outcome  will  be  an  increased  number  of  profitable,  well-governed,  and \nenvironmentally  responsible  investee  companies  and  funds  in  environmental  finance.  The \nremainder of this paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n \n29.  This paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n30.  Consistency  with  Strategy  2020.  This  sentence  has  been  redacted  due  to \ncommercially sensitive information.  As such, they are aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which \nseeks to reduce poverty and improve living conditions and quality of life by scaling up private \nsector development and supporting environmentally sustainable models through projects that \naim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change impacts.5   \n  \n31.  Consistency with ADB\u2019s climate change priorities. ADB recently emphasized the \nimportance of technology transfer and diffusion, one of the identified key \"building blocks\" under \ninternational climate change negotiations, to help address energy security and climate change \nin Asia and the Pacific. The President's advisory group on climate change and sustainable \ndevelopment has strongly backed these efforts. The advisory group also emphasized ADB's \npotential catalytic role and urged ADB to help the region to move \"from the abstract to the \nconcrete\" and from incubation to impact. The remainder of this paragraph has been redacted \ndue to commercially sensitive information.   \n \n32.  This paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n \n33.  Consistency with the energy sector strategy. ADB\u2019s 2009 Energy Policy seeks to \nfacilitate a transition to a low-carbon economy and universal access to energy as an important \nstep toward achieving ADB\u2019s vision of a region free of poverty. The objective of the policy is to \nhelp the DMCs provide reliable, adequate, and affordable energy for inclusive growth in a \nsocially, economically, and environmentally sustainable way. To achieve these goals, policy \nimplementation will be based in part on private sector participation to improve energy efficiency \nthrough competition and an increase in investable resources in the DMCs, which is necessary to \nbuild and sustain low-carbon infrastructure. \n \n34.  Consistency with previous operations. ADB recently invested in eight clean energy \nfunds. The remainder of  this  paragraph  has been  redacted  due to  commercially  sensitive \ninformation. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n35.  The  investment  is  classified  under  category  FI  for  impacts  on  the  environment, \n                                                           \n5\n  ADB. 2008.

The fund \nwill ensure that investments using ADB funds are in compliance with applicable national laws \nand  regulations;  apply  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  including  the  prohibited \ninvestment activities list; and establish and maintain an appropriate environmental and social \nmanagement system to manage the impacts and risks adequately.7 Gender aspects of the \ninvestment and the fund\u2019s compliance with core labor standards were considered and agreed \nactions will be monitored during implementation. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n36.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions \nprohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB \nin the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n37.  The proposed transaction, once approved and signed, will increase ADB's projected \nnonsovereign exposure as of 31 December 2012 to $6.02 billion. Additionally, the proposed \ntransaction will increase nonsovereign exposure to the PRC to $1.42 billion or 24% of total \nnonsovereign  exposure,  increase  exposure  to  India  to  $881.7  million  or  15%  of  total \nnonsovereign exposure, and increase nonsovereign exposure to private equity funds to $744 \nmillion or 12% of total nonsovereign exposure. The proposed transaction is within the medium-\nterm, country, industry, and group exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. However, the \nproposed aggregate capital contribution exceeds the $75 million single obligor limit for equity \ninvestments. This sentence has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. In this \nrespect, a waiver of the applicable policy is sought.8 \n \nD.  Assurances \n38.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank,9 each country \nwhere the fund invests will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to ADB\u2019s proposed \ninvestment  in  the  fund.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of \nDirectors.  \n                                                           \n6\n A proposed project is classified as category FI if it involves the investment of ADB funds to, or through, a financial \nintermediary.
