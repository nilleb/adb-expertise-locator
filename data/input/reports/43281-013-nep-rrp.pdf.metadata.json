The report also describes proposed administration \nof  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  be  provided  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  for \nSupport  for  Sustainable  Energy  Management  and  Reforms,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \nNepal faces a mounting energy crisis. Supplies fall well short of demand, the main utility \n2. \noperating  the  system  is  highly  inefficient,  the  policy  environment  is  weak,  and  the  role  of  the \nprivate  sector  is  far  too  small.  The  supply  gap  is  growing,  especially  during  the  dry  season  in \nwinter  (November\u2013April).  Kathmandu,  the  main  consumption  center,  has  blackouts  of  14\u201318 \nhours a day during this season and load shedding almost every day year-round. Supplies in the \nrest  of  the  country  fare  even  worse,  although  an  additional  problem  here  is  a  very  low \nelectrification  rate.  In  the  meantime,  demand  for  electricity  has  been  growing  at  10%  annually. \nThis  supply  gap  forces  consumers  to  use  diesel  generators.  These  are  expensive  and  very \npolluting. Rising diesel imports affect the balance of payments, and the doubling of diesel prices \nover the past 3 years also hurts the income base of people and businesses.1 The supply problem \nis becoming one of the biggest obstacles to economic growth. It curtails investment and trade, \nproductivity, job creation, and the quality of life of most citizens. The proposed project is one of a \nseries  of  similar  investments  to  help  overcome  this  supply  problem.  The project  has  three main \ncomponents: (i) a medium-sized hydropower plant of 140 megawatts (MW) with significant water \nstorage  facilities  and  associated  transmission  lines  to  evacuate  the  generated  power;  (ii)  rural \nelectrification and community development in the project area, and (iii) a reform and restructuring \nplan  for  the  national  utility,  the  Nepal  Electricity  Authority  (NEA).  The  project  site  is  in  the  Seti \nRiver  in  the  Tanahu  district,  about  150  kilometers  (km)  west  of  Kathmandu.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \nSupply,  policy,  and  institutional  gaps.  Nepal\u2019s  total  installed  power  generation \n3. \ncapacity stands at only 706 MW, the majority of which is owned and operated by NEA while the \nprivate sector owns and runs 158 MW.2 This current total national installed capacity represents \nless  than  1.5%  of  the  country\u2019s  theoretical  hydropower  potential.  Furthermore,  this  capacity \nshrinks  to  250\u2013300  MW  during  the  dry  season,  which  also  happens  to  be  the  time  when \ndemand is at its highest (over 1,000 MW). About 85% of the current generation is based on run-\nof-river  schemes,  the  vast  majority  of  which  are  badly  affected  by  water-flow  fluctuations, \nespecially in the dry season. Energy supply is low and very irregular. \n \n4. \nInadequate and unreliable supply is a function of low levels of investment in the past, but \nalso of limited maintenance of assets. Strategic, operational, managerial, and financial flaws at \nNEA  aggravate  this  problem,  itself  accentuated  in  large  part  by  a  poor  business  climate, \nincluding a bad tariff regime (tariffs were revised for the first time in 11 years in July 2012).3 A \nvery low tariff has dented NEA\u2019s financial standing and its ability to cover basic operating costs. \n                                                \n1   Diesel imports averaged 300 million liters a year in 2001\u20132007, but increased to 600 million liters by 2010. Diesel \n\nprices rose from NRs53/liter to NRs97/liter.  \n\n2   23 independent power producers contribute less than 10 MW each.  \n3   This followed the reconstitution of the Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission (ETFC) in September 2011. ETFC is \n\nallowed to regulate only retail tariffs besides generation and transmission pricing.    \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe company is certainly unable to fund new investments, or to maintain the existing network. \nIts operational and financial performance is rather weak. NEA is inefficient, provides low-quality \nservices, and needs major restructuring.4 The private sector needs to be given more and better \nentry points to invest. Government alone will not be able to resolve the energy crisis. It does not \nhave the financial means and the right people to do so. Further, the \u2015investment problem\u2016 is not \nconfined  to  low  generation  capacity.  The  transmission  and  distribution  networks  are  also  in \nurgent  need  of  expansion  and  modernization,  an  expensive  undertaking  at  the  best  of  times. \nOnly  34%  of  the  country\u2019s  households  are  connected  to  the  grid.  This  is  much  lower  in  rural \nareas. The project will help reduce poverty by mitigating the supply and access problems.  \n \n5. \nStrategic  framework.  The  government  has  a  reasonably  good  energy  strategy.  This \ncalls for increased energy security at home, energy exports, greater energy efficiency, and more \nreliance  on  clean  energy.  It  also  calls  for  better  institutional  effectiveness,  a  more  predictable \npolicy environment, and much more private sector involvement. Energy security at home means \nstepping  up  supplies  to  both  urban  and  rural  areas.  Supply  to  urban  areas  will  be  backed  by \nlarge power generation projects like Tanahu. In rural areas, the task entails rural electrification \nand  the  development  of renewable energy  schemes,  including those  based  on  solar  and  wind \npower\u2014or  a  combination  of  the  two  (hybrids)\u2014and  small  run-of-the  river  projects.  Energy \nexports  are  also  a  priority,  although  the  sequencing  of  these  investments  has  been  a  serious \nproblem.  Some  policymakers  want  the  domestic  power  supply  problem  to  be  sorted  out  first. \nOthers  see  the  need  to  invest  in  the  two  types  of  operations  simultaneously.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  agrees  with this  second  approach.  Energy  export  projects  are good \nfor  the  country  and the region. They generate  much-needed  export  revenues  and  create  jobs. \nSeveral export-oriented investments have been under review for some time, so far with limited \nsuccess, largely on account of an unpredictable and unbalanced policy regime, and because of \nmixed  messages  from  the  government.  ADB  has  suggested  investing  in  at  least  one  flagship \nproject to pave the way, preferably under the auspices of the South Asia Subregional Economic \nCooperation program. Naturally, such an investment must target the Indian market. It will imply \nmajor capital outlays, top quality sponsors, and substantial third-party finance. Attracting serious \ninvestors  and  financiers  requires  a  robust  policy  regime.  It  also  requires  the  right  political \nmessages from the government. These two aspects have been missing. In the meantime, ADB \nhas  been  assisting  Nepal  with the formulation  of  this  long-term  energy  strategy.  It  will  also be \nadvising on the definition of key structural reforms and institutional changes. The ADB country \npartnership strategy with Nepal attaches high priority to the sector.5 The government wants ADB \nto do the same under a new strategy now under preparation. \n \nDevelopment partners. ADB is the main player in the energy sector, and will remain so \n6. \nfor  some time.6 But  others  are  also  playing  an  active  role,  in  particular  the Japan  International \nCooperation Agency (JICA). The latter is the main partner in the proposed project alongside the \nEuropean Investment Bank (EIB) and the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD). The World \nBank is considering doing more in the sector, most likely with projects in rural areas. Its affiliate, \nthe  International  Finance  Corporation,  is  much  more  active  and  is  currently  looking  at  both \ndomestic and export-oriented projects, at least one of which could be funded in partnership with \nADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department. Most bilateral development agencies have a keen \ninterest in the sector, even if they do not actually fund projects themselves. Most are concerned \nwith  access  to  energy,  with  issues  related  to  public  financial  management,  institutional \n\n                                                \n4   The  government  approved  in  principle  an  NEA  financial  restructuring  plan  in  2012,  but  this  now  requires \n\nimplementation with concrete detail.  \n\n5   ADB. 2009.

Some of them do finance projects in the sector\u2014at \nleast they have done so in the recent past. Norway is a case in point.  \n \n7. \nSpecial  features.  The  project  meets  basic  readiness  filters,  including  full  engineering \ndesigns,  safeguard  plans,  budget  allocations,  and  advanced  procurement. 7  Another  unique \nfeature  is  the  creation  of  a  special-purpose  company\u2014Tanahu  Hydropower  Limited  (THL)\u2014to \ndevelop  and  run  the  operation  once  it  enters  its  full  commercial  phase.  This  effectively  \u2015ring-\nfences\u2016  the  entire  project  from  NEA,8 whose  capacity  is  in  any  case  overstretched.  NEA  will \ninstead provide an offtake to THL. Another strong feature of the transaction is the outsourcing of \nall  project  supervision  and  coordination  functions  to  a  reputable  and  experienced  international \ncompany.  Actual  project  execution  work  will  be  mostly  done  through  fixed-period  contracts \n(whenever feasible with fixed prices and with performance bonuses and penalties benchmarked \nagainst  budget,  timelines,  and  quality  standards).  Another  special  feature  is  ADB\u2019s  facilitation \nrole throughout the  procurement  process,  including  bid evaluations,  contract  negotiations,  and \ncontractor  payments.  At  the  request  of  the  government  and  THL,  ADB  will  recruit  the  project \nsupervision  advisors  and  other  specialist  consultants, \nfor \nsafeguards, the community development program, sector reforms, and NEA restructuring. This \nADB  facilitation  role  will  underpin  time  efficiencies,  strong  competition,  contractor  quality \nstandards, and full transparency. The government and THL personnel will be fully involved and \ntrained  during  this  process.  Two  other  major  features  are  (i) the  provision  of  capacity \ndevelopment  TA  to  bring  about  much-needed  reforms  in  the  sector  and  the  restructuring  of \nNEA;  and  (ii)  assistance  in  a  possible  sale  of  either  a  minority  or  a  majority  stake  in  THL  to \nreputable international investors.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nthose  responsible \n\nincluding \n\nThe  impact  will  be  expanded  access  to  clean  and  sustainable  energy  in  Nepal.  The \n\n8. \noutcome will be increased efficiency and supply of reliable hydropower energy. \n  \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n9. \nThe  outputs  will  be  (i)  a  140  MW  hydropower  plant  and  related  transmission  system\u2014\n37 km, 220 kilovolts (kV)\u2014made operational; (ii) rural electrification increased (covering 17,636 \nhouseholds);  (iii) community  development  program  in  the  project  area  implemented;  (iv)  NEA \nrestructured;  (v) other  sector  reforms  undertaken;  and  (vi)  an  equity  sale  scheme  for \nhydropower  development  initiated.  The  prospective  sale  of  an  equity  stake  in  THL  will  be \nsubject to market conditions and the execution of transactions. These outputs will be supported \nby the project coupled with the TA.9 \n \nD. \n \n10. \n\nThe project cost is estimated at around $505 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n                                                \n7   ADB.  2010.

Both  loans  will  have  a  32-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan \nand project agreements.10 ADB\u2019s total finance is limited to $150 million.  \n \nThe government has also requested cofinancing from ADFD, EIB, and JICA.11 JICA will \n12. \nfund all the powerhouse facilities, and do so through parallel cofinancing. ADB, ADFD, and EIB \nwill  jointly  finance  the  civil  works.  ADB  will  fund  on  its  own,  or  in  conjunction  with  the \ngovernment,  the  transmission  lines,  the  community  development  and  rural  electrification \nprograms,  and  a  portion  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs. 12 NEA,  THL  and/or  the \ngovernment will make available all counterpart funds on a timely basis. These will be extended \neither through budgetary allocations and/or other arrangements acceptable to ADB. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nAmount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \n\nAsian Development Fund (regular-term loan) \nAsian Development Fund (hard-term loan) \n\nAbu Dhabi Fund for Development  \nEuropean Investment Bank  \nJapan International Cooperation Agency  \nGovernment and/or Nepal Electricity Authority \n\n  \n\nTotal \n\n  \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n150 \n120 \n 30 \n 30 \n 70 \n184 \n 71 \n505 \n\n30 \n24 \n 6 \n6 \n14 \n36 \n14 \n    100 \n\n                                                \n10  The terms and conditions of hard-term and those of regular-term loans in 2013. Both loans will require onlending \n\nand relending arrangements with the government, NEA, and THL.  \n\n11  For effective coordination among the cofinanciers, collaborative cofinancing documents will be signed with each of \nthe  cofinanciers.  ADB,  ADFD,  and  EIB  have  already  negotiated  the  principles  that  will  govern  their  collaboration \nand coordination in respect of the jointly financed procurement package. \n\n12 Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs  will  first  be  funded  by  the  government  and  then  be  reimbursed  by  ADB \nwhen ADB is fully satisfied with the entire processes, including the compensation settlement. These activities will \nbe monitored by selected nongovernment organizations (NGOs). Due diligence on financing of land acquisition and \nresettlement  costs  has  been  conducted  by  experienced  experts  and  is  summarized  in  the  project  administration \nmanual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n\n \n\n\fE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n13. \nTHL  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  hydropower  plant  and  all  associated  works. \nNEA will be the executing agency for the transmission lines and the rural electrification program. \nThe implementation arrangements are described in detail in the project administration manual.13  \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\nArrangements \nJune 2013\u2013June 2020 \n31 December 2020 \n\n(ii)   Executing agencies \n(iii)   Key implementing agencies \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nAdvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nSteering committee \nSecretary, Ministry of Energy (chair) \nJoint secretary, Ministry of Finance; managing directors, THL and NEA; \ngeneral managers (engineering services, grid development, distribution and \nconsumer services), NEA (members) \nTHL and NEA \nTHL and NEA \nTHL and NEA project implementation units \nInternational competitive \nbidding \nNational competitive bidding \nQCBS \nIndividual \nOnly for eligible contract packages and eligible expenditures agreed \nbetween ADB and the government. \nThe ADB loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and under \nother arrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \n\n1 contract \n2,770 person-months \n555 person-months \n\n$0.9 million \n$23.1 million \n$3.9 million \n\n$156.2 million \n\n2 contracts \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  NEA  =  Nepal  Electricity  Authority,  THL  =  Tanahu  Hydropower  Limited,  QCBS  = \nquality- and cost-based selection.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n14. \nProcurement.

This is because it involves funding from ADFD and EIB and thus potentially procurement \nfrom  non-ADB  member  countries.15 At  the  request  of  the  government  and  THL,  consultants \nunder Part D will be recruited directly by ADB under the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). 16  The  project\u2019s  construction  period  is  projected  at \n\n                                                \n13  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  While  the  bidding  documents,  including  any  prequalification  ones,  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  standard  bidding  and \nprequalification criteria for part A, EIB will be ready to assist THL with the publication of any procurement notice in \nthe  Official  Journal  of  the  European  Union.  This  may  require  the  executing  agency  to  insert  the  covenant  on \nintegrity attached as an additional document to be submitted by bidders. \n\n15  As  a  condition  for  ADFD  and  EIB  cofinancing,  both  institutions  require  that  ADB  waives  its  member  country \nprocurement eligibility restrictions, such that countries that are eligible sources of procurement under their financed \nprojects are also eligible sources for procurement in respect of this contract package. In view of this, it is proposed \nthat the ADB Board of Directors approve such a waiver. \n\n16  ADB  will  select  consultants  for  the  relevant  consulting  services  on  the  government's  behalf,  but  the  executing \nagency will negotiate and enter into the agreements pursuant to which the consulting services will be rendered. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n7 years, which includes about 1.5 years for project site development (building access roads and \na bridge to reach the main construction site)17 and the execution of safeguard plans.  \n \n15. \nSupervision. The supervision of the project\u2019s construction phase (7 years), and at least \nthe  first  5  years  of  its  commercial  operations,  needs  help  from  external  experts.  Good \nsupervision is an absolute necessity to ensure that the project is executed on time, on budget, \nand with the right quality standards. There is also a need to ensure that all safeguard plans are \nexecuted properly and on time. ADB will engage the services of specialists to perform this work. \nThe supervision firm will be selected using quality- and cost-based selection procedures set out \nunder ADB guidelines. The selection criteria include proven experience with similar projects, a \n90:10 blend between quality and cost, and the use of in-house staff to manage key tasks. The \nadvisors  will  have  a  dual  reporting  function  to  ADB  and  the  government.  The  mandate  will \ncombine  supervision  with  technical  support  to THL,  particularly  on  reservoir  sedimentation  risk \nmanagement.  Other  project  tasks  include  helping with  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  setting \nup  the  community  development  program,  and  supporting  the  overall  safeguard  work.  The \ngovernment and the executing agencies requested ADB to take advance  actions on contracting \nall these services under ADB guidelines.  \n \n16. \nOther  arrangements.  THL  will  enter  into  a  power  purchase  agreement  with  NEA.  A \ndraft  term  sheet  for  the  agreement  has  been  prepared  and  agreed  between  the  parties.  This \nfollows a cost-reflective tariff principle, a take-or-pay arrangement, appropriate penalty clauses, \nand  an  offtake  payment  security  mechanism.  ADB  will  be  given  a  right  to  review  and  monitor \nthis agreement, including after project completion.  \n \nEquity sale. One special feature of the project is the prospective sale of an equity stake \n17. \nin THL. The government  has requested  ADB to test the market  and  provide  assistance for  an \nequity  sales scheme.  A sale of  this  nature  (either  a majority  or minority  stake)  could generate \nsignificant  capital  to  kick-start  other  investments.  Proceeds  could  also  be  used  to  restructure \nand  recapitalize  NEA.  If  a  minority  stake  is  involved,  the  divestment  program  will  need  to \ncombine the co-ownership with a management contract.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n18. \n Consultants  will  assist  the  definition  and  execution  of  a  reform  program  and  the \nrestructuring  of  NEA.  The  TA  will  fund  these  advisors.  Outputs  will  include  (i)  a  restructuring \nplan  for  NEA,  (ii)  the  development  of  a  tariff  rationalization  mechanism  under  the  Electricity \nTariff  Fixation  Commission  (ETFC),  and  (iii)  the  definition  of  a  private  sector  participation \nprogram.  The  advisors  will  also  work  on  THL  corporate  governance.18 The  TA  is  estimated  to \ncost  $1.5  million,  which  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty \nReduction, and administered by ADB.19 Further funding could be considered at a later stage if \nneeded.  \n \n\n                                                \n17  These contracts will be procured in accordance with the national competitive bidding procedures.  \n18  The  TA  will  help  THL  establish  commercially  oriented  corporate  policies  and  practices  including  safeguards  and \n\n19  Description of Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\ngender aspects. \n\n \n\n\fA. \n\nTechnical  \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nExperienced  international  advisors  carried  out  the  technical  due  diligence  work.  The \n19. \nproject will be the country\u2019s first reservoir hydropower plant with large water storage.20 To ensure \na  sound  least-cost  design,  full  geological  investigations  and  material  tests  were  conducted  over \nrelatively long periods of time. The greatest technical challenge before and after construction will \nbe sedimentation. To mitigate it, the proposed solution is a modern and tested sediment flushing \nsystem. Project design engineers and ADB-funded consultants conducted a hydraulic model test \nwith  computer  simulations  to  establish  the  best  technical  specifications  to  deliver  maximum \ngeneration capacity and minimum impacts on the sediment, water flows, and the environment. \nAnnual  electricity  generation  projections  are  588  gigawatt-hours  (GWh).  This  represents  a  25% \nincrease from the original project studies.21 Because of the natural topographic conditions at the \nproject site, a narrow river and a deep V-shaped valley, the reservoir area will be limited to 7.26 \nsquare kilometers. This meets all technical eligibility requirements under the Clean Development \nMechanism, creating a potential income upside  later during the commercial phase.22 Finally, the \nproject needs a 220 kV transmission line (37 km) and 220 kV substation facilities to evacuate the \ngenerated  power.23 Site  accessibility  is  good,24 as  the  plant  is  close  to  a  major  highway  near \nPokhara, the second-largest city in Nepal.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n20. \nThe financial internal rate of return for the plant and its associated transmission facilities \nis  11.39%,  higher  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital.  The  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn is 18.40% for the overall project.25 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n21. \nThe project will not be part of the NEA structure. THL has already been incorporated with \nits  own  management  structure.  Project  implementation  will  involve  an  independent  panel  of \nexperts to oversee and report on dam safety and safeguards. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government, THL, and NEA. The \nspecific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project \nadministration manual and the loan documents. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n22. \nBased  on  social  and  poverty  surveys  and  assessments  carried  out  in the  project  area, \nADB  devised  a  community  development  strategy  and  program  designed  to  increase  the \n\n                                                \n20  The project involves a 140 m high concrete gravity dam with a total storage capacity of 295 million cubic meters.  \n21  The  annual  generation  was  analyzed  by  a  hydraulic  model,  which  simulated  optimal  operations  of  the  sediment \nflushing  system.  After  10  years,  annual  power  generation  is  expected  to  fall  to  490  GWh.  This  is  because  it  will \ntake  longer to  flush cumulative  sediments.  During  the  operations of  the sediment  flushing,  the  plant  needs  to be \nstalled. \n\n22  The Clean Development Mechanism executive board accepts hydropower plants with power densities greater than \n4 watts per square meter (W/m2), and the restriction of project emissions from the reservoir type can be 10 W/m2. \nThe project has sufficient power density at 19.2 W/m2, making it potentially eligible. \n\n23  The  220  kV  substation  will  be  located  within  the  Bharatpur  substation,  where  the  World  Bank  is  financing  a \ntransmission  link  to  a  new  Hetauda  substation,  leading  to  trunk  transmission  lines  that  can  support  cross-border \ninterconnection.  \n\n24  Access roads will be around 7.3 km. The length of headrace and tailrace tunnels is around 1.4 km.  \n25  Financial Analysis; Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ninvolvement  of  local  communities  in  the  entire  operation,  with  focus  on  women,  children,  and \nsocially  excluded  groups.  This  strategy  and  program  will  deliver  livelihoods  and  improve  the \nquality  of  life  of  communities  residing  in  the  project  area  and  affected  in  a  direct  and  adverse \nmanner,  by  promoting  awareness,  accessibility,  empowerment,  employability,  and  vocational \nskills and microenterprise development. THL will implement the strategy and program with the \nhelp  of  an experienced  nongovernment  organization  (NGO) or  consulting firm  with field-based \npartner NGOs.26 Alongside the strategy, a gender equality and social inclusion action plan has \nbeen developed and will be implemented to empower women and increase their participation as \nwell as their role and status within their families and communities. It is on this account that the \nproject  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.27 Besides  the  strategy  and  the  gender \nequality  and  social  inclusion  action  plan,  the  rural  electrification  component  will  benefit \nhouseholds in the project area and its neighboring districts. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n23. \nOne  of  the  biggest  risks  associated  with  projects  of  this  nature  is  the  treatment  of \nsafeguards.  Besides  extensive  work  to  define  risks  and  solutions,  the  project  preparation \nprocess  involved  a  series  of  consultations  with  affected  communities.  Independent  advisors \ncarried  out  this  due  diligence.  The  project  is  classified  as  complex  and  sensitive  and rated  as \ncategory A for involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and environment. The preparation \nprocess (assessments, consultations, and information) followed ADB\u2019s policies and procedures. \nResettlement  and indigenous peoples  planning frameworks  have been formulated.28 Reservoir \nworks,  access  roads,  project  site  construction,  and  other  operations  such  as  the  erection  of \npower  generation  facilities  will  require  permanent  and  temporary  acquisition  of  private  and \npublic  land,  public  infrastructure  and  resources  such  as  trails,  suspension  bridges,  and \ncommunity forests. Based on project surveys, 758 households will be affected, including 86 that \nare  likely  to  be  physically  displaced. 29  At  least  453  households  (60%  of  total  affected \nhouseholds) are Janajati\u2014an indigenous group forming the dominant population in the project \narea.  These  people  do  not  claim  ancestral  rights  over  the  land  where  they  live  or  earn \nlivelihoods  from  it.  As  a  result,  project  impacts  on  them  are  similar  to  those  in  other  affected \ncommunities. The involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples impacts of the project have \nbeen  taken  into  account  in a draft  resettlement and indigenous  peoples plan,  which combines \ninvoluntary  resettlement  with  indigenous  peoples  planning  issues  and  appropriate  mitigation \nactions. 30  \n \n24. \ninitial \nenvironmental  examination  for  the  hydropower  and  transmission  components.  To  provide \nsupplementary information required by ADB, an environmental addendum and a separate initial \nenvironmental examination for the rural electrification component were also prepared based on \n\nThe  government  approved  an  environmental \n\nimpact  assessment  and \n\n                                                \n26  After  implementation  of  the  strategy,  the  community  development  initiatives  will  be  sustained  in  the  project  area \nthrough royalty allocations from the project revenues to village development committees, through a scheme to be \nregulated under the Local Self-Governance Act 1999.  \n\n27  The action plan has been prepared to optimize benefits for women and socially excluded groups through a range of \nactivities,  such  as  participatory  and  socially  inclusive  consultation  processes;  promotion  of  women\u2019s  equitable \naccess  to  skilled  and  unskilled  work;  rural  electrification  initiatives  that  specifically  target  vulnerable  households \nheaded  by  women;  support  for  women\u2019s  microenterprise  development  initiatives;  establishment  and  training  of \nwomen\u2019s self-help groups; community development and livelihood enhancement for project-affected areas; gender \ntraining; and a monitoring and evaluation system for the action plan. \n\n28  Resettlement Framework; Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2).  \n\n29  Of  the  86  physically  displaced  households,  37  will  be  displaced  from  the  project\u2019s  reservoir  area  and  49  will  be \n\ndisplaced from the site development area due to the building of access roads.  \n\n30  Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n\fadditional environmental surveys and research.31 The project area does not fall within a critical \nhabitat. The environmental management and monitoring plan includes a wide range of activities \nto  appropriately  mitigate  or  offset  physical  impacts,32 impacts  on  aquatic  and  terrestrial  fauna \nand flora, and hydrological impacts in upstream and downstream areas.33 Information disclosure \nand consultations have been and will continue to be a priority, and follow ADB and government \nrequirements, including the establishment of a grievance redress mechanism. 34 The execution \nof  the  safeguard  plans  represents  the  first  priority  under  the  project.  It  will  be  supported  by \nconsultants and NGOs to be recruited by ADB on behalf of the government and THL.35 These \nspecialists  will  work  closely  with  the  supervision  consultants  and  an  independent  panel  of \nexperts  focused  on  dam  safety,  and  social  and  environmental  safeguard  issues.  The \nconsultants  will  provide  the  skills  transfer  programs  and  the  TA  will  also  support  institutional \ncapacity building.    \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n25.  Major risks and mitigating measures are given in Table 4 and described in more detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.36  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nCompletion  and \ncost risks \n\nMitigating Measures \nCost  overrun  risks  are  high  but  these  will  be  contained  through  the  deployment  of \nquality  contractors  and  contracts  with  the  right  performance  incentives.  Changes  in \ngeological  conditions  can  lead  to  substantial  cost  variations  in  the  civil  works.  Proper \ncoordination  among  the  construction  contractors  is  crucial.  Experienced  consultants \nwill supervise these contracts. \n\nOperational risk  A sediment flushing system operation is new in Nepal. It can be contained by an early-\n\nSafeguard risk \n \n \nFunding risk \n \n\nFiduciary risks \n\nwarning system, the use of sound technical expertise, and quick preventive actions. \nThis is one of the most serious risks but the mitigation plan is strong, backed by clear \nactions and the use of quality expertise, extensive consultations,  and  an independent \npanel of experts on dam safety, and social and environmental safeguards.  \nThe  budget  process  in  Nepal  is  under  stress  but  the  authorities  have  assured  the \nfinanciers  that  the  government  will  make  the  appropriate  allocation  of  funding  to  the \nproject, and do so on time.  \nTransparency,  quality,  efficiency,  and  competition  will  be  reinforced  through  a  strong \nfacilitation role by ADB. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n                                                \n31  Environmental Impact Assessment; Initial Environmental Examinations; Environmental Addendum (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). These documents were disclosed on 30 July 2012. \n\n32  For example, riverbanks will be protected based on erosion hazard map.  To deal with impacts of the hydrological \n\nfluctuations, an early-warning system will be installed coupled with public education programs.  \n\n33  ADB,  cofinanciers,  and  the  government  will  support  (i)  an  aquatic  fauna  awareness  and  conservation  program, \n(ii) a wildlife awareness and conservation program, (iii) a tree planting and watershed management program, and \n(iv) a river water safety program. These plans will be implemented in consultation with international NGOs and/or \nlocal civil society organizations. Particularly, the project will ensure safeguard compliance with habitat management \nthrough fish hatchery and relevant programs.  \n\n34  THL\u2019s social and environmental mitigation activities will be managed by its social and environmental management \nunit  and  two  project  information  centers  with  support  from  expert  consultants.  NEA\u2019s  environmental  and  social \nstudy department will be in charge of transmission and rural electrification components.  \n\n35  Being a recently constituted project company, THL does not have an established operational track record. THL\u2019s \n\nsafeguard capacity will be strengthened by external experts funded under the project.  \n\n36 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n26. \nThe  government,  NEA,  and  THL  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in the project administration manual and loan documents. The government, NEA, and \nTHL have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan \nand project agreements. The effectiveness of these agreements will be subject to (i) execution \nand  delivery  of  the  financing  agreements  between  the  government  and  the  project\u2019s  other \nfinanciers  (ADFD,  EIB,  and  JICA),  (ii)  satisfactory  onlending  and  relending  arrangements  in \nrespect  of those  resources  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  own  resources for  the  project,  and (iii)  a  letter of \nintent  or  other  suitable  instrument  to  document  the  collaboration  arrangements  between  the \ncofinanciers in respect of the project. The disbursement of ADB funds for eligible expenditures \nof  hydropower\u2019s  headworks,  transmission,  and  rural  electrification  will  be  conditional  upon  (i) \nexecution  and  effectiveness  of  the  power  purchase  agreement  and  power  transmission  and \ninterconnection agreement between NEA and THL, and (ii) certification that NEA and THL have \nobtained all licenses and permits required for the project. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n27. \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR78,072,000  to  Nepal  for  the \nTanahu Hydropower Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (regular term), \nwith  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period \nof  8 years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board;  \nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR19,518,000  to  Nepal  for  the \nTanahu  Hydropower  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (hard  term)  \nwith  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period \nof  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board; and \nthe proposal in para. 14 of this report to permit procurement (i) in countries that \nare  not  (a)  developing  member  countries  of  ADB  or  (b)  developed  member \ncountries  of  ADB  that  have  contributed  to  ADB\u2019s  relevant  Special  Funds \nresources; and (ii) of goods, works, and services produced in such countries.  \n\n30 January 2013  \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nExpanded access to \nclean and \nsustainable energy \nin Nepal \n\nOutcome \nIncreased efficiency \nand supply of \nreliable hydropower \nenergy \n\nOutputs \n1.
