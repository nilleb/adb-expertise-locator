THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID), to be guaranteed by India, for the \nSolar Transmission Sector Project. The report also describes the proposed administration of a \nloan to be provided by the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) for the Solar Transmission Sector \nProject,1 and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the administration of the loan.2  \n \n2.  The  project  will  finance  high-voltage  transmission  systems  to  evacuate  electricity \ngenerated by new mega solar parks to the interstate grid, and improve the reliability of the \nnational grid system. The project will be based on the sector loan approach, and will include \nsubprojects in various locations throughout India. It will also use the country safeguard and \nprocurement systems at the agency level. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Sector background. India is experiencing both base load and peak power deficits. The \nlack of a reliable electricity supply is constraining India\u2019s economic growth and making it difficult \nfor around 311 million people to access electricity.3 Despite such constraints, the demand for \nelectricity  is  continually  increasing  in  step  with  sustained  industrialization,  an  expanded \nconsumer market, and enhanced economic development.4 Demand for power is projected to \nmore than double from about 300 gigawatts (GW) in 2016 to over 700 GW by 2030.5 It will be \nchallenging to meet such capacity addition through a conventional power supply approach. \nIndia\u2019s power system is dominated by thermal generation from coal-fired plants, and fossil fuels \nhave created several problems, including domestic production shortages, volatile prices due to \nincreased imports, and adverse climate impacts. To ensure sustainable energy security, the \ngovernment has updated its strategy to provide future additional generating capacity through an \nenergy mix, and has increased its renewable energy target for 2022.6 At the Conference of \nParties 21 in Paris in 2015, the government further committed to increase its cumulative power \ncapacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources to 40% by 2030.7 \n \n4.  National solar mission. This ambitious target is based on a greater use of solar and \nwind power. In 2015, the Jawarharlal Nehru National Solar  Mission\u2019s target for 2022 was \nrevised from 20 GW (its aim in 2010) to 100 GW, comprising an installed capacity of 40 GW \nfrom rooftop solar projects, and 60 GW from utility-scale projects. In support of rooftop solar \ndeployment,  the  government  has  been  encouraging  states  to  enact  model  net-metering \nregulations, and enabling financing through commercial banks to facilitate market growth in this \n                                                \n1  Financed by the CTF, a funding window of the Climate Investment Funds that provides middle-income and \ndeveloping countries with resources to scale up the demonstration, deployment, and transfer of low-carbon, clean \ntechnologies. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  World Bank. 2015. Power for All: Electricity Access Challenge in India. Washington, DC.  \n4  India\u2019s per capita electricity consumption is about one-third of the global average. \n5  International Energy Agency. 2015. India Energy Outlook: World Energy Outlook Special Report. Paris. \n6  As of June 2016, the country\u2019s total grid-connected renewable energy capacity accounted for around 44 GW of \nIndia\u2019s total installed power generation capacity of 305 GW. Installed renewable energy sources comprise wind \n(27.2 GW), solar (7.8 GW), biomass (4.8 GW), and small hydropower (4.3 GW). \n7  The government ratified the Paris Agreement on climate change on 2 October 2016. ", "2 \nsector.8 Utility-scale solar projects are supported through various incentives, including capital \nsubsidies, customs concessions, and accelerated depreciation. Of the targeted 100 GW, 20 GW \nof installed solar capacity will be realized through 34 solar parks known as the Ultra Mega Solar \nPower Projects.9 The policy and regulatory framework assumes that the private sector will play \na major role in solar power generation, while the public sector will be responsible for the \nassociated transmission facilities for grid integration, including offtake arrangements. \n \n5.  Solar  park  development. The solar parks scheme seeks to address the time and \nexpense  involved  in  obtaining  suitable  land  in  remote  areas,  providing  accessibility,  and \npromoting clearances for each project, all of which have been identified as key development \nbarriers to solar expansion in India. Solar parks provide solar power developers (independent \npower  producers  and/or  investors)  with  access  to  a  site  with  all  necessary  government \nclearances, basic infrastructure such as transmission systems, water access, road connectivity, \nand communication networks, for a leasing fee. As well as accelerating the development of \nsolar power, these projects are also anticipated to yield lower tariffs due to economies of scale \nresulting from the development of large plots of land that can host several solar park projects.10 \nThe  government  is  providing  capital  subsidies  through  solar  park  development  to  lower \ninvestment costs for solar power producers and, ultimately, lower solar power purchase tariffs. \nStates with sufficient institutional capacity are developing the parks through state utilities, while \nothers are forming joint ventures between the government-owned Solar Energy Corporation of \nIndia, state utilities, and/or private parties for solar park development.11 \n \n6.  Solar park transmission. The transmission line expansion associated with the solar \nparks is being carried out by either the state transmission companies or the central transmission \nutility, POWERGRID.12 The transmission infrastructure required to increase the penetration of \nsolar energy remains the responsibility of the public sector. Despite the recent decrease in \nproject  costs,  solar  power  remains  more  expensive  than  conventional  power  in  India  and \nimposes an additional cost burden to integrate the associated variable power generation into the \ngrid. The government has thus declared transmission expansions connecting solar parks to be \npart of the interstate transmission system, with costs socialized across the entire network. This \nwill ensure that connection costs do not further increase tariffs for solar power developers.13 The \nuse  of  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  resources,  including  the  CTF,  to  finance  this \ntransmission expansion will substantially reduce the cost of connecting the solar parks to the \n                                                \n8  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Multitranche Financing Facility and Administration of Loan and Technical Assistance Grant to Punjab \nNational Bank for the Solar Rooftop Investment Program (Guaranteed by India). Manila. The program includes \nCTF cofinancing. \n9  Each solar park will have a generation capacity of 500 megawatts (MW) or more. \n10 The solar power developers can be selected in the bids. The 2016 solar project auctions for the solar park in \nBhadla, Rajasthan, indicated a bid tariff of \u20b94.00 per kilowatt-hour, a decrease of one-third from the pioneering \nfeed-in-tariff of \u20b912.54 per kilowatt-hour that was set out for solar power in Gujarat in 2010. \n11 As some state distribution utilities are financially distressed, central entities such as the Solar Energy Corporation \nof India and National Thermal Power Corporation are involved in offtake arrangements between solar power \ndevelopers and selective offtake utilities. To incentivize competitive solar power tariffs in the bid selections, the \ngovernment also provides operational subsidies for developers in the solar parks that sell solar power to state \ndistribution utilities. \n12 When at least 50% of the power produced at a park will be consumed within the host state, the state transmission \ncompany may choose to build the transmission network. POWERGRID may be asked to expand the transmission \nlines for the remaining parks. \n13 In January 2016, the National Tariff Policy was amended to include (i) no interstate transmission charges on solar \npower, and (ii) a renewable power obligation to purchase 8% of the distribution utilities\u2019 electricity consumption, \nparticularly from solar energy, by March 2022. POWERGRID is allowed to charge solar power-related transmission \ncosts on other grid users in the form of cross-subsidization. ", "3 \nexisting transmission network, ultimately minimizing the transmission charges paid by grid users \nand end-customers. \n \n7.  ADB interventions. ADB was one of the first institutions to develop the solar parks\u2019 \ntransmission systems for state utilities in Gujarat and Rajasthan.14 While various donors and \nmultilateral development banks are widely involved in renewable energy development projects, \nthe CTF has been allocated to ADB and the World Bank to support solar rooftop projects, solar \nparks, and the associated transmission infrastructure.15 \n \n8.  Since 1995, ADB has provided POWERGRID with eight sovereign-guaranteed loans \nand two nonsovereign loans to strengthen its national transmission system. The projects have a \ngood implementation history and satisfactory ratings. In 2015, ADB provided loans for the Green \nEnergy Corridor and Grid Strengthening Project,16 which was based on the National Smart Grid \nMission to connect renewable resource-rich areas to the long-distance interregional grid through \nhigh-voltage, direct-current technology. This follow-on project for interstate transmission for \nsolar  parks  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  India,  2013\u20132017.17 \nPOWERGRID remains responsible for planning, developing, and operating the high-voltage \ninterstate and interregional power transmission network. It has a sound implementation record \nin upgrading and strengthening the national transmission network system, and its operational \nperformance is consistently good. \n \n9.  Project  design.  The  government  asked  ADB  to  provide  continued  support  for  the \ninterstate  transmission  system  for  solar  parks,  because  it  aims  to  scale  up  the  country\u2019s \ninstalled solar capacity drastically but in a phased manner. A series of solar parks have been \nidentified,  but  their  development  and  preparation  processes  differ.18 The  sector  lending \napproach is therefore considered suitable as it will enable POWERGRID to expand transmission \nlines to individual solar parks according to the planned commissioning of solar parks, based on \ntheir readiness. This approach is warranted based on the government\u2019s development plan, \npolicies, and strategies, as well as POWERGRID\u2019s implementation capacity. \n \n10.  Adoption  of  the  agency\u2019s  safeguard  and  procurement  systems.  As  a  special \nfeature, the project will use POWERGRID\u2019s safeguard and procurement systems, which have \nbeen assessed and deemed satisfactory to ADB, along with agreed action plans, to comply fully \nwith  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  and  procurement  requirements  (paras.  21\u201322).  The  adoption  of  the \nagency\u2019s systems is expected to improve operational flexibility and autonomy, and  reduce \ntransaction  costs  and  the  time  required  for  the  safeguard  and  procurement  processes  of \nsubsequent subprojects, in conjunction with the sector loan approach. \n \n11.  Value  added  by  ADB  assistance.  By  supporting  the  construction  of  interstate \ntransmission systems for the Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects, the project will provide a means \nof exporting excess solar energy from states with surplus power to power-deficit states and \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2011.

It will thus enable power trading across larger \ngeographical areas, which is considered a prerequisite to deploy high penetrations of variable \nrenewable energy effectively. The resultant power output profiles will differ greatly from India\u2019s \ncurrent  generation  mix,  which  is  dominated  by  thermal  plants,  and  substantiate  India\u2019s \ncontribution to climate mitigation. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact will be increased share of clean energy in the power mix; increased overall \nefficiency of the power system; and enhanced energy security in India. The outcome will be \nexpanded supply of clean power to the national transmission system. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  The project\u2019s outputs will be (i) the improved capacity of the interstate transmission \nnetwork, particularly to transmit the increased supply of electricity generated from the new solar \nparks to the national grid; and (ii) POWERGRID\u2019s improved autonomous management of its \nsafeguard and procurement systems, based on its own policies and procedures satisfactory to \nADB. \n \n14.  The sector lending approach sets out the following selection criteria for ADB-financed \nsubprojects: \n(i)  The subproject shall be technically feasible for grid improvement and expansion, \nincluding to areas where solar parks are being developed. \n(ii)  The subproject shall be financially and economically viable. \n(iii)  The  subproject  shall  not  have  environmentally  or  socially  significant  impacts \nwarranting an ADB safeguard category A. \n \n15.  Based on these criteria, ADB and POWERGRID have jointly appraised two transmission \nsystems  subprojects:  (i)  transmission  grid  systems  to  support  the  evacuation  of \n2,500 megawatts (MW) of power from solar parks in Bhadla, Rajasthan; and (ii) transmission \ngrid systems to support the evacuation of 700 MW of power from a solar park in Banaskantha, \nGujarat. 20 Subsequent subprojects must satisfy the above criteria and will be reviewed based \non their readiness. POWERGRID will include at least two more subprojects: (i) a grid system to \nsupport the evacuation of 1,000 MW of power from a solar park in Tumkur, Karnataka (phase \n2); and (ii) the upgrading of an existing high-voltage, direct-current system between Rihand and \nDadri in Uttar Pradesh to improve the stability of the transmission grid. These subprojects will \nhelp improve the grid system\u2019s efficiency and increase solar power generation by 4.2 GW, \ncontributing to saving 7,060,273 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. Each subproject will \ninclude equipment and its related work for the interstate transmission lines and grid substations. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n16.  The project is estimated to cost $450 million (Table 1). \n                                                \n19 India\u2019s tariff policy (amended in 2016) requires that utilities purchase 8% of their power from solar energy by 2022 \n(an increase from the previous target of 3%), prohibits interstate transmission charges for renewable energy, and \npromotes the development of ancillary services to facilitate the high penetration of renewable energy on the grid. \n20 At Bhadla, relevant solar park developers include the Government of Rajasthan, the Infrastructure Leasing and \nFinancial Services, Adani, and Essel.

POWERGRID has conducted \nadvance procurement action with retroactive financing requirements for advance subprojects \nbased  on  ADB\u2019s  Procurement Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended from  time to time).23 During \nproject  appraisal,  ADB  conducted  a  detailed  assessment  of  POWERGRID\u2019s  agency \nprocurement system and practices.24 The assessment found that POWERGRID\u2019s procurement \nsystem generally meets the principles of ADB\u2019s procurement policy, and the procurement risk \nrating  is  low  given  POWERGRID\u2019s  sound  track  record  over  20  years  in  ADB-financed \n                                                \n21 The principal repayment per year will be based on 2% during the first 10 years, and 4% for the remaining 20 years. \n22  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 ADB\u2019s member country procurement eligibility restrictions were applied for the advance procurement action while \nCTF cofinancing was still uncertain. Since confirming the CTF cofinancing, universal procurement has been \napplied to the remaining packages under the project, since ADB administers the cofinancing resources from the \nCTF commingled with OCR. Universal procurement is also in line with POWERGRID\u2019s member country eligibility \nrequirements. The subsequent subproject in Uttar Pradesh will include bid packages procured through direct \ncontracting. This is because the high-voltage, direct-current system will be replaced with new equipment from the \noriginal supplier to ensure technical compatibility with existing equipment. \n24 Agency Procurement Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "7 \nprocurement.  It  is  proposed  that  POWERGRID\u2019s  procurement  system  be  adopted  for  this \nproject on a pilot basis to procure any remaining packages with an estimated contract value of \n$40 million or less. ADB will not exercise oversight through the usual post or prior review of \nsuch procurement, constituting an exception to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines.25 To ensure that \nany such procurement is conducted in a manner consistent with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines\u2019 \nprinciples and procurement practices acceptable to ADB, POWERGRID will also follow the \naction plan for procurement set out in the PAM.26  \n \n22.  Safeguards.  ADB  has  approved  the  use  of  country  safeguard  systems  (CSS)  for \nPOWERGRID for any future projects,27 based on an equivalence and acceptability assessment \nof  POWERGRID's  Environment  and  Social  Policy  and  Procedures  (ESPP). 28  Since \nPOWERGRID agreed to implement an action plan to address some minor gaps that will ensure \nfull acceptability and equivalence with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), all subprojects \nwill be prepared in compliance with the ESPP and the action plan included in the PAM.29  \n \n23.  Subproject  processing.  For  each  subsequent  subproject  under  the  sector  loan, \nPOWERGRID will be asked to follow certain procedures, including (i) carrying out a technical \nfeasibility  study;  (ii)  undertaking  financial  and  economic  analyses;  (iii)  preparing  an  initial \nenvironmental assessment report (IEAR) analogous to an initial environmental examination, \nincluding an environmental management plan; (iv) preparing a compensation plan for temporary \ndamages (CPTD) analogous to a resettlement plan; and (v) preparing an indigenous peoples \nplan, if necessary. POWERGRID will submit appraisal reports for these procedures to ADB, \nwhich will consider and approve each subproject before financing it. ADB will not consider any \nsubproject that does not satisfy all of the eligibility criteria or where the above procedures have \nnot been followed. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  POWERGRID has carried out detailed technical studies by using the latest available \npower system analysis software, and has confirmed that the proposed transmission system\u2019s \ntransfer  capacity  is  adequate  to  evacuate  the  electricity  from  the  planned  solar  parks. \n                                                \n25 ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines require prior or post reviews of contract packages. Instead, ADB will spot-check bid \ndocuments, bid evaluations, and contract awards annually (at least) and as part of a midterm audit to verify that the \nprocurement was undertaken in the manner agreed with ADB. \n26 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The action plan details \nadditional requirements to satisfy minor gaps between ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and POWERGRID\u2019s Works \nand Procurement Policy and Procedures. These include the submission of a procurement plan and bid invitations \nto ADB, interest-free advance payments, dispute resolution provision, international arbitration for foreign bidders, \nanticorruption measures, and the exclusion of e-reverse auction. While the project\u2019s procurement plan has no \ncontracts valued at more than $40 million (ADB\u2019s threshold of international competitive bidding for India\u2019s works \nand plant), the procurement of any such package will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n27 ADB.  2017.  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India,  Limited.  Agency  Level  Use  of  Country  Safeguard  System.                               \nManila. The assessment concluded that POWERGRID has a good track record, and has systems in place that \neffectively manage environmental and social risks. \n28 In 1998, POWERGRID developed the ESPP as a comprehensive environmental and social management system. \nThis was revised in 2009 to integrate guidance and best practices from the World Bank. Since then, the World \nBank has used the ESPP under its use of country systems pilot program for environmental and social safeguards. \n29 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The action plan has \nbeen agreed with POWERGRID as a result of the ESPP\u2019s equivalence and acceptance assessments. The actions \nare  mainly  related  to  improved  monitoring,  disclosure,  consultation,  and  grievance  redress;  gender  focus; \nappropriate  cumulative  impact  and  strategic  environmental  assessments;  specific  costs  in  environmental \nmanagement plans; and indigenous peoples\u2019 benefits and participation. \n ", "8 \nPOWERGRID will also install a state-of-the-art substation automation system that will enable \nthe operators to take necessary actions to manage intermittent renewable energy sources. All of \nthe identified subprojects are based on well-proven technology and fall within POWERGRID's \nimplementation capability. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n25.  The subproject-level model makes detailed cost estimates for specific project-funded \nassets, and financial revenues generated from, and costs incurred related to, these assets. The \nfinancial viability of the two subprojects was examined in advance. The subprojects\u2019 financial \ninternal  rates  of  return,  which  were  calculated  in  real  terms,  compare  favorably  with  the \nestimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  value  in  real  terms.  This  substantiates  the \nsubprojects\u2019 financial viability with full cost recovery.30 \n \n26.  Electricity from the solar parks would displace coal-fired generation from existing plants \n(a resource cost saving) in states with renewable energy shortfalls. In light of these benefits, \nand  consistent  with  other  ADB  economic  analyses  of  renewable  energy  transmission,  the \nsubprojects\u2019 economic internal rates of return are expected to exceed the threshold of economic \nviability established by ADB.31 The appraised subprojects are thus assessed as financially \nviable and economically sustainable. \n \n27.  Given the cost-plus nature of the tariff-setting process, which provides an assured post-\ntax  return  on  equity,  POWERGRID\u2019s  financial  position  remains  healthy  and  robust.  Both \nStandard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch Ratings have assigned a rating of BBB\u2013 with a stable outlook \nconsistent with the government\u2019s sovereign rating. POWERGRID\u2019s revenue from operations \ndoubled in the 5 years preceding FY2016. POWERGRID achieved a 14% post-tax return on \nequity and a debt service coverage ratio of 2.0 in FY2016, and it is also projected to sustain a \nsound  financial  position.  The  company  maintains  adequate  financial  management  capacity \nbased on its navratna (jewel) status, where the government allows it a degree of managerial \nand financial autonomy, despite its majority-government ownership. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n28.  POWERGRID  is governed  by  corporate governance  principles  and  systems  as  per \nIndia\u2019s Securities and Exchange Board Regulations, 2015. It has disclosed quarterly corporate \ngovernance  reports  with  certificates  to  ensure  corporate  fairness,  transparency,  and \naccountability.  The  corporate  governance  structure  specifies  the  distribution  of  rights  and \nresponsibilities  among  different  stakeholders,  including  a  number  of  committees  and \nindependent  directors.  POWERGRID\u2019s  operations  fall  under  the  regulation  of  the  Central \nElectricity  Regulatory  Commission,  which  provides  robust,  tariff-based  remuneration  for  its \ntransmission  services.  POWERGRID  also  has  an  advanced  accounting  system  using \ncomputerization that ensures confidentiality and integrity at various levels, and its financial \nmanagement risks are low. \n \n                                                \n30 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The financial internal rate of return \nof the Bhadla subproject is 4.90% (higher than its weighted average cost of capital of 3.92%), and that of the \nBanaskantha subproject is 4.83% (higher than its weighted average cost of capital of 3.91%). \n31 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The economic internal rate of \nreturn of the Bhadla subproject is 19.22%, and that of the Banaskantha subproject is 18.50%. ", "9 \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and POWERGRID. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n30.  POWERGRID\u2019s committee for corporate social responsibility (CSR) has provided local \ncommunities with various activities relating to rural development, skills development, health, \neducation,  and  the  environment,  as  appropriate. 32  The  project  is  designed  to  include \n(i) compensation for the loss of crops and trees and land damage based on market value,  \n(ii)  additional  assistance  for  affected  vulnerable  households  under  CSR,33 and  (iii)  gender \nmainstreaming training programs for POWERGRID and its contractors.34 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n31.  The  overall  project  is  classified  category  B  for  the  environment,  category  B  for \ninvoluntary resettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples. The subprojects will have no \nsignificant safeguard impacts. Two advance subprojects have already been appraised, and \nenvironmental  and  social  assessments  have  been  completed  on  the  basis  of  CSS.  Each \nsubproject\u2019s environmental and social impacts have been adequately assessed in the IEAR and \nCPTD, and these documents meet the requirements of both the ESPP and the action plan for \nsafeguards in the PAM.35 The environmental impacts of the transmission lines were minimized \nduring the route-selection process, and the alignments do not pass through any forests. No \nacquisition of private land for the subprojects is foreseen.36 Impacts during the construction of \nthe lines will be temporary and will primarily consist of the loss of crops and trees, for which \naffected persons will be compensated.37 POWERGRID has a good track record and its staff are \nexperienced in monitoring the environmental and social risks of subprojects and conducting the \nnecessary  consultations  and  disclosure.  Any  subsequent  subprojects  will  be  assessed  in \naccordance with the requirements of the ESPP and the action plan in the PAM, which will be \ntreated  as  safeguard  frameworks  and  guidelines  to  prepare  the  IEAR  and  CPTD.  Project \nimplementation will be monitored continuously in keeping with ADB requirements.38 \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.39 The risks are manageable, and appropriate \nmitigation measures are incorporated. Integrated benefits are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n                                                \n32 POWERGRID spent more than $18 million equivalent on CSR activities in 2015\u20132016.  \n33 The ESPP\u2019s definition of vulnerable households includes scheduled tribes, scheduled castes, households headed \nby women, and people with disabilities as certified by state governments. These will be prioritized under CSR \nactivities. \n34 The programs will be implemented after training manuals are prepared for POWERGRID and the contractors \ncovering equal pay for men and women, the prevention of sexually transmitted infections, and the construction of \nsite facilities suitable for women workers. \n35 As a result, these safeguard documents also fully meet ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. \n36 The land has been acquired or is being transferred from state governments and a state utility to POWERGRID. \n37 With regard to transmission lines, a small square area (0.8\u20131.96 square meters) is requested for each tower. \n38 The use of CSS will not change ADB\u2019s monitoring disclosure requirements or the role and function of ADB\u2019s \naccountability mechanism. \n39 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nCompletion delays  Delays in the completion of transmission projects are typically due to the time required \ndue to procurement  for procurement, private land acquisition, and rights-of-way. These risk factors are \nand safeguards  mitigated for the project. Most of the bids have been advertised and some have already \nbeen  awarded  through  advance  procurement  action.  For  the  subproject  sites, \nPOWERGRID has confirmed that no private land will be acquired, and the impacts of \ntransmission towers and lines are limited to the loss of crops and trees, which will be \naddressed through compensation. Any subsequent subprojects will be implemented \nthrough POWERGRID\u2019s procurement and safeguard systems, as well as their action \nplans and loan and guarantee agreements, and will be monitored by ADB. No safeguard \ncategory A subprojects will be considered under the sector loan. \nCounterparty defaults  POWERGRID is protected against any immediate failures stemming from solar park \ndevelopment or power offtaking under commercial agreements. Specific securities are \nincluded in the form of performance bonds from solar park developers, and letters of \ncredit from offtakers. In case of any offtaker defaults beyond these securities, the \nregulations  allow  POWERGRID  to  recover  its  losses  from  other  non-defaulting \ncustomers by sharing any increased transmission charges on a pro rata basis. \nRegulatory changes  POWERGRID\u2019s regulatory risk is minimal due to the regulator\u2019s good track record and \nthe National Tariff Policy provisions, which specify a full cost pass-through to ensure \nthe  project\u2019s  full  cost  recovery.  The  sector  regulator  has  historically  supported \nPOWERGRID as the central transmission utility and national transmission licensee, \nwith the tariff structure and key tariff components remaining largely unchanged. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, POWERGRID = Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n33.  The  government  and  POWERGRID  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, except as \nADB may agree otherwise, as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n34.  The government and POWERGRID have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the draft loan and guarantee agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the loan of  $175,000,000 to Power Grid Corporation of India Limited, to be \nguaranteed  by  India, for  the  Solar Transmission  Sector  Project, from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; for a term of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft loan and guarantee agreements presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the  use  of  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India  Limited\u2019s  agency  procurement \nsystems, as described in para. 21. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n7 March 2017 ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \nShare of clean energy in the power mix increased, overall efficiency of the power system increased, and \nenergy security in India enhanced (Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Missiona and India\u2019s Intended \nNationally Determined Contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Changeb) \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By 2022:     \n \nSupply of clean power  a.
