THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  proposed \nadministration of a grant to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) to the \nRepublic of the Union of Myanmar for the Economic Empowerment of the Poor and Women in \nthe East\u2013West Economic Corridor Project.1  \n \n2.  The project will support micro and small enterprise (MSE) development, and increased \nemployment and economic opportunities for the poor and women selling crafts and local food to \ntourists and residents in the East\u2013West Economic Corridor (EWEC). The project locations are \nChaungzon  Island,  Kyaikhto,  Mawlamyine,  and  Mudon,  four  townships  in  Mon  State.  The \nproject comprises an integrated approach to enable microentrepreneurs to access technical \ntraining, skills in business management, appropriate technology, finance, and markets to build \ncompetitive and sustainable businesses and contribute to reducing household poverty. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Inclusive  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Myanmar  is  classified  as  a  low  human \ndevelopment country; the 2014 Human Development Report ranks it 150th of 187 countries.2 \nApproximately 26% of the population lives in poverty. Poverty is gendered, and concentrated in \nrural areas and among some ethnic groups.3 A key objective of the government\u2019s development \nagenda is to attain sustainable inclusive growth, job creation, and poverty reduction.4 The \ngovernment\u2019s  Framework  for  Economic  and  Social  Reforms  emphasizes  transition  from \npredominantly low-productive agriculture to higher-value products by promoting micro, small, \nand medium-sized enterprises and trade, as one channel to facilitate inclusive growth.5 In \nMyanmar, micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises account for 90% of all business and are \nthe largest source of employment, accounting for 70% of the total workforce.6 Investing in their \ndevelopment is, therefore, essential for inclusive growth and poverty reduction. \n \n4.  Selection  of  project  area.  In  Mon  State,  more  than  39%  of  the  population  is \nunderemployed and more than 16% of families are classified as poor; despite rapidly increasing \ntrade and tourism in the area. Approximately 55% of the state\u2019s population is self-employed, \noperating MSEs that sell agricultural products such as processed foods and snacks (e.g., fruit \nand vegetable juice, jams, and dried goods) and handicrafts including bamboo and woven \nproducts in nearby markets.7 However, these MSEs are constrained by low productivity and \nmake  limited  contributions  to  reducing  household  poverty,  including  (i)  insufficient  product \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  United Nations Development Programme. 2014. 2014 Human Development Report. Washington, DC. \n3  Poverty incidence is about twice as high in rural (29%) than urban (15%) areas. Rural areas account for almost \n85% of total poverty.

", "2   \n \nknowledge, poor access to appropriate processing technology, and lack of skilled employees; \n(ii)  lack  of  business  management  skills  and  access  to  business  development  services;  \n(iii) limited access to finance and markets; and (iv) insufficient infrastructure and institutional \nsupport. These constraints prevent residents of the state from developing productive enterprises \nthat could supply value-added products to expanding local and regional markets. \n \n5.  About 15% of the 2.3 million Myanmar nationals migrating to Thailand in search of \nbetter-paying jobs are from Mon State.8 Currently, migrant workers in Thailand remit an annual \ntotal of $1.7 billion nationally, of which more than $588 million is sent to Mon State.9 However, \nthese remittances are mostly used to support basic survival needs; the use of these funds for \ninvestment  and  other  productive  purposes  would  maximize  their  development  impact  and \nsupport poverty reduction for households affected by migration. \n \n6.   Tourism in Mon State has strong potential for growth. The project site near Kyaikthiyo \n(the Golden Rock Pagoda) is one of the top tourist destinations in Myanmar, with more than  \n1 million visitors in 2013.10 Mawlamyine and Mudon, with the country\u2019s largest reclining Buddha, \npagodas, old churches, caves, and huge rock formations are also increasingly popular tourist \nsites. The Mon State government plans to promote these areas for cultural and community-\nbased tourism development. It recently mobilized significant private investment for new hotels \nand tourist facilities. These opportunities, together with improved connectivity resulting from \nupgrades to the EWEC will result in a sharp increase in international tourism and trade in the \nproposed project areas.11 \n \n7.  Local resources for employment and livelihood generation. The project will support \nlocal  producers  of  agricultural  products  and  handicrafts  to  access  income-generation  and \nemployment opportunities associated with this new consumer market, as well as facilitate their \naccess to established local and tourist markets in Mon, Yangon, and at the Myawaddy\u2013Mae Sot \nborder.  The  project  interventions  are  designed  to  boost  microenterprise  development  and \nrelated  job  creation  that  is  pro-poor  and  led  by  women,  through  investments  in  technical \ntraining, capacity development for business development and management skills, and small \ninfrastructure to support access to processing technology and markets. Support to strengthen \nlocal government and key stakeholder capacity and institutional arrangements will improve the \nbusiness-enabling environment. \n \n8.  Alignment with government plans and ADB strategy. The project is aligned with the \ngovernment\u2019s priority to create jobs and generate income to reduce poverty, as highlighted in \nthe Framework for Economic and Social Reforms, 2012\u20132015 and the National Comprehensive \nDevelopment Plan, 2011\u20132031. It is consistent with the interim country partnership strategy of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  Myanmar,  2012-2014  (extended  to  2016),  which \n                                                \n8  Many of the migrants are males who leave behind females to head the households.

The road improvements will ensure a good road network stretching \nfrom Myawaddy on the Thai border and linking it to Hpa-an (in Kayin), Kyaikhto and Mawlamyine (in Mon), and \nYangon by 2018. \n ", "  3 \nfocuses on inclusive economic growth, job creation, and support for rural livelihoods.12 The \nproject is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Myanmar.13 It will complement \nother ADB assistance14 and coordinate closely with other development partner interventions.15 \n \n9.  Lessons. Lessons learnt from a similar project in Cambodia16 highlight the need to (i) \nadequately assess market demand for products and services, (ii) involve private sector partners \nearly and frontload business support services, (iii) involve both men and women in decision-\nmaking processes, and (iv) provide adequate project implementation support. Applying these \nlessons, project preparation included a rapid value chain analysis to guide the selection of \nproduct types and project locations. Comprehensive value chain analysis and market studies \nwill be completed during the initial stages of project implementation. \n \n10.  Replicable, scalable, and sustainable. The project will demonstrate how to assist local \nresidents access socioeconomic benefits resulting from the increasing number of tourists and \nroad improvements in the EWEC. This will provide a model that can be scaled up in the state \nand replicated in other parts of the country. It will promote entrepreneurship among migrant \nreturnees and \u2015left-behind\u2016 families of migrants through the effective use of remittances. The \nstrengthening of community-based enterprises and implementation of life-skill training programs \nwill provide young men and women with alternatives to unsafe migration. Training on gender \nequality and life skills is envisaged to promote gender-fair division of resources and labor, and \nwill create an enabling environment for women to better access livelihood opportunities. The \nproject supports infrastructure improvements to connect lower-income groups with markets, and \nenable lower-educated residents to access training and salaried employment. Capacity building \nof institutions responsible for MSE development with parallel support to project beneficiaries to \nengage in all stages of the value chain will enhance the sustainability of project outputs. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact is aligned with the government\u2019s priority to create jobs and generate income \nto reduce poverty. The outcome will be MSEs are enabled to increase business activities and \nemployment in project areas. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  The project will have the following outputs. \n \n13.  Output 1: Skills and management capacity of micro and small enterprises and \ntheir employees developed. This output will (i) conduct value chain and market studies to \nidentify the crafts and local foods to be supported; (ii) design and implement training programs \nto improve existing, and create new product lines based on the foundation studies; and (iii) train \nmaster  trainers  from  existing  training  bodies  (vocational  training  institutes,  government \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2012, extended in 2014.

The  project  will  support  900  households  to  access  livelihood  and  employment  in  \n12  villages  in  Chaungzon,  Kyaikhto,  Mawlamyine,  and  Mudon  townships,  in  Mon  State.17 \nCriteria used to select the project location and beneficiaries include (i) villages have poverty \nrates of at least 16%; (ii) communities have sufficient basic skills to produce crafts and food \nproducts; (iii) at least 75% of products selected will be produced mainly by women in enterprises \nled by women; (iv) market demand for the type of products that can be produced in target \nvillages has been proven; and (v) participation in the project is endorsed by community leaders, \nwomen producers, and intended project recipients. \n \n14.  Output  2:  Access  to  business  services,  credit,  and  commercial  networks \nstrengthened. This output will identify input suppliers, business development training service \nproviders, microfinance providers, and the feasibility of credit access and commercial networks \nto strengthen market linkages. It will develop training courses and deliver training to MSEs on \nbusiness  development,  management,  and  accounting  that  culminate  in  individual  business \nplans.  Activities  will  strengthen  the  access  of  MSEs  and  retailers  to  affordable  credit  by \nintroducing them to local microfinance institutions, while implementing training modules to train \nMSEs  and  retailer  groups  to  create  independent  savings  and  credit  groups.  Support  for \nparticipation  in  trade  fairs  and  business-matching  workshops  will  strengthen  commercial \nnetworks involving MSEs, suppliers, wholesalers, and retail outlets and markets in Mon and \nYangon. Support to develop a \u2015Made in Mon, Myanmar\u2016 brand, product design competitions for \ninnovative handicrafts, and related marketing and promotion programs will increase market \nawareness of products produced in the project area. \n \n15.   Output 3: Infrastructure to support access to markets and processing facilities \nimproved. This component will provide retailers and traders with a custom-built public market \nfacility18 in Mawlamyine and a multifunction processing center in Kyaikhto. Both facilities will be \noperated under public\u2013private\u2013community partnership models to promote local ownership while \nensuring effective management and long-term financial sustainability. This output will (i) develop \na local product and craft market with amenities in Mawlamyine, including directional signage \nand  vehicle  parking;  and  (ii)  establish  a  market  management  committee  comprising  local \ncommunity  members,  retailers,  small-scale  producers,  and  local  government  authorities.  A \nsocial enterprise managed by the private sector or a civil society organization with relevant \nexperience is expected to operate the market under a public\u2013private\u2013community partnership \nmanagement agreement. A vendor association will be established to enhance the bargaining \npower  of  women,  poor  producers,  and  retailers  to  leverage  collective  interests  in  market \noperations. Establishment of the multifunction-processing center will provide producers with \nsuitable space for hygienic processing, packaging, and distributing food and handicrafts to \ntraders.  A  management  committee  will  be  established  comprising  producers  and  local \ngovernment representatives who may partner with a private or social enterprise to manage the \nfacility (public\u2013private\u2013community partnership agreement). Suitable processing equipment will \nbe provided based on need.  \n \n16.  Initial operation and maintenance (O&M) plans for the market and processing facility are \nincluded in the project administration manual (PAM).19 In addition, detailed O&M plans will be \nprepared during implementation to ensure sustainability and financing of incremental recurrent \ncosts.  This  output  will  provide  direct  employment  for  vendors,  vendor  employees,  site \n                                                \n17 Training will also be provided to the unemployed, especially women and the poor. \n18 Accessibility of the market to women owned MSEs and retailers will be a key criterion.  \n19 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  5 \nmanagers,  and  maintenance  staff  in  markets.  Indirect  employment  will  be  generated  for \nsuppliers and transportation providers. \n \n17.  Output 4: Capacity of executing and implementing agencies, and key stakeholders \nenhanced. This output will strengthen the management capacity of the project management \nunit  (PMU)  and  the  project  implementation  unit  (PIU).  It  will  support  institutional  capacity \nbuilding and interagency coordination for smooth project implementation, including biannual \nproject review and planning meetings with the participation of project staff, village focal point \nrepresentatives,  and  other  project  stakeholders.  Sex-disaggregated  project  performance, \nmonitoring, and reporting systems will be established to monitor key performance indicators, \nsafeguard compliance, and the gender action plan (footnote 19). Output 4 will also support the \npreparation of baseline, midterm, and final poverty and social impact assessments to measure \nproject performance; the preparation of annual audited financial statements; and a project exit \nand sustainability strategy. \n \nD.

Civil works will follow standard design parameters. Contract packaging will \ninclude  relevant  technical  standards  and  specifications  to  attract  contractors  with  suitable \nqualifications and ensure efficient procurement. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial21 \n \n25.  The economic analysis for the project was undertaken in accordance with the principles \nand procedures set out in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.22 The \neconomic benefits quantified are (i) incremental income of existing producers, retailers, and \ntraders due to enhanced capacity; (ii) incremental income of new employment generated by the \nproject; and (iii) economic benefits from the construction of a market facility estimated by using \nwillingness-to-pay of vendors as a proxy indicator of the benefits.23 The economic costs include \n                                                \n20 Initial value chain assessment identified the following product lines: (a) Processed foods: jams, dried fruits, pickles, \nsauces and pastes; and (b) Handicrafts: (i) tobacco pipes (ii) decorative walking sticks, (iii) wooden jewelry boxes \n(iv) cane baskets, wallets, carry bags, flip flops and toys (v) bamboo baskets and furniture (vi) longyis. \n21 Cash flow analysis provided in Table 1 in Appendix 2 of PAM (footnote 19) shows that the market will generate \nsufficient revenue for the operation and maintenance costs. Detailed financial analysis will be undertaken as part of \nmarket feasibility study during implementation.  \n22  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n23  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \n \ninvestment costs for infrastructure, training and project management, and O&M. The economic \nanalysis yields an estimated net present value of $0.17 million and an economic internal rate of \nreturn of 13%, assuming a discount rate of 12%. The sensitivity analysis shows that the project \nis  most  sensitive  to  a  decrease  in  incremental  income  and  increase  in  investment  cost. \nTherefore, mitigation  actions focus  on  ensuring  all  capacity  development  activities for  the \ntargeted beneficiaries will lead to a high economic return. \n \nC.  Governance \n26.  The financial management risk without mitigation is assessed as substantial. Identified \nrisks include the country public financial management environment, lack of capacity in financial \nreporting, weaknesses in the internal audit function, and outdated accounting policies and \nprocedures. However, MOHT has previous experience in implementing ADB-financed technical \nassistance, administering other development partner assistance, and managing the regular \ngovernment budget. Furthermore, measures to support procurement oversight and strengthen \nfinancial management skills have been prepared to avoid potential problems. These include (i) \nthe  application  of  standard  ADB  bidding  procedures;  (ii)  capacity  building  and  training \nassistance for financial management and procurement under output 4; (iii) establishment of \nsuitable accounting systems; and (iv) embedding of long-term consultants in the PMU and PIU \nto provide on-the-job training for project staff and counterparts. Review missions and regular \nproject support will monitor compliance with ADB\u2019s financial management and external audit \nrequirements. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and MOHT. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). Implementation of these risk management \nmeasures will ensure that financial management arrangements are adequate. An assessment of \nthe executing and implementing agencies\u2019 capacity to undertake procurement and financial \nmanagement envisaged under the project, including the imprest fund procedure, concludes that \nthe proposed implementing arrangements are appropriate. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  The project will directly benefit 900 households in the four participating project towns. \nThe project will support local entrepreneurs, in particular women, to access livelihoods and \nemployment. The project will provide technical training together with business development and \nmanagement skills to MSEs, and facilitate their access to finance, markets, and business \nsupport services. This will support the establishment of productive businesses or expansion into \nhigher-value production in profitable and emerging sectors. Since, in Myanmar poverty has \nmuch  more  to  do  with  low  returns  from  work  rather  than  simply  access  to  work,  these \ninterventions will help increase the returns and income for many microentrepreneurs operating \nin the area and provide economic opportunities to benefit poor and low-income households. The \nproject  is  categorized  as  gender  equity.  It  will  improve  women\u2019s  access  to  economic \nopportunities and decision making. The gender action plan ensures, among others, that at least \n60% of the (i) members of producer groups are female, (ii) newly developed enterprises will be \nowned by women, (iii) women producers and retailers have access to credit, and (iv) community \nmembers employed for the project-supported infrastructure are women. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  Involuntary resettlement. The project is categorized C for involuntary resettlement. It \nwill not support any activities that require land acquisition and resettlement. The land for the \nmarket will be vacant, unused, and unoccupied land, to be identified and provided by the \n ", "  9 \ngovernment and project beneficiaries. The project will not entail any land acquisition. Where \nland is available, it will be free from encumbrances, and have no past or existing land and \nresettlement issues in regard to existing facilities. The PIU will ensure this by completing a \nsocial safeguard screening checklist for construction of each infrastructure component. The \nassigned PMU staff and consultants will confirm the checklists prior to submission for financing. \n \n29.  Indigenous peoples. The project is categorized B for indigenous peoples. It focuses \nprimarily on training and capacity building for the rural poor, who are overwhelming ethnic \nminorities. The presence of many ethnic minorities as primary beneficiaries in the project\u2019s \ntarget areas meets the criteria of integration of indigenous peoples plan elements into project \ndesign in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement (2009). No specific targets are \nset for the indigenous people group participation. Interviews and consultations with affected \nindigenous people communities\u2014producers, retailers, and owners of MSEs\u2014were conducted \nand their support for improvements in the value chain gained. Consultation and participation will \nbe continued throughout the project cycle to ensure their involvement in access to finance, \ntraining, and other project activities. The indigenous people groups are already producing the \nhandicrafts and the project will support improvements in the value chain. A consultation and \nparticipation summary is included as part of the project documentation.24 \n \n30.   Environment. The project is classified category C, at this stage, in accordance with the \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The proposed activities are likely to have minimal or no \nadverse  environmental  impacts,  however,  in  the  event  that  the  project  involves  any \nenvironmental  impacts,  mitigation  measures  for  any  identified  impacts  are  included  in  the \nenvironmental assessment and review framework.25 Initial estimated costs for developing and \nimplementing the environmental management plan (EMP) are integrated in the project costs. At \nthe detailed design stage, the EMP will be updated and finalized, and the categorization of the \nproject  confirmed.  The  final  EMP,  cleared  by  ADB,  will  form  part  of  the  contract  bidding \ndocuments. In compliance with ADB\u2019s information disclosure and consultation requirements, the \nsafeguard documents will be posted on ADB\u2019s website. Procurement of applicable government \nenvironment clearances and approvals will be obtained before award of contract. A designated \nPMU official responsible for environment issues will ensure safeguard monitoring and/or EMP \nimplementation.26 \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  The integrated benefits and impacts of the project are expected to outweigh the costs. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.27 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nFiduciary risks include contracting  Control of the procurement process and supervision of the quality \nfor national competitive bidding on  of the work or services delivered will take place through the \nequipment and civil works-related  support of consultants. \ninvestments. \nInternational accounting standards  The Office of Auditor General (OAG) is included in the approved \n                                                \n24 Value Chain Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 The roles and responsibilities are detailed in the PAM (Footnote 19) and/or in the EMP. \n27 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10  \n \nare not fully met.

ASSURANCES \n \n32.  The government, MOHT, and OCM of Mon State have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the grant agreement. The government, MOHT, \nand OCM have assured ADB that implementation of the project will conform to all applicable \nADB  policies  including  those  concerning  gender,  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \nprocurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM and grant \ndocuments. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n33.
