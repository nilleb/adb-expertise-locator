The rehabilitated roads will \nprovide poor rural provinces with a safer, cost-effective rural road network with all-year access \nto  markets  and  other  social  services.  The  project  will  also  support  a  sustainable  road \nmaintenance  regime  in  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  (MRD),  a  community-based  road \nsafety  program,  an  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  awareness  and  prevention  program \n(HHTPP),  and  climate  change  adaptation  measures.  The  feasibility  study  for  the  project  was \ncompleted  through  the  Rural  Roads  Improvement  Project2 and  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance.3  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nRoads are the principal mode of transport in Cambodia. The country\u2019s road network of \n51,764 km includes (i) about 5,623 km of national roads (primary national highways); (ii) about \n6,641 km of provincial roads (secondary national highways); and (iii) about 39,500 km of rural \nroads. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) is responsible for the national and \nprovincial roads; MRD is responsible for rural roads. \n \n4. \nBy the early 1990s, after years of civil war, the country\u2019s road network had deteriorated \nseverely.  Since  1992,  with  assistance  from  ADB  and  other  multilateral  and  bilateral \ndevelopment partners, the government has focused on rehabilitating core national infrastructure \nrequired for the economy to develop in a sustainable manner. Development efforts have brought \nthe paved national road network to about 2,700 km, slightly less than 25% of the total national \nand provincial road network. \n \nAs the rural economy is becoming increasingly dependent on the improved national road \n5. \nnetwork,  the  rural  road  network  continues  to  deteriorate.  This  is  due  to  rapidly  growing  traffic, \nlack  of  maintenance  financing,  poor  road  maintenance  standards,  inadequate  institutional \ncapacity for road maintenance and management. In addition, lack of private contractor capacity, \nand shortcomings in design and construction methods do contribute to the situation. \n \n6. \nIn  2010,  ADB  approved  the  first  Rural  Roads  Improvement  Project  (footnote  2)  to \nimprove  more  than  505  km  of  rural  roads  to  paved  condition.  This  project  aimed  to  provide \nreliable  all-year  access  from  provincial  towns  and  agricultural  rural  areas  to  markets, \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2010.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nKingdom of Cambodia for the Rural Roads Improvement Project. Manila. \n\n3  Four outputs of the proposed project were designed under Rural Roads Improvement Project (footnote 2). For the \nremaining output, ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance: ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for Preparing the Mekong River Island Connectivity Output. Manila (TA 8322-CAM). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nemployment  centers,  and  social  services  in  seven  provinces,  serving  about  0.6  million \nbeneficiaries.  The  provinces  are  Battambang,  Kampong  Cham,  Kampong  Chhnang,  Kampong \nSpeu, Kampong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap\u2014most are located around the Tonle Sap Basin, \nwhere a large proportion of Cambodia's rural poor live. These rural gravel roads are typically 5\u2013\n6  meters  wide;  some  are  vulnerable  to  flooding  in  the  rainy  season.  The  roads  had  low  to \nmoderate  traffic;  average  daily  traffic  volume  ranges  from  200  to  2,000  passenger  car  units, \ndepending  on  the  road  section.  Motorcycles  made  up  nearly  80%  of  the  traffic.  The  current \nannual  growth  rate  of  traffic  is  3.6%\u20136.0%,  based  on  vehicle  type.  These  growth  rates  were \nforecast to increase by 7.2%\u201312.0% per annum, thus a more sustainable and paved rural road \nnetwork is required to accommodate future traffic, along with properly maintained national and \nprovincial road network. \n \nThe  proposed  project  aims  to  continue  and  expand  the  initiatives  of  the  Rural  Roads \n7. \nImprovement Project by rehabilitating about 729 km of rural roads in the seven original project \nprovinces  and  two  additional  provinces  (Banteay  Meanchey  and  Takeo).  The  implementation \nsupervision consulting services of the Rural Roads Improvement Project made provisions to (i) \ndesign the project to enhance ownership and build MRD capacity,4 (ii) build upon lessons, and \n(iii)  ensure  a  seamless  continuation  of  initiatives.5 This  is  a  successful  example  of  the  use  of \nlessons from previous initiatives. \n \nAs a consequence of relatively rapid economic development and activity, overloading of \n8. \ncargo vehicles has been the major cause of road damage in Cambodia since 2007. This is also \na serious issue for rural roads due to overloaded trucks that haul agricultural products and those \nthat carry quarry materials for construction. While ADB is currently supporting axle-load control \nprograms  for  national  and  provincial  road  networks,  the  project  aims  to  extend  the  ongoing \noverloading control program to rural roads. \n \n9. \nDeteriorating  road  safety  is  also  a  major  concern,  especially  with  increasing  growth  of \ntraffic  in  rural  areas.  In  2012,  Cambodia\u2019s  road  crash  rate  was  13.4  fatalities  per  100,000 \ninhabitants,  a  threefold  increase  since  2002.  Increased  traffic  speeds  resulting  from  improved \npaved road surfaces can also impose tremendous safety risks to rural communities. In line with \nthe  national  umbrella  programs  for  road  safety  and  ADB's  ongoing  support,  the  Rural  Roads \nImprovement Project has been assisting MRD to design and manage a community-based rural \nroad safety program. These activities will continue under the project in all nine project provinces. \n \n10. \nAdditionally,  given  recent  natural  disasters  in  Cambodia,  particularly  frequent  flooding \nduring  the  wet  season,  climate  change  considerations  must  be  incorporated  in  the  project \ndesign.  The  Rural  Roads  Improvement  Project  supported  initial  climate  change  adaptation \ninterventions  in  climate-resilient  road  design;  hazard  mapping;  maintenance  planning;  green \nplanting; and planning for emergency preparedness, response, and recovery. The outcomes of \nthese initiatives are being applied in other ongoing road projects in the country, and the project \nwill  (i)  implement  green  planting  in  all  nine  project  provinces;  and  (ii)  design  and  implement  a \ncommunity-based  emergency  management  system  for  an  island  cluster  in  the  Mekong  River, \nKampong Cham province (footnote 5). \n \n11. \nThis island cluster in the Mekong River comprises five remote islands, which are highly \nvulnerable  to  flooding. The  islands  lack  organized  all-year  access  to  the  mainland  or  between \n\n                                                 \n4  Output: Rural Roads Improvements\u2014Road Selection Criteria and Climate-Resilient Road Design (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5  Lessons Learned (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fthe  islands.  Due  to  recent  climate  change  impacts,  this  lack  of  access  to  emergency  facilities \nhas  resulted  in  about  10  fatalities  of  island  residents  per  year.  Improving  access  and \nconnectivity will increase the climate resilience of the island cluster. \n \nThe  overarching  objective  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132013  for \n12. \nCambodia  is  poverty  reduction,  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s  socioeconomic  development \npriorities. 6  The  strategy  focuses  on  two  strategic  objectives:  (i)  inclusive  economic  growth \nthrough  provision  of  physical  infrastructure,  as  well  as  interventions  in  other  development \nactivities such as vocational training, agriculture, and finance sector development; and (ii) social \ndevelopment  and  equity.  Rehabilitating  and  enhancing  the  climate  resilience  of  rural  roads \nunder the project will improve the access of the rural poor to markets and social services, and is \na  core  means  of  promoting  inclusive  economic  growth  and  reducing  poverty,  as  well  as \nenhancing  social  development  and  equity.  The  strategy  includes  four  road  projects;  all  are \nconsistent with the sector assistance program evaluation recommendation to shift the focus to \nrehabilitating  provincial  and  rural  roads,  rather  than  national  roads.7 ADB  approved  the  first \nprovincial  road  project  in  20098 and  the  second  in  2011.9 In  2010,  ADB  approved  the  Rural \nRoads Improvement Project, the first rural road project to improve the access of the rural poor to \nservices. The proposed project incorporates lessons from the Rural Roads Improvement Project \n(footnote 5). No other major development partner is assisting with rural roads; they are currently \nworking on national and provincial roads.10 \n \n13. \nThe government's national strategy for growth for 2013\u20132018 (Rectangular Strategy for \nGrowth,  Employment,  Equity,  and  Efficiency,  Phase  III)  emphasizes  the  need  to  develop \nphysical  infrastructure  with  three  core  areas  (agriculture  sector  promotion,  private  sector \ndevelopment and employment, and capacity building and human resource development).11 The \nproject  supports  this  strategy,  particularly  as  it  enhances  connectivity,  balanced  economic \ndevelopment, and access to social services in the nine remote rural provinces. \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe impact of the project will be improved access to markets, jobs, and social services in \nnine  project  provinces.  This  is  consistent  with  the  sector  results  framework  of  the  Cambodia \nTransport Sector Assessment, Strategy, and Road Map.12 The outcome of the project is a safe, \nclimate-resilient,  and  cost-effective  rural  road  network  that  provides  all-year  access  in \nagricultural areas of the nine project provinces. The populations of the nine provinces comprise \na large proportion of Cambodia\u2019s rural poor. \n \nC. \n \n15. \nThe  project  has  five  key  outputs:  (i)  rural  road  improvements,  (ii)  rural  road  asset \nmanagement,  (iii)  rural  road  safety  and  community  awareness  program,  (iv)  project \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2011.

About  729  km  of  rural  roads  will  be  improved  to  climate-\nresilient paved condition. Of the 11 civil works contracts, one will be a pilot performance-based \ncontract  with  a  5.5-year  duration. 13  This  output  includes  green  planting  and  design,  and \nimplementation supervision consulting services. \n \n17. \nRural road asset management. A strong capacity-building program will be provided to \nimprove  sustainable  rural  road  asset  management  for  improving  the  overall  institutional \narrangements and practices for rural road maintenance. The program will continue interventions \ninitiated in the Rural Roads Improvement Project, including the overloading prevention program \nfor rural roads to efficiently manage road assets.14 The output continues the focus of the Rural \nRoads  Improvement  Project  on  improving  the  overall  construction  industry  for  rural  road \nmaintenance, including capacity development of Provincial Departments of Rural Development \n(PDRD),  which  implement  road  maintenance  works.  Capacity-building  approaches  will  be \nintroduced to gradually reduce the use of force account by PDRDs, using lessons from similar \nongoing interventions in MPWT.15 \n \n18. \nRural  road  safety  and  community  awareness  program.  The  awareness  and \napplication  of  road  safety  and  safeguards  will  be  increased  by  (i)  expanding  the  pilot \ncommunity-based  road  safety  awareness  program  initiated  in  the  Rural  Roads  Improvement \nProject,  including  the  education  program  for  schools,  drivers,  road  users,  and  the  community; \nand incorporating road safety provisions in road design; (ii) strengthening the capacity of MRD\u2019s \nSocial  and  Environment  Office  (SEO,  established  in  2012);  (iii)  implementing  an  HHTPP;  and \n(iv) conducting a sex-disaggregated socioeconomic baseline survey of project beneficiaries.16 \n \n19. \nProject  management  support.  The  capacity  of  MRD  will  be  strengthened  to  provide \nefficient  project  management  support  for  project  implementation.  The  project  will  promote \nsubstantial positive employment and gender impacts in rural communities under all outputs. The \ngender action plan (GAP) will incorporate all employment and gender-mainstreaming activities \nin  all  five  project  outputs  (para.  28). 17  Using  lessons  from  the  ongoing  Rural  Roads \nImprovement  Project  (footnote  5),  the  proposed  project  will  strengthen  MRD's  focus  on  all \noutputs  equally,  as  the  tendency  has  been  somewhat  inclined  toward  road  improvement \nactivities.  This  will  be  achieved  through  increased  MRD  staff  resources  in  social,  gender,  and \nsafeguard areas. \n \nConnectivity  improvements  for  Mekong  River  islands.  The  output  has  two  sub-\n20. \noutputs:  (i)  rehabilitation  of  roads  and  jetties  within  a  five-island  cluster  in  the  Mekong  River \n(Koh  Mitt,  Koh  Pir,  Koh  Samrong,  Koh  Soutin,  and  Koh  Thmei)  to  improve  climate-resilient \naccess  and  connectivity  (the  civil  works  contract  for  rehabilitating  roads  and  jetties  includes \nprovisions  for  small-scale  levees  and  water  management  interventions  to  minimize  flooding); \nand (ii) development of a climate change adaptation framework and associated investments for \nminor multisector activities (e.g., agriculture, renewable energy, tourism, water supply) that will \n\n                                                 \n13 The  project  plans  include  12  civil  works  contracts  (including  one  financed  by  the  Export-Import  Bank  of  Korea). \n\nTwo contracts are planned under the Connectivity Improvement for Mekong River Islands output. \n14 Output: Rural Road Asset Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 ADB.  2009.

The NDF will provide grant cofinancing of \n\u20ac4,000,000 to finance, based on different ratios, the civil works for green planting and climate \nchange adaptation and consulting services for climate change adaptation. ADB will administer \nthe  grant,  equivalent  to  $5.4  million  at  the  exchange  rate  prevailing  at  the  time  of  fact-finding. \nBoth grants will be denominated in dollars pursuant to ADB\u2019s standard accounting practices.21 \nADB  and  the  NDF  will  cofinance  connectivity  improvements  for  Mekong  River  islands,  with \ngreen  planting  under  rural  roads  improvements.  The  Government  of  Cambodia  will  finance \ntaxes  and  duties  (through  exemptions)  for  all  outputs  and  supplementary  allowances  (in  kind) \nunder project management support.

MRD will be the executing agency for the project. The project management unit, which is \nimplementing  the  Rural  Roads  Improvement  Project,  will  be  the  implementing  agency  of  this \nproposed  project.  The  project  will  be  implemented  from  2014  to  2020.  The  implementation \narrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3. 22  All  goods  and  civil  works  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2018s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and all \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time), subject to eligibility requirements waiver.23 \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\nArrangements \nAugust 2014\u2013June 2020 \nJune 2020 \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Project management unit (PMU) \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nMinistry of Economy and Finance \nMinistry of Rural Development (MRD) \n\nProcurement \n\nPMU under MRD, Phnom Penh; 66 staff \nICB \nNCB \n\n8 contracts \n3 contracts \n\n$53.39 million \n$1.61 million \n\n                                                 \n21 This amount may be adjusted for currency fluctuations to match the grant amount received by ADB. \n22 Details are in the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 ADB.  2013.

All 729 km will be paved \nfor all-year climate-resilient access, of which Mekong River island roads will be concrete, while \nthe  remaining  roads  will  be  paved  with  double  bituminous  surface  treatment.  The  connectivity \nimprovements  for  Mekong  River  islands  output  is  designed  to  mitigate  annual  climate  change \nrisks  for  the  island  cluster.  While  under  the  rural  road  asset  management  output,  MRD  will \nutilize mobile weigh pads that may be maintained through locally available technology, all other \noutputs will also ensure the use of similar technology for prolonged sustainability. \n \nB. \n \n26. \nThe  improvement  of  rural  roads  under  the  project  will  serve  about  620,000  project \nbeneficiaries;  the  vast  majority  are  poor  rural  residents.  The  approach  used  to  evaluate  the \nproject  follows  the  standard  practice  of  comparing  the  lifecycle  costs  of  the  road  agency  and \nroad  users,  with  and  without  the  project.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the \nproject is 32.4%; the EIRRs for individual road sections are above 12%. The sensitivity analysis \nshows  that  the  EIRR  is  most  sensitive  to  variations  in  traffic  from  the  base  year  or  the  traffic \ngrowth rate. If either of these decrease by 70%, which is unlikely, the project will not be viable. \nThe risk analysis shows that the likelihood of the project not reaching an EIRR of 12% is less \nthan  1%.  Since  the  project  is  not  revenue  generating,  the  financial  analysis  focuses  on  its \nfinancial  sustainability. The  assessment  of  MRD\u2019s  financial  capacity  finds  it    to  be sufficient  to \nmeet  the  recurrent  expenditures  of  operating  and  maintaining  the  project  in  a  sustainable \nmanner.24 \n \nC. \n \n27. \nADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  and  discussed \nwith  the  Government  of  Cambodia  and  MRD.  The  policy  will  be  applied  throughout  project \nimplementation.  In  addition,  a  governance  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                 \n24 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty and Social \n\n(GRARMP)  was  developed  in  coordination  with  the  government. 25  The  specific  policy \nrequirements  and  supplementary  measures  to  ensure  good  governance  are  described  in  the \nproject  administration  manual  (PAM).  The  GRARMP  will  be  posted  on  the  MRD  and  ADB \nwebsites. Review missions will closely monitor compliance with the GRARMP\u2019s provisions and \nrequirements.  The  financial  management  assessment  confirms  that  the  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies have,  in  general,  an  acceptable  financial  management  arrangement  to \nimplement  the  project.  Nonetheless,  financial  management  risks  are  high  in  some  areas. \nImplementation of mitigation measures described in the GRARMP will reduce the risk to low. \n \nD. \n \n28. \nPaved rural roads will significantly benefit poor and physically isolated rural residents in \nthe project provinces, including women and children. Local economic development depends on \nimproved connectivity, and paved roads reduce travel time, increase convenience, and make it \nsafer  for  women  and  girls  to  travel  farther  from  home.  Better  access  to  services  will  improve \nrural residents\u2019 health and educational attainment. Girls will have a better chance of attending \nsecondary school, markets will be easier to reach, and micro and small enterprise opportunities \nfor women will increase. From a health perspective, rural villages will benefit from a significant \nreduction  in  dust,  which  is  linked  to  respiratory  disease,  a  major  cause  of  child  mortality  in \nCambodia.  Road  construction  and  maintenance  also  generate  jobs  and  income  for  rural  men \nand  women.  The  project's  GAP  will  ensure  that  contractors  give  priority  to  local  residents  for \nconstruction and road maintenance jobs, with specific targets for women\u2019s participation. MRD\u2019s \nSEO will continue to use the Ready for Roads training materials and tools developed under the \nRural Roads Improvement Project to promote women\u2019s access to these jobs. Men and women \nwill  receive  equal  pay  for  equal  work.  Potentially  negative  social  impacts  of  increased \nconnectivity will be monitored and mitigated through the HHTPP. A rural road safety community \nawareness  program  will  promote  the  safety  of  road  users  and  local  residents.  The  project  is \ncategorized  as  having  effective  gender  mainstreaming  with  specific  targets  included  in  the \ndesign and monitoring framework and GAP in the PAM, section VIII. \n \nE. \n \nSince none of the project roads will be widened, resettlement impacts are expected to be \n29. \nminimal. Therefore, the project is classified category C for resettlement under ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (SPS,  2009).  Nevertheless,  a  resettlement  framework  was  prepared  in \ncompliance with the SPS to mitigate involuntary resettlement impacts in case they arise due to \nroad  widening  during  project  implementation.26 Similarly,  since  the  social  assessments  in  the \nproject  areas  during  project  design  did  not  indicate  the  presence  of  indigenous  peoples,  the \nproject is category C for indigenous peoples under the SPS. \n \nThe  environment  category  for  the  project  is  B  given  the  nature  of  the  project  (i.e., \n30. \nimprovement of existing roads, no widening of roads). Some project roads in Battambang and \nPursat  are  located  in  the  transition  zone  of  Tonle  Sap  Biosphere  Reserve.  In  addition,  some \nactivities  under  the  connectivity  improvements  for  Mekong  River  islands  output,  including  the \nconstruction  of  11  jetties,  will  take place  near  the  Mekong River.  Although  none  of  the  project \nactivities are expected to have serious impacts on nearby areas (Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve \nand Mekong River), MRD has obtained a no objection on project implementation from relevant \n                                                 \n25 Governance  Risk  Assessment  and  Risk  Management  Plan  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \nAppendix 2); with a specific loan covenant in the Loan Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n\nSafeguards \n\n26 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nauthorities  (Ministry  of  Environment,  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology,  and \nCambodian  Mekong  River  Commission).  The  initial  environmental  examination,  including \nMekong  River  island  connectivity  output  and  its  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework, was prepared in compliance with the SPS. \n \nF. \n \n31. \nGiven  the  procurement  management  problems  that  other  development  partners  have \nhad with MRD, risk mitigation measures need to be established. The overall risk assessment is \nmedium,  and  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  The \npreliminary  assessment  during  project  design  identified  three  major  risks  during  project \nimplementation  related  to  procurement,  corruption,  and  technical  due  diligence.  ADB  will \nconduct intensive project reviews to mitigate all the risks effectively. The GRARMP is expected \nto  reduce  procurement  and  corruption  risks;  while  close  coordination  with  the  Ministry  of \nEconomy and Finance is expected to reduce corruption and due diligence risks. Major risks and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.27 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nMisprocurement in selection \nand award of civil works \ncontracts \nCorruption that may happen \nduring financial management \nTechnical due diligence \nweaknesses in design and \nsupervision of construction \nGRARMP = governance risk assessment and risk management plan; ICB = international competitive bidding; MEF = \nMinistry of Economy and Finance; NCB = national competitive bidding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nReview eight ICB and three NCB contracts thoroughly with intensive \nproject reviews, closely coordinate with MEF and implement actions \nrequired under the GRARMP. \nImplement the GRARMP to strengthen internal controls, conduct intensive \nproject reviews, and coordinate closely with MEF. \nConduct due diligence on all technical aspects through intensive project \nreviews and closely coordinate with MEF. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n32. \nThe  government  and  MRD  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n33. \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \n34. \nbeen approved by the minister of MRD.28 \n \n\nLoan effectiveness condition.
