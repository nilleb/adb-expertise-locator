THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Rupsha 800-Megawatt Combined Cycle Power Plant \nProject. The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) for the financing of the Rupsha 800-Megawatt Combined Cycle \nPower Plant Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n2.  The project targets improving energy security in Bangladesh. It will increase availability of \nefficient and cleaner energy by developing a state-of-the-art power plant with 800-megawatt (MW) \ngeneration capacity using cleaner and highly efficient power generation technology. The project \nalso  envisages  the  construction  of  associated  natural  gas  supply  and  power  transmission \ninfrastructure facilities, as well as strengthening of the institutional capacity and overall business \nprocess  of  the  project\u2019s  executing  agency,  North-West  Power  Generation  Company  Limited \n(NWPGCL), to efficiently plan and operate power plants.1 \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Bangladesh has the eighth largest population and is the 10th most densely populated \ncountry in the world.2 The country has achieved consistent and steady economic growth, with real \ngross domestic product estimated at 6.1% in fiscal year (FY) 2014, 6.6% in FY2015, and 7.1% in \nFY2016.3 The  structure  of  the  Bangladesh  economy  is  gradually  shifting  from  agriculture  to \nmanufacturing and services. The government\u2019s strategy for development in the medium to long \nterm focuses on four priorities: (i) accelerating growth to 7.5% per year; (ii) making this growth \nmore inclusive, pro-poor, and environmentally sustainable; (iii) reducing the poverty rate from \n24.8% to 18.6% and the extreme poverty from 12.9% to about 8.9%; and (iv) providing productive \njobs for all new entrants to the labor force by 2021.4 \n4.  Despite the economic success, the country faces major challenges in its effort to maintain \nthe  growth  trend  and  move  closer  to  upper  middle-income  status  because  of  infrastructure \ndeficiencies. Bangladesh ranks low in infrastructure quality (behind India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka), \nand as such, addressing infrastructure deficiencies is a top priority for the government.5 A major \nchallenge  is  to  provide  modern  and  affordable  energy  services  to  those  who  lack  access. \nInadequate  energy  could  result  in  a  loss  of  productivity  and  competitiveness  and  become  a \nconstraint to faster growth and greater investment in the short to medium term. To mitigate this \nconstraint  and  sustain  Bangladesh\u2019s  economic  momentum,  the  government  has  prepared  an \ninvestment plan to increase power generation capacity, as well as improve and extend the power \ntransmission and distribution network, with the aim of achieving universal access to grid-connected \nelectricity by 2021. \n5.  Sector overview. The power sector in Bangladesh is characterized by recurring shortages \nof electricity generating capacity in the face of ever-rising demand in a growing economy. In \n                                                \n1  The project is included in ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Bangladesh, 2018\u20132020. Manila. \n2  World Bank. https://data.worldbank.org/country/bangladesh (accessed 1 March 2018). As of 2016, Bangladesh had an \nestimated population of 162 million people and a population density of 1,252 people per square kilometer. \n3  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. http://www.bbs.gov.bd/ (accessed 1 March 2018).  \n4  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2015. Seventh Five Year Plan FY2016\u2013FY2020: Accelerating \nGrowth and Empowering Citizens. Dhaka. \n5  World Economic Forum. 2017. The Global Competitiveness Report, 2017\u20132018. Geneva. Bangladesh was ranked \n111th of 137 countries. ", "2 \nFY2015, per capita electricity consumption was 310 kilowatt-hours (kWh); this was lower than most \nof  the  other  countries  in  South  Asia,  indicating  that  power  sector  infrastructure  facilities  in \nBangladesh require significant capacity additions.6 In FY2017, peak demand was estimated at \n10,400 MW while available generation capacity was 9,479 MW. Net peak demand is expected to \nexceed 13,300 MW by 2020 and 19,900 MW by 2025 while existing generation capacity will \ngradually retire and need replacement. Bangladesh\u2019s power generation expansion plan intends to \nprovide (i) the required generation capacity to meet this increasing demand at least cost; and               \n(ii) sufficient generation capacity to meet the government\u2019s electrification goals, including delivering \nservices to segments of the population currently not connected to grid electricity, and required \nreserve  margins.7 In  tandem  with  increased  power  generation  capacity,  investments  in  the \ntransmission network are required to address transmission bottlenecks for the evacuation of bulk \npower from power stations to major load centers. Therefore, at the government\u2019s request, the \nproposed  Southwest  Transmission  Grid  Expansion  Project  (footnote  1)  will  be  submitted  for \nconsideration by ADB in July 2018. \n6.  Energy  security.  Domestic  natural  gas  is  the  dominant  fuel  in  power  generation  in \nBangladesh. In 2016, 62% of the country\u2019s electricity was generated by gas-fired power stations \nwhile the remainder was based on furnace oil (21.3%), diesel (8.2%), power imports (4.9%), \nhydropower (1.9%), and coal (1.6%). However, domestic gas reserves are rapidly declining and \nthe growth in gas production has not kept up with increasing demand for power generation and \nother industrial, commercial, and household consumption. Current reserves are likely to be fully \ndepleted by 2030, and domestic gas exploration efforts are yet to yield any promising results. \n7.  To address the problem of declining domestic gas reserves and ensure energy security, \nimporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) will play a pivotal role. LNG is a cleaner fuel that burns at a \nhigher  efficiency  in  modern  combined  cycle  power  plants,  leading  to  lower  environmental \nemissions, including carbon dioxide. Additionally, production costs of electricity using LNG are now \nmore competitive compared with many conventional fuels. The Power System Master Plan 2016 \n(footnote 7) indicates that equal proportions of coal-fired and gas-fired generation result in least \neconomic cost on a per kWh basis in the long term. Accordingly, the project is designed to use \ndual fuel gas-fired combined cycle power plant technology.8 \n8.  The government has executed two separate terminal use and implementation agreements \nwith  Excelerate  Energy  L.P.  and  Summit  Power  International  Ltd.  for  the  construction  and \noperation of Bangladesh\u2019s first and second LNG import terminals near Maheshkhali Island in the \nBay of Bengal. These terminals will enable the government to procure LNG from international gas \nmarkets,  which  will  supplement  the  country\u2019s  declining  domestic  natural  gas  reserves.  The \ngovernment has already signed a long-term contract with RasGas Company (Qatar) to supply 2.5 \nmillion tons of LNG per annum over 15 years, commencing in 2018. The LNG terminals will be \nconstructed in time to receive the first LNG delivery within 2018. Given that the government has \nprovided written assurance to supply gas to the Rupsha power plant from the Maheshkhali LNG \nterminals, the project will significantly contribute to reducing the gap between electricity demand \nand supply in Bangladesh. \n9.  Weak institutional capacity. Technical and financial management of electricity utilities is \nlargely  based  on  traditional  practices,  with  limited  use  of  modern  management  techniques \n                                                \n6  Annual per capita consumption levels reported in 2015 by other countries in the region were as follows: Bhutan 3,039 \nkWh, India 800 kWh, Maldives 558 kWh, Sri Lanka 530 kWh, and Nepal 140 kWh. \n7  Government of Bangladesh; Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources; Power Division. 2016. Power System \nMaster Plan 2016. Dhaka. \n8  The Rupsha power plant is designed as dual fuel plant. It will operate on natural gas as the primary fuel, and high-\nspeed diesel as an emergency backup fuel. \n ", "3 \nsupported  by  information  management  systems.  This  leads  to  poor  resource  allocation  and \ninefficient  reporting.  Power  generation,  which  accounts  for  the  highest  share  of  the  cost  of \nelectricity, needs to be managed by specialists with hands-on training in controlling the process \nflow  in  each  power  plant,  including  the  use  of  modern  power  plant  operations  simulators. \nOtherwise, power plant operator training is limited to classroom sessions and to trainings provided \nby power plant contractors during commissioning of new power plants. \n10.  Asian  Development  Bank  sector  experience  and  assistance  program.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) is a key development partner in the energy sector of Bangladesh and \nhas  been  actively  supporting  investments  in  seven  broad  thematic  areas:  (i)  promoting  a \ncommercial orientation for power sector entities, (ii) promoting investments in power generation, \n(iii) removing transmission constraints, (iv) expanding access to electricity, (v) increasing gas \nproduction  capacity  and  mobilizing  investments  to  gas  production,  (vi)  improving  the  gas \ntransmission  and  distribution  network,  and  (vii)  improving  the  governance  and  regulatory \nframework.  ADB  has  strongly  contributed  to  promoting  far-reaching  energy  sector  reforms, \nespecially in the power sector and private sector participation. Through a series of reform-linked \nprojects, ADB helped the government vertically unbundle the power sector entities and set of new \ncompanies  with  firm  commercial  bases  for  power  distribution,  transmission,  and  generation. \nFinancing was also provided for the newly set up companies to increase generation capacity, \naugment transmission systems, and rehabilitate distribution networks. Also, ADB interventions \nhave resulted in issuance of gas and electricity tariff regulations. \n11.  Per covenants stipulated in the draft loan agreement for this project, ADB will continue its \npolicy dialogue with the government to pursue further reform actions to strengthen the gas pricing \npolicy and regular electricity tariff revisions with the active involvement of the Bangladesh Energy \nRegulatory  Commission.  The  project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for \nBangladesh,  2016\u20132020,9 supporting  the  government\u2019s  vision  of  higher,  more  inclusive,  and \nsustainable economic growth and investments to address infrastructure constraints. The country \npartnership strategy recognizes that achieving energy security through policy reforms is the key to \nachieving accelerated growth. The project also complements activities of other major development \npartners in Bangladesh.10 \n12.  Value added by ADB assistance. The project builds upon ADB\u2019s strong and sustained \npresence  in  the  power  sector  of  Bangladesh  and  embraces  ADB\u2019s  sector  knowledge  and \nsynergistic approach  in  developing  all  energy  subsectors.  Complementing ongoing  massive \ninvestments in transmission and distribution infrastructure, this project is an integral part of the \ngovernment\u2019s plan to ensure energy security for its population. \n13.  ADB is a pioneer in harnessing clean and efficient power generation technology; the ADB-\nfinanced  project  design  will  ensure  that  the  Rupsha  power  plant  will  use  the  latest  proven \ncombined cycle technology, which offers the highest efficiency to convert gas to electricity. Further, \nthe power plant is designed to use the latest zero liquid discharge technology making it the first of \nits  kind  in  Bangladesh. 11  ADB  will  also  add  value  through  capacity  building.  This \nproject will facilitate  operator  training  and will  finance  a  high-level  technology  power  plant \noperations  training  simulator  to  be  installed  at  NWPGCL.  The  project  will  also  finance  the \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2016. Country Partnership Strategy: Bangladesh, 2016\u20132020.

In addition, the proposed JFPR grant \nunder the project will pilot test innovative socially inclusive and gender-sensitive development \nprograms for communities in the project area (para. 18). Activities to be financed by the grant will \nfocus on vulnerable households and women, with a view to improving living standards.  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The project is aligned with the following impact: energy security improved, and electricity \nsupply increased.12 The project will have the following outcome: availability of efficient and cleaner \nenergy increased.13 \nC.  Outputs \n15.  Output 1: Efficient gas-fired power generation increased. This will be achieved through \nthe design, supply, installation, and commissioning of the new Rupsha 800 MW combined cycle \npower plant. Combined cycle technology provides the best efficiency among all power-generating \ntechnologies. It enables the power plant to be built in stages, with the ability to commission the gas \nturbines in 2 years, which is useful to meet the ongoing capacity deficit in Bangladesh\u2019s power \nsystem. Khulna city, where the Rupsha power plant will be based, is served by the national gas \ntransmission network, enabling domestic or imported gas to be readily supplied. \n16.  Output 2: Energy transfer systems upgraded. For gas supply to the Rupsha power plant, \nthe project will construct (i) a 10-kilometer (km), 24-inch gas distribution pipeline to connect the \nKhulna city gas station to the Rupsha power plant; and (ii) an additional 2 km, 20-inch gas pipeline \n(offtake) from the Rupsha power plant to NWPGCL\u2019s existing 225 MW power plant at Khulna, \nwhich is currently operating on high-speed diesel (HSD). The project will replace the HSD at the \nKhulna power plant and provide a stable gas supply for its operation, resulting in significant \nenvironmental, economic, and financial benefits. To transfer generated electricity from the Rupsha \npower plant to the existing Khulna south grid substation, the project will finance construction of a \n230-kilovolt switchyard at the Rupsha power plant site and 29 km of 230-kilovolt high-capacity \ndouble-circuit transmission lines. \n17.  Output 3: Institutional capacity of North-West Power Generation Company Limited \nstrengthened. This will be achieved through (i) implementation and operation of an ERP system; \n(ii) supply and installation of a universal power plant operations training simulator; and (iii) on-the-\njob  training  for  NWPGCL  staff  in  (a)  project  management,  implementation,  and  supervision;                \n(b)  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (c)  operation  and  maintenance;  (d)  environment  and  social \nsafeguards; (e) gender equity; and (f) effective project communications. \n18.  Output 4: Socially inclusive development of communities neighboring the project \nsite  pilot  tested.  The  project  will  provide  grant  financing  to  improve  living  standards  of \ncommunities in the project area by (i) increasing awareness on safe and efficient use of electricity; \n(ii) delivering capacity building trainings on livelihood activities and employment opportunities; and \n(iii) installing a 10-kilowatt solar system, two information technology laboratories, and two science \nlaboratories in schools near the Rupsha power plant.14 \n                                                \n12 Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Planning, Planning Commission. 2012.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n27.  The  ADB  project  team  and  project  preparatory  consultants  visited  the  project  sites, \nreviewed  all  available  reports  on  file  (including  the  project  feasibility  study),  and  undertook \ncomprehensive assessments to determine that the proposed investment is technically sound.20 The \nproject will utilize best available and proven technologies suitable to local conditions and the \ncapacity of NWPGCL staff. The Rupsha power plant will be located 271 km southwest of Dhaka in \nKhulna city. The power plant will use combined cycle gas turbine technology, comprising two \nidentical  generating  units,  each  nominally  rated  at  400 MW.  Combined  cycle  gas  turbine \ntechnology is the most efficient (the conversion efficiency of the power plant\u2019s two generating units \nis estimated to be 57% or higher) and the cleanest fossil fuel power generation option currently \navailable in the market. The power plant is designed to have two blocks of multi-shaft 1:1:1 \nconfiguration comprising one gas turbine, one heat recovery steam generator, and one steam \nturbine. \n28.  The Rupsha power plant is designed to operate on natural gas as the primary fuel and HSD \nas an emergency backup fuel. A net efficiency of 57% would require a gas flow rate of 113 million \ncubic feet per day. Allowing provision for power plant sizing above 800 MW (depending on the \nsuccessful bidder\u2019s offered configuration), a provision of 125 million cubic feet per day (0.9 million \ntons per annum) is expected to be allowed for gas supply infrastructure. The government has \nprovided written assurance to supply natural gas for Rupsha power plant operation. ADB\u2019s due \ndiligence confirmed that the government will commence LNG imports within 2018 and assessed \nthat the existing gas transmission network is adequate to deliver gas from LNG receiving facilities \nto the Rupsha power plant.21  \n                                                \n20 Consulting services to prepare a comprehensive project feasibility study were financed by ADB. 2012.

Manila (TA 9164-BAN).  \n21 Assessment of Gas Demand, Gas Supply, and Gas Transmission System Capability to Ensure Sustainable Gas \nSupply to the Proposed Rupsha 800-Megawatt Combined Power Plant (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "8 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n29.  Economic  viability. An economic analysis was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.22 Results indicate an economic internal rate of \nreturn of 17.8%, in constant 2017 prices. Given a hurdle rate of 9%, the project is deemed \neconomically viable. Without the Rupsha power plant, Bangladesh Power Development Board will \nhave  to  continue  with  ongoing  contracts  using  oil-fired  generation  to  meet  growing  demand. \nHowever, the proposed power plant running at 800 MW full capacity will generate 4,906 gigawatt-\nhours of electricity every year, and an estimated 320 MW of oil-fired generating capacity will be \ndisplaced. The non-incremental benefit of avoided fuel costs and the environmental benefit of \navoided carbon dioxide emissions were calculated based on fuel type of displaced power plants. \nThe remaining capacity (480 MW) will produce incremental outputs, valued using the willingness-\nto-pay methodology, and non-incremental outputs, valued at resource cost savings. \n30.  Financial viability. Following ADB's Guidelines on the Financial Management and Analysis \nof Projects, a financial cost\u2013benefit analysis was carried out separately for outputs 1, 2, and 3.23 \nFinancial viability was assessed by comparing the incremental costs and revenues over the life of \neach output. The electricity produced by the Rupsha power plant will be priced based on the power \npurchase agreement between NWPGCL and Bangladesh Power Development Board, which allows \nfull cost recovery through a tariff. The financial internal rate of return for the Rupsha power plant \nwas calculated in real terms on an after-tax basis using 2017 constant prices. Results (confirmed \nthrough sensitivity analysis) show a rate of return of 6.0%, which is above the weighted average \ncost of capital of 1.8%; the project is therefore deemed financially viable.24 \nC.  Governance \n31.  NWPGCL, an enterprise of Bangladesh Power Development Board, is one of five public \npower generation utilities in the country. NWPGCL was created in 2007 under the provision of the \nCompanies  Act,  1994  and  the  framework  of  the  Government  Power  Sector  Reforms  Policy \nsupported by ADB\u2019s sector development program loan.25 NWPGCL is one of the fastest-growing \npower companies in Bangladesh, with a current installed generation capacity of 722 MW and an \naim to increase generation capacity by an additional 2,590 MW by 2022. \n32.  NWPGCL has substantial capacity to undertake the project, as it has been the executing \nand implementing agency for past ADB-financed projects. NWPGCL has significant capability in \npublic  procurement,  as  well  as  extensive  knowledge  of  ADB\u2019s  procurement  processes  and \nregulations. Procurement capacity risk is rated low.26 The financial management assessment of \nNWPGCL concluded that it can fulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements, and financial management risk \nis moderate. However, the assessment noted that NWPGCL has room to strengthen its overall \nfinancial  management  capacity  considering  the  future  development  agenda  of  the  company. \nNWPGCL currently uses a manual information reporting system and accounting; financing and \nfixed  asset records  are  kept  manually  using  spreadsheets. To  upgrade  NWPGCL\u2019s  business \nprocesses,  ADB  will  support  implementation  of  the  ERP  system,  and  help  NWPGCL  build \nadditional financial management capacity. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  NWPGCL.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n                                                \n22 ADB. 2017.

Poverty, Social, and Gender \n33.  Poverty and social. The major benefit of the project is additional electricity supply to about \n300,000 consumers, which will promote business expansion and create employment opportunities \nfor local communities, including poor and socially disadvantaged people. The project will also \ncontribute to  poverty reduction  by  bringing  economic  and  livelihood  opportunities  to the  area \naround the project site, and directly provide electricity in the project area. During construction, the \nproject  is  expected  to  generate  jobs  for  skilled  and  unskilled  laborers,  including  the  poor, \nvulnerable groups, and women. \n34.  Gender. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming, and a gender action \nplan has been prepared. Key design features are (i) providing a safe and inclusive educational \nenvironment, (ii) providing training for safe and efficient use of electricity for school teachers and \nstudents,  (iii)  providing  technical  and  skills  training  to  expand  employment  and  livelihood \nopportunities, and (iv) supporting improved social and gender awareness in the energy sector. \nThese  activities,  supported  by  targets,  will  be  undertaken  with  a  focus  on  women.  ADB  will \nencourage NWPGCL to enhance women\u2019s recruitment in the energy sector. \nE.  Safeguards \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009),27 the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.28 \n36.  Environment (category A). The project is a \u201cgreenfield\u201d investment in fossil fuel-based \npower generation, and the power plant is adjacent to the Bhairab River, which supports the globally \nendangered Ganges River dolphin. The Rupsha power plant will run annually for 5,632 hours using \nnatural gas and 500 hours using HSD. Following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and national \nregulations, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) (including biodiversity assessment and \nsurveys) was undertaken and is presented in three volumes, one for each component of the \nproject.29 Mitigation measures are proposed in the EIA and the environmental management plan to \nminimize environmental, health, and safety impacts resulting from air emission, effluent, noise, and \nwaste  from the  project.  A  draft  EIA  was  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  23  February  2018. \nNWPGCL has previously implemented ADB projects and has adequate institutional capacity to \nmanage environmental risks. External monitoring will verify the information submitted to ADB by \nNWPGCL. A grievance redress mechanism has been established. The project management unit in \nNWPGCL will be responsible for environmental management plan implementation, retaining one \npermanent safeguard staff member supported by national and international experts to strengthen \nthe capacity of NWPGCL. \n37.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). Land acquisition for the project is not envisaged, \nand the impacts are therefore not considered significant. The Rupsha power plant will be located in \nthe abandoned Khulna Newsprint Mill complex, from which 20 hectares of government land will be \npurchased and transferred to NWPGCL. The construction of the 12 km gas pipeline will follow the \nexisting right-of-way of highways and roads, while the construction of the 29 km transmission line \nwill temporarily require land under right-of-way. The project is expected to affect 145 households \nwith 640 people, but the impacts are mostly temporary and not considered significant. Mitigation \nmeasures and budgetary provisions are in place to provide compensation at replacement cost and \n                                                \n27 ADB and IDB agreed to follow ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n28  ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n29 The consultant\u2019s terms of reference for the biodiversity assessment were prepared with assistance from the Wildlife \nConservation Society and  from staff and consultants of ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change \nDepartment. NWPGCL has contracted the International Union for Conservation of Nature to undertake biodiversity \nassessment in the project area. \n ", "10 \nrestore  livelihoods  commensurate  to  the  impacts.  The  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  in \ncompliance with the relevant government regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \nwas disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 5 March 2018. Given its experience, NWPGCL can properly \nimplement the resettlement plan. \n38.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Relevant due diligence confirmed that no indigenous \npeoples, as defined by ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement, are located in the project area. \nF.
