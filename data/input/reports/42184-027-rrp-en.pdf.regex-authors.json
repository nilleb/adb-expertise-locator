THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nMongolia for the additional financing of the Southeast Gobi Urban and Border Town Development \nProject. The loan will scale up and extend the socioeconomic benefits of the project by improving \nthe quality and reliability of wastewater management services in five additional aimag centers in \nother regions of the country. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  Current project. On 19 April 2010, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a grant \nof $15.0 million from its Special Funds resources for the Southeast Gobi Urban and Border Town \nDevelopment Project to support the provision of urban infrastructure and service improvements in \nthe fast-growing urban areas of the Southeast Gobi.1 The grant has been extended and its closing \ndate  is  31  May  2019.2 To  complement  the  outputs  of  the  grant,  ADB  approved  a  loan  of  \n$19.43 million on 22 April 2016 as additional financing for the construction and operation of \nwastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in four aimag centers.3 The loan was approved  with \nattached technical assistance (TA) of $1.0 million provided by the Sanitation Financing Partnership \nTrust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility.4 The TA was to support the Government \nof Mongolia in addressing sludge reuse, including implementing a pilot program in one of the four \naimag centers. The loan closing date is 30 June 2020, while the TA closing date is 31 October \n2019. Project implementation progress is satisfactory. The grant was implemented on time and \ncompleted by July 2018 with both physical progress and disbursement at 98%. The first additional \nfinancing is on track with disbursement at 19.7% and contract awards at 58.3% by July 2018.  \n \n3.  Additional financing. The Government of Mongolia prioritized the request for a second \nadditional financing loan to replicate some of the outputs of the current project5 in other aimag \ncenters  with  comparable  geographic  and  economic  characteristics  and  similar  wastewater \ntreatment needs. The proposed loan will finance the construction and operation of WWTPs in five \naimag centers: Baruun-Urt (Sukhbaatar province), Bulgan City (Bulgan province), Chinggis City \n(Khentii province), Mandalgovi (Dundgovi province), and Murun (Khuvsgul province). \n \n4.  The project aimags are examples of rapidly growing second-tier cities. With an aggregate \nurban population of about 115,000, the project aimags made up about 5.4% of Mongolia\u2019s urban \npopulation in 2017.6 Two of the project aimags centers (Chinggis City and Baruun-Urt) have shown \nabove-average  increases  in  population  and  share  of  the  gross  domestic  product,  while  the \npopulation and gross domestic product in the remaining three (Bulgan City, Mandalgovi, and Murun) \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to Mongolia for \nthe Southeast Gobi Urban and Border Town Development Project. Manila. \n2  The implementation of the grant is complete, with only a small disbursement remaining. The good performance of the \ngrant enabled its extension and the subsequent processing of the proposed additional financing. \n3  ADB 2016. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan for Additional \nFinancing and Administration of Technical Assistance Grant to Mongolia for the Southeast Gobi Urban and Border \nTown Development Project. Manila. The aimag centers are Arvaikheer (Uvurkhangai), Dalanzadgad (Umnugovi), \nSainshand (Dornogovi), and Tsetserleg (Arkhangai). \n4  Financing partner: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Administered by ADB. \n5  For clarity, the original grant and the first additional financing loan are referred to as \u201cthe current project\u201d and the \nproposed second additional financing as \u201cthe proposed project.\u201d \n6  The total number of direct beneficiaries is estimated at 30,273 households in the apartment and ger areas once plants \nare operating at full capacity and includes businesses and institutions within aimag centers. \n \n ", "2 \nhave grown at or slightly below the national average outside the capital, Ulaanbaatar.7 All project \ncities  have  a  sewerage  network  that  serves  the  core  urban  area.  The  public  utility  service \norganizations (PUSOs) have found that the relatively young sewerage systems are in generally \ngood condition and not in need of replacement or expansion.8 All project cities have WWTPs, which \nemploy waste stabilization (oxidation) ponds as the main biological treatment process. The pond \nsystems are preceded in some cases (Chinggis City and Mandalgovi) by preliminary (screening \nand grit removal) and primary (sedimentation) treatment processes. However, these preliminary \ntreatment units are no longer fully operational.9 Similarly to aimag centers under the current project, \nall the treatment systems (i) are generally in a poor state of repair, (ii) represent a technology that \nis not suitable for Mongolian climatic conditions, and (iii) are not providing a consistent level of \ntreatment that complies with Mongolian wastewater discharge standards. In addition, these aimag \ncenters are growing rapidly, driven by the government\u2019s support for a large apartment construction \nprogram.10 This will lead to significant increases in wastewater flows over the next decade as new \napartment blocks are occupied, exceeding the capacity of most of the existing WWTPs. \n \n5.  Performance of the current project. The current project has performed well11 and is rated \non track. \n(i)  Output  delivery.  The  current  project  has  made  significant  progress  toward \nachieving its outcomes. It has (a) improved access to water supply, sewerage, solid \nwaste management, and heating coverage in planned (non-ger) areas in the project \nsoums; (b) ensured that almost 95% of ger area dwellers in the project soums have \naccess to potable water within 300 meters of their dwellings; (c) reduced the time \nwomen and children take to collect water; and (d) established and made operational \nnew water supply, sewerage, and heating networks. The current project is also on \ntrack to accomplish all of its outputs. Under part A,12 standard lease agreements \nnow form the basis of the service agreements between the local governments and \nPUSOs. Urban development plans (general plans) for Khanbogd, Gurvantes, and \nTsogttsetsii soums of Umnugovi aimag and Sainshand soum of Dornogovi aimag \nwere prepared and approved by aimag khurals and the relevant state expertise \nagency.13 Capacity  building  seminars  and  training  on  institutional  and  human \nresource development, urban planning and implementation of the general plans, and \nland acquisition and resettlement were held for more than 250 aimag officials, of \nwhom 35% were women. Under part B, new water supply, wastewater collection, \nsolid waste management, and heating system improvements have been financed in \nDalanzadgad,  Gurvantes,  Khanbogd,  Sainshand,  Tsogttsetsii,  and  Zamyn-Uud. \nWhile most assets delivered under part A of the current project are completed and \n                                                \n7  Based on ADB. 2015. Mongolia National Urban Assessment. Ulaanbaatar; and aimag population records. Average \npopulation growth rates from 2008 to 2017 were as follows: national 1.4%, Bulgan City 0.7%, Baruun-Urt 3.5%, \nChinggis City 3.4%, Mandalgovi 1.2%, and Murun 1.0%. \n8  PUSOs are agencies responsible for managing and operating water and wastewater services on behalf of the aimag \ngovernments. \n9  Existing pond systems will be decommissioned, except in Bulgan City, Chinggis City, and Murun, where they will be \nreused as polishing ponds. The capacities of existing plants are as follows: Baruun-Urt 720 cubic meters per day \n(m3/day); Bulgan City 800 m3/day; Chinggis City 1,100 m3/day; Mandalgovi 1,400 m3/day; and Murun 1,000 m3/day. \n10 In 2015, the national government launched the \u201c100,000 houses\u201d program. It aims to build 25,000 homes in aimags \nand soums, and the remaining 75,000 in Ulaanbaatar. The program does not target a specific group, which means it is \nopen to all people who want to own apartments and who can meet the requirements. The program has been funded \nthrough bonds that were issued by the Development Bank of Mongolia. \n11 Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12 The current project included a total of 10 outputs presented under two parts, Part A and B.  \n13 General plans for Khanbogd, Gurvantes, and Tsogttsetsii soums of Umnugovi aimag were approved by aimag khural \non 27 March 2014 and by the State Great Khural on 6 August 2015. The general plan of Sainshand soum of Dornogovi \naimag and New Sainshand residential district partial general plan were approved by aimag khural on 4 December 2013 \nand by the State Great Khural on 24 June 2015. \n ", "3 \noperational, others are on track, according to the current implementation plan \n(footnotes 1 and 3). \n(ii)  Implementation  progress.  The  current  project\u2019s  implementation  progress  is \nsatisfactory, and both disbursement and contracts awards are on track. For the first \nadditional financing, the following contracts were awarded: (a) consulting package \nfor  project  management,  procurement,  and  supervision  support  in  June  2017;  \n(b)  capacity  support  for  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  and  PUSOs  in \nSeptember 2017; (c) Umnugovi WWTP in December 2017; and (d) Uvurkhangai \nWWTP in February 2018. The tender for the Arkhangai WWTP was issued in \nFebruary 2018. The modification of detailed designs for the Dornogovi WWTP and \nits 4.4-kilometer sewerage pipeline connection were approved in November 2017. \n(iii)  Safeguard  compliance.  Safeguard requirements  have  been  met  satisfactorily. \nEnvironmental  and  social  safeguard  screening  procedures  have  been  well \nestablished  under  the  current  project  and  applied  to  every  subproject.  The \nenvironmental management plan has been executed according to project safeguard \nrequirements. \n(iv)  Management of risk. The reports and recommendations of the President for the \ncurrent project identified the following project risks: (a) poor capital investment and \nbudget planning, (b) underdeveloped institutional frameworks and poor capacity,  \n(c) lack of monitoring and evaluation, (d) poor procurement integrity, and (e) weak \nnational contractors. The PMU provided project management and implementation \nsupport, and project implementation units successfully managed most of the risks \nby (a) building the capacity of local government service institutions in investment \nplanning and improved service delivery and operation, (b) supporting institutional \nchange on measuring and improving service delivery performance, (c) adopting a \nmodality for procurement of priority infrastructure improvements to attract better-\nqualified national contractors, and (d) combining small civil works activities into \nlarger contract packages to generate economies of scale. \n \n6.  Additional financing eligibility criteria met. ADB\u2019s due diligence confirmed that the \nproposed project meets the eligibility criteria and standards. It is in line with the government\u2019s action \nplan for 2016\u20132020, which prioritizes the development of infrastructure and services in aimag \ncenters.14 The proposed project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Mongolia, \n2019\u20132021 15  and  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Mongolia,  \n2017\u20132020.16 With its objective to contribute to inclusive economic and environmentally sustainable \ngrowth, the proposed project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and follows ADB\u2019s urban and \nwater operational plans.17 The additional financing is also consistent with the current project\u2019s \ndevelopment objective to expand access to sustainable infrastructure and services in aimag urban \ncenters.  Further,  with  the  inclusion  of  the  additional  financing,  the  current  project  remains \ntechnically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound. \n \n7.  Additional financing priority met. The proposed additional financing is for aimag centers \nsimilar to those in the current project and offers a treatment technology that is identical to the first \nadditional financing. The proposed project has a high degree of readiness: subprojects are clearly \nidentified and detailed designs have been fully prepared and are ready for approval. This has \n                                                \n14 Government of Mongolia. 2016. Government Action Plan, 2016\u20132020. Ulaanbaatar. \n15 ADB. 2018.

Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \nThe proposed project demonstrates alignment with the operational priorities of ADB Strategy 2030 particularly in terms \nof environmental sustainability and integrated solutions for livable cities. \n ", "4 \nallowed the required due diligence to be carried out promptly and efficiently, and for feasibility to be \nfirmly established. Because the proposed project will use the management arrangements of the \ncurrent project, the implementation capacity is well advanced through the PMU\u2019s experience with \nsimilar technical, economic, financial, and safeguard requirements. The existing PMU\u2019s capacity for \nproject management and implementation support to the aimag governments, built during the current \nproject, adds to the proposed project\u2019s readiness and supports the effective administration of the \nadditional financing. These features will allow the executing agency and ADB to properly and \ncomprehensively mitigate implementation-related risks. \n \n8.  Changes in project scope. In response to a request from the government, the proposed \nproject will (i) extend the geographical scope of the current project by including the construction of \nfive new WWTPs in the additional aimag centers of Baruun-Urt, Bulgan City, Chinggis City, \nMandalgovi, and Murun;18 and (ii) extend the institutional reform and capacity building being carried \nout under the current project to the five additional aimag centers. Consequently, the focus of the \nproposed project\u2019s outcome extends to achieving government standards for wastewater discharges \nand reuse of sewage effluent. The proposed project will contribute to a more balanced national \nurban system and stronger urban\u2013rural relationships by contributing to the development of second-\ntier cities in the country. It will also improve environmental conditions and reduce environmental \npollution in and around the project cities. The proposed project will support improvements to the \ncities\u2019 wastewater management by building new WWTPs, complemented by support for project \nmanagement, capacity development, and training. The new WWTPs include an energy-efficient \ntreatment process adopting integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) technology, which is \nworking well under the first additional financing.19 This system is suitable for the project aimag \ncenters\u2019 cold climate and will produce effluent that meets national and international standards. \n \n9.  Lessons from the current project on the selection of the treatment technology and the \ncapacity of the plants were incorporated in the proposed project design. Through the current project, \nuseful knowledge has ensured the quality of detailed designs which are completed, saving time on \npreconstruction activities and increasing the reliability of cost estimates. Valuable experience from \nthe current project will also allow efficient procurement packaging that secures optimal response to \ntenders and proficient evaluation of contractor capabilities. In addition, the enhanced institutional \nsupport and capacity building provided under the proposed project take into consideration similar \nactivities under the first additional financing and their degree of success. Consequently, the \nproposed use of national consultants to assist the PUSOs is focused on incorporating optimized \norganizational and management reforms set out under the current project and through previous \nurban development projects in Mongolia.20 \n \n                                                \n18 Since 2014, the Ministry of Construction and Urban Development (MCUD) has been implementing a program to \nrehabilitate WWTPs across all aimags. MCUD selected these five aimag centers according to (i) urgency in terms of \nlevels of water pollution and numbers of affected people, and (ii) suitability for replication of technology and design from \nthe current project. \n19 The IFAS system emerged as the most suitable for use in the project aimags as a result of a two-stage evaluation \nprocess, which assessed the operational efficiency, cost effectiveness, and robustness of WWTPs of this size under \nMongolian conditions. This selection was ratified by a technical committee under MCUD. The IFAS system has the \nadditional benefits of (i) being the technology used for the WWTPs included under the first additional financing project \nin Arvaikheer, Dalanzadgad, Tsetserleg, and Sainshand; (ii) being the technology used for the new ADB-supported \ntreatment plant in Darkhan; and (iii) having been successfully adopted for treatment of wastewater in two aimag centers \nof similar size to the project aimags (Sukhbaatar and Zunmod). Further details on selected technology are in para 16. \n20 These reforms aim at strengthening ownership and accountability of PUSOs during and beyond the project life cycle. \nThis refers not only to project management, procurement, and safeguards monitoring but also to sound asset \nmanagement including operation and maintenance (O&M), and more efficient debt collection systems. \n \n ", "5 \nB.  Impact and Outcomes \n \n10.  Project impact and outcomes. The proposed project\u2019s impact and outcomes are aligned \nwith those of the current project. The proposed project is aligned with the following impact: \neconomic development and livability in aimag centers (mining and border towns in Southeast Gobi) \nenhanced.21 The proposed project will have the following outcomes: urban governance improved \nand access to sustainable infrastructure and services expanded in urban places in Southeast Gobi \nand other aimags.22 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  The proposed project will have the following outputs: (i) wastewater collection and treatment \ninfrastructure  constructed  and  operationalized,  delivering  effluent  that  satisfies  Mongolian \nwastewater discharge standards; and (ii) strategic planning, management, and cost recovery for \nwastewater management strengthened. \n \n12.  Output  A:  Wastewater  collection  and  treatment  infrastructure  constructed  and \noperationalized. The proposed project will establish modern wastewater treatment facilities with \nindividual operating capacity of 3,000 m3 in the aimag centers of Baruun-Urt, Bulgan City, Chinggis \nCity, Mandalgovi, and Murun, replacing the inadequate waste stabilization pond systems.23 Based \non the findings from the pilot operation carried out under ADB\u2019s TA for Management and Reuse of \nSewage  Sludge  from  On-Site  Sanitation  Facilities  and  Decentralized  Wastewater  Treatment \nPlants,24 the project will support the provision of vacuum evacuation trucks to all aimag centers to \nimprove ger area sanitation and prevent ground and surface water pollution (footnote 4). \n \n13.  Output  B:  Strategic  planning,  management,  and  cost  recovery  for  wastewater \nmanagement strengthened. The proposed project will (i) provide expert support for project \nmanagement,  institutional  enhancement  and  capacity  development  in  utility  management, \noperation  and  service  provision,  emergency  preparedness  and  response,  and  construction \nsupervision; and (ii) strengthen PMU and PUSO capacities. Training and study tours will be \nprovided during implementation. The proposed project will include policy dialogue with the PUSOs \non water and wastewater tariff reform and sanitation improvements. It will support public awareness \ncampaigns on environmental management and sanitation, as well as improve institutional capacity \nin utility service provision, strategic planning, and operations. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n14.  The proposed project is estimated to cost $21.75 million. For the current project, the grant \nfinancing ($21.87 million) and the first additional financing ($21.17 million) total $43.04 million. The \ninvestment for the proposed project includes physical and price contingencies, financing charges \nduring implementation.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The Ministry of Construction and Urban Development (MCUD) will be the executing agency \nfor the proposed project; the aimag governments will be the implementing agencies, supported by \nthe existing PMU, which will extend its responsibilities for the current project to include the proposed \nadditional financing. The PMU\u2019s professional capacity will be strengthened by the addition of six \ntechnical positions in the fields of construction management and supervision. MCUD will nominate \n ", "7 \na project director, and the PMU will continue to be headed by a project coordinator. MCUD will be \nresponsible for overall strategic guidance, technical supervision, and execution of the proposed \nproject and ensuring compliance with loan covenants through the existing state-level steering \ncommittee for externally financed urban projects. The project steering committee will provide overall \npolicy guidance on the project and will have the authority to make decisions on matters relating to \nproject execution. At the aimag level, project supervision will be assisted through PUSO support \nunits comprising staff assigned part-time to the project. Project management and implementation \nsupport will be provided to the PMU through consultants hired under the proposed project. The \nconsultants will assist the PMU and PUSO support units in project management, procurement, and \nsafeguards  monitoring.  The  implementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual (PAM).25 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  September 2018\u2013December 2021 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2021 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2022 \nManagement   \n   (i) Oversight body  Project steering committee \n   (ii) Executing agency  Ministry of Construction and Urban Development \n   (iii) Key implementing agencies  Aimag governments \nProcurementa  National competitive bidding  6 contracts  $19,530,000 \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  52 person-months  $218,000 \nIndividual consultants selection  119 person-months  $252,000 \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time), and the \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \na  Procurement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n17.  The project is assessed as technically feasible based on detailed technical assessment and \nevaluation of wastewater management systems in extremely cold climate conditions around the \nworld and in Mongolia, under operating conditions where temperatures can reach \u201340oC. The \nwastewater treatment  technology  proposed for  adoption  in  all  five  aimags  was  subjected to \nintensive scrutiny and analysis, resulting in a short list of technology choices most appropriate for \noperation  under  local  conditions.  A  two-stage  process  was  adopted  to  evaluate  alternative \nwastewater treatment solutions and select the best and lowest-cost solution. In carrying out this \nanalysis, ADB made maximum use of current operating experience in Mongolia, as well as the \nanalysis and discussions carried out during preparation of the Darkhan Wastewater Management \nProject and the first additional financing to the current project (footnote 3) which adopted the same \ntechnology.26 The evaluation concluded that the IFAS process provides the most appropriate and \noperationally  sustainable  technical  solution  for  wastewater  treatment.  Measures  to  mitigate \npossible operational and lifetime risks will be implemented, including (i) ensuring that the existing \nWWTPs can be operated throughout the entire reconstruction process while meeting treatment \nstandards; (ii) using the polishing ponds as emergency storage if a WWTP fails; and (iii) committing \n                                                \n25 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 ADB. 2014.

Manila. \n \n ", "8 \nthe contractor to continue to support plant operation for 3 years after commissioning, and take \nresponsibility for the continuity of the performance during this period. While a few of the still-\nfunctioning waste stabilization ponds will be reused along with the new WWTPs, most of the existing \nfacilities will be decommissioned by the PUSOs with support from MCUD.27 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n18.  Economic and financial analyses were conducted for the overall project and for individual \nsubproject aimag centers and PUSOs following ADB guidelines.28 Available information from \nsubprojects was verified to support new additional financing subproject sites. The economic \nanalysis included a least-cost analysis of alternative options to ensure that optimum benefits accrue \nto service the populations in the aimag centers. The least-cost analysis resulted in the choice of \nIFAS technology rather than bioreactor. The proposed project will generate health benefits such as \navoided medical costs; resource cost savings, including domestic wastewater disposal time and \ntreatment; and an improved and safer environment. The economic benefits were estimated from \nthe results of willingness-to-pay surveys conducted in the appointed service areas. The economic \nanalysis indicated that the individual subprojects are economically viable with economic internal \nrates of return of 10.6% for Bulgan City, 13.2% for Chinggis City, 12.6% for Mandalgovi, 10.7% for \nBaruun-Urt and 11.3% for Murun\u2014all exceeding the economic opportunity cost of capital of 9%. \nThe economic internal rate of return for the overall project is estimated at 11.5% with an economic \nnet present value at MNT10,785 million. \n \n19.  The financial analysis for the project was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of \nADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects (footnote 28). A stand-alone assessment of \nproject viability cannot be conducted at the PUSO level because they do not have a full cost-\nrecovery  tariff.  Financial  sustainability  was  assessed  based  on  (i)  subsidies  from  aimag \ngovernments, tariff increases, and efficiency improvements for the PUSOs; and (ii) recurrent costs \nfor operation and maintenance and debt service obligations. While the PUSOs incur net losses \nnearly annually, aimags partly subsidize operations to avoid a degradation of services. Thus, project \nsustainability is at risk as it depends on these budget allocations. Since 2015 to 2016, the PUSOs \nimplemented  tariff  increases  based  on  rates  approved  by  the  National  Water  Regulatory \nCommission. Tariffs are proposed to be adjusted at least every 3 years, starting in 2019 when \nconstruction is underway. To maintain project sustainability, a combination of improved efficiency \nmeasures for the PUSOs, tariff increases, and assurances of subsidies have been covenanted. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n20.  Financial management assessments of the aimag governments and the PUSOs, coupled \nwith a procurement capacity assessment of MCUD, rated the risks moderate. They concluded that \nMCUD and the aimag governments, with the support of the PMU, have adequate capacity for \nfinancial management and procurement under the project. PMU staff for the current project is \n                                                \n27 In the case of Bulgan City, Chinggis City, and Murun, some of the existing ponds will be reused as maturation (polishing) \nponds for treated effluent and sludge drying beds. These will remain within the security fencing of the new WWTPs. \nThose ponds at these three locations, which will not be reused, and the existing ones at Baruun Urt and Mandalgovi \nwill be decommissioned. This will involve (i) draining or pumping wastewater for treatment; (ii) allowing remaining \nwastewater to evaporate and sludge to dry out; (iii) removing the dried sludge for retention on site to support vegetation \ngrowth, reuse in nurseries, or disposal in landfill sites; and (iv) reforming the land for reuse as grazing or for other \npurposes. These activities will be supervised by the PUSOs with support from MCUD through the PMU and its \nconsultants. \n28 ADB. 1999. Handbook for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects.

Poverty and Social \n   \n21.  Poverty incidence for the project aimag centers was estimated at 31.8%, which is higher \nthan the national average. In 2016, among the five project aimag centers, Baruun-Urt (47.0%), \nChinggis City (43.8%), Bulgan City (31.4%), Murun (29.1%) and Mandalgovi (22.8%), the first three \nexperienced poverty rates higher the national average. The proposed project will benefit the poor \nand vulnerable households in the apartment and ger areas by improving their health conditions and \nreducing health care expenditure related to poor water quality and unsanitary environmental \nconditions. It will increase participation, especially of the poor and women, in improving public \nservices. The proposed project will create about 256 jobs; most of the unskilled jobs will go to local \npeople, including the poor, and at least 30% will be for women. Details on the specific measures to \nachieve the poverty and social benefits are in the social and gender action plan (SGAP) included \nin  the  PAM  (footnote  25).  The  SGAP  was  prepared  to  ensure  continued  consultation  and \nparticipation of the local communities during project implementation. Actions include (i) a public \nawareness program on improved wastewater public services; (ii) consultations and public hearings \non a wastewater tariff increase; and (iii) targets for employment of local labor, women, and the poor \nduring  construction  and  operation.  Implementation  will  be  monitored  through  the  project \nperformance management system, project progress reports, and ADB missions. \n \n22.  Gender. The current project was classified effective gender mainstreaming. The current \nproject gender action plan is ongoing with about 50% of the activities completed and 67% of targets \nachieved. The proposed project will focus only on improving the quality and reliability of wastewater \nmanagement services in five additional aimag centers in other regions of the country. As the \nproposed project satisfies the threshold for effective gender mainstreaming, a combined SGAP was \ndeveloped. The SGAP includes activities targeted at both males and females. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n23.  Environment (category B). The environment categorization of the current project is B since \nno unprecedented or irreversible impact on the environment is anticipated. In compliance with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  an  initial  environmental  examination  and  an \nenvironmental management plan were prepared for the components to be supported through the \nproposed project.29 Short-term impacts are anticipated during construction, including dust, noise, \nand waste generated during earthwork and civil works activities, as well as minor community and \noccupational health and safety risks. Operation and maintenance training, as well as performance \nmonitoring, will minimize operational impacts and risks and optimize environmental benefits. The \nproposed project\u2019s climate risk is low. \n \n24.  Involuntary resettlement (category B) and indigenous peoples (category C). The \nproposed project is categorized B for involuntary resettlement as it will affect the leased land and a \nfixed asset (40-meter deep well) of two private companies within the WWTP buffer zone in Chinggis \nCity. The affected entities were consulted during resettlement planning. Replacement land will be \nallocated, while the affected asset will be compensated at replacement cost. A resettlement plan \nwas prepared. The proposed project will be implemented in peri-urban areas where no specific \ncommunities of ethnic minorities or groups are living. No adverse impacts are expected, and all \n                                                \n29 ADB. 2010. Safeguard Policy Statement. Operations Manual. OM F1.
