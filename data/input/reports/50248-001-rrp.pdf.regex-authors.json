THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed A \nloan of up to $3,600,000 from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) ordinary capital resources; \nand (ii) a proposed B loan of up to $3,000,000, to Sunseap Asset (Cambodia) Co. Ltd. for the \nCambodia Solar Power Project. The report also describes the proposed administration of a loan \nof up to $3,250,000 to be provided by the Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in Asia \n(CFPS) under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility (CEFPF). If the Board approves \nthe proposed A loan and B loan described above, I, acting under the authority delegated to me \nby the Board, approve the administration of the CFPS loan. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Cambodia has transformed from a post-conflict to a market-oriented economy through \nsteady and wide-ranging reforms. The country\u2019s economic growth reached 7% or more each \nyear from 2011 to 2015.1 Official figures show that poverty in Cambodia has fallen dramatically, \nfrom 47.8% in 2007 to 13.5% in 2014.2 However, the legacy of the civil conflict that devastated \nthe national infrastructure remains. For instance, access to electricity in Cambodia is among the \nlowest in Southeast Asia, despite the rapid economic development. The electrification rate has \nrisen from 20.3% in 2007 to 55.0% in 2015, but is still not comparable with regional peers.3 \nConsumers suffer from insufficient, unreliable, and expensive power because of the country\u2019s \nreliance  on  diesel  and  energy  imports  as  well  as  fragmented  grids.  On  the  other  hand, \nCambodia\u2019s energy demand is growing faster than economic growth as a result of increasing \nforeign investment, a shift from agriculture to manufacturing and service industries, and an \nincrease in connected households. Power consumption is forecast to grow at 9.4% per year \nuntil 2020, which will require more than a 50% increase in energy output to keep pace with the \ndemand in growth. Without adequate and reliable supply of electricity at a competitive cost, the \nenergy deficit will be a major obstacle for industries and a key hindrance to sustainable and \ninclusive economic growth. \n \n3.  Solar is a promising renewable energy resource in Cambodia. The country has abundant \nsupply, with average solar irradiation of 5 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per square meter (m2) per day. \nThe  technical  potential  for  solar  power  is  8,100  megawatts  (MW)  and  energy  output  of \n14,781 gigawatt-hours  per  year.4 However,  solar  energy  is  yet  to  be  utilized  at  scale  in \nCambodia. There are no utility-scale solar power plants, and solar accounts for less than 0.1% \nof the energy mix. This is primarily because solar was previously prohibitively expensive, and \nCambodia could not afford subsidized feed-in tariffs or other forms of subsidy present in higher-\nincome  countries.  The  high  financing  cost  and  scarcity  of  long-term  commercial  financing \nexacerbated the issue. Secondly, solar and renewable energy were not part of the government\u2019s \nprimary agenda for energy sector planning. The main priority has been to develop baseload \nplants such as large hydropower and coal projects, and to extend and connect the fragmented \ngrids to establish a national network. \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: Cambodia, 2017\u20132019. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2016. Basic Statistics 2016. Manila. \n3  Electricity Authority of Cambodia estimates. \n4  Government of Cambodia, Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy. 2010. The Current Status of Renewable Energy, \nEnergy Efficiency Development in Cambodia. Phnom Penh. ", "2 \n4.  However, the landscape is changing, and Cambodia is entering a new era of unlocking \nits solar potential. With the rapid cost reduction in solar panels, and the high cost of existing \nenergy sources such as diesel and energy imports, solar power in Cambodia is reaching grid \nparity where solar power can be generated at a cost lower than the country\u2019s average cost of \nproduction and retail tariffs. Once projects achieve grid parity, solar can be sustainable without \nsubsidies, thereby satisfying the government\u2019s principle of no subsidy. The government also \nrecognizes the importance of  solar energy development from energy shortages during the \ncountry\u2019s dry season. An increasing number of hydropower plants accounts for 45% of total \ndomestic energy generation, and these are increasingly vulnerable during times of low rainfall. \nSolar energy is predictable in the dry season when generation from hydropower is constrained, \nand  therefore  complementary  to  hydropower  facilities.  In  June  2016,  the  Government  of \nCambodia received approval from the multi-donor Climate Investment Funds for an investment \nplan under the Scaling-Up Renewable Energy for Low-Income Countries Program. The program \ninvestment plan in Cambodia includes $21.3 million for solar energy development to accelerate \nsolar power through both the public and private sectors.5 \n \n5.  Svay Rieng Province is located in the southeast of Cambodia, bordering Viet Nam. The \nprovince has special economic zones, with growing economic activities from industries, which \ncreate over 25,000 jobs. The peak load in the province has been rapidly increasing from only \n8.6 MW in 2010 to 14.4 MW in 2015, and is estimated to grow to 23.7 MW by 2020 and 37.1 \nMW by 2024.6 However, the region has not been connected to the national grid to date, and its \nenergy solely depends on import from Viet Nam. The capacity of the substation in Viet Nam is \nonly  40  MW,  which  also  serves  domestic  supply,  so  the  energy  supply  to  Cambodia  is \ninsufficient and unstable. The province faces acute shortage of energy, especially during the dry \nseason. Unless generation capacity is added with stable energy supply, industrial activities in \nthe special economic zones will be hampered and residents in the area will suffer from load \nshedding.  \n \n6.  In response to the energy shortage, the government decided to build a 10 MW solar \nplant, the first utility-scale solar plant in the country, by leveraging the abundant solar resource \nin the area. The Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) tendered out the plant as a private sector \nindependent power producer (IPP) project in February 2016. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations \nDepartment  was  engaged  early  in  the  bidding  process  to  ensure  that  bidders  had  the \nopportunity to optimize their proposals by leveraging the involvement of international financial \ninstitutions, like ADB, in the nascent financial environment of Cambodia, where commercial \nlong-term funding is still extremely scarce and perceived political risk is high. The transparent \nbidding  process  resulted  in  a  competitive  and  sustainable  tariff,  and  Sunseap  Group,  the \nwinning bidder, expressed a strong interest in ADB financial assistance. \n \n2.  Project Design \n7.  The  project  is  the  first  utility-scale  solar  power  plant  in  Cambodia,  and  the  first \ncompetitively tendered renewable energy IPP project in the country. It is a build\u2013own\u2013operate, \npublic\u2013private partnership (PPP) transaction for a 10 MW solar power plant to be located in \nBavet city in Svay Rieng Province, about 150 kilometers (km) from the capital Phnom Penh. The \nproject  company  has  entered  into  a  power  purchase  agreement  (PPA)  with  Electricit\u00e9  du \nCambodge (EDC), a state-owned utility. The project will construct a 5.5 km transmission line to \n                                                \n5  Government of Cambodia. 2016.

The borrower of the project is Sunseap Asset (Cambodia) Co. Ltd. (Sunseap Asset), a \nspecial-purpose project company incorporated in Cambodia. It will be 51% owned by Sunseap \nInternational Pte. Ltd. (Sunseap International), a wholly owned subsidiary of Sunseap Group \nPte.  Ltd.  (Sunseap  Group),  a  pioneering  and  leading  solar  energy  system  developer  in \nSingapore; and 49% by SchneiTec Co. Ltd. (SchneiTec), a Cambodian solar developer and \nmajor distributor of Schneider solar products in Cambodia. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n9.  Impacts. The project will increase the electricity supply to meet the demand, address \nthe problem of imbalance of electricity supply between the dry and wet seasons, and improve \nthe  reliability  and  stability  of  Cambodia\u2019s  power  supply.  It  will  also  contribute  to  more \nelectrification of villages and households. As the first competitive tender for a renewable energy \nIPP and as the first utility-scale solar project in Cambodia, the project will mark a milestone in \nterms of transparent and competitive bidding, long-term financing, and clean energy. \n \n10.  Outcome. The outcome will be increased renewable energy capacity and sustainable \nprovision of competitively priced, reliable electricity by the private sector. The much-needed \nadditional capacity will come from solar energy, which contributes to a reduction in carbon \ndioxide emissions. \n \n11.  Outputs. The output will be the successful installation of a 10 MW solar power plant and \ngeneration of local employment. The project will be ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign power generation \nproject in Cambodia. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n12.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which identifies inclusive growth and infrastructure \ndevelopment as two of the four strategic priorities to sharpen the focus of ADB operations.7 \nCapitalizing on ADB\u2019s core strength of financing infrastructure development, the review sets \nforth that ADB will continue to help expand the supply of energy, promote energy efficiency, and \nsupport  clean  energy.  It  aims  to  promote  a  larger  role  for  the  private  sector  in  financing \ninfrastructure development by supporting PPPs. The project is also fully in line with the review\u2019s \nemphasis  on strengthening  private  sector  operations  in  Asian  Development  Fund  recipient \ncountries, and expanding connectivity. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy, 2014\u20132018 for Cambodia, which calls for environmentally sustainable growth, through \nthe use of environment and climate-friendly technologies.8 \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014.

Consistency with the sector strategy. ADB\u2019s Energy Policy emphasizes investments \nin energy efficiency, renewable energy projects, private sector participation, and wider access to \nenergy.9 It will move ADB toward its target of investing $3 billion a year in clean energy to \naccelerate low-carbon growth and reduce regional greenhouse gas emissions. The energy \npolicy also supports PPP models that enable the participation of the private sector to help \nachieve efficiencies and reduce reliance on public sector funds. \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  Table 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements.10 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  The project was developed as a private sector independent power producer project, \nand awarded a PPA through an international, least-cost, competitive bidding process \nled by the Ministry of Mines and Energy. \nManagement  Project development, construction, and operation will be managed by the borrower, a \nspecial-purpose company incorporated in Cambodia. The borrower is owned by \nSunseap Group (51%) and SchneiTec Co., Ltd. (49%). \nImplementation period  August 2016\u2013July 2017  \nConstruction arrangements  The project will be constructed under a fixed-price, date-certain, and turnkey EPC \narrangement covering all design, engineering, supply, construction, testing, and \ncommissioning. There will be subcomponents, including solar panel supply, inverter \nsupply, and civil works subcontracts. \nSupplier and/or contractor  SchneiTec will be the EPC contractor to wrap the subcomponents. The supplier of the \nphotovoltaic panels will be Canadian Solar, and the inverters will be Schneider. The \ncivil works will be minor and undertaken by local subcontractors. The sponsors will \nextend the completion guarantee in the case of cost overrun or nonperformance by \nthe EPC contractor. \nOperations arrangements   \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nOperation and  O&M requirements for solar farms are straightforward, comprising electrical works, \nmaintenance  cleaning of solar modules, regular inspections, minor repairs, measurements, data \nverification, reporting, and site security. Either SchneiTec or the O&M entity to be \nestablished by the sponsors will undertake the O&M services, and Sunseap has O&M \nexperience as the operator of various solar projects in Singapore. \nRelevant parties  EDC is supporting revenue offtake. EDC is a fully state-owned enterprise that has \ngenerated EBITDA of over $100 million since 2013. It has a no-subsidy principle to \nensure its supply cost is lower than the retail tariffs it charges end users, and it has a \nreliable record as an offtaker.  \nPerformance monitoring  The borrower will report on key performance indicators, including the outcome and \noutputs indicators identified in the design and monitoring framework. \nEBITDA =  earnings  before  interest,  taxes,  depreciation, and  amortization;  EDC  =  Electricit\u00e9  du  Cambodge; \nEPC = engineering, procurement, and construction; kWh = kilowatt-hour; O&M = operation and maintenance; \nPPA = power purchase agreement. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Sunseap Group Pte.

ADB\u2019s proposed assistance comprises (i) an A loan of up to $3.60 million, (ii) a B loan of \nup to $3.00 million, and (iii) a loan of up to $3.25 million to be provided by CFPS under the \nCEFPF to be administered by ADB.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n16.  ADB\u2019s participation in the project will add substantial value in the following ways: \n(i)  ADB\u2019s leading role in the financing package of the project will help demonstrate \nthe  benefits  of  increasing  Cambodia\u2019s  power  supply  through  low-cost  PPP \narrangements from indigenous, renewable energy sources; and signal to the \ngovernment,  investors,  and  international  financiers  that  private  sector-led \ninfrastructure  investments  can  be  undertaken  successfully  in  a  transparent \nmanner, at a competitive price, and with a sound financing package. \n(ii)  Securing the long-term commercial bank financing necessary for infrastructure \ninvestments remains a challenge because of the political risk associated with \ninvesting in Cambodia, and the nascent state of the local banking sector. ADB\u2019s \nearly engagement in the project and ability to catalyze long-term loans from an \ninternational commercial bank are important factors in encouraging much-needed \ninvestment and replicating the successful experience. \n(iii)  ADB\u2019s assistance will help support generating indigenous power at a competitive \ncost,  which  offers  an  alternative  to  coal-fired  generation.  Cofinancing  of  the \nconcessional loan from the CFPS will add financial viability and demonstrative \ncapacity to the landmark solar project and contribute to the objective of the fund \nto  showcase  private  sector-led  clean  energy  development  in  less-developed \ncountries. \n \nC.  Risks \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n17.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been \nidentified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. An initial environmental and social \nexamination (IESE) has been prepared for the project. The IESE includes an environmental and \nsocial management plan, which the borrower will implement to address the impacts and risks \nassociated with the project. The project site is far from environment-sensitive areas and is \nlargely surrounded by rice fields. Construction-related impacts such as an increase in dust and \nnoise levels, and occupational and community health and safety risks, are expected. These \nimpacts are not expected to be significant, given the short duration of the construction phase \nand the availability of readily implementable mitigation measures. A construction health and \n ", "6 \nsafety  plan  will  also  be  prepared  and  implemented.  During  operation,  minimal  volume  of \nunderground water will be used to clean the panels. Damaged panels will be properly stored \nand packaged for disposal.  \n \n18.  The project has not required involuntary resettlement; and no distinct and vulnerable \nindigenous peoples groups in the area have the potential to be directly or indirectly affected by \nthe project. All land required for the project site has been purchased from 27 sellers through \nnegotiated settlement on a willing-buyer willing-seller basis. An overhead transmission line for \nelectricity evacuation will use an existing canal and roadside right-of-way, which has been \nplanned to avoid involuntary displacement impacts. In case of potential temporary impacts, a \nframework  for  temporary  occupation  and  compensation  along  the  right-of-way  has  been \nrecommended as part of the project\u2019s IESE. The institutional capacity and commitment of the \nborrower to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n19.  The  borrower  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social \nProtection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized \ncore labor standards.11 The borrower will report regularly to ADB on (i) its (and its contractors\u2019) \ncompliance with such laws, and (ii) the measures taken. A grievance redress mechanism to \naddress  project-related  concerns  will  also  be  established.  Information  disclosure  and \nconsultation with affected people were conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.12 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n20.  Sunseap  Asset,  Sunseap  Group,  and  SchneiTec  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of \nimplementing best international practice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the \nfinancing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate \nprovisions prohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for \nADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n21.  The proposed loans are within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n22.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter), 13  ADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the \nGovernment of Cambodia has no objection to the proposed assistance to  Sunseap Asset \n(Cambodia) Co.
