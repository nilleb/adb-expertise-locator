THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to India for the Railway Sector Investment Program.1 \n \n2.  The proposed investment program will increase the capacity of the existing rail network \nto  handle  the  traffic  demand  necessary  to  sustain  the  country's  economic  growth  by  (i) \nincreasing the capacity of the physical rail infrastructure through electrification and doubling of \nrail tracks on critical routes; (ii) increasing the efficiency of existing infrastructure usage through \nthe  introduction  of  modern  signaling  systems;  and  (iii)  improving  operational  and  financial \nefficiency through institutional  (and particularly accounting) reform. This will (i) reduce fuel \nconsumption and enhance energy efficiency; (ii) reduce pollution; (iii) enhance railway safety; \n(iv) increase line capacity, benefitting consumers and producers of goods and services through \nthe provision of timely and efficient transport services and lower logistics costs; and (v) improve \nstaff productivity.2  \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The growth rate of the Indian economy has been close to 8% in the last 6 years; while \nthis is expected to continue for several years. India\u2019s transport infrastructure needs further \ninvestment to meet the country\u2019s growth demand. The Government of India\u2019s Eleventh Five \nYear Plan (FY2007/08\u2013FY2011/12) highlights the need for an efficient transportation system to \neffectively increase productivity and competitiveness in the world market. The development of \nvarious transport modes needs to be integrated to build an efficient, sustainable, safe, and \nregionally  balanced  transportation  system.  Railways  make  up  a  significant  part  of  India\u2019s \ntransport sector\u2014in FY2009/10, railways carried 7.5 billion passengers and 888 million tons (t) \nof freight. The railways\u2019 share, particularly of freight transport, has gone down steadily over the \npast few decades (from 89% in FY1950/51 to 30% in FY2007/08). \n \n4.  One of the most widespread constraints facing railway operations is the capacity of high-\ndensity railway routes. The railway trunk routes comprise just 16% of the network but carry \nmore than 50% of the traffic. The speed of freight trains on Indian Railways has stagnated at \naround 25 kilometers (km) per hour. Passenger services are also slow. Accidents per million \ntrain-km have been steadily reduced, from 5.5 per million train-km in FY1960/61 to 0.2 in \nFY2008/09. The operating ratio  improved from 91.0% in FY2004/05 to 75.9% in FY2007/08, but \nwas  90.5% in FY2008/09. Critical efficiency parameters have improved, such as the net t-km \nper  wagon  day  (from  2,574  in  FY2003/04  to  3,539  in  FY2007/08)  and  the  net  t-km  and \npassenger-km per employee (from 0.69 in FY2004/05 to 1.01 in FY2008/09). However, there is \nroom for further improvement. \n \n5.  The Indian Railways Vision 20203 estimates that an investment of around Rs14,000 \nbillion (about $310 billion) is needed for FY2010/11\u2013FY2020/21. Indian Railways would be able \nto generate about 64% of the investment required for FY2010/11\u2013FY2020/21 through internal \ngeneration and extra budgetary resources, including public\u2013private partnerships. The remaining \n36% would need to be provided through gross budgetary support from the central government. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory assistance. ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to \nIndia for Preparing the Railway Sector Investment Program. Manila. \n3   Ministry of Railways, Government of India. 2009. Indian Railways Vision 2020. New Delhi. ", "2 \nIndian Railways needs to generate more funds through its operations to finance the needed \nexpansion.  Together  with  capital  investment  to  augment  the  railway  network  capacity, \naccounting  reform  can  facilitate  greater  commercialization  of  railway  operations,  thereby \nincreasing revenue generation. The Indian Railways Vision 2020 highlights that critical elements \nof the plan include (i) removal of infrastructural bottlenecks, (ii) creation of adequate capacity, (iii) \ndesign  and  delivery  of  highly  efficient  market-driven  services,  (iv)  safety  and  reliability  of \noperations, and (v) building institutional and organizational capacity.  \n \n6.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed Railway Sector Improvement Project4 \nformulated a detailed reform program and provided support for implementation of the key reform \nmeasures, especially accounting reform; this is most critical for better financial governance and \nmanagement, and will lead to overall efficiency enhancement of Indian Railways. It was also \nrecognized by all parties that accounting reform that makes the costs and revenues of railway \nservices  and  operations  transparent  is  a  prerequisite  for  successful  implementation  of \nsubsequent reforms. As assessed in the ADB sector assistance program evaluation (SAPE),5 \nprogress on implementation of reforms has been mixed. Indian Railways implemented some of \nthe envisaged reforms.6 Private sector participation was substantially increased, especially in \nthe operation of container trains and terminals. Separating core and noncore businesses was \nstarted by creating subsidiaries to run several noncore businesses as separate business activity \ncenters. Computerization was undertaken on a massive scale to provide better services, and \nincrease the commercial orientation of Indian Railways. Other envisaged reforms, such as \nmaking concession of loss-making branch lines, are by themselves not realistic while some \nefforts were made. The accounting reform has been slow, but steady progress has been made, \nand continued ADB support is needed. Substantial progress has been made in putting in place \nthe prerequisites for implementation of the new accounting systems\u2014such as standardized \ncomputerization\u2014with  completion  targeted  for  2012.  As  recommended  by  the  SAPE,  new \nsupport is essential to continue implementation of the accounting reforms. \n \n7.  The Railway Sector Improvement Project reform program was overly ambitious, and \nsought to implement several major reforms in a relatively short timeframe and in a large, \ncomplex  organization.  A  focused  approach  on  the  accounting  system  is  considered  more \nappropriate and effective, as this is the core of all reform measures to enhance Indian Railways\u2019 \noverall operational efficiency. However, the reform process did allow for wider dialogue within \nIndian Railways, as well as wider government circles, on the need for reform. The importance of \naccounting reform has been accepted and incorporated in Indian Railways\u2019 own reform program \n(Indian Railways Vision 2020) and in the government\u2019s Eleventh Plan (FY2007/08\u2013FY2011/12).  \nAccounting reform implementation is now being monitored by the Planning Commission, which \nhas facilitated a continuing dialogue on the sector development between ADB and the Ministry \nof Railways (MOR). The detailed institutional strengthening action plan was agreed with MOR \nas set out in the framework financing agreement (FFA).7 \n \n8.  While  investments  under  the  investment  program  are  a  small  subset  of  the  total \ninvestment required  under Indian  Railways  Vision  2020,  they  underline  the  very  nature of \nprojects  that  the  vision  proposes  to  address:  capacity  enhancement,  connectivity,  and \nenvironmental sustainability. Investment in physical infrastructure under the investment program \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2002.

Two of the projects are in the eastern states of Chhattisgarh and Orissa, while the \nothers are mainly in the states of Maharashtra and Karnataka. Some of these are located in \nremote areas of the country that are rich in minerals and related industries. These routes and \nelectrification (i) are also along the Indian Railways\u2019 high density corridors, such as the \u201cGolden \nQuadrilateral\u201d that connects Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, and New Delhi; and (ii) connect ports \nand provide hinterland access. Finally, the lines carry heavy traffic such as ore, coal, and \ncement, which are best carried by rail. The modal shift of bulk goods from road to rail would \nreduce carbon emissions, and would possibly be eligible for carbon credits. \n \n9.  Transport infrastructure development is high priority for the government, making ADB\u2019s \nstrategy  of  reducing  poverty  through  infrastructure-led  growth  especially  relevant.  ADB\u2019s \ncontinued support for the railways will help from an environmental perspective, and is in line \nwith the country partnership strategy (2009\u20132012) for India,8 in terms of supporting inclusive \nand  environmentally  sustainable  growth.  The  investment  program  has  been  designed  in \ncoordination with development partners to ensure wide geographic coverage and avoid overlaps, \nand continues ADB support for institutional strengthening of MOR, with a focus on accounting \nreform in parallel with capacity augmentation of existing railway lines. Lessons from the ongoing \nproject were incorporated, and SAPE recommendations taken into account, e.g., enhancing the \nbid document to address more than 500 cost items, and engaging a general consultant to \nstrengthen  project  implementation  programming  capacity.  Project  readiness  is  substantially \nadvanced, e.g., the bid documents have been approved for issuance in 2011. \n  \n10.  The  FFA  provides  details  of the roadmap,  strategic  context,  policy  framework,  and \ninvestment  program.  The  MFF  is  the  modality  best  suited  for  the  proposed  large-scale \ninvestment  program.  It  provides  for  ADB  to  enter  into  a  sustained  partnership  with  the \ngovernment  for  a  long-term  investment,  with  larger  and  multiple  contracts  in  parallel  with \ncontinued support for railway efficiency improvement. All projects to be financed under the \ninvestment program have already been appraised. The use of an MFF allows the government \nand ADB to focus on institutional strengthening and project implementation, and to provide an \noptimal amount of timely financing by arranging contract packages in specialized components \nand/or a larger size, which stimulates more competition and increased participation by qualified \ncontractors. It also opens the possibility of exploring cofinancing opportunities in subsequent \ntranches, with the government financing a larger portion, as financing products for projects that \nreduce carbon emission are emerging (e.g., Global Action for Reconciling Economic Growth \nand Environmental Preservation by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation). \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The investment program will improve the transport network and promote greater mobility \nthat supports sustainable socioeconomic development in the country by developing an energy-\nefficient, safe, reliable, affordable, and environment-friendly railway system along corridors with \nheavy bulk freight traffic. \n \nC.

The government has requested an MFF in an amount of up to $500 million from ADB's \nordinary capital resources to help finance a part of the investment program. The MFF will \nconsist of several tranches, subject to the government's submission of related PFRs, execution \nof the related loan and project agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and \nconditions and undertakings set forth in the FFA. The government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere its independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from \nADB.

A general consultant is engaged to manage \nthe overall investment program and provide technical advice on implementation scheduling with \ncritical path analysis based on international best practice. Environmental considerations were \nenhanced by providing tree planting along the railways in addition to mandatory government \ntree planting. A modern signaling and telecommunication system will be provided that will \nenhance safety and environmental considerations such as light-emitting diode (LED) signals for \ngood visibility and use of solar panel systems in all non-electrified areas as primary means of \npower supply. \n \n22.  A preliminary study indicated that the potential exists for the investment program to \nregister CER credits with the CDM, due to substantial (0.9 million t) annual carbon emission \nreductions as a result of the modal shift from vehicular traffic along project corridors. Technical \nassistance will be provided separately along with the investment program to pursue CER credits \nand enhance Indian Railways\u2019 CDM activities, including possible registration under the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  The economic assessment12 was carried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for \nthe Economic Analysis of Projects.13 The program will enhance capacity to meet the anticipated \ntraffic demand and avoid diversion of incremental goods traffic onto the road network, which \nwould result in increased transport costs. The economic internal rate of return ranges from \n15.6% to 20.1% for individual projects, indicating that the proposed investment program is \neconomically viable. A sensitivity analysis tested the effects of possible negative changes in the \nkey parameters that determine the program\u2019s costs and benefits. This analysis indicates that the \nprogram\u2019s economic viability would remain satisfactory even under adverse scenarios. \n \n                                                \n12 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 ADB. 1997.

The financial assessment (footnote 12) was undertaken on an incremental basis using \nthe discounted cash flow method, and calculating the internal rate of return of the program. The \nexisting  single-line  railway  sections  are  operating  at  or  above  capacity;  without  capacity \naugmentation, they will not be able to carry the projected incremental traffic. The financial \ninternal rate of return ranges from 12.9% to 15.9%, which is above the average cost of capital \n(7.9%). Sensitivity and risk analyses indicate that the investment program\u2019s financial internal \nrate  of  return  is  robust  under  adverse  conditions.  Based  on  the  financial  projections  and \nfinancial evaluation, the program is considered both financially viable and sustainable. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  Institutional.  RVNL  is  primarily  a  project  delivery  organization.  The  administrative \ncontrol rests with MOR. RVNL has sufficient capacity to implement the program, which will be \nsupported by the general consultant for the overall program scheduling and coordination, in \naddition to the project-specific project management consultants for construction supervision. \n \n26.  Financial management. RVNL has satisfactory project financial accounting capacity \nand knowledge of ADB disbursement procedures. All finance units of the project implementation \nunits will be staffed before project commencement. The project accounts will be audited by the \nstatutory auditor. MOR and RVNL will establish and maintain separate project records and \naccounts to identify the financing resources received and expenditures, ensuring an adequate \naudit trail. RVNL has a quarterly internal audit which is reviewed by the audit committee. The \nstatutory auditor appointed by the government's Office of Comptroller and Auditor General will \nannually  audit  the  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  in  accordance  with \ninternational auditing standards. All recommendations of financial management assessment will \nbe  implemented  during  the  investment  program  implementation  such  as  reporting \nstandardization, strengthening project audit, and assessment of budget and actual expenditure \nfor better budgeting and control. \n \n27.  Procurement  and  anticorruption. RVNL has a chief vigilance officer to handle all \ngrievances including those relating to procurement. The Central Vigilance Commission, through \nits Chief Technical Examiners Organization, conducts systematic analysis and monitoring for \ncompliance with procurement procedures and rules as well as issues guidance and instructions \nto  prevent  any  irregularities.  The  independent  safety  commissioner  will  undertake  a  final \ntechnical  audit  before  commissioning.  Contracts  financed  by  ADB  will  use  a  procurement \nprocess and bidding documents that follow ADB\u2019s policies and include a policy statement on \navoiding corrupt practices. The government will publish information relating to the investment \nprogram\u2014 including business opportunities, and information on procurement of goods, works, \nand consulting services\u2014on RVNL and MOR websites. RVNL will also make available to ADB \non request copies of internal audit reports. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the government, MOR, and RVNL. The specific \nmeasures are described in the FAM (footnote 11).  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n28.  The railway will traverse Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and \nOrissa.  According  to  the  government\u2019s  Human  Development  Report  2001, 14 the  human \ndevelopment index for Maharashtra (0.523) and Karnataka (0.478) are higher than the national \nlevel of 0.472, while Andhra Pradesh (0.416), Chhattisgarh, and Orissa (0.404) are lower than \nthe national level. About 64% of the people living in the five states reside in rural areas; most \n                                                \n14  Government of India. National Planning Commission. 2001. National Human Development Report. New Delhi. \n ", "8 \nderive their livelihood from agriculture and labor. Poverty is particularly acute in the rural areas. \nAccording to 2005 government estimates, the proportion of the rural population living below the \nofficial poverty line in Orissa (46%), Chhattisgarh (41%), and Maharashtra (31%) are above the \nnational  average  (28%).  The  poverty  and  social  assessment  (PSA)  surveyed  11,297 \nhouseholds and held 125 focus group discussions, participated in by men and women; the \nmajority  stated  that  the  investment  program  will  increase  economic  and  employment \nopportunities  by  improving  linkages  to  markets,  production  centers,  and  public  and  social \nservice facilities. Approximately 21 million people living in the areas influenced by the program \nwill experience direct and indirect economic benefits brought about by the proposed investment, \nand about 5,400 person-years of work will be created for laborers during construction.15 \n \n29.  Gender. Data from 2009 indicate the average gender development index in the five \nstates as 0.586, close to the national figure of 0.590. The gender development indexes for \nMaharashtra (0.677) and Karnataka (0.611) are above that of India, while the indexes for \nAndhra Pradesh (0.574), Chhattisgarh (0.542), and Orissa (0.524) are below the national level. \nA  total  of  91  focus  group  discussions  were  undertaken  with  914  women  from  different \nsocioeconomic groups. Women stated that the investment will benefit them, as increased train \nreliability  and  frequency  will  facilitate  industrial  development  and  economic  growth.  The \nparticipation of both men and women has been ensured during project planning and will also be \nensured during implementation. MOR established the Railway Women\u2019s Welfare Organization \nin 1962, which has successfully contributed to women\u2019s empowerment by increasing the self-\nsufficiency of women. The same effects for women are expected to be attained under this \ninvestment. The bidding documents provide clauses designed to ensure that all civil works \ncontractors  comply  with  applicable  labor  laws;  do  not  employ  child  labor;  encourage  the \nemployment of the poor, particularly women; and do not offer different wages to men and \nwomen, particularly for work of equal value. The nongovernment organization responsible for \nresettlement plan implementation will employ a gender expert to ensure implementation of \ncontracts. The expert will also train poor women to upgrade their livelihood skills, and conduct \ngender and child labor awareness campaigns. \n \n30.  HIV and AIDS. Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra are all noted to have a \nhigh prevalence of HIV/AIDS by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) and have been \nconducting HIV sentinel surveillance since 1998 as part of NACO\u2019s National AIDS Control \nProgram. All five states traversed by the railway have their own state AIDS control or prevention \nsociety and are committed to tackle HIV/AIDS, undertaking a multipronged and multisectoral \napproach in prevention and control; programs include mass media campaigns, adolescence \neducation,  and  awareness  building  in  women\u2019s  self-help  groups,  and  improving  access  to \ntesting  facilities.  The  states  also  collaborate  closely  with  other  development  partners  in \nprevention and treatment efforts. Chhattisgarh and Orissa have a low prevalence of HIV/AIDS, \nbut intense prevention and communication programs are ongoing. MOR has an AIDS control \ncell in MOR and its operational zones, and has adopted a wide range of national policies for HIV \ncontrol since 1997. The focus of the cell is to improve awareness among all employees and \nothers  associated  with  the  Indian  Railways  community  and  introduce  HIV/AIDS training to \nmedical and paramedical staff. \n \n31.  Based on the PSA, there is no risk that the investment program will increase HIV/AIDS \nincidence. Contractors will carry out HIV/AIDS awareness for their laborers at work sites and \nthis will be monitored by the general consultant during project implementation. In addition, with \nthe State AIDS Control Society, NACO, and other public health agencies, the nongovernment \n                                                \n15 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \norganizations  responsible  for  implementing  the  resettlement  plan  will  carry  out  HIV/AIDS \ninformation campaigns in communities in areas influenced by the program. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n32.  Environmental impact. There are no environmentally sensitive features in the areas \naffected  by  the  proposed  investment,  and  the  program  has  been  categorized  as  B  in \naccordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Initial environmental examinations \nprepared for all the projects show that the environmental impacts associated with establishment \nof double tracks, including embankment construction, are minor, with most impacts likely to \noccur during the construction stage. Recommended mitigation measures will be implemented \nunder the environmental management plan and monitored under the environmental monitoring \nplan. The general consultants will conduct a training program to strengthen the capacity of \nRVNL officials to address environmental concerns, including supervising implementation of the \nenvironmental management and monitoring plans. An environmental assessment and review \nframework  has  been  prepared  to  guide  the  implementation  of  environment  safeguard \nrequirements for the investment program and subsequent tranches. \n \n33.  Land acquisition and resettlement. The investment program is categorized as A in \naccordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement. Six resettlement plans were prepared in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement; the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (amended \nin 1984); and the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy (2007). According to the \nproject census, 3,945 persons will be affected by the projects, out of which 76 households will \nbe physically displaced and 344 economically displaced. The total resettlement budget for the \nprogram is Rs135,033,578. Compensation rates for the loss of land and structures, shifting \nassistance, income restoration assistance, and additional support for vulnerable groups are \nprovided in the resettlement framework and resettlement plans. Meaningful consultation and \ninformation disclosure were undertaken during the preparation of resettlement plans, including \nwith (i) project-displaced persons and (ii) the general public through the ADB website. If any \nchanges  or  additional  land  requirements  or  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  are  identified \nduring implementation, a related resettlement plan will be prepared or modified according to the \napplicable laws referred to in the resettlement plan. ADB\u2019s prior approval will be obtained before \nfurther implementation of the relevant section of the subproject. \n \n34.  Impact on indigenous peoples. The investment program is classified as category B in \naccordance with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement. Scheduled tribes account for 31.8% of \nthe total population in Chhattisgarh, 16.6% in Orissa, 8.9% in Maharashtra, 6.6% in Karnataka, \nand 6.6% in Andhra Pradesh. The tribal population is scattered and not concentrated in any \nparticular project areas, and interacts freely with the outside community. The study undertaken \nduring  investment  program  preparation  did  not  show  any  difference  in  impact  between \nindigenous and non-indigenous groups in the project locations. The PSA survey confirmed that \nthe socioeconomic impacts of the investment program will not differ significantly for tribal groups \ncompared with the remainder of the population. In addition, meaningful consultations were \nconducted  with  both  primary  and  secondary  stakeholders  to  obtain  a  comprehensive \nperspective on the investment program and its impacts, and to obtain an estimate of losses that \nthey would suffer and to develop ways to mitigate those losses. Special provisions have been \nmade under the resettlement plans to address impacts on indigenous peoples. An indigenous \npeoples planning framework was prepared to address any unanticipated impacts on indigenous \npeoples during the implementation of existing or additional projects. If any significant impacts on \nindigenous peoples are identified, an indigenous peoples plan will be prepared and submitted to \nADB for approval. \n ", "10 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n35.  The  key  risks  are  delays  in  implementation  (Table  4).  Other  risks  and  mitigating \nmeasures are summarized in the risk assessment and risk management plan.16 The integrated \nbenefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Key Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nSafeguard  (i) Due diligence will be based on the final location survey; (ii) the adverse impacts of land \ncompliance  acquisition, and social and environmental impacts will be mitigated through engineering measures; \n(iii) before commencing construction, a due diligence mission will be fielded to ensure compliance; \nand (iv) a project management consultant and general consultants will be engaged to help ensure \nfull compliance with safeguard requirements during implementation. \nProject  (i) Advance actions have been made for high implementation readiness; (ii) contracts will packaged \nimplementation to attract qualified contractors; (iii) the bill of quantity will take into account the complex character of \nrailway projects; and (iv) a general consultant will be engaged to oversee the coordination and \nprogramming of the overall investment program, in addition to conventional subproject-level specific \nproject management consultants. \nInstitutional  A progress is made of accounting systems enhancement in synchronization with Government \nstrengthening  Accounting Standards Advisory Board: (i) new accounting systems have been developed, and \nactions  prerequisite standardized computerization substantially progressed; (ii) the appointment of firms or \nagencies to implement the new accounting systems is being finalized; and (iii) close monitoring will \nbe undertaken by the apex body of the Government of India for implementation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n36.  The Government of India, MOR, and RVNL have assured ADB that implementation of \nthe investment program shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the FAM and loan documents. \n \n37.  The government, MOR, and RVNL have agreed with ADB on certain undertakings for \nthe MFF, which are set forth in the FFA. Specific covenants agreed by the government, MOR, \nand RVNL with respect to individual tranches under the MFF will be set forth in the loan \nagreement and project agreement for the respective tranches. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount not exceeding $500,000,000 to India for the Railway Sector Investment Program from \nADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the framework financing \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n28 July 2011 \n                                                \n16 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \n    National and state  Various government \nImproved transport  The elasticity of rail  socioeconomic data and  development activities \nnetwork and greater  transport to gross  statistics (e.g., economic  are effectively \nmobility  domestic product along the  survey of the state and  coordinated with road \nproject corridor to be  country, annual  sector investment. \nmaintained at about 0.8  statistical statements of   \n(achieved in FY2008/09)   MOR)  Risk \n  Multimodal mix is not \nContribution of railway  optimally integrated. \nsector in the overall \ntransport sector in states \nincreased by 20% by 2020 \n(equaled 11% in \nMaharashtra in \nFY2009/10) \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n    Post-implementation  The government timely \nEnergy-efficient, safe,  After investment program  measurement  provides maintenance \nreliable, affordable  completion:    throughout the project \nand environment-   Data collected through  life. \nfriendly railway  (i) average travel time  the Indian Railways    \nsystem developed  along project rail routes  asset management  Full utilization of \nreduced by half (e.g.,  system, and ADB  allocated funds for \naverage speed increased  technical assistance  capital and \nto 40 km/hour from 20    maintenance works \nkm/hour for goods);  Social and household   \n  survey  Investment planned in \n(ii) annual accident rate    Indian Railways Vision \nreduced by 20% (from  2020 is realized. \n0.20 in FY2008/09)   \n  The government \n(iii) annual CO  emission  enforces its transport \n2\nalong the project corridors  policy, e.g., overloading \nreduced by 0.9 million due  control of trucks, etc. \nto modal shift from \nvehicles (from estimated \nbaseline of 1.1 million t of \nCO ); \n2\n \n(iv) financial sustainability \nof railway operations \nimproved by 20% (e.g., \noperating ratio at 90.5% in \nFY2008/09); and   \n \n(v) efficiency of railway \noperations (e.g., \npassenger-km plus net t-\nkm per employee) equals \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \n1.4 (from 1.01 in \nFY2008/09) \nOutputs      Assumptions \n    Executing agency\u2019s  Government \n1.
