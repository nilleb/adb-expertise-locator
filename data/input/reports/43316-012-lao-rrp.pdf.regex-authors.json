I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the \nPakse Urban Environmental Improvement Project.1 \n2.  The project will enhance the competitiveness of Pakse as a regional economic and \ntourism center of the southern Lao PDR. It responds to the local government\u2019s vision for Pakse to \nbecome a green city and for the greater Pakse urban area to gain official city status in the future2 \nby improving citywide environmental improvements in solid waste management, flood protection \nand drainage, and riverbank erosion protection along the Xedon River; supporting community-\ndriven initiatives in urban environmental improvements; strengthening local capacity in urban \nplanning  and  services;  and  strengthening  local  capacity  in  project  management  and \nimplementation.3 The  project  contributes  to  the  Government  of  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  long-term \nurbanization strategy and Pakse Urban Development Strategy, 2011\u20132030.4\n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale  \n3.  Pakse is the largest urban center in the southern Lao PDR and the capital of Champasack \nprovince. Since the mid-1990s, it has grown to become a regional commercial and service center \nin the country and the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). It is becoming an important tourism hub \nand staging post for the southern Lao PDR and the GMS. Pakse is strategically located on the \nregional road network (Road 13) and on an interconnector link from the East\u2013West Economic \nCorridor to the Southern Economic Corridor in the GMS.5 Pakse district\u2019s population in 2010 was \n77,647; this is expected to double by 2030 based on annual growth of 3%. The population of \ngreater Pakse urban area6 in 2011 was about 107,600; this is expected to grow to 138,700 by \n2020 and 176,100 by 2030. Champasack\u2019s gross domestic product growth has averaged 9.8% \nsince 2006, driven largely by industry and services, accounting for 60% of total economic output in \n2010 compared to 49% in 2006. Revenue from tourism, banking, transport, and construction have \nalso surged. Pakse has significant natural attractions and is near major cultural and heritage sites \nsuch as Wat Phou. Tourism development has helped stimulate local investment in tourism-related \nfacilities and generate local employment. Since 2005, tourist arrivals in Champasack Province \nhave grown by an average of 20% per year, especially via the Cambodia and Thailand borders.7 \n4.  Despite  these  growth  opportunities,  Pakse  is  experiencing  rapid  environmental \ndegradation caused by significant urbanization and economic growth pressures. It has witnessed \nan  increase  in  traffic,  tourists,  and  commercial  activities.  Improvement  of  basic  urban  and \nenvironmental infrastructure and strengthening of local capacity to plan and manage urban growth \nare key steps in developing Pakse as a sustainable, livable, and competitive city. \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Based  on  Champasack  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  Pakse  District  Socioeconomic \nDevelopment Report, and Government Notification No. 1094/GOV/7 June 2011 to gain official city status. \n3  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA).  (ADB.  2010. \nTechnical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Pakse Urban Environmental Improvement \nProject. Manila [TA 7567-LAO].) \n4  The draft National Urban Sector Strategy prioritizes Pakse based on its growth and regional location. Ministry of \nPublic Works and Transport. 2011. The National Urban Sector Strategy and Investment Plan to the Year 2020. \nVientiane: Department of Housing and Urban Planning (final draft). Pakse Urban Development Strategy, 2011\u2013\n2030 was approved by the Office of Provincial Governor Champasack on 8 November 2011 (Decision No. 1445). \n5  The East\u2013West Economic Corridor passes through the Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam,  and the \nSouthern Economic Corridor passes through Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n6  Includes 42 villages in Pakse district, 13 villages in Phonthong district, and four villages in Bachiang district. \n7  Pakse Tourism Development (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "2  \n5.  Urban issues and challenges. Urbanization in the Lao PDR is taking place with minimal \ncoordination, inadequate infrastructure, and limited consideration for the environment, including \nclimate change issues. Results include disorganized growth, inefficient land use, damage and loss \nof natural resources, and insufficient urban services. The problems can be attributed to weak \nurban management, little strategic spatial planning, poor linkages between urban planning and \nenvironmental management, and insufficient investment in infrastructure and community services. \nThe Pakse Urban Development Strategy, 2011\u20132030 is a significant step in moving away from \ntraditional urban master plans to guide Pakse\u2019s future urban growth. \n6.  Weak urban management caused by overlapping responsibilities is also a challenge. In \n1998, an urban development administration authority (UDAA) was created in Pakse and other \nsecondary towns to facilitate effective urban management. It was envisaged that UDAAs would \neventually be transformed into autonomous municipalities. A number of regulations support the \ndecentralization  of  government  functions  and  clarification  of  UDAAs\u2019  responsibilities,  but  the \nprocess has been slow. Preparation of a municipality administration decree will help to clarify the \nroles  and  responsibilities  of  UDAAs,  provincial  Departments  of  Public  Works  and  Transport \n(DPWTs), and district Offices of Public Works and Transport (OPWTs).8 In the interim, the project \nwill support capacity development activities for Pakse UDAA (P-UDAA) and Champasack DPWT \n(C-DPWT) based on the approved road map for urban management in transition, which reflects \nPakse\u2019s application to become a city (or Nakhone).9  \n7.  The urban poor suffer disproportionately from inadequate provision, management, and \nmaintenance of urban infrastructure and services. Underinvestment and insufficient operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of existing infrastructure in low-lying areas have had an adverse impact on \ntheir  health  and  access  to  livelihood  opportunities.  The  urban  poor  are  vulnerable  to  risks \nassociated with externalities in service provision, as they are unable to cope with the effects of \npoor drainage, inadequate sanitation and flooding, and poor road quality. About 35% of the \n663 households surveyed live below the poverty line.10 The project targets improved drainage in \nlow-lying areas and supports household sanitation improvements for the poor. \n8.  Inadequate solid waste management poses serious environmental and health risks, and \nadversely affects Pakse\u2019s ability to function as a regional economic center. The Environmental \nRegulation for the  Urban Area  of Pakse  No.  160  (14  May  2001)  provides  for  proper  waste \nmanagement.11 However, challenges confronting the solid waste sector in Pakse include lack of \nfinancial resources to develop, operate, and maintain facilities; inadequate capacity to manage \nservices and concession contracts; low environmental awareness of residents; and generally low \nwillingness to pay for solid waste services. The P-UDAA household collection rate is about 21% in \nthe greater Pakse urban area, focusing on 28 of 43 villages in Pakse district. Households pay an \naverage of KN18,000 per month for collection and disposal, while commercial entities pay a tipping \nfee of KN100 per kilogram. About 25 tons of waste per day are transported to the landfill site, \nlocated 17 kilometers from the town center.12 About 22% of households recycle at the source and \n65% reportedly burn their waste. The project will assist P-UDAA to improve overall solid waste \nmanagement, facilitate amendments to the existing concession for waste processing, support \nbehavioral change efforts, and assist C-DPWT in enforcing environmental protection regulations. \n                                                \n8  The government envisions that provincial towns will become municipalities before they gain city status. The key \ndifference between a municipality and a city is population size, as a city needs to have a population of 80,000. \n9  Champasack Provincial Governor Decision No. 611/CPS (16 May 2012);Prime Minister Instruction No. 01 (March \n2001); Prime Ministerial Decree No. 141 (May 2000); and Law on Local Administration (2003). Urban Institutional \nAnalysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 Prime Minister Decree No. 285 (October 2009). The poverty line is based on KN240,000 per person per month. \n11 It refers to the Environment Protection Law (3 April 1999) and the Prime Ministerial Decree for UDAA No. 177. \n12 Solid waste composition and volume was surveyed in 2010. Technical Report on Solid Waste Management in Pakse \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "3 \n9.  Poor drainage and increased flooding create poor environmental conditions, increase the \nhealth risk from waterborne and water-related diseases, and contribute to a low quality of life for \nresidents. Pakse and its immediate surroundings are susceptible to flooding, as it lies at the \nconfluence of the Mekong and Xedon rivers. Its central area is relatively flat, while the drainage \ncapacity of small rivers in the town is limited. Flooding often occurs when the small streams back \nup because of surface runoff from the surrounding hills during heavy rainfall, or when river levels \nrise during the wet season. Property becomes inundated or surrounded by stagnant water. This is \nexacerbated when drainage easements are obstructed and retention areas are filled. The project \nsupports implementation of the drainage strategy, 2011\u20132015 to manage flood risk better, retain \nnatural drainage in nine catchment areas, and guide drainage system development in Pakse.13 \n10.  Riverbank  erosion  caused  by  annual  floods  results  in  progressive  weakening  of  the \nriverbanks and creates instability at various locations. Riverbank erosion along the Xedon and \nMekong rivers is a major challenge. While riverbank protection is expensive, the loss of valuable \nriverside land and property such as temples has very high social, cultural, and economic impacts. \nFlooding and rapid drawdown of the river level are the dominant causes of riverbank erosion and \ndamage. The project will support riverbank erosion protection along the Xedon River.  \n11.  Basic household sanitation and de-sludging services are limited in Pakse. About 30% of \nthe households surveyed use septic tanks, 67% use pit latrines, and 3% do not have any latrine. \nAbout 73% of households have never emptied their septic tanks, while about 41% complain about \nthe effluence and bad odor from sanitary facilities. Problems with septic tanks are related to poor \ndesign,  poor  quality  construction,  and  infrequent  cleaning.  About  50%  of  those  that  use \ndesludging tanker services emptied their tanks every year. The project will assist poor households \nto improve their sanitation facilities and help P-UDAA improve existing de-sludging services.14 \n12.  Related policies and  strategies. The project is in line with the Lao PDR\u2019s Seventh \nNational Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2011\u20132015, which envisions graduation from least-\ndeveloped country status by 2020. The project focuses on achieving sustainable and inclusive \ndevelopment by transforming the key urban growth area into a competitive and green urban \ncenter\u2014a strategy central to the government\u2019s draft national urban sector strategy and local \nsocioeconomic development plans. The project is also in line with the GMS strategy to transform \ntransport corridors into economic corridors. It has synergies with ADB\u2019s GMS Sustainable Tourism \nDevelopment Project15 and the proposed GMS Corridor Towns Development Project. The country \npartnership strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the Lao PDR, 2012\u20132016 also \nemphasizes  stronger  rural\u2013urban  linkages  through  improved  urban  services  and  municipal \ninfrastructure. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 under \nStrategy 2020, which fosters competitive, inclusive, and green cities by improving performance in \neconomic, equity, and environment areas.16 \n13.  Development partner coordination exists and will be strengthened through the technical \nworking group on infrastructure (subgroup on urban development, water supply, and sanitation), \nchaired by the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT). ADB has been a lead partner in \n                                                \n13 Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, National Disaster Management Office, 2011, National Disaster Management \nPlan, 2011\u20132015 (draft, April, with support from the United Nations Development Programme). \n14 P-UDAA has about 30% of the septage services market on a volume basis and charges KN300,000 per trip. Three \nprivate entities also provide de-sludging services. \n15 ADB. 2008.

The  Norwegian  Agency  for \nDevelopment  Cooperation  and  United  Nations  Development  Programme  previously  supported \nlandfill construction in Pakse. Parallel financing opportunities will be explored during implementation. \n14.  Lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in the urban development sector in the Lao PDR are \nincorporated in the project design. The project builds on the support provided to Pakse under \nADB\u2019s Secondary Towns Urban Development Project and recommendations from ADB evaluation \nreports.17 Key lessons include: (i) active community participation and decentralized decision \nmaking are key to enhancing ownership and strengthening the capacity of communities and \nlocal  government  agencies;  (ii)  support  for  community  planning  complements  central  (or \nprovincial) urban and regional plans; (iii) overlapping and ambiguous responsibilities should be \nresolved prior to investments in the sector; (iv) a more open-ended policy dialogue may be more \nhelpful than the application of loan covenants; (v) a multisector approach in the urban sector in \nLao PDR is implementable, as subsectors are within the mandate of a single ministry; and (vi) \nUDAAs often have insufficient funds and require budgetary support for O&M of infrastructure. \n15.  Special features. The project is in line with the Pakse Urban Development Strategy, \n2011\u20132030, which integrates provincial and district socioeconomic objectives with overall national \nand sector objectives. It will facilitate efficient urban development and investment through a \nphased and more flexible approach. The project supports investments aimed at improving the \nconditions of the urban poor and low-income households, thereby maximizing potential project \nbenefits. It promotes community-driven urban development and community-led service delivery \nthrough village grants, which help to support a balanced approach to urban land use planning and \nreinforce the interlinks between urban environmental improvements, health, and well-being. It \nincludes support for continued policy dialogue and coordination at the national level to strengthen \ndecentralized urban management and services. It includes support to implement and monitor a \npublic\u2013private partnership in solid waste management for possible replication in other towns. It \nalso supports transformation of corridor towns to economic hubs and growth engines. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The impact of the project is improved competitiveness of Pakse as a regional economic \nand tourism center of the southern Lao PDR. The outcome will be increased quality, reliability, \nand coverage of urban infrastructure and environmental improvements in the greater Pakse \nurban area. By 2018, the project will enhance the urban environment, improve public health, \nand contribute to improved urban services for about 135,000 residents. It builds on a medium-\nterm investment planning exercise and prefeasibility study supported by the Cities Development \nInitiative for Asia in 2010, which prioritized improved solid waste management, improved urban \ndrainage, riverbank protection, and institutional capacity development and strengthening.18 The \nproject will pursue an integrated program of investments in priority infrastructure rehabilitation, \nimprovement and extension of urban services, and organizational and capacity development of \nurban development and management agencies. \n                                                \n17 ADB. 2011.

Outputs \n17.  The project will have the following four outputs in the greater Pakse urban area: \n18.  Output 1: Citywide environmental improvements will focus on the following: \n(i)  Improved  solid  waste  management,  including  support  for  better  collection, \ntransportation, processing, and disposal of waste. This will include procurement of \nsolid waste collection and landfill equipment; improvement and capacity increase of \nthe existing landfill (or open dump) to a controlled landfill standard; possible landfill \nexpansion to accommodate increased volumes of waste resulting from increased \ncollection;  and  improvement  of  an  existing  concession  contract  with  Khamtay \nGeneral Agricultural and Trading Co. Ltd. in solid waste processing and recycling.19 \n(ii)  Improved flood protection and drainage conditions, including support for drainage \nimprovements and maintenance of natural drainage paths, major culverts, and \nfloodwater retention areas. This includes installment of new storm-water pumping \nstations, construction or rehabilitation of flap gates, and construction of a new \noutlet channel; construction of primary and secondary drains in priority catchments, \nmaintenance  of  flood  retention  areas  and  green  space,  and  improvement  or \nconstruction of access roads for drainage maintenance.20 The project adapts a \nsustainable approach to floodplain management, consistent with Pakse\u2019s vision of \nbeing a green and environmentally sustainable city.  \n(iii)  Riverbank erosion protection along the Xedon River, which will support riverbank \nreinforcement along three kilometers of Xedon River\u2014along both sides from the \nRussian Bridge to the French Bridge and on the left side at Wat Ban Kea. \n19.  Output 2: Community-driven urban environmental improvements will enhance community \nparticipation through (i) improved solid waste collection and management in villages of greater \nPakse urban area through village grants (output 2.1), and (ii) improved household sanitation \nthrough  sanitation  grants  (output  2.2).21 The  project  will  support  each  village  development \ncommittee  in  local  urban  planning,  prioritization  and  selection  of  small-scale  infrastructure \ninvestments, and identification of poor households for sanitation improvements. Output 2.1 will be \nfinanced by the project funds (80%), government funds (10%), and community funds (10%). The \nproject will also increase public awareness in solid waste management and support P-UDAA to \nimprove septage collection, treatment, and disposal. \n20.  Output 3: Strengthened capacity for provincial urban planning and services supports \nurban agencies in Pakse to deliver quality, reliable urban services based on an agreed road \nmap for Pakse urban management in transition. It includes (i) strengthened capacity of P-UDAA \nin urban management and service delivery through better management of private concessions \nand improved operational and financial performance; (ii) strengthened capacity of C-DPWT and \nparticipating OPWTs in urban planning and development control; and (iii) enhanced gender \nequity in urban planning, management, and service delivery through 1-year project internships \nfor about 40 students (50% women).22 \n                                                \n19 A sanitary landfill is not feasible in Pakse because of high initial and operating costs, low volumes of waste \ncurrently generated, high levels of technical expertise required, and people\u2019s low willingness to pay for collection. \nP-UDAA signed a concession contract on 20 June 2011 (contract no. 099/UDAA).  \n20 Provincial Governor Notification No. 478/DGPS (10 June 2011) on the enforcement of retention areas and \ndrainage easement protection (Pakse Urban Development Strategy, 2011\u20132030). \n21 Output 2.1 is estimated at $35 per capita per village, and output 2.2 at about $180 per household for pour-flush \ntoilets and $450 for a toilet with septic tank. Output 2 builds on ADB\u2019s experience in similar projects (footnote 17). \n22 Interns will be selected from educational and vocational institutions in Pakse, including Champasack University. Each \nintern will sign an agreement with the project management and implementation unit (PMIU) prior to participating in the \nprogram and receiving a stipend (about $1,250 for per diem, travel, and insurance). \n ", "6  \n21.  Output 4: Strengthened capacity for project management and implementation will focus \non the project coordination unit (PCU) and project management and implementation unit (PMIU). \nCapacity development activities may be extended to provincial project steering committee (PPSC) \nmembers, and staff from C-DPWT, P-UDAA, and participating OPWTs in the greater Pakse \nurban area. It will include skills enhancement and training in project design and supervision, \ngender and community development, accounting and financial management, procurement and \ndisbursement, environmental and social safeguards, and other areas agreed to in advance with \nADB.  It  will  support  on-the-job  training  for  C-DPWT  and  P-UDAA  in  urban  planning  and \ndevelopment, solid waste collection, and landfill management. \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n22.  The project is estimated to cost $31.74 million (Table 1). The government requested a \nloan equivalent to SDR15,904,000 and a grant equivalent to $3.25 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the project.23 The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft financing agreement. \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.

A PCU will be located in the Department of Housing and Urban Planning \nof MPWT and a PMIU in P-UDAA, with staff from both implementing agencies. A PPSC will be \nestablished in Champasack province, with the vice provincial governor as chair and the Pakse \ndistrict governor as vice-chair. Ad hoc coordination meetings at the national level will be chaired by \nthe vice minister of the MPWT, with the vice governor of Champasack as vice-chair. The PMIU will \nreport  directly  to  the  Pakse  district  governor  on  project-related  matters.  Implementation \narrangements are in Table 3 and described in detail in the project administration manual (PAM). 24 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2012\u2013June 2018 (6 years) \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2018 \nManagement   \n(i)   Ad hoc coordination  Vice  minister,  MPWT  (chair);  vice  governor,  Champasack  Province  (vice-chair); \nmeetings (national)  representatives from Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and \nInvestment, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment; Pakse district governor; PMIU \ndirector and deputy director; and Lao Women\u2019s Union (participants)  \n(ii)   Project coordination unit   PCU coordinator (head); procurement officer, accountant, treasurer, secretary, and driver (members) \n(iii)  Provincial project  Vice provincial governor, Champasack province (chair); district governor, Pakse District \nsteering committee   (vice-chair);  representatives  from  PCU,  C-DPWT,  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban \nPlanning, PMIU director and deputy director, Bachiang and Phonthong districts, Department \nof Finance, Department of Planning and Investment, Department of Home Affairs, Department of \nNatural Resources and Environment, and Champasack Lao Women\u2019s Union (members) \n(iv)  Executing agency  MPWT  \n(v)  Implementing agencies  C-DPWT and P-UDAA.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n25.  The  project  will  enhance  the  urban  environment  in  Pakse  through  the  selection  of \ntechnologies focused on durability and sustainability. Citywide improvements target priority areas \nwhere there is maximum impact on local communities and the environment, such as greater \nwaste  collection  and  organized  disposal,  drainage  in  low-lying  flooded  areas,  and  targeted \nriverbank protection. Engineering solutions for infrastructure and equipment are appropriate and \ndeveloped based on technical viability and compatibility with local conditions, particularly with \nrespect to local O&M capacity. To ensure durability and continuity of the proposed infrastructure, \ncontract packages will attract contractors with appropriate skills and experience. Community-\ndriven improvements will respond to local planning and prioritization results. Household sanitation \nimprovements will be based on function, cost, and long-term durability in an urban setting. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n26.  An economic analysis was conducted following ADB\u2019s guidelines and best practices. The \nproject contributes significantly to the improved economic welfare of Pakse residents. Drainage \nand sanitation components will significantly reduce the incidence and severity of flooding, reduce \nponding of polluted water in public areas, provide sanitation facilities in public areas and schools, \nenhance environmental and living conditions, and improve public health. The base case economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) is 15.8% for solid waste management, 21.8%\u201339.7% for drainage \nand storm water, and 26.2%\u201330.9% for riverbank protection. All EIRRs are higher than ADB\u2019s \n12% economic opportunity cost of capital. Sensitivity analysis showed that the EIRRs are most \nvulnerable to changes in anticipated benefits. \n27.  A financial  analysis  was  conducted  following  ADB guidelines  and  best  practices. The \nfinancial viability was assessed for solid waste management improvements, as the project\u2019s only \nrevenue-earning component. The financial internal rate of return is 3.5%, which exceeds the \nweighted average cost of capital of 0.4%, indicating financial viability. The remaining components \nare nonrevenue generating, so a financial sustainability analysis for P-UDAA was completed. While \nP-UDAA is recovering O&M costs for solid waste management through user charges, the analysis \nfound that it is unable to meet recurrent costs for collective urban services. The project will assist P-\nUDAA to improve its financial performance through activities such as corporate planning, annual \nbudget reviews, and establishment of an urban services charge. It will assist P-UDAA to undertake \nperiodic reviews of its solid waste management activities, highlighting the importance of translating \ncost recovery into continuous planning, operations, and ongoing construction for landfill expansion \nand landfill closure to absorb the amounts of waste collected. \nC.  Governance \n28.  A financial management and a procurement capacity assessment of the MPWT and P-\nUDAA helped to confirm the project implementation arrangements, which follow previous ADB \nurban development projects in the Lao PDR. The executing and implementing agencies have \nexperience in managing externally funded projects and have sufficient capacity to undertake \ninternational and national competitive bidding for civil works packages. Output 4 will strengthen \nthe capacity of PMIU staff and provide on-the-job support. The PCU will also help build local \ncapacity through its review of procurement and disbursement documents. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and \nMPWT. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n ", "9 \nD.  Poverty and Social \n29.  The project will have significant positive social and environmental impacts, which will \nimprove the overall attractiveness of Pakse and allow residents to seize commercial opportunities. \nIt will improve the lives and health of communities and individuals by (i) enhancing air quality from \nindiscriminate burning of waste; (ii) improving accessibility, which may be otherwise hampered by \nflooding; (iii) reducing vulnerability along the Xedon River; and (iv) enhancing local ownership and \nawareness  about  environmental  sanitation.  The  project  is  category  II\u2014effective  gender \nmainstreaming. It will improve women\u2019s access to basic urban infrastructure and services. A \ngender analysis and action plan has been prepared for the project, which creates opportunities for \nwomen  to  access  training  (33%)  and  project  internships  (50%),  to  participate  in  project \nimplementation units (33%), and to be employed in community infrastructure O&M (40%). \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  The safeguard category for indigenous peoples is C, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009).  About  95%  of  the  population  in  the  greater  Pakse  urban  area  is \nTai Kadai (Lao majority). The Mon-Khmer ethnic group and some foreign migrants (Vietnamese \nand Chinese) also reside in the project area. Most of the Mon-Khmer group lives in Bachiang \ndistrict, and are well-integrated into Lao society. No adverse impacts are anticipated on Mon-\nKhmer group or migrants in the project area. \n31.  The  safeguard  category  for  involuntary  resettlement  is  B.  A  resettlement  plan  and \nresettlement framework25 have been prepared. About 224 affected households or 1,250 affected \npersons will incur minor impacts. One affected household (or three affected persons) will be \nseverely affected by riverbank erosion protection. The cost is estimated to be $2.36 million, which \nincludes base costs, allowances, and contingencies. A cutoff date has been established with \nextensive  stakeholder  consultation  and  participation.  A  project  information  booklet  has  been \ndisclosed to affected persons, which will be updated and distributed during implementation. \n32.  The safeguard category for the environment is B. An initial environmental examination \n(IEE) and an environmental assessment review framework have been prepared. The potential \nenvironmental impacts are related to siting, design, construction, and operation, and are not \nexpected to cause irreversible adverse environment impacts. Environment management plans \n(EMPs)  have  been  prepared  for  solid  waste  management,  drainage,  and  riverbank  erosion \nprotection. The EMPs will form part of the bidding and contract documents. The potential adverse \nimpacts  during  construction  are  expected  to  be  temporary  and  can  be  mitigated  through \ncompliance with the EMPs. The project includes support for EMP implementation and monitoring. \n33.  Resettlement and environment documents have been prepared in consultation with local \ncommunities and are in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and Lao PDR laws \nand  regulations.  The  documents  have  been  endorsed,  approved  and  posted  on  the  ADB \nwebsite.26 A grievance redress mechanism will help to facilitate resolution of complaints regarding \nproject performance. The resettlement plan, IEE, and EMPs will be updated and disclosed after \ndetailed design and cleared by ADB prior to contract awards. \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  The key project risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and all risks are \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.27 \n                                                \n25 Also referred to as land acquisition and compensation plan and land acquisition and compensation framework. \n26 The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment issued its Certificate No. 2271/MONRE on 30 March 2012. \n27 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10  \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nTrade and investments in Pakse and Champasack  The project includes environmental improvements focused on \nprovince are adversely affected by natural disasters.  flood control, erosion protection, and solid waste management. \nThe concession contract with the private sector for  The project includes capacity development activities to strengthen \nthe waste processing facility fails.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n35.  The government and the MPWT have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan and grant documents. \n36.  The government and the MPWT have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the financing agreement. In addition to the standard conditions for \nthe award of civil works, the government and the MPWT have agreed to the following additional \nconditions: (i) civil works contract will not be awarded until a comprehensive feasibility study \ntogether with the appraisal report is submitted to ADB showing that relevant works meet ADB\u2019s \nand  the  beneficiary\u2019s  social  and  safeguards,  technical,  economic,  financial,  and  institutional \nrequirements as set forth in the PAM; and (ii) the government will not award any civil works \ncontract  which  involves  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  until  a  report  from  the  external \nresettlement monitor has been submitted to ADB confirming that there are no resettlement issues. \nV.
