Its\nbasin spans 800,000 square kilometers (km2) and is home\nto 107 million people. The Yellow River Basin is frequently\naffected  by  floods  resulting  in  devastating  economic  and\nsocial losses. The Project will reduce flooding incidence in\nthe  most  flood-prone  part  in  the  lower  reaches  of  the\nbasin.  This  will  be  achieved  by  a  combination  of\n(i)\nnonstructural  and  structural  measures \nstrengthening  the  capacity  of  the  Government  agencies\nconcerned  for  adopting  an  integrated  approach  to  the\nmanagement  of  the  Yellow  River  basin,  (ii)  introducing\nstate-of-the-art  river  embankments  and  reservoir  flood\ncontrol  systems  technology,  (iii)  reforestation  along  the\nriver  embankments,  and  (iv)  raising  the  village  platform\nabove flood levels at the most vulnerable sites.\n\nincluding \n\nCategory B\nAn initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken\nfor core subprojects and a summary IEE was circulated to\nthe Board on 2 February 2001. The IEE concludes that the\nnegative  environmental  impacts  arising  from  construction\nand  operation  of  project  facilities  can  be  mitigated  to\nacceptable  levels  through  implementation  of  appropriate\nmeasures adopted in the project design.\n\nFrequent  flooding  is  a  major  constraint  to  socioeconomic\ndevelopment  in  the  Yellow  River  basin,  particularly  the\nlower  reaches.  Past  measures  to  contain  floods,  which\nemphasized  structural  approaches,  had  limited  success.\nInternational  experience  suggests  that  floods  are  most\neffectively  addressed  through  an  optimal  combination  of\nfollowing  an\nstructural  and  nonstructural  measures, \napproach to comprehensive basin management. This is in\nline  with  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  water  policy\ntechnical  assistance  TA  2817-PRC:\npaper  and \nStrategic  Options \nfor  Water  Resources  Management\napproved  in  June  1997,  which  emphasized  the  need  to\nshift from flood control to flood management.\n\nthe \n\nThe  emphasis  on  flood  management  by  PRC  authorities\nhas  been  heightened  by  the  devastating  floods  in  1998,\nwhich  affected  7.33  million  houses,  caused  3,656  deaths,\naffected  25  million  hectares  of  farmlands,  and  resulted  in\nmonetary  losses  estimated  at  Y248.4  billion  ($30  billion\nequivalent).  The  approach  to  flood  management  includes\n\n\fObjective and Scope\n\nCost Estimates and\nFinancing Plan\n\niii\n\n(about  $3.3  billion  equivalent) \n\nlimiting  development  in  flood  retention  areas,  conserving\nnatural lakes, strengthening vulnerable embankments, and\nimproving  flood  forecasting  and  early  warning  systems.  A\nY27.6  billion \nflood\nmanagement  plan  incorporating  those  approaches  for  the\nlower  reaches  of  the  Yellow  River  has  been  prepared  by\nthe Government for implementation during 2001-2005. The\nproposed Project forms part of the Government\u2019s plan and\nis aimed at preventing human catastrophes and economic\nlosses caused by floods in the basin. ADB has played an\nimportant  role  in  promoting  the  comprehensive  basin\nmanagement  approach  adopted  in  the  plan,  and  its\ncontinued  involvement  in  implementing  the  plan  will  help\ninstitutionalize  the  approach  in  the  management  of  the\nYellow River and other basins in the PRC.\n\nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  reduce  the  incidence  of\nand damage from flooding in the lower Yellow River basin\nthrough  improved  flood  management.  The  Project  scope\ninstitutional  development  and  capacity\ncomprises  (i) \nbuilding  of  the  Yellow  River  Conservancy  Commission\n(YRCC), (ii) rehabilitating and upgrading existing structural\nand  nonstructural  measures \n(iii)\ndeveloping \nfor  vulnerable\nvillages  at  selected  sites,  and  (iv)  supporting  project\nmanagement.\n\nflood  protection  measures \n\nflood  control, \n\nfor \n\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $404.7 million\nequivalent,  consisting  of  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of\n$150.27  million  and  a  local  currency  cost  of  $254.43\nmillion  equivalent.  The  Government  has  requested  for  a\nloan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources\nfor  the  Project.  The  Government  of  Denmark  has  agreed\nto  provide  $300,000  as  an  untied  grant  from  the  Danish\nCooperation  Fund  for  Technical  Assistance  for  the  flood\nforecasting  and  early  warning  system,  to  be  administered\nby ADB.\n\n($ million)\n\nSource\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nAsian Development Bank\nDanish Government\nCentral Government\nLocal Government\n   and Beneficiaries\n       Total\nPercentage\n\n150.00\n    0.27\n    0.00\n\n    0.00\n150.27\n37\n\n    0.00\n    0.03\n224.30\n\n  30.10\n254.43\n63\n\n150.00\n    0.30\n224.30\n\n  30.10\n404.70\n100\n\nLoan Amount and Terms\n\nA  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital\nresources  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based\nlending  facility.

For  centuries,\npeople who lived along the Yellow River had suffered from periodic floods. The last 3,500 years\nsaw 26 significant changes in the lower Yellow River\u2019s course. The river settled into its present\nchannel in 1855. All major dynasties made tremendous efforts to control floods along the Yellow\nRiver.  However,  constructing  flood  control  facilities  was  formidable  work  because  the  river  is\nsuspended  at  the  lower  reaches  due  to  the  heavy  sediment  load  from  upstream.  Because\nflooding  and  drought  throughout  history,  and  the  consequent  impact  on  poverty,  in  the  Yellow\nRiver basin have been frequent and serious, particularly in the lower reaches, the river became\nknown as the \"sorrow of the PRC.\"\n\n3.\nIn August 1999, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a TA to prepare a Yellow\nRiver  Flood  Management  Sector  Project.1  The  TA  assisted  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources\n(MWR) to prepare the feasibility study for a flood management project in the lower reaches of\nthe Yellow River. The consultant\u2019s draft final report was submitted in September 2000. A Loan\nAppraisal Mission2 was fielded in December 2000 to discuss the project, objective, scope, cost,\nand project implementation arrangements. This report is based on the results of the TA reports,\nGovernment  feasibility  studies,  findings  of  ADB  missions,  and  discussions  with  central,\nprovincial  and  local  government  officials,  and  beneficiaries.  The  linkages  between  the  goals,\nobjectives, outputs, and inputs are shown in the project framework in Appendix 1.\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1. \n\nFloods\n\n4.\nPopulation  and  economic  activity  in  the  PRC  have  increasingly  moved  onto  the\nfloodplains of major rivers. Despite massive investments in flood control and other works, flood\ndamage  has  increased  with  every  major  flood  as  evidenced  during  the  floods  of  1998.  At  the\nsame  time,  the  combined  demands  for  water  for  municipal  supply,  irrigation,  industry,  power,\nand other uses exceed the available resources, and shortages of water for municipal supply and\nirrigation are emerging as major problems, especially in northern PRC.\n\n                                                \n1  TA 3259-PRC: Yellow River Flood Management Sector Project, for $930,000, approved on 22 September 1999.\n2 The  Mission  comprised  T.  Miyazato,  Senior  Project  Engineer  and  Mission  Leader;  E.  Brotoisworo,  Senior\nEnvironment  Specialist;  S.T.  Chew,  Senior  Poverty  Specialist;  E.  Gozali,  Project  Economist;  M.  Nagata,  Senior\nProgram  Officer;  S.  Price,  Senior  Social  Development  Specialist;  V.  You,  Counsel;  and  Wu  Guobao,  Poverty\nSpecialist/Staff Consultant.\n\n\f2\n\nThe PRC is afflicted with frequent floods. Its territory extends across upper, middle, and\n5.\nlower  latitudes,  and  owing  to  the  influence  of  the  monsoons,  the  country  typically  has  humid\nsummers and dry winters. The rainfall on land averages 648 millimeters (mm) a year, which is\nunevenly  distributed  over  different  regions  and  seasons.  The  average  annual  rainfall  is  over\n1,600  mm  in  the  southeast  coastal  region,  gradually  decreasing  to  less  than  200  mm  in  the\nnorthwest.  Generally,  over  half  of  the  yearly  precipitation  occurs  during  the  flood  season\nbetween July and September. The concentration of rainfall in time and space causes disastrous\nfloods. The typhoons that occur over the northwestern Pacific also bring calamitous floods. Over\na  period  of  38  years  (1949-1987),  281  of  1,114  typhoons  that  occurred  over  the  ocean\n(including the South China Sea) struck the PRC, bringing exceptionally heavy rains and causing\nserious losses in the coastal areas.\n\nFlooding  in  the  lower  Yellow  River  basin  has  created  widespread  hardship  for  all\n6.\nresidents  of  the  floodplains,  regardless  of  their  income  status.  Aside  from  direct  tangible\nfinancial  losses,  floods  inflict  major  social  costs  due  to  deaths,  injuries,  displacement  of\nhouseholds/communities,  loss  of  personal  belongings,  and  a  general  disruption  to  education,\nlivelihood,  and  family  and  social  life.  Relocating  the  flood  victims  to  congested  evacuation\ncamps  exposes  them  to  epidemics  and  social  tension.  Women,  who  form  a  significant  but\nunderestimated  percentage  of  the  rural  labor  force,  are  typically  burdened  during  flood  events\nby  obligations  to  obtain  drinking  water,  fuel,  and  food;  to  help  maintain  the  health  of  family\nmembers and livestock; and to protect household properties. Flood-affected families themselves\nmust contribute labor to relief and emergency works during the floods and to the cleanup and\nrecovery  efforts  after  the  floodwater  recedes.  In  terms  of  livelihood,  flooding  in  the  river  basin\ncauses subtler yet  longer term losses to farm communities, as agricultural land suffers from a\ndecline  in  crop  and  tree  yields  due  to  waterlogging.  In  mitigating  flood  risks,  the  Project  will\nsubstantially  lessen  the  likelihood  of  these  social  losses  and  stresses  for  the  residents  of  the\nfloodplains.\n\nHistorical records show that between 206 BC and 1949 AD, more than 1,000 significant\n7.\nflood  disasters  occurred  in  the  PRC,  averaging  one  every  two  years.  Notable  recent  floods\ninclude that of (i) the Huai River in 1931, inundating 4.27 million hectares (ha) of farmland and\ncausing  75,000  deaths;  (ii)  the  middle  and  lower  reaches  of  the  Yangtze  River  in  1931,\ninundating  more  than  3.3  million  ha  of  farmland,  affecting  28.5  million  people,  and  causing\n145,000 deaths; and (iii) the Yellow River in 1933, affecting more than 3.6 million ha of farmland\nand causing 18,000 deaths. From 1949 to 1988, the affected area averaged about 7.9 million ha\nper  year  from  large  floods  that  occurred  in  1954,  1956,  1963,  1964,  and  1985.  Although  the\nnumber of deaths has declined, the costs of damage have increased.\n\n8.\nThe most recent flood events occurred in 1996 and 1998. The 1996 flood affected some\n5.12  million  houses,  caused  4,400  deaths,  impacted  31  million  ha  farmland,  resulted  in\nmonetary losses of Y220.8 billion ($26.7 billion), and reduced gross domestic product (GDP) by\nabout 4 percent. The estimates for 1998 were 7.33 million houses, 3,656 deaths, 25 million ha\nfarmland,  Y248.4  billion  ($30  billion),  and  3-4  percent  reduction  in  GDP.  These  are  only\nestimates, but clearly the impacts have enormous implications for economic growth and human\nwelfare.\n\n2. \n\nYellow River Basin\n\nThe Yellow River is the second largest river system in the PRC, covering nine provinces\n9.\nand autonomous regions: Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi,\nHenan, and Shandong. The river rises in the northern foothills of the Bayankala Mountains on\n\n\f3\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nthe  Qinghai  Plateau  at  an  elevation  of  4,600  meters  (m).  The  total  drainage  area  is  795,000\nsquare kilometers (km2) and has a population of 107 million.  The main river is 5,464 kilometers\n(km) long (Map 1).\n\n10.\n\nThe basin is divided into three reaches, each with distinctive characteristics:\n\nThe upper reach on the Qinghai Plateau in the west of the basin at an elevation\nof over 4,000 meters above sea level (masl) is the main source of runoff in the\nbasin; there are many hydropower schemes in this area.\nThe middle reach joins the Hai River basin to the east with Mount Taihang as the\neastern  boundary,  at  an  elevation  of  1,000-2,000  masl;  the  river  flows  through\nnarrow gorges, and the two largest dams, Sanmenxia and Xiaolangdi, are in the\ndownstream part of this area.\nThe  lower  reach  downstream  to  the  coast  has  a  general  elevation  of  less  than\n100  masl,  and  is  bounded  by  the  hilly  area  of  central  Shandong  at  400-1,000\nmasl; the river is suspended above the hinterland level throughout.  The estuary\narea lies below 10 m, and the river discharges into the Bohai Sea.\n\n11.\nAmong  the  major  river  systems  in  the  PRC,  the  Yellow  River  is  the  most  complex  in\nhydrology,  hydraulics,  ecology,  and  human  intervention.  The  following  are  the  principal\ncharacteristics of the basin:\n\nFragile  ecological  environment.  The  middle  reach  flows  through  the  world's\nlargest loess plateau, with an area of 640,000 km2. Most of the area is arid and\nsemiarid. Drought, wind-blown sand, and soil loss are severe.3\nDeficient in water and abundant in sediment. The annual average runoff for the\nYellow River is 58 billion cubic meters (m3), only one seventh that of the Mekong\nRiver  with  a  comparable  catchment  area.  The  annual  average  sediment  load  is\n1.6 billion tons (t), making the Yellow River the most sediment-laden river in the\nworld.\nSuspended river. The lower Yellow River has formed a suspended river with the\nriverbed generally 4-6 m higher than the adjacent ground. This is due to severe\nsoil  loss  in  the  middle  reach  and  aggradation  year  by  year  within  the  confining\nflood embankments. The potential damage to settlements and agricultural land in\nthe event of embankment failure is high, as the surrounding terrain is a flat plain.\nRadical  course  changes.  Avulsions4  have  taken  place  throughout  geological\ntimes. In the past four millennia, the river has entered the Yellow Sea at points up\nto 800 km away from the present river mouth. The last major avulsion took place\nin the 1850s.\n\n(v)  Wider  section  upstream  than  downstream,  with  a  correspondingly  higher\nconveyance capacity upstream. For example, the river width is around 10 km in\nHenan Province and 2-4 km in Shandong.\n\n                                                \n3 Loess  is  yellowish  brown  loamy  soil,  usually  unstratified  and  prone  to  rain  and  wind  erosion.  ADB  has  helped  to\naddress difficult soils under TA 1573-PRC: Red Soils Development in Hunan Province, for $789,000, approved on\n3  October  1991;  TA  1615-PRC:  Monitoring and Management of Fragile Ecosystems in Shanxi-Shaanxi-Inner\nMongolia,  for  $600,000,  approved  on  27  November  1991;  TA  2042-PRC: West Henan Agricultural Development\nProject, for $600,000, approved on 29 December 1993; TA 2073-PRC: Changjiang Soil and Water Conservation\nand Environmental Protection,  for  $600,000,  approved  on  24  March  1994;  TA  2119-PRC:  Forest Ecosystem\nPlanning  and  Agro-industrial  Pollution  Control,  for  $600,000,  approved  on  30  June  1994;  TA  2156-PRC:\nImprovement of Grassland Ecosystem in North China,  for  $746,000,  approved  on  16  September  1994;  and  TA\n2407-PRC: Capacity Building for Soil and Water Conservation, for $590,000, approved on 28 September 1995.\n\n4  Sudden complete change in the course of a river, usually occurring during a flood.\n\n\f4\n\nThe lower reach of the Yellow River runs through two provinces, Henan (upstream) and\n12.\nShandong (coastal area) in the central part of the Northern Plain, before flowing into the Bohai\nSea.    The  total  population  of  the  two  provinces  is  about  183  million:  94  million  in  Henan,  the\nmost populous among PRC\u2019s provinces and autonomous regions, and 89 million in Shandong,\nwhich is highly industrialized. The total product of primary industry accounts for only 16 percent\nof the gross provincial product in Shandong, compared with about 25 percent in Henan. Henan\nis  a  major  producer  of  wheat,  corn,  and  cotton,  mostly  grown  with  irrigation.  More  than  80\npercent of the population in Henan lives in the rural area.\n\n13.\nHenan is a relatively poor interior province. In 1999, its per capita annual rural income\nwas  Y1,948  ($235),  88  percent  of  the  national  rural  average  of  Y2,210  ($266).  Shandong  is\nlocated  in  the  developed  coastal  zone  and  average  annual  per  capita  income  in  its  rural  area\nwas Y2,550 ($307) in 1999, 31 percent higher than that in Henan. Among PRC\u2019s 31 provinces\nand autonomous regions, Henan ranked 19th in rural income, and Shandong 8th.\n\n14.\nOf the 113 counties in the flood-prone areas, 43 in Henan and Shandong are especially\nvulnerable to inundation since they are located along the Yellow River and its lower tributaries.\nThe  counties  at  highest  risk  are  densely  populated,  with  661  persons  per  km2  and  a  total\npopulation  of  32.8  million.  The  rural  population  in  the  flood-prone  area  is  estimated  at  28.8\nmillion (87 percent of total), of which 10.7 million form part of the labor force. Available arable\nland is limited at about 0.09 ha per person. The 43 counties include the inner floodplains (i.e.,\nareas inside the main river embankments) that are home to 1.7 million residents living in 2,193\nvillages.\n\nThe river reach downstream of the Dongping flood retention basin, about 400 km from\n15.\nthe  estuary,  located  in  Shandong  has  a  smaller  cross  section  with  only  about  half  the\nconveyance capacity of the channel upstream. This suggests that Dongping Lake has long been\na  natural  storage  area  for  floods.  The  lake  and  an  additional  storage  area  to  the  south  are\nencircled with high embankments, providing an effective flood storage capacity. The basin can\nbe flooded from the Yellow River via inlet flood sluices; drainage is partly to the Yellow River,\nand partly to the Huai River to the south, once the flood recedes. The Dongping flood retention\nbasin would be flooded in the event of a flood with a return period of around once in 25 years.\nThe storage capacity allows the river downstream to match the upstream reach.\n\n16.\nThe  loess  plateau  in  the  upper  and  middle  reaches  of  the  Yellow  River  is  the  most\nseverely eroded area in the world.  The total eroded area is 454,000 km2: 337,000 km2 eroded\nby  water  and  117,000  km2  by  wind.  The  heavily  water-eroded  area  with  an  erosion  modulus\ngreater than 5,000 t per km2 per year covers 146,500 km2, nearly 40 percent of the total area of\nthat  category  in  the  PRC.    The  36,700  km2  of  severely  water-eroded  area  with  an  erosion\nmodulus  greater  than  15,000  t  per  km2  per  year  accounts  for  90  percent  of  the  total  in  this\ncategory  in  the  PRC.  The  high  sediment  load  of  the  Yellow  River  originates  mainly  from  the\nhighly erosive areas of the loess plateau, i.e., from Hekouzhen to Longmen and the middle and\nupper reaches of the Jing, Luo, and Wei rivers.\n\nMeasures to control sediment involve major engineering works, most notably Xiaolangdi\n17.\nreservoir (funded by the World Bank), which is designed to trap and contain riverborne sediment\nfor about 20 years in the dead storage of the reservoir.5 Long-term measures include terracing,\ncheckdams,  reforestation,  planting  of  grasses,  and  promotion  of  horticulture  in  the  eroding\n\n                                                \n5 Dead storage is the part of a reservoir from which water cannot be released from the lowest outlet.\n\n\f5\n\nareas.  The  Government  plans  to  rehabilitate  157,300  km\u00b2  by  2010  (one  third  of  the  loess\nplateau), and to completely rehabilitate all affected areas by 2050.\n\n18.\nBuilding  up  farmland  by  terracing  and  utilizing  land  behind  silt  trap  dams  will  increase\nagricultural  output  and  allow  the  restoration  of  forest  and  grass  on  formerly  cultivated  sloping\nland.  Vegetation  cover  may  be  improved  or  restored  by  introducing  suitable  species  of  trees,\ngrasses, and bushes in appropriate combinations.  The development of grass and forest areas\nconserves  soil  and  water,  and  promotes  the  development  of  animal  husbandry,  forestry,  and\norchards. Conservation farming to retain moisture and soil includes fallow fields, limited tillage,\ncultivating along contours, and contour furrow-and-ridge planting.\n\n19. Water consumption in the Northern Plain has been increasing at the rate of 4.7 percent\nannually. The average annual flow in the Yellow River is 58 billion m3. About 38 billion m3, or 65\npercent,  is  diverted  for  irrigation;  6.4  billion  m3,  or  11  percent,  is  used  by  industries  and  cities\nwithin the watershed; and 4.1 billion m3, or 7 percent, is diverted to cities outside the watershed\n(e.g.,  Zhengzhou  City).  In  1970,  the  Yellow  River  ran  dry  in  stretches  along  Shandong  for  21\ndays.  In  1996,  the  dry  period  was  133  days  and  in  1997,  it  was  226  days.6  Water  shortages\nhave contributed to the disappearance of wetland habitats__especially in the lower reaches__and\naggravated  the  decline  of  aquatic  fauna  and  the  existing  water-quality  problems.  Water\nshortages may lead to future social conflict, unrest, and food insecurity. The demand for water is\ncurrently so high that farmers face strong competition for water from local cities and industries.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n1. \n\n1988 Water Law\n\n20.\nThe  Government  has  placed  high  priority  on  water  resource  management  to  minimize\nthe  impacts  of  floods  and  droughts.  The  basic  principles  of  water  resource  management  are\nstated in the current implementing guidelines for the Water Law and related laws, such as the\nLaw on Water and Soil Conservation, Water Pollution Control, Flood Control, and Environmental\nProtection.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nWater  resources  are  owned  by  the  State,  to  be  developed  and  utilized  at  its\ndiscretion. Control is to be exercised through a water rights system covering the\nconsumptive use of both groundwater and surface water.\nA  system  for  the  unified  administration  of  basinwide  water  resources  is  to  be\nadopted  in  association  with  administration  at  various  levels  and  by  various\ndepartments  throughout  the  country.  Provinces  retain  responsibility  for  systems\nwithin their own territory.\n\n(iii)  Water pollution control is to be an integral part of the development and utilization\n\nof water resources.\nService entities are to charge water fees on all consumptive uses of both surface\nwater and groundwater.\nAllocation and consumption of water must be planned and economized through\ntechnical and organizational measures, and reuse promoted.\n\n21.\nThe 1988 Water Law\u2019s structure and level of detail show flexibility and allow adjustments\nas conditions change and new management measures are devised. An extensive body of rules,\n\n                                                \n6 During  the  dry  season  in  2000,  the  Yellow  River  flow  reached  the  sea  without  interruption  due  to  strong\n\nGovernment pressure on water users in the upper and middle reaches of the river to limit use.\n\n\f6\n\nregulations,  and  specific  legislation  has  evolved  for  implementing  the  law.  Basin  plans  are  to\nunderpin all other plans to ensure an optimum combination of alternatives to meet national and\nlocal goals. Basin plans are to serve as a main component of land use plans and economic and\nenvironmental  plans, and they  are to guide the rational layout of cities and townships and the\ndistricts\u2019 infrastructure. Special plans may be formulated to guide subsectors such as irrigation,\nflood control, drainage, and soil conservation.\n\n22.\nThe 1988 Water Law provides for the principle of charging fees for the use of water in\naddition to charges for services. The fees, which vary by use and source, are to be assessed on\nall  consumptive  uses  and  certain  nonconsumptive  uses  such  as  hydropower  generation.\nCharges  for  all  services  should  cover  costs  of  infrastructure  and  expenses  to  maintain  and\ndeliver  the  service.  Regional  flood  control  is  viewed  as  a  public  responsibility  of  the\nGovernment.  However,  charges  for  flood  control  benefits  are  levied  through  land  value\nassessments and direct labor along reaches of the rivers.\n\n23.\nTo clarify the diverse responsibilities for water management, the Government is revising\nthe  1988  Water  Law,  which  does  not  adequately  address  emerging  issues.  The  revision  will\nstipulate  that  water  resources  are  to  be  administered  in  a  holistic,  unified  way,  not  by  sector.\nThe  proposed  amended  Water  Law  has  been  discussed  by  the  National  People\u2019s  Congress\n(NPC)  and  is  expected  to  be  approved  shortly.  For  effective  and  efficient  water  management,\nimplementable mechanisms for water pricing and cost recovery will be stipulated.\n\n2. \n\n1997 Flood Control Law\n\nThe  Flood  Control  Law,  which  NPC  passed  on  29  August  1997,  came  into  force  on  1\n24.\nJanuary  1998.  This  is  the  first  law  for  preventing  and  controlling  natural  disasters  (although\nthere  have  been  previous  administrative  regulations  promulgated  under  the  water  and  other\nlaws)  and  thus  filled  a  gap  in  the  water  legislation  system.  This  law  is  important  because  it\naddresses  the  specific  nature  of  causes  and  remedial  measures  to  be  taken  to  prevent  and\ncontrol floods. It requires a unified and integrated planning approach with comprehensive river\nbasin  plans  prepared  by  the  river  basin  commissions,  and  at  administrative  levels  of  local\ngovernment, specifically including urban areas. The law introduced the important mechanism of\ndesignating  \"planned  reserve  zones/areas,\"  where  special  rules  may  apply  on  water  use  and\nactivities. It further specifies requirements for operating reservoirs and other hydraulic works; for\nmultiple  uses  in  river  course  realignments  and  lake  embankments;  and  for  preparing  a  flood\nimpact  assessment  for  projects  in  flood-prone  areas.    MWR  is  primarily  responsible  for\nimplementing this law.\n\n3. \n\nRiver Basin Commissions\n\nAs early as November 1949, the Government stated that use of water in any river must\n25.\nbe planned in a unified manner and managed in an integrated way so that water resources can\nbe  optimally  utilized.  The  principle  of  united  water  administration  relies  on  centralized\nmanagement  to  verify  water  rights  and  appraise,  decide,  and  initiate  water  conservation\nundertakings with multiple objectives. During the 1950s, river basin plans were completed for all\nseven major river basins. The importance of basin planning and management was confirmed by\nthe 1988 Water Law.\n\nThere are currently six commissions for interprovincial river basins (Songhua-Liao, Hai,\n26.\nYellow,  Huai,  Yangtze,  and  Pearl)  and  one  lake  commission  (Tai)  under  the  direct\nadministration of MWR, but established with the consent of the State Council. The functions of\n\n\f7\n\nthe  commissions  are  delegated  to  them  by  MWR.  Many  have  been  allocated  responsibilities\nthat go beyond the particular river or lake basin concerned, so they essentially act as regional\noffices of the ministry. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission (YRCC) is authorized to act\nin some inland river basins (e.g., in Xinjiang) and the Tai Lake Commission was recently made\nresponsible for some rivers in Fujian Province. While the river basin commissions are primarily\nresponsible for the specific river or lake basins for which they are named and are widely seen to\nbe basin agencies, in practice they fall short of a true basin commission as they do not have the\nrequisite authority for implementing an integrated approach for water resource management.\n\n4. \n\nRiver Basin Plans\n\n27.\nMWR is preparing a long-term Comprehensive River Basin Plan covering a period of 20-\n30 years for each of the seven major river basins.7 MWR has also prepared flood control plans,\nirrigation plans, water and ecology conservation plans, and water resources development plans\nfor each of the seven basins.\n\nYRCC  prepared  an  Outline  Management  Plan  for  the  Yellow  River  Basin  covering  the\n28.\nperiod  2000-2020.  After  review  by  MWR,  YRCC  submitted  the  plan  to  the  State  Development\nPlanning Commission (SDPC) in 1997. The objectives of the plan are to (i) reinforce the lower\nYellow  River  embankments  to  eliminate  vulnerable  locations,  (ii)  strengthen  the  riverbank  and\ntrain  the  bed  to  control  the  shifting  of  the  main  stream,  (iii)  slow  down  the  extension  of  the\nestuary into the sea, (iv) improve the safety of the Yellow River floodplain and reduce the losses\nand impacts of floods, and (v) strengthen nonstructural measures for flood management.\n\nMWR has prepared a medium-term plan for the Yellow River called a Program for 2010.\n29.\nIn  addition,  MWR  prepared  the  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (10th  FYP)  for  the  Yellow  River (2001-\n2005) and submitted it to SDPC. For the lower reach of the Yellow River, the total investment\nunder the 10th FYP is estimated at Y27.6 billion (about $3.3 billion). The proposed Project will\ncover the implementation of the most urgent construction works of both structural measures and\nnonstructural measures included in the 10th FYP for the Yellow River.\n\n30.\nThe major flood  of 1998 in the Yangtze and Songhua rivers and drought in the Yellow\nRiver  basin  catalyzed  public  awareness  on  the  severity  of  the  degradation  of  the  natural\nvegetation and potential environmental and economic consequences. In response to the public\nconcern, the Government initiated a Natural Forest Protection Project to (i) terminate logging in\nnatural  forests  in  designated  provinces,  (ii)  convert  cultivated  sloping  land  to  forest  and\ngrassland,  (iii)  regenerate  barren  land,  and  (iv)  restructure  the  forest  industry  and  re-employ\nforest  workers  and  affected  farmers.  This  project  for  the  upper  and  middle  Yellow  River  was\nincorporated in the Great West Development Program in 2000.\n\nThe  PRC  adopted  a  number  of  measures  to  protect  and  improve  the  ecological\n31.\nenvironment in the western region. Pilot programs were launched in 188 counties for restoring\nforest  and  grassland  in  700,000  ha  of  cultivated  land  to  prevent  soil  erosion.  In  addition,\n530,000  ha  of  mountainous  areas  were  closed  for  afforestation.  All  sloping  and  ecologically\nimportant  farmland  with  serious  water  and  soil  erosion  problems  will  be  restored  as  forest  or\ngrassland in the next 5-10 years. The central Government also plans to bring under control the\nwater and soil erosion in areas totaling 20 million ha. Erosion by wind and sand storm will also\nbe controlled in areas totaling 26 million ha.\n\n                                                \n7  These rivers are Songhua, Liao, Hai-Luan, Yellow, Huai, Yangtze, and Pearl.\n\n\f8\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n1. \n\nADB\u2019s Operations in the Water Sector\n\nADB\u2019s involvement in the water sector, especially in the water supply sector, has been\n32.\nsignificant.  ADB  has  provided  14  loans  for  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  and  flood\ndamage rehabilitation totaling $1,818 million since 1992. It has financed TAs in the environment,\nwater supply, and flood control sectors totaling $36.757 million: (i) 36 advisory TAs focused on\nthe  preparation  of  policies  and  strategies,  amounting  to  $23  million;  and  (ii)  16  project\npreparatory TAs amounting to $13.75 million. A list of TAs and loans is in Appendix 2.\n\n33.\nADB has been increasingly involved in the water resource management sector including\nflood  control  since  1998.  During  implementation  of  the  TA  for  strategic  options  for  the  water\nsector,8  ADB  invited  external  agencies  that  were  involved  in  the  water  sector  in  the\nPRC__Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  Canadian  International\nDevelopment Agency (CIDA), Deutsche Gesellschaf f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (German\nAgency  for  Technical  Cooperation)  [GTZ],  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  World\nBank__to several workshops to discuss the outcome of the study together with high-ranking PRC\nofficials in charge of policy and planning in the water sector (including an expert panel of senior\nadvisers in the sector). All participants recognized the value of the outcome of the study. The TA\nidentified seven major issues: (i) lack of unified water administration and management; (ii) gap\nbetween  policy,  planning,  and  implementation;  (iii)  inadequacy  of  financial  resources;  (iv)\nescalating  flood  damage;  (v)  water  scarcity  and  inefficient  water  use;  (vi)  increasing  water\npollution; and (vii) soil erosion and ecosystem degradation. Soil and water conservation projects\nthat contribute to poverty reduction are viewed as a potential area for future investment.\n\nin \n\nADB \n\nis  currently  assisting \n\n34.\nthe  PRC-Global  Environment  Facility\nformulating \npartnership  to  support  implementation  of  a  10-year  program  to  combat  land  degradation  in\ndryland ecosystems in western PRC.9 The partnership will be guided by a country programming\nframework  that  will  describe  necessary  policy,  legislative,  and  institutional  enabling  factors;\nidentify  priority  ecoregions;  define  priority \ntheir\nsequencing; and specify a monitoring and evaluation system. ADB has also provided TA totaling\n$6.15  million  for  strengthening  the  capacities  of  agencies  responsible  for  assessing  and\nmonitoring environmental impacts and formulating environmental protection laws.\n\ninvestment  and  TA \n\ninterventions  and \n\n2. \n\nOther External Assistance\n\n35.\nRight after the 1998 flood, the Government requested ADB assistance for the Northeast\nFlood  Damage  Rehabilitation  Project.10  An  informal  understanding  with  the  Government  was\nthat ADB would handle the water sector projects in the northern part of the PRC while the World\nBank  would  attend  to  those  in  the  southern  part  since  the  World  Bank  was  involved  in  the\nYangtze dike strengthening project at that time.\n\n                                                \n8  TA 2817-PRC: Strategic Options for the Water Sector, for $1.18 million, approved on 26 June 1997.\n9  TA 3497-PRC: Global Environment Facility Partnership on Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems, for $100,000,\napproved  on  5  September  2000;  TA  3657-PRC:  PRC-GEF  Partnership  on  Land  Degradation  in  Dryland\nEcosystems, for $800,000 (funded by ADB) and $350,000 (funded by GEF), approved on 25 May 2001; and TA\n3663-PRC: Optimizing Initiatives to Combat Desertification in Gansu Province, for $610,000, funded by the Japan\nSpecial Fund, approved on 5 June 2001.\n\n10 Loans 1685/1686/1687-PRC: Northeast Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project, for $110 million each, approved on\n\n22 April 1999.\n\n\f9\n\nThe World Bank and a number of bilateral agencies11  have  supported  water  resources\n36.\ndevelopment  and  flood  control  in  the  PRC.  The  World  Bank  has  been  involved  in  water\nresources  projects  in  major  river  basins,  particularly  the  Yangtze  River  (Tai  Lake  Basin  Flood\nControl, Yangtze River Water Resources Development Plan, and Yangtze Dike Strengthening)\nand the Yellow River (Xiaolangdi Multipurpose I and II,12 Xiaolangdi Resettlement,13 and Loess\nPlateau  Watershed  Rehabilitation14).  The  World  Bank,  in  assisting  such  large-scale  projects,\nmixed its ordinary loans and concessional International Development Association\u2019s credits. The\nmain  policy  and  sector  issues  addressed  in  its  flood  protection  projects  are  (i)  rational  and\nstandardized  approach  for  improving  flood  control  infrastructure  facilities,  and  (ii)  financial  and\nphysical sustainability of flood protection facilities.\n\n37.\nThe Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) has financed several multipurpose\ndam projects, most of which have flood protection as one of the objectives. With the introduction\nof  more  concessional  terms  and  conditions15  for  projects  aimed  at  global  environment\nimprovement  and  pollution  control  in  1997,  JBIC  has  been  more  actively  involved  in  flood\ncontrol projects including an afforestation project in the upper reach of the Yellow River basin.\nThe  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  has  been  funding  grant  projects  related  to  water\nresources and the flood protection sector, such as human resources development, afforestation,\nand soil stabilization in the loess plateau.\n\n  AusAID  approved  the  Yangtze  River  Flood  Control  and  Management  Project  in\n38.\nFebruary 2001 to improve the capacity of the Yangtze Water Resources Commission (YWRC)\nto  deliver  timely  and  accurate  flood  forecasts.  AusAID  and  ADB  plan  to  jointly  sponsor  a\nworkshop for YRCC and YWRC on nonstructural work and to share the initial findings of each\nproject. CIDA has been providing grant assistance to control soil erosion in the middle reach of\nthe Yellow River. CIDA is also currently considering assistance for strategic flood management\nand flood control management systems.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n39.\nInternational experience suggests that floods are most effectively addressed through an\noptimal combination of structural and nonstructural measures. In the past, the PRC had tended\nto stress structural approaches, but now it increasingly recognizes the need to move toward a\nmore  comprehensive  approach  by  conducting  a  broad-ranging  review  of  flood-related  policies\nand practices. This trend accelerated after the devastating 1998 floods. Flood control is being\nconsidered as integral to soil and water conservation. Other aspects will include flood-proofing\nand  limiting  development  in  flood  retention  areas,  conserving  natural  lakes,  and  strengthening\nvulnerable embankments.\n\n40.\nThe  importance  of  sound  watershed  management  was  pointed  out  in  a  number  of\nproject  performance  audit  reports  (PPARs).  Many  communities  have  experienced  increasing\nand  severe  flooding  after  storms  or  prolonged  rains  partly  due  to  the  effects  of  denudation  of\n                                                \n11 These include the Japan Bank for International Cooperation/Japan International Cooperation Agency (JBIC/JICA),\nAustralian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  Canadian  International  Development  Agency  (CIDA),\nand Danish International Development Assistance (Danida).\n\n12  Project  ID:  P003562  and  P034081.  Total  project  cost  amounted  to  $2,855.8  million,  of  which  $890  million  was\n\nfinanced by the World Bank.\n\n13 Project ID: P003644, Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project, for $110 million, approved on 14 April 1994.\n14  Project  ID:  P056215, Second Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation Project,  for  $150  million,  approved  on  25\nMay 1999; and Project ID: P003540, Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation Project, for $150 million, approved\non 26 May 1994.\n\n15 Interest rate of 0.75 percent per annum, with repayment of 40 years including a grace period of 10 years.\n\n\f10\n\nforested  uplands  and  watersheds.  Similarly,  the  sector  synthesis  of  postevaluation  findings  in\nthe  irrigation  and  rural  development  sector  pointed  out  how  lack  of  proper  watershed\nmanagement endangers irrigation and rural development projects.16 Postevaluation experience\nin \nflood  control  sector  also  recommends  strengthening  of  integrated  river  basin\nmanagement.  In  designing  river  basin  development  projects,  an  integrated  and  coordinated\napproach  involving  upper  watershed  management  and  conservation,  and  downstream  rural\ndevelopment must be simultaneously and effectively carried out.\n\nthe \n\nADB\u2019s experience with rehabilitation assistance after a disaster was reviewed in 1998 to\n41.\nidentify  lessons  learned  and  emerging  issues  that  are  also  useful  to  the  flood  control  sector\nprojects. Although the projects reviewed were generally rated as successful, their achievements\nin  terms  of  rapid  restoration  of  facilities  to  ensure  continuity  of  productive  and  social  life  were\nsometimes  below  expectations.  Considerable  delays  occurred  in  implementation  due  to  (i)\ndelayed  compliance  with  the  conditions  for  loan  effectiveness,  (ii)  institutional  weaknesses  in\nimplementing agencies, (iii) slower-than-expected procurement of consulting services and other\nproject  inputs,  (iv)  low  level  of  understanding  of  ADB\u2019s  procedures  for  disbursement  of  funds,\nand (v) unclear or complicated subproject selection criteria and approval procedures.\n\n42.\nThe design of this Project reflects these lessons. An associated TA on strategic planning\nstudy for preparing the Yellow River law will assist the Government in setting out principles and\nprocedures  for  integrated  river  basin  management,  including  watershed  management,  in  the\nYellow River. The Project gives particular attention to subproject selection criteria and approval\nprocedures. YRCC is fully aware of the selection criteria of the subprojects, which were agreed\nupon  with  ADB  and  stipulated  in  the  loan  agreement.  There  is  little  risk  of  delayed  project\nimplementation  since  YRCC  has  strong  project  preparation  and  implementation  capabilities.\nYRCC has a good performance record in implementing several World Bank projects (footnotes\n12-14). However, it has no experience in implementing projects under ADB-financed loans, and\nis \ninitial  environmental\nexamination/environmental impact assessment (IEE/EIA) for each subproject; (ii) preparation of\nresettlement  plans  for  subprojects  if  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  are  required;  and  (iii)\npreparation of  tender documents, evaluation reports, and disbursement documents. To further\nassist  YRCC,  the  Project  will  give  staff  in  the  project  management  office  (PMO)  of  YRCC  on-\nthe-job-training in preparing these documents. International and domestic consultants who are\nfamiliar with ADB procedures will be recruited under the Project.\n\nfamiliar  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements \n\nfor  (i)  preparation  of \n\nless \n\nE. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n43.\nADB\u2019s  strategic  objectives  for  the  PRC  are  to  (i)  improve  economic  efficiency,  (ii)\npromote  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty  in  the  inland  provinces,  and  (iii)  enhance\nenvironmental  protection  and  natural  resources  management.  ADB\u2019s  strategic  actions  in  the\nenvironment include (i) building institutional capacity; (ii) improving the policy, legal, regulatory,\nand  management  systems;  (iii)  promoting  cleaner  technologies;  (iv)  supporting  the  use  of\neconomic  measures,  supply-side  measures,  and  other  measures  to  protect  and  ensure\nsustainable use of natural resources; and (v) promoting environmentally sustainable agricultural\nand natural resource management practices. The Project will address both ADB\u2019s strategic and\nenvironmental objectives in the water sector.\n\n                                                \n16 Sector Synthesis of Postevaluation Findings in the Irrigation and Rural Development, May 1995.\n\n\f11\n\nIn line with ADB\u2019s water policy,17 the Project focuses on the need for an integrated water\n44.\nresources management approach. The policy emphasizes that water is a socially vital economic\ngood that needs careful management to sustain equitable economic growth and reduce poverty.\nConserving  and  protecting  water  resources  through  a  participatory  approach  and  following\nprinciples of integrated water resources management are at the heart of the policy.\n\n45.\nSector capacities require strengthening in a variety of ways. The policy environment, the\nsector  institutions,  and  the  development  of  human  resources  working  in  the  sector__all  need\nupgrading.  The  public,  the  private  sectors,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and\ncommunity  organizations  active  in  the  sector  need  help  with  institutional  development  and\nanalysis,  water  policy  formulation,  legislation,  water  resource  planning,  real-time  management\nof  basin  operations,  data  management  and  interpretation,  simulation  modeling  and  other\nanalytical techniques, socioeconomic analysis and skills, community skills, and monitoring and\nevaluation  (M&E).  ADB  will  help  determine  priorities  in  capacity  building  and  selectively  assist\nits partners through a process of monitoring, training, research, and feedback. Good practices\nwill  be  combined  and  agencies  encouraged  to  adopt  systems  of  incentives  that  create  the\ndemand for improved capacity.\n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n1. \n\nComprehensive Basin Management\n\n46.\nEffective water policy planning and implementation involve many institutions. The Project\nwill  focus  on  developing  effective  cross-sector  coordination  mechanisms.  During  project\nprocessing,  the  need  to  strengthen  the  legal  framework  governing  the  Yellow  River  was\nstressed.  It  was  agreed  that  ADB  would  support  the  review  and  revision  of  water  legislation,\nparticularly  in  the  areas  of  water  rights  and  allocation  among  competing  uses,  water  quality\nstandards,  groundwater  use,  demand  management,  resource  conservation,  private  sector\nparticipation, and institutional responsibilities for water sector functions at national, regional, or\nbasin, local, and community levels.\n\n47.\nADB helped to promote the holistic approach to water resources management under the\nTA  for  strategic  options  for  the  water  sector (footnote  8).  One  of  the  recommendations  of  the\nstudy  was  to  establish  a  national  water  resources  coordinating  committee  to  direct  and\nsupervise new initiatives in the water sector, including comprehensive basin management. The\nGovernment  intends  to  establish  a  water  resource  management  committee,  which  was\nendorsed during an NPC conference in March 2001.\n\n48.\nRecognizing the importance of coordinating activities based on hydrological boundaries\nand  those  based  on  administrative  boundaries,  in  December  1997  and  October  1999,  NPC\nrecommended that the State Council prepare a Yellow River law for basinwide, integrated water\nresources  management  of  the  Yellow  River,  to  deal  with  issues  of  scarcity  of  water  and\novercommitment of available water resources, flood hazards, soil erosion, and serious pollution.\nConsidering the urgency, the State Council placed very high priority for the establishment of the\nYellow River law on its legislative agenda, after the amendments of the 1988 water law.\n\nAn  associated  TA__Strategic  Planning  Study  for  the  Preparation  of  the  Yellow  River\n49.\nLaw__will  help  the  Government  to  analyze  the  physical,  socioeconomic,  and  legal  issues  and\nimpediments in enacting the Yellow River law. The study will assist in resolving (i) coordination\n\n                                                \n17 R230-00: Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank, 16 January 2001.\n\n\f12\n\nof local laws and regulations, which are currently enforced only within the jurisdiction of riparian\nprovinces, townships, and villages;  (ii) conflict between water users in sectors and jurisdictions;\nand  (iii)  overlapping  responsibilities  between  riparian  local  governments  and  the  river  basin\ncommission.\n\n2. \n\nCost Recovery Mechanisms\n\nThe  PRC  policy  to  levy  a  fee  for  the  privilege  of  diverting  water__surface  water  and\n50.\nground water__for consumptive and other specified uses is separate and in addition to the policy\nto charge for all water-related services. The decision to levy the fee and its specific use is left to\nthe  province  and,  where  assessed,  is  usually  collected  by  the  county  Department  of  Water\nResources  (for  rural  users)  and  county  Department  of  Construction  (for  urban  users)  to  be\nshared  with  governments  at  other  levels.  In  many  instances,  several  agencies  seek  to  be\nallowed to collect the fees. The Water Law states that the fee may be used only for improving\nwater management.\n\n51. Water  prices  at  present  reflect  mainly  variable  costs  and  fail  to  provide  for  recovery  of\nfixed  investments.  Starting  with  new  projects,  MWR  has  recommended  raising  water  prices  to\nencourage efficiency. MWR anticipates the new pricing system will promote water conservation,\nstimulate greater private sector participation in water supply, and reduce future water shortages.\nIrrigation  water,  about  70  percent  of  total  water  use,  faces  a  threefold  price  increase,  while\nurban and industrial water prices also will rise. Low prices stifle investment in water supply and\ntreatment facilities.\n\nOver  the  last  decade,  the  Government  has  increased  the  budget  to  improve  and\n52.\nstrengthen the flood protection facilities in the major river basins, almost 15 times more in 1999\nthan in 1990. Investment for flood protection is expected to be further increased under the 10th\nFYP.  Embankments  will  be  improved  and  strengthened  for  effective  flood  protection  and\nminimal  flood  damage.  At  the  same  time,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  will  be\nincreased to ensure the financial and physical sustainability of the embankments.\n\n53.\nBecause of budgetary constraints faced by central and local governments, growing fiscal\nconcerns,18 and the large increases in flood protection investments, the Government has seen\nthe  need  to  recover  costs,  particularly  for  O&M,  from  beneficiaries  in  all  major  river  basins,\nincluding  the  Yellow  River.  In  the  other  major  basins__the  Yangtze  and  Songhua__provincial\ngovernments  have  been  levying  and  collecting  fees  for  O&M  of  the  river  infrastructure.  The\nWater  Law  (1988),  to  be  amended  shortly,  is  likely  to  stipulate  a  standard  cost-recovery\nmechanism  based  on  the  charges  to  be  collected  from  water  users  and/or  levied  on\nbeneficiaries.  Increased  tariffs  will  provide  market-based  incentives  to  conserve  and  recycle\nwater and put a scarce resource to the most productive use.\n\n54.\nThe associated TA will assist in developing appropriate mechanisms for collecting water\ncharges  to  cover  O&M  costs  of  the  flood  control  facilities.  Since  the  amended  Water  Law  will\nstipulate only the principle of the need to recover O&M costs from water users and beneficiaries,\ndeveloping  and  implementing  the  actual  mechanism  will  be  left  to  the  provincial  governments\nand  river  basin  commissions.  The  TA  will  address  this  issue  by  analyzing  best  international\npractices and will provide inputs in formulating implementation regulations under the proposed\nYellow River Law.\n\n                                                \n18 CER:PRC 2000-09: Country Economic Review, People's Republic of China, October 2000, paras. 22-26.\n\n\f13\n\n3. \n\nStrengthening  the  Legal  and  Regulatory  Framework  for  Environmental\nManagement\n\n55.\nEnvironmental  management,  including  planning  for  conservation  of  natural  resources\nand protection of water resources, is a recent concern in the PRC. To help build the necessary\ncapacity to strengthen the legal framework, ADB (i) helped train the staff of the Environmental\nProtection  Commission  of  NPC  and  is  assisting  in  drafting  and  revising  some  of  PRC's\nenvironmental laws,19 (ii) is helping to promote a more effective legal/regulatory framework for\nenvironmental  protection  that  is  responsive  to  PRC's  transition  to  a  market  economy  and  its\nadherence to international environmental protection agreements, (iii) is helping to draft the 1996\namendments to PRC's Water Pollution Law and Environmental Protection Law and assess the\nprovincial water pollution law in Sichuan, and (iv) is also helping to develop a legal information\nsystem  to  support  the  drafting  of  environmental  laws  by  the  Environment  Protection\nCommission  and  other  activities.  The  Environmental  Protection  Law  will  strengthen\nenvironmental protection in the PRC through improved administrative practices, regulations, and\nprovision of future legislation.\n\n56.\nA  key  area  in  ADB's  policy  agenda  in  the  PRC  is  addressing  the  problem  of  trans-\nboundary  pollution.20  ADB  is  helping  to  strengthen  institutions  and  address  transjurisdictional\nenvironmental  management  issues,  with  emphasis  on  pollution  in  the  Yellow  River.  The\nexperience  and  output  of  the  Yellow  River  case  study  will  be  used  to  strengthen  the\ntransjurisdictional  environmental  management  system  in  the  six  other  major  river  systems  as\nwell as minor river systems affecting two or more provinces.\n\n4. \n\nLivelihood Restoration After Resettlement\n\n57.\nFor the sector loan subprojects, a suitable policy and legal framework is required for land\nacquisition and resettlement, as necessary, to ensure that affected people will reach or surpass\ntheir  previous  living  standards  as  early  as  possible.  The  1998  Land  Administration  Law21\nspecifies that regulations for large or medium-size water conservation and hydroelectric projects\nwill  be  prescribed  separately  by  the  State  Council.    MWR  is  currently  revising  the  1991\nRegulations  for  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  for  Large  and  Medium  Water  and\nHydropower  Project  Construction  to  enhance  planning,  income  restoration,  monitoring,\nsupervision,  and  redress  of  grievance  among  project  sponsors,  and  the  state  and  local\ngovernments.22  The  revised  regulations  also  take  account  of  higher  compensation  standards\nintroduced under the 1998 Land Administration Law, and enhanced provisions under that Law\nfor  planning,  consultation,  and  supervision.    Pending  approval  of  the  new  MWR  Regulations,\n\n                                                \n19 TA 2090-PRC: Legislative Planning and Procedures for the Protection of the Environment, for $393,000, approved\non 26 April 1994; TA 2735-PRC: Capacity Building for Natural Resources Legislation, for $800,000, approved on\n24 December 1996; and TA 3123-PRC: Provincial Legislation on Environmental Protection and Natural Resources,\nfor $300,000, financed by the Norway Government Fund, approved on 15 December 1998.\n\n20 TA 3588-PRC: Transjurisdiction Environment Management (TA cluster), for $2,100,000, approved on 11 December\n\n2000.\n\n21  ADB  provided  assistance  to  redraft  the  Land  Administration  Law,  which  strengthened  the  legal  framework  for\nresettlement  compensation  under  TA  2735-PRC:  Capacity  Building  for  Natural  Resources  Legislation,  for\n$800,000, approved on 24 December 1996.\n\n22  ADB  staff  have  participated  in  the  ongoing  consultations  on  the  revised  MWR  regulations,  for  example,  at  an\ninternational  workshop  requested  by  MWR  on  Reservoir  Resettlement:  Policy  and  Practice  at  the  World  Bank  in\nWashington  D.C.  in  April  2000.    The  new  draft  regulations  consider  the  resettlement  needs  of  resource  poor\nfarmers  affected,  and  may  include  measures  to  speed  up  the  process  of  income  restoration  following  land\nacquisition,  to  raise  compensation  standards,  and  to  share  in  the  benefits  of  project-generated  revenue  streams\nsuch as power generation.\n\n\f14\n\nSDPC has confirmed that the compensation rates set forth in the 1998 Land Administration Law\nwill apply to all project-related land acquisition and resettlement. In addition, due to the specific\nconditions  in  the  project  area__fragile  ecological  conditions  and  the  risk  of  both  drought  and\nflooding,  especially  in  the  inner  floodplain__particular  attention  will  be  given  to  developing\nlivelihood replacement programs as part of resettlement planning and management.\n\n58.\nSite  surveys  and  stakeholder  consultations  confirm  that  timely  income  restoration\nfollowing  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  poses  a  significant  challenge  in  river  basin\ninfrastructure projects. Scope exists for intra- and inter-agency dialogue to support the revised\nregulations  by  strengthening  the  application  of  appropriate  legislation  and  compensation\nstandards,  and  by  developing  participatory  planning  processes,  appropriate  production\ntechniques  and  training,  poverty  reduction  support  mechanisms,  and  accessible  credit  lines.\nThe  Project  will  support  specialized  research  and  its  presentation  through  an  annual  meeting,\nfield  visits,  and  associated  publications.  Domestic  and  international  consultants  will  work  with\nthe  Environment  and  Social  Division  (ESD)  established  in  the  PMO  in  YRCC  to  develop  and\ndocument initial subproject livelihood restoration activities for presentation in the annual forum.\nThe findings of these research activities will provide relevant case study material to guide policy\napplication to river-based resettlement throughout the PRC.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n59.\nFrequent  flooding  causes  poverty  and  human  suffering  and  is  a  major  constraint  to\nsocioeconomic  development in  the Yellow River basin. The lower reaches of the Yellow River\nare the worst affected. Although floods have been contained within certain limits, effective flood\nmanagement  and  soil  erosion  control  have  not  been  achieved.  Because  of  increasing\npopulation  and  corresponding  economic  activities  in  flood-prone  areas,  the  economic  damage\ncaused  by  flooding  is  increasing.  There  is  a  need  to  shift  from  flood  control  to  flood\nmanagement  through  an  integrated  land  and  water  resources  management  approach  that\nincludes  soil  conservation  in  the  upper  catchment,  optimal  water  management  throughout  the\nbasin, flood control measures, and complementary flood forecasting and warning systems in the\nlower reaches.\n\n60.\nThe embankments and river training works at several vulnerable points along the Yellow\nRiver  need  major  repair  and  maintenance.  The  embankments  around  flood  retention  basins\nneed strengthening to reduce the risk of failure. Establishing a morphological prediction system\nalong the lower reach including the estuary will allow sustainable flood management. To give a\nhigher  level  of  security  to  vulnerable  people,  old  infrastructure  (roads,  bridges,  platforms,\ntemporary shelters, etc.) must be upgraded and new ones constructed on the floodplain and in\nretention basins.\n\n61.\nThe Government\u2019s 10th FYP for the Yellow River and MWR\u2019s Program for 2010 for the\nYellow River give the strategic direction in implementing flood management works in the basin\n(para.  29).  The  Executing  Agency,  MWR,  and  the  Implementing  Agency,  YRCC,  are  well-\nestablished  and  experienced  in  the  flood  control  sector  and  have  the  necessary  capability  to\nimplement the proposed Project. Many relatively small-scale subprojects are dispersed over 800\nkm and will be developed in stages. ADB\u2019s sector loan modality is appropriate for a project that\ncomprises a few core subprojects and about 30 subprojects to be identified and appraised in the\ncourse  of  implementation.  The  sector  loan  approach  will  provide  necessary  flexibility  in\n\n\f15\n\npreparing  and  implementing  subprojects  in  a  phased  manner,  consistent  with  the  local\nimplementation capacity.\n\nB. \n\nObjective and Scope\n\n62.\nThe  Project  aims  to  reduce  the  incidence  and  damage  of  flooding  in  the  lower  Yellow\nRiver  basin  through  improved  flood  management.  The  Project  will  also  help  to  enhance  the\nenvironment and protect the poor and near-poor by strengthening/improving protection against\nfloods that could push them further into poverty through the loss of crops, incomes, and assets.\n\nThe project area23 is the lower reach of the Yellow River from downstream of Xiaolangdi\n63.\nDam  to  the  Bohai  Sea,  a  distance  of  some  800  km.  It  covers  3,956  km2  where  1.731  million\npeople  live  in  2,071  villages    (Map  2).    The  area  includes  the  inner  floodplain,  the  main\nembankments and the adjacent land in the outer floodplain. This area, including parts of the Hai\nand  Huai  river  basins,  is  part  of  the  117,900  km2  in  the  Northern  Plain  vulnerable  to  flooding\nfrom the Yellow River.\n\n64. While  preparing  the  10th  FYP  for  the  Yellow  River,  YRCC  also  prepared  prefeasibility\nreports for subprojects in the project area. Considering these reports, ADB and YRCC agreed\non the priority of certain project components. As recommended in the study on strategic options\nfor  the  water  sector  (footnote  8),  the  importance  of  nonstructural  measures  for  flood\nmanagement  was  duly  recognized.  Source  control  and  watershed  management  measures  are\ncentered on holistic river basin management planning presenting an integrated approach, with\nfull  attention  to  environmental  issues.  The  following  are  the  four  project  components:  (i)  flood\nmanagement  measures,  (ii)  flood  control  works,  (iii)  village  flood  protection,  and  (iv)  project\nmanagement.\n\n1. \n\nFlood Management Measures\n\n65.\nConsidering the importance of nonstructural measures for flood control in the river basin,\nthe  Project  will  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  YRCC  to  facilitate  preparation  and\nimplementation  of  an  integrated  approach  in  managing  the  Yellow  River  basin.  The\nnonstructural measures to be developed under the Project follow:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\na  flood  forecasting  and  warning  system  for  the  lower  reach,  including  the\noperation of the four upstream reservoirs and the retention basin, and floodplain\nzoning;\noperational  analysis  of  sedimentation  and  flushing  of  the  Xiaolangdi  Dam,  and\nthe morphological development in the lower reach;\nan  asset  management  system  comprising  inventory,  condition  rating,  capacity\navailability,  priority  ranking,  and  maintenance  strategies;  and  a  programmed\nmaintenance schedule for the embankment, protection works, and platforms;\nupgraded  survey  equipment  to  provide  detailed  data  on  water  flow  and  depth,\naimed at two-dimensional river and reservoir modeling;\nphysical and mathematical modeling and field testing of various flood protection\nstructures and river training works;\n\n                                                \n23 Due to the nature of the suspended river, the project area is smaller than the benefit area. The project benefit area\ntotals 113 counties covering 117,900 km2 with an estimated population of 85 million, although topographic features\nobviously  ensure  that  not  all  areas  are  directly  or  equally  affected  by  flood  damage.  The  high-risk  flood  area\ncomprises 78 counties in Henan, Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces.\n\n\f16\n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n(ix) \n\nflood control command center in Shandong province;\ninstitutional  building  within  YRCC,  primarily  on \nmanagement;\ntraining YRCC staff to strengthen their social and environmental capability; and\nproviding equipment to flood rescue teams.\n\nintegrated \n\nriver  basin\n\n2. \n\nFlood Control Works\n\nEmbankments  of  the  lower  reach  are  essential  structures  for  containing  the  Yellow\n66.\nRiver.  The river in flood is a dangerous water body 800 km long and up to 20 km wide, held\nbehind  embankments  up  to  14  m  above  the  surrounding  land  level.  Only  the  embankments\nprevent the floodwaters from inundating vast areas of valuable land.  The body of floodwater is\npowerful and turbulent, and aggressively attacks the embankments in ways that are difficult to\npredict. Major investments have been made in enclosing the area with a high flood embankment\nand in flooding and drainage sluices. Many structural problems within the existing embankments\nhave accumulated over time: (i) non-homogeneous soil, (ii) joints between construction layers,\n(iii) lack of proper compaction, (iv) historical breaches and avulsions leaving weak foundations,\n(v) emergency repairs carried out with materials immediately available, and (vi) wild animal dens\nand burrows.\n\nFlood  control  works  will  involve  (i)  strengthening  the  existing  embankment  including\n67.\nconstructing  cutoff  walls24  in  the  embankment,  (ii)  river  training,  (iii)  strengthening  the  role  of\nretention  reservoirs,  and  (iv)  planting  trees  along  the  embankment.  About  120  km  of\nembankment will be strengthened, about 25 km of river training works will be implemented, and\nsix vulnerable spots of the embankment will be reconstructed. Considering the location, scale of\nworks,  accessibility,  and  urgency,  the  embankment  at  Kaifeng  and  Dongping  flood  retention\nbasin  were  selected  as  two  core  subprojects  representative  of  subprojects  under  this\ncomponent (Appendix 3).\n\n3. \n\nVillage Flood Protection\n\n68.\nTo  meet  normal  flood  safety  standard,  elevated  earth  platforms  within  a  few  meters  of\nthe existing villages will be constructed using compacted riverbed material. Main and secondary\nevacuation  roads  will  be  constructed  or  upgraded,  and  bridges  will  be  rehabilitated.    The\ndrainage system will be improved to minimize waterlogging in the area. Trees and grasses will\nbe planted to stabilize and protect the newly built platform slope.\n\n69.\nYRCC, in coordination with the respective local governments, will design and implement\nraising of the village platform. Intensive public consultation between the local governments and\nvillagers who will occupy the newly constructed platform will be conducted. Public infrastructure-\nrelated  activities,  such  as  water  supply  pipes,  installation  of  electricity  lines,  and  relocation  of\nschools and clinics and village offices, will be the responsibility of both the township government\nand  the  county  government  concerned,  which  will  bear  the  financial  burden  between\nthemselves. As a result of the Mission\u2019s policy dialogue, the costs of relocation and resettlement\nand for construction of new houses on the adjacent platform for the poor25 will be borne by the\nlocal  government  concerned;  these  costs  will  be  above  and  beyond  the  compensation  that  is\n\n                                                \n24 Impervious underground walls of concrete grout, meant to prevent lateral seepage.\n25 Poor  households  will  include  the  extremely  poor  households  who  are  already  identified  in  each  village.  These\n\ntypically comprise those who are handicapped, infirm, and/or elderly without children.\n\n\f17\n\ndue  the  poor  based  on  the  agreed-upon  compensation  rates  for  house  relocation.26  The  local\ngovernments have agreed to construct all public infrastructure and the houses for the extremely\npoor within two years after construction of the new platform. Considering the location, scale of\nworks, accessibility, and urgent necessity, construction of the village platform in Changyuan was\nselected as a core subproject representative of this component (Appendix 3).\n\n4. \n\nProject Management\n\n  A  PMO,  consisting  of  three  divisions,27  has  already  been  established  in  YRCC  to\n70.\nimplement subprojects; liaise with local governments; prepare IEEs, resettlement plans, detailed\ndesign,  and  tender  documents;  provide  technical  support  to  the  construction  site  offices;  and\nprepare  progress  reports.  Two  project  implementation  offices,  one  in  Shandong  Province  and\nthe other in Henan Province, will be established for day-to-day supervision of construction and\nliaison with the provincial governments.\n\n71.\nThe  social  and  environmental  functions  of  the  PMO  will  be  strengthened,  particularly\nwith  respect  to  the  preparation  of  IEEs  and  resettlement  plans  for  the  subprojects.  ESD  will\nsignificantly contribute to the quality of subproject design and implementation, which will justify\nits  becoming  a  permanent  entity  within  YRCC.  The  issues  in  which  ESD  will  be  involved  will\nhelp YRCC shift from a purely engineering approach to an integrated engineering, environment,\nand social approach to flood management.\n\nC. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n72.\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $404.7  million  equivalent,  comprising  $150.27\nmillion  in  foreign  exchange  (37  percent)  and  $254.43  million  equivalent  in  local  currency\nincluding  taxes  and  duties.  The  cost  estimates  are  summarized  in  Table  1  and  detailed  in\nAppendix 4. The estimates were derived from prices and base costs as of December 2000. The\ncosts include the front-end fee and interest during construction (IDC) and commitment charges\nestimated at $24.1 million.\n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nItem\nA. Component\n\n1.

Each division is headed by a qualified chief supported by at least two subdivision heads.\n\n\fD. \n\nFinancing Plan\n\n18\n\n73.\nThe PRC has requested a loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to\nhelp finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years,\nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a\ncommitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0 percent (the fee will be\ncapitalized in the Loan), conversion options that may be exercised in accordance with the terms\nof  the  draft  Loan  Agreement,  the  Loan  Regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Conversion  Guidelines,  and\nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreements.  The\nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for PRC\u2019s decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s\nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking\nthat these choices were the PRC\u2019s own independent decision and not made in reliance on any\ncommunication or advice of ADB. In addition, the Government of Denmark has agreed to make\navailable  untied  grant  funds  amounting  to  about  $300,000  equivalent,  to  be  administered  by\nADB,  to  finance  the  costs  of  a  team  of  international  consultants  for  the  flood  forecasting  and\nwarning system.  Local currency costs are to be financed by the Government ($224.3 million),\nand  local  governments  and  beneficiaries  ($30.1  million).  Cost  sharing  among  YRCC,  local\ngovernments,  and  beneficiaries  will  be  agreed  upon  by  these  parties  before  platform\nsubprojects  are  implemented.28  The  financing  plan  is  summarized  in  Table  2  and  detailed  in\nAppendix 4.\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\n150.00\n0.27\n0.00\n\n0.00\n150.27\n\n0.00\n0.03\n224.30\n\n30.10\n254.43\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n150.00\n0.30\n224.30\n\n30.10\n404.70\n\nPercent\n\n37.1\n0.1\n55.4\n\n7.4\n100.0\n\nSource\n\nAsian Development Bank\nDanish Government\nCentral Government\nLocal Governments\n  and Beneficiaries\nTotal\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n74.\nThe  proceeds  of  ADB\u2019s  loan  will  be  channeled  to  YRCC,  through  MWR,  as  an  annual\nbudgetary  allocation.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  make  counterpart  fund  allocations  to\nMWR for the Project on a grant basis. This is the first ADB loan for which MOF has committed\nto  finance  all  the  counterpart  fund  requirements  except  for  the  village  flood  protection\ncomponent. The provincial and local governments concerned will help finance the village flood\nprotection component from their own budgetary resources. The proposed project fund flows are\ndetailed in Appendix 5.\n\nE. \n\nExecuting and Implementing Agencies\n\n75.\n  MWR  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  Project  and  YRCC  will  be  responsible  for\nimplementation.  The  village  flood  protection  component  will  be  implemented  by  YRCC  in\ncooperation with the local government agency concerned and with beneficiary participation.\n\n                                                \n28 A  written  commitment  from  the  village  and  township  governments  for  the  Changyuan  core  subproject  has  been\n\nsubmitted to YRCC. Similar arrangements will be made for all other candidate subprojects.\n\n\f19\n\nMWR  is  responsible  for  developing  and  formulating  medium-  to  long-term  policies  and\n76.\nplanning,  drafting  of  legislation;  supervising  law  enforcement,  unified  management  of  water\nresources,  comprehensive  basin  planning;  organizing  water  extraction,  permit,  and  fee\ncollection systems; flood control and drought management; and review of feasibility studies for\nlarge and medium-size water projects. MWR is linked vertically to water resource departments\nin each of the provinces, which have comparable responsibility to MWR at the provincial level.\nMWR  has  well-qualified  planning  and  engineering  staff  and  has  a  track  record  of  managing  a\nvariety  of  complex  water  sector  projects  (footnotes  12  and  13).  These  projects  have  been\ntechnically well-planned and implemented.\n\n77.\nReflecting  the  importance  of  water  resources,  the  central  Government\u2019s  annual  budget\nallocated  to  MWR  for  water  management  projects  increased  from  Y2  billion  in  1990  to  Y13\nbillion in 1997, and then to around Y30 billion level from 1998 to 2000. Because floods cause\nsevere  damage  to  people's  lives  and  the  national  economy,  almost  80  percent  of  the  total\ncentral  Government  budget  for  the  sector  has  been  allocated  to  flood  control  projects  since\n1998.\n\n78.\nYRCC was established in 1933 as one of seven interprovincial river basin commissions\nunder  the  direct  administration  of  MWR.  The  State  Council  in  1994  made  YRCC  solely\nresponsible for river management in the Yellow River basin. YRCC also assumed responsibility\nfor  the  Xinjiang  inland  river  basin  and  the  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region.  Reflecting  its\nstrong engineering capabilities, YRCC was an implementing agency in the construction of large\nreservoirs in the Yellow River basin, such as Sanmenxia dam and Xiaolangdi dam.\n\nYRCC  regulates  the  abstraction  of  water  from  the  main  stream  and  tributaries  across\n79.\nprovinces. It controls the total volume of water diverted by the provinces along the Yellow River\nin accordance with the water allocation scheme approved by the State Council. Following water\ndistribution  management  rules,  YRCC  coordinates  the  operations  of  Liujiaxia,  Wanjiazhai,\nSanmenxia,  and  Xiaolangdi  reservoirs  on  the  main  stream,  and  the  Guxian  and  Luhun\nreservoirs, and Dongping flood retention basin on the tributaries (Map 1). YRCC issues monthly\nand 10-day water distribution plans as well as water distribution for emergency allocations.\n\nYRCC  employs  30,000  people:  9,120  are  professionals  of  whom  3,580  are  engineers\n80.\nand 715 are senior engineers.  Many of the engineers were involved in constructing large dams\nsuch  as  Xiaolangdi  dam  and  Sanmenxia  dam  on  the  upper  and  middle  reaches  of  the  Yellow\nRiver.  The  Reservoir  Resettlement  Division  has  39  people  who  have  experience  in  resettling\nabout 200,000 people from the Xiaolangdi reservoir site, and trained under technical assistance\nfrom the World Bank. YRCC has an extensive network of offices in the Yellow River basin for\nO&M  of  embankment  and  flood  control  facilities.  In  the  lower  reaches  alone,  there  are  2\nprovincial  river  affairs  bureaus,  2  project  bureaus,  13  regional  or  city  river  affairs  bureaus,  52\ncounty  or  district  river  affairs  bureaus,  13  gate  management  stations,  and  4  flood  retarding\noffices.\n\n81.\nThe  local  governments,  including  the  county  and  township  project  leading  groups  and\nthe  working  groups,29  will  carry  out  some  resettlement  activities,  such  as  public  consultation,\n\n                                                \n29 Proposed  membership  of  the  county  leading  group  comprises  the  relevant  deputy  county  magistrate  and  one\nsenior staff member from the bureaus of River Management, Land Management, Agriculture, Civil Affairs/Poverty\nAlleviation, Education and Women\u2019s Federation. The township leading group members comprise local senior staff\nfrom the township government, civil affairs, women\u2019s federation, agricultural technical station, urban construction,\nand river management agencies.\n\n\f20\n\nM&E,  and  complaint  management.  The  capacity  of  local  governments  to  fulfill  these  activities\nwill be further strengthened through training and consulting inputs (paras. 90 and 96).\n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nCoordination\n\n82.\nA  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  at  the  national  level  was  established  to  coordinate\nall  key  policy  aspects  relating  to  project  implementation,  monitoring,  and  advice  to  the  PMO.\nThe PSC will be convened every six months if necessary. It will be chaired by a vice minister of\nMWR  and  comprise  representatives  from  MOF,  SDPC,  MWR,  State  Environmental  Protection\nAgency \nrelevant\n(SEPA),  Henan  and  Shandong  provincial  governments,  and  other \nministries/agencies. A secretariat of the PSC will be established within MWR.\n\n2. \n\nSelection and Preparation of Subprojects\n\nMWR,  in  coordination  with  YRCC,  will  identify  and  prioritize  subprojects  to  be\n83.\nimplemented, subject to the availability of ADB loan proceeds. Priority will be to subprojects that\n(i)  benefit  a  large  number  of  flood-vulnerable  residents,  (ii)  are  located  in  areas  with  poverty\nincidence  higher  than  the  average  for  the  project  area,  (iii)  have  no  major  negative\nenvironmental  impact,  and  (iv)  involve  no  or  minimal  land  acquisition  or  involuntary\nresettlement.  YRCC  will  prepare  the  feasibility  study  for  each  prioritized  subproject,  including\nthe  IEEs  and  resettlement  plan  as  stipulated  in  ADB\u2019s  guidelines,  and  submit  it  to  ADB  for\nreview and approval. A list of candidate subprojects is in Appendix 6.\n\n84.\n\nThe following criteria will be applied in selecting the candidate subprojects:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  the  subproject  will  not  be  less  than  12\npercent.\nThe  subproject  will  not  adversely  affect  areas  designated  as  nature  reserves,\nwetland sanctuaries, or other environmentally protected areas.\nAn  IEE/EIA  will  have  been  prepared  for  the  subproject  in  accordance  with  the\nrelevant  PRC  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines,30  and\nwill have been approved by SEPA and ADB.\nSubprojects under the village flood protection component and flood control works\nthat will require a resettlement plan will promote gender equity31 and satisfy the\ngender checklist requirements.\nFor  a  subproject  under  the  village  flood  protection  component,  the  local\ngovernment  will  have  submitted  written  confirmation  acceptable  to  ADB  that  all\nhouseholds to be moved because of the subproject are resettling voluntarily.\nFor  a  subproject  under  the  village  flood  protection  component,  the  cost  sharing\narrangements among YRCC, the local governments, and the beneficiaries will be\nset forth in  the feasibility study.  The local governments will also have provided\nassurances that they have sufficient financing for the public facilities and utilities,\npermanent and temporary acquisition of farmland, compensation for relocation of\n\n                                                \n30 The guidelines are in the Environmental Assessment Requirements of the Asian Development Bank, March 1998.\n31 ADB  recognizes  in  its  gender  and  development  policy  that  all  projects  have  a  gender  impact  and  do  not\nautomatically  benefit  men  and  women  equally.  During  the  design  phase,  the  Government  will  carry  out  gender\nanalysis to ensure all subprojects under the village flood protection component and flood control works that require\na resettlement plan provide equal opportunities for men and women to be involved and to benefit.\n\n\f21\n\ndwellings,  and  restoration  of  the  old  platform  to  farmland  or  other  agricultural\nuses.\nAny social cost will be minimized through equitable contribution of financial and\nresource provisions between governments and communities.\n\n(vii) \n\n(viii)  For  a  subproject  under  the  flood  control  works  component,  negative  effects,  if\nany,  due  to  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  will  be  identified  and\nmitigated  in  accordance  with  ADB's  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement and  the\nsector  lending  arrangements  set  forth  in  Appendix  7.  If  a  resettlement  plan  is\nrequired,  that  plan  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  PRC  laws  and\nregulations  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement,  and  will  be  subject  to\napproval by ADB.\nFor a subproject involving one or more poor areas (as designated by the national\nand  provincial/local  governments),  the  feasibility  study  will  include  a  description\nof  the  poverty  programs  in  that  county  or  counties,  the  ways  by  which  the  poor\nunder the proposed subproject will benefit from such programs, and an M&E plan\nto ensure that poverty impact analysis will be conducted in accordance with ADB\nguidelines.32\n\n(ix) \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  four  years  (Appendix  8)  beginning  in  September\n85.\n2001, with completion by end-2005. To accelerate project implementation (para. 94), YRCC has\nstarted the following preparatory activities:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nselect priority subprojects for implementation in 2001;\nprepare  feasibility  studies  plus  required  IEEs  and  resettlement  plans  for  priority\nsubprojects;\nconduct  surveys,  investigations,  and  prepare  detailed  designs,  cost  estimates,\nand tender documents; and\nprepare tender process for awarding contracts for works in 2001.\n\n4. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement\n\n86.\nA summary resettlement plan prepared for three core subprojects was circulated to the\nBoard  on  2  February  2001,  together  with  summary  IEEs  (SIEEs).  MWR  has  overall\nresponsibility for acquiring land and resettling people for the Project, working through YRCC and\nthe  provincial  governments  of  Henan  and  Shandong.  The  IEE  and  resettlement  plans  have\nbeen  disclosed  to  the  public.  The  resettlement  plan  prepared  for  each  of  the  three  core\nsubprojects, as a model consistent with ADB's guidelines, will be used as a basis for preparing\nthe  resettlement  plans  for  future  subprojects.  For  future  subprojects,  any  land  acquisition  and\nresettlement effects will be addressed, and full or short resettlement plans will be prepared as\nappropriate  to  the  magnitude  of  impact,  following  the  resettlement  policy  framework  and  the\nresettlement procedural guidelines set out under the resettlement sector lending arrangements\nin Appendix 7.\n\n87.\nResettlement  plans  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  laws  and\nregulations,  including  the  Land  Administration  Law  of  1998,  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary\nresettlement. All persons affected by land acquisition for the subprojects will be compensated in\na timely manner and resettled in accordance with the resettlement plan so that they will be at\n\n                                                \n32 ADB\u2019s Handbook on Social and Poverty Impact Analysis (draft under review in ADB).\n\n\f22\n\nleast as well off as they would have been in the absence of the subprojects. MWR/YRCC will\nengage  an  independent,  qualified  agency  acceptable  to  ADB  to  monitor  resettlement\nentitlements,  prepare  semiannual  reports  during  project  implementation,  and  evaluate  and\nreport  on  the  achievement  of  resettlement  objectives  at  project  completion  and  one  year\nthereafter.\n\n88.\nCompensation  for  land  acquisition  is  payable  to  village  committees,  and  the  specific\nrates  will  be  those  of  the  1998  Land  Administration  Law.33  This  sets  the  land  compensation\ncomponent  at  6-10  times  the  average  annual  output  value  over  the  past  three  years,  and  the\nresettlement  subsidy  is  4-6  times  that  value.  Within  this  range,  the  specific  entitlements  are\nbeing finalized.\n\nThe  1998  Land  Administration  Law  provides  for  disclosure  and  consultation  with  the\n89.\naffected  people.  YRCC  agreed  to  ensure  that  copies  of  the  resettlement  plan,  in  the  Chinese\nlanguage, are placed in the township offices for perusal by the affected people. The temporary\nresettlement  offices  and  township  governments  are  responsible  for  receiving  the  comments  of\nthe affected people and addressing their concerns. There will be intensive consultation with all\naffected people during asset inventory and valuation at the household level.  MWR will ensure\nthat  written  agreements  are  signed  with  each  affected  collective,  household,  and  enterprise\nbefore construction begins.\n\n5. \n\nTraining Program\n\n90.\nTraining  will  be  conducted  for  about  400  staff  members  of  YRCC  and  selected  local\ngovernment  officials  involved  in  implementing  resettlement,  environmental  aspects,  and\neconomic  evaluation  of  the  candidate  subprojects.  To  provide  targeted  training  inputs  and  in\nconsultation  with  the  international  consultants,  national  institutions  with  specific  expertise  in\nthese areas will be selected and engaged in accordance with selection criteria and procedures\nacceptable to ADB.\n\n91.\nImplementing the nonstructural measures for flood management involves research and\ndevelopment in the methodology and adoption of new technologies tested elsewhere. Essential\nto the activities are well-trained groups of people at YRCC. International and domestic experts\nwill  be  required  to  set  up  the  flood  forecasting  and  warning  system  and  the  morphological\nmodeling  systems,  deploy  advanced  survey  equipment,  establish  ESD,  and  transfer  the\ntechnology to YRCC staff. Technology transfer will be achieved by a combination of on-the-job\ntraining and specialized training courses conducted overseas and in the country.\n\n92.\nTraining  in  resettlement  will  be  offered  to  members  of  the  county  and  township  project\nleading  groups  and  working  groups  in  designated  subproject  sites.  The  training  will  cover\napplied  aspects  of  resettlement  legislation  and  compensation,  participatory  social  survey  and\nsite  planning  methods,  management  of  resettlement  activities  and  funds,  techniques  for\nrestoring livelihood, and practical M&E techniques. This training will be at standards appropriate\nto  the  functional  responsibilities  and  interests  of  participants  and  based  on  a  simple  needs\nassessment process. A qualified domestic consultant will conduct a needs assessment for the\ntraining, involving the YRCC resettlement staff in a learning capacity.  Responsibility for further\ndeveloping and conducting locally appropriate training courses will then pass on to YRCC staff\n\n                                                \n33 Presently MWR is reviewing and processing the revision of the 1991 MWR Guidelines for Implementing Medium to\nLarge Hydropower Project, to reflect recent developments and the recent changes in the Land Administration Law\n(1998).\n\n\f23\n\nwho  will  offer  the  training  for  subsequent  approved  subprojects.    This  may  ultimately  develop\ninto  a  formal  certification  procedure  for  trainers  in  river-based  resettlement  and  course\ngraduates.\n\n6. \n\nProcurement\n\na. \n\nEquipment, Vehicles, and Civil Works\n\nGoods  and  services  for  ADB-financed  contracts  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with\n93.\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Major  contracts  for  equipment  valued  at  more  than\n$500,000 will be undertaken through ADB\u2019s international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures.\nSmaller equipment packages, of $500,000 or less each, will be procured following international\nshopping procedures. Civil works contracts estimated to cost more than $5 million will be carried\nout using ICB procedures while those of $5 million equivalent or less will be carried out using\nlocal  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  in  accordance  with  the  tendering  and  bidding  law\nand  related  regulations.34  Local  contractors  have  the  necessary  expertise,  experience,  and\ncapacity  to  undertake  these  contracts.  However,  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines for\nProcurement,  foreign  contractors  may  bid  on  contracts  using  LCB.  Civil  works  for  the  village\nflood  protection  component  costing  $1  million  or  less  per  package  will  be  implemented  under\nforce account basis, since it would be difficult for local contractors to implement the component,\nwhich  requires  close  coordination  with  large  numbers  of  villagers.  The  list  of  indicative\nprocurement packages is in Appendix 9.\n\nb. \n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing\n\nTo start project implementation early, ADB approved advance procurement action,35 up\n94.\nto signing of the contracts. ADB also approved in principle retroactive financing in an amount of\nabout $2 million (i) as mobilization payment of $1.7 million for the civil work contractors for the\nthree  core  subprojects;  and  (ii)  $0.3  million  to  procure  vehicles  and  office  equipment  for  the\nproject office, from 9 July 2001 to date of effectiveness of the ADB loan. Retroactive financing is\nrequired  because  the  construction  period  in  the  area  is  limited  by  cold  weather  in  winter  and\nhigh  river water levels in  the summer and construction needs to start in September 2001. For\nthe  Kaifeng  core  subproject,  construction  noise  and  activities  must  be  substantially  reduced\nfrom October to March to avoid disturbing the seasonal water fowl migration in the Liuyuankou\nNature Reserve. Hence, a deferment of civil works until the expected loan effectiveness in the\nfourth  quarter  of  2001  would  entail  deferring  the  project  civil  works  by  another  year.  The\nGovernment  requested  ADB  approval  for  advance  action  for  civil  works,  procurement  of\nequipment and vehicles, and selection of consultant firms for the flood management component.\nAdvance recruitment of consultants will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants,\nand advance procurement action will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\nThe Government has been advised that ADB's concurrence on advance action and retroactive\nfinancing does not constitute ADB commitment to finance the relevant expenditures under the\nProject or the Project itself.\n\n                                                \n34 The Project will consist of a large number of civil works contracts (mainly earth-related works) located in different\nparts of the project area. It is unlikely that international contractors will be interested in bidding for such contracts.\n\n35 Reported in the March 2001 issue of ADB Business Opportunities.\n\n\f24\n\n7. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n95.\nThe international consultants, including the consultant to be financed by the Government\nof Denmark, will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants,  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  selecting  and  engaging  domestic\nconsultants. The consultants for the engineering study (32 person-months international and 766\ndomestic)  will  assist  YRCC  in  the  areas  of  flood  forecasting  and  management,  morphological\nmodeling,  asset  management  systems,  reservoir  operation,  and  survey  equipment.  The\nconsultants  for  the  project  management  component  (48  person-months  international  and  384\ndomestic)  will  help  in  monitoring  the  environmental  mitigation  measures,  implementing  the\nresettlement  plan,  and  strengthening  PMO  operations,  particularly  ESD  in  PMO.  The\nGovernment  of  Denmark  will  finance  a  part  of  the  engineering  study  (10  person-months  of  an\ninternational  consultant)  for  the  flood  forecasting  and  warning  system.  The  Project  will  require\n80  person-months  of  international  and  1,150  of  domestic  consulting  services  including\nengineering  study,  project  management,  environment,  and  social  development  (resettlement).\nThe required consulting services are listed in Appendix 10.\n\n96.\nThe  international  consultants  will  also  work  with  YRCC  to  develop  methods  of  social\nanalysis to select and prepare subprojects, define the social costs and benefits of flood-related\nproblems, select options with minimum social costs, and prepare IEEs and land acquisition and\nresettlement  plans,  with  particular  attention  to  livelihood  restoration  and  methods  for\nenvironmental  and  resettlement  M&E.  Twelve  person-months  each  from  an  international\nenvironment  specialist  and  an  international  social  specialist  will  be  required  to  work  with  the\nlocal  sociologists  and  environmental  specialists  in  ESD.    A  feature  of  this  work  is  the  use  of\nlessons from the ongoing M&E in selecting and preparing future subprojects.\n\n8. \n\nImprest Account and Statement of Expenditures\n\nMOF  will  establish  an  imprest  fund  account  for  the  Project  in  a  commercial  bank  in\n97.\nBeijing to ensure that an adequate amount of the loan proceeds is available on a timely basis.\nThe imprest account will cover disbursement related to the Project, to a ceiling of 10 percent of\nthe total loan amount. The account will be operated and maintained in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January  2001),  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  and  the\nenhanced statement of expenditure procedures for ADB loans.\n\n9. \n\nReport, Accounts, and Audit\n\n98.\nYRCC  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  indicating  progress  made,  problems\nencountered during the period under review, steps taken or proposed to remedy the problems,\nthe proposed program of activities, and the expected progress during the following quarter. For\nthe  village  flood  protection  component,  the  local  government  concerned  will  also  prepare\nquarterly progress reports for subproject areas for which it is responsible. Both YRCC and the\nlocal  governments  will  submit  their  respective  progress  reports  to  MWR.  Subsequently,  MWR\nwill  review  and  submit  the  progress  report  to  ADB.  In  addition  to  periodic  reporting  and\nmonitoring, ADB and the Government will jointly review project implementation at least once a\nyear to identify and resolve major issues.\n\n99.\n  Within  six  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  MWR  will  submit  to  ADB  a\ncompletion report that describes subproject selection and design, implementation, actual costs\nincurred in relation to cost estimates, benefits, beneficiary consultations, and other information\nrequested by ADB.\n\n\f25\n\n100. MWR  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  sufficient  to  identify  the  goods  and\nservices  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan,  the  financing  resources  received,  the\nexpenditures  incurred  for  the  Project,  and  the  use  of  local  funds.  The  accounts  will  be\nestablished  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  The  annual\nconsolidated project accounts and related financial statements for the Executing Agency will be\naudited  and  translated  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.36  The  audited  reports  and  related\nfinancial  statements  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  not  later  than  nine  months  after  the  end  of  the\nfiscal year to which they relate. The Government was informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of\naudited accounts, which covers failure in submitting audited accounts and financial statements\nwithin the due date. A formal warning will be issued for accounts more than 6 months overdue\nand disbursements will be suspended for accounts that are 12 months overdue.\n\n10. \n\nAnnual and Midterm Review\n\n101.\nThe Government and ADB will review project implementation annually. In the third year,\nthey will carry out a midterm review of project achievements. The midterm review will critically\nassess  the  project  parameters__including  both  physical  progress  as  well  as  progress  on  the\npolicy  agenda  and  institutional  performance__evaluate  whether  the  Project  will  achieve  the\nintended  objectives  and  benefits,  and  take  appropriate  measures  including  modifying  design\nand reallocating resources as necessary.\n\n11. \n\nProject Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n102. A set of indicators to estimate the project impact in relation to goals, purposes, outputs,\nand conditions has been agreed upon by ADB and YRCC. The main items include (i) economic\ndevelopment  and  poverty  indicators  in  the  project  area;  (ii)  hydrological  and  morphological\nindicators such as frequency of flooding in the lower reaches of the Yellow River; (iii) physical\nprogress of the Project; and (iv) social impact indicators, including progress in relocation. YRCC\nwill prepare and maintain records of such information for at least five years after the completion\nof civil works. YRCC will monitor and assess activities, and include the results in the quarterly\nprogress reports to ADB.\n\n103. Project  monitoring  and  evaluation  (PME)  based  on  the  participatory  rural  appraisal\n(PRA)  approach  will  be  undertaken  to  assess  changes  in  socio-economic  conditions  in  the\nsubproject area. The key PRA quantitative indicators are agricultural and commercial production\npatterns;  incomes  and  expenditure  levels;  poverty  reduction  effects  though  income  and  social\ncapabilities;  access  to  public  and  private  technical,  social  services,  and  utilities;  and  village\norganization.  An  international  specialist  and  domestic  consultants  will  work  together  to  advise\nYRCC  on  appropriate  PRA  methods  and  give  field  training  in  applying  the  methods  during\nimplementation  of  relevant  project  activities.  Trainees  will  include  relevant  staff  from  ESD;\nResettlement,  Planning,  and  Design  Sections  of  YRCC;  PMO;  and  staff  from  the  poverty\nalleviation  and  development  offices  at  the  project  sites.  The  aim  of  the  training  and  field\napplication  is  to  ensure  that  relevant  PRA  skills  are  identified,  understood,  adapted,  and\nincorporated into YRCC\u2019s social survey working practice.\n\n104.\nIndependent  resettlement  PME  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on\ninvoluntary  resettlement  to  ensure  that  all  persons  affected  by  land  acquisition  for  the\nsubprojects  are  compensated  adequately  and  in  a  timely  manner,  and  are  resettled  in\n\n                                                \n36  ADB  is  assisting  to  strengthen  PRC's  auditing  procedures  under  TA  3103-PRC:  Strengthening the Government\n\nAuditing System, for $700,000, approved on 26 November 1998.\n\n\f26\n\naccordance with the resettlement plan so that they will be at least as well off as they would have\nbeen  in  the  absence  of  the  subprojects.  YRCC  will  commission  an  independent  domestic\nresearch  institution,  acceptable  to  ADB,  to  undertake  this  work.  Monitoring  responsibilities  will\ninclude  reviewing  resettlement  entitlements;  and  preparing  annual  reports  during  project\nimplementation,  an  evaluation  report  on  achievement  of  resettlement  objectives  at  project\ncompletion  and  then  one  year  thereafter.  All  reports  will  require  fieldwork  to  collect  and  verify\ndata,  and  will  describe  the  field  research  methodologies  employed,  and  the  number  and\nproportion of locations and households surveyed.\n\n12. \n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\n105. All  facilities  and  structures  constructed  and  rehabilitated  under  the  Project  will  be\noperated  and  maintained  by  YRCC  during  implementation  and  after  completion  of  the  works.\nThe O&M requirement of the structures, estimated at Y36.8 million ($4.4 million) per annum at\n2000 prices, will be given to YRCC through MWR as annual budgetary allocation.  Another Y5.3\nmillion ($0.6 million) will be required for O&M of vehicles and equipment to be procured under\nthe  Project.  A  cost  recovery  mechanism  for  O&M  of  the  completed  facilities  will  be  further\nstudied  through  the  associated  TA  (paras.  118-120).  The  local  government  concerned  will  be\nresponsible for O&M of the village facilities from their own resources. ADB may request at any\ntime before and during project implementation copies of approved O&M budgets for works and\nfacilities to be financed under the Project.\n\n13. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption\n\nin  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement, \n\n106. During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to the central and\nlocal  governments,  and  YRCC  officials.  Attention  was  drawn  to  the  section  on  fraud  and\ncorruption \nfor\nbidders/suppliers/contractors  to  observe  the  highest  standards  of  ethics  in  procuring  and\nexecuting  ADB-financed  contracts,  and  the  sanctions  if  fraud  and  corruption  are  discovered.\nSimilarly,  the  anticorruption  provisions  added  to  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nwere discussed.\n\nparticularly \n\nneed \n\nthe \n\nThe Government is increasingly concerned with governance issues and has conducted\n107.\nwell-publicized campaigns against official corruption. The Tendering and Bidding Law stipulates\nthat tender and bidding activities will follow the principles of openness, fairness, impartiality, and\ngood  faith  (Article  5).  This  law  covers  key  construction  projects  funded  by  the  State  and  all\nexternally  funded  projects.  Article  6  stipulates  that  \u201cno  organizations  or  persons  shall,  by  any\nmeans,  limit  or  exclude  legal  persons  or  other  organizations  outside  from  other  regions  or\nsystems  from  participating  in  the  bidding  procedure.  No  illegal  interference  in  any  form  is\npermitted  in  the  bidding  process.\u201d  Article  32  specifically  prohibits  bribes  and  collusion,  while\nArticles 49-64 specify appropriate sanctions for all abuses of the law, including substantial fines\nand  criminal  prosecution.  ADB  is  helping  to  develop  the  implementation  regulations  for  the\nTendering and Bidding Law.37\n\n                                                \n37 TA  3457-PRC:  Implementation  of  the  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  and  Related  Regulations,  for  $565,000,\n\napproved on 14 June 2000.\n\n\f27\n\nG. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironment\n\nThe  Project  is  in  environmental  category  B.  IEEs  were  prepared  for  the  three  core\n108.\nsubprojects based on data collected during the feasibility studies, review of related reports, and\nconsultations  with  concerned  government  offices  and  affected  communities.  An  SIEE  was\ncirculated to the Board on 2 February 2001. The IEE concludes that the negative environmental\nimpacts  arising  from  construction  and  operation  of  project  facilities  can  be  kept  at  acceptable\nlevels through implementation of mitigation measures that will be monitored by an independent\ninstitution  to  be  recruited  under  the  Project.  The  IEE  stated  that  EIA  was  not  required  for  the\nthree core subprojects. The IEE reports (translated into the local language) were made available\nto  the public and other interested  parties in the Project\u2019s field offices in Shandong and Henan\nprovinces.\n\n109.\nThe  IEEs  for  the  candidate  subprojects  will  be  prepared  in  packages  considering  the\ngeographic  location,  similarity,  and  timing  of  subprojects  construction.  Approval  for  the\nIEE/EIA38 of each package will be obtained from SEPA and ADB before construction starts. The\nIEEs  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  relevant  Government  environmental  laws  and\nregulations  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines.  During  implementation  and  operation  of  the\ncore  and  candidate  subprojects,  MWR/YRCC  will  also  comply  with  all  applicable  national,\nprovincial, and local environmental laws and regulations.\n\n110.\nThe  Project  will  cause  some  negative  as  well  as  positive  environmental  impacts.\nPotential negative environmental impacts include (i) temporary loss of farmland (151.3 ha) to be\nused as borrow pits, temporary access roads, storage for pipelines, and construction sites; and\npermanent  acquisition  of  land  (321.5  ha)  for  the  construction  of  warping39  areas,  tree  planting\nfor the wave protection belt, new village platforms, and road construction and widening; (ii) use\nof  a  large  volume  of  groundwater  for  warping  of  earth  in  Kaifeng  and  Changyuan  and  its\ndisposal  after  use;  (iii)  temporary  large  contractors'  camps,  which  may  cause  social  tension\namong villagers, water body contamination, and solid waste disposal; (iv) disturbance and illegal\nhunting of migrating waterfowl and wildlife, particularly at the location close to the core area of\nthe  Liuyuankou  Wetland  Nature  Reserve;  (v)  potential  erosion  of  unconsolidated  material  in\nareas  with  bare  soil  such  as  new  embankments,  newly  warped  areas,  temporary  roads,  and\nconstruction  sites;  and  (vi)  use  of  heavy  machinery  and  a  large  number  of  construction-\nassociated  vehicles  that  may  cause  environmental  pollution  (emission,  used  oils,  grease,  tar,\nand cement) and noise.\n\n111.\nThe  mitigation  measures  are  as  follows:  (i)  affected  people  will  be  compensated,  and\nincome  opportunities  created  to  restore  the  livelihood  of  permanently  displaced  people;  (ii)\naround  60  wells  will  be  uniformly  spread  in  each  of  the  subproject  areas  to  minimize  the\nlowering  of  water  table,  and  excess  water  will  be  used  for  irrigation,  recycled  in  the  slurry\nprocess  during  warping,  or  drained  into  the  Yellow  River;  (iii)  labor  camp  management  will\n\n                                                \n38 The  PRC  classifies  EIAs  into  three  categories:  Category  I:  projects  with  low  or  no  environmental  impacts  are\nrequired  to  prepare  EIA  table,  Category  II:  projects  with  moderate  impacts  are  required  to  prepare  EIA  form\n(equivalent to ADB\u2019s IEE requirement), and Category III: projects with significant impacts are required to prepare a\nfull EIA. SEPA has classified the Project as Category II. The EIA to be submitted to SEPA will follow Government\nprocedures and format, and the IEE to be submitted to ADB will follow ADB\u2019s IEE guidelines and format, but they\nwill be very similar in content. Both reports will be submitted to SEPA and ADB simultaneously for review.\n\n39  Extraction  of  silt-water  fluid  from  the  riverbed  by  suction  and  pumping  of  slurry  overland  to  the  land  side  of  the\n\nembankment, where it is deposited and drained, forming a banquette typically 100 m wide.\n\n\f28\n\nprovide  guidelines  on  social  aspects  to  avoid  conflict  with  villagers,  employ  local  community\nmembers as much as possible, raise awareness of the area\u2019s ecological status for the Kaifeng\nsubproject (e.g., strict control of, and penalty for, hunting waterfowl), and solid and liquid wastes\nmanagement  at  the  labor  camp;  (iv)  to  prevent  waterfowl  hunting,  the  borrow  pits  near  the\nLiuyuankou Wetland Nature Reserve will not be used during the bird migration season; (v) new\nembankments, warped areas, and platform slopes will be provided with reasonably fertile topsoil\nand planted with vegetation cover, and bare areas will be replanted; (vi) machinery will be kept\naway from the Liuyuankou Wetland Nature Reserve, no closer than 1 km from sensitive areas,\nand its nighttime use strictly controlled; (vii) vehicle speed will be limited to a maximum of 30 km\nper  hour  and  temporary  roads  moistened  when  necessary  to  minimize  dust;  and  (viii)  safety\nprocedures will be implemented to prevent accidents involving the use of dangerous materials\nand inflammable or corrosive fluids.\n\n112.\nThe potential positive environmental impacts are as follows: (i) warping wastewater can\nbe used to irrigate farmland in the inner floodplain; (ii) the abandoned borrow pits will become\nartificial  wetlands  of  value  to  wildlife  and  migrating  waterfowl;  and  (iii)  tree  planting  and\nreforestation programs will produce better ground cover, reduce erosion, and generate income.\n\n113. ESD40 in the PMO will monitor and supervise the implementation of mitigation measures\nfor the environmental and social impacts of the three core subprojects during the construction\nand  operational  stages,  and  apply  this  experience  to  the  other  subprojects.  ESD  will  be\nstrengthened and will have an approved budget to support its staff. An international environment\nspecialist  will  be  recruited  to  assist  in  overall  environmental  management  of  the  core\nsubprojects,  including  incorporation  of  environmental  mitigation  measures  into  the  bidding\ndocuments  and  contractor\u2019s  contract,  and  advise  on  preparing  the  IEE/SIEE  of  the  candidate\nsubprojects  and  their  quality  assurance.  Overall,  ESD  will  give  advice  on  the  environmental\nmanagement of the core and candidate subprojects. In doing so, ESD staff will coordinate with\nSEPA  and  the  environmental  protection  bureaus  in  the  provinces,  prefectures,  cities,  and\ncounties. Environmental monitoring during project construction and operation will (i) ensure that\nconstruction is carried out according to design, and proposed mitigation measures are followed;\n(ii)  identify  any  new  or  unforeseen  environmental  problems,  and  determine  how  they  can  be\naddressed  and  mitigation  measures  formulated;  and  (iii)  ensure  that  environmental  and  social\nimpacts are minimized to acceptable levels.\n\n114.\nThe key environmental issues in the basin are flooding and water shortages, erosion and\nsedimentation,  surface  water  and  groundwater  pollution,  and  decline  in  biological  resources.\nStructural  measures  to  manage  flooding  and  water  resources  should  be  complemented  with\nlong-term  measures.  Long-term  solutions  need  to  focus  on  increasing  rainfall  infiltration  and\nwater  retention,  and  achieving  acceptable  limited  flooding  in  the  lower  reaches.  In  practice,\nthese  entail  increasing  the  cover  of  perennial  vegetation,  especially  in  mountainous  areas,\nlimiting cultivation and expanding terracing in hilly areas, and establishing flood retention areas\nin conjunction with land use planning.\n\n                                                \n40 The ESD will be headed by a division chief, and have environment and social subteams. The environment subteam\nwill  consist  of  two  experts:  one  with  an  ecology-cum-EIA  background,  and  another  with  an  environmental\nengineering  background.  The  social  subteam  will  consist  of  two  experts:  one  with  an  economics  and  poverty\nreduction  background,  and  another  with  an  agriculture  and  social  forestry  background.  Each  subteam  will  be\nassisted by 2-3 field technical assistants to be located in each subproject.\n\n\f29\n\n2. \n\nSocial Analysis\n\n115. A range of data sources has been utilized and compared to derive statistical overviews\nand  a  socioeconomic  profile  of  the  three  subproject  sites  in  the  context  of  a  river  basin  and  a\nprovince.  National,  provincial,  and  county/city  yearbooks,  agency  annual  reports,  thematic\nmaps,  and  specialist  reports  provided  an  initial  overview.  These  were  supplemented  with\ncounty-level  problem  identification  activities,  agency  and  local  leadership  interviews,  over  100\nhousehold  sample  surveys,  27  community  PRA  processes,  gender  analysis,  separate  group\ninterviews  with  men  and  women,  and  two  workshops  to  provide  feedback  and  receive\ncomments from key counterpart institutions. In all public consultations, there was strong support\nfor the Project.\n\n116. Henan  and  Shandong  provinces  have  relatively  well-developed  provincial  and\nagricultural economies. However, they have some poor areas that are particularly mountainous\nand flood-prone. A significant portion of these areas is within the land protected by the Yellow\nRiver  embankments.  Two  designated  provincial-level  poor  counties  are  in  the  proposed\nsubproject site at Dongping flood retention basin in Shandong. There is also a cluster of poverty\nareas along sections of the Yellow River near subproject sites in neighboring Henan. Poverty in\nthese  areas  result  from  a  flood-prone  and  depleted  physical  environment,  loss  of  assets  and\nincome  as  a  result  of  floods,  and  unanticipated  effects  of  past  resettlement  at  some  sites.\nBecause of the perceived risks of floods, people are unwilling to restore or invest in community\ninfrastructure,  services  and  farm  production  assets  that  might  otherwise  attract  external\nentrepreneurs,  or  support  self-funded  development.  Low  farm  product  prices  and  marketing\ndifficulties  present  additional  problems.  In  this  general  scenario,  household  poverty  is  further\nexacerbated  by  illness;  high  household  dependency  ratios;  and  lack  of  labor,  job  skills,  and\nqualifications.\n\n117. Central, provincial, and local governments have responded to this through a number of\npolicy  measures,  including  development  of  interarea  linkages,  engineering  flood  protection\nmechanisms, land improvement strategies and provision of poverty and relief support. However,\nfunding shortfalls, limited development of stable local income-earning opportunities, associated\ntechnical support and credit availability continue to hamper rapid improvement.\n\nH. \n\nTechnical Assistance\n\n118.\nThe current legal and institutional framework and arrangements do not allow for uniform\nand effective management of the Yellow River basin. In line with the proposed amendment of\nthe  1988  Water  Law,  the  Government  will  enact  a  Yellow  River  Law  to  specifically  address\nmanagement  of  the  Yellow  River  water  resources  through  adoption  of  a  unified  administration\nclearly defining the rights and responsibilities of each relevant department and local government\nconcerned. In this context, the Government requested ADB to provide a TA in conjunction with\nthe proposed loan to conduct a strategic planning study for preparing the Yellow River Law.\n\n119.\nThe  TA  will  (i)  review  the  baseline  information  and  data  on  social,  environmental,\neconomic,  and  technical  conditions  of  the  Yellow  River  basin;  (ii)  identify  socioeconomic\ndevelopment opportunities and assess the problems and constraints, giving due attention to the\nspecific  characteristics  of  the  river  and  the  diversified  nature  of  the  basin  area;  (iii)  review  the\nrelevant Government policies and plans as well as current institutional setup for water resources\nmanagement  in  general,  and  for  the  Yellow  River  in  particular;  (iv)  prepare  comprehensive\nstudies  pertaining  to  issues  in  effective  water  resources  management  and  sustainable\n\n\f30\n\nsocioeconomic  development  of  the  Yellow  River  basin;  and  (v)  prepare  policy  and  legal\nrecommendations for the formulation of the Yellow River Law.\n\n120. About 80 person-months of consulting services will be needed: 17 international and 63\ndomestic. The TA cost is estimated at $1.27 million equivalent, comprising $562,000 in foreign\nexchange  costs  and  $708,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  ADB  will  provide  $970,000\nequivalent  on  a  grant  basis,  from  the  ADB-funded  TA  program,  to  cover  the  entire  foreign\nexchange cost and part of the local currency cost, equivalent to $408,000. MWR will meet the\nbalance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $300,000 by providing office accommodations,\ncounterpart  staff,  field  surveys,  and  logistical  support.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and\nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  and  other\narrangements  for  the  selection  and  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  detailed  cost\nestimates and terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 11.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nEconomic Evaluation\n\n121. Economic  analyses  were  carried  out  for  the  three  core  subprojects  to  evaluate  the\nreturns on project investments to the economy (Appendix 12). The economic life of the project\nstructures is 40 years, including the construction period. A shadow exchange rate factor of 1.07\nwas  applied  to  derive  the  economic  cost  and  benefit  streams.  The  economic  wage  rate  of\nunskilled labor is 90 percent of the financial wage rates. Estimated benefits from the subprojects\nwere  derived  based  on  avoidance  of  damage  to  existing  assets,  avoided  disruptions  to\nagricultural and industrial production, and avoided emergency repairs of the flood embankment.\nKey assets in the flood-prone areas include standing crops, public infrastructure, and buildings\n(residential, commercial, and industrial). Potential disruption to economic activities is caused not\nonly  by  floodwater,  but  also  by  the  deposition  of  silt  on  agricultural  and  urban  areas,  which\nwould reduce agricultural outputs for at least one year and entail substantial recovery costs.\n\n122.\nTo calculate the economic internal rates of return (EIRRs), core subproject benefits were\nannualized by adjusting the total estimated flood damages by the probabilities of floods, under\nthe with-project and without-project scenarios. The magnitude of damage in different parts of the\nflood-prone areas was adjusted according to the expected levels of inundation as simulated by\nYRCC.  For  flood-prone  areas  with  lower  potential  economic  growth,  benefits  were  mostly\nderived from the lower risk of damages. In areas with good potential for economic growth, such\nas  Kaifeng  County,  benefits  were  largely  derived  from  enhanced  economic  growth  made\npossible due to investment in the core subproject. Benefits from the platforms were calculated\nas  those  of  the  embankments.  However,  potential  losses  due  to  flooding  were  limited  to  the\nestimated loss of private and community properties on existing platforms because the platforms\ndo not protect assets outside the platforms.\n\n123.\nThe  costs  of  subprojects  include  the  costs  of  land  acquired,  resettlement,  survey  and\ndesigns,  construction,  construction  supervision,  environment  mitigation  measures,  and\nsubproject  management.  The  costs  of  land  acquisition  and  temporary  construction  sites  are\nbased  on  the  forgone  economic  agricultural  incomes,  estimated  at  about  Y8,925  per  ha  per\nseason. The estimated compensation costs for structures dismantled as part of the resettlement\nactivities were based on their reconstruction costs.\n\n124.\nThe  estimated  EIRRs  are  14,  19,  and  17  percent  for  the  subprojects  at  Changyuan,\nKaifeng,  and  Dongping,  respectively.  Similar  EIRRs  are  expected  for  the  other  candidate\n\n\f31\n\nsubprojects to be included in the Project. These estimates are robust, given the relatively limited\nscope of benefits accounted for in the economic evaluation. The benefit estimates excluded the\navoidance  of  injuries,  hospitalization,  loss  of  lives,  mobilization  of  flood-fighting  crews,  and\nlarge-scale emergency evacuation that will occur during major floods. The economic evaluation\nalso excluded potential loss, such as loss due to disruption of communication and transportation\nto  areas  adjacent  to  flood-prone  zones,  and  loss  of  household  assets,  livestock,  and  farm\nmachinery.  The  EIRRs,  therefore,  provide  conservative  estimates  of  the  true  social  and\neconomic benefits of the Project.\n\nB. \n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n125. Construction of residential platforms at five locations in the Changyuan subproject area\nwill also provide opportunities for promoting communal solidarity through the process of village\ndevelopment and settlement planning. The Project will support exchange visits by local leaders\nand community-nominated representatives from the proposed platform sites to the successfully\ndeveloped  platform  sites.  An  action  research  program  involving  ESD  members  will  facilitate  a\nlocal\nparticipatory  planning  and \ngovernment,  and  planning  agencies.  The  program  will  involve  community  planning  of  new\nvillage  designs,  land-use  issues  (e.g.,  housing  standards,  sanitation  infrastructure,  and  public\nspaces), and managing and monitoring use of the development funds.\n\nimpact  monitoring  process  by  stakeholder  residents, \n\nC. \n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n126.\nFrom  1994  to  2000,  the  PRC  implemented  a  poverty  reduction  program  in  counties\nofficially classified as poor by national or provincial standards in remote mountain, desert, and\nloess  plateau  regions;  reservoir  catchments;  areas  with  endemic  local  disease;  and  former\nrevolutionary  bases.  Poor  transport,  environmental  instability,  slow  economic  growth,  lack  of\ndrinking water, and extremely harsh conditions for production and livelihood characterized those\nlocations.  A  national  workshop  in  1996  stressed  that  poverty  reduction  activities  should  reach\nthe  household  level,  respond  to  actual  situations  and  local  conditions,  respect  the  opinions  of\npoor  households,  and  promote  self-motivation  and  participation.  A  national  poverty  policy,\nconfirmed  at  the  poverty  conference  jointly  convened  by  the  Government,  the  United  Nations\nDevelopment  Programme,  and  ADB  in  May  2000,  recognized  that  the  poor  are  now  found  in\nboth  designated  poor  and  non-poor  counties,  in  rural  and  urban  areas,  and  predominantly  in\nwestern PRC. The poor and the near poor risk further impoverishment through environmental or\neconomic  shocks,  and  reducing  their  poverty  will  require  comprehensive  socioeconomic\napproaches  and  participatory  methods.  Such  methods  and  approaches  need  to  be  gender\nsensitive.  Predominantly  male  out-migration  to  undertake  seasonal  or  long-term  off-farm\nemployment has also resulted in women comprising a significant portion of the farm labor force\nin  a  sector  characterized  by  relatively  low  returns,  particularly  for  undiversified  grain  crop\nfarming.\n\n127. Based on Y1,000 per capita income poverty threshold,41 poverty incidence in the high-\nrisk  counties  is  estimated  at  11.8  percent  (13.2  percent  for  Henan  and  7.5  percent  for\nShandong). These are higher than the poverty incidence in Henan and Shandong as a whole,\nwhich  stood  at  11.0  and  5.9  percent,  respectively,  in  1999.  The  number  of  poor  within  the  43\n                                                \n41 Y1,000 is used as the equivalent line due to lack of available information. The international poverty line is $1 per\ncapita per day in constant 1985 dollars, purchasing power parity adjusted, which is equal to Y947 per capita per\nannum in 1999 prices (Source: The Leading Group for Poverty Reduction, the World Bank, and the United Nations\nDevelopment  Programme.  2000  China:  Overcoming  Rural  Poverty.  Paper  presented  at  the  International\nConference on China\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy in Early 21st Century, Beijing, 16-18 May 2000).\n\n\f32\n\nhigh-risk counties therefore, is about 3.9 million. Moreover, household surveys showed that 25.1\npercent  of  the  population  or  8.2  million  persons  belonged  to  the  Y1,000-Y1,500/person-year\nincome bracket.  This group, as much as the poor, is particularly vulnerable to flood damages\nand  consequent  losses  and  stresses.  These  income  levels  should  be  compared  with  the\nY2,000-Y2,500 loss per capita42 experienced in the past flooding in the areas. The data suggest\nthat  in  the  43  counties  alone,  a  major  flood  will  adversely  affect  about  12  million  persons  in\nterms of incomes and standard of living.\n\nThe  average  per  capita  net  annual  incomes  in  the  core  subproject  areas  range  from\n128.\nY1,386  to  Y2,202.  Poverty  incidence  at  the  subproject  sites  is  7.4-24  percent,  based  on  the\ninternational  one-dollar-a-day  poverty  line.  In  areas  such  as  the  subproject  site  at  Dongping,\nthere are pockets of poverty where village-level per capita incomes fall below the poverty line.\nPoverty in the floodplain is caused by location, lack of skills and income-earning opportunities\nfrom  nonagriculture  livelihoods,  poor  health  status  of  adults  in  the  family,  and  frequent\nhousehold  relocations  due  to  floods  and  past  resettlement  policies.  Non-income  poverty\nindicators  in  these  areas  include  seasonal  food  scarcity  in  some  counties  and  inadequate\naccess to clean water and sanitation. Adult illiteracy rates are 11-30 percent in nine villages in\nChangyuan and Kaifeng, predominantly among women. In the case of Changyuan, most of the\npoor reside on smaller and lower platforms with a greater risk of flooding. Their farms are small\nand  agriculture,  particularly  grain  production,  provides  60-80  percent  of  household  income,\ncompared  with  40-45  percent  for  the  non-poor.  The  detailed  social  and  poverty  impact\nassessment is in Appendix 13.\n\n129. During implementation, the Project will generate incomes for the floodplain communities,\nincluding  the  poor,  from  the  labor-intensive  construction  of  embankments  and  platforms.\nApproximately 23.5 million person-days of manual employment will be generated, of which 2.4\nmillion person-days will be needed at the three core subproject sites. This means employment\nfor  about  52,000  unskilled  laborers  over  the  next  four  years.  Based  on  the  estimated  poverty\nincidence  at  the  subproject  sites  and  with  priority  to  the  poor  in  jobs  at  those  sites,  about  2.7\nmillion  person-days  or  about  Y41  million  in  wages  will  be  directed  to  poor  households.  The\nestimated  employment  created  excludes \njobs  generated  by  construction  of  village\nfacilities__schools,  clinics,  and  utility  structures__on  the  new  platforms.  After  the  construction\nperiod, jobs will also be available for maintaining the new village platforms. This is estimated at\n14,600  person-days  per  year.  Although  project  activities  are  not  aimed  at  income  generation,\nthe  extra  incomes  earned  from  construction  work  will  give  households  the  rare  opportunity  to\nbuild  savings  and,  thus,  accumulate  capital  for  income-generating  enterprises  and  reduce  the\nrisk of their falling back into poverty.\n\n130.\nIn  relocating  houses  to  the  new  platforms,  which  is  voluntary,  the  Project  requires  that\npart  of  or  the  full  relocation  costs  for  poor  households  be  met  by  the  national  and  local\ngovernments. This particularly applies to the extremely poor whose poverty is long-term in nature\nand relates to lack of employment, debilitating illnesses, or other incapacities. The group includes\nthose  who  are  old,  childless  and  infirm,  widowed,  or  orphaned.  The  extremely  poor  are  on  the\nofficial register of the county civil affairs bureaus to receive state-provided clothing, medical care,\nhousing,  and  burial  expenses.  They  are  also  widely  recognized  by  other  villagers  as  a  discrete\ngroup that can be publicly and fairly identified for access to preferential relocation assistance.\n\n                                                \n42 In 1999 prices, based on data from Changyuan and surrounding areas.\n\n\fD. \n\nRisks\n\n33\n\n131.\nThe project design takes into account potential technical and economic risks. The main\nrisks,  which  could  result  in  implementation  delays  and  cost  overruns,  are  associated  with\nabnormal  rainfall  and  unexpected  floods  that  will  adversely  affect  the  construction  of\nembankments  and  river  training  works  during  project  implementation.  To  mitigate  these  risks,\nthe  project  design  includes  measures  to  facilitate  rapid  implementation,  avoiding  construction\nduring  the  rainy  season.  Advance  action  for  procurement,  consultant  recruitment,  and\nretroactive financing are expected to substantially shorten the time required to start construction\n(para.  94).  Adequate  amounts  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  available  on  a  timely  basis\nthrough imprest accounts (para. 97). The provision of project management consultants will also\nexpedite  subproject  selection  and  preparation  of  IEE/EIA  and  resettlement  plans.  These\nmeasures should mitigate the risk of delayed implementation.\n\n132. Although  the  ground  elevation  of  village  platforms  to  be  constructed  under  the  village\nflood protection component will be designed for above normal floods, there is the risk of floods\nexceeding  the  design  flood  level  (para.  68).  To  mitigate  the  risk,  the  Project  will  provide  an\neffective flood forecasting and warning system, giving timely and accurate flood warnings to the\nvillagers who may need to evacuate the inner floodplain. The Project will provide the equipment\nand software for the flood forecasting and warning system and the equipment of the emergency\nrescue team.43\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n133.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe Government will take into account the findings and recommendations of the\nassociated  TA  with  respect  to  the  integrated  management  of  the  Yellow  River\nbasin,  cost  recovery  mechanism  and  water  pricing.  The  Government  will  also\nconsult with ADB as necessary in preparing the draft Yellow River Law.\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  subproject  selection  and  implementation\nprocedures  set  forth  in  paras.  84  and  85  are  followed,  including  (a)  the\npreparation  of  IEEs/EIAs  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  PRC  environmental\nlaws and regulations and ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines, and approval of such\nIEEs/EIAs by SEPA and ADB; and (b) if required, preparation of a resettlement\nplan  in  accordance  with  PRC  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on\ninvoluntary resettlement and the resettlement procedural guidelines prepared for\nthe Project (Appendix 7), and ADB approval of such plan.\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  adequate  counterpart  funds  and  other\nin-kind\ncounterpart  requirements, \ncontributions from beneficiaries, are provided for the Project and subprojects on\na timely basis.\n\nlocal  government \n\nfunds  and \n\nincluding \n\n(iv)  MWR/YRCC will ensure that all lands and rights-of-way required for the Project\nare made available in a timely manner. For any subproject involving involuntary\nresettlement, MWR/YRCC will ensure that the resettlement plan is carried out in\n\n                                                \n43 The emergency rescue team is a semigovernment body under the supervision of YRCC and is financed 50 percent\nfrom the national budget. The team is a flood-fighting brigade, patrolling the embankment 24 hours during the flood\nseason and rescuing flood-affected people when necessary.\n\n\f34\n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\naccordance  with  PRC  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary\nresettlement and the resettlement procedural guidelines;\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  for  each  subproject,  the  environmental\nmitigation measures set forth in the IEE/EIA are implemented in accordance with\nthe relevant PRC laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines.\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  facilities  rehabilitated  or  constructed  under\nthe  Project  are  operated  and  maintained  by  YRCC,  except  those  facilities\nconstructed  by  the  local  governments  under  the  village  flood  protection\ncomponent, which will be operated and maintained by such local governments.\nYRCC will establish a PME system in the PMO acceptable to ADB, including the\nindependent  PRA  assessment  of  project  impacts  in  poor  areas.  YRCC  will\nconduct  a  benchmark  survey  at  the  start  of  the  Project  and  will  prepare  and\nsubmit to ADB a PME report upon project completion and one year thereafter.\n\n(viii)  YRCC will carry out gender analysis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender\nand  Development  for  village  flood  protection  subprojects  and  flood  control  work\nsubprojects  that  require  preparation  of  resettlement  plans.  YRCC  will  also\nmonitor  the  project  effects  on  women  during  implementation  by  collecting\ngender-disaggregated data and analyzing the PME and resettlement reports.\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  for  subprojects  under  the  village  flood\nprotection  component,  the  local  governments  will  construct  and  complete\nhousing for the poor and the public infrastructure under such subprojects within\ntwo years from the date of completion of the new platform.\n\n(ix) \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n134.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $150,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic\nof  China  for  the  Yellow  River  Flood  Management  (Sector)  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital\nresources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based loan facility,\nan  amortization  period  of  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  and  such  other  terms\nand  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and\nProject Agreements presented to the Board.\n\n2 August 2001\n\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n\n\f35\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber\n\nTitle\n\nPage      Cited on\n\n  (page, para.)\n\nProject Framework\n\n  36\n\n         1, 3\n\nADB Assistance to the PRC for the Environment\nand Water Sector: Loans and TAs\n\nDescription of Core Subprojects\n\nCost Estimates\n\nProject Fund Flow\n\nList of Candidate Subprojects\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nIndicative Procurement Packages\n\nConsulting Services\n\n  40\n\n         8, 32\n\n  42\n\n       16, 67\n\n  45\n\n       17, 72\n\n  48\n\n       18, 74\n\n  49\n\n       20, 83\n\n  53\n\n       21, 85\n\n  55\n\n       23, 93\n\n  56\n\n       24, 95\n\nSector Lending Arrangements for Land Acquisition\nand Resettlement\n\n     \n\n  51\n\n       21, 84\n\nTechnical Assistance for Strategic Planning Study\nfor the Preparation of the Yellow River Law\n\n  57\n\n       30, 120\n\nEconomic and Financial Evaluation\n\n  60\n\n       30, 121\n\nSocial and Poverty Impact Assessment\n\n  64\n\n       32, 128\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\n\nResettlement Plan for Kaifeng Embankment\n\nResettlement Plan for Dongping Embankment\n\nResettlement Plan for Changyuan Village Flood Protection\n\nTerms of Reference of Consultant Services\n\nDetails of Economic Analysis for Kaifeng Embankment\n\nDetails of Economic Analysis for Dongping Embankment\n\nDetails of Economic Analysis for Changyuan Embankment\n\nSummary Initial Environmental Examination\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\nH\n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 1, page 1\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nPerformance Targets\n\nAssumptions\n\nMonitoring\nMechanisms\n\nDesign Summary\n1.

and under the village flood protection\ncomponent,  Changyuan  platform  was  studied.  The  following  paras.  briefly  describe  the  core\nsubprojects.\n\n1. \n\nKaifeng Embankment Reinforcement\n\n2.\nThe project works entail strengthening over 8.4 kilometers (km) of the right embankment\nof the Yellow River in the vicinity of Kaifeng City.  The works will improve embankment stability,\nminimize  seepage  through  the  embankment  at  high  water  levels,  and  increase  the  time  an\nerosive attack from the river would take to breach the embankment. High rates of seepage and\nthe consequent erosion of the embankment material pose the greatest threat of a breach.\n\n3.\nThe  present  embankment  was  built  up  from  the  original  natural  levees  by  repeated\nwidening and raising through the years. The quality of construction works has varied according\nto prevailing technical knowledge and sociopolitical conditions. Many structural problems have\naccumulated  within  the  embankment  over  time:  (i)  non-homogeneous  soil,  (ii)  joints  between\nconstruction layers, (iii) lack of proper compaction, (iv) historical breaches and avulsions leaving\nweak foundations, (v) emergency repairs carried out with materials immediately available, and\n(vi) wild animal dens and burrows.\n\n4.\nConstruction  of  a  new  embankment  on  the  inner  floodplain  some  100  meters  (m)  from\nthe existing main embankment is proposed.  The area between the new and old embankments\nwill be filled with warped material.  Originally, warping was carried out using a sand-water mix\ndredged  from  the  riverbed.    Recently,  it  was  found  that  more  suitable  warping  material  is\nobtained from borrow pits on the floodplain close to the river. Where the new embankment and\nwarped area would affect existing settlements, a cutoff wall will be constructed in the old main\nembankment, leaving the settlements undisturbed. The total length of the new embankment is\naround 7 km, and the cutoff wall, 1.4 km.\n\nThe warping material is loosened and made into a slurry by high pressure hoses.  The\n5.\nslurry  is  pumped  overland  at  distances  up  to  5  km  to  the  area  between  the  embankments,\nwhere it is discharged into prepared lined basins and allowed to drain and consolidate naturally.\nBy  greatly  increasing  the  width  of  the  embankment,  even  with  poor  construction  material,  the\nstability  of  the  outer  slope  is  improved,  seepage  reduced,  and  the  distance  through  which  the\nriver would have to cut the embankment in the event of an erosive attack increased.\n\n6.\nWhere  warping  would  entail  significant  relocation  of  villages  at  the  inner  foot  of  the\nembankment,  cutoff  walls  are  proposed.  The  wall  is  constructed  along  the  center  line  of  the\nembankment  from  the  relatively  impermeable  subsurface  to  the  embankment  crest,  creating  a\nnear  impermeable  barrier  within  the  embankment.    The  wall  may  be  a  cement-soil  mix  in  situ\npiled wall, where the required depth is less than 16-18 m, or a diaphragm wall of nonreinforced\nconcrete  0.22  m  wide  for  greater  depths.  This  virtually  eliminates  seepage  and  the  threat  of\nembankment failure from seepage erosion.  While the construction of the piled wall is relatively\nstraightforward, excavating the trench for the diaphragm wall will expose cracks and voids in the\nembankment  structure.    Where  these  are  large,  techniques  to  construct  the  diaphragm  wall\nhave  to  be  perfected  by  the  Yellow  River  Conservancy  Commission  (YRCC),  which  will\ncontinuously study the most efficient and economical way of preventing floods.\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 3, page 2\n\n2. \n\nDongping Flood Retention Basin\n\n7.\nThe  subproject  is  in  Dongping,  Liangshan,  and  Wengshan  counties  of  Shandong\nProvince, and lies southeast of Dongping Lake. The Dongping flood retention basin consists of\na  209-square  kilometer  (km2)  natural  lake  (Dongping)  surrounded  by  an  embankment.\nImmediately adjacent is an artificial 418 km2 second basin (outer lake) that is also surrounded\nby an embankment.1 The Dongping flood retention basin is a vital link in flood management for\nthe lower reaches of the Yellow River and its main function is to cut off the Yellow River\u2019s peak\nfloods,  and  maintain  the  discharge  in  Aishan  (just  downstream  of  Dongping's  outlet  to  the\nYellow River) at below 10,000 cubic meters per second (m\u00b3/s). This is achieved by diverting a\nmaximum  of  8,500  m\u00b3/s  into  the  flood  storage  area.  This  function  is  vital  for  safeguarding\nstrategic  locations  downstream,  such  as  Jinan  City  (capital  of  Shandong  Province),  railway\nlines, and the oilfields. As the embankment has a number of structural weaknesses, significant\nupgrading  is  necessary  to  make  it  safe.  The  subproject  focuses  on  upgrading  the  outer\nembankment  along  the  artificial  outer  lake  and  removing  unused  old  irrigation  facilities.  The\nsubproject\u2019s  main  components  consist  of  (i)  constructing  about  18  km  of  diaphragm  walls;  (ii)\nreconstructing  stone  armoring  of  embankment  along  about  22  km,  and  placing  geotextile\nmaterial  to  strengthen  the  embankment  and  allow  plants  to  grow;  (iii)  dismantling  two  disused\nsluices;  and  (iv)  upgrading  10  sections  of  auxiliary  roads  along  a  total  length  of  about  900  m,\nand constructing 19 flood observation houses with platforms.\n\n8.\nOwing  to  wind-generated  waves  in  the  basin,  stone  armoring  is  required  up  to  the\npredicted wave height when the basin is filled.  Along the entire length, the armoring has to be\nraised by 1.0-1.5 m in places. The existing stone armoring is in a state of partial collapse and\nhas  to  be  rebuilt  on  a  proper  base.    Along  the  embankment  are  two  irrigation  sluice  gates\ndesigned to release water to the outer area for irrigation.  The gates date from the original multi-\npurpose  reservoir  design  and  are  no  longer  in  use.    The  sluices  lie  on  old  river  courses  and\nrepresent weak points in the embankment. They will be removed and the embankment rebuilt.\n\n3. \n\nChangyuan Platforms\n\n9.\nTo increase the security of the villagers living in the inner floodplain (i.e., unprotected by\nembankments),  it  is  proposed  that  raised  platforms  be  built  for  five  villages  with  a  total\npopulation  of  4,619,  together  with  improvements  on  the  evacuation  roads  and  bridges.    The\nvillages are around 4 km from the main embankment, and 2 km from the main river course.\n\nBased on a per capita area of 60 square meters (m2), the total plan area of the platforms\n10.\nin all five villages will be 650,000 m2.  Accommodation for the villagers will be constructed on the\nplatforms, 17 m2 per capita totaling 78,500 m2.  A new platform with one-storey houses is the\npreferred  option.2    It  offers  a  \"cleaner\"  engineering  solution  and  also  simplifies  resettlement\nplanning.\n\n11.\nA road will be constructed to the top of the platform, and the main roads in the villages\nwill  be  paved  (total  of  11.2  km),  new  school  buildings  in  the  villages  constructed  (5,000  m2),\ndrainage channels provided, and a belt of trees planted around the villages.

The\n\n                                                \n1 Currently, the lake bottom area is fully cultivated by farmers living outside of the retention basin. The area is strictly\n\ncontrolled by the local governments to prevent the migration of people from outside.\n\n2 A comparative study of one-storey houses with higher platforms and two-storey houses with lower platforms was\n\nmade.\n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 3, page 3\n\n150-m  bridge  across  the  Wenyan  Channel  will  be  rebuilt  at  a  higher  level  and  widened  to  a\ndouble carriageway.\n\n12.\nThe  borrow  pit  for  the  material  to  raise  the  platforms  will  be  located  around  1  km  from\nthe  main  river  beyond  a  low  embankment  constructed  by  local  people.    The  land,  though\ncultivated in the dry season, is reportedly flooded most years.  It is proposed to make a slurry of\nthe material in the borrow pit and pump the slurry to temporary spoil tips adjacent to the villages,\na technique known as warping, over a distance of 1 to 2 km.\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 4, page 1\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nCOST ESTIMATES\n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  Y3,347  million  ($405 million),  of  which  Y1,243\n1.\nmillion ($150.270 million) is the foreign exchange cost. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will\nfinance $150 million of the foreign exchange cost or 37 percent of the project cost. The Danish\nGovernment  will  provide  a  grant  of  $300,000  for  consulting  services:  $270,000  in  foreign\nexchange  costs  and  $30,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  The  ADB  loan  financing  will\ncover the interest during construction (IDC), commitment charges, and front-end fee. The total\nproject cost, excluding IDC and commitment and front-end fees, is estimated at Y3,135 million\n($379 million).  The  project  costs  include  incremental  operating  costs  for  studies  under  the\nnonstructural  subprojects  and  project  management  office  (PMO)  operations.  The  cost\nestimates,  however,  exclude  routine  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  of  infrastructure\nbuilt  under  the  Project.  Table  A4  gives  a  breakdown  of  the  total  project  cost  by  project\ncomponent.\n\n2. \n\nParameters and General Assumptions\n\nThe project costs were estimated based on cost and price data as of December 2000.\n\n2.\nThe following general parameters were used in estimating costs:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  exchange  rate  for  base  cost  calculation  is  Y8.27  per  $  for  the  project\nimplementation period of five years.\nDomestic  inflation  rates  were  assumed  to  be  2.0  percent  for  2001  and  3.0\npercent  thereafter.  The  foreign  exchange  costs  were  inflated  at  the  rate  of  2.4\npercent per annum.\nPhysical contingencies are 10 percent for all types of expenditure, except for the\ncost of core nonstructural subprojects and project management, which is set at 5\npercent.\nInterest during construction (IDC) was estimated on a biannual (6 months) basis,\nusing an interest rate of 6.32 percent per annum, the rate applicable to the 5-year\nswap  LIBOR  rate  for  US  dollars.  The  loan  outstanding  includes  loan  funds\ndisbursed, cumulative interest, front-end fees, and commitment fees.\nCommitment charges are 0.75 percent of the shortfalls in disbursements from the\ndisbursement thresholds indicated in the Loan Agreement. The thresholds are 15\npercent of the total loan amount for the first year of project implementation, and\n45, 85, and 100 percent for the second, third, and fourth years, respectively.\nThe  front-end  fee  equivalent  to  1  percent  of  the  total  loan  amount  (i.e.,  $1.5\nmillion)  is  charged  after  loan  signing.  The  amount  and  its  interest  charges  are\nthe  project\nthe \ncapitalized \nimplementation period.\nProject costs include duties and taxes applicable to the items required under the\nProject.\n\nthe  duration  of \n\nloan  amount \n\ntotal \n\ninto \n\nfor \n\nThe  following  are  the  estimated  foreign  exchange  contents  and  tax  rates  applicable  to\n\n3.\nthe different types of expenditure:\n\n(i) \n\nForty-three  percent  of  the  cost  of  civil  works  is  considered  as  indirect  foreign\ncost. Civil works include construction of village platforms and physical models for\n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nthe river morphology and reservoir operation studies. Civil works are subject to a\nvalue-added tax of 17 percent, or 14 percent of gross contract costs.\nOne  hundred  percent  of  the  costs  of  equipment  (including  earthmovers,  dump\ntrucks), materials (e.g., software and data), vehicles, and international consulting\nservices were considered as foreign costs. ADB financing excludes taxes, duties,\nand  related  local  costs  (domestic  shipping  costs  and  brokerage  fees).  A  value-\nadded tax of 17 percent was applied to the net prices of equipment, material, and\nvehicles.  Further,  a  100  percent  import  duty  was  incorporated  in  the  cost\nestimates of vehicles.\nThe  total  expenses  for  international  study  tours  and  training  were  considered\nforeign exchange costs.\nThirty-five  percent  of  the  cost  of  general  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  and\nenvironmental/resettlement  monitoring  of  subprojects  was  counted  as  foreign\ncost. Twenty percent of domestic training expenses was also considered foreign\nexchange  component  to  account  for  the  use  of  imported  training  materials  and\nshort-term engagement of foreign resource persons. The estimated rate of tax on\ndomestic training activities is 17 percent of net costs.\nLand  acquisition  and  compensation,  surveys  and  detailed  designs,  construction\nsupervision, construction of village facilities, dismantling of old village platforms,\ndomestic  consultants,  and  project  administration/PMO  operations  do  not  have\nany  foreign  exchange  costs.  Therefore,  they  are  not  to  be  financed  under  the\nADB  loan.  No  tax  will  be  levied  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement\ncompensation.\n\nADB  will  wholly  or  partly  finance  the  costs  of  civil  works,  vehicles,  equipment,\ntraining,  environment  and\n\n4.\ninternational  consulting  services,  domestic  and \nresettlement monitoring, and project monitoring and evaluation.\n\ninternational \n\n\fTable A4: Project Costs by Component\n\nYuan '000\nForeign\n\nLocal\n\nTotal\n\nLocal\n\n$ '000\nForeign\n\n% Total\n%\nBase\nForeign\nTotal Exchange Costs\n\n1.

RPF  and  RPG  stipulations  apply  to  all  subprojects  that  are  prepared  and\napproved for inclusion in the sector loan. Three core subproject resettlement plans (RPs) have\nalready  been  prepared  for  the  Kaifeng,  Changyuan,  and  Dongping  subprojects  in  accordance\nwith the RPF and RPG and these will form models for land acquisition and resettlement under\nnew subprojects.\n\nB.\n\nResettlement Policy Framework\n\n2.\nThe  RPF  reflects  both  borrower\u2019s  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary\nresettlement.  The  main  RPF  principles  follow:  (i)  minimize  negative  impacts  as  much  as\npossible, (ii) carry out resettlement and compensation so as to improve or at least restore the\npre-project living standards of the affected people (AP), (iii) fully inform and consult closely with\nAPs on compensation options and RP design, (iv) provide asset compensation at replacement\nrates,  and  (v)  provide  compensation  for  lost  assets  and  resettlement  subsidies  in  full  prior  to\nground  leveling  and  demolition.  Disbursement  for  each  subproject  will  be  conditional  upon\nADB\u2019s approval of the subproject RP.\n\n3.\nThe  RPF  stipulates  eligibility  and  entitlement  provisions  for  land  losses,  house  losses,\ncrop losses, and loss of other assets. Land losses will be compensated as follows: (i) APs losing\nagricultural  and  residential  land  will  be  compensated  through  land-for-land  arrangements,  or\nland  reallocation  within  village  domains;  (ii)  if  land-for-land  arrangements  are  not  feasible,  the\nAP  losing  agricultural  land  will  be  reclassified  and  provided  with  job  opportunities;  (iii)  cash\ncompensation  for  lost  land  will  be  paid  at  the  rates  stipulated  by  the  1998  Land  Law  to  the\nvillages  which,  in  turn,  will  use  the  funds  received  for  infrastructure  and  services  directly\nbenefiting  the  affected  communities.  Resettlement  subsidies  for  land  acquired  will  be  directly\npaid to the AP in cash through the village offices. Compensation for house losses will be paid\ndirectly to the AP in cash at replacement cost free of demolition costs and salvaged materials.\nCompensation  for  crop  losses will  be  paid  directly  to  the  AP  in  cash  at  current  market  prices.\nVulnerable  households  will  receive  assistance  for  house  relocation  and  reconstruction,  to  be\norganized  by  the  Village  Committee.    The  Environmental  and  Social  Division  (ESD)  in  the\nYellow  River  Conservancy  Commission  (YRCC)  will  pay  particular  attention  to  developing\neffective income restoration strategies for APs below the poverty line.\n\nC.\n\nResettlement Procedural Guidelines\n\n4.\nAppropriate RPs have been prepared for the three core subprojects. For subprojects yet\nto be identified, specific RPGs have been established to guide RP preparation and to provide a\ndifferentiated approach commensurate with the magnitude of the impact of each subproject.\n\n5.\nThe established RPGs require the following procedures: (i) after subproject identification\nand completion of preliminary technical design, YRCC carries out an impact survey to determine\nthe  magnitude  of  impacts;  (ii)  if,  through  this  process,  the  subproject  impacts  are  identified  as\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 7, page 2\n\nsignificant,1  YRCC  will  prepare  a  full RP; (iii)  if  the  initial  screening  concludes  that  subproject\nimpacts are less than significant, YRCC will instead prepare a short RP. 2\n\nD. \n\n Institutional Responsibilities\n\n6.\nThe  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  (MWR)  through  YRCC  has  overall  coordination,\nplanning,  implementation  and  financing  responsibilities.  Local  city  or  county  governments,\nthrough  the  resettlement  offices,  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  agreed-upon  RPs,\nincluding assets valuation, consultation, and delivery of entitlements. The local city and county\nland  management  bureaus  are  responsible  for  land  recording  and  acquisition  approvals.  Field\ntasks such as paying entitlements, selecting replacement land, providing livelihood support, and\nmonitoring will be the responsibility of township officers.\n\n7.\nMWR through YRCC will ensure that the resettlement offices are briefed on these RPF\nand  RPG  arrangements  for  subproject  developments,  and  on  RPs  once  they  are  prepared.\nMWR  through  YRCC  will  ensure  that  resettlement  budgets  are  delivered  on  time  to  the\nprovinces,  that  payments  are  made  directly  and  on  time  to  the  villages  and  the  individuals\naffected, and that any shortfalls required to meet resettlement objectives are made good. The\nentitlements will be given to the affected people before ground leveling and demolition start, or\nelse income support will be provided for the period of dislocation.\n\nE.\n\nDisclosure, Consultation, and Grievance Redress\n\n8.\nEach  RP  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  in  close  consultation  with  APs  and  will\ninvolve  surveys  and  village  meetings.  RPs  in  the  Chinese  language  will  be  made  available  to\nthe public in township offices. Complaints and grievance procedures will be established in each\nRP. Grievances will first be lodged with the village committee. If no settlement is reached within\ntwo  weeks,  the  complainant  has  one  month  to  elevate  the  grievances  to  the  County  Land\nManagement  Bureau.  If  still  unresolved  within  two  weeks,  the  case  can  be  sent  to  the\ncorrespondence  departments  of  other  government  agencies  or  the  resettlement  office.  Final\nappeal  is  available  in  the  civil  courts  as  established  by  the  Regulations  for  Administrative\nRedress.\n\nF.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\n9.\nYRCC will establish a monthly reporting system involving resettlement staff at township\nand county level. External monitoring will be assigned to an independent agency. MWR/YRCC\nwill report to ADB on land acquisition and resettlement in the quarterly progress report.\n\nG. \n\nResettlement Cost\n\n10.\nThe cost of resettlement and land acquisition for the three core subprojects is estimated\nat  $7.21  million.  The  amount  comprises  asset  compensation,  including  land  and  resettlement;\nincome restoration assistance; management costs; monitoring and evaluation; and taxes. Cost\nestimates will be adjusted annually based on the inflation rate in the previous year.\n\n                                                \n1 Significant impacts are defined as involving (i) 200 people or more, or (ii) 100 people or more belonging to national\n\nminorities or vulnerable groups.\n\n2 For full and short resettlement plan formats, see ADB Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice.\n\n\f2003\nJ F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D\n\n2001\n\n2005\n\n2002\n\n2004\n\nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE\n\nActivity\n\nWARPING\nLand Requisition\n\nSite Clearance\n\nEquipment Preparation\n\nBasin Dikes\n\nWarping (stage 1)\n\nWarping (stage 2)\n\nCUTOFF WALL\nEquipment Preparation\n\nEquipment Installation\n\nConstruction\n\n \n\nn\na\nu\ny\ng\nn\na\nh\nC\n\ns\nm\nr\no\nf\nt\na\nl\nP\n\nEncircling Dike\n\nWarping\n\nEvacuation Road\n\nRevetment Removal\n\nFoundation Clearance\n\nCutoff Wall Construction\n\nRevetment Construction\n\nBanquette Construction\n\nSluice Gate Closure\n\nt\nn\ne\nm\nk\nn\na\nb\nm\nE\ng\nn\ne\nf\ni\na\nK\n\n \n\nt\nn\ne\nm\nk\nn\na\nb\nm\nE\ng\nn\np\ng\nn\no\nD\n\ni\n\n \n\n5\n3\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n8\n\n,\n \n\np\na\ng\ne\n\n \n\n1\n\n\fACTIVITY\n\nJ F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D\n2003\n\n2002\n\n2001\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n(continued)\n\n \n\ni\n\ng\nn\nn\nr\na\nW\nd\nn\na\n \ng\nn\ni\nt\ns\na\nc\ne\nr\no\nF\nd\no\no\nF\n\nl\n\n \n\n \nr\ni\no\nv\nr\ne\ns\ne\nR\n\n \ni\n\nd\ng\nn\na\nl\no\na\ni\nX\n\n \n\nh\nc\na\ne\nR\n \nr\ne\nw\no\nL\nd\nn\na\n\n \n\nl\n\ny\ng\no\no\nh\np\nr\no\nM\n\n \ny\ne\nv\nr\nu\nS\n \ne\nd\na\nr\ng\np\nU\n\nt\nn\ne\nm\np\nu\nq\nE\n\ni\n\nInformation Network\n\nRainfall Forecast\n\nRainfall Runoff\n\nReservoir Operation\n\nFlood Forecast\n\nFlood Warning\n\nCommunication System\n\nHuman Resource Development\n\nInstitutional Development\n\nDatabase and Process\n\n1 Dimensional Modeling\n\n2 Dimensional Modeling\n\nHuman Resource Development\n\nPreparation\n\nFirst Campaign\n\nSecond Compaign\n\nMethodologies\n\nHuman Resource Development\n\nASSET MANAGEMENT\n\n \n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nt\ni\nt\ns\nn\n\nI\n\ng\nn\nd\n\ni\n\nl\ni\n\nu\nB\n\nSocial Dimension\n\nEnvironmental \nManagement\n\nProject Management\n\nFUTURE \n\n5\n4\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n8\n\n,\n \n\np\na\ng\ne\n \n2\n\n\f 55\n\nAppendix 9\n\nINDICATIVE PROCUREMENT PACKAGES\n\nEstimated No. of\nContract Packages\n\nTotal Amount\n$ million Y million\n\nProcurement\nMode\n\nPackages\n\nA.

(ii) identify socioeconomic\ndevelopment opportunities and assess problems and constraints, giving due attention to the\nspecific characteristics of the river and the diversified nature of the basin area; (iii) review\nrelevant Government policies and plans as well as the current institutional setup for water\nresources management in general, and for the Yellow River in particular; (iv) prepare\ncomprehensive studies of the issues for effective water resources management and sustainable\nsocioeconomic development of the Yellow River basin; and (v) propose policy and legal\nrecommendations in formulating the Yellow River Law.\n\nThe study will cover seven themes: (i) water resources management: focusing on a\n3.\ncomprehensive management system and mechanism for allocating and saving water, identifying\nthe supply and demand relationships between sustainable use of water resources and\nsocioeconomic development; (ii) water resources protection: focusing on the study of the\nresponsibilities and regulations for protecting water resources and preventing pollution; (iii) flood\nprotection and river management: river dredging and river training, including structural and\nnonstructural measures, and establishing effective flood control and disaster mitigation\nmechanisms, risk management system, and policy; (iv) soil and water conservation: setting\nrules and regulations for integrated planning and management emphasizing comprehensive\nbenefit evaluation through participatory approaches; (v) water pricing and cost recovery\nmechanism: evaluating and exploring the most efficient and effective mechanisms for collecting\nfees or levying charges or taxes on water users or beneficiaries, giving due consideration to\naffordability to the poor;

The Asian Development Bank\n(ADB) will provide a grant of $970,000 from the ADB-funded TA program to cover the entire\nforeign exchange cost and $408,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will\ncontribute the balance of the local currency cost of $300,000 equivalent (Table A11).\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\nMinistry of Water Resources (MWR) will be the Executing Agency and Yellow River\n\n5.\nConservancy Commission (YRCC) the implementing agency. An international consultant firm\nwill be primarily responsible for undertaking studies and developing practical recommendations\nfor the promulgation of the forthcoming Yellow River Law. Given the strategic importance and\nthe involvement of various sectors, a national steering committee (NSC) will be established for\ncoordinating the activities of the relevant ministries, agencies of local governments as well as for\nsupervising the TA. The members of NSC will be relevant specialists and representatives from\nthe State Development Planning Commission, Ministry of Finance, MWR, Ministry of\nAgriculture, Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Development, State Environment\nProtection Administration, State Forestry Administration, and other government agencies as well\nas representatives of the relevant local governments. Under supervision and coordination by\nNSC, the project management office (PMO) of YRCC will work closely with the consultants to be\nengaged under the TA.\n\nThe TA will be completed in nine months beginning in November 2001, by a team of\n\n6.\ninternational consultants in association with domestic consultants (80 person-months in total).\nThe international consultants (17 person-months) will be engaged through a firm and selected in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The consultants (person-months\nand category in parentheses) will have expertise in (i) water resources management (7\ninternational, 9 domestic); (ii) environmental policy analysis and planning and water pollution (2\ninternational, 9 domestic); (iii) institutional strengthening, with knowledge of and experience in\ntax, charges, fees, and pricing issues (3 international, 9 domestic); (iv) legal issues with\nknowledge of river basin management (3 international, 9 domestic); (v) macroeconomic\nplanning, with experience in regional development (2 international, 9 domestic); (vi) socio-\nanthropology, with experience in poverty reduction and ethnic minority issues (9 domestic); and\n(vii) flood management (9 domestic). A domestic consultant with knowledge of soil conservation\nwill be engaged for four months. Consultants will procure equipment1 in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement.\n\nThe PMO of YRCC will work closely with the consultants as counterpart staff. Additional\n7.\ncounterpart staff will be provided as and when necessary. The involvement of stakeholders will\nbe sought throughout the TA. The first NSC meeting, workshop, and tripartite meeting will be\nheld at an early stage of TA implementation to promote participation at all levels, agree on the\napproach to implementing the TA, and determine the detailed scope of the TA. Workshop\nparticipants will include representatives from the relevant ministries and provincial governments\nas well as relevant specialists. Representatives from external funding agencies, the private\nsector, and civil society will be also invited, but the TA will not fund their attendance, except for\nthe persons invited to serve as resource speakers. Representatives from the World Bank and\nAustralian Agency for International Development (AusAID) will be invited to present their\npreliminary findings and lessons obtained from the ongoing Yangtze River Flood Control and\nManagement Project. The second NSC meeting, workshop, and tripartite meeting will be\norganized at the TA\u2019s midterm to present preliminary findings and to elicit feedback. The two\nNSC meetings and workshops will coincide with tripartite meetings. At each workshop, the\nconsultants will provide concise reports for discussions. The reports will be revised and\nsubmitted to the Government and ADB for approval at the conclusion of each tripartite meeting.\n\n                                                \n1 Five  laptop  computers  with  appropriate  software,  three  color  printers  with  spare  ink,  fax  machines,  and  office\n\nfurniture.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\n\nAfter the consultant team submits the draft final report, the third NSC meeting will be held to\ndiscuss the outcome of the study and a future action plan.\n\nIt will be useful to have overseas consultation to observe the comprehensive large-scale\n\n8.\nand advanced river basin management systems in ADB\u2019s member countries and to exchange\nviews on river basin management with officials. The cost for overseas consultation will not\nexceed 4 percent of the total TA budget.\n\nA final report incorporating comments from the Government, ADB, and workshop\n9.\nparticipants, including key Government policy makers and experts from academic societies, the\nprivate sector, civil society, and other relevant specialists, will be submitted within one month of\nthe conference.

The analysis was conducted for\nan asset life span of 40 years, including the construction period. This estimate is conservative\nfor the types of structures built. The costs and benefits were expressed in constant 2000 prices,\nand valued using the domestic price numeraire method. All taxes and duties were excluded in\nderiving the economic values. Furthermore, the financial costs of traded goods were adjusted to\ntheir respective economic values using a shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) of 1.07,1 and the\nshadow wage rate for unskilled labor was estimated at 0.9 of the prevailing wage rate. All other\nlocal  currency  costs  were  assumed  to  equal  their  economic  costs,  after  taxes  and  duties  are\ndeducted.\n\n2.\nSince  the  Yellow  River  Conservancy  Commission  (YRCC)  does  not  generate  revenue\nfrom its flood protection services, and it is not operated as a financially independent entity, the\nfinancial  internal  rates  of  return  of  the  subproject  investments  to  YRCC  are  not  a  relevant\nindicator  of  subproject  sustainability  and  therefore  were  not  calculated.  Financial  evaluation\nfocused instead on the capacity of YRCC to sustain operation and maintenance (O&M) of the\nfacilities built under the Project.\n\nB. \n\nEconomic Costs\n\nThe  subproject  costs  include  the  costs  of  land  acquired,  voluntary  and  involuntary\n3.\nresettlement, surveys and design, construction, construction supervision, environment mitigation\nmeasures, and subproject management. The costs of land permanently acquired or temporarily\ndisturbed were based on the average value of crop harvests, averaged at Y8,925 per hectare\nper year. The costs of buildings to be dismantled due to subproject construction were based on\ntheir  replacement  or  reconstruction  costs.  The  economic  costs  and  benefits  of  the  capacity-\nbuilding activities for YRCC and its regional offices were not analyzed since the economic value\nof institutional strengthening cannot be reliably estimated. Since the subprojects will rehabilitate\nand  strengthen  existing  structures,  there  is  potential  for  savings  on  O&M  costs  in  the  future.\nHowever, due to lack of firm data, the potential savings were also not analyzed.\n\nC.\n\nEconomic Benefits\n\n4.\nBenefits  were  based  on  flood  damage  avoidance  due  to  the  subproject  investments.\nPotential  damage  includes  losses  in  fixed  assets  (crops,  agriculture  land,  homes,  public\ninfrastructure, and industrial equipment and facilities); temporary disruptions of agricultural and\nindustrial  production;  costs  of  emergency  evacuation;  repair  of  flood  control  structures;  and\nstunted  investment  and  economic  growth  due  to  the  prevailing  flood  risk.  Only  direct  and\nquantifiable benefits attributable to flood protection were included in the benefit estimation.\n\nFor  the  Changyuan  platforms,  the  potential  flood  damages  were  calculated  from  the\n5.\nestimated  value  of  assets  on  the  existing  platforms,  derived  from  field  surveys  conducted  in\n2000. The damage estimates were limited to assets on top of the platforms since the subproject\ninterventions will not protect assets outside the platforms. The extent (percent) of asset losses\nvaries with the level of inundation, types of asset affected, and size of inundated area. These, in\n\n                                                          \n1  SERF is the inverse of the standard conversion factor (SCF), which is 0.93.\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\nturn,  are  linked  to  the  probabilities  of  river  flow  rate  and  height  of  the  platforms.  The  new\nplatforms are designed to provide effective protection against normal floods.\n\n6.\nUsing historical inundation data and asset loss rates on the existing platform and a flood\ndamage  simulation  model  on  the  new  platforms,2  total  economic  losses  were  estimated  for\nvarying  levels  of  flood  severity,  for  the  with-  and  without-Project  scenarios  (Table  A12.1).\nAverage annual damages for Changyuan were, in turn, computed by estimating the area under\nthe  damage-frequency  curve  (flood  frequency  plotted  against  associated  damages).  Table  1\npresents  the  annual  damages  for  the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios  and  the  incremental\nannual damage avoidance, estimated at Y7.6 million.\n\nTable A12.1: Estimated Annual Benefits of Changyuan Subproject\n\nDamages (Y '000)\n\nAnnualized Damage Avoidance (Y\n'000)\n\nFlow\n(m3/s)\n\nFrequency\n(%)\n\nWithout\nProject\n\nWith\nProject\n\nWithout\nProject\n\nWith\nProject\n\nIncremental\nDamage\nAvoidance\n\n1,976\n3,215\n1,214\n911\n0\n246\n1\n7,562\n\n1,976\n3,215\n1,214\n911\n0\n246\n1\n7,562\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n8,070\n9,830\n10,710\n12,400\n13,400\n15,700\n19,600\n Total\n\n50.0\n20.0\n10.0\n5.0\n2.0\n1.0\n0.3\n\n3,951\n13,136\n21,230\n33,375\n33,375\n49,753\n49,963\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nm3/s = cubic meters per second.\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n7.\nFor  the  embankment  protection  subprojects,  represented  by  Kaifeng  and  Dongping,\nestimated  benefits  were  derived  from  damage  avoidance  to  urban  and  rural  assets  and\neconomic activities in the flood-prone areas, covering 11,500 square kilometers (km2) in Kaifeng\nand  3,000  km2  in  Dongping.3  Damage  valuation  was  based  mainly  on  values  of  crop  and\nindustrial  outputs,  public  infrastructure,  and  industrial  assets.4  For  inundated  areas,  a\nconservative  estimate  of  a  one-season  crop  is  assumed  lost.  Potential  losses  in  horticulture\noutputs, farm implements, and household items were not included in the calculation due to lack\nof  data.  Likewise,  the  necessary  cleanup  and  silt  removal  costs  from  urban  areas  and\nagricultural lands after the floods were not included in the damage estimates.\n\nAs in the case of Changyuan, flood simulation models were used to estimate coverage\n8.\narea,  inundation  depth,  and  percentages  of  asset  losses  under  different  flood  circumstances.\nFloods  with  a  100-year  return  period  are  estimated  to  cause  20-25  percent  damage  to  fixed\nassets in the flood-prone areas of Kaifeng and Dongping and dislocation of about 1.7 and 2.9\nmillion  people,  respectively.  The  estimated  total  losses  in  Kaifeng  and  Dongping  areas  due  to\nvarying levels of flooding severity are presented in Tables A12.2 and A12.3. Unlike the platform\n\n                                                          \n2  The potential flood losses are further detailed in Supplementary Appendix C.\n3  Simulation models during the feasibility study suggest that severe flood can affect even larger areas, 28,000 km2 in\n\nKaifeng and 9,100 km2 in Dongping.\n\n4  Values  of  public  infrastructure  and  industrial  assets  were  derived  from  the  book  values  of  these  assets\n\n(construction and purchase costs minus depreciation), which generally underestimate their replacement costs.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\nprojects,  however,  the  risk  (probability)  of  flooding  in  the  flood-prone  zones  is  determined  not\nonly by the river flow or water height, but also by the probability of an embankment breach with\nand  without  the  Project.  Incremental  annual  damage  avoidance  was  calculated  for  the\nsubprojects in Kaifeng and Dongping, based on the damage-frequency curves. The results are\npresented in Tables A12.2 and A12.3.\n\n9.\nDuring  the  project  life  span  of  40  years,  the  annual  weighted  average  damages  were\nassumed  to  increase  with  the  incremental  economic  growth  associated  with  improved  flood\nprotection.  These  are  1-  2  percent  per  annum  for  the  Changyuan  and  Dongping  subprojects,\nand  2-3  percent  for  the  Kaifeng  flood  protection  zone,  which  has  a  higher  investment  and\neconomic growth potential.\n\nTable A12.2: Estimated Annual Benefits of Kaifeng Subproject\n\nRiver Flow\n\nBreach Probability\n(%)\n\nFrequency\n(%)\n\nWithout\nProject\n\nWith\nProject\n\n5.00\n2.00\n1.00\n0.33\n0.10\n\n1.5\n1.6\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\nRate\n(m3/s)\n\n12,400\n13,400\n15,700\n19,600\n22,600\nTotal\n\nm3/s = cubic meters per second.\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nRiver Flow\n\nBreach Probability\n(%)\n\nRate\n(m3/s)\n\n15,700\n19,600\n22,600\nTotal\n\nFrequency\n(%)\n\nWithout\nProject\n\nWith\nProject\n\n1.00\n0.33\n0.10\n\n8.0\n20.0\n50.0\n\n0.0\n0.0\n5.0\n\nm3/s = cubic meters per second.\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nD.\n\nEconomic Rates of Return\n\nEstimated\nDamage\n(Y \u2018000)\n\n25,317,144\n26,241,014\n27,888,891\n29,012,365\n29,944,205\n\nAnnualized Damage Avoidance\n(Y '000)\n\nWithout\nProject\n\nWith\nProject\n\nIncremental\nDamage\nAvoidance\n\n18,988\n  494\n  428\n  159\n 52\n20,122\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n18,988\n  494\n  428\n  159\n 52\n20,122\n\nEstimated\nDamage\n(Y \u2018000)\n\n16,514,833\n17,213,277\n17,809,191\n\nAnnualized Damage Avoidance\n(Y '000)\n\nWithout\nProject\n\nWith\nProject\n\n13,212\n  510\n  346\n14,067\n\n0\n0\n 15\n 15\n\nIncremental\nDamage\nAvoidance\n\n13,212\n  510\n  331\n14,052\n\nTable A12.3: Estimated Annual Benefits of Dongping Subproject\n\n10.\nThe  estimated  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  are  14.4,  19.3,  and  17.1\npercent  for  the  Changyuan,  Kaifeng,  and  Dongping  subprojects,  respectively.  Sensitivity  tests\non  the  EIRRs  suggest  that  the  subprojects  give  fairly  robust  economic  returns  even  under\nadverse circumstances. Economic sustainability is most sensitive to delays in the realization of\nbenefits.  The  EIRRs,  however,  represent  conservative  estimates  of  the  economic  value  of  the\nProject,  given  the  limited  scope  of  benefits  considered  in  the  analysis.  Furthermore,  the\nestimated  benefits  exclude  avoidance  of  substantial  social  and  longer-term  costs  that  are  not\neasily  quantified.  These  include  losses  resulting  from  hospitalization,  death,  and  household\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\nrelocation;  and  disruption  caused  by  flooding  to  education,  family  life,  transportation,  and\ncommunications.\n\nE.\n\nOperation and Maintenance Requirements\n\n11.\nOperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  embankment,  warping  and  cutoff  walls,  and\nother related infrastructure range from Y60,000 to Y80,000 per kilometer per year, inclusive of\nY20,000 in staff and overhead costs. The costs generally correlate to the dimension (width and\nheight) of embankments in a particular location. The costs exclude in-kind material contributions\nfrom communities. In the past five years (1996-2000), YRCC has received adequate budgetary\nsupport  from  the  central  Government  to  meet  the  O&M  requirements  amounting  to  about  Y98\nmillion  per  year  for  the  lower  reach  of  the  Yellow  River.  These  were  allocated  to  O&M,  and\nrepair and rehabilitation budget line items of YRCC.\n\n12.\nThe  repairs  and  strengthening  of  aging  river  infrastructures  under  the  Project  are\nexpected  to  somewhat  lower  the  O&M  cost  of  these  structures,  at  least  in  the  medium  term.\nNonetheless, YRCC does not foresee significant reduction in O&M commitment after the Project\nand expects that adequate maintenance will be available for structures built under the Project.\nSince  flood  protection  remains  a  priority  intervention  area  for  the  local  and  national\ngovernments, YRCC expects to receive O&M budget allocations that are at least equal, in real\nterms, to the resources provided in 1996-2000. Through the asset management improvements\nto be carried out under the Project, YRCC expects to obtain more up-to-date and precise data\non infrastructure conditions. This will enable the agency to better estimate and allocate the O&M\nbudget requirements in the future.\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 13, page 1\n\nSOCIAL AND POVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n\nA. \n\nGovernment Policies on Poverty Reduction\n\nThe  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  National  Poverty  Reduction  Plan  (1994-2000)\n1.\ndesignated both the loess plateau and reservoir catchment areas as two of the five typical areas\nwhere  poverty  is  concentrated.  The  two  locations  are  characterized  by  poor  transport\ninfrastructure,  environmental  degradation,  slow  economic  growth,  and  low  suitability  for\nagriculture  and  livelihood.  National  and  provincial  governments  further  designated  official  poor\ncounties  as  the  target  for  poverty  reduction  activities.  In  1996,  the  Government  stressed  that\npoverty  reduction  efforts  should  reach  the  household  level  and  adapt  to  local  circumstances,\nrespect  the  aspirations  of  the  poor,  and  promote  self-help.  Recent  policies  recognize  that  the\npoor are found in both designated poor and non-poor counties, in rural and urban areas but with\nhigher  concentrations  in  the  western  provinces.  Because  the  assisted  poor  easily  revert  to\npoverty  because  of  adverse  environment  or  economic  shocks,  reducing  their  poverty  requires\ncomprehensive socioeconomic interventions and participatory methods.\n\n2.\nFor the central and eastern provinces (including the flood-prone area to benefit from the\nProject),  poverty  reduction  efforts  will  involve  (i)  identifying  locally  appropriate  mechanisms  to\naddress  the  remaining  clusters  of  poverty,  (ii)  mobilizing  national  support  and  human  and\nfinancial  resources  in  the  relatively  well-off  areas  to  assist  poverty  reduction  efforts,  and    (iii)\nstrengthening  water  management  infrastructure  along  the  lower  reaches  of  the  major  rivers  to\nprevent  severe  floods  that  contribute  to  major  relapses  into  poverty.    National,  provincial,  and\nlocal  governments  have  been  addressing  poverty  and  regional  disparity  through  a  number  of\nmeasures,  including  development  of  transport  infrastructure,  prevention  of  floods  and\nmanagement  of  natural  calamities,  land  improvements,  and  direct  relief  assistance.  However,\nbudget  constraints,  limited  development  of  income-generating  opportunities,  and  lack  of\ntechnical  extension  assistance  and  credit  availability  continue  to  hamper  poverty  reduction\nefforts.\n\nB. \n\nSocioeconomic Characteristics of the Yellow River Basin\n\nThe  Yellow  River  crosses  nine  provinces  in  its  5,464-kilometer  journey  from  western\n3.\nPRC to the Bohai Sea. The total catchment area occupies 795,000 square kilometers (km2) and\ncontains  about  18  percent  of  the  nation\u2019s  farmland.    However,  available  arable  land  has  been\ndecreasing  sharply  due  to  severe  erosion,  particularly  in  the  relatively  poor  Loess  Plateau\nregion  of  the  upper  and  middle  reaches.  This,  in  turn,  contributes  to  high  rates  of  river\nsedimentation, which can exacerbate flooding in the lower reach. High rates of water extraction\nin the upper reaches also produce water shortages downstream in the drier months and have\nencouraged the widespread practice of storing water among households and industries. Heavy\nwater extraction also reduces awareness of flooding as a potential danger among populations\noutside  the  embankments.  This  is  particularly  the  case  where  many  locations  have  not\nexperienced significant flooding in the last 50 years.\n\nC. \n\nCharacteristics of the Project Area\n\n4.\nAlthough  the  boundaries  of  the  lower  river  catchment  area  are  well-defined,  the\ndemarcation of flood-prone area to benefit from the Project (i.e., project area) follows the county\nadministrative  lines  and  therefore  is  less  precise.  The  project  feasibility  study  identified  113\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\ncounties within flood-prone areas in the river\u2019s lower reach (i.e., project area),1  while  a  Yellow\nRiver  Conservancy  Commission  study  in  1996  showed  that  43  of  the  113  counties  are\nparticularly  vulnerable  to  inundation  since  they  are  located  along  the  Yellow  River  and  its\ntributaries. The 113 counties are in the provinces of Henan, Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu, with\nthe  43  counties  at  highest  risk  confined  to  Henan  and  Shandong.  The  project  area  covers\n117,900 km2 and has an estimated population of 85 million. Hence, it is densely populated with\n723 persons/km2.

An  area  of  49,600  km2  that  covers  the  43\ncounties  in  Henan  and  Shandong  and  is  particularly  prone  to  inundation  has  a  population  of\n32.8  million,  including  28.8  million  in  agriculture  whose  livelihood  and  crops  are  particularly\nvulnerable  to  floods.  These  counties  are  likely  to  suffer  the  most  and  intermediate  potential\ndamages in the event of a flood (columns 1 and 2 in Table A13.1). The project area includes the\ninner  floodplains  (i.e.,  areas  inside  the  main  river  embankments).  The  inner  plains,  which\ncoincide with 85 percent of the lower river catchment area (4,647 km2), are home to 1.7 million\nresidents  living  in  2,193  villages.  The  inner  plains  are  relatively  densely  populated  (431\npersons/km2) and highly vulnerable to floods.\n\nCompared with the provinces in the western region, Shandong and Henan are relatively\n6.\nwell-off.  The  incidence  of  poverty  in  1999  was  estimated  at  11  percent  in  Shandong  and  5.9\n                                                \n1 Including county-level cities and city-level counties.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 13, page 3\n\npercent  in  Henan.  Poverty  incidence  in  the  counties  with  high  flood  risk  is  higher  than  the\nprovincial average__13.2 and 7.5 percent for Henan and Shandong (Table A13.2). This area is\ndensely populated, with 661 persons per km2. The rural population is estimated at 28.8 million\n(87  percent  of  total),  of  whom  10.7  million  are  part  of  the  active  labor  force.  Available  arable\nland is limited at about 0.09 hectare (ha) per person. The number of poor within the 43 high-risk\ncounties  is  estimated  at  about  3.9  million.  Furthermore,  household  surveys  showed  that  25.1\npercent  of  the  population  or  8.2  million  persons  belonged  to  the  near-poor  Y1,000-\nY1,500/person-year income bracket. The poor and those with incomes of Y1,500/person-year or\nless  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  flood  events  since  past  floods  in  the  area  have  caused\naverage losses of Y2,000-Y2,500 per capita.2 In the 43 high-risk counties alone, a major flood\nwill adversely affect about 12 million persons, incomes, and standard of living.\n\nTable A13.2.

Individual  hardship  is  exacerbated  by  illness,  high  household  dependency  ratios,  and\nlack of labor and skills. In the inner floodplains, houses are usually single-storey, farm sizes are\nsmall averaging 0.4 ha, no additional land can legally be brought into production, drinking water\nis  sourced  from  wells,  and  savings  are  sunk  in  livestock  and  assets  that  are  prone  to  flood\ndamage.  Interviews  with  residents  indicate  that  the  psychological  impact  of  losing  homes,\npossessions,  and  confidence  in  future  security  is  significant.  Most  of  the  poor  reside  on  lower\nflood  platforms  with  greater  risk  of  flooding.  In  the  subproject  areas,  agriculture,  particularly\ncultivation of grains, provides 80 percent of income for the poor, whereas non-poor households\nderive  45  percent  of  their  incomes  from  off-farm  employment.  Dependence  on  relatives  and\nlocal  agencies  increases  in  times  of  natural  calamities,  since  rural  financial  markets  are\nrelatively  weak  and  insurance  schemes  are  practically  nonexistent.  The  income-generation\ncapacity  of  poorer  residents  in  the  core  subproject  areas  is  hampered  by  higher  rates  of\nilliteracy  and  lower  levels  of  education,4  lack  of  sufficient  or  surplus  labor,  lack  of  access  to\n\n                                                \n2 In 1999 prices, based on data from Changyuan and surrounding areas.\n3 Estimation of poverty incidence at Dongping excludes data from the inner retention basin which has a poverty rate\nof over 50 percent. The households are excluded because they are not beneficiaries of the proposed embankment\nstrengthening  under  the  Project.  They  are  currently  receiving  assistance  from  the  national  and  provincial\ngovernments through an ongoing poverty reduction/livelihood program.\n\n4 The County Statistical Bureau sample survey of 2,960 persons (700 rural households) in Dongping County (1998)\n\nindicated that 8.3 percent of the population were illiterate or semiliterate.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 13, page 4\n\ncredit,  and  lack  of  social  capital  to  obtain  adequate  informal  credit.  Women,  who  form  a\nsignificant but underestimated percentage of the rural labor force, are typically burdened during\nflood events by the need to obtain drinking water, and fuel and food, to help maintain the health\nof family members and household livestock, and to protect household properties.\n\n8.\nSubstantial progress has been achieved in reducing poverty in the project provinces. In\nHenan,  official  figures  indicate  that  the  proportion  of  the  poor  (measured  by  the  provincial\npoverty  line)  in  the  total  rural  population  declined  from  38  percent  to  4  percent  between  1979\nand 1988\u2014net reduction of 21.8 million persons classified as poor. Almost 92 percent of rural\nhouses  in  the  province  are  now  constructed  from  brick  and  wood  or  reinforced  concrete,  and\nhouse  space  per  capita  reached  23  square  meters.  Average  provincial  figures  for  net  farmer\nincome per capita also indicate improved standards of living. Statistics from neighboring flood-\nprone  Shandong  Province  also  show  a  decline  in  the  number  of  the  poor  from  7.6  million  in\n1984 to 4 million in 1993.\n\nD. \n\nOverview of Social Benefits\n\n9.\nThe  Project  will  reduce  flood  incidence  and  damage  in  the  lower  Yellow  River  Basin.\nIndirect benefits include environmental improvement and prevention of potential impoverishment\nthrough flood risk mitigation.\n\n10.\n\nThe Project will yield social benefits for all residents of the flood-prone area through\n\n(i) \n\nfor \n\nimportant \n\nis  particularly \n\ninvolvement.  Risk  reduction \n\nReduced  in  risks  to  personal  safety,  livelihood,  and  assets.  Flood  warning  and\nescape  facilities  and  procedures  will  be  improved  in  ways  that  create  greater\ncommunity \nthe\npredominantly agricultural population, which relies heavily on grains grown during\nthe  flood  season  to  meet  home  consumption,  for  livestock  fattening,  and  for\nincome.  Funds  previously  devoted  to  insurance  or  replacement  of  assets  will\nbecome  available  for  alternative  productive  and  consumptive  uses.  Those  most\nlikely  to  benefit  are  riverside  residents  whose  flood-related  losses  have  eroded\nresource  reserves  and  hamper  investment  in  farm  activities.    Those  residents\ntotal  roughly  one  million  in  Henan  and  420,000  in  Shandong.  Evidence  from\nsample village participatory rural appraisal activities strongly suggests that poorer\nhouseholds \nlivestock\nproduction, for fear that animals will be lost to floods. Moreover, frequent house\nrebuilding  and  furnishing  have  significantly  drained  their  capacity  to  accumulate\nfinancial resources. The poorer residents, whose current levels of investment are\nconstrained  by  flood-related  fear,  will  benefit  from  the  security  provided  by  the\nProject in flood mitigation.\n\nin  high-risk  enterprises  such  as \n\ninvestment \n\nforgo \n\n(ii) \n\nImproved  local  government  financial  capacities.  Data  collected  in  the  Dongping\nflood  retention  basin  indicates  relatively  low  levels  of  government  investment  in\nlocal  social  services  and  infrastructure  provision,  particularly  for  drinking  water,\nlocal clinics, and roads.  Confidence that public infrastructure investments will be\nmore secure should encourage the government to invest in these locations.\n\n11.\nAlthough creating the necessary environment for income generation, the Project will not\nprovide focused assistance to the poor. The nature of flood mitigation requires that flood control\nstructures be placed in the most strategic locations to minimize inundation rather than in areas\nthat  contain  the  largest  number  of  the  poor.  Further,  the  Project  is  not  intended  to  support\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 13, page 5\n\nimprovement of income-generation capacities of households or address the key impediments to\npoverty  reduction  in  each  location.  The  Project  will,  however,  assist  poor  residents  in  the\nfollowing ways:\n\n(i) \n\nThe Project will foster community consultation and planning in designing\nsubprojects and formulating resettlement plans, which will enhance the\ncommunity\u2019s role in devising appropriate means of income restoration and\nallocation of funds and technical assistance earmarked for the communities.\n\n(ii) \n\nPriority in employment will be given to poor households, particularly in\nconstructing and maintaining the platforms and other related local facilities.\n\nE. \n\nProject Employment Impact\n\n12.\nThe  civil  works  under  the  Project  are  expected  to  generate  significant  employment\nopportunities and incomes to the communities, including the poor. For the Project as a whole,\napproximately  23.5  million  person-days  of  unskilled  labor  will  be  required,  of  which  2.4  million\nperson-days will be needed for the construction of the core subprojects (Table A13.3). With an\naverage  employment  span  of  3  months/person  per  year,  the  Project  is  expected  to  employ\nabout  52,000  unskilled  laborers  over  the  next  four  years.  Based  on  the  estimated  poverty\nincidence  at  the  subproject  sites  and  with  priority  to  the  poor  in  obtaining  employment  at  the\nconstruction sites, it is estimated that 2.7 million person-days or about Y41 million in wages will\nbe directed to poor households.\n\nNo  additional  employment  opportunity  will  be  created  for  embankment  maintenance\n13.\nsince operation and maintenance efforts and resources devoted to the river embankments will\nbe roughly the same with or without the Project. Incremental employment opportunity, however,\nwill  be  generated  from  the  maintenance  of  new  village  platforms.  This  is  conservatively\nestimated  at  14,600  person-days  per  year.  Employment  under  the  Project  will  not  be  a\nsustainable  income-generating  activity  in  itself,  but  the  additional  incomes  earned  will  enable\nhouseholds to build savings and accumulate capital to undertake income-generating ventures.\n\nTable A13.3: Employment Impacts\n\nChangyuan\n\nCore Subprojects\nKaifeng\n\nItem\n\nCivil work costs (Y \u2018000)\nShare of unskilled labora (%)\nUnskilled labor inputsb (person-day)\nPersons employed (no.)\nLabor of poor/Total laborc (%)\nLabor inputs (poor) (person-day)\n\n34,428.0\n20.0\n459,040.0\n2,550.0\n24.0\n110,170.0\n\n90,497.0\n16.0\n965,301.0\n5,363.0\n12.0\n115,836.0\n\nDongping\n\nProject\n\n95,831.0\n16.0\n1,022,197.0\n5,679.0\n29.0\n296,846.0\n\n2,120,323.0\n16.6\n23,464,908.0\n52,144.0\n11.8\n2,768,859.0\n\na Based on subproject cost data.\nb Average salary = Y15 per day.\nc Based  on  estimated  poverty  incidence  in  the  subproject  sites  and  project  area.  For  Dongping  County,  poverty\nincidence is 7.4 percent. In the proposed construction area, however, poverty incidence reaches up to 80 percent;\ntherefore, a weighted average of 29 percent is used to estimate employment impact.\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 13, page 6\n\nF. \n\nDistribution of Project Benefits\n\n14.\nThe  three  core  subprojects  were  analyzed  to  assess  the  distribution  of  subproject\nbenefits  to  project  stakeholders:  the  households,  industry  (including  state-owned  enterprises),\nand the public sector/economy. An assessment was also undertaken to determine the extent to\nwhich  the  Project  directly  benefits  the  poor.  The  economic  analysis  showed  benefits  to\nhouseholds were derived from employment opportunities, and direct avoidance of flood damage\nto crops and houses and disruption in farming activities. Industries will benefit from the Project\nin  the  form  of  reduced  risk  to  flood  damage  and  interruption  in  operations,  while  the  public\nsector  will  benefit  from  damage  avoidance  on  public  infrastructure  and  savings  of  flood\nevacuation costs of the affected population. During the construction period, laborers will accrue\nbenefits from employment opportunities at the sites. The public sector will gain tax incomes, but\nwill have to bear most of the costs of investment. Tables A13.4-13.6 present the results of the\ndistribution analyses. The poverty impact ratios are 0.93 for Changyuan, 0.17 for Kaifeng, and\n0.06 for the Dongping subproject.\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 13, page
