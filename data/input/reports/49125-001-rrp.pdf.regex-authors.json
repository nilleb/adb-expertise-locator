THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the Second Jharkhand State Road Project.1 \n2.  The  project  will  improve  about  176  kilometers  (km)  of  state  roads  in  the  state  of \nJharkhand. It will involve upgrading state roads to a two-lane standard. Five year performance-\nbased maintenance of the project roads will ensure sustainability. The project will also support \nincreasing the institutional capacity of the State Highways Authority of Jharkhand (SHAJ) as an \nautonomous road development agency aiming to ensure long-term sustainable development \nand maintenance of the state road network in Jharkhand. SHAJ will become the nodal agency \nfor promoting road safety in Jharkhand based on the road safety master plan to be developed \nunder the project. \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Jharkhand was established on 15 November 2000 through bifurcation from Bihar state. It \nis surrounded by five states: Bihar in the north, West Bengal in the east, Odisha in the south, \nand Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh in the west. It is known as a tribal and forest state. \nJharkhand is endowed with about 40% of India\u2019s mineral resources and has the richest deposits \nof coal and iron ore in the country. Despite this, it is one of India\u2019s poorest states with about \n37% of its 33 million population living below the state poverty line.2 The endowed natural \nresources have not efficiently contributed to the state\u2019s development due to poor access to \nthese areas and limited employment opportunities with the related industries. \n4.  Road transport is the dominant mode of transport in Jharkhand. The state has about \n2,000  km  of  railways,  which  primarily  serve  interstate  traffic.  Air  transport  caters  only  to \ninterstate traffic. National Highway No. 2 (NH2) connects Delhi and Kolkata through Jharkhand. \nThe state highway network provides connectivity to the NH2 from various parts of the state. \nOther categories of roads, including rural and forest roads, connect villages to the state highway \nnetwork. However, Jharkhand does not have an adequate road network. The state has about \n60,689 km of roads, of which rural roads represent about 82%. The road density is about  \n76 km/100 square kilometers, compared with the national average of 143 km. Jharkhand\u2019s main \nroad network3 is about 9,278 km; less than 40% meet the two-lane standard.4 About 40% of the \nmain road network is in poor condition. This constrains mobility between areas with natural \nresources  and  industrial  and  economic  centers,  and  access  to  social  amenities  for  the \npopulation. In fact, industries are concentrated in the central and eastern parts of the state \nwhere access to the NH2 is easier, widening the income disparity within the state. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2013. Press Note on Poverty Estimates, 2011\u20132012. New Delhi. For \nfiscal year 2012, the national poverty line for rural areas is estimated at Rs816/capita/month and for urban areas \nRs1,000. Corresponding figures for Jharkhand state are Rs748/capita/month for rural areas and Rs974 for urban \nareas.  \n3  Jharkhand Infrastructure Development Corporation. 2013. Road Prioritization Study cum Vision Document for \nIdentification of Viable Road Sections to be developed in PPP Mode in the State of Jharkhand. Ranchi. The main \nroad network comprises national highways, state highways, major district roads, and other roads developed by the \nRoad Construction Department of Jharkhand state. \n4  India\u2019s national target for 2021 is to ensure all national and state highways and 40% of major district roads are at \nleast two lanes. This means about 6,000 km of Jharkhand\u2019s main road network should be at least two lanes by \n2021. Currently, less than 3,700 km meet the standard. ", "2 \n \n5.  To improve mobility and achieve equitable development across the state, Jharkhand\u2019s \nRoad Construction Department (RCD) has set targets to increase road density by constructing \nnew state roads and improving conditions of the existing road network. An investment of about \n$2.5 billion is planned to develop and improve about 6,000 km during 2012\u20132017, including the \nconstruction of 79 bypasses and bridges. Aside from the budget for the continuing scheme from \nthe previous 5-year plan period, the government requires a budget of about $1.6 billion to \nachieve the target. \n6.  To  enhance  capacity  and  efficiency  in  improving  the  state  road  network,  the  state \ngovernment has created three autonomous bodies: State Highways Authority of Jharkhand \n(SHAJ),  Jharkhand  Accelerated  Road  Development  Company,  and  Jharkhand  State  Rural \nRoads  Development  Authority.  Jharkhand  Accelerated  Road  Development  Company  is  a \nspecial purpose vehicle, a joint venture between the state government and a private firm, \nestablished to develop 1,500 lane-km of state highways on a build\u2013operate\u2013transfer (annuity) \nbasis. The state government established Jharkhand State Rural Roads Development Authority \nas an autonomous single purpose agency to implement the 100% centrally sponsored rural road \nconnectivity program: Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (the national rural roads mission).  \n7.  SHAJ,  established  in  2007  in  accordance  with  the  State  Highways  Authority  of \nJharkhand Act 2007, has the broadest responsibilities covering the development, maintenance, \nand management of any state roads entrusted by the state government. While the government \nenvisaged that SHAJ would become independent of government funding within 3 years after its \nestablishment, it still functions as a semi-autonomous body fully relying on government funding \nunder RCD. The institutional setup is still in progress with all key personnel deputed from RCD. \nSHAJ requires hands-on external support for institutional development. The functioning of SHAJ \nwith a sound governance structure equipped with dedicated and technically capable staff will \ncontribute to sustainable state road development, ensuring appropriate road maintenance with \nclear accountability. The Jharkhand government intends to gradually shift the responsibility of \nstate  road  development  and  maintenance  to  SHAJ  from  RCD  as  SHAJ  strengthens  its \nimplementation capacity over time. \n8.  Appropriate  road  maintenance  with  adequate  budget  allocation  is  critical  for  a \nsustainable state road network. The state government has implemented five state road projects \nfor a total of 185 km, all under a build\u2013operate\u2013transfer (annuity) scheme, which include 15 \nyears  of  maintenance  by  the  contractor.  It  envisages  promoting  performance-based \nmaintenance contracts to ensure appropriate service for the road network. The maintenance \nbudget  allocation  is  prioritized  under  these  schemes  in  accordance  with  the  contractual \nrequirements. Mainstreaming these schemes will ensure sustainability of the road network. \n9.  Road safety is a concern. In 2012, Jharkhand had 2,119 road accidents/10,000 km, \nabout 72% higher than the national average of 1,227.5 Annual fatality rates along roads in \nJharkhand total 9/10,000 vehicles. While state and district road safety councils conduct road \nsafety awareness campaigns annually in accordance with national government initiatives to \npromote road safety, no state initiatives address road safety, either for road engineering or road \nuser  awareness.  Currently,  road  safety  audits  are  not  mandatory  for  road  engineering  in \nJharkhand; a nodal agency should be designated to promote road safety.  \n                                                \n5  Government of India, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. 2014.

In 2009, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided a loan to support improvement of \nstate roads in Jharkhand, with RCD as the executing agency.6 The project is financing the \nrehabilitation and improvement of 311 km of a state road to a two-lane standard. The road is in \nthe northern part of the state connecting to the NH2. All civil  works contracts have been \nawarded and the construction works are making good progress. The project also supports \nenhancing the skills of RCD officials. The management information system established under \nthe project is operating and facilitates project management and planning in RCD. In addition to \nthe standard covenants, the ongoing loan includes a covenant to establish a dedicated state \nroad fund. The Jharkhand State Road Development Fund Act was enacted in 2011, followed by \nthe Jharkhand State Road Development Fund Rules, 2012. Further, in February 2015, the state \ngovernment issued a notification in the official gazette setting the rate of local tax on fuel to be \nlevied and collected for the fund. \n11.  The sector assistance program evaluation of ADB\u2019s transport operations found that \nADB\u2019s strategic selection and priority areas of its involvement in the sector were significant and \nappropriate to the country\u2019s needs.7 The main weaknesses identified are poor project design \nand limited enforcement of safeguards. To overcome these weaknesses, the project has been \ndesigned to focus on improving executing agency performance in core functions, and providing \nassistance  during  project  preparation  and  implementation  to  address  issues  of  safeguard \ncompliance. \n12.  The project is consistent with the strategic objective set out in ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy, 2013\u20132017 for India on development of the state road network in lagging states; and \nthe transport sector objective of increased, more efficient, and sustainable movement of people \nand goods.8 The project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2013\u20132015 for \nIndia.9 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact will be improved mobility and accessibility. The outcome of the project will be \nimproved safety and efficiency of the road transport network in Jharkhand state. \nC.  Outputs \n14.  The physical output of the project will be about 176 km of state roads reconstructed or \nrehabilitated. The nonphysical output will be institutional capacity of SHAJ improved for key \naspects of road design, project implementation, maintenance, and safeguards. Performance-\nbased maintenance will be undertaken for 5 years after construction. An international standard \nroad safety master plan will be developed for SHAJ to act as the nodal agency for promoting \nroad safety in Jharkhand. \n \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2009.

Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The executing agency for the project will be the state government of Jharkhand acting \nthrough SHAJ. SHAJ will implement the project through its field offices at key locations, which \nwill be responsible for day-to-day project implementation and management, and will assign staff \nto work on the project. A full-time project manager will be assigned for each of the four contract \npackages.  The  project  managers  will  be  delegated  adequate  technical  and  administrative \nauthority for expeditious project implementation. A construction supervision consultant (CSC) \nwill  be  recruited  as  the  engineer  for  the  construction  contracts.  A  project  management \nconsultant (PMC) will be recruited for the capacity development of SHAJ. All procurement of \ngoods and works will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, \nas amended from time to time). All consultants will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \n19.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual (footnote 11). \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  March 2015\u2013December 2019 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2019 (30 June 2020)  \n(loan closing date) \nManagement \n(i)   Executing and  State  Government  of  Jharkhand,  acting  through  the  State  Highways \nimplementing agency  Authority of Jharkhand \n(ii)  Implementation unit  Three project implementation units will be set up to implement four road \nconstruction packages at Dumka, Giridih, and Ranchi.

ADB  approved  advance  contracting  of  civil  works  in  November  2014;  procurement \nactivities are ongoing. Based on this, the government requested retroactive financing for all \nproject components. Up to 20% of the loan proceeds will be eligible for retroactive financing, \nprovided that expenditures are incurred on works, equipment, and consulting services for the \nproject in accordance with agreed procedures and during the 12 months before the signing of \nthe  loan  agreement.  The  government  and  SHAJ  were  informed  that  approval  of  advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing does not in any way commit ADB to finance the project. \n \n ", "6 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n21.  The engineering designs were prepared to avoid or minimize land acquisition as well as \nsocial  and  environmental  impacts,  taking road  safety  into  account,  and  minimizing  climate \nchange risks. In addition, advance actions have been undertaken to ensure that construction \ncan commence early. All of these measures have improved project readiness and will mitigate \nthe risk of implementation delays. Road safety audits were conducted for all project roads at the \npreparation  stage.  The  construction  supervision  consultant  will  conduct  road  safety  audits \nduring and after project implementation. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  Economic evaluation. The evaluation followed the standard practice of comparing life-\ncycle road and user costs with and without the project, using the net present value with a 12% \ndiscount rate and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as decision criteria. The highway \ndevelopment and management system was used in the analysis, focusing on transport cost \nsavings. Value added from better transport links, resulting in new industries and employment, is \ncaptured through benefits from generated traffic. \n \n23.  The EIRR for the project roads is estimated as 16.9%. The sensitivity analysis indicates \nthat the project would remain economically viable in the event of (i) a 10% increase in capital \ncost, (ii) a 10% reduction in benefits, and (iii) a 1-year delay in construction. The results show \nthe quantified economic benefits are robust to various sensitivity tests. All selected roads have \nan EIRR above 12% for all sensitivity tests. In the unlikely event that both a 10% increase in \ncapital cost and a 10% reduction in benefits occur together, the EIRRs of the four project roads \nwould remain above the 12% benchmark. \n \n24.  Financial sustainability. Incremental recurrent costs associated with the project are \nestimated to be 1.2% of the current road maintenance budget of the state government. Periodic \nmaintenance costs of the project roads are estimated as 0.7% of the overall RCD budget in \nFY2014. Initial 5-year maintenance will be covered under the performance-based contract, \nwhich is budgeted as part of the state government\u2019s counterpart contribution. Thus, the state \ngovernment will likely be able to allocate sufficient budget to SHAJ to maintain the project roads. \n  \nC.  Governance \n25.  Institutional capacity. While the institutional setup of SHAJ is still in progress, RCD will \nfully support project implementation by providing key personnel, including the chief executive \nofficer, from RCD to SHAJ until adequate implementation capacity is established. The state \ngovernment  envisages strengthening  the  implementation  capacity  of SHAJ  and  developing \nSHAJ as a full autonomous body as envisioned in the State Highways Authority of Jharkhand \nAct 2007 through project execution. To support early achievement of the goal and ensure \nefficient project implementation, the project will provide hands-on support to SHAJ through the \nPMC to be recruited under the project for project implementation as well as overall institutional \ncapacity development. \n \n26.  Financial management. The financial management assessment concludes that the \noverall financial management risk is substantial and suggests mitigation measures. Despite \nbeing set up in 2007, SHAJ is still in its early stages of institutional development. Financial and \n ", "7 \naccounting activities are being conducted with minimal staff. Financial management practices \nrequire strengthening, including the development of a management information system and an \ninternal  control  mechanism.  However,  experience  under  the  ongoing  ADB-funded  project \nindicates  that  fund  flow  arrangements  are  reliable  and  predictable.  With  the  PMC  support \nprovided to SHAJ, the financial management arrangements are expected to be adequate.  \n  \n27.  Procurement. RCD has experience in procurement and consultant recruitment for an \nADB project, and will oversee the procurement activities of SHAJ. Goods and works will be \nprocured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. All civil works will be procured through \ninternational competitive bidding. All consulting firms will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants using quality- and cost-based selection, with a quality\u2013\ncost ratio of 90:10. SHAJ has prepared the bid documents following the agreed form of master \nbidding documents and commenced procurement of all four civil work packages as advance \nactions. The procurement plan for the project is in the project administration manual (footnote \n11). \n \n28.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  SHAJ.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n29.  The project\u2019s area of impact can be characterized by a predominance of traditional \nfarming and lack of adequate road connectivity, resulting in limited access to health care, \neducation institutions, commercial facilities, and government development agencies. More than \n300 households along the project roads were surveyed; they indicated that the poor road \nconditions  prevent  safe  and  reliable  travel,  especially  at  night  and  during  poor  weather. \nCommunities indicated that positive benefits will include (i) improved access to education and \nhealth  facilities,  (ii)  better  public  and  private  transport  options,  and  (iii)  increased  job \nopportunities. An efficient road network linking villages, towns, and cities will provide stronger \nlinks between rural regions and urban hubs. Road development encourages other development \ninitiatives,  which  together  considerably  stimulate  economic  growth.  The  improvements  are \nexpected to significantly improve the socioeconomic situation and enhance poverty reduction in \nthe beneficiary districts and the state as a whole. The project roads cover five districts where \napproximately 8.3 million people reside. The project is expected to generate approximately \n105,000 person-months of employment. \n \n30.  Gender. Women in the project areas are mainly involved in household work, cultivation, \nand other farming activities. During the nine women-only focus group discussions held during \nproject preparation, women indicated that improved road conditions would provide better access \nto health services, higher education, economic opportunities, and social interactions. Mitigation \nand proactive key actions for the project include (i) constructing more than 60 bus-stop shelters, \n50 km of raised sidewalks in urban areas, and 4 km of dedicated bicycle lanes, which will \nbenefit pedestrians, the elderly, women, and children; (ii) integrating road safety features for the \nelderly, women, children, and people with disabilities into road design such as proper signage, \nmarked crossings, and 4 km of road with solar-powered street lights; (iii) involving local women \nin additional compensatory afforestation where at least 20% of workers engaged are women; \nand (iv) encouraging civil works contractors to engage women workers as wage laborers and \nensuring equal pay for equal work. The CSC will monitor implementation. At the institutional \nlevel, the PMC will integrate socially inclusive practices into SHAJ operations. This includes \nmainstreaming gender issues into operations such as ensuring a woman-friendly workplace. \n ", "8 \n \nThe PMC will also build capacity of SHAJ staff to ensure social issues such as gender, labor, \nhealth, and trafficking are considered and implemented during design and construction of future \nprojects. \n \n31.

Based on an assessment by the National AIDS Control \nOrganization of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the State AIDS Prevention and \nControl Society, the project area of impact is identified as having low prevalence of HIV/AIDS. \nThe state government has set up the District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit to provide more \ntargeted  interventions  to  high-risk  groups,  and  an  integrated  and  augmented  system  of \nprevention, care, support, and treatment in the districts. Existing government initiatives and \nmitigating measures are in place to address all health and social risks and impacts associated \nwith  infrastructure  development  in  the  project  area.  Based  on  the  poverty  and  social \nassessment, the project will not increase HIV/AIDS incidence as all improved roads will be \nalong the existing corridor. SHAJ will ensure that civil works contractors conduct awareness \nprograms  on  HIV/AIDS,  human  trafficking,  and  child  labor  at  construction  camps  and \nworkplaces. All contracts will have clauses on these initiatives, and the state government will \nmonitor  compliance  during  implementation.  In  project-affected  villages,  awareness-raising \nactivities will be conducted for HIV/AIDS, basic hygiene, and human trafficking. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n32.  Environment. The project is categorized B for environment in accordance with ADB's \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Overall  no  significant,  irreversible,  diverse,  or \nunprecedented environmental impacts are expected. Adequate right-of-way is available for most \nproject roads. The project area does not include any protected areas. Elephant crossings exist \nalong  three  of the four  project roads. While  the  incremental  impacts from the  project  are \nassessed as minimal, additional measures to facilitate elephant movement, improve their habitat, \nand minimize collisions between elephants and human beings are included in the project. A \nconsolidated  initial  environmental  examination  report,  including  road-specific  environmental \nmanagement plans was prepared for the four project roads in accordance with the Safeguard \nPolicy Statement and was disclosed on the ADB website. Noise, pollution, and safety issues \nmay impact receptors adjacent to the roads during construction as well as during operation due \nto the increased traffic. Mitigation measures to address all construction and operation-related \nimpacts are included in the road-specific environmental management plans, which form part of \nthe bidding documents as a mandatory requirement for the contractor. Meaningful consultations \nwere  conducted  during  project  preparation  and  concerns  of  the  affected  persons  and \nstakeholders  were  incorporated  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  and  environmental \nmanagement plans. The member (administration) of SHAJ will serve as the overall coordinator \nof safeguards. At the project implementation unit, a dedicated safeguards focal person will \noversee  implementation  of  safeguards  in  the  field.  The  CSC  will  include  an  environment \nspecialist  to  support  SHAJ  in  monitoring  environment  safeguards.  ADB  and  the  PMC  will \nconduct  an  initial  coordination  and  training  workshop  for  SHAJ  staff,  the  CSC,  and  the \ncontractors  during  the  preconstruction  stage.  Further  training  will  be  conducted  during \nconstruction as necessary. \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement. The project is categorized A for involuntary resettlement in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The four project roads are designed to \nminimize the need for land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. Four resettlement plans \nwere prepared. About 63 hectares of private land will be acquired at replacement cost. Some \n4,024 households will be affected, occupying 2,377 structures. A total of 3,056 households will \nexperience  physical  displacement,  and  1,203  households  will  experience  economic \n ", "9 \ndisplacement. The resettlement plans are in compliance with The Right to Fair Compensation \nand Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation, and Resettlement Act (2013) and ADB's \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The displaced households will be entitled to compensation for the \nloss of land and structures at replacement cost, shifting cost, and other income restoration \nassistance. Resettlement cost is estimated at about $27.3 million. SHAJ will appoint an overall \ncoordinator  of safeguards.  At  the  project  implementation  unit,  a  dedicated  safeguard focal \nperson will oversee implementation of safeguards in the field. Experienced nongovernment \norganizations  and  a  CSC  resettlement  specialist  will  support  implementation  of  involuntary \nresettlement and safeguard monitoring by SHAJ. The PMC will include a resettlement specialist \nto improve SHAJ capacity for social safeguards. \n \n34.  Indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  categorized  C  for  indigenous  peoples,  as  \n307 indigenous peoples\u2019 households will be impacted by involuntary resettlement. The census \nfound that these households are not distinctive because they are integrated with the dominant \npopulation of the project area. Tribal groups in the subproject areas freely interact with the \noutside community. These groups have nuclear families and are open to new ideas like family \nplanning and formal education. Social impact assessments confirm that the socioeconomic \nimpacts caused by the four project roads will not be different for these people than for the \nremainder of the population. An in-depth analysis of the magnitude of the resettlement impact \nthat will be experienced by indigenous peoples\u2019 households is included in a special chapter of \nthe resettlement plans. Adequate compensation and assistance provisions are in place. The \nCSC will closely monitor implementation of project activities related to indigenous peoples. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n35.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.12 The integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWeak public  The PMC will support strengthened financial management operations of SHAJ during \nfinancial  project implementation by (i) installing enterprise resource  planning software \nmanagement  integrated with financial management, and (ii) preparing a financial management \nmanual to reflect accounting policies and procedures and internal control mechanisms \ncommensurate with the size and scale of SHAJ. \nWeak safeguard  The project roads were selected as having the minimum social and environmental \nimplementation  impacts through the PPTA process undertaking all engineering measures and \nconsultation. The CSC and PMC will provide support during project implementation. \nUnsustainable  A 5-year performance-based maintenance contract will be procured covering the four \noperations  and  project roads. The PMC will support SHAJ in carrying out procurement for the contract, \nmaintenance  and support development of a road asset management system for SHAJ.
