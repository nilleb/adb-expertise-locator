THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nNepal for the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program (CARES Program), \nunder the Countercyclical Support Facility COVID-19 pandemic response option (CPRO).1 \n  \n2.  The CARES Program will help the government in implementing its pandemic response \nplan\u2014the National Relief Program\u2014to respond to public health emergencies and to mitigate \nadverse economic and social impacts caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. \nThe National Relief Program, approved on 29 March 2020, includes medical and health support, \nsocial protection for the poor and vulnerable, economic support for affected sectors, and other \nfiscal and economic measures.2 Nepal meets all the CPRO access criteria (Table 1) and the \ndetailed justifications are in Appendix 4. \n  \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria for the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \nCPRO Access Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \n1. Adverse impact of  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe sudden disruptions to the economy. It is \nexogenous shocks   projected to lead to economic loss of $2.3 billion or 7.1% of GDP in FY2020 and \nFY2021. ADB projected 6.3% GDP growth for FY2020 before the pandemic; however, \nthe official GDP growth is estimated to decline to 2.3%.  With rising health and economic \nrelief measures, the FY2020 fiscal deficit is projected to widen from the pre-pandemic \nestimate of 6.4% of GDP to 8.5% of GDP. ADB estimates that the economy may lose \nabout 4.7% of total employment or 997,000 jobs for FY2020\u2013FY2021.a The IMF\u2019s May \n2020 report on the Rapid Credit Facility projects Nepal\u2019s GDP growth to be 1.0% in \nFY2020 and 3.5% in FY2021.b \n2. Countercyclical  On 29 March 2020, the government approved the National Relief Program, consisting \ndevelopment  of (i) health and medical support, (ii) social protection for the poor and vulnerable, and \nexpenditures  (iii)  economic  support  for  affected  sectors.  The  government\u2019s  countercyclical \ndevelopment expenditure program is estimated to cost about $1.26 billion for FY2020, \nof which: (i) $347 million for health and medical support, (ii) $359 million for social \nprotection for the poor and vulnerable, and (iii) $555 million for economic support for \naffected sectors. \n3. Pre-shock record of  Nepal\u2019s macroeconomic management has been generally sound with fast growth and \ngenerally sound  benign inflation. GDP growth averaged 7.3% during FY2017\u2013FY2019. Inflation declined \nmacroeconomic  steadily from a peak of 9.9% in FY2016 to 6.5% in the first 8 months of FY2020. The \nmanagement  fiscal deficit moderated to 5.1% of GDP in FY2019, down from 6.6% in FY2018. Gross \nforeign exchange reserves were adequate at $9.5 billion at the end of FY2019, enough \nto cover 7.8 months of imports, in FY2019. With an average revenue\u2013GDP ratio of \n23.8% from FY2017 to FY2019, the revenue mobilization, excluding foreign grants, has \nbeen robust.  \n4. Structural reforms  As part of the pandemic response, the government has begun structural reforms to \nenhance public sector resilience to emergencies, especially in the health sector. MOHP \ndeveloped the Health Sector Emergency Response Plan: COVID-19 Pandemic to \ndevelop detailed institutional mechanisms and interventions to be adopted during a \npandemic.c The government also incorporated finance sector structural reforms to \nenable the regulatory authorities and financial institutions to maintain the sector\u2019s \nliquidity and stability during emergencies.   \n5. Debt sustainability  Nepal\u2019s public debt remains lower than other low-income countries and a net external \ncreditor. ADB\u2019s debt sustainability assessment finds that from 30.1% of GDP in FY2019, \nthe pandemic increases the debt-to-GDP ratio to 39.0% in FY2020 and 43.4% in \nFY2021 as growth dips and the primary balance worsens to fight the pandemic and \nsupport recovery. As growth picks up, public debt will continue to rise at a slower pace \nand reach 48.5% in FY2025. Approved and proposed COVID-19 response assistances \n \n1  ADB. 2020. Policy Paper.

PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Coronavirus disease and initial government response. The first case of COVID-19 \nwas identified in Nepal on 24 January 2020. Since then, the government initiated various \ncontainment  measures  including  procuring  essential  supplies,  equipment,  and  medicine; \nupgrading health infrastructure; training medical personnel; and spreading public awareness. \nOther measures included prohibiting promotional activities or events, canceling on-arrival visas, \nsuspending the issuance of migrant workers\u2019 work permits, suspending school classes and \nexaminations, canceling all international flights, and postponing the National Assembly. On \n24 March 2020, a nationwide lockdown came into effect. \n \n4.  On  8 May  2020,  Nepal  had  107 confirmed  cases,  with  no  deaths  recorded. It  has \nconducted about 15,492 swab tests and quarantined about 20,217 people. Although the number \nof confirmed cases is still small, Nepal is considered a high-risk country for rapid spread of \nCOVID-19 infections because of its vulnerable public health system, underdeveloped sanitation \nand  other  infrastructure,  and  densely  populated  urban  and  semi-urban  areas.  Further,  a \nsubstantial number of Nepali migrant workers are returning from affected countries. As of 8 May \n2020, 20,217 migrant workers returned to Nepal. Without urgent and effective containment \nmeasures, Nepal\u2019s risk of rapidly spreading the infection is high. As a landlocked country that is \nhighly dependent on imports, Nepal also recognizes regional cooperation to be crucial in ensuring \na coordinated response to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, and maintain open access and \nuninterrupted supply links. It has signed the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation \n(SAARC) COVID-19 response joint plan, which calls for countries in the region to work together \nto implement containment and surveillance measures. In addition, Nepal pledged $1 million to the \nSAARC COVID-19 Emergency Fund.  \n \n ", "3 \n5.  Government\u2019s public health forecasts and health system status. In April 2020, under \nthe framework of the National Relief Program, the government released the Health Sector \nEmergency Response Plan: COVID-19 Pandemic.3 The plan was further revised in May 2020. \nThe plan\u2019s objective is to prepare and strengthen the response of the health system to minimize \nthe pandemic\u2019s health impact. It presents four scenarios based on COVID-19 positive case load \nincluding: (i) a maximum number of positive cases under 2,000; (ii) a maximum number of positive \ncases between 2,000 and 5,000; (iii) a maximum number of positive cases between 5,000 and \n10,000; and (iv) a maximum number of positive cases greater than 10,000.4 Each of these levels \nfurther segregates cases into three levels of severity assuming that 80% of cases would need \ngeneral treatment at the hospital with isolation ward and beds, 15% would need hospitalization \nwith oxygen support and only 5% would need intensive care unit (ICU) services. The plan \nprescribes strategic approaches and key interventions for (i) health systems, (ii) public health and \nsocial measures, (iii) curative care interventions, and (iv) strengthened management for COVID-\n19 response.5 To meet the plan\u2019s requirements, Nepal\u2019s health system requires significant \nupscaling and expansion, especially for the number of quarantine, isolation, hospital and ICU \nbeds (Table 2).6 Additionally, Nepal has a lower polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing rate at \n0.56 per thousand population when compared to other neighboring countries such as India at \n1.10, Bhutan at 3.21, and Bangladesh at 0.71.7 Summary of cross country comparison of COVID-\n19 related data is also included in Appendix 2.8  \n \nTable 2: Nepal\u2019s Health System Response Capacity for COVID-19 \nItem  Quarantine  Isolation  Hospital  ICU Beds  Physicians \nBeds  Beds   Beds with  (severe \nOxygen  cases) \nSupport  \nTotal available (as of  49,334  3,097  26,930  1,595  3,500 \n30 April 2020) \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, ICU = intensive care unit. \nSource: Government of Nepal, Ministry of Health and Population. 2020.

Before the pandemic, Nepal\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth averaged 7.3% during FY2017\u2013FY2019. Growth increased from 6.7% in \nFY2018 to 7.1% in FY2019 mainly because of accelerated post-earthquake reconstruction, \nsteady remittance inflows, higher agriculture production, and improved electricity supply. Inflation \ndeclined steadily from a peak of 9.9% in FY2016 to 6.5% in the first 8 months of FY2020. The \nfiscal deficit moderated to 5.1% of GDP in FY2019, after increasing to 6.6% in FY2018, based on \nlower-than-planned capital expenditures. The current account deficit narrowed from 8.2% of GDP \n \n3  Government of Nepal, Ministry of Health and Population. 2020. The Health Sector Emergency Response Plan: \nCOVID-19 Pandemic. Kathmandu. \n4  The plan would be periodically revised based on positive case load in close collaboration with the World Health \nOrganization (WHO) and other partners. \n5  The government is closely monitoring the case load and adjusting its response outlined within the plan accordingly. \n6  Sector Assessment (Summary): Health and Social Protection (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). Nepal\u2019s overall health system capacity is weak to control the pandemic under the outlined scenarios. \nThe country has a shortage of medical staff, facilities, and equipment. It has 6.5 doctors per 10,000 people, 2.7 \nnurses and midwives per 1,000 population, and 0.3 beds per 1,000 people. Nepal\u2019s health care system also lacks \nkey equipment necessary for the pandemic response, such as personal protective equipment for health professionals \nand frontline health workers, and enough ventilators to effectively respond.  \n7  Country comparison for testing rate for number of Covid-19 tests per thousand population.

Gross foreign exchange reserves were $9.5 billion in \nFY2019, enough to cover 7.8 months of imports, in FY2019. With an average revenue\u2013GDP ratio \nof 23.8% from FY2017 to FY2019, the revenue mobilization, excluding foreign grants, has been \nrobust.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  Article  IV  consultation,  which  concluded  in \nFebruary 2020, confirmed that Nepal had seen strong growth and significant poverty reduction, \nand projected it to grow at 6.0% in FY2020.9 \n  \n7.  Economic  impact  of the  pandemic.  The  pandemic  has  caused  serious  economic \ndisruption,  affecting  segments  such  as  services,  tourism,  transport,  construction,  and \nmanufacturing. International travel bans and global lockdowns severely impacted on tourism \nrevenue and remittance inflows of Nepal. Contributing about a quarter of GDP and the most \nimportant foreign exchange source, a significant fall in remittance income would lead to falling \ndomestic  consumption,  imports  of  goods  and  services,  and  government  revenues.  The \npreliminary estimates from the Central Bureau of Statistics in Nepal show that GDP growth will \nsignificantly  decline  to  2.3%  in  FY2020  (Figure  1:  Gross  Domestic  Product  Growth  Rate \nFY2020).10 ADB\u2019s GDP growth projection for FY2020 was 6.3% before the pandemic. If the \npandemic and containment measures are assumed to last from mid-March to mid-October 2020 \nfor 7 months, the economy could lose remittance inflows of about 3.6% of GDP. Based on ADB\u2019s \nGDP growth projection, GDP growth would continue to decline to 3.3% from the projected GDP \ngrowth of 6.4% in FY2021. With rising health and economic relief measures due to the COVID-\n19 pandemic, the fiscal deficit will widen from the pre-COVID-19 estimate of 6.4% of GDP to 8.5% \n \nin FY2020 (Table 3). \n  \nTable 3: Provisional Fiscal Position with COVID-19 Impact \n   FY2020 \nMid-year Budget \nIndicator  Projection a \nReview \n   ($ million)  ($ million) \nA.

Loans to micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) totaled 10.85%.11 \nThe portfolio performance of loans to the service industries and MSMEs is expected to deteriorate \ndue to the business disruptions caused by the pandemic. The banking nonperforming loan (NPL) \nratio worsened from an NPL ratio of 1.74% in December 2019 to 1.77% in March 2020. Similarly, \nthe finance sector\u2019s capital adequacy ratio deteriorated from 14.19% in December 2019 to 13.97% \nin March 2020.12 The pandemic has also adversely affected the liquidity of the finance system, \nwhich  will  lead  to  limited  access  to  finance  for  the  private  sector,  in  particular  MSMEs. \nRemittances, which grew by 3.61% in FY2019, declined by 50.7% in April 2020 compared with \nApril 2019\u2014falling for the first time since the earthquake in 2015.13 \n \n9.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionate \nimpacts  on  the  poor,  informal  sector  workers,  migrant  workers,  households  depending  on \nremittances, and women. With the economic disruption caused by the pandemic, vulnerable \nindividuals, including those who are just above the poverty line, are likely to be pushed below the \npoverty line. Also, Nepal\u2019s estimated poverty headcount ratios are 3.9% at $1.90 a day, 27.6% at \n$3.20 a day, and 65.1% at $5.50 a day for FY2020.14 The adverse impacts of the pandemic are \n \n11 Loans to MSMEs refer to loans of less than NRs1 million. \n12  Nepal Rastra Bank. 2020.

Nepal\u2019s poverty is partly related to the large segment of the population who are employed \nin the informal sector. Informal sector employment accounts for 84.6% of total employment.15 \nInformal sector workers are not entitled to sick pay or health insurance, and are ineligible for social \nsecurity benefits. Women are likely to be most affected, as they comprise 66.5% of informal sector \nworkers in Nepal, and the lockdown has increased their household and care work. Returnee \nmigrant workers are anticipated to remain unemployed because of the pandemic\u2019s adverse impact \non the domestic economy and employment market. Migrant workers comprise about 12% women \nand several historically disadvantaged groups\u2014the Adivasi Janajati (indigenous groups), Hill \nDalits (lowest caste), other Madheshi (inhabitants of the Terai) castes, Terai Janajatis, and \nMadheshi Dalits.16 The decline in remittances, which is a critical source of income for many Nepali \nhouseholds, exacerbated by unpaid care work, reinforces the burden on women as the primary \nfamily caregiver. Moreover, the imposition of home quarantine poses a higher risk of violence \nagainst women and inhibits timely interventions to gender-based violence. Since women comprise \n70% of public sector health workers including frontline personnel, they face an unprecedented \nworkload in overstretched health facilities. In addition, 51,420 female community health volunteers \nwho support basic health services for the government\u2019s National Relief Program, forming an \nintegral part of the health care system, are at increased risk of infection.17  \n \n11.  Government\u2019s  countercyclical  expenditure  program.  The  government\u2019s \ncountercyclical development expenditure program is estimated to cost about $1.26 billion for \nFY2020: (i) $347 million for health and medical support, (ii) $359 million for social protection for \nthe poor and vulnerable, and (iii) $555 million for economic support for affected sectors. The \nprogram\u2019s key objective is to control the pandemic and mitigate the pandemic\u2019s adverse impacts \non livelihood and employment, especially for the poor and vulnerable including women. The \nprogram\u2019s health and medical support key areas include (i) building additional quarantine and \nhospital bed capacity, (ii) scaling up critical care bed capacity, (iii) introducing health insurance \nscheme for medical personnel, and (iv) providing additional financial incentives to medical and \nhealth  personnel.  The  social  protection  component\u2019s  key  areas  include  (i)  mapping  and \nregistration of the poor and vulnerable people, (ii) food distribution to the poor and disadvantaged \npeople, and (iii) extending employment support to informal sector workers and returnee migrant \nworkers. The economic support component focuses on providing a refinancing facility for affected \nsmall-  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  and  returnee  migrant  workers  and  potential  migrant \nworkers who could not depart due to the pandemic situations in host countries.  \n \n12.  Government\u2019s countercyclical expenditure program - activities and institutional \narrangements. On 1 March 2020, the government formed the High-level Coordination Committee \nfor the Prevention and Control of COVID-19 (COVID-19 High-Level Committee), led by the deputy \nprime minister, and participated by the Ministers of (i) Home Affairs; (ii) Culture, Tourism, and Civil \nAviation; (iii) Finance; and (iv) Health and Population.

Development  coordination.  The  CARES  Program  has  been  prepared  in  close \ncoordination with the IMF, and takes into consideration the IMF\u2019s views on Nepal\u2019s economic \ngrowth and debt sustainability in a pre- and post-COVID-19 scenario.18 ADB ensures coordination \nand complementarity with the IMF and the World Bank in supporting the government\u2019s National \nRelief Program. Specifically, the IMF\u2019s support focuses on balance of payment support with \ncontinued structural reforms for financial sector and fiscal stability. The World Bank\u2019s support \ncenters on strengthening public health sector and medical capacity and inclusive social protection. \nADB\u2019s CARES Program focuses on social protection for the poor and vulnerable and economic \nsupport especially for affected MSMEs. ADB also coordinates bilaterally with the World Bank on \nsupport  to  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Employment  Program,  which  as  part  of  the  government\u2019s \ncountercyclical expenditure program, will provide employment to unemployed people. ADB also \ncoordinates with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the IMF and the World Bank \nthrough the framework of the Advisory Committee, through which ADB, AIIB, the World Bank, and \nIMF participate as an advisor. On health and social protection support, ADB coordinates with \ndevelopment partners through the International Development Partner Group health and social \nprotection working groups. The key development partners\u2019 confirmed support to the government\u2019s \nCOVID-19 response is in Table 5. 19   \n  \nTable 5: Key Development Partners\u2019 COVID-19 Response Supporta \nDevelopment Partner  Project or Type of Support  Amount \n($ million) \nIDPGb  Health and Social Protection Support  10.9 \nIMF  Rapid Credit Facilityc  214.0 \nThe World Bank  COVID-19  Emergency  Response  and  Health  System  29.0 \nPreparedness Projectd \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, IDPG = the International Development Partner Group, IMF = International \nMonetary Fund. \na  The table shows the approved support, as of 8 May 2020. \nb  The health sector group comprises the BMZ, GIZ, Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, Global Fund \nto Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, Japan International Cooperation Agency, KfW, Korea International \nCooperation Agency, United Kingdom through Department for International Development (DFID), United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund, International Organization for Migration, the United \nStates Agency for International Development (USAID), World Bank, and WHO.

Alignment  with  ADB  Strategy  2030.  The  CARES  Program  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030, including operational priorities on addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities, accelerating progress in gender equality, strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity, and fostering regional integration and cooperation.20 The program will support the \nGovernment to mitigate the severe social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nSpecifically, the program will assist government to extend support to the poor and vulnerable to \nwithstand the pandemic\u2019s adverse impact on their livelihoods through food assistance and \nemployment support. It will pay special attention to establishing gender-segregated hospital units \nand facilities, and ensuring that additional incentives are extended to women health workers. \nFurther, the program will increase women\u2019s resilience to the pandemic\u2019s economic shocks. It will \npromote resilience to external shocks and strengthen public service delivery, especially in the \nhealth sector, contributing to a reduction in shared health risks. The program facilitates the \ngovernment\u2019s mapping of the poor and vulnerable populations for effective food distribution and \nother relief service delivery. For enhanced regional integration and cooperation, the program\u2019s \nsupport to the government\u2019s economic response measures, especially financing MSMEs, will \naccelerate the recovery of an export-oriented manufacturing as well as tourism sector. The \nprogram complements efforts by SAARC and the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation \nto ensure coordinated responses to mitigate the impact of the pandemic in the region and facilitate \nthe recovery process. \n \nB.  Proposed Program and ADB\u2019s Value Addition  \n \n17.  Proposed  program.  The  proposed  program  is  aligned  with  Nepal\u2019s  development \nobjective:  disaster  risks  in  human  lives,  livelihoods,  health,  economy,  and  social  aspects \nsustainably  reduced.21 The  program  will  have  the  following  outcome:  COVID-19  pandemic \nadverse impacts on health systems, livelihoods, poverty, employment, and economy mitigated. \nThe  program  will  support  the  government\u2019s  countercyclical  expenditure  program,  with  the \nfollowing focus on the support to the poor, vulnerable and women:  \n \n(i)  Health and medical support: (a) increasing testing capacity to at least 3,000 tests \nper day; (b) setting up quarantine space for at least 200,000 people with separate \nwards for women and men in all seven provinces; and (c) providing incentives to \nat least 70,000 health and frontline personnel responding to COVID-19, of whom \nat least 70% are women.22 \n \n(ii)  Social protection for the poor and vulnerable: (a) distributing food assistance \nto 1 million poor and vulnerable households; and (b) providing employment support \nthrough the Prime Minister\u2019s Employment Program to at least 500,000 unemployed \npeople,  comprising  at  least  50%  women  (including  women  returnee  migrant \n \n20 ADB. 2018.

ADB\u2019s value addition is threefold: (i) providing advisory and technical support for the \nNational Relief Program implementation, (ii) contributing to the government\u2019s COVID-19 response \nthrough parallel projects, and (iii) engaging in the medium-term recovery. ADB will provide policy \nadvice on the National Relief Program implementation by participating in the Advisory Committee \nas an advisor. ADB will also support the government by developing the government agencies\u2019 \nprogram implementation capacity, especially on targeting, progress reporting and monitoring, \nthrough  the  existing  ADB  TA  (footnote  24).  The  TA\u2019s  original  objective  is  to  improve  the \ngovernment\u2019s overall project implementation capacity especially on environmental and safeguard \ncompliance, contract management, financial management, and project management to critical \nADB projects. For the CARES Program, the TA will be expanded with an additional financing of \n$800,000 for the government agencies\u2019 sustainable public sector capacity development and pro-\npoor service delivery.26 \n \n19.  In addition to the proposed program, ADB\u2019s support for the government\u2019s COVID-19 \nresponse includes (i) the Rural Enterprise Financing Project, (ii) the Food Safety and Agriculture \nCommercialization Program, and (iii) Regional Support to Address the Outbreak of Coronavirus \n \n23 The Food Assistance Program is likely to reach at least 2 million women and girls, based on the assumption of two \nfemale members per household. As per the government issued guidelines, each family (of more than 2 members) \nshould be provided with rice (30 kg), lentils (3 kg), salt (2 packets), oil (2 L), soap (4 bars), and sugar (2 kg). The \nguidelines for food distribution outline (i) beneficiary eligibility; (ii) the quantity of relief materials; (iii) implementation \narrangements; and (iv) reporting requirements, including reporting templates. Local government ward offices identify \nthe households eligible for support through self-registration or by reaching out to vulnerable groups. The final list of \neligible households will be prepared after the necessary verification, including site visits by ward officials and \nendorsement by homeowners. Local government ward offices keep the household records, local government offices \ncollect the household records and submit to the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration.  \n24 ADB. 2019.

The types of employment support are mostly short-term employment under public \ncivil works. \n25 The concessional loan\u2019s terms and conditions are yet to be determined. ADB will provide support to Nepal Rastra \nBank (NRB) in developing the concessional loan\u2019s terms and conditions, and implementation procedures at the \nprogram inception. ADB will provide implementation support to the NRB in connection with the Rural Enterprise \nFinancing Project (para. 18). \n26 The TA Technical Assistance to Nepal for Portfolio Management and Capacity Development for Enhanced Portfolio \nPerformance (footnote 24) provides demand-led capacity development programs and improves the quality of projects \nand program. The TA\u2019s outputs are output 1: capacity development of executing and implementing agencies \nincreased; output 2: cross-learning in between projects supported; and output 3: portfolio management improved. \nThe additional financing to the TA will support the executing and implementing agencies of the Nepal Relief Program \nin managing, monitoring and reporting on the CARES Program. Especially, the TA assistance will strengthen the \nquality of progress reporting, targeting, monitoring; and provide implementation and policy advise. The additional \nconsultant inputs are required for (i) an international and a national governance specialist; (ii) two national social \ndevelopment specialists; (iii) a national data analyst and survey specialist; (iv) a national financial management \nspecialist; and (v) a national economist. \n ", "11 \nDisease 2019 and Potential Outbreaks of Other Communicable Diseases. 27 The Rural Enterprise \nFinancing Project, approved in November 2019, will finance micro and small enterprises for rural \nemployment  generation  and  poverty  reduction. 28  The  Food  Safety  and  Agriculture \nCommercialization Program, approved in October 2019, provides a budgetary support for reforms \nto improve food safety and quality monitoring systems; and strengthen institutional capacity, \nparticularly in subnational governments.29 ADB also provided assistance for the procurement of \nessential health equipment under regional TA (footnote 27).  \n \n20.  For the medium-term recovery engagement, ADB will continue to support affected private \nsector enterprises. ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations will support access to finance for priority \nsectors, including agriculture, tourism, and small and cottage industries. ADB will also continue \nsupporting  the  government  in  developing  essential  basic  infrastructure,  including  electricity \ngeneration, transmission and distribution networks, transport and roads, urban infrastructure, \nwater supply and sanitation, trade, and agribusiness facilities. ADB plans to provide a policy-\nbased loan for supporting reforms to strengthen subnational level service delivery in 2021. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Program \n \n21.   The program will provide a critical budgetary support for the government to implement the \nNational Relief Program. The National Relief Program will result in (i) upscaling and expansion of \nthe health system to control the pandemic\u2019s spread; (ii) protecting livelihoods and food security of \nthe poor and vulnerable groups; and (iii) mitigating the pandemic\u2019s impacts on the economy \nespecially for MSMEs. The first area of impact will be measured in the containment of COVID-19 \npositive cases below 10,000 by July 2022, according to the Health Sector Emergency Response \nPlan: COVID-19 Pandemic (footnote 3). The second impact area will be assessed in food insecure \npopulation below 4.6 million in July 2022. The third impact areas will be expressed as over 90% \nof MSMEs that received the concessional loans will remain operational in July 2022. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n22.  The  government  estimates  additional  financing  requirements  for  the  National  Relief \nProgram  of  $1.26  billion  in  FY2020  because  of  the  decrease  in  revenue  and  increased \nexpenditure  for  the  COVID-19  response.  It  is  mobilizing  additional  domestic  resources  of \napproximately  $418  million  from  budget  savings,  provincial  and  local  governments,  the \ngovernment\u2019s regulatory and other agencies, and private contributions (Table 6).

The government has requested a concessional loan of $250 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.30 The \ngovernment\u2019s development policy letter is in Appendix 3.  \n  \n24.  Debt sustainability. Nepal\u2019s public debt remains lower than other low-income countries \nand a net external creditor. Under the ADB baseline, the public debt to GDP ratio is projected to \nincrease over the projection period but will remain below 50% by FY2025. ADB\u2019s assessment \nfinds that from 30.1% of GDP in FY2019, the pandemic increases the debt-to-GDP ratio to 39.0% \nin FY2020 and 43.4% in FY2021 as growth dips and the primary balance worsens to fight the \npandemic and support recovery. The projected debt path is slightly higher (1 percentage point) \nthan the baseline considered under the IMF\u2019s Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) approved on 6 May \n2020, primarily due to a higher primary deficit assumption in FY2020. For instance, in FY2020 \nalone, the increase in the public debt GDP ratio of 8.9% of GDP is mainly due to the high primary \ndeficit of 7.9%. Nepal\u2019s public-debt to GDP ratio will stabilize when the primary deficit is at 3.5% \nof GDP. Further, while the IMF baseline includes COVID-19 response from key development \npartners namely ADB (proposed $250 million), IMF ($214 million already approved), and the \nWorld Bank ($29 million approved in FY2020), ADB\u2019s baseline includes additional support from \nWorld Bank ($250 million likely to be effective in FY2021) and AIIB ($100 million proposed in \nFY2021). These multilateral loans are about 1.6% of GDP in FY2020 and 1% in FY2021.  \n \n25.   Risks to Nepal\u2019s debt sustainability remain contained. Main risks include low growth and \nhigh primary deficits. A slowing Indian economy and sluggish remittances are likely to slow \nNepal\u2019s growth. A negative growth shock, with GDP growth 1.1 percentage points below the \nbaseline in the first two years along with corresponding falls in nominal growth, is likely to increase \nthe debt-to-GDP ratio at a faster pace reaching a peak of 49.3% in FY2025. A primary balance \nshock with the primary deficit 1.4 percentage points above the baseline in the first two years of \n \n30 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "13 \nprojection, will elevate debt levels to 50.5% in FY2025. The two shocks combined will push the \ndebt to GDP ratio further higher, crossing the 50% threshold earlier in FY2024 and reaching \n51.3% in FY2025. The IMF\u2019s latest assessment under the RCF confirmed that even under the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, Nepal\u2019s debt is assessed to remain at a low risk of external and overall debt \ndistress. However, a deeper global slowdown could negatively affect the risk of debt distress.   \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n26.  The MOF will serve as the executing agency (EA). The EA will coordinate with the \nimplementing agencies (IAs) and ensure that they achieve the program\u2019s output targets.  \n \n27.  The IAs will be the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development; the MOHP; the \nMinistry of Federal Affairs and General Administration; the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and \nSupplies;  the  Ministry  of  Labour,  Employment  and  Social  Security;  and  the  NRB.  The \nimplementing agencies will (i) implement the respective National Relief Program actions; (ii) \ncoordinate with local governments, provide implementation guidance, and conduct monitoring \nand supervision; (iii) submit semiannual progress updates and report any implementation issues \nto the EA; and (iv) respond to information requests by the EA. \n \n28.  The  COVID-19  High-Level  Committee  will  act  as  the  CARES  Program\u2019s  steering \ncommittee and provide policy level guidance to the EA. The Advisory Committee, under the \noversight and guidance of the COVID-19 High-Level Committee, will conduct an integrated \nassessment of COVID-19 impacts, identify the IAs\u2019 funding gaps in the implementation of the \nCOVID-19 response plan; and advise on funding requirements and resource mobilization.  \n \n29.  The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time).

This development policy\nletter affirms our request to obtain $250 million from the COVID-1g Active Response\nExpenditure Support (CARES) Program under ADB's Countercyclical Support Facility: COVID-\n19 Pandemic Response Option (CPRO).\nSince the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in January 2020, the World Health Organization\nhas reported more than 3.6 million confirmed cases, with nearly 250,000 deaths worldwide, so\nfar. As of 7 May 2020, Nepal has 101 confirmed cases, with no death recorded. Of the\nconfirmed cases, 22 individuals have been treated successfully. Nepal has conducted\napproximately 14,500 swab tests and more than 22,000 individuals have been kept in\nquarantine. The government has declared a full-scale national lockdown which is in place since\nMarch 24,2020. There is also a restriction on cross-border movement of people.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted lives and livelihood of the Nepali people.\nThe pandemic has led to urgent needs in the health sector. The poor and vulnerable groups are\ndisproportionately affected, with several businesses either shut already or in a crisis. Prior to the\noutbreak, the economy had been growing atan average of 7.0o/o during FY2017 and FY2019.\nThe early estimates show that the real output growth in F/Y 2019120 will decline by 2 to 4\npercent in compare to pre COVID outlook, with possible impact extending into the next fiscal\nyear depending on the severity of the pandemic and the time for resumption to normality.\nCustoms revenue collection has significantly decreased, while the fiscal deficit is expected to\nwiden by 2.7To 9f GpP and immediate fiscal financing need is about 2.6% of GDP\n(Approximately $ 817 million). Remittance inflow in this year is expected to decline by about 3%\nof GDP, as the potential migrants are held up and job losses are expected in destination\ncountries.\nTo address the impact of the pandemic, on 29 March 2020, the government announced a\nNational Relief Program, which covers 3 components: (i) health and medical support, (ii) social\nprotection for the poor and vulnerable, and (iii) economic support for affected sectors. To\nimplement the National Relief Program, the government issued the Relief Program Action\nlmplementation Plan on 3'1 March 2020.1n this action plan, the government identified for each\nof the individual interventions a responsible sector ministry or agency. Overall monitoring of the\naction plan is the responsibility of the Officerof the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers, and\nTel: Minister 4211809, Secretary 4211332,lnternational Economic Cooperation Coordination Division 4211372,4211867\nFax N o. 42111 64, 4211'1 65, Webs ite : www m of . g ov. n p", "f Nepal  *\nGovern\neFI NANCE \nMINIST :s,ff=e.\nrfltiflffiffi,tag\n'\"\" \n2020.Jp..,'n\".\"\nSINGHADURBAR\nKATHMANDU, NEPAL\nMinistry of Finance (MOF). The government also issued the Standard for Relief Programs for\nthe lnformal Sector Worker and the Helpless on 1 April 2020 to provide clear instructions to the\ndifferent agencies how the relief packages should reach the poor and vulnerable.\nThe tentative cost for the government's National Relief Program for FY2020 is estimated at\n$1.26 billion, with (i) $347 million for the medical and health response, (ii) $SSg million for the\nsocial protection for the poor and vulnerable, and (iii) $555 for the economic support for the\naffected sectors. The expected results for each component are summarized as follows.\ni)  National Relief Program - health and medical support (component 1). As per the\nproposed Health Sector Emergency Response Plan: COVID-19 Pandemic, which benefitted\nfrom the advice of the World Health Organization office in Nepal, the government has\nestablished coordination mechanisms between different levels of government structures to\neffectively engage; enhanced testing capacity, expanded the quarantine and isolation bed\ncapacities; increased intensive care unit (lCU) bed capacity and available human resources;\nimproved risk communication and community engagement interventions; and strengthened case\ninvestigation, contact tracing and increased surveillance. The government aims to strengthen\nthe health system by August 2020 as per the following three targets. The first target is to\nincrease the testing capacity of the medical system to at least 3,000 tests per day from the 500\ntest per day capacity as of end of April 2020. The second target is to set up quarantine space\nfor at least 200,000 people with separate wards for women and men in all 7 provinces from\ncapacity available tor 49,334 people as of 30 April 2020. The government has issued separate\nquarantine guidelines to ensure minimum quality. The third target is to provide doctors, nurses\nand other health professionals with temporary salary increase of 25 to 100% as hazard\nallowance depending on their level of involvement. ln addition, the village level female health\nvolunteers will receive a financial incentive. ln total, the government aims to provide these\nincentive to at least 70,000 health and frontline workers, of which about 70o/o will be women, by\nAugust 2020.\nAnnex 1 lists the more detailed activities and the responsible agencies for implementation of\ncomponent 1, as per the Relief Program lmplementation Action Plan.\nii)  National Relief Program - social protection for the poor and vulnerable\n(component 2). The poor and vulnerable, including returning migrants, will be severely affected\nby the economic impact of the pandemic. The National Relief Program includes several\nmeasures to minimize the negative impacts. The government aims to provide food to at least 1\nmillion poor and disadvantaged  households, latest by the end of the ongoing fiscal year. ln a\nworst-case scenario up to 1.3 million households might need this support. As many migrant\nworkers will re[urn home and workers in the informal sector might become unemployed, the\ngovernment targeits th?{ at least 500,000 workers will have received employment support\nthrough the Prime Ministers Employment Program by the end of next fiscal year. As this is an\ninclusive program, at least 507o of the beneficiaries are expected to be female and 25% of the\nbeneficiaries from a disadvantage  background, in proportion with the number of people\nregistered.\nAnnex 2 provides more details on the activities and the agencies responsible for implementation\nof the second component as per the Relief Program Action lmplementation Plan.\niii)  National Relief Program - economic support for affected sectors (component 3).\nTo support individual and companies adversely atfected several measures are announced by\nTel: Minister 4211g0g, Secretary 4211332,lnternational Economic Cooperation Coordination Division 4211372,4211867\nFax N o. 42111 64, 42111 65, Webs ite : www. mof . gov. n p", "Governme of Nepal\nMINISTR FINANCE\nSINGHADURBAR\nKATHMANDU, NEPAL\nthe Ministry of Finance to ease the tax burden and address challenges in trade. ln addition,\nNepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the central bank, issued directives to suppo[ affected individuals and\nbusinesses, including providing refinancing facility to at least 1o,O0o affected micro, small and\nmedium sized enterprises (MSMEs), to aviil the concessional loans by the end of the next fiscal\nyear. ln line with the government's priority, at least 3}o/o of the loins will be sanctioned to\nwomen-led MSMEs and at least 50% of these women-led MSMEs shall refresent women from\ndisadvantaged groups, depending on the actual number of appticants.

Nepal is committed to implementing an\ninclusive and pro-poor national relief program as outlined above. fnereiore, sp\"iin\" target-s fJr\nwomen and disadvantaged groups are included.\nThe cumulative cost of the health care, food support, social safety and economic recovery\nprograms is estimated to be about 4% of GDP. With declining revenues and the need to\nincrease spending, the government is reprioritizing and reprogra,iming its budgetary altocation\nfor this and next fiscal year. Government agencies have been instructed to cut down on less\npriority expenditures. However, the primary estimates on financing requirements  and the net\nfinancing gap for this fiscal year is signiflcant. The government's initial estimate to meet this\nrequirement entails contributions from different sourcel as listed betow in annex 4.\nThe government is fully committed to responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Early on, a High-\nlevel Coordination Committee for the Prevention and Control of COVID-19, chlireO Oy ine\nDeputy Prime Minister and represented by nine ministers, was formed to coordinate government\nactions to respond to the pandemic. Several sub-committees,  headed by differeni ministers,\nhave been formed to oversee the implementation of government response programs.

Adverse impact of  Decline in growth. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused \nexogenous shocks.  severe sudden disruptions in the economy. It is estimated that \nthe COVID-19 pandemic will lead to economic losses of $2.3 \nbillion or 7.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) in FY2020 and \nFY2021. ADB projected 6.3% GDP growth for FY2020 before \nthe pandemic; however, the official GDP growth is estimated \nto decline to 2.3%. The impacts have already surfaced in \nsectors such as tourism, trade, health, and disrupted supply \nchains. The hotel and restaurant sector revenue is likely to \ncontract by 16.3% in FY2020 after rising by 7.3% a year \nearlier. The transport sector revenue is estimated to fall by \n2.4% in FY2020 compared to a rise of 5.9% in FY2019. The \nmanufacturing  sector  is  estimated  to  contract  by  2.3%  in \nFY2020 after expanding by 6.8% in FY2019. The restriction of \ntravel has particularly affected Nepal\u2019s hospitality and tourism \nindustry,  which  is  a  major  foreign  exchange  source.  The \nimpact has been also visible in manufacturing industries. In the \ncurrent situation in which many migrant workers are returning \nto Nepal, the effect on remittances is significant and creates a \nsevere impact on the economy\u2019s overall consumption. The \nlatest IMF forecasts released on 6 May 2020 projects GDP \ngrowth to be 1.0% in FY2020 and 3.5% in FY2021.a \n \nFiscal  stress.  The  revenue  mobilization  is  expected  to \ndecrease from pre-COVID-19 estimate of 28.0% of GDP to \n25.8%. With rising health and public order expenses in due to \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, fiscal deficit will widen from pre-\nCOVID-19  estimate  of  6.4%  of  GDP  to  8.5%  in  FY2020. \nSimilarly, current account deficit will widen from pre-COVID-\n19 estimate of 5.4% of GDP to 7.5% in FY2020. A twin deficit \nof fiscal and current account balances will be more prominent \nthis fiscal year, exerting pressure on limited fiscal space to \nmeet new expenditures.  \n \nFinancial sector distress. The economic disruptions caused \nby  the  pandemic  are  affecting  the  real  sector,  which  is \nreflected in the financial sector performance. The NPL ratio \nstarted showing a worsening trend from NPL ratio of 1.74% in \nDecember  2019  to  1.77%  in  March  2020.  Similarly,  the \nfinancial sector\u2019s capital adequacy ratio is deteriorating from \n14.19%  in  December  2019  to  13.97%  in  March  2020.b \nRemittances, which grew by 3.61% in FY2019, declined by \n50.07% in April 2020 as compared to April 2019.b Remittance \ninflow declined first time since the Nepal earthquake in 2015. \n \n ", "26  Appendix 4 \n  Asian Development Bank Assessment \n \n2.  Countercyclical  On 29 March, the government approved the National Relief \ndevelopment  Program (pandemic response plan) which comprise (i) health \nexpenditures  and medical support, (ii) social protection for the poor and \nvulnerable, and (iii) economic support for affected sectors. The \ncost of the government\u2019s National Relief Program for fiscal \nyear (FY) 2020 is estimated at $1.26 billion, comprising (i) \n$347 million for health and medical support, (ii) $359 million \nfor social protection for the poor and vulnerable, and (iii) $555 \nmillion for economic support for affected sectors. \n \nKey health and medical support actions include (i) building \nadditional  quarantine  and  hospital  bed  capacity;  (ii) \nestablishing  laboratories  with  PCR  test  capacity;  (iii) \ninstructing private hospitals with a capacity of 50 or more beds \nto  prepare  isolation  wards  to  treat  suspected  COVID-19 \npatients;  (iv)  scaling  up  critical  care  bed  capacity;  (v) \nintroducing health insurance scheme to medical personnel; \nand (vi) providing additional financial incentives to medical and \nhealth personnel.  \n \nKey actions in social protection for the poor and vulnerable \ninclude  (i)  mapping  and  registration  of  the  poor  and \ndisadvantaged people; (ii) food distribution to the poor and \ndisadvantaged  people;  (iii)  instructing  firms  to  pay  wages \nduring the lockdown period; (iv) contributing to the employers \nand employee shares for the social security fund for at least \none  month;  (v)  registering  returnee  migrant  workers;  (vi) \nproving returnee migrant workers with employment support; \nand (vii) extending employment support to informal workers.c \n \nThe  key  actions  for  economic  support  for  affected  sector \ninclude (i) allowing deferred the tax filing for at least one \nmonth,  and  (ii)  waiving  all  customs  duties  on  medical \nequipment.  NRB,  the  central  bank,  issued  a  directives  in \nrelation  to  the  government\u2019s  response  plan  including  (i) \nallowing  debt  rescheduling  until  end  of  FY2020  with  no \npenalty; (ii) instructing banks to provide 10% interest rate \ndiscount to the borrowers who repay on time; (iii) extending \nloan repayment of short-term working capital loans by 60 days; \n(iv) instructing banks to relax the loan amount ceiling and \napprove  loans  within  5  days  for  tourism  and  transport \nbusinesses; (v) allowing banks count loans to health facilities \nfor COVID-19 treatment qualify towards priority sector lending \nrequirements; (vi) lowering the mandatory cash reserve rate \nfrom 4% to 3% and reduce the interest rate on the standing \nliquidity facility rate from 6% to 5%; (vii) providing a refinancing \nfacility of NRs100 billion for affected small- and medium-sized \nenterprises, including financing for short-term working capital \nas well as for returnee migrant workers; (viii) providing grant \n ", "  Appendix 4  27 \n  Asian Development Bank Assessment \n \nsubsidy  for  transport  of  agriculture  produce;  and  (ix) \ndiscounting electricity and water supply.d \n \n3.  Pre-shock record of  GDP growth had averaged 7.3% during FY2017\u2013FY2019. The \ngenerally sound  growth increased from 6.7% in FY2018 to 7.0% in FY2019 \nmacroeconomic  mainly  due  to  accelerated  post-earthquake  reconstruction, \nmanagement  inflows of workers\u2019 remittances, a favorable monsoon leading \nto a bumper harvest, and continued improvement in electricity \nsupply.  Remittance  income  has  helped  maintain \nmacroeconomic stability by (i) supporting the external current \naccount,  (ii)  increasing  tax  revenue  through  induced \nconsumption and imports, and (iii) increasing income of poor \nhouseholds. Inflation has begun to rise following a decline from \na recent peak of 9.9% in FY2016. More recently, inflation \nbecame 6.5% in the first 8 months of FY2020.  \n \nFiscal deficit moderated to 5.1% of GDP in FY2019, after rising \nto  6.6%  in  FY2018,  on  lower  than  planned  capital \nexpenditures.  Current account deficit narrowed from 8.2% of \nGDP in FY2018 to 7.7% of GDP in FY2019. Gross foreign \nexchange reserves were comfortable at $9.5 billion, enough to \ncover  import  of  7.8 months  in  FY2019.   With an  average \nrevenue  to  GDP  of  23.8%  from  FY2017  to  FY2019, \nthe revenue mobilization (excluding foreign grants) has been \nrobust.  Total external debt stood at 17.0% of GDP in FY2019, \nslightly lower than 17.3% of GDP in FY2018. External debt is \nlargely  long-term  at  concessional  rates  from  multilateral \nfinancial institutions and bilateral donors. External debt service \nis equivalent to about 8.2% of exports of goods and non-factor \nservices. \n \nIMF Article IV consultation concluded in February 2020, which \ndid  not  take  the  COVID-19  impact  into  consideration, \nconfirmed that Nepal had seen strong growth and significant \npoverty reduction, and had expected Nepal to growth 6.0% in \nFY2020. IMF further assessed that a neutral fiscal stance \ndriven by under spending of the budget is expected to help \ncontain external and domestic pressures.e A neutral fiscal \nstance driven by under spending of the budget is expected to \nhelp contain external and domestic pressures. \n \n4.  Structural reforms   As part of the pandemic response, the government-initiated \npolicy,  and  institutional  structural  reforms  to  enhance  the \npublic  sector  resilience  to  emergencies,  especially  in  the \nhealth sector. MOHP developed the Health Sector Emergency \nResponse Plan: COVID-19 Pandemic, which provides detailed \ninstitutional mechanisms and procedures to be adopted during \na pandemic. The plan provides detailed steps on (i) command \nand  control,  (ii)  risk  assessment,  (iii)  communication,  (iv) \nsurveillance,  (v)  case  investigation  and  treatment,  (vi) \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \n  Asian Development Bank Assessment \n \npreventing  spread  of  the  disease  in  the  community,  (vii) \nmaintaining  essential  services,  and  (viii)  research  and \nevaluation. The plan prescribes strategic approaches and key \ninterventions for (i) health systems, (ii) public health and social \nmeasures, (iii) curative care, and (iv) strengthened monitoring. \nThe  management  and  oversight  functions  are  further \nelaborated into (i) safety and security of frontline staff, (ii) \nhuman  resource  management  and  capacity  building,  (iii) \nlogistics and supply chain management, (iv) collaboration and \npartnership, and (v) monitoring, evaluation and reporting.  \n \nIn  the  pandemic  response  plan,  the  government  also \nincorporated financial sector structural reforms to enable the \nregulatory authorities and financial institutions to maintain the \nsector\u2019s liquidity and stability at the time of emergencies. NRB, \nthe central bank included the reform measures of (i) allowing \nbanks count loans to health facilities for COVID-19 treatment \nqualify towards priority sector lending requirements, and (ii) \nlowering the mandatory cash reserve rate from 4% to 3% and \nreduce the interest rate on the standing liquidity facility rate \nfrom 6% to 5%. Further, the government expanded its scope \nof  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Employment  Program,  which  was \noriginally  targeted  at  domestic  unemployment  to  returnee \nmigrant workers whose contracts in their host countries abroad \nwere affected due to the pandemic.  \n \n5.  Debt sustainability  ADB\u2019s debt sustainability assessment finds that from 30.1% of \nGDP in FY2019, the pandemic increases the debt-to-GDP \nratio to 39.0% in FY2020 and 43.4% in FY2021 as growth dips \nand the primary balance worsens to fight the pandemic and \nsupport  recovery.  This  assessment  assumes  the  primary \ndeficit to be 7.9% of GDP in FY2020. As growth picks up, \npublic debt will continue to rise at a slower pace and reach \n48.5% in FY2025. The debt path of the ADB baseline is about \n1 percentage point higher than that projected by IMF in the \nRCF  report,  largely  due  to  the  higher  primary  deficit  in \nFY2020.a Nepal\u2019s public-debt to GDP ratio will stabilize when \nthe primary deficit is at 3.5% of GDP. In a stress test scenario \nof  a  negative  growth  shock,  with  GDP  growth  one-half \nstandard deviation (1.1 percentage points) below the baseline \nin the first two years along with corresponding falls in nominal \ngrowth, is likely to increase debt to GDP at a faster pace \nreaching  a  peak  of  49.3%  in  FY2025.  A  primary  balance \nshock, where the primary deficit as a percent of GDP is one \nhalf  standard  deviation  (1.4  percentage  points)  above  the \nbaseline in the first two years of projection, will elevate debt \nlevels to just cross the 50% threshold to 50.5% in FY2025. The \ntwo shocks combined will push the debt-to-GDP ratio further \nhigher, crossing the 50% threshold earlier in FY2024 and \nreaching 51.3% in FY2025. \n ", "  Appendix 4  29 \n  Asian Development Bank Assessment \n \nApproved  and  proposed  COVID-19  response  assistances \nfrom international financial institutions are $843 million in this \nand next fiscal year. These borrowings are used to finance the \nestimated fiscal deficit in FY2020 and FY2021 and hence are \nalready reflected in the baseline debt path. The emergency \nassistance includes from ADB (proposed $250 million), IMF \n($214 million already approved), the World Bank ($29 million \napproved in FY2020 and $250 million likely to be effective in \nFY2021) and AIIB ($100 million proposed in FY2021). These \nmultilateral loans are about 1.6% of GDP in FY2020 and 1% \nin FY2021.  \n  \nThe 2020 IMF Article IV reports that Nepal has a strong debt \ncarrying  capacity.  A  composite  indicator  using  real  GDP \ngrowth, remittances, foreign exchange reserves and world \ngrowth shows a composite indicator score of 3.28 which is in \nthe range of a strong rating. Nepal continues to meet its debt-\nservicing  obligations.  The  thresholds  for  external-debt  to \nrevenue and external-debt to exports used in Article IV are \n21% and 23%, respectively. Between 2009 and 2019, the \naverage external-debt to revenue and external-debt to exports \nwere 5% and 10%, respectively. The IMF\u2019s latest staff report \nfor the disbursement under RCF approved on 6 May 2020 \nconfirmed that even under the COVID-19 pandemic, Nepal\u2019s \ndebt is assessed to remain at a low risk of external and overall \ndebt distress, unchanged from the 2020 Article IV report. \n \n6.  Coordination with the IMF  ADB regularly holds consultation with IMF as part of Article IV \nconsultations, processing of PBLs, and other missions. The \nlatest Article IV consultation was held in-country during 5-\n17January  2020.  The  government  has  requested  IMF  to \nextend the Rapid Credit Facility (SDR156.9 million, about $214 \nmillion)  to  respond  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  An \nassessment letter from the IMF has been secured confirming \nthe  soundness  of  the  government\u2019s  macroeconomic \nmanagement and other policies. ADB regularly participates in \ndialogue with the World Bank, IMF, and other development \npartners on reform initiatives to support macroeconomic and \nfinancial  stability  in  the  country.  Further,  ADB  is  closely \ninteracting  with  IMF  on  the  CARES  Program  to  ensure \ncomplementarity with IMF\u2019s COVID-19 support for Nepal.f \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AIIB = Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, CARES = COVID-19 Active Response \nand Expenditure Support, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International \nMonetary Fund, NPL = nonperforming loan, MOHP = Ministry of Health and Population, NRB = Nepal Rastra Bank, \nPBL = policy-based loan,  PCR = polymerase chain reaction, RCF = Rapid Credit Facility, SDR = special drawing right.  \na  IMF. 2020.
