An \nupdated EIA is detailed in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \nThe Issyk\u2013Kul Sustainable Development Project (the Project) is the first \nphase in a longer-term initiative by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto  support  environmental  management  and  to  improve  urban  service \ndelivery  in  the  Issyk\u2013Kul  Oblast.  ADB  and  government  collaboration  in \nIssyk\u2013Kul  will  ensure  that  urban  services  interventions  will  increase \naccess  to  potable  water  and  safe  sanitation,  including  use  of  proven \ntechnologies  for  treatment  and  disposal  of  solid  and  liquid  waste.  The \nProject  will  (i)  improve  urban  infrastructure,  including  sewerage  and \nsanitation,  solid  waste  management,  water  supply,  and  community \nupgrading;  and  (ii)  improve  service  delivery  through  better  enterprise \nresource management.  \n \nThe Project covers the cities of Balykchy, Cholpon\u2013Ata, and Karakol. Its \noutputs are: \n(i) \n\nreplacing  a  13.4-kilometer \n(specifically \ntreatment  plants); \naddressing  pumping  mains \nrehabilitating  pumping  stations  in  Balykchy  and  Karakol;  extending \nthe  sewer  network  by  12  km  to  uncovered  areas  in  Karakol;  and \nsupplying  relevant \nfor  sewer \nmaintenance;  \n\ntools,  equipment,  and  vehicles \n\n(km)  sewer  network \n\nto  sewage \n\n(ii)  re-engineering 42.5 hectares of waste dumps into sanitary landfills, \nclosing  existing  dumps  in  all  three  project  cities,  providing  waste \nsegregation  and  recyclable  sorting  equipment,  and  supplying \nvehicles and equipment for waste collection and transport; \n\n(iii)  installing  8,550  water  meters,  training  vodokanal  enterprises  in \nmeter  reading  and  leak  control,  constructing  a  presedimentation \ntreatment  tank  at  the  Karakol  water  headworks,  replacing  a  2  km \ncorroded  transmission  main  in  Balykchy,  and  reconstructing  10 \nboreholes  (with  treatment,  energy  efficient  pumps,  storage,  and \nprotection facilities) in Balykchy and Cholpon\u2013Ata;  \n\n(iv)  providing in the three project cities, water and sanitation facilities in \npre-schools, schools and  neighborhoods, and public conveniences \nin  markets,  public  centers,  health  care  organizations,  and  public \ninstitutions; and  \n\n \n\nBorrower  \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject \nDescription \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nRationale \n\n(v)  implementing  an  enterprise  resource  management  component \ncomprising  a  management  information  system,  accounting  and \nfinancial  management,  geographic \ninformation  system,  asset \ninventory and management, and institutional effectiveness program \nfor cities, vodokanal enterprises and tazalyk enterprises. \n\nfeatures  under \n\ncountry  development \n\n \nLake  Issyk\u2013Kul  (\u201cwarm  lake\u201d  in  Kyrgyz)  is  the  world\u2019s  second  largest \nsaline  lake;  a  Ramsar  site  of  globally  significant  biodiversity;  and  a \nUnited  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization \n(UNESCO)-designated  biosphere  reserve.  The  lake  forms  a  significant \npart  of  Issyk\u2013Kul  Oblast  and  contributes  to  its  economic  growth  by \nproviding  tourism  opportunities.  Attracting  approximately  1  million \ntourists  annually\u2014equivalent  to  70%  of  the  country\u2019s  annual  tourist  of \n1.4 million persons\u2014the lake is a major economic driver in the region.  \n \nIncreasing tourism has resulted in the construction of many resorts that \nare now sprawled around the lake's northern shores. However, existing \nwater  supply  and  sanitation \ninfrastructure\u2014including  solid  waste \nmanagement\u2014is decrepit, dysfunctional, and poorly maintained. Current \ninfrastructure  is  unable  to  serve  the  high  number  of  tourists,  which \nexceeds the resident population by a factor of four. Excessive pressure \non existing infrastructure is partially responsible for the lake's pollution. \n \nThe \nstrategy,  2009\u20132011,  emphasizes \nenvironmental sustainability. The Project, and its focus on protecting the \nlake, \nthe \nIssyk\u2013Kul  region.  In  February  2009,  the  Concept  of  Sustainable \nDevelopment of the Ecological and Economic System of Issyk\u2013Kul was \npassed through a presidential decree. Subsequently, the Government of \nKyrgyz  Republic  passed  a  resolution  in  May  2009  that  prioritizes \nimplementation of the Project. \n \nADB-led  investment  and  policy  dialogue  in  the  region  will  improve  the \ninfrastructure and quality of urban services, foster tourism, and preserve \nthe  lake's  environment.  Institutional,  legal,  and  municipal  finance \nassessments in Issyk\u2013Kul will provide a suitable platform for developing \nADB's urban services sector development strategy for Kyrgyz Republic. \nDevelopment  of  performance-based  service  contracts  through  the \nProject will also improve opportunities for public\u2013private partnerships in \nthe water supply and sanitation sector. \n \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  improve  the  health  of  resident  population  in \nthe Issyk\u2013Kul Oblast and to ensure environmental preservation of Lake \nIssyk\u2013Kul. The outcome of the Project is improved urban basic service \ndelivery  (comprising  sewerage,  sanitation,  solid  waste  management, \nand water supply) in the cities of Balykchy, Cholpon\u2013Ata, and Karakol. \n \nThe  Project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $37.50  million,  including \ntaxes and duties of $3.17 million.  \n\ninvestment  project \n\nthe  strategy\u2019s \n\nfor \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nProject \nInvestment Plan  \n \n\n \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\n($ million)\n\nSource\n\nAmount\n\n%\n\n \n\niii\n\nA.

Upon completion of the \nProject,  the  water  supply  system  will  comprise  improved  treatment \nfacilities  at  water  sources  and  household  meters  that  directly  benefit \nabout  43,000  people \nthree  project  cities,  with  notable \nimprovements  in  water  quality  and  regulated  water  supply.  The \nsewerage  and  sanitation  investments  will  benefit  68,000  persons \nthrough improved access to reticulated systems, sanitation facilities, and \nlatrines.  About  133,500  persons  will  benefit  from  solid  waste  collection \nand disposal services. The integrated improvement of the existing urban \ninfrastructure  facilities  and  services  will  provide  better  living  conditions \nand  enhance  the  surrounding  environment  in  the  project  cities.  The \nProject's  enterprise  resource  management  component  will  create  a \nculture  of  prudent  financial  management  in  the  cities  and  service \nutilities, enabling them to generate revenue surpluses in the longer term \nfor equity investments and leveraging debt. \n \nPotential risks associated with the Project include (i) lack of commitment \nby city administrations to undertake or implement reforms in urban and \nfinancial \ninability \nfinancial  management,  and \nimprovement  action  plan;  (ii)  inability  of  government  staff  to  implement \nthe  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan;  (iii)  sudden \nincrease in cost  of  construction  items;  (iv)  insufficient  incentives  by  the \nGovernment  to  ensure  vodokanal  enterprises  and  tazalyk  enterprises \nstaff  provide  efficient  service  delivery;  and  (v)  lack  of  viability  gap \nfunding from the Government to sustain urban services. \n \nEarly  establishment  of  the  PMO  and  PIO  and  commencement  of \nsurveys  for  engineering  designs  and  information,  education,  and \ncommunication  campaign \nto  generate  community  awareness  will \nmitigate start-up delays. Efficiently functioning PMO and PIO will ensure \nthe  project  is  completed  on  time  and  sudden  price  rise  of  construction \nitems  is  adequately  accommodated.  The  Prime  Minister's  Office  has \ndirect  control  over  the  Project's  objectives  and  will  monitor  activities, \nimproving  the  urban  management  and  financial  performance  of  cities. \nAppointing  the  Ministry  of  Finance  as  the  Executing  Agency  cements \ncommitment  for  viability  gap  funding  as  a  key  line  item  in  the  national \nbudget  as  the  Ministry  of  Finance  prepares  and  disburses  funds  under \nthe medium-term budgetary framework. \n \n\nimplement \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n\fo\n71  00'E\n\no\n78  00'E\n\nKYRGYZ  REPUBLIC\nISSYK--KUL  SUSTAINABLE\nDEVELOPMENT PROJECT\n\nK A Z A K H S T A N\n\no\n42  30'N\n\nShopokov\n\nBISHKEK\n\nIvanovka\n\nKant\nNovopavlovka\n\nTokmok\n\nKayingdy\n\nKara\nBalta\n\nCHUI\n\nKemin\n\nCholpon-Ata\n\n- K u l\n\nk\n\ny\n\ns\n\ns\n\nI\n\ne  \n\nL a k\n\nBalykchy\n\nKochkor\n\nISSYK-KUL\n\nTyup\n\nKarakol\n\nDzhergalan\n\no\n42  30'N\n\nMaimak\n\nPokrovka\n\nTalas\n\nBakay Ata\n\nTALAS\n\nSuusamyr\n\nToktogul\n\nChaek\n\nLake Song-Kul\n\nKanysh-\nKiya\n\nToktogul Reservoir\n\nKarajigach\n\nTerek\nSai\n\nTash\nKumyr\n\nKarakul\n\nArslanbob\n\nKochkor Ata\n\nShamaldy\nSai\n\nBazar-Korgon\n\nJALAL-ABAD\n\nKazarman\n\nKok\nYangak\n\nJalal-Abad\n\nAndizhan Reservoir\n\nUzgen\n\nKara-Kulja\n\nUZBEKISTAN\n\nKara Su\n\nOsh\n\nAravan\n\nKyzyl Kiya\n\nNaiman\n\nOSH\n\nGulcha\n\nNARYN\n\nNaryn\n\nBaetov\n\nAt-Bashy\n\nLake Chatyr-Kul\n\nTorugart\n\nIrkeshtam\n\nSary Tash\n\nPEOPLE'S    REPUBLIC\nOF   CHINA \n\no\n38  00'N\n\nN\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nKilometers\n\nProject Province\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nMain Road\n\nOther Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nDistrict Boundary\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\no\n78  00'E\n\nTAJIKISTAN\n\no\n38  00'N\n\nBatken\n\nFrunze\n\nChauvay\n\nSulyukta\n\nHaidarkan\n\nBATKEN\n\nDaroot-Korgon\n\n0\n9\n-\n2\n8\n1\n2\n \nH\nR\n\nTAJIKISTAN\n\no\n71  00'E\n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan,  and  (ii)  a  proposed  grant,  both  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  the  Issyk\u2013Kul  Sustainable \nDevelopment Project (the Project).  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nLake  Issyk\u2013Kul  (\u201cwarm  lake\u201d  in  Kyrgyz)  is  the  world\u2019s  second-largest  saline  lake;  a \nRamsar1 site of globally significant biodiversity; and a United Nations Educational, Scientific and \nCultural  Organization  (UNESCO)-designated  biosphere  reserve.2 The  lake  forms  a  significant \npart  of  Issyk\u2013Kul  Oblast\u2019s  area,  and  contributes  to  its  economic  growth  through  tourism. \nAttracting about 1 million tourists annually, equivalent to 70% of the country\u2019s annual tourist of \n1.4 million persons, the lake is a major economic driver in the region. With the country\u2019s political \nsituation gradually stabilizing, there is exponential growth in tourist numbers to Kyrgyz Republic, \nmost of them from neighboring Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, and Uzbekistan.  \n \n3. \nThe country\u2019s supply response to increased tourism is notable, with active construction \nand  resorts  sprawling  around  the  lake's  northern  shores,  primarily  in  three  cities  (Balykchy, \nCholpon\u2013Ata,  and  Karakol).  However,  existing  water  supply  and  sanitation  infrastructure\u2014\nincluding  solid  waste  management\u2014is  decrepit,  dysfunctional,  and  poorly  maintained.  It  is \nunable to serve the high number of tourists, which exceeds the resident population by a factor of \nfour.  Excessive  pressure  on  this  existing  infrastructure  is  partially  responsible  for  the  lake's \npollution. \n \n4. \nProject interventions will improve the infrastructure and quality of urban services in the \nregion, foster tourism, and preserve the lake's environment. Feasibility and social studies were \nundertaken through an Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance project.3 Appendix \n1  contains  the  Project's  design  and  monitoring  framework,  which  will  be  updated  based  on \nProject inception baseline survey and implementation progress. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nSocioeconomic Context \n\n5. \nEconomy.  Issyk\u2013Kul  Oblast  is  spread  over  43,100  square  kilometers  (km),  with \napproximately  430,000  persons  (around  8%  of  the  total  Kyrgyz  Republic  population).  Karakol \nhas  about  67,500  people;  Balykchy,  42,000;  and  Cholpon\u2013Ata,  12,000.  The  oblast\u2019s  gross \nregional product grew from $358 million in 2005 to $540 million in 2007 mainly from gold mining \nat the Kumtor gold deposit, one of the 10 largest gold deposits in the world. Capital investments \nin the oblast have risen from $39 million (2005) to $145 million (2007) but are largely limited to \nthe mining industry due to additional gold deposit finds in the recent past. Urban infrastructure \ninvestments  are  mainly  financed  by  donor  agencies  with  negligible  investments  made  by  the \noblast  or  central  government.  The  oblast  also  produces  and  exports  cereals,  apples,  pears, \npotatoes, livestock, and dairy products.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   The  Ramsar  Convention  is  an  international  treaty  for  the  conservation  and  sustainable  use  of  wetlands,  which \n\ncame into force on 21 December 1975. \n\n2   As  per  the  United  Nations,  biosphere  reserves  combine  nature  conservation  and  sustainable  development  to \nprotect  natural  and  cultural  landscapes.  The  biosphere  reserve  concept  was  developed  by  UNESCO  and  is  a \ndistinction, but it does not confer any legally binding protection on the area. \n\n3   ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to Kyrgyz Republic for the Issyk\u2013Kul Sustainable Development Project. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nTourism.  Tourism  constitutes  about  10%  of  the  oblast's  gross  regional  product.  The \n6. \ntourist  population  tends  to  increase  substantially  during  summers  (June  through  August).  The \ntourist inflow is mainly to the city of Cholpon\u2013Ata, but Balykchy and Karakol receive some tourist \ninflows as well. Karakol has a large tourist influx during the winter due to nearby ski resorts. The \nIntegrated  Development  Plan 4  for  the  region  focuses  on  the  lake's  northern,  eastern,  and \nsouthern  areas,  and  Government  support  for  tourism  and  resort  development  has  increased \npressure on urban services and the lake's environment. \n \n\n2. \n\nAccess to Services \n\nA  recent  socioeconomic  survey5 indicated  that  urban  residents\u2019  top  priority  is  improved \n\n7. \nwater supply and sanitation services. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nWater  supply.  About  one  quarter  of  households  indicated  inadequate  water \nsupply for household needs. Waterborne illnesses due to poor water quality were \nsignificant, with 82% of households reporting incidences in the past 5 years. \nSanitation. About 75% of households use dry-pit latrines, and 24% use flush or \npour  toilets.  About  66%  of  households  surveyed  stated  they  would  be  willing  to \npay for connection to a sewerage system, indicating citizens\u2019 priority for improved \nsanitation. \nSolid waste management. Approximately 84% of households stated that a solid \nwaste  collection  service  was  unavailable  on  a  daily  basis.  Waste  disposal \npractices  included  plastic  bottle  and  packaging  collection  by  the  tazalyk \nenterprise  from  50%  of  households,  waste  incineration  by  36%  of  households, \nand  waste  disposal  into  the  nearest  landfill  or  waste  receptacle  by  8%  of \nhouseholds.  \n\n3. \n\nSocial Issues \n\nPoverty.  In  2008,  around  39%  of  the  oblast\u2019s  population  lived  in  poverty6 and  8%  in \n8. \nextreme  poverty.  The  poor  account  for  19%  of  the  project  beneficiary  population,  with  the \nextremely poor making up 9%. Within the project area, poverty incidence ranges from 2.6% in \nCholpon\u2013Ata to 10.4% in Karakol and to 31.9% in Balykchy. The social analysis concluded that \nthe poor mostly live in areas without regular water supplies, sewage, and solid waste collection \nservices.  They  often  suffer  from  serious  water  supply  shortages,  poor  water  quality,  sewage \npollution, and poor urban environmental sanitation.  \n \n9. \nGender Analysis. Households headed by women account for 41% of project beneficiary \nhouseholds  and  are  smaller  than  households  headed  by  men.  Single-person  households  are \nmore  often  headed  by  women.  Some  87%  of  households  headed  by  women  and  91%  of \nhouseholds headed by men receive regular cash income. A higher proportion of women-headed \nhouseholds  (20%)  live  in  poverty  when  compared  with  men-headed  households  (18%).  The \ntotal  number  of  sick  days  due  to  waterborne  illnesses is  also  higher  for  women  (151)  than  for \nmen  (73).  Women  and  girls  are  primarily  responsible  for  collection  of  household  water, \nhousehold garbage disposal, and care of the sick and elderly. These activities negatively impact \nhealth and cause conflict and stress in communities during rush hours and given limited water \nsupply  schedules.  Despite  an  active  role  in  the  sector,  women  lack  decision-making  powers, \nand their representation in management of water supply and sanitation services is low at 10%. \n \n\n                                                 \n4   JICA. 2006.

The  water  network  serves  approximately \n85%  of  the  population  but  is  in  poor  condition.  Water  production  capacities  are \nhigh  to  meet  water  requirement  for  domestic  and  household  irrigation,  which \nshould  be  rectified  to  address  long-term  water  conservation  goals.7 The  stated \nnonrevenue water ranges from 25% to 60%, but due to the lack of metering and \nthe  poor  condition  of  the  system,  the  actual  amount  is  unknown.  Poor  water \nquality and lack of water conservation methods are key issues to address. \nExtended aeration-based sewage treatment plants were constructed in all three \nproject  cities  during  the  Soviet  period,  but  the  plants  are  dilapidated  and  no \nsewage is currently treated. Population access to the sewerage system is low at \n35% and is limited to residents of apartment blocks only. Dilapidated sewer lines \nresult in sewage infiltration into the ground, resulting in low flows at the sewage \ntreatment  plants.  Moreover,  much  of  the  population  continues  to  rely  on  pit \nlatrines,  a  serious  threat  to  groundwater  quality.  Sewer  rehabilitation  and \nmethods to control sewage flows into the groundwater are of immediate priority. \nPrivate  tourist  resorts,  especially  around  Cholpon\u2013Ata,  are  expected  to  operate \nsewage  treatment  plants.  While  most  resorts  do  maintain  a  plant,  monitoring  of \nsewage treatment plant operations and the treated effluent quality is inadequate. \nThe  exact  impact  of  effluent  discharges,  if  any,  on  the  lake  water  quality  is \nunknown.  Overall,  the  combination  of  partially  operating  central  sewerage \nsystems,  private  self-provision  of  sanitation  facilities,  and  lax  monitoring  of \nsewage  discharge  from  resorts  presents  a  significant  threat  to  Lake  Issyk\u2013Kul's \nwater quality. \nTazalyk  enterprises  provide  solid  waste  management  services  based  on \ncontractual  arrangements  with  the  cities.8 The  region  generates  daily  waste  of \n1.5 kilograms per capita but daily collection is low at 50%.9 All waste is disposed \nof at existing dumps in each city, affecting groundwater, and surface water flow \ninto the lake. Waste management and strategies to recycle waste are critical for \nthese cities, in addition to developing sanitary landfills for safe waste disposal. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Issues \n\n11. \nThe  oblast  administration  oversees  the  functioning  of  local  self-governments  (including \ncity  administrations)  in  the  region  through  rayon  centers.  The  city  administrations  of  Balykchy \nand  Karakol  report  directly  to  the  oblast,  while  that  of  Cholpon\u2013Ata  reports  to  the  Issyk\u2013Kul \nRayon.  Vodokanal  enterprise  and  tazalyk  enterprise  report  to  the  city  administration,  which  is \nheaded by an elected mayor. To improve efficiency and effectiveness of public administration, \nthe  Government  of  Kyrgyz  Republic  embarked  on  reform  initiatives  in  2004,  and  functional \ndecentralization to local governments was a key initiative. Major decisions included delegation \nof  authority  and  responsibility  of  urban  basic  services.  However,  paucity  of  capital  investment \nfunds,  lack  of  human  resources,  and  poor  cost  recovery  have  resulted  in  inefficient  service \ndelivery. \n \n                                                 \n7   For example, the gross per capita production in Balykchy is 666 liters per day. \n8   Tazalyk enterprises are also responsible for street lighting and park maintenance. \n9  About 70%\u201380% of the waste generated is landfill material, 11%\u201320% is organic, and 8%\u201312% is dry recyclables.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nThe  Government  is  still  in  the  process  of  approving  its  national  water  supply  and \n12. \nsanitation  policy.  A  national  coordinating  or  regulatory  body  also  does  not  exist  for  the  water \nsupply and sanitation sector. Under the National Agency on Local Self-Government Affairs, the \nDepartment  of  Rural  Water  Supply  is  responsible  for  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  and \ncurrently  executes  donor  projects  in  rural  areas.  Consequently,  water  supply  and  sanitation \nservices  in  urban  centers  are  managed  by  vodokanal  enterprises.  The  overfragmentation  and \ndecentralization  of  the  water  sector  has  resulted  in  few  economies  of  scale  and  diversity  of \ncosts. The lack of a database and management information system for sound decision making \nand an overreliance on Soviet consumption norms restrict target definition for service delivery.  \n \n\n3. \n\nSustainable Financing \n\n13. \nPublic  budget  expenditure  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  is  negligible  and \ncomprises less than 0.3% of central government budget expenditure, and is allocated through \nstate  transfers  to  finance  operating  expenditure  not  capital  expenditure.  Cities  also  rely \nextensively  on  state  revenue  transfers  that  constitute  18%\u201351%  of  their  operating  income.  A \nreview of project cities' operating accounts in 2008 indicated a deficit in Balykchy and Cholpon\u2013\nAta  and  a  marginal  surplus  in  Karakol  confirming  the  strong  dependence  on  state  transfers. \nConsequently, there is no surplus generation for capital investments. Vodokanal enterprises and \ntazalyk  enterprises  also  run  into  deficits  or  barely  break  even.  While  vodokanal  enterprises \noccasionally  meet  their  annual  business  plan,  tazalyk  enterprises  rely  on  cities  for  budgetary \nsupport.  Tariffs  barely  recover  operation  and  maintenance costs, let  alone  generate  surpluses \nfor future capital creation or for leveraging debt. It is therefore imperative to create a culture of \nprudent financial management among the project cities and service utilities. \n \n\n4. \n\nEnvironmental Management \n\n14. \nThe  Biosphere  Reserve  Directorate  (BRD)  within  the  State  Agency  for  Environmental \nProtection and Forestry (SAEPF) is responsible for the lake's environmental management and \nlaw  enforcement  to  preserve  the  biosphere  reserve.  However,  the  BRD  requires  substantial \nstrengthening  (e.g.,  financial  and  personnel)  to  perform  its  functions  and  preserve  the  lake's \nenvironment.  Similarly,  the  Issyk\u2013Kul  and  Naryn  Interregional  Department  for  Environmental \nProtection  (IDEP)  under  the  SAEPF  plays  an  important  role  in  environmental  management, \nmonitoring  of  infrastructure  projects,  and  environmental  law  enforcement.  However,  paucity  of \nfunds severely affects its ability to perform. Building BRD and IDEP capacities is critical for long-\nterm environmental management in the region and to ensure that infrastructure projects comply \nwith relevant environmental safeguards. \n \n\n5. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n15. \nAppendix 3 summarizes external assistance to the country's WSS sector. Donor projects \nin  the  project  area  include  (i)  the  completed  World  Bank  Small  Towns  Infrastructure  and \nCapacity Development Project that aimed to augment the quantity of water supply in Balykchy \nand  Cholpon\u2013Ata;  (ii)  an  ongoing  water  supply  project  in  Karakol  ($8  million)  financed  by  the \nSwiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs; and (iii) a proposed sewerage project in Cholpon\u2013\nAta financed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency. As a key component of the Joint \nCountry  Support  Strategy,  2007\u20132010,10 the  Project  will  ensure  that  benefits  accrued  through \ndonor  support  are  synergized  to  improve  urban  basic  service  delivery.  The  Project  is  aligned \nwith  the  Joint  Country  Support  Strategy  strategic  framework  and  will  (i)  harmonize  donor \n\n                                                 \n10  This  Joint  Country  Support  Strategy,  approved  by  the  Board  in  2007,  was  prepared  by  ADB,  Department  for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom, Swiss Development Cooperation, United Nations agencies, and \nthe World Bank Group. This assistance is closely aligned with the Government's development goals. \n\n\fdevelopmental  objectives;  (ii)  collaborate  on  resource  use  (i.e.,  the  appropriate  use  of  the \nenvironment  management  and  monitoring  plan);  (iii)  capitalize  on  donor  capacity-building \ninitiatives  (e.g.,  United  Nations  Development  Programme  training  of  tazalyk  enterprises  staff); \n(iv)  promote  good  governance  and  transparency  concepts;  and  (v)  use  information  and \ncommunication efforts to disseminate project benefits. \n \n\n6. \n\nLessons Learned from ADB-Assisted Water Supply and Sanitation Projects \n\n16. \nADB's water supply and sanitation sector experience in Kyrgyz Republic provides many \ncritical  lessons.11 These  include  the  need  for  (i)  rapid  commencement  of  project  activities;  (ii) \ngreater  coordination  of  government  executing  agencies  and  relevant  local  institutions;  (iii) \nstronger technical, institutional, and administrative capacities at these institutions; and (iv) active \nsupport and participation of project stakeholders and beneficiaries. \n \n17. \nADB\u2019s  review  of  experiences  indicated  that  early  capacity  building  of  project  executing \nand  implementing  agencies  is  required  to  develop  an  efficient  management  system  within  the \nExecuting Agency (EA) to monitor and supervise project activities. It also emphasized the need \nto  train  key  project  stakeholders  on  implementation  arrangements,  ADB  policies  and \nprocedures,  WSS  sector  development  issues,  and  environmental  management  issues.  During \nproject  design  and  implementation,  experiences  indicate  the  need  to  engage  and  educate \nproject beneficiaries and stakeholders through public consultations and participation programs. \n \nC. \n\nDevelopment Opportunities \n\nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  country  development  strategy,  2009\u20132011, 12  continues  to \n18. \nemphasize  environmental  sustainability  and  the  need  to  protect  Lake  Issyk\u2013Kul.  In  February \n2009,  the  Concept  of  Sustainable  Development  of  the  Ecological  and  Economic  System  of \nIssyk\u2013Kul was passed through a presidential decree. Subsequently, the Government passed a \nresolution in May 2009 that prioritizes project implementation. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n19. \nThe Project is expected to improve the health of the resident population in the Issyk\u2013Kul \nOblast  and  to  ensure  the  environmental  preservation  of  Lake  Issyk\u2013Kul.  The  outcome  of  the \nProject  is  improved  urban  basic  service  delivery  comprising  sewerage,  sanitation,  solid  waste \nmanagement, and water supply in the cities of Balykchy, Cholpon\u2013Ata, and Karakol. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  Project  comprises  three  parts.  Part  A  covers  urban  infrastructure  improvement, \n20. \nincluding  the  rehabilitation,  improvement,  and  expansion  of  water  supply  and  sanitation \nservices,  and  upgrading  common  water  and  sanitation  facilities  in  schools,  neighborhoods, \nhealth  care  organizations,  markets,  public  centers,  and  public  institutions  (Appendix  4 \nsummarizes this component). Part B covers strengthening enterprise resource management to \nimprove service delivery and to sustain investments in the long term (Appendix 5 summarizes \nthis  component).  Part  C  will  support  project  management  and  implementation  activities  at  the \n\n                                                 \n11  Lessons  were  learned  from  these  ongoing  projects:  (i)  ADB's  supplementary  grant  to  the  Community-Based \nInfrastructure Services Sector Project; and (ii) World Bank and Department for International Development-funded \nRural Water Supply and Sanitation Project II. \n\n12  Kyrgyz Republic. 2009.

The  Project \nwill  develop  monitoring  capacities  of  BRD  and  IDEP  by  providing  relevant  equipment  and \ntraining. \n \n\n1. \n\nPart A: Infrastructure Improvement \n\na. \n\nSewerage and Sanitation \n\n21. \nThis  subcomponent  will  benefit  approximately  45,000  persons  in  the  cities  of  Balykchy \nand  Karakol,  and  will  include  (i)  replacing  13.4  km  of  the  sewer  network  including  pumping \nmains  to  sewage  treatment  plants;  (ii)  rehabilitating  pumping  stations  in  both  cities;  and  (iii) \nexpanding 12 km of the sewer network to uncovered areas in Karakol. The subcomponent will \nalso  support  vodokanal  enterprises  efforts  to  operate  and  maintain  the  system  efficiently  by \nproviding relevant tools, equipment, and vehicles. \n \n\nb. \n\nSolid Waste Management \n\nThis subcomponent will benefit the permanent resident and tourist population of 133,500 \n22. \npersons  in  all  three  project  cities  and  will  include  (i)  re-engineering  42.5  hectares  of  existing \nwaste dumps into sanitary landfills, and closing existing dumps in all three cities \u2013 the landfills \nwill  include  units  for  waste  segregation  and  sorting  of  recyclables;  and  (ii)  procuring  vehicles \nand equipment for waste collection and transport. \n \n\nc. \n\nWater Supply \n\n23. \nThis subcomponent will directly benefit 43,000 persons in the three project cities through \ndistrict  metering  in  pilot  zones.  The  activity  will  determine  the  effect  on  water  conservation, \nwillingness to pay, and long-term impact on cost recovery and tariff rationalization. About 8,550 \nwater  meters  will  be  installed  in  the  three  cities,  and  vodokanal  enterprises  members  will  be \ntrained in meter reading and leak control. By constructing five boreholes with treatment, energy \nefficient  pumps,  storage,  and  protection  facilities  each  in  Balykchy  and  Cholpon\u2013Ata,  the \nsubcomponent  will  improve  the  quality  of  water  supplied.  The  subcomponent  will  include \nconstruction  of  a  new  presedimentation  treatment  tank  at  the  Karakol  water  headworks, \nincluding upgrading of intake, overflow, and drainage structures, which are susceptible to being \nwashed  away  during  floods  and  without  which  potable  water  supply  to  the  city's  resident \npopulation of 67,500 persons is likely to be terminated. The subcomponent will replace a 2 km-\nlong corroded section of the existing transmission main in Balykchy. \n \n\nd. \n\nCommunity Upgrading \n\n24. \nThis subcomponent will benefit 23,000 persons in all three project cities, and will include \nconstructing  (i)  water  and  sanitation  facilities  in  pre-schools  and  schools;  (ii)  community  water \nand sanitation facilities for a group of households and neighborhoods in distant areas; and (iii) \npublic  conveniences  in  markets,  public  centers,  health  care  organizations,  and  public \ninstitutions. Selection of the beneficiary institutions will be made by the district managers within \neach city based on need and approved by city councils. \n \n\n2. \n\nPart B: Enterprise Resource Management \n\na. \n\nManagement Information System, Accounting, and Financial \nManagement \n\n25. \nThis subcomponent will develop the city, vodokanal enterprises, and tazalyk enterprises \nmanagement  information  system,  install  accounting  software  to  improve  cities'  accounting \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fpractices,  and  improve  the  city's  financial  management  capacity  focusing  on  revenue \nenhancement measures (e.g., improved collection of taxes and user charges) and expenditure \nmanagement  measures.  It  will  also  improve  existing  complaint  redress  systems.  A  domestic \nMIS and accounting consultant firm will provide assistance under the subcomponent. \n \n\nb. \n\nGeographic Information System, Asset Inventory, and Management \n\n26. \nThis  subcomponent  will  procure  satellite  imagery  for  the  Balykchy,  Cholpon\u2013Ata,  and \nKarakol and will develop city base maps. Asset (including technical and condition) information \non sewerage, solid waste management, water supply, and roads will be plotted and a database \ncreated for future planning. Based on accurate plans of the water supply and sewerage network, \nthe  design  and  supervision  consultants  will  develop  a  calibrated  network  model  to  assess \nsystem  performance  and  plan  for  extensions  and  reinforcements.  A  domestic  geographic \ninformation system (GIS) consultant firm will provide assistance under the subcomponent.  \n \n\nc. \n\nTwinning Program and Capacity Building \n\nintroduce  measures \n\nThis  subcomponent  will  develop  vodokanal  enterprises  capacity  and  (i)  improve  urban \n27. \ninfrastructure  asset  planning  and  management  practices;  (ii)  improve  human  resources \nmanagement;  (iii) \nto  reduce  nonrevenue  water;  and  (iv)  ensure \nenvironmentally compliant effluent discharge and sludge disposal. A twinning agreement will be \nentered  into  with  a  water  supply  and  sanitation  utility  from  a  developed  or  developing  ADB \nmember country,13 and specific improvement targets will agree to be achieved at the end of the \ntwinning program. The program will span 3 years. \n \n\nd. \n\nPerformance-Based Service Contracts \n\n28. \nThis  subcomponent  will  develop  performance-based  service  contracts  for  water  supply \nmanagement, sewerage management, solid waste collection and transport, and sanitary landfill \nmanagement focusing on performance efficiencies. Entering into performance-based contracts \nis contingent on completion of asset inventory and construction works, and improving financial \nmanagement  practices  in  the  cities.  Performance-based  contracts  will  be  concluded  between \ncities and service utilities for water supply and sanitation and solid waste management services.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPart C: Project Assistance Facility \n\na. \n\nInfrastructure Design and Implementation \n\nto  help \n\nthe  PMO  and  PIO  (i)  strengthen \n\nConsulting  services  will  be  provided  through  a  domestic  design  and  supervision \n29. \nconsultant \ntheir  project  management  and \nimplementation  capabilities;  (ii)  prepare  detailed  engineering  designs  for  the  infrastructure \nimprovement  component  of  each  city;  (iii)  assist  in  bid  process  management;  (iv)  support \nconstruction  supervision  and  quality  control  of  civil  works;  and  (v)  contribute  to  benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation by generating baseline data, assessing project impact, and providing \nfeedback  to  the  PMO  to  make  adjustments.  The  DSC  will  be  engaged  to  carry  out  works  in \nfuture phases implemented during the Project period. \n \n\nb. \n\nInformation, Education, and Communication Campaign \n\n30. \nThe  PIO  will  promote  community  awareness  of  the  Project  through  an  information, \neducation,  and  communication  (IEC)  campaign,  which  will  also  communicate  the  Project's  \nlong-term  benefits.  This  will  increase  support  from  project  beneficiaries  and  stimulate  demand \n                                                 \n13  Potential countries include Armenia and Singapore. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\ffor better urban basic services. Beneficiaries will also be made aware of issues such as water \nrates,  user  charges,  and  solid  waste  management  fees.  Among  others,  beneficiaries  will  be \ninformed  on  preventing  environmental  health-related  hazards  and  their  responsibilities  for \nreducing inefficient water use. Hygiene and sanitation education will form a key component of \nthe  IEC  campaign.  A  domestic  IEC  consultant  firm  or  nongovernment  organization  or  civil \nsociety organization will be appointed to assist the PIO. \n \n\nc. \n\nProject Management and Administration \n\nGovernment appointed staff will manage and administer the Project with assistance from \n31. \ninternational  and  domestic  consultants.  This  subcomponent  will  provide  project  oversight, \nquality  control,  ensure  safeguard  compliance,  and  undertake  social  development  through  the \nproject implementation period. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n32. \nThe  Project  is  ADB's  first  urban  sector  intervention  in  Kyrgyz  Republic.  Its  special \nfeatures  include  (i)  the  enterprise  resource  management  subcomponent  addressing  long-term \nurban  management  in  the  region;  and  (ii)  the  assessment  of  institutional,  legal,  and  municipal \nfinances in  the  urban  centers  of  Issyk\u2013Kul  Oblast.  Improved  enterprise  resource  management \nunderpins  ADB's  urban  services  sector  strategy  for  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  insights  from  this \ncomponent will facilitate ADB's urban development programs in Central Asia and the Caucasus. \nDevelopment  of  performance-based  service  contracts  will  also  improve  the  opportunities  for \npublic\u2013private partnerships in the water supply and sanitation sector. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n33. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $37.5 million, including taxes and duties of \n$3.17  million  (Table  1).  Appendix  6  summarizes  the  Project's  detailed  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan, and Supplementary Appendix A provides a breakdown of cost estimates. \n \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\n \n\nAmount  \n\nComponent \n\nBase Cost a \nPart A: Infrastructure Improvement \nPart B: Enterprise Resource Management \nPart C: Project Assistance Facility \n    Subtotal (A) \nContingencies b \nPhysical Contingencies \nPrice Contingencies \n    Subtotal (B) \nTaxes and Duties \nFinancing Charges c \nInterest During Construction \n    Subtotal (D) \n \n \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \nB. \n \n \n \nC. \nD. \n \n \n \n \na \nb   Physical contingencies computed at 6% for all items.

Based  on  the \ncities\u2019 fiscal assessments, the Government confirmed that city operating accounts barely break \neven, leaving no flexibility for counterpart funding or repaying debt early in the project. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n36. \nThe Project will be managed and administered through a combination of a central-level \nsteering  committee,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (Executing  Agency),  a  PMO  at  the  central-level \nwithin  the  EA,  and  a  PIO  under  the  Issyk\u2013Kul  Oblast  administration  (Implementing  Agency). \nBRD  and  IDEP  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  environmental  management  and \nmonitoring plans and ensuring project compliance with ADB and Kyrgyz Republic environmental \nsafeguards.  Appendix  7  summarizes  the  project  implementation  arrangements.  The  financial \nmanagement assessment of the EA is summarized in Supplementary Appendix B and rates its \nfinancial  management  and  reporting  and  monitoring  systems  capabilities  as  satisfactory.  With \n\n                                                 \n14  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  classified  as  a  group  A  developing  member  country  based  on  its  macroeconomic  condition. \nGroup A is eligible for ADF funds only (ADB. 2008. Operations Manual. OM A1/BP: Classification and Graduation \nof  Developing  Member  Countries.  Manila).  The  loan  and  grant  mix  is  finalized  based  on  a  performance-based \nallocation formula defined in ADB. 2008. Operations Manual. OM Section A3/BP: Performance-Based Allocation of \nAsian Development Fund Resources. Manila. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fexperience on previous and ongoing externally financed projects, the Ministry of Finance as the \nEA creates a low-risk environment for the Project.  \n \n\na. \n\nSteering Committee \n\nA  central-level  steering  committee  will  be  set  up  within  1  month  of  loan  and  grant \n37. \neffectiveness,  with  full  powers  to  decide  on  matters  related  to  the  Project.  A  representative  of \nthe Prime Minister's Office will be the steering committee's chairperson. The steering committee \nwill oversee progress on the action plan under the President's Decree related to the Issyk\u2013Kul \ndevelopment concept (para. 18) and will be primarily responsible for guiding development in the \nIssyk\u2013Kul  Oblast.  The  steering  committee  will  use  the  project  outcome  to  frame  policies  on \nwater  supply  and  sanitation,  and  institutional  effectiveness  for  the  country's  urban  sector \ndevelopment. \n \n38. \nThe  steering  committee  will  have  members  from  relevant  Ministries  and  other  state \nentities  as  the  Government  thinks  necessary.  The  PMO  will  be  the  steering  committee's \nsecretariat,  and  the  EA  will  convene  regular  meetings  in  consultation  with  the  chairperson, \nprepare  and  circulate  minutes  of  the  meeting  approved  by  the  chairperson,  and  ensure \ncompliance  with  all  steering  committee  decisions.  The  steering  committee  will  meet  at  least \nonce every 3 months, and the tenure of the steering committee will last until project completion. \n \n\nb. \n\nExecuting Agency \n\n39. \nThe  EA  will  be  responsible  for  project  oversight.  It  will  hold  monthly  meetings  with  the \nPMO and submit progress reports to the steering committee for decision making. It will ensure \nthat project component technical and ecological expertise is sought before awarding contracts \nand/or  commencement  of  construction  works.  The  EA  will  obtain  ADB  approval  for  project \ncomponent  financing,  ensure  compliance  with  project  covenants,  coordinate  with  ADB  on \nmatters  related  to  disbursements,  and  submit  project  documents  (including  audit  reports)  to \nADB  on  time.  It  will  play  an  active  role  in  monitoring  the  Project's  enterprise  resource \nmanagement  component.  Specifically  related  to  the  procurement  process,  the  EA  will  monitor \nand review the bid process and coordinate with ADB on all approvals. \n \n\nc. \n\nProject Management Office \n\n40. \nA  central-level  PMO  will  be  established  at  the  EA.  The  PMO  will  be  led  by  a  full-time \nproject director who will be responsible for overall project management and administration. This \nproject director will be supported by a fiduciary unit comprising a procurement expert, financial \nmanager, domestic project performance monitoring specialist, an office manager/translator, and \noffice  support.  The  PMO  will  (i)  oversee  project  accounting  and  auditing;  (ii)  secure  technical \nexpertise  and  ecological  expertise  for  all  civil  works  prior  to  bidding;  (iii)  carry  out  project \nperformance  monitoring  system  surveys;  (iv)  ensure  city  administrations  comply  with  project \ncovenants;  (v)  with  assistance  of  the  Project  consultants,  invite  bids,  evaluate  them,  and \nprepare  bid  evaluation  reports  for  the  EA  and,  subsequently,  for  ADB  approval;  (vi)  award \ncontracts; and (vii) prepare quarterly progress reports. \n \n\nd. \n\nProject Implementation Office \n\n41. \nAn  oblast-level  PIO,  led  by  a  full-time  project  manager,  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nproject  implementation  and  supervision,  and  will  report  directly  to  the  project  director  and \ngovernor  of  Issyk\u2013Kul  Oblast.  The  project  manager  will  be  assisted  by  three  international \nspecialists  (for  water  supply  and  sanitation,  environmental  management,  and  solid  waste \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fmanagement),  a  domestic  social  and  gender  development  specialist,  accountant,  office \nmanager/translator, information technology specialist, and other support staff members. \n \n42. \nThe PIO will (i) manage detailed surveys, investigations, and engineering designs for all \nsubcomponents;  (ii)  update  the  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and  environmental \nmanagement  and  monitoring  plan;  (iii)  administer  contracts  (with  support  from  vodokanal \nenterprise and tazalyk enterprise at the city level), and ensure quality control; (iv) evaluate work \ndone  by  contractors,  and  certify  payments;  (v)  implement  the  gender  action  plan;  and  (vi) \nconduct  public  awareness  campaigns  and  participation  programs.

Appendix  8  summarizes  the \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n43. \nproject implementation schedule. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nThe  PMO  will  procure  works,  goods,  and  services  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n44. \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended to date) based on the procurement plan presented \nin Appendix 9. The procurement plan is for an 18-month period and will be updated annually by \nthe EA. Civil works, equipment, and material will be procured through international competitive \nbidding (ICB) and national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures as appropriate. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nCivil  works  includes  rehabilitation  of  sewerage  systems  (two  ICB  contracts), \nwater  supply  improvement  (two  ICB  contracts),  construction  of  sanitary  landfills \n(ICB  and  NCB  contracts,  turnkey),  and  construction  of  community  water  and \nsanitation facilities (three NCB contracts).   \nGoods  include  equipment  and  selected  materials  for  vodokanal  enterprises, \ntazalyk  enterprises,  and  the  PMO  (one  ICB  contract),  environmental  monitoring \nequipment  for  IDEP  and  BRD  (one  NCB  contract)  and  waste  collection  and \nassociated equipment (one NCB contract). ADB\u2019s shopping procedures will apply \nto off-the-shelf items and standard products costing the equivalent of $100,000 or \nless. \n\n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n45. \nConsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended to date) using quality- and cost-based selection for firms \nand government procedures acceptable to ADB for individuals. Simplified technical proposals or \nfull  technical  proposals,  as  appropriate,  will  be  required  from  firms.  Outline  terms  of  reference \nfor consulting firms are detailed in Supplementary Appendixes C through F. The EA will ensure \nthat position-based terms of reference (for each expert) will be used when it invites shortlisted \nconsultants. Details on consulting services are elaborated in Appendix 9. \n \nIndividual  Specialists.  The  PMO  will  appoint  six  individual  specialists  to  support  the \n46. \nPMO  and  PIO \ninternational  specialists  (40  \nperson-months  of  water  and  sewerage,  environmental  management,  and  solid  waste \nmanagement  strategy  development)  will  provide  third-party  quality  assurance  on  engineering \ndesigns  and  construction  supervision,  update  the  environmental  impact  assessment  and \n\nin  overseeing  consulting  services.  Three \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nto \n\nreduce  waste  generation  and  disposal.  Three  domestic  specialists \n\naccordingly  revise  the  environmental  management  plan,  and  develop  a  waste  management \nstrategy \n(90  \nperson-months  of  project  performance  monitoring,  social  and  gender  development,  and \nprocurement expertise) will assist the PIO. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n47. \nTo  facilitate  timely  implementation  of  the  Project,  ADB  has  approved  (i)  advance \ncontracting; and (ii) retroactive financing of eligible expenditures up to 20% of the proposed loan \nand  grant,  incurred  prior  to  effectiveness  but  not  earlier  than  12  months  before  the  date  of \nsigning  of  the  Financing  Agreement.  The  Government  acknowledges  that  any  approval  of \nadvance  contracting  and/or  retroactive  financing  will  not  constitute  a  commitment  by  ADB  to \nfinance the related Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n48. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  Ministry  of  Finance.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  loan  and  grant  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the \nright  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nTransparency and Good Governance \n\n49. \nFor greater transparency and accountability, the Government will disclose to the public, \nand  update  annually,  the  current  status  of  the  Project  and  how  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  and \ngrant are used. For each contract financed under the Project, the EA will disclose on its and the \nProject's website information on (i) the list of participating bidders; (ii) the name of the winning \nbidder; (iii) basic details on bidding procedures and procurement methods adopted; (iv) amount \nof contract awarded; (v) the list of goods and services, including consulting services procured; \nand (vi) the intended and actual use of the loan and grant proceeds. \n \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nLoan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed \n\n50. \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  An  imprest  account  will  be \nestablished  by  the  EA  separately  for  the  loan  and  grant  component  with  a  commercial  bank \nacceptable  to  ADB,  to  expedite  project  implementation  through  timely  releases.  The  EA  is \nconversant  with  financial  management  of  project  funds  as  established  through  the  financial \nmanagement agreement. The amount to be deposited into each imprest account will not exceed \n10%  of  the  respective  loan  or  grant,  or  the  estimated  expenditure  to  be  funded  through  each \nimprest  account  for  the  next  6  months,  whichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be \nestablished, managed, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \nand  detailed  arrangements  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and  ADB. 15  ADB\u2019s  statement-of-\nexpenditure procedure may be used to reimburse eligible expenditure and to liquidate advances \nmade into the imprest accounts. Any individual payments to be liquidated or reimbursed will not \nexceed the equivalent of $100,000. \n\n                                                 \n15 Bank charges will be financed from the loan and grant amount. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n51. \nDetailed  consolidated  annual  project  accounts,  as  maintained  by  the  PMO,  will  be \naudited  by  duly  qualified  and  independent  auditors  and  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  6 \nmonths  of  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year.  The  annual  audit  report  will  also  include  a  separate \naudit  opinion  on  the  use  of  imprest  accounts  and  statement-of-expenditure  procedure.  The \nProject will maintain separate records and accounts by funding source (loan and grant). \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n52. \nThe  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  project  performance  monitoring \nsystem is established within 6 months of loan and grant effectiveness. The project performance \nmonitoring system will track project implementation activities, target dates, expected outcomes, \nand assigned responsibilities. Some tasks will be outsourced to external contractors; others will \nform  part  of  routine  PMO  reporting.  Monitoring  indicators  will  be  formulated,  discussed,  and \nagreed to by the EA, oblast and city administrations, SAEPF, and ADB. Within 6 months of loan \nand  grant  effectiveness,  the  PMO  will  conduct  initial  baseline  physical  and  socioeconomic \nsurveys  and  submit  a  detailed  implementation  plan  for  benchmarking  information  and \nmonitoring  performance.  This  will  be  subject  to  ADB\u2019s  review  and  concurrence.  The  PMO  will \nsubmit annual reports to ADB through the project period. \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\n53. \nProject performance will be reviewed first by the EA, second by the steering committee, \nand  third  by  ADB.  The  first-level  review  will  be  conducted  every  month  by  the  EA.  It  will  be \nbased on monthly performance reports for each project city, prepared by the PMO. The report \nwill  be  sent  to  the  oblast  administration,  EA,  steering  committee,  and  ADB.  The  second-level \nreview  will  be  conducted  every  quarter  by  the  steering  committee.  The  monthly  reports  on \nproject  performance,  major  policy  issues,  and  actions  required  or  taken  by  the  respective \nauthorities  will  be  reviewed.  The  results  will  be  circulated  to  ADB,  EA,  oblast  and  city \nadministrations, and SAEPF. The third-level review will be conducted by ADB every 6 months \nthroughout the project implementation period. A comprehensive midterm review will be carried \nout 24 months after the date of loan and grant effectiveness to identify problems or weaknesses \nin implementation arrangements and to agree on any corrective measures. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nMajor Benefits and Impacts \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional and Policy \n\nThe  Project  strongly  hinges  on  institutional  effectiveness  and  building  strong  local  \n\n54. \nself-governments to manage urban basic services. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nIt  will  improve  financial  management  practices  in  the  project  cities,  vodokanal \nenterprises, and tazalyk enterprises, and create a culture of generating revenue \nsurpluses for equity investments into capital assets or leverage for debt.  \nThe database on asset inventory and conditions will help vodokanal enterprises \nidentify infrastructure improvements in the long term based on a well-developed \nasset management and maintenance system.  \nThrough  the  twinning  program,  vodokanal  enterprises  will build  staff capacity  to \nefficiently manage services.   \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nLessons learned will provide the Government with (i) approaches to develop the national \n55. \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  policy;  (ii)  a  basis  for  developing  a  water  supply  and  sanitation \ninvestment  plan  to  upgrade  and  expand  water  supply  and  sanitation  systems;  (iii)  pointers  to \nimprove  financial  management  in  local  governments  across  urban  centers  in  the  country;  and \n(iv) opportunities to develop vodokanal enterprises' staff capacity through a twinning network in \nthe  region.  Supplementary  Appendix  G  provides  insights  into  the  institutional  and  financial \nsustainability  approach  under  the  Project,  providing  a  backdrop  for  future  urban  sector \ndevelopment in the country. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial \n\n56. \nThe primary beneficiaries of the Project are the residents of the three cities and tourists. \nSome  households  will  benefit  manifold,  as  they  will  experience  improvement  in  water  supply, \nsanitation, and solid waste management services. More specifically, they include (i) households \nthat are impacted when members suffer from waterborne illnesses resulting from insufficient or \npoor-quality water; (ii) people using markets, hospitals, clinics, and other public institutions with \npoor water supply and sanitation facilities (e.g., public toilets); (iii) schoolchildren and teachers \nat  schools  with  poor  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities;  and  (iv)  poor  households  using  pit \nlatrines  and  lacking  community  septic  tanks.  General  and  more  widespread  benefits  are \nexpected  from  the  development  of  sanitary  landfills  and  improvements  to  solid  waste \nmanagement practices, and connecting households, hotels, guesthouses, and institutions to the \nrehabilitated  sewerage  system.  Appendix  10  summarizes  the  Project's  poverty  reduction  and \nsocial strategy. \n \nThe  poverty  and  social  assessment  indicates  that  women  strongly  support  the  Project \n57. \nacross all components. Women perceive that the Project will improve their living environments, \ncreate  employment  opportunities,  and  reduce  the  incidence  of  waterborne  illnesses  and \nassociated costs. Implementation of the gender action plan detailed in Appendix 11 will enhance \nbenefits to women through a training and awareness-raising program focusing on drinking water \nsafety,  water  source  protection  and  treatment,  water  and  environmental  sanitation  and \ndiseases, toilet renovation, and hygiene and sanitation education. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n58. \nFinancial  analysis  and  cash-flow  statements  were  prepared  for  vodokanal  enterprises \nand tazalyk enterprises. Fiscal analysis of city finances was also conducted to determine long-\nterm  prospects  of  generating  revenue  surpluses  to  provide  equity  for  capital  investments  or \ncollateral  for  leveraging  debt.  Appendix  12  summarizes  the  project  financial  analysis,  and \nSupplementary Appendix H provides the spreadsheets. Results indicate the following. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe Project is financially viable, and the average financial internal rate of return \nin the base case is 15.90% for water supply and sanitation and 15.40% for solid \nwaste management, exceeding the weighted average cost of capital estimated at \n15.36%. The average financial net present value in the base case is $0.27 million \nfor  water  supply  and  sanitation  and  $0.02  million  for  solid  waste  management. \nSensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  subcomponent  financial  internal  rates  of \nreturn are stressed under various conditions, implying a need for efficient project \nimplementation and rapidly achieved physical and financial targets.  \nThe cities' financial management requires considerable improvements, especially \nefforts  to  enhance  city  own-tax  revenues  and  to  reduce  dependence  on  state \ntransfers  in  the  long-term. 16  The  Project  will  ensure  cities  make  informed \n\n                                                 \n16  State transfers account for approximately 50% of the city's annual operating revenues. \n\n\f(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\ndecisions on revenue enhancement and expenditure management measures by \nimplementing the MIS and accounting subcomponent. \nVodokanal  enterprises  and  tazalyk  enterprises  revenue  base  improvement  is \ncontingent  on  tariff  rationalization.  The  analysis  indicates  a  need  to  raise  tariffs \nsubstantially from the current base to meet system operating costs.17 Tariffs can \nalso be raised only after the system begins to show improved performance and \ncustomers perceive benefits. The Project proposes viability gap funding to bridge \nthe  shortfall  in  revenues  for  2010\u20132015  (during  implementation)  and  for  2016\u2013\n2029  (during  operations)  to  meet  financial  internal  rate  of  return  conditions. \nImplementing the enterprise resource management subcomponent in parallel will \nhelp  improve  the  financial  performance  of  cities,  vodokanal  enterprises,  and \ntazalyk enterprises and reduce dependency on viability gap funding after 2029. \nTo  achieve  an  operating  ratio  less  than  unity,  a  key  determinant  to  assess \nfinancial  performance  of  vodokanal  enterprises  and  tazalyk  enterprises,  the \nProject  will  ensure  (a)  progressive  tariff  increases  based  on  cost  recovery  and \nconsumer  affordability  principles;  and  (b)  that  the  Government  will  make \navailable viability gap funding to ensure service sustainability.  \n\n \n59. \nTo ensure project ownership, state revenue transfers will include viability gap funding to \ncities.  The  funding  will  be  made  contingent  on  vodokanal  enterprises  and  tazalyk  enterprises \nmeeting performance standards set out in the service utilities' annual operations plan ratified by \nthe city councils. For all three cities, current estimates of viability gap funding required to meet \nonly  operating  expenditure  shortfalls  is  $6.5  million  during  2010\u20132015  and  $8  million  during \n2016\u20132029.  The  actual  viability  gap  funding  will  be  established  by  January  2012  based  on \nenterprise resource management component outputs. \n \n\n4. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nEconomic analysis was based on the results of a socioeconomic survey and drew from \n60. \nrelevant  statistics  available  at  the  country  level,  especially  that  available  from  the  National \nStatistics Committee. The socioeconomic survey covered 514 households, randomly sampled in \nthe  three  project  cities.  Focus  group  discussions  provided  further  substantiation  on  service \nperception  and  demand  for  services.  Appendix  13  summarizes  the  economic  analysis,  and \nSupplementary Appendix I provides the spreadsheets. Results indicate the following. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Project  is  economically  viable,  and  the  average  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn in the base case is 27.8% for water supply and sanitation and 19.5% for \nsolid  waste  management,  exceeding  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital \nassumed  at  12.0%.  The  average  economic  net  present  value  in  the  base  case \nwas  $3.17  million  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  and  $0.69  million  for  solid \nwaste  management.  A  sensitivity  analysis  conducted  to  test  the  robustness  of \neconomic  viability  indicated  that  in  all  cases,  subcomponent  economic  internal \nrates of return surpass the economic opportunity cost of capital.   \nThe  average  economic  benefit\u2013cost  ratio  for  the  Project  was  1.42  for  water \nsupply and sanitation and 1.21 for solid waste management, denoting feasibility. \nEconomic  benefits  were  derived  based  on  resource  cost  savings  (e.g.,  time \nsavings and coping costs savings), health benefits, and benefits from expanding \n\n                                                 \n17  The  estimated  average  annual  operating  expenditure  for  water  and  sanitation  is  180%  of  the  estimated  annual \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  revenue.  The  average  annual  operating  expenditure  for  solid  waste  management  is \n200% of the estimated annual revenue. The viability gap fund was estimated for the following scenarios: (i) to meet \noperation and maintenance costs alone; (ii) to meet operation and maintenance costs and depreciation; and (iii) to \nmeet  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  depreciation,  and  debt  (as  a  determinant  of  commercially  viable \noperations). \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\nthe  existing  water  supply.  Economic  capital  and  annual  operation  and \nmaintenance costs were derived from financial cost estimates.  \n\n5. \n\nEnvironmental Safeguards \n\nThe Project was classified as environmental category A under ADB's Environment Policy \n61. \n(2002)  as  its  subcomponents  are  located  in  the  Issyk\u2013Kul  Biosphere  Reserve,  which  includes \nseveral  protected  wetlands  registered  under  the  Ramsar  Convention.  As  part  of  the  project \npreparatory technical assistance,18 an environmental impact assessment (EIA) was carried out \nfor  all  subcomponents.  Early  in  the  environmental  assessment  process,  relevant  environment \ninformation  was  disclosed  to  likely  affected  people  through  stakeholder  consultations, \nworkshops,  and  focus  group  discussions.  The  summary  EIA  report  in  Russian  was  also \ndisclosed  by  city  governments  and  reviewed  by  SAEPF  and  its  regional  departments.  News \narticles  in  local  newspapers  preceded  the  consultations,  indicating  the  EIA  content  and  its \navailability with the city governments. Stakeholder comments from consultations were integrated \ninto the Project. In accordance with ADB's Public Communications Policy (2005), the summary \nEIA  was  posted  on  the  ADB  website  on  1  June  2009  to  meet  the  120-day  disclosure \nrequirement before Board consideration of the Project. The EIA is in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \n62. \nTo ensure that the biosphere reserve is not affected by project activities, subcomponents \nhave  been  suitably  located.  Location  of  sanitary  landfills  is  critical.  In  Balykchy  and  \nCholpon\u2013Ata, the project component sites are located in areas designated for improvement, and \nin Karakol, the project component site is in the transition zone.  \n \nAn  efficient,  detailed  engineering  design  will  mitigate  any  localized  and/or  temporary \n63. \nimpacts.  Relevant  environmental  mitigation  measures  specified \nthe  ADB-approved \nenvironmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  will  be  updated  during  detailed  engineering \ndesign  and  be  incorporated  in  bidding  documents  and  civil  works  contracts.  Impacts  during \noperations will be mitigated through effective implementation of the environmental management \nplan. The following measures will mitigate key impacts.  \n\nin \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nLocation.  Buffer  zones  within  and  buffer  strips  with  restricted  development \naround  sanitary  landfill  sites  will  mitigate  moderate  but  permanent  location \nimpacts. \nConstruction. Good construction techniques, provision of standby equipment in \ncase  of  power  failures  and  disruptions,  soil  surface  stabilization,  and  safe \ndisposal of contaminated water and oil will mitigate moderate to severe impacts. \nThe  impacts  are  anticipated  from  groundwork  and  transport  activities;  exhaust, \ngas,  oil,  and  fuel  spills;  and  soil  excavation  and  storage  causing  runoffs  and  \nsoil-level alteration. \nSeismic  activity.  Hydrogeological  and  geotechnical  investigations  will  form  the \nbasis  for  designs,  choice  of  materials,  and  construction  methods  to  mitigate \nsevere impacts through structural damage and sinking of foundations and soil. \nOperations.  Effective \nimplementation  of  sludge  management  plans, \noccupational  and  safety  plans,  and  emergency  response  plans  will  mitigate \nsystem operations impacts resulting from leaks, spillovers, and sludge disposal; \nwindblown  waste;  gases  emitted  from  landfills;  and  improper  closure  of  existing \ndumps.  \n\n \nThe  state  ecological  expertise,  complying  with  Kyrgyz  Republic  laws  on  environmental \n64. \nclearance,  will  be  made  mandatory  before  bidding,  and  no  contracts  will  be  awarded  without \n\n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to Kyrgyz Republic for the Issyk\u2013Kul Sustainable Development Project. Manila. \n\n\fsecuring  approval  from  the  state  ecological  expertise.  Kyrgyz  Republic  regulations  on  official \npublic  participation  through  the  public  ecological  expertise  will  form  a  core  part  of  the  Project. \nThe public ecological expertise involves citizens, local administrations, and public associations, \nusually  represented  by  a  nongovernment  organization  known  as  the  independent  ecological \nexpertise.  The  independent  ecological  expertise  will  provide  third-party  quality  assurance  and \nensure  effective  environmental  management  plan  implementation;  it  will  also  address  public \ngrievances through the public ecological expertise process. \n \nThe environmental management and monitoring plan will be implemented by BRD  and \n65. \nIDEP.  IDEP  will  be  directly  responsible  for  mitigating  and  monitoring  impacts  during  project \ndesign,  construction,  and  operation.  BRD  will  complement  IDEP's  activities  through  a  parallel \nmonitoring  function  and  ensure  that  project  activities  comply  with  environmental  regulations \nwithin  the  biosphere  reserve.  The  Project  will  ensure  both  IDEP  and  BRD  are  adequately \nequipped to perform these functions. It will ensure institutional effectiveness through on-the-job \ntraining  in  inspection  and  monitoring  techniques  and  fund  the  procurement  of  monitoring  and \nlaboratory  equipment  for  effective  environmental  management  plan  implementation.  The \ninternational  environment  specialist  at  the  PIO  will  provide  training  to  staff  members  on \nmonitoring and mitigation activities and ensure that the plan is updated as required. \n \n\n6. \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\nThe Project will not have any land acquisition and resettlement impact as documented in \n66. \ndue  diligence  reports  prepared  for  each  of  the  three  project  cities  and  included  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  K.  The  Project  has  chosen  existing  sites  for  siting  bulk  facilities  and \nmade  all  efforts  to  avoid  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  by  choosing  appropriate \ndesign  options  and  by  prioritizing  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  existing  facilities.  New \nconstruction,  to  the  extent  feasible,  will  be  done  on  unused  land  already  owned  by  the \nGovernment. The due diligence reports were prepared recognizing ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement (1995) and applicable laws and regulations of Kyrgyz Republic. The Project is not \nexpected  to  affect  indigenous  people  as  defined  under  ADB's  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples \n(1998).  The  project  areas  are  fairly  homogenous,  with  majority  Kyrgyz  and  other  ethnic \nminorities comprising Kazakhs, Russians, and Uzbeks. These ethnic groups do not differ in their \nneeds or levels of water supply or sanitation services, and all will benefit from project activities. \n \nB. \n\nMajor Risks and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nRisks \n\n67. \nPotential  risks  associated  with  the  Project  include  (i)  lack  of  commitment  by  city \nadministrations  to  undertake  or  implement  reforms  in  urban  and  financial  management,  and \ninability to implement the financial improvement action plan; (ii) inability of government staff to \nimplement the environmental management and monitoring plan; (iii) sudden increase in cost of \nconstruction  items;  (iv)  insufficient  incentives  by  the  Government  to  ensure  vodokanal \nenterprises and tazalyk enterprises staff provide efficient service delivery; and (v) lack of viability \ngap funding from the Government to sustain urban services. \n \n\n2. \n\nMitigation Measures \n\n68. \nEarly establishment of the PMO and PIO and commencement of surveys for engineering \ndesigns  and  information,  education,  and  communication  campaign  to  generate  community \nawareness  will  mitigate  start-up  delays.  Efficiently  functioning  PMO  and  PIO  will  ensure  the \nproject  is  completed  on  time  and  sudden  price  rise  of  construction  items  is  adequately \naccommodated. The Prime Minister's Office has direct control over the Project's objectives and \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\fwill  monitor  activities,  improving  the  urban  management  and  financial  performance  of  cities. \nAppointing  the  Ministry  of  Finance  as  the  Executing  Agency  cements  commitment  for  viability \ngap funding as a key line item in the national budget as the Ministry of Finance prepares and \ndisburses funds under the medium-term budgetary framework. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  Ministry  of  Finance  have \n\n69. \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal document. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nin \n\nThe Government will establish the steering committee and hold the first meeting \nno later than 3 months following loan and grant effectiveness. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  smooth  fund  flow  in  accordance  with  the  agreed \nmechanism.

It  is  located  east  of  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina and south of Kazakhstan, and it also shares borders with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The \nTian  Shan  mountain  range  covers  80%  of  the  country,  while  the  remainder  is  valleys  and \nbasins.  Lake  Issyk\u2013Kul,  in  northwestern  Tian  Shan,  is  the  second-largest  saline  lake  in  the \nworld  and  a  major  tourist  attraction.  The  population  of  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  estimated  at  5.2 \nmillion  (50.7%  women  and  49.3%  men),  of  which  1.8  million  (35%)  live  in  urban  areas.  The \ncountry's population density is 26 persons per square kilometer, which is relatively low.  \n \n2. \nThere are 25 urban settlements in Kyrgyz Republic. Both country and urban populations \nhave been increasing, but at a declining rate. The urban population increased from 1.10 million \nin 1970 to 1.67 million in 1990, and to 1.80 million in 2007. The growth rate, however, declined \nfrom  3.4%  in  1970  to  1.6%  in  1990,  and  to  1.3%  in  2007.  Furthermore,  the  percent  of  urban \npopulation has declined from 38% in 1990 to about 35% in 1998, and it has remained relatively \nsteady since then. Both the country and urban populations are expected to grow at 1% over the \nnext 20 years\u2014the urban population is expected to reach 2.2 million by 2030.  \n \n3. \nKyrgyz Republic is a low-income country, and the gross domestic product per capita was \n$715 in 2007. In 2005, 43.1% of the population lived below the national poverty line. In urban \nareas,  29.8%  of  population  lived  below  the  poverty  line,  and  in  rural  areas,  50.8%  of  the \npopulation lived below the poverty line. Also, unlike rural poverty, urban poverty has decreased \nsignificantly from 41.2% in 2001 to 35.7% in 2003, and to 29.8% in 2005. Unemployment was \nrelatively low at 8.27% in 2006, but it may have increased since then due to the global economic \ncrisis.  \n \n4. \nAdult literacy is high, at 99.3% for the adult population. There is little difference in literacy \nbetween  genders,  with  99.0%  literacy  among  adult  females  and  99.5%  literacy  among  adult \nmales. Primary school enrollment is high at 95.3% of the total population, with a completion rate \nof  94.7%.  Secondary  enrollment  is  86.4%  of  the  total  population,  and  tertiary  enrollment  is \n42.8% of the total population.  \n \n5. \nLife expectancy at birth is 65.3 years as measured for 2000\u20132005. The infant mortality \nrate in 2005 was 58 deaths per 1,000 live births, and the under age 5 years mortality rate was \n67 per 1,000 live births. The human development index is 0.696, which ranks Kyrgyz Republic \n116th out of 177 countries in the United Nations 2007/2008 Human Development Report.1 This \nranking  reflects  both  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2014it  scores  well  in \nliteracy and education, but is dragged down by low incomes and short life expectancy. Kyrgyz \nRepublic  scores  0.692  on  the  gender-related  development  index  and  ranks  it  53  out  of  156 \ncountries in the report, and shows reasonably high gender equality in Kyrgyz Republic.  \n \nUrban  Services  in  Kyrgyz  Republic.  Although  most  of  the  urban  population  lives  in \n6. \nSoviet-style  apartment  blocks,  some  live  in  novostroiki.  About  56.0%  of  urban  residents  have \npiped water in their homes, and another 42.3% rely on street water taps. Water quality is poor; \nin  2007,  about  11%  of  water  tests  failed  on  microbiological  parameters.  The  water  quantity  is \nlimited, and the supply is intermittent. Most of the water supply infrastructure was built in 1960s \n\n                                                 \n1  United Nations Development Programme. 2007.

In  addition,  about  75%  of  the  urban  population  has  access  to \nsanitation services. Population access to sewerage facilities is 21%\u2014in Bishkek, it is 78%, while \nin  other  regions,  it  is  about  10%.  Most  sewage  treatment  plants  are  not  operational,  or  are \nbarely  operational.  Waterborne  illnesses,  such  as  typhoid  and  parasitic  diseases,  are  a  major \nproblem. Finally, solid waste collection and disposal systems are inadequate. Data on the solid \nwaste management are scarce, but 1997 statistics indicate that only 28.5% of the population is \nserved  by  regular  municipal  waste  collection  services.  Out  of  155  dumps  around  the  country, \nonly one can be considered a full sanitary landfill. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nThere  were  432,556  people  in  Issyk\u2013Kul  Oblast  in  2007,  which  is  around  8%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s total population. In 2007, around 39% of the oblast\u2019s population lived in poverty. There \nare  three  major  cities:  Karakol  (67,500  people),  Balykchy  (42,000  people),  and  Cholpon\u2013Ata \n(12,000). Lake Issyk\u2013Kul is a major tourist area, and the oblast\u2019s population tends to increase \nduring the summer thanks to tourists. Being a protected site, environmental preservation of the \nlake takes high priority when considering the oblast's development. \n \n \n \nWater  supply  services  are  provided  by  vodokanal  enterprises,  which  are  public \n8. \nenterprises.  Water  supply  systems  in  the  three  cities  cover  approximately  85%  of  the \npopulation, were built during the Soviet period, and are in poor condition. Karakol (13,000 cubic \nmeter  per  day)  and  Cholpon\u2013Ata  (5,650  cum  per  day)  use  a  mix  of  surface  and  groundwater \nsources, while Balykchy (28,000 cum per day) only uses groundwater sources. Gross per capita \nproduction is high the three centers at 666 liters per capita per day (lpcd) in Balykchy, 471 lpcd \nin  Cholpon\u2013Ata,  and  192  lpcd  in  Karakol.  All  cities  also  supply  continuous  water  to  the \nconnected  population.  Nonrevenue  water  is  unknown,  and  vodokanal  enterprises  estimates \nrange  from  25%  to  60%.  Net  per  capita  supplies  are  high  due  to  piped  water  being  used  for \nirrigation. The water quality needs substantial improvement as it is biologically contaminated.  \n \n \n \n9. \nVodokanal  enterprises  also  operate  the  sewerage  systems.  Population  access  to \nsewerage systems is low at about 35% or less in the three centers. Sewage treatment plants in \nBalykchy (36,000 cum per day), Cholpon\u2013Ata (25,000 cum per day), and Karakol (22,000 cum \nper day) were constructed on extended aeration technology but now are dilapidated. Only the \nsewage treatment plant in Karakol is partially operational. Much of the population continues to \nrely on pit latrines, which present a serious risk to groundwater contamination and consequent \ncontamination  of  the  lake.  Many  tourist  resorts,  especially  around  Cholpon\u2013Ata,  generate \ndomestic sewage and are required to have their own wastewater treatment facilities. However, \nthe monitoring of operation and discharge quality from these facilities has been inadequate, and \nthe  impact  on  lake  water  quality  is  unknown.  Overall,  the  combination  of  partially  operating \ncentral  sewerage  systems,  private  self-provision  of  sanitation  facilities,  and  lax  monitoring  of \nwastewater discharge from resorts presents a significant threat to lake quality. \n \n \n \nSolid  waste  management  services  are  provided  by  communal  utilities  (tazalyk \n10. \nenterprises), which also take care of town maintenance and services such as street lighting and \npark maintenance. The region has a substantially high per capita waste generation rate at 1.5 \n\nSolid Waste Management \n\nSewerage and Sanitation \n\n3. \n\n2. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n1. \n\nCity Finances \n\nCity and Utility Finances \n\nkilograms  per  person,  with  a  total  daily  waste  of  200  metric  tons  (MT)  generated  in  the  three \ncities, including waste from resorts (e.g., Balykchy, 64 MT; Cholpon\u2013Ata, 34 MT; and Karakol, \n101 MT). About 70%\u201380% of the waste generated is landfill material, while 11%\u201320% is organic \nand  8%\u201312%  is  dry  recyclables.  Domestic  and  commercial  waste  generation  is  at  a  3:1  ratio. \nAbout  50%  of  the  waste  generated  is  collected  and  disposed  at  existing  open  dumps  in  the \nthree  cities.  Safe  disposal  of  medical  waste  is  absent  in  all  cities. 2 In  addition,  the  tazalyk \nenterprises  in  Karakol  and  Cholpon\u2013Ata  are  unable  to  cover  their  operating  costs  from  their \nrevenues,  and  instead  rely  on  budgetary  transfers.  Balykchy\u2019s  tazalyk  enterpise  can  cover  its \noperating costs but relies on budgetary transfers for investments.  \n \nC. \n \n \n \n11. \nIn  2008,  revenue  surplus  on  operating  accounts  was  generated  in  Karakol  ($0.35 \nmillion),  while  both  Balykchy  (\u2013$0.36  million)  and  Cholpon\u2013Ata  (\u2013$0.01  million)  generated \ndeficits.  The  operating  incomes  for  the  cities  varied  from  $1  million  in  Cholpon\u2013Ata  to  $2.8 \nmillion in Karakol. Central transfers constituted 18%\u201351% of operating incomes, while own-tax \nrevenues  accounted  for  39%\u201359%.  Salaries  constituted  34%\u201358%  of  operating  expenditures, \nand  operating  expenditures  ranged  from  $1  million  in  Cholpon\u2013Ata  to  $2.5  million  in  Karakol. \nNontax sources comprising water, sewerage, and solid waste charges were not accounted for \nas  they  form  the  income  base  for  vodokanal  enterprises  and  tazalyk  enterprises,  which  are \nseparate profit centers. \n \nThe operating ratio in Karakol was lower than unity for the 2004\u20132008 period (5 years) \n12. \nindicating prudent financial management. Similar performances were witnessed in Balykchy and \nCholpon\u2013Ata  during  the  years  2006  and  2007.  However,  the  surplus  build-up  is  unable  to \nsubsidize water, sewerage, and solid waste management services and infuse equity or leverage \ndebt for capital creation.  \n \n \n \nThe  vodokanal  enterprises  in  Karakol  and  Balykchy  are  unable  to  recover  operating \n13. \ncosts from their revenues and rely on budgetary support. Cholpon\u2013Ata\u2019s vodokanal enterprise is \njust  able  to  cover  its  operating  costs.  None  of  the  vodokanal  enterprises  are  able  to  cover \ncapital  expenditures.  Vodokanal  enterprises'  operating  income  ranges  from  $0.11  million \n(Karakol) to $0.25 million (Cholpon\u2013Ata). Collections are 70% in Karakol, 90% in Cholpon\u2013Ata, \nand 90% in Balykchy. Domestic water tariffs range from $0.03 per cum in Karakol to $0.09 per \ncum  in  Cholpon\u2013Ata,  while  nondomestic  water  tariffs  range  from  $0.30  per  cum  in  Karakol  to \n$0.48 per cum in Cholpon\u2013Ata. Collections from commercial consumers constitute about 40% of \nthe operating income and are the largest income source. Domestic sewerage tariffs range from \n$0.30 per cum in Karakol to $0.09 per cum in Cholpon\u2013Ata, and nondomestic and commercial \nsewage  charges  range  from  $0.27  per  cum  in  Karakol  and  Balykchy  to  $0.42  per  cum  in \nCholpon\u2013Ata. The current tariffs do not cover operation and maintenance costs. For improved \ncash inflows, vodokanal enterprises must provide better services so customers are willing to pay \nan increased tariff. Investment in assets, operations and maintenance equipment, and training is \nlikely to result in better services. \n \n\nVodokanal Enterprises Finances \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n2   Balykchy alone produces 3 kilograms of placenta daily and lacks appropriate mechanisms to dispose of it. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\n3. \n\nTazalyk Enterprises Finances \n\nVodokanal enterprises expenditures are high due to operational inefficiency arising from \n14. \nthe  aging  system  and  lack  of  vehicles,  tools,  and  equipment.  The  expenses  of  Cholpon\u2013Ata\u2019s \nvodokanal ($0.24 million) are within its operating income, while those of Balykchy ($0.30 million) \nand Karakol ($0.34 million) far exceed their operating incomes, indicating efficient management \nof  services  by  Cholpon\u2013Ata  (the  tariffs  there  are  the  highest  among  the  three  cities).  Staff \nsalaries constitute 32%\u201357% of total expenditure, and electricity, 10%\u201339%. Staffing levels are \nhigh, between 4.5 and 7.0 staff members per 1,000 connections. Water losses are high due to \nleaks and commercial losses in the network.  \n \n \n \n15. \nTazalyk  enterprises'  operating  incomes  range  from  $0.14  million  in  Cholpon\u2013Ata  and \nKarakol  to  $0.48  million  in  Balykchy.  Budget  transfers  and  income  from  customers  constitute \n60% (Cholpon\u2013Ata) to 100% (Karakol) of operating income. Domestic waste management tariffs \n(for individual houses) range from $1.18 per cum in Karakol to $4.36 per cum in Cholpon\u2013Ata; \nnondomestic  tariffs  range  form  $1.09  per  cum  in  Karakol  to  $6.98  per  cum  in  Cholpon\u2013Ata. \nKarakol  indicates  95%  income  collection,  while  Cholpon\u2013Ata  indicates  a  35%  collection \nperformance.  Given  that  both  stated  incomes  remain  similar,  the  demand  in  Cholpon\u2013Ata  is \nvery high, and improved performance will benefit its operations. \n \nOperating  ratios  for  Balykchy  and  Karakol  are  less  than  unity.  Balykchy  has  made \n16. \nsubstantial  efforts  to  improve  tariff  collection,  while  Karakol  depends  on  budget  transfers. \nCholpon\u2013Ata  is  in  debt,  and  its  poor  tariff  collection  is  attributed  to  the  fiscal  status.  Staff  and \noperation and maintenance costs constitute 60% (Cholpon\u2013Ata) to 99% (Karakol) of operating \nexpenditure. Surpluses generated are not ploughed back into capital creation. \n \n17. \nTariffs  (for  water,  sewerage,  and  solid  waste)  are  approved  by  city  councils,  based  on \nsubmissions  made  by  agencies.  They  are  then  assessed  for  appropriateness  by  an \nantimonopoly  committee  in  each  city,  and  the  city  council  passes  a  decree  to  implement  the \ntariffs.  Current  tariffs  in  Balykchy  and  Cholpon\u2013Ata  were  approved  in  2008,  while  Karakol's \ntariffs have not been revised since 2005. \n \nD. \n \n18. \nInadequate basic services hamper the region's economic development\u2014and tourism in \nparticular.  They  also  endanger  Lake  Issyk\u2013Kul  and  its  environment.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nLake Issyk\u2013Kul (\"warm lake\" in Kyrgyz) is the world\u2019s second largest saline lake; a Ramsar site of globally \nsignificant biodiversity; and a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization  \n(UNESCO)-designated biosphere reserve. The lake forms a significant part of Issyk\u2013Kul Oblast, and contributes to \neconomic growth by providing tourism opportunities. Attracting approximately 1 million tourists annually, equivalent \nto 70% of the country\u2019s annual tourist of 1.4 million persons, the lake is a major economic driver in the region.  \n \nIncreasing tourism has resulted in the construction of many resorts that now sprawl around the lake's northern \nshores. However, existing water and sanitation infrastructure (i.e., water, sewerage, solid waste, and roads) is \ndecrepit, dysfunctional, and poorly managed, and unable to serve the high number of tourists, which exceeds the \nresident population by a factor of four. The excessive pressure placed on the existing infrastructure is partially \nresponsible for polluting the lake. \n \nThe country development strategy, 2009\u20132011a, emphasizes environmental sustainability, and its strategic \ninvestment project for the Issyk\u2013Kul region focuses on protecting Lake Issyk\u2013Kul with the Project. In February 2009, \nthe Concept of Sustainable Development of the Ecological and Economic System of Issyk\u2013Kul was passed through \na presidential decree. Based on this, the Government of Kyrgyz Republic passed a resolution in May 2009 that \nprioritizes implementation of the Project. \n \nThe Government has adopted a poverty reduction strategy (now embedded in the country development strategy, \n2009-2011) that seeks to increase opportunities to ensure that citizens have an adequate, equitable, and \ncomfortable life in Kyrgyz Republic. The overall goals of the framework imply a large leap in socioeconomic \ndevelopment through mobilization of domestic resources, effective structural reforms and quality management \n(including bringing in professional managers to foster economic development), improvement of infrastructure, \nintroduction of new technologies and information systems, and active involvement of civil initiatives. In other words, \nsustainable stabilization and dynamic development for the well being of all citizens will guide Kyrgyz Republic to \nprosperity. \n \nAsian Development Bank (ADB)-led investment and policy dialogue will improve the quality of urban services, foster \ntourist growth, and preserve the lake's environment. The assessment of institutional, legal, and municipal finance \nassessments in the oblast will provide a suitable platform for developing ADB's urban services sector development \nstrategy for Kyrgyz Republic. Development of performance-based service contracts will also improve opportunities \nfor public\u2013private partnerships in the water and sanitation sector. \n \nThe Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Water Policyb, and it will help achieve the Millennium Development Goal of \nenvironmental sustainability (goal 7) and specifically address target 10 (to halve the proportion of people without \nsustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015). \nB.  Poverty Analysis \n \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe National Statistics Committee calculates an annual poverty line adjusted to inflation. In 2008, the poverty line \nwas calculated as Som963 ($22) per person per month, with the line of extreme poverty being Som640 ($15) per \nperson per month. Although the national poverty level has decreased from 49% in 2003 to 35% in 2008, poverty \nreduction is larger for rural areas. Based on 2008 data, Issyk\u2013Kul Oblast ranks fourth in terms of poverty incidence, \nwith 39%, and about 8% suffering extreme poverty. The poor account for 19% of the beneficiary population, with the \nextremely poor making up 9%. Within the project area, poverty incidence ranges from 2.6% in Cholpon\u2013Ata, to \n10.4% in Karakol, and to 31.9% in Balykchy.  \n  \nA socioeconomic survey indicated that urban residents' top priority is improved water supply and sanitation services.\n \nWater supply. About one quarter of households and 19% of poor households indicated inadequate water supply for \nhousehold needs. Waterborne illnesses were significant, with 82% of households stating incidences in the past 5 \nyears. Overall, 23% of all people suffering from waterborne illnesses were poor, and the costs of treating such \nillnesses were a significant additional burden. Poor households also lost 75 potential labor days per year due to \nwaterborne illnesses. Therefore, improved water quality is a high priority. \n \n\nTargeting Classification: TI-M \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n43 \n\nSanitation. About 75% of households use dry-pit latrines, and 24% use flush or pour toilets. The poor generally use \npit latrines, which cannot be connected to a centralized system. About 66% of households surveyed stated that they \nwould be willing to pay for connection to a sewerage system, indicating citizen priority for improved sanitation. \n  \nSolid waste management. About 84% of households stated that a municipal collection service was unavailable on \na daily basis. Waste disposal practices included plastic bottle and packaging collection by tazalyk enterprises from \n50% of households, waste incineration by 36% of households, and waste disposal to the nearest landfill or waste \nreceptacle by 8% of households. All poor households stated that they sold household waste for recycling. Increased \ncollection frequency was a stated requirement. \n \nThe social analysis concluded that the poor mostly live in areas without running water supplies, sewage and solid \nwaste collection, and treatment services. They often suffer from serious water supply shortages, poor water quality, \nsewage pollution, and poor urban environmental sanitation.  \n \n2.  Design Features \nThe Project incorporates several strategies to facilitate the ability of households and communities to realize benefits \nfrom water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management improvements and maintenance, thus contributing to \npoverty reduction in the project area, including (i) priorities for employment of local men and women for both \nphysical works and routine maintenance, particularly for poor households; (ii) contractor specifications for provision \nof HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infection awareness and prevention programs for construction crews (physical \nworks) and surrounding communities; (iii) an information, education, and communication campaign to ensure public \nconsultation and a participation program linked to different aspects of project preparation and implementation \n(including participation in monitoring) to be undertaken by the Executing Agency and to continue the consultation \ncommenced during the project preparatory technical assistancec; (iv) a gender action plan focusing on a training \nprogram to deliver increased awareness and knowledge on water drinking safety, water source protection, \ntreatment, water and environmental sanitation and diseases, toilet renovation, health education and promotion; and \n(v) community upgrading initiatives such as improvements in school water supply and sanitation; improvements to \npit latrines used by the poor through community septic tanks; and provision of public toilets in markets, hospitals, \nclinics, and other public institutions. \n\nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nThe population of the project area (i.e., the three urban centers of Balykchy, Cholpon\u2013Ata, and Karakol) is about \n121,500 and is expected to increase to 128,750 by 2015. The household survey indicates that two thirds of \nhouseholds are Kyrgyz, 18% are Russian, 4% are Tajik, and 12% belong to other ethnic groups. Cholpon\u2013Ata \ncomprises the largest proportion of Kyrgyz, with 89%. Overall, some 41% of households are headed by women.  \n \nThe primary beneficiaries of the Project are the residents of the three cities and tourists. Some households will \nexperience improvement in water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management, including (i) households that are \nimpacted when members fall sick due to waterborne illnesses resulting from insufficient or poor-quality water; (ii) \nthose that use markets, hospitals, clinics, and other public institutions that will be provided with improved facilities \n(i.e., public toilets); (iii) schoolchildren and teachers to be provided with improved water supply and sanitation \nfacilities; (iv) poor households using pit latrines that will be improved through provision of community septic tanks; \n(v) general and more widespread benefits from the sanitary landfill and improvements to solid waste management \npractices; and (vi) households, hotels, guesthouses, and institutions connected to the rehabilitated sewerage \nsystem. \n \nHealth benefits. The Project will reduce morbidity and mortality rates from waterborne, vector-borne, and airborne \ndiseases and contribute to savings in associated medical costs and loss of healthy working days. The Project will (i) \nprevent an increase in the incidence of waterborne illnesses arising form contaminated or insufficient water; (ii) \nprevent an associated increase in medical expenses; and (iii) prevent an associated increase in time lost from work, \nthereby leading to loss of income. \n \nEmployment benefits. The Project will create direct short-term employment during the construction phase and \nlong-term employment opportunities during the operation phase (maintenance). A target of 30% short-term \nemployment opportunities will be filled by the poor and women during the construction phase. Since unemployment \nand redundancies within the informal sector (those most likely to be employed on the Project) are the major causes \nof poverty in the project area, the poor will benefit disproportionately from this job creation.  \n\nTourism sector benefits. A small tourism survey of operators and tourists included in the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance was conducted, covering 30 tourists (10 in each city) and 31 tourism service operators (hotels, \ninns, and guest houses). Inadequate water supply and poor sanitation in hotels and guesthouses, and inadequate \nsolid waste collection services (and unclean public places), were indicated as negatively impacting tourism. About \n33% of tourists indicated that water supply and sanitation were poorly managed, but 55% indicated that solid waste \nwas efficiently collected and transported. Clearly, improvements to basic services will have benefits for the tourism \nexperience. \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nOther economic benefits. In addition, improved health and quality of life will increase the capability of people and \nwill promote local economic development. The improved water quality and urban environment will promote \nsustainable economic development and accelerate tourism development where the poor and women are particularly \nlikely to find opportunities, as they make up a large proportion of small-service operators and vendors. \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n Empowerment \n\n Consultation       \n\n Information sharing         \n\n Collaborative decision making      \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nA socioeconomic survey covered 514 respondents who were randomly sampled in the three cities. Stakeholder \nconsultation workshops, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews on urban services, tourism \ndevelopment, and environmental management formed an integral part of the consultation process. Environmental \nimpact assessment and resettlement due diligence report preparation also involved rounds of public consultation. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and \nmonitoring?  \n \n \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nThe Project includes an information, education, and communication campaign comprising (i) a public environment \nand hygiene awareness program at the community level; and (ii) an HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infection \nawareness and prevention program aimed at the construction workforce. The campaign will be implemented in \nparallel with existing environment and health programs. Consultations with communities will be held during detailed \nengineering designs and implementation of components. Special attention will be paid to the participation of women \nand any other vulnerable group, such as the poor. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues \nAlthough Kyrgyz Republic avoided some of the more drastic collapses in social and economic indicators \nexperienced by countries in transition, effects have nevertheless been felt by its population, particularly women. \nSignificant and growing gender disparities in political leadership, employment opportunities, and wage rates have \nincreased rates of women\u2019s income poverty. \n \nHouseholds headed by women account for 41% of beneficiary households and are smaller than households headed \nby men; single-person households are more often headed by women. Some 87% of households headed by women \nand 91% of households headed by men receive regular cash income. Higher proportions of households headed by \nwomen (20%) live in poverty than households headed by men (18%). The total number of sick days due to \nwaterborne illnesses is higher for women (151) than for men (73). Women and girls at reproductive age are \nprimarily responsible for collection of household water, household garbage disposal, and care for the sick and \nelderly. These tasks negatively impact health and cause conflict and stress in communities during rush hours and \nlimited water supply schedules. Despite an active role in the sector, women lack decision-making powers, and their \nrepresentation in management is low at 10%. \n \nThe poverty and social assessment indicated that women strongly support the Project across all components. \nWomen perceive that the Project will improve their living environments, create employment opportunities, and \nreduce the incidence of waterborne illnesses and associated costs. Implementation of the gender action plan will \nenhance the benefits to women through a training and awareness-raising program focusing on drinking water \nsafety, water source protection and treatment, water and environmental sanitation and diseases, toilet renovation, \nand health education and promotion. \n \n2.  Key Actions \nMeasures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n   Gender plan    \n\n  Other actions/measures       \n\n No action/measure \n\n \nGender has been mainstreamed into the design of the Project, including a range of gender-sensitive measures, \nrequirements for consultation, and monitoring indicators. The Implementing Agency will work with contractors and \ncommunities to facilitate the participation of women in paid work opportunities for physical works and to ensure that \nall Kyrgyz labor laws are respected (e.g., equal pay for equal work and no use of child or trafficked labor). HIV/AIDS \nand sexually transmitted infection awareness and prevention programs will target women as well as men, including \nprograms instituted by contractors to reach the construction crew. Project assurances will prioritize women for \nemployment, including a 15% target for project employment opportunities for women and 15% for the poor during \nthe construction phase, and will be monitored by the Project. The community-based environmental and hygiene \nawareness program that is at the core of the gender action plan will directly address women\u2019s needs and health \nrisks.  \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\n \n\nIssue \n\nInvoluntary resettlement \n\nIndigenous peoples \n\nLabor \n\n   Employment opportunities \n  Labor retrenchment \n  Core labor standards \n\nAffordability \n\nOther Risks and/or \nvulnerabilities \n\n  HIV/AIDS and sexually \ntransmitted infections \n\n  Human trafficking \n  Others (conflict, political \n\ninstability, etc.)  \n\nSignificant/Limited/No \nImpact \nPhysical works associated \nwith the Project are located \non sites that are already \nused for the same purpose \nor use state-owned right of \nway alongside existing \nroads.

The  subprojects  (the  three  project  cities  of  Balykchy,  Cholpo-Ata  and \nKarakol)  of  the  Issyk\u2013Kul  Sustainable  Development  Project  (the  Project)  were  analyzed \nfollowing  the  Handbook  for  Economic  Analysis  of  Water  Supply  Projects1 and  the  Financial \nManagement  and  Analysis  of  Projects2 of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  financial \nanalysis  assesses  subproject  ability  to  meet  future  costs,  including  capital  expenditure, \noperation  and  maintenance  costs,  and  if  appropriate,  debt  servicing  and  depreciation  or \nreinvestment margins. \n \n2. \nThe  analysis  was  conducted  on  a  without-  and  with-project  basis  by  estimating \nincremental costs and revenues over 25 years. The main financial viability parameters analyzed \nwere  (i)  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR),  which  will  be  greater  than  the  weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  (WACC),  with  the  financial  net  present  value  as  proxy;  (ii)  operating \nratio, which will be less than or equal to unity when the Project becomes fully operational; and \n(iii) tariff affordability, normally acceptable at a maximum of 5% of average household income. \nDetails of the analysis are presented in the Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n3. \nThe  analysis  looked  closely  at  the  operating  ratio  as  a  main  indicator  of  sustainability, \nwhere  operation  and  maintenance,  depreciation,  and  interest  expenses  are  measured  against \ntariff  revenues.  A  ratio  at  less  than  unity  reflects  cost  recovery,  thus  a  certain  level  of \nsustainability; at greater than unity, it shows the lack thereof, thus the need to increase tariffs or \nto obtain viability gap funding. \n \nAssumptions. The key assumptions used were (i) investment cost at base June 2009 \n4. \nprices; (ii) physical contingencies at 10%; (iii) local inflation at 13% in 2009, 12% in 2010, 10% \nin 2011 and 2012, 9% in 2013 and 2014, and 7% in 2014 and onward; (iv) foreign inflation at \n2.5% annually; (v) operation and maintenance costs covering salaries, chemicals, power, repair, \nand  maintenance,  and  bad  debts  allowance  based  on  historical  operations  and  on  design \ntechnology  used;  (vi)  asset  useful life  assumed  at  10  years  for  equipment,  particularly  service \nconnection meters, and 50 years for civil works; and (vii) historical population growth rates. \n \nThe \u201cfloating population\u201d of tourists and regular transients were accounted for, and was \n5. \nestimated at between 15% and 40% on top of base populations in the three project cities. The \nperiodic population growth rates reported by the National Statistics Committee were adjusted to \nreflect the situation. \n \n6. \nRevenues  were  projected  from  domestic  and  nondomestic  demand  for  water  and \nsewerage  services,  and  tariffs  programmed  to  increase  every  2  years.  As  the  basis  for \ncalculating  existing  tariffs  is  difficult  to  verify,  the  required  initial  increase  at  subproject \ncompletion  by  2015  (year  5)\u2014which  would  be  substantial\u2014was  determined  based  on  user \naffordability  and  targeted  cost  recovery  levels,  including  (i)  operation  and  maintenance  costs \ncoverage;  (ii)  operation  and  maintenance  costs  plus  depreciation  coverage;  and  (iii)  operation \nand  maintenance  costs  plus  depreciation  and  debt  interest  coverage.  Tariffs  were  maintained \nwithin consumer affordability limits. \n \n7. \nThe analysis on water supply and sewerage was based on the design demand of about \n80 liters per capita per day (lpcd) for domestic connections increasing to 100 lpcd for Balykchy \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1999.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n49 \n\nand Karakol, and to 150 lpcd for Cholpon\u2013Ata when systems become fully operational by 2015. \nNondomestic demand is between 20% and 28% of the domestic. Sewage generation is at 70% \nof total water demand. \n \nThe  demand  forecast  assumes  all water  from  existing  alternative  sources  (i.e.,  bottled, \n8. \ncollected  from  point  source,  and  pumped)  will  be  replaced  with  subproject  water  supply.  This \nhas  featured  as  nonincremental  water  in  the  economic  analysis.  System  improvements  \nwith-project will curb nonrevenue water from the current amount of about 25% in Balykchy and \nKarakol  to  20%  upon  project  completion,  and  of  about  60%  in  Cholpon\u2013Ata  to  55%  by  2015 \n(year  5)  and  further  to  20%  by  2020  (year  10).  The  improvement  in  water  recovery  will  make \nbillable water available to the system, thereby contributing to the cost-recovery perspective. This \nhas featured as incremental water, as a source of benefits in the economic analysis. \n \n9. \nCapital Cost Estimates. Subproject capital investment has three major components: (i) \nphysical infrastructure, consisting of civil works, materials and equipment, and taxes and duties; \n(ii) enterprise resource management; and (iii) project management and administration, including \nincremental  administration;  engineering  and  construction  supervision;  and  an  information, \neducation, and communication campaign. \n \n10. \nThe capital costs for the three subprojects are summarized in Table A12.1. \n \n\nThe  three  subprojects  require  an  investment  of  $37.50  million  including  contingencies. \n\nTable A12.1: Subproject Capital Cost \n($ million) \n\nParticulars\nCivil Works and Equipment\n\nWater Supply\nSewerage\nWSS Vehicles and Equipment\nSolid Waste\nCommunity Upgrading\n\nEnterprise Resource Management\nProject Assistance Facility\nTotal Basic Cost\nPhysical Contingency\nPrice contingency\n\nTotal Contingencies\n\nInterest During Construction\nTotal Financing Charges\n\nTaxes and  Duties\n\nTotal Landed Cost\n\n%Total\n\n Total \n\n52.1\n9.8\n25.7\n2\n11.4\n3.3\n3.6\n14.8\n70.4\n4.4\n14.1\n18.5\n2.7\n2.7\n8.5\n100\n\n       \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n       \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n       \n\n19.537\n3.660\n9.626\n0.737\n4.290\n1.224\n1.339\n5.532\n26.408\n1.653\n5.271\n6.924\n1.000\n1.000\n3.169\n37.501\n\nSubproject \nBalykchy \n6.641\n1.513\n2.596\n0.342\n1.701\n0.489\n0.446\n1.844\n8.932\n0.547\n1.781\n2.328\n0.344\n0.344\n1.072\n12.675\n\n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n         \n\nSubproject \nCholpon-Ata \n                 \n2.854\n1.127\n                 \n                     \u2014\n                 \n0.052\n                 \n1.429\n                 \n0.246\n                 \n0.446\n                 \n1.844\n                 \n5.144\n                 \n0.306\n                 \n1.012\n                 \n1.318\n                 \n0.193\n                 \n0.193\n                 \n0.617\n                 \n7.273\n\n Subproject \nKarakol \n\n         \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n         \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n         \n\n10.042\n1.020\n7.030\n0.342\n1.160\n0.489\n0.446\n1.844\n12.332\n0.800\n2.478\n3.278\n0.463\n0.463\n1.480\n17.552\n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n11. \nFinancing Plan.

Inflation  is  estimated  at \n2.47% for foreign cost and at an 6.80% annual average for local costs. The rates are computed \non  after-tax  basis,  resulting  in  the  WACC  in  real  terms  estimated  at  15.4%.

Subproject  operation  and  maintenance  costs \ninclude vodokanal enterprise and tazalyk enterprise staff salaries, power and energy, chemical \ntreatment, maintenance, and miscellaneous expenses, and are based on vodokanal enterprise \nhistorical  financial  operations.  Bad  debt  expense  is  assumed  at  1%  of  sales.  Escalation  is \napplied based on local inflation. Depreciation is assumed at 2% annually (50-year items) for civil \nworks  and  6.7%\u201310.0%  (10\u201315-year  items)  for  replacement  materials  and  equipment. \nReplacement of fully depreciated assets is to be financed through internal cash. \n \n14. \nCost-Recovery  Analysis.  The  tariff  was  established  by  dividing  all  cash  requirements \nplus margins by the combined volume of water sold and sewage and solid waste generated. It is \nprojected  that  the  collection  rate  will  improve  as  services  improve.  In  the  analysis,  an  actual \ncollection rate of about 60%\u201380% for the three project cities is expected to reach 90% by 2015 \n(year 5). The analysis determined the level of tariffs required to satisfy the defined cost-recovery \noptions. Where tariffs are insufficient to attain full cost recovery, the required shortfall has been \nassessed in the form of viability gap funding. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n51 \n\n \n15. \nCurrent  Tariffs.  Current  water  tariffs  differentiate  between  domestic  and  nondomestic \nuse.  All  existing  tariffs  are  volumetric  and  structured  to  prevent  waste.  However,  metering  is \nvery  limited  at  less  than  3%  in  the  three  project  cities.  Where  metering  is  available,  wear  and \ndisrepair  have  rendered  the  equipment  unreliable.  Under  the  Project\u2019s  capital  investment \nprogram, full metering is recommended. House and apartment connections for water supply are \npresently  charged  on  average  $0.08  per  cubic  meter  in  the  three  cities.  Nondomestic \nconnections are charged about five times that at $0.43 per cubic meter. For sewerage services, \ndomestic charges average $0.06 per cubic meter; nondomestic, $0.36. Existing domestic tariffs \nfor solid waste services average $2.20 per cubic meter, with nondomestic service users charged \n2.3 times more, averaging $5.01. \n \nTariff  Basis  and  Forecast.  In  financial  projections,  where  costs  are  given  in  nominal \n16. \nterms, the tariffs are projected to increase biennially to cope with cost inflation. In the FIRR cash \nflows, the tariffs are taken in real terms. The projected increases will start after construction to \nallow  time  for  service  users  to  assimilate  to  the  proposed  tariff  reforms  that  will  include  full \nmetering  for  water  consumption.  For  solid  waste  services,  full  costs  of  waste  collection  and \ndisposal will remain the basis for cost-recovery tariffs; however, a higher tariff collection rate will \nbe  targeted  and  form  part  of  financial  management  reforms.  It  is  proposed  to  include  tariff \nrestructuring as part of financial reforms to re-examine existing norms and their bases to ensure \nmore realistic design approaches for future projects in the water supply and sanitation sector. \n \n17. \nAffordability  Analysis.  An  affordability  analysis  was  undertaken  to  check  the  level  of \nwater  expenditure  against  average  household  income.  Table  A12.4  presents  the  affordability \nlevels in each subproject for year 1 (2011), year 5 (2015), and year 10 (2020). The number of \npersons  at  an  average  of  5.0  per  household  and  the  unit  consumption  at  90  lpcd  in  2009  are \nbased on field surveys and actual operational reports. Average household incomes are based \non social surveys conducted in the subproject cities during project preparation and adjusted to \nprice inflation. \n \n\nParticulars\nA.

However,  viability  gap  funding  will  need  to  be \nconsidered  during  the  initial  years  of  operation  to  recover  costs  fully,  including  asset \nreplacements. Table A12.4 indicates that the proposed monthly charge for the three cities is far \nlower  than  the  generally  accepted  limit  of  5%  of  household  income.  Politically,  exponential \nincreases are unacceptable, and it is proposed that viability gap funding will provide the initial \nbuffer to meet required operating ratios before financial reforms and progressive tariff increases \nreduce dependence on such funding. \n \n19. \nA  break-even  analysis  was  undertaken  for  all  subprojects.  To  cover  operation  and \nmaintenance  costs,  tariffs  are  set  to  increase  biennially  at  rates  given  in  Table  A12.5.  Also \nindicated  is  the  cumulative  viability  gap  funding  required  under  each  scenario  to  ensure \noperations  are  sustainable  within  acceptable  tariff  increases.  The  accumulative  viability  gap \nfunding  is  determined  over  2010\u20132015  and  2016\u20132029  before  the  Government  of  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  plans  an  exit  strategy  from  viability  gap  funding support.  Project  support  through  the \nenterprise  resource  management  component  should  support  financial management  reforms  to \nimprove vodokanal enterprises and cities' ability to meet operation and maintenance costs. \n \n\nTable A12.5: Cost Recovery Tariffs and Required Viability Gap Fund \n\n Level \n\n Cost Recovery \n\n VGF Needs  \n\nIncrease     VGF Needs  \n\n VGF Needs  \n\nBalykchy\n\n Tariff \nIncrease  \n\nCholpon-Ata\n\nTariff \n\nKarakol\n\n Tariff \nIncrease  \n\nWSS (2010\u20132015)\n\nO&M Cost\nO&M + Depreciation\nO&M cost + Deprn + Debt\n\nWSS (2016\u20132029)\n\nO&M cost\nO&M + Depreciation\nO&M cost + Deprn + Debt\n\nSWM (2010\u20132015)\n\nO&M cost\nO&M + Depreciation\nO&M cost + Deprn + Debt\n\nSWM (2016\u20132029)\n\n20%\n20%\n20%\n\n67%\n63%\n60%\n\n20%\n20%\n20%\n\n0.446\n0.956\n0.956\n\n0.000\n0.032\n0.091\n\n0.683\n0.952\n0.952\n\n20%\n20%\n20%\n\n54%\n49%\n49%\n\n20%\n20%\n20%\n\n0.691\n0.935\n1.001\n\n0.059\n0.143\n0.182\n\n0.956\n0.956\n1.021\n\n20%\n20%\n20%\n\n93%\n87%\n89%\n\n20%\n20%\n20%\n\n2.675\n3.727\n3.979\n\n4.026\n5.499\n6.058\n\n1.051\n1.051\n1.110\n\nI\nII\nIII\n\n1.309\n1.685\n2.503\n\n1.392\n1.958\n1.907\n\n1.141\n1.671\n2.749\n\n103%\n103%\n97%\n\n131%\n129%\n129%\n\nO&M cost\nO&M + Depreciation\nO&M cost + Deprn + Debt\n\n110%\n111%\n106%\ndeprn = depreciation, incr = increase, O&M = operation and maintenance, VGF = viability gap fund.\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n \nFor example, to break even in water, sewerage, and solid waste services in Balykchy, by \n20. \ncovering only operation and maintenance costs, the Government would provide $1.13 million in \nviability gap funding for the period 2010\u20132015 and $1.31 million in viability gap funding for the \nperiod 2016\u20132029. This would be in addition to the average biennialtariff increase of 20% for the \nperiod 2010\u20132015 and 67%\u2013110% for the period 2016\u20132029.  \n \n21. \nFinancial Viability Approach. The subproject is considered viable if the resulting FIRR \nis greater than the WACC, and cost recovery tariffs within consumer affordability. Additionally, \nthe  operating  ratio  will  need  to  be  maintained  lower  than  unity  throughout  the  Project\u2019s  life  to \nensure sustainability. Initial spreadsheet iterations reveal that without proposed improvements, \nsubproject  operations  will  not  be  sustainable  as  operation  and  maintenance  expenses  exceed \ntariff  revenues.

Subproject  vodokanal  enterprises  and  tazalyk  enterprises  are  financially \n23. \nviable when (i) tariff increases are required at least every 2 years and should be based on cost \nrecovery and consumer affordability principles, and (ii) the Government should make available \nviability gap funding to ensure service sustainability. These conditions have been incorporated \nin  the  financial  improvement  action  plan.  These  reform  plans  and  related  issues  have  been \ndiscussed  and  agreed  with  the  Executing  Agency  with  the  aim  of  achieving  financial \nsustainability  of  the  overall  investment.  Income  affordability  is  a  major  factor  in  rationalizing \ntariffs;  thus,  the  household  income  base  needs  to  be  reviewed  periodically.  The  sensitivity \nanalysis indicates that subcomponent FIRRs are stressed under various conditions, implying a \nneed for efficient project implementation to rapidly achieve physical and financial targets. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n \n1. \nMethodology.  The  economic  analysis  for  the  Issyk\u2013Kul  Sustainable  Development \nProject (the Project) followed Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines, including  Guidelines \nfor  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects 1 and  Handbook  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Water \nSupply  Projects.2 The  analysis  describes  the  economic  rationale  and  target  beneficiaries,  and \nundertakes  a  viability  analysis  of  the  three  subprojects  (the  three  project  cities  of  Balykchy, \nCholpo-Ata  and  Karakol).  A  sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  to  determine  the  effects  of \ncertain adverse conditions on system capital investment and operation and maintenance costs, \nrevenue  generation,  and  overall  subproject  viability.  The  analysis  used  the  domestic  price \nnumeraire,  as  benefits  are  nontradable  in  nature.  The  analysis  was  undertaken  at  a  constant \nmid-2009 price level and assesses project effects over 25 years (2011\u20132035). \n \n2. \nfollowing. \n(i) \n\nEconomic  Rationale  and  Goals.  The  project  economic  rationale  was  based  on  the \n\nImproving  urban  services  and  Lake \nIssyk\u2013Kul's  environment.  Urban \nservices  in  the  three  project  cities  have  deteriorated  since  the  collapse  of  the \nSoviet  Union.  Lack  of  capital  investments  for  infrastructure  improvement  and \ninsufficient revenues to meet operating expenditures have affected the quality of \nthe  services.  Consequently,  due  to  poor  access  to  sanitation  and  solid  waste \ntreatment  and  disposal,  surface  water  runoff  and  contaminated  groundwater \nhave impacted the lake's environment. Project interventions will help improve the \nquality of infrastructure and terminate any future contamination of the lake. \nFostering  tourism  growth.  Improving  the  lake's  environment  and  quality  of \nservices in the three project cities will foster tourism growth. Tourists visiting Lake \nIssyk\u2013Kul account for 70% of the country's tourists, or about 1 million visiting the \nregion  each  June  to  August  (translated  as  four  times  the  resident  population  in \nproject  cities).  Dilapidated  urban  infrastructure  is  under  excess  pressure  during \nthe peak tourist season, and tourist perception and continued patronization of the \nregion  are  contingent  on  efficient  urban  services.  Improvements  through  the \nProject  will ensure  growth  in  tourist  numbers,  increased  gross  regional  product, \nand accrued benefits to the oblast and country. \nImproving  local  government  and  service  utility  performance.  To  sustain \nefficient  services,  the  Project  will  improve  the  institutional  effectiveness  of  local \ngovernments  and  service  utilities  (i.e.,  vodokanal  enterprises  and  tazalyk \nenterprises).  Through  the  enterprise  resource  management  component,  the \nProject  will  (a)  improve  financial  management  practices  in  the  project  cities, \nvodokanal  enterprises,  and  tazalyk  enterprises,  and  create  a  culture  of \ngenerating  revenue  surpluses  to  reinvest  into  capital  assets  or  to  leverage  for \ndebt; (b) create a database of water and sewerage assets and conditions to help \nvodokanal  enterprises  identify  infrastructure  improvements  in  the  long  term \nbased on a well-developed asset management and maintenance system; and (c) \nbuild vodokanal enterprises staff capacity to manage services through a twinning \nprogram. \nEnabling  public\u2013private  partnerships.  Current  arrangements  between  cities \nand  service  utilities 3  are  loosely  based  on  service  agreements  that  require \nimprovement in performance standards. The Project will improve service quality \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n2   ADB. 1999. Handbook for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Project. Manila. \n3   Vodokanal enterprises and tazalyk enterprises are quasi-private entities, as their relationships with cities are based \n\non service agreements, and payments are based on city council-approved business plans. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13  55 \n\nby  concluding  performance-based  service  contracts  between  cities  and  service \nutilities. \n\n \n3. \nSelection  Approach.  The  subprojects  were  selected  based  on  (i)  consistency  with \ndemand,  based  on  community  willingness  to  participate  and  contribute;  (ii)  the  least-cost \napproach  of  meeting  effective  demand  in  terms  of  location,  scale,  scope,  and  appropriate \ntechnology, based on prudent engineering decisions; and (iii) that economic benefits are likely \nto exceed economic costs. The three project cities were prioritized due to the growing tourism \nindustry  that  can  easily  be  threatened  with  water-  and  sanitation-related  health  and \nenvironmental problems, which project interventions will help mitigate.  \n \n4. \nProject  Alternatives.  The  Project  will  (i)  improve  urban  infrastructure,  including \nsewerage  and  sanitation,  solid  waste  management,  water  supply,  and  community  upgrading, \nand  (ii)  improve  service  delivery  through  better  enterprise  resource  management.  Component \nchoice was based on the following decisions. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nReplacing  sewer  lines  and  rehabilitating  pumping  stations. The Project will \nreplace aging sewer networks, replace sewage pumps, and rehabilitate pumping \nstations (over 25 years old). This option is the least-cost, as continuing to use the \nexisting  system  will  result  in  (a)  groundwater  contamination  through  sewage \ninfiltration  from  system  leaks,  and  (b)  high  electricity  charges  due  to  poorly \nfunctioning sewage pumps.  \nExpanding the sewer network and providing onsite sanitation systems. The \nProject  will  expand  the  sewer  network  in  Karakol  to  increase  access  to \napproximately  30,000  persons.  It  will  also  ensure  access  to  onsite  sanitation \n(septic  tanks)  facilities  to  25,000  persons.  Sewer  network  expansion  covers \nareas  that  are  densely  populated  and  have  sufficient  population  density  to \ngenerate  sewage  flushing  velocity.  Onsite  sanitation  facilities  target  areas  that \nare sparsely populated with insufficient sewage flushing velocities. Not providing \nfocused options would increase the incidence of waterborne diseases. \nConstructing  sanitary  landfills  and  closing  existing  dumps. The Project will \nensure  that  indiscriminate  waste  dumping  is  discontinued,  and  new  sanitary \nlandfills are constructed. Alternative options of treating waste are to compost it or \nto adopt waste-to-energy technologies. Sanitary landfills are the preferred option \nas  the  organic  portion  of  waste  generated  is  approximately  10%,  making \ncomposting  unviable,  and  70%  of  the  waste  is  inert  material,  making  waste-to-\nenergy processing unviable. The sanitary landfills are located at existing dumps \non state-owned land, thereby negating any land acquisition costs. \nProviding  vehicles,  tools,  and  equipment.  Poor  system  operation  and \nmaintenance will be overcome through adequate supply of appropriate vehicles, \ntools, and equipment. Without provision, new systems constructed will enter into \na state of disrepair within a short period.  \nPiloting  district  water  metering,  replacing  water  transmission  mains,  and \nrehabilitating  water  boreholes.  The  Project will  (i)  install  water  meters  in  pilot \nzones in three cities, monitor water supply, and identify system leaks to develop \na leak rectification program; (ii) replace a 2-kilometer water transmission main to \nconserve  water;  and  (iii)  rehabilitate  water  boreholes  by  providing  disinfection \nmeasures to improve water quality. The identified options will ensure savings in \noperational expenditure resulting from water losses, resource savings in terms of \nconserving  treated  water  transmission,  and  improved  health  conditions  through \ndisinfection of groundwater supplies. \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n(vi) \n\nEnterprise resource management. The subcomponents identified are based on \nmeeting  the  Project's  economic  rationale  on  improving  local  government  and \nservice utility performance. \n\n \n5. \nService Delivery and Socioeconomic Analysis. City-level data provided by vodokanal \nenterprises  and  tazalyk  enterprises  (presented  in  Appendix  2)  were  verified  through  a \nsocioeconomic  survey  and  focus  group  discussions.  The  survey  covered  514  respondents 4 \nrandomly  sampled  in  the  three  project  cities.  Results  are  indicated  in  the  Summary  Poverty \nReduction and Social Strategy, Appendix 11. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nSanitation.  About  75%  households  use  dry-pit  latrines,  and  24%  use  flush  or \npour  toilets.  Predominantly,  apartment  blocks  in  all  cities  are  connected  to  the \nsewerage system. \n(a) \n\nAbout  31%  households  in  the  highest-income  quintile,  compared  with \n22% of households in the lowest-income quintile, have access to a flush \nor  pour  toilet.  The  poor  generally  use  pit  latrines,  which  cannot  be \nconnected to the centralized system.   \nAbout 66% of households surveyed (57% of the households in the lowest-\nincome quintile compared with 60% of households in the highest-income \nquintile)  stated  that  they  would  be  willing  to  pay  for  a  sewerage \nconnection, indicating citizen priority for improved sanitation.  \n\n(b) \n\nSolid  waste  management.  Approximately  84%  of  households  (and  86%  in  the \nlowest-income quintile) stated that a municipal collection service was unavailable \non  a  daily  basis.  Increased  collection  frequency  was  a  stated  requirement.  The \nperception was corroborated through assessment of city-level data.  \n(a)  Waste disposal practices included plastic bottle and packaging collection \nby the tazalyk enterprises from 50% of households, waste incineration by \n36% of households, and waste disposal into the nearest landfill or waste \nreceptacle  by  8%  of  households.  All  poor  households  stated  that  they \nsold household waste for recycling.  \nAbout  83%  of  households  indicated  that  household  waste  earned  an \naverage  of  Som43  ($1)  per  month.  Waste  sold  by  poor  households \nearned them an average of Som27 ($0.62) per month, equivalent to 10% \nof the amount earned through waste sold by non-poor households. \n\n(b) \n\n(iii)  Water supply. Existing water systems in the three project cities have undergone \nimprovement  due  to  recent  investments  to  increase  coverage  to  about  80%  of \nthe  population.  However,  low-quality  supplies  still  impact  served  and  unserved \npopulations.  \n(a) \n\nThe  survey  indicated  that  25%  of  households  and  19%  of  poor \nhouseholds had an inadequate water supply for household needs.  \nImproved  water  quality  was  a  high  priority,  and  only  39%  of  households \n(44% of households in the lowest-income quintile and 40% of households \nin  the  highest-income  quintile)  stated  that  they  would  drink  the  water \nwithout some form of treatment. Households in the lowest-income quintile \non  average  pay  nearly  three  times  more  (Som90  or  $2  per  month)  than \nhouseholds in the highest income quintile (Som35 or $0.8 per month) for \nwater treatment. \n\n(b) \n\n(c)  Waterborne  illnesses  were  significant,  with  82%  of  households  (17%  in \nthe  lowest-income  quintile  and  22%  in  the  second-to-lowest-income \nquintile) stating incidences in the past 5 years. Overall, 23% of all people \nsuffering from these illnesses were poor, and they lost 75 potential labor \n\n                                                 \n4   175 households in Balykchy, 55 households in Cholpon\u2013Ata, and 284 households in Karakol. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n6. \nfollowing. \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\ndays  per  year  due  to  waterborne  illnesses.  The  average  annual \nexpenditure  on  treating  waterborne  illnesses  was  Som1,472  ($34),  with \n29% households spending Som251 ($6)\u2013Som700 ($16)per year and 26% \nof households spending Som701($16)\u2013Som2,500 ($58) per year.  \n\nAppendix 13  57 \n\nSubproject  Beneficiaries  and  Projected  Demand.  Demand  assumptions  include  the \n\nSewerage  and  sanitation.  Project  beneficiaries  will \ninclude  households \npresently connected to the existing sewerage systems that will gain from system \nrehabilitation, and households getting new connections through proposed sewer \nlines.  Both  types  of  households  will  benefit  from  improved  environmental \nsanitation  conditions  that  a  properly  functioning  sewerage  system  provides. \nSystem  coverage  will  increase  to  benefit  about  50%  of  the  population  from  the \ncurrent 35%. \nSolid  waste  management.  Project  beneficiaries  will  comprise  households \nacross  the  three  project  cities  that  will  gain  from  improved  environmental \nsanitation, living conditions, and amenities that a properly functioning solid waste \ncollection  and  disposal  system  will  provide.  Those  households  that  currently \nspend  time  disposing  of  their  solid  waste  will  receive  additional  benefits  from \nreceiving  primary  waste  collection.  About  80%  of  project  households  will  be \ncovered by the improved waste management system. \n\n(iii)  Water  supply.  Prior  to  and  without  the  Project,  households  in  the  three  project \ncities  rely  on  alternative  water  collected  from  point  source,  bottled  water, \ngroundwater  pumped  from  household  boreholes,  and  standpipes.  With  the \nProject,  piped  water  will  replace  alternative  supplies.  Connected  households \nconsume  80\u2013100  liters  per  capita  per  day  (lpcd),  and  unconnected  households \nconsume 35\u2013l0 lpcd. With the Project, the demand will rise to 100\u2013150 lpcd. The \nsupply situation is projected to rise with the population growth rate and increase \nannually to reach a design target population of 90% on project completion.  \n\n \n7. \nEconomic Benefits of Sewerage. The economic benefits for sewerage include (i) cost \nsavings  for  residential  and  nonresidential  sewage  generators,  which  are  no  longer  required  to \noperate  onsite  disposal  systems;  and  (ii)  health  benefits  through  avoided  household  medical \ncosts5 and avoided income loss by wage-earners absent from work due to waterborne illnesses. \nThe former was not considered directly as new customers currently use pit latrines that do not \nentail  any  operation  and  maintenance  costs.  Health  benefits  were  calculated  using  morbidity \nrates  obtained  from  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  the  National  Statistics  Committee,  and  from \ninterviews  with  city  epidemiological  centers.  Data  from  the  National  Statistics  Committee  on \nincidences of illnesses for population were also used. \n \nEconomic  Benefits  of  Solid  Waste  Management. Valuation of economic benefits for \n8. \nsolid waste management was based on economic value of savings in waste disposal time and \nhealth  benefits.6 The  former  was  derived  from  socioeconomic  surveys,  and  the  latter  was  not \nconsidered for the current analysis due to inability to derive health benefits from available data.\n\n                                                 \n5   Medical treatment expense averages Som1,500 ($35) per year. \n6   Includes  (i)  avoided  medical  costs  to  treat  diseases  mostly  from  rat  infestations,  and  (ii)  avoided  costs  due  to \n\nabsences from work. \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n9. \nfollowing.  \n(i) \n\nEconomic  Benefits  of  Water  Supply.  Valuation  of  economic  benefits  comprises  the \n\nExpanding supply of existing water. In supplying the existing volume of piped \nwater more efficiently, measured in terms of the average cost of supply in with- \nand  without-  project  scenarios,  the  following  two  major  components  are \nconsidered.  \n(a) \n\nNonincremental  water  supply.  This  component  considers  the  increase \nin water sold from the public system due to the Project but resulting in no \neffect  on  total  water  consumption  because  (1)  the  nonincremental  water \nsupply replaces water purchased and consumed from alternative sources \n(bottled water sources in case of the Project), and (2) the nonincremental \nwater supply due to reduction in nontechnical loss thanks to the Project. \nOnly  nonincremental  benefits  from  a  consumer  shift  from  bottled  water \nwere  considered. 1  There  are  no  benefits  assumed  from  nontechnical \nlosses,  such  as  pilferage,  meter  tampering,  and  illegal  connections,  as \nthese  occurrences  are  atypical  in  the  three  project  cities.  The  benefit  is \nevaluated by using the supply cost of replaced water sources. \nIncremental  water  supply. This component has a positive effect on the \ntotal  consumption  due  to  the  Project.  Incremental  water  in  the  analysis \ncomprises  water  arising  from  (1)  additional  system  demand  from  the \n(previously)  nonconnected  population,  and  (2)  additional  supply  from \nsystem  improvements  geared  to  recover  nonrevenue  water  or  system \nloss.  The  latter  will  induce  higher  demand  from  the  existing  and  newly \nconnected  population  given  the  lower  price  of  project  water  relative  to \nalternative supplies. This component of benefit is evaluated by using the \nsupply  price  to  be  decided  by  the  city  periodically  and  based  on \naffordability. \n\n(b) \n\nHealth  benefits.  Health  benefits  from  improved  water  quality  and  supply  are \nconsidered  under  the  health  benefits  for  sewerage,  as  it  is  assumed  that \nimprovements in both systems will reduce waterborne illnesses. \nResource  cost  savings.  Other  benefits  include  resource  cost  savings  arising \nfrom  (a)  overcoming  time  lost  in  collecting  water  from  alternative  sources,  (b) \novercoming  storage  or  container  acquisition  and  maintenance  costs,  and  (c) \nreducing water treatment costs (e.g., boiling or filtering). \n\n \nEconomic  Costs.  The  economic  capital  investment  and  annual  operation  and \n\n10. \nmaintenance costs were based on financial cost estimates detailed in Appendix 12.  \n\nTaxes and duties are excluded from the financial costs as they represent transfer \npayments. Price inflation and market distortions are also excluded.  \nThe subproject capital and operation and maintenance costs are distributed into \ntraded  and  nontraded  components  and  labor.  For  traded  and  nontraded \ncomponents,  the  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  is  assumed  at  1  based  on \nprevious and ongoing projects by ADB and World Bank in Kyrgyz Republic.  \nUnskilled labor is available in urban centers, which means the opportunity cost is \nlower than the wage rate. The shadow wage rate is assumed at 0.7 for unskilled \nlabor,  following  estimates  made  for  agricultural  and  highway  projects  in  the \nregion.  \n\n                                                 \n1   The volume of bottled water use relative to total water consumption in households is small, but expenditure-wise, \nthe  cost  to  the  household  is  high.  In  the  three  project  cities,  a  liter  of  bottled  water  is  about  $0.40\u2013$0.50.  In \ncomparison, a cubic meter of system water ranges between $0.03\u2013$0.11. Bottled water cost through the system is \nderived using existing tariffs. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13  59 \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\nThe economic costs are given in real terms and phased over the project life of 25 \nyears.  For  annual  economic  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  labor  was \nassumed at 30% unskilled and the remaining as skilled. Unskilled labor is subject \nto the shadow wage rate at 0.7. For skilled labor and the other cost components, \nthe shadow exchange rate factor at 1.0 is applied.  \n\n \n11. \nBenefit\u2013Cost  Assessment.  The  economic  benefit\u2013cost  ratio  was  used  in  the  analysis \nto  assess  whether  project  benefits  outweigh  costs,  thus  making  the  subproject  economically \nfeasible. The annual cost streams were set against the annual benefit streams and discounted \nusing the economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCC) at 12% as the hurdle rate. The resulting \npresent value of benefits was divided by the present value of costs, and if the resulting ratio is \ngreater than or equal to 1.0, the subproject is deemed acceptable. Table A13.1 summarizes the \nresults for the three subprojects, and indicates that the benefit\u2013cost ratio averages 1.42 for the \nwater supply and sewerage components, and 1.21 for solid waste.  \n \n\nTable A13.1: Benefit-Cost Analysis \n($ million) \n \n\nParticulars\nWater Supply and Sewerage\nPresent value of benefits\n\nNon-incremental\n\nAlternative source (bottled water, etc.)a\nNon-technical water lossb\n\nIncrementalc\n\nAdditional demand from previously non-connected population\nAdditional supply from recovered NRW\n\nHealth \n\nAvoided lost wages due to illnessd\nAvoided cost of medical treatmente\n\nResource savings\n\nTime saved from collecting waterf\nCost saved from purchase of storage reservoirg\nCost saved from water treatment and storage maintenanceh\n\nTotal benefits\n\nPresent value of costs\n\nAverage\n\n Subproject \nBalykchy \n\n Subproject \nCholpon-\nAta \n\n Subproject \nKarakol \n\n       \n       \n\n6.49\n6.49\n0\n2.64\n0.33\n2.31\n0.23\n0.11\n0.12\n1.73\n0.66\n0.56\n0.51\n11.09\n\n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n     \n\n             \n             \n\n5.43\n5.43\n0\n3.28\n0.45\n2.82\n0.14\n0.07\n0.07\n1.93\n0.61\n0.69\n0.62\n10.77\n\n             \n             \n             \n             \n             \n             \n             \n             \n             \n             \n           \n\n            \n            \n\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n\n3.28\n3.28\n0\n1.49\n0.23\n1.26\n0.05\n0.02\n0.03\n0.50\n0.20\n0.15\n0.14\n5.32\n\n          \n          \n\n10.76\n10.76\n0\n3.15\n0.30\n2.85\n0.49\n0.24\n0.25\n2.78\n1.15\n0.86\n0.78\n17.18\n\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n          \n\n            \n            \n          \n            \n\n6.48\n6.23\n12.70\n1.35\n\n4.10\n3.82\n7.92\n1.42\n\n       \n       \n       \n          \n\n             \n             \n             \n             \n\n1.82\nCapital investment + replacements\n1.79\nO&M\n3.61\nTotal costs\nBenefit-cost ratio\n1.47\na Population using bottled water x SP.
