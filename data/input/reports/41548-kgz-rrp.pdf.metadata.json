An \nupdated EIA is detailed in Supplementary Appendix J. \n   \nProject  The Issyk\u2013Kul Sustainable Development Project (the Project) is the first \nDescription  phase in a longer-term initiative by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto support environmental management and to improve urban service \ndelivery in the Issyk\u2013Kul Oblast. ADB and government collaboration in \nIssyk\u2013Kul  will  ensure  that  urban  services  interventions  will  increase \naccess to potable water and safe sanitation, including use of proven \ntechnologies for treatment and disposal of solid and liquid waste. The \nProject  will  (i)  improve  urban  infrastructure,  including  sewerage  and \nsanitation,  solid  waste  management,  water  supply,  and  community \nupgrading; and (ii) improve service delivery through better enterprise \nresource management.  \n \nThe Project covers the cities of Balykchy, Cholpon\u2013Ata, and Karakol. Its \noutputs are: \n(i)  replacing  a  13.4-kilometer  (km)  sewer  network  (specifically \naddressing  pumping  mains  to  sewage  treatment  plants); \nrehabilitating pumping stations in Balykchy and Karakol; extending \nthe sewer network by 12 km to uncovered areas in Karakol; and \nsupplying  relevant  tools,  equipment,  and  vehicles  for  sewer \nmaintenance;  \n(ii)  re-engineering 42.5 hectares of waste dumps into sanitary landfills, \nclosing existing dumps in all three project cities, providing waste \nsegregation  and  recyclable  sorting  equipment,  and  supplying \nvehicles and equipment for waste collection and transport; \n(iii)  installing  8,550  water  meters,  training  vodokanal  enterprises  in \nmeter reading and leak control, constructing a presedimentation \ntreatment tank at the Karakol water headworks, replacing a 2 km \ncorroded  transmission  main  in  Balykchy,  and  reconstructing  10 \nboreholes  (with  treatment,  energy  efficient  pumps,  storage,  and \nprotection facilities) in Balykchy and Cholpon\u2013Ata;  \n(iv)  providing in the three project cities, water and sanitation facilities in \npre-schools, schools and  neighborhoods, and public conveniences \nin markets, public centers, health care organizations, and public \ninstitutions; and  \n ", "ii   \n(v)  implementing  an  enterprise  resource  management  component \ncomprising  a  management  information  system,  accounting  and \nfinancial  management,  geographic  information  system,  asset \ninventory and management, and institutional effectiveness program \nfor cities, vodokanal enterprises and tazalyk enterprises. \n   \nRationale  Lake Issyk\u2013Kul (\u201cwarm lake\u201d in Kyrgyz) is the world\u2019s second largest \nsaline  lake;  a  Ramsar  site  of  globally  significant  biodiversity;  and  a \nUnited  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization \n(UNESCO)-designated biosphere reserve. The lake forms a significant \npart  of  Issyk\u2013Kul  Oblast  and  contributes  to  its  economic  growth  by \nproviding  tourism  opportunities.  Attracting  approximately  1  million \ntourists annually\u2014equivalent to 70% of the country\u2019s annual tourist of \n1.4 million persons\u2014the lake is a major economic driver in the region.  \n \nIncreasing tourism has resulted in the construction of many resorts that \nare now sprawled around the lake's northern shores. However, existing \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  infrastructure\u2014including  solid  waste \nmanagement\u2014is decrepit, dysfunctional, and poorly maintained. Current \ninfrastructure  is  unable  to  serve  the  high  number  of  tourists,  which \nexceeds the resident population by a factor of four. Excessive pressure \non existing infrastructure is partially responsible for the lake's pollution. \n \nThe  country  development  strategy,  2009\u20132011,  emphasizes \nenvironmental sustainability. The Project, and its focus on protecting the \nlake,  features  under  the  strategy\u2019s  investment  project  for  the \nIssyk\u2013Kul  region.  In  February  2009,  the  Concept  of  Sustainable \nDevelopment of the Ecological and Economic System of Issyk\u2013Kul was \npassed through a presidential decree. Subsequently, the Government of \nKyrgyz  Republic  passed  a  resolution  in  May  2009  that  prioritizes \nimplementation of the Project. \n \nADB-led investment and policy dialogue in the region will improve the \ninfrastructure and quality of urban services, foster tourism, and preserve \nthe  lake's  environment.  Institutional,  legal,  and  municipal  finance \nassessments in Issyk\u2013Kul will provide a suitable platform for developing \nADB's urban services sector development strategy for Kyrgyz Republic. \nDevelopment  of  performance-based  service  contracts  through  the \nProject will also improve opportunities for public\u2013private partnerships in \nthe water supply and sanitation sector. \n   \nImpact and  The Project is expected to improve the health of resident population in \nOutcome  the Issyk\u2013Kul Oblast and to ensure environmental preservation of Lake \nIssyk\u2013Kul. The outcome of the Project is improved urban basic service \ndelivery  (comprising  sewerage,  sanitation,  solid  waste  management, \nand water supply) in the cities of Balykchy, Cholpon\u2013Ata, and Karakol. \n   \nProject  The Project investment cost is estimated at $37.50 million, including \nInvestment Plan   taxes and duties of $3.17 million.  \n   ", "  iii\nFinancing Plan  ($ million)\nSource Amount %\nA.

Upon completion of the \nProject,  the  water  supply  system  will  comprise  improved  treatment \nfacilities at water sources and household meters that directly benefit \nabout  43,000  people  in  the  three  project  cities,  with  notable \nimprovements  in  water  quality  and  regulated  water  supply.  The \nsewerage  and  sanitation  investments  will  benefit  68,000  persons \nthrough improved access to reticulated systems, sanitation facilities, and \nlatrines. About 133,500 persons will benefit from solid waste collection \nand disposal services. The integrated improvement of the existing urban \ninfrastructure facilities and services will provide better living conditions \nand  enhance  the  surrounding  environment  in  the  project cities.  The \nProject's  enterprise  resource  management  component  will  create  a \nculture  of  prudent  financial  management  in  the  cities  and  service \nutilities, enabling them to generate revenue surpluses in the longer term \nfor equity investments and leveraging debt. \n   \nRisks and  Potential risks associated with the Project include (i) lack of commitment \nAssumptions  by city administrations to undertake or implement reforms in urban and \nfinancial  management,  and  inability  to  implement  the  financial \nimprovement action plan; (ii) inability of government staff to implement \nthe  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan;  (iii)  sudden \nincrease in cost of construction items; (iv) insufficient incentives by the \nGovernment to ensure vodokanal enterprises and tazalyk enterprises \nstaff  provide  efficient  service  delivery;  and  (v)  lack  of  viability  gap \nfunding from the Government to sustain urban services. \n \nEarly  establishment  of  the  PMO  and  PIO  and  commencement  of \nsurveys  for  engineering  designs  and  information,  education,  and \ncommunication  campaign  to  generate  community  awareness  will \nmitigate start-up delays. Efficiently functioning PMO and PIO will ensure \nthe project is completed on time and sudden price rise of construction \nitems is adequately accommodated. The Prime Minister's Office has \ndirect control over the Project's objectives and will monitor activities, \nimproving the urban management and financial performance of cities. \nAppointing the Ministry of Finance as the Executing Agency cements \ncommitment for viability gap funding as a key line item in the national \nbudget as the Ministry of Finance prepares and disburses funds under \nthe medium-term budgetary framework. \n \n ", "o o\n71  00'E 78  00'E\nKYRGYZ  REPUBLIC\nISSYK--KUL SUSTAINABLE\nDEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nK A Z A K H S T A N\nTyup\no Dzhergalan o\n42  30'N BISHKEK Ivanovka 42  30'N\nKayingdyShBKoaaplrtoaakov NovopavlKovaknat Tokmok Kemin Cholpon-Ata Lake Issyk-Kul Karakol\nPokrovka CHUI Balykchy\nMaimak\nTalas\nKochkor ISSYK-KUL\nBakay Ata\nTALAS\nSuusamyr\nChaek\nToktogul Lake Song-Kul\nNARYN\nKanysh- Naryn\nKiya Toktogul Reservoir\nKarajigach\nKarakul\nJALAL-ABAD\nTash Kazarman\nTSeareik Kumyr Arslanbob Kok Baetov At-Bashy\nShamaldy Yangak\nSai\nKochkor Ata N\nBazar-Korgon JalAaln-dAizbhaadn Reservoir Lake Chatyr-Kul\nUzgen\nUZBEKISTAN Kara Su Kara-Kulja\nTorugart\nOsh 0 50 100\nAravan\nGulcha Kilometers\nKyzyl Kiya Naiman OSH\nTAJIKISTAN Project Province\nBatken Frunze Chauvay National Capital\n38o  00'N PEOPLE'S    REPUBLIC 38o  00'N\nIrkeshtam OF   CHINA  Provincial Capital\nHaidarkan\nSulyukta Sary Tash City/Town\nBATKEN\nMain Road\nDaroot-Korgon Other Road\nRailway\nRiver\nTAJIKISTAN District Boundary\nProvincial Boundary\nInternational Boundary\n0 Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n9\n-2\n8\n1\n2 H 71o  00'E 78 o 00'E\nR", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Issyk\u2013Kul Sustainable \nDevelopment Project (the Project).  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Lake Issyk\u2013Kul (\u201cwarm lake\u201d in Kyrgyz) is the world\u2019s second-largest saline lake; a \nRamsar1 site of globally significant biodiversity; and a United Nations Educational, Scientific and \nCultural Organization (UNESCO)-designated biosphere reserve.2 The lake forms a significant \npart  of  Issyk\u2013Kul  Oblast\u2019s  area,  and  contributes  to  its  economic  growth  through  tourism. \nAttracting about 1 million tourists annually, equivalent to 70% of the country\u2019s annual tourist of \n1.4 million persons, the lake is a major economic driver in the region. With the country\u2019s political \nsituation gradually stabilizing, there is exponential growth in tourist numbers to Kyrgyz Republic, \nmost of them from neighboring Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, and Uzbekistan.  \n \n3.  The country\u2019s supply response to increased tourism is notable, with active construction \nand resorts sprawling around the lake's northern shores, primarily in three cities (Balykchy, \nCholpon\u2013Ata,  and  Karakol).  However,  existing  water  supply  and  sanitation  infrastructure\u2014\nincluding  solid  waste  management\u2014is  decrepit,  dysfunctional,  and  poorly  maintained.  It  is \nunable to serve the high number of tourists, which exceeds the resident population by a factor of \nfour. Excessive pressure on this existing infrastructure is partially responsible for the lake's \npollution. \n \n4.  Project interventions will improve the infrastructure and quality of urban services in the \nregion, foster tourism, and preserve the lake's environment. Feasibility and social studies were \nundertaken through an Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance project.3 Appendix \n1 contains the Project's design and monitoring framework, which will be updated based on \nProject inception baseline survey and implementation progress. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Socioeconomic Context \n5.  Economy.  Issyk\u2013Kul  Oblast  is  spread  over  43,100  square  kilometers  (km),  with \napproximately 430,000 persons (around 8% of the total Kyrgyz Republic population). Karakol \nhas about 67,500 people; Balykchy, 42,000; and Cholpon\u2013Ata, 12,000. The oblast\u2019s gross \nregional product grew from $358 million in 2005 to $540 million in 2007 mainly from gold mining \nat the Kumtor gold deposit, one of the 10 largest gold deposits in the world. Capital investments \nin the oblast have risen from $39 million (2005) to $145 million (2007) but are largely limited to \nthe mining industry due to additional gold deposit finds in the recent past. Urban infrastructure \ninvestments are mainly financed by donor agencies with negligible investments made by the \noblast or central government. The oblast also produces and exports cereals, apples, pears, \npotatoes, livestock, and dairy products.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The Ramsar Convention is an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands, which \ncame into force on 21 December 1975. \n2  As per the United Nations, biosphere reserves combine nature conservation and sustainable development to \nprotect natural and cultural landscapes. The biosphere reserve concept was developed by UNESCO and is a \ndistinction, but it does not confer any legally binding protection on the area. \n3  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to Kyrgyz Republic for the Issyk\u2013Kul Sustainable Development Project. Manila. \n ", "2 \n6.  Tourism. Tourism constitutes about 10% of the oblast's gross regional product. The \ntourist population tends to increase substantially during summers (June through August). The \ntourist inflow is mainly to the city of Cholpon\u2013Ata, but Balykchy and Karakol receive some tourist \ninflows as well. Karakol has a large tourist influx during the winter due to nearby ski resorts. The \nIntegrated  Development  Plan4 for  the  region  focuses  on  the  lake's  northern,  eastern,  and \nsouthern areas, and Government support for tourism and resort development has increased \npressure on urban services and the lake's environment. \n \n2.  Access to Services \n7.  A recent socioeconomic survey5 indicated that urban residents\u2019 top priority is improved \nwater supply and sanitation services. \n(i)  Water  supply. About one quarter of households indicated inadequate water \nsupply for household needs. Waterborne illnesses due to poor water quality were \nsignificant, with 82% of households reporting incidences in the past 5 years. \n(ii)  Sanitation. About 75% of households use dry-pit latrines, and 24% use flush or \npour toilets. About 66% of households surveyed stated they would be willing to \npay for connection to a sewerage system, indicating citizens\u2019 priority for improved \nsanitation. \n(iii)  Solid waste management. Approximately 84% of households stated that a solid \nwaste  collection  service  was  unavailable  on  a  daily  basis.  Waste  disposal \npractices  included  plastic  bottle  and  packaging  collection  by  the  tazalyk \nenterprise from 50% of households, waste incineration by 36% of households, \nand  waste  disposal  into  the  nearest  landfill  or  waste  receptacle  by  8%  of \nhouseholds.  \n \n3.  Social Issues \n8.  Poverty. In 2008, around 39% of the oblast\u2019s population lived in poverty6 and 8% in \nextreme poverty. The poor account for 19% of the project beneficiary population, with the \nextremely poor making up 9%. Within the project area, poverty incidence ranges from 2.6% in \nCholpon\u2013Ata to 10.4% in Karakol and to 31.9% in Balykchy. The social analysis concluded that \nthe poor mostly live in areas without regular water supplies, sewage, and solid waste collection \nservices. They often suffer from serious water supply shortages, poor water quality, sewage \npollution, and poor urban environmental sanitation.  \n \n9.  Gender Analysis. Households headed by women account for 41% of project beneficiary \nhouseholds and are smaller than households headed by men. Single-person households are \nmore often headed by women. Some 87% of households headed by women and 91% of \nhouseholds headed by men receive regular cash income. A higher proportion of women-headed \nhouseholds (20%) live in poverty when compared with men-headed households (18%). The \ntotal number of sick days due to waterborne illnesses is also higher for women (151) than for \nmen  (73).  Women  and  girls  are  primarily  responsible  for  collection  of  household  water, \nhousehold garbage disposal, and care of the sick and elderly. These activities negatively impact \nhealth and cause conflict and stress in communities during rush hours and given limited water \nsupply schedules. Despite an active role in the sector, women lack decision-making powers, \nand their representation in management of water supply and sanitation services is low at 10%. \n \n                                                 \n4  JICA. 2006.

Inadequate Urban Infrastructure and Services \n10.  Appendix 2 summarizes the country and project cities' urban services assessment. \n(i)  Vodokanal enterprises, through a contractual arrangement with cities, provide \nwater supply and sanitation services. The water network serves approximately \n85% of the population but is in poor condition. Water production capacities are \nhigh to meet water requirement for domestic and household irrigation, which \nshould be rectified to address long-term water conservation goals.7 The stated \nnonrevenue water ranges from 25% to 60%, but due to the lack of metering and \nthe poor condition of the system, the actual amount is unknown. Poor water \nquality and lack of water conservation methods are key issues to address. \n(ii)  Extended aeration-based sewage treatment plants were constructed in all three \nproject cities during the Soviet period, but the plants are dilapidated and no \nsewage is currently treated. Population access to the sewerage system is low at \n35% and is limited to residents of apartment blocks only. Dilapidated sewer lines \nresult in sewage infiltration into the ground, resulting in low flows at the sewage \ntreatment  plants.  Moreover,  much  of  the  population  continues  to  rely  on  pit \nlatrines,  a  serious  threat  to  groundwater  quality.  Sewer  rehabilitation  and \nmethods to control sewage flows into the groundwater are of immediate priority. \n(iii)  Private tourist resorts, especially around Cholpon\u2013Ata, are expected to operate \nsewage treatment plants. While most resorts do maintain a plant, monitoring of \nsewage treatment plant operations and the treated effluent quality is inadequate. \nThe exact impact of effluent discharges, if any, on the lake water quality is \nunknown.  Overall,  the  combination  of  partially  operating  central  sewerage \nsystems,  private  self-provision  of  sanitation  facilities,  and  lax  monitoring  of \nsewage discharge from resorts presents a significant threat to Lake Issyk\u2013Kul's \nwater quality. \n(iv)  Tazalyk  enterprises  provide  solid  waste  management  services  based  on \ncontractual arrangements with the cities.8 The region generates daily waste of \n1.5 kilograms per capita but daily collection is low at 50%.9 All waste is disposed \nof at existing dumps in each city, affecting groundwater, and surface water flow \ninto the lake. Waste management and strategies to recycle waste are critical for \nthese cities, in addition to developing sanitary landfills for safe waste disposal. \n \n2.  Institutional Issues \n11.  The oblast administration oversees the functioning of local self-governments (including \ncity administrations) in the region through rayon centers. The city administrations of Balykchy \nand Karakol report directly to the oblast, while that of Cholpon\u2013Ata reports to the Issyk\u2013Kul \nRayon. Vodokanal enterprise and tazalyk enterprise report to the city administration, which is \nheaded by an elected mayor. To improve efficiency and effectiveness of public administration, \nthe Government of Kyrgyz Republic embarked on reform initiatives in 2004, and functional \ndecentralization to local governments was a key initiative. Major decisions included delegation \nof authority and responsibility of urban basic services. However, paucity of capital investment \nfunds, lack of human resources, and poor cost recovery have resulted in inefficient service \ndelivery. \n \n                                                 \n7  For example, the gross per capita production in Balykchy is 666 liters per day. \n8  Tazalyk enterprises are also responsible for street lighting and park maintenance. \n9  About 70%\u201380% of the waste generated is landfill material, 11%\u201320% is organic, and 8%\u201312% is dry recyclables.  \n ", "4 \n12.  The  Government  is  still  in  the  process  of  approving  its  national  water  supply  and \nsanitation policy. A national coordinating or regulatory body also does not exist for the water \nsupply and sanitation sector. Under the National Agency on Local Self-Government Affairs, the \nDepartment of Rural Water Supply is responsible for rural water supply and sanitation and \ncurrently executes donor projects in rural areas. Consequently, water supply and sanitation \nservices in urban centers are managed by vodokanal enterprises. The overfragmentation and \ndecentralization of the water sector has resulted in few economies of scale and diversity of \ncosts. The lack of a database and management information system for sound decision making \nand an overreliance on Soviet consumption norms restrict target definition for service delivery.  \n \n3.  Sustainable Financing \n13.  Public  budget  expenditure  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  is  negligible  and \ncomprises less than 0.3% of central government budget expenditure, and is allocated through \nstate  transfers  to  finance  operating  expenditure  not  capital  expenditure.  Cities  also  rely \nextensively on state revenue transfers that constitute 18%\u201351% of their operating income. A \nreview of project cities' operating accounts in 2008 indicated a deficit in Balykchy and Cholpon\u2013\nAta and a marginal surplus in Karakol confirming the strong dependence on state transfers. \nConsequently, there is no surplus generation for capital investments. Vodokanal enterprises and \ntazalyk enterprises also run into deficits or barely break even. While vodokanal enterprises \noccasionally meet their annual business plan, tazalyk enterprises rely on cities for budgetary \nsupport. Tariffs barely recover operation and maintenance costs, let alone generate surpluses \nfor future capital creation or for leveraging debt. It is therefore imperative to create a culture of \nprudent financial management among the project cities and service utilities. \n \n4.  Environmental Management \n14.  The Biosphere Reserve Directorate (BRD) within the State Agency for Environmental \nProtection and Forestry (SAEPF) is responsible for the lake's environmental management and \nlaw enforcement to preserve the biosphere reserve. However, the BRD requires substantial \nstrengthening (e.g., financial and personnel) to perform its functions and preserve the lake's \nenvironment. Similarly, the Issyk\u2013Kul and Naryn Interregional Department for Environmental \nProtection (IDEP) under the SAEPF plays an important role in environmental management, \nmonitoring of infrastructure projects, and environmental law enforcement. However, paucity of \nfunds severely affects its ability to perform. Building BRD and IDEP capacities is critical for long-\nterm environmental management in the region and to ensure that infrastructure projects comply \nwith relevant environmental safeguards. \n \n5.  External Assistance \n15.  Appendix 3 summarizes external assistance to the country's WSS sector. Donor projects \nin  the  project  area  include  (i)  the  completed  World  Bank  Small  Towns  Infrastructure  and \nCapacity Development Project that aimed to augment the quantity of water supply in Balykchy \nand Cholpon\u2013Ata; (ii) an ongoing water supply project in Karakol ($8 million) financed by the \nSwiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs; and (iii) a proposed sewerage project in Cholpon\u2013\nAta financed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency. As a key component of the Joint \nCountry Support Strategy, 2007\u20132010,10 the Project will ensure that benefits accrued through \ndonor support are synergized to improve urban basic service delivery. The Project is aligned \nwith  the  Joint  Country  Support  Strategy  strategic  framework  and  will  (i)  harmonize  donor \n                                                 \n10  This Joint Country Support Strategy, approved by the Board in 2007, was prepared by ADB, Department for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom, Swiss Development Cooperation, United Nations agencies, and \nthe World Bank Group. This assistance is closely aligned with the Government's development goals. \n ", "5 \ndevelopmental objectives; (ii) collaborate on resource use (i.e., the appropriate use of the \nenvironment  management  and  monitoring  plan);  (iii)  capitalize  on  donor  capacity-building \ninitiatives (e.g., United Nations Development Programme training of tazalyk enterprises staff); \n(iv)  promote  good  governance  and  transparency  concepts;  and  (v)  use  information  and \ncommunication efforts to disseminate project benefits. \n \n6.  Lessons Learned from ADB-Assisted Water Supply and Sanitation Projects \n16.  ADB's water supply and sanitation sector experience in Kyrgyz Republic provides many \ncritical lessons.11 These include the need for (i) rapid commencement of project activities; (ii) \ngreater  coordination  of  government  executing  agencies  and  relevant  local  institutions;  (iii) \nstronger technical, institutional, and administrative capacities at these institutions; and (iv) active \nsupport and participation of project stakeholders and beneficiaries. \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s review of experiences indicated that early capacity building of project executing \nand implementing agencies is required to develop an efficient management system within the \nExecuting Agency (EA) to monitor and supervise project activities. It also emphasized the need \nto  train  key  project  stakeholders  on  implementation  arrangements,  ADB  policies  and \nprocedures, WSS sector development issues, and environmental management issues. During \nproject design and implementation, experiences indicate the need to engage and educate \nproject beneficiaries and stakeholders through public consultations and participation programs. \n \nC.  Development Opportunities \n18.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  country  development  strategy,  2009\u20132011, 12  continues  to \nemphasize environmental sustainability and the need to protect Lake Issyk\u2013Kul. In February \n2009, the Concept of Sustainable Development of the Ecological and Economic System of \nIssyk\u2013Kul was passed through a presidential decree. Subsequently, the Government passed a \nresolution in May 2009 that prioritizes project implementation. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n19.  The Project is expected to improve the health of the resident population in the Issyk\u2013Kul \nOblast and to ensure the environmental preservation of Lake Issyk\u2013Kul. The outcome of the \nProject is improved urban basic service delivery comprising sewerage, sanitation, solid waste \nmanagement, and water supply in the cities of Balykchy, Cholpon\u2013Ata, and Karakol. \n \nB.

The activity will determine the effect on water conservation, \nwillingness to pay, and long-term impact on cost recovery and tariff rationalization. About 8,550 \nwater meters will be installed in the three cities, and vodokanal enterprises members will be \ntrained in meter reading and leak control. By constructing five boreholes with treatment, energy \nefficient  pumps,  storage,  and  protection  facilities  each  in  Balykchy  and  Cholpon\u2013Ata,  the \nsubcomponent  will  improve  the  quality  of  water  supplied.  The  subcomponent  will  include \nconstruction  of  a  new  presedimentation  treatment  tank  at  the  Karakol  water  headworks, \nincluding upgrading of intake, overflow, and drainage structures, which are susceptible to being \nwashed  away  during  floods  and  without  which  potable  water  supply  to  the  city's  resident \npopulation of 67,500 persons is likely to be terminated. The subcomponent will replace a 2 km-\nlong corroded section of the existing transmission main in Balykchy. \n \nd.  Community Upgrading \n24.  This subcomponent will benefit 23,000 persons in all three project cities, and will include \nconstructing (i) water and sanitation facilities in pre-schools and schools; (ii) community water \nand sanitation facilities for a group of households and neighborhoods in distant areas; and (iii) \npublic  conveniences  in  markets,  public  centers,  health  care  organizations,  and  public \ninstitutions.

Based on accurate plans of the water supply and sewerage network, \nthe design and supervision consultants will develop a calibrated network model to assess \nsystem  performance  and  plan  for  extensions  and  reinforcements.  A  domestic  geographic \ninformation system (GIS) consultant firm will provide assistance under the subcomponent.  \n \nc.  Twinning Program and Capacity Building \n27.  This subcomponent will develop vodokanal enterprises capacity and (i) improve urban \ninfrastructure  asset  planning  and  management  practices;  (ii)  improve  human  resources \nmanagement;  (iii)  introduce  measures  to  reduce  nonrevenue  water;  and  (iv)  ensure \nenvironmentally compliant effluent discharge and sludge disposal. A twinning agreement will be \nentered into with a water supply and sanitation utility from a developed or developing ADB \nmember country,13 and specific improvement targets will agree to be achieved at the end of the \ntwinning program. The program will span 3 years. \n \nd.  Performance-Based Service Contracts \n28.  This subcomponent will develop performance-based service contracts for water supply \nmanagement, sewerage management, solid waste collection and transport, and sanitary landfill \nmanagement focusing on performance efficiencies. Entering into performance-based contracts \nis contingent on completion of asset inventory and construction works, and improving financial \nmanagement practices in the cities. Performance-based contracts will be concluded between \ncities and service utilities for water supply and sanitation and solid waste management services.  \n \n3.  Part C: Project Assistance Facility \na.  Infrastructure Design and Implementation \n29.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  through  a  domestic  design  and  supervision \nconsultant  to  help  the  PMO  and  PIO  (i)  strengthen  their  project  management  and \nimplementation  capabilities;  (ii)  prepare  detailed  engineering  designs  for  the  infrastructure \nimprovement  component  of  each  city;  (iii)  assist  in  bid  process  management;  (iv)  support \nconstruction  supervision  and  quality  control  of  civil  works;  and  (v)  contribute  to  benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation by generating baseline data, assessing project impact, and providing \nfeedback to the PMO to make adjustments. The DSC will be engaged to carry out works in \nfuture phases implemented during the Project period. \n \nb.  Information, Education, and Communication Campaign \n30.  The  PIO  will  promote community  awareness of  the  Project  through  an  information, \neducation,  and  communication  (IEC)  campaign,  which  will  also  communicate  the  Project's  \nlong-term benefits. This will increase support from project beneficiaries and stimulate demand \n                                                 \n13  Potential countries include Armenia and Singapore. \n ", "8 \nfor better urban basic services. Beneficiaries will also be made aware of issues such as water \nrates, user charges, and solid waste management fees. Among others, beneficiaries will be \ninformed  on  preventing  environmental  health-related  hazards  and  their  responsibilities  for \nreducing inefficient water use. Hygiene and sanitation education will form a key component of \nthe IEC campaign. A domestic IEC consultant firm or nongovernment organization or civil \nsociety organization will be appointed to assist the PIO. \n \nc.  Project Management and Administration \n31.  Government appointed staff will manage and administer the Project with assistance from \ninternational  and  domestic  consultants.  This  subcomponent  will  provide  project  oversight, \nquality control, ensure safeguard compliance, and undertake social development through the \nproject implementation period. \n \nC.  Special Features \n32.  The  Project  is  ADB's  first  urban  sector  intervention  in  Kyrgyz  Republic.  Its  special \nfeatures include (i) the enterprise resource management subcomponent addressing long-term \nurban management in the region; and (ii) the assessment of institutional, legal, and municipal \nfinances in the urban centers of Issyk\u2013Kul Oblast. Improved enterprise resource management \nunderpins ADB's urban services sector strategy for Kyrgyz Republic, and insights from this \ncomponent will facilitate ADB's urban development programs in Central Asia and the Caucasus. \nDevelopment of performance-based service contracts will also improve the opportunities for \npublic\u2013private partnerships in the water supply and sanitation sector. \n \nD.

The Government confirmed that (i) there will be no onlending of ADF funds to the cities; \nand (ii) cities are not required to provide counterpart funding under the Project. Based on the \ncities\u2019 fiscal assessments, the Government confirmed that city operating accounts barely break \neven, leaving no flexibility for counterpart funding or repaying debt early in the project. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n36.  The Project will be managed and administered through a combination of a central-level \nsteering committee, the Ministry of Finance (Executing Agency), a PMO at the central-level \nwithin the EA, and a PIO under the Issyk\u2013Kul Oblast administration (Implementing Agency). \nBRD  and  IDEP  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  environmental  management  and \nmonitoring plans and ensuring project compliance with ADB and Kyrgyz Republic environmental \nsafeguards. Appendix 7 summarizes the project implementation arrangements. The financial \nmanagement assessment of the EA is summarized in Supplementary Appendix B and rates its \nfinancial management and reporting and monitoring systems capabilities as satisfactory. With \n                                                 \n14  Kyrgyz Republic is classified as a group A developing member country based on its macroeconomic condition. \nGroup A is eligible for ADF funds only (ADB. 2008. Operations Manual. OM A1/BP: Classification and Graduation \nof Developing Member Countries. Manila). The loan and grant mix is finalized based on a performance-based \nallocation formula defined in ADB. 2008. Operations Manual. OM Section A3/BP: Performance-Based Allocation of \nAsian Development Fund Resources. Manila. \n ", "10 \nexperience on previous and ongoing externally financed projects, the Ministry of Finance as the \nEA creates a low-risk environment for the Project.  \n \na.  Steering Committee \n37.  A central-level steering committee will be set up within 1 month of loan and grant \neffectiveness, with full powers to decide on matters related to the Project. A representative of \nthe Prime Minister's Office will be the steering committee's chairperson. The steering committee \nwill oversee progress on the action plan under the President's Decree related to the Issyk\u2013Kul \ndevelopment concept (para. 18) and will be primarily responsible for guiding development in the \nIssyk\u2013Kul Oblast. The steering committee will use the project outcome to frame policies on \nwater  supply  and  sanitation,  and  institutional  effectiveness  for  the  country's  urban  sector \ndevelopment. \n \n38.  The steering committee will have members from relevant Ministries and other state \nentities  as  the  Government  thinks  necessary.  The  PMO  will  be  the  steering  committee's \nsecretariat, and the EA will convene regular meetings in consultation with the chairperson, \nprepare  and  circulate  minutes  of  the  meeting  approved  by  the  chairperson,  and  ensure \ncompliance with all steering committee decisions. The steering committee will meet at least \nonce every 3 months, and the tenure of the steering committee will last until project completion. \n \nb.  Executing Agency \n39.  The EA will be responsible for project oversight. It will hold monthly meetings with the \nPMO and submit progress reports to the steering committee for decision making. It will ensure \nthat project component technical and ecological expertise is sought before awarding contracts \nand/or commencement of construction works. The EA will obtain ADB approval for project \ncomponent  financing,  ensure  compliance  with  project  covenants,  coordinate  with  ADB  on \nmatters related to disbursements, and submit project documents (including audit reports) to \nADB  on  time.  It  will  play  an  active  role  in  monitoring  the  Project's  enterprise  resource \nmanagement component. Specifically related to the procurement process, the EA will monitor \nand review the bid process and coordinate with ADB on all approvals. \n \nc.  Project Management Office \n40.  A central-level PMO will be established at the EA. The PMO will be led by a full-time \nproject director who will be responsible for overall project management and administration. This \nproject director will be supported by a fiduciary unit comprising a procurement expert, financial \nmanager, domestic project performance monitoring specialist, an office manager/translator, and \noffice support. The PMO will (i) oversee project accounting and auditing; (ii) secure technical \nexpertise and ecological expertise for all civil works prior to bidding; (iii) carry out project \nperformance monitoring system surveys; (iv) ensure city administrations comply with project \ncovenants;  (v)  with  assistance  of  the  Project  consultants,  invite  bids,  evaluate  them,  and \nprepare bid evaluation reports for the EA and, subsequently, for ADB approval; (vi) award \ncontracts; and (vii) prepare quarterly progress reports. \n \nd.  Project Implementation Office \n41.  An oblast-level PIO, led by a full-time project manager, will be responsible for overall \nproject  implementation  and  supervision,  and  will  report  directly  to  the  project  director  and \ngovernor  of  Issyk\u2013Kul  Oblast.  The  project  manager  will  be  assisted  by  three  international \nspecialists  (for  water  supply  and  sanitation,  environmental  management,  and  solid  waste \n ", "11 \nmanagement),  a  domestic  social  and  gender  development  specialist,  accountant,  office \nmanager/translator, information technology specialist, and other support staff members. \n \n42.

Implementation Period \n43.  The Project will be implemented over a 5-year period. Appendix 8  summarizes the \nproject implementation schedule. \n \n3.  Procurement \n44.  The  PMO  will  procure  works,  goods,  and  services  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended to date) based on the procurement plan presented \nin Appendix 9. The procurement plan is for an 18-month period and will be updated annually by \nthe EA. Civil works, equipment, and material will be procured through international competitive \nbidding (ICB) and national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures as appropriate. \n(i)  Civil  works  includes  rehabilitation  of  sewerage  systems  (two  ICB  contracts), \nwater supply improvement (two ICB contracts), construction of sanitary landfills \n(ICB and NCB contracts, turnkey), and construction of community water and \nsanitation facilities (three NCB contracts).   \n(ii)  Goods  include  equipment  and  selected  materials  for  vodokanal  enterprises, \ntazalyk enterprises, and the PMO (one ICB contract), environmental monitoring \nequipment for IDEP and BRD (one NCB contract) and waste collection and \nassociated equipment (one NCB contract). ADB\u2019s shopping procedures will apply \nto off-the-shelf items and standard products costing the equivalent of $100,000 or \nless. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n45.  Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended to date) using quality- and cost-based selection for firms \nand government procedures acceptable to ADB for individuals. Simplified technical proposals or \nfull technical proposals, as appropriate, will be required from firms. Outline terms of reference \nfor consulting firms are detailed in Supplementary Appendixes C through F. The EA will ensure \nthat position-based terms of reference (for each expert) will be used when it invites shortlisted \nconsultants. Details on consulting services are elaborated in Appendix 9. \n \n46.  Individual Specialists. The PMO will appoint six individual specialists to support the \nPMO  and  PIO  in  overseeing  consulting  services.  Three  international  specialists  (40  \nperson-months  of  water  and  sewerage,  environmental  management,  and  solid  waste \nmanagement strategy development) will provide third-party quality assurance on engineering \ndesigns  and  construction  supervision,  update  the  environmental  impact  assessment  and \n ", "12 \naccordingly revise the environmental management plan, and develop a waste management \nstrategy  to  reduce  waste  generation  and  disposal.  Three  domestic  specialists  (90  \nperson-months  of  project  performance  monitoring,  social  and  gender  development,  and \nprocurement expertise) will assist the PIO. \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n47.  To  facilitate  timely  implementation  of  the  Project,  ADB  has  approved  (i)  advance \ncontracting; and (ii) retroactive financing of eligible expenditures up to 20% of the proposed loan \nand grant, incurred prior to effectiveness but not earlier than 12 months before the date of \nsigning  of  the  Financing  Agreement.  The  Government  acknowledges  that  any  approval  of \nadvance contracting and/or retroactive financing will not constitute a commitment by ADB to \nfinance the related Project. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n48.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  Ministry  of  Finance.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the loan and grant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the \nright of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n7.  Transparency and Good Governance \n49.  For greater transparency and accountability, the Government will disclose to the public, \nand update annually, the current status of the Project and how the proceeds of the loan and \ngrant are used. For each contract financed under the Project, the EA will disclose on its and the \nProject's website information on (i) the list of participating bidders; (ii) the name of the winning \nbidder; (iii) basic details on bidding procedures and procurement methods adopted; (iv) amount \nof contract awarded; (v) the list of goods and services, including consulting services procured; \nand (vi) the intended and actual use of the loan and grant proceeds. \n \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n50.  Loan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). An imprest account will be \nestablished by the EA separately for the loan and grant component with a commercial bank \nacceptable to ADB, to expedite project implementation through timely releases. The EA is \nconversant with financial management of project funds as established through the financial \nmanagement agreement. The amount to be deposited into each imprest account will not exceed \n10% of the respective loan or grant, or the estimated expenditure to be funded through each \nimprest  account  for  the  next  6  months,  whichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be \nestablished, managed, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \nand detailed arrangements agreed to by the Government and ADB.15 ADB\u2019s statement-of-\nexpenditure procedure may be used to reimburse eligible expenditure and to liquidate advances \nmade into the imprest accounts. Any individual payments to be liquidated or reimbursed will not \nexceed the equivalent of $100,000. \n                                                 \n15 Bank charges will be financed from the loan and grant amount. \n ", "13 \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n51.  Detailed  consolidated  annual  project  accounts,  as  maintained  by  the  PMO,  will  be \naudited by duly qualified and independent auditors and will be submitted to ADB within 6 \nmonths of the close of each fiscal year. The annual audit report will also include a separate \naudit opinion on the use of imprest accounts and statement-of-expenditure procedure. The \nProject will maintain separate records and accounts by funding source (loan and grant). \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n52.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  project  performance  monitoring \nsystem is established within 6 months of loan and grant effectiveness. The project performance \nmonitoring system will track project implementation activities, target dates, expected outcomes, \nand assigned responsibilities. Some tasks will be outsourced to external contractors; others will \nform part of routine PMO reporting. Monitoring indicators will be formulated, discussed, and \nagreed to by the EA, oblast and city administrations, SAEPF, and ADB. Within 6 months of loan \nand grant  effectiveness, the PMO will conduct initial baseline physical and socioeconomic \nsurveys  and  submit  a  detailed  implementation  plan  for  benchmarking  information  and \nmonitoring performance. This will be subject to ADB\u2019s review and concurrence. The PMO will \nsubmit annual reports to ADB through the project period. \n \n11.  Project Review \n53.  Project performance will be reviewed first by the EA, second by the steering committee, \nand third by ADB. The first-level review will be conducted every month by the EA. It will be \nbased on monthly performance reports for each project city, prepared by the PMO. The report \nwill be sent to the oblast administration, EA, steering committee, and ADB. The second-level \nreview will be conducted every quarter by the steering committee. The monthly reports on \nproject  performance,  major  policy  issues,  and  actions  required  or  taken  by  the  respective \nauthorities  will  be  reviewed.  The  results  will  be  circulated  to  ADB,  EA,  oblast  and  city \nadministrations, and SAEPF. The third-level review will be conducted by ADB every 6 months \nthroughout the project implementation period. A comprehensive midterm review will be carried \nout 24 months after the date of loan and grant effectiveness to identify problems or weaknesses \nin implementation arrangements and to agree on any corrective measures. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Major Benefits and Impacts \n1.  Institutional and Policy \n54.  The  Project  strongly  hinges  on  institutional  effectiveness  and  building  strong  local  \nself-governments to manage urban basic services. \n(i)  It will improve financial management practices in the project cities, vodokanal \nenterprises, and tazalyk enterprises, and create a culture of generating revenue \nsurpluses for equity investments into capital assets or leverage for debt.  \n(ii)  The database on asset inventory and conditions will help vodokanal enterprises \nidentify infrastructure improvements in the long term based on a well-developed \nasset management and maintenance system.  \n(iii)  Through the twinning program, vodokanal enterprises will build staff capacity to \nefficiently manage services.   \n \n ", "14 \n55.  Lessons learned will provide the Government with (i) approaches to develop the national \nwater supply and sanitation policy; (ii) a basis for developing a water supply and sanitation \ninvestment plan to upgrade and expand water supply and sanitation systems; (iii) pointers to \nimprove financial management in local governments across urban centers in the country; and \n(iv) opportunities to develop vodokanal enterprises' staff capacity through a twinning network in \nthe region. Supplementary Appendix G  provides insights into the institutional and financial \nsustainability  approach  under  the  Project,  providing  a  backdrop  for  future  urban  sector \ndevelopment in the country. \n \n2.  Social \n56.  The primary beneficiaries of the Project are the residents of the three cities and tourists. \nSome households will benefit manifold, as they will experience improvement in water supply, \nsanitation, and solid waste management services. More specifically, they include (i) households \nthat are impacted when members suffer from waterborne illnesses resulting from insufficient or \npoor-quality water; (ii) people using markets, hospitals, clinics, and other public institutions with \npoor water supply and sanitation facilities (e.g., public toilets); (iii) schoolchildren and teachers \nat schools with poor water supply and sanitation facilities; and (iv) poor households using pit \nlatrines  and  lacking  community  septic  tanks.  General  and  more  widespread  benefits  are \nexpected  from  the  development  of  sanitary  landfills  and  improvements  to  solid  waste \nmanagement practices, and connecting households, hotels, guesthouses, and institutions to the \nrehabilitated sewerage system. Appendix 10 summarizes the Project's poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy. \n \n57.  The poverty and social assessment indicates that women strongly support the Project \nacross all components. Women perceive that the Project will improve their living environments, \ncreate  employment  opportunities,  and  reduce  the  incidence  of  waterborne  illnesses  and \nassociated costs. Implementation of the gender action plan detailed in Appendix 11 will enhance \nbenefits to women through a training and awareness-raising program focusing on drinking water \nsafety,  water  source  protection  and  treatment,  water  and  environmental  sanitation  and \ndiseases, toilet renovation, and hygiene and sanitation education. \n \n3.  Financial Analysis \n58.  Financial analysis and cash-flow statements were prepared for vodokanal enterprises \nand tazalyk enterprises. Fiscal analysis of city finances was also conducted to determine long-\nterm prospects of generating revenue surpluses to provide equity for capital investments or \ncollateral  for  leveraging  debt.  Appendix  12  summarizes  the  project  financial  analysis,  and \nSupplementary Appendix H provides the spreadsheets. Results indicate the following. \n(i)  The Project is financially viable, and the average financial internal rate of return \nin the base case is 15.90% for water supply and sanitation and 15.40% for solid \nwaste management, exceeding the weighted average cost of capital estimated at \n15.36%. The average financial net present value in the base case is $0.27 million \nfor water supply and sanitation and $0.02 million for solid waste management. \nSensitivity analysis indicates that the subcomponent financial internal rates of \nreturn are stressed under various conditions, implying a need for efficient project \nimplementation and rapidly achieved physical and financial targets.  \n(ii)  The cities' financial management requires considerable improvements, especially \nefforts to enhance city own-tax revenues and to reduce dependence on state \ntransfers  in  the  long-term.16 The  Project  will  ensure  cities  make  informed \n                                                 \n16  State transfers account for approximately 50% of the city's annual operating revenues. \n ", "15 \ndecisions on revenue enhancement and expenditure management measures by \nimplementing the MIS and accounting subcomponent. \n(iii)  Vodokanal enterprises and tazalyk enterprises revenue base improvement is \ncontingent on tariff rationalization. The analysis indicates a need to raise tariffs \nsubstantially from the current base to meet system operating costs.17 Tariffs can \nalso be raised only after the system begins to show improved performance and \ncustomers perceive benefits. The Project proposes viability gap funding to bridge \nthe shortfall in revenues for 2010\u20132015 (during implementation) and for 2016\u2013\n2029  (during  operations)  to  meet  financial  internal  rate  of  return  conditions. \nImplementing the enterprise resource management subcomponent in parallel will \nhelp  improve  the  financial  performance  of  cities,  vodokanal  enterprises,  and \ntazalyk enterprises and reduce dependency on viability gap funding after 2029. \n(iv)  To  achieve  an  operating  ratio  less  than  unity,  a  key  determinant  to  assess \nfinancial  performance  of  vodokanal  enterprises  and  tazalyk  enterprises,  the \nProject will ensure (a) progressive tariff increases based on cost recovery and \nconsumer  affordability  principles;  and  (b)  that  the  Government  will  make \navailable viability gap funding to ensure service sustainability.  \n \n59.  To ensure project ownership, state revenue transfers will include viability gap funding to \ncities. The funding will be made contingent on vodokanal enterprises and tazalyk enterprises \nmeeting performance standards set out in the service utilities' annual operations plan ratified by \nthe city councils. For all three cities, current estimates of viability gap funding required to meet \nonly operating expenditure shortfalls is $6.5 million during 2010\u20132015 and $8 million during \n2016\u20132029. The actual viability gap funding will be established by January 2012 based on \nenterprise resource management component outputs. \n \n4.  Economic Analysis \n60.  Economic analysis was based on the results of a socioeconomic survey and drew from \nrelevant statistics available at the country level, especially that available from the National \nStatistics Committee. The socioeconomic survey covered 514 households, randomly sampled in \nthe three project cities. Focus group discussions provided further substantiation on service \nperception and demand for services. Appendix 13 summarizes the economic analysis, and \nSupplementary Appendix I provides the spreadsheets. Results indicate the following. \n(i)  The Project is economically viable, and the average economic internal rate of \nreturn in the base case is 27.8% for water supply and sanitation and 19.5% for \nsolid waste management, exceeding the economic opportunity cost of capital \nassumed at 12.0%. The average economic net present value in the base case \nwas $3.17 million for water supply and sanitation and $0.69 million for solid \nwaste management. A sensitivity analysis conducted to test the robustness of \neconomic viability indicated that in all cases, subcomponent economic internal \nrates of return surpass the economic opportunity cost of capital.   \n(ii)  The  average  economic  benefit\u2013cost  ratio for the  Project  was  1.42 for  water \nsupply and sanitation and 1.21 for solid waste management, denoting feasibility. \nEconomic  benefits  were  derived  based  on  resource  cost  savings  (e.g.,  time \nsavings and coping costs savings), health benefits, and benefits from expanding \n                                                 \n17  The estimated average annual operating expenditure for water and sanitation is 180% of the estimated annual \nwater supply and sanitation revenue. The average annual operating expenditure for solid waste management is \n200% of the estimated annual revenue. The viability gap fund was estimated for the following scenarios: (i) to meet \noperation and maintenance costs alone; (ii) to meet operation and maintenance costs and depreciation; and (iii) to \nmeet  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  depreciation,  and  debt  (as  a  determinant  of  commercially  viable \noperations). \n ", "16 \nthe  existing  water  supply.  Economic  capital  and  annual  operation  and \nmaintenance costs were derived from financial cost estimates.  \n \n5.  Environmental Safeguards \n61.  The Project was classified as environmental category A under ADB's Environment Policy \n(2002) as its subcomponents are located in the Issyk\u2013Kul Biosphere Reserve, which includes \nseveral protected wetlands registered under the Ramsar Convention. As part of the project \npreparatory technical assistance,18 an environmental impact assessment (EIA) was carried out \nfor all subcomponents. Early in the environmental assessment process, relevant environment \ninformation  was  disclosed  to  likely  affected  people  through  stakeholder  consultations, \nworkshops,  and  focus  group  discussions.  The  summary  EIA  report  in  Russian  was  also \ndisclosed by city governments and reviewed by SAEPF and its regional departments. News \narticles in local newspapers preceded the consultations, indicating the EIA content and its \navailability with the city governments. Stakeholder comments from consultations were integrated \ninto the Project. In accordance with ADB's Public Communications Policy (2005), the summary \nEIA  was  posted  on  the  ADB  website  on  1  June  2009  to  meet  the  120-day  disclosure \nrequirement before Board consideration of the Project. The EIA is in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \n62.  To ensure that the biosphere reserve is not affected by project activities, subcomponents \nhave  been  suitably  located.  Location  of  sanitary  landfills  is  critical.  In  Balykchy  and  \nCholpon\u2013Ata, the project component sites are located in areas designated for improvement, and \nin Karakol, the project component site is in the transition zone.  \n \n63.  An efficient, detailed engineering design will mitigate any localized and/or temporary \nimpacts.  Relevant  environmental  mitigation  measures  specified  in  the  ADB-approved \nenvironmental management and monitoring plan will be updated during detailed engineering \ndesign and be incorporated in bidding documents and civil works contracts. Impacts during \noperations will be mitigated through effective implementation of the environmental management \nplan. The following measures will mitigate key impacts.  \n(i)  Location.  Buffer  zones  within  and  buffer  strips  with  restricted  development \naround  sanitary  landfill  sites  will  mitigate  moderate  but  permanent  location \nimpacts. \n(ii)  Construction. Good construction techniques, provision of standby equipment in \ncase  of  power  failures  and  disruptions,  soil  surface  stabilization,  and  safe \ndisposal of contaminated water and oil will mitigate moderate to severe impacts. \nThe impacts are anticipated from groundwork and transport activities; exhaust, \ngas, oil, and fuel spills; and soil excavation and storage causing runoffs and  \nsoil-level alteration. \n(iii)  Seismic activity. Hydrogeological and geotechnical investigations will form the \nbasis for  designs,  choice  of  materials,  and  construction methods  to  mitigate \nsevere impacts through structural damage and sinking of foundations and soil. \n(iv)  Operations.  Effective  implementation  of  sludge  management  plans, \noccupational  and  safety  plans,  and  emergency  response  plans  will  mitigate \nsystem operations impacts resulting from leaks, spillovers, and sludge disposal; \nwindblown waste; gases emitted from landfills; and improper closure of existing \ndumps.  \n \n64.  The state ecological expertise, complying with Kyrgyz Republic laws on environmental \nclearance, will be made mandatory before bidding, and no contracts will be awarded without \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to Kyrgyz Republic for the Issyk\u2013Kul Sustainable Development Project. Manila. \n ", "17 \nsecuring approval from the state ecological expertise. Kyrgyz Republic regulations on official \npublic participation through the public ecological expertise will form a core part of the Project. \nThe public ecological expertise involves citizens, local administrations, and public associations, \nusually represented by a nongovernment organization known as the independent ecological \nexpertise. The independent ecological expertise will provide third-party quality assurance and \nensure effective environmental management plan implementation; it will also address public \ngrievances through the public ecological expertise process. \n \n65.  The environmental management and monitoring plan will be implemented by BRD and \nIDEP. IDEP will be directly responsible for mitigating and monitoring impacts during project \ndesign, construction, and operation. BRD will complement IDEP's activities through a parallel \nmonitoring function and ensure that project activities comply with environmental regulations \nwithin the biosphere reserve. The Project will ensure both IDEP and BRD are adequately \nequipped to perform these functions. It will ensure institutional effectiveness through on-the-job \ntraining in inspection and monitoring techniques and fund the procurement of monitoring and \nlaboratory  equipment  for  effective  environmental  management  plan  implementation.  The \ninternational  environment  specialist  at  the  PIO  will  provide  training  to  staff  members  on \nmonitoring and mitigation activities and ensure that the plan is updated as required. \n \n6.  Social Safeguards \n66.  The Project will not have any land acquisition and resettlement impact as documented in \ndue  diligence  reports  prepared  for  each  of  the  three  project  cities  and  included  in \nSupplementary Appendix K. The Project has chosen existing sites for siting bulk facilities and \nmade all efforts to avoid land acquisition and resettlement impacts by choosing appropriate \ndesign options and by prioritizing rehabilitation and reconstruction of existing facilities. New \nconstruction,  to  the  extent  feasible,  will  be  done  on  unused  land  already  owned  by  the \nGovernment. The due diligence reports were prepared recognizing ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement (1995) and applicable laws and regulations of Kyrgyz Republic. The Project is not \nexpected to affect indigenous people as defined under ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples \n(1998).  The  project  areas  are  fairly  homogenous,  with  majority  Kyrgyz  and  other  ethnic \nminorities comprising Kazakhs, Russians, and Uzbeks. These ethnic groups do not differ in their \nneeds or levels of water supply or sanitation services, and all will benefit from project activities. \n \nB.  Major Risks and Mitigation Measures \n1.  Risks \n67.  Potential  risks  associated  with  the  Project  include  (i)  lack  of  commitment  by  city \nadministrations to undertake or implement reforms in urban and financial management, and \ninability to implement the financial improvement action plan; (ii) inability of government staff to \nimplement the environmental management and monitoring plan; (iii) sudden increase in cost of \nconstruction  items;  (iv)  insufficient  incentives  by  the  Government  to  ensure  vodokanal \nenterprises and tazalyk enterprises staff provide efficient service delivery; and (v) lack of viability \ngap funding from the Government to sustain urban services. \n \n2.  Mitigation Measures \n68.  Early establishment of the PMO and PIO and commencement of surveys for engineering \ndesigns  and  information,  education,  and  communication  campaign  to  generate  community \nawareness will mitigate start-up delays. Efficiently functioning PMO and PIO will ensure the \nproject  is  completed  on  time  and  sudden  price  rise  of  construction  items  is  adequately \naccommodated. The Prime Minister's Office has direct control over the Project's objectives and \n ", "18 \nwill monitor activities, improving the urban management and financial performance of cities. \nAppointing the Ministry of Finance as the Executing Agency cements commitment for viability \ngap funding as a key line item in the national budget as the Ministry of Finance prepares and \ndisburses funds under the medium-term budgetary framework. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n69.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and Ministry of Finance have \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal document. \n(i)  The Government will establish the steering committee and hold the first meeting \nno later than 3 months following loan and grant effectiveness. \n(ii)  The Government will ensure smooth fund flow in accordance with the agreed \nmechanism. The corresponding government contribution, necessary to finance \nproject  activities,  will  be  made  available  on  time  throughout  the  project \nimplementation period.  \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that (a) the Project is carried out in compliance with \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  and  relevant  national  environmental  laws  and \nregulations;  (b)  relevant  environmental  mitigation  measures  specified  in  the  \nADB-approved environmental management and monitoring plan updated during \ndetailed  engineering  design  are  incorporated  in  bidding  documents  and  civil \nworks contracts; (c) no bidding documents will be issued before approval of the \nupdated/final  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  by  ADB  and \nbefore  securing  State  Ecological  Expertise;  (d)  all  mitigation  measures  and \nmonitoring  requirements  set  out  in  the  environmental  management  and \nmonitoring plan will be implemented and fulfilled, respectively, and supervised \nthroughout project implementation; and (e) project environmental performance \nwill  be  monitored,  and  a  report  describing  the  progress  of  environmental \nmanagement plan implementation including issues and recommendations will be \nsubmitted to ADB semiannually.  \n(iv)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  any  unanticipated  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  activities  under  the  Project  are  implemented  based  on  a \nresettlement  plan  prepared  in  accordance  with  applicable  local  laws  and \nregulations, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and ADB's Policy on \nIndigenous Peoples. The Government and ADB will agree on the resettlement \nplan before implementation. The EA will disclose all plans to the public and \nsubmit them to ADB for approval. Any civil works will be commenced only after \nland has been acquired and affected people are compensated at full replacement \ncost. The Government will ensure all recommendations in the Project's land \nacquisition and resettlement due diligence report is implemented and reported to \nADB. \n(v)  The Government and the EA will ensure that civil works contracts incorporate \nprovisions to the effect that contractors: (a) will carry out HIV/AIDS awareness \nand prevention programs for labor, and disseminate information at worksites on \nrisks of sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS as part of health and safety \nmeasures for those employed during construction; (b) will not employ or use \nchildren as labor; and (c) follow and implement all statutory provisions on labor \n(including  equal  pay  for  equal  work),  health,  safety,  welfare,  sanitation,  and \nworking conditions. \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that the gender action plan as set out in Appendix \n11 is implemented in a timely manner. \n ", "19 \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that all project cities will prepare and implement a \nfinancial improvement action plan to revise the water, sewerage, and solid waste \nmanagement fees to meet at least operation and maintenance cost of services. \nThe Government will ensure that this plan is prepared by January 2011. \n(viii)  The  Government  and  the  EA  will  ensure  that  viability  gap  funding  is  made \navailable  to  cities  (and  consequently  to  vodokanal  enterprises  and  tazalyk \nenterprises) based on annual operating plans approved by the city councils. To \nensure future sustainability of vodokanal enterprises and tazalyk enterprises, the \nGovernment  shall  progressively  implement  tariff  increases  with  the  goal  of \nachieving full cost recovery, subject to consumer affordability. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan and Grant Disbursement \n70.  The Government shall have appointed the project director and finance manager at the \nPMO and the project manager and accountant at the PIO. It shall have established the PMO \nand PIO. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n71.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and the proposed grant would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove \n \n(i)  the loan

Kyrgyz Republic is the second smallest of the five former Soviet Central Asian republics, \nwith a land area of only 198,500 square kilometers. It is located east of People\u2019s Republic of \nChina and south of Kazakhstan, and it also shares borders with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The \nTian Shan mountain range covers 80% of the country, while the remainder is valleys and \nbasins. Lake Issyk\u2013Kul, in northwestern Tian Shan, is the second-largest saline lake in the \nworld and a major tourist attraction. The population of Kyrgyz Republic is estimated at 5.2 \nmillion (50.7% women and 49.3% men), of which 1.8 million (35%) live in urban areas. The \ncountry's population density is 26 persons per square kilometer, which is relatively low.  \n \n2.  There are 25 urban settlements in Kyrgyz Republic. Both country and urban populations \nhave been increasing, but at a declining rate. The urban population increased from 1.10 million \nin 1970 to 1.67 million in 1990, and to 1.80 million in 2007. The growth rate, however, declined \nfrom 3.4% in 1970 to 1.6% in 1990, and to 1.3% in 2007. Furthermore, the percent of urban \npopulation has declined from 38% in 1990 to about 35% in 1998, and it has remained relatively \nsteady since then. Both the country and urban populations are expected to grow at 1% over the \nnext 20 years\u2014the urban population is expected to reach 2.2 million by 2030.  \n \n3.  Kyrgyz Republic is a low-income country, and the gross domestic product per capita was \n$715 in 2007. In 2005, 43.1% of the population lived below the national poverty line. In urban \nareas, 29.8% of population lived below the poverty line, and in rural areas, 50.8% of the \npopulation lived below the poverty line. Also, unlike rural poverty, urban poverty has decreased \nsignificantly from 41.2% in 2001 to 35.7% in 2003, and to 29.8% in 2005. Unemployment was \nrelatively low at 8.27% in 2006, but it may have increased since then due to the global economic \ncrisis.  \n \n4.  Adult literacy is high, at 99.3% for the adult population. There is little difference in literacy \nbetween genders, with 99.0% literacy among adult females and 99.5% literacy among adult \nmales. Primary school enrollment is high at 95.3% of the total population, with a completion rate \nof 94.7%. Secondary enrollment is 86.4% of the total population, and tertiary enrollment is \n42.8% of the total population.  \n \n5.  Life expectancy at birth is 65.3 years as measured for 2000\u20132005. The infant mortality \nrate in 2005 was 58 deaths per 1,000 live births, and the under age 5 years mortality rate was \n67 per 1,000 live births. The human development index is 0.696, which ranks Kyrgyz Republic \n116th out of 177 countries in the United Nations 2007/2008 Human Development Report.1 This \nranking  reflects  both  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2014it  scores  well  in \nliteracy and education, but is dragged down by low incomes and short life expectancy. Kyrgyz \nRepublic scores 0.692 on the gender-related development index and ranks it 53 out of 156 \ncountries in the report, and shows reasonably high gender equality in Kyrgyz Republic.  \n \n6.  Urban Services in Kyrgyz Republic. Although most of the urban population lives in \nSoviet-style apartment blocks, some live in novostroiki. About 56.0% of urban residents have \npiped water in their homes, and another 42.3% rely on street water taps. Water quality is poor; \nin 2007, about 11% of water tests failed on microbiological parameters. The water quantity is \nlimited, and the supply is intermittent. Most of the water supply infrastructure was built in 1960s \n                                                 \n1  United Nations Development Programme. 2007. The Human Development Report 2007/2008. New York. \n ", "  Appendix 2  25 \nand is in poor condition today. In addition, about 75% of the urban population has access to \nsanitation services. Population access to sewerage facilities is 21%\u2014in Bishkek, it is 78%, while \nin other regions, it is about 10%. Most sewage treatment plants are not operational, or are \nbarely operational. Waterborne illnesses, such as typhoid and parasitic diseases, are a major \nproblem. Finally, solid waste collection and disposal systems are inadequate. Data on the solid \nwaste management are scarce, but 1997 statistics indicate that only 28.5% of the population is \nserved by regular municipal waste collection services. Out of 155 dumps around the country, \nonly one can be considered a full sanitary landfill. \n \nB.  Urban Services in Issyk\u2013Kul \n \n7.  There were 432,556 people in Issyk\u2013Kul Oblast in 2007, which is around 8% of the \ncountry\u2019s total population. In 2007, around 39% of the oblast\u2019s population lived in poverty. There \nare three major cities: Karakol (67,500 people), Balykchy (42,000 people), and Cholpon\u2013Ata \n(12,000). Lake Issyk\u2013Kul is a major tourist area, and the oblast\u2019s population tends to increase \nduring the summer thanks to tourists. Being a protected site, environmental preservation of the \nlake takes high priority when considering the oblast's development. \n \n  1.  Water Supply \n \n8.  Water  supply  services  are  provided  by  vodokanal  enterprises,  which  are  public \nenterprises.  Water  supply  systems  in  the  three  cities  cover  approximately  85%  of  the \npopulation, were built during the Soviet period, and are in poor condition. Karakol (13,000 cubic \nmeter per day) and Cholpon\u2013Ata (5,650 cum per day) use a mix of surface and groundwater \nsources, while Balykchy (28,000 cum per day) only uses groundwater sources. Gross per capita \nproduction is high the three centers at 666 liters per capita per day (lpcd) in Balykchy, 471 lpcd \nin  Cholpon\u2013Ata,  and  192  lpcd  in  Karakol.  All  cities  also  supply  continuous  water  to  the \nconnected population. Nonrevenue water is unknown, and vodokanal enterprises estimates \nrange from 25% to 60%. Net per capita supplies are high due to piped water being used for \nirrigation. The water quality needs substantial improvement as it is biologically contaminated.  \n \n  2.  Sewerage and Sanitation \n \n9.  Vodokanal  enterprises  also  operate  the  sewerage  systems.  Population  access  to \nsewerage systems is low at about 35% or less in the three centers. Sewage treatment plants in \nBalykchy (36,000 cum per day), Cholpon\u2013Ata (25,000 cum per day), and Karakol (22,000 cum \nper day) were constructed on extended aeration technology but now are dilapidated. Only the \nsewage treatment plant in Karakol is partially operational. Much of the population continues to \nrely on pit latrines, which present a serious risk to groundwater contamination and consequent \ncontamination  of  the  lake.  Many  tourist  resorts,  especially  around  Cholpon\u2013Ata,  generate \ndomestic sewage and are required to have their own wastewater treatment facilities. However, \nthe monitoring of operation and discharge quality from these facilities has been inadequate, and \nthe impact on lake water quality is unknown. Overall, the combination of partially operating \ncentral sewerage systems, private self-provision of sanitation facilities, and lax monitoring of \nwastewater discharge from resorts presents a significant threat to lake quality. \n \n  3.  Solid Waste Management \n \n10.  Solid  waste  management  services  are  provided  by  communal  utilities  (tazalyk \nenterprises), which also take care of town maintenance and services such as street lighting and \npark maintenance. The region has a substantially high per capita waste generation rate at 1.5 \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nkilograms per person, with a total daily waste of 200 metric tons (MT) generated in the three \ncities, including waste from resorts (e.g., Balykchy, 64 MT; Cholpon\u2013Ata, 34 MT; and Karakol, \n101 MT). About 70%\u201380% of the waste generated is landfill material, while 11%\u201320% is organic \nand 8%\u201312% is dry recyclables. Domestic and commercial waste generation is at a 3:1 ratio. \nAbout 50% of the waste generated is collected and disposed at existing open dumps in the \nthree cities. Safe disposal of medical waste is absent in all cities.2 In addition, the tazalyk \nenterprises in Karakol and Cholpon\u2013Ata are unable to cover their operating costs from their \nrevenues, and instead rely on budgetary transfers. Balykchy\u2019s tazalyk enterpise can cover its \noperating costs but relies on budgetary transfers for investments.  \n \nC.  City and Utility Finances \n \n  1.  City Finances \n \n11.  In  2008,  revenue  surplus  on  operating  accounts  was  generated  in  Karakol  ($0.35 \nmillion),  while  both  Balykchy  (\u2013$0.36  million)  and  Cholpon\u2013Ata  (\u2013$0.01  million)  generated \ndeficits. The operating incomes for the cities varied from $1 million in Cholpon\u2013Ata to $2.8 \nmillion in Karakol. Central transfers constituted 18%\u201351% of operating incomes, while own-tax \nrevenues accounted for 39%\u201359%. Salaries constituted 34%\u201358% of operating expenditures, \nand operating expenditures ranged from $1 million in Cholpon\u2013Ata to $2.5 million in Karakol. \nNontax sources comprising water, sewerage, and solid waste charges were not accounted for \nas they form the income base for vodokanal enterprises and tazalyk enterprises, which are \nseparate profit centers. \n \n12.  The operating ratio in Karakol was lower than unity for the 2004\u20132008 period (5 years) \nindicating prudent financial management. Similar performances were witnessed in Balykchy and \nCholpon\u2013Ata during the years 2006 and 2007. However, the surplus build-up is unable to \nsubsidize water, sewerage, and solid waste management services and infuse equity or leverage \ndebt for capital creation.  \n \n  2.  Vodokanal Enterprises Finances \n \n13.  The vodokanal enterprises in Karakol and Balykchy are unable to recover operating \ncosts from their revenues and rely on budgetary support. Cholpon\u2013Ata\u2019s vodokanal enterprise is \njust able to cover its operating costs. None of the vodokanal enterprises are able to cover \ncapital  expenditures.  Vodokanal  enterprises'  operating  income  ranges  from  $0.11  million \n(Karakol) to $0.25 million (Cholpon\u2013Ata). Collections are 70% in Karakol, 90% in Cholpon\u2013Ata, \nand 90% in Balykchy. Domestic water tariffs range from $0.03 per cum in Karakol to $0.09 per \ncum in Cholpon\u2013Ata, while nondomestic water tariffs range from $0.30 per cum in Karakol to \n$0.48 per cum in Cholpon\u2013Ata. Collections from commercial consumers constitute about 40% of \nthe operating income and are the largest income source. Domestic sewerage tariffs range from \n$0.30 per cum in Karakol to $0.09 per cum in Cholpon\u2013Ata, and nondomestic and commercial \nsewage charges range from $0.27 per cum in Karakol and Balykchy to $0.42 per cum in \nCholpon\u2013Ata. The current tariffs do not cover operation and maintenance costs. For improved \ncash inflows, vodokanal enterprises must provide better services so customers are willing to pay \nan increased tariff. Investment in assets, operations and maintenance equipment, and training is \nlikely to result in better services. \n \n                                                 \n2  Balykchy alone produces 3 kilograms of placenta daily and lacks appropriate mechanisms to dispose of it. \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \n14.  Vodokanal enterprises expenditures are high due to operational inefficiency arising from \nthe aging system and lack of vehicles, tools, and equipment. The expenses of Cholpon\u2013Ata\u2019s \nvodokanal ($0.24 million) are within its operating income, while those of Balykchy ($0.30 million) \nand Karakol ($0.34 million) far exceed their operating incomes, indicating efficient management \nof services by Cholpon\u2013Ata (the tariffs there are the highest among the three cities). Staff \nsalaries constitute 32%\u201357% of total expenditure, and electricity, 10%\u201339%. Staffing levels are \nhigh, between 4.5 and 7.0 staff members per 1,000 connections. Water losses are high due to \nleaks and commercial losses in the network.  \n \n  3.  Tazalyk Enterprises Finances \n \n15.  Tazalyk enterprises' operating incomes range from $0.14 million in Cholpon\u2013Ata and \nKarakol to $0.48 million in Balykchy. Budget transfers and income from customers constitute \n60% (Cholpon\u2013Ata) to 100% (Karakol) of operating income. Domestic waste management tariffs \n(for individual houses) range from $1.18 per cum in Karakol to $4.36 per cum in Cholpon\u2013Ata; \nnondomestic tariffs range form $1.09 per cum in Karakol to $6.98 per cum in Cholpon\u2013Ata. \nKarakol  indicates  95%  income  collection,  while  Cholpon\u2013Ata  indicates  a  35%  collection \nperformance. Given that both stated incomes remain similar, the demand in Cholpon\u2013Ata is \nvery high, and improved performance will benefit its operations. \n \n16.  Operating ratios for Balykchy and Karakol are less than unity. Balykchy has made \nsubstantial  efforts  to  improve  tariff  collection,  while  Karakol  depends  on  budget  transfers. \nCholpon\u2013Ata is in debt, and its poor tariff collection is attributed to the fiscal status. Staff and \noperation and maintenance costs constitute 60% (Cholpon\u2013Ata) to 99% (Karakol) of operating \nexpenditure. Surpluses generated are not ploughed back into capital creation. \n \n17.  Tariffs (for water, sewerage, and solid waste) are approved by city councils, based on \nsubmissions  made  by  agencies.  They  are  then  assessed  for  appropriateness  by  an \nantimonopoly committee in each city, and the city council passes a decree to implement the \ntariffs. Current tariffs in Balykchy and Cholpon\u2013Ata were approved in 2008, while Karakol's \ntariffs have not been revised since 2005. \n \nD.  Urban Sector Issues and Challenges \n \n18.  Inadequate basic services hamper the region's economic development\u2014and tourism in \nparticular. They also endanger Lake Issyk\u2013Kul and its environment. The following principles \nshould govern future development.  \n(i)  Preservation  of  Lake  Issyk\u2013Kul.  It  is  important  that  improvements  in \ninfrastructure (e.g., water and sanitation) are done concurrently.  \n(ii)  User-pays cost recovery principles. Infrastructure improvements will lead to \nsignificant increases in tourism revenues, and it is important that the cost of \nservices is recovered from these.  \n(iii)  Integrated development. Economy, infrastructure, and environment are strongly \nlinked. \n(iv)  Strong  focus  on  improving  institutional  effectiveness.  Better  financial \nmanagement, improved systems and procedures, and improved staff skills will \ndeliver efficient services. \n \n \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \n \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR  \n \nNo.  Project  Year Approved Donor  Amount  \n1.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nLake Issyk\u2013Kul (\"warm lake\" in Kyrgyz) is the world\u2019s second largest saline lake; a Ramsar site of globally \nsignificant biodiversity; and a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization  \n(UNESCO)-designated biosphere reserve. The lake forms a significant part of Issyk\u2013Kul Oblast, and contributes to \neconomic growth by providing tourism opportunities. Attracting approximately 1 million tourists annually, equivalent \nto 70% of the country\u2019s annual tourist of 1.4 million persons, the lake is a major economic driver in the region.  \n \nIncreasing tourism has resulted in the construction of many resorts that now sprawl around the lake's northern \nshores. However, existing water and sanitation infrastructure (i.e., water, sewerage, solid waste, and roads) is \ndecrepit, dysfunctional, and poorly managed, and unable to serve the high number of tourists, which exceeds the \nresident population by a factor of four. The excessive pressure placed on the existing infrastructure is partially \nresponsible for polluting the lake. \n \nThe country development strategy, 2009\u20132011a, emphasizes environmental sustainability, and its strategic \ninvestment project for the Issyk\u2013Kul region focuses on protecting Lake Issyk\u2013Kul with the Project. In February 2009, \nthe Concept of Sustainable Development of the Ecological and Economic System of Issyk\u2013Kul was passed through \na presidential decree. Based on this, the Government of Kyrgyz Republic passed a resolution in May 2009 that \nprioritizes implementation of the Project. \n \nThe Government has adopted a poverty reduction strategy (now embedded in the country development strategy, \n2009-2011) that seeks to increase opportunities to ensure that citizens have an adequate, equitable, and \ncomfortable life in Kyrgyz Republic. The overall goals of the framework imply a large leap in socioeconomic \ndevelopment through mobilization of domestic resources, effective structural reforms and quality management \n(including bringing in professional managers to foster economic development), improvement of infrastructure, \nintroduction of new technologies and information systems, and active involvement of civil initiatives. In other words, \nsustainable stabilization and dynamic development for the well being of all citizens will guide Kyrgyz Republic to \nprosperity. \n \nAsian Development Bank (ADB)-led investment and policy dialogue will improve the quality of urban services, foster \ntourist growth, and preserve the lake's environment. The assessment of institutional, legal, and municipal finance \nassessments in the oblast will provide a suitable platform for developing ADB's urban services sector development \nstrategy for Kyrgyz Republic. Development of performance-based service contracts will also improve opportunities \nfor public\u2013private partnerships in the water and sanitation sector. \n \nThe Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Water Policyb, and it will help achieve the Millennium Development Goal of \nenvironmental sustainability (goal 7) and specifically address target 10 (to halve the proportion of people without \nsustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015). \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Targeting Classification: TI-M \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe National Statistics Committee calculates an annual poverty line adjusted to inflation. In 2008, the poverty line \nwas calculated as Som963 ($22) per person per month, with the line of extreme poverty being Som640 ($15) per \nperson per month. Although the national poverty level has decreased from 49% in 2003 to 35% in 2008, poverty \nreduction is larger for rural areas. Based on 2008 data, Issyk\u2013Kul Oblast ranks fourth in terms of poverty incidence, \nwith 39%, and about 8% suffering extreme poverty. The poor account for 19% of the beneficiary population, with the \nextremely poor making up 9%. Within the project area, poverty incidence ranges from 2.6% in Cholpon\u2013Ata, to \n10.4% in Karakol, and to 31.9% in Balykchy.  \n  \nA socioeconomic survey indicated that urban residents' top priority is improved water supply and sanitation services.\n \nWater supply. About one quarter of households and 19% of poor households indicated inadequate water supply for \nhousehold needs. Waterborne illnesses were significant, with 82% of households stating incidences in the past 5 \nyears. Overall, 23% of all people suffering from waterborne illnesses were poor, and the costs of treating such \nillnesses were a significant additional burden. Poor households also lost 75 potential labor days per year due to \nwaterborne illnesses. Therefore, improved water quality is a high priority. \n \n ", "  Appendix 10  43 \nSanitation. About 75% of households use dry-pit latrines, and 24% use flush or pour toilets. The poor generally use \npit latrines, which cannot be connected to a centralized system. About 66% of households surveyed stated that they \nwould be willing to pay for connection to a sewerage system, indicating citizen priority for improved sanitation. \n  \nSolid waste management. About 84% of households stated that a municipal collection service was unavailable on \na daily basis. Waste disposal practices included plastic bottle and packaging collection by tazalyk enterprises from \n50% of households, waste incineration by 36% of households, and waste disposal to the nearest landfill or waste \nreceptacle by 8% of households. All poor households stated that they sold household waste for recycling. Increased \ncollection frequency was a stated requirement. \n \nThe social analysis concluded that the poor mostly live in areas without running water supplies, sewage and solid \nwaste collection, and treatment services. They often suffer from serious water supply shortages, poor water quality, \nsewage pollution, and poor urban environmental sanitation.  \n \n2.  Design Features \nThe Project incorporates several strategies to facilitate the ability of households and communities to realize benefits \nfrom water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management improvements and maintenance, thus contributing to \npoverty reduction in the project area, including (i) priorities for employment of local men and women for both \nphysical works and routine maintenance, particularly for poor households; (ii) contractor specifications for provision \nof HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infection awareness and prevention programs for construction crews (physical \nworks) and surrounding communities; (iii) an information, education, and communication campaign to ensure public \nconsultation and a participation program linked to different aspects of project preparation and implementation \n(including participation in monitoring) to be undertaken by the Executing Agency and to continue the consultation \ncommenced during the project preparatory technical assistancec; (iv) a gender action plan focusing on a training \nprogram to deliver increased awareness and knowledge on water drinking safety, water source protection, \ntreatment, water and environmental sanitation and diseases, toilet renovation, health education and promotion; and \n(v) community upgrading initiatives such as improvements in school water supply and sanitation; improvements to \npit latrines used by the poor through community septic tanks; and provision of public toilets in markets, hospitals, \nclinics, and other public institutions. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nThe population of the project area (i.e., the three urban centers of Balykchy, Cholpon\u2013Ata, and Karakol) is about \n121,500 and is expected to increase to 128,750 by 2015. The household survey indicates that two thirds of \nhouseholds are Kyrgyz, 18% are Russian, 4% are Tajik, and 12% belong to other ethnic groups. Cholpon\u2013Ata \ncomprises the largest proportion of Kyrgyz, with 89%. Overall, some 41% of households are headed by women.  \n \nThe primary beneficiaries of the Project are the residents of the three cities and tourists. Some households will \nexperience improvement in water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management, including (i) households that are \nimpacted when members fall sick due to waterborne illnesses resulting from insufficient or poor-quality water; (ii) \nthose that use markets, hospitals, clinics, and other public institutions that will be provided with improved facilities \n(i.e., public toilets); (iii) schoolchildren and teachers to be provided with improved water supply and sanitation \nfacilities; (iv) poor households using pit latrines that will be improved through provision of community septic tanks; \n(v) general and more widespread benefits from the sanitary landfill and improvements to solid waste management \npractices; and (vi) households, hotels, guesthouses, and institutions connected to the rehabilitated sewerage \nsystem. \n \nHealth benefits. The Project will reduce morbidity and mortality rates from waterborne, vector-borne, and airborne \ndiseases and contribute to savings in associated medical costs and loss of healthy working days. The Project will (i) \nprevent an increase in the incidence of waterborne illnesses arising form contaminated or insufficient water; (ii) \nprevent an associated increase in medical expenses; and (iii) prevent an associated increase in time lost from work, \nthereby leading to loss of income. \n \nEmployment benefits. The Project will create direct short-term employment during the construction phase and \nlong-term employment opportunities during the operation phase (maintenance). A target of 30% short-term \nemployment opportunities will be filled by the poor and women during the construction phase. Since unemployment \nand redundancies within the informal sector (those most likely to be employed on the Project) are the major causes \nof poverty in the project area, the poor will benefit disproportionately from this job creation.  \nTourism sector benefits. A small tourism survey of operators and tourists included in the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance was conducted, covering 30 tourists (10 in each city) and 31 tourism service operators (hotels, \ninns, and guest houses). Inadequate water supply and poor sanitation in hotels and guesthouses, and inadequate \nsolid waste collection services (and unclean public places), were indicated as negatively impacting tourism. About \n33% of tourists indicated that water supply and sanitation were poorly managed, but 55% indicated that solid waste \nwas efficiently collected and transported. Clearly, improvements to basic services will have benefits for the tourism \nexperience. \n ", "44  Appendix 10 \nOther economic benefits. In addition, improved health and quality of life will increase the capability of people and \nwill promote local economic development. The improved water quality and urban environment will promote \nsustainable economic development and accelerate tourism development where the poor and women are particularly \nlikely to find opportunities, as they make up a large proportion of small-service operators and vendors. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nA socioeconomic survey covered 514 respondents who were randomly sampled in the three cities. Stakeholder \nconsultation workshops, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews on urban services, tourism \ndevelopment, and environmental management formed an integral part of the consultation process. Environmental \nimpact assessment and resettlement due diligence report preparation also involved rounds of public consultation. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and \nmonitoring?  \n \n   Information sharing           Consultation         Collaborative decision making        Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nThe Project includes an information, education, and communication campaign comprising (i) a public environment \nand hygiene awareness program at the community level; and (ii) an HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infection \nawareness and prevention program aimed at the construction workforce. The campaign will be implemented in \nparallel with existing environment and health programs. Consultations with communities will be held during detailed \nengineering designs and implementation of components. Special attention will be paid to the participation of women \nand any other vulnerable group, such as the poor. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues \nAlthough Kyrgyz Republic avoided some of the more drastic collapses in social and economic indicators \nexperienced by countries in transition, effects have nevertheless been felt by its population, particularly women. \nSignificant and growing gender disparities in political leadership, employment opportunities, and wage rates have \nincreased rates of women\u2019s income poverty. \n \nHouseholds headed by women account for 41% of beneficiary households and are smaller than households headed \nby men; single-person households are more often headed by women. Some 87% of households headed by women \nand 91% of households headed by men receive regular cash income. Higher proportions of households headed by \nwomen (20%) live in poverty than households headed by men (18%). The total number of sick days due to \nwaterborne illnesses is higher for women (151) than for men (73). Women and girls at reproductive age are \nprimarily responsible for collection of household water, household garbage disposal, and care for the sick and \nelderly. These tasks negatively impact health and cause conflict and stress in communities during rush hours and \nlimited water supply schedules. Despite an active role in the sector, women lack decision-making powers, and their \nrepresentation in management is low at 10%. \n \nThe poverty and social assessment indicated that women strongly support the Project across all components. \nWomen perceive that the Project will improve their living environments, create employment opportunities, and \nreduce the incidence of waterborne illnesses and associated costs. Implementation of the gender action plan will \nenhance the benefits to women through a training and awareness-raising program focusing on drinking water \nsafety, water source protection and treatment, water and environmental sanitation and diseases, toilet renovation, \nand health education and promotion. \n \n2.  Key Actions \nMeasures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n   Gender plan       Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \nGender has been mainstreamed into the design of the Project, including a range of gender-sensitive measures, \nrequirements for consultation, and monitoring indicators. The Implementing Agency will work with contractors and \ncommunities to facilitate the participation of women in paid work opportunities for physical works and to ensure that \nall Kyrgyz labor laws are respected (e.g., equal pay for equal work and no use of child or trafficked labor). HIV/AIDS \nand sexually transmitted infection awareness and prevention programs will target women as well as men, including \nprograms instituted by contractors to reach the construction crew. Project assurances will prioritize women for \nemployment, including a 15% target for project employment opportunities for women and 15% for the poor during \nthe construction phase, and will be monitored by the Project. The community-based environmental and hygiene \nawareness program that is at the core of the gender action plan will directly address women\u2019s needs and health \nrisks.  \n ", "  Appendix 10  45 \nIII.

Methodology. The subprojects (the three project cities of Balykchy, Cholpo-Ata and \nKarakol)  of  the  Issyk\u2013Kul  Sustainable  Development  Project  (the  Project)  were  analyzed \nfollowing the Handbook for Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects1 and the Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects2 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The financial \nanalysis  assesses  subproject  ability  to  meet  future  costs,  including  capital  expenditure, \noperation  and  maintenance  costs,  and  if  appropriate,  debt  servicing  and  depreciation  or \nreinvestment margins. \n \n2.  The  analysis  was  conducted  on  a  without-  and  with-project  basis  by  estimating \nincremental costs and revenues over 25 years. The main financial viability parameters analyzed \nwere (i) the financial internal rate of return (FIRR), which will be greater than the weighted \naverage cost of capital (WACC), with the financial net present value as proxy; (ii) operating \nratio, which will be less than or equal to unity when the Project becomes fully operational; and \n(iii) tariff affordability, normally acceptable at a maximum of 5% of average household income. \nDetails of the analysis are presented in the Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n3.  The analysis looked closely at the operating ratio as a main indicator of sustainability, \nwhere operation and maintenance, depreciation, and interest expenses are measured against \ntariff  revenues.  A  ratio  at  less  than  unity  reflects  cost  recovery,  thus  a  certain  level  of \nsustainability; at greater than unity, it shows the lack thereof, thus the need to increase tariffs or \nto obtain viability gap funding. \n \n4.  Assumptions. The key assumptions used were (i) investment cost at base June 2009 \nprices; (ii) physical contingencies at 10%; (iii) local inflation at 13% in 2009, 12% in 2010, 10% \nin 2011 and 2012, 9% in 2013 and 2014, and 7% in 2014 and onward; (iv) foreign inflation at \n2.5% annually; (v) operation and maintenance costs covering salaries, chemicals, power, repair, \nand maintenance, and bad debts allowance based on historical operations and on design \ntechnology used; (vi) asset useful life assumed at 10 years for equipment, particularly service \nconnection meters, and 50 years for civil works; and (vii) historical population growth rates. \n \n5.  The \u201cfloating population\u201d of tourists and regular transients were accounted for, and was \nestimated at between 15% and 40% on top of base populations in the three project cities. The \nperiodic population growth rates reported by the National Statistics Committee were adjusted to \nreflect the situation. \n \n6.  Revenues  were  projected  from  domestic  and  nondomestic  demand  for  water  and \nsewerage  services,  and  tariffs  programmed  to  increase  every  2  years.  As  the  basis  for \ncalculating  existing  tariffs  is  difficult  to  verify,  the  required  initial  increase  at  subproject \ncompletion by 2015 (year 5)\u2014which would be substantial\u2014was determined based on user \naffordability and targeted cost recovery levels, including (i) operation and maintenance costs \ncoverage; (ii) operation and maintenance costs plus depreciation coverage; and (iii) operation \nand maintenance costs plus depreciation and debt interest coverage. Tariffs were maintained \nwithin consumer affordability limits. \n \n7.  The analysis on water supply and sewerage was based on the design demand of about \n80 liters per capita per day (lpcd) for domestic connections increasing to 100 lpcd for Balykchy \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1999.

Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 12  49 \nand Karakol, and to 150 lpcd for Cholpon\u2013Ata when systems become fully operational by 2015. \nNondomestic demand is between 20% and 28% of the domestic. Sewage generation is at 70% \nof total water demand. \n \n8.  The demand forecast assumes all water from existing alternative sources (i.e., bottled, \ncollected from point source, and pumped) will be replaced with subproject water supply. This \nhas  featured  as  nonincremental  water  in  the  economic  analysis.  System  improvements  \nwith-project will curb nonrevenue water from the current amount of about 25% in Balykchy and \nKarakol to 20% upon project completion, and of about 60% in Cholpon\u2013Ata to 55% by 2015 \n(year 5) and further to 20% by 2020 (year 10). The improvement in water recovery will make \nbillable water available to the system, thereby contributing to the cost-recovery perspective. This \nhas featured as incremental water, as a source of benefits in the economic analysis. \n \n9.  Capital Cost Estimates. Subproject capital investment has three major components: (i) \nphysical infrastructure, consisting of civil works, materials and equipment, and taxes and duties; \n(ii) enterprise resource management; and (iii) project management and administration, including \nincremental  administration;  engineering  and  construction  supervision;  and  an  information, \neducation, and communication campaign. \n \n10.  The three subprojects require an investment of $37.50 million including contingencies. \nThe capital costs for the three subprojects are summarized in Table A12.1. \n \nTable A12.1: Subproject Capital Cost \n($ million) \nSubproject  Subproject   Subproject \nParticulars %Total  Total  Balykchy  Cholpon-Ata  Karakol \nCivil Works and Equipment 52.1        19.537            6.641                  2.854          10.042\nWater Supply 9.8          3.660            1.513                  1.127            1.020\nSewerage 25.7          9.626            2.596                      \u2014            7.030\nWSS Vehicles and Equipment 2          0.737            0.342                  0.052            0.342\nSolid Waste 11.4          4.290            1.701                  1.429            1.160\nCommunity Upgrading 3.3          1.224            0.489                  0.246            0.489\nEnterprise Resource Management 3.6          1.339            0.446                  0.446            0.446\nProject Assistance Facility 14.8          5.532            1.844                  1.844            1.844\nTotal Basic Cost 70.4        26.408            8.932                  5.144          12.332\nPhysical Contingency 4.4          1.653            0.547                  0.306            0.800\nPrice contingency 14.1          5.271            1.781                  1.012            2.478\nTotal Contingencies 18.5          6.924            2.328                  1.318            3.278\nInterest During Construction 2.7          1.000            0.344                  0.193            0.463\nTotal Financing Charges 2.7          1.000            0.344                  0.193            0.463\nTaxes and  Duties 8.5          3.169            1.072                  0.617            1.480\nTotal Landed Cost 100        37.501          12.675                  7.273          17.552  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n11.

Weighted Average Cost of Capital. The WACC was calculated in real terms and was \nused as the hurdle rate for the FIRR to measure subproject viability. Funding sources are the \nADB loan and government contribution, at about 80%\u201320% sharing. Inflation is estimated at \n2.47% for foreign cost and at an 6.80% annual average for local costs. The rates are computed \non  after-tax  basis,  resulting  in  the  WACC  in  real  terms  estimated  at  15.4%.

Operation  and  Maintenance  Costs.  Subproject  operation  and  maintenance  costs \ninclude vodokanal enterprise and tazalyk enterprise staff salaries, power and energy, chemical \ntreatment, maintenance, and miscellaneous expenses, and are based on vodokanal enterprise \nhistorical financial operations. Bad debt expense is assumed at 1% of sales. Escalation is \napplied based on local inflation. Depreciation is assumed at 2% annually (50-year items) for civil \nworks  and  6.7%\u201310.0%  (10\u201315-year  items)  for  replacement  materials  and  equipment. \nReplacement of fully depreciated assets is to be financed through internal cash. \n \n14.  Cost-Recovery Analysis. The tariff was established by dividing all cash requirements \nplus margins by the combined volume of water sold and sewage and solid waste generated. It is \nprojected that the collection rate will improve as services improve. In the analysis, an actual \ncollection rate of about 60%\u201380% for the three project cities is expected to reach 90% by 2015 \n(year 5). The analysis determined the level of tariffs required to satisfy the defined cost-recovery \noptions. Where tariffs are insufficient to attain full cost recovery, the required shortfall has been \nassessed in the form of viability gap funding. \n ", "  Appendix 12  51 \n \n15.  Current Tariffs. Current water tariffs differentiate between domestic and nondomestic \nuse. All existing tariffs are volumetric and structured to prevent waste. However, metering is \nvery limited at less than 3% in the three project cities. Where metering is available, wear and \ndisrepair  have  rendered  the  equipment  unreliable.  Under  the  Project\u2019s  capital  investment \nprogram, full metering is recommended. House and apartment connections for water supply are \npresently  charged  on  average  $0.08  per  cubic  meter  in  the  three  cities.  Nondomestic \nconnections are charged about five times that at $0.43 per cubic meter. For sewerage services, \ndomestic charges average $0.06 per cubic meter; nondomestic, $0.36. Existing domestic tariffs \nfor solid waste services average $2.20 per cubic meter, with nondomestic service users charged \n2.3 times more, averaging $5.01. \n \n16.  Tariff Basis and Forecast. In financial projections, where costs are given in nominal \nterms, the tariffs are projected to increase biennially to cope with cost inflation. In the FIRR cash \nflows, the tariffs are taken in real terms. The projected increases will start after construction to \nallow time for service users to assimilate to the proposed tariff reforms that will include full \nmetering for water consumption. For solid waste services, full costs of waste collection and \ndisposal will remain the basis for cost-recovery tariffs; however, a higher tariff collection rate will \nbe targeted and form part of financial management reforms. It is proposed to include tariff \nrestructuring as part of financial reforms to re-examine existing norms and their bases to ensure \nmore realistic design approaches for future projects in the water supply and sanitation sector. \n \n17.  Affordability Analysis. An affordability analysis was undertaken to check the level of \nwater expenditure against average household income. Table A12.4 presents the affordability \nlevels in each subproject for year 1 (2011), year 5 (2015), and year 10 (2020). The number of \npersons at an average of 5.0 per household and the unit consumption at 90 lpcd in 2009 are \nbased on field surveys and actual operational reports. Average household incomes are based \non social surveys conducted in the subproject cities during project preparation and adjusted to \nprice inflation. \n \nTable A12.4: Tariff Affordability \n Subproject Balykchy  Subproject Cholpon-Ata   Subproject Karakol \nParticulars Year 1 Year 5 Year 10 Year 1Year 5 Year 10 Year 1 Year 5Year 10\nA.

From the analysis, tariff increases for the three subprojects required to satisfy viability \nparameters are within consumer affordability. However, viability gap funding will need to be \nconsidered  during  the  initial  years  of  operation  to  recover  costs  fully,  including  asset \nreplacements. Table A12.4 indicates that the proposed monthly charge for the three cities is far \nlower than the generally accepted limit of 5% of household income. Politically, exponential \nincreases are unacceptable, and it is proposed that viability gap funding will provide the initial \nbuffer to meet required operating ratios before financial reforms and progressive tariff increases \nreduce dependence on such funding. \n \n19.  A  break-even  analysis  was  undertaken  for  all  subprojects.  To  cover  operation  and \nmaintenance costs, tariffs are set to increase biennially at rates given in Table A12.5. Also \nindicated  is  the  cumulative  viability  gap  funding  required  under  each  scenario  to  ensure \noperations are sustainable within acceptable tariff increases. The accumulative viability gap \nfunding  is  determined  over  2010\u20132015  and  2016\u20132029  before  the  Government  of  Kyrgyz \nRepublic plans an exit strategy from viability gap funding support. Project support through the \nenterprise resource management component should support financial management reforms to \nimprove vodokanal enterprises and cities' ability to meet operation and maintenance costs. \n \nTable A12.5: Cost Recovery Tariffs and Required Viability Gap Fund \nBalykchy Cholpon-Ata Karakol\n Tariff  Tariff   Tariff \n Level   Cost Recovery  Increase    VGF Needs   Increase     VGF Needs   Increase    VGF Needs  \nWSS (2010\u20132015)\nI O&M Cost 20% 0.446 20% 0.691 20% 2.675\nII O&M + Depreciation 20% 0.956 20% 0.935 20% 3.727\nIII O&M cost + Deprn + Debt 20% 0.956 20% 1.001 20% 3.979\nWSS (2016\u20132029)\nI O&M cost 67% 0.000 54% 0.059 93% 4.026\nII O&M + Depreciation 63% 0.032 49% 0.143 87% 5.499\nIII O&M cost + Deprn + Debt 60% 0.091 49% 0.182 89% 6.058\nSWM (2010\u20132015)\nI O&M cost 20% 0.683 20% 0.956 20% 1.051\nII O&M + Depreciation 20% 0.952 20% 0.956 20% 1.051\nIII O&M cost + Deprn + Debt 20% 0.952 20% 1.021 20% 1.110\nSWM (2016\u20132029)\nI O&M cost 110% 1.309 103% 1.392 131% 1.141\nII O&M + Depreciation 111% 1.685 103% 1.958 129% 1.671\nIII O&M cost + Deprn + Debt 106% 2.503 97% 1.907 129% 2.749\ndeprn = depreciation, incr = increase, O&M = operation and maintenance, VGF = viability gap fund.\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n20.  For example, to break even in water, sewerage, and solid waste services in Balykchy, by \ncovering only operation and maintenance costs, the Government would provide $1.13 million in \nviability gap funding for the period 2010\u20132015 and $1.31 million in viability gap funding for the \nperiod 2016\u20132029. This would be in addition to the average biennialtariff increase of 20% for the \nperiod 2010\u20132015 and 67%\u2013110% for the period 2016\u20132029.  \n \n21.  Financial Viability Approach. The subproject is considered viable if the resulting FIRR \nis greater than the WACC, and cost recovery tariffs within consumer affordability. Additionally, \nthe operating ratio will need to be maintained lower than unity throughout the Project\u2019s life to \nensure sustainability. Initial spreadsheet iterations reveal that without proposed improvements, \nsubproject operations will not be sustainable as operation and maintenance expenses exceed \ntariff  revenues.  To  satisfy  all  viability  and  sustainability  parameters,  tariffs  will  need  to  be \n ", "  Appendix 12  53 \nprogressively increased, especially during the initial years after project completion.

Conclusion. Subproject vodokanal enterprises and tazalyk enterprises are financially \nviable when (i) tariff increases are required at least every 2 years and should be based on cost \nrecovery and consumer affordability principles, and (ii) the Government should make available \nviability gap funding to ensure service sustainability. These conditions have been incorporated \nin the financial improvement action plan. These reform plans and related issues have been \ndiscussed  and  agreed  with  the  Executing  Agency  with  the  aim  of  achieving  financial \nsustainability of the overall investment. Income affordability is a major factor in rationalizing \ntariffs; thus, the household income base needs to be reviewed periodically. The sensitivity \nanalysis indicates that subcomponent FIRRs are stressed under various conditions, implying a \nneed for efficient project implementation to rapidly achieve physical and financial targets. \n ", "54  Appendix 13 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n1.  Methodology.  The  economic  analysis  for  the  Issyk\u2013Kul  Sustainable  Development \nProject (the Project) followed Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines, including Guidelines \nfor the Economic Analysis of Projects1 and Handbook for the Economic Analysis of Water \nSupply Projects.2 The analysis describes the economic rationale and target beneficiaries, and \nundertakes a viability analysis of the three subprojects (the three project cities of Balykchy, \nCholpo-Ata and Karakol). A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the effects of \ncertain adverse conditions on system capital investment and operation and maintenance costs, \nrevenue  generation,  and  overall  subproject  viability.  The  analysis  used  the  domestic  price \nnumeraire, as benefits are nontradable in nature. The analysis was undertaken at a constant \nmid-2009 price level and assesses project effects over 25 years (2011\u20132035). \n \n2.  Economic Rationale and Goals. The project economic rationale was based on the \nfollowing. \n(i)  Improving  urban  services  and  Lake  Issyk\u2013Kul's  environment.  Urban \nservices in the three project cities have deteriorated since the collapse of the \nSoviet Union. Lack of capital investments for infrastructure improvement and \ninsufficient revenues to meet operating expenditures have affected the quality of \nthe services. Consequently, due to poor access to sanitation and solid waste \ntreatment  and  disposal,  surface  water  runoff  and  contaminated  groundwater \nhave impacted the lake's environment. Project interventions will help improve the \nquality of infrastructure and terminate any future contamination of the lake. \n(ii)  Fostering  tourism  growth. Improving the lake's environment and quality of \nservices in the three project cities will foster tourism growth. Tourists visiting Lake \nIssyk\u2013Kul account for 70% of the country's tourists, or about 1 million visiting the \nregion each June to August (translated as four times the resident population in \nproject cities). Dilapidated urban infrastructure is under excess pressure during \nthe peak tourist season, and tourist perception and continued patronization of the \nregion  are  contingent  on  efficient  urban  services.  Improvements  through  the \nProject will ensure growth in tourist numbers, increased gross regional product, \nand accrued benefits to the oblast and country. \n(iii)  Improving  local  government  and  service  utility  performance. To sustain \nefficient services, the Project will improve the institutional effectiveness of local \ngovernments  and  service  utilities  (i.e.,  vodokanal  enterprises  and  tazalyk \nenterprises).  Through  the  enterprise  resource  management  component,  the \nProject  will  (a)  improve  financial management  practices in  the  project  cities, \nvodokanal  enterprises,  and  tazalyk  enterprises,  and  create  a  culture  of \ngenerating revenue surpluses to reinvest into capital assets or to leverage for \ndebt; (b) create a database of water and sewerage assets and conditions to help \nvodokanal  enterprises  identify  infrastructure  improvements  in  the  long  term \nbased on a well-developed asset management and maintenance system; and (c) \nbuild vodokanal enterprises staff capacity to manage services through a twinning \nprogram. \n(iv)  Enabling public\u2013private partnerships. Current arrangements between cities \nand  service  utilities3 are  loosely  based  on  service  agreements  that  require \nimprovement in performance standards. The Project will improve service quality \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n2  ADB. 1999.

Selection  Approach. The subprojects were selected based on (i) consistency with \ndemand,  based  on  community  willingness  to  participate  and  contribute;  (ii)  the  least-cost \napproach of meeting effective demand in terms of location, scale, scope, and appropriate \ntechnology, based on prudent engineering decisions; and (iii) that economic benefits are likely \nto exceed economic costs. The three project cities were prioritized due to the growing tourism \nindustry  that  can  easily  be  threatened  with  water-  and  sanitation-related  health  and \nenvironmental problems, which project interventions will help mitigate.  \n \n4.  Project  Alternatives.  The  Project  will  (i)  improve  urban  infrastructure,  including \nsewerage and sanitation, solid waste management, water supply, and community upgrading, \nand (ii) improve service delivery through better enterprise resource management. Component \nchoice was based on the following decisions. \n(i)  Replacing sewer lines and rehabilitating pumping stations. The Project will \nreplace aging sewer networks, replace sewage pumps, and rehabilitate pumping \nstations (over 25 years old). This option is the least-cost, as continuing to use the \nexisting  system  will  result  in  (a)  groundwater  contamination  through  sewage \ninfiltration  from  system  leaks,  and  (b)  high  electricity  charges  due  to  poorly \nfunctioning sewage pumps.  \n(ii)  Expanding the sewer network and providing onsite sanitation systems. The \nProject  will  expand  the  sewer  network  in  Karakol  to  increase  access  to \napproximately 30,000 persons. It will also ensure access to onsite sanitation \n(septic  tanks)  facilities  to  25,000  persons.  Sewer  network  expansion  covers \nareas  that  are  densely  populated  and  have  sufficient  population  density  to \ngenerate sewage flushing velocity. Onsite sanitation facilities target areas that \nare sparsely populated with insufficient sewage flushing velocities. Not providing \nfocused options would increase the incidence of waterborne diseases. \n(iii)  Constructing sanitary landfills and closing existing dumps. The Project will \nensure  that  indiscriminate  waste  dumping  is  discontinued,  and  new  sanitary \nlandfills are constructed. Alternative options of treating waste are to compost it or \nto adopt waste-to-energy technologies. Sanitary landfills are the preferred option \nas  the  organic  portion  of  waste  generated  is  approximately  10%,  making \ncomposting unviable, and 70% of the waste is inert material, making waste-to-\nenergy processing unviable. The sanitary landfills are located at existing dumps \non state-owned land, thereby negating any land acquisition costs. \n(iv)  Providing  vehicles,  tools,  and  equipment.  Poor  system  operation  and \nmaintenance will be overcome through adequate supply of appropriate vehicles, \ntools, and equipment. Without provision, new systems constructed will enter into \na state of disrepair within a short period.  \n(v)  Piloting district water metering, replacing water transmission mains, and \nrehabilitating water boreholes. The Project will (i) install water meters in pilot \nzones in three cities, monitor water supply, and identify system leaks to develop \na leak rectification program; (ii) replace a 2-kilometer water transmission main to \nconserve water; and (iii) rehabilitate water boreholes by providing disinfection \nmeasures to improve water quality. The identified options will ensure savings in \noperational expenditure resulting from water losses, resource savings in terms of \nconserving treated water transmission, and improved health conditions through \ndisinfection of groundwater supplies. \n ", "56  Appendix 13 \n(vi)  Enterprise resource management. The subcomponents identified are based on \nmeeting the Project's economic rationale on improving local government and \nservice utility performance. \n \n5.  Service Delivery and Socioeconomic Analysis. City-level data provided by vodokanal \nenterprises  and  tazalyk  enterprises  (presented  in  Appendix  2)  were  verified  through  a \nsocioeconomic survey and focus group discussions. The survey covered 514 respondents4 \nrandomly sampled in the three project cities. Results are indicated in the Summary Poverty \nReduction and Social Strategy, Appendix 11. \n(i)  Sanitation. About 75% households use dry-pit latrines, and 24% use flush or \npour toilets. Predominantly, apartment blocks in all cities are connected to the \nsewerage system. \n(a)  About 31% households in the highest-income quintile, compared with \n22% of households in the lowest-income quintile, have access to a flush \nor  pour  toilet.  The  poor  generally  use  pit  latrines,  which  cannot  be \nconnected to the centralized system.   \n(b)  About 66% of households surveyed (57% of the households in the lowest-\nincome quintile compared with 60% of households in the highest-income \nquintile)  stated  that  they  would  be  willing  to  pay  for  a  sewerage \nconnection, indicating citizen priority for improved sanitation.  \n(ii)  Solid waste management. Approximately 84% of households (and 86% in the \nlowest-income quintile) stated that a municipal collection service was unavailable \non a daily basis. Increased collection frequency was a stated requirement. The \nperception was corroborated through assessment of city-level data.  \n(a)  Waste disposal practices included plastic bottle and packaging collection \nby the tazalyk enterprises from 50% of households, waste incineration by \n36% of households, and waste disposal into the nearest landfill or waste \nreceptacle by 8% of households. All poor households stated that they \nsold household waste for recycling.  \n(b)  About  83%  of  households  indicated  that  household  waste  earned  an \naverage  of  Som43  ($1)  per  month.  Waste  sold  by  poor  households \nearned them an average of Som27 ($0.62) per month, equivalent to 10% \nof the amount earned through waste sold by non-poor households. \n(iii)  Water supply. Existing water systems in the three project cities have undergone \nimprovement due to recent investments to increase coverage to about 80% of \nthe population. However, low-quality supplies still impact served and unserved \npopulations.  \n(a)  The  survey  indicated  that  25%  of  households  and  19%  of  poor \nhouseholds had an inadequate water supply for household needs.  \n(b)  Improved water quality was a high priority, and only 39% of households \n(44% of households in the lowest-income quintile and 40% of households \nin the highest-income quintile) stated that they would drink the water \nwithout some form of treatment. Households in the lowest-income quintile \non average pay nearly three times more (Som90 or $2 per month) than \nhouseholds in the highest income quintile (Som35 or $0.8 per month) for \nwater treatment. \n(c)  Waterborne illnesses were significant, with 82% of households (17% in \nthe  lowest-income  quintile  and  22%  in  the  second-to-lowest-income \nquintile) stating incidences in the past 5 years. Overall, 23% of all people \nsuffering from these illnesses were poor, and they lost 75 potential labor \n                                                 \n4  175 households in Balykchy, 55 households in Cholpon\u2013Ata, and 284 households in Karakol. \n ", "  Appendix 13  57 \ndays  per  year  due  to  waterborne  illnesses.  The  average  annual \nexpenditure on treating waterborne illnesses was Som1,472 ($34), with \n29% households spending Som251 ($6)\u2013Som700 ($16)per year and 26% \nof households spending Som701($16)\u2013Som2,500 ($58) per year.  \n \n6.  Subproject Beneficiaries and Projected Demand. Demand assumptions include the \nfollowing. \n(i)  Sewerage  and  sanitation.  Project  beneficiaries  will  include  households \npresently connected to the existing sewerage systems that will gain from system \nrehabilitation, and households getting new connections through proposed sewer \nlines.  Both  types  of  households  will  benefit  from  improved  environmental \nsanitation  conditions  that  a  properly  functioning  sewerage  system  provides. \nSystem coverage will increase to benefit about 50% of the population from the \ncurrent 35%. \n(ii)  Solid  waste  management.  Project  beneficiaries  will  comprise  households \nacross  the  three  project  cities  that  will  gain  from  improved  environmental \nsanitation, living conditions, and amenities that a properly functioning solid waste \ncollection  and  disposal  system  will  provide.  Those  households  that  currently \nspend time disposing of their solid waste will receive additional benefits from \nreceiving  primary  waste  collection.  About  80%  of  project  households  will  be \ncovered by the improved waste management system. \n(iii)  Water supply. Prior to and without the Project, households in the three project \ncities  rely  on  alternative  water  collected  from  point  source,  bottled  water, \ngroundwater  pumped  from  household  boreholes,  and  standpipes.  With  the \nProject,  piped  water  will  replace  alternative  supplies.  Connected  households \nconsume 80\u2013100 liters per capita per day (lpcd), and unconnected households \nconsume 35\u2013l0 lpcd. With the Project, the demand will rise to 100\u2013150 lpcd. The \nsupply situation is projected to rise with the population growth rate and increase \nannually to reach a design target population of 90% on project completion.  \n \n7.  Economic Benefits of Sewerage. The economic benefits for sewerage include (i) cost \nsavings for residential and nonresidential sewage generators, which are no longer required to \noperate onsite disposal systems; and (ii) health benefits through avoided household medical \ncosts5 and avoided income loss by wage-earners absent from work due to waterborne illnesses. \nThe former was not considered directly as new customers currently use pit latrines that do not \nentail any operation and maintenance costs. Health benefits were calculated using morbidity \nrates obtained from the Ministry of Health and the National Statistics Committee, and from \ninterviews with city epidemiological centers. Data from the National Statistics Committee on \nincidences of illnesses for population were also used. \n \n8.  Economic Benefits of Solid Waste Management. Valuation of economic benefits for \nsolid waste management was based on economic value of savings in waste disposal time and \nhealth benefits.6 The former was derived from socioeconomic surveys, and the latter was not \nconsidered for the current analysis due to inability to derive health benefits from available data.\n                                                 \n5  Medical treatment expense averages Som1,500 ($35) per year. \n6  Includes (i) avoided medical costs to treat diseases mostly from rat infestations, and (ii) avoided costs due to \nabsences from work. \n ", "58  Appendix 13 \n \n9.  Economic Benefits of Water Supply. Valuation of economic benefits comprises the \nfollowing.  \n(i)  Expanding supply of existing water. In supplying the existing volume of piped \nwater more efficiently, measured in terms of the average cost of supply in with- \nand  without-  project  scenarios,  the  following  two  major  components  are \nconsidered.  \n(a)  Nonincremental water supply. This component considers the increase \nin water sold from the public system due to the Project but resulting in no \neffect on total water consumption because (1) the nonincremental water \nsupply replaces water purchased and consumed from alternative sources \n(bottled water sources in case of the Project), and (2) the nonincremental \nwater supply due to reduction in nontechnical loss thanks to the Project. \nOnly nonincremental benefits from a consumer shift from bottled water \nwere  considered.1 There  are  no  benefits  assumed  from  nontechnical \nlosses, such as pilferage, meter tampering, and illegal connections, as \nthese occurrences are atypical in the three project cities. The benefit is \nevaluated by using the supply cost of replaced water sources. \n(b)  Incremental water supply. This component has a positive effect on the \ntotal consumption due to the Project. Incremental water in the analysis \ncomprises  water  arising  from  (1)  additional  system  demand  from  the \n(previously)  nonconnected  population,  and  (2)  additional  supply  from \nsystem improvements geared to recover nonrevenue water or system \nloss. The latter will induce higher demand from the existing and newly \nconnected population given the lower price of project water relative to \nalternative supplies. This component of benefit is evaluated by using the \nsupply  price  to  be  decided  by  the  city  periodically  and  based  on \naffordability. \n(ii)  Health benefits. Health benefits from improved water quality and supply are \nconsidered  under  the  health  benefits  for  sewerage,  as  it  is  assumed  that \nimprovements in both systems will reduce waterborne illnesses. \n(iii)  Resource cost savings. Other benefits include resource cost savings arising \nfrom (a) overcoming time lost in collecting water from alternative sources, (b) \novercoming storage or container acquisition and maintenance costs, and (c) \nreducing water treatment costs (e.g., boiling or filtering). \n \n10.  Economic  Costs.  The  economic  capital  investment  and  annual  operation  and \nmaintenance costs were based on financial cost estimates detailed in Appendix 12.  \n(i)  Taxes and duties are excluded from the financial costs as they represent transfer \npayments. Price inflation and market distortions are also excluded.  \n(ii)  The subproject capital and operation and maintenance costs are distributed into \ntraded  and  nontraded  components  and  labor.  For  traded  and  nontraded \ncomponents,  the  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  is  assumed  at  1  based  on \nprevious and ongoing projects by ADB and World Bank in Kyrgyz Republic.  \n(iii)  Unskilled labor is available in urban centers, which means the opportunity cost is \nlower than the wage rate. The shadow wage rate is assumed at 0.7 for unskilled \nlabor,  following  estimates  made  for  agricultural  and  highway  projects  in  the \nregion.  \n                                                 \n1  The volume of bottled water use relative to total water consumption in households is small, but expenditure-wise, \nthe cost to the household is high. In the three project cities, a liter of bottled water is about $0.40\u2013$0.50. In \ncomparison, a cubic meter of system water ranges between $0.03\u2013$0.11. Bottled water cost through the system is \nderived using existing tariffs. \n ", "  Appendix 13  59 \n(iv)  The economic costs are given in real terms and phased over the project life of 25 \nyears.  For  annual  economic  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  labor  was \nassumed at 30% unskilled and the remaining as skilled. Unskilled labor is subject \nto the shadow wage rate at 0.7. For skilled labor and the other cost components, \nthe shadow exchange rate factor at 1.0 is applied.  \n \n11.  Benefit\u2013Cost Assessment. The economic benefit\u2013cost ratio was used in the analysis \nto assess whether project benefits outweigh costs, thus making the subproject economically \nfeasible. The annual cost streams were set against the annual benefit streams and discounted \nusing the economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCC) at 12% as the hurdle rate. The resulting \npresent value of benefits was divided by the present value of costs, and if the resulting ratio is \ngreater than or equal to 1.0, the subproject is deemed acceptable. Table A13.1 summarizes the \nresults for the three subprojects, and indicates that the benefit\u2013cost ratio averages 1.42 for the \nwater supply and sewerage components, and 1.21 for solid waste.  \n \nTable A13.1: Benefit-Cost Analysis \n($ million) \n \n Subproject \n Subproject  Cholpon-  Subproject \nParticulars Average Balykchy  Ata  Karakol \nWater Supply and Sewerage\nPresent value of benefits\nNon-incremental        6.49             5 .43             3.28           10.76\nAlternative source (bottled water, etc.)a        6.49             5 .43             3.28           10.76\nNon-technical water lossb 0 0 0 0\nIncrementalc        2.64             3 .28             1.49             3.15\nAdditional demand from previously non-connected population        0.33             0 .45             0.23             0.30\nAdditional supply from recovered NRW        2.31             2 .82             1.26             2.85\nHealth         0.23             0 .14             0.05             0.49\nAvoided lost wages due to illnessd        0.11             0 .07             0.02             0.24\nAvoided cost of medical treatmente        0.12             0 .07             0.03             0.25\nResource savings        1.73             1 .93             0.50             2.78\nTime saved from collecting waterf        0.66             0 .61             0.20             1.15\nCost saved from purchase of storage reservoirg        0.56             0 .69             0.15             0.86\nCost saved from water treatment and storage maintenanceh        0.51             0 .62             0.14             0.78\nTotal benefits      11.09           1 0.77             5.32           17.18\nPresent value of costs\nCapital investment + replacements        4.10             4 .02             1.82             6.48\nO&M        3.82             3 .44             1.79             6.23\nTotal costs        7.92             7 .46             3.61           12.70\nBenefit-cost ratio           1.42              1.44             1.47             1.35\na Population using bottled water x SP.

Conclusion. Selected subprojects are economically viable with EIRR values exceeding \nthe EOCC at base case, with an average of 27.8% for water supply and sewerage and 19.5% \nfor solid waste. The sensitivity analysis for the three subprojects demonstrates that the results \nare acceptable even when tested under stress conditions. The resulting average economic \nbenefit\u2013cost ratio for water supply and sanitation is 1.42. For solid waste management, it is \n1.21. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090909130535+08'00'", "Subject": "Reports and Recommendations of the President", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Keywords": "rrp: kgz 41548, issyk-kul development project, kyrgyz environmental development projects, issyk-kul sustainable development project, adb loan 7228, adb project 41548", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20091001120643+08'00'", "Title": "Issyk\u2013Kul Sustainable Development Project "}}
