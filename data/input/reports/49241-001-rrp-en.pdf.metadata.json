In  2015,  MEIL  ventured  into  solar  power  development,  and  has  won  bids  to \ncollectively  install  377  MW  of  solar  photovoltaic  capacity.  MEIL  aims  to  achieve  sustainable \ncompetitiveness  and  de-risking  through  (i)  grid  parity  tariffs,  (ii)  non-reliance  on  subsidies, \n(iii) scalability  to  achieve  utility-scale  operations,  and  (iv)  diversification  by  geography, \nequipment supplier, and technology. \n \n3. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting the development of renewable \nenergy in India since 2007, when it financed the first set of wind projects under the IPP model \nby Tata Power and China Light and Power. ADB has financed solar IPPs by  assisting projects \nunder  the  National  Solar  Mission1  and  various  state  policies.  In  addition,  ADB  has  invested \nequity  in  renewable  energy  companies  (e.g.,  ReNew  Power  Limited,  Welspun  Renewables \nEnergy  Limited,  and  NSL  Renewable  Power  Private  Limited).  As  part  of  its  commitment \nannounced  by  ADB  in  September  20152  to scale  up  clean  energy  financing,  ADB  will  seek  to \nsustain  its  private  sector  activities,  particularly  in  major  renewable  energy  markets  such  as \nIndia.  ADB\u2019s  initiative  will  actively  support  the  Government  of  India\u2019s  intended  nationally \ndetermined  contributions  submitted  to  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate \nChange.  A  key  factor  of  the  intended  nationally  determined  contributions  is  renewable  energy \ncapacity addition of 175 gigawatts (GW) by 2022. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n \n4. \nADB  is  proposing  a  direct  loan  facility  of  up  to  $175  million  to  a  portfolio  of  special \npurpose  vehicles  (SPVs  or  \u201cBorrowers\u201d  or  \u201cborrowers\u201d)  owned  by  MEIL.  ADB\u2019s  facility  will  be \nstructured as a separate loan to each SPV on a project finance (limited recourse) basis. ADB\u2019s \nfacility is being proposed for a tenor of up to 17 years for four SPVs, and 18 years for two SPVs. \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n1  Government  of  India.

It  is \nincorporated in Guernsey and was listed on the AIM, the London Stock Exchange\u2019s international \nmarket  for  emerging  companies,  in  2010.  MEL  set  up  MEIL  to  be  its  India  holding  company. \nMEIL  now  has  10  operating  sites  (7  turnkey  and  3  self-developed)  spread  over  six  states.  It \nstarted with turnkey projects as it built itself up by investing in its own wind resource assessment \n(WRA) and project execution teams. It attained the capability of identifying potential wind sites \nsupported by in-house WRA, going through the approval and permitting process, acquiring land, \nand executing the projects. It now has a self-developed pipeline of over 6,000 MW, backed by \nwind data collected through 195 wind masts installed across 11 states. MEIL is the sponsor for \nthe six borrowers. The company\u2019s medium-term business plan is to achieve a renewable energy \ncapacity of 2 GW (1.7 GW from wind and 300 MW from solar) by the end of FY2017.  \n \n6. \nMytrah  Group  was  founded  by  Ravi  Kailas,  who  has  25  years  of  entrepreneurial \nexperience in telecommunications, software, real estate, and infrastructure. Before MEL\u2019s initial \npublic  offering,  Kailas  collaborated  with  British  steel  conglomerate  Caparo  Group,  giving \nchairman  and founder  Lord  Swaraj  Paul  and  his  son  Angad  MEL  minority  shares  in  exchange \nfor  using  the  Caparo  brand  under  a  licensing  agreement.  The  company  was  called  Caparo \nEnergy  Limited.  After  the  initial  public  offering,  the  name  was  changed  to  Mytrah  Energy \nLimited.  At  present,  the  Raksha  Trust3  has  57.9%  ownership  of  MEL,  followed  by  Esrano \nOverseas Ltd, an investment trust belonging to Angad Paul\u2019s family, (14.7%); Capital Research \nGlobal Investments (7.4%); Henderson Global Investors (5.5%); and Moab Capital Partners LLC \n(3.8%).  MEL\u2019s  market  capitalization  as  of  22  January  2016  is  approximately  $105  million. \nMEIL\u2019s  annual  revenue  increased  from  $46.7  million  in  FY2014  to  $66.9  million  in  FY2015. \nSimilarly,  MEIL\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) was \n$59.7  million  (EBITDA  margin  of  89%)  in  FY2015,  up  from  $40.6  million  (EBITDA  margin  of \n87%) reported in FY2014. \n \n\n                                                \n3  Jersey-based discretionary trust settled by Ravi Kailas, the chairman and chief executive officer of MEL. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nMEL,  through  its  Mauritius-based  subsidiary  Bindu  Vayu  (Mauritius)  Ltd.,  holds  a \n7. \nmajority in MEIL. MEIL has raised external funds in the form of nondilutive mezzanine finance, \nincluding  convertible  preference  shares subscribed  by  the  India  Infrastructure  Fund  (managed \nby  IDFC  Alternatives,  a  leading  infrastructure-focused  financial  institution  in  India)  in  2011. \nAnother  fundraising  round  involved  a  nonconvertible  debenture  of  $130  million  subscribed  by \nAION Capital Partners (an Apollo-managed fund), Goldman Sachs, and Merrill Lynch in 2015. \n \nB. \n \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n \n8. \nThe project's impact will be the diversification of India\u2019s energy mix through the addition \nof renewable energy capacity, helping the country progress toward its clean energy targets.4 To \nachieve  sustainable  long-term  economic  growth,  India  is  promoting  alternative  sources  of \nenergy, such as wind and solar, for power generation. Renewable energy is a secure, reliable, \nand  sustainable  source  of  electricity  that  helps  diversify  the  country\u2019s  energy  mix,  strengthen \nenergy security, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. \n \n9. \nThe  project  also  contributes  to  the  acceleration  and  expansion  of  private  sector \ninvestment, including foreign direct investment in clean energy infrastructure in India. MEIL sees \nADB\u2019s  potential  assistance  as  a  key  success  factor  in  expanding  the  company\u2019s  renewable \nenergy  portfolio.  In  particular,  it  is  expected  that  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  help  attract  further \ninvestments in India\u2019s renewable energy sector from both within and outside India. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n \n10. \nThe  project's  outcome  is  increased  renewable  energy  capacity  operated  by  the  private \nsector.  The  project  will  generate  1,200  gigawatt-hours  of  clean  energy  per  annum  and  will \ncontribute to avoiding 1,185,165 tons of carbon dioxide emissions5 annually from 2018 onward. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n \nThe  project  outputs  are  (i)  the  development  and  commissioning  of  476  MW  of  wind \n11. \npower  and  100  MW  of  solar  power  generation  capacity  by  April  2017,  and  (ii)  the  creation  of \n2,500 contractual jobs during construction and 95 full-time jobs during operations. \n \nC. \n \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n \nThe project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.6 It relates to two \n12. \nof the five core specializations of the bank: infrastructure and environment. The midterm review \ncalls for investing $2 billion annually in clean energy (including renewable energy). It highlights \nthe  key  role  of  the  private  sector  in  climate  change  mitigation  and  confirms  that  ADB  should \ncontinue to prioritize private sector operations in clean and renewable energy to meet growing \nenergy  demand  in  a  sustainable  manner.  The  project  will  also  contribute  to  the  bank\u2019s \n                                                \n4  The  Government  of  India  has  revised  its  renewable  targets  and  now  plans  to  achieve  175  GW  of  renewable \n\n5  ADB. 2011.

The \nproject is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 for India, which calls for \n\u201cinvestments in renewable energy development.\u201d7 \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n \nThe project is fully aligned with ADB's Energy Policy.8 The policy states that support for \n13. \nrenewable  energy  projects  will  be  prioritized  and  broadened.  In  2013,  ADB  doubled  its  clean \nenergy  investment  target  to  $2  billion  a  year.  As  part  of  its  stronger  commitment  to  financing \nrenewable energy projects, ADB will increase its assistance to such projects to $6 billion a year \nby 2020. As part of the policy implementation, ADB emphasizes private sector participation as a \ntool to boost energy sector efficiency by introducing competition and more investable resources. \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons from Previous Operations \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n \n14. \nThe  extended  annual  reviews  of  wind  and  solar  projects  previously  financed  by  ADB\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Operations Department in India highlighted three key lessons: (i) the importance \nof  resource  assessment,  (ii)  the  risks  associated  with  land  acquisition,  and  (iii)  the  need  for \nadequate  power  evacuation  facilities.  These  lessons  will  be  taken  into  account  in  the \nimplementation and are part of MEIL\u2019s project-selection process. \n \nD. \n \n15. \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \nE. \n \n22. \n\nTable 5 summarizes the implementation arrangements.9 \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $669.5 million.  \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nTable 5: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation period \nConstruction arrangements  \n\nType of arrangement \n \n\nArrangements \nThe  energy  sector  in  India  is  regulated.

ADB loans will carry an interest rate as \nwell as other fees as approved by ADB\u2019s Investment Committee. \n \nB. \n \n25. \n \n\nThe proposed project merits ADB assistance for the following reasons: \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n(i)   Clean energy development support. ADB assistance will support the Government \nof India\u2019s efforts to develop renewable energy, where the private sector is expected \nto  play  a  major  role.  Supporting  a  renewable  energy  developer  with  a  portfolio  of \nprojects through a debt package, as opposed to single-project financing, is a way to \nachieve greater leverage of ADB\u2019s funding and hence greater development impact. \n(ii)  Foreign  direct  investment  support.  ADB  assistance  will  support  the  growth  of  a \nprofessionally  managed  renewable  energy  platform.  ADB  assistance  will  facilitate \n$175 million as foreign direct investments in these six SPVs, incorporated in India. \n\nRisks \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\n \nC. \n \n26. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\n \n27. \n \n28. \n \n29. \n \n30. \n \n31. \n \n32. \n \n33. \n \n34.

The \nidentified sites are not considered to be along a major fly route for migratory birds and no known \nbat populations exist in their vicinities. Environmental impacts during construction are generally \nsite-specific  and  reversible.  Potential  noise  and  shadow  flicker  impacts  during  operations  are \nexpected to be within acceptable limits. An environmental and social audit was completed and \nadequate  measures  to  solve  outstanding  compliance  issues  were  put  in  place.  The  potential \nenvironmental and social impacts of the project were identified and effective measures to avoid, \nminimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts are incorporated in the safeguard \nreports and plans. MEIL\u2019s institutional capacity and commitment to manage the project\u2019s social \nand environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n36.  MEIL  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \nStrategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards. 10 The borrower will report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance \nwith  such  laws  and  (ii)  the  measures  taken.  Information  disclosure  and  consultation  with \naffected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.11 \n \nB. \n \n37.  MEIL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \n38. \nDuring  project  preparation  the  integrity  due  diligence  was  conducted  and  significant \nintegrity issues were addressed or disclosed herewith. MEIL is directly and indirectly owned by \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n                                                \n10 ADB. 2003. Social Protection.

Both are rated as largely compliant with the tax transparency principles, and neither is on \nthe  Financial  Action  Task  Force's  list  of  countries  with  strategic  anti-money  laundering \ndeficiencies. The structure was adopted for purposes of tax efficiency and to allow MEL to raise \nfunds from listing in an overseas market and Bindu Vayu to pass-through funds raised by MEL \nto  its  Indian  subsidiary.  ADB  does  not  believe  that  the  structure  was  established  for  cross-\nborder tax evasion, money laundering, or the financing of terrorism in the jurisdictions involved \nin the project. Politically exposed persons were identified in this transaction and adverse media \nwas found on several individuals and corporate structures.
