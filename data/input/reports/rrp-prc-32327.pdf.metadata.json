The \nsummary  EIA  was  circulated  to  the  Board  on  24  May  2002  and \nmade available on the Asian Development Bank (ADB) website on \n7 June 2002. \n \nThe  Project  will  help  (i)  reduce  water  pollution;  (ii)  protect  water \nresources;  (iii)  promote  sustainable  economic  development;  and \n(iv)  improve  the  environment,  living  conditions,  and  public  health \nstandards  in  four  cities  of  Hebei  Province.  The  Project  has  five \ncomponents  to  provide  improved  wastewater  collection  and \ntreatment in Baoding, Chengde, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou. The \nProject  will  also  involve  capacity  building  and  training  for  the \nHebei provincial government and municipal sewerage companies \n(MSCs). \n \nThe Hai River Basin is the fifth largest river basin in the PRC and \nintersects four provinces and two provincial cities. Hebei Province \nlies  entirely  within  the  basin,  which  has  120  million  people,  65 \nmillion of whom live in Hebei. It contributes about one third of the \nwastewater flow and pollution load. As a result of rapid economic \ngrowth  and  urbanization,  water  pollution  and  water  scarcity  have \nbecome major problems. The Project will significantly help control \nwater  pollution  in  Hebei  and  the  Hai  River  Basin.   The Project is \nthe  major  urban  infrastructure  initiative  under  Hebei\u2019s  10th  Five-\nYear  Plan  (2001-2005).  The  proposed  wastewater  treatment \nplants and associated sewage collection and disposal systems in \nHebei  cities  were \nimmediate-\nimprovement  projects  in  the  ADB-assisted  Hai  River  Basin \nPollution Prevention and Control Plan.  \n \nThe project objectives are to enhance the urban environment and \npublic  health  through  better  wastewater  management,  and  to \nimprove the quality of surface- and groundwater resources in and \ndownstream  of  the  project  cities.  Related  objectives  include  (i) \ncreating  MSCs  and  making  them  efficient  and  commercially \nmanaged;  (ii)  supporting  integrated  approaches  to  basin-wide \npollution  prevention  and  control;  and  (iii)  improving  cost  recovery \nfrom  users  through  an  improved  tariff  structure,  with  gradual \nincreases to achieve full cost recovery. \n \nThe total  project  cost  is  $165.34  million  equivalent,  including  a \nforeign exchange cost of $82.36 (49.8%) and a local currency cost \nof $82.98 million (50.2%) equivalent. \n\nidentified  as  high-priority \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n \n\n \nSource \nA.

The loan will have a 25-year term, including \na  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nfacility,  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  a  front-end  fee  of  1.0 \npercent, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreement. \n \nThe loan proceeds will be re-lent by the central Government to the \nprovincial  government  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  the \nADB  loan.  The  provincial  government  will  on-lend  the  loan \nproceeds  to  municipal  governments  on  the  same  terms  and \nconditions as the  ADB  loan.  The  municipal  governments  will  on-\nlend the loan proceeds to the MSCs serving the project cities on \nthe  same  terms  and  conditions  as  the  ADB  loan.  The  MSCs  will \nassume  the  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  variation  risks  for \nthe  ADB  loan  and  reimburse  the  municipal  governments  and \nprovincial  government  for  any  intermediation  and  transaction \ncosts. \n \nUntil 30 June 2008 \n \n31 December 2007 \n\n \nThe  Hebei  Finance  Bureau,  under  the  overall  direction  and \nguidance  of  the  HPG  leading  group  headed  by  the  provincial \ndeputy  governor,  will  coordinate  project  implementation  through \nthe  Hebei  Project  Management  Office  (HPMO),  various  design \ninstitutes,  and  MSCs,  which  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nproject management. \n \nHebei provincial government \n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \n\n\f \n\nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n iii \n\nADB-financed  equipment  and  materials  will  be  procured  in \nfor  Procurement.  Major \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \ncontracts  for  equipment  and  materials  will  be  tendered  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding  or \ninternational  shopping, \ndepending  on  the  contract  amount.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement, foreign contractors may participate in \nthe bidding for local competitive bidding contracts. \n \nAbout  90  person-months  of  international  and  160  person-months \nof  domestic  consulting  will  be  required.  Consultants  should  have \nexpertise  in  international  competitive  bidding  and  international \nshopping  procedures,  including  international  specifications,  bid \nevaluation,  contracts,  quality  control,  and  project  performance \nmanagement systems. The consultants will provide guidance and \ntraining for capacity building to ensure that (i) the MSC in each of \nthe  four  project  cities  is  able  to  function  effectively  as  a  project \nimplementation  unit;  (ii)  appropriate  institutional,  managerial, \nfinancial,  and  operational  arrangements  are  in  place  to  enhance \noperational  effectiveness,  management  efficiency,  and  financial \nsustainability;  (iii)  MSCs  become  effective  operating  companies \nafter  project  implementation;  and  (iv)  social,  resettlement,  and \nenvironmental  impacts  are  monitored.  A  consulting  firm  will  be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.  Detailed  design  engineering  and  construction \nsupervision  will  be  carried  out  by  qualified  local  design  institutes \nrecruited by the project cities; these services will not be financed \nby ADB. \n \nThe  Project  will  benefit  2.4  million urban residents in 2010 in the \nfour cities whose living conditions and public health standards will \nbe  improved  through  the  collection  and  treatment  of  about \n540,000  cubic  meters  per  day  of  untreated  sewage.  The  savings \nto  industry,  through  avoidance  of  individual  on-site  wastewater \ntreatment  required  for  discharge  to  surface  water,  will  support \nsustainable  economic  growth,  promote  clean  technologies  and \nwater  conservation,  and  ameliorate  the  poverty  impacts  of  plant \nclosures  imposed  on  environmental  grounds.  The  Project  will \ncontribute  to  downstream  benefits  of  improved  water  quality \nthrough  the  collection  and  treatment  of  wastewater  generated  in \neach  project  city.  Downstream  beneficiaries  will  include  coastal \nareas of Bohai Bay and the 20 million people in Beijing and Tianjin \nCity,  which  are  surrounded  by  Hebei  Province.  These  water \nquality  improvements  will  contribute  to  the  integrated  river  basin-\nwide  management  program  and  cross-jurisdictional  pollution \nprevention and control.   \n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  environmental  impact  is  positive,  and  the  benefits \ngreatly  outweigh  the  negative  impacts.  The  Project  has  been \ndesigned \nto  mitigate  all  construction-related  environmental \nimpacts. Adequate provision has been made to fully compensate \nthe  estimated  4,983  people  adversely  affected  by  the  Project, \nprimarily  due  to  temporary  and  permanent  loss  of  land.  Physical \nrelocation  of  230  households  is  expected.  Extensive  consultation \nwith  affected  people  has  been  undertaken  as  outlined  in  the \nresettlement  plans,  which  were  made  public  after  approval  of \nfeasibility  studies.  A  composite  resettlement  plan \ndomestic \ncovering four resettlement plans was posted on the ADB website \non 7 May 2002. \n \nThe Project will help reduce poverty by (i) reducing the incidence \nof  waterborne  diseases,  costs  of  medical  care,  and  sick  days \ntaken,  thus  leaving  households  with  more  income;  and  (ii) \nimproving the quality of life of the urban poor by collecting sewage \nin  poor  neighborhoods  and  improving  water  quality  in  urban \ndrainage channels.  \n \nWastewater tariffs in each project city will be increased to ensure \nfull  cost  recovery  by  2008,  the  first  year  of  operation  of  the  new \nwastewater facilities.   \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n v\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Hebei  Province  Wastewater  Management \nProject. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  is  in  Hebei  Province,  northern  PRC,  which  has  an  area  of  188,000 square \nkilometers  and  a  population  of  65  million.  The  province  lies  in  the  heavily  polluted  Hai  River \nBasin  (HRB)  which  drains  into  Bohai  Bay  through  nine  tributaries.  The  Project  is  one  of  a \nnumber  of  planned  wastewater  management  projects  under  the  Hai  River  Basin  Pollution \nPrevention and Control Plan (HRPPCP), funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 This \nbasin-wide program comprises more than 400 potential projects, of which the high-priority ones \nare targeted for completion in 2010. The four project cities are priority areas under the plan, and \nthe  project  components  have  been  prioritized  for  immediate  implementation  under  the \nHRPPCP. \n \nDuring the 2002 Country Programming Mission, the Government reconfirmed its request \n3. \nfor  assistance  for  the  Project.  In  2000,  ADB  provided  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  help  the \nHebei  provincial  government  formulate  the  Project.2  Following  completion  of  the  TA  study  in \nAugust  2001,  the  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  the  PRC  in  November  2001,  and  the  follow-up \nFact-Finding  Mission  in  March  2002  to  discuss  the  Project  with  the  central  and  provincial \ngovernments.  The  Government  approved  a  feasibility  study  prepared  by  the  Hebei  provincial \ngovernment  on  7  November  2002.  Loan  negotiations  with  authorized  representatives  of  the \ncentral Government were conducted in Manila from 18 to 22 November 2002. The Project was \nformulated based on the findings of the ADB missions, information provided by the Government, \nbeneficiary consultations, discussions with other funding agencies, and recommendations of the \nfeasibility study and TA consultants. The project framework outlines the goal, purpose, outputs, \nand inputs or activities (Appendix 1).  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n4. \nSince  the  1980s,  water  has  rapidly  become  scarcer  for  industrial  use  and  domestic \nconsumption, especially in northern PRC, creating severe economic losses. Many rivers in this \nregion  are  dry  for  5\u20138  months  a  year,  which  has  serious  implications  for  water  resource \nmanagement  in  the  basin.  In  the  HRB,  the  demand  for  water  (50  billion  cubic  meters  [m 3] per \nyear) exceeded supply (33.9 billion m 3) by 16.1 billion m 3 in 2000.  \n \n5. \nIncreasing  reliance  on  groundwater  to  compensate  for  surface  water  scarcity  has \ncompromised  future  sustainable  use  of  the  resource.  Water  supplies  are  so  dependent  on \nground water resources that limiting extraction will dramatically increase water shortages. In the \nHRB, estimates of sustainable groundwater supply are in the order of 17.3 billion m3 while 1998 \nwithdrawals were 26.1 billion m3, indicating that overextraction is as high as 8.8 billion m3 every \nyear.  As  a  result,  deep  and  shallow  groundwater  tables  have  dropped  90  and  50  meters, \nrespectively,  on  the  Hai  plains.  Other  side  effects  of  unsustainable  exploitation  include  salinity \nintrusion and ground subsidence.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1998.

Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Hebei Province Wastewater Management \n\nand Pollution Control. Manila. \n\nProject. Manila.  \n\n\f 2\n\nSurface  and  groundwater  pollution  now  represent  a  huge  problem  not  only  for  the \n6. \nenvironment  but  also  for  public  health,  especially  since  water  is  so  scarce  in  northern  PRC. \nOver 65% of river length in the HRB is classified as highly polluted and has no beneficial use. \nMajor  groups  of  polluters  include  industrial  and  municipal  wastewater  and  other  nonpoint \nsources. \n \n7. \nDuring  the  1990s,  industrial  wastewater  flows  and  loads  declined  significantly  while \nmunicipal flows and loads increased. In 1999, municipal wastewater flows (20.3 billion m3) and \nchemical oxygen demand loads (7.0 million tons) exceeded total industrial flows (19.7 billion m 3) \nand  loads  (6.9  million  tons)  for  the  first  time.  These  trends  are  likely  to  continue.  Industries \ngradually decreased their wastewater flows and loads through wastewater pretreatment, internal \nreuse of process water, and use of cleaner technology. However, the performance of municipal \nwastewater  management  is  generally  poor:  wastewater  treatment  rates  are  far  lower  than \nindustrial  rates,  treatment  capacities  are  frequently  underutilized,  and  treatment  efficiency  is \noften low.  \n \nAs  in  industrialized  countries,  pollution  from  urban  municipal  wastewater  in  the  PRC  is \n8. \nmanaged  through  updated  municipal  sewerage  systems,  including  collection  sewers  and \ntreatment plants designed to receive industrial wastewater, resulting in large savings because of \neconomy of scale of treatment to remove degradable organics.3 The treated municipal effluent is \nreused for irrigation and industries. The municipal systems also provide on-site excreta disposal \nunits  for  homes  and  buildings  not  connected  to  municipal  sewers.  A  new  challenge  is  to \nestablish  or  extend  a  permit  system  whereby  municipal  governments  can  control  wastewater \ndischarges from industries, including monitoring and enforcement of their performance.  \n \n9. \nTo  cope  with  increasing  demand  for  updated  municipal  sewerage  systems,  in  1991\u2013\n1999 construction of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) increased dramatically from 87 to \n398,  and  total  capacity  from  4.7  million  to  15.8  million  m3  per  day.  Despite  the  tremendous \nincrease in municipal wastewater treatment capacity over the last decade, most cities continue \nto be underserved by sewers and wastewater treatment plants. In 2000, only 7.5 billion m 3 (34% \nof  the  total  discharges)  of  municipal  wastewater  were  estimated  to  have  received  secondary \ntreatment. This is a significant improvement on the 4% rate achieved in 1991, but backlog is still \nenormous.  Municipal  water  demand  projections  show  that  municipal  wastewater  treatment \ncapacity  will  have  to  be  nearly  quadrupled  over  the  next  20  years  just  to  maintain  its  level  of \nservice.  \n \nDuring the 1990s, most water pollution was caused by industries. While great progress \n10. \nhas  been  made  in  reducing  pollution,  municipal  wastewater  management  has  lagged  behind \nlargely because financial and institutional constraints hinder city governments from keeping up \nwith rapid urban growth. An important regulatory measure for industrial pollution control during \nthe  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan  (9th  FYP)  (1996-2000)  was  to  request  urban  industries  to  treat  their \nwastewater  to  national  wastewater  discharge  standards  by  31  December  2000.  The  key \noperational  policy  for  urban  wastewater  management  included  the  requirement  that  by  2010, \nwastewater treatment rate in all cities should not be lower than 60%, and not lower than 70% for \nmajor cities4 with secondary treatment facilities. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n3  The  participating  industries  remove  toxic  and  other  objectionable  substances  by  using  in-plant treatment before \n\ndischarging wastewater into the municipal system (National Standards, GB8978). \n\n4 These include cities directly under the central Government, and provincial capital cities and key tourist cities.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 3\n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n11. \nThe  acute  water  shortage  in  northern  PRC  will  soon  become  unmanageable  unless \nmuch more significant, comprehensive, and decisive measures are taken. Recognizing that the \nlack  of  water  seriously  limits  economic  and  social  development,  the  Government  gives  high \npriority  to  water  resource  management.  While  augmenting  supply  will  partly  solve  the  water \nshortage,5  preconditions  for  success  are  proper  management  of  groundwater,  water  pollution \nprevention and control, and wastewater reuse.  \n \n12.  Water pollution will continue to be a critical problem over the next decade. Rivers, lakes, \nand groundwater are expected to deteriorate in many areas, particularly in the water-short north. \nThe challenge will be to maintain the momentum of industrial pollution control and broaden the \nattack  to  cover  growing  problems  of  municipal  wastewater  discharges  and  nonpoint  sources. \nThe  issues  are  complex  and  the  institutions  influencing  the  pace  and  nature  of  development \nnumerous.  Any  strategy  to  solve  municipal  water  pollution  must  create  a  firm  and  sustainable \nfinancial basis to operate municipal wastewater services. A key element is adequate pricing of \nwastewater services.  \n \n13. \nThe  Government\u2019s  ongoing  economic  and  enterprise  reform  programs  require  that  all \nwastewater and water supply projects be financially sustainable and capable of cost recovery. \nHebei  is  a  priority  area  for  tariff  reform.  ADB  has  supported  the  water  tariff  reform  process \nthrough  several  TA  projects.6  A  study  on  wastewater  tariff  is  helping  the  Government  develop \nnational wastewater tariff guidelines.  \n \nto  build  basic  sewerage \n14. \ninfrastructure  to  meet  the  challenge  of  increased  urbanization.  Total  investment  in  water \npollution  control  has  increased  by  48%  in  nominal  terms,  from  CNY182  billion  during  the  9th \nFYP  to  CNY270  billion  during  the  10th  FYP  (2001-2005).  Capital investment to meet demand \nfor  wastewater  services  will  be  enormous,  and  private  sector  participation  will  likely  be \nnecessary  to  help  bridge  the  financing  gap.  However,  private  sector  participation  will  not  be \nfeasible unless service charges are raised to financially viable levels. \n \nNonpoint  water  pollution  due  to  fertilizer  runoff,  pesticide  runoff,  and  discharges  from \n15. \nintensive animal production is worsening. Nonpoint sources of nutrients are significant sources \nof  eutrophication,  which  is  occurring  in  many  lakes  throughout  the  PRC  and  also  in  shallow \nnear-shore  marine  areas  that  experience  limited  tidal  flushing.  Bohai  Bay  is  susceptible  to \neutrophication as indicated by the frequent occurrence of red tides. The 2002 country strategy \nand  program  includes  assistance  from  ADB  to  address  nonpoint  water  pollution  control  at  a \npolicy level.7  \n \nTo  clean  up  the  most  polluted  river  basins,  the  Government  uses  an  integrated  basin-\n16. \nwide wastewater management approach, which has many advantages, including effective and \nsustainable  water  resource  development  and  management.

The wastewater sector \nanalysis focusing on the HRB is in Appendix 2. \n \nThe  Project  will  significantly  help  control  water  pollution  in  the  HRB  and  Hebei  by \n17. \nimproving  wastewater  collection  and  treatment.  The  Project  is  the  major urban infrastructure \ninitiative under the Hebei 10th FYP.9 Secondary treatment is to be achieved by 2005 in the 11 \nprefecture cities of Hebei, including the four project cities\u2014Baoding, Chengde, Tangshan, and \nZhangjiakou.10  The  five  proposed  WWTPs  and  associated sewage collection and conveyance \nsystems  were  identified  as  high-priority  immediate-improvement  projects  in  the  ADB-assisted \nHRPPCP.  \n \nTo help the Government develop and implement its strategies, external assistance has \n18. \nbeen provided mainly from ADB (Appendix 3), the World Bank, and Japan Bank for International \nCooperation  (JBIC).  ADB  has  provided  11  loans,  totaling  more  than  $1  billion,  for  urban \nenvironment  improvement,  urban  wastewater,  and  water  supply.  ADB  has  provided  five  loans \nfor  wastewater  management  and  water  supply  in  Dalian  City  (Liaoning  Province),  Anhui \nProvince,  Zhejiang  Province,  Fuzhou  City  (Fujian  Province),  and  Tianjin  City.  ADB  has  also \nprovided  a  loan  to  help  reduce  pollution  and  restore  the  water  quality  of  Suzhou  Creek \n(Shanghai  City).  Five  of  ADB\u2019s  urban  environmental  projects  have  financed  wastewater \nmanagement components (e.g., Beijing, Chengde, Hefei, Qingdao, and Tangshan).  \n \n19. \nCost  recovery  has  been  promoted  through  policy  dialogue  on  tariff  increases and the \nintroduction of commercial management principles. These measures have helped demonstrate \nthat  such  projects  can  be  financially  viable  under  the  lending  terms  of  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources. As a result, ADB\u2019s future PRC program includes more wastewater projects.  \n \n20. \nSince 1988, ADB has financed 48 TA studies for $32.6 million to solve problems in water \nresources  and  pollution  control,  urban  wastewater  management,  and  water  supply.  ADB\u2019s \nassistance has resulted in rational pricing of water, major increases in water tariffs, introduction \nof  wastewater  tariffs,  implementation  of  commercial  principles,  improved  environmental \nmanagement,  formulation  of  effluent  standards  and  development  of  regulatory  aspects,  and \nintroduction of private  sector  participation.  These  improvements  are  fundamental  to  make  the \nwater and wastewater sectors financially and operationally sustainable.  \n \n21. \nADB has led in promoting private sector participation in the PRC\u2019s water supply sector. \nFollowing  the  TA  to  help  the  Government  prepare  the  first  pilot  build-operate-transfer water \nsupply  project,  ADB  provided  a  $26.5-million  loan  and  a  $21.5-million  complementary  loan  to \nfinance the Chengdu Water Supply Project. ADB also recently approved a $150-million loan to \nhelp  finance  a  water  infrastructure  facility,  which  will  fund  relatively  small  water  projects  that \nADB has difficulty assisting directly. \n \n22. \nThe World Bank has participated in 20 urban environmental and water supply projects, \nincluding  a  parallel  wastewater  management  project  in  three  prefecture  cities  in  Hebei: \nShijiazhuang, Handan, and a portion of Tangshan.11 Japan, through JBIC, is the largest bilateral \nsource  of  aid  to  the  PRC  and  is  mainly  involved  in  physical  infrastructure,  water  resource \n                                                 \n8   The others are the Huai and the Liao river basins. \n9   This is an action plan for the Hebei Province part of the national 10th FYP. \n10 The other seven cities are Shijiazhuang, Qinhuangdao, Handan, Xingtai, Cangzhou, Langfang, and Hengshui. \n11 The ADB and World Bank projects cover different service areas in Tangshan, and are complementary and mutually \n\nreinforcing. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 5\n\ndevelopment,  and  environmental  improvement  projects.  Bilateral  aid  agencies  from  Australia, \nCanada,  Finland,  Germany,  Italy,  Norway,  Sweden,  United  Kingdom,  and  United  States  also \nfund wastewater and water resource projects, although on a smaller scale than multilateral aid \nagencies. \n \n23. \nExperience  in  wastewater  and  water  resource  management  in  the  PRC,  although \nlimited, indicates that projects are well implemented and that water and wastewater tariffs are \nincreased as required. Analysis indicates that consumers are willing to pay substantially higher \nprices  for  reliable  supply  of  good-quality  water  and,  to  a  certain  extent,  for  wastewater \ntreatment. Issues related to tariff levels, cost recovery, and commercial orientation of the water \nutilities were carefully addressed during project processing. Lessons learned from the previous \nprojects were reflected in the project design, including thorough review of technical designs and \ntechnologies,  rigorous  financial  and  economic  analysis,  social  assessment,  and  institutional-\nstrengthening measures to improve corporate governance. \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s three strategic objectives for the PRC are to (i) improve economic efficiency, (ii) \npromote  growth  to  reduce  poverty  in  poor  interior  provinces,  and  (iii)  enhance environmental \nprotection and natural resource management. Wastewater treatment can contribute to all these. \nProper management of wastewater is essential to raise the living standards and productivity of \nurban  populations,  protect  water  resources,  and  sustain  economic  growth.  In  the  wastewater \nsector,  ADB  focuses  on  (i)  improving  wastewater  services  through  investment  in  physical \ninfrastructure,  (ii)  promoting  improved  corporate  governance  and  commercial  management  to \nenhance  the  potential  for  future  private  sector  involvement,  (iii)  improving  cost  recovery  by \nstrengthening  tariff  systems  and  structures  for  wastewater  to  ensure  sustainability  and  attract \nprivate  participation,  and  (iv)  ensuring  water  resource  conservation  and  environmental \nprotection through legislative and regulatory provisions.  \n \n25. \nIn  support  of  the  strategy,  the  agenda  for  policy  dialogue  in  the  wastewater  sector  has \ncovered  key  areas  of  basin-wide  pollution  prevention  and  control,  industrial  and  municipal \nwastewater management, enterprise reform and corporate governance, cost recovery and tariff \nreform, and private sector participation. These are highlighted as special features of the Project \n(paras. 33\u201338) and detailed in  Appendix 4. The Project will improve the quality of rivers, lakes, \nand  groundwater  in  and  downstream  from  the  project  cities  by  collecting  and  treating \nwastewater generated. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country operational strategy. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives  \n\n26. \nThe  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  improve  the  urban  environment  and  public  health \nthrough  improved  wastewater  management,  and  to  improve  the  quality  of  surface-  and \ngroundwater  in  and  downstream  from  the  project  cities.  Related  objectives  include  (i)  creating \nmunicipal sewerage companies (MSCs) and making them efficient and commercially managed; \n(ii)  supporting  comprehensive  approaches  to  river  basin-wide pollution prevention and control; \nand (iii) improving cost recovery from users through improved tariffs, with gradual increases to \nachieve full cost recovery.  \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n27. \nThe  Project  has  five  components,  consisting  of  improved  wastewater  collection  and \ntreatment systems in the four project cities. Project outputs include (i) WWTPs that would treat \n\n\f 6\n\nabout 540,000 m3/day of raw or partly treated industrial and domestic wastewater by 2010; (ii) \nmore  than  300  kilometers  (km)  of  sewers  and  interceptors  that  would  improve  the  urban \nenvironment  for  2.4  million  urban  residents,  by  2010,  and  provide  sufficient  capacity  for  an \nenlarged  service  area,  by  2020;  (iii)  strengthen  institutional  capacity  of  the  MSC  to  provide \nimproved wastewater services to customers by 2007; and (iv) adherence to the HRPPCP, which \nrequires execution of projects under the Immediate Im plementation Program by 2005.  \n \n\n1. \n\nPart A: Wastewater Collection and Treatment in Baoding \n\n \n28. \nPart  A  will  serve  the  urban  districts  of  Baoding,  the  largest  project  city  with  718,000 \npeople in 2000, expected to increase to 870,000 in 2010. Facilities include 97 km of sewers, two \nsubmersible-pump  lift  stations,  and  a  WWTP  expansion  of  160,000  m3/day. The city has two \nWWTPs,  each  with  a  capacity  of  80,000  m3/day;  the  downstream  plant,  Yingdingzhuang,  is  to \nbe  expanded  under  the  Project.  The  existing  collection system was developed piecemeal and \nhas  many  deficiencies  related  to  inadequate  ground  cover,  adverse  slope,  and  inappropriate \nrouting  of  sewers.  Major  portions  of  the  collection  system  are  to  be  rebuilt  under  the  Project. \nIndustrial  wastewater  is  about  half  the  total  flow.  Wastewater  treatment  will  improve  water \nquality  in  the  downstream  Baiyangdian  lakes,  which  collectively  form  the  largest  lake  in  the \nnorthern China plain and have great potential for tourism and improved fisheries. \n \n \n \n29. \nPart B will serve the city proper of Chengde, whose population is expected to grow from \n250,000  in  2000  to  325,000  in  2010.  Facilities  include  32  km  of  sewers  and  a  WWTP  with  a \ncapacity of 80,000  m3/day.  Chengde  relies  on  tourism  related  to  the  former  imperial  summer \npalace and adjacent temples, and has developed a workable separate sewer system to protect \nwater  quality  in  ponds  created  behind  inflatable  dams  on  the  Wulie  River,  which  runs  through \nthe city center. The downstream portion of the Wulie is heavily polluted by raw sewage from two \nmajor  outfalls  of  the  city,  while  pollution  of  the  downstream  Luan  River  affects  the  Panda \nreservoirs,  which  are  raw  water  sources  for  Tianjin\u2019s  potable  water  supply.  The  industrial \nwastewater component is only 20% of the total. The status of Chengde as an environmentally \nresponsible prefecture-level municipality and as a tourism center will be at risk until it acquires \nwastewater treatment facilities. \n\nPart B: Wastewater Collection and Treatment in Chengde  \n\n2. \n\n \n3. \n\nPart C: Wastewater Collection and Treatment in Tangshan New District \n\n \n30. \nPart C will serve a portion of Tangshan, about 15 km from the city center, consisting of \nthe  New  District  and  the  urbanized  portion  of  Fengrun  County;  the  population  is  expected  to \nincrease from 180,000 in 2000 to 225,000 in 2010. The New District is on the coastal plain near \nthe  Hebei  border  with  Tianjin.  The  facilities  include  10  km  of  sewers  and  a  WWTP  with  a \ncapacity  of  80,000  m3/day.  The  new  facilities  are  adjacent  to  the  32,000  m3/day New District \nplant, which is heavily overloaded and will be rehabilitated under the Project. The service area \ncontains  a  modern,  economically  competitive  industrial  park,  and  industries  generate  70%  of \ntotal  wastewater.  In  the  absence  of  an  expanded municipal treatment plant, the industries are \nfaced  with  very  high  costs  for  advanced  on-site  wastewater  treatment  to  meet  surface  water \ndischarge  standards.  The  Huanxiang  River  flows  through  the  city  and  provides  water  for \ndownstream municipalities, and  agriculture.  The  river  is  heavily  polluted  by  discharges  of  raw \nsewage  and  partly  treated  wastewater,  aggravated  by  an  upstream  reservoir  that  prevents \ndilution  from  stream  flow.  Residents  and  farmers  downstream  in  Tangshan  and  Tianjin  have \nformally complained, and requested improved treatment. \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 7\n\n4. \n\nPart D1: Wastewater Collection and Treatment in Zhangjiakou  \n\n \n31. \nPart  D1  will  serve  Zhangjiakou  City  proper,  whose  population  of  500,000  in  2000  is \nexpected to increase to 632,000 in 2010. The facilities include 40 km of sewers, 5 km of open \nchannel, and a WWTP with a capacity of 100,000 m3/day. The city has no municipal wastewater \ntreatment,  and  raw  sewage  discharges  from  400  outlets,  heavily  polluting  the  Qingshui  River \nthat  runs  through  the  middle  of  the  city.  Farmers  divert  raw  sewage  from  the  river  for  use  in \nirrigation.  Half  of  the  wastewater  is  from  industry  and,  in  combination  with  wastewater  from \nXuanhua,  the  large  pollution  loads  have  polluted  and  prevented  beneficial  use  of  Beijing\u2019s \nGuanting  Reservoir  as  a  standby  drinking  water  source,  which  lies  downstream  on  the  Yang \nRiver.  \n \n\n5. \n\nPart D2: Wastewater Collection and Treatment in Xuanhua \n\n \n32. \nPart  D2  will  serve  Xuanhua,  an  industrial  urban  district  of  Zhangjiakou,  30  km \ndownstream  on  flat  terrain  adjacent  to  the  Yang  River.  The  population  of  235,000  in  2000  is \nexpected to grow to 300,000 in 2010. The facilities include 31 km of sewers and a WWTP with a \ncapacity of 120,000 m3/day. The area has no municipal wastewater treatment. About 80% of the \nwastewater  is  from  industry,  including  a  major  steel  mill,  large  brewery,  fertilizer  plant,  and \npaper  mill.  Heavy-metal  pollution  over  many  years  from  poorly  treated  or  pretreated  industrial \ndischarges  has  prevented  beneficial  use  of  the  downstream  Guanting  Reservoir,  which  is \nintended  to  become  Beijing\u2019s  standby  water  supply  source.  The  municipal  treatment  plant  is \nurgently  needed  as  a  cost-effective  alternative  to  advanced  on-site  industrial  wastewater \ntreatment  at  many  small  plants.  (For  example,  the  steel  mill  has  19  pretreatment  plants \nscattered over half the urban area.) \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nThe Project supports and strengthens several ADB policy initiatives: (i) integrated basin-\n33. \nwide  pollution  prevention  and  control,  (ii)  improved  wastewater  management  to  create  a \nsustainable  urban  environment,  (iii)  enterprise  reform  and  corporate  governance,  (iv)  cost \nrecovery  and  tariff  reform,  and  (v)  private  sector  participation.  A  policy  framework  addressing \nissues and actions required is given in Appendix 4.  \n \n34. \nThe  HRPPCP  provides  a  policy  and  strategic  framework  for  pollution  control  and \nprevention  in  the  HRB.  The  Project  will  help  the  Hebei  provincial  government  implement  its \nwater  quality  improvement  strategies  under  the  HRPPCP.  Interagency  cooperation  and  cross-\njurisdictional programs are vital elements of a basin-wide approach to pollution prevention and \ncontrol. Beijing and Zhangjiakou have discussed protecting Guanting Reservoir and restoring its \nwater quality as a standby drinking water source for the capital. Tianjin and the HPG have also \nheld  a  number  of  meetings  on  pollution  control  for  the  Yuqiao  Reservoir,  which  is  the  sole \ndrinking water source for Tianjin. \n \n35. \nA successful wastewater management policy will help prevent and control pollution and \ncarry  out  cost-effective  wastewater  management  and  operations.  Each  project  city  has  urban \nregulations,  including  on  sewer  connection  approval  and  supervision.  All  project  cities  plan  to \nintroduce  or  extend  the  use  of  wastew ater discharge permits. These permit systems have the \npotential to enhance the regulatory framework to manage industrial wastewater discharge. The \nProject will help MSCs lead in controlling discharge into public sewers.  \n \n\n\f 8\n\nTransforming MSCs into financially and managerially autonomous enterprises requires a \n36. \nsustainable institutional framework for project implementation and future operation. The Project \nwill address four aspects of confidence-building enterprise reform and corporate governance: (i) \nstructuring  MSCs  along  commercial  lines  with  substantial  managerial  and  financial  autonomy, \n(ii)  preparing  business  plans  and  introducing  management  information  systems,  (iii)  improving \nthe effectiveness of MSC boards of directors, and (iv) strengthening audit arrangements.  \n \n37. \nThe  MSCs  were  established  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  economic  and \nenterprise  reform  programs,  and  will  be  strengthened  under  the  relevant  laws.  Wastewater \ntariffs  will  be  increased  to  ensure  that  full  cost  recovery  is  achieved  by  2008,  the  first  year  of \noperation of the new wastewater facilities. The project cities increased wastewater tariffs during \n2000-2002 in anticipation of the Project.  \n\n \n\n38. \nPrivate  sector  participation  in  the  wastewater  sector  will  provide  a  new  source  of \nfinancing  and  thus  reduce  reliance  on  government  resources.  The  Project  will  help  create  the \nenvironment  necessary  for  private  sector  participation  by  pursuing  tariff  reform,  full  cost \nrecovery,  and  corporatization,  which  are  the  necessary  prerequisites  for  such  private  sector \ninvolvement. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n39. \nThe project cost is estimated at $165.34 million equivalent, comprising $82.36 million in \nforeign exchange costs and $82.98 million equivalent in local currency costs.

The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  a  front-end fee of \n1.0% (the fee will be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions as set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for borrowing \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking  that  these  choices  were  the  Government\u2019s  independent  decision  and  not  made  in \nreliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \nThe ADB loan will cover about 49.8% of total project costs. Loan proceeds will finance \n41. \nthe  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  of  the  Project,  including  a  front-end  fee,  interest  and \ncommitment fee on the loan during construction. Local costs will be financed by (i) central and \nmunicipal governments, and MSCs; and (ii) loans from the Bank of China and the Industrial and \nCommercial Bank of China.12 The financing plan for the Project is summarized in Table 2 and \ndetailed in Appendix 6.  \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \n\nSource \n\nTotal \nCost \n82.36 \n \n8.83 \n4.35 \n13.18 \n \n\nTotal \nPercentage \n49.8 \n \n5.4 \n2.6 \n8.0 \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n82.36 \n \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n0.00 \n \n8.83 \n4.35 \n13.18 \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nSubtotal \n\nSubtotal \n \n\nIndustrial and Commercial Bank of China \n \n\n1.

The  Hebei \n43. \nprovincial  government  has  established  a  leading  group  and  a  project  management  office.  The \nleading group, headed by a vice governor of Hebei, will oversee project implementation. The Hebei \nProject Management Office (HPMO), directed by the leading group, was es tablished in February \n2002  to  coordinate  the  efforts  of  the  local  project  implementing  agencies.  Each  participating \nmunicipality has also established a leading group and a project management office to coordinate \nproject preparation and implementation activities among agencies.  \n\n \n\nThe HPMO is an experienced project office in the provincial Finance Bureau. The HPMO \n44. \ndirector is also a vice director of the Finance Bureau, giving the HPMO adequate status within \nthe Hebei provincial government structure to be effective. The HPMO is a multidisciplined unit \nstaffed  with  financial  and  technical  specialists.  Most  permanent  HPMO  staff  are  experienced \nand qualified. The staffing of the HPMO varies according to need; the small core team can be \nsupplemented by  specialist  staff  drawn  from  other  provincial  government  departments,  which \nnominate  a  senior  official  as  a  parttime  HPMO  deputy  director.  The  organization  chart  of  the \nHPMO is in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n45. \nThe MSCs will be the project implementing agencies in the project cities. Each MSC has \nset  up  a  project  implementation  unit,  headed  by  a  general  manager,  to  coordinate  with  the \nHPMO, implement project activities on time, and be responsible for day-to-day implementation \nactivities.  An  organization  chart  of  the  project  implementation  units  in  the  MSCs  is  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  C.  Experienced  domestic  and  international  consultants  will  support \nthem.  Some  HPMO  and  MSC  staff  will  train  in  project  management  and  relevant  ADB \nprocedures, directly under the consultants and through broader training-related activities funded \nby  the  loan  proceeds.  The  HPMO  will  submit  detailed  training  programs  and  budgets  for  ADB \napproval before proceeding with training activities and will report on training effectiveness. \n \n\n  2. \n\nImplementation Schedule  \n\n3. \n\nProcurement  \n\n \n46. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  from  2003  to  2007  (Appendix  8).  The  project \nimplementation  structure  is  already  in  place,  and  preparatory  works  are  underway.  ADB\u2019s \nsuccessful experience in similar projects in the PRC, and the Hebei provincial government\u2019s in-\ndepth knowledge and experience in wastewater pollution control and wastewater collection and \ntreatment projects indicate that this schedule is achievable. \n \n \n \n47. \nADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor  Procurement.  The  HPMO  and  MSCs  have  been  briefed  on  the  guidelines\u2019  anticorruption \nprovisions.  Major  equipment  contracts  will  be  undertaken  through  ADB\u2019s  international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures,  and  equipment  packages  valued  under  $500,000  will  be \nprocured  following  ADB\u2019s  procedures  for  international  shopping.  Civil  works  estimated  to  cost \nbelow  $5  million  per  package  will  be  carried  out  under  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB) \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  in  accordance  with  the  PRC\u2019s  Government  Procurement \nLaw and Tendering and Bidding Law, and procurement regulations.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 11\n\nLocal  contractors  have  the  expertise  and  capacity  to  undertake  LCB  packages.  Since \n48. \nthey will involve mainly labor costs, international contractors are not likely to be interested in the \nwork,  and  LCB  is  considered  acceptable.  ADB,  however,  allows  foreign  contractors  to \nparticipate  in  bidding  for  LCB  contracts.  Indicative  procurement  packages  are  provided  in \nAppendix  9.  The  mode  of  procurement  will  be  decided  by  the  Hebei  provincial  government  in \nconsultation  with  ADB.  The  internationally  tendered  equipment  packages  will  include  the \ntechnical  support  necessary  to  ensure  proper  installation,  testing,  commissioning, and training \nof  operational  staff  as  part  of  the  related  contracts.  This  approach  assures  quality  control  in \nequipment installation and operator training, utilizing the manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 technical \nexperts who are most knowledgeable about the equipment.  \n \nAdvance  action  was  approved  on  30  April  2002  to  expedite  project  implementation.13 \n49. \nAdvance action, which may take place before loan effectiveness, includes (i) prequalification of \ncontractors,  tendering,  and  bid  evaluation  for  civil  works  contract  packages;  (ii)  preparation  of \ntender documents to procure materials, plant, and equipment; and (iii) recruitment of domestic \nand international consultants for construction supervision, project implementation, and training. \nThe HPMO has been advised that issuance of invitations to bid or to prequalify under advance \nprocurement  action  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  All  advance  procurement  actions  will  be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement, and advance recruitment of \nconsultants will be carried out in conformity with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nThe  Government,  HPMO,  and  MSCs  were  advised  that  approval  of  advance  action  does  not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project.  \n \n\n  4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n50. \nThe MSCs retain the services of competent and experienced design institutes to prepare \nthe  detailed  engineering  design  and  specifications,  and  to  supervise  construction.  MSCs  also \nretain  the  services  of  tendering  agencies  to  help  prepare  contract  documents  and  local \ncompetitive bidding procedures for prequalification of contractors; tendering and bid evaluation; \nand contract awards to procure equipment, materials, and civil works contract packages. These \nconsulting services will not be financed under the loan. \n \nProvision has been made for 90 person-months of international and 160 person-months \n51. \nof domestic consulting services to support the HPMO and MSCs in project implementation and \ncapacity building to be funded under the loan. These consultants will help the HPMO and MSCs \nin  ADB  procedures  and  reporting,  design  review,  procurement,  quality  control,  construction \ntesting,  commissioning,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and \nsupervision,  start-up \nimplementation  of  the  project  performance  management system (PPMS). The consultants will \nalso  provide  MSCs  with  advice,  guidance,  and  capacity-building training. A consulting firm will \nbe recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Outline terms of \nreference for the consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n5. \n\nTo facilitate disbursements for numerous small expenditures, an imprest account will be \n52. \nestablished by the HPMO after loan effectiveness in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook  (January  2001).  Disbursements  from  the  imprest  account  will  be  supported  by  an \nappropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related  documentation.  Such  documentation  will \ndemonstrate,  among  other  things,  that  the  goods  and/or  services  were  (i)  produced  in  and \n\n                                                 \n13 This action was reported in the July 2002 issue of ADB Business Opportunities. \n\n \n\n\f 12\n\nprocured from ADB member countries, and (ii) eligible for ADB financing. The initial amount to \nbe  deposited  into  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  estimated  expenditures  for  the  next  6 \nmonths,  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  The  statement-of-expenditures \nprocedure  may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures;  any  individual  contract  to  be \nreimbursed or liquidated under the procedure will not exceed $200,000.  \n \n\n  6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nThe  HPMO  and  MSCs  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project.  The  MSCs  will \n53. \nmaintain  records  of  all  project  expenditures  to  be  forwarded  regularly  to  the  HPMO,  and  the \nHPMO will prepare consolidated project accounts following international accounting standards. \nThe consolidated project accounts will be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable \nto ADB. Certified copies of such audited accounts in English will be submitted to ADB not later \nthan 6 months after the end of the financial year to which the accounts relate. As the ADB loan \nwill  be  on-lent  to  the  MSCs,  their  audited  financial  statements  will  also  be  submitted  to  ADB \nannually,  no  later  than  6  months  after  the  end  of  the  relevant  financial  year,  for  the  entire \nimplementation  period  plus  3  years  after  project  completion.  The  central  Government,  Hebei \nprovincial  government,  and  MSCs  are  informed  about  ADB's  policy  on  submission  of  audited \nfinancial statements and possible penalties for delays. The submitted audited project accounts \nand financial statements must be of acceptable quality.  \n \n54. \nIndependent  review  and  scrutiny  of  project  implementation  will  be  undertaken  for  (i) \nenvironmental monitoring and adherence to environmental impact assessment (EIA) provisions, \n(ii) compliance with the resettlement plan, and (iii) audit of project accounts and compliance with \nloan  covenants.  The  HPMO  will  submit  to  ADB  reports  and  information  concerning  the  use  of \nthe  loan  proceeds,  project  implementation,  and  MSC  performance.  The  reports  will  include (i) \nquarterly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation;  (ii)  annual  reports;  and  (iii)  a  project \ncompletion  report,  not  later  than  3  months  after  completion  of  the  project  facilities.  Progress \nreports will emphasize progress made in policy dialogue, including (i) wastewater tariff changes, \n(ii) environmental and water quality monitoring, (iii) resettlement, and (iv) capacity building and \nfinancial management of MSCs.  \n\n \n\n  7. \n\nProject Performance Management System \n\n \n55. \nThe PPMS indicators agreed on during project preparation include service levels, treated \nwastewater quality and other measures of operational performance, percentage of wastewater \ncollected  and  treated,  water  quality  of  the  receiving  waters  and  monitoring  network,  user \nsatisfaction with the urban environment, and relevant economic data to monitor project impacts. \nThe  relevance  and  practicability  of  data  collection  for  the  proposed  measures  has  been \nconfirmed  with  each  MSC.  At  the  beginning  of  the  Project,  the  HPMO  and  MSCs,  with  the \nassistance  of  consultants,  will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS  procedures  to  systematically \ngenerate  data  on  inputs  and  outputs  of  the  five  project  components  and  the  agreed-on \nsocioeconomic and environmental indicators to be used to measure project impacts. The HPMO \nand  MSCs  will  refine  the  PPMS  framework,  confirm  achievable  goals,  firm  up  monitoring  and \nreporting  arrangements,  and  establish  systems  and  procedures  no  later  than  6  months  after \nloan effectiveness. \n \n56. \nUnder the PPMS framework, baseline and progress data will be reported at the requisite \ntime intervals by each MSC, which will be responsible for analyzing and consolidating the data \nthrough  the  MSC  management  information  system.  The  PPMS  will  permit  flexibility  to  adopt \nremedial  action  regarding project design, schedules, activities, and development impacts. The \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 13\n\nHPMO, with the assistance of the consultants, will monitor and assess activities, and report to \nADB  quarterly  on  the  Project\u2019s  physical  implementation  and  financial  aspects  to  ensure  that \nimpacts are monitored and reported in line with ADB requirements.  \n \n\n  8. \n\nProject Reviews  \n\n \n57. \nRegular ADB review missions are envisaged, and a midterm review will be undertaken \nby ADB and the Government, 2 years after project implementation begins. The midterm review \nwill  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  resettlement, \nachievement of scheduled targets, and progress in policy reform and capacity building. MSCs\u2019 \nwastewater  tariffs  will  also  be  reviewed  in  detail.  Feedback  from  the  PPMS  activities  will  be \nanalyzed. \n\nG. \n\nProject Implementing Agencies  \n\n \n\n1. \n\nLegal Status and Corporate Structure  \n\n \n58. \nThree  MSC  have  been  established  under  the  Project  and  one  for  Chengde  will  be \nestablished before loan signing. Tangshan has had a suitably constituted MSC since 1997. It is \nregistered as a state-owned enterprise and operates under a board of directors in accordance \nwith the Company Law. The MSC has a business license and company charter, which defines \nthe scope of business and overall management arrangements. Zhangjiakou has recently set up \nan  MSC  modeled  after  the  Tangshan  MSC.  The  Zhangjiakou  MSC  is  responsible  for  the \nZhangjiakou and Xuanhua components, with separate subsidiaries responsible for subsequent \noperations  and  maintenance.  Zhangjiakou  has  no  previous  WWTP.  Baoding  has  also  recently \nset  up  an  MSC,  which  is  registered  as  an  institutional  entity  with  financial  autonomy  in \naccordance with the Provisional Regulation on Registration of Institutional Entities. In Baoding, \nwhich has two older WWTPs, responsibilities for wastewater management and the construction \nof  related  infrastructure  were  fragmented  across  a  number  of  agencies.  They  have  been \nrationalized,  and  a  single  MSC  has  been  created.  Chengde  has  no  previous WWTP and will \nestablish  an  MSC  modeled  after  the  Tangshan  MSC.  The  typical  MSC  corporate  structure  is \ngiven  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E.  Institutional  strengthening  is  essential  for  the  new \ncompanies and institutional entity to promote the Project\u2019s long-term sustainability, as well as to \nimprove  efficiency  and  service  delivery.  Appendix  10  describes  the  required  institutional \nstrengthening.    \n \n \n \n59. \nSince  most  MSCs  are  new,  they  do  not  have  an  established  financial  and operational \ntrack  record.  A  15-year  financial  projection,  based  on  the  volume  of  wastewater  to  be  treated \nand  proposed  tariffs  for  each  year,  shows  that  the  MSCs\u2019  financial  position  will  remain  sound \n(Appendix  11). Wastewater tariffs will be the main source of operating revenue. The provincial \ngovernment  has  committed  to  raise  tariffs  to  ensure  the  MSCs\u2019  financial  sustainability.  The \nMSCs\u2019  average  wastewater  tariff  rates  will  need  to  increase  by  a  factor  of  4\u20135  in  2003\u20132008. \nThese  rates  will  ensure  full  cost  recovery,  including  operation  and  maintenance,  interest \ncharges,  and  the  greater  of  depreciation  or  debt  repayment,  together  with  a  reasonable  profit \nmargin.  \n \nTo  ensure  MSCs\u2019  sound  financial  position,  the  provincial  government,  municipal \n60. \ngovernments, and MSCs have agreed to minimum levels of financial performance, which will be \nincluded as loan covenants and include capital structure (debt to equity), debt service coverage, \n\nFinancial Projections \n\n2. \n\n\f 14\n\nand  liquidity.  Periodic  tariff  reviews  will  be  required  to  overcome  the  risk  of  poor  financial \nperformance or unexpected changes in the MSCs\u2019 tariff income.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Impacts  \n\n61. \nThe Project will significantly help control water pollution in Hebei Province and the HRB. \nMunicipal  wastewater  treatment  is  a  key  element  in  controlling  point-source  water  pollution, \nwhich is the first step to meeting stream water quality standards for beneficial water uses. The \nservice  areas  of  the  project  cities  contain  the  major  industrial  wastewater  dischargers.  The \nProject will be flexible in imposing pretreatment requirements. The industries in the project cities \nonly pretreat discharge to municipal sewers rather than apply the more severe requirements for \ndischarge  to  rivers  and  lakes.  The  savings  to  industry,  through  avoidance  of  advanced \nwastewater  treatment  requirements,  will  support  sustainable  economic  growth,  promote  clean \ntechnologies, and water conservation. To ensure control of industrial wastewater, each project \ncity will prepare and submit industrial pollution control plans 14 to ADB through the HPMO.  \n \n62.  Wastewater interception, treatment, and disposal provide the best long-term prospect for \ncontrolling water pollution and improving water quality in the rivers and lakes in and downstream \nof  the  project  cities.  The  WWTPs,  which  will  use  the  same  treatment  processes  successfully \nused  in  other  treatment  plants,  will  be  cost-effective  and  reliable.15  These  WWTPs   have \nsufficient land to accommodate plant expansion until 2020. Sewer capacities to be installed will \naccommodate growth in wastewater flows until 2020, preventing the risk of sewage overflow in \nthe urban service areas. The previous domestic investments in existing overloaded WWTPs and \npartial  collection  of  wastewater  will  become  a  fruitful  rather  than  wasted  expenditure.  The \nProject will also improve land values along urban drainage ditches.  \n \nB. \n\nInstitutional Benefits  \n\n \n\nfor  project \n\nliaising  closely  with \n\nimplementation,  working  and \n\n63. \nEach  participating  city  will  be  provided  with  consultant  advisory  services  to  develop  an \nMSC that  will  (i)  be  properly  constituted,  and  managerially  and  financially  autonomous;  (ii)  be \nthe  various \nresponsible \ndepartments  and  agencies  of  local  government;  (iii)  assume  management  responsibility  for \nfuture operations and maintenance of project facilities, including responsibility for debt servicing; \nand  (iv)  assume  ownership  of  all  municipal  wastewater  assets,  including  all  permanent  works \nconstructed under the Project.  \n \n64. \nThe Project will also help each MSC establish a sound and solid financial management \nsystem at the beginning of project implementation. The financial management system will be in \nline with ADB's  Guidelines  for  Governance  and  Financial  Management  of  an  ADB  Investment \nProject. Each MSC will keep accounts in accordance with commercial accounting principles and \nbe subject to independent external audit by a qualified firm of commercial auditors. Accounting \nwill be in accordance with relevant PRC accounting standards, which are largely in accordance \nwith international norms (para. 53).  \n \n                                                 \n14  These  plans  will  also  provide  industries  with  technical  advice,  covering  adequate  treatment,  education,  and \n\nproposed improvements.  \n\n15 Treatment efficiency of the plants exceeds 90%. Influent quality ranges from 150 to 270 milligrams per liter (mg/l) \nfor biochemical oxygen demand, and from 200 to 300 mg/l for suspended solids, while effluent standards to be met \nare less than 30 mg/l for biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids.  \n\n\f \n\nC. \n \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nSocial Benefits \n\n \n\n 15\n\n2. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n \nThe Project will benefit 2.4 million people in the project cities by 2010 through improved \n65. \nenvironmental conditions and water quality of rivers and lakes. The service area encompasses \nthe  entire  urbanized  area  of  each  project  city.  All  the  downstream  benefits  of  improved  water \nquality  through  point-source  pollution  control  will  thus  be  achieved  upon  project  completion. \nDownstream  beneficiaries  will  also  include  coastal  areas  of  Bohai  Bay,  and  the  20  million \npeople  in  Beijing  and  Tianjin  City,  which  are  surrounded  by  Hebei  Province.  The  Project  will \nenhance  the  image  of  Hebei  as  a  progressive,  environmentally  aware  region  attractive  to \ninternational investors.  \n \n \n \n66. \nResettlement  impacts  have  been  identified  and  four  resettlement  plans  have  been \nprepared,  addressing  issues  related  to  entitlements  of  affected  persons.  These  resettlement \nplans  were  reviewed  and  refined  by  the  TA  consultants  and  ADB  staff  in  accordance  with  the \nADB  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement.  Resettlement  under  the  Project  includes  physical \nrelocation of 230 households or 736 persons; 25 shops or enterprises affecting 1,195 persons; \npermanent  land  acquisition  of  nearly  60  hectares  (ha),  affecting  664  persons;  and  temporary \nland  acquisition  of  171  hectares,  affecting  3,124  persons.  A  total  of  4,983  people  will  be \naffected.  The  main  cost  item  for  resettlement  is  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  which  is \nestimated at $22.3 million equivalent.  \n \n67. \nThe  resettlement  requirements  of  the  Project  are  relatively  small,  and  considering  the \ngood experiences in other urban projects and the strong commitment of the local authorities to \nthe safeguard policies, significant problems are unlikely to be encountered. The MSCs will fund \nthe resettlement costs according to the standards set out in the resettlement plans. Entitlements \nwill be provided to the affected persons before demolition and ground leveling, and before any \nloss of land. Following the domestic procedures, resettlement information has been released to \nthe  affected  persons  through  village  offices,  and  the  full  resettlement  plans  have  been  made \navailable at the village offices for affected persons. The summary resettlement plan (Appendix \n12)  was  included  in  the  summary  EIA  and  circulated  to  ADB\u2019s  Board  on  15  May  2002.  The \ncomposite resettlement plan covering four resettlement plans was made available on the ADB \nwebsite on 7 May 2002.16 \n \n68. \nThe  resettlement  plan  will  be  reviewed,  revised,  and  appropriately  modified  after  the \ndetailed engineering designs for each component have been finalized. Any revised resettlement \nplans  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  before  implementation. The HPMO, assisted by the \nMSCs, will be responsible for monitoring resettlement and submitting reports to ADB. A regular \nreporting system was established to ensure that key resettlement activities are implemented on \nschedule.  The  HPMO  will  engage  a  domestic  institute  to  independently  monitor  and  evaluate \nresettlement. One or two evaluation surveys will be conducted upon completion of resettlement, \nand the findings reported to the HPMO and ADB.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n16 http://www.adb.org/Documents/Resettlement_Plans/PRC/Hebei_wastewater \n\n\f 16\n\n3. \n\nPoverty Reduction \n\n \n \n69. \nA crude estimate of the extent of poverty in the project areas can be made based on the \nminimum  living  standard  scheme  established  in  the  ADB-assisted  urban  poverty  study:17 eight \npercent of beneficiaries are poor, and at least 200,000 beneficiaries live below the poverty line \nin the project cities. The Project will indirectly reduce poverty. The summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 13.  \n  \nThe Project will prevent closure of industries that cannot afford to meet severe treatment \n70. \nrequirements  for  discharge.  The  Project  will  also  create  skilled  and  unskilled  construction  jobs \nduring implementation. The Project will hire about 5,000 workers, mainly to build sewers and the \ncivil works. Men and women will have equal job opportunities; women working on construction \nare not uncommon in the PRC. \n \n71. \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  health  and  well-being  of  beneficiaries  as  water  pollution \npromotes waterborne diseases, to which the poor are susceptible because of their poor diet and \ninability to pay for adequate preventative and curative measures. Project benefits will extend to \nthe  residents  downstream  of  the  WWTPs  and  outside  the  project  cities  as  contamination  of \ndrinking water resources is reduced and water for irrigation improved.  \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Analysis  \n\n72. \nThe financial internal rate of return is estimated at 5\u20137% for the project components, or \nbetter than the 4% weighted average cost of capital in real terms. Tariff increases are required \nto ensure the financial sustainability of the MSCs. The financial evaluation is in Appendix 14.  \n \n73. \nThe sensitivity analyses tested the base case against a cost increase of 10%, revenue \nreduction of 10%, currency devaluation of 30%, and a delay in receiving revenue of 1 year. The \ntests  revealed  that  the  components  are  more  sensitive  to  changes  in  revenue  than  cost.  The \nsensitivity  analysis  also  examined  the  risk  that  certain  major  industries  might  not  pay  for  their \nportion  of  WWTP  capacity  and  associated  capacity  of  trunk  sewers,  due  either to unprofitable \noperations or factory closures. The iron and steel mill in Xuanhua is the most serious risk. If the \nmill  defaults  on  or  fails  to  pay  wastewater  tariffs,  the  Zhangjiakou  municipal  government  will \nhave to take over the mill\u2019s portion of  annual loan repayment. The municipality has the financial \nresources to do so and has provided assurances that it will if needed. Financial records of large \nindustries  in  the  project  cities  and  interviews  with  representatives  of  industries  establish  that \nthey can expect to be profitable and that the risk of closure is small.  \n \n74. \nAn affordability analysis has been undertaken, based on proposed tariffs and household \nincome  data  from  a  social  survey.  Tariffs  under  the  Project  are  assumed  affordable  if  the \ncombined average water and wastewater charges are less than 5% of household income. In all \nthe project cities, the estimated tariffs are affordable by the average household and the poorest \n10%  of  households.  The  affordability  analysis  is  in  Appendix  14.  The  proposed  tariffs  are \ncomfortably within the affordability limit in all the project cities. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB. 1999.  Technical Assistance for the People\u2019s Republic of China for Urban Poverty Study. Manila. This TA was \ncompleted in December 2001. In the study repot, the minimum living standard for Hebei Province is established at \nCNY2,509 or $478 per capita per year.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 17\n\nE. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n75. \nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  is  not  based  on  standard  benefit-cost analysis, \nsince it would not reveal the real economic justification for the Project. The project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) feasibility study for the Project did attempt a benefit-cost analysis, \nbut with economic internal rates of return of 12\u201324%. The main motivation for the Project comes \nfrom  a  thorough  sector  analysis  of  the  HRPPCP,  which  identified  and  prioritized  future  sector \ndevelopments. Since the Project aims to help meet the sector development goals, an analysis of \nthe  project  components  as  independent  subprojects  will  not  establish  the  real  and  intended \neconomic basis for the Project. The economic analysis of the Project therefore focused on the \nsector  development  plan,  the  role  of  the  Project  in  it,  and  on  the  goals\u2014targets  for  surface-\nwater  quality\u2014to  determine  whether  they  are  reasonable  and  will  command  public  support.  In \nthis  case,  a  least-cost  analysis  is  appropriate:  that  is,  the  Project  will  help  the  provincial \ngovernment attain sound and clearly established social goals at least cost. Taking the goals as \ngiven,  the  economic  analysis  showed  that  the  Project  is  designed  to  meet  them  at  least \neconomic cost.  \n  \n76. \nAmple  evidence  exists  that  the  public  supports  water  quality  targets,  but  scientific \nuncertainties limit the assurance that targets will be met. Still, the economic analysis shows that \nthe  project  will  minimize  the  cost  of  wastewater  management,  not  only  at  the  treatment  plants \nbut  also  across  the  cities  they  serve.  The  Project  will  achieve  least-cost  wastewater \nmanagement  beyond  the  plant  site  by  including  all  significant  point  sources  in  each  plant\u2019s \nservice  territory,  and  by  charging  a  wastewater  treatment  tariff  that  will  provide  financial \nincentives  to  equalize  the  marginal  costs  of  wastewater  management.  Appendix 15  discusses \nthe economic analysis.18 \n \nF. \n\nEnvironmental Benefits \n\nIn accordance with the Environmental Protection Law and Guidelines for Environmental \n77. \nProtection Management of Construction Projects, EIA outlines and reports have been prepared \nfor each project component. The summary EIA for the whole Project and the EIAs for Baoding, \nChengde,  and  Zhangjiakou  have  been  reviewed  by  the  State  Environmental  Protection \nAdministration,  while  the  EIA  for  Tangshan  has  been  reviewed  and  approved  by  the  Hebei \nEnvironmental  Protection  Bureau.  The  summary  EIA  for  the  Project  was  circulated  to  ADB\u2019s \nBoard on 24 May 2002, and posted on the ADB website on 7 June 2002.19  \n \nThe Project will substantially improve the urban environment and surface-water quality in \n78. \nrivers,  impoundments,  and  Bohai  Bay.  With  the  planned  mitigation  measures  in  place,  the \nProject  will  have  insignificant  adverse  environmental  impacts,  improve  the  living  environment, \nand contribute appreciably to the Hai River Basin\u2019s water pollution control program. The Project \nwill  safeguard  the  quality  of  water  supply  sources  of  Beijing  and  Tianjin,  help  raise  living \nstandards, and improve public health conditions. The Project is important to the provincial water \npollution  control  plan.  Appendix  16  summarizes  the  environmental  impacts,  mitigation \nmeasures, and monitoring plans. \n  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n18  A  detailed  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  is  presented  in  the  ADB  2002  EDR  Technical  Note  #4:  Economic \nIssues in the Design and Analysis of a Wastewater Treatment Project, which analyzes the Project as a case study. \n\n19 http://www.adb.org/Documents/Environment/PRC/hebei_wastewater \n\n\f 18\n\nG. \n\nProject Risks \n\n79. \nPotential institutional, financial, and policy risks related to the Project include the failure \nof  (i)  project  cities  to  implement  institutional  reforms;  (ii)  project  cities  and  MSCs  to  generate \npublic  support  for  higher  wastewater  tariffs  to  meet  cost  recovery  targets;  (iii)  project  cities  to \nmeet  the  cash  and/or  equity  transfer  required  to  construct  the  Project;  and  (iv)  municipal \nenvironmental  protection  bureaus  to  prepare  and  enforce  industrial  pollution  control  plans, \naffecting  the  ability  of  MSCs  to  meet  treatment  standards.  Other  risks  include  unforeseen \nconstruction difficulties and inadequate project management.  \n \n80. \nThese risks have been mitigated by (i) project cities\u2019 assurances on the MSCs\u2019 financial \nand  managerial  autonomy  and  institutional  strengthening,  (ii)  regular  tariff  reviews  and \nadjustments  by  the  government  following  national  guidelines,  (iii)  provision  of  counterpart \nfunding,  and  (iv)  experience  of  the  HPMO  in  preparing  city-wide pollution control plans. ADB \nreview missions will monitor compliance with the financial and operational covenants to ensure \nMSC  financial  sustainability.  The  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks  based  on \nthorough  investigations,  which  minimize  the  risk  of  unforeseen  construction  conditions. \nExperienced domestic and international consultants will give implementation advice and support \nto mitigate specific construction and other implementation risks. The project leading group in the \nHPG, headed by a provincial vice governor, and the HPMO, which has experience in oversight \nof a large internationally funded project, will mitigate project management risk. \n\n \n\nH. \n\nOverall Assessment \n\nThe  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  of  the  Project  will  outweigh  the  costs,  and  it  is \n\n81. \nrobust enough to be beneficial despite potential risks. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government,  HPG,  and  MSCs  have  given \n\n82. \nthe following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\nThe Government, through the HPG and municipal governments, will ensure that \n(a)  all  local  and  foreign  currency  counterpart  financing  for  the  Project,  including \nequity  contributions  and  cash  advances,  is  provided  on  time;  and  (b)  additional \ncounterpart funding is provided for any shortfall of funds or cost overruns. \n\nThe  HPG  will  cause  each  municipal  government  to  (a)  review  and  revise  local \nregulations  on  management  of  the  local  wastewater  systems  by  2003,  and  (b) \nforward  the  review  and  revision  summaries  to  ADB  within  3  months  of \ncompletion. \n\nThe  HPG  will  cause  each  municipal  government  to  (a)  prepare  an  industrial \npollution  control  plan  covering \nrelevant  monitoring  and  enforcement \narrangements, and (b) submit a summary of the plan to ADB by June 2004. \n\nThe HPG will cause each municipal government to ensure that (a) the MSC will \nhave  financial  and  managerial  autonomy  and  be  entitled  to  receive  all  monies \ncollected  from  levying  of  the  approved  wastewater  tariff,  (b)  the  MSC  board  of \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 19\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\ndirectors  or  its  governing  body  operates  effectively  and  fully  discharges  its \nsupervisory  and  management  responsibilities,  and  (c)  each  MSC  will  appoint \nexternal  auditors  qualified  to  undertake  company  audits  in  the  PRC  and \nacceptable to ADB.  \n\nEach  MSC  will,  from  commencing  commercial  operation  of  the  project  facilities, \nmaintain  a  minimum  debt  service  ratio  of  1.2:1;  maximum  debt-equity  ratio  of \n70:30; and minimum current ratio of 2:1 or quick ratio of 1:1. \n\nThe  HPG  will  ensure  that  (a)  each  municipal  government  participating  in  the \nProject  reviews  wastewater  tariffs  annually;  (b)  tariffs  are  determined  in \naccordance  with  project  financing  needs  and  the  need  to  maintain  MSCs\u2019 \nfinancial  autonomy,  subject  to  compliance  with  laws  and  regulations;  and  (c) \nsummaries  of  these  reviews  will  be  forwarded  to  ADB  within  3  months  of \ncompletion. \n\nThe HPG and each MSC will ensure that (a) the resettlement plan, including land \nacquisition,  is  carried  out  promptly  and  efficiently,  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s \nLand  Administration  Law  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement;  (b)  all \naffected  people  are  consulted  on  the  entitlements  at  least  4  months  before \nground  clearing;  (c)  sufficient  budget  is  available  and  affected  persons  are \ncompensated  on  time;  (d)  those  affected  are  at  least  as  well-off  as  they  were \nbefore  resettlement;  (e)  resettlement  is  monitored  and  evaluated  by  a  domestic \ninstitute, and results reported to ADB; and (f) a baseline survey is carried out as \nrequired in the resettlement plan. \n\n(viii)  The HPG and each MSC will keep ADB informed of the progress of resettlement \n\nactivities through regular reporting as specified in the resettlement plan. \n\nThe  HPG  will  cause  each  municipal  government  to  review  the  impact  of \nincreased  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  on  the  poor  and  introduce  appropriate \nmeasures to protect the basic living standards of the urban poor. \n\nThe  HPG  and  each  MSC  will  ensure  that  (a)  the  Project  is  constructed  and \noperated  in  accordance  with  environmental  procedures  and  guidelines  of  the \nGovernment  and  ADB;  (b)  any  adverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from  the \nthe  mitigation  measures  and \nProject  are  minimized  by \nenvironmental  monitoring  program  presented \nthe \nimplementation  of  the  environmental  monitoring  program,  including  mitigation \nmeasures, and copies of permits, licenses, and clearances, is regularly reported \nto ADB as specified in the EIA, including violations of safety and environmental \nstandards and their correction. \n\nthe  EIA;  and  (c) \n\nimplementing \n\nin \n\n \nB. \n\nCondition for Disbursement \n\n83.

\ncoordinate basin-level activities to manage surface-water quality, evaluate implementation of the \nplans, and assess progress in managing water quality. \n \nIn  addition  to  the  Hai  River  Basin  (HRB),  the  sectoral  analysis  also  focuses  on  Hebei \n2. \nProvince. The HRB is the sectoral analysis' focus, but Hebei Province plays a major role in the \npolitical and administrative control in the basin, and has the largest impact on the basin. Of the \nfour  provinces  that  intersect  the  HRB,  Hebei  is  the  only  one  that  lies  entirely  within  the  basin, \nand  all  the  HRB's  main  river  systems  flow  through  Hebei.  It  covers  approximately  60%  of  the \nbasin and contains about 55% of the basin's population.   \n \nB. \n \n3. \nHRB  water  quality  is  managed  through  legally  established  targets  for  water  quality, \nwhich has five classes plus a residual class for water bodies with quality below the lowest class. \nTable A2.1 shows that water quality has been improving since 1995 in Hebei and the HRB.1 In \ngeneral, the overall water quality improvement in the river basin can be  attributed to completed \nprojects  under  the  Hai  River  Pollution  Control  and  Prevention  Plan  (HRPPCP),  and  to  the \nclosure  of  polluting  enterprises.  Both  have  helped  reduce  discharge  of  chemical  oxygen \ndemand in the HRB.  \n\nPerformance Indicators \n\n \nTable A2.1: Control Sections Meeting Surface -Water Quality Standards: \nHebei Province and Hai River Basin \n \n\n \nItem \n\n \n\nYear \n\nClasses below Target \n\n1 \n\n2  \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\nBetter \nthan \nTarget \n0 \n19 \n0 \n27 \n\nZero (on \ntarget) \n\n \n\nHebei Province \n \nHai River Basin  \n \nSource:  ADB.  1999.

The  1996  Water  Pollution  and  Prevention  Law  authorized  setting  national \nstandards  for  surface-water  quality  and  using  these  standards  to  set  targets  for  individual \nwatercourses. The law empowers the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) to \ndefine technical standards at a national level. \n \n6. \nThe  standards  of  surface  water  quality  are  set  according  to  the  intended  use  of  the \nwater. Classes I, II, and III apply to surface water for drinking. Classes IV and V are for surface \nwater for irrigation or industry. Each class is defined by 30 criteria, prescribing numeric ranges \nfor  the  physical,  chemical,  and  biological  properties  of  water  (such  as  temperature,  pH,  and \ncoliform counts). Once SEPA defined the water quality classes, the desired or targeted ambient \nwater  quality  was  determined  for  each  river  reach.  SEPA  set  the  desired  or  targeted  ambient \nwater quality for some strategic river reaches but, more generally, the environmental protection \ndepartment at either the municipal or provincial level set the targeted water quality class. \n \n7. \nThe plan attain water quality standards in Hebei derives largely from the HRPCPP. After \nSEPA  approved  the  plan  in  1999,  all  the  provinces  and  provincial  cities  in  the  HRB  obtained \nSEPA  endorsement  of  a  pollution-control  plan  for  that  part  of  the  HRB  within  their  jurisdiction. \nThe  Hebei  provincial  government  issued  its  HRPCPP  in  July  2000.    Each  municipality  has \nprepared subordinate local plans. \n \n8. \nThe  HRPCPP  does  not,  by  itself,  provide  a  feasible  plan  to  meet  the  basin\u2019s  water \nquality targets since it merely identified potential projects without prioritizing them. To help refine \nthe HRPCPP, ADB funded the development of a refined strategic plan, which was completed in \nDecember 1999. The results of the study included the Immediate Implementation Plan (IIP) and \nthe  Strategic  Basin  Management  Plan  (SBMP).  The  IIP  was  developed  by  assessing  and \nprioritizing  the  HRPPCP  projects,  resulting  in  86  priority  projects.  The  four  project  cities  and \ncomponents were included in the IIP. The SBMP addressed the need for a long-term optimum \nstrategy  that  includes  monitoring  and  management  information  systems,  strengthening  of \nregulations and river basin planning and management, identification and implementation of that \nstrategy, and monitoring and review of that strategy.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nEvaluation of Current Framework, and Needed Reforms \n\nD. \n \n9. \nThe People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s approach to managing water quality, based on targets \nfor  ambient  water  quality,  is  an  approach  used  widely  and  effectively  around  the  world.  Like \nother  comprehensive  approaches  to  managing  water  quality,  ambient  standards  require \nadvanced  scientific,  engineering,  and  administrative  expertise.  The  HRB  management  system \nstill lacks this as it is still in the early stages of development, although proceeding at a pace at or \nabove that in other countries. \n \n\n10.  Meeting the water quality targets requires a system to manage and control all significant \nemissions.  Such  a  system  involves  at  least  three  elements:  emission  permits,  monitoring  of \nemissions  and  ambient  water  quality,  and  enforcement  of  permit  violations.  Each  of  these \nelements is a part of the HRPCPP, or is being developed.  \n\nE. \n\nNeed for the Project \n\nHebei's  surface-water  quality  has  suffered  due  to  large  quantities  of  untreated  urban \n11. \nwastewater  discharged  into  receiving  waters,  and  insufficient  wastewater  treatment  facilities. \nHebei has committed to control water pollution in support of the HRPCPP.  \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n \n12. \nThe  Project  will  add  about  197  million  cubic  meters  per  year  of  treatment  capacity,  or \nabout 50% of the total treatment capacity in Hebei. In combination with other projects and the \nexisting  wastewater  treatment  plants,  at  least  75%  of  municipal  wastewater  will  be  treated  by \n2010, which will significantly improve surface-water quality. The Project will also help strengthen \nthe  institutional  capacity  for  basin-wide  wastewater  management  through  policy  reform  and \ninstitutional capacity building. \n \nF. \n \n13. \nADB\u2019s agenda for policy dialogue in the wastewater sector covers (i) basin-wide pollution \nprevention  and  control,  (ii)  industrial  and  municipal  wastewater  management,  (iii)  enterprise \nreform  and  corporate  governance,  (iv)  cost  recovery  and  tariff  reform,  and  (v)  private  sector \nparticipation. To promote public support for the Project, the provincial government has prepared \na  brief  policy  statement  addressing  investments,  service  coverage,  tariffs,  institutional \nresponsibilities, and industrial pollution control and monitoring (Supplementary Appendix A).    \n \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f1436  Environmental Impact Assessment and Training \n1464  Management of

The  financial  projections \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  financial  projections  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Guidelines  for  the \n1.  \nFinancial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  the  ADB  and \nFramework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  financial  performance  of  operational  municipal \nsewerage  companies  (MSCs)  has  been  evaluated  and  projections  made  with  and  without  the \nProject.  Where MSCs need to be formed, an opening balance statement has been created and \nprojections  made  from  it  with  and  without  the  Project.  A  sensitivity  analysis  has  also  been \nundertaken  using  five  key  variables:  increase  in  capital  costs,  increase  in  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) costs, decrease in revenue, currency devaluation, and benefits delayed by \n1  year.  The  results  show  that  these  variables  will  not  jeopardize  the  viability  of  the  Project. \nFurther details of the financial projections are in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \nB. \n \n2.  \nwere calculated for 15 years (2003\u20132017) using current prices. \n \nC. \n \n3.  \nDirect O&M costs include repairs and maintenance, personnel, energy costs, chemicals, \nadministration, and other expenses. Total direct O&M costs have been estimated in the project \npreparation  technical  assistance  feasibility  studies  and  compared  to  the  actual  operating \nexperience of the existing Tangshan wastewater treatment plant and other similar plants in the \nPeople's Republic of China (PRC). On this basis, the major items and their proportion of direct \nO&M  costs  are  repairs  and  maintenance  (37%),  wages  (16%),  energy  (16%),  chemicals  (2\u2013\n10%), and administration (16%).  These proportions are considered reasonable.    \n \n4. \nDepreciation  is  calculated  using  the  straight-line  method  and  is  based  on  5%  of  the \nhistorical cost of fixed assets (for new assets) and 2% for existing assets to be transferred from \nthe municipal government departments. \n \nD. \n \n5. \nRevenue  from  wastewater  tariffs  has  been  calculated  by  multiplying  the  volume  of \nwastewater  treated  by  the  proposed  tariffs  for  each  year.  The  tariffs  will  be  increased  in  three \nsteps (2004, 2006, and 2008) to ensure that full cost recovery is achieved by 2008, the first year \nof operations. The proposed wastewater tariff in constant prices ranges from CNY0.97 per cubic \nmeter (m3) in Tangshan to CNY1.24 per m3 in Zhangjiakou in 2008.  Details of tariffs are shown \nin Appendix 14. \n\nRevenues \n\n \n Financial Projections and Assumptions of Municipal Sewerage Companies  \n\n1. \n\nProjected Financial Performance and Position  \n\n \nProjected  financial  performance  and  position  of  each  MSC  are  shown  in  Table  A11.1.   \n6. \nThe analysis shows that each MSC has sufficient funds to operate the assets to be provided by \nthe Project and to meet any debt service requirements. \n\nE. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n41 \n \n\nTable A11.1: Municipal Sewerage Company Financial Projections 2008:  \nSummary Results \nCurrent \nRatio    \n\nDebt-Equity \nRatio \n\n \n \nTown \nBaoding \nChengde \nTangshan \nZhangjiakou and/or Xuanhua \n\nDebt Service \nCoverage \nRatio \n2.1 \n1.4 \n1.4 \n3.4 \n\n3.6 \n2.0 \n3.1 \n4.9 \n\n0.5 \n0.7 \n0.5 \n0.4 \n\nReturn on Net \nAssets  \n(%) \n8.6 \n3.0 \n4.3 \n7.0 \n\n       Source: Feasibility study and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Assumptions \n\n \nAnnual  revenue  until  2008  is  based  on  the  proposed  tariff  increases  and  estimates  of \n7.  \nwastewater  treatment  volume  less  commission  paid  to  the  collecting  agency,  including  the \nexisting  water  supply  company.1  Tariffs  are  assumed  to  stay  constant  in  real  terms  beyond \n2008.  Nonoperating  revenue  is  assumed  to  be  zero  for  Chengdu  and  Zhangjiakou  while \nBaoding  receives  funds  from  fertilizer  sales,  and  Tangshan  receives  funds  to  maintain  storm-\nwater  drainage.  Expenditures  for  the  existing  assets  are  expected  to  stay  the  same  in  real \nterms.  All  the  wastewater  treatment  plants  are  assumed  to  be  operating  at  full  capacity  from \n2010.  \n\n \n\n \n\n8. \nExisting wastewater assets are assumed to be transferred to the MSCs in 2008. Income \ncollection  efficiency  is  assumed  to  be  90%  consistent  with  other  well-managed  MSCs  in  the \nPRC.  The  arrears  collection  rate  is  assumed  to  be  50%.  Accounts  payable  represent  10%  of \noperating expenses.  \n\n9. \nLong-term  debt  includes  the  ADB  loan  (London  interbank  offered  rate  [LIBOR]-based \nloan) and domestic loans. The MSCs will be subject to a profit tax of 30%. Value-added tax is \n6% of revenue, the urban maintenance fee is 7% of value-added tax, and the education fee is \n3.5%  of  value-added  tax.  Long-term  investments  are  assumed  to  be  zero,  since  no  other \ninvestment plans for the next 5\u201310 years are sufficiently advanced to be assessed. \n \nFor Baoding, counterpart funding will come from a combination of municipal government \n10. \nequity contribution and domestic loans. Chengde will obtain counterpart funding from municipal \ngovernment  equity  contribution,  user  charges,  and  domestic  loans.  In  Tangshan,  equity  funds \nfrom the municipal government will be supplemented by user fees from the existing operations \nto provide all necessary counterpart funds. For Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua, the MSC is expected \nto  obtain  state  bonds  from  the  central  Government  to  cover  some  counterpart  funding \nrequirements, with the remainder coming from a municipal government equity contribution and \nuser charges. \n \nF. \n \n11. \nAn  equity  contribution  will  be  provided  by  the  central  Government  in  the  form  of  state \nbonds  to  Zhangjiakou  and  Xuanhua  during  construction.  For  all  other  cities,  the  municipal \ngovernments  are  expected  to  provide  direct  equity  funds  during  construction.    Therefore,  no \ndirect subsidies are being provided to the MSCs.  \n\nSubsidies  \n\n                                                 \n1 For efficiency of the collection, wastewater tariffs are normally surcharged to water supply tariffs. \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n0\n\ni\n\n \n\n4\n1\n\n \n\n\f4\n2\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n1\n \n\ni\n\n42 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN  \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nA. \n \nThis summary resettlement plan draws upon the composite plan, covering four detailed \n1. \nplans. The wastewater components in each of the four project cities involve land acquisition and \nresettlement  effects,  and  detailed  resettlement plans have been prepared in Chinese for each \ncity.  Resettlement  planning  takes  into  account  all  persons  affected.  The  selection  of  the \ntreatment plant sites and main wastewater pipeline routes was based on sitting and alignment \noptions  that  minimized  acquisition  of  cultivated  land,  temporary  land  use,  and  demolition  of \nhouses. The plans are based on preliminary design work and may be modified slightly after the \ndetailed engineering for each component has been finalized. \n \nB. \n \n2. \n \n\nThe Project will affect approximately 5,000 people: \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nphysical relocation of 230 residential households (736 people); \n25 shops, institutes, or enterprises affected (1,195 people); \npermanent  land  acquisition  of  60  hectares  (ha)\u2014on  average  a  10%  loss  for \naffected villages, and a complete loss of land for 664 people; and \ntemporary land acquisition of 171 ha\u2014on average a 5% loss for affected villages, \nand a partial loss of land for 3,124 people. \n\n \nZhangjiakou  will  have  the  greatest  permanent  effects  because  the  construction  of  the \n3. \nsewer network is also part of a road-widening project. Luojiafang village in Zhangjiakou will lose \n25%  of  its  land.  In  Baoding,  2,413  persons  will  lose  one  crop  on  account  of  temporary  land \nborrow. As relatively small parcels of land are being acquired in other villages, most households' \nlivelihoods will not suffer greatly. \n \nC. \n \nThe resettlement plans are based on policies and regulations relating to land acquisition \n4. \nand  resettlement  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  and  on  the  ADB\u2019s  policy  and \nguidelines on resettlement. The plans adopt the following principles: \n \n\nPolicy Framework \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nSelect a scheme that is feasible from an economic, engineering, environmental, \nand social point of view, and minimizes the need for resettlement and impact on \npeople. \nConsider local economic development plans, existing community situations, and \naffected persons\u2019 resettlement problems and concerns.  \nEnsure  that  the  livelihood  and  standard  of  living  of  affected  persons  are  not \naffected by the Project. \nEnsure that the resettlement plan conforms to the requirements of ADB\u2019s policy \nguidance  and  of  PRC  laws,  regulations,  and  policies  on  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. \nEnsure  that  compensation  fees  are  paid  by  the  municipal  sewerage  company \n(MSC) to the village committees and used to resettle affected people.   \n\n \n5. \nEntitlements and compensation rates are shown in Table A12.1. Payments will be made \nto  the  affected  persons  before  house  demolition  and  ground  leveling,  and  before  any  loss  of \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n43 \n \n\nin \n\nResettlement Budget and Financing \n\nlivestock  and  dairy  programs,  vegetable \n\nConsultation, Disclosure, Grievance, and Participation \n\nVillages affected by land acquisition will invest their land compensation and resettlement \nfarming,  and  small  enterprises. \n\nland.  Temporary  land  will  be  utilized  for  a  maximum  of  6  months  and  then  returned  to  the \naffected persons. Costs for restoration of  land  to  its  original  condition  have  been  incorporated \ninto compensation costs. \n \n6. \nsubsidy \nRehabilitation will include allocation of cultivable land to affected households. \n \nD. \n \n7. \nDuring  the  formulation  of  the  resettlement  plans,  consultations  were  held  with  the  city \ndistricts,  county  governments,  mass  organizations,  and  representatives  of  affected  villages. \nAffected  people  will  be  able  to  access  the  resettlement  plans  at  MSC  headquarters;  village \noffices  have  already  issued  a  resettlement information booklet covering resettlement policies, \nentitlements,  and  grievance  procedures.  Resettlement  and  compensation  will  be  further \nexplained to affected people. The final resettlement plan will be made available at village offices \nand encompass comments from the public. Grievances may be expressed verbally to the local \nvillage committee or more formally by letter to higher authorities at the county or municipal land \nmanagement bureau. \n \nE. \n \n8. \nThe  main  cost  item  for  resettlement  will  be  land  compensation.  The  total  cost  of  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  is  estimated  to  be  CNY184.3  million  or  $22.3  million.  The  MSCs \nwill fund the resettlement costs according to resettlement plan standards. \n \nF. \n \nThe  resettlement  plan  will  be  supervised  by  the  four  project  implementing  agencies. \n9. \nLand  acquisition,  house  demolition,  and  resettlement  progress  dovetail  with  the  project \nconstruction schedule and will be completed a month before project construction. \n \nG. \n \n10. \nDuring  implementation,  internal  monitoring  will  be  undertaken  every  6  months  by  the \nMSCs  and  other  organizations  involved  in  implementation.  After  resettlement,  the  MSCs  will \nmonitor  the  impacts  annually  for  1\u20132  years.  External  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be \nundertaken twice a year during implementation, and annual evaluation will be conducted for 1\u20132 \nyears  after  resettlement.

A poverty assessment has been prepared for the Project.  \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\nb. \nAnalysis: Findings of the poverty assessment can be summarized as follows: \n \n\u2022  The Project will benefit 2.4 million people in the project cities by 2010 through improved public health and better \n\nProposed Classification: Other \n\nenvironmental conditions in urban waterways. \n\n\u2022  Project  implementation  will  stabilize  or  reduce  industrial  unemployment  by  industries  ability  to  comply  with \n\nenvironmental regulations.  \n\n\u2022  Residents  downstream  from  the  wastewater  treatment  plants  and  outside  the  project  cities  will  benefit  through \n\nreduced contamination of potable water, and better water for industry, irrigation, and fisheries.  \n\n\u2022  Construction jobs will be available for skilled and unskilled labor. \n\u2022  The  combined  wastewater  and  water  supply  charge  is  proposed  to  be  no  greater  than  4%  of  the  income  of  the \n\npoorest 10% of households in each city.  \n\nResettlement \n\nc. \nFour project cities undergo land acquisition and resettlement, and detailed resettlement plans have been prepared in \nChinese for each city. Resettlement planning takes into account all persons affected. Selection of the treatment plant \nsites and main wastewater pipeline routes was based on options that minimized resettlement. The resettlement plans \nare based on preliminary design work. \nPotential Issues   \nd. \n\n \n \nSubject \nResettlement \n\nSignificant, Not \nSignificant, \nUncertain, None \n\nSignificant \n\nGender \n\nNot significant \n\nAffordability \n\nNot significant \n\nLabor \n\nNot significant \n\nNone \n\nNot significant \n\nIndigenous  \nPeople \nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities  \n \n\n \n\n \n \nOutput Prepared \n\nFull resettlement \nplans  \nYes (in social impact \nassessment) \nYes \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nResettlement plans will be prepared for each \nproject city. \nGender assessment is included as part of the social \nassessment.  \nNot deemed to be a concern, but it will be \nmonitored. \nNo labor retrenchments are envisaged as a result of \nthe project. \nNo indigenous people will be affected or impacted \nby the project. \nNo other social risks are anticipated as a result of \nthe Project. \n\nNone \n\nNone \n\nNone \n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n\nSocioeconomic Baseline of the Project Beneficiary Area \n\nB. \n \n2. \nHebei  Province  is  around  190,000  square  kilometers,  including  approximately  500 \nkilometers of coastline, and has 66.1 million people, of which 12 million live in urban areas. The \nprovince has Han, Hui, Manchu, Mongolian, and Korean ethnic minorities.  \n \n3. \n \n\nThe total population and population growth rates are shown in Table A13.2.  \n\nTable A13.2: Population and Growth Rates \n\n \nPrefecture \n\nTotal \nPopulation \n('000) \n66,140 \n10,500 \n3,530 \n6,940 \n4,440 \n\nUrban \nPopulation \n('000) \n12,550 \n1,560 \n660 \n1,890 \n1,040 \n\nAnnual Birth \nRate \n(per 1,000) \n12.99 \n9.16 \n10.67 \n9.22 \n9.47 \n\nHebei Province \nBaoding  \nChengde \nTangshan  \nZhangjiakou, including \nXuanhua \nNote:   Provincial figures are derived from sample surveys and are different from city figures based on registration \n\nNatural \nGrowth Rate \n(per 1,000) \n6.73 \n4.54 \n4.85 \n3.21 \n3.34 \n\nAnnual \nDeath Rate \n(per 1,000) \n6.26 \n4.62 \n5.82 \n6.01 \n6.13 \n\nof individuals.  \n\nSource: Hebei Economic Yearbook 2000, China Statistics Press. \n \nThe natural growth rate for the project cities appears low when compared with that of the \n4. \nprovince.  This  variation  may  be  attributed  to  discrepancies  between  the  two  sources  of  data, \nand  the  net  effect  of  the  unregistered  floating  population,  rural  migration  to  the  cities,  and \nnonregistration of second-born children in the cities. The natural growth rate in all areas is likely \ncloser to 6.7 per 1,000 people (being the total figure for the province derived from the sample \nsurvey method). \n \n5. \nAbout half the population in the province and the project cities is employed, with a larger \nportion engaged in primary industry (forestry, fishing, and agriculture) in Baoding and Chengde \nthan  in  the  other  cities.  Tangshan  has  more  people  employed  in  secondary  industry \n(manufacturing) than do the other project cities, perhaps because Tangshan is more industrially \ndeveloped.  The  agricultural  sector  is  the  main  employer,  and  most  people  depend  on  land  as \ntheir income base coupled with employment in secondary industry activities.

A  household  whose  income  is  below  the \nminimum  living  standard  is  eligible  to  receive  assistance  from  the  local  government.

ABD  has  recently \ncompleted  a  study  on  urban  poverty  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).1  The  study \nestablished  Hebei's  urban  poverty  line  at  CNY2,509  per  capita  per  year,  which  is  higher  than \nthat established by the local government.   \n \n9. \nA  socioeconomic  survey,  including  of  willingness  and  ability  to  pay,  was  conducted  for \n600 households during the feasibility study. The survey showed that people in all project cities \nare  willing  to  pay  an  average  maximum  of  CNY5.5  per  month  for  wastewater  collection  and \ntreatment.  The  survey  also  showed  that  at  least  8%  of  households  have  incomes  of  less  than \nCNY6,000  per  year.  As  at  least  3.4  people  make  up  the  average  lower-income  household, \nCNY6,000  per  year  per  household  (CNY1,765  per  capita)  would  put  the  household  below  the \npoverty line. Household surveys show, however, that Baoding had no households with incomes \nless than CNY6,000; Tangshan had only 3% in this category, and Chengde, 5%. The Boading \nand  Tangshan  MLSS  levels  are  slightly  higher  than  in  other  cities.  The  availability  of  this \nscheme may account for the difference in the reporting of lower household incomes through the \nsurvey. \n \n10. \nThe  poverty  line  established  through  the  MLSS  varies  among  cities  from  CNY1,800  to \nCNY2,340 per capita, which is lower than the CNY2,509 established by the PRC Urban Poverty \nStudy. The MLSS established by the study has been adopted for project poverty assessment. \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1999.

If at least 8% of \nbeneficiaries are poor, the Project will benefit at least 200,000 poor people.     \n \nC. \n \n11. \nThe  assessment  considered  (i)  portions  of  the  project  areas  where  the  poor  are \nconcentrated,  (ii)  proportion  of  the  project  beneficiaries  who  are  poor,  (iii)  project  benefits \ntargeted toward the poor, and (iv) project impact on the quality of life and well-being of the poor.  \n \n12. \nThe poor are interspersed within the broader group of project beneficiaries. To target the \npoor  would  be  seen  as  excluding  the  wider  community.  Wastewater  services  provided  by  the \nProject will be available to everyone.  \n \n13. \nThe  Project  will  indirectly  help  reduce  urban  poverty  by  preventing  the  closure  of \nindustries  that  cannot  afford  to  meet  treatment  requirements  for  discharge  into  rivers.  The \nProject will also indirectly improve the health and well-being of beneficiaries through improved \nlocal  environmental  conditions,  particularly  water  quality,  which  will  improve  urban  living \nconditions and environmental health.  \n \n14. \nProject  benefits\u2014reduced contamination of potable water supplies and better water for \nirrigation\u2014will  extend  to  the  residents  downstream  of  the  wastewater  treatment  plants  and \noutside the project cities. The gradual improvement in water quality and irrigation farmland and \nin  investment  opportunities  will  enhance  the  environment  and  make  the  area  attractive  to \ntourists.  \n \n15. \nThe  Project  will  create  construction  jobs  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  during \nimplementation, and hire about 5,000 workers over the 5-year construction period. They will be \nengaged mainly in building sewers and civil works for the wastewater treatment plants.  \n \nD. \n \n16. \nThe  project  cities  are  required  to  implement  cost  recovery  measures,  including \nincreasing wastewater tariffs. The combined wastewater and water supply charge is proposed \nto  be  no  greater  than  4%  of  the  income  of  the  poorest  10%  of  households  in  each  city.  Each \nproject city government will review the impact of increased water and wastewater tariffs on the \npoor and introduce poverty reduction policies to protect the basic living standards of the urban \npoor.  Women  will  have  an  equal  opportunity  to  work  on  construction.  A  health  education \nprogram will target women and children. \n \n\nMaximized Benefits for the Poor and Women \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n49 \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n\nIntroduction  \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis \n\nA. \n \nFinancial  analysis  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Guidelines  for  the  Financial \n1. \nGovernance and Management of Investment Projects Financed  by the ADB and Framework for \nthe  Economic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of  Urban  Development  Sector  Projects   of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). Details of the financial analysis are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe total project cost is estimated at $165.4 million, which includes base costs, financing \ncharges, and 10% physical contingencies on all items except land acquisition. Inflation over the \nconstruction period is estimated at 2.5% in the first year and then 4% thereafter for local costs \nand  2.4%  for  foreign  costs.  The  largest  individual  cost  component  is  for  infrastructure  works \n(construction  of  wastewater  treatment  plants  and  associated  pipe  networks),  which  represent \naround 79% of total costs.  \n \n3. \nDirect  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  include  repairs  and  maintenance, \npersonnel, energy, chemicals, administration, and other expenses. Total direct O&M costs have \nbeen  estimated  in  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  feasibility  studies  and \ncompared  to  the  actual  operating  experience  of  the  existing  Tangshan  wastewater  treatment \nplant and other similar plants in the People's Republic of China (PRC). On this bas is, the major \nitems  and  their  proportion  of  direct  O&M  costs  are  repairs  and  maintenance  (37%),  wages \n(16%),  energy  (16%),  chemicals  (2\u201310%),  and  administration  (16%).    These  proportions  are \nconsidered reasonable. \n \n The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the Project was calculated over a 25-year \n4. \nperiod  on  net  cash  flows.  The  base-case  FIRR  of  the  five  project  components  is  5.0\u20137.3%,  \nwhich  is  equal  to  or  above  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  in  real  terms.  The \nWACC  used  is  at  the  minimum  rate  test  level  of  4%  for  all  components,  as  the  calculated \nWACCs  were  below  this  level.  The  FIRRs  and  associated  sensitivity  tests  are  in  Table  A14.1. \nAll  components  are  financially  sustainable  with  positive  FIRRs  for  all  sensitivity  tests.    The \ncomponents are more sensitive to changes in revenues than changes in costs.  \n \n  It  is  important  to  note  that  even  with  the  devaluation  of  the  yuan  by  30%  against  the \n5. \ndollar,  components  still  show  a  positive  FIRR.  Risk  mitigation  measures  include  the  PPTA \nfeasibility  studies  that  identified  tradable  and  nontradable  components  to  ensure  that  foreign \nexchange requirements have not been overestimated.   \n \nC. \n \n6. \nWastewater tariffs to be set by the project cities must comply with PRC guidelines. For \nBaoding,  Chengde,  and  Zhangjiakou,  which  do  not  have  municipal  sewerage  companies \n(MSCs),  the  objective  is  to  introduce  wastewater  tariffs  during  construction.  These  will  likely \ndifferentiate  between  domestic  and  industrial  consumers.  Proposed  tariff  increases  have  been \nendorsed  by  the  Hebei  Provincial  Price  Bureau  and  agreed  to  by  each  project  city.  Full  cost \nrecovery  tariffs  for  these  cities  will  be  introduced  by  2008,  following  commissioning  of  the \ncompleted facilities.  The cities have committed to undertake an annual review of tariffs and to \nincrease them in 2004, 2006, and 2008. \n\nTariff Structure and Affordability \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nTable A14.1: Summary of the Financial Evaluation and Sensitivity Analyses  \n\nCurrency \nDevaluati\non \n \u201330% \n1.3 \n2.5 \n2.9 \n1.6 \n4.0 \n1.5 \n0.3 \n3.2 \n0.4 \n3.0 \n\n \n \nTown \n\nFIRR(%) \nand SI \n\nBase \nCase  \n\nCapital \nCost \n+10% \n\nO&M \nCost \n+10% \n\nRevenue  \n \n\u201310% \n\nRevenue \nDelay by \n 1 Year \n\nSwitching \nValue  \n(%) \n\n5.6 \n \n5.7 \n \n7.3 \n \n5.1 \n \n5.0 \n \n\n2.5 \n5.6 \n3.6 \n3.6 \n4.8 \n3.4 \n1.6 \n6.9 \n1.7 \n6.7 \n\n3.7 \n3.4 \n4.7 \n1.7 \n5.7 \n2.2 \n2.8 \n4.5 \n2.8 \n4.3 \n\n4.6 \n1.7 \n4.7 \n1.6 \n6.6 \n0.9 \n4.2 \n1.8 \n4.1 \n1.8 \n\nFIRR \nSI \nFIRR \nSI \nFIRR \nSI \nFIRR \nSI \nFIRR \nSI \n\nBaoding \n \nChengde \n \nTangshan \n \nZhangjiakou \n \nXuanhua \n \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, SI = sensitivity indicator.  \nSource: Feasibility study and staff estimates. \n \n7. \n  In Tangshan, the wastewater tariff has to be set at a full cost recovery level to comply \nwith World Bank loan covenants.

For  Baoding,  the  domestic  water  tariff  would  have  to  be \nincreased  by  128%;  for  Tangshan,  263%;  and  for  Zhangjiakou,  42%,  before  the  affordability \nthreshold for combined water and wastewater charges is breached. \n  \n10. \nAn  analysis  of  the  financial  situation  of  municipal  budgets  indicates  that  funds  are \nsufficient  to  meet  counterpart  contributions,  and  that  should  MSCs  default  on  loan  repayment, \nthey will be able to absorb the debt-servicing requirements without undue financial stress. \n \nD. \n \nIn the PRC, the policy on cost recovery and tariff setting is clear. Circular 11922 requires \n11. \na simple volume-based tariff and full cost recovery from user charges. New national guidelines \nfor wastewater tariffs are being developed with ADB assistance and will extend existing policies \nby providing a more comprehensive analysis of the situation in the PRC.  These new national \nguidelines will be considered by the cities when introducing new tariffs.  \n \n12. \n  After  commissioning  of  the  assets  to  be constructed under the Project, the MSCs will \nadopt  full  cost  recovery  tariffs  based  on  full  O&M  costs,  interest  on  loans,  the  greater  of \ndepreciation or principle repayments, and a reasonable profit margin. \n \n\nCost Recovery \n\n                                                 \n2  Jointly  developed  by  the  State  Development  Planning  Commission,  Ministry  of  Construction,  and  State \n\nEnvironmental Protection Administration, September 1999. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n\nBackground \n\nEvaluation of the Water Quality Targets \n\nA. \n \nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  is  not  based  on  standard  benefit-cost analysis, \n1. \nsince  it  imposes  an  unduly  restrictive  perspective  on  the  Project.  Benefit-cost analysis must \nconsider all social benefits and costs, covering the  entire project scope so that all other factors \nare  exogenous  to  the  analysis.  In  the  case  of  wastewater  treatment,  benefit-cost  analysis  is \nappropriate  where  a  regulatory  or  management  regime  is  not  in  place,  and  where  the  project \nintends to address simple  and  specific  water  pollution  problems:  for  example,  raw  wastewater \naffecting a single large water user downstream. The Project, in contrast, is a small part of the \ngreater  plan  to  manage  water  quality  in  the  basin,  so  an  analysis  focusing  only  on  the \nwastewater treatment plants would not reveal the full economic justification or motivation for the \nProject. \n \n2. \nThe  primary  aim  of  the  Project  is  to  help  Hebei  Province  meet  the  legally  established \nwater quality targets for the Hai River Basin. The economic analysis therefore focused first on \nthe  goals,  to  evaluate  whether  they  are  reasonable  and  command  public  support.  Taking  the \ngoals  as  given,  the  economic  analysis  considered  how  the  goals  can  be  met  at  the  least \neconomic cost. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe wastewater sector analysis in  Appendix  2  discusses  the  water  quality  targets  and \nlegal  framework.  The  water  quality  targets  could,  in  principle,  be  determined  by  benefit-cost \nanalysis;  if  so,  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  could  rest  on  the  benefit-cost  analysis \nconducted in support of the targets. However, they were not set using benefit-cost analysis but \ndetermined  through  a  consultative  process  within  government,  with  some  consultation  with \nexternal  stakeholders.  The  justification  for  the  targets  would  be  stronger  if  there  were  more \nevidence of public participation in water quality target setting. However, it is a technical process \nin  which  the  general  public  has  little  interest, and the targets as well as the method of setting \nthem are broadly consistent with best international practice. \n \n4. \nDespite  the  limited  public  participation  in  target  setting,  broad  public  support  is  evident \nfor  improving  environmental  quality  in  general  and  water  quality  in  particular.  The  survey \nconducted  for  the  Project  indicated  general  public  support  for  improved  water  quality.  In  the \nproject cities, 61% of survey respondents rated \u201ca clean environment and unpolluted rivers\u201d as \n\u201cmost  important,\u201d  and  installing  a  sewerage  system  was  the  number-one  priority  for  urban \nimprovement1.  The  analysis  of  other  recent  ADB-funded  projects  in  the  PRC  found  similar \nsupport for water quality management and environmental improvement. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe plan to meet the goals is embodied mainly in the Hai River Pollution Prevention and \nControl  Plan  (HRPCPP).  Development  of  a  water  quality  management  regime  has  many \ncomponents,  and  a  prioritization  process  considered  all  the  important  economic  factors  to \nestablish the highest priorities, which appear reasonable from an economic perspective.2 \n \n\nEvaluation of the Plan for Meeting the Water Quality Targets \n\n                                                 \n1  Main Report, Hebei Province Wastewater Management Project, August 2001.  \n2  Main Report, Hai River Basin Wastewater Management Project, December 1999.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n53 \n\nTable A15.1 shows that the components of the Project are among the highest priorities \n6. \nfor implementing the HRPCPP.3 Only the plant for Tangshan New District received a relatively \nlow  score.  The  Tangshan  treatment  plant  was  included  in  the  Project  because  of  significant \nchanges in Tangshan since the completion of the prioritization process. \n \n\nTable A15.1: Prioritizing Score for Wastewater Treatment Projects in Hebei Province  \n\nPlanning Zone \n\nMunicipality or Prefecture \n\nTreatment Plant \n\nScore \n\nDaqing  River \n \nLuan River \n \n \nYongding  River \n \n \n\nBaoding \nBaoding \nChengde \nChengde \nTangshan \nZhangjiakou \nZhangjiakou \nZhangjiakou \n\nBaoding City \nMancheng  County \nChengde City \nShuanluan \nNew District \nZhangjiakou City \nXuanhua \nZhangjiakou Pharm. \n\n40 \n36 \n44 \n44 \n36 \n42 \n42 \n39 \n\nNote: Only the highest and lowest priorities in each planning zone are shown. Components of the Project are shown \nin bold font.  \nSource:  ADB. 1999. Hai River Basin Wastewater Management and Pollution Control. Manila.  \n \n7. \nThe  treatment  plants  in  the  Project  are  therefore  an  integral  component  in  the  plan  to \nmeet the Hai River Basin\u2019s water quality targets. Economic analysis of the project components \nshows that they are designed to achieve least-cost management of wastewater. Three aspects \nin the design are crucial: (i) all significant point sources in the surrounding areas are controlled, \n(ii)  all  wastewater  generators  will  face  the  same  effluent  charge,  and  (iii)  the  charge  will \napproximate  the  marginal  cost  of  processing  wastewater  at  the  central  treatment  plant. \nAccording to standard economic theory, these are sufficient to provide economic incentives for \nleast-cost management of wastewater across all point sources.4 \n \nAlthough  not  expressed  in  monetary  terms,  clear  and  important  project  benefits  will \n8. \naccrue  to  project  cities  and  beyond.  Urban  residents  who  will  pay  the  wastewater  tariff  will \nbenefit  from  improved  environmental  quality.  The  wastewater  treatment  plants  (WWTPs)  will \nbenefit downstream surface-water users, although they are difficult to identify and the benefits \nhard to express in monetary terms.   \n \n9. \nThe main uncertainty in the economic analysis is predicting the impact of the WWTPs on \nambient  water  quality.  The  uncertainty  is  due  to  the  lack  of  scientific  information  on  the  link \nbetween  wastewater  treatment  and  water  quality,  which  cannot  be  modeled  adequately  under \nexisting  conditions.  Developing  the  needed  information  requires  a  comprehensive  plan  that \ntakes into account regulation of stream flows and the impact of nonpoint sources and is part of \nthe evolving plan to manage water quality. The authorities appear committed to carrying out the \nrequired long-term programs.  \n\n                                                 \n3  The table is an abbreviated version of the full list of priorities; for complete list of priorities, see tables 4.01-4.10 of \n\nthe volume III, Hai River Basin Wastewater Management and Control, December 1999.  \n\n4  Hanley, N., J. Shogren, and B. White (1997),  Environmental Economics in Theory and Practice, Oxford University \n\nPress. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n \n\nA. \n\nPotential Impacts \n\nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT  \n\n1. \nThe  Project's  environmental  impact  is  substantially  positive,  and  the  benefits  greatly \noutweigh  the  negative  impact.  The  Project  will  have  substantial  positive  impact  on  the  urban \nenvironment and surface-water quality in the associated rivers, impoundments, and Bohai Bay. \nWith  the  planned  mitigation  measures  in  place,  adverse  impact  on  the  physical  and  natural \nenvironment will be insignificant. The Project will improve the living environment of project area \nresidents  and  contribute  appreciably  to  the  Hai  River  Basin's  water  pollution  control  program. \nThe Project will (i) safeguard the quality of water supply sources of Beijing and Tianjin, (ii) help \nto create conditions to raise living standards, and (iii) improve public health conditions.  \n \nThe  potentially  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  short  term:  noise,  vibration,  air \n2. \npollution,  runoff,  safety  hazards,  disposal  of  debris,  and  localized  traffic  congestion  during \nconstruction. \n\nB. \n\nMitigation Measures \n\n3. \nAppropriate  mitigation  measures  have  been  incorporated  into  the  selection  of  locations \nfor  wastewater  treatment  plants  (WWTPs)  and  sewers,  and  into  the  comparison  of  system \nalternatives.  Each  of  the  five  subprojects  has  adopted  measures  to  minimize  hazards  or \nnuisance, including provision of buffer zones (200\u2013300 meters) and fences, noise and aerosol \nabatement, and contingency plans for accidental wastewater overflows or spills. Processes that \ncan  accommodate  shock  loads  from  industry  have  been  selected.  The  local  environmental \nprotection bureau (EPB) in each project city is preparing a plan to control hazardous materials in \nindustrial wastewater. \n \n4. \nThe  Hebei  provincial  government  and  municipal  sewerage  companies  (MSCs)  will \nensure  that  the  detailed  designs  of  WWTPs  adequately  address  potential  effluent  and  sludge \nreuse issues. Before startup of the WWTPs, measures will be completed to assure collection of \nwastewater  from  major  industrial  dischargers  and  local  tertiary  sewer  networks,  and \narrangements will be in place for sludge disposal in accordance with national regulations. Each \nmunicipal government will prepare an industrial pollution control plan in a format acceptable to \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  including  relevant  monitoring  and  enforcement \narrangements. These plans are to be submitted to ADB by 31 December 2003. \n \nEnvironmental  protection  measures  for  construction  are  required  as  part  of  the \n5. \nengineering  contracts.  Good  practices  such  as  dust  reduction,  provision  of  storm  runoff \ndetention ponds, controlled disposal of spoil material, and washing of truck tires before leaving \nthe construction site are some environmental protection measures to be adopted in the contract \nspecifications. Other stipulations will control construction activities that may produce short-term \nnoise,  vibration,  air  pollution,  muddy  runoff,  safety  hazards,  sewage  from  construction \npersonnel, solid wastes and debris, spoils, traffic congestion, and silt runoff. \n \nThe HPG, project cities, and MSCs will ensure that the project facilities are constructed, \n6. \noperated,  maintained,  and  monitored  in  conformance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations, \nincluding  national  and  local  regulations  and  standards  for  environmental  protection,  health, \nlabor,  and  occupational  safety.  These  include  carrying  out  the  environmental  mitigation  and \nmonitoring  measures  detailed  in  the  approved  environmental  impact  assessments (EIAs) and \nsummary EIA for the Project. \n \n7. \nPlans  for  public  involvement  during  construction  and  operation  have  been  developed, \nincluding  for  public  participation  in  monitoring  impacts  and  mitigation  measures;  evaluation  of \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 16 \n\n55 \n\nenvironmental,  economic,  and  social  impacts;  and  surveys  of  public  opinion  after  project \ncompletion.    The  plans  include  several  types  of  public  involvement:  site  visits,  workshops, \ninvestigation  of  specific  issues,  and  interviews.  The  plans  will  be  incorporated into the project \nconstruction and operation management plan. \n\nC. \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring  \n\n8. \nLocal  environmental  monitoring  stations  will  be  responsible  for  external  environmental \nmonitoring  during  construction  and  operation.  The  MSC  will  be  responsible  for  internal \nenvironmental  monitoring  during  operation.  Local  and  provincial  EPBs  will  be  responsible  for \nsupervising  the  monitoring.  The  MSCs  will  be  responsible  for  daily  routine  monitoring.  The \nenvironmental monitoring results during construction and operation will be submitted to the local \nEPB, Hebei Province Management Office (HPMO), and other responsible agencies. Local EPBs \nand  the  MSCs  will  be  responsible  for  supervising  implementation  of  the  monitoring  program \nand,  if  necessary,  will  decide  on  further  mitigation  actions  during  construction  and  operation. \nEach MSC is responsible for preparing and submitting annual environmental reports. \n \n9. \nEach  MSC  will  engage  an  adequate  number  of  full-time  personnel  and  sufficient \nresources to monitor the environmental monitoring program, under guidance of the relevant city \nEPB  and  Environmental  Monitoring  Center.  Monitoring  reports  will  be  provided  to  the  HPMO, \nwhich will coordinate the preparation of an annual environmental report in a format acceptable \nto  ADB.  These  annual  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB,  by  31  March  each  year,  until  project \nfacilities start commercial operation. \n\nD. \n\nWater Quality Monitoring Network \n\n10. \nThe locations and water quality parameters to be measured at water quality monitoring \nstations  will  be  selected  as  part  of  the  project  performance  monitoring  system,  to  quantify  the \nProject's  environmental  benefits.  For  each  urban  wastewater  service  area,  one  monitoring \nstation will be located on an urban waterway upstream from the WWTP to assure that much of \nthe  urban  wastewater  has  been  collected  and  intercepted  by  the  project  sewers.  A  second \nmonitoring  station  will  be  downstream  from  the  WWTP  to  quantify the improvements in water \nquality affecting downstream communities and water users within the Hai River Basin and Bohai \nBay.  Where suitable, the monitored locations will be selected to coincide with the existing 54 \nmonitoring control sections in Hebei, which are operated by national, provincial, municipal, and \ncounty EPBs.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 31 October 2002) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "        CNY1.00 \n             $1.00 \n", " \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "yuan (CNY) \n", "                  $0.1208      \n                  CNY8.2771 \n", "The  exchange  rate  of  the  renminbi  yuan  is  determined  under  a  floating  exchange  rate \n", "system.
