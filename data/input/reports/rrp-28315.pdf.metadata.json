The  inadequate  water  supply  and  sanitation\nsystems in these towns have adversely affected the quality of\nlife and health conditions of the people living in them.\n\nThe  five  provincial  towns  are  selected  from  among  seven\nremaining  provincial  towns  that  have  not  received  any\nexternal  assistance  in  water  supply  and  sanitation.  Two\ndistrict  towns  from  two  relatively  poor  provinces  are  included\nto  balance  the  support  to  economic  growth  and  the  need  to\nreach  the  poor.  Access  to  safe  water  supply  among  these\ntowns ranges from 18-55 percent among the provincial towns,\nand  from  4-9  percent  among  the  district  towns.  Similarly,\nseptic tank coverage among the provincial towns ranges from\n44-86  percent,  and  that  among  the  district  towns  from  6-20\npercent.  Lack  of  access  to  safe  water  supply  and  sanitation\nfacilities, combined with poor drainage systems, caused great\nhealth  risks  to  the  residents,  especially  the  poor,  who  often\nlive in flood-prone areas.\n\nThe Project will improve water supply and sanitation systems\nin  five  provinces  with  total  service  area  populations  of  about\n1.2  million  by  2010.  The  objectives  are  to  (i)  improve  the\nhealth  and  quality  of  life  of  the  people  living  in  the  project\ntowns  by  constructing  water  supply,  drainage,  and  sanitation\nfacilities,  and  providing  health  and  hygiene  education;  (ii)\nsupport  community  participation  by  developing  community-\nbased  sanitation  credit  schemes  for  sanitation  improvement;\nand (iii) improve the financial sustainability of the water supply\ncompanies (WSCs). The Project comprises four components:\n\nCommunity  Environmental  Sanitation  Improvement.  This\nincludes \nthe  public  health  awareness  program,  and\ncommunity  environmental  sanitation  improvement.  The  first\nprogram  aims  at  improving  the  communities\u2019  awareness  of\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n\fiii\n\nthe  relationships  between  water,  sanitation,  and  health,  and\nmotivating  households  to  connect  to  piped  water  supply  and\nconvert  to  pour  flush  toilets  with  septic  tanks;  the  second\nfocus  on  small-scale  environmental  sanitation\nprograms \nthe  main  construction\nimprovements  not  covered  by \ncontracts,  and  to  meet  demand  for  improvements  generated\narising from the first program.\n\ntransmission,  water \n\nWater  Supply.

The  PSC  will  be  supported  by  a\nprovincial  project  management  unit  (PPMU),  which  will  be\nresponsible  for  daily  implementation  activities.  The  Vietnam\nWomen\u2019s Union will be responsible for the management of the\nsanitation  credit  schemes  in  the  project  towns.  For  overall\nproject  coordination,  a  central  steering  committee  will  be\nestablished and will be supported by a project coordination unit\n(PCU).\n\nGoods and services financed by ADB under the Project will be\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for\nprocured \nProcurement. Civil  works  contracts  valued  at  more  than  $1.0\nmillion  will  be  awarded  following  international  competitive\nbidding  procedures  and  contracts  valued  at  or  below  $1.0\nmillion  will  be  awarded  following  local  competitive  bidding\nprocedures. Procurement of equipment and vehicles will follow\ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures  for  contracts\nvalued more than $500,000, international shopping procedures\nfor  contracts  valued  at  $500,000  or  less,  and  direct  purchase\nprocedures  for  contracts  valued  at  $100,000  or  less.  Where\nspecial  license  is  required  or  where  there  is  no  adequate\ncompetition,  supply  and  installation  contracts  valued  at  or\nbelow  $100,000  may  be  awarded  following  direct  purchase\nprocedures,  subject  to  approval  by  ADB  on  a  case  by  case\nbasis.

In  December  1999,  ADB  approved  technical\nassistance (TA)1 for the preparation of the Third Provincial Towns Water Supply and Sanitation\nProject.  ADB  missions2  visited  Viet  Nam  since  the  commencement  of  the  TA  in  May  2000,\nreviewed \nfeasibility  study  prepared  by  TA  consultants,  and  reached  an\nunderstanding  with  the  Government  on  the  scope,  cost  estimates,  and  financing  and\nimplementation  arrangements  of  the  proposed  Project.  This  report  is  based  on  the  findings  of\nADB missions, reports prepared by the TA consultants and other aid agencies, and discussions\nwith  central  and  provincial  government  agencies  and  international  and  bilateral  aid  agencies.\nThe project framework is presented in Appendix 1.\n\nthe  project \n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1. \n\nOverview\n\nViet Nam is the 12th most populous country in the world, with a total population of 76.3\n3.\nmillion in 1999, of which about 23 percent live in urban areas. The population is concentrated in\ntwo  large  river  deltas.  The  Mekong  River  Delta  is  the  most  populous  region,  with  16.1  million\npeople, or 21 percent of the total, followed by the Red River Delta, where Hanoi is located, with\na population of 14.8 million or 19 percent of the total. The population grew at an average annual\ngrowth rate of 1.7 percent during 1989-1999. The regional distribution of population varies from\n62  and  67  people  per  square  kilometer  (km2)  in  mountainous  provinces  in  the  north  and  the\ncentral highlands, respectively, to 408 and 1,180 people/km2 in the Mekong and the Red River\nDeltas, respectively, and 2,883 and 2,410 people/km2 in the major urban cities of Hanoi and Ho\nChi Minh City (HCMC), respectively. The majority (86 percent) of people are of Kinh ethnicity,\nwith  the  remaining  14  percent  representing  some  53  minority  ethnic  groups  including  Cham,\nKhmer,  Muong,  and  Thai.  The  main  ethnic  groups  in  the  south  (particularly  Mekong  Delta\nregion) are Cham and Khmer.\n\n4.\nViet  Nam\u2019s  health  indicators  compare  favorably  with  those  of  other  countries  at  a\ncomparable level of income. The average life expectancy is 67 years: 65 years for men and 70\n\n                  \n\n1  TA 3323-VIE: Third Provincial Towns Water Supply and Sanitation, for $1 million, approved on 3 December 1999.\n2  The Appraisal Mission comprised X. Ye, Senior Financial Analyst and Mission Leader, C. Wee, Senior Counsel, S.\nPrice, Senior Social Development Specialist, S. Bando, Programs Officer; A. Perdiguero, Project Economist; L. D.\nThang,  Project  Implementation  Officer  (VRM);  and  P.  Cooper,  Water  Supply  Engineer  and  Staff  Consultant.  The\nAgence  Francaise  de  Developpement  staff  of  P.  Lecrinier,  Charge  de  Mission,  J.  Pecresse,  Vietnam  Country\nOfficer, and Y. Bensaid, Engineer, also joined the Appraisal Mission.\n\n\f2\n\nyears for women. Maternal mortality is officially3 100 per 100,000 live births with infant mortality\nat  37  per  1,000  live  births.  Disparities  exist  between  geographical  regions,  with  the  central\nhighlands and northern mountainous regions having an infant mortality rate of 56 per 1,000 live\nbirths.  Child  malnutrition  is  very  high  at  39  percent  as  a  result  of  poor  nutritional  intake,  food\nshortages, and diarrhea caused by unsafe water and poor sanitation. Approximately 47 percent\nof  the  urban  population  and  less  than  20  percent  of  the  rural  population  have  access  to  safe\nwater  supply,  and  only  43  percent  and  15  percent  respectively  have  access  to  safe  excreta\ndisposal.  Even  those  with  access  to  the  facilities  may  not  use  them  properly  and  hygienically.\nCommon diseases include tuberculosis, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, and malaria. The\nmain  causes  of  infant  mortality  are  birth  asphyxia,  birth  trauma,  neonatal  tetanus,  pneumonia,\ncongenital diseases, acute respiratory infections, and malaria.\n\nVietnam\u2019s  per  capita  GDP  is  estimated  at  $401  for  2000.  While  the  poverty  ratios  in  the\n5.\ncountry  vary  substantially,  depending  on  the  methodologies  used  by  various  measuring  agencies,\npoverty  has  been  declining  significantly  over  the  past  decade.  The  estimated  poverty  ratios  in  the\nproject towns are: 13.4 percent for Rach Gia, 9.2 percent for Tay Ninh, 7.5 percent for Thu Dau\nMot,  10.4  percent  for  Tuy  Hoa,  20.7  percent  for  Chi  Thanh,  7.9  percent  for  La  Hai,  and  27.0\npercent  for  Phan  Rang.  The  measurement  of  poverty  based  on  a  poverty  line  has  its  limit,\nbecause  it  does  not  take  into  account  other  dimensions  of  poverty,  such  as  access  to  basic\nservices.\n\n6.\nIn  1999,  the  labor  force  was  estimated  at  37.8  million,  of  which  68  percent  were\nemployed in agriculture, 13 percent in industry and construction, and 19 percent in the service\nsector. The urban unemployment rate was 6.7 percent in 1999, compared with 26.8 percent in\nthe rural areas. With a high ratio of farmers to arable land, and about 1 million laborers entering\nthe  labor  market  every  year,  underemployment  is  common  and  is  estimated  as  high  as  57\npercent in rural areas. The excessive rural labor force relative to available productive assets in\nthe rural sector has led to a rapid rural-urban migration, which places increasing pressure on the\nurban infrastructure, causing deterioration of urban environment, exacerbation of urban poverty,\nand worsening of urban unemployment.\n\n2. \n\nClassification of Urban Centers\n\n7.\nThe urban population increased by about 5.5 million people during 1989-1999, with an\naverage annual increase of 3.6 percent. By 1999, the urban population reached 18 million and\naccounted  for  24  percent  of  the  total  population,  compared  with  19.4  percent  in  1989.  The\nGovernment estimates that the rate of urbanization will increase to 45 percent of the population\nby 2020. Urban centers in Viet Nam are divided into six classes (Table 1). Currently there are\nfour centrally governed cities, 61 provincial towns and 537 other urban townships.\n\n3. \n\nWater Supply\n\n8.\nUrban  water  supply  systems  are  unable  to  meet  the  demand  of  the  country\u2019s  growing\nurban  population  for  safe  drinking  water.  Estimates  indicate  that  only  around  150  of  the\ncountry\u2019s 600 urban centers have piped water supply systems, which serve some 47 percent of\nthe urban population. Service coverage has risen only slightly since 1990, from an estimated 44\npercent  of the urban  population.  Apart from piped water supply, many urban residents rely on\nuntreated  water  from  shallow  wells,  rainwater  collection,  streams,  canals,  or  ponds.  These\nsources (except for rainwater) are potentially subject to serious pollution and therefore present a\n\n3  The World Health Organization estimates that maternal mortality could be as high as 160/100,000 live births.\n\n                  \n\n\f3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nmajor  health  risk  to  the  urban  populations.  A  significant  proportion  of  the  urban  population\npurchase water for drinking and cooking from vendors at prices often 5-20 times existing tariffs\nfor public water supply. Average per capita water consumption in the larger urban centers varies\nfrom  50  to  180  liters  per  capita  per  day  (lpcd).  Shortages  of  water  and  intermittent  supply,\nusually  6-18  hours  per  day,  are  common  in  urban  areas,  although  exact  levels  are  difficult  to\nestablish because of poor metering systems.\n\nTable 1: Classification of Urban Centers\n\nClass\n\nType\n\nComment\n\nNational centers.

Da Nang is managed by\ncentral authorities.\n\nProvincial  cities.  Large-medium  size  towns,  which  play  an\nimportant  role  in  development  of  a  province  or  sector  in  a\nterritory. Population from 100,000 to 350,000.\n\nManaged by provincial authorities.\n\nProvincial  towns.  Small-medium  size  towns,  which  play  an\nimportant  role  in  development  of  a  province.  Population  from\n30,000 to 100,000.\n\nManaged by provincial authorities.\nIncludes Phan Rang, Rach Gia, Tay\nNinh, Thu Dau Mot, and Tuy Hoa.\n\nDistrict  towns.  Small  towns,  which  play  an  important  role  in\ndevelopment  of  a  district.  Population  from  4,000  to  30,000\npersons\n\nManaged by district authorities.\n\nOthers\n\nDistrict towns and clusters.\n\nIncludes  Chi  Thanh  and  La  Hai,\nwhich  are  managed  by  district\nauthorities.\n\n9.\nThe  physical  conditions  of  urban  water  supply  systems  are  generally  poor,  due  to\ninadequate  maintenance.  Many  water  treatment  plants,  even  those  built  recently,  suffer  from\ndesign and construction faults. Some urban centers have no treatment facilities and raw water is\npumped  directly  to  the  distribution  network,  with  suspended  solids,  iron,  or  high  levels  of\ncontamination.  The  water  supply  systems,  often  patched  up  or  expanded  using  a  variety  of\nincompatible  equipment  and  tools  from  local  sources,  are  of  poor  quality.  Water  supply\ncompanies (WSCs) are usually unable to meet the design and construction standards because\nof  lack  of  appropriate  equipment,  high  quality  materials,  management  skills,  and  financial\nresources. Maintenance is inadequate to maintain an appropriate level of service. As a result,\nexisting schemes are often difficult to operate, unreliable, and inefficient. Except for HCMC and\nHanoi,  the  quality  of  water  supplied  in  urban  areas  generally  fails  to  meet  the  World  Health\nOrganization  (WHO)  standards  or  requirements  of  the  drinking  water  quality  guidelines  of  the\nGovernment. Although meters are generally used in urban centers, the quality and accuracy are\nusually poor. Unaccounted for water (UFW) is reported at 32-54 percent of water produced.\n\n4. \n\nDrainage and Sanitation\n\n10.\nThe urban centers commonly discharge wastewater and storm water through combined\nsystems to nearby watercourses, usually without treatment. Large sections of these combined\nnetworks, constructed decades ago, need rehabilitation due to lack of maintenance. Flooding is\n\n\f4\n\ncommon  in  urban  centers  in  the  wake  of  heavy  rainfalls.  Silted  or  inadequate  drains  overflow\nduring storms, spreading excreta and garbage over the ground. Many drains were constructed\nwithout  adequate  grades  for  self-cleansing  and  there  are  often  no  design  provisions  for  odor\ncontrol or dry weather flow. There are few wastewater treatment plants, and untreated sewage\nand  industrial  wastewater  are  discharged  directly  into  water  bodies  and  streams  in  the\nsurrounding areas and pose high risks to aquatic ecosystems.\n\n11.\nEnvironmentally acceptable sanitation facilities in urban areas are generally unavailable.\nWhile  around  40  percent  of  households  in  provincial  towns  have  septic  tanks,  only  a  small\nportion of these septic tanks is connected to sewers or drains. In many urban areas, septic tank\neffluent  or  seepage  contaminates  the  groundwater  table  in  areas  where  water  from  wells  is\nwidely used for drinking. In general, households in district towns have fewer septic tanks than\nthose in provincial towns, and some even lack basic toilet facilities. Those without access to any\nsanitation facilities have no organized system of wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal,\nand use open ground, local drains, and watercourses for disposal of excreta and wastewater.\n\nAlthough most provincial and district towns have some form of solid waste facilities, the\n12.\ncoverage  is  low,  with  only  47  percent  collection.  As  a  result,  solid  waste  usually  is  burned  or\ndumped into lakes, ponds, streets, vacant land or in drainage systems. Most solid waste comes\nfrom domestic activities, with only 30 percent generated by industries. Collected solid waste is\ngenerally  brought  to  landfills.  Current  disposal  sites  in  urban  areas  are  not  properly  designed\nand do not operate as landfills but simply as dumpsites. Typically, the landfills are unlined with a\nhigh  risk  of  leakage  into  groundwater  aquifers.  No  city  or  town  in  Viet  Nam  has  adequate\nfacilities  for  disposing  of  hospital  and  toxic  wastes,  although  in  HCMC  ADB\u2019s  current\nEnvironmental Improvement Project4 will address such issues.\n\n5. \n\nSector Institutions\n\nSector responsibilities for urban water supply and sanitation involve both the central and\n13.\nprovincial  government  agencies.  The  central  Government  agencies  are  mainly  responsible  for\npolicymaking,  standards,  and  development.  Provincial  and  local  governments  are  mainly\nresponsible  for  construction,  supervision,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the\nfacilities,  although  they  are  becoming  more  active  in  development  in  response  to  the\nGovernment\u2019s decentralization initiatives.\n\n14.\nApart  from  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation,  the  Ministry  of  Construction  (MOC)  is\nmainly responsible for (i) urban and rural planning and policies; (ii) construction standards, rules\nand  regulations;  (iii)  technical  and  financial  guidelines  for  evaluating  construction  projects;  (iv)\nresearch,  and  (v)  human  resource  development  for  urban  infrastructure  investment  and\nmaintenance.  MOC  also  involves  in  monitoring  and  administering  major  urban  development\nprojects. MOC has a minister and four vice ministers, and includes 8 departments, 4 centers, 5\ninstitutes,  4  boards,  12  corporations,  20  companies,  2  universities,  5  colleges,  and  6  training\nschools.  MOC  established \nfor  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation\nDevelopment  Projects  in  1994  to  manage  externally  assisted  water  supply  and  sanitation\nprojects.\n\nthe  Management  Board \n\n15.\nAt  the  provincial  level,  provincial  people\u2019s  committees  (PPCs)  exercise  executive\nauthority  over  all  functions.  The  line  ministries  have  their  corresponding  departments  in  the\n\n4  Loan No. 1702-VIE: Ho Chi Minh  City Environmental Improvement Project, for $70 million, approved on 7 October \n\n                  \n\n1999.\n\n\f5\n\nstructure of the provincial government. PPCs make use of boards and committees to facilitate\ncross-sectoral  coordination.  The  administrative  responsibility  for  urban  water  supply  and\nsanitation  is  usually  assigned  to  the  department  of  construction,  which  then  delegates  the\nresponsibility  to  a  WSC,  and  that  for  drainage,  solid  waste,  and  sanitation  to  a  public  works\ncompany  (PWC).  In  some  cases,  WSCs  are  responsible  for  both  water  supply  and  sanitation.\nOther key organizations related to the sector include the\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nMinistry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  which  is  responsible  for  advising  the\nGovernment  on  investment  planning  and  the  utilization  of  externally  funded\nassistance and direct foreign investment;\n\nMinistry  of  Finance  (MOF),  which  prepares  and  administers  the  budget  and  is\nresponsible for the disbursement of externally funded projects;\n\n(iii)  Ministry  of  Science  Technology  and  the  Environment,  which  is  responsible  for\n\nenvironmental protection;\n\n(iv)  Ministry  of  Health,  which  is  responsible  for  promoting  environmental  health\n\neducation and for water quality testing;\n\nViet  Nam  Women\u2019s  Union  (VWU),  which  is  a  Government-funded  mass\norganization with central, provincial, and district level offices, and plays a major\nrole in community mobilization and health education; and\n\nViet Nam Water Supply and Sewerage Association, which is a non-government\nbusiness  and  professional  organization  established  in  1987  with  members  from\nWSCs and related companies and organizations; and is active in developing and\nundertaking training courses for WSCs.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n16.\nThe  Government\u2019s  development  framework  and  priorities  are  reflected  in  a  series  of\ndevelopment  plans,  policy  statements,  and  ministerial  decisions.  For  urban  rehabilitation  and\ndevelopment  programs,  the  Government  policy5  emphasizes  the  need  for  reducing  the  gaps\nbetween  urban  and  rural  areas  and  developing  and  modernizing  technical  and  social\ninfrastructure  to  attract  investment  and  improve  people\u2019s  living  standards.  The  development\ntargets  and  policies  for  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation  are  reflected  in  the  Government\u2019s\nOrientation  Plan  for  Development  of  Urban  Water  Supply  to  2020,  and  the  Draft  Orientation\nPlan for Urban Drainage Development to 2020. For water supply, the targets by 2010 are (i) 100\npercent coverage and 180 lpcd in Class 1 cities; (ii) 95 percent coverage and 150 lpcd in Class\n2 cities; (iii) 90 percent coverage and 120 lpcd in Class 3,4, and 5 towns; and (iv) 80 percent\ncoverage  and  80-100  lpcd  in  district  towns  and  clusters.  The  targets  for  drainage,  sewerage,\nand  urban  environmental  sanitation  are  to  (i)  improve  and  complete  urban  drainage  and\nsewerage  systems  to  ensure  a  minimum  of  80-90  percent  coverage  by  2020;  (ii)  require\nenterprises  to  have  on-site  treatment  for  toxic  liquid  waste;  (iii)  eliminate  pit  latrines  in  urban\nareas by 2005; (iv) provide waste collection systems that treat solid and liquid wastes; and (v)\ngradually rehabilitate and clean the canal systems.\n\n17.\nTo achieve these development targets, the Government emphasizes the importance of\ninstitutional reforms in the development of efficient and sustainable water and sanitation sectors.\nSpecifically,  the  orientation  plans  call  for  (i)  restructuring  MOC  to  refocus  its  functions  in\n\n5  The Prime Minister\u2019s Decision on Urban Master Planning Guidelines up to 2020, 23 January 1998.\n\n                  \n\n\f6\n\ndevelopment  planning,  sector  policy  formulation,  regulations,  training,  and  technology  transfer,\nand  terminating  its  direct  involvement  in  business  activities;  (ii)  clearly  defining  the  roles  and\nresponsibilities of various Government agencies involved in the water and sanitation sector and\nencouraging better cooperation among these sector agencies; (iii) making PPCs the responsible\nagencies for water supply, sanitation, and drainage development in the provinces; (iv) providing\nWSCs with training and capacity building on project implementation and O&M, and encouraging\nWSCs  to  become  self-financing  and    progressively  eliminate  subsidies;  (v)  creating  the  legal\nbasis for providing public urban services, with enhanced enforcement; (vi) promoting community\neducation  and  awareness,  particularly  on  drainage  and  sanitation  issues;  (vii)  mobilizing\nadditional  financial  resources;  (viii)  protecting  water  sources;  (ix)  upgrading  technology  and\nmaterials; and (x) developing human resources.\n\nReforms  in  the  water  supply  sector  were  initiated  in  1990  with  the  promulgation  of\n18.\nResolution  217,  which  delegated  the  authority  for  setting  water  tariffs  from  the  central\nGovernment  Pricing  Committee  to  PPCs.  It  also  reduced  Government  grants  to  small  WSCs\nand eliminated such grants to large ones. Wider range reforms in the state-owned enterprises\n(SOE) were introduced in 1995 with the enactment of the Law on State Enterprises (LSE). The\nmajor  objective  of  the  LSE  is  to  improve  performance  of  SOEs.  Apart  from  strengthening  the\nrole  of  PPCs  in  overseeing  the  operations  of  the  SOEs,  the  LSE  allows  SOEs  to  retain  all\ndepreciation  expenses  instead  of  submitting  them  to  the  Government.  This  is  of  particular\nimportance  to  WSCs.  Under  the  LSE,  WSCs  have  been  designated  as  state  public  service\nenterprises, which are defined as SOEs that produce, distribute, and supply public services in\naccordance with state social policies. In general, the financial and managerial autonomy of the\nstate  public  service  enterprises  is  limited.  For  example,  tariffs  must  be  approved  by  the\nsupervising PPC.\n\n19.\nComplementing  its  water  sector  policies,  the  Government  issued  a  strategy  for  the\ndevelopment  of  urban  drainage  in  November  1998,  which  aims  at  reducing  subsidies  to  the\nsector in the short term, and establishing financial mechanisms to ensure sustainability of urban\ndrainage  enterprises  in  the  long  term.  While  the  policy  objective  is  to  reduce  Government\nsubsidies by collecting sufficient drainage tariffs to cover O&M costs and an increasing share of\ncapital investment, the application of the policy in the project towns is still in its very early stage.\nThere  are  presently  no  charges  for  drainage  in  any  of  the  project  towns.  Following  the\nGovernment\u2019s  policy  on  cost  recovery  for  water  supply  and  sanitation,  MOC  and  the\nGovernment Pricing Committee issued guidelines on water supply and drainage tariffs in June\n1999,  recommending  that  the  water  tariff  cover  the  cost  of  water  production  and  the  resultant\ndrainage, and generate pretax income approved by the PPC. The drainage charge should be no\nlower  than  10  percent  of  the  total  water  production  cost.  The  decision  to  include  a  drainage\ncharge in the water tariff provides the means to recover the costs of drainage and wastewater\nmanagement.\n\n20.\nDespite the Government\u2019s policies and reform initiatives over the past 10 years to make\nWSCs  legally  distinct  and  financially  autonomous,  the  level  of  autonomy  for  WSCs,  and\nparticularly PWCs, remains limited. Government approval is required for key management and\noperating  decisions,  such  as  production  level,  staff  salaries  and  benefits,  capital  and  major\nmaintenance expenditures, and senior staff appointments. Provincial governments generally set\ntariffs for water supply and sanitation on the basis of the perceived affordability and willingness\nto pay by the households, institutions, and commercial and industrial establishments. The tariffs\nare insufficient for WSCs to recover full cost and provide adequate levels of service. As a result,\nWSCs are unable to expand the services to households unconnected to the piped water supply\n\n\f7\n\nsystems. Poor services in water supply also prevented industrial and commercial development,\nfor which quality and reliability of water supply are far more important than the tariff level.\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n21.\nExternal  assistance  has  been  a  major  source  of  funding  for  the  rehabilitation  and\ndevelopment  of  the  country\u2019s  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation.  Over  $800  million  has  been\nprovided in the last decade for improving water supply and sanitation in 59 cities and provincial\ntowns. Since 1993, ADB, a lead external funding agency in the sector, has approved three loans\ntotaling  $200  million  for  water  supply  and  sanitation.  The  first  loan,  approved  in  1993  for  the\nHCMC Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project6, aimed at providing safe and reliable\nwater supply, improved sanitation, sewerage, and drainage facilities in HCMC with institutional\nand management support. The subsequent two loans, approved in 1995 and 1997, respectively,\nwere  provided  for  improving  water  supply  and  sanitation  in  provincial  towns.7  The  first  one\u2019s\nobjectives are expanding the piped water supply and sanitation facilities, reducing water losses,\nstrengthening  the  institutional  capabilities  of  WSCs,  and  helping  to  implement  low-cost\nsanitation and community environmental health education programs. The second one is aimed\nat improving public health in the provincial towns, improving the urban environment, enhancing\npublic awareness of hygiene and sanitation, and restructuring and strengthening existing sector\ninstitutions.  ADB  also  funded  the  HCMC  Environmental  Improvement  Project  to  improve\ndrainage and solid waste in the city.8 Apart from the TAs for preparing these projects, ADB also\nprovided  several  advisory  TAs,9  whose  recommendations  have  been  accepted  by  the\nGovernment for developing the national water supply tariff guidelines, strengthening the WSCs,\nand enhancing community health awareness.\n\n22.\nIn  addition  to  ADB,  major  external  funding  agencies  active  in  the  sector  include  the\ngovernments  of  Australia,  Denmark,  Finland,  France,  and  Japan,  as  well  as  the  World  Bank.\nDetails of external assistance to the sector are presented in Appendix 2. Their major assistance\nis as follows:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nAustralia:  (a)  Five  Towns  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project,  1995-2000;  and\n(b)  the  feasibility  studies,  detailed  design,  preparation  of  contract  documents,\ntender  evaluation,  and  capacity  building  for  a  Da  Nang  water  supply  and\nsanitation project;\nDenmark: (a) water supply projects for Da Lat, Hon Gai, Cam Pha and Buon Ma\nThuot; (b) the national rural water supply strategy; (c) capacity building for sector\ninstitutions at the national level; (d) the Di An and Nam Binh Dung water supply\nprojects; and (e) rural water supply and sanitation projects in Dac Lac, Ha Tinh\nand Nghe An;\nFinland:  (a)  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  Hai  Phong  and  Hanoi  water  supply\ntechnical  assistance,\nsystems, \n\nincluding  master  plans, \n\nfeasibility  studies, \n\n                  \n\nNovember 1993.\n\n6  Loan 1273-VIE: Ho Chi Minh City Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project, for $65.0 million, approved on 29\n\n7  Loan  1361-VIE; Provincial Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project, for $66.0 million, approved on 17 August 1995;\nand  Loan  1514-VIE: Second Provincial Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project,  for  $69.0  million,  approved  on  27\nFebruary 1997.\n\n8  Loan 1702-VIE: Ho Chi Minh City Environmental Improvement Project, for $70.0 million, approved on 7 October 1999.\n9  TA  1998-VIE:  National Water Tariff Policy Study,  TA  1999-VIE: Institutional Strengthening of Ho Chi Minh City Water\nSupply Company, and TA 2000-VIE: Ho Chi Minh City Water Supply Mater Plan; each for $600,000, and all approved on\n29 November 1993. Additionally, TA 2375-VIE: Capacity Building for Provincial Water Supply and Sanitation Planning and\nManagement,  and  TA  No.  2376-VIE:  Community Environmental Health Improvements for the Provincial Towns,  for\n$700,000 and $500,000, respectively, were approved on 17 August 1995.\n\n\f8\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nimplementation and capacity building; and (b) technical assistance to the Hanoi\nWSC,  and  the  national  urban  water  supply  strategy,  and  the  national  urban\nsanitation strategy;\nFrance:  (a)  water  supply  projects  in  15  towns;  and  (b)  technical  assistance  for\ntraining of Hanoi WSC staff, and for Gia Lam training center in Hanoi;\nJapan:  (a)  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  water  supplies  in  small  to  medium\ntowns throughout Viet Nam; and (b) upgrading water supply services in Hanoi, a\nmaster plan for Hanoi sewerage, and a feasibility study for HCMC drainage and\nenvironmental sanitation; and\n\n(vi)  World  Bank:  (a)  water  supply  and  sanitation  projects  in  Hanoi,  Hai  Phong,  Da\nNang, and Hon Gai/Cam Pha; (b) an environmental sanitation project in HCMC;\nand  (c)  TA  for  strengthening  the  Management  Board  for  Water  Supply  and\nSanitation Development Projects, and a strategy for district towns water supply.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n23. Water  supply  and  sanitation  projects  assisted  by  external  funding  agencies  in  the\ncountry  have  generally  failed  to  follow  their  implementation  schedules.  This  reflects  partly  the\nrigidity of the centrally controlled decision making process and partly poor understanding of the\nGovernment  procedures  and  the  resultant  unrealistic  expectations.  The  three  ADB-assisted\nprojects in the sector have suffered from (i) delay in loan signing (the Second Provincial Towns\nWater Supply and Sanitation Project) (ii) delays in loan effectiveness (the HCMC Water Supply\nand  Sanitation  Rehabilitation  Project  and  the  Second  Provincial  Towns  Water  Supply  Project)\nand (iii) delays in contract awards and disbursements in all three ADB-assisted projects.\n\n24.\nThe  lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in  the  sector  point  to  the  need  for  a\ncontinued  policy  dialogue  on  delegation  of  more  authority  to  lower  level  government  agencies\nfor project implementation. Delays could be significantly reduced if PPCs have the authority to\napprove  project  designs,  bidding  documents,  bid  evaluation,  and  contract  awards  and\nvariations.  The  lessons  also  show  the  need  for  intensive  assistance  to  the  executing  and\nimplementing  agencies \nthe  early  stage  of\nimplementation. Delays could be minimized by advance actions to recruit project management\nand  engineering  design  consultants,  establish  a  project  implementation  and  management\nstructure,  and  prepare  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Early  and  systematic  training  in\nGovernment and ADB procedures for all project stakeholders including consultants, counterpart\nstaff, and representatives of community groups, will be essential to minimize delays.\n\nin  project  planning  and  management  at \n\nlearned \n\nPositive \n\nlessons  have  also  been \n\n25.\nthrough  ADB-assisted  TA  2376-VIE:\nCommunity  Environmental  Health  Improvements  for  the  Provincial  Towns.10  These  are  (i)\ncommunities must decide their own priorities and technology choices to suit their capacity and\nfinancial means; (ii) transparency in funds transfers from the project and local government to the\ncommunity  for  micro  activities  and  awareness  campaigns  is  essential  to  generate  community\nsupport and trust; (iii) VWU has the network, experience, and mandate to work effectively at the\ngrassroots level in environmental health improvement; (iv) community motivators must be paid\nas  an  incentive  to  carry  out  awareness  activities;  (v)  WSCs  must  be  involved  in  community\nactivities,  particularly  public  health  awareness,  early  in  the  project  as  they  have  valuable\ntechnical information needed by the communities; (vi) PPCs need to be involved in community\ndevelopment  activities  as  they  control  the  budget  and  approve  the  work  of  lower  levels\n\n10 for $500,000, approved on 17 August 1995.\n\n                  \n\n\f9\n\nagencies; and (vii) public health awareness activities need to coincide with the construction of\nmajor physical infrastructure.\n\nE. \n\nADB's Sector Strategy\n\n26.\nADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  for  Viet  Nam  is  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  vision  of\neconomic  modernization  and  poverty  reduction  by  making  economic  growth  and  the  structural\ntransition pro-poor and sustainable. To this end, ADB will focus its operations on three pillars:\npro-poor sustainable economic growth, social development, and good governance. In line with\nthis  overall  operational  strategy,  ADB\u2019s  strategy  in  the  urban  water  and  sanitation  sector,\ntherefore,  will  be  to  (i)  support  rehabilitation,  upgrading,  and  expansion  of  water  supply  and\nsanitation system in urban centers to improve the investment environment; (ii) ensure equitable\naccess to safe water supply and sanitation facilities and improve the health profile of the urban\nresidents; and (iii) encourage policy changes and institutional reforms at central and provincial\nlevels to enable sustainable development. The immediate sectoral objective of ADB is to make\nWSCs  financially  viable  with  adequate  cost  recovery.  In  the  medium  term,  ADB  seeks  full\nautonomy  of  WSCs  in  financial  and  operational  management,  and  the  establishment  of  a\nsuitable  regulatory  framework  for  the  sector.  The  long-term  objective  will  be  to  break  the\ndominance  of  SOEs  in  the  sector,  including  the  related  consulting  services  and  civil  works\ncontracting, by creating a conducive environment for private sector participation. Operationally,\nADB\u2019s  assistance  in  the  sector  will  gradually  shift  from  large  cities  to  provincial  towns,  and\nexpand from provincial towns to district towns, assisting the Government in improving the basic\nurban infrastructure to mitigate the social and economic pressure arising from significant rural-\nurban migration.\n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n27.\nPolicy dialogue with the Government has been carried out since the first ADB-assisted\nwater supply and sanitation project in the country in 1995. One important aspect of the dialogue\nrelates to the transition of WSCs from subsidized entities operating in a planned environment to\ncommercial  companies  operating  in  a  market  economy,  self-financing  capital  expansion  and\nO&M through user charges, and accountable to owners and consumers. The dialogue led to the\nGovernment\u2019s permission for WSCs to retain funds accumulated through depreciation that were\npreviously  submitted  to  the  PPCs.  The  dialogue,  and  ADB  assistance,  also  enabled  MOC  to\nissue  national  water  tariff  guidelines  based  on  the  principle  of  full  cost  recovery.  While\nGovernment  policies  support  autonomy  of  WSCs  and  full  cost  recovery  for  water  supply,  and\nthe  MOC  tariff  guidelines  set  out  the  methodology  for  achieving  this  objective,  existing  tariff\nlevels  for  virtually  all  WSCs  are  not  sufficient  for  long-term  financially  sustainable  operations.\nWSCs  are  generally  under  budgeted  for  adequate  O&M,  have  no  provisions  for  debt  service,\nand  make  no  allowance  for  income  generation  other  than  through  depreciation.  Apart  from\nreducing  necessary  expenditures  on  O&M,  WSCs  have  also  been  engaged  in  construction\nbusiness  to  supplement  their  revenues  from  water  sales.  This  distorts  the  real  cost  of  water\nproduction  and  sales  and  creates  excessive  demand  for  water  supply.  The  water  tariffs  in  the\nproject towns either have no progressive block structure or the volume of the lifeline block is too\nhigh to have any effect on demand management. The dialogue with the PPCs and WSCs has\nbeen  focusing  on  the  need  to  improve  water  tariff  structure  and  increase  the  tariffs  to  a\nsustainable  level.  The  dialogue  also  aims  at  improving  WSCs\u2019  financial  management,  and\nseparating water supply operations from the construction business to make transparent the cost\nof water supply and subsidies.\n\n\f10\n\n28. With respect to environmental sanitation, the dialogue focuses on the need to establish\nand  enforce  local  regulations  on  sanitation  standards,  water  source  protection,  wastewater\ntreatment  and  discharge,  and  ground  water  licensing.  Unless  the  regulations  are  established\nand  enforced,  the  perceived  benefits  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  projects  may  not  be\nrealized. Specifically, the regulations required are (i) connecting sullage drains and septic tanks\nto drains in high and medium density areas, and to drains or properly designed and constructed\nsoakaways in low density areas; (ii) providing a septic tank that meets prescribed standards in\neach  household  or  business  location  in  high  and  medium  density  areas;  (iii)  allowing  piped\nwater supply connection only when sullage pipes discharging to drains or properly constructed\nsoakaways  are  provided  for;  (iv)  preventing  pollution  in  the  vicinity  of  surface  intakes  and\nborefields;  (v)  controling  and  monitoring  activities  in  catchments  upstream  of  water  supply\nintakes  and  borefields;  (vi)  enforcing  regulations  on  treatment  and  discharge  of  industrial\nwastewater;  and  (vii)  licensing  industrial,  commercial,  and  domestic  use  of  groundwater  in\nsensitive  areas,  and  banning  industrial  and  commercial  use  of  groundwater  in  areas  where\npiped water supply is available. These regulations have been incorporated in the Project design.\n\nAnother major aspect of the policy dialogue focuses on improving the efficiency of sector\n29.\ninstitutions by delegating project implementation functions from MOC to PPCs. Such delegation\nwill allow PPCs, which own the eventual infrastructure constructed and pay the debt service of\nexternal  loans,  to  participate  fully  in  the  design,  implementation,  and  O&M  of  the  Project.  The\ndelegation  will  also  reduce  the  layers  of  required  approvals  and  hence  the  delays  in  project\nimplementation.  MOC,  with  overall  responsibility  for  sector  development,  will  focus  on  sector\npolicy  formulation,  development  planning,  standards  monitoring  and  enforcement,  and  training\nand  capacity  building.  The  dialogue  has \nimplementation\narrangements  under  the  proposed  Project,  where  PPCs  will  be  responsible  for  approval  of\nfeasibility  study  reports,  project  designs,  bidding  documents,  bid  evaluation,  contract  awards,\nand contract variations for the components within the administrative authority of the PPCs.\n\nto  more  decentralized \n\nlead \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n30. Water supply and sanitation are essential services in the urban centers to meet the basic\nhuman needs of the urban population, foster private investment, and sustain economic growth.\nEquitable access to these facilities is important for addressing the urban poverty. Consequently\nthe  Government  gives  high  development  priority  to  the  improvement  of  these  facilities  in  the\nurban  centers.  Substantial  funds  from  external  funding  agencies  have  been  directed  toward\nthese  sectors.  The  provincial  towns  to  be  covered  under  the  Project  were  selected  from  the\nseven remaining provincial towns that have not received any substantial funding assistance for\nthe improvement of water supply and sanitation.\n\nThe  water  supply  systems  in  the  project  towns11  are  in  poor  condition,  due  to  lack  of\n31.\ninvestment  and  inadequate  O&M.  The  pipes  are  incompatible  or  unsuitable,  treatment  plants\nand equipment inefficient, and coverage low. Supply is intermittent in some towns, ranging from\n5-6 hours a day in La Hai to 18 hours a day in Rach Gia and 24 hours a day in Thu Dau Mot.\nEstimated  unaccounted-for water (UFW) ranges from 32 to 54 percent in the project towns. A\n\n                  \n\n11 These are Chi Thanh, La Hai, Phan Rang, Rach Gia, Tay Ninh, Thu Dau Mot, and Tuy Hoa; Chi Thanh and La Hai\n\nare district towns in Phu Yen province, of which Tuy Hoa is the provincial capital.\n\n\f11\n\nlarge  proportion  of  the  urban  population  use  water  from  contaminated  wells  and  surface\nsources,  or  purchase  water  from  vendors  at  prices  much  higher  than  those  of  public  water\nsupply.\n\nSanitation in the project towns is also inadequate, with low coverage of piped drains and\n32.\nseptic tank systems. There are no municipal wastewater treatment plants in any of the project\ntowns, and partially treated or untreated wastewater from industries and hospitals is discharged\ndirectly  to  drainage  canals  or  nearby  waterways.  About  40  percent  of  the  households  in  the\nproject  towns  have  septic  tanks,  with  a  high  proportion  improperly  designed  and  constructed,\nand  unconnected  to  sewers,  drains  or  soakaways.  Households  with  flush  toilets  and  septic\ntanks range from 6 percent in La Hai to 86 percent in Tuy Hoa, and approximately 46 percent of\nhouseholds discharge sullage water from kitchens and bathrooms to yards, gardens, or roads.\nThe  substandard  water  supplies  and  inadequate  sanitation  systems  pose  great  health  risks  to\nthe entire urban population, particularly the urban poor who often live in low-lying areas or at the\nextremities of the water supply system. The water supply and sanitation conditions in the project\ntowns are summarized in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Water Supply and Sanitation Conditions in Project towns\n\nTown\n\nChi Thanh\nLa Hai\nPhan Rang\nRach Gia\nTay Ninh\nThu Dau Mot\nTuy Hoa\nTotal\n\nService Area\nPopulation\n(2000)\n\n21,800\n9,400\n184,800\n176,300\n101,000\n262,000\n95,000\n850,300\n\nHousehold  Water\nSupply Coverage\n(%)\n9\n4\n32\n55\n25\n18\n22\n30\n\nHH = households.\nSource: WSCs documents; ADB estimates.\n\nPopulation\nwith Piped\nWater\n\n2,000\n400\n59,200\n97,500\n25,400\n48,100\n20,500\n253,200\n\nPer Capita\nConsumption\n(lpcd)\n83\n70\n76\n106\n111\n137\n126\n107\n\nSeptic\ntanks\n(% of HH)\n\n20\n6\n44\n52\n67\n>45\n86\n  <41\n\n33.\nAll  project  towns  have  serious  drainage  problems.  The  drains  have  become  heavily\nsilted  with  sediment,  sewage,  and  rubbish,  leading  to  blockages,  uncontrolled  overflows,\nflooding, and bad odors. Many of the towns are on the river banks or the coast, and floods or\nhigh tides aggravate their drainage problems. Some parts of Rach Gia and Tuy Hoa are flooded\nseveral  times  annually  because  of  inadequate  drainage  systems.  Floodwaters  mixed  with\nwastewater expose residents to health risks, and damage property and infrastructure. In many\nproject towns, it is difficult to discharge wastewater and stormwater effectively during floods or\nhigh  tides,  since  river  or  sea  levels  are  above  drainage  outlet  levels,  and  many  areas  are\ninundated for long periods. Thus shallow wells become contaminated and the public is exposed\nto direct contact with pollutants from floodwaters.\n\n34.\nThe  Project  will  assist  the  Government  to  achieve  its  development  objectives  for  the\nsector as outlined in the Orientation Plan for Urban Water Supply to 2020, and will address the\nurgent need in the project towns for improved water supply and sanitation facilities. The Project\nwill  improve  the  urban  environment  and  health  profile  of  the  urban  residents.  The  Project  will\ncontribute  to  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to  reduce  poverty  and  substantially  improve  the  living\nconditions of the poor in the towns. The Project, located in central and southern Viet Nam, will\nalso  support  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  promote  development  in  regions  experiencing\nrelatively lower rates of economic growth.\n\n\fB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n12\n\n35.\nThe Project aims to improve water supply and environmental sanitation conditions in the\nproject towns through integrating critically needed infrastructure developments with community\nawareness and participation, improved financial management and cost recovery by WSCs, and\nlocal  regulations  on  sanitation,  wastewater  management,  and  water  source  protection.  The\nscope  of  the  Project  includes  the  design,  development,  and  delivery  of  (i)  a  community\nenvironmental sanitation improvement program in each project town; (ii) water supply systems\nto  provide  better  quality  water  and  greater  coverage  in  the  towns  and  adjoining  districts;  (iii)\ndrainage and sanitation improvements; and (iv) project implementation assistance and capacity\nbuilding. Details are as follows.\n\n1.\n\nPart A: Community Environmental Sanitation Improvement.\n\n36.\nThis part of the Project has two subcomponents: (i) a public health awareness program\n(PHAP),  and  (ii)  community  environmental  sanitation  improvement  (CESI).  The  PHAP  aims  at\nenhancing  the  communities\u2019  awareness  of  the  relationships  between  water,  sanitation,  and\nhealth,  and  motivating  households  to  connect  to  piped  water  supply  and  convert  to  pour  flush\ntoilets with septic tanks. The awareness activities will focus on economic and health benefits of\npiped water supply, basic hygiene practices, safe excreta disposal, and proper disposal of solid\nwaste and wastewater to improve the environment and reduce personal health risks. In addition,\nthe PHAP will include education on the need for adequate cost recovery and compliance with\nlocal sanitation regulations. The PHAP will inform the communities of the availability of financial\nsupport through the CESI.\n\n37.\nThe  provincial  VWU  will  be  responsible  for  carrying  out  the  PHAP  and  will  utilize\nmaterials, manuals, and training methods developed under ADB\u2019s first Provincial Towns Water\nSupply and Sanitation Project.12 These materials have been field-tested and subsequently used\nin  some  towns.  Posters  and  leaflets  will  be  modified  to  specifically  target  the  smaller  district\ncenters  and  some  ethnic  minority  groups  such  as  the  Cham  and  Khmer.  Pilot  wards  or\ncommunes  in  each  provincial  town  will  be  targeted  for  intensive  health  awareness  planning,\nimplementation,  and  impact  monitoring.  After  an  initial  six-month  period,  the  activities  will\nexpand  to  other  wards  or  communes,  as  expertise  and  experience  develop  within  provincial\nproject  management  units  (PPMUs)  and  provincial  VWUs.  For  district  towns,  the  entire  town\nareas  will  be  targeted  for  public  health  awareness  activities.  PPMUs  will  coordinate  with\nadministrative, community, health, and welfare organizations and nongovernment organizations\n(NGOs), in support of the provincial VWUs.\n\n38.\nThe  CESI  aims  at  providing  small-scale  environmental  sanitation  improvements  not\ncovered  by  the  main  construction  contracts,  to  meet  the  demand  for  improvements  generated\nthrough  the  PHAP.  The  CESI  will  establish  procedures  for  community-based  sanitation\nimprovement, and define roles and responsibilities for the stakeholders such as WSCs, people\u2019s\ncommittees at all levels, NGOs, mass organizations, and the general communities with respect\nto  sanitation  improvement.  It  intends  to  stimulate  community  participation  in  planning  and\nimplementation. The exact scope of the CESI in each town will depend on community demand\nand  the  priorities  established  by  town  authorities.  Items  eligible  for  financing  may  include:  (i)\ntoilets  with  septic  tanks  at  schools,  aid  posts,  and  public  or  communal  residential  areas;  (ii)\nwashbasins at schools, aid posts, people\u2019s committees, and other public locations; (iii) rubbish\n\n12 TA 2376-VIE: Community Environmental Health Improvements for the Provincial Towns, for $500,000, approved in \n\n                  \n\nAugust 1995.\n\n\f13\n\nbins  and  handcarts,  collection  depots,  and  collection  and  disposal  systems;  (iv)  small-scale\ndrainage linking to larger improvements under the Project; and (v) cleaning of unofficial public\nwaste dumping areas, such as drains, canals, and other waterways, and public land.\n\nFor  public  sanitation  improvement,  CESI  funds  will  be  provided,  in  two  tranches  as\n39.\ngrants,  through  the  PPMU,  to  the  town  or  district  people\u2019s  committees  as  matching  funds  to\nmeet  no  more  than  60  percent  of  the  cost  of  the  identified  projects,  and  local  people\u2019s\ncommittees will be responsible for financing the remaining 40 percent cost and for implementing\nand  monitoring  the  activities.  For  household  sanitation  improvement,  CESI  will  provide  credit\nassistance  through  provincial  VWUs  to  low-income  groups  for  improving  or  constructing\nsanitation facilities, including septic tanks, bathrooms, and connections to drains or sewers. The\ncredit will cover 50-80 percent of the cost depending on the level of incomes of the borrowers.\nProvincial  VWUs,  with  assistance  from  the  consultants  and  PPMU,  will  work  with  local\ngovernments to establish the terms and conditions for the credit scheme in each project town.\n\n2. \n\nPart B: Water Supply\n\n40.\nThe  water  supply  systems  in  the  five  provinces  will  be  upgraded  and  expanded  to  the\ncapacity  of  220,000  cubic  meters  (m3)  per  day  in  the  service  areas  in  2010.  The  Project  will\nupgrade  and  expand  raw  water  systems,  water  treatment  plants,  pumping  stations,  and\nreservoirs in the project towns. It will install about 901 kilometers (km) of new pipes to augment\nand expand the transmission and distribution networks, including replacement of about 85 km of\nthe  existing  treated  water  transmission  and  distribution  mains,  and  add  about  78,100  new\nservice connections. The Project will also provide mechanical and electrical equipment as well\nas  equipment  for  construction  and  O&M.  In  addition,  an  UFW  program  will  be  carried  out  in\neach  project  town  to  identify  the  main  sources  of  technical  and  commercial  losses,  provide\nequipment  and  training  for  leak  detection,  and  reduce  UFW  to  optimum  levels  based  on  cost-\nbenefit analyses.\n\n41.\nIn Tay Ninh and Thu Dau Mot, sludge lagoons will be constructed adjacent to the water\ntreatment  plants  to  receive  backwash  water  and  sludge  from  the  existing  and  new\nsedimentation tanks. Surplus water from the lagoons will be discharged to the treatment plants'\ndrainage  systems.  For  Phan  Rang  and  Rach  Gia  water  treatment  plants,  sludge  from\nsedimentation  tanks  and  backwash  water  will  be  discharged  to  storage  basins,  and  surplus\nwater will be discharged through drains directly to the adjacent canal or river under suitable tide\nand streamflow conditions. For Chi Thanh, La Hai, and Tuy Hoa plants, backwash water will be\nconveyed to settling basins, with surplus water being discharged to drains or canals adjacent to\nthe water treatment plants. The sludge that accumulates in sludge lagoons, storage basins, and\nsettling  basins  will  be  dewatered  and  taken  to  the  towns'  landfills.  Table  3  summarizes  the\nexpected outcome of the water supply and sanitation components of the Project by 2010.\n\n3. \n\nPart C: Drainage and Sanitation\n\n42.\nPart C has two subcomponents: drainage improvement and sanitation improvement. The\ndrainage improvements will include the rehabilitation and cleaning of 22 km of existing drains,\nand  construction  of  69  km  of  secondary  and  tertiary  drains  in  the  towns.  These  works  will\nimprove  existing  drainage  conditions,  relieve  flooding  in  selected  critical  areas,  and  provide\nbasic  drainage  in  high-density  areas  to  ensure  that  wastewater  can  be  discharged  to  drains\nwithout  affecting  health  and  environmental  conditions.  Equipment  and  tools  for  O&M  of\ncombined drainage systems will also be provided to WSCs or public works companies (PWCs)\nin the towns.\n\n\f14\n\nTable 3:  Forecast Conditions After Project (Year 2010)\n\nTown\n\nChi Thanh\nLa Hai\nPhan Rang\nRach Gia\nTay Ninh\nThu Dau Mot\nTuy Hoa\nTotal\n\nService Area\nPopulation\n(2010)\n26,300\n11,300\n256,600\n213,000\n137,000\n385,000\n117,100\n1,146,300\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nHousehold Water\nSupply Coverage\n(%)\n49\n80\n81\n86\n69\n74\n87\n78\n\nPopulation\nwith Piped\nWater\n12,800\n9,000\n208,800\n182,400\n94,700\n285,000\n102,000\n894,700\n\nPer Capita\nConsumption\n(lpcd)\n100\n100\n111\n120\n120\n120\n115\n117\n\nSeptic tanks\n(% of HH)\n\n50\n50\n60\n62\n69\n53\n87\n61\n\n43. Works under sanitation improvement will include (i) introducing septic tank management\nsystems  in  project  towns  to  control  the  design,  construction,  registration,  and  desludging  of\nseptic tanks, and a septic tank database to be integrated with the computerized billing system in\neach  WSC,  to  monitor  and  manage  the  septic  tanks  maintenance  in  the  communities;  (ii)\nimproving  public  sanitation  facilities  in  markets,  bus  stations,  railway  stations,  boat  harbors,\nhospitals,  and  primary  and  secondary  schools;  and  (iiii)  supplying  WSCs  or  PWCs  with\nequipment for construction, and O&M of sanitation facilities. This subcomponent, combined with\nthe CESI program of Part A, will construct about 20,000 septic tanks in the project areas.\n\n4. \n\nPart D: Implementation Assistance and Capacity Building\n\n44.\nPart D has two subcomponents: (i) project orientation assistance (POA), and (ii) project\nimplementation assistance (PIA). The objective of POA is to provide institutional and managerial\nassistance  to  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  and  PPMUs  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the\ndetailed  designs.  The  POA  will  help  establish  PPMUs\u2019  functional  procedures;  set  up  project\naccounts and management information systems; and deliver intensive training to the PCU and\nPPMUs in project management, procurement, accounting, administration, reporting, monitoring\nand evaluation (M&E), and ADB and Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD) procedures.\nThe  consultant  will  prepare  project  administration  procedures,  manuals,  and  related  software.\nExperienced staff of MOC, MOF, Ministry of Planning and Investment, State Bank of Viet Nam,\nADB, and AFD will be invited to provide training to members of the PCU, PPMUs, and related\nprovincial and local organizations. Workshops, seminars, and training will be held in HCMC and\nthe provinces.\n\n45.\nPIA  will  comprise  the  consulting  services  for  the  engineering  design  and  construction\nsupervision for Parts B and C, as well as design and delivery of Part A. The PIA will also include\nassistance  in  capacity  building  for  WSCs  aimed  at  improving  their  long-term  sustainability.  It\ncovers \nfinancial  management,  UFW  management,  and  asset  management.  Financial\nmanagement  will  focus  on  water  tariff  planning,  billing,  and  collections;  computerization  of\naccounting  systems;  capital  investment  and  budgeting,  and  management  of  accounts\nreceivable. UFW management will identify the main sources of technical and commercial losses\nto reduce UFW to optimum levels, based on cost-benefit analyses. It will include leak detection,\ncustomer  registration,  and  meter  management.  Asset  management  will  assist  WSCs  in\nmanaging  asset  inventories,  preparing  O&M  plans  and  guidelines,  and  budgeting  for\nappropriate asset maintenance. The Project will also improve workshop and laboratory facilities,\nand provide equipment for construction and O&M of water and drainage facilities.\n\n\fC. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n15\n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $98.0  million  equivalent,  comprising  $50.4  million\n46.\n(51.4 percent) equivalent as foreign exchange cost, including about $1.1 million interest charges\nduring construction; and $47.6 million equivalent (48.6 percent) as local currency cost, including\nduties  and  taxes  of  about  $5.6  million.

ADB financing of local currency cost is justified by the tight fiscal conditions\nof the provincial governments, which are responsible for providing the counterpart funds and the\ndebt service payment of the Project. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years with a grace\nperiod of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5\npercent  per  annum  thereafter.  AFD  will  provide  a  loan  of  12.4  million  euro  ($11.0  million)  to\ncofinance  on  a  parallel  basis  11.2  percent  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  AFD  loan  will  have  a\nmaturity  of  17  years  with  a  grace  period  of  6  years,  and  an  interest  rate  of  2.5  percent  per\nannum.13 The remaining $27 million, equivalent to 27.6 percent of the total project cost, is the\nlocal counterpart contribution, of which the PPCs will finance $23.5 million equivalent, and the\nproject beneficiaries will contribute the remaining $3.5 million equivalent in the form of payment\nfor water supply connections. The financing plan is summarized in Table 5.14\n\n48.\nPart  of  the  loan  funds  from  ADB  and  AFD  will  be  relent  by  the  Government  to  WSCs\nthrough  subsidiary  loans  in  domestic  currency  to  cover  the  cost  of  water  supply  systems\nupgrading and expansion, and part will be provided to PPCs as grants to cover the cost of other\ncomponents. The terms of the subsidiary loans to WSCs will be based on the blended terms of\n\n                  \n\n13 The AFD loan\u2019s terms are adjusted annually at the beginning of each calendar year, and will be fixed for the entire\n\nmaturity once approved by its board.\n\n14 The Government is requesting a grant from the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD) to\n\ncofinance, on a parallel basis, the consulting services under POA. If the request is approved by NORAD, POA will\nbe under NORAD financing instead of ADB loan.\n\n\fADB and AFD loans, and will have a maturity of 22 years with a grace period of 6 years, and a\nfixed interest rate of six percent per annum. The Government will assume the foreign exchange\nrisk. All the taxes and duties will be paid by the provincial governments.\n\n16\n\nTable 5: Proposed Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n18.6\n4.4\n23.5\n1.1\n47.6\n48.6\n\nTotal\nCost\n60.0\n11.0\n23.5\n3.5\n98.0\n100.0\n\n41.4\n6.6\n0.0\n2.4\n50.4\n51.4\n\nPercent\n\n61.2\n11.2\n24.0\n3.6\n100.0\n\nSource\nAsian Development Bank\nAgence Francaise de Developpement\nProvincial governments\nBeneficiaries\nTotal\nPercent\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nE. \n\nExecuting Agencies\n\nThe  PPC  in  each  project  province  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  all  the\n49.\nimplementation issues in the province. In line with the Government\u2019s decentralization policy and\nas  part  of  the  state  enterprise  reform,  the  responsibility  for  operating  public  utilities,  including\nwater  supply,  has  been  assigned  to  PPCs.  While  PPCs  have  designated  WSCs  as  the  legal\nentities responsible for construction and O&M of urban water supply, PPCs have considerable\ninfluence  on  the  WSCs\u2019  development  activities,  including  setting  targets  for  water  production\nand distribution, and deciding on WSCs\u2019 financial policies including tariffs.\n\nThe provincial WSC will play significant roles in the implementation of the Project in each\n50.\nprovince. WSCs manage both district and provincial towns\u2019 water supply systems. As of 2000,\nthe number of employees in the five provincial WSCs ranged from 43 in Phu Yen to 175 in Kien\nGiang.  The  number  of  employees  per  thousand  connections  varied  from  about  8  in  Phu  Yen\nand Ninh Thuan, to 11 in Kien Giang, and 17-19 in Tay Ninh and Binh Duong. By 2010, the ratio\nis expected to stabilize at about 10-15, which is typical for well-managed water supply systems\nin similar sized Asian towns, as a result of the improvement in management and increase in the\nnumber of connections. Staffing of the WSCs is summarized in Table 6.\n\nTable 6:  WSC Staffing Levels\n\nProduction Connections\n\nSystems\nNo.\n6\n2\n4\n6\n3\n\nCompany\nWSC\nKien Giang\nBinh Duong\nTay Ninh\nPhu Yen\nNinh Thuan\nNotes:\n 1.

However, the financial and management autonomy of\n\n\f17\n\nWSCs is limited due to the requirement for government approval of most key management and\noperating  decisions.  This  includes  the  determination  of  tariff  structures  and  levels,  overall\nproduction  levels,  staff  salary  and  benefit  levels,  capital  expenditures,  and  senior  staff\nappointments. The accounting and financial department of a WSC is responsible for preparing\nand  maintaining  core  accounting  systems  of  the  company  and  for  all  external  reporting.  The\nnumber  of  accounting  and  financial  department  staff,  including  the  chief  accountant,  in  the\nproject WSCs ranges from four in Ninh Thuan, Phu Yen, and Tay Ninh, to eight in Kieng Giang,\nand  nine  in  Binh  Duong.  In  addition  to  the  accounting  and  financial  department,  three  other\ndepartments  within  the  WSC  undertake  financial  management  functions.  The  business\nreceivable\ndepartment \nmanagement. The planning and procurement department is responsible for preparing plans for\nsales,  operation,  and  capital  expenditure,  and  for  all  procurement.  The  payroll  and  personnel\ndepartment is responsible for payroll and personnel management.\n\nfor  customer  billing  and  collections, \n\nresponsible \n\nincluding \n\nis \n\n52.\nStatutory  requirements  for  accounting,  reporting,  and  auditing  in  Viet  Nam  are\nestablished  and  regulated  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF).  The  monitoring  of  WSCs'\ncompliance  with  these  requirements  is  normally  delegated  to  the  provincial  departments  of\nfinance  (DOFs)  and  tax  bureaus.  Current  Vietnamese  accounting  standards,  which  became\neffective as of 1 January 1996 under Decision No. 1141-TC-CDKT, are referred to as the Viet\nNam  Accounting  System  -  1995  (VAS-1995).    All  SOEs,  including  the  WSCs,  are  required  to\nuse  VAS-1995,  which  is  fairly  consistent  with  international  accounting  standards.  There  is  no\nstatutory  requirement  for  an  audit  of  the  WSCs  accounts  by  an  independent  auditor.  DOFs\nnormally examine the financial statements and records on behalf of the PPCs to ensure that the\ncapitals  held  by  WSCs  have  been  properly  accounted  for  in  accordance  with  all  applicable\nGovernment regulations and to determine taxes payable.\n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nProject Management Structure\n\nThe PPC in each province will set up a provincial steering committee (PSC),15 which, on\n53.\nbehalf of the PPC, will have the overall responsibilities for the project implementation. The PSC\nwill  comprise  senior  officials  from  the  PPC,  department  of  construction,  DOF,  department  of\nplanning  and  investment,  town  people\u2019s  committees,  district  people\u2019s  committees,  provincial\nVWUs,  and  manager  of  the  PPMU.  The  PSC  will  appoint  PPMU  staff  and  experts,  provide\npolicy  guidance  to  the  PPMU  and  consultants,  and  coordinate  provincial  agencies  to  ensure\ntimely  project  implementation.  Specifically,  the  PSC  will  have  the  following  responsibilities:  (i)\nadvise the PPC on the implementation status of the Project in the province; (ii) assist the PPC in\nmaking  decisions  on  issues  related  to  project  implementation  within  the  authority  of  the\nprovincial  government;  (iii)  assist  the  PPC  in  approving  key  provincial  project  documents,\nincluding  feasibility  study  reports,  provincial  bidding  plans,  bid  documents,  draft  contracts,  bid\nevaluation, and contract awards and variations; (iv) assist the PPC in approving the budget for\ncounterpart funds and ensuring their timely release; (v) coordinate provincial organizations and\nPPMU in project implementation; and (vi) assist the PPC in approving other project documents\nsubmitted by the PPMU.\n\n54.\nThe  PPC  in  each  province  will  set  up  a  PPMU  with  the  director  of  WSC  serving  as  its\nmanager. The PPMU will be responsible for day-to-day project implementation in the province\nand  will  comprise  staff  from  the  WSC  and  provincial-, town- , or district-level agencies, with\n\n15 Except in Ninh Thuan province, where the PPC prefers to place PPMU under its direct control.\n\n                  \n\n\fexpertise \nin  project  management,  water  supply  engineering,  sanitary  engineering,\nenvironmental management, accounting, and community education and development. The main\ntasks of the PPMU are to:\n\n18\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nsupervise  work  schedules  and  performance  of  the  consultants  in  the  province,\nand  review  designs,  bidding  plans,  bidding  documents,  and  contracts  and\nprepare recommendations for approvals by provincial authorities;\nprequalify  contractors  and  undertake  contract  negotiations,  supervise  the\nperformance  of  contractors,  certify  the  quality  and  quantity  of  their  output,  and\nauthorize payments accordingly;\nprepare  withdraw  applications  for  approval  by  MOF  before  submitting  them  to\nADB;\napprove  payment  through  an  imprest  account  and  maintain  disbursement\nrecords;\nprepare  monthly  and  quarterly  project  progress  reports  to  the  PCU  for\nconsolidation  before  submission  to  the  central  steering  committee  (CSC)  and\nADB, and help prepare the project completion report;\n\n(vi)  maintain sound project accounts and ensure timely completion and submission of\n\nthe account and financial statements of WSC for auditing;\ncoordinate  all  field-level  activities  of  all  provincial-,  district-,  and  town-level\nagencies related to the Project;\nsupervise  the  compliance  with  the  local  sanitation  regulations  and  recommend\nactions for PPCs for improvement;\nprepare monitoring and evaluation (M&E) reports to PSC, PCU, and ADB; and\nsupervise the implementation of resettlement plans approved under this Project.\n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n(x) \n\n55.\nThe provincial VWU will be responsible for implementing and managing the PHAP and\nthe  sanitation  credit  scheme  in  the  project  towns.  With  assistance  from  consultants,  and  in\nconsultation  with  the  PPMU  and  district-  and  town-level  government  agencies,  the  provincial\nVWU will organize and carry out the PHAP. Through its lower level offices, the provincial VWU\nwill  promote  public  awareness  about  the  credit  scheme,  identify  poor  households,  establish\ncredit terms and conditions, process credit applications, collect repayments, maintain accounts\nand  records,  and  arrange  for  inspection  and  certification  by  the  PPMU  and  other  appropriate\nauthorities.  The  provincial  VWU  will  provide  a  quarterly  report  and  a  detailed  annual  report  to\nthe PPMU on credit scheme activities. The PPMU will be responsible for monitoring the credit\nschemes in the province. The accounts of the credit scheme will be subject to audit by the same\nproject auditor to be appointed by the CSC and acceptable to ADB.\n\n56.\nTo  ensure  standards  and  quality  in  project  implementation,  monitoring,  and  report,  a\nCSC will be established, comprising one senior official from MOC as chairperson and the  five\nproject provinces as members. The CSC may invite ADB or AFD staff as observers. The CSC\nwill  be  assisted  by  a  PCU  comprising  full-time  professional  staff  with  adequate  project\nexperience  and  proficiency  in  English  language.  The  PCU  will  be  responsible  for  selecting\nconsultants  and  supervising  their  work  programs  and  staffing  schedules;  preparing  a\nconsolidated  project  progress  report  for  CSC  and  ADB;  recording  and  reviewing  withdrawal\napplications  from  PPMUs;  preparing  terms  of  reference  for  auditing  all  the  project  accounts;\nrecommending a qualified auditing firm to the CSC for its approval and negotiating the contract;\nreviewing \nthe\ncomments/recommendations of the auditor. Upon request from PPMUs, the PCU will assist in\nproject  implementation,  with  regard  to  ADB  and  AFD  procedures,  international  and  local\ncompetitive bidding processes, bid preparation and evaluation, and contract awards. The PCU\n\nthe  audited  statements  of  project  accounts,  and \n\nfollowing  up  on \n\n\fwill  also  assist  PPMUs  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  training  programs.  The  PCU  will\nhave its main office in HCMC.\n\n19\n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  six  years  commencing  in  2002  and  ending  in  31\n\n57.\nDecember 2007. An indicative project implementation schedule is presented in Appendix 4.\n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n3. \n\n Advance Action\n\n58.\nA  major  cause  of  delay  in  earlier  ADB  projects  is  the  slow  process  for  selecting  the\nconsultants. To speed up project implementation, ADB approved the request of the Government\nfor advance action to engage consultants. The Government has been advised that approval of\nthe advance action does not, in any way, commit ADB to finance the Project, and that the action\nshould be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n\n4. \n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\n59. WSCs  will  be  responsible  for  O&M  of  the  water  supply  systems.  The  consultants  will\nhelp develop and implement O&M plans. Specialized O&M equipment will be procured and on-\nthe-job and formal training on O&M will be provided for WSCs. Water tariffs will be adjusted to\nallow adequate funds for O&M. WSCs will establish, equip, and train permanent leak detection\nteams; install and regularly calibrate bulk water meters at treatment plants and at critical points\nin the network; introduce effective meter management, including transfer of meter ownership to\nWSCs,  replacement  of  defective  meters,  and  regular  testing  of  consumer  water  meters;  and\nmonitor  the  UFW  program.  The  PWC/WSC  in  each  town  will  be  responsible  for  O&M  of  the\ndrainage  and  public  sanitation  facilities  constructed  under  the  Project,  while  the  individual\nhouseholds will be responsible for the O&M of the private latrines and septic tanks. The VWU in\neach  province  will  be  responsible  for  the  operation  and  administration  of  the  sanitation  credit\nschemes.\n\n5. \n\nProcurement\n\nProcurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines\n60.\nfor Procurement. Civil  works  and  supply  contracts  valued  above  $1.0  million  and  $0.5  million,\nrespectively,  will  be  procured  under  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  This  will\ninclude the civil works contracts for the water supply components and a supply contract for UFW\nequipment  for  the  Project.  Local  competitive  bidding  contracts  include  minor  civil  works  and\nsupply contracts valued at or below the given thresholds. Where special license is required or\nwhere  there  is  no  adequate  competition,  supply  and  installation  contracts  valued  at  or  below\n$100,000 may be awarded following direct purchase procedures, subject to approval by ADB on\na  case  by  case  basis.  This  will  include  mainly  contracts  for  supply  and  installation  of  power\ndistribution lines and transformers. Force accounts will be used to clean and rehabilitate water\nsupply  pipelines  and  drains,  and  for  service  connections.  Supply  contracts  for  equipment  and\nvehicles  valued  at  $0.5  million  or  less  per  contract  will  be  procured  through  international\nshopping  procedures,  and  supply  contracts  valued  at  $100,000  or  less  will  follow  direct\npurchase procedures. AFD funds will be used to finance pipes, valves, fittings, and civil works\nfor  water  supply  distribution  pipelines  (50-200  millimeters  in  diameter)  in  each  province  under\nlocal competitive bidding procedures in accordance with the regulations of the Government.\n\n\f20\n\n61.\nFor  purposes  of  expediency,  standardization,  and  cost  effectiveness,  the  PCU  will  be\nresponsible for the procurement of (i) specialized equipment and materials for UFW programs\nunder  one  international  competitive  bidding  contract;  (ii)  computer  hardware  under  one\ninternational shopping contract; and (iii) software for WSC billing, accounting, and management\ninformation systems following direct purchase procedures. The procurement of vehicles, office\nequipment,  and  consumables  for  PPMUs,  the  PCU,  and  the  consultants  will  be  managed\nindependently  by  each  party  within  agreed  budgets,  using  international  shopping  or  direct\npurchase  procedures,  or  according  to  the  Government\u2019s  standard  procedures  acceptable  to\nADB. Indicative procurement packaging is presented in Appendix 5.\n\n6. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n62.\nConsulting services will be provided under the loan to support project management and\nimplementation.  There  will  be  two  consulting  service  contracts:  project  orientation  assistance,\nand  project  implementation  assistance.  A  total  of  1,480  person-months  of  consulting  services\n(206 international and 1,274 domestic) will be required for assistance in such areas as project\nmanagement,  water  supply  engineering  and  design,  sanitation  engineering  and  design,  UFW\nimprovement,  construction  management,  community  development,  sanitation  credit  scheme,\ntraining  and  capacity  building,  and  technical  support  to  the  PPMUs  and  PCU.  The  consulting\nservices  will  be  provided  by  international  consulting  firms  in  association  with  domestic\nconsultants.  To  minimize  costs  and  facilitate  access  to  the  provinces,  the  consultants  will  be\nmainly located in HCMC and will have representatives stationed in each province to work with\nPPMUs  during  the  project  construction  stage.  PCU  representatives  will  work  with  the\nconsultants in their HCMC office. Consulting services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the\nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  are\npresented in Appendix 6.\n\n7. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement\n\n63.\nAbout  68  hectares  of  agricultural  and  residential  land  will  be  required  for  the  Project.\nSome  71  households  will  be  relocated  to  allow  construction  of  reservoirs  and  water  treatment\nplants. In addition, slightly more than 900 affected persons will be entitled to receive some form\nof compensation as a result of the Project. These are shown in Table 7.\n\nTable 7: Assessments of Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n\nProject Town\n\nChi Thanh\nLa Hai\nPhan Rang\nRach Gia\nTay Ninh\nThu Dau Mot\nTuy Hoa\n\nTOTAL\n\nPermanent Land\nAcquisition (ha)\n5.38\n0.20\n1.79\n16.01\n2.02\n30.00\n12.69\n68.09\n\nTemporary Land\nAcquisition (ha)\n0.74\n0.00\n1.28\n17.10\n0.00\n0.00\n0.72\n19.84\n\nNumber of Households\nto be Resettled\n0\n0\n                39\n                14\n8\n10\n0\n                71\n\nNumber of Affected\nPersons\n18\n5\n195\n195\n220\n86\n185\n904\n\nNote:  In some provinces, these estimates may be revised once detailed designs are completed.\nSource: Resettlement plans of project provinces.\n\n64.\nLand  acquisition,  compensation,  and  relocation  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with\nADB  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement,  Government  laws,  and  approved  resettlement  plans.\nPublic consultation has been carried  out  by WSCs, and  compensation  standards  have  been\n\n\f21\n\nrevised accordingly. WSCs and PPCs are responsible for implementing the resettlement plans,\ncompensating resettled households and affected persons, and carrying out the land acquisition\nand  relocation  support.  The  implementation  status  of  resettlement  plans  will  be  reported  by\nWSCs in project progress reports to be submitted to PPCs, PSCs, PCU, and ADB. WSCs will\ncomplete land acquisition, compensation, and resettlement processes, and obtain rights of entry\nto  private  properties  for  both  construction  and  ongoing  maintenance  of  the  water  supply\npipelines and drains, before awarding water supply contracts. A summary of the land acquisition\nand resettlement plans for the five provinces is presented in Appendix 7.\n\n8. \n\nDisbursement\n\n65.\nAn  imprest  account  for  the  administrative  expenditures  of  the  CSC  and  PCU  will  be\nestablished  at  the  central  level  and  managed  by  the  PCU.  The  administrative  expenditures  of\nthe CSC and PCU will be shared by PPCs as part of their counterpart fund contributions. Each\nPPC  will  set  up  its  own  imprest  account,  at  the  provincial  level,  for  disbursement  of  eligible\nfunds relating to small contracts under local competitive bidding, direct purchase, international\nshopping,  and  incremental  administrative  expenses.  The  PCU  and  each  PPMU  will  set  up  its\nimprest  account  with  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  the  Government  and  ADB,  and  will  be\nresponsible for the use, management, replenishment, and liquidation of the imprest account, in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  in\neach account will be limited to six months\u2019 projected disbursement, to be prepared by PCU and\neach PPMU, with the aggregated amount of the six imprest accounts not exceeding $3 million.\nWithdrawal applications, including imprest account replenishment requests, will be prepared by\nthe PCU and PPMUs and sent to MOF for approval. MOF will forward the approved applications\nto ADB, with a copy to the PCU. ADB will transfer funds to the imprest accounts directly upon\nreceiving  the  request  from  MOF.  Funds  for  the  sanitation  credit  schemes  will  be  disbursed\nthrough PPMUs\u2019 imprest accounts to the provincial VWUs. The PCU and PPMUs may use the\nstatement  of  expenditure  procedure  for  replenishing  the  imprest  accounts,  including  the\nexpenditures incurred by the provincial VWUs, provided that each individual contract does not\nexceed the amount of $50,000.\n\n9. \n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\nEach PPMU will prepare quarterly project progress reports and submit them to the PCU\n66.\nfor  consolidation  and  reporting  to  the  CSC  and  ADB.  The  reports  will  provide  a  narrative\ndescription of the progress during the reporting period, any modifications to the implementation\nschedule,  details  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  problems  and  difficulties  experienced,\nremedial actions proposed, and the work to be carried out during the upcoming reporting period.\nThe PPMU quarterly progress report will include a summary of expenditures during the quarter,\nyear-to-date  expenditures,  and  total  expenditures  to  date.  WSCs  will  prepare  their  annual\nfinancial  statements,  including  (i)  the  balance  sheet,  (ii)  income  statement,  and,  (iii)  cash  flow\nstatement.  A  project  completion  report  will  be  submitted  by  each  PPMU  to  the  PCU  for\nconsolidation and submission to the CSC and ADB within three months of physical completion\nof the Project. The project completion report will highlight the development impacts achieved by\nthe Project. All reports and the associated financial accounts and data will be presented to ADB\nin the English language.\n\n67.\nPPMUs,  with  assistance  from  consultants  for  project  orientation  assistance,  will  set  up\nthe  project  accounts  in  accordance  with  Government  regulations.  The  consultants  will  provide\ntraining  and  operating  support  to  the  PPMUs\u2019  accounting  staff  on  the  use  of  these  accounts.\nThe project accounts, including the imprest accounts, and financial statements of the WSCs will\n\n\f22\n\nbe audited by auditors acceptable to ADB. The PPMUs will prepare the required information for\naudit in accordance with project auditing requirements of the Government and ADB. Auditing of\nthe project accounts and financial statements of WSCs will be carried out annually, and audited\nstatements of project accounts and WSCs\u2019 financial statements will be submitted to ADB within\nnine months of the close of the Government's fiscal year.\n\n10. \n\nLoan Reviews\n\n68.\nADB will conduct loan reviews at least twice yearly. In addition, a comprehensive review\nwill  be  carried  out  about  24  months  after  the  effectiveness  of  loan  agreement.  The\ncomprehensive  review  will  evaluate  the  actual  progress  of  each  project  component  in  each\nprovince; implementation procedures; monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities; functions and\nperformance of the CSC, PCU, PSCs, PPMUs, and provincial VWUs; subsidiary loan terms and\nperformance;  and  the  performance  of  the  consultants.  The  financial  performance  and  cost\nrecovery  of  WSCs  will  also  be  evaluated.  Remedial  action  will  be  taken  to  address  any\nproblems identified.\n\n11.  Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n69.\nThe  Project  includes  an  M&E  system  to  ensure  that  water  and  sanitation  systems  are\noperating  efficiently  at  design  levels,  and  that  consumers  are  deriving  the  envisaged  benefits.\nBaseline  conditions  will  be  established  prior  to  commissioning  of  project  facilities.  The  design\nand  establishment of  the M&E  system will be undertaken by PPMUs with assistance from the\nconsultants. The M&E system will be based on that used for previous ADB projects, using the\nsoftware developed specifically for this purpose. The PPMUs will be responsible for carrying out\nthe M&E activities, including the establishment of benchmarks through initial physical and social\nsurveys, data collection and analysis, and reporting to the PCU. The surveys will be undertaken\nannually to determine changes in the key indicators. The PCU will be responsible for submitting\na  detailed  implementation  plan  for  preparing  benchmarks  and  benefit  monitoring  within  six\nmonths of the arrival of the design consultants, and for consolidating and submitting the annual\nM&E reports to the CSC and ADB. Detailed M&E indicators are presented in Appendix 8.\n\nG. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n70.\nThe Project is an environmental category B project. An initial environmental examination\nwas  carried  out  for  each  project  town,  and  a  supplementary  analysis  was  conducted  for  the\nproposed raw water reservoir at Rach Gia. The examinations show that adverse environmental\neffects will be limited and can be mitigated through integrated corrective measures. A detailed\nenvironmental impact assessment is not required. The examinations indicate that a safe, clean,\nreliable  water  supply  and  improved  sewage  disposal  systems  in  urban  areas  will  significantly\nimprove  the  public  health  and  environmental  conditions  in  the  project  towns.  The  existing\nproblems of polluted pools of standing water, unpleasant odors, and health risks associated with\nincreased quantities of wastewater will be improved because of the integration of water supplies\nwith  improved  drainage  and  sanitation  systems  and  heightened  public  health  awareness.  This\nwill  contribute  to  an  improvement  in  the  quality  of  life  and  community  health  profiles  for  the\ntowns. The disposal of sludge in the project water treatment plants will be improved by providing\nsludge lagoons, storage basins, settlement basins, and drying beds in the treatment plants.\n\n71.\nThere  are  no  known  endangered  varieties  of  flora  or  species  of  fauna,  or  sites  of\nhistorical or cultural significance in the project areas that are likely to be affected. Land areas for\nthe proposed water  supply  and  sanitation  development   have  been  developed  or  disturbed\n\n\f23\n\npreviously and have no forest or unusual vegetation cover. Major impacts of the Project will be\ntemporary,  including  health  and  safety  effects  on  communities  during  construction;  turbidity,\ndust,  and  noise  generated  by  construction  equipment;  and  disposal  of  acidic  sulfate  soils.\nApproximately  71  households  will  be  resettled  to  allow  construction  or  expansion  of  water\ntreatment  plants  and  reservoirs.  WSCs  and  PPCs  will  be  responsible  for  implementing\nresettlement plans.\n\nincorporated \n\nMitigation  measures  have  been  proposed  and \n\n72.\nin  project  design.\nEnvironmental  management  plans  and  monitoring  programs  are  proposed  for  each  project\ncomponent to the PPCs for implementation. Environmental training programs will be provided to\nthe  staff  of  WSCs,  PPMUs,  and  the  departments  of  science,  technology,  and  environment,  to\nstrengthen  their  capacities  of  addressing  environmental  concerns  during  the  design  and\nconstruction phases of the Project. The contractors will be required to prepare and implement\ntheir  own  environmental  management  plans,  and  carry  out  the  construction  work  in  line  with\ninternational  standards.  Other  measures  to  be  implemented  as  part  of  the  Project  include  (i)\nmonitoring  of  groundwater  quality  and  quantity;  (ii)  control  and  monitoring  of  activities  in\ncatchments upstream of water supply intakes and borefields; (iii) enforcement of regulations for\ntreatment  and  discharge  of  industrial  wastewater;  (iv)  licensing  of  industrial,  commercial,  and\ndomestic  use  of  groundwater  in  sensitive  areas;  and  (vi)  banning  of  the  industrial  and\ncommercial use of groundwater in areas where piped water supply is available.\n\nOne major obstacle to poorer households connecting to piped water supply is the cost of\n73.\nconnection, which varies between towns from D600,000 to over D1.0 million, depending on the\ndistance from the reticulation pipes. To allow better access by the poor to piped water supply,\nthe Project will take measures to allow low-income households to pay by installments over 18\nmonths. The sanitation credit schemes will also alleviate the financial burdens of the low-income\nhouseholds  wishing  to  improve  their  sanitation  conditions.  The  Project  will  carry  out  PHAP  in\neach project town to ensure that the change of hygiene behavior will complement the improved\nwater  supply  and  sanitation  facilities.  PPCs  are  required  to  provide  early  information  to  the\npublic  on  the  need  to  increase  tariff  and  availability  of  credit  for  water  supply  connection  and\nsanitation improvement to low-income households.\n\n74.\nThe CESI activities are aimed at maximizing the benefits of the Project. These activities\nhave  previously  proven  to  be  a  significant  factor  in  deriving  additional  benefits,  including  (i)\nimproving the skills of WSCs and other local government organizations in communicating with\nthe  communities;  (ii)  improving  WSCs\u2019  understanding  of  their  customers  and  community\npreferences;  (iii)  greater  openness  and  accountability  of  local  governments;  (iv)  greater  public\nparticipation in planning and decision making, leading to a higher level of ownership and public\nsupport for governments and WSCs; and (v) improving people's access to local authorities and\ncommunity networks.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses\n\n1.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n75.\nAn economic analysis has been undertaken for each project town as well as the overall\nProject. The analysis is based on the forecasts of water production and sales and capital and\noperating  costs  used  in  the  financial  analysis.  The  economic  analysis  is  carried  out  using\neconomic prices, derived from financial prices with adjustments for transfer payments including\ntaxes,  duties,  and  subsidies,  and  for  any  other  market  distortions.  The  analysis  of  the  water\n\n\f24\n\nsupply  and  sanitation  subprojects  in  each  of  the  seven  project  towns  and  the  overall  Project\nincludes the following: (i) least cost analysis of alternative water supply development options, (ii)\nderivation of the economic price\u2014the average incremental economic cost (AIEC) of water and\nwastewater  services,  (iii)  calculation  of  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  each\nsubproject  and  the  overall  Project,  (iv)  sensitivity  analysis,  (v)  distribution  analysis  of  project\nbenefits,  and  (vi)  poverty  impact  analysis.  The  detailed  economic  analysis  is  presented  in\nAppendix 9.\n\n76.\nThe least cost analysis, where applicable, compares the expected capital and operating\ncosts  of  alternative  development  options.  For  each  option,  capital  and  operating  cost  streams\nwere  compared  and  the  net  present  values  and  AIEC  calculated,  using  the  social  opportunity\ncost of capital (SOCC), assumed at 12 percent. The result indicates that the Project is the least\ncost  option.  The  AIEC  for  the  water  supply  and  wastewater  subproject  provides  a  measure  of\nthe  cost  per  cubic  meter  and  the  basis  of  tariffs  for  full  cost  recovery.  The  AIEC  is  the\ndiscounted value of incremental capital costs and operating costs (in economic prices) divided\nby the discounted volumes of incremental water sales as a result of the proposed investment.\nCapital  and  operating  costs  include  the  economic  cost  of  water,  sanitation,  and  drainage\ncomponents. The AIEC for the overall Project is estimated at D8,135/m3.\n\n77.\nThe calculation of the EIRRs for water supply components is based on the capital and\nO&M costs of the least cost alternative, including the cost of public sanitation facilities and any\nenvironmental  degradation.  The  valuation  of  the  nonincremental  benefits  is  based  on  the\naverage supply price of all sources in the without-project situation. This is used as the proxy for\nconsumers\u2019 willingness to pay. These include water from tubewell supplies, surface wells, and\nriver  sources  as  well  as  water  purchased  year-round  or  during  the  dry  season  from  water\nvendors or from households with piped supply. The EIRR for the overall project is 17.7 percent.\nThe EIRR calculated for each project town ranges from 13.7 percent to 19.9 percent, all higher\nthan  the  SOCC.  The  sensitivity  of  the  EIRRs  of  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  components\nwas tested against adverse changes in key variables, and the EIRRs exceed the SOCC in all\ntests. The Project is most sensitive to delays in project completion, where a two-year delay will\ncause the average EIRR to decline to 14.4 percent.\n\n78.\nAn  analysis  has  been  undertaken  to  measure  the  distribution  of  the  project  benefits  to\ndifferent participants in the Project, including the government, WSC, consumers, and laborers.\nThe analysis shows that while the Project has an overall economic net present value of D431\nbillion,  the  benefits  mainly  go  to  the  consumers  and  laborers.  A  poverty  impact  analysis  has\nbeen  carried  out  to  estimate  the  proportion  of  benefits  accruing  to  the  poor.  A  poverty  impact\nratio  is  derived  by  comparing  the  net  economic  benefits  to  the  poor  with  the  net  economic\nbenefits  to  the  economy  as  a  whole.  The  overall  poverty  impact  ratio  for  the  Project  is  34.7\npercent.\n\n2. \n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n79.\nThe financial analysis is undertaken to assess the (i) financial viability of each subproject\nand  the  overall  Project,  by  comparing  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  with  the\nweighted average cost of capital (WACC) used to finance each subproject as well as the overall\nProject;  (ii)  adequate  tariffs  required  to  achieve  financial  sustainability  for  the  WSCs,  and\nsubsidies incurred, by comparing the average tariff with the average incremental financial cost\n\n\f(AIFC);  (iii)  affordability  of  the  proposed  water  tariffs;  (iv)  sensitivity  of  the  FIRRs  to  adverse\nchanges in the key variables; and (v) financial projections for the WSCs.\n\n25\n\na. \n\nFIRR and AIFC\n\nThe overall FIRR for the Project water supply component is 3.2 percent, which is above\n80.\nthe 2.0 percent WACC. Therefore, the Project is considered financially viable. The FIRRs for the\nindividual  subprojects  in  the  five  provincial  towns  all  exceed  their  WACCs  and  are,  therefore,\nconsidered financially viable. While the FIRR for the district town Chi Thanh is below the WACC,\nwhen the three subprojects in Phu Yen Province (Chi Thanh, La Hai, Tuy Hoa) are considered\non a consolidated basis, the FIRR exceeds the WACC. Therefore, on a consolidated basis, the\nthree  Phu  Yen  subprojects  are  considered  to  be  financially  viable.  The  overall  AIFC,  which  is\nthe  minimum  tariff  required  for  full  cost  recovery,  for  all  project  water  supply  components  is\nD2,865/m3  of  water  sold.  For  the  individual  subprojects,  the  AIFC  ranges  from  a  low  of\nD2,790/m3 in Phan Rang to a high of D3,930/m3 in Chi Thanh. The cost of service in the district\ntowns  is  higher  than  that  for  the  provincial  towns  because  the  smaller  population  limits\neconomies  of  scale.  The  analysis  is  summarized  in  Table  8  and  details  are  presented  in\nAppendix 10.\n\nTable 8: Summary Results of the Financial Analysis\n\nSubproject\n\nFIRR\n(%)\n\nWACC\n(%)\n\nAverage Water Tariff\n(D/m3)\n\nChi Thanh\nLa Hai\nTuy Hoa\nPhu Yen Provincea\nPhan Rang\nRach Gia\nTay Ninh\nThu Dau Mot\n\nRequiredb\n3,460\n3,460\n3,460\n3,460\n3,080\n3,060\n3,240\n3,145\nNMc\n(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:10)(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:12)(cid:14)(cid:10)(cid:15)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:16)(cid:1)(cid:8)(cid:14)(cid:10)(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:10)(cid:13)(cid:6)(cid:17)(cid:10)(cid:16)(cid:18)(cid:1)(cid:19)(cid:10)b(cid:10)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:1)(cid:9)(cid:22)(cid:10)(cid:24)(cid:1)(cid:23)(cid:8)(cid:25)(cid:25)(cid:14)(cid:10)(cid:22)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:22)(cid:7)(cid:10)(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:30)(cid:31)(cid:10)(cid:4)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:28)(cid:24)(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:24)(cid:10)(cid:27)(cid:23)(cid:8)(cid:4)(cid:22)(cid:28)(cid:14)(cid:10)(cid:10)(cid:23)(cid:22) (cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:7)(cid:10)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:10)(cid:24)(cid:12)(cid:22)(cid:10)(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:30)(cid:31)!(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:31)\"\n\nActual 2000\n1,897\n1,897\n1,897\n1,897\n3,100\n2,405\n2,076\n2,665\nNMc\n\n(D million)\n-5,757\n1,533\n51,837\n47,613\n40,494\n6,330\n4,386\n14,775\n113,598\n\n1.8\n1.8\n1.8\n1.8\n1.7\n2.7\n2.2\n3.0\n2.0\n\n0.0\n2.5\n3.8\n3.3\n3.0\n3.0\n2.6\n3.4\n3.2\n\n Total\n\nAIFC\n(D/m3,\nCons. prices)\n3,930\n3,300\n2,900\n3,040\n2,790\n2,980\n3,140\n3,000\n2,865\n\nNPV\n\n(cid:1)\n(cid:27)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:8)(cid:18)(cid:7)(cid:10)(cid:25)(cid:18)(cid:23)(cid:10)#$(cid:11)(cid:28)(cid:10)(cid:24)(cid:18)(cid:10)(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:12)(cid:10)(cid:24)(cid:12)(cid:22)(cid:10)(cid:25)(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:1)(cid:5)(cid:10)(cid:24)(cid:1)(cid:23)(cid:9)(cid:22)(cid:24)(cid:28)(cid:19)(cid:10)c(cid:1)%&(cid:10)\u2019(cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:24)(cid:10)((cid:22)(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:9)(cid:25)(cid:6)(cid:5))\nSource: WSCs documents and ADB estimates.\n\nb.\n\nAverage Tariff Requirements, Affordability, and Willingness to Pay\n\nAs shown in Table 8, the average tariff requirements for the project towns are relatively\n81.\nsimilar, ranging from a low of D3,060/m3 for Rach Gia to a high of D3,460/m3 for the three towns\nin  Phu  Yen  province.  These  average  tariff  requirements  are  expressed  on  a  constant  price\nbasis.  An  affordability  analysis  has  been  undertaken  to  ensure  that  households,  particularly\nthose low-income groups, comprising households earning an amount at or below the average of\nthe  bottom  20th  percentile  of  income  distribution,  can  afford  the  proposed  water  tariffs.  The\ntariffs are considered affordable if expenditure on water does not exceed 5 percent of household\nincome.  The  tariffs  are  considered  affordable  for  the  median  income  households  in  all  of  the\nproject towns over the 2002-2014 period. While the tariffs may appear high for the low-income\nhouseholds in La Hai during 2008-2010, this is partly a result of conservative assumption on the\ngrowth  of  their  future  incomes.  Further,  the  piped  water  supply  represents  significant  cost\nsavings compared with other alternatives. The results of this analysis are summarized in Table\n9.\n\n\fTable 9: Affordability Analysis\n\nPercentage of Income to Pay Water Bill\n\n2002\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\n2014\n\nSubproject Town\n\nChi Thanh\n\nLa Hai\n\nPhan Rang\n\nMedian Income Household\nLow Income Household\n\nMedian Income Household\nLow Income Household\n\nMedian Income Household\nLow Income Household\n\nMedian Income Household\nLow Income Household\n\nRach Gia\n\nTay Ninh\n\nMedian Income Household\nLow Income Household\n\nThu Dau Mot\n\nMedian Income Household\nLow Income Household\n\nTuy Hoa\n\nMedian Income Household\nLow Income Household\n\n    Source: ADB estimates.\n\n26\n\n2.2\n3.1\n\n2.8\n4.4\n\n2.6\n2.8\n\n2.2\n2.0\n\n2.3\n2.6\n\n1.5\n1.8\n\n1.6\n1.7\n\n3.7\n4.7\n\n4.8\n6.6\n\n3.0\n2.8\n\n2.7\n2.0\n\n2.9\n2.7\n\n1.6\n1.6\n\n2.6\n2.5\n\n3.7\n4.6\n\n4.8\n6.4\n\n2.8\n2.6\n\n2.8\n2.0\n\n3.0\n2.7\n\n1.6\n1.5\n\n2.7\n2.4\n\n3.4\n3.9\n\n4.4\n5.4\n\n2.4\n2.1\n\n3.0\n1.9\n\n3.1\n2.5\n\n1.5\n1.3\n\n2.4\n2.1\n\n82.\nAn  assessment  of  the  willingness  of  consumers  to  pay  the  tariffs  has  also  been\nundertaken  on  the  basis  of  the  socioeconomic  survey  carried  out  during  the  Project  feasibility\nstudy. In general, for households presently connected to piped water supply, the willingness to\npay  was  higher  than  those  not  connected.  In  Rach  Gia,  Thu  Dau  Mot,  and  Tuy  Hoa  the\nproposed  tariffs  for  2002  are  generally  within  the  existing  willingness  to  pay  for  households\npresently  having  piped  water  connections.  For  the  other  towns,  tariff  requirements  in  2002\nexceed  the  willingness  to  pay  by  about  30  percent  (Tay  Ninh)  to  100  percent  (Chi  Thanh,  La\nHai,  Phan  Rang).  For  those  not  presently  connected,  the  projected  tariff  requirements  exceed\nthe existing willingness to pay in all towns.\n\n83.\nThe  survey  results  likely  underestimate  the  willingness  to  pay.  In  Phan  Rang  and  Tay\nNinh, current water bills for a typical household exceed the reported willingness to pay for those\nconnected to the system and yet there appears to be little resistance to payment. Willingness to\npay is also a function of present levels of service, which are low in all of the towns. For those not\npresently connected to the piped water supply system, it was observed during the socioeconomic\nsurvey that households often had difficulty estimating the total cost of their nonpiped water supply\nand, therefore, their willingness to pay for piped water. This indicates the importance of the PHAP,\nwhich  is  expected  to  increase  the  awareness  of  the  households  of  the  value  of  piped  water\nsupply.\n\nc. \n\nSensitivity Analysis\n\n84.\nThe sensitivity of the FIRRs is tested against adverse changes in selected key variables:\n(i)  increases  in  capital  costs,  (ii)  increases  in  O&M  costs,  (iii)  reductions  in  revenues,  (iv)\nreductions in savings from lower UFW; (v) reduction in projected number of water connections,\nand (vi) delays in the completion of the subproject. The FIRR is most sensitive to a reduction in\nincremental revenues derived from the water tariffs. These are presented in Table 10.\n\n\fKey Variable\nBase Case\nCapital Cost\nO&M Costs\nTariff Revenues/Water Sales\nUFW Cost Savings\nNew Connections\nProject Completion Delay\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\nTable 10: FIRR Sensitivity Analysis\n\n27\n\nChange\n\n+10\n+10\n-10\n-10\n-20\n1 Year\n2 Years\n\nSIa\n\n2.63\n1.33\n4.15\n0.19\n3.23\n\nSVb\n\n+14.3\n+27.0\n-8.9\nN/Ac\n\nFIRR\n3.16\n2.33\n2.74\n1.85\n3.10\n1.08\n2.65\n2.18\n\na  SI = sensitivity indicator, the ratio of percentage change in FIRR to change in parameter;\nb  SV = switching value, the percentage change in parameter sufficient to reduce the FIRR to equal WACC;\nc  N/A = not applicable: the FIRR exceeds the WACC even if UFW cost savings are reduced to zero.\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nd. \n\nFinancial Projections of WSCs\n\n85.\nFinancial projections have been prepared for each of the five WSCs in order to assess\nthe impact of the proposed Project on the financial viability and sustainability of the companies.\nThe  financial  projections  are  based  on  the  key  financial  performance  objectives  set  for  the\nWSCs  over  the  projection  period:  (i)  generating  revenues  sufficient  to  cover  all  cash  O&M\nexpenses and depreciation expense or debt repayment (whichever is greater), and a net income\nsufficient to cover bonus and welfare fund contributions; (ii) maintaining a cash balance at the\nend  of  each  year  equivalent  to  no  less  than  30  days  worth  of  annual  cash  O&M  expenditures\nplus debt service; (iii) maintaining a current ratio at no less than 1.0 as of the end of each year;\nand (iv) improving the financial positions to self-finance an increasing proportion of the annual\ncapital expenditure requirements.\n\n86.\nThe  financial  performance  of  the  WSCs  improves  over  the  2000\u20132014  forecast  period\nwith  the  increase  of  water  tariffs.  However,  due  to  the  need  for  the  phased  implementation  of\nthe tariff increases and because of the impact of debt service obligations for the subprojects, all\nof  the  WSCs  will experience  short-term periods of weaker performance. With the exception of\nthe  Kien  Giang  WSC,  the  WSCs  are  not  expected  to  achieve  the  financial  objectives  set  out\nabove  in  all  years.  However,  the  overall  financial  performance  and  position  of  the  WSCs  is\nexpected to be sufficient to maintain adequate levels of cash during all periods. Therefore, the\nprojected  financial  performance  of  the  WSCs  is  considered  satisfactory.  Key  performance\nindicators are shown in Table 11.\n\ne. \n\nSubsidies\n\n87. Water tariffs in the project towns are substantially below the full cost recovery levels. To\nsupport  the  Government  policy  of  gradually  reducing  the  subsidies  to  the  water  supply  sector\nand  achieving  full  cost  recovery  from  beneficiaries,  the  Project  will  require  PPCs  under  the\nProject to substantially increase water tariffs during 2004-2008. Further, the Project intends to\nmake  transparent  the  cross  subsidies  between  the  different  revenue  sources  within  a  WSC.\nWSCs  are  required  to  establish  separate  accounting  for  costs  and  revenues  from  water  sales\nand  those  from  other  sources,  such  as  construction.  To  enable  the  low-income  households  to\nhave  private  connections  to  the  piped  water  supply,  the  WSCs  will  allow  these  households  to\npay the cost of house connection by installments. There is a hidden interest subsidy. Under the\nproposed sanitation credit schemes, the lending rate will be the same as those offered by the\nBank  for  the  Poor,  which  is  lower  than  the  prevailing  market  rates,  reflecting  a  subsidy  in  the\ncost  of  funds  to  the  low-income  households.  This  is  deemed  acceptable  considering  the\n\n\faffordability  of  low-income  households,  their  need  for  improved  living  conditions,  and  the\nassociated positive externalities.\n\nTable 11: Key Performance Indicators of WSCs\n\n2001\n\n2008\n\n2014\n\n28\n\n      12,400\n        6,400\n          168\n           1.2\n75\n3\n\n      12,400\n        6,100\n          262\n           6.2\n18\n22\n\n        5,500\n        3,800\n          350\n         20.2\n0\nNA\n\n        5,800\n        3,600\n          471\n           9.5\n0\n6\n\n        4,400\n        1,300\n          215\n         26.3\n19\n7\n\n    33,600\n    23,300\n        131\n         3.0\n87\n788\n\n    26,700\n    35,300\n        339\n         6.9\n51\n451\n\n    13,700\n    11,800\n        126\n         1.8\n156\n164\n\n    12,700\n    17,500\n        207\n         2.1\n113\n501\n\n     9,700\n    11,100\n        249\n         3.7\n97\n619\n\n    56,100\n    55,100\n        204\n         6.9\n61\n124\n\n    38,200\n    75,500\n        401\n         9.6\n34\n140\n\n    38,200\n    35,400\n        191\n         3.5\n93\n296\n\n    26,700\n    48,600\n        378\n         4.4\n80\n297\n\n    16,200\n    19,900\n        283\n         5.9\n64\n150\n\n Binh Duong WSDC\n\n Ninh Thuan WSC\n\n Kien Giang WSDC\n\nWater Sales (m3/d)\nCash Balance (D million)\nCash (Days Worth of Cash Obligations)\nCurrent Ratio\nDebt - Equity Ratio (%)\nSelf Financing Ratio (%) - Annual\n\nWater Sales (m3/d)\nCash Balance (D million)\nCash (Days Worth of Cash Obligations)\nCurrent Ratio\nDebt - Equity Ratio (%)\nSelf Financing Ratio (%) - Annual\n\nWater Sales (m3/d)\nCash Balance (D million)\nCash (Days Worth of Cash Obligations)\nCurrent Ratio\nDebt - Equity Ratio (%)\nSelf Financing Ratio (%) - Annual\n\nWater Sales (m3/d)\nCash Balance (D million)\nCash (Days Worth of Cash Obligations)\nCurrent Ratio\nDebt - Equity Ratio (%)\nSelf Financing Ratio (%) - Annual\n\nWater Sales (m3/d)\nCash Balance (D million)\nCash (Days Worth of Cash Obligations)\nCurrent Ratio\nDebt - Equity Ratio (%)\nSelf Financing Ratio (%) - Annual\n\n Phu Yen WSC\n\n Tay Ninh WSDC\n\nm3/d = cubic meter per day\nSource:  ADB estimates.\n\nB. \n\nEnvironment\n\n88.\nThe water sources of most Project towns are of good quality and sufficient yield, while\nthose of Rach Gia suffer from saline intrusion during dry season and of Chi Thanh from organic\npollution resulting from agricultural and animal wastes. The raw water reservoir in Rach Gia and\nborefield in Chi Thanh will provide raw water of better quality, reduce the potential for pollution,\nand  minimize  water  treatment  costs.  The  Project  is  designed  to  deliver  24-hour,  fully\npressurized  water  supply  systems,  and  thereby  ensure  the  supply  of  safe  drinking  water  by\neliminating the risk of contamination of the water supply from groundwater infiltration under low\npressure or vacuum condition. Higher supply pressures will also improve fire-fighting capabilities\nin the towns and reduce the cost of fire damage to buildings and property.\n\n\f29\n\n89.\nThe  project  towns  have  combined  drainage  systems  that  carry  both  storm  water  and\nwastewater. However the coverage of drainage systems is limited and their functions are less\nthan  satisfactory  due  to  poor  design  and  maintenance.  The  systems  will  be  cleaned  and\nrehabilitated where necessary, and sewage pipes installed in high and medium density areas to\nsupplement  septic  tanks  and  existing  drains.  In  low-density  areas,  where  adequate  drains  do\nnot  exist,  septic  tank  effluent  and  sewage  will  be  discharged  to  soakaways.  Septic  tank\ncoverage will be raised through regulations, public health awareness programs, and sanitation\ncredit  schemes.  Sanitation  improvements  will  also  be  carried  out  in  schools  and  public  areas\nsuch as markets.\n\nThe groundwater in some project areas is contaminated by pit latrines, septic tanks, and\n90.\ndrainage  systems.  While  expanding \nthe  piped  water  supply  system  and  sanitation\nimprovements will not eliminate groundwater contamination, it will prevent further contamination\nof  groundwater  and  improve  its  quality  over  time.  In  Thu  Dau  Mot,  excessive  exploitation  of\ngroundwater  has  substantially  lowered  the  groundwater  table,  and  saline  intrusion  in  both\nsurface water and groundwater is a problem in Rach Gia and Tuy Hoa. Improved piped water\nsupply  systems  will  reduce  dependence  on  contaminated  water  sources,  and  minimize  the\npotential for further lowering of water tables and salination of groundwater. Greater coverage of\nseptic  tanks,  drainage  improvements,  and  adoption  of  proper  standards  for  septic  tanks  and\nsoakaways  will  also  help \ninitial\nenvironmental examination is presented in Appendix 11.\n\nto  reduce  groundwater  contamination.  The  summary \n\nC. \n\nSocial Dimensions and Impact on Poverty\n\nParticipatory methods, such as workshops, rapid assessment, focus groups discussions,\n91.\nand surveys, have been employed in formulating the Project throughout the feasibility study, to\nensure  that  the  needs  and  demands  of  the  weaker  social  groups,  such  as  women,  ethnic\nminorities, and the poor, will be taken into consideration. During project implementation, WSCs\nwill be trained in community consultation techniques, analysis of customer feedback, and other\nareas  to  improve  participation.  The  public  health  awareness  programs,  the  community\nenvironmental sanitation improvement programs, and the sanitation credit schemes will all use\nparticipatory approaches. Women will benefit from increased knowledge of safe water practices,\npersonal  hygiene,  and  awareness  of  the  linkage  between  water,  sanitation,  and  health.\nConveniently  available  safe  water  will  reduce  the  time  spent  by  women  on  collecting  water  or\ncaring  for  other  household  members  who  are  ill  from  unsafe  water  or  poor  hygiene,  allowing\nthem  to  spend  more  time  on  improving  their  living  conditions.  Increased  interaction  with  the\nVMU and other agencies will enhance their social contacts and reduce isolation.\n\n92.\nThe Project will have significant and positive impacts on the poor. Access to piped water\nwill significantly reduce the time and cost of the poor in collecting and storing water. The poor\noften walk or cycle long distances (400\u20131,000 meters) daily or more to collect water for drinking\nif  they  have  no  safe  and  reliable  source  nearby,  or  when  existing  wells  are  dried  up,  become\nsaline during the dry season, or are contaminated by flood water during the wet season. Piped\nwater  availability  will  result  in  increased  water  purchasing  power  for  the  same  household\nbudget. Greater use of piped water (including for washing dishes, bathing, and washing clothes)\nwill improve health and reduce risk of infection or illness from polluted sources, and increase the\ntime available for income generating, education, and health care. The sanitation credit schemes\nand water connection credits to poor households will help them improve their living conditions\nand reduce the risk of illness and incapacity. Other positive social impacts include (i) improving\nWSCs'  understanding  of  their  customers'  and  communities'  needs  and  preferences;  (ii)\nimproving WSCs\u2019 communication skills in consulting the communities; (iii) greater openness and\n\n\f30\n\naccountability  of  local  governments;  (iv)  greater  public  participation  in  decision  making  and\nplanning, leading to a high level of ownership and increased public support for the Project; (v)\nincreased  cooperation  between  authorities  from  different  sectors  e.g.,  health,  education,\ncommunity,  town  administration,  and  water  supply.  A  summary  social  analysis  is  presented  in\nAppendix 12.\n\nD.\n\nRisks\n\n93.\nThe main risks related to the Project are (i) inadequate capacity of the PPCs and WSCs\nfor  implementing  the  Project;  (ii)  failure  of  WSCs  to  collect  adequate  tariffs  to  cover  the  O&M\ncost  and  debt  service  payments;  and  (iii)  inadequate  maintenance,  affecting  long-term\nsustainability  of  the  completed  project  infrastructure.  The  limited  capacity  of  provincial\norganizations  could  lead  to  delays  and  additional  costs.  None  of  the  five  provinces  have\nexperience  with  projects  financed  by  multilateral  aid  agencies.  The  staff  at  WSCs  and  other\nprovincial-level  agencies  generally  lack  knowledge  of  ADB  procedures  and  the  skills  to\nimplement the Project. To mitigate this risk, the Project will provide adequate initial training on\nproject  management,  and  will  require  that  PPCs  and  WSCs  ensure  that  skilled  personnel  and\nother resources are available in the province for the Project.\n\n94.\nThe key risks to the financial sustainability of the WSCs are uncertainty regarding tariff\nrevenues and the number of water supply connections. Adequate tariff is particularly important\nover  the  2008\u20132010  period  when  the  WSCs  are  expected  to  commence  debt  service  on  the\nProject. PPCs are required to conduct public education on cost recovery and tariff increases. It\nis equally important that new customers be connected to the system as rapidly as possible. The\npublic health awareness program will be essential in encouraging households to connect to the\npiped water supply system.\n\n95.\nA major risk to the Project could stem from inadequate maintenance of the rehabilitated\nand  new  facilities.  The  Project  will  assist  the  WSCs  to  conduct  asset  inventories  and  prepare\nO&M  plans  and  guidelines  based  on  appropriate  engineering  practice.  These  plans  and\nguidelines will be used by WSCs to ensure adequate budgetary allocation for proper preventive\nmaintenance. O&M equipment provided under the Project and staff training will also assist the\nWSCs to ensure the sustainability of the water and sanitation systems.\n\nA.\n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nAs a condition for the effectiveness of the Loan Agreement, ADB will be assured of the\n\n96.\neffectiveness of the loan agreement between the Government and AFD.\n\nB. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n97.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\nThe Government agreed that (a) ADB and AFD funds will be relent to the WSCs\nin  Vietnamese  dong  under  subsidiary  loan  agreements,  whose  terms  and\nconditions are acceptable to ADB and AFD; and (b) the Government will assume\nthe  foreign  exchange  risk,  and  the  subsidiary  loans  will  have  a  maturity  of  22\n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vii) \n\n31\n\nyears  with  a  grace  period  of  6  years,  and  a  fixed  interest  rate  of  6  percent  per\nannum.\n\nPPCs and WSCs will ensure that the approved resettlement plans are carried out\npromptly  and  efficiently.  After  designs  are  finalized  and  before  issuance  of  the\ntender  documents  for  the  construction  works  of  the  water  supply  components,\nWSCs  will  submit  to  ADB  for  approval  detailed  implementation  plans  showing,\namong  others,  the  actual  number  of  affected  persons  and  asset  inventories\n(Appendix  7,  para.  3)  and  final  budget.  WSCs  will  ensure  that  the  resettlement\nplans  and  any  amendments,  will  be  accessible  by  people  affected,  in  the\nVietnamese language.\n\nBefore  awarding  the  contracts  for  the  water  supply  components,  the  WSCs  will\nhave  completed  land  acquisition,  compensation,  and  resettlement  processes,\nand  obtained  rights  of  entry  to  private  properties  for  both  construction  and\nmaintenance of the water supply pipelines.\n\nPPCs  will  ensure  that  funds  are  provided  according  to  the  resettlement  plans,\nand will meet any obligations in excess of the budgeted amounts as necessary to\nmeet  the  resettlement  objectives  to  restore  or  improve  incomes  and  living\nstandards of affected people.\n\nPPCs will ensure that there will be independent M&E of the implementation of the\nresettlement  plans  both  during  the  implementation  of  the  plans  and  one  year\nafter  their  completion.  If  any  affected  households  are  facing  difficulty  with\nlivelihood  restoration,  the  PPC  will  take  additional  mitigation  measures  and\nquickly resolve the problems.\n\n(vi)  WSCs will report quarterly the progress of the land acquisition and resettlement\nthrough the quarterly progress reports, and through a report to be submitted one\nyear after the completion of the resettlement and five years thereafter.\n\nBy  31  December  2004,  the  PPCs  will  introduce  sanitation  regulations  requiring,\namong others (a) connecting sullage drains and septic tanks to drains in high and\nmedium  density  areas,  and  to  drains  or  properly  designed  and  constructed\nsoakaways in low density areas; (b) providing a septic tank that meets prescribed\nstandards in each household or business in high and medium density areas; (c)\nallowing  piped  water  supply  connection  only  when  sullage  pipes  discharging  to\ndrains  or  properly  constructed  soakaways  are  provided  for;  (d)  preventing\npollution  in  the  vicinity  of  surface  intakes  and  borefields;  (e)  controlling  and\nmonitoring  activities  in  catchments  upstream  of  water  supply  intakes  and\nborefields;  (f)  enforcing  regulations  on  treatment  and  discharge  of  industrial\nwastewater; \nindustrial,  commercial,  and  domestic  use  of\ngroundwater in sensitive areas; and (h) banning industrial and commercial use of\ngroundwater  in  areas  where  piped  water  supply  is  available.  The  PPCs  will\nenforce  universal  compliance  with  the  sanitation  regulations  by  31  December\n2006.\n\nlicensing \n\n(g) \n\n(viii)  By  31  December  2002,  the  PPCs  will  have  introduced  the  water  tariff  structure\nand \nthe\nmemorandum of understanding between ADB and each province. The tariffs will\n\ntariffs  as  agreed  with  ADB  and  reflected \n\nincreased  water \n\nin \n\n\f32\n\nreviewed  by  project  consultants  and  adjusted  every \n\nbe \ntwo  years.\nRecommendations from the consultants will be the basis for discussion between\nthe PPCs, WSCs, and ADB with regard to further tariff adjustments.\n\n(ix) \n\nPPCs  and  WSCs  will  take  all  measures  to  ensure  proper  management  and\neffective O&M of sanitation and drainage systems, including (a) implementing a\nseptic  tank  management  system  to  ensure  that  all  septic  tanks  in  the  water\nsupply  service  area  are  registered,  and  are  desludged  at  2-3  year  intervals;  (b)\nprovision of adequate desludging tankers and safe sludge disposal facilities; and\n(c) provision of adequate equipment for O&M of drains.\n\n(x)  WSCs will ensure that (a) leak detection teams will be established with adequate\nequipment  and  training,  which  will  implement  the  UFW  program;  (b)  bulk  water\nmeters  will  be  installed  at  treatment  plants  and  at  critical  points  in  the  network,\nand  will  be  regularly  calibrated;  and  (c)  UFW  will  be  monitored  and  reported  to\nWSC management on a monthly basis.\n\n(xi)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  WSCs  will  have  prepared  a  credit\npolicy to allow low-income households to pay for house connection and the meter\nby installments over 18 months.\n\n(xii)  Within  one  year  of  the  fielding  of  the  design  consultants,  the  WSCs  will  have\nseparated  the  accounts  of  construction  activities  from  those  of  water  supply\noperations.\n\n(xiii)  PPCs  and  WSCs  will  take  all  measures  to  ensure  financial  sustainability  and\nsound  management,  including (a)  setting  water  tariffs  at  levels  to  cover  O&M\ncosts plus depreciation or debt service, whichever is higher, and generating a net\nincome  sufficient  to  cover  bonus  and  welfare  fund  contributions;  (b)  increasing\nannual  expenditures  on  O&M  to  match,  at  a  minimum,  the  increase  in  the\nquantity of water produced and the domestic inflation; (c) maintaining a positive\ncash flow and a cash balance at the year end equivalent to no less than 30 days\nworth  of  annual  cash  O&M  expenditures  plus  debt  service;  (d)  maintaining  a\ncurrent  ratio  at  no  less  than  1.0  as  of  the  end  of  each  year;  (e)  maintaining\naccounts  receivable  at  no  more  than  45  days  of  sales  equivalent;  and  (f)  self-\nfinancing  an \nthe  annual  capital  expenditure\nrequirements.\n\nincreasing  proportion  of \n\n(xiv)  Within  six  months  of  fielding  of  the  design  consultants,  the  PPMUs  will  have\nsubmitted  to  the  PCU  a  detailed  implementation  plan  for  establishing  M&E\nbenchmarks.  PPMUs  will  coordinate  the  M&E  activities  in  the  province  and\nprepare  and  submit  annual  M&E  reports  to  the  PCU  within  six  months  of  the\nclose of each fiscal year.\n\n(xv)  Provincial  VWUs,  with  assistance  from  consultants  and  in  consultation  with  the\nPPMUs and local governments, will develop sanitation credit terms acceptable to\nADB  for  the  use  of  CESI

This appendix summarizes the RPs for the five WSCs, including the resettlement\nimpacts, the land required, the households to be relocated, the affected persons (APs), and the\nresettlement policy.\n\nB.\n\nResettlement Impacts\n\n2.\nThe Project will require a total of about 68 hectares (ha), mostly in small pieces (10 ha or\nless)  for  water  treatment  plants,  transmission  and  distribution  mains,  and  for  one  raw  water\nreservoir, the single largest land acquisition required. Although only 71 households will need to\nbe  relocated,  there  will  be  about  900  APs.  Most  of  changes  will  be  disturbance  to  yards,  not\nhouse  demolition.  Table  A7.1  provides  a  summary  of  resettlement  impacts  of  permanent  and\ntemporary land acquisition, for each project town.\n\nTable A7.1: Assessments of Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n\nProject Town\n\nChi Thanh\nLa Hai\nPhan Rang\nRach Gia\nTay Ninh\nThu Dau Mot\nTuy Hoa\n\nTOTAL\n\nPermanent Land\nAcquisition (ha)\n5.38\n0.20\n1.79\n16.01\n2.02\n30.00\n12.69\n68.09\n\nTemporary Land\nAcquisition (ha)\n0.74\n0.00\n1.28\n17.10\n0.00\n0.00\n0.72\n19.84\n\nNumber of Households\nto be Resettled\n0\n0\n39\n14\n8\n10\n0\n71\n\nNumber of Affected\nPersons\n18\n5\n195\n195\n220\n86\n185\n904\n\nNote:  In some provinces, these estimates may be revised once detailed designs are completed.\nSource: Resettlement Plans of project provinces.\n\n3.\nThe WSC for each town will prepare an inventory for each stage of construction. Each\ninventory will include (i) baseline information; (ii) detailed compensation and other rehabilitation\nentitlements  for  each  AP;  (iii)  location,  area,  and  category  of  the  replacement  residential  and\nagricultural land to be provided, if applicable; (iv) a time-bound action plan for implementation;\nand (v) a detailed budget and source of funding for the various compensation and rehabilitation\nmeasures. The baseline information for the RP will be completed one month prior to issuance of\nbid invitation for water supply contracts in each province. Specifically, the inventory will include:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nnumber of people and main occupation and level of income;\nnumber, type, and area of the house acquired;\nnumber and area of residential plot acquired;\nnumber, category, and area of agricultural land acquired;\nquantity and types of crops and trees acquired;\nquantity and category of other fixed assets affected by the Project; and\ntemporary damage to productive assets.\n\nC.\n\nSocioeconomic Survey\n\nA  socioeconomic  survey  has  been  conducted  among  APs.  The  RP  for  each  provincial\n4.\nproject  management  unit  (PPMU)  includes  summary  findings  of  the  baseline  socioeconomic\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 7, page 2\n\nsurvey based on a representative sample of affected households. It describes AP occupations,\nsources of income, and educational levels.\n\nD.\n\nPoverty Alleviation Issues\n\n5.\nThe  number  of  displaced  people  is  small  and  the  degree  of  impact  on  other  APs  is\nminor.  Consequently,  it  was  not  appropriate  to  have  special  income  restoration  measures.\nNonetheless, all households will be closely monitored to ensure their livelihoods are adequately\nrestored  as  quickly  as  possible.  Based  on  the  results  of  monitoring  for  any  household  facing\neconomic  difficulties,  the  spell  (PPC)  will  identify  and  take  mitigation  actions  to  resolve  the\nproblem. In some provinces, WSCs may offer direct employment.\n\nE.\n\nLegal Framework\n\n6.\nThe legal framework governing the implementation of RPs is Article 27 of the 1993 Land\nLaw  and  Decree  No.  22/1998/ND-CP.  The  Land  Law  of  1993,  a  comprehensive  land\nadministration  law,  states  that  land  belongs  to  the  people,  with  the  state  as  its  sole\nadministrator,  reserving  the  right  to  allocate  land  and  determine  its  usage.  Families  and\nindividuals who have been allocated land have the right to exchange their land, transfer the use\nrights  to  others,  rent  the  land  for  a  period  of  three  years,  bequeath  it,  or  use  it  as  collateral.\nDecree No. 22 of 1998 sets out the policy and regulations governing compensation for damage\nwhen  the  state  recovers  land  for  public  purposes.  It  defines  the  persons  entitled  to  receive\ncompensation,  the  method  of  calculating  compensation  for  land  and  for  property  damage,\nprovisions  for  temporary  relocation,  and  support  for  permanent  relocation.  The  decree  also\noutlines  the  requirements  for  setting  up  resettlement  areas;  defines  the  responsibilities  of\ncentral,  provincial,  and  town  level  institutions  for  assessment  and  payment  of  compensation;\nand confirms the right of complaint for APs and the procedure for complaint resolution.\n\nF.\n\nResettlement Policy and Compensation Standards\n\n7.\nA  project-specific  resettlement  policy  has  been  developed  and  is  similar  for  each\nprovince.  The  RPs  include  summary  details  of  the  number  and  categories  of  APs,  losses  and\ncompensation  entitlements  as  negotiated  and  agreed  with  APs,  and  details  of  community\nconsultations conducted. The specific compensation rates have been established and approved\nby  each  PPC.  APs  are  entitled  to  the  following  types  of  compensation  and  rehabilitation\nmeasures:  compensation  for  loss  of  property,  land,  and  nonfarm  commercial  income;  and\nrehabilitation measures. Procedures for determining compensation and rehabilitation measures\nare substantially in accordance with Decree No. 22/ND-CP.\n\nG.\n\nOrganizational Arrangements\n\n8.\nThe overall responsibility for enforcement of the resettlement policy rests with the PPC.\nIn  coordination  with  the  town  people\u2019s  committees  (TPC)  and  district  people\u2019s  committees\n(DPC),  each  WSC  is  responsible  for  preparing  inventories  and  resettlement  plans  for\nimplementation  within  their  jurisdiction.  The  ward  people\u2019s  committees  (WPCs)  and  commune\npeople\u2019s  committees  (CPCs)  will  ensure  the  active  and  effective  participation  of  APs  in  the\npreparation  of  the  inventories  and  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plans.  The  PPCs  will\nprovide  the  funds  necessary  to  implement  these  based  on  budgets  established  by  the  DPCs\nand TPCs. The WSCs will be responsible for implementing the RPs, under the direction of the\nPPCs. All WSCs and PPCs and some of the TPCs and DPCs, have recent experience in land\nacquisition and resettlement.\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 7, page 3\n\nH.\n\nConsultation, Information Disclosure, and Grievance Procedures\n\n9.\nWSCs have held public consultations with APs, providing full information concerning the\nprovisions of the resettlement policy framework and the opportunity to voice concerns. Prior to\npayment, local government officials will ensure that each AP household has been fully informed\nby WSCs of their entitlements and rehabilitation choices. Complaints and grievances related to\nany aspect of the inventories and RPs, including the area to be acquired and the price of assets\nlost, will be handled as follows, with APs exempted from all administrative and legal fees:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nAPs  will  present  their  complaints  and  grievances  to  the  WPC  or  CPC  (or  to  a\nspecially  established  resettlement  committee),  which  will  have  to  provide  a\nwritten response to the AP within 15 calendar days of receiving the complaint.\nIf  not  satisfied  with  the  decision  of  the  WPC  or  CPC,  the  AP  may  present  the\ncase to the DPC or TPC within 15 days of receiving a written response from the\nWPC or CPC.\nIf  not  satisfied  with  the  decision  of  the  DPC  or  TPC,  the  AP  can  appeal  to  the\nPPC.\nIf the AP is not satisfied with the decision of the PPC, the case may be submitted\nfor consideration to the district court.\n\nI. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n10.\nThe RPs for the PPMUs contain detailed costs of compensation and other rehabilitation\nentitlements and relocation costs of APs, with a breakdown by agricultural land, residential land,\nstructures,  and  other  assets.  The  cost  estimates  have  made  adequate  provision  for\ncontingencies.\n\nJ. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\nImplementation of the Resettlement Plans will be regularly supervised and monitored by\n11.\nthe  PPMU  in  coordination  with  the  people\u2019s  committees.  The  findings  will  be  recorded  in\nquarterly  reports  to  be  furnished  to  the  provincial  steering  committees  (PSCs)  and  the  (ADB),\nthrough the project coordination unit at the central level. An independent agency or agencies will\nbe engaged to periodically carry out external monitoring and evaluation of the inventories and\nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plans.  The  independent  monitor(s)  will  be  academic  or\nresearch  institutes,  nongovernment  organizations,  or  independent  consulting  firms,  all  with\nqualified  and  experienced  staff  and  terms  of  reference  acceptable  to  ADB.

The analysis includes the following: (i) least\ncost  analysis  of  alternative  water  supply  project  options;  (ii)  derivation  of  the  economic  price\u2014\naverage incremental economic cost (AIEC) of water and wastewater services; (iii) calculation of the\neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) and net present value (NPV) for each subproject and the\noverall Project; (iv) sensitivity analysis; (v) distribution analysis of project benefits; and (vi) poverty\nimpact analysis.\n\nB. \n\nEconomic Cost of Water\n\n2.\nThe  AIEC  for  the  water  supply  (and  wastewater)  subprojects  provides  a  measure  of  the\neconomic cost of water per cubic meter (m3) of the Project. The AIEC is the discounted value of\nincremental  capital  costs  and  operating  costs  (in  economic  prices)  divided  by  the  discounted\nquantity of incremental water sales as a result of the Project. The discount rate used is the social\nopportunity cost of capital (SOCC) assumed at 12 percent. The AIEC ranges from D7,095/m3 for\nLa Hai to D9,160/ m3 for Tay Ninh and an overall average of D8,135/m3.\n\nC. \n\nEconomic Rate of Return\n\nThe EIRRs for water supply subprojects are based on the least cost alternatives including\n3.\nthe  cost  of  public  sanitation  facilities  and  any  environmental  degradation.  The  valuation  of  the\nnonincremental benefits is based on the average supply price of all sources in the without-Project\nsituation,  which  is  made  up  of  water  from  tubewell,  surface  wells,  rivers,  water  vendors,  or\nhouseholds with piped supply. Incremental sales are valued at the proposed financial tariffs. The\nEIRR for the overall project is 17.7 percent. The EIRR calculated for the water supply component\nin  each  project  town  and  the  overall  Project,  together  with  the  net  present  value  (NPV)  are\nsummarized in Table A9.1. EIRRs of all the subprojects and the overall Project exceed the SOCC\nof 12 percent.\n\nTable A9.1: Summary of EIRR of Projects Replace with Revised Table and Notes\n\nTown\n\nEIRR (%)\n\nThu Dau Mot\nRach Gia\nPhan Rang\nChi Thanh\nLa Hai\nTuy Hoa\nTay Ninh\n\nNPV (D million)\n153,451\n147,462\n36,549\n63,886\n14,979\n2,753\n12,224\n431,305\n\nWSC\nBinh Duong\nKen Giang\nNinh Thuan\nPhu Yen\nPhu Yen\nPhu Yen\nTay Ninh\nOverall Project\nNotes: (i) taxes and duties deducted, tradable inputs adjusted by the shadow exchange rate factor of 1.11, and unskilled\nlabor assumes a shadow wage rate factor of 0.65; (ii) nonincremental sales\u2014domestic and institutional benefit valued at\neconomic value of non-piped water, incremental sales\u2014valued at the proposed financial tariffs; (iii) Tuy Hoa: assume in\nwithout-Project case a 20 percent decrease in water production from existing 7,000 m3/d; (iv) Chi Thanh: assume existing\nsystem collapses, and in with-Project case, benefiting additional 800 m3/d; (v) Tay Ninh: assume existing production of\n500  m3/d  ceases  in  without-Project  situation;  (vi)  50%  of  UFW  assumed  to  be  consumed  as  nontechnical  losses;  (viii)\nwillingness to pay for connection averages D400,000 per new connection.\n\nAIEC (D/m3)\n8,630\n7,579\n7,692\n7,920\n7,095\n8,564\n9,160\n8,135\n\n19.0\n19.9\n15.4\n16.8\n18.8\n14.2\n13.7\n17.7\n\n \n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\nD. \n\nSensitivity Analysis\n\n4.\nThe sensitivity of the EIRR for each subproject and the weighted average EIRR of the overall\nProject  was  tested  against  adverse  changes  in  key  variables:  (i)  increases  in  capital  costs;  (ii)\nincreases in operating and maintenance (O&M) costs; (iii) reductions in revenues; (iv) reductions in\nwillingness  to  pay  (expressed  in  terms  of  resource  cost  savings);  (v)  a  reduction  in  the  projected\nnumber of new water connections attributable to the subproject; and (vi) delays in the completion of\nsubproject  construction.  In  the  case  of  reduced  number  of  connections,  there  is  a  corresponding\nreduction in capital and operating costs. Table A9.2 shows that the Project is most sensitive to delays\nin  project  completion.  However,  the  project  EIRR  exceeds  the  SOCC  under  all  tests.  Since  the\nprojected sales are mainly derived from the suppressed demand for water from existing consumers,\nchanges in the rate of population growth have little impact on the EIRR. Similarly, changes in level of\nunaccounted for water had only a very minor impact on the EIRR.\n\nTable A9.2: Summary of Project Sensitivity  Analyses\n\nEIRR %\n\nSI %\n\nSV %\n\nKEY VARIABLE\nOverall Project\nBase case\n1.

The gains and losses to different participants in the Project are determined by\nthe  difference  between  financial  and  economic  benefits  and  costs  (at  a  discount  rate  of  12\npercent).  These  gains  and  losses  in  part  compensate  for  each  other  with  the  net  gain  being\npositive  and  equal  to  the  economic  NPV,  which  is  D431  billion  for  the  overall  Project.  While  the\nWSC and economy lose from the Project (where tariffs are less than economic benefits), labor and\nconsumers gain.

This rate of return is expressed on the basis of\nthe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  defined  as  the  discount  rate  equalizing  the  present\nvalue  of  incremental  subproject  costs  to  the  present  value  of  incremental  revenues.  Each\nsubproject  is  considered  to  be  financially  viable  if  the  FIRR  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the\nWACC.  To identify factors posing the greatest risk to the financial viability of each subproject,\nthe sensitivity of FIRR to adverse changes in selected key variables is analyzed. The average\nwater tariff required to achieve full cost recovery for the water supply components is estimated\nby calculating the average incremental financial cost (AIFC). The AIFC is defined as the present\nvalue  of  capital  and  operation  costs  divided  by  the  present  value  of  the  volume  of  water  sold\neach  year  over  the  life  of  the  subproject,  both  discounted  with  the  WACC.  The  AIFC  is  the\nminimum tariff required for full cost recovery. When the AIFC is higher than the actual average\ntariff,  the  difference  represents  a  financial  subsidy  to  water  consumers  from  the  water  supply\ncompany (WSC).\n\n2.\nMajor Assumptions: The major assumptions employed in the financial analysis are: (i)\nthe FIRR and AIFC are calculated over the 32 year period, from 2001 to 2032; (ii) all revenues\nand  costs  are  expressed  in  local  currency  on  an  incremental  basis  in  constant  January  2001\nprices;  (iii)  the  overall  WACC  for  the  Project  is  estimated  to  be  2.0  percent,  the  WACC  varies\nslightly  between  subprojects  because  of  differences  in  the  proportion  of  debt  and  equity\ncontributions by the central and provincial governments and project beneficiaries; (iv) reduction\nin  unaccounted  for  water  (UFW)  is  included  in  calculating  the  FIRR;  and  (v)  the  projected\nincremental  revenues  attributable  to  each  subproject  are  calculated  as  the  projected\nincremental  volume  of  water  sold  multiplied  by  the  average  water  tariff,  less  an  allowance  for\nbad debts.\n\nFIRR and AIFC: The results of the analysis are presented in Table A10.1. The overall\n3.\nFIRR  for  the  water  supply  component  is  3.2  percent,  which  is  above  the  2.0  percent  WACC.\nTherefore, the Project is considered to be financially viable. The FIRRs of the subprojects in all\nthe project towns exceed their WACCs except for Chi Thanh, where FIRR is slightly below the\nWACC. However, when the three subprojects in Phu Yen Province (Chi Tanh, La Hai, Tuy Hoa)\nare  considered  on  a  consolidated  basis,  the  FIRR  exceeds  the  WACC.  As  shown  in  Table\nA10.1, the average tariff requirements for the subprojects are relatively similar, ranging from a\nlow of D3,060 per cubic meter (m3) for Rach Gia to a high of D3,460/m3 for the three Phu Yen\ntowns. These average tariff requirements are expressed on a constant price basis.\n\n4.\nCompared with the existing average tariffs, the largest required tariff increase is in Phu\nYen (82 percent). The overall AIFC is D2,865/m3 of water sold. For the individual subprojects,\nthe AIFC ranges from a low of D2,790/m3 in Phan Rang to a high of D3,930/m3 in Chi Thanh.\nThe cost of service in the district towns is higher than that for the provincial towns because the\nsmaller service area limits economies of scale. The FIRRs for the subprojects in the two district\ntowns in Phu Yen Province are calculated on the basis that the same water tariff structure and\nlevels are applied by the provincial WSC in each subproject town.\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nTable A10.1 \u2013 Summary Results of Financial Analysis\n\nSubproject\n\nFIRR\n(%)\n\nWACC\n(%)\n\nAverage Water Tariff\n(D/m3)\n\nAIFC\n(D/m3)\nConstant Prices\n\nActual 2000\n\nChi Thanh\nLa Hai\nTuy Hoa\nPhu Yen Provincea\nPhan Rang\nRach Gia\nTay Ninh\nThu Dau Mot\n\nTotal Project\n\nRequiredb\n3,460\n3,460\n3,460\n3,460\n\n3,080\n3,060\n3,240\n3,145\nNMc\n\n1.8\n1.8\n1.8\n1.8\n\n1.7\n2.7\n2.2\n3.0\n2.0\n\n0.0\n2.5\n3.8\n3.3\n\n3.0\n3.0\n2.6\n3.4\n3.2\n\n1,897\n1,897\n1,897\n1,897\n\n3,100\n2,405\n2,076\n2,665\nNMc\n\n3,930\n3,300\n2,900\n3,040\n\n2,790\n2,980\n3,140\n3,000\n2,865\n\nNPV\nD million\n\n(5,757)\n1,533\n51,837\n47,613\n\n40,494\n6,330\n4,386\n14,775\n113,598\n\na Including Chi Thanh, La Hai, and Tuy Hoa; b Average tariff, expressed in 2001 constant prices, required over the\n2001\u20132014 period for WSCs to reach the financial targets. c NM =not meaningful.\nSource: WSCs documents and ADB estimates.\n\n5.\nSensitivity  Analysis:  The  sensitivity  of  each  subproject  FIRR  is  analyzed  to  the\nfollowing  adverse  changes:  (i)  increases  in  capital  costs;  (ii)  increases  in  operating  and\nmaintenance (O&M) costs, (iii) reductions in revenues, (iv) reductions in savings from NRW, (v)\na reduction in the projected number of new water connections attributable to the subproject, and\n(vi) delays in subproject construction. The FIRR is most sensitive to a reduction in incremental\nrevenues  derived  from  the  water  tariffs.  Tariff  revenues  may  be  lower  than  that  forecast  as  a\nresult  of  a  failure  to  increase  tariffs  to  the  proposed  levels,  which  may  arise  from  a  limited\nwillingness to pay and/or a lower rate of connection to the piped water system than assumed.\nThe impact of a reduced rate of population growth on the FIRR was also assessed. However,\nsince  the  focus  of  the  Project  is  on  satisfying  the  unmet  demand  for  water  from  existing\nconsumers, changes in the rate of population growth will have little or no impact on the FIRR.\nThe detailed results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in Table A10.2.\n\nTable 10.2: FIRR Sensitivity Analysis\n\nChange (%)\n\nFIRR (%)\n\nSI\n\nKey Variable\n\nTotal Project\n\nBase Case\nCapital Cost\nO&M Costs\nTariff Revenues/Water Sales\nUFW Cost Savings\nNew Connections\nProject Completion Delay\n\nRach Gia\n\nBase Case\nCapital Cost\nO&M Costs\nTariff Revenues/Water Sales\nUFW Cost Savings\nNew Connections\nProject Completion Delay\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\n+10\n+10\n-10\n-10\n-20\n1 Year\n2 Years\n\n+10\n+10\n-10\n-10\n-20\n1 Year\n2 Years\n\n3.16\n2.33\n2.74\n1.85\n3.10\n1.08\n2.65\n2.18\n\n2.98\n2.10\n2.53\n1.67\n2.93\n3.04\n2.47\n2.02\n\nSV (%)\n\n+14.3\n+27.0\n-8.9\nN/A3/\n\n+3.6\n+7.4\n-2.7\n-70.4\n\n2.63\n1.33\n4.15\n0.19\n3.23\n\n2.95\n1.51\n4.40\n0.17\n3.75\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\nThu Dau Mot\n\nBase Case\nCapital Cost\nO&M Costs\nTariff Revenues/Water Sales\nUFW Cost Savings\nNew Connections\nProject Completion Delay\n\nTay Ninh\n\nBase Case\nCapital Cost\nO&M Costs\nTariff Revenues/Water Sales\nUFW Cost Savings\nNew Connections\nProject Completion Delay\n\nBase Case\nCapital Cost\nO&M Costs\nTariff Revenues/Water Sales\nUFW Cost Savings\nNew Connections\nProject Completion Delay\n\nPhan Rang\n\nBase Case\nCapital Cost\nO&M Costs\nTariff Revenues/Water Sales\nUFW Cost Savings\nNew Connections\nProject Completion Delay\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\nPhu Yen (Tuy Hoa, La Hai, Chi Thanh)\n\n+10\n+10\n-10\n-10\n-20\n1 Year\n2 Years\n\n+10\n+10\n-10\n-10\n-20\n1 Year\n2 Years\n\n+10\n+10\n-10\n-10\n-20\n1 Year\n2 Years\n\n+10\n+10\n-10\n-10\n-20\n1 Year\n2 Years\n\n3.44\n2.57\n3.08\n2.34\n3.31\n1.65\n2.78\n2.44\n\n2.55\n1.68\n2.19\n1.36\n2.52\n0.57\n2.08\n1.65\n\n3.32\n2.43\n2.93\n2.04\n3.31\n1.07\n2.79\n2.32\n\n3.04\n2.08\n2.53\n1.61\n3.01\n0.76\n2.50\n2.03\n\n2.53\n1.05\n3.20\n0.38\n2.60\n\n3.41\n1.41\n4.67\n0.12\n3.39\n\n2.68\n1.18\n3.86\n0.03\n3.39\n\n3.16\n1.68\n4.70\n0.10\n3.75\n\n+5.4\n+13.3\n-4.5\n-37.2\n\n+4.0\n+10.0\n-3.2%\nN/A3/\n\n+18.4\n+38.1\n-12.0\nN/A3/\n\n+14.1\n+24.7\n-9.2\nN/A3/\n\nNA = not applicable, FIRR exceeds WACC even if UFW cost savings are reduced to zero; SI = sensitivity indicator,\n% change in FIRR to change in parameter; SV = switching value, % change in parameter sufficient to reduce FIRR to\nequal WACC.\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nB. \n\nFinancial Performance of Project Water Supply Companies\n\n6.\nObjectives and Scope of Analysis: Financial projections have been prepared for each\nWSC to assess the impact of each subproject on the financial viability and sustainability of the\ncompanies.  The  projections  are  based  on  the  implementation  of  the  water  tariffs  employed  in\nthe  FIRR  analysis  and  the  estimated  total  operating,  maintenance  and  capital  expenditure\nrequirements  of  the  WSCs  during  2000\u20132014.  The  financial  projections  incorporate  only  the\nwater  supply  operations  of  the  WSCs.  Therefore,  revenues  and  expenditures  earned  and\nincurred by the WSCs\u2019 construction services units are excluded.\n\n7.\nFinancial Targets: The preparation of the financial projections is based on a number of\nkey financial targets set for the WSCs. The WSCs\u2019 ability to achieve these targets is then used\nas  the  basis  for  assessing  the  financial  impact  of  each  subproject  on  the  WSCs  and  their\ncapability to operate on a financially sustainable basis. These targets, particularly as they apply\nto  each  individual  year,  should  not  be  regarded  as  absolute  requirements.  The  targets  are:  (i)\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 10, page 4\n\neach  WSC  should  generate  revenues  in  each  year  that  are  sufficient  to  cover  all  cash  O&M\nexpenses, including those for management and administration, depreciation or debt repayment,\nwhichever is greater, all interest expense on debt, and a net income sufficient to cover normal\nobligations  relating  to  bonus  and  welfare  fund  contributions;  (ii)  each  WSC  should  hold  at  the\nend  of  each  year  over  the  forecast  period  a  cash  balance  equivalent  to  no  less  than  30  days\nworth  of  annual  cash  O&M  expenditures  plus  debt  service;  (iii)  each  WSC  should  maintain  its\ncurrent  ratio  (current  assets  divided  by  current  liabilities)  at  no  less  than  1.0  as  of  the  end  of\neach  year  over  the  forecast  period;  and  (iv)  over  the  forecast  period,  the  financial  position  of\neach WSC should improve so that it is able to self-finance an increasing proportion of its annual\ncapital expenditure requirements.\n\n8.\nMajor Assumptions: The major assumptions employed in the financial analysis are: (i)\nthe financial projections include all revenues and costs incurred by each WSC over the 2000\u2013\n2014  forecast  period;  (ii)  Projected  capital  costs,  operating  revenues,  and  operating  expenses\nare presented in local currency and expressed in current prices; (iii) annual operating revenues\nfor  each  WSC  are  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  total  volume  of  water  billed  in  each  year  by\neach  customer  group  (residential,  institutional,  industrial,  commercial)  and  the  average  water\ntariff for each customer group; (iv) direct O&M costs include the following expense line items: (a)\nlabor, (b) electricity, (c) materials and supplies, (d) maintenance, and (e) other expenses, and\nmanagement and administration expenses are estimated by the following specific line items: (a)\nlabor,  (b)  sales  expense,  and  (c)  other  expenses;  and  (v)  consistent  with  Ministry  of  Finance\n(MOF)  regulations,  depreciation  expense  is  calculated  on  a  straight  line  basis  on  the  original\ncost of average gross fixed assets in operation.\n\nProjected Financial Performance: A summary of the financial projections for WSCs is\n9.\npresented in tables A10.3 and A10.4. The financial performance of the WSCs improves during\n2000\u20132014  due  to  increases  in  tariffs  and  water  sales  with  the  commissioning  of  the\nsubprojects. However, due to the need for the phased implementation of the tariff increases and\nbecause of the shorter term impact of the debt service obligations for the subprojects, all of the\nWSCs  will  experience  short-term  weaker  performance.  With  the  exception  of  the  Kien  Giang\nWSC,  the  WSCs  are  not  expected  to  achieve  the  financial  targets  set  out  above  in  all  years.\nHowever,  the  overall  financial  performance  and  position  of  the  WSCs  is  expected  to  be\nsufficient to maintain adequate levels of cash during these periods of weaker performance, and\ntherefore is considered satisfactory.\n\n10.\nDuring 2002\u20132006, the WSCs need to implement tariff increases to recover the full cost\nof existing water supply services, and eliminate their existing reliance on indirect subsidies from\nthe  construction  services.  Since  the  tariff  increases  need  to  be  phased  in  over  a  number  of\nyears, four of the five WSCs are anticipated to incur net losses in at least one year during this\nphase-in  period.  Over  the  period  of  2007-2009,  with  the  commencement  of  subproject\noperations  in  2008,  there  is  a  large  and  immediate  increase  in  depreciation  and  interest\nexpense on debt. However, the growth in water sales is spread out over a 3\u20136 year period as\nnew customers are progressively connected to the system. Consequently, financial performance\nis expected to weaken over the 2008\u20132010 period. As shown in Table A10.3, three of the five\nWSCs are projected to incur net losses in 2008. All of the WSCs, except the Kien Giang WSC,\nare  expected  to  incur  a  net  loss  in  2009.  Over  the  period  2010\u20132014,  the  WSCs\u2019  financial\nperformance is projected to progressively improve. Given that the recommended tariff increases\nare implemented, all of the WSCs will be able to generate a positive net income in each year of\nthe period. The required tariff increases, to cover inflationary increases in costs and to generate\ncash for capital investments, are less significant than over the first two periods.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 10, page 5\n\nTable A10.3: Summary Financial Projections (D billion, current prices)\n\n Binh Duong\nRevenue\nExpenses\nNet Income\n\n Kien Giang\nRevenue\nExpenses\nNet Income\n\n Ninh Thuan\nRevenue\nExpenses\nNet Income\n\n Phu Yen\n\nRevenue\nExpenses\nNet Income\n\n Tay Ninh\n\nRevenue\nExpenses\nNet Income\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n2001\n\n2004\n\n2006\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n2014\n\n        14.7\n        14.4\n          0.3\n\n        37.9\n        36.4\n          1.5\n\n        50.9\n        44.9\n          6.1\n\n       74.7\n       74.6\n         0.2\n\n     105.0\n     101.5\n         3.5\n\n     126.7\n     120.2\n         6.5\n\n     138.0\n     133.6\n         4.4\n\n        12.8\n        11.2\n          1.6\n\n        18.0\n        16.3\n          1.8\n\n        21.5\n        18.7\n          2.8\n\n       60.5\n       55.5\n         5.0\n\n       87.4\n       77.4\n       10.1\n\n     100.4\n       88.9\n       11.6\n\n     114.0\n     102.4\n       11.6\n\n          6.1\n          6.2\n         (0.1)\n\n          9.3\n          8.8\n          0.5\n\n       29.9\n        12.0\n        10.9\n       39.3\n          1.1         (9.4)\n\n       68.2\n       65.5\n         2.7\n\n       89.1\n       81.6\n         7.4\n\n       93.1\n       86.3\n         6.8\n\n          3.7\n          4.5\n         (0.8)\n\n          7.9\n          7.6\n          0.3\n\n       29.1\n        10.7\n        10.0\n       36.3\n          0.7         (7.2)\n\n       53.5\n       52.9\n         0.6\n\n       65.2\n       60.7\n         4.6\n\n       73.7\n       66.7\n         7.0\n\n          3.2\n          3.3\n         (0.1)\n\n          6.9\n          6.5\n          0.4\n\n       18.3\n          9.6\n          8.6\n       19.5\n          1.0         (1.2)\n\n       31.8\n       29.2\n         2.6\n\n       37.4\n       33.0\n         4.4\n\n       43.0\n       37.1\n         5.9\n\nTable A10.4: Key Performance Indicators\n\n2001\n\n2008\n\n2014\n\n Binh Duong\n\n Kien Giang\n\nWater Sales (m3/d)\nCash Balance (D million)\nCash (Days Worth of Cash Obligations)\nCurrent Ratio\nDebt - Equity Ratio (%)\nSelf Financing Ratio (%) - Annual\n\nWater Sales (m3/d)\nCash Balance (D million)\nCash (Days Worth of Cash Obligations)\nCurrent Ratio\nDebt - Equity Ratio (%)\nSelf Financing Ratio (%) - Annual\n\nWater Sales (m3/d)\nCash Balance (D million)\nCash (Days Worth of Cash Obligations)\nCurrent Ratio\nDebt - Equity Ratio (%)\nSelf Financing Ratio (%) - Annual\n\n Ninh Thuan\n\n Phu Yen\n\nWater Sales (m3/d)\n\n      12,400\n        6,400\n          168\n           1.2\n75\n3\n\n      12,400\n        6,100\n          262\n           6.2\n18\n22\n\n        5,500\n        3,800\n          350\n         20.2\n0\nNA\n\n    33,600\n    23,300\n        131\n         3.0\n87\n788\n\n    26,700\n    35,300\n        339\n         6.9\n51\n451\n\n    13,700\n    11,800\n        126\n         1.8\n156\n164\n\n    56,100\n    55,100\n        204\n         6.9\n61\n124\n\n    38,200\n    75,500\n        401\n         9.6\n34\n140\n\n    38,200\n    35,400\n        191\n         3.5\n93\n296\n\n        5,800\n\n    12,700\n\n    26,700\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 10, page 6\n\n Tay Ninh\n\nCash Balance (D million)\nCash (Days Worth of Cash Obligations)\nCurrent Ratio\nDebt - Equity Ratio (%)\nSelf Financing Ratio (%) - Annual\n\nWater Sales (m3/d)\nCash Balance (D million)\nCash (Days Worth of Cash Obligations)\nCurrent Ratio\nDebt - Equity Ratio (%)\nSelf Financing Ratio (%) - Annual\n\n        3,600\n          471\n           9.5\n0\n6\n\n        4,400\n        1,300\n          215\n         26.3\n19\n7\n\n    17,500\n        207\n         2.1\n113\n501\n\n     9,700\n    11,100\n        249\n         3.7\n97\n619\n\n    48,600\n        378\n         4.4\n80\n297\n\n    16,200\n    19,900\n        283\n         5.9\n64\n150\n\nm3/d = cubic meter per day.\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nC. \n\nTariff Requirements\n\n11.\nTariff Requirements: Tariff increases will be implemented every two years beginning in\n2002. Recommended tariff structures and levels have been developed and are shown in Table\nA10.5  for  2002\u20132008.  The  recommended  tariff  levels  for  each  customer  group  are  indicative\nonly. Actual tariffs for each group depend on the distribution of consumption, both between the\ncustomer  groups  as  well  as  within  the  residential  group.  The  existing  tariff  structure  for\nnonresidential  customers  will  be  maintained,  but  with  progressively  higher  tariff  levels  being\napplied over the 2002\u20132014 period, and the institutional, industrial, and commercial water users\nwill  pay  a  flat  tariff  for  all  consumption.  The  lifeline  consumption  block,  covering  the  first  8\nm3/month, will be priced at 80 percent of the main residential block for consumption between 8\nm3 and 16 m3. A third consumption block will cover consumption between 16 m3 and 25 m3 and\nbe priced at 1.25 of the main residential block. The fourth consumption block, for consumption\nabove  25  m3/month  will  be  priced  at  the  same  rate  applied  to  commercial  customers.  This  is\nintended  to  discourage  excessive  consumption  as  well  as  to  reduce  the  incentive  for\nmisclassifying commercial users as being residential for the purposes of tariff application.\n\nTable A10.5:  Projected Tariff Requirements (D/m3)\n\nCurrent\nPrices\n2000\n\n2002\n\nCurrent Prices\n2006\n2004\n\n2008\n\n2002\n\nConstant Prices\n2006\n\n2004\n\n2008\n\nP r o j e c t e d\n\n Kien Giang WSDC\n A.

The  tariffs  are  considered\naffordable if they do not exceed approximately 3-5 percent of household income. The results of\nthis analysis are summarized in Table A10.6.\n\nTable A10.6:  Affordability Analysis\n\nSubproject Town\n\nPercentage of Income to Pay Water Bill\n\n2002\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\n2014\n\nChi Thanh\n\nLa Hai\n\nMedian Income Household\nLow Income Household\n\nMedian Income Household\nLow Income Household\n\nPhan Rang\n\nMedian Income Household\nLow Income Household\n\nRach Gia\n\n2.2\n3.1\n\n2.8\n4.4\n\n2.6\n2.8\n\n3.7\n4.7\n\n4.8\n6.6\n\n3.0\n2.8\n\n3.7\n4.6\n\n4.8\n6.4\n\n2.8\n2.6\n\n3.4\n3.9\n\n4.4\n5.4\n\n2.4\n2.1\n\n\fMedian Income Household\nLow Income Household\n\nTay Ninh\n\nMedian Income Household\nLow Income Household\n\nThu Dau Mot\n\nMedian Income Household\nLow Income Household\n\nTuy Hoa\n\nMedian Income Household\nLow Income Household\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n69\n\nAppendix 10, page 8\n\n2.2\n2.0\n\n2.3\n2.6\n\n1.5\n1.8\n\n1.6\n1.7\n\n2.7\n2.0\n\n2.9\n2.7\n\n1.6\n1.6\n\n2.6\n2.5\n\n2.8\n2.0\n\n3.0\n2.7\n\n1.6\n1.5\n\n2.7\n2.4\n\n3.0\n1.9\n\n3.1\n2.5\n\n1.5\n1.3\n\n2.4\n2.1\n\n13.\nThe  willingness  of  consumers  to  pay  the  tariffs  has  also  been  assessed.  The  basis  for\nthis  assessment  is  the  social  survey  implemented  under  the  ADB  technical  assistance  that\nestimated  median  willingness  to  pay  for  households  presently  connected  to  the  piped  water\nsystem as well as for those presently not connected. In general, the willingness to pay for those\npresently  connected  was  higher  than  those  not  connected.  The  one  exception  was  in  Phan\nRang  where,  as  a  result  of  the  high  cost  and  limited  availability  of  nonpiped  sources,  the\nwillingness to pay for those not presently connected was higher. In Rach Gia, Thu Dau Mot, and\nTuy  Hoa  the  proposed  tariffs  for  2002  are  generally  within  the  existing  willingness  to  pay  for\nhouseholds presently having piped water connections. However, by 2008, the tariffs need to be\nset at levels that exceed the existing willingness to pay. For the other towns, tariff requirements\nin 2002 exceed the willingness to pay for households by between about 30 percent (Tay Ninh)\nand  100  percent  (Phan  Rang,  Chi  Thanh,  La  Hai).  For  those  not  presently  connected,  the\nprojected tariff requirements exceed the existing willingness to pay in all towns.\n\n14. Willingness  to  Pay:  The  survey  results  likely  underestimate  the  willingness  to  pay.  In\nPhan  Rang  and  Tay  Ninh,  current  water  bills  for  a  typical  household  exceed  the  reported\nwillingness to pay for those connected to the system and yet there appears to be little resistance\nto payment. Willingness to pay is also a function of present levels of service, which are low in all\nof  the  towns.  For  those  not  presently  connected  to  the  piped  water  supply  system,  it  was\nobserved  during  the  implementation  of  the  socioeconomic  survey  that  households  often  had\ndifficulty  estimating  the  total  cost  of  their  existing  nonpiped  supply  and,  therefore,  their\nwillingness  to  pay  for  piped  water.  As  a  result,  the  gap  between  tariff  requirements  and\nwillingness to pay is likely to be less than that indicated by the survey results. However, there\nremains  a  need  for  public  education  aimed  at  improving  willingness  to  pay  and,  therefore,\nwillingness to connect to the piped water system.\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 11, page 1\n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction\n\n(ADB)  guidelines, \n\nIn  accordance  with \n\nthe  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s \n\ninitial\n1.\nenvironmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were  carried  out  as  an  integral  part  of  the  project\npreparatory  technical  assistance.  The  IEEs  analyzed  the  likely  environmental  consequences\nand  impacts  of  the  implementation  of  water  supply,  drainage,  and  sanitation  improvements  in\nthe project towns. The Project aims to improve and sustain the water-related urban facilities in\nprovincial  towns  Phan  Rang,  Rach  Gia,  Tay  Ninh,  Thu  Dau  Mot,  and  Tuy  Hoa  as  well  district\ntowns of Chi Thanh and La Hai. One strategic project objective is environmental improvement.\nThe Project is classified as environment category B, as per ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Environmental\nAssessment of Project Impacts.  The  IEEs  are  based  on  an  analysis  of  the  impacts  of  the\nproposed works, the socioeconomic survey conducted during project preparation, and a visual\nassessment of the project towns.\n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Project\n\nThe  Project  will  improve  the  water  and  sanitation  facilities  in  the  seven  towns.  The\n\n2.\ndetails of the Project are given in the main text of the report.\n\nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n1. \n\nPhysical Resources\n\n3.\nChi  Thanh  is  a  district  town  on  National  Highway  1,  approximately  30  kilometers  (km)\nfrom Tuy Hoa and 1,128 km from Hanoi. The town is on the right bank of the Cai River, which\nalso  provides  the  town\u2019s  water.  The  topography  is  undulating  to  hilly.  The  average  annual\nrainfall is 1,670 millimeters (mm), which is concentrated in six months of the year from August to\nJanuary. The area surrounding the town is largely rural.\n\n4.\nLa Hai is small district town in southeast Viet Nam, about 45 km to the north of Tuy Hoa.\nThe town is on the left side of the Ky Loy River, which is also the source of the town\u2019s water.\nMost of the town lies on the sloping ground above the river, with only a small area on the flood\nplain.  The  terrain  is  hilly.  Groundwater  is  used  extensively  for  water  supply.  The  area\nsurrounding the town is largely rural.\n\n5.\nPhan Rang is a coastal town on the left bank of the Cai River, which also provides the\ntown\u2019s  water.  The  town  is  about  334  km  from  Ho  Chi  Minh  City.  Most  of  the  town  lies  on\nunconsolidated sediments, and its terrain is relatively flat. The area around the town is largely\nrural, although there is an industrial zone on the opposite bank of the Cai River. Annual rainfall\nis very low at 500\u2013800 mm and mainly distributed from September to November.\n\n6.\nRach  Gia  is  on  the  Rach  Gia  Gulf,  at  the  southwest  extremity  of  Viet  Nam.  It  has  an\naverage annual rainfall of 1,980 mm, which is concentrated in the May\u2013November period. The\ntown lies on a coastal plain composed primarily of unconsolidated sediments, and its terrain is\nrelatively  flat  and  low-lying  with  many  canals.  The  area  around  the  town  is  largely  rural.\nGroundwater  is  used  extensively  for  water  supply,  but  has  high  salinity  in  the  dry  season.\nSurface water in the canals also becomes saline during the dry season.\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nTay  Ninh  is  in  southeast  Viet  Nam,  about  90  km  inland  from  Ho  Chi  Min  City.  Its\n7.\naverage  annual  rainfall  is  1,805  mm.  The  town  is  relatively  flat,  although  there  are  hills  and\nmountains located outside the town. The area around the town is largely rural.\n\nThu Dau Mot is in southeast Viet Nam, within 40 km of Ho Chi Minh City. The town is\n8.\nsituated on the plain between two major rivers, the Saigon and Dong Nai. The average annual\nrainfall is 1,856 mm, most of which occurs from September to November. Groundwater is used\nextensively by households and industry, and is of good quality. However, overexploitation could\nlead to a substantial lowering of the groundwater table and deterioration of groundwater quality.\nThe area surrounding the town is largely rural.\n\n9.\nTuy  Hoa  is  a  coastal  town  in  Phu  Yen  Province  in  southeast  Viet  Nam,  approximately\n1,158 km from Hanoi. Most of the town area lies on alluvial sandy flats at the mouth of the Da\nRang River, and the terrain is relatively flat. However, within the town is a large hill on which a\nservice  reservoir  and  communications  tower  have  been  constructed.  The  average  rainfall  is\n2,300  mm,  which  is  concentrated  in  six  months  of  the  year  from  July  to  December.  The  area\nsurrounding the town is largely rural.\n\n2. \n\nEcology\n\nThere  are  no  known  endangered  varieties  of  flora  or  fauna  in  the  areas  proposed  for\n10.\ndevelopment  in  the  Project.  Land  areas  for  the  proposed  water  supply  and  sanitation\ndevelopment  have  been  developed  or  disturbed  previously  and  have  no  forest  or  unusual\nvegetation cover.\n\n3. \n\nHuman and Economic Development\n\n11.\nThe population of the provincial project towns varies from 43,000 in Tay Ninh to 198,000\nin Tuy Hoa, while the two district towns, La Hai and Chi Thanh have 8,000-10,000 people. The\nurban  areas  of  the  project  towns  serve  principally  as  service  areas  for  the  surrounding  rural\nregions.  Their  economies  are  based  on  the  provision  of  services  to  provincial  or  district\npopulations,  market  trading,  light  industry,  and  in  the  case  of  Rach  Gia,  Tuy  Hoa,  and  Phan\nRang,  a  local  fishing  industry.  Thu  Dau  Mot  and  Binh  Duong  province  are  undergoing  rapid\nindustrial development, and the districts adjacent to the town will be incorporated in the town in\nthe  near  future.  This  rapid  industrial  growth  is  accompanied  by  development  of  high-density\nworker\u2019s accommodation in the form of low level and high-rise housing units. Light industry and\nfood processing are becoming increasingly important to the town economies. The project towns\nhave existing water supplies and combined drainage and sanitation systems, although coverage\nis low. Many suburban areas in the project towns have no piped drainage system, and even in\nthe urban wards, piped drainage coverage is very low. All of the towns are accessible by road,\nall have power supply from the national grid and, all have Government offices.\n\n4. \n\nItems of Archaeological Significance\n\nThere are no known sites of historical or cultural significance in the Project area that are\n12.\nlikely to be affected during implementation. However, in the detailed investigation and design of\nwater and sanitation works, particular care will be taken to identify historical and cultural sites,\nand appropriate steps will be taken to protect any such sites.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\n\n5. \n\nQuality of Life\n\n13.\nSocioeconomic conditions vary widely between the seven project towns. Thu Dau Mot is\nthe  wealthiest  town,  while  Chi  Thanh  and  Phan  Rang  are  the  poorest.  Average  household\noccupancy varies from 4.2 persons in Tay Ninh to 5.1 in Rach Gia. In all of the Project towns,\ncommunity  health  profiles  are  less  than  satisfactory  and  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities\nare inadequate and pose an environmental health hazard.\n\nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n1. \n\nProject Sites\n\n14. Water  Sources.  Thu  Dau  Mot  and  Tuy  Hoa  have  inadequate  yields  and  additional\nsources of supply are required to meet existing and projected demands. The water sources for\nPhan  Rang  and  Tay  Ninh  are  regulated  by  upstream  storage  and  have  adequate  yields  to\nsupport  the  water  demands  of  the  towns  to  2010  and  beyond.  But  the  capacities  of  the  raw\nwater systems require augmentation. Rach Gia\u2019s surface water source has adequate yield; the\ncapacity of the raw water system will require augmentation; however, water quality is affected\nby saline intrusion in the dry season. A large raw water reservoir will be constructed to ensure\nthat  adequate  supplies  of  potable  water  are  available  during  the  dry  season.  Increased\ncoverage of piped water supply will reduce town residents\u2019 exploitation of ground water, which\nbecomes  saline  and  unpleasant  to  drink  during  the  dry  season.  Chi  Thanh\u2019s  surface  water\nsource suffers from organic pollution by agricultural and animal wastes, and will be replaced by\na  borefield  in  riverside  alluvial  deposits  adjacent  to  the  existing  source.  La  Hai\u2019s  existing\nborefield source has adequate yield and capacity to meet the town\u2019s water demands in 2010.\n\n15.\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement. The Project facilities will require about 68 hectares\n(ha)  of  land,  including  52  ha  of  agricultural  and  residential  land  to  be  acquired  from  private\nowners.  Approximately  71  households  will  be  resettled  to  allow  construction  of  reservoirs  and\nwater  treatment  plants.  There  will  be  more  than  900  affected  persons  entitled  to  receive\ncompensation as a result of the Project. Most of the new major facilities such as treatment plants,\nborefields, and ground level storage will be constructed on Government land. Transmission and\ndistribution  mains  will  generally  be  constructed  along  roadways,  but  it  will  be  necessary  to  run\nwater  supply  pipelines  through  some  private  properties  in  most  project  towns.  This  will  involve\nsome  temporary  resettlement,  as  well  as  compensation  and  restoration  costs.  Details  of  the\nissues are presented in Appendix 7.\n\n2. \n\nDesign Aspects\n\n16.\nPollution  of  groundwater  sources  will  be  minimized  by  ensuring  that  modern  well\nconstruction  techniques  are  used  to  seal  wells  against  infiltration  of  shallow  groundwater.  To\nsafeguard  water  quality,  all  treated  water  reservoirs  will  be  covered  and  ventilated  and  the\nsystems  operated  to  ensure  that  the  distribution  network  is  maintained  under  pressure  to\nminimize the risk of contamination from polluted groundwater and backflow. Standby generators\nwill be installed at all treatment plant and pumping station sites to ensue a continuous supply of\nwater  at  adequate  pressure.  Backwash  water  from  filters  will  be  passed  through  a  settlement\ntrap to reduce turbidity prior to discharge to the environment. Sludge from water treatment will\nbe  discharged  into  lagoons  and  dried  on  sludge  drying  beds.  Sludge  and  sediment  from  the\nsettlement  trap  and  from  the  drying  beds  will  be  disposed  of  at  the  town  landfill  sites.  The\nProject includes investment in drainage and sanitation to ensure that there is no deterioration in\nexisting conditions. These measures will be accompanied by improved septic tank management\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 11, page 4\n\nsystems,  regulative  initiatives,  a  public  health  awareness  program,  and  activities  directed  at\nimproving  drainage  and  sanitation  at  the  community  level.  As  a  precondition  to  connecting  to\npiped supply, householders will be required to install sullage pipes discharging to drains or, in\nlow  density  areas,  to  properly  constructed  soakaways.  Noise  generated  by  pumping  stations\nand workshops will be minimized by providing thick foundations and bases for equipment, and\nsolid sound-absorbing walls. For the proposed raw water reservoir at Rach Gia, it is proposed\nthat  a  comprehensive  study  be  carried  out  to  assess  the  quantity  of  material  affected  by  acid\nsulfate  soils.  In  addition  laboratory  trials  should  be  carried  out  using  alternative  neutralizing\nagents  to  determine  necessary  proportions  and  mixing  methods  to  optimize  the  neutralization\nprocess where it is considered necessary.\n\n3. \n\nConstruction Stage\n\n17.\nThere  will  be  no  permanent  or  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from\nthe  construction  stage.  The  community  environment  during  the  period  of  construction  of  the\nfacilities  and  during  ongoing  operation  will  be  assured  by  appropriate  management  plans,\nequipment  specifications,  and  detailed  design.  During  construction,  the  contractors  will  be\nrequired to prepare and implement environmental management plans (EMPs), and carry out the\nwork  according  to  international  standards,  including  consulting  with  residents  through  paid\ncommunity  coordinators;  providing  safe  and  adequate  temporary  paths  for  residents  and\nbusinesses;  providing  adequate  safety  to  the  public  and  workers;  implementing  effective\nmeasures to reduce erosion, turbidity, dust, and noise due to construction equipment; providing\nlimited transportation and construction along the main roads in urban areas during rush hours\nand in residential areas at night and early morning; appropriately disposing of surplus soil and\nconstruction  materials;  and  minimizing  interruption  to  water  supplies.  During  construction,\nprovincial  project  management  units,  assisted  by  consultants,  will  cooperate  with  affected\nresidents and take all measures needed to minimize the impacts on residents and the public.\n\n4. \n\nOperation Stage\n\n18.\nTo  ensure  safe  water  is  delivered,  effective  monitoring  of  the  treatment  processes,\noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  procedures  and  daily  chlorine  residual  testing  in  the\nextremities of the distribution system will be instituted. Periodic microbiological testing of treated\nwater will also be carried out in accordance with the tests and frequencies recommended in the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) drinking water guidelines. Additional chlorination facilities will\nbe provided at booster pumping stations within the distribution systems in several of the towns,\nin  order  to  maintain  chlorine  residuals  in  the  water.  Where  reliable  microbiological  testing\nfacilities  are  available  from  the  Ministry  of  Health  or  Ministry  of  Science,  Technology  and\nEnvironment (MOSTE), independent sampling and testing of supplied water will be carried out.\nWhere  these  facilities  are  not  currently  available,  the  water  supply  companies\u2019  (WSCs)\nlaboratories  to  be  constructed  or  upgraded  under  the  Project  will  be  equipped  with\nmicrobiological  test  equipment,  and  staff  will  be  trained  in  its  use.  Appropriate  planned\npreventive  maintenance  programs  and  budgets  will  be  developed  for  all  facilities  constructed\nunder the Project, and for existing facilities. On the job training and structured training courses\nwill  be  given  to  O&M  supervisory  staff,  and  will  include  vocational  training  as  well  as\noccupational health and safety, particularly where this involves the use of potentially hazardous\nchemicals,  such  as  chlorine  gas.  The  Project  will  also  provide  O&M  equipment  necessary  to\nenhance  sustainability,  including  leak  detection  equipment,  pipe  cutting  and  threading\nequipment, and vacuum tankers (for septic tank sludge removal and transport).\n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 11, page 5\n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\nMOSTE  administers \n\nthe  Environmental  Protection  Law  (EPL-1993), \n\n19.\nits\nDepartment  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environment.  The  department  is  also  responsible  for\nrecommendations  on  policy,  rules,  regulations  and  guidelines,  including  environmental  quality\nstandards  and  reviewing  and  approving  environmental  impact  assessments.  MOSTE  is  also\nresponsible  for  supervising  wastewater  discharges  to  the  environment.  Provincial  people's\ncommittees, assisted by the provincial environmental department (DOSTE) are responsible for\nimplementing  the  EPL-1993  in  the  province,  including  monitoring  and  enforcement.  DOSTE\u2019s\nusual  role  in  each  province  is  to  review  and  approve  the  EMP,  to  review  monitoring  data\nprovided by the WSC, and to periodically inspect the site to validate overall compliance.\n\nthrough \n\nThe  WSCs  will  be  required  to  commission  an  EMP  for  each  project  component.  The\n20.\nEMPs  will  summarize  the  mitigation  measures  proposed  for  the  construction  and  operation  of\nthe  components.  Conformance  with  the  EMP  is  the  normal  way  to  ensure  that  all  mitigation\nmeasures are appropriately addressed. An EMP will also ensure that monitoring and validation\nwill  follow  up  predictions  made  in  the  IEE.  This  may  require  modification  to  design  or\nconstruction  aspects  that  are  found  to  have  any  impact  at  variance  with  that  predicted.  A\ngroundwater quality surveillance system will be established during the construction of the Rach\nGia  raw  water  reservoir  and  for  its  initial  operating  period  to  monitor  any  changes  in\ngroundwater  levels  and  quality  and  to  quantify  any  changes  that  occur.  This  will  assist  in\nvalidating the predictions that an improvement in groundwater quality is likely to result from the\nProject. A computerized billing system and management information system will be installed at\neach WSC. This may be used to monitor and manage the septic tanks in the communities, and\nserve as a maintenance management system. During the course of the Project, a database of\nthe  sanitation  records  for  the  town  will  be  prepared.  This  will  be  used  to  identify  septic  tanks\nrequiring desludging after the design period of 2-3 years, and will ensure that all septic tanks are\nproperly managed and are cleaned of sludge before they overflow or fail.\n\nF. \n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n21.\nThe  Project  is  designed  to  improve  and  sustain  the  urban  environment  in  the  project\ntowns.  Within  the  scope  of  the  project  components  it  will  help  these  urban  areas  to  cope  with\nthe development and population pressures that will arise as urbanization increases.\n\nG. \n\nConclusion\n\n22.\nThe Project\u2019s negative impacts will only be temporary, minor, and reversible, and can be\nmitigated  through  proper  policy,  planning,  public  relations,  and  good  construction  and\nsupervision practices. The Project will have no significant adverse environmental impact and an\nenvironmental impact assessment is not necessary.\n\n\f75\n\nAppendix 12, page1\n\nA. \n\nScope and Information Sources\n\nSUMMARY SOCIAL ANALYSIS\n\nThe  social  analysis  in  this  Project  covers  poverty,  gender,  ethnicity,  and  community\n1.\nparticipation.  It  is  based  on  several  sources.  First,  a  bibliographic  search  yielded  a  number  of\nreferences,  including  substantial  statistical  information  such  as  the  1998  Government  Living\nStandards  Survey  and  the  1999  World  Bank  Participatory  Poverty  Assessment.  The  statistical\ndata  was  instrumental  for  the  poverty  analysis,  while  the  gender  and  participation  sections\nbenefited  from  qualitative  analysis,  including  a  nongovernment  organization  paper  on  gender\nissues  in  Viet  Nam.  Most  relevant  to  the  Project  is  the  socioeconomic  survey  (SES)  that  was\ncarried out in June and July 2000, covering 2,160 households or about 10,500 people (about 1\npercent  of  the  beneficiaries).  The  SES  was  supplemented  by  project  workshops  and  focus\ngroups (both single sex and mixed sex groups) discussions. The project conducted more than\n25 consultations to design the community development component.\n\nB. \n\nSocioeconomic Characteristics of the Project Towns\n\n2.\nPopulation.  The  population  of  the  Project\u2019s  proposed  service  area  is  about  850,000,\nincluding  urban  and  suburban  areas  of  the  seven  towns  and  adjoining  districts.  The  five\nprovincial towns have populations ranging from about 43,000 to 198,000, while the population of\nthe two district towns is approximately 8,000-10,000. The annual national population growth rate\nis 1.7 percent according to the 1999 census, compared to the recent annual growth rates in the\nproject  towns  of  1.3-4.2  percent.  The  projected  population  of  the  Project\u2019s  proposed  service\narea in 2010 is 1.15 million, based on the above growth rates.\n\n3.\n\nLocation of Project Towns. These are described in Section C, Appendix 11.\n\nPoverty.  To  determine  a  project-defined  level  of  poverty  for  each  town,  a  conversion\n4.\nfactor  of  the  ratio  between  the  World  Bank  poverty  incidence  (from  surveys)  and  Ministry  of\nLabor,  Invalids,  and  Social  Affairs  (MOLISA)  data,  is  applied  to  each  town.  The  result  shows\nthat  the  percentage  of  the  poor  is  20.7  percent  for  Chi  Thanh,  7.9  percent  for  La  Hai,  27.0\npercent for Phan Rang, 13.4 percent for Rach Gia, 9.2 percent for Tay Ninh, 7.5 percent for Thu\nDau Mot, and 10.4 percent for Tuy Hoa. The household survey and consultations show that the\nage  and  size  of  the  household  have  important  impacts  on  poverty.  The  other  dimension  of\npoverty is access to basic services. Table A12.1 shows the access to basic services by income\ngroup.\n\n5.\nEmployment. The largest single source of income in the project towns was described as\n\u201cown  business,\"  by  30-35  percent  of  the  households.  In  La  Hai,  however,  only  13  percent\nderived their income from this source. Other major sources of income in the project towns were\nagriculture  and  fishing,  casual  work,  Government  salaries,  and  pensions.  Many  houses  had\nmore than one source of income.\n\nEducation.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  population  has  a  high  level  of  educational  achievement  as\n6.\nindicated by the national literacy rate of 88 percent. The household survey in the project towns\nshow that 98 percent of household heads have at least some primary education, while up to 10\npercent  (in  Thu  Dau  Mot)  have  attained  some  kind  of  tertiary  education.  The  lowest  level  of\ntertiary  education  was  observed  in  Chi  Thanh,  with  only  2.5  percent.  In  other  towns,  the  level\nranged from 3 to 9 percent.\n\n\f76\n\nAppendix 12, page2\n\nTable A12.1 - Poverty Profile for Project Towns\n\nIndicator\n\nTown\n\nLowest 20%\nIncome\n\nHighest 20%\nIncome\n\nAccess to Piped Water (%)\n\nToilet Used (%)\n\nHead of Household with Education to\nSecondary School Level (%)\n\nSolid Waste Collection Service (%)\n\nOwn Business as Primary Source of\nIncome (%)\n\nCasual Work as Primary Source of\nIncome (%)\n\nRach Gia\nTay Ninh\nThu Dau Mot\nPhan Rang\nTuy Hoa\nChi Thanh\nLa Hai\nRach Gia\nTay Ninh\nThu Dau Mot\nPhan Rang\nTuy Hoa\nChi Thanh\nLa Hai\nRach Gia\nTay Ninh\nThu Dau Mot\nPhan Rang\nTuy Hoa\nChi Thanh\nLa Hai\nRach Gia\nTay Ninh\nThu Dau Mot\nPhan Rang\nTuy Hoa\nChi Thanh\nLa Hai\nRach Gia\nTay Ninh\nThu Dau Mot\nPhan Rang\nTuy Hoa\nChi Thanh\nLa Hai\nRach Gia\nTay Ninh\nThu Dau Mot\nPhan Rang\nTuy Hoa\nChi Thanh\nLa Hai\n\n27.1\n11.9\n1.7\n43.5\n20.0\n7.5\n0\n85.0\n95.0\n95.0\n50.0\n76.6\n22.5\n13.6\n21.7\n23.7\n20.0\n24.2\n23.3\n12.5\n4.5\n51.6\n16.9\n8.3\n51.6\n55.0\n5.0\n-\n20.0\n27.1\n20.0\n25.8\n25.0\n12.5\n9.1\n36.7\n22.0\n31.7\n30.6\n28.3\n20.0\n2.3\n\n48.3\n23.3\n21.7\n70.1\n40.0\n52.5\n2.3\n98.3\n100.0\n100.0\n89.6\n85.0\n87.5\n38.6\n38.0\n43.3\n40.0\n53.7\n40.0\n57.5\n22.7\n63.3\n33.3\n70.0\n65.7\n61.7\n40.0\n-\n41.7\n60.0\n50.0\n46.3\n41.7\n37.5\n25.0\n11.7\n1.6\n5.0\n14.9\n5.0\n2.5\n2.3\n\n\u2013 =  no information available.\nSource: Socioeconomic Survey carried out during the feasibility study of the Project.\n\n\f77\n\nAppendix 12, page3\n\n7.\nHealth. Viet Nam ranks below average among the least developed countries in terms of\npublic access to safe water supplies. Lack of safe water and inadequate sanitation are the main\ncauses of the country\u2019s above-average incidence of waterborne and hygiene-related diseases.\nThe household surveys revealed that there are few serious outbreaks of contagious diseases,\nprobably a result of improved public awareness. Waterborne diseases, such as dysentery and\ndiarrhea, and eye diseases were reported in all towns, although records were poor. Other water-\nrelated diseases such as malaria, dengue, and typhoid (in Phan Rang and Tuy Hoa) were also\nreported.\n\n8.\nEthnicity.  Each  project  town  has  a  majority  of  the  Kinh  ethnic  group,  ranging  from  91\npercent  in  Tay  Ninh  to  more  than  99  percent  in  Chi  Thanh  and  La  Hai.  The  main  ethnic\nminorities are the Chinese, which are present in all towns and comprise less than 1 percent in\nTuy Hoa to 7 percent in Tay Ninh; Cham, which account for 2 percent in Tay Ninh and 5 percent\nin Phan Rang; and the Khmer minority, which is almost 7 percent of the population in Rach Gia.\nThe Khmer are over-represented in Rach Gia\u2019s poor, having low levels of education, and poor\nliving conditions, and lacking water supply, sanitation, and permanent well-paid jobs. Conditions\nfor the Cham ethnic group vary between Tay Ninh and Phan Rang. In Tay Ninh the Cham are\nclustered  into  an  area  in  ward  1  where  language,  customs,  and  religious  practices  keep  them\nisolated from the outside world. This group has low incomes and poor living conditions (housing,\nwater  supply,  and  sanitation).  In  Phan  Rang  the  Cham  are  a  larger  group  dispersed  through\nPhan  Rang  and  neighboring  Ninh  Phuoc.  Thanh  Hai  ward  in  Phan  Rang  has  the  highest\npercentage (54 percent) of households from the Cham ethnic group. These people are poor and\nhave  low  incomes  from  subsistence  agriculture  and  handicrafts,  and  inadequate  water  and\nsanitation. The settlement is also isolated from the rest of Phan Rang, by physical distance and\naccessibility, as well as language, customs and cultural mores.\n\n9.\nWater  Supply.  In  the  project  towns,  the  proportion  of  households  with  piped  water\nsupply  ranges  from  4  percent  (La  Hai)  to  55  percent  (Tay  Ninh),  and  per  capita  consumption\nvaries between 70 (La Hai) and 137 (Thu Dau Mot) liters per capita per day. Unaccounted-for-\nwater  averages  37  percent  of  water  produced.  A  further  6-10  percent  is  lost  in  the  water\ntreatment  process  through  backwash  and  sludge  removal.  Consumers  are  required  to  pay  for\nwater  supplied  to  house  and  tap  connections,  while  water  is  supplied  free  of  charge  at  public\ntaps. Water tariffs are based on metered consumption, but many meters are of poor quality and\ndo not measure accurately. As a result, many customers are charged on the basis of estimated\nconsumption.  In  most  towns,  customers  have  paid  for  and  selected  their  water  meter,  and\nconsider that it is their property.\n\n10.\nSanitation, Drainage, and Electricity. Sanitation and drainage conditions in all project\ntowns are in a very poor state. Large areas of the provincial and district towns have no piped\ndrainage system. The drainage system coverage in the towns is low. Electricity coverage is high\nthroughout  Viet  Nam,  but  the  service  level  varies  by  region.  In  all  project  towns,  electricity  is\nsupplied  from  the  national  grid,  but  is  unreliable,  and  electricity  cuts  are  commonplace,\nparticularly in Rach Gia, which is at the end of the national grid.\n\nC. \n\nNeeds and Demands of Target Beneficiaries\n\n11.\nThe  needs  and  demands  of  low  income  and  poor  people  are:  (i)  willing  to  pay  a  small\namount to have water located more conveniently; (ii) like better water and toilets but cannot afford\nto connect or build; (iii) would share a connection between 6-10 households; (iv) prefer metered\ntaps  even  if  sharing  between  4-5  households;  (v)  cannot  afford  to  store  water;  (vi)  want\n\n\f78\n\nAppendix 12, page4\n\nimprovement to the quality of piped water; (vii) need knowledge of how to improve sanitation; (viii)\nconsider  residential/public  toilets  are  a  high  priority;  (ix)  need  improved  drainage;  (x)  consider\nsolid  waste  collection  is  an  important  issue;  (xi)  would  be  able  to  contribute  labor  to  build  and\nmaintain  services,  and  could  manage  collection  of  money  for  water  from  a  shared  connection\nbetween  poor  households;  (xii)  need  a  repayment  facility  such  as  installments  for  water\nconnections; and (xiii) need a credit scheme for toilets.\n\n12.\nThe needs and demands of women are: (i) greater convenience and less time in collecting\nwater;  (ii)  need  clean  water  as  it  is  time  consuming  to  filter  water  or  clean  storage  tank;  (iii)\ncomplained  that  piped  water  is  only  available  for  a  few  hours  a  day;  (iv)  would  pay  for  better\nquality, convenient, and more reliable water; (v) prefer individual meters; (vi) worried about high\nwater  connection  costs;  (vii)  needed  toilets  but  cannot  afford  them;  (viii)  prefer  own  toilets;  (ix)\nconcerned about cost of removing waste from septic tank toilets; (x) want improved drainage to\nimprove  the  environment;  (xi)  consider  that  solid  waste  a  problem  and  collection  service  is\nneeded;  (xii)  worried  about  getting  sick;  health  is  very  important;  (xiii)  consider  that  installments\nare  needed  to  pay  for  water  connections;  and  (xiv)  favor  credit  scheme  for  toilets  (but  need  to\nknow the terms).\n\nD. \n\nSocial Impacts of the Project\n\nProject  Beneficiaries  and  Benefits.  The  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  include  women\n13.\nand  children,  households  in  general,  poor  households,  small  businesses,  and  schools.  The\nbenefits  include  convenient  access  to  clean,  reliable  piped  water;  greater  equity  in  the  cost  of\nwater;  reduction  in  time  and  energy  spent  collecting  water  from  unsafe  sources;  reduction  in\nwaterborne  diseases;  less  time  and  cost  spent  filtering,  boiling,  and  storing  piped  water;  and\nenvironmental improvements. In addition, institutions such as water supply companies (WSCs),\nthe Vietnamese Women\u2019s Union, town People\u2019s Committee, and town health office will improve\ntheir ability and knowledge in working with the community on water and sanitation problems.\n\n14.\nImprove  Access  to  Clean  Water.  The  poor  often  walk  or  cycle  long  distances  (400\u2013\n1,000 meters) daily or more to collect water for drinking if they have no safe and reliable source\nnearby,  or  when  existing  wells  are  dried  up,  become  saline  during  the  dry  season,  or  are\ncontaminated by flood water during the wet season. Access to piped water will mean significant\nincrease the time available for more productive income generating work, education, and health\ncare.  Piped  water  availability  will  result  in  increased  water  purchasing  power  for  the  same\nhousehold  budget.  Greater  use  of  piped  water  (including  for  washing  dishes,  bathing,  and\nwashing clothes) will improve health and reduce risk of infection or illness from polluted sources\nsuch as wells.\n\n15.\nCredit Schemes. The project provides sanitation credit schemes and water connection\ncredits to poor households to help improve their living conditions and reduce the risk of illness\nand incapacity.\n\n16.\nIncreased  Employment  Opportunities.  The  Project  could  provide  employment\nopportunities,  including  expansion  of  the  labor  force  of  WSCs  or  public  works  companies\n(PWCs), employment in water resource management, public or community toilet management,\nwater tap management, handcart operation, and community motivation work.\n\nImproved  Hygiene  and  Sanitation  Practices  Health  Impacts.  The  public  health\n17.\nawareness program will have a significant impact on the poor. Improved hygiene and sanitation\npractices and awareness of safe sanitation will increase the impact of sanitation conditions and\n\n\f79\n\nAppendix 12, page5\n\nlead  to  greater  effectiveness  of  this  component.  Simple  technical  information  on  appropriate\ndesign and construction of sanitation facilities will provide valuable guidance to the poor, which\nis  currently  unavailable.  Availability  of  piped  water  and  proper  excreta  disposal  will  lead  to\nhealth  improvements  by  reducing  risk  of  waterborne  and  water-related  diseases  including\ndengue  fever,  diarrhea,  eye  disease,  skin  disease,  reproductive  tract  infections,  typhoid,  and\ncholera.  Morbidity  due  to  water-related  illnesses  has  a  major  impact  on  the  poor.  Loss  of  a\nlaborer has a devastating effect on a poor household and makes it more vulnerable to deeper\npoverty.  The  effect  can  be  a  downward  spiral  of  loss  of  earnings,  unexpected  expenditure  on\nmedicines  and  health  care,  borrowing  at  high  interest  rates  to  pay  for  health  care,  increased\nindebtedness,  withdrawal  of  children  from  school  to  work,  and  selling  of  assets  to  generate\nincome.  When  children  get  sick,  an  adult  is  taken  out  of  productive  work  to  look  after  them.\nChildren regularly suffering from diarrhea are more likely to be malnourished and have stunted\ngrowth and lower retention for learning. Health improvements will reduce the cost of health care\nand  medicines  to  households,  with  the  greatest  impact  experienced  by  the  poorest  section  of\nsociety. A visit to a commune health center costs the poor the equivalent of 8 percent of their\nnonfood consumption, which is more than twice the 3 percent spent by the richest households.\nHospital  outpatient  visits  cost  the  poor  around  26  percent  of  nonfood  consumption  (four  times\nthat of the rich); and in-patient admissions cost 45 percent (twice that of the rich).\n\nE. \n\nGender Analysis\n\n18.\nGender  in  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation.  In  Viet  Nam,  women  dominate  tasks  within\nthe household, including preparing food, cooking, washing dishes and cooking utensils, washing\nclothes, bathing babies and children, caring for the elderly, caring for the sick, tending livestock,\nand cleaning house. In the project towns, where piped water is not available, women also have\nan important role in collecting water from other sources. In some communities (e.g., within Phan\nRang) collection of water is a family or household responsibility, as all available labor is needed\nto cope with the task on a daily basis. Where children are involved, girls are twice as likely as\nboys to have responsibility for collecting water in La Hai and Phan Rang, compared to the other\nproject towns where responsibility is evenly divided.\n\n19.\nThroughout the project towns women play a lead role in semiformal water and sanitation\nservices, which replicate their traditional roles within or just outside of the home sphere. Women\nare usually employed as street sweepers, rubbish collectors, and public latrine cleaners, rather\nthan  men.  Community-managed  standpipes  in  a  project  near  Phan  Rang  were  managed  by\nwomen.  These  job  opportunities  arise  because  women  spend  a  lot  of  time  at  home,  but  they\nalso  tend  to  keep  women  at  home.  Women  are  employed  in  the  Project  provincial  WSCs,  but\nmostly in a support role carrying out clerical or secretarial functions rather than technical roles,\nwith  the  exception  of  a  few  women  who  are  employed  in  specialist  areas  including  as\nenvironmental scientists, laboratory technicians, and resettlement specialists.\n\n20.\nDecision  Making.  Viet  Nam  has  a  high  number  of  female-headed  households  (almost\none third are female where the head of the household is 45 years or over). Two thirds of female-\nheaded  households  have  no  male  spouse  in  the  household,  with  one  third  having  a  male\nspouse  in  the  household,  but  the  female  is  the  registered  head.  Female-headed  households\nwere encountered in all of the project towns, and noticeably in poorer towns such as La Hai and\nChi Thanh where male spouses have moved to other areas for employment. Despite this high\nnumber  of  female-household  heads,  women  are  not  necessarily  the  primary  decision  makers,\nwith influences from either the male spouse or male children affecting decisions. Direct decision\nmaking by women is restricted to household chores, child rearing, and expenses for daily meals,\nwhereas men make more important decisions on major expenditures and the family. This role of\n\n\f80\n\nAppendix 12, page6\n\nmen extends beyond the family to the formal sector, where men make decisions about the use\nand allocation of water and sanitation services at the WSC and government level.\n\n21.\nDevelopment Preferences. The SES results show that water supply was a preference\nmore for women than men in La Hai, Rach Gia, and Tay Ninh with the remaining towns evenly\nsplit  except  Tuy  Hoa  (41  percent  of  men  compared  to  21  percent  of  women).  Women  gave\ntoilets a high priority in Phan Rang, Rach Gia, and Tay Ninh with them being more important to\nmen in Chi Thanh and La Hai. Women also generally gave solid waste services, hospitals, and\nschools a higher priority for the project towns than did men.\n\nthe \n\n22.\nProject  Gender  Strategies.  The  consultations  and  SES  revealed  different  needs  and\nroles  of  men  and  women  that  must  be  considered  in  the  provision  of  improved  water  and\nin  project\nsanitation  services.  Therefore \nimplementation:  (i)  meeting  the  needs  of  women  consumers  will  be  a  special  focus  of  the\ncustomer  relations  department  of  WSCs;  (ii)  WSC  staff  will  be  trained  in  effective  community\nconsultation and participation; (iii) WSCs and the provincial VMU will closely coordinate in the\nProject implementation; (iv) the VWU will be used for access to women at the grassroots level;\n(v) female community motivators will be used for the public health awareness program (PHAP);\n(vi)  opportunities  will  be  provided  for  women  among  the  unskilled  construction  work;  and  (vii)\nparticipatory project evaluation will be done by men and women.\n\nfollowing  strategies  will  be \n\nincorporated \n\n23.\nGender  Impacts.  The  Project  will  make  water  conveniently  available  to  women,  thus\nreducing  their  efforts,  and  time  spent  on  collecting  water  and  caring  for  other  household\nmembers who are ill from unsafe water or poor hygiene. This will help women improve their own\npersonal health. Drainage and sanitation will result in environmental improvements around the\nhome,  more  pleasant  living  conditions,  and  less  risk  of  illness.  Women  will  also  benefit  from\nincreased knowledge of safe water practices, personal hygiene, and awareness of the linkage\nbetween water, sanitation, and health. Increased interaction with support agencies such as the\nVWU will reduce the isolation of some women and bring outside influences into the home. The\nfinancial position of poor women will be improved by having more time for productive labor, and\nspending less on water purchased from informal sources.\n\nF. \n\nCommunity Participation\n\nto \n\n24.\nExtensive  consultation,  undertaken  during  feasibility  study,  using  project  workshops,\nfocus  groups  discussions,  and  survey  methods,  will  continue  during  project  implementation.\nWSCs will be trained in community consultation techniques, analysis of customer feedback, and\nother  areas \nimprove  participation.  The  PHAP,  community  environmental  sanitation\nimprovement  (CESI)  program,  and  sanitation  credit  scheme  will  all  use  participatory\napproaches. The PHAP, aimed at improving public awareness of water, sanitation, and health,\nhas  been  developed  after  the  model  prepared  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank-financed\ntechnical  assistance  2376-VIE:  Community  Environmental  Health  Improvements,  a  successful\nparticipatory program implemented by VWU over three years. The TA final report has provided\nlessons  for  future  improvements.  The  CESI's  main  objective  is  to  support  community-level\ndemand for sanitation improvements generated through the PHAP, such as toilets, washbasins,\nrubbish  bins  and  collection  depots,  small-scale  drainage,  waste  dumping  areas,  and  septic\ntanks. The sanitation credit scheme will provide credits to the urban poor for constructing house\nconnections for drainage and septic tanks, and thereby allowing them to fully participate in the\nurban development and benefit from the improved urban services.\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 15 November 2001)\n", "Currency Unit\nD1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013\n=\n=\n", "Dong (D)\n$0.000066\nD15,053\n", "For  calculations  in  this  Report,  an  exchange  rate  of  D14,500  to  $1.00  has  been\n", "used.
