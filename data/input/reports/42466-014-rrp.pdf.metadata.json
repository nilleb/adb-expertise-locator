It will support \nlarge-scale private sector involvement  and promote public\u2013private partnership, which is critical \nto  meet  existing  and  future  labor  market  needs  and  to  reduce  the  skills  gap.  This  in  turn  is \ncrucial for Bangladesh to move away from the \u201clow-skill, low-wage equilibrium\u201d to a \u201chigher skill, \nhigher  wage  virtuous  cycle\u201d  to  become a  middle-income country. The  investment  program  will \nhelp the  government  to scale-up  skilling  of  new  entrants  and up-skilling  of  existing  workers  to \ncontribute  to  higher  growth  of  priority  sectors.  It  will  also  strengthen  skills  development  in \nBangladesh and support transition to a sector-wide approach (SWAp) by establishing a unified \nfunding system and enhancing overall coordination of the currently fragmented system.2    \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\n \nA. \n \n\nRationale \n\n1. \n\nMacroeconomic and Sector Context   \n\n \n3. \nThe Bangladesh economy has grown more rapidly at about 6% annually since 2003, up \nfrom 5% in the 1990s. The poverty headcount index declined sharply from 57% in 1992 to 31% \nin 2010. Social indicators have improved significantly, particularly for women. However, despite \nimpressive  progress,  the  2010  labor  force  survey  indicated  that  more  than  60%  of  the  labor \nforce has either no education (40%) or up to primary education (22.8%); about 2 million young \npeople  enter  the  labor  force  every  year.  The  average  wage  per  worker  has  remained  low  at \nTk200 per day for day laborers and Tk3,500 per month for garment workers.  \n \n4. \nWith  the  approval  of  the  National  Education  Policy  and  the  NSDP,  the  government \nembarked on major education and training reforms. The National Education Policy emphasizes \nthe overall importance of education and training, while the NSDP reinforces the importance of \nskills development and opens up the sector for major policy and institutional reforms including \nsubstantial involvement of the private sector. Bangladesh has achieved gender parity in primary \nand secondary education participation since 2000. Women\u2019s labor force participation grew from \n26%  in  2003  to  36%  in  2010.  A  major  opportunity  for  the  country  comes  from  its  declining \ndependency ratio, from a high of 108% in 1974 to 66% in 2010, leading to an increasing share \nof the working age population in the next three decades.3 However, this opportunity cannot be \ncapitalized on unless urgent investments are made in much higher quality schooling combined \nwith at least a four-fold increase in skilling and/or up-skilling of the labor force, which is expected \nto increase from 56.7 million in 2010 to 78 million in 2025.  \n \n5. \nIn its Perspective Plan 2021, Bangladesh articulates its vision to achieve middle-income \nstatus  by  2021,  including  reducing  the  poverty  rate  by  half.4  To  accelerate  economic  growth \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework for the investment program is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance:  ADB.  2011.

Dhaka. \n\n \n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nfrom the current 6% to 8% and above, the government must address the skills shortage\u2014one of \nthe key binding constraints. Skills development requires a two-pronged approach. First, it must \nbe anchored in foundational skills that come from high-quality schooling combined with relevant \nvocational  and  technical  skills  to  capitalize  on  the  demographic  dividend.  Second,  it  requires \nscaling  up  skills  training  by  four  to  eight  times  the  current  annual  training  capacity  to  \n(i) increase labor force productivity to contribute to higher average household income leading to \nhigher  gross  domestic  product,  (ii)  double  exports  within  10  years,  (iii)  double  remittances \nthrough  higher  skills  leading  to  higher  per  capita  remittances,  and  (iv)  promote  economic \ndiversification  including  trade  facilitation  and  industrialization.  The  government  will  provide \nsubsidies  to  the  industry  associations  to  catalyze  the  private  sector  to  substantially  scale  up \nskills training under the investment program.   \n \nPerformance  of  skills  development.  The  low  productivity  of  the  labor  force  is  a \n6. \nfunction of low educational attainment, negligible vocational training (only 4% of the labor force \nhas vocational training), and limited capacity to provide high-quality training to meet current and \nfuture labor market needs. Skills development faces two major challenges: (i) the significant gap \nbetween demand and supply of labor, as growing industry demand is far outpacing supply; and \n(ii)  weak  technical  and  vocational  education  in  terms  of  capacity  and  quality  (poor  teaching, \nlarge number of teacher vacancies, outdated buildings and equipment, curriculum unrelated to \nthe work place, and lack of engagement with the private sector). The result is a limited supply of \nlow-skilled graduates unable to meet domestic and foreign labor market needs.  \n \n7. \nThe skills development system remains highly fragmented with more than 20 ministries \nand divisions involved in some form of skills training, not well linked with industry and economic \ndevelopment  policies.  The  system  currently  has  the  capacity  to  meet  only  20%  of  the  annual \ntraining needs (500,000 trainees are currently trained annually), job placement is less than 40% \nin most training institutions. The skills development system (i) lacks a common institutional and \nfinancing framework to coordinate skills  development; (ii)  has  limited funding to scale-up  skills \ntraining  to  meet  the  skills  required  by  industry;  (iii)  has  limited  involvement  of  employers  and \nenterprises to provide market responsive training with high labor market outcomes; and (iv) has \nlimited  capacity  to  monitor  system  quality,  improve  recognition  of  skills  acquired,  implement \nhigh-quality  assessment  and  certification  systems,  and  expand  capacity  for  preparing  trainers \nand qualifications that meet international industry or trade standards.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPolicy and Strategic Frameworks  \n\n \n8. \nPolicy  framework.  The  NSDP  provides  a  solid  framework  to  prepare  Bangladesh  to \nmove to a \u201chigher skill equilibrium.\u201d Its policy matrix drawn and emerging government\u2019s priorities \nemphasize  (i)  establishing  and  operationalizing  a  national  human  resource  development  fund \n(NHRDF)  by  2015  to  substantially  scale  up  high-quality  skills  training  to  meet  labor  market \nneeds; (ii) setting up a new ministry or an authority for skills by 2017 to strengthen coordination \nby building on the initiatives of the National Skills Development Council (NSDC) chaired by the \nPrime  Minister;  (iii)  enhancing  the  quality  of  skills  development  in  partnership  with  the \nBangladesh  Technical  Education  Board  and  industry  skills  councils  (ISCs);  (iv)  catalyzing  the \nprivate  sector  to  develop  and  implement  high-quality,  market-responsive  training  programs;  \n(v)  revitalizing  public  training  providers  to  better  respond  to  labor  market  needs  through \ndelegation  of  powers  and  structured  partnerships  with  the  private  sector;  and  (vi)  enhancing \ncommon monitoring  and  moving  to a  SWAp to bring  together  the key  stakeholders  to support \nskills development.5  \n\n                                                \n5   Policy Matrix (accessible from the facility administration manual in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n \n9. \nSkills development road map. The government recognizes that the low education and \nskills of the labor force are a major binding constraint to achieving higher economic growth. To \naddress  this,  it  needs  to  invest  heavily  in  human  development,  particularly  in  schooling  and \nskills  development.  Currently,  only  500,000  receive  skills  training  annually  against  the  actual \nindustry  need  of  at  least  2  million.  Similarly,  the  total  expenditure  in  skills  development  is \nestimated at around $150 million per year against the need to invest about $600 million; these \nnumbers  will  grow  as  the  labor  force  increases  by  40%  by  2025.  Industry  leaders  want  to \nparticipate  actively  in  skilling  the  work  force  in  priority  sectors  to  exploit  the  full  potential  of \ngrowth opportunities.     \n \n10. \nStrategic  context.  The  investment  program  is  aligned  with  the  Bangladesh  country \npartnership  strategy,  which  identifies  the  low  competitiveness  of  firms  as  a  key  constraint  to \ngrowth particularly the low skills and low productivity of the workforce.6 It is also aligned with the \nPerspective Plan, 2010\u20132021 and the Sixth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015, which emphasize the \nneed  to  develop  \u201ca  workforce  equipped  with  contemporary  technical  skills  and  knowledge \nthrough advanced vocational training,\u201d with a \u201cmechanism to encourage collaboration between \ntraining institutes and industry to optimize the utilization of available human resources.\u201d  \n \n11. \n(ADB) assistance in Bangladesh and elsewhere, and incorporates lessons from these.7 \n \n\nLessons.  The  investment  program  builds  upon  previous  Asian  Development  Bank \n\n3. \n\nKey Features   \n\n \n12. \nLong-term  programmatic  approach.  The  road  map  and  the  comparison  matrix \nstrongly justify the need to adopt an MFF to allow the government to (i) establish a credible and \nsustainable  institutional  arrangement  to  develop  and  coordinate  the  skills  sector;  (ii)  target \npriority growth sectors and skill levels8 to enhance employability of the working age population \ninformed by a skills-gap analysis, increase average income of the workforce by increasing labor \nproductivity,  and  improve  job  placement  rates;  (iii)  gradually  shift  the  large  proportion  of  the \nworkforce  currently  in  the  informal  sector  to  the  formal  sector;  and  (iv)  improve  overall \nmonitoring and performance of the skills development sector in a concerted manner. \n \n13. \nFocus  on  outputs,  outcome,  and  strong  monitoring.  The  investment  program  will \nhelp  expand  the  capacity  of  the  public  and  private  sector  to  provide  market-responsive  skills \ntraining  with  an  enhanced  job  placement  and/or  self-employment  rate  from  less  than  40% \ncurrently to 70%. Disbursement for training will be based on progress payments against agreed \nunit costs per course: (i) enrollment, (ii) completion of training, and (iii) job placement of trainees \nwithin  6  months  after  completing  training.  The  evidence  will  be  the  certified  list  of  trainees \nagainst  each  milestone  maintained  by  all  training  providers  through  a  web-based  trainee \ntracking  system.  The  progress  payment  will  be  clearly  stipulated  in  the  project  agreement  or \ncontracts between the executing agency and the 32 public training providers, Bangladesh Bank \nSmall  and  Medium  Enterprise  Department,  industry  associations,  and  Palli-Karma  Sahayak \nFoundation (PKSF) under tranche 1.9  \n \n14. \nTransition  to  a  sector-wide  approach.  The  NSDP  envisages  bringing  the  currently \nfragmented  skills  development  sector  under  one  coordinated  framework,  one  unified  funding \nwindow,  and commensurate  institutional  arrangements. The  program  will  help  the government \n                                                \n6   ADB. 2011. Country Partnership Strategy: Bangladesh, 2011\u20132015. Manila.  \n7   Sector Assessment (Summary): Skills Development (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8   The six priority sectors for tranche 1 are readymade garments, leather, construction, light  engineering, information \n\ntechnology, and ship building and maritime. The skill levels are low, semi-skilled, and skilled. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nadopt a SWAp to leverage greater funding from the private sector and development partners to \nimplement the NSDP effectively. The SWAp road map proposes developing and implementing a \nskills  development  program  framework  in  collaboration  with  development  partners  and  other \nstakeholders by developing a costed skills sector development program under a medium-term \nbudgetary framework.    \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs  \n\nB. \n \nThe impact will be increased income and productivity of the working population aged 15 \n15. \nyears  and  over.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  employment  in  priority  sectors  and  skills  for \nmales and females.  \n \nC. \n \n16. \nThe investment program will be implemented in the first 7 years of the government\u2019s 10-\nyear  investment  program.  Project  1,  to  be  implemented  during  FY2014\u2013FY2018,  will  help  lay \nthe  foundation  for  scaling  up  high-quality  training  programs,  enhancing  quality  assurance \nsystem  that  is  recognized  internationally,  strengthening  funding  and  overall  coordination,  and \nenhancing the monitoring and evaluation and governance of skills development. The investment \nprogram will have four outputs, with the following activities under project 1.  \n \nOutput 1: Market responsive inclusive skills training delivered. The program will (a) \n17. \nengage  32  public  training  providers  under  three  ministries  to  train  about  47,400  people;  and \nnine  associations  (192,600),  PKSF  (10,000),  and  Bangladesh  Bank  Small  and  Medium \nEnterprise Department (10,000) to train more than 200,000 people in six priority sectors, with an \naverage job  placement of  70%;  and  (b)  help target  40,000 people from disadvantaged groups \nincluding people with disabilities and 40% women, and support pilot targeting mechanisms.  \n \n18. \nOutput 2: Quality assurance system strengthened. First, the investment program will \nsupport  development  of  at  least  five  qualification  packages  including  occupational  standards, \none  for  each  priority  sector;  and  support  registration  of  all  participating  training  providers. \nSecond, it will train trainers, industry assessors, and principals and managers of the public and \nprivate  training  institutions.  Third,  it  will  support  improvements  of  training  facilities  of \nparticipating  public  training  providers;  promote  partnerships  by  bringing  together  public  and \nprivate training providers to maximize enrollments and share facilities and resources to address \nthe  skills  needs  of  industry;  and  develop  criteria  and  mechanisms  to  establish  centers  of \nexcellence  in  each  priority  sector.  Fourth,  it  will  strengthen  the  capacity  for  assessment  and \ncertification  through  partnerships  of  Bangladesh  Technical  Education  Board  and  ISCs  in  each \npriority sector, and help establish a system to recognize skills already obtained by trainees from \ndifferent sources.  \n\n \nOutput 3: Institutions strengthened. First, the investment program will help establish \n19. \nthe national human resource development fund under the Ministry of Finance as envisaged in \nthe  NSDP  to  increase  funding  to  substantially  increase  the  capacity  for  high-quality  skills \n                                                                                                                                                       \n9  In  tranche  1,  there  are  32  public  training  providers  under  the  Ministry  of  Education,  the  Ministry  of  Expatriates\u2019 \nWelfare  and  Overseas  Employment,  and  the  Ministry  of  Industry.  The  nine  associations  under  tranche  1  are \nBangladesh  Garment  Manufacturers  and  Exporters  Association,  Bangladesh  Knitwear  Manufacturers  and \nExporters  Association,  Bangladesh  Textile  Mills  Association,  Leathergoods  and  Footwear  Manufacturers  and \nExporters  Association of  Bangladesh,  Bangladesh  Association  of  Construction  Industry,  Bangladesh  Engineering \nIndustry  Owners\u2019  Association,  Bangladesh  Association  of  Software  and  Information  Services,  Bangladesh  Call \nCenter  Operators'  Association,  and  Shipbuilders  Association.  Palli-Karma  Sahayak  Foundation  and  Bangladesh \nBank\u2019s Small and Medium Enterprise Department are also included. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\ntraining. Second, it will support the establishment of a new ministry or an authority for skills with \nits  own  medium-term  budgetary  framework  for  skills  development  by  building  on  NSDC\u2019s \ninitiatives.  Third,  it  will  provide  delegation  of  powers  to  the  participating  around  100  public \ntraining  institutions  to  mobilize  resources,  hire  trainers  and  resource  persons,  offer  flexible \ncourses,  and  enter  into  partnership  with  employers  and  enterprises.  Fourth,  it  will  strengthen \nindustry  linkages,  job  placement,  and  career  counseling  in  partnership  with  training  providers \nand employers. \n \nOutput 4: Effective program management. First, the investment program will support \n20. \na robust monitoring and evaluation system to track students and train providers to ensure high-\nquality  training  and  job  placement;  and  support  the  NSDC  secretariat  in  common  sector \nmonitoring,  skills  gap  analysis,  and  strengthening  of  ISCs.  Second,  it  will  strengthen  sector \nplanning  and  budgeting  for  the  skills  development  sector  to  move  toward  a  SWAp  by  2017. \nThird,  it  will  establish  mechanisms  to  strengthen  governance  and  risk  management  in  skills \ndevelopment  in  close  partnership  with  the  NSDC  secretariat.  Fourth,  it  will  support  effective \nproject management. \n \n21. \nProject 2 (tranche 2) will be implemented during FY2017\u2013FY2020 and will overlap with \ntranche 1. It will expand coverage to 10 priority sectors by supporting the full operationalization \nand strengthening of an additional five ISCs. This phase will expand activities initiated in tranche \n1  and  help  refine  models  for  targeting  (vouchers  and  stipends),  assessment  and  certification, \neffective  use  of  information  and  communication  technology,  sustainable  financing  (greater \ncontributions from government, development partners, private sector, and users), and effective \nprogram  management  (refinements  in  output-based  financing  to  link  more  closely  with  job \nplacement and job retention with higher incomes, more effective monitoring). A major emphasis \nwill be to support the government to fully implement the SWAp modality. \n \n22. \nProject 3 (tranche 3) will be implemented during FY2018\u2013FY2021 and will overlap with \ntranche  2.  It  will  expand  coverage to  15  priority  sectors  by  supporting  an  additional  five  ISCs. \nMore development partners are expected to join the SWAp and the private sector is anticipated \nto make larger investments in skills development. This is expected to lead to a vibrant market \nfor skills development, which will in turn spur innovations. The public training institutions will be \nable  to  forge  partnerships  with  the  private  sector.  The  new  ministry  or  authority  for  skills  is \nexpected to be operating fully during this phase and will help consolidate the skills development \nsector. The quality assurance system is expected to develop further, ISCs are expected to be \nfully operating, and several centers of excellence are expected to function effectively.  \n \nD. \n  \n23. \nThe  investment  program  is  estimated  to  cost  $1.07  billion,  including  taxes  and  duties \n(Table 1).10 The government has requested an MFF in an amount up to $500 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources to help finance the investment program. As an initial support, ADB will \nprovide $350 million comprising three tranches, not exceeding 7 years from the approval date, \nsubject  to  the  government\u2019s  submission  of  periodic  financing  requests,  execution  of  loan \nagreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings set forth \nin the framework financing agreement. The first tranche of the MFF, for $100 million, will have a \n25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2% per annum throughout \n                                                \n10  Development partners are anticipated to contribute  $400 million and the private sector $86.5 million for tranche 2 \nand  tranche 3  once  the  National  Human  Resource  Development  Fund is  established by  2015  and  the  SWAp  by \n2017.  The  current  program  aims  to  add  1.25  million  new  entrants  to  the  skilled  workforce  based  on  current \ncommitted funding. If development partner financing materializes, outputs would be enhanced. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nincludes  cofinancing  of  $10  million  equivalent \n\nthe  loan  term,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.

Subject  to  performance,  the \nGovernment  of  Switzerland is  expected  to finance $10 million  for  each of  the  subsequent  two \ntranches under the MFF, which will be administered by ADB. The MFF financing plan is in Table \n2.  The  ADB  loan  is  32.7%  of  the  total  cost  and will  be  used  to  finance  expenditures  for  skills \ntraining,  human  resources,  equipment,  furniture,  minor  civil  works,  instructional  materials, \ncapacity building, and related technical assistance.  \n \n\nfrom \n\nTable 1: Investment Program \n($ million)a \n\nItem \nA.

The  economic  viability  of  project  1  was  assessed  based  on  the \nbenefits  and  costs  associated  with  the  investment  program.  Economic  benefits  include  \n(i) direct benefits for students with increased employability and higher wages, (ii) direct benefits \nfor  employers  in  terms  of  improved  productivity  and  returns  on  investment,  and  (iii)  improved \ninternal efficiency for reducing system wastage caused by low completion rate. The three major \nstreams  of  economic  costs  are  (i)  direct  project  costs  associated  with  the  four  outputs,  \n(ii)  private  costs  of  trainees  for  participation  and  indirect  opportunity  cost  of  their  foregone \nearnings during training, and (iii) costs shared by training institutions. Project 1 is estimated to \nyield a net present value of $142 million under the base case scenario. The economic internal \nrates  of  return  were  calculated  for  three  scenarios  assuming  a  discount  rate  of  12%:  (i)  base \ncase: 22.89%, (ii) optimistic case: 31.15%, and (iii) pessimistic case: 15.93%. This suggests that \nthe investment program will be a sound investment. \n \nFiscal  sustainability.  Fiscal  sustainability  will  depend  on  (i)  availability  of  resources, \n27. \nespecially  success  of  the  government\u2019s  revenue  mobilization  efforts;  (ii)  priority  assigned  to \nskills development; and (iii) at least partial recovery of costs from trainees and employers. Since \nskills development is emerging as a major sector, the government will mobilize resources from \nat  least  four  sources:  (i)  its  own  resources  to  leverage  other  sources  of  funds,  (ii)  funds  from \ndevelopment partners, (iii) private sector contributions initially through cost sharing and drawing \non  corporate  social  responsibility,  and  (iv)  promotion  of  cost  recovery  where  feasible  from \ntranche 2. The long-term sustainability of the program will depend on (i) increasing the quality of \nskills training to meet high labor market outcomes, (ii) increasing labor force productivity leading \nto  higher  returns  on  business  investment,  and  (iii)  gradual  increasing  wages  to  induce  more \ninvestments from individuals in skills training.  \n \nB. \n \n28. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  shows  that  the  government\u2019s  framework  for \npublic  financial  management  is  under  transition  and  a  number  of  improvements  have  been \nmade  in  recent  years.  Although  the  overall  system  remains  weak  and  associated  with \nsubstantial  fiduciary  risks,  the  executing  agency  is  associated  with  lower  risks.  Specific \nweaknesses  of  government  and  nongovernment  entities  relevant  to  program  implementation \ninclude  budget  preparation;  accounting;  internal  control;  and  timing  and  quality  of  financial \nreporting,  internal  audit,  and  external  audit.14  The  financial  management  assessment  of  the \ngovernment  entities  specifically  noted  shortcomings  regarding  the  staffing  of  the  accounts \ndepartments.  The  assessment  found  that  overall  fiduciary  risks  of  sector  associations  are \nsubstantial,  and  that  shortcomings  relevant  for  the  program  relate  especially  to  planning  and \nbudgeting,  internal  control,  grant  management,  resolution  of  external  audit  observations,  and \nstaffing.  For  the  investment  program,  key  risks  include  the  inability  of  training  providers  to \nmanage  their  working  capital  requirements  as  well  as  accumulated  uncleared  advances.  The \nassociated fiduciary risks can be treated in the short term by the use of safeguards and in the \nlonger term through effective financial management (and anticorruption) reform programs. The \ntime  for  reforms  to  reduce  risk  is  likely  to  be  medium  to  long  term  (5\u201310  years),  which \ncorresponds  with  the  planned  overall  program  time  frame.  Risk  mitigation  measures  include \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n14  Audits  undertaken  by  the  Foreign  Aided  Projects  Audit  Directorate  generally  are  deemed  satisfactory  regarding \n\nboth quality and timing. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nprogress  payments  linked  to  unit  cost  analysis,  instituting  a  tracking  system  to  track  the \nprogress  of  all  trainees,  validating  unit  costs,  managing  advances  to  nongovernment  entities, \nmonitoring  the  implementation  of  financial  management  action  plans  for  the  involved \ngovernment  and  nongovernment  entities,  undertaking  rigorous  annual  fiduciary  reviews,  and \nsupporting  relevant  external  audit  mechanisms.  Key  elements  of  the  financial  management \naction  plan  include  tracking  of  advances  using  the  advances  tracking  module  under  the \ngovernment\u2019s  integrated  budgeting  and  accounting  system,  requiring  close  monitoring  of \nadvances  and  working  capital  of  each  of  the  training  providers  by  the  SDCMU,  and  capacity \nbuilding initiatives in financial reporting and budgeting. \n \nC. \n \nShortage of  productive  and remunerative employment  is  a major  cause of  poverty  and \n29. \nvulnerability. While the total labor force increased from 46.3 million in FY2003 to 53.5 million in \nFY2010,  the  overall  labor  force  participation  rate  of  59.3%  remains  low  by  international \nstandard. However, the growth in labor force participation of 2.81% during FY1974\u2013FY2011 has \noutpaced  the  population  growth  rate  of  1.86%.  This  increase  is  largely  coming  from  the \naccelerated  rate  of  female  participation  in  recent  years,  although  the  female  labor  force \nparticipation rate of 36% is less than half that for males (82%). Furthermore, the participation of \nwomen in the labor force is largely concentrated in the informal and low wage sectors. There is \nstill  a  significant  gap  in  women\u2019s  share  in  the  skilled  labor  force,  especially  in  technical  and \nvocational employment. A bigger challenge has been that employment growth has been slower \nthan total labor force growth, and underemployment is the most serious challenge afflicting over \n25%  of  the  workforce.  The  investment  program  will  support  NSDP  implementation,  which \nprioritizes targeting the poor and vulnerable groups including women as part of supporting high-\ngrowth priority sectors with the potential for creating more and better jobs. \n \nD. \n \nUnder  project  1,  only  existing  facilities  will  receive  support  for  minor  adjustment  or \n30. \nrenovations to cater to training activity needs. No acquisition of land or relocation of people is \nplanned.  Accordingly,  project  1  is  category  C  for  environment  and  involuntary  resettlement \nsafeguards. The investment program will reach and include unskilled residents of remote areas \nand members of disadvantaged groups, including indigenous peoples. Project 1 is expected to \nhave  positive  impacts  and  is  classified  category  B  for  indigenous  peoples  safeguards  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).15  A  small  ethnic  community \nplanning  framework  was  developed  to  guide  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  in \nassessing  the  presence  of  indigenous  peoples  in  the  project  area  and  conducting  separate \nconsultations to elicit their views, identify the need for culturally compatible mechanisms for their \nparticipation, and ensure incorporation of adequate measures in project activities. The executing \nagency through the SDCMU will monitor these activities closely and ensure necessary actions. \n \nE. \n \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.16  \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n \n\n                                                \n15 Environmental Assessment Review Framework; Resettlement Framework; and Small Ethnic Community Planning \nFramework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

Targeted technical assistance included in the \ndesign along with close coordination with key stakeholders provides an inclusive platform \nfor ensuring high-level support for unified funding and strong coordination.  \nThis is expected to be limited to a short duration. Consultation with key stakeholders \nconfirmed universal support for scale-up skills training as a strategic pillar to accelerated \ninclusive economic growth. The strong leadership of the Finance Division and contractual \nstaff in the SDCMU will reduce the impact of change in government. \nThe program design includes strong support for establishing and ensuring an effective \nmonitoring and tracking system to track trainees up to job placement. There is targeted \nsupport to institutions for social marketing, career counseling, and linkages with employers. \nThe program design includes financial management action plans for government and \nnongovernment entities focusing on technical actions and support (to improve planning and \nbudgeting, budget execution and grant management, accounting, internal control, financial \nreporting and internal audit, and clearance of advances), carrying out quarterly and annual \nfiduciary reviews, validating unit costs of all entities, conducting post-procurement reviews, \nand ensuring comprehensive external audits. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, NSDC = National Skills Development Council, NSDP = National Skills Development \nPolicy, SDCMU = skills development coordination and monitoring unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n \n32. \nThe government and the Ministry of Finance have assured ADB that implementation of \nthe investment program shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  facility  administration  manual  and  loan  documents. \nThe  government  and  the  Finance  Division  have  given  ADB  certain  undertakings  for  the  MFF, \nwhich  are  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing  agreement.
