Bangladesh faces the \nchallenge  of  increasing  access  to  electricity  and  removing  power-related  constraints  on \neconomic development. The government has embarked on a program of fast-track measures to \ndevelop power generation capacity, including developing new gas supply facilities and dual-fuel \nand coal-based power plants to generate 15 gigawatts of power capacity by 2016.3  \n3. \nThe  consortium  of  Summit  Industrial  &  Mercantile  Corporation  (Pvt.)  Limited  (SIMCL) \nand  GE  Energy  (GEE)  was  awarded  the  Bibiyana  II  project  in  November  2010.  After  being \nformally  awarded  the  project,  the  consortium  approached  ADB  to  discuss  financing  for  the \nproject,  given  ADB\u2019s  pioneering  role  and  experience  in  financing  the  Meghnaghat  gas  power \nIPP  project,  one  of  the  first  major  private  sector  IPP  projects  in  Bangladesh,  and  its  strong \nsupport for the power sector through sovereign lending. 4 \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n \nThe project involves design, engineering, construction, and operation of a 341 megawatt \n4. \n(MW) combined-cycle, gas-fired power plant to be located on the south bank of the Khushiyara \nRiver about 180 kilometers (km) northeast of Dhaka and 30 km southwest of the town of Sylhet \nin  the  district  of  Habiganj.  The  project  comprises  one  combined-cycle  equipment  train  and \nutilizes a single General Electric 9FA combustion turbine generator, coupled to a heat recovery \nsteam  generator  and  a single  steam  turbine  generator,  as  well  as  other  plant  and  equipment. \nGas  will  be  supplied  to  the  project  through  an  8.8  km  long,  50.8-centimeter  high-pressure \npipeline from the existing Bibiyana gas field. Power will be evacuated from the power plant by \nmeans of 230 kilovolt (kV) or 400 kV transmission lines. \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsors \n\nSBIIPCL is a joint venture between SIMCL (80% ownership) and GEE (20% ownership) \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources.

Manila \n\n \n5. \n(sponsors). \n \n\nbrec/85/85 \n\nbrec/41/58 \n\n \n\n\f2 \n \n\nSIMCL  is  the  holding  company  of  the  Summit  Group  and  is  owned  by  the  group\u2019s \n6. \nfounder,  Muhammed  Aziz  Khan,  and  his  family.  Since  its  establishment  in  1972,  the  Summit \nGroup  has  diversified  into  areas  such  as  power  generation,  trading,  supplying  furnace  oil, \nshipping, storage, inland container depots and freight stations, infrastructure development, and \noptical  fiber  networks.  The  Summit  Group  is  the  first  local  IPP  in  Bangladesh  and  the  leading \nlocal  IPP,  providing  power  to  the  national  grid  through  its  subsidiaries.  The  Summit  Group \ncurrently operates 10 power projects with total generation capacity of 923 MW, which accounts \nfor around 9% of the total power capacity of Bangladesh as of August 2014. . \n \n7. \nGEE  was  established  in  2002  and  is  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  General  Electric \nCompany, the parent company of the General Electric group, through BHA Group Incorporated, \na directly wholly owned subsidiary of General Electric. General Electric, established in 1892, is a \ndiversified  technology,  media,  and  financial  services  company.  The  General  Electric  group \nserves  customers  in  more  than  100  countries  and  operates  through  five  segments:  energy \ninfrastructure, \ninfrastructure,  media  and  entertainment,  capital  finance,  and \nconsumer  and  industrial.  Its  energy  infrastructure  segment  produces  gas,  steam,  and  aero \nderivative  turbines;  generators;  combined-cycle  systems;  and  renewable  energy  solutions,  as \nwell as providing water treatment services and equipment. . \n \n \nB. \n \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n\ntechnology \n\n1. \n\nImpacts \n\n \nThe  project  will  help  alleviate  Bangladesh\u2019s  severe  power  shortage  that  adversely \n8. \nimpacts  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  efforts.  The  project  has  two \nimpacts  (i)  it  will  improve  access  to  electricity  in  Bangladesh  which  will  benefit  households, \nbusiness,  and  industry  and  (ii)  it  will  help  increase  investments  by  the  private  sector  in  power \ngeneration  in  Bangladesh.  Successful  implementation  of  the  project  will  foster  confidence \namong  potential  investors  and  lenders  and  will  promote  further  private  sector  investments  in \nBangladesh\u2019s  energy  sector,  where  few  major  IPPs  of  this  size  have  materialized  since  early \n2000. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n \n9. \nThe  project  outcome  is  increased  combined  cycle  power  generation.  The  project  will \ndispatch around 2,500 gigawatt-hours of generated power annually and employ about 70 people \nduring  operations. 5 The  project  will  install  a  combined-cycle  power  plant    with  low-carbon-\nemission technology.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput \n\n \n10. \nThe  output  is  the  construction  and  successful  full-capacity  commissioning  of  341  MW \npower  plant  by  2016.  About  900  people  are  expected  to  be  employed  locally  during \nconstruction. Furthermore, an estimated $60 million of corporate income taxes are expected to \nbe paid to the government for the entire operating period. \n \n\n                                                \n5  ADB.2011. Manual for Calculating Energy Output Indicators. Manila \n\n\fAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nC. \n \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,  which \n11. \nemphasizes  ADB\u2019s  support  for  infrastructure  projects  that  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and \ninclusive growth through  expansion  of  power  supply.6 The  strategy  seeks  to meet the  region\u2019s \ngrowing  energy  demand  by  helping  developing  member  countries  to  develop  their  economies \nusing environmentally friendly technologies. The strategy also aims to promote a larger role for \nthe private sector in financing infrastructure. \n \n12. \nADB\u2019s  support  for  the  project  is  in  line  with  its  country  partnership  strategy  for \nBangladesh, 2011\u201320157 and the government\u2019s Sixth Five-Year Plan, FY2011\u2013FY2015, both of \nwhich  emphasize  accelerating  growth  by  boosting  private  sector  investment.  The  country \npartnership  strategy  emphasizes  solving  the  power  supply  shortage  and  private  sector \ndevelopment in the power sector. The project will contribute to the reduction of the power supply \ngap, which is one of the most critical obstacles to private sector investment, and will improve the \ninvestment climate for private-sector-led growth and poverty reduction. \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Energy Sector Strategy \n\n \n13. \nThe project is in line with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, and is particularly consistent with one of \nthe  three  pillars  of  that  policy\u2014maximizing  access  to  energy  for  all.8 Access  to  modern  and \nreliable  energy  services  fosters  sustainable  human  development,  economic  growth,  a  higher \nquality of life, and improved delivery of social services. The project will add generation capacity \nand  help  increase  the  reliability  of  electricity  supplies  in  a  country  facing  a  severe  power \nshortage.  Electricity  supplied  by  the  project  will  emit  less  greenhouse  gases  than  the  existing \nfurnace oil power plants or diesel power plants and will be sold at a comparable tariff to those of \nthe other gas power projects, and will not be directly affected by the volatility of the international \ngas market. \n \n \nD. \n \n14. \n \n\nTable 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements.  \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nRegulatory \nframework \n\nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nPursuant to the  implementation  agreement  between  the government,  PGCB,  and  SBIIPCL  the \ngovernment gives direct support to the project with various commitments, including protection for \nthe project against the risk of changes in law and political force majeure and a guarantee of the \nrespective obligations of SBIIPCL\u2019s counterparties to the implementation agreement, PPA, LLA, \nand GSA (all as defined and described below). \nOther government commitments in the implementation agreement include assurances of support \nfor  government  authorizations;  various  tax  and  custom  duties  exemptions;  making  dollars \navailable in Bangladesh; and the right to  open and operate bank accounts  and to transfer and \nrepatriate dollar funds. \n\n                                                \n6  ADB. 2014.

Energy Policy. Manila. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAspects \nImplementation \narrangements \n\n4 \n \n\n \n\nArrangements \nSBIIPCL  entered into  a  22-year  take-or-pay  PPA  with  BPDB,  the state-owned  utility company, \nas the off-taker. The tariff comprises capacity and energy payments which are adjusted to reflect \nchanges in natural gas price, the dollar exchange rate, and inflation. \nThe  term  of  the  GSA  mirrors  the  PPA  term.  The  gas  supplier,  JGTDSL,  a  wholly  owned \nsubsidiary  of  Bangladesh  Mineral  Oil  and  Gas  Corporation  (Petrobangla),  is  liable  to  pay \nSBIIPCL liquidated damages if it fails to supply a minimum quantity of gas to the project. \nPGCB  undertakes  certain  obligations  in  the  implementation  agreement,  including  O&M  of \ninterconnection and transmission facilities for the evacuation of power from the project. \n\nUnder the LLA, BPDB grants SBIIPCL a lease of the project site for the term of the PPA. \n\nAs noted above, the government guarantees the obligations of the BPDB under the PPA and the \nLLA, the PGCB under the implementation agreement, and JGTDSL under the GSA. \n\nManagement \n\nConstruction period \n\nSummit  Industrial  &  Mercantile  Corporation  (Pvt.)  Limited  is  a  pioneer  in  private  sector  power \ngeneration in Bangladesh.  \nThe construction activities started in December 2012. It is anticipated that single-cycle operation \nwill start in March 2015 and combined-cycle operation in January 2016. \n\nConstruction arrangements \nConstruction \narrangements for  \nthe power plant \n\nEPC contractors \n\nConstruction \narrangements for \nthe transmission \nlines and \ninterconnection \nfacilities \nOperation arrangements \nRevenue structure \n\nThe  EPC  of  the  power  plant  will  be  executed  under  EPC  contracts  with  a  consortium  of  the \nNEPC, and CEEC on a lump-sum and turnkey basis. The General Electric Company will supply \na General Electric 9FA combustion turbine generator. \nSpare parts will be provided to SBIIPCL by GE Energy Parts pursuant to the Parts Supply and \nRepair  Work  Agreement  and  maintenance  services  will  be  provided  by  General  Electric \nInternational pursuant to the Maintenance Service Agreement. \nCEEC is a state-owned large energy construction enterprise based in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina owning 14 design institutes and 25 engineering companies.  The NEPC is  a fully owned \nsubsidiary  of  CEEC.  It  was  founded  in  1951  and  has  built  more  than  163  power  plants  and \ninstalled 242 generating units with total installed capacity of 41,607 megawatts.  \nPower will be evacuated from the power plant by means of 230 kV or 400 kV transmission lines. \nThe 230 kV transmission lines already exist. \nSBIIPCL  has  entered  into  a  separate  construction  contract  for  the  construction  of  400  kV \nswitchyard bays and interconnecting transformer with Energypac Engineering Limited. \n \n\nOperation and \nmaintenance \nPerformance \nmonitoring \n\nAll power generated from the project will be sold exclusively to the BPDB throughout the 22-year \nterm of the PPA. \nO&M  of  the  project  will  be  outsourced.  SBIIPCL  will  select  an  O&M  operator  with  sufficient \ntechnical resources to satisfactorily perform the O&M services for the project. \nKey  performance  indicators,  including  output  and  outcome  indicators,  compliance  with  ADB\u2018s \nsafeguards  requirements,  financial  performance,  and  compliance  with  financial  covenants,  will \nbe reported by SBIIPCL and monitored by ADB and other senior lenders. \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  BPDB  =  Bangladesh  Power  Development  Board;  CEEC  =  China  Energy \nEngineering  Group  Company;  EPC  =  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction;  GSA  =  gas  supply  agreement; \nJGTDSL = Jalalabad Gas Transmission and Distribution System Limited; kV = kilovolt; LLA = land lease agreement;; \nNEPC = First Northeast Electric Power Engineering Company; O&M = operation and maintenance;  PGCB = Power \nGrid Company of Bangladesh; PPA =  power purchase  agreement; SBIIPCL =  Summit Bibiyana II Power Company \nLimited. \nSources: Summit Bibiyana II Power Company Limited and lenders\u2019 technical advisor. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n15. \nterm of up to 14.5 years, including a grace period of up to 1.5 years.  \n \n\nADB  will  provide  a  secured  loan  of  up  to  $75 million  to  SBIIPCL.  The  loan  will  have  a \n\n\fValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nB. \n \n16. \nADB\u2019s  active  participation  and  presence  in  the  project  will  provide  comfort  to  the \nsponsors that the government and government entities will continue to support the project in line \nwith the project agreements. Given ADB\u2019s track record and ongoing engagement with both the \ngovernment  and  private  investors  in  the  Bangladesh  energy  sector,  including  policy  dialogue, \ntechnical assistance, sovereign loans, reform programs, and the past financing of a key private \nsector IPP project, investors particularly value ADB\u2019s role in mitigating risks, solving problems, \nand  catalyzing  financial  resources  to  support  private  sector  power  projects  in  Bangladesh. \nMoreover,  ADB\u2019s  contribution  to  promoting  robust  safeguard  practices  and  good  corporate \ngovernance  will  also  add  substantial  value  to  the  development  and  operation  of  the  project. \n \nADB's assistance is considered important for the successful funding of the project as the \n17. \nlong-term financing that ADB will provide is largely unavailable from the commercial market and \nwill  help  ensure  the  project  has  a  sound  cash  flow  structure.  The  long-term  financing  for  the \nproject  helps  amortize  the  capital  expenditures  across  the  economic  life  of  the  assets,  and \nthereby enable the project to operate under the low tariff which will benefit consumers. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n18. \nThe  project  is  classified  category  A  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement,  and  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  The  potential  environmental  and  social \nimpacts of the project have been identified and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website in accordance with \nits Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and effective measures to mitigate the adverse impacts \nare  incorporated  in the safeguard  reports  and plans.  SBIIPCL has  developed  an  environment, \nhealth, safety, and social compliance audit  and a project site social compliance audit, each with \na  corrective  action  plan,  which  were  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  SBIIPCL  has  committed  to \nimplement the corrective action plan to fully comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nThe  project  site  is  surrounded  by  farmland  without  any  environmentally  sensitive \n19. \nreceptors. Natural gas will be supplied from the Bibiyana gas field through an 8.8-km-long, 50.8-\ncentimeter,  high-pressure  pipeline  passing  through  paddy  fields.  The  electricity  will  be \nevacuated to the national grid through existing 230 kV transmission lines or 400 kV transmission \nlines being built through a substation next to the power plant. A 2-km-long paved access road is \nbeing  built to connect the  project  to  the  Dhaka\u2013Sylhet  N2 highway.  The  environmental  impact \nassessment   predicts that  air  pollutant  concentrations,  such as  nitrogen  oxide  and effluents  to \nbe discharged to the nearby Kushiyara River, will meet internationally recognized standards. An \nenvironmental management plan has been developed including monitoring plan, implementation \narrangements, and budget. SBIIPCL has committed to the implementation of the environmental \nmanagement plan. \n \nFour  and  a  half  hectares  of  agricultural  land  were  acquired  in  June  2011  by  the \n20. \nBangladesh  Power  Development  Board  for  the  project.  There  was  no  physical  displacement \ninvolved  as  the  majority  of  the  land  acquired  had  been  used  for  paddy  cultivation  by  14 \nlandowners (affecting the livelihoods of about 120 people) in Parkul village. There were 6 share \ncroppers and 11 agricultural laborers affected by the project. There are no indigenous peoples \nin the project area. ADB considers that SBIIPCL has the institutional capacity and commitment \nto manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n21. \nSBIIPCL  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and  take  measures  to  conform  with \ninternationally  recognized  core  labor  standards  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \nStrategy. 9  Information  disclosure  and  consultations  with  affected  people  are  required  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s requirements and have been complied with.  The project is categorized \nas having no gender elements. Because of the nature of jobs available and working conditions \nat the construction site, employment opportunities for women are limited. However, SBIIPCL will \nensure that women\u2019s needs are considered in the identification of development activities for the \nlocal community. \n \nB. \n \nSBIIPCL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \n22. \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \n \nC. \n \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \n23. \nGovernment of Bangladesh will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance  to  SBIIPCL.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the ADB Board \nof Directors. \n \n\nAssurances \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n24. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  up  to \n$75,000,000  to  Summit  Bibiyana  II  Power  Company  Limited  for  the  Bibiyana  II  Gas  Power \nProject in Bangladesh from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with such terms and conditions as \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the \nBoard. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n \n12 November 2014 \n\n                                                \n9  ADB. 2003.
