I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Nepal for the Kathmandu Valley Water Supply Improvement Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will complement past and ongoing efforts to improve access, efficiency, and \nreliability of water supply services to the residents of Kathmandu Valley.2 While ongoing projects \nare investing in source augmentation, construction of Melamchi tunnel and water treatment \nplant, the project will focus on distribution of water from the treatment plant to consumers, and \nimprovement of efficiency and service delivery. The project will also support and consolidate \ninstitutional development and improvement of governance in the water sector in Kathmandu \nValley. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Current status. Kathmandu Valley is characterized by high population growth of more \nthan 6% per annum and high population density of more than 10,000 per square kilometer.3 The \npopulation of Kathmandu Valley is estimated at 2.72 million in 2011 and 3.50 million in 2016. \nRapid and largely unplanned urban growth, lack of sustainable water sources, and inadequate \npast investments have resulted in poor availability and quality of drinking water.4 Moreover, poor \naccess  to  water  has  caused  increased  disease  incidence,  health  risks,  and  associated \neconomic burdens that disproportionately impact the poor and vulnerable.5 \n \n4.  Development  partnership.  Earlier efforts of the Government of Nepal and various \ndevelopment partners to improve water supply services in Kathmandu Valley have now started \nto achieve the desired results.6 The progress of the Melamchi Water Supply Project and the \nKathmandu Valley Water Services Sector Development Program7 has been encouraging in the \nlast 2 years despite frequent political disturbances and institutional weaknesses. These loans \nwere adversely affected from 2000 to 2006, when several development partners withdrew due \nto the then-prevailing volatile sociopolitical situation and internal conflict in the country leading to \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2006. Technical Assistance to Nepal for Preparing the Kathmandu Valley Water \nDistribution, Sewerage, and Urban Development Project. Manila (TA 4893-NEP). Due to restructuring of ongoing \nloans, the work of the project preparatory TA started in 2009 and the final report was submitted in May 2010. \n3  Sector Assessment (Summary): Water Supply and Other Municipal Infrastructure and Services (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n4  A 2010 baseline survey by an independent consultant (CRISIL) under the project preparatory TA (footnote 2) \nestimates water availability as 20 liters per capita per day and average duration of water supply as 0.4 hours per \nday. Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited, the operator, assesses availability as 45 liters per capita per day. \n5  The World Health Organization has estimated that environmental factors account for 24% of the total burden of \ndisease in Nepal.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Nepal for the Melamchi Water Supply Project. Manila (Loan 1820-NEP, approved on 21 December \n2000 and effective on 28 November 2001); and ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the \nBoard of Directors: Proposed Loans to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Kathmandu Valley Water Services Sector \nDevelopment Program. Manila (Loans 2058-NEP[SF] and 2059-NEP[SF], approved on 18 December 2003 and \neffective on 7 December 2004). The closing date of Loan 1820-NEP was 31 March 2007 and was extended to  \n31 December 2013. Loan 2058-NEP(SF) was closed on 31 December 2008. The closing date of Loan 2059-\nNEP[SF] was 30 June 2011 and was extended to 31 December 2014. ", "2   \nreduction  of  the  project  financing  by  $133  million  from  the  estimated  $464  million. 8  \nConsequently, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a major change in scope and \nimplementation arrangements of these loans in February 2008 to prioritize the use of available \nfunds for source augmentation, i.e., Melamchi tunnel. The Japan International Cooperation \nAgency (JICA), in a parallel financed project, is providing support for a water treatment plant to \nutilize water from Melamchi tunnel. To fully utilize the benefits of ongoing projects, investments \nin the project are necessary and timely. \n \n5.  Lessons. The project was developed using lessons from previous ADB interventions, \nand country assistance program evaluation9 which pointed to the need for strategic clarity and \nprioritization of urban infrastructure investments. The implementation arrangements have been \nkept simple with a focus on using the institutional arrangements created under previous projects \nto  ensure  continued  capacity  building  and  sustainability.  An  important  lesson  from  earlier \nprojects was to give importance to rehabilitation of networks along with creation of assets. \nAccordingly, the project will focus on reducing nonrevenue water (NRW) and improving the \nexisting network. Another lesson is to involve stakeholders; the project has provided adequate \nresources for participation of various stakeholders. Further, as learned from earlier projects, civil \nworks packages have been kept sufficiently large to attract qualified international bidders. \n \n6.  Focus on improvement of efficiencies and service delivery. The project will utilize \nthe district metering areas10 approach to improve efficiencies and reduce NRW from the level of \nmore than 50% to less than 20% in areas where distribution network improvement will be \ncarried out. With the completion of Melamchi tunnel, Kathmandu Valley will receive an additional \n170 million liters per day (MLD) of water, while the current average availability is only 100 MLD \nagainst a demand of 367 MLD.11 The project will introduce 24-hour water supply in at least 10% \nof the service area, which will be selected on techno-economic considerations. The project will \nintroduce a comprehensive asset management plan to minimize the lifecycle costs of procuring \nand maintaining assets. The project will adopt contracts with adequate provisions to monitor \nNRW reduction, and develop geographical information system (GIS) to maximize benefits.  \n \n7.  Context in country programming. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Nepal country \npartnership strategy,12 which aims to support Nepal\u2019s peace and development aspirations by \npromoting the following four pillars: (i) broad-based and inclusive economic growth, (ii) inclusive \nsocial development, (iii) governance and capacity building, and (iv) climate change adaptation \nand environmental sustainability. The project fits into the priority sector \u201cwater supply and other \nmunicipal infrastructure and services\u201d identified in the country partnership strategy and will \nsupport the country\u2019s peace and development through improved access to basic services. The \nproject is included in the country operations business plan of Nepal.13 \n \n \n                                                \n8  The total project cost was estimated as $464 million at 2000 prices, which was to be funded by the Government of \nNepal and a consortium of development partners: ADB, $120 million; the World Bank, $80 million; Japan Bank for \nInternational  Cooperation,  $52  million;  JICA,  $18  million;  Norwegian  Agency  for  International  Cooperation, \n$28 million; Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, $25 million; the Nordic Development Fund, \n$9 million; and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Fund for International Development,  \n$14 million. The World Bank withdrew in 2002, the Norwegian Agency for International Cooperation in 2005, and \nthe Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency in 2006 causing a shortfall of $133 million. \n9  ADB. 2009. Country Assistance Program Evaluation for Nepal. Manila. \n10 A district metering area refers to a zone of a water supply network that can be isolated and provided with a bulk \nmeter to measure input water quantity and consumer meters to measure consumption, the difference is used for \nassessing NRW in the district metering area. \n11 The availability of water varies widely ranging from 70 MLD in the dry season to 140 MLD in the wet season. \n12 ADB. 2009.

The expected impact of the project is sustainable water supply services for residents of \nKathmandu Valley. The expected outcome is improved access, efficiency, and reliability of \nwater supply services to the residents of Kathmandu Valley including poor women and men. \nThe project will prioritize underserved areas and poor sections of the population in Kathmandu \nValley. Piped water through individual household connection will relieve women of the drudgery \nof managing water, thereby giving them more time for social and economically productive \nactivities. The impact and outcome of the project will be closely linked with the success of \nongoing projects. \n \nC.  Outputs \n9.  The project will follow the investment priorities identified in the government\u2019s capital \ninvestment and asset management program, 2010,14 for annual investments in water supply \ninfrastructure in Kathmandu Valley. The project outputs will include the following: \n \n(i)  Output 1: Rehabilitation and expansion of the water supply system. This will \ninclude (a) a bulk distribution system (BDS), distribution network improvement \n(DNI), and service reservoirs; (b) provision of individual connections to citizens, \nespecially the poor and households headed by women; (c) provision of 24-hour \nwater supply in at least 10% of the service area; and (d) efficiency improvement \nin water supply through provision of bulk and individual meters, reduction of \nNRW,  and  reduction  of  energy  losses  in  electromechanical  machinery.  This \noutput will have two distinct geographic areas. DNI areas will be the areas in \nwhich both BDS and DNI works will be implemented and non-DNI areas15 will be \nthe areas in which only BDS works will be implemented. \n \n(ii)  Output 2: Support for operating and financial improvements, and capacity \nbuilding. This will include (a) capacity building; improvement of governance; and \nachievement  of  time-bound  targets  as  per  the  agreed  business  plan  of \nKathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL), the Kathmandu Valley Water \nSupply Management Board (KVWSMB), and the Water Supply Tariff Fixation \nCommission;16 (b) operationalization of the NRW assessment and reduction plan;  \n(c) operationalization of the asset management plan; (d) updating of the water \nsupply GIS database; (e) improvement of KUKL\u2019s responsiveness to customers; \n(f)  community  participation  and  public  education  for  health,  hygiene,  and \nbehavior change in, for example, water conservation, good water management \npractices  including  3Rs  (reduce,  reuse,  and  recycle),  rainwater  harvesting;  \n(g)  a  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  action  plan;  (h)  monitoring  and \nevaluation; and (i) support for project management. This output will continue and \nenhance support being provided under the ongoing loans. \n                                                \n14 The Capital Investment and Asset Management Program 2010\u20132025 was prepared with ADB assistance under the \nproject preparatory TA (footnote 2) and was endorsed by all stakeholders in May 2010. The estimated investment \nrequirements are $250 million for water supply in Kathmandu Valley in addition to the ongoing Melamchi Water \nSupply Project and Kathmandu Valley Water Services Sector Development Program (footnote 7) loans. The project \nwill meet the priority investment needs for 2011\u20132016. \n15 The capital investment and asset management program proposes covering distribution network improvement in a \nphased manner. While a substantial part of KUKL\u2019s service area will be covered with DNI works under this project, \nthe remaining parts of service areas (non-DNI areas) will benefit from increased availability of water.  \n16 KVWSMB is the owner of water supply and wastewater assets. The Water Supply Tariff Fixation Commission is the \nregulator of water supply and wastewater services. The business plan of KUKL, the asset operator, will include \nactions for operating and financial improvements and is under preparation by a team of consultants recruited by \nKUKL under the Kathmandu Valley Water Services Sector Development Program (Loan 2059-NEP[SF]). \n ", "4   \nD.

The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to $80 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to finance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan \nand project agreements. The ADB loan, which is 61.5% of the total project cost, will be used to \nfinance part of the civil works and equipment (output 1) and all components of output 2 including \nconsultants, recurrent costs, transportation, insurance, and financing charges.  \n \n12.  The government will contribute $50 million or 38.5% of the total project cost to finance \ntaxes and duties, resettlement costs, and part of the civil works and equipment. The government \nwill provide the loan proceeds to KVWSMB in a loan\u2013grant mix of 50:50 at an interest rate of 9% \nper annum on the loan portion and a term of 30 years, including a grace period of 7 years. The \ngovernment will provide the counterpart government funds to KVWSMB in a loan\u2013grant mix of \n50:50 at an interest rate of 3% per annum on the loan portion for a term of 20 years, including a \ngrace  period  of  5  years.  KVWSMB  will  provide  the  loan  proceeds  and  the  government \ncounterpart funds  to  KUKL  based  on the  existing  30-year  lease and  operating  agreement \nbetween KVWSMB and KUKL. These arrangements will be described in a subsidiary financing \nagreement, acceptable to ADB, to be signed and effective before KUKL can receive the loan \nproceeds and the counterpart funds. The government will assume the foreign exchange risk. \nThe financing plan is in Table 2.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan  \nAmount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  80.00    61.5 \nGovernment  50.00    38.5 \nTotal    130.00    100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n                                                \n17 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

If JICA cofinancing is confirmed, ADB\u2019s loan will be reduced to  \n$60 million and the government\u2019s counterpart funding will be reduced to $30 million to keep the \ntotal amount at $130 million.18 The financing of BDS and reservoirs under output 1 will be done \nwith JICA funding with a parallel financing mechanism, while the remaining part of output 1 and \ncomplete output 2 will be carried out with ADB and government funds. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 17). A project steering committee will be established and chaired by the \nsecretary, Ministry of Physical Planning and Works, to oversee project implementation. The \nMinistry of Physical Planning and Works will be the executing agency and KUKL, through its \nexisting  Project  Implementation  Directorate  (PID),  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  All \nprocurement of works, goods, and services financed by ADB will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time).

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n15.       Nonrevenue water  assessment  and  reduction  plan.  The water supply system in \nKathmandu Valley is characterized by high NRW.19 Lack of proper metering compounds the \nproblem of NRW assessment. To ensure sustainability of the project operations, KUKL will \nimplement a comprehensive NRW assessment and reduction plan with specific time-bound \ntargets. The project will facilitate integration of the NRW reduction approach in DNI packages as \npart of output 1 and will support KUKL, under output 2, to implement the NRW assessment and \nreduction plan. \n \n16.  Asset management plan. Currently, KUKL lacks focus on timely repair and preventive \nmaintenance of assets. To ensure sustainability of project operations, KUKL will implement a \ncomprehensive asset management plan focusing on an integrated approach to repair, maintain, \nrehabilitate, and replace assets with the objective of minimizing lifecycle costs. The project will \nhelp KUKL implement the asset management plan. \n \n17.  Updating of the water supply geographical information system. Some efforts have \nbeen made to develop a water supply GIS,20 which requires integration on a proper GIS \nplatform. The project will support, under output 2, updating and operationalizing the existing \nGIS. This will be coordinated with an asset condition survey to ensure a consistent approach to \nfuture network development. A proper GIS will improve operationalization of the NRW reduction \nplan and asset management plan. \n \n18.  Coordination with  Melamchi  tunnel. The project assumes availability of 170 MLD \nwater from Melamchi tunnel. Assessment of current progress reveals that completion of the \ntunnel  is  likely  to  be  delayed  from  its  scheduled  completion  in  September  2013,  but  is \nanticipated to be completed by 2014. The utility of BDS and reservoirs is dependent upon \navailability  of  water  from  the  tunnel.  The  project  will  prioritize  implementation  of  the  DNI \ncomponents, which will be useful even without water from Melamchi tunnel. The government will \nmonitor progress of Melamchi tunnel to ensure completion with minimum delay. \n \n19.  Contracts  for  monitoring  nonrevenue  water  reduction.  Special  provisions  for \nmonitoring NRW reduction in DNI packages will be developed and proper conditions will be \nincorporated in the DNI bidding documents to provide incentives for NRW reduction. \n \n \n                                                \n19 The 2010 baseline survey (footnote 4) estimates NRW as high as 55%, though KUKL claims NRW to be around \n40%. These estimates are based on intermittent supply, which will have to be increased substantially if NRW is to \nbe benchmarked against similarly situated water utilities with continuous water supply. \n20 A GIS database of KUKL\u2019s water supply was prepared in 2008 based on computer-aided design digital maps with \nJICA support. Also, the Kathmandu Valley Town Development Committee prepared detailed digital land use maps \nof municipalities in Kathmandu Valley based on aerial photographs taken from late 2006 to early 2007.  ", "    7 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  Economic analysis. The estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 18.1%; \nthe net present value is $20.1 million. The EIRR is higher than the economic opportunity cost of \ncapital estimated at 12.0% indicating sufficiently high economic return. The result is robust \nagainst downside risks, as brought out by sensitivity analysis carried out with (i) capital costs \nincreased  by  10%,  (ii)  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  increased  by  10%,  and  \n(iii) benefits reduced by 10%. The EIRR varies from 14.8% to 18.1%; the most sensitive risk \nfactor is a delay in completing Melamchi tunnel.21 \n \n21.  Financial analysis. The estimated financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is 7.46%; the \nnet present value is $29.37 million. The FIRR is higher than the weighted average cost of capital \nestimated at 3.5% indicating reasonable financial return. The result is robust against downside \nrisks, as brought out by sensitivity analysis carried out with (i) capital costs increased by 10%, \n(ii) O&M costs increased by 10%, and (iii) revenues reduced by 10%. The FIRR varies from \n6.64% to 7.46%; the most sensitive risk factors are an increase in capital costs and decrease in \nrevenues. Based on the proposed tariff schedule, monthly water bills will account for 0.7% to \n1.4%  of  monthly  income,  which  is  significantly  below  the  5%  ratio  generally  assumed  to \ndetermine  household  affordability.  The  project  is  financially  viable  and  affordable  for  all, \nincluding poor households.22 \n \n22.  Financial sustainability. The capacity building and public\u2013private partnership (CBP) \nteam,  mobilized  in  KUKL  under  the  ongoing  Kathmandu  Valley  Water  Services  Sector \nDevelopment Program, will support operating and financial improvements of KUKL. The CBP \nteam will prepare a business plan for KUKL for long-term financial sustainability focusing on  \n(i) rationalization of tariffs to recover O&M costs, depreciation, and financing costs in a phased \nmanner;  (ii)  improvement  of  collection  efficiency;  (iii)  recovery  of  arrears  with  adequate \nprovisioning for bad debts; (iv) adoption of prudential financial norms; and (v) computerization of \noperations and financial management. The operationalization of the asset management plan will \nhelp  KUKL  achieve  higher  operating  efficiencies,  and  better  financial  performance.  The \ngovernment will ensure that KUKL, with support from the CBP team, undertakes preparation, \nadoption,  and  effective  implementation  of  the  business  plan.  Further,  the  government  will \nensure that the tariffs are revised every year to achieve financial sustainability. \n \nC.  Governance \n23.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and PID. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 17). Risk assessment was made with the help of three tools \nspecifically developed for Nepal: (i) peace filter for design and implementation of project, (ii) \ngovernance risk assessment tool, (iii) disaster and climate change risks screening tool.23 Based \non these assessments, some of the mitigation measures incorporated in project design are to (i) \nestablish a mechanism for regular voluntary disclosure of project-related information to citizens; \n(ii) develop and utilize a system of e-procurement; (iii) develop and update a project website to \nenhance  transparency  in  project  implementation,  procurement,  and  safeguards;  and  (iv) \nestablish a grievance redress mechanism to ensure quick and effective relief. \n \n                                                \n21 Details are included in the Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Details are included in the Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Peace Filter for Design and Implementation of Project; Governance Risk Assessment and Management Plan; and \nDisaster and Climate Change Risks Screening Tool (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \n24.  KUKL\u2019s  institutional  arrangements. KUKL\u2019s institutional structure, designed at the \ntime of unbundling the urban water subsector in 2006, is ready for further refinements. The \ngovernment will establish a proper institutional structure to enforce accountability of KUKL to the \ngovernment and citizens, and to ensure sustainability of operations. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  A  poverty  and  social \nanalysis  has  been  completed24  and  the  project  gives  priority  to  connecting  all  poor  and \nhouseholds headed by women to the piped water supply system in the project area. The \ngovernment and KUKL will reform the current water connections policy (2008) to facilitate \nindividual  water  connections  to  the  poor,  socially  excluded,  and  households  headed  by \nwomen.25 Connection fees will be reduced for poor households under the project. A gender \nequality and social inclusion26 action plan was prepared with clear targets, responsibilities, and \nresource allocation. The project has also prepared a community awareness and participation \nplan27 to involve key stakeholders for widespread, ongoing, and meaningful participation. PID \nwill  implement  the  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  and  community  awareness  and \nparticipation plan, with support from the community awareness and participation consultant \nrecruited under the project. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n26.  Social safeguards. The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement \nand category C for indigenous peoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009).28    The  project  does  not  require  any  land  acquisition.  The  impacts  are  limited  to \ntemporary disruption of business activities, and temporary shifting of vendors and hawkers \nduring construction works within the right-of-way for the BDS, and DNI works. A resettlement \nplan,29 including the grievance redress mechanism, was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  A  resettlement  framework30  was  prepared  to  address  small \ncomponents  to  be  defined  through  detailed  design  after  approval  by  the  ADB  Board  of \nDirectors.31 Temporary impacts will be limited and compensation for lost income will be provided \nto those affected as per the resettlement plan. Land required for service reservoirs for the \nproject was acquired under the ongoing Melamchi Water Supply Project. All land is to be made \nready for construction before the first disbursement. No adverse impacts on indigenous peoples \nare anticipated as the project focuses on rehabilitating the existing water supply network in \nurban areas. Meaningful and widespread consultations will continue with all communities in the \nproject area. \n \n27.  Environmental safeguards. The project is classified as category B for environment. An \ninitial  environmental  examination  (IEE)32  and  environmental  management  plan  including  a \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement. The IEE concludes that no significant adverse impacts are anticipated and that the \n                                                \n24 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 KUKL\u2019s existing water connection policy (2008) requires a land ownership certificate and certificate of construction \ncompletion from the respective local authorities. Several poor households cannot meet these requirements and, \ntherefore, are not provided with water connections. \n26 Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Community Awareness and Participation Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 ADB. 2010.

To  mitigate  adverse  impacts  of  increased  generation  of  wastewater,  the \nKathmandu  Urban  Environment  Improvement  Project  has  been  proposed  to  focus  on \nrehabilitating  and  expanding  the  sewerage  network  and  wastewater  treatment. 33   An \nenvironmental assessment and review framework34 was prepared to address small components \nto be defined through detailed design after ADB Board approval. Additional oversight and \nmitigation measures will be taken for pipe-laying works along roads passing through heritage \nareas including permission from the Department of Archaeology prior to construction. The IEE \nand  the  environmental  management  plan  will  be  updated  during  detailed  design  and  be \nincorporated in contract documents. \n \n28.  Climate change adaptation and mitigation. Based on the analysis carried out using \nthe disaster and climate change risks screening tool,35 the project will incorporate, during \ndetailed technical designs, adequate climate change adaptation measures for the risks related \nto earthquakes, landslides, floods, and climate change. The project will facilitate water and \nenergy savings, which will help mitigate the impacts of climate change. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.36 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \nproject are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nTransition to a federal  Development partners will maintain close dialogue with the government and other \nstructure, the peace process,  stakeholders to ensure that the development and reform process is not derailed \nand political instability may  and keeps its momentum beyond the political challenges.
