eligible  transaction  under  the  Faster  Approach  to  Small  Nonsovereign \nTransactions framework.1 The transaction involves a loan facility of up to $20,000,000 (or its yuan \nequivalent) to MicroCred Nanchong Company Limited and MicroCred Sichuan Company Limited \nfor Financing Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises in the Western Region in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC). \n \nThe project entails the Asian Development Bank (ADB) providing longer-tenor financing \n2. \nto MicroCred Nanchong and MicroCred Sichuan to support the companies\u2019 lending operations to \nmicro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in the underdeveloped western region of \nthe  PRC.  By  improving  access  to  finance,  the  project  will  support  the  expansion  of  small \nbusinesses and generation of additional employment opportunities, which will in turn contribute \nto poverty reduction. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDespite rapid economic growth since 1980s, the PRC continues to face regional disparity \nand income inequality. Provinces with the lowest gross domestic product (GDP) per capita are in \nthe central and western regions. In 2016, GDP per capita in the western province of Sichuan was \nonly 33% of that in Beijing. MSMEs represent a vital part of the PRC economy and, given their \nimportant  role  in  employment  generation,  their  development  directly  contributes  to  inclusive \neconomic growth.2 Small businesses with up to 300 employees account for 98.6% of firms in the \nPRC,3 contribute more than 60.0% to national GDP and about 50.0% to the country\u2019s tax income, \nand  generate  more  than  80.0%  of  urban  employment.4 More  jobs  associated  with  the  faster \ngrowth of MSMEs in the central and western regions could help reduce regional disparity. MSMEs \nare  a  major  contributor  to  economic  growth  in  underdeveloped  regions,  but  they  remain \nconstrained by limited access to finance. By the end of 2017, credit to micro and small enterprises \nrepresented only 24.7% of total bank loans.5 Compared with similar enterprises in the east, small \nand medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the central and western regions have more restricted \naccess to finance and face average borrowing costs that are more than 70 basis points higher.6 \n \n4. \nMicrocredit companies. Microcredit companies play an important complementary role in \nfinancing MSMEs. In 2005, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) approved the establishment of \nmicrocredit  companies  to  promote  inclusive  finance  development.  The  microcredit  market  has \ngrown  rapidly,  but  it remains fragmented.  By  the  end of  2017,  the  PRC had  8,551 microcredit \ncompanies  with  total  registered  capital  of  CNY827.03  billion  and  total  outstanding  loans  of \n\n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015.

Beijing. \n\n\fCNY979.95 billion.7 Microcredit companies in the PRC are defined as credit-only companies that \ncannot  take  deposits  and  are  regulated  by  local  Finance  Affairs  Offices  (FAOs). 8  Current \nregulation stipulates that major funding sources of a microcredit company are capital contributed \nby  its  shareholders  plus  donated  capital  and  additional  finance  from  no  more  than  two  banks. \nFurthermore, bank funding to microcredit companies is generally capped at 50% of the microcredit \ncompany\u2019s  net  capital,  which  constrains  expansion.  Some  FAOs  later  issued  local  policies  to \npermit  higher  leverage  limits  for  microcredit  companies  under  their  regulation.  Microcredit \ncompanies are also allowed to operate only within their province of registration. As a result, while \nthe  number  of  microcredit  companies  has  increased  rapidly  since  2005,  individual  growth  is  a \nchallenge.  In  addition,  banks  are  reluctant  to  lend  to  many  microcredit  companies  because \ngovernance, internal controls, and performance standards vary across companies. The banking \nregulator  has  a  cautious  attitude  toward  lending  to  microcredit  companies  as  well,  leading  to \nmicrocredit companies\u2019 heavy dependence on shareholder funding. \n \n5. \nADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations  target  underserved  customer  segments  and  regions \nprimarily through nonbank financial institutions. In its second private sector loan project supporting \nmicrofinance in the PRC, ADB provided $50 million in debt to CFPA Microfinance Management.9 \nADB identified MicroCred Nanchong and MicroCred Sichuan as strong partners in providing credit \nto MSMEs in the underdeveloped western region of the PRC. Both companies are fully owned \nsubsidiaries of MicroCred China Limited (MCL) and are registered in Sichuan, one of the PRC\u2019s \npoorest  provinces  whose  GDP  per  capita  ranks  24th  among  all  31  provinces.  MicroCred \nNanchong was the first foreign microcredit company to enter the country and started its operations \nin Jialing, a district in the city of Nanchong in Sichuan that the central government has designated \nas a poverty-stricken district. MicroCred Sichuan was subsequently established in 2011. The two \ncompanies have built a long and successful record in providing unsecured microloans to MSMEs \nin  Sichuan  province.  At  an  aggregate  level,  MCL  has  strong  shareholders,  sound  corporate \ngovernance,  an  experienced  management  team,  developed  risk  management  systems,  and \nsatisfactory  financial  performance.  MCL  has  experienced  rapid  growth  since  its  establishment \nand  has  plans  for  further  expansion.  Longer-term  ADB  finance  will  provide  critically  needed \nfunding to support its growth, which in turn will improve access to finance for MSMEs in the PRC, \nincluding female micro entrepreneurs in underdeveloped regions. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nBaobab,  a  microfinance  holding  company  based  in  France  and  formerly  known  as \nMicroCred SA, established MCL in February 2007 in Hong Kong, China as a specialized MSME \nfinance investment holding company focused on supporting the PRC. Operating through the two \nsubsidiaries,  MCL  provides  financial  products  and  services  to  micro  and  small  entrepreneurs \nexcluded  from  the  traditional  financial  system.  MCL  is  the  market  leader  among  microcredit \ncompanies  in  Sichuan.  Through  MicroCred  Nanchong  and  MicroCred  Sichuan,  MCL  has \ndisbursed 162,384 loans totaling more than CNY8.89 billion as of March 2018. The company has \na  strong  presence  in  Sichuan,  with  a  network  of  28  branches  and  outlets  under  MicroCred \nNanchong and 15 under MicroCred Sichuan,10 covering most cities and counties in the province. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n                                                \n7  PBOC.  2018.  2017  Statistics  Report  on  Microcredit  Companies.

Baobab has a majority stake in MCL. It also has a majority stake in MicroCred \nAfrica,  which  operates  in  eight  African  countries.  Baobab  was  established  in  2005  to  provide \nsimple  and  affordable  financial  products  to  individuals  and  micro  and  small  businesses \nunderserved by traditional banks. Its main shareholders include the AXA Group, the European \nInvestment Bank, Apis Partners, Maj Invest, and the Nordic Microfinance Initiative.11 The second-\nlargest  MCL  shareholder  is  the  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC).  IFC  has  been  a \nshareholder  since  2007.  KfW  and  Developing  World  Markets,  a  private  equity  fund  manager \ndedicated to socially positive investment, are the remaining shareholders. Integrity due diligence \nwas conducted12 and no significant or potentially significant risks were identified.

MicroCred \nNanchong and MicroCred Sichuan will be coborrowers and be jointly and severally responsible \nfor payment obligations under the loan facility. The loan facility will fund MicroCred Nanchong and \nMicroCred Sichuan lending operations to MSMEs in the underdeveloped western region of the \nPRC.  The  subloans  are  expected  to  primarily  support  the  operation  and  expansion  of  small \nbusinesses in services, trade, and manufacturing, and help generate jobs in local communities. \n \nB. \n \n9. \nwhich will contain terms customary for a loan facility of this nature and amount. \n \nReporting  arrangements.

As local FAOs supervise microcredit companies, MicroCred \nNanchong and MicroCred Sichuan do not have access to deposits and face difficulties in obtaining \nfinance from commercial banks. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n13. \nSupport finance sector development. Microcredit in the PRC is still in the early stage of \ndevelopment and there is vast unmet demand for microcredit from the underdeveloped central \nand western regions of the  country. The loan facility  will support the development of a leading \nmicrocredit company in a poor western province of the PRC, thus contributing to the development \nof this underdeveloped province. \n \nSupport effective gender mainstreaming. The project has gender-specific loan targets \n14. \nand is expected to benefit more than 10,000 female borrowers. The project team has prepared a \ngender action plan to support the effective gender mainstreaming classification of the project.15 \nThis  includes  measures  to  improve  women\u2019s  financial  planning  and  awareness  of  consumer \nprotection issues, increase MCL\u2019s outreach to potential female borrowers, and enhance service \nquality to women through staff training. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Output \n\n \nA. \n \n15. \nImpact.  The  project  will  contribute  to  improved  access  to  finance  by  MSMEs  in  the \nunderdeveloped western region of the PRC as outlined in government plans to promote inclusive \nfinance.16 ADB\u2019s funding will enable MCL, through MicroCred Nanchong and MicroCred Sichuan, \nto scale up its business, reach underserved customer segments, and provide urgently needed \nfunding  to  MSMEs  to  support  employment  generation  and  poverty  alleviation  in \nthe \nunderdeveloped regions. This will help boost income opportunities, reduce poverty in the target \nregions, and contribute to economic development. \n \n16. \nOutcome.  The  project\u2019s  outcome  will  be  the  enhanced  sustainability  of  MCL\u2019s  MSME \nfinance operations in the underdeveloped western region of the PRC. This will help boost income \nopportunities and reduce poverty in the target regions. \n \n17. \nOutput.  The  output  will  be  MCL\u2019s  increased  lending  capacity  to  MSMEs.  Lending  to \nfemale borrowers will be increased and service quality to women will be improved as a result of \nstaff training focusing on the special needs of female borrowers. \n\n                                                \n15 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Government of the PRC. 2015.

Beijing. \n\n4 \n \n\n \n\n\f5 \n \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nB. \n \n18. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports  two \npriorities of the Strategy 2030: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, and (ii) \naccelerating progress in gender equality.17 The Strategy 2030 highlights ADB\u2019s supports for SMEs \nand inclusive businesses to help generate quality jobs and support inclusive growth for all. It is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the PRC18 and ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan, 2018\u20132020 for the PRC, which prioritize promoting inclusive economic \ngrowth,  reducing  poverty  and  inequality,  developing  SMEs,  and  promoting  private  sector \ndevelopment  by  improving  access  to  finance. 19  The  project  also  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  Gender \nEquality and Women\u2019s Empowerment Operational Plan, 2013\u20132020.20 \n \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  aligns \n19. \nwith the Review of 2011 Financial Sector Operational Plan, which noted that ADB will promote \nenhanced  financial  access  for  the  traditionally  underserved,  particularly  SMEs. 21  ADB\u2019s \nMicrofinance  Development  Strategy  called  for  tapping  the  increasing  potential  of  the  poor  by \nexpanding  access  to  microfinance.22 ADB\u2019s  enhanced  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  also  stated \nthat ADB seeks to promote sound and efficient financial markets to improve access to finance \nand  achieve  pro-poor  growth. 23  As  noted,  the  project  builds  on  previous  ADB  support  for \nmicrocredit in the PRC. \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n20. \nCategory  FI  (treated  as  C).  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).24 The business activities of MicroCred Nanchong and \nMicroCred Sichuan have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts and are unlikely to entail \nimpacts on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The loan facility will fund the MSME \nfinance  operations  of  MicroCred  Nanchong  and  MicroCred  Sichuan  in  the  underdeveloped \nwestern region of the PRC, but it will specifically exclude subloans that are classified category A \nor B for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. MicroCred Nanchong \nand MicroCred Sichuan aim to improve the living conditions of clients and their families and to \ncontribute to the development of the local economy. MCL and its operating subsidiaries are also \ncommitted to implementing a fair human resources policy while respecting the environment they \noperate in. At the end of 2017, the average size of MCL\u2019s loans was CNY49,153 and 73% were \nbusiness  loans  in  trade  and  services.  The  size  and  nature  of  these  loans  present  low \nenvironmental  and  no  social  safeguard  risks.  No  land  acquisition,  physical  or  economic \ndisplacement,  or  impact  on  indigenous  peoples\u2019  communities  is  foreseen  in  relation  to  any \nactivities of the sub-borrowers. \n\n                                                \n17 ADB. 2018.

Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n\n \n\n\f21.  MCL  has  its  Manual  of  Environmental  and  Social  Classification  of  Loans.  The  manual \nrequires  all  loans  to  be  screened  against  the  IFC  exclusion  list  and  environmental  and  social \ncriteria and to comply with national and international regulatory requirements. The manual does \nnot prohibit funding projects classified category A or B under company criteria, but caps funding \nat 5% of the portfolio for category A projects and 40% for category B projects. The classification \nsystem appears conservative, with explicit criteria and default categories for different industries \nbased on potential environmental and social risks. Through MicroCred Nanchong and MicroCred \nSichuan, MCL will (i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list; (ii) exclude activities with \ncategory A and B environment and social safeguard impacts from the proposed ADB loan facility; \n(iii)  ensure  that  investments  using  ADB  funds  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009) and abide by applicable national laws and regulations, including labor laws, pursuant to \nADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001); and (iv) take measures to comply  with internationally \nrecognized core labor standards. MicroCred Nanchong and MicroCred Sichuan will confirm this \nin  their  periodic  report  to  ADB  and  need  not  apply  any  other  specific  safeguard  or  social \nrequirements.25 \n \nEffective gender mainstreaming.
