To achieve this, an integrated strategy is\nneeded  to  overcome  a  wide  array  of  issues  and  constraints\ncomprising  inadequacies  in  management,  limited  access  to\nfinance  and  modern \nthe\ntechnology,  and \nregulatory  and  incentive  framework.  The  distortions  and  rigidities\nin  the  tax  and  incentive  systems  and  the  complexity  of  the\ntransactions  costs,  misallocate\nregulatory \nresources, and impede the needed flexibility in decision making if\nSMEs  are  to  become  competitive.  The  absence  of  a  vibrant\nmarket  for  business  services  for  SMEs  constrains  capacity\nbuilding  as  well  as  efforts  to  improve  SMEs  prospects  for\nfinancing by banks. SME access to finance is impeded by the high\ncosts of lending to the sector and by limited capabilities in banks.\nThis  is  reflected  by  limited  use  of  credit  scoring  systems  and\ninformation  and  communications  technology  (ICT)  that  can  help\nbanks  to  better  manage  their  portfolio  and  reduce  the  risks  of\nlending \nlimited  by\nunnecessary  regulatory  and  legal  restrictions  to  more  vigorous\ncompetition in the financial sector, and by limited access of banks\ninternational  capital\nto \nmarkets.  Market  and \nto  promote\nappropriate  lending  methods  and  financial  instruments  is  thus\nessential to sustainable financing for SMEs. It is also essential to\nreducing dependence on external support.\n\nincluding \ninstitutional  development \n\nto  SMEs.  Access \n\nfunding  sources \n\nlong-term \n\nfinance \n\nfurther \n\nto \n\nis \n\n\fiii\n\nClassification \n\nThematic: Economic growth\nGood governance\n\nObjective\nand Scope\n\nThe  objectives  are  to  create  a  dynamic  SME  sector,  enhance  its\ncapabilities  and  competitiveness,  create  jobs  and,  in  doing  so,\nreduce  poverty.  These  objectives  are  to  be  achieved  through  an\nintegrated approach that\n\n(i)  strengthens the enabling business environment for SMEs,\n\n(ii)  catalyzes investment by improving SMEs access to finance\n\nthrough commercial channels, and\n\n(iii) enhances \n\nthe  capacity  of \n\nthe  Sri  Lankan  business\ndevelopment  services  (BDS)  sector  to  efficiently  and\neffectively deliver services to SMEs.\n\nThe  Program  comprises  (i)  a  program  of  policy  reforms;  (ii)  a\nproject  to  finance  a  BDS  support  facility  \u2013  the  Business  Services\nSupport  Facility  (BSSF);  (iii)  a  line  of  credit  each  to  Sampath\nBank,  Commercial  Bank  of  Ceylon  (CBC),  Hatton  National  Bank\n(HNB),  the  National  Development  Bank  (NDB),  and  DFCC  Bank\n(DFCC);  and  (iv)  ADB\u2019s  partial  credit  guarantee  for  commercial\ncofinancing  to  each  of  the  above  banks  for  onlending  directly  to\nSMEs.\n\nThe  Sector  Development  Program  will  set  in  place  a  strategy  for\nSME  development  through  the  completion  of  a  SME  policy  white\npaper  by  a  SME  task  force;  establish  a  SME  Policy  Unit  to\naddress  future  SME-related  policy  and  regulatory  issues,  and\nsupport  an  institutional  response\u2014the  Deregulation  Committee\u2014\nfor  identifying  and  implementing  of  further  policy  and  institutional\nreforms  needed  to  achieve  competitiveness.  ICT  use  will  be\npromoted  as  a  way  to  link  SMEs  with  the  global  economy  and\nreduce  their  costs  of  accessing  information  and  markets.  A  BDS\nsupport  facility  will  be  established  to  develop  the  market  for\nconsulting  and  other  services  to  strengthen  capacities  in  both\nSMEs  and  the  banks  that  may  finance  them.  The  facility  will  be\ncomplemented  by  measures  to  promote  market  and  institutional\ndevelopment  for  SME  finance.  The  market  for  financing  will  be\npromoted  by  legal  reform  that  creates  a  level  playing  field,\nallowing  financial  institutions  to  compete  more  efficiently  for\nmarket  share.  Institutional  development  is  supported  through  the\nICT;  and  by  credit\nuse  by  banks  of  credit  scoring  and \nenhancements  that  raise  their  profile  in  international  capital\nmarkets.  The  Program  will  also  initiate  the  development  of  an\nagenda  for  legal  reform  leading  to  improvements  in  the  legal\nframework  for  secured  transactions.  This  will  be  important  for\nfacilitating non-bank finance for SMEs.\n\n\fiv\n\nAdjustment Costs \n\nThe  SMESDP  is  expected  to  result  in  adjustment  costs  of  up  to\n$90 million.\n\nEnvironmental and\nSocial Assessment\n\nThe  environmental  category  is  B.  Participating  credit  institutions\navailing themselves of the lines of credit will be required to ensure\nthat applicable environmental regulations and measures for social\nprotection are enforced in the projects funded. The poverty impact\nassessment  indicates  positive  long-term  benefits  through  growth\nof employment and income.\n\nThe Sector Development Program\n\nThe Policy Loan\n\nLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\nA  loan  of  SDR  15,808,000  with  the  Government  as  Borrower,\ndrawn  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  a  repayment\nperiod  of  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and\ncarrying an interest rate of 1.0 percent during the grace period and\n1.5 percent thereafter.\n\nProgram Period\nand Tranching  The  period  is  from  December  2001  to  December  2004.  The  loan\n\nwill be released in two tranches as follows;\nTranche 1 of $10 million equivalent, upon\n\n(i) \n\nnotification  of  the  establishment  of  a  President\u2019s  task  force\nfor SMEs;\n\n(ii)  establishment  of  a  deregulation  committee  and  submission\nof  deregulation  studies  on  (a)  a  framework  for  evaluating\ntransactions costs, and (b) tax administration;\n\n(iii)  elimination of the banking turnover tax and Save-the-Nation\n\nContribution;\n\n(iv) \n\nreduction of stamp duty on letters of credit from 2 percent to\n1  percent  and  reduction  in  national  security  levy  by  one\npercentage point;\n\n(v)  establishment  of  a  Cabinet  Subcommitee  to  develop  an\naction  plan  and  modalities  for  the  elimination  of  Sri  Lanka\nTelecoms\u2019  monopoly  in  the  provision  of  telephony  services;\nand\n\n(vi)  establishment of a working group under the Chief Justice for\n\nlegal reform of the financial sector.\n\n\fv\n\nTranche 2 of $10 million equivalent, upon\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nsubmission  of  a  national  strategy  paper,  acceptable  to\nADB,  for  SME  development  by  the  SME  task  force,\nincluding approval and gazetting by the Cabinet;\n\nelimination  of  the  stamp  duty  on  letters  of  credit  and\ncorresponding  unification  of  surcharges  with  import  duty\nstructure;\n\nsubmission of a tax reform strategy paper and action plan\nfor the medium term agreed upon with ADB;\n\nimplementation of the first phase of reduction in corporate\nincome tax, in accordance with a time table  agreed upon\nin the tax reform action plan;\n\nrationalization  of \nthrough\nharmonization  of  all  tax  incentives  in  the  Inland  Revenue\nAct; and,\n\nincentive \n\nstructure \n\nthe \n\n(vi) \n\nelimination  of  Sri  Lanka  Telecoms\u2019  monopoly  in  the\nprovision of telephony services.\n\nExecuting\nAgency\n\nThe  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and\nPlanning.\n\n                  Procurement and\n\nDisbursement\n\nCounterpart\nFunds\n\nThe proceeds of the Program Loan will be utilized to finance the\nfull foreign exchange costs (excluding the local duties and taxes)\nof  imports  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB\u2019s  member\ncountries,  other  than  those  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  item\nand imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources.\n\nThe  policy  framework  for  SMESDP  includes  specific  components\nthat bear distinct costs of structural adjustments. The counterpart\nfunds  to  be  generated  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to\nfinance  the  structural  adjustment  costs  under  SMESDP.  In  this\nconnection,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  social  expenditures,\nespecially in the health and education sectors, will be maintained\nduring the program period.\n\nThe Investment Loan for the Business Services Support Facility (BSSF)\n\nLoan Amount\nand Terms \n\nA  loan  of  SDR  4,742,000  drawn  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds\nresources,  with  the  Government  as  Borrower,  with  a  repayment\nperiod  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  with\nan  interest  rate  of  1.0  percent  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5\n\n\fvi\n\npercent  thereafter.  The  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  the  cost  of\nconsulting  contracts  and  procurement  associated  with \nthe\noperations  of  the  BSSF.  The  Government  will  bear  the  foreign\nexchange risk of the loan.\n\nTime Frame\n\nThe  project  will  start  in  January  2002  and  will  be  completed  by\nDecember 2004.\n\nThe Executing Agency will be the Ministry of Trade and Industry.\n\nExecuting\nAgency\n\nProcurement and\nConsulting\nServices\n\nADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Bidding documents will be\nprepared to ensure maximum competition. No individual procured\nitem  is  expected  to  cost  more  than  $50,000.  Consultants  will  be\nengaged following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n\nThe Investment Loan for the Lines of Credit\n\nLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\nA  loan  of  $60  million,  with  the  Government  as  Borrower,  will  be\nprovided  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital  resources  under  ADB's\nLIBOR-based  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,\nincluding a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate determined in\naccordance  with  ADB's  LIBOR-based \nfacility;  a\ncommitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum; a front-end fee of\n1.0  percent;  conversion  options  that  may  be  exercised  in\naccordance with the terms of the draft Loan Agreement, the Loan\nRegulations,  and  ADB's  Conversion  Guidelines;  and  other  terms\nand conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement.1\n\nlending \n\nTime Frame\n\nThe  loan  will  start  in  January  2002  and  will  be  completed  by\nDecember 2006.\n\nExecuting\nAgency\n\nADB\u2019s Partial Credit\nGuarantee\n\nThe  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and\nPlanning.\n\nA  commercial  cofinancing  of  up \nto  $90  million  equivalent\nsupported  by  ADB\u2019s  partial  credit  guarantee  extended  to  HNB,\nSampath Bank, CBC, NDB and DFCC is proposed. The principal\npayment  will  be  guaranteed  by  ADB\u2019s  partial  credit  guarantee\n(PCG)  and  the  interest  payments  will  be  guaranteed  by  the\nGovernment.  The  Government  will  provide  a  counter  guarantee\n\n                                                          \n1 Until 1 July 2002, the Borrower can choose either LIBOR-based lending or a pool-based single currency lending\nfacility in US dollars and if the LIBOR-based lending is chosen, the Borrower must select the currency of the loan.\n\n\fTechnical\nAssistance\n\nExecuting\nAgency\n\nRisks and\nSafeguards\n\nvii\n\nfor  ADB\u2019s  provision  of  a  partial  credit  guarantee.  In  accordance\nwith the revised policy covering PCGs, ADB will charge for its own\naccount (i) a front-end fee of 90 basis points on the face value of\nthe  PCG,  and  (ii)  a  PCG  fee  of  0.40  percent  per  annum  against\nthe  present  value  of  the  guarantee  obligation.  The  Government\nwill  charge  a  guarantee  fee  of  1  percent  per  annum  against  the\nface  value  of  the  ADB  guarantee,  and  a  guarantee  fee  of  1\npercent  per  annum  against  the  face  value  of  its  guarantee  of\ninterest payments.\n\nTechnical  assistance  (TA)  will  be  provided,  at  the  request  of  the\nGovernment  for  $1.25  million,  financed  from  the  Japan  Special\nFund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  TA  will  include\nsupport  for  (i)  establishing  of  a  SME  baseline  survey  and\nassessments,  (ii)  preparing  of  deregulation  studies  by \nthe\nDeregulation Committee, (iii) preparing of a framework for secured\ntransactions, and (iv) promoting the use of ICT by SMEs.\n\nThe Executing Agency will be the Ministry of Trade and Industry.\n\nThere is a risk is that the enabling environment will remain biased\nagainst  SMEs.  This  is  mitigated  by  (i)  a  consultative  process  in\ndecision  making;  (ii)  the  establishment  of  the  SME  policy  unit,\nwhich  will  periodically  review  the  enabling  environment,  (iii)  a\nderegulation  committee  that  will  develop  deregulation  proposals;\nand (iv) the Government\u2019s commitment to make a public response\nto  the  deregulation  committee\u2019s  report  through  Parliamentary\ndebate on its response, and the reasons for it.\n\nA  second  risk  is  that  the  market  for  BDS  does  not  respond\nsufficiently, thus limiting capacity building for SMEs. While this risk\nis judged to be minor, a related risk is  that the wrong elements of\nthe market respond, wasting resources that are used to solicit aid\nagency  support,  rather  than  serve  the  SME  market  productively.\nThis risk is mitigated by the flexible design of the facility for BDS\nsupport.  Surveys  and  other  methods  will  be  used  to  obtain\nfeedback  and  identify  continuously  the  key  supply-  and  demand-\nside areas needing stimulation.\n\nThird, an inherent risk is that policy and institutional reforms alone\nwill not ensure financing for firms with viable projects. This risk is\npartly mitigated by capacity building for SMEs that will make them\nbetter credit risks, and the provision of significant credit resources\nto financial institutions under the SDP for onlending to SMEs. The\nrisk  is  further  mitigated  by  the  project\u2019s  requirement  that  banks\u2019\nICT  and\ntechniques  and \nadopt  credit  scoring \n\ninvest \n\nin \n\n\fviii\n\nmanagement  information  systems  to  lower  unit  transaction  costs\nof  lending  to  SMEs.    Finally,  legal  reform  that  will  strengthen\ncompetition among banks will mitigate this risk further still.\n\nframework,  which  will  permit \n\nFourth, banks may not be able to lend to SMEs on a sustainable\nbasis because of inability to access long-term funds. This implies\nthe  continued  need  for  aid  agency  or  public  sector  support  to\npromote financing. This risk is partly mitigated by changes to the\nthe  provision  of  public\nlegal \nguarantees  to  a  wider  range  of  financial  institutions  for  the\npurpose  of  facilitating  access  to  finance.  However,  in  terms  of\naccess  to  international  capital  markets,  this  risk  cannot  be  fully\nmitigated  so  long  as  Sri  Lanka  is  unable  to  obtain  a  sovereign\ndebt  rating,  for  which  an  end  to  the  ongoing  civil  strife  is\nnecessary.\n\nthe  pace  of \n\nFinally,  adverse  transitional  consequences  of  restructuring  and\nfrom  affected\nlabor  retrenchment  could  provoke  resistance \ngroups,  slow \ntheir\nsustainability.  This  risk  is  mitigated  by  the  Government\u2019s  strong\ncommitment  to  the  reform  agenda  as  well  as  by  the  provision  of\nfunding  under  the  SDP  to  support  transfer  programs.  In  addition,\nmeasures taken to reduce economic rent seeking are expected to\nstrengthen public confidence in the reform program.\n\nreforms,  and \n\njeopardize \n\n\fI.\n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\n1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  (i)  proposed\nloans  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise\nSector  Development  Program  (SMESDP),  (ii)  a  partial  credit  guarantee  (PCG)  to  selected\nparticipating credit institutions (PCIs), and (iii) a proposed technical assistance (TA) for Enabling\nSmall and Medium Enterprise (SME) Growth.\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nthe  economy, \n\n2.\nIn 2000, the Government of Sri Lanka requested the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s)\nassistance  to  strengthen  the  performance  of  the  SME  sector  as  part  of  ongoing  efforts  to\nimprove  competitiveness,  and  promote  greater\nliberalize  and  diversify \nemployment  and  growth.  An  advisory  TA  for  SME  development  was  approved  in  December\n2000.1  A  survey  of  300  SMEs  was  conducted  under  the  TA,  as  were  a  number  of  diagnostic\nstudies.  The  findings  of  the  studies  indicate  that  the  main  requirements  of  SME  development\nare (i) an improved business environment through deregulation and reform of appropriate laws,\nregulations,  and  institutions  that  either  favor  large  firms  or  act  as  impediments  to  business  in\ngeneral; (ii) better access by SMEs to business services provided by private sector providers so\nas  to  overcome  deficiencies  in  capabilities  and  access  to  markets  and  technology;  and  (iii)\nimproved  access  to  finance  at  market  terms  to  catalyze  investments.  The  diagnostics  also\nstressed the importance of institutional capacity for developing a coordinated strategy for SME\nsupport,  currently  absent  in  Sri  Lanka,  and  the  need  to  apply  the  test  of  sustainability  to  all\npolicy and institutional interventions. The findings are consistent with international best practice,\nwhich has moved from a focus on provision of subsidized credit and TA to SMEs, to one which\nstresses  market  forces  and  fee-based  services  within  a  strategic  framework  that  links  policy\nreform, access to credit, and capacity building.\n\nThe assessment of the SME sector in Sri Lanka was undertaken in an environment that\n3.\nincluded  the  (i)  coming  into  effect  of  a  free  trade  agreement  with  India  in  March  2000,  (ii)\nexpectation of further liberalization of the Indian economy, (iii) phasing out of quotas under the\nMulti-Fiber  Agreement  by  2005,  and  (iv)  implementation  of  World  Trade  Organization\ncommitments  by  the  same  year.  These  changes  herald  an  external  or  global  context  of\ndomestic economic activity characterized by the increasing mobility of capital and the trend for\nproduction  systems  to  organize  across  international  boundaries.  This  has  been  helped  by  a\ndecline in barriers to trade across a wide range of products and economies.\n\n4.\nAs  a  result  of  the  changes,  the  potential  for  attracting  foreign  direct  investment  has\nincreased, as have opportunities for developing new products and geographic markets. At the\nsame time, the implication for policy makers is that it becomes less relevant\u2014if not infeasible\u2014\nto  use  firm-  or  subsector-specific  selective  interventions  to  try  and  manage  domestic  activity\nimbedded  in  a  global  context.  In  fact,  a  clear  role  for  policy  makers  is  to  provide  an  enabling\nenvironment that supports dynamic firms seeking to make investment decisions in response to\nopportunities in domestic and international markets.\n\n5.\nIn  response  to  the  Government\u2019s  request  for  assistance  in  this  undertaking,  a  Fact-\nFinding  Mission  visited  Sri  Lanka  during  9-25  May  2001,  followed  by  an  Appraisal  Mission\n\n                                                          \n1 TA 3578-SRI: Small and Medium Enterprise Development, for $400,000 approved in December 2000.\n\n\f2\n\nduring 12-31 August 2001.2 The Missions reached an understanding with the Government on a\npackage  of  policy  and  institutional  reforms  that  is  to  be  supported  by  the  ADB  loans  and  the\nimplementation  arrangements.  The  Sector  Development  Program  (SDP)  approach  will  provide\nflexibility  and  continuity  in  implementing  the  required  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  The\nunderstanding reached with the Government was reconfirmed by a Consultation Mission fielded\non 11-12 October 2001. The development policy letter, policy matrix for the sector development\nprogram, the program framework, and the organizational framework are in Appendixes 1, 2, 3\nand 4.\n\nA.\n\nThe  Macroeconomic Context\n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR\n\n6.\nFollowing  a  number  of  years  of  growth  at  about  5  percent  per  annum,  economic\nperformance  slowed  in  2001,  with  the  growth  rate  expected  to  fall  to  about  1  percent.  This  is\nlargely  the  result  of  external  factors  including  higher  oil  prices,  slower  growth  in  the  world\neconomy  and  adverse  weather  conditions  that  have  affected  agriculture.  A  further  blow  to  the\neconomy  was  the  decline  in  tourism  revenues  following  the  attack  on  Colombo  airport  in  July\n2001.  This  trend  could  be  exacerbated  in  the  aftermath  of  the  terrorist  attacks  in  the  United\nStates  if  this,  along  with  other  factors,  leads  to  a  further  slowdown  in  the  world  economy.  In\nparallel  with  measures  being  implemented  in  developed  economies,  the  Government  is\npreparing  a  package  of  stimulus  measures,  which,  by  promoting  greater  investment  and\nconsumption, should help in facilitating faster recovery.\n\nHowever, the country\u2019s macroeconomic imbalances are a cause for continuing concern\n7.\nin view of the larger budget and current account deficits and the depletion of foreign exchange\nreserves. To address these imbalances, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a 14-\nmonth  standby  arrangement  of  about  $253  million  in  April  2001.  While  the  Government  has\ngenerally  achieved  the  performance  targets  for  the  end  of  June  2001,  there  is  concern  that  it\nmay have difficulty in doing so for the remaining half of 2001. An IMF review mission is due to\nevaluate  progress  made  in  November  2001.  A  key  issue  is  improvements  to  the  financial\nposition of major public sector institutions.\n\nB. \n\nSector Description and Recent Performance\n\n8.\nSri  Lanka  benefited  from  the  shift  in  the  late  1970s  from  a  strategy  of  inward-oriented,\npublic-sector-led  growth  to  one  which  stressed  growth  of  the  private  sector  and  greater\nopenness  to  the  international  economy.  The  liberalization  of  the  economy  which  followed  was\nsupported by a variety of measures to promote exports and divest the public sector\u2019s ownership\nin a wide range of sectors through the 1980s and much of the 1990s.\n\n9.\nThe sustained liberalization of the economy was accompanied by high investment levels\nand accumulation of capital, increased productivity, and strong employment growth, especially\nin  private  sector  manufacturing.  By  1993,  productivity  in  the  private  manufacturing  sector  had\nsurpassed that in the public sector. The gain in productivity was due partly to increased use of\ninputs such as labor and capital, and partly to improvements in technical or total productivity\u2014or\nthe  efficiency  with  which  the  inputs  of  capital  and  labor  were  used.  Thus,  during  1977-1998,\n\n                                                          \n2  The  Mission  comprised  J.  Ahmed,  Senior  Economist/Mission  Leader;  D.  Hodgkinson,  Sr.  Cofinancing  Officer;  A.\n\nGoswami, Counsel; E. Zhukov, Programs Economist; and S. Chanmugam, Project Analyst.\n\n\f3\n\nproductivity  grew  by  9.2  percent  per  annum  with  a  strong  relationship  emerging  between  the\ngrowth of productivity and the liberalization of trade and investment policy.\n\n10.\nThe  decades  of  reform  have  led  to  significant  structural  change  in  the  economy.  As  a\nproportion  of  the  total  output,  agriculture  declined  between  1978  and  2000,  from  a  little  more\nthan 30 percent to a little less than 20 percent. Over the same period, manufacturing declined\nfrom 18.4 to 16.8 percent as a proportion of economic activity. In contrast, gains were made by\nthe service sector, which grew by more than 10 percent over the same period.  In the last five\nyears however, the manufacturing sector outperformed the service sector and grew faster than\nthe  economy  as  a  whole.  Thus,  while  the  service  sector  now  dominates  economic  activity,\nindustry remains an important sector, particularly when measured by recent changes in output.\nThis pattern is typical of middle-level developing countries.\n\n11. While  SMEs  have  benefited  from  reforms  and  economic  growth,  many  still    exhibit  a\nrelatively  low  level  of  technology,  and  poor  management,  financial  and  accounting  practices.\nThey also face significant difficulties in accessing information, markets and finance.  Limitations\nin capacity are compounded by a business and regulatory environment that raises costs and still\nprovides unnecessary hurdles to the establishment and operation of businesses.\n\nThe  performance  of  SMEs  is  not  easy  to  measure  as  definitions  of  SMEs  have  varied\n12.\nconsiderably  over  the  years  and  among  institutions.  The  present  analysis  shows  that  the\nbusiness  sector  in  Sri  Lanka  is  divided  into  the  following:  (i)  small-scale  enterprises  with  5-49\nemployees,  (ii)  medium-scale  enterprises  with  50-149  employees,  and  (iii)  large  scale\nenterprises with more than 150 employees. On this basis, and in terms of the ISIC classification\nof  industries,  SMEs  are  found  in  all  subsectors  of  the  economy  with  a  concentration  in\nmanufacturing  sector  activities.    SMEs  are  widely  spread  across  urban,  rural,  and  estate\nsectors. Within the urban sector their presence is predominantly in secondary and tertiary type\neconomic  activities,  while  in  the  rural  and  estate  sectors  they  are  heavily  concentrated  in\nprimary and secondary type economic activities.\n\n13.\nIn manufacturing, SMEs account for 95 percent of establishments, 25 percent of output\nand 34 percent of employment. If knitting and wearing apparel are subtracted\u2014both subsectors\nwith large-scale producers\u2014the SME share of employment in the manufacturing sector rises to\n49 percent of the total. Thirty percent of SMEs produce for export markets. There are numerous\nsmall  exporters,  and  the  share  of  value  added  by  SMEs  is  high  in  sectors  where  the  ratio  of\nexports  to  total  production  is  high.  A  similar  result  holds  with  skilled  labor:  sectors  with  high\nskilled  labor  inputs  are  those  in  which  SMEs  have  a  high  proportion  of  value  added.3  This\nsuggests  a  relatively  dynamic  sector,  something  confirmed  by  the  ADB  survey  findings  that\nshow that two thirds of SMEs consider themselves to be profitable.\n\nOn the other hand, medium-size firms account for only 6 percent of establishments\u2014the\n14.\nmissing  middle that  is  typical  of  most  developing  member  countries.  Furthermore,  the  output\nand employment in the SME sector have declined since 1983, from 30 percent and 47 percent\nrespectively. This is not a cause for concern if SMEs are subject to dynamic change and grow\ninto larger firms. In Indonesia, 25 percent of the output of large firms is found to be that of firms\nthat were once SMEs and had grown. The concern in Sri Lanka is the presence of regulatory\nand other constraints that impede this kind of transition.\n\n                                                          \n3  Based on studies prepared during project preparation.\n\n\f4\n\nC.\n\nConstraints and Issues\n\n1.\n\nLack of an Overall Policy for the SME Sector\n\n15.\n\nThe principal constraints at the strategy and policy level are\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nabsence of a coherent SME sector strategy or development plan,\n\nlack of private sector participation in policy formulation and administrative reform,\nand\n\nlack of monitoring and evaluation capacity to measure policy impact and compile\ndata to serve as a basis for future policy decisions.\n\n16. With  numerous,  independent  initiatives  in  support  of  SMEs,  the  absence  of  an  overall\ncoordinating  mechanism  leads  to  loss  of  efficiency\u2014due  to  duplication  of  efforts  and  no\napplication of lessons learned\u2014and lack of an effective strategy for the SME sector as a whole.\nThere  is  therefore  an  opportunity  to  establish  a  mechanism  that  would  coordinate  the\ndevelopment  efforts  for  the  sector.  In  particular,  there  would  be  major  value  to  a  high-level\nstatement  of  the  nation\u2019s  SME  policy  that  is  periodically  updated  and  reaffirmed.  Given  the\nabsence  of  reliable  data  on  the  sector,  there  is  a  need  to  develop  of  an  information  base\u2014\nregularly updated\u2014that will collect information on the sector to allow policy makers and SMEs to\nbe better informed and hence more effective in their continuing efforts to develop the sector.\n\n2. \n\nHigh Transaction Costs\n\n17.\nSMEs  experience  difficulties  with  the  complexity  of  the  regulatory  framework.  A\nsignificant number of firms cite the need to make unofficial payments. Medium and large firms\nassign an average of two full-time staff to deal with regulatory compliance issues. The cost of\ncomplying with the regulatory framework, in terms of both time and money 4 shows the economy\nsuffers from high transaction costs, both in starting new companies and operating existing ones.\nA recent cross-country study of 75 countries found that starting a company imposed a cost of\nabout 9 percent of per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in Sri Lanka in terms of compliance\ncosts and use of time. In contrast, in most middle income countries, this cost was found to be\nabout 1-2 percent of per capita GDP. This cost is negligibly small in developed economies. At\nthe country specific level, ADB\u2019s studies show that an average of 82 days is needed to obtain all\nclearances to start a business (although in practice firms do not wait for the official clearance to\nstart)  at  an  average  cost  of  about  SLRs5,800.  Both  the  international  and  the  ADB  studies\nsuggest that these costs are the result of a regulatory structure that has evolved in response to\nopportunities  to  generating  additional  income  for  state  functionaries.  For  SMEs,  this  difficulty\ntends to be in respect of getting approvals for environmental issues, connections to utility, etc.,\nmuch of which is facilitated for large firms by the Board of Investment (BOI).\n\n18.\nLarge firms are better able to handle transaction costs and are able to spread them over\na larger output base. SMEs are less able to do this and suffer disproportionately, leading many\nto opt out of the formal sector or choose to remain small. Transaction costs thus influence the\nsize of firms: in high-cost economies firms choose to integrate vertically and thus do internally a\nrange  of  activities  which,  in  a  more  transparent  regulatory  framework,  they  would  have\n\n                                                          \n4 Total transactions costs will include the cost of production as well as that of regulatory compliance; furthermore, a\n\ndistinction is made between compliance costs for start-up and for continued business.\n\n\f5\n\ncontracted out to other, usually smaller, firms. A major and systematic review of the regulatory\nstructure  to  identify  and  remove  the  major  bottlenecks  to  capacity  expansion  and  new\ninvestments  will  reduce  the  costs  of  doing  business  and  improve  the  prospects  for  SMEs  to\ngrow  and  establish  links  with  other  firms.  Efforts  to  develop  subcontracting  linkages  between\nlarge and small firms will benefit as will prospects for SME clusters as these also presuppose\nservice  relationships  between  the  cluster  and  large  firms.  A  number  of  developing  member\ncountries have established bodies for deregulation which are typically tasked with preparing of\nstudies and investor road maps for the Government  to simplify business approval procedures\nand reduce compliance costs and the costs of doing business in various sectors. Such bodies\nrepresent  cutting-edge  responses  to  the  need  to  maintain  competitiveness  in  the  international\neconomy.\n\n3.  Complex Incentive Structure\n\n19.\nThe  tax  system  in  Sri  Lanka  is  a  crucial  element  of  the  incentive  structure.  Given  the\ncomplexity  and  uncertainty  of  the  present  tax  system,  many  small  firms  choose  to  remain\ninformal. For such firms the key issues are high transactions costs from the system of archaic\nstamp duties that cover both imports and domestic goods, tax rates that are higher than rates\navailable to large firms, and complexity that leads to uncertainty as well as procedural difficulties\nin compliance.\n\n20.\nStamp  duties  are  inefficient  tax  instruments.  They  are  levied  on  all  instruments  and\ndocuments required for proof of a transaction in Sri Lanka. Some 39 categories of stamp duties\nexist  for  bank  checks,  bills  of  exchange,  travelers  checks,  credit  cards,  mortgages,  insurance\npolicies, salaries, commercial invoices, construction contracts, bonds, bank guarantees, etc. All\ncould be eliminated with major improvements in efficiency. About 60 percent of revenues from\nstamp duties are collected (by Customs) on letters of credit and commercial invoices and from\nissue of Treasury Stamps.\n\n21.\nTax and investment incentives and exemptions are announced in the budget, sometimes\nprovided  under  the  auspices  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act  by  the  Treasury,  and  sometimes\nthrough the BOI Act. The budget frequently leaves unclear the authority for the provision of the\nincentive. BOI has some 23 categories of firms and sectors  that receive incentives in the form\nof lower corporate tax rates, duty exemptions, and tax holidays of various lengths. The Treasury\nprovides  a  similar  range  of  incentives  for  a  similarly  wide  range  of  sectors.    These  incentives\ntypically  cannot  be  accessed  by  SMEs,  resulting  in  a  situation  in  which  SMEs  are  liable  to\nhigher corporate tax rates than paid by most large firms.\n\n22.\nThe  most  serious  effect  of  the  complex  incentive  structure  is  in  terms  of  allocation\nefficiency; investment activity is distorted between investments favored and not, and there is no\nlevel playing field. This issue is especially relevant given the use of different rules for different\ncompanies.  The  current  incentive  structure  also  imposes  great  administrative  strain.  The\nadministrative  capacity  at  the  Inland  Revenue  Department  (IRD)  is  particularly  limited,  with\nmany enterprises benefiting from tax holidays not even filing income tax returns, and the office\nhas difficulty in keeping track of incentives.\n\n23.\nThe  system  of  direct  taxes  includes  the  National  Security  Levy  and  the  Financial\nInstitutions Levy. Revenue from the National Security Levy accounts for 2.7 percent of GDP; for\nthe Financial Institutions Levy, it is 0.1 percent of GDP; and that the turnover retail tax by the\nprovincial  councils,  0.15  percent  of  GDP.  Turnover  taxes  increase  the  incentive  for  vertical\nintegration of activities within firms. In contrast, the goods and services tax (GST) is a VAT-style\n\n\f6\n\ntax.  A  major  policy  objective  of  tax  policy  reform  is  to  eliminate  turnover  taxes,  increase  the\nGST,  and  expand  its  coverage  by  eliminating  the  sectors  that  are  currently  exempted\n(electricity, public transportation, petroleum, and agriculture).\n\n4. \n\nTax Administration and Public Sector Governance\n\n24.\nBoth  SMEs  and  large  firms  cite  tax  administration  and  the  customs  as  major\nimpediments to doing business. The IRD\u2019s outdated organizational structure focuses on type of\ntax,  rather  than  function,  and  prevents  specialization  and  improvement  of  skills.  This\norganizational  structure  and  a  fragmented  computer  system  impede  communication  within  the\norganization  and  reduce  productivity.  The  high  status  of  specific  departments  (e.g.,  Large\nTaxpayer Unit) affects staffing problems and morale, and transfers result in loss of accumulated\nskills.  Many  units  lack  staff,  and  many  others  lack  skilled  workers.  Outdated  administrative\nprocedures  and  weak  enforcement  mechanisms  have  resulted  in  low  compliance  and  very\nlimited success in widening the tax net and in pursuing defaulters. The tax net has been eroded\nthrough exemptions, especially those provided by BOI. There is duplication in key activities and\nservices that IRD and Customs provide.  The public has a poor perception of IRD.\n\n25.\n  While  IRD  clearly  needs  to  be  restructured,  care  needs  to  be  taken  to  not  repeat  the\ndrawbacks and failures of previous reform efforts in Sri Lanka and elsewhere. Shortcomings in\nthe traditional model of civil service reform has led to the recognition that insufficient attention\nhas been paid to appropriately structuring incentives within the public sector and in building up\nits  human  capital  and  administrative  capacity.  This  is  underscored  by  the  experience  of  a\nnumber  of  developing  and  developed  economies,  which  have  stressed  the  importance  of\nautonomous, professionally run, and performance-based public sector institutions in promoting\nthe productivity of the private sector. The key principles emerging from this experience follows:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nKey services must be delivered by discrete, autonomous institutions or agencies.\n\nAgencies must control their budgets, personnel systems and management\npractices.\n\nTo attract talents needed, agencies Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and other\nstaff must be paid adequately.\n\n(iv) \n\nCEOs and the agency must have performance contracts.\n\n(v) \n\nAgencies must develop annual performance targets and 3-5 year strategic plans.\n\n(vi) \n\nPeriodical reviews must be held to determine agency performance.\n\n26. When  applied  effectively,  public  sector  reforms  based  on  these  principles  have  had\nstriking  impacts  in  increasing  operational  efficiency.  This  is  being  increasingly  observed  in  tax\nadministration  in  many  developing  countries,  which  are  moving  to  simplify  tax  policies  and\nstrengthen  administrative  capacities  by  establishing  of  functionally  oriented,  autonomous\nauthorities.\n\n\f7\n\n5. \n\nLimited Market for Strengthening Business Capabilities\n\n27.\nPromoting the demand and efficient supply of business development services (BDS) is\ncritical to ensuring a dynamic SME sector.5 The demand  varies across sectors, and is strongest\nin the textiles, wearing apparel, and leather sector. Most SMEs value the use of BDS for project\npreparation. Smaller firms prefer to seek BDS support for long-term issues such as marketing\nand gaining access to technology. Available BDS support ranges from traditional forms of class\nroom  training  on  entrepreneurship  and  marketing  to  sophisticated  attempts  to  foster  public-\nprivate partnerships in providing of business information services. While there are schemes for\ndifferent types of SMEs (starters, non-growers/slow growers, and fast growers), there does not\nappear  to  be  an  overall  strategy  that  aims  at  developing  assistance  packages  in  accordance\nwith the needs of specific types of SMEs. Broadly, Government agencies are most prominent in\nto  starters  and  non-growers/slow  growers,  while  nongovernment\nproviding  support \norganizations  (NGOs)  concentrate  on  microenterprises  with  the  business  chambers  playing  a\nmore important role in providing assistance to fast-growing firms.\n\nMost Government programs can be characterized as pilot projects with a limited number\n28.\nof  beneficiaries.  These  programs  are  typically  one-shot  interventions  with  budgets  and  human\nresources  not  allowing  for  return  visits  and  further  support  at  a  later  stage.  Outreach  and\nparticipation rates of these programs remain low, especially in the rural areas. Based on direct\ndelivery  of  services,  these  schemes  do  not  charge  fees  and  therefore  have  no  credible\nmechanism for feedback, assessment of impact, or redesign. They are primarily supply driven\nand are unable to provide SMEs with the services they value. Similarly, aid-funded programs\u2014\neven  those  that  provide  assistance  to  BDS  providers\u2014have  often  tended  to  be  supply-driven\nand dependent on subsidized funds. This has resulted in the source of finance - the aid agency\n- being seen as the ultimate client, rather than the SMEs. Organizations such as associations\nand  chambers  of  commerce  are  not  always  clear  on  their  role  in  promoting  SME  growth,\nparticularly whether or not they should stimulate the use of BDS or deliver BDS services. These\ninstitutions are missing an opportunity to play a critical, beneficial, and financially rewarding role\nin brokering the use of BDS by their members.\n\n29.\nPartly because the sector is receiving considerable external support, there is reasonably\nwidespread  access  to  BDS  throughout  the  country.  In  addition,  some  aid  agencies  are  now\nfocusing on sustainability and have adopted the for-fee concept. Several for-profit private firms\nare operating throughout the country and are active in product development and adaptation for\nthe different needs and segments of the market. However, private sector BDS providers are not\ncarrying out sufficient product adaptation or market assessments to develop their markets. Too\noften the same product is being presented to too broad a range of clients. Moving closer to the\nclient  needs  on  a  case-by-case  basis  is  required.  The  important  information  technology  (IT)\nsector  is  poised  to  assist  the  growth  of  SMEs.  The  availability  of  IT-related  BDS  services  is\nimproving, resulting in lower costs and more opportunities for the SME sector as a whole.\n\n30.\nSubstantially  higher  participation  rates  will  require  increased  involvement  of  the  private\nsector in delivering BDS to SMEs. A key issue is the impact of direct provision of BDS by the\npublic  sector\u2014whether  Government  or  externally  funded,  whether  on  subsidized  or  on\n                                                          \n5 \n\nIn the context of this project, BDS are defined as a broad range of nonfinance services\u2014of both a strategic and\noperational nature\u2014critical to the entry, survival, and growth of SMEs. BDS are a dynamic response to the needs\nof the market. As such, BDS encompass more than training and management consulting, and also include, e.g.,\nmarketing  services,  outsourcing  activities  (e.g.,  payroll  firms,  accounting);  information  technology  (IT)  services,\ntechnical services (e.g., design, engineering, etc.); finance brokering, and more. The mix is constantly changing\nas the SME market evolves and grows.\n\n\f8\n\ncommercial  terms\u2014on  the  market  for  local  providers.  Best  practice  suggests  that  direct  public\nsector provision of BDS undermines the growth potential of local commercial providers from the\nprivate sector. The alternative is to focus on the development of a well-functioning BDS market\nthrough  interventions  that  facilitate  and  strengthen  the  supply  side  while  helping  to  stimulate\ndemand by SMEs.\n\n6.\n\nGovernment Provision of BDS: The Industrial Development Board\n\nThe Industrial Development Board (IDB) is a major but inefficient provider of BDS. It is\n31.\nnow a part of the Ministry of Trade and Industry and was established in 1969 during the import\nsubstitution phase of development. It retains a staff of 630 of whom 70 are extension workers,\nand  offers  a  wide  range  of  services  to  SMEs.    IDB  has  developed  a  range  of  programs  and\nprojects  for  SMEs  that  include  (i)  incubator  schemes  for  SME  start-ups,  (ii)  setup  of  one-step\nregional  industrial  services  to  facilitate  quick  and  easy  access  to  information,  (iii)  young\nentrepreneurship program to guide university graduates to successfully develop their own small\nbusiness, and (iv) the Wasantha SME facilitation program.\n\n32.\n  IDB  relies  on  the  Government  for  80  percent  of  its  budget  and  many  of  its  services\ngenerate little demand or revenue from SMEs.  IDB has substantial technical know-how that is\nnot effectively used for SMEs. To be a more effective organization, it should be restructured and\nrefocused on an appropriate target group of firms and on an appropriate mission. IDB will need\nto  charge  fees  for  its  services  in  the  future  and  refocus  its  activities  to  facilitating  SMEs  and\nSME service providers. IDBs new role is expected \u2013 over the long run - to involve a substantial\nreduction in its staff through voluntary schemes for retirement.\n\n7.\n\nMarket and Institutional Development for Sustainable Finance\n\na. \n\nBanks and Other Institutions\n\n33.\nThe Sri Lankan financial sector has 27 commercial banks, 42 depository institutions (a\nnational savings bank, 24 finance companies, and 17 regional rural development banks), three\nstate-sponsored  long-term  financial  institutions  (2  DFIs  and  one  state  mortgage  bank)  six\ninsurance companies and two public pension funds. The commercial banks comprise 2 state, 7\nlocal,  and  18  foreign  banks.  During  the  last  decade,  the  financial  sector  represented  a\nsubstantial  part  of  the  GDP  growing  to  more  than  10  percent  of  the  economy.  In  the  last  five\nyears, the commercial banks\u2019 total assets grew from 14 to 18 percent annually from SLRs389.7\nbillion in 1996 to about SLRs678 billion in 2000. Total loan assets increased in about the same\nannual  percentages  from  SLRs202.4  billion  in  1996  to  SLRs356.6  billion  in  2000.  Total\ncommercial  bank  deposits  also  increased  at  a  healthy  clip  from  SLRs261.9  billion  in  1996  to\nSLRs445.6 billion at end-2000.\n\n34.\nState-owned banks hold almost 60 percent of total banking assets, and the five largest\nprivate commercial banks hold more than 30 percent of the remainder. All compete for deposits\nfrom the public. The state banks have a nationwide branch network, but remain highly inefficient\nand  massively  undercapitalized.  The  major  private  commercial  banks  have  widened  their\nnetworks  to  cover  almost  the  entire  country,  including  Jaffna.  The  three  leading  commercial\nbanks  \u2013  Hatton  National  Bank  (HNB),  Commercial  Bank  of  Ceylon  (CBC)  and  Sampath  Bank\n(SB)  have  over  200  branches  in  aggregate  nationwide.  CBC  and  Sampath  Bank  are  seeking\ngreater  prudential  safety  and  security  through  diversifying  what  were  once  loan  portfolios\nconcentrated in financing large enterprises. HNB has been an innovator in SME lending in Sri\n\n\f9\n\nLanka and one of the earliest to recognize that lending to SMEs can be profitable and provide a\ncushion to the bank in times of economic decline.\n\nb.\n\nAbsence of Level Playing Field for DFIs and Commercial Banks\n\n35.\nHigh  unit  lending  costs  to  SMEs  and  higher  perceived  risks  limit  bank  financing  to  the\nsector.  Yet  international  experience  indicates  the  role  that  policy  reform  and  capacity  building\ncan  play  in  promoting  the  market  and  institutional  development  needed  to  ensure  sustainable\nfinance for SMEs at commercial terms. In terms of the market, the objective is to use a variety of\ninstruments\u2014including  promotion  of  competition,  provisions  of  public  guarantees,  etc.\u2014to\ninduce financial institutions to direct greater flows of financial resources on commercial terms to\nmeet  SME  needs.  In  terms  of  institutional  development,  the  objective  is  to  ensure  that  these\ninstitutions  have  appropriate  lending  methodologies,  trained  staff,  ICT,  and  internal  incentive\nsystems to serve the market effectively.\n\n36.\nMarket  and  institutional  development  requires  that  both  DFIs  and  private  commercial\nbanks  in  Sri  Lanka  are  equally  encouraged  to  provide  lines  of  credit  to  SMEs  without\ndiscriminatory impediments to either DFIs or private banks. Historically, the DFIs have met the\nSME sector\u2019s credit needs but this is no longer sustainable and access needs to be widened to\nthe private commercial banking sector. The current legal environment in Sri Lanka poses some\nimpediments to this. Stemming from the Banking Act of 1988 (Act No. 30 of 1988) as amended,\nDFIs  are  unable  to  provide  foreign  currency  loans  in  the  same  fashion  as  private  banks.  This\nmay have significance for purposes of lending to, for example, export-oriented SMEs that would\nhave demand for foreign currency loans. In this regard, the competitive pressures between DFIs\nand private banks with regard to foreign currency loans to SMEs are artificially constrained by a\nlegal impediment that no longer matches the reality of the market-driven blurring of the lines in\nthe operations of DFIs and private banks.\n\nThe need for nondiscriminatory treatment of commercial banks and DFIs is underscored\n37.\nby the nature of institutional and market development in the financial sector in Sri Lanka. This is\ncharacterized by an increasing blurring of the line between DFIs and private banks. Sri Lanka\u2019s\nDFIs  are  increasingly  moving  in  the  direction  of  universal  banking.  Thus,  the  National\nDevelopment  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  (NDB)  has  taken  over  the  banking  operations  of  ABN  AMRO\nBank  in  Sri  Lanka  and  obtained  regulatory  approval  to  form  NDB  Bank  as  a  wholly  owned\nsubsidiary.  Second,  DFCC  Bank  (formerly  the  Development  Finance  Corporation  of  Ceylon)\nowns  29.9  percent  of  CBC  and  the  Government  through  the  Insurance  Corporation  owns\nanother 29.9 percent of CBC, which is treated as a private bank. Second, in the context of SME\ndevelopment, it will be necessary to channel credit by private banks to SMEs alongside the DFIs\ncredit  to  SMEs.  This  is  important  not  merely  in  terms  of  the  overall  credit  demands  of  the\npotentially dynamic SME sector but also because of the need to allow SMEs to grow into larger\ncorporations in the portfolio of private banks.\n\n38.\nCommercial interests and competition for deposit and loan customers have led a number\nof  the  commercial  banks  to  lend  more  aggressively  to  SMEs  despite  a  shortage  of  resources\navailable  to  do  so.  Banks  such  as  Sampath,  HNB  and  CBC  are  playing  a  leading  role  in  this\nregard. These banks have developed several deposit products to reduce their matching risk for\nthis  lending.  There  are  now  time  deposit  mechanisms  that  allow  banks  to  fund  term  loan\nfacilities  of  five  years  or  longer  and  there  have  been  several  issues  of  debentures  by  PCIs.\nBranch  networks  have  also  been  extended  into  rural  areas.  Although  encouraging,  these\nresource mobilization activities will first and foremost fund activities that carry less relative risk\n\n\f10\n\nfor  the  banks,  such  as  housing  loans,  and  then  be  available  for  lending  to  SMEs.  Also,  their\nvolume is limited, given the relatively high short-term interest rates.\n\n39.\nThough  considerable  ground  remains  to  be  covered,  efforts  at  learning  about  SMEs,\nphysically locating branches closer to the areas of economic activity, and raising funding for on-\nlending to SMEs are helping to mitigate the problem of access to finance. Despite these positive\ndevelopments,  bankers  still  report  a  dearth  of  bankable  deals  and  a  heavy  reliance  on  real\nestate as security. Training in SME lending would benefit the PCIs. While PCIs have received\nTA  over  the  years  in  lending  techniques  based  on  cash  flow,  such  training  tended  to\nconcentrate on structuring the loan repayments according to the projected cash flow; insufficient\nattention was paid to the important skill of counseling. Additionally, there remains the problem of\nhigh unit transaction costs in processing relatively small SME loans.\n\nc.\n\nUse of Information Technology and Credit Scoring\n\n40.\nPromoting  the  use  of  IT  and  credit  scoring  is  a  powerful  way  to  minimize  the  high\ntransaction  costs  associated  with  SME  loan  management,  a  key  constraint  to  greater  and\nsustained lending to the sector.  Credit scoring software allows a bank to achieve a faster, more\nconsistent series of decisions and reduces bank administrative costs for smaller loans. Prudent\nuse  of  properly  developed  loan  scoring  methods  has  the  potential  to  reduce  loan  processing\ntime from 6 to 2 weeks down to a few days for most SME loans. The second benefit of credit-\nscoring software is that it is a tool that promotes consistency across the bank. One danger of a\nmanual credit investigation process is that the final loan decision may be skewed by the internal\nincentive system of a bank. For example, when bank staff members, such as loan officers and\nbank  managers,  receive  financial  incentives  for  extending  new  loans,  they  will  frequently\nconcentrate on quantity rather than seek out quality loans with a high probability of repayment.\nThe use of credit-scoring technology can remove a substantial proportion of the discretion from\nloan officers and branch managers, to the overall benefit of the institution.\n\n41.\nThe  benefits  of  credit  scoring  are  maximized  through  use  of  integrated  computer\nsystems.  A  modern  computer  system  is  able  to  track  loan  quality  indicators  that  are  ordinarily\ndifficult to obtain in a timely manner by manual calculation. A useful indicator is the portfolio at\nrisk (PAR). PAR shows the quality of the loan portfolio and, by association, the effectiveness or\notherwise of the overall loan management policies of the bank. Well-managed banks have a low\nPAR and vice versa. Systems such as Globus are able to track PAR on loans at individual loan\nand branch levels. Globus also allows senior managers to directly review the PAR of the loan\naccounts  of  the  responsible  loan  officer.  Importantly,  as  PAR  information  is  available  at  loan\nofficer  level,  it  is  relatively  straightforward  to  develop  an  incentive  system  that  links  PAR  to  a\nloan officers/branch managers\u2019 bonus scheme.\n\nd.\n\nAccess to Nonbank Finance\n\n42.\nIn the medium term, a dynamic SME sector will need access to not only bank finance,\nbut to nonbank finance as well. While the latter is often cheaper, it requires a legal provision for\nthe use of movables for collateral.  The absence in Sri Lanka of a modern legal framework for\ncreating,  prioritizing,  and  enforcing  of  security  interests  in  movable  property  (also  known  as  a\nsecured transactions legal framework) is a critical factor in the SMEs\u2019 lack of access to readily\navailable, cheap, and long-term credit. This absence is particularly acute for SMEs, since they,\nunlike  larger  enterprises,  are  less  likely  to  have  immovable  property  that  can  be  offered  as\ncollateral to secure loans from creditors.\n\n\f11\n\nOne  of  the  effects  of  the  lack  of  an  upgraded  secured  transactions  legal  framework  is\n43.\nthat sources of credit are concentrated on bank credit since the legal system does not allow for\na diversified set of potential creditors, such as suppliers of goods, to take effective security over\nmovable  property.  Debtors  are  unable  to  use  their  inventories  and  accounts  receivable\neffectively as collateral for credit from such nonbank creditors.\n\n44.\nA  review  of  recent  legal  reform  efforts  in  Sri  Lanka  indicates  that  such  efforts  have\nfocused  on  loan  enforcement  reforms  alone.  Thus  efforts  have  been  made  to  expedite  debt\nrecovery in the courts through reforms like the Hypothecary Action under Mortgage Act No. 6 of\n1949 as  amended, and the  Debt Recovery Special Provisions Act No. 2 of 1990. These have\ncontinued to be dependent on the court system. As such, they cannot offer to SMEs improved\naccess  to  credit  based  on  movable  property  collateral.  This  is  because  even  in  industrial\ncountries with refined security interest regimes, a court\u2019s disposition time can be too long and\nwill  not  allow  total  collection  time  and  costs  to  come  within  a  range  that  would  allow  movable\nproperty to effectively serve as collateral for credit.  Even efforts on so-called parate execution\nremedy  for  creditors  outside  the  court  system  have  been  restricted  to  particular  financial\ninstitutions. The inability of such reforms to fuel SME development is not unexpected since such\npartial reform of the secured transactions regime actually limits access to credit by hampering\nnonbank creditors, who extend credit to SME clients in whom banks have limited or no interest.\n\n8.\n\nLimited Use of IT by SMEs\n\n45.\nIT can help SMEs by reducing the costs of doing business, improving linkages with the\nglobal  economy,  and  spreading  information  and  knowledge  to  remote  areas.  The  limited\ntelecommunications  infrastructure  is  a  major  constraint  to  growth  of  IT  applications.  The\nabsence of a level playing field for commercial users and providers of telecommunications, and\nthe virtual monopoly of voice telecommunications held by Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) compound\nthis problem and are reflected in the relatively high cost of telephone communications. The legal\nframework is yet to be firmly established and language is perceived to be a barrier to growth of\nthe sector as is the scarcity of trained human resources.\n\n46.\nAside from the onetime costs associated with computer purchase, the greatest barrier to\nthe take-up of the Internet is the recurring costs associated with Internet access. Typically, 15\nhours  of  local  call  time  to  a  provider  will  cost  $13.05  per  month.  Over  the  full  year,  call\nconnection  charges  alone  will  amount  to  $156.60,  or  20  percent  of  gross  national  product  per\ncapita. This places Internet use well beyond the reach of the average Sri Lankan. SLT\u2019s role as\nthe  only  purveyor  of  voice  communications  is  partly  responsible  for  these  high  costs.  In\nparticular,  its  monopoly  of  the  independent  gateway  prevents  the  possibility  for  reductions  in\ninternet access costs.  Without these reductions, even simple innovations such as internet cafes\nare unlikely to flourish.\n\nD.\n\n Government Objectives and Strategy\n\n47.\nThe  Government  sees  private  sector  development  as  the  main  means  of  achieving\nsustainable  economic  growth  and  reaching  its  Vision  2010  target  of  7-8  percent  growth  per\nannum.    Reforms  have  been  undertaken  related  to  private  and  SMEs  development  with  the\nassistance  of  ADB,  e.g.,  through  the  Private  Sector  Development  Program  adopted  in  2000.\nThese  reforms  have  contributed  to  financial  sector  development,  privatization,  reducing  labor\nmarket rigidities, and promoting competition. However, Sri Lanka still faces challenges related to\ndiversification  of  the  economy,  improving  competitiveness,  and  expanding  employment\n\n\f12\n\nopportunities.  The  Government  feels  that  SMEs  will  play  an  increasingly  important  role  in\nmeeting these challenges.\n\n48.\nIn  view  of  the  importance  of  SMEs  to  the  economy,  the  Government  is  embarking  on\nfurther  policy  and  institutional  reforms  to  create  a  dynamic  SME  sector.  It  is  felt  that  a  new\nstrategy is needed to contend with the emerging challenges both domestically and abroad. The\nimportance of providing a level playing field in terms of a more conducive business environment\nfree of bureaucratic impediments is recognized. In addition, over the long term the Government\nwill reform tax (and customs) administration.  A key concern is that rigidities in these institutions\npromote  evasion  and  informality  generally  while  being  especially  onerous  for  SMEs.\nFurthermore,  they  continue  to  constrain  the  free  and  efficient  flow  of  goods  and  services  and\nhence limit the gains from policy reform. This represents recognition, and reversal, of a reform\nstrategy  that  ignored  these  institutions  while  seeking  to  compensate  for  their  shortcomings  by\ncreating  parallel  regimes  for  tax  (and  customs)  maintained  by  BOI.  This  process  is  initiated\nunder  SMESDP  which  both  completes  important  reforms  of  the  tax  system  and,  through  the\nDeregulation Committee, provides a mechanism for managing further regulatory reform over the\nmedium term.\n\n49.\nIt  is  recognized  also  that  shrinking  public  sector  budgets  no  longer  permit  large-scale\nprovision  of  subsidized  assistance  to  promote  SMEs.  At  the  same  time  the  Government  is\naware  that  absence  of  full  and  efficient  markets  in  capacity  building  and  finance  for  SMEs\nremains important bottlenecks to the sector. In this context the Government\u2019s strategy stresses\nthe development of efficient markets for business services for SMEs. This will be balanced, over\nthe  longer  term,  by  the  rationalization  and  downsizing  of  IDB,  the  major  conduit  for  public\nprovision  of  BDS.  While  the  public  sector  will  play  an  important  role  in  managing  the  reform\nprocess, a greater  stress is  placed  on private sector and SME inputs in the policy formulation\nand decision-making process.\n\nIn  terms  of  access  to  finance  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  is  to  promote  greater\n50.\ncompetition,  incentives  for  capacity  building  in  banks,  combined  with  selective  provision  of\npublic guarantees for the purpose of accessing capital markets. Over the longer term, it will also\ndevelop  the  legal  framework  for  secured  transactions  to  facilitate  SME  access  to  non-bank\nfinance.  This will set the stage for the use of securitized  lending.\n\nE.\n\n External Assistance to the Sector\n\nADB, Japan, and the World Bank continue to be the largest sources of aid to Sri Lanka,\n51.\nbut significant assistance also continues to be provided by bilateral funding agencies (Appendix\n5).  Due  to  the  significant  economic  and  financial  impact  of  the  civil  conflict  and  the\nGovernment\u2019s efforts to reduce the budget deficit, aid-financed projects constitute a significant\nproportion of the overall public sector investment program.\n\n52.\nThe  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  has  a  low-interest  line  of  credit  of  $40\nmillion  in  place  for  small  and  micro-size  firms.  The  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency\n(JICA)  has  prepared  a  proposal  for  donor  financing  of  a  scheme  for  support  to  the\nmanufacturing  sector.  This  scheme  envisages  the  provision  of  coordinated  assistance  to\nstrengthen technology acquisition by firms, and support for particular clusters of firms in specific\nsubsectors (e.g. gems, rubber, plastics, etc.) JICA also proposes to provide BDS to firms initially\non a grant basis, support for an incubation scheme for the IT sector, a fund for venture capital,\nand a system of credit guarantees for use by banks. The Government is considering the JICA\nproposal.\n\n\f13\n\nBusiness  development  services  for  SMEs,  assistance  for  business  start-ups,  and\n53.\nvocational  training-sometimes  specifically  targeted  towards  women-receive  support  from  a\nnumber  of  aid  agencies  including  the  German  Government,  and  the  International  Labour\nOrganization  (ILO)  supports  vocational  training  programs  through  its  TA  window.  One  of  its\nvocational  training  programs  focuses  on  rural  women.  The  Sri  Lanka\u2013German  Enterprise\nInformation  Project  has  established  a  regional  network  for  providing  ICT  services.  These  are\nlocated in already existing business development centers, and there is close collaboration with\nregional chambers of commerce and industry.\n\n54.\nRelatedly,  assistance  from  the  United  States  of  America  has  focused  on  policy  and\nregulatory reforms in financial markets and trade and investment systems. A recent initiative by\nthe  United  States  of  America  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  is  focusing  on\nimproving  competitiveness  in  identified  subsectors  with  a  view  to  improving  the  vertical  and\nhorizontal \nfocuses  on\nmicroeconomic  reforms  aimed  at  promoting  the  \u201ccompetitiveness  diamond\u201d  as  propounded  by\nthe Harvard Business School. Close consultations with the above major external aid agencies\nwere conducted during program preparation and the proposed program has strong support from\nall  those  agencies.    Industrial  \u201cincubators\u201d  and  an  exchange  for  subcontracting  by  SMEs  is\nbeing promoted by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.\n\nthese  subsectors.  This \n\nlinkages  between \n\nfirms  within \n\ninitiative \n\nF.\n\nADB\u2019s Strategy and Operations in the Sector\n\n55.\nADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  reiterates  and  highlights  private  sector\ndevelopment  as  one  of  the  key  areas  for  ADB  support  through  the  promotion  of  policy  and\ninstitutional  reforms  to  help  Sri  Lanka  reduce  poverty  and  achieve  sustainable  growth.  Private\nsector  development,  especially  SME  development,  will  play  a  direct  role  in  supporting  poverty\nreduction by creating of productive employment for the poor.\n\nEarlier  ADB  efforts  in  supporting  SME  development  focused  on  provision  of  low-cost\n56.\ncredit  to  finance  private  sector  investment,  combined  with  building  the  capacity  of  DFIs.  The\nstress  on  loan  disbursements  led  to  choosing  as  many  financial  institutions  as  possible  for\nonlending, including the highly inefficient public sector banks and NGOs, at the cost of building\nsustainability. Capacity building was most successful within the DFIs. Gains were recorded with\nprivate  banks  but  substantial  scope  remains  for  improvement.  The  projects  have  usually\nanticipated very large gains in terms of initial employment expansion without taking into account\nthe very high mortality rates among SMEs. However, unlike DFI lending elsewhere, in Sri Lanka\nboth ADB and World Bank loans are generally regarded as having contributed positively to the\neconomy  by  providing  access  to  finance  at  a  time  of  critical  shortages.  In  a  sharp  departure\nfrom worldwide experience with DFI lending, the most recent projects have been well managed,\nwith very high rates of loan repayment.\n\n57.\nADB  has  also  provided  two  PCGs  to  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise\nAssistance  Project  (SMAP)6  and  the  Credit  Enhancement  Facility  for  Private  Enterprises.7\nThese  initiatives  were  meant  to  help  the  country  gain  access  to  the  international  financial\nmarkets and catalyze private capital inflows during difficult market conditions to support private\nsector  development  and  assist  in  reducing  poverty  in  the  rural  and  semirural  areas  of  the\ncountry.\n                                                          \n6 Loan 1522-SRI: Second Small and Medium Enterprise Assistance Project, for $5 million, approved on June 1997.\n7 Loan 1629-SRI: Credit Enhancement Facility for Private Enterprises, for $5 million, approved on September 1998.\n\n\fStrategic Framework for SME Support\n2001-2007\n\nSMESDP\n\nMid-term\n\nLong-term\n\nImproved Public Sector\nGovernance\n\nAutonomous tax\nadministration\n\nSimplified tax system\n\nCustoms reform\n\nIDB downsized and\nrestructured\n\nLegal and Financial\nFramework for non-bank\nfinance\n\nImplementation of\nframework for secured\ntransactions\n\nSecuritized lending for\nSMEs\n\nStrengthened legal\nframework for\nfinancial sector\nd\n\n1\n4\n\nStrengthening Markets and\nCapacities\n\nPublic Sector\n\nStrategic oversight: SME Task Force\nPolicy Attention: SME Policy Unit\nRegulatory Reform: Deregulation\nCommittee\n\n-\n-\n-\n\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nBanks\n\nCredit\nInvestments in HRD\nInvestments in ICT\nLending methods for SMEs\nCorporate Governance\n\nStimulation of BDS for\n\nSMEs\n\nInitiation of secured\ntransactions legal reform\n\nagenda\n\nSelected provision of\npartial credit guarantee to\nbanks\n\nDeregulation Committee\n\nRegulatory Simplification through\nannual Deregulation White Paper\n\nCommittee for Legal Reform of\nFinancial Sector\n\nAgenda for secured transactions\nLevel playing field for banks/ DFIs\nSimplified legal framework\n\n(cid:1)\n\n(cid:1)\n(cid:1)\n(cid:1)\n\nBDS = business development services; DFI = development finance institution; HRD = Human Resource Development; ICT = information and communication technology;\nIDB = Industrial Development Board ; SME = Small and Medium Enterprise.\n\n\f15\n\nADB,  in  coordination  with  other  external  agencies  (e.g.,  IMF  and  World  Bank),  is\n58.\nfocusing  its  operations  on  a  combination  of  macroeconomic  and  financial  sector  reforms  to\nreduce  the  crowding  out  of  the  private  sector.  Through  the  Private  Sector  Development\nProgram,8  ADB  is  supporting  (i)  financial  sector  development  by  eliminating  distortions  in  the\nmarket arising from regulatory barriers and special privileges accorded to state-owned financial\ninstitutions; (ii) further privatization and restructuring of state-owned enterprises; (iii) addressing\nlabor market rigidities to accelerate private sector investments and raise industrial productivity,\nand mitigating the social impact of such reforms; and (iv) promoting competition, and entry and\nexit,    and  sector  policies  that  improve  the  efficiency  of  resource  allocation.  In  the  short  to\nmedium term, ADB will continue its assistance to facilitate financial sector development by  (i)\npromoting  good  governance  over  the  financial  markets  by  improving  the  understanding  of  key\ngovernance  principles  and  best  practices,  building  capacity  for  good  governance,  and\ninstitutionalizing  of  good  governance  principles  through  organizational  restructuring;  and  (ii)\nmobilizing financial resources from commercial sources with support of ADB\u2019s guarantee facility\nfor relending to the private sector through domestic financial institutions. The proposed Project\nis fully in line with ADB\u2019s operations and sector strategy in Sri Lanka.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n59.\nIf Sri Lanka is to achieve its growth rate of 7-8 percent per annum in Vision 2010, it must\ndiversify its economy and improve its competitiveness. To do so will require renewed reforms to\nsimplify  the  regulatory  and  incentive  structure.  A  key  focus  will  be  strengthening  the\nperformance  of  the  SME  sector  to  enable  it  to  better  respond  to  the  challenges  of  an\nincreasingly  globalized  economy.  This  will  serve \nimprove  competitiveness,  expand\nemployment, and promote diversification at a critical juncture in the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nto \n\n60.\nThe  importance  of  diversification  is  underscored  by  the  economy\u2019s  reliance  on  a  few\nsectors  for  its  exports\u2014principally  garment  and  jewelry\u2014and  by  its  increasing  integration  into\nand exposure to global markets. The need to support SMEs is made more urgent by the decline\nin the contribution of formal sector SMEs to output and employment. This is a matter of policy\nconcern as dynamic economies are not sustainably led by the expansion of large firms alone.\nSustainable,  equitable  growth  requires  an  incentive  and  regulatory  structure  that  provides  a\nlevel playing field that enables SMEs to grow into larger businesses.\n\nImproving \n\nTo  play  the  role  envisaged  for  them,  SMEs  will  have  to  overcome  a  wide  array  of\n61.\nconstraints. \nthrough  regulatory  simplification  and\nstrengthening public governance is essential to address external constraints. This will be greatly\nassisted  by  the  presence  of  institutions  that  promote  improved  dialogue  within  the  private\nsector, and improved relations between the private sector and the government.\n\nthe  business  environment \n\n62.\nLack of management and other skills, and limited access to information and technology\nare  critical  impediments  at  the  level  of  the  individual  SME.  Capacity  building  through  the\ndevelopment  of  a  vibrant  market  for  business  services  that  can  provide  a  diversified  range  of\nconsulting and other services to SMEs is essential to address this impediment, as are efforts to\nstimulate  awareness  of  the  value  of  these  services.  By  strengthening  SME  capabilities,  BDS\n\n                                                          \n8  Loan 1800(SF)-SRI: Private Sector Development Program, for $85 million, approved on 12 December 2000,` and\n\nLoan 1801-SRI: Private Sector Development Program, for $15 million, approved on 12 December 2000.\n\n\f16\n\nalso  serves  to  make  SMEs  better  business  risks  for  banks  and  thus  improves  their  access  to\nfinance.\n\n63.\nAccess to finance on commercial terms is vital to catalyze investments by SMEs. DFIs\nalone cannot serve the market adequately, while commercial banks continue to have problems\nin raising term funds for this purpose.  Greater competition among banks and DFIs, and wider\nuse of instruments needed to gain access to capital markets, will improve financing for SMEs.\nThe considerable investment of banks in IT is helping them to better manage the risks of lending\nto the SME market, a process that will be strengthened by building capacity in the appropriate\ncredit evaluation and counseling skills.  Parallel efforts are needed to promote non-bank finance\nthough the development of the appropriate legal framework for secured transactions.\n\nUse of  IT can help SMEs gain better access to information, markets, business partners\n64.\nand skills and learning opportunities. Experience elsewhere has shown that increased use of IT\ncan  result  in  SMEs  being  better  able  to  develop  new  markets  and  compete  effectively  in  both\ndomestic and international environments.  Finding and motivating the right kind of private sector\npartners to develop low cost and sustainable solutions for SMEs is a key ingredient of success\nin this sector.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n65.\nThe  goal  is  to  facilitate  a  more  competitive  and  diversified  economy  that  relies  on  a\ndynamic  business  sector  that  can  respond  freely  to  market  signals.  This  is  to  be  achieved\nthrough  reforms  that  will  reduce  regulatory  impediments,  lower  transaction  costs,  improve\naccess to credit, and enhance capacities in private sector firms and financial institutions.\n\n66.\nThe  objectives  are  to  create  a  dynamic  SME  sector,  enhance  its  capabilities  and\ncompetitiveness,  create  jobs  and,  in  doing  so,  reduce  poverty.  The  objectives  are  to  be\nthe  enabling  business\nachieved \nenvironment for SMEs, (ii) catalyzes investment by improving SMEs access to finance through\ncommercial channels, and (iii) enhances the capacity of the Sri Lankan BDS sector to efficiently\nand effectively deliver services to SMEs.\n\nthat  (i)  strengthens \n\nintegrated  approach \n\nthrough  an \n\nThese activities will lead to the expansion of existing SMEs, aid the transition of informal\n\n67.\nSMEs into the formal economy, and encourage the establishment of new SMEs.\n\nThe program comprises (i) program of policy reform to improve the policy and enabling\n68.\nenvironment; (ii) a project to strengthen SME capacities through the development of the market\nfor  the  provision  of  BDS;  (iii)  lines  of  credit  to  CBC,  Sampath  Bank,  DFCC,  NDB,  and  HNB,\nlinked  to  their  strengthened  capacity  to  provide  credit  to  SMEs  on  a  sustainable  basis  on\ncommercial  terms;  and  (iv)  ADB\u2019s  PCG  of  commercial  cofinancing  for  each  participating  bank\nfor its term lending to SMEs.\n\n69.\n\nThe project will be supported by three key initiatives:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nArticulation of a vision or strategy for SME development while setting in place a\ndurable  mechanism  to  support  the  policy/regulatory  environment  through  the\ncompletion of a SME policy white paper by a SME task force.\n\nEstablishment  of  an  SME  policy  unit    to  address  future  SME-related  policy  and\nregulatory issues\n\n\f17\n\n(iii) \n\nAn  institutional  response\u2014the  Deregulation  Committee\u2014for  identifying  and\nimplementing  a  set  of  phased  policy  and  institutional  reforms  to  strengthen  the\nenabling  environment,  reduce  the  transacting  costs  of  business,  simplify  the\nregulatory  framework,  and  remove  policy  and  institutional  biases.    While  these\nefforts will benefit all firms, international experience shows that they will have a\nproportionately greater positive impact on SMEs.\n\nC.\n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\n70.\nThe key time-bound policies and actions are described in the development policy letter\n(Appendix 1) and the policy matrix  (Appendix 2). The detailed reforms and project components\nare described in the following paras.\n\n1. \n\nA Strategy for SME Development\n\nThe  Program  will  support  a  shift  to  a  greater  focus  on  the  policy  environment  for  SME\n71.\ndevelopment. Primarily due to budget constraints, but also because of the nature of BDS, direct\ndelivery of BDS by the public sector will reach only a small percentage of the SME population.\nThe public sector\u2019s efforts will therefore concentrate on getting the enabling environment right,\nto widen its impact on the SME sector without excessive costs. However, a key impediment to a\ncoherent  and  clear  strategy  for  SME  development  is  the  lack  of  a  public-private  process  and\ndialogue  to  identify  and  address  issues  and  constraints  as  they  arise.  The  Program  will\ntherefore encourage the use of public-private dialogue, in addition to promoting the use of such\na mechanism at the core of the policy component.\n\n72.\nRecent developments have underscored the importance of greater coordination in SME\npolicies.    The  establishment  of  incubators  and  sub-contracting  exchange  schemes  under  the\nauspices of MTI, and the ministry\u2019s absorption of the focus on rural and micro- and small scale\nindustries provided by the now-defunct Ministry of Rural and Industrial Development are some\nof  these  developments.  Others  include  the  recognition  of  the  need  to  capitalize  on  assistance\nbeing  provided  by  USAID  to  strengthen  competitiveness  in  industrial  SME  clusters,  and  to\nrationalize and restructure the IDB over the medium-to-long term. These developments have led\nto  the  consensus  for  action  to  develop  a  coherent  policy  direction  for  the  government  that\naddresses issues of stakeholder concern, is bipartisan and fiscally sustainable.\n\nThe  priority  is  to  establish  an  effective  framework  for  immediate  stock  taking  and  a\n73.\nmechanism  for  providing  ongoing  SME  monitoring  and  long-term  policy  and  regulatory\nmanagement.  This  is  to  be  initiated  through  a  SME  white  paper  to  be  prepared  by  the  Task\nForce  on  SME  development.  The  white  paper  will  set  out  for  the  SME  sector  a  vision  and\nstrategy  over  the  medium  term  based  on  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  experience  and  international  best\npractices.  It  will  identify  policy  and  institutional  reforms  needed  to  realize  the  vision,  and\nestablish  a  clear  and  specific  plan  of  action\u2014identifying  responsible  parties,  milestones,  and\nbenchmarks.\n\n74.\nThe  Task  Force  was  established  in  October  2001  and  consists  of  15  leading  policy\nanalysts,  academics,  business  figures,  representatives  of  SME  institutions,  chambers  of\ncommerce,  Deregulation  Committee,  and  the  banking  industry.    Working  Groups  and  TORs\nhave been established and the Task Force expects to hold public hearings in Colombo, Kandy\nand Matara over the next 6 months in developing the draft white paper.\n\n\f75.\n\nThe Task Force\u2019s responsibilities follow:\n\n18\n\n(i) \n\npublicize its activities to build awareness and encourage participation;\n\n(ii)  analyze the contribution of SMEs to the Sri Lanka economy;\n\n(iii) \n\nlist the objectives and fundamental principles that underpin the national strategy;\n\n(iv)  articulate the elements necessary for achieving a national vision/strategy;\n\n(v)  outline the institutional reforms necessary to achieve the national strategy for SME\n\n(vi)  during the life of the task force, acting as a sounding board to resolve SME policy\n\ndevelopment;\n\nissues; and\n\n(vii)  publicize an action plan that identifies short and long term goals.\n\n2. \n\nSME Policy Unit\n\nGovernment  policy  formulation  and  institutional  reform  for  SMEs  will  focus  on  lessons\n76.\nlearned  from  international  and  local  experience.  A  wealth  of  existing  knowledge  relates  to\ncreating  an  enabling  environment  and  there  is  general  agreement  among  stakeholders  in  the\nSME  sector  as  to  what  constitutes  a  good  enabling  environment.  Such  lessons  need  to  be\ntempered  and  modified  to  relate  to  the  specifics  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  economy.  Furthermore,  such\nlessons  can  only  be  implemented  through  an  ongoing  consultative  process  that  includes  all\nstakeholders and is based on the availability of appropriate information.\n\nThe  policy  unit  will  be  formed  in  the  MTI;  it  will  consist  of  a  small  group  tasked  with\n77.\ncoordinating and managing the preparation of policy analysis. The unit will respond to the needs\nof the SME task force and the MTI in preparing its outputs. It will be supported by a TA grant to\nset  up  its  operations  (equipment  and  furnishings).  One  of  its  most  important  activities,\nconducting the baseline survey, will be financed from a mix of grant and project loan assistance.\nThe Unit will have a lean staff and will outsource portions of its work, in the process contributing\nto the development of BDS providers.\n\n78.\n\nThe tasks of the SME policy unit will be to:\n\n(i) \n\nstay abreast of best practices;\n\n(ii)  provide analytical underpinning to proposed SME policy and regulatory changes;\n\n(iii)  advise on the size bias of proposed policies or regulations;\n\n(iv)  monitor  the  state  of  SME  growth  and,  by  extension,  the  effectiveness  of  BDS\n\n(v)  draw lessons from past actions and apply such lessons going forward;\n\n(vi)  provide  a  forum  for  an  ongoing  dialogue  between  the  Government  and  SME\n\nproviders;\n\nsector, and\n\n\f19\n\n(vii)  carry out a base line survey on the sector annually.\n\n3. \n\n The Deregulation Committee\n\nTo support its objective of improving the investor climate for both foreign and domestic\n79.\ninvestment, through the removal of roadblocks to investment, the Government has established\na Deregulation Committee reporting to MTI. The Committee is primarily composed of the private\nsector. It will undertake studies and hold hearings to evaluate impediments posed for business\nby  procedural,  regulatory,  policy,  and  institutional  and  other  constraints.  As  conditions  for  the\nrelease  of  the  first  tranche,  the  committee  produced  reports  on  the  framework  for  evaluating\ntransaction costs and the burden imposed on businesses  by the regulatory framework, and a\nclear framework and analysis of the regulatory impediments created by the tax administration.\nThese  studies,  combined  with  the  committee\u2019s  mission  statement  and  terms  of  reference,  are\nimportant components of the analytical toolkit to be used over the program period to prepare a\nseries of deregulation studies, which will be published in an annual deregulation white paper. To\npromote transparency of the process, the Government will annually announce  the Committee\u2019s\nrecommendations that have been implemented, and give reasons for not implementing others.\n\n80.\nOver the mediumterm, the committee will undertake activities to (i) develop investor road\nmaps  of  impediments  to  investments  in  particular  sectors,  (ii)  develop  general  criteria  and\nguidelines  for  evaluating  the  costs  and  benefits  of  regulations,  and  (iii)  institute  reviews  of\nregulations  for  specific  sectors  based  on  the  criteria  and  methodology  developed.  The\ncommittee will be supported by TA granted under the Project (Appendix 6).\n\n4. \n\nRationalizing the Incentive Framework\n\n81.\nReflecting ongoing policy dialogue conducted jointly with ADB and IMF, the Government\nis  preparing  a  strategy  paper  for  medium-  and  long-term  reforms  covering  all  aspects  of  tax\npolicy and tax administration including (i) phasing out of turnover taxes and their replacement by\nGST,  (ii)  phasing  out  of  exemptions  from  GST,  (iii)  unifying  surcharges  and  stamp  duties  on\nimports with the import duty, (iv) reducing the corporate tax, and (v) rationalizing  tax incentives\nfor investment. These reforms are to be implemented in a manner that seeks to achieve long-\nterm revenue neutrality but will require short-term assistance to meet adjustment costs.\n\n82.\nUnder  the  SMESDP,  the  key  objectives  will  be  to  (i)  begin  with  the  process  of\nrationalizing  and  subsequently  eliminating  archaic  and  inefficient  taxes  that  raise  transactions\ncosts  for  business\u2014principally  through  stamp  duties  and  the  turnover  tax  on  the  banking\nsystem, (ii) reduce the bias for investments by large firms by moving toward a lower single flat\nrate  of  corporate  tax,  and  (iii)  achieve  greater  transparency  in  the  incentive  structure\u2014and\nimproved allocation of resources. The following actions will be completed prior to the release of\nthe first tranche:\n\n(i) \n\nelimination of the turnover tax on banking, and  reduction by 1 percentage point of\nthe National Security Levy,\n\n(ii) \n\n reduction of the stamp duty on imports, from 2 percent to 1 percent, and\n\n(iii)  elimination of the Save- the- Nation Contribution.\n\n83.\nFor  release  of  the  second  tranche,  a  tax  reform  strategy  with  specific  targets  over  the\nmediumterm  will  be  announced  by  March  2002.  The  strategy  will  include  eliminating  of  stamp\n\n\f20\n\nduties on imports, and harmonizing of tax incentives in the Inland Revenue Act. In addition, the\ncorporate  tax  rate  will  be  reduced  from  its  current  level  of  35  percent,  to  an  amount  to  be\ndetermined in the light of revenue expectations and as agreed upon with ADB and IMF.\n\nThe  preceding  measures  provide  the  essential  preparation  for  deep-seated  reforms  to\n84.\nmodernize the tax system and, subsequently, customs. They are necessary to ensure that the\ngains from policy reforms are not undermined by institutional rigidities and impediments to the\nfree  flow  of  goods,  services,  and  investments.  A  key  focus  of  the  Government\u2019s  future  reform\nagenda, therefore, is a comprehensive reform of the tax system involving major improvements\nto  governance  and  autonomy.  These  efforts  complement  the  deregulation  targets  under  the\nSMESDP.  Consequently,  ADB  and  IMF  are  expected  to  jointly  maintain  a  policy  dialogue  for\nfurther development of the tax policy agenda. In addition to simplifying of the tax system, these\nefforts  are  expected  to  lead  to  the  phased  development  of  a  modern,  integrated,  and\nautonomous  authority  for  inland  revenue  and  customs.  That  is  to  be  achieved  through  (i)\nmeasures to strengthen administrative procedures; (ii) improvement of the legal framework; (iii)\nstrengthening of organization, personnel policies, and management practices; (iv) strengthening\nof skills through training; (v) phasing in of an IT system to support the new integrated authority;\nand (vi) provision of a voluntary retirement scheme.\n\n5.\n\nRestructuring the Industrial Development Board\n\n85.\nIDB is in the process of changing its strategy from a service provider to facilitator of BDS\nand a one-stop shop for information for SMEs. Over the medium term, IDB expects to acquire\nan increased budget responsibility so that it could becoming less dependent on the government\nbudget,  increase  the  participation  of  the  private  sector  on  its  board,  and  identify  those  of  its\nassets and divisions that are central to its core strategy. In this connection, IDB will also identify\na number of functions and services it intends to offer its clientele in the future, consistent with its\nnew  vision.  IDB  is  expected  to  enter  into  a  performance  contract  with  the  MTI  that  includes\nincentive and penalty clauses related to its performance.\n\n86.\nIDB is expected to withdraw from competing in sectors where private sector agents can\nbetter provide  services. These include but will not be limited to (i) purchase and distribution of\nraw  materials,  (ii)  introduction  of  new  designs  and  new  technology,  (iii)  quality  control,  (iv)\ntraining  of  workers,  and  (v)  marketing  and  sales  promotion.  It  is  expected  that  IDB\u2019s  eventual\nrestructuring would be timed with a follow-up project for further deregulation and support to the\nSME sector sometime in 2004.\n\n6.\n\nImproving Access to IT\n\n87.\nThe  Government  is  developing  an  integrated  strategy  to  address  the  numerous\nconstraints to wider use of the Internet by SMEs including the cost of computers, low density of\nphone lines, and the cost of tariffs and limited competition in the telecoms and related sectors. A\ntask force has been established to address the chief constraints. Progress is being made on a\nnumber of fronts, including development of the enabling environment. The computer crimes act,\nthe  e-transactions  act,  and  the  data  protection  act  are  important  pieces  of  legislation  being\ndrafted  under  this  effort.  Under  the  SMESDP,  a  Cabinet  sub-committee  was    formed  in\nSeptember  2001,  chaired  by  the  Minister  of  Posts  and  Telecommunications,  to  develop  an\naction  plan  to  introduce  greater  competition  in  the  provision  of  telephony  services.    In  this\nconnection, prior to release of the second tranche,   the  Government will  issue one or more\nlicenses  to eliminate SLTs monopoly of the independent gateway.\n\n\f21\n\nAs the near-term teledensity within Sri Lanka is low, there will be a continuing restraint\n88.\non  utilizing  the  Internet  for  economic  development  through  such  tools  as  e-commerce,  e-\nbusiness, e-government, e-learning, etc.9 In the development of any e-commerce initiatives, the\nfocus  will  need  to  be  on  broad-based  external  access  and  use  of  the  Internet  rather  than\ninternal, in-country access. The rest of the world will be accessing Sri Lankan information and\npurchasing  Sri  Lankan  goods  and  services  via  the  Internet  long  before  Sri  Lankans  are  doing\nthis directly themselves. Any e-commerce solution must therefore look outward and be aimed at\nexport-oriented SMEs. There is also a need to assist (i) SMEs and policy makers in availing of\nIT  to  improve  access  to  information  services  and  (ii)  assist  SMEs  and  SME  clusters  in\nstrengthening linkages to the wider economy.\n\nThe  Project  will  provide  TA  support  in  the  form  of  seed  capital  for  promising  options\n\n89.\nincluding the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nimproving  SME  access  to  global  markets  by  modifying  an  existing  portal  in\ncollaboration with existing institutions in Sri Lanka and internationally\u2014a number\nof  such  portals  exist,  and  assistance  will  be  provided  to  establish  a  partnership\nbetween a local and an international provider. The objective is to ensure that the\nresulting  portal  has  a  commercial  focus,  is  able  to  present  SME  storefronts  to\nboth  consumers  and  businesses,  and  provides  the  means  to  complete\ntransactions;\n\n extending the reach of effective business development and business information\nservices  nationally  through  the  use  of  web-based  solutions.  In  this  connection,\nthe project will seek to establish synergy between a leading provider of business\ninformation  services  with  a  NGO  (Sarvodyha)  that  is  establishing  a  network  of\ntelecenters,  with  a  view  to  achieving    union  between  outreach  and  financial\nsustainability;\n\n(iii) \n\ncreating a more transparent business environment through support for MTI  and\nthe  SME  Policy  Unit  to  assist  SMEs  meet  simplified  regulatory  requirements,\nestablish information directories, etc. (Appendix 6).\n\n7. \n\nImproving Access to Finance\n\na. \n\nEqual Opportunities In the Banking Sector\n\n90. With declining access to low-cost loans from multilateral sources, it will be essential for\nthe  DFIs  to  raise  resources  from  other  sources  if  they  are  to  compete  with  other  banks.  To\nprovide a level playing field, the Government will review the Banking Act and Monetary Law with\na  view  to  effecting  amendments  that  remove  impediments  to  the  DFIs  in  offering  current\naccounts or establishing foreign currency units currently permitted to the private banks. Parallel\nto this,  the Government will take steps to bring the private commercial banks into the fold of its\npublic  guarantees,  which  is  essential  to  gaining  access  to  international  capital  markets,  for\nexample. In this connection, it is expected that careful consideration will be given to basing the\nprovision of a public guarantee on carefully circumscribed public interest grounds to reduce the\nlikelihood of a moral hazard. Such guarantees will always be partial; for un-guaranteed portions\nof loans best practice \u2013 as in the Small Business Administration of the United States of America\n\n                                                          \n9 This  is  being  addressed  in  part  by  aid  agency  and  Government  efforts  to  support  multipurpose  telecenters  and\n\ncommunity telecenters.\n\n\f22\n\n\u2013  involves  fostering  securitization.  Such  securitization  is  ultimately  dependent  on  a  modern\nsecured transactions regime available in the United States, but not in Sri Lanka.\n\nb.\n\nAccess to Secured Credit by SMEs\n\n91.\nSMESDP  will  seek  to  ensure  that  a  more  cost  efficient  and  diversified  secured  credit\nsupply  is  available  to  SMEs  so  that  competitive  pressures  are  brought  to  bear  on  DFIs  and\ncommercial  banks  extending  credit  to  SMEs.  SMESDP  will  support  a  reform  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s\ntransactions  regime,  encompassing  creation,  registration,  and  creditor-initiated\nsecured \nenforcement of security interests in movable property. Such a legal framework will enable SME\ndebtors to effectively use movable property as collateral for credit. The legal framework will also\ngive  appropriate  consideration  to  important  policy  questions  such  as  exceptions  for  certain\ndebtor property that represents basic livelihood (like workmen\u2019s tools), consumer protection, and\nappropriate  debtor  protection  on  the  sale  and  repossession  of  debtor  assets  under  creditor\nadministered enforcement. A detailed reform agenda will be developed with assistance from TA.\nThe implementation of this agenda is expected to take place with possible further ADB support\nin a subsequent project in 2004.\n\n92.\nLegal reforms under SMESDP will be guided by a working group or committee for Legal\nReform  of  the  Financial  Sector  established  in  November  2001,  under  the  chairmanship  of  the\nChief Justice. The working group will also initiate a fundamental review with a view to identifying\nkey  legal  reforms  and  amendments  required  to  support  a  modern  financial  sector  and  open\neconomy.    Members  of  the  working  group  include  representatives  from  the  Legal  Draftsman\u2019s\nDepartment,  MOFP,  BOI,  Attorney-General\u2019s  Office,  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,\nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka, the private sector, and the Public Enterprise Reform Commission.\n\nc.\n\nOther Measures\n\nA key objective in responding to the need for medium- and long-term funds for onlending\n93.\nis  the  development  of  a  strong,  liquid,  and  fully  transparent  debt  instrument  market.  The\nGovernment intends to pursue this objective in the medium term by issuing long-term treasury\nbonds  to  provide  market  indicators,  by  continuing  to  stimulate  the  secondary  market,  and  by\nprotecting  the  public  interest  through  sound  monitoring  and  regulation  of  financial  institutions.\nThe Government is also taking measures to reduce its large fiscal deficit resulting primarily from\nthe high world prices of oil and security-related expenditures, in line with the agreements under\na standby arrangement with the IMF. A reduction in the demand for credit by the Government\nand  reduced  crowding  out  of  the  private  sector  are  expected  to  result  and  will  have  major\nimpacts on improving funding for private sector activity.\n\nD.        Capacity Building\n\n94.\nThe principal need for capacity building is in respect of  the consulting firms and financial\ninstitutions  that  support  SMEs.  Experience  has  shown  that  the  greatest  benefits  are  derived\nfrom  a  wholesale  approach  to  capacity  building  rather  than  from  a  direct  provision  of  training\nand technical assistance.  This is reflected in the design of SMESDP, which is explicitly targeted\nat strengthening the BDS sector through measures that include improving access to global best\npractice and development of curriculum for appropriate training and capacity building programs\n(e.g.  for  technology  institutes,  training  of  bank  staff  in  SME  lending  techniques,  etc.).    An\ninvestment loan is provided for this purpose.\n\n\f23\n\nHowever,  so  long  as  low  income  levels  and  poor  enabling  environments  continue  to\n95.\nconstrain SME capacities,  direct interventions in capacity building in SMEs will also be needed\nin mitigation. For this reason, to complement the wholesale approach, (i) a voucher scheme will\nbe  supported  to  assist  SMEs  to  access  low-cost  capacity  building  services  and  (ii)  TA  grant\nassistance  will  promote  the  use  of  new  technologies  such  as  IT  to  assist  SMEs  access\ninformation, markets, technology and learning opportunities.\n\n96.\nSignificant  capacity  building  assistance  is  needed  by  the  Government  in  terms  of    (i)\ndeveloping  a  medium  term  strategic  overview  for  the  SME  sector  (ii)  providing  short-term\nmonitoring  and  policy  making  assessments,  and  (iii)  for  medium-term  policy  and  regulatory\nmanagement through the Deregulation Committee.  Assistance for this purpose will be provided\nthrough TA.\n\nE.\n\nThe Project Components\n\n1.\n\nThe Business Services Support Facility\n\n97.\nReflecting  discussions  in  paras.  27-30,  the  SME  project  will  establish  a  Business\nServices  Support  Facility  (BSSF),  which  will  seek  to  uplift  skills  and  broker  services  between\nproviders and SMEs. A key objective will be to help service providers offer diversified consulting\nand training services to SMEs. A related objective  will be to improve recognition that lending to\nSMEs,  though  risky,  is  commercially  viable  if  done  well,  with  the  right  products  and  lending\nmodalities.\n\n  Activities  will  include  uplifting  local  BDS  capacity;  strengthening  local  facilitative\n98.\norganizations,  e.g.,  associations  and  chambers  of  commerce;  promoting  the  creation  of  new\nBDS products; enhancing the use of IT to promote growth; training of trainers, etc. Rather than\nproviding  services  directly  to  SMEs,  the  BSSF  will  facilitate  the  BDS  that  the  SME  market  is\nseeking by enhancing the capacity of the BDS providers to respond and by building awareness\nof the availability of BDS providers among natural facilitators (e.g., associations) and the SME\nmarket.\n\nThe BSSF life span will be limited to that of the Program. The facility will (i) coordinate\n99.\nnetworking among the BDS market, both supply- and demand-side; (ii) build awareness of BDS\nto  stimulate  its  use;  and  (iii)  build  the  capacity  of  BDS  providers  and  SME  groups  (e.g.,\nassociations). This will be done through subcontracts with service providers in targeted markets.\n\n100.\nTo help carry out its functions, the BSSF will have a fund of $2.4 million available on a\ncompetitive and cofinancing basis to BDS providers and facilitators. Among other purposes, the\nfund  will  be  used  to  finance  a  voucher  scheme  for  SMEs  to  build  their  interest  in  BDS  and  a\nmatching  grants  scheme  for  BDS  providers.  The  fund  will  be  open  to  contribution  from  other\nfunding  agencies  and will be used to stimulate the market. The Management of the BSSF will\nalso use the fund to draw out BDS providers and facilitators that target (i) capacity building in\ncommercial  banks  under  the  Project  seeking  to  lend  to  the  SME  sector  and    (ii)  develop  IT\ntraining  for  SMEs  through  appropriate  training  institutes.    Appendix  7  gives  the  terms  of\nreference  and  cost  estimates.  The  facility  staff  will  be  limited  to  three  professionals  (two  Sri\nLankans and an expatriate with BDS experience), and an office manager.\n\n\f24\n\n2. \n\nThe  Credit Assistance\n\n101.\nIn  the  highly  competitive  banking  system,  a  number  of  commercial  banks  are\nincreasingly  willing  to  invest  in  the  human  resources  and  technology  required  to  lend\nsuccessfully  to  the  SME  sector.  These  banks  are  unwilling  to  incur  the  additional  costs  and\nconflict of interest posed by the use of an apex mechanism involving another commercial bank.\nThe  lines  of  credit  will  therefore  be  coursed  through  individual  banks  and  will  be  available  for\nstart-up, long-term,  and medium-term financing needs of SMEs. The loans will be available to a\nbroad range of sectors.\n\n102. PCIs  will  be  drawn  from  commercial  banks  and  DFIs  demonstrating  an  upfront\ncommitment and capacity to effectively serve the SME market. PCIs must meet operational and\nfinancial  eligibility  requirements,  including  adherence  to  high  corporate  governance  standards,\nto  access  funds.  They  must  also  have  in  place  integrated  computer  and  IT  systems  for\nmanagement,  treasury  and  operations  functions,  knowledge  of  or  commitment  to  acquiring\nappropriate  lending  technologies,  and    adoption  of  loan  classification  structures  and  other\npractices that allow adequate monitoring of loans made. At the minimum, PCIs will need to have\nGlobus-style IT systems and a loan classification system that allows monitoring of loans by size\nand purpose (details are provided in paras 132 - 133).\n\nIn  line  with  these  requirements,  PCIs  have  invested  heavily  in  technology.  They  have\n103.\nintroduced, or are in the process of introducing, integrated bankwide computer systems. These\nsystems  provide  full  and  flexible  loan  and  deposit  management  facilities,  and  accounting  and\ntreasury functions. By September 2001, CBC, HNB, and Sampath Bank will all have in place the\nsystems needed to track and manage large numbers of SME loans. In terms of loan tracking,\nthe  only  element  missing  is  a  clear  definition  of  loan  purpose.  Government  banks  trail  the\ncommercial sector in introducing of computer systems, but are catching up.  NDB is introducing\nthe  Globus  banking  system  and  the  system  will  be  fully  implemented  by  March  2002.  DFCC\nplans  to  introduce  a  new  computer  system,  but  these  plans  have  been  delayed  due  to  the\nmerger  with  CBC  in  October  2001.  Once  the  merger  is  complete,  CBC  will  roll  out  its  own\ncomputer system to DFCC\u2019s eight branches.\n\n104. SMESDP will also assist PCIs gain greater recognition that their ICT systems can help\nthem to better monitor their SME clients\u2019 business and, as a result, position them to offer SMEs\na  range  of  services  from  web-based  presentation  of  storefronts,  assistance  in  strengthening\naccounts, payroll, etc. to closing commercial transactions with buyers of the goods and services\nthat the SMEs produce.  These activities will improve PCIs understanding of SME risks.\n\n105.\nIn terms of electronic (e)-readiness, by the end of 2001, the banking system of Sri Lanka\nwill  have  the  infrastructure  in  place  to  effectively  support  local  and  foreign  e-commerce\ntransactions.  CBC  was  the  first  bank  in  Sri  Lanka  to  offer  on-line  services  to  corporate\ncustomers  in  1997  and  has  now  expanded  this  facility  to  provide  access  via  the  Internet  to\ncustomers in all its 82 branches. HNB is planning to establish an Internet Mall by August 2002\nthat  will  allow  SMEs  to  advertise  their  products  and  services  and  collect  payment  over  the\nInternet. HNB is thus mirroring the approach taken by Plantersbank E*Com in the Philippines.\nHNB also plans to establish electronic banking centers for villages, located on the premises of\ngeneral  stores,  and  be  linked  to  the  branch  network  by  means  of  microwave  or  satellite  links.\nThe remaining element to this package is systematic use of credit scoring techniques. NDB has\ndeveloped  an  inhouse  system  which  it  uses  on  a  limited  basis.  However,  each  of  the  PCIs,\nincluding NDB, is moving in this direction \u2013 something which their IT systems are well geared to\nsupport.\n\n\f25\n\nIf needed, TA to PCIs \u2013 or assistance to establish links with leaders in the field such as\n106.\nPlanters  Bank  -  will  be  provided  through  the  BSSF.  BSSF  will  organize  the  provision  of\nappropriately structured training and capacity building exercises to be provided by private sector\nservice providers on a fee basis. The PCIs will enter into understanding with the BSSF for this\npurpose. The BSSF will, in consultation with the Government and the participating banks, also\nprovide  assistance  in  upgrading  the  capacity  of  the  local  banking  institutes  in  terms  of\ncurriculum, training of trainers, etc.\n\n107. PCIs will enter into a contract with the Government under which they will submit annual\naudited statements of their operations over five years, displaying profitability, capital adequacy,\nrate of default and provisioning. In addition, each PCI will satisfy ADB regarding its SME lending\nhistory and capacity, as well as its ability to report loan statistics to the project management unit\n(PMU).\n\n108. Each  PCI  will  be  given  training  in  ADB  disbursement  methods  and  in  record  keeping\nprocedures.\n\n109.\nThe BSSF will conduct on, an as-needed basis, impact assessments on a subset of the\nloan  recipients  to  look  for  impact  data,  including  employment,  increased  sales,  new  markets,\nnew technologies, reduced expenses, etc.\n\n3.  Credit Enhancement\n\n110.\nTo supplement ADB-financed resources, and with a view to promoting both institutional\nand market development, credit enhancement will be provided in the form of an ADB PCG (the\nADB guarantee) to each participating bank to allow commercial cofinancing of an aggregate of\nup  to  $90  million.  The  ADB  guarantee  will  enhance  the  credit  of  the  participating  banks  and\nenable  them  to  access  funding  on  better  terms  than  would  otherwise  be  possible,  thereby\nreducing  their  dependence  on  multilateral  sources  for  such  funding.  The  ADB  guarantee  will\nrequire  the  repayment  of  principal  to  commercial  cofinanciers.  The  ADB  guarantee  will  be\ncounter-guaranteed  by  the  Government,  which  will  also  guarantee  interest  payments  to\ncommercial cofinanciers. Processing of the commercial cofinancing and the ADB guarantee will\nbe initiated  (i) when 50 percent of the lines of credit have been disbursed, and (ii) when legal\namendments  or  modifications  have  been  completed,  enabling  the  Government  to  provide  the\nrelevant  guarantee  and  counterguarantees  of  the  commercial  cofinancing.  Commercial\ncofinanciers  will  be  selected  competitively  in  accordance  with  standard  ADB  policies  and\nprocedures.\n\nF.\n\nSocial and Environmental Measures\n\nThe project is not expected to generate adverse social impacts requiring corresponding\n111.\nmitigating  measures.  To  promote  gender  equality  and  poverty  reduction  special  consideration\nwill be given under both investment loans to women entrepreneurs and regions with high levels\nof  poverty.    To  ensure  effective  monitoring  and  assessment  of  socioeconomic  impacts,  a\ncomprehensive  set  of  socioeconomic  indicators  of  entrepreneurs  and  employees  will  be\ncollected  by  the  PCIs  in  a  computerized  format  as  part  of  their  loan  monitoring  requirements.\nThe  project\u2019s  environmental  category  is  B,  requiring  PCIs  to  have  appropriate  safeguards  in\nplace  as  regards  to  subloan  selection  to  ensure  that  adverse  environmental  impacts  are\navoided.  The PCIs and the EAs have been found to have adequate capacity for this purpose.\n\n\f26\n\nV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE\n\nIt is proposed that ADB provide a policy loan, two investment loans and a partial credit\n\n112.\nguarantee support:\n\nThe Policy Loan\n\nA.\n \n\n1.\n\nAmount, Terms, and Sources of Funds\n\n113.\nThe  policy  loan  of  $20  million  equivalent  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds\nresources and  will (ii) have a repayment period of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years;\nand (iii) carry an interest rate of 1.0 percent during the grace period and 1.5 percent thereafter.\nThe  loan  will  support  a  program  of  reforms  and  will  be  released  in  two  tranches  that  will  use\ncounterpart funds. The following is a preliminary estimate of the costs of adjustment:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nincluding  establishment  and\nadministrative  costs  of \noperation  of  the  SME  task  force,  the  SME  policy  unit  and  the  annual  baseline\nsurveys; the operational costs of the Deregulation Committee (estimated at about\n$2 million); and\n\ninstitutional  changes \n\nloss  in  revenues  from  tax  and  tariff  reform:  elimination  of  the  turnover  tax  on\nbanking  ($16  million)  and  stamp  duty  on  imports  ($45  million);  reduction  in\nNational  Security  Levy  ($20  million).  The  loss  in  revenues  of  about  $90  is\nexpected to be mitigated by end-2002 by an increase in the GST tax and other\nmeasures,  including  improvement  in  collection  of  tax  arrears  and  expansion  of\nregistration, which are to be determined and implemented in consultation with the\nADB  and  IMF.  Overall,  during  2002\u20132006,  it  is  expected  that  tax  reforms  will\nachieve revenue neutrality.\n\n2.\n\nProcurement and Disbursement\n\nThe proceeds of the policy loan will be utilized to finance the full foreign exchange costs\n114.\n(excluding the local duties and taxes) of imports produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member\ncountries,  other  than  those  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  item  (Appendix  8)  and  imports\nfinanced  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  All  procurement  will  be  through  normal\ncommercial  practices  in  case  of  procurement  by  the  private  sector,  or  prescribed  procedures\nacceptable to ADB in the case of procurement by the public sector, having due regard for the\nprinciples of economy and efficiency. The Borrower will certify that the volume of eligible imports\nexceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the policy loan in a given period.\nADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the\nBorrower\u2019s certification.\n\n3.\n\nCounterpart Funds\n\n115.\nThe  policy  framework  for  the  SMESDP  includes  specific  components  that  bear  distinct\ncosts of structural adjustments. The counterpart funds to be generated from the loan proceeds\nwill  be  used  to  finance  the  structural  adjustment  costs  under  the  SMESDP.  In  particular,  the\nGovernment will ensure that in social expenditures on health and education will be maintained\nat current levels during the Program period.\n\n\f27\n\n4.\n\nTranching  and Monitoring\n \na.\n \n\nTranching\n\n(i)\n\nTranche 1 - $10 million\n\nThe first tranche of $10 million will be released upon fulfillment of the following actions\n\n116.\nprior to Board consideration in December 2001. All conditions have been completed:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nnotification of the establishment of a task force for SMEs;\n\nestablishment  of  a  deregulation  committee  and  submission    of  a  deregulation\nstudy on transactions costs and tax administration;\n\nelimination  of  the  turnover  tax  on  financial  institutions  and  the  Save-the-Nation\nContribution;\n\nreduction in stamp duties on imports from 2 percent to 1 percent, and reduction\nin national security levy by 1 percentage point;\n\nestablishment of a Cabinet Subcommittee, chaired by the Minister of Posts and\nTelecommunications, \nintroducing  greater\ncompetition in the provision of telephony services through the award of additional\nlicense(s) to eliminate SLT\u2019s  monopoly of the independent gateway; and\n\nto  develop  an  action  plan \n\nfor \n\n(vi) \n\nestablishment of a  working group for Legal Reform of the Financial  Sector.\n\n(ii)\n\nTranche 2 - $10 million\n\nThe  second  tranche  of  $10  million  will  be  released  upon  fulfillment  of  the  following\n\n117.\nactions, expected by June 2003:\n\n(i) \n\nsubmission of a national strategy paper for SME development by the SME task\nforce;\n\n(ii) \n\nelimination of the stamp duty on imports;\n\nsubmission of an agreed upon tax reform strategy paper and action plan for the\nmediumterm;\n\nimplementation  of  the  first  phase  of  reduction  in  corporate  income  tax,  in\naccordance with the time table  agreed upon in the tax reform action plan;\n\nrationalization  of  the  incentive  structure  through  harmonization  of  all  tax\nincentives in the Inland Revenue Act of the Borrower; and\n\nelimination of SLT\u2019s monopoly in the provision of telephony services through the\nawarding of at least one more license for the  independent gateway.\n\n118.\nThe  reforms  under  the  SDP  set  in  place  a  medium-term  framework  that  provides\ncapacity for (i) strategic guidance in the SME sector provided by the task force, (ii) day- to- day\n\n\f28\n\nassessments  of  SME-related  concerns  through  the  SME  Policy  Unit,  and  (iii)  policy  and\nregulatory  management  in  the  medium  term  by  the  Deregulation  Committee  to  simplify  the\nbusiness  enabling  environment.  These  initiatives  will  support  and  be  supported  by  ongoing\nefforts to simplify the tax system and further deregulate the economy. In connection with the tax\nsystem,  ADB  and  IMF  have  been  jointly  assisting  the  Government  to  develop  a  long-term\nagenda  for  reform  for  possible  support  through  project  and  technical  assistance  (TA).    At  the\nsame  time,  another  project  for  assistance  to  the  SME  sector  is  being  considered  for  possible\nADB  support  in  2004.  Subject  to  progress  made  in  the  Program,  this  proposed  project  would\nconsolidate  the  reform  agendas  developed  in  the  areas  of  secured  transactions,  deregulation,\nand other issues relevant to SME promotion.\n\n                \n\nb.        Monitoring\n\n119. ADB will, in cooperation with the Government, carry out semiannual reviews of progress\nin project implementation, and will assess its impact on the enterprise and other sectors of the\neconomy. The Government will keep ADB informed of outcomes of the policy discussions with\nIMF and the World Bank Group and other multilateral and bilateral funding agencies that have\nimplications for SMESDP implementation.\n\n120.\nIn  addition  to  the  semiannual  progress  reports,  the  Government  will  submit  a  program\ncompletion report to ADB within three months of the end of the program period. This report will\nevaluate the implementation of the policy reform measures under the SMESDP, their impact on\nthe economy and the enterprise sector, lessons learned during the program period, and further\nreforms  and  assistance  needed  for  sector  development.  Monitoring  indicators  are  provided  in\nthe program framework (Appendix 3).\n\nB.\n\nThe Investment Loan for the Business Services Support Facility\n\n1. \n\nAmount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n\n121.\nThe loan of $6 million equivalent will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. It\nwill    have  a  repayment  period  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and    carry  an\ninterest charge of 1.0 percent during the grace period and 1.5 percent thereafter. The loan will\nbe  used  to  finance  the  cost  of  consulting  contracts  and  procurement  associated  with  the\noperations of the BSSF. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk of the loan.\n\n122.\n\nThe EA will be the Ministry of Trade and Industry.\n\n2. \n\nProcurement\n\n123. ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\nfor Procurement. Bidding documents to be prepared will ensure maximum competition. The cost\nof individual procured items is not expected to exceed  $50,000. The list of items is expected to\ninclude automobiles (no more than two vehicles) and ICT for the BSSF.\n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n124.\nThe  BSSF  will  have  an  international  Director  and  two  domestic  experts  plus  an  office\nmanager and one secretarial assistant. These services will be engaged in accordance with the\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n\n\f29\n\n4. \n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\n125. Since  the  disbursements  will  be  for  supply  of  goods  and  services,  ADB\u2019s  commitment\nand direct payment procedures will be used.\n\nC.\n\nThe Investment Loan for the Lines of Credit to  Participating Credit Institutions\n\n1. \n\nAmount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n\n126.\nThe  loan  of  $60  million  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  the\nGovernment  as  Borrower.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3\nyears;  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  a\ncommitment  charge  of  0.75  percent  per  annum;  a  front-  end  fee  of  1.0  percent;  conversion\noptions  that  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  draft  loan  agreement,  the\nloan  regulations  and  ADB's Conversion Guidelines;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set\nforth in the draft loan agreement. The Government will provide ADB with (a) the reasons for the\nGovernment's  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB's  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of\nthese  terms  and  conditions,  and  (b)  an  undertaking  that  these  terms  and  conditions  were  the\nGovernment's  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or\nadvice of ADB.\n\n127.\nThe  Government  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk  of  the  loan.  The  Government  will\nmake the loans available to the PCIs under a subsidiary loan agreement. The PCIs will onlend\nthe  funds  to  SMEs  at  a  rate  that  reflects  the  generally  recognized  cost  of  funds,  the  average\nweighted deposit rate (AWDR),  plus a spread that covers transaction costs and a return for risk.\n\n2. \n\nOnlending and Relending\n\n  The  loan  will  have  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  the  loan  from  ADB  to  the\n128.\nGovernment in relation to interest rates and front-end fee (1 percent of the loan amount). Loans\nto the PCIs will have maturities of 7-to10 years, with a grace period of 2 years. The Government\nwill  absorb  commitment  charges  on  the  ADB  loan  (0.75  percent  per  annum  on  increasing\nportions  of  the  undisbursed  loan  amount  beginning  60  days  after  loan  signing).  Loan  funds  to\nPCIs  will  be  allocated  on  a  first-come,  first-served  basis,  based  on  the  subborrowers'\napplication. The PCIs will onlend the proceeds of the subsidiary loans to eligible subborrowers\nfor  a  period  of  up  to  10  years,  including  a  grace  period  not  exceeding  2  years.  Subloan\nrepayment  schedules  will  be  based  on  the  cash-flow  projections  for  the  loan-financed\ninvestments.  The  Government  will  charge  an  onlending  rate  equal  to  the  AWDR,  unless  this\nfalls to below 10 percent. In the latter event, the  Government will charge AWDR plus 1 percent,\nsubject to a cap of 10 percent when the AWDR is between 9 \u2013 10 percent.\n\n3.\n\nSubloan Size\n\n129. Subloan sizes will range up to SLRs35 million. PCIs will be free to determine the size of\nloans within this limit.\n\n4. \n\nSelection of Participating Credit Institutions\n\n130.\nThe PCIs for onlending of the credit line will be DFCC, HNB, CBC, NDB, and Sampath\nBank.  The  PCIs  were  selected  on  the  basis  of  an  expanded  version  of  the  Private  Sector\nGroup\u2019s  due  diligence  questionnaire.  This  has  involved  the  review  of  the  lending  procedures\n\n\f30\n\nand performance, and project pipeline of the selected banks (see Appendix 9). These banks are\nsound  of  management,  operation,  and  financial  performance;  follow  prudent  practices  and\nperform due diligence in identifying and monitoring lending. The banks\u2019 past loans across a wide\nrange of subsectors were evaluated and found to be well selected. A review of future of projects\nindicate that they are likely to be similar in terms of returns.\n\n131. PCIs  must  meet  financial  and  operational  eligibility  criteria.  They  must  exceed  or\notherwise  be  in  compliance  with  all  applicable  prudential  regulations  and  guidelines  of  the\nCentral  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  (CBSL)  including,  but  not  limited  to  (i)  capital  adequacy  ratio  of  at\nleast  9  percent  as  amended  from  time  to  time;  (ii)    recognition  of  income  and  classification  of\nassets,  and  valuation  of  security  for  all  loans,  leases  and  other  advances;  (iii)    maintaining\nrequired reserves for deposits; (iv)  limiting  total exposure to a single borrower or lessee to a\nmaximum of 30 percent  of shareholders\u2019 equity; and (v)  provisioning for nonperforming loans\nor other statutory or regulatory reserves. The banks will also have the following financial ratios:\n(i)  a  debt-service  coverage  ratio  of  at  least  1.25:1  (ii)  a  long-term  debt-  to-  equity  ratio  not\nexceeding  8:1  (iii)  an  annual  collection  ratio  and  the  cumulative  collection  ratio  of  at  least  80\npercent  and  (iv)  a  minimum  return  on  average  assets  of  at  least  1  percent.  Additionally,  the\nbanks must be in compliance with maintenance of (i)SME nonperforming loans (encompassing\nsubstandard, doubtful and loss classifications) of less than 10 percent; and (ii) a loan loss rate\n(encompassing  nonperforming  loans  of  18  months  and  over)  on  the  SME  portfolio  under  this\nloan window and the PCG, based on the complete listing of all loans that would meet the criteria\nfor qualified enterprises.\n\n132.\nTo access funds, each PCI will: (i) have adopted a corporate mission statement on SME\nlending,  policies  and  procedures  focused  on  SME  loan  development,  processing  and\nadministration; (ii) ensure that nonperforming loans will be less than 15 percent of for the entire\nloan portfolio and less than 10 percent of the nonperforming loans in the SME loans portfolio;\nbut  if  it  has  more  than  10  percent  nonperforming  loans,  the  PCI    will  also  have  a  general\nprovision for loan losses, which, when combined with the special provision of that amounts to at\nleast  25  percent  of  the  total  loan  volume  of  nonperforming  loans,  and  a  Board-approved\nstrategy    for  reducing    nonperforming  loans  to  below  10  percent  within  three  years;  (iii)  have\nadopted  loan  policies  and  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  that  make  use  of  the  information\nprovided  by  the  PCI\u2019s  computerized  loan  management  system  for  loan  administration  and\ncollection; (iv) have adopted a fully automated management information system able to produce\nmonthly reports on the bank\u2019s financial condition and its SME lending activity in all branches as\ndetermined necessary by ADB and submitted directly to  ADB electronically within 40 days after\nthe end of the month of the previous quarter\u2019s activity, except for year end financial statements,\nwhich  will    be  provided  within  60  days  of  year  end  and  an  audited  year  end  report  within  120\ndays  of  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year;  (v)  have  initiated  a  program  to  develop  and/or  adopt  a\nqualified enterprise loan scoring system tailored to each loan category thus facilitating express\nprocessing  of  qualified  enterprise  loan  applications;  and  (vi)  have  certified  that  they  are  in\ncompliance  with  corporate  governance  standards  satisfactory  to  ADB  and  specified  in  the\nInstitute  of  Chartered  Accountants  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  Report  of  the  Committee  to  Make\nRecommendations on Matters Relating to Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance.\n\n133. Each  bank  will  be  required  to  adopt  a  fully  computerized  and  parameterized  reporting\nsystem  covering  (i)  operational  loan  monitoring,  (ii)  socioeconomic  monitoring,  (iii)  financial\nmonitoring, and (iv) performance ratios and indicators.\n\n\f31\n\n5. \n\nSelection, Appraisal, and Approval of Subloans\n\n134.\nThe investment loan will seek to finance economically and financially viable subloans in\na  broad  range  of  economic  sectors.  Special  emphasis  will  be  given  to  subloans  for  women\nentrepreneurs and to provinces with relatively high levels of poverty. All subloans must comply\nwith ADB's and the Government's social protection policies, including resettlement policies, and\nenvironmental standards. All subloans will be made against the same criteria of sound banking,\ncommercial, and financial practices, etc.\n\n135.\n  Privately  owned  SMEs  that  have  total  assets,  excluding  land  and  buildings,  below\nSLRs35 million prior to subloans (and below Rs. 70 million after the subloans) and meet sound\nbanking, commercial, and financial criteria will be eligible for financing. The following additional\nfinancial  criteria  will  be  applied  in  selecting  subloans:  the  subloan  will  have  (i)  an  estimated\nfinancial internal rate of return of not less than the average weighted cost of capital, and (ii) an\neconomic internal rate of return not less than 12 percent.\n\n136. Each subloan application will be accompanied by the subloan feasibility report prepared\nby the PCI. The first three subloans of each PCI will be referred to ADB for approval.  After that,\nPCIs will be responsible for subloan approvals, subject to monitoring and review by ADB.\n\n6. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n137. Each PCI will establish a project implementation unit (PIU) in its credit department. The\nPlUs  will  coordinate  with  other  relevant  bank  departments  the  acquisition,  appraisal,  and\nmanagement  of  the  subloans  and  ensure  that  ADB  information  and  reporting  requirements\nrelated to the PCI and the subloans are met. PCIs are expected to ensure that their SME credit\nmanagement is strengthened and will establish their own training programs or will avail of such\ntraining programs through commercial means. If necessary, they will avail of the services of the\nBSSF,  on  commercial  terms,  to  acquire  the  needed  training.  ADB  will  further  assess  of  the\nreadiness of the PCIs to avail of the lines of credit prior to loan effectiveness.\n\n138.\nThe  closing  date  for  submission  of  subloan  applications  for  approval  and  authorization\nfor  withdrawals  will  be  four  years  after  the  date  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  closing  dates  for\ndisbursements will be five years after the same date.\n\n7.\n\nPeriod of Utilization\n\n8.\n\nProcurement\n\n139. ADB's Guidelines for Procurement applicable  to  DFIs  will  be  followed.  All  procurement\nunder  ADB-financed  subloans  will  be  made  from  ADB  member  countries.  Subborrowers  are\nrequired  to (i)  demonstrate  that  the  procurement  procedures  adopted  are  appropriate  in  the\ncircumstances,  and  (ii)  ensure  that  the  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  by  subloans  are\npurchased  at  a  reasonable  price,  given  the  time  of  delivery,  efficiency,  and  reliability  of  the\ngoods, suitability for the subloan, availability of maintenance facilities and spare parts, and the\nquality and the competence of the parties rendering services. Subborrowers will be encouraged\nto  procure  loan-financed  goods  through  international  competitive  bidding  or  international\nshopping. Procurement will be conducted in a transparent manner to conform with ADB's anti-\ncorruption policy.\n\n\f32\n\n9.\n\nDisbursements\n\n140.\nFor  the  credit  assistance,  responsibility  for  appropriately  completing  all  withdrawal  and\nliquidation  procedures  will  reside  with  the  PMU  of  the  EA,  the  MOFP.  For  the  credit\nenhancement, the individual banks will themselves take this responsibility. Thus, MOFP and the\nPCIs  for  credit  enhancement  will  be  responsible  for  collecting  supporting  documents,  and\npreparing withdrawal applications, and sending them to ADB in accordance with the ADB Loan\nDisbursement Handbook.\n\n10.\n\nReporting Requirements\n\na. \n\nExternal Audit\n\n141.\nThe  PCIs  will  have  their  accounts  and  financial  statements  (balance  sheet,  income\nstatement, and statement of sources and application of funds) audited annually in accordance\nwith  sound  and  internationally  accepted  auditing  standards  by  independent  external  auditors\nacceptable to ADB. For credit assistance and credit enhancement, respectively, the MOFP and\nPCIs  will  submit  to  ADB,  not  later  than  six  months  after  the  close  of  each  financial  year,  their\naudited  financial  statements  and  the  auditor's  long-form  audit  report  relating  to  supplementary\ninformation  on  their  accounts,  including  an  assessment  of  the  quality  of  their  long-term  loans,\nadequacy of the provision for doubtful loans, and the PCIs corporate and financial governance\npractices.\n\nThe  MOFP  and  PCIs  will  submit  to  ADB  reports  and  information  that  ADB  may\n142.\nreasonably request concerning the loan and its utilization; the subloans; other matters relating to\nthe purposes of the Project; quarterly progress reports, in a format to be agreed upon with ADB\nwithin 60 days after the end of the relevant quarter; and a project completion report, within three\nmonths of loan closing date.\n\nb.\n\nCharter and Management Changes\n\nThe Government and the PCIs will ensure that ADB is given an opportunity to comment\n143.\non any substantial amendments proposed to the PCIs' charters. Unless ADB agrees, the PCIs\nwill  (i)  consult  with  ADB  before  making  any  changes  in  their  operational  policies  that  would\nmaterially  affect  project  implementation,  and  (ii)  inform  ADB  of  any  proposed  changes  in\nappointing the chief executive officer.\n\nD.\n\nThe ADB Partial Credit Guarantee\n\nThe  proposed  cofinancing  will  be  supported  by  ADB  partial  credit  guarantee.  ADB\n144.\nguarantee  support  is  necessary  because  (i)  the  participating  Sri  Lankan  banks  (PCIs)  cannot\naccess  international  financial  markets  on  their  own  credit  for  the  long-term  required  by  the\nProgram, (ii) the SME subborrowers under the Program need credit on extended terms, which\nthe  PCIs  are  unable  to  provide  given  their  current  funding  base;  and  (iii)  the  PCIs  (and\nultimately,  sub-borrowers)  can  obtain  significantly  better  pricing  than  would  otherwise  be\npossible.\n\n\f33\n\nADB Partial Credit Guarantee Structure\n\nGovernment of\nSri Lanka\n\nGovernment of\nSri Lanka\n\nCounter\nGuarantee\n\nADB\n\nPartial Credit\nGuarantee\n(Principal Repayments)\n\nGuarantee\n(Interest Repayments)\n\nCommercial Cofinanciers\n\nFC Loans\n\n(eligibility criteria)\n\n(access criteria)\n\nPCIs\nCBC; DFCC; HNB; NDB; Sampath\n\n(Sinking Fund\nfor Repayment)\n\n(Sub-loan Criteria)\n\nFC + Rs Loans\n\nSMEs\n\nNotations\n\n= Asian Development Bank\n= Commercial Bank of Ceylon\n\nADB\nCBC\nDFCC = DFCC Bank\nDFI\nFC\nHNB\nNDB\nPCIs\nRs\nSME\n\n= Development Finance Institutions\n= Foreign Currency\n= Hatton National Bank\n= National Development Bank of Sri Lanka\n= Participating Credit Institutions\n= Sri Lankan Rupees\n= Small and Medium Sized Enterprises\n\n\f34\n\n145. Processing of the cofinancing and the Guarantee will be initiated upon (i) disbursement\nof 50 percent of the $60 million for onlending to be provided from ADB\u2019s own resources; and (ii)\nthe Government having obtained the necessary legal amendments for it to provide the required\nguarantee and counterguarantee for all the PCIs, including the DFIs and the private commercial\nbanks. The amount of commercial cofinancing will be up to a maximum of $90 million, subject to\nconfirmation  that  this  remains  a  reasonable  figure  in  the  light  of  economic  conditions,  debt-\nservicing  capacity  of  SME  endborrowers,  the  absorptive  capacity  of  the  PCIs,  their  financial\ncondition,  and  the  status  of  compliance  with  prudential  regulations  and  loan  covenants.  The\ndetailed  structure  and  pricing  of  the  cofinancing  will  be  finalized  on  the  basis  of  competitive\nproposals  solicited  from  potential  cofinanciers.  ADB\u2019s  guarantee  obligation  to  commercial\ncofinanciers is estimated to be about $53 million initially, assuming the cofinancing is for the full\namount  of  $90  million.10  Upon  finalization  of  the  commercial  cofinancing  and  guarantee\noperation, the staff will prepare a Board information paper describing the full particulars of the\ntransaction.\n\n146.\nIn  accordance  with  the  revised  policy  covering  PCGs,  ADB  will  charge  for  its  own\naccount (a) a front-end fee of 90 basis points on the face value of the PCG, and (b) a guarantee\nfee of 0.40 percent per annum against the present value of the ADB guarantee obligation. The\nGovernment  will  charge  (a)  a  counterguarantee  fee  of  1  percent  per  annum  against  the  face\nvalue of the ADB guarantee, and (b) a guarantee fee of 1 percent per annum against the face\nvalue of its guarantee of interest payments. The above arrangement is subject to clearance from\nthe Attorney General regarding the provision of a Government guarantee on interest payments\nto  the  private  commercial  banks,  and  further  requires  the  Government  to  bear  the  foreign\nexchange risk. The structure of the commercial cofinancing (e.g., whether floating rate or fixed\nrate, the currency of the tranches, drawdowns, etc.) will be determined subsequently in the light\nof  market  soundings  and  the  evaluation  of  financing  offers  submitted  by  prospective\ncofinanciers.  Cofinanciers  will  be  selected  on  a  competitive  basis  in  accordance  with  ADB\npolicies and procedures.\n\n147.\nIt  is  envisaged  that  a  syndicate  of  international  commercial  lenders  will  provide  the\ncofinancing. The commercial lenders will enter into a separate loan agreement with each of the\nfive participating Sri Lankan banks.  The cofinanciers and a lead borrowing bank will negotiate\nstandard  documentation  for  the  proposed  cofinancing.    The  documentation  will  be  modified  to\nreflect the specific terms and conditions of the five borrowers (e.g., with respect to cofinancing\namounts,  repayment  amounts,  etc.).  Based  on  initial  market  soundings,  the  commercial\ncofinancing is expected to have a final maturity of 10 years.  The ADB guarantee will cover the\ninterest  payments  and\nrepayment  of  principal,  while \ncounterguarantee \nthe  proposed\nthe  ADB  guarantee.  Additional \ncommercial cofinancing and the ADB guarantee is provided in Appendix 10.\n\nthe  Government  will  guarantee \n\ninformation  concerning \n\nE.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nProject Organization\n\n148. MOFP  will  constitute  a  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  at  project  start-up,  with  the\nSecretary of the Treasury as chair. The PSC will be so constituted as to be able to solve any\nimplementation issues that arise. Founding members of the PSC will comprise representatives\nfrom  MOFP,  Ministry  of  Industrial  Development,  CBSL,  PCIs,  Deregulation  Committee,  and\nChamber of Commerce. The PSC will be responsible for overall guidance and direction of the\n\n                                                          \n10 Based on the present value of the ADB guarantee as shown in Table A10, Appendix 10.\n\n\f35\n\nProgram and will guide a Project Management Unit to be established for coordinating activities\nbetween  the  various  beneficiaries  of  the  Program.  The  PSC  will  meet  once  every  quarter  and\ngive guidance on its implementation. The PSC chair will liaise between the Program and ADB\non all matters requiring changed allocations of project funds.\n\n149.\nThe PMU will (i) be responsible for the day-to-day execution particularly of its business\nservices  development  and  credit  line  component;  (ii)  will  handle  administration  and  financial\nreporting,  coordinating  the  inputs  of  the  institutions  participating  in  BSSF  and  credit  line\ncomponents, and provide secretariat functions for the PSC and its subcommittees; and (iii) be\nresponsible  for  ensuring  that  reporting  requirements  of  ADB  are  satisfied.  In  addition  to  the\nProject  Director,  PMU  will  have  an  administrative  staff  consisting  of  an  accountant,  a  banking\nspecialist  and  a  project  officer  to  manage  the  Project\u2019s  coordination.    Appendix  7  gives  the\nterms of reference for the PMU.\n\n2. \n\nDisbursements\n\nLoan  proceeds  for  the  credit  assistance  will  be  made  available  to  the  Government  for\n150.\nrelending  to  PCIs  via  subsidiary  loan  agreements  on  a  first-come  first-serve  basis.  The  loan\nproceeds  may  be  used  to  finance  expenditure  incurred  not  earlier  than  180  days  before\nwithdrawal of the loan amount. Funding under the proposed PCG will be received by the PCIs in\na single payment on closing. For the BSSF component, an imprest account will be established\nin CBSL   . The initial amount to be deposited into this account will not exceed the equivalent of\n$600,000.  After  the  initial  deposit,  the  account  will  thereafter  be  simultaneously  liquidated  and\nreplenished  on  a  regular  basis  to  ensure  that  sufficient  funds  are  available  for  project\nimplementation.\n\n3.\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\nThe PMU will prepare quarterly progress reports for the Program for the periods ending\n151.\n31 March, 30 June, 30 September, and 31 December of each year, and will submit them to ADB\nthrough MOFP no later than 30 days after the end of the relevant period. The reports will be in a\nformat acceptable to ADB and will include (i) information on the progress of implementation, (ii)\nimplementation  issues  encountered  and  measures  adopted  for  their  resolution,  and  (iii)\ninformation  on  the  status  of  compliance  with  the  loan  covenants.  The  reports  will  also  include\ninformation  on  operations  and  performance  of  participating  financial  institutions.  Furthermore,\nthe PMU will submit brief monthly progress reports via fax or E-mail. The PMU will also submit\nto ADB all reports prepared by consultants recruited under the loan and TA .\n\n152.\nThe  Government,  acting  through  MOFP,  will  maintain  consistent  records  and  accounts\nadequate to identify goods and services financed from the proceeds of the loan. MOFP will (i)\nmaintain separate accounts for the Program, and (ii) ensure that accounts and related financial\nstatements  are  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  international  accounting  standards  by  the\nauditors acceptable to ADB. Accounts of the PCIs will be based on an annual basis. The PMU\nwill  submit  to  ADB  certified  copies  of  the  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  in  the\nEnglish  language  within  six  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year.  In  addition,  PCIs  will\nsubmit  semiannual  unaudited  accounts  to  the  PMU.  Annual  audit  of  the  BSSF  by  a  firm\napproved by ADB will be undertaken and forwarded to ADB within three months after the end of\nthe  half-year  and  fiscal  year.  Detailed  quarterly  reports  of  the  financial  position  of  the  funds\nunder  the  BSSF,  with  itemized  income  and  disbursements,  will  be  sent  to  ADB  every  four\nmonths,  within  one  month  after  the  period  ends.  A  project  completion  report  will  be  prepared\nthree months after the completion of the project.\n\n\f36\n\nThe BSSF will be managed through the PMU, which will in turn report to the PSC. The\n153.\nBSSF funding will be held in an imprest account with CBSL.  Details of the BSSF operations will\nbe documented in a memorandum of understanding between MOFP and the PMU, which will be\ndrafted  and  executed  in  a  manner  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  PMU  will  monitor  the  activities  of\nBDS  providers  contracted  to  deliver  services,  and  present  summary  reports  to  the  PSC  on  a\nquarterly basis. Progress reports by the institutions participating with the BSSF will form part of\nthe contract agreed to by the parties.\n\n  ADB  will  monitor  socioeconomic  and  environmental  benefits  of  the  subloans.  In\n154.\naddition,  subloans  will  be  selected  for  ongoing,  long-term  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation.\nADB  has  provided  specific  computerized  and  parameterized  data  collection  and  reporting\nformats for use by the PCIs.\n\nVI. \n\nTHE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n\nThe Government has requested TA from ADB for enabling SME Growth, principally for\n155.\nsupporting advisory work and capacity building under the SDP. The proposed TA will have four\ncomponents. First, support for establishing of a SME policy unit which is expected to initiate a\nmajor effort in conducting a baseline survey for SMEs, and in preparing reviews of the enabling\nenvironment  for  biases  against  SMEs.    Second,  support  to  the  Deregulation  Committee  in  its\nwork to identify impediments to investment by both foreign and domestic firms, large firms, and\nSMEs.  In  addition  to  studies,  the  committee's  hearings  and  workshops  are  expected  to\ncontribute significantly to improving the consultative process between the private sector and the\nGovernment.  Third,  to  prepare  the  ground  for  reforms  to  improve  SME  access  to  nonbank\nfinance,  support  will  be  provided  for  a  study  of  the  legal  framework  for  secured  transactions.\nFourth, support will be given to promote greater use of IT by SMEs. This component envisages\ndevelopment of a SME portal, SME directory, and assistance to promote partnerships between\nIT-based BDS providers and NGOs.\n\n156.\nThe TA will require 22 person-months of international and 30 person-months of domestic\nconsulting  services.  The  combined  TA  cost  is  estimated  at  $1,580,000  equivalent  comprising\n$865,000  in  foreign  exchange  and  $715,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide\n$1,250,000  to  cover  the  foreign  exchange  costs  of  $865,000  and  $385,000  equivalent  of  the\nlocal  currency  component.  The  TA  will  be  financed  by  ADB  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan\nSpecial  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  balance  in  local  currency  cost  in  the\namount of $330,000 equivalent will be financed by the Government. Appendix 6 provides details\nof the cost estimates and financing plan.\n\nThe TA is expected to start in January 2002. The Ministry of Trade and Industry will be\n\n157.\nthe EA.\n\nVII.\n\nBENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA. \n\nExpected Impacts\n\n1. \n\nPolicy Reforms and Capacity Building\n\nIn  the  short  term,  adjustment  costs  will  be  significant.  These  will  be  mitigated  over  the\n158.\nmedium term by major benefits from the policy reforms under the Program. The principal benefit\nis  a  more  transparent  policy  framework  for  business.  This  will  benefit  SMEs,  which  will  face  a\n\n\f37\n\nmore predictable and less costly business environment. The more conducive policy environment\nwill  promote  broad-based  growth  through  business  start-ups  and  expansion  of  existing\nbusinesses.  The  impact  will  be  aided  through  the  provision  of  capacity  building  for  SMEs  and\nbanks by the BSSF, and the provision of credit for SME projects, which will help the sector to\ngrow.  An expanding SME sector will stimulate the demand for labor from the household sector\nwhere  the  poor  are  predominantly  found.  It  will  lead  to  the  shifting  of  workers  from  agriculture\nand  nonwage  employment  to  jobs  of  higher  productivity  and  higher  wages  in  industry  and\nservices. This growth in overall employment and the intersectoral shifting of workers will reduce\npoverty.\n\n159. Over  the  medium  term,  the  Government  will  benefit  from  improved  capabilities  in  SME\npolicy  formulation,  while  stakeholders  will  have  more  effective  input  into  policy  design  and\nimplementation.\n\n160.\n  Income  and  employment  generation  will  be  significant.  Using  employment  generation\ncoefficients from previous ADB-financed loan projects to Sri Lanka, and assuming a reduction of\nabout 20 percent in this coefficient in view of the higher maximum loan size, gross employment\nfrom the credit component alone is expected to be of the order of 65,000 new jobs. However, as\n40  percent  of  new  SMEs  are  expected  to  go  out  of  business  (admittedly  over  an  eight-year\nperiod), the result in the long term is net employment creation of about 40,000. Most of the jobs\ncreated will be in the manufacturing sector, but a significant amount will be in nonmanufacturing\nsectors  where  poverty  incidence  is  greatest,  especially  among  casual  or  contractual  workers,\nincluding women.\n\nThe  new  jobs  will  reduce  disguised  unemployment  and  underemployment  among  the\n161.\nless educated low-income people, and thus help in reducing the extent of poverty. The Program\nwill have only a limited impact on the hard-core poor, who are mostly assetless people who live\nin remote areas and have very little skills or education. It is the marginally poor who are more\nlikely  to  benefit,  as  they  possess  the  education,  skills,  and  the  aptitude  that  are  needed  to  do\nwell in a modern business environment.\n\n162. Since  women  traditionally  account  for  nearly  half  of  production  workers  in  the  SME\nsector, the Project should have a favorable impact on the employment and income of women.\nBecause  women  are  traditionally  underrepresented  in  the  ranks  of  entrepreneurs  the  situation\ncalls for special attention to the needs of women entrepreneurs.\n\nTo  address  the  above  concerns,  subloan  selection  for  women  entrepreneurs  and\n163.\nrelatively  poor  regions  will  receive  special  emphasis.  These  loans  will  be  provided  on\ncommercial terms. The poverty impact assessment is in Appendix 11.\n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts\n\n164. New  investments  or  expansion  of  SME  activities  that  will  be  funded  by  the  credit\ncomponent may generate potential impacts. However, the Government\u2019s strong enforcement on\nthe  EIA  regulation  will  automatically  screen  SME  activities.  In  addition,  the  PCIs  experience  in\npromoting  environmental  protection  will  ensure  that  only  SME  activities  that  comply  with\nenvironmental  regulations  would  be \nthe\nfunded  by \nenvironmental impacts associated with the credit component will not be significant.\n\nthis  credit  component.  Therefore, \n\n165. Similarly, the Credit Enhancement is not expected to generate environmental impacts.\n\n\fB. \n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\n38\n\n166.\nThere is a risk is that the enabling environment will remain biased against SMEs. This is\nmitigated  by  (i)  a  consultative  process  in  decision  making;  (ii)  the  establishment  of  the  SME\npolicy  unit,  which  will  periodically  review  the  enabling  environment,  (iii)  a  deregulation\ncommittee  that  will  develop  deregulation  proposals;  and  (iv)  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to\nmake a public response to the deregulation committee\u2019s report through Parliamentary debate on\nits response, and the reasons for it.\n\n167. A  second  risk  is  that  the  market  for  BDS  does  not  respond  sufficiently,  thus  limiting\ncapacity building for SMEs. While this risk is judged to be minor, a related risk is  that the wrong\nelements of the market respond, wasting resources that are used to solicit aid agency support,\nrather  than  serve  the  SME  market  productively.  This  risk  is  mitigated  by  the  flexible  design  of\nthe  facility  for  BDS  support.  Surveys  and  other  methods  will  be  used  to  obtain  feedback  and\nidentify continuously the key supply- and demand-side areas needing stimulation.\n\nThird,  an  inherent  risk  is  that  policy  and  institutional  reforms  alone  will  not  ensure\n168.\nfinancing for firms with viable projects. This risk is partly mitigated by capacity building for SMEs\nthat  will  make  them  better  credit  risks,  and  the  provision  of  significant  credit  resources  to\nfinancial institutions under the SDP for onlending to SMEs. The risk is further mitigated by the\nproject\u2019s  requirement  that  banks\u2019  adopt  credit  scoring  techniques  and  invest  in  ICT  and\nmanagement  information  systems  to  lower  unit  transaction  costs  of  lending  to  SMEs.    Finally,\nlegal reform that will strengthen competition among banks will mitigate this risk further still.\n\n  Fourth,  banks  may  not  be  able  to  lend  to  SMEs  on  a  sustainable  basis  because  of\n169.\ninability  to  access  long-term  funds.  This  implies  the  continued  need  for  aid  agency  or  public\nsector  support  to  promote  financing.  This  risk  is  partly  mitigated  by  changes  to  the  legal\nframework,  which  will  permit  the  provision  of  public  guarantees  to  a  wider  range  of  financial\ninstitutions  for  the  purpose  of  facilitating  access  to  finance.  However,  in  terms  of  access  to\ninternational capital markets, this risk cannot be fully mitigated so long as Sri Lanka is unable to\nobtain a sovereign debt rating, for which an end to the ongoing civil strife is necessary.\n\nFinally, adverse transitional consequences of restructuring and labor retrenchment could\n170.\nprovoke  resistance  from  affected  groups,  slow  the  pace  of  reforms,  and  jeopardize  their\nsustainability.  This  risk  is  mitigated  by  the  Government\u2019s  strong  commitment  to  the  reform\nagenda as well as by the provision of funding under the SDP to support transfer programs. In\naddition,  measures  taken  to  reduce  economic  rent  seeking  are  expected  to  strengthen  public\nconfidence in the reform program.\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVIII.

services will be needed in four areas.\n\n1.\n\nSME  Policy  Unit  and  Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry:  Policy,  SME  Survey\nDatabase \n\n(i)\n\nInternational consultant:\n\n(ii)\n\nDomestic Consultant:\n\nSME policy expert (3 person-months)\nSME  business  services/Survey  expert  (2\nperson-months)\n\nSME policy expert (4 person-months)\nSME  business/survey  expert  (3  person-\nmonths)\n\n2.\nThe SME Policy Unit will receive advisory assistance in carrying out its policy evaluation\nfunctions, and in preparing the format for monitoring Government agencies for the SME impacts\nof their legislation. It will also be assisted to address the problem of lack of accurate statistics\nabout  SMEs  in  Sri  Lanka.  The  plan  is  to  carry  out  an  annual  survey  of  industries  to  collect\nstatistics. The statistics will be recorded in a computer database to allow the information to be\nretrieved when needed and for yearly statistics to be combined. The paper-based format for the\nsurvey will be developed in the light of the survey carried out by the Asian Development Bank.\nThe SME Policy Unit and the Ministry of Trade and Industry will be assisted to plan and execute\nthe survey and also to tabulate and publish results on the web.\n\n2.\n\nThe Deregulation Committee\n\n(i)\n\nInternational consultants:\n\n(ii) Domestic consultants:\n\nDeregulation expert (economist) (3 person-months)\nDeregulation expert (economist/lawyer)\n\n(2.5 person-months)\n\nIndustrial economist (1.5 person-months)\n\nDeregulation expert (economist) (4 person-months)\nDeregulation expert (economist/lawyer)\n\n(4 person-months)\n\nIndustrial economist (3 person-months)\n\nRecognizing  the need to compete for resources in a globalized world with several fully\n3.\nderegulated  countries  such  as  Dubai,  Singapore,  Hong  Kong  China,  and  others,  the\nGovernment established the Deregulation Committee under the Advisory Council to the minister\nof industry to provide recommendations to improve Sri Lanka\u2019s competitiveness. Under the TA,\nthe committee will be assisted\u2013entries to position itself for increased inflow of investment into Sri\nLanka by undertaking the following activities:\n\n(i) \n\nReview  commercial  regulation  and  laws  constraining  competition  or  imposing\nhigh and unnecessary compliance costs.\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nRemove  impediments  (including  true  costs)  to  setting  up  a  business  or  making\nan investment in Sri Lanka.\n\nReduce  the  public-private  interface  (reporting  requirements,  permission,  record\nkeeping, discretionary authority of public officials in granting approvals, etc.) to a\nminimum.\n\nReview markets and market development in Sri Lanka to\n(a)  streamline regulations, and\n(b)  facilitate market development in recognition of the fact that ultimately market\n\ndevelopment is what induces investment and growth.\n\nThe  Deregulation  Committee  will  lead  the  deregulation  effort  through  the  following\n\n4.\nactivities:\n\n(i) \n\nDeveloping  an  awareness  of  deregulation  through  study  and  debate,  periodic\nconsultations, public hearing, and conferences.\n\n(ii) \n\nDevelop and publish deregulation studies to\n\n(a)  identify  areas  and  sectors  where  detailed  deregulation  studies  may  be\n\nrequired,\n\n(b)  prepare terms of reference for such studies and commission them, and\n\n(c)  publish and disseminate the results of such studies.\n\n(iii) \n\nPrepare a deregulation white paper\n\n5.\nThe committee\u2019s studies will prioritize problems, quantify costs of inaction, and propose\nfeasible solutions. The list of topics to be studied should be added to and developed through a\nconsultation  process.  The  committee  should  review,  develop,  and  make  public  the  topic  on\nwhich studies will be made.\n\n(i) \n\nTransaction costs imposed by government on doing business\n\n(a)  Time costs\n\n(b)  Reporting costs\n\n(c)  Recording transactions\n\n(d)  Information provision\n\n(e)  Customs and Inland Revenue as an impediment to doing business\n\n(ii) \n\nLegal  simplifications  that  could  facilitate  business  \u2013  make  the  legal  framework\nmore market friendly.\n\n(iii) \n\nEntry barriers to markets\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 6, page 3\n\n(iv) \n\nClosed sectors and their costs\n\n(a)  The costs of closing the ocean for business\n\n(b)  The cost of closing the air for business\n\n(c)  Education as a business\n\n(v) \n\nLand titling\u2013registering and transferring titles\u2013as an impediment to business\n\n6.\nThe  committee  will  initiate  a  competitiveness  exercise  and  development  of  a  business\nroad  map,  i.e.,  detailed  inventory  of  all  processes  that  businesses  have  to  go  through  at\ndifferent  stages  of  their  life  cycle\u2014start-up,  growth,  and  maturity.  The  process  will  include\nvetting  these  procedures  and  more  importantly,  publicizing  them.  The  vetting  process  will  be\ndone with public-private partnership, to get on board those who might oppose reform, and will\ntake place not only in Colombo, but throughout the country to get an idea of any regional effects\non certain processes.\n\nThe  committee  will  be  assisted  domestic  and  international  consultants  in  holding  of\n\n7.\nworkshops, etc.\n\n3.\n\nSecured Transactions Law Reform\n\n(i)\n\nInternational consultants: Lawyers (2 at 3.5 person-months each)\n\n(ii) Domestic consultants:\n\nLawyers (2 at 4 person-months each)\n\n8.\nThe  Project  will  support  the  reform  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  secured  transactions  regime  by\ndrafting secured transactions legislation under advisory technical assistance. This is expected to\nbe undertaken through a grant TA that will make a detailed review of relevant legal issues. The\nlegal  issues  covered  will  include  laws  for  bankruptcy,  parate,  debt  recovery,  use  of  credit\ninformation  bureaus,  etc.  A  suitable  secured  transactions  legal  regime  based  on  such  draft\nlegislation  will  form  the  basis  for  future  development  of  a  modern,  electronic,  secured\ntransactions registry.\n\n4.\n\nPromoting Information Technology (IT)\n\n(i)\n\nInternational consultant:\n\nIT expert (3 person-months)\n\n(ii) Domestic consultant:\n\nIT expert (5 person-months)\n\na. \n\nSME E-Commerce Portal with an Overseas Focus\n\n9.\nSME\u2019s in Sri Lanka require a web portal/e-commerce site to market their products and\nservices. Many SMEs sell small volumes directly to the consumer. Therefore any web portal for\nSMEs  should  have  the  needs  of  these  consumers  in  mind.  The  web  portal/e-commerce  site\nshould provide a mechanism for SMEs to sell directly over the Internet. The preferred method of\npayment  for  goods  on  the  Internet  is  the  credit  card.  There  are  more  of  credit  cards  among\nconsumers overseas than in Sri Lanka. Thus, it would be prudent to focus an SME web site on\nthe overseas market. The Internet provides an inexpensive channel to overseas markets and a\nwell-designed e-commerce portal will expose the SMEs to the world.\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 6, page 4\n\n10.\nThe  objective  is  to  develop  a  web  site  able  to  handle  payments  by  credit  card  for\nconsumer  and  small  business  transactions,  or  by  letters  of  credit  for  orders  of  a  commercial\nscale.  The  web  site  will  offer  SMEs  in  Sri  Lanka  a  high-quality  shop  window  to  display  their\nwares. It should be based on a framework and a methodology that have been tested and proven\nto work. The web site will be managed by a private company under contract to the Government\nof Sri Lanka. The TA will examine the feasibility of adapting existing non-commercial portals to\nthis purpose. Alternatively, a partnership will be sought with an organization that has experience\nin  developing  and  managing  business-to-consumer  and  business-to-business  web  sites.  E-\ncommerce sites in the People\u2019s Republic of China, Thailand, and Viet Nam will be researched in\ndetail to determine the best strategy for implementing such an SME e-commerce portal and the\npracticalities of its operation. The Thai Ministry of Commerce\u2019s e-commerce initiative will also be\nexamined for lessons that may be applicable to Sri Lanka.\n\nb.\n\nPromoting  Business  Development  Service/Business  Information\nService\n\n11.\nThe  aim  of  a  business  development  service  (BDS)  is  to  assist  SMEs  sustain  and\ndevelop their businesses by providing expertise that the SMEs do not ordinarily have access to.\nThe  aim  of  a  business  information  service  (BIS)  is  to  support  the  objectives  of  the  BDS  by\nassisting SMEs with market research, trade promotion, and improving purchasing decisions by\nmaking  the  market  transparent.  One  beneficial  service  that  a  BDS/BIS  can  provide  is  to\nencourage  the  use  of  technology  and  foster  familiarity  with  the  Internet.  To  be  successful,  an\nestablished BDS/BIS model must:\n\n(i) \n\nprovide services that SMEs require,\n\n(ii) \n\nbe sustainable, and\n\n(iii) \n\nbe replicable.\n\n12.\nThe  grant  will  assist  a  provider  of  information  services  to  SMEs,  demonstrating  a\ndemand-based  business  model  forming  a  partnership  with  Sarvodaya,  the  largest  non-\ngovernment organization in Sri Lanka. The aim is to leverage the infrastructure Sarvodaya has\ninstalled  for  telecenters  aimed  at  improving  IT  awareness  and  information  throughout  the\ncountry. The telecenters are a viable concept and earn revenue for Sarvodaya through the sale\nof  a  variety  of  services  provided  at  the  sites.  The  location  of  a  BDS/BIS  on  its  premises  will\nallow  Sarvodaya  to  expand  the  range  of  services  it  can  offer  beyond  the  microenterprises  it\ncurrently serves. More walk-in business can be expected from a Sarvodaya-based location than\none located at, say, a chamber of commerce, which may seem relatively unapproachable to the\nowner  of  an  average  SME.  Sarvodaya  can  also  offer  the  prospect  that  the  BDS  will  obtain  a\nsteady  inflow  of  business  for  office-related  services  that  will  cover  operating  costs  (over  and\nabove whatever use the SMEs gain from the BDS/BIS).\n\nKurunegala,  a  rapidly  growing  commercial  town,  may  be  a  suitable  location  for  such  a\n13.\nBDS/BIS  combination.  It  may  also  be  possible  to  incorporate  a  number  of  the  features\ndiscussed  above  into  a  support  office  for  the  Dambulla  Dedicated  Economic  Center.  If\nsuccessful at one site, the enterprise can be replicated through Sarvodaya\u2019s national network.\n\nFunding will be provided for the purchase of computers, software, and a photocopier and\n\n14.\na portion of operational expenses.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 6, page 5\n\nc.\n\nMinistry of Trade and Industry and SME Policy Unit\n\n15.\nThe  ministry  and  the  unit  will  be  assisted  in  developing  a  web  site  for  SME-related\ninformation  and  with  processes  for  business  registration:  how  to  set  up  a  business,  how  to\narrange insurance, related regulations, and documentation. The grant will cover the initial costs\nof web site development, and hosting and maintenance costs of the site.\n\nB.\n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\n16.\nThe  TA  cost  is  estimated  at  $1,580,000  equivalent,  comprising  $865,000  in  foreign\nexchange and $715,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will provide $1,250,000 to cover the\nforeign exchange costs of $865,000 and $385,000 equivalent of the local currency component.\nThe TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the\nGovernment of Japan. The balance in local currency cost in the amount of $330,000 equivalent\nwill  be  financed  by  the  Government.  The  Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry  will  be  the  Executing\nAgency.

One drawback to this direct approach is that it has no significant\nreach.  A  typical  project  staff  consists  of  a  few  professionals  who  can  directly  reach  a  limited\nnumber of SMEs. A second, more detrimental aspect of the direct approach is that it tends to\nundercut  the  emergence  of  a  local  BDS  industry.  The  development  of  an  indigenous  BDS\nindustry permits permanency and reach that no time-bound project can attain.\n\n6.\nThe  SMESDP  design  purposely  includes  three  critical  factors  that  will  enable  SMEs  to\ngrow:  appropriate  enabling  environment,  access  to  necessary  capital,  and  provision  of  BDS.\nThe integrated model to SME development seeks to amend the provision of credit financing with\na  strong  BDS  provider  market  as  a  means  of  stimulating  SME  development.  This  will  be\nachieved  via  the  BSSF,  which  will  complement  the  policy  and  regulatory  and  SME  finance\ncomponents of the SMESDP loan.\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 7, page 4\n\n2.\n\nObjective\n\n7.\nThe BSSF will provide sustainable funding for business development activities directed\nat the SME sector. Rather than becoming a BDS in its own right, the BSSF will be used to build\nthe  capacity  of  the  local  private  sector  BDS  providers.  The  BSSF  will  be  used  to  purchase\nbusiness  training,  and  advisory  and  monitoring  activities  from  accredited  business  service\nproviders working closely with the target groups, in support of other project components.\n\nThe  BSSF  will  seek  to  increase  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  BDS  market  to\n8.\nidentify  and  respond  to  SME  service  demands  by  stimulating  new  ideas  and  assisting  BDS\nproviders and facilitators in formulating product services that make sense, respond to concrete\nneeds, and contribute to SME growth.\n\n9.\nIn attempting to address the problems confronting SMEs, the BSSF will seek to expand\nthe  circle  of  BDS  providers  beyond  the  common  government  agencies  and  nongovernment\norganizations  typically  thought  of  in  Sri  Lanka,  i.e.,  Industrial  Development  Board,  Export\nDevelopment  Board,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Development,  Sri  Lanka  Business\nDevelopment  Center,  SEEDS,  ITMIN, and one or two others. The BSSF will also redefine the\ncommonly held notion that BDS means only business planning and training.\n\n3.\n\nScope of Activities and Services\n\n10.\nThe  BSSF  defines  BDS  as  any  type  of  nonloan  service  that  seeks  to  improve  SME\nperformance, access to markets, and competitiveness. The range of BDS as defined is broader\nthan  planning  and  training  and  can  include  marketing  and  advertising,  market  information,\nmarket  research,  product  development,  personnel  training,  corporate  secretarial,  computer\nservices  and \ntechnology,  engineering,  organizational  restructuring,  process\nengineering,  business  diagnostic,  legal  counseling,  brokering,  vocational  training,  and  many\nothers.  To  be  considered  a  BDS,  a  service  must  be  geared  toward  SMEs  and  relevant  to\ncompany growth.\n\ninformation \n\n11. With  such  a  broad  definition,  new  categories  of  BDS  providers  are  created.  In  this\nrespect,  the  BSSF  will  actively  seek  to  bring  into  the  BDS  market  untapped  or  infrequently\nconsidered  providers,  e.g.,  The  Training  Partnership,  Survey  Research  Lanka  Ltd.,\nBusinesscontact  Ltd.,  TEAMS,  Informatics,  DMS  Software  Engineering  Ltd.,  SSP  Corporate\nServices Ltd., Marketing and Research Services, KOMPASS, and other private, for-profit BDS\nproviders that have proven quality service products. Some of these firms do not actively target\nthe  SME  clientele,  while  for  others  SMEs  are  but  a  small  percentage  of  total  business.  By\npromoting awareness among SMEs of BDS providers, offering demand-side incentives such as\nvouchers and supply-side activities, e.g., service development matching grants, the BSSF can\nbring new entrants into the BDS market (a tentative schedule of BSSF activities is in Figure A7).\n\n12.\n\nBSSF services can include the following:\n\n(i) \n\nA voucher program through which SMEs receive a coupon for partial payment of\nan  approved  business  service.  Through  the  voucher,  SMEs  that  may  not\nnormally  think  of  a  BDS  or  consider  it  affordable  can  test  the  services  at  an\naffordable cost.\n\n(ii) \n\nA  matching  grant  program  that  targets  BDS  providers  who  are  seeking\nassistance  to  right-size  an  existing  service  or  develop  a  new  one  for  SMEs.\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 7, page 5\n\nThrough the matching grant, the BSSF will contribute up to perhaps 50 percent\nof the costs of such service product development work.\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nTraining-of-trainer programs to uplift the skills of BDS providers so they can offer\nquality services to SME clients.\n\nNeeds assessments to identify SME requirements with respect to BDS so as to\nbetter inform the service providers.\n\nMarketing  campaigns  to  inform  and  educate  SMEs  regarding  the  value  that\noutside expert services can add to the company.\n\nEnhancement of BDS facilitator capacity so that such entities can better perform\ntheir role as brokers of BDS on behalf of members.\n\n4.\n\nFunding Base and Cost Estimates\n\n13.\nThe BSSF will be financed with a $6 million loan from ADB, which will be utilized over\nthree years, and with counterpart contribution by the Government of Sri Lanka. The BSSF will\naccept  contributions  from  other  funding  agencies  and  the  private  sector.  Preliminary  cost\nestimates are Table A7.\n\n5.\n\nBSSF Structure\n\nThe  BSSF  funding  will  be  held  in  an  imprest  account  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and\n14.\nPlanning, the Executing Agency. The BSSF will be managed through the PMU, which will report\nto  the  PSC.  Details  of  the  BSSF  operations  will  be  documented  in  a  memorandum  of\nunderstanding between the EA and the PMU, which will be drafted and executed in a manner\nacceptable to ADB.\n\n15.\nBSSF  staff  will  be  part  of  the  PMU  and  will  include  two  technical  professionals  (one\nexpatriate  and  one  local),  an  office  manager,  and  a  grants  manager.  Other  short-term\nconsultants may be engaged as necessary to support BSSF operations.\n\n16.\nThe  PMU  will  provide  administration  support  to  the  BSSF  in  a  manner  acceptable  to\nADB.  Administration  will  consist  of  maintaining  the  books  of  account,  maintaining  the  bank\nincome,\naccounts,  evaluating  and  summarizing  proposals \nnegotiating  contracts,  making  payments,  preparing  financial  and  other  operational  statements,\netc.\n\nfor  consideration,  receiving \n\nThe PMU will monitor the activities of BDS providers contracted to deliver services,  with\n17.\nsummary  reports  submitted  to  the  PSC  on  a  quarterly  basis.  Progress  reports  by  the\nparticipating institutions will form part of the contract agreed to by the parties.\n\n6.\n\nAudit\n\n18.\nIt is proposed that a reputable auditing company, located in Sri Lanka, audit the BSSF\non an annual basis. The major responsibilities of the auditors will include confirmation that the\ninvestments  are  held  in  the  designated  bank  account,  all  income  has  been  received,  all\npayments have been properly authorized and recorded, bank accounts have been verified, and\nfinancial information presented to the subcommittee is accurate.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 7, page 6\n\n7. \n\nTerms of Reference of BSSF Staff\n\na. \n\nExecutive Director\n\n19.\n\nThe Executive director will\n\nprovide technical and managerial oversight of the BSSF\u2019s activities and staff;\nbe  responsible  for  project  results,  budget  management,  supervision  of  the\npermanent and intermittent staff;\nprovide input to the SME Policy Unit\u2019s discussions;\ncoordinate relations with BDS providers and facilitators (associations, chambers\nof  commerce,  other  aid-funded  projects)  alike,  as  well  as  with  the  relevant\nentities within the Government;\nform partnerships with business service organizations and other BDS facilitators\nto carry out activities in conjunction with the BSSF to stimulate and expand the\nBDS market;\ndevelop a framework for BSSFimplementation to ensure synergy between all of\nits activities;\ndevelop the annual work plan (one with budget, milestones, and benchmarks), as\nwell  as  monitor  and  report  on  BSSF  performance  objectives,  overseeing  the\ndevelopment of database of activities;\nprovide technical guidance and input for the BSSF\u2019s various activities; and\ndevelop terms of reference for intermittent technical assistance as needed.\n\nan advanced degree in business administration or related field;\nminimum  of  15  years  relevant  experience  in  the  SME  sector  of  developing\ncountries  including  expertise  in  business  development  and  market  linkages,\nenhancement of SME-level competitiveness, BDS capacity building and product\nquality  improvement,  training,  grants  management,  and  the  evaluation  and\nanalysis of constraints to SME development;\nexpertise  in  at  least  one  of  these  business  disciplines:  marketing,  business\nplanning  and  financial  management,  operations,  accounting,  and  business\napplications of information technology; and\nproven leadership capabilities, excellent interpersonal communication skills, and\ndemonstrated  ability  to  operate  in  a  cooperative,  diplomatic  manner  while\nworking with multiple institutions.\n\nb.\n\nBusiness Development Services Specialist\n\n20.\n\nThe executive director will have\n\nThe  BDS  specialist  will  report  to  the  executive  director  and  will  be  responsible  for\n\n21.\nimplementing activities with partner BDS providers and facilitators, such as\n\ntraining of trainers in modern interactive training methodology;\n\ndeveloping  a  certification  system  for  BDS  providers  trained  through  BSSF\nprograms;\ndeveloping and adapting improved consulting products and approaches;\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n(ix) \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 7, page 7\n\n(iv) \n\ntraining of professional and business associations in how to identify and respond\nto  the  BDS  needs  of  their  members,  e.g.,  how  to  generate  and  disseminate\nrelevant information to members; and networking with stakeholders; and\n\n(v) \n\ncommunicating and building awareness of project among beneficiary groups.\n\n22.\n\nThe BDS specialist will\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\norganize  and  manage  the  development  of  innovative  consulting  and  training\nproducts through the use of domestic and international consultants; and\nwork  closely  with  the  grants  fund  manager  to  develop  the  voucher  and\ncompetitive grant components.

Colombo  branch.  Headquartered  in  Colombo,  CBC  is  a  full-service  bank\nproviding  a  wide  variety  of  commercial  and  consumer  banking  services  in  Colombo  and\nthroughout Sri Lanka. Although CBC has more than 5,000 ordinary and nonvoting shareholders,\nownership control is concentrated in the two largest shareholders. The four largest shareholders\nat  end-2000  were  DFCC  (29.77  percent),  Sri  Lanka  Insurance  Corporation  (29.72  percent),\nDistilleries Company of Sri Lanka (2.3 percent), and Ceylon Petroleum (1.92 percent). CBC is\nlisted on the Ceylon Stock Exchange (CSE).\n\n2. \n\nOrganization, Management, and Personnel\n\n2.\nCBC has a board of directors comprising 8 prominent Sri Lankan bankers and business\npeople,  and  a  strong  group  of  28  corporate  and  senior  bank  managers  having  extensive\nexperience  in  commercial  banking.  CBC  has  been  steadily  developing  a  national  branch\nnetwork, which comprises 87 branches today, up from 39 in 1996.\n\n3.\nA  growing  banking  staff  services  the  bank  and  branch  network.  CBC  has  2,067\nemployees,  up  from  1,837  in  1996,  a  12.5  percent  increase.  Bank  executives  have  increased\nmore  sharply  from  236  in  1996  to  564  in  2000  (138  percent  increase),  reflecting  the  need  for\nexperienced  management  for  maintaining  profitability  during  high  growth  periods.  CBC  staff\nhave been thoroughly trained in the bank\u2019s extensive bank management and employee training\nprogram to perform their banking duties. Bank training is an ongoing employee obligation and\nthe bank requires a minimum of 60 hours annual training to update or expand the staff\u2019s banking\nknowledge  and  skills.  The  in-house  training  program  is  supplemented  with  local  and\ninternational  bank  training  programs  offered  by  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  (CBSL)  and\nprivate bank institutes, as needed, to meet the increasing demands of the jobs.\n\n4.\nCBC  has  improved  its  infrastructure  during  the  last  five  years,  installing  Globus\nmanagement  information  and  loan  accounting  system  to  fully  computerize  and  automate  its\noperations.  Gradually,  the  entire  bank  operations  are  linked  by  computers  from  the  Colombo\nheadquarters to every branch throughout Sri Lanka. Eighty branches have been so linked. The\nbank contends that this improved information technology (IT) system has been a major factor in\nreducing its costs to satisfactory levels.\n\n3. \n\nOperations\n\n5.\nCBC\u2019s  business  has  grown  briskly  but  firmly  since  1997.  Total  assets  have  risen  at  a\nbrisk  16-25  percent  annually  since  1997,  going  from  SLRs25.3  billion  in  1996  and  reaching  a\ntotal  of  SLRs49.6  billion  at  end-2000,  essentially  doubling  the  size  of  the  bank  in  five  years.\nLoan growth has advanced even more sharply with an annual growth rate of 16-35 percent from\na strong base of SLRs13.4 billion at end-1996 to SLRs31.5 billion by end-2000. The bank has\nfunded  this  loan  growth  through  an  equally  growing  depository  base  collected  from  the  public\nthrough the growing branch network. Deposits from customers grew at 19-25 percent annually\nfrom SLRs16.6 billion in 1996 to SLRs37.5 billion at end-2000.\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\n4. \n\nFinancial Performance, Position, and Portfolio Quality\n\n6.\nDespite  this  major  growth,  the  bank  has  maintained  a  strong  focus  on  profitability  and\nkept costs under control during the growth period. Initially CBC\u2019s operating expenses increased\nstrongly, paralleling asset and portfolio growth. Operating expenses rose from 55 percent of net\nincome  in  1996    to  60  percent  in  1999.  But  the  bank  has  managed  to  reduce  operating\nexpenses, reporting a cost-to-income ratio of 54.75 percent for 2000, about the lowest among\nSri  Lankan  commercial  banks.  The  bank  has  managed  to  produce  a  strong  annual  return  on\naverage assets, 1.9-2.05 percent except for the brief dip to 1.72 percent in 1999. In 2000, CBC\nreported  a  pretax  profit  of  SLRs1.1  billion,  representing  a  42  percent  increase  over  the  1999\npretax profit of SLRs809.4 million. While few years are very profitable, CBC has been profitable\nevery year in the last decade with an average income growth of 20 percent over the previous\nyear.\n\n7.\nCBC  reported  nonperforming  loans-to-total  loans  of  8.73  percent  at  end-2000.That  is\nabove the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) bank supervision level of 7 percent at which time a\nbank  is  put  on  watch  notice.  However,  CBC  lowered  this  nonperforming  loan  portfolio\npercentage from 8.95 percent from the previous year-end. CBC had some increase during the\nquarter  from  the  recent  slowdown.  It  is  difficult  to  tell  whether  this  is  a  strong  trend,  or  a\ntemporary problem coinciding with recent domestic violence. The year-end financial statements\nwill probably reveal whether a serious problem is developing in CBC\u2019s loan portfolio.\n\n5. \n\nCapital Adequacy\n\n8.\nCBC strives to maintain a strong and well-capitalized bank at all times. It has maintained\na  total  capital  adequacy  ratio  over  17  percent  since  1996,  dipping  slightly  to  16.62  percent  in\n2000 (Table A10.1). In addition, equity-to-total assets has remained over 10 percent throughout\nthis period. CBC has managed to increase its capital in 1997 through a public share offering of\nSLRs80  million  through  the  CSE.  CBC\u2019s  strong  balance  sheet  has  enabled  the  bank  to  issue\nsenior debt rated by the Fitch Ratings Lanka Ltd as SL AA+, indicating a very low expectation of\ncredit risk.\n\nB.\n\nHatton National Bank\n\n1.\n\nBackground\n\n9.\nHatton  National  Bank  Ltd.  (HNB)  was  established  in  May  1970  after  consolidation  of\nHatton Bank and two branches of the National and Grindlays Bank. The Sri Lanka operations of\nMercantile  Bank  and  the  Emirates  Bank  International  were  acquired  in  1974  and  1989.  Since\n1990,  HNB  has  been  the  largest  private  domestic  commercial  bank  in  Sri  Lanka  in  terms  of\nassets and deposits.\n\n10.\nHNB  is  more  widely  held  than  CBC  with  no  single  shareholder  holding  more  than  16\npercent of the bank\u2019s total share capital. The five largest shareholders are Standard Finance Ltd\n(15.69  percent),  CBD  Exports  Ltd  (7.68  percent),  Milford  Exports  (Ceylon)  Ltd.  (7,68  percent),\nStassen Exports Ltd. (6.66 percent), and Panchalingam Associates Ltd (0.551 percent); with the\nremainder widely held by private institutions and individuals. HNB has 3,594 voting and 11,475\nnonvoting shareholders, and its shares are traded on the CSE.\n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 9, page 3\n\n2. \n\nOrganization, Management and Personnel\n\n11.\nHNB  operates  107  branches  throughout  Sri  Lanka  with  4,021  employees  as  of  end-\n2000. This number represents a 45 percent increase from 1996 and mirrors the relatively rapid\ngrowth  that  HNB  experienced  in  virtually  all  aspects  of  its  business  during  the  last  five  years.\nThe strong increase in its branch network has enabled HNB to gather an increasing volume of\ndeposits from the public. HNB has its own in-house bank training program for fully educating all\npersonnel  on  the  best  practices  in  sound  banking.  The  bank\u2019s  own  program  is  supplemented\nfrom  time  to  time  with  outside  national  courses  from  the  CBSL  and  private  bank  training\ninstitutes as well as international bank training programs.\n\n12.\nHNB also uses the Globus banking software package for information management and\nloan  accounting.  The  bank  is  in  the  process  of  extending  computer  linkages  between  bank\nheadquarters  and  its  branches  and  hopes  to  have  this  completed  within  one  year.  Then  all\nbranch  retail  credit,  trade  finance,  and  treasury  functions  will  be  computer-linked  with  the\nGlobus network.\n\n3. \n\nOperations\n\n13.\nHNB total assets more than doubled during the past five years, from SLRs41.3 billion in\n1996  to  SLRs87.6  billion  for  an  average  annual  asset  growth  of  22  percent.  However,  the\ngrowth  has  been  erratic  ranging  from  37  percent  in  1996-1997,  but  reduced  to  8  percent  in\n1997-1998.  Total  loans  also  rose  rapidly  from  SLRs20.8  billion  in  1996  to  SLRs46.9  billion  in\n2000,  but  more  consistently  with  an  average  annual  growth  rate  of  25  percent  with  fewer\nsignificant swings from year to year from actual annual growth rates. Deposits from customers\nrose  as  did  the  loan  growth,  with  a  big  34  percent  jump  from  1996  to  1997,  but  a  17  percent\nannual  growth  through  2000.  HNB  has  had  a  more  difficult  time  controlling  costs  during  this\nstrong  growth  period.  The  HNB  cost-to-income  ratio  was  65  percent  in  1996  before  rising  to\n69.8 percent in 1999 and 2000. HNB recognizes the importance of lower administrative cost to\nprofitability and is taking measures, including more effective IT usage, to bring this ratio below\n63 percent.\n\n4. \n\nFinancial Performance, Position, and Portfolio Quality\n\n14.\nAs  expected  with  rising  loans,  deposits,  and  operating  costs,  profitability  has  dropped.\nWhile income rose steadily from SLRs4.7 billion at year-end in 1996, to SLRs9.6 billion in 2000\n(Table  A9.1),  net  income  rose  more  slowly  and  erratically  from  SLRs453  million  in  1996  to\nSLRs800 million in 2000. A closer look at profitability indicators reveals that HNB has had some\ndifficulty in managing its growth. Its rate of return on average assets declined from 1.3 percent\nin 1996 to 1.2 percent in the next two years, and finally settled at 1 percent  in 1999 and 2000.\nHNB  recognizes  that  it  must  contain  costs  as  it  expands  its  portfolio,  depository  base,  and\nbranch network. Dropping below 1 percent return on average assets is a warning that stronger\nefficiency measures are needed to put the bank\u2019s assets to work more profitably.\n\n5. \n\nCapital Adequacy, Liquidity, and Equity\n\n15.\nHNB\u2019s  capital  position  grew  steadily  during  the  past  five  years  through  issuance  of\nshares  to  the  public  and  building  up  of  reserves  with  retained  earnings.  From  a  shareholder\nbase  of  SLRs200  million  in  1996,  HNB  raised  its  paid-in  capital  to  SLRs650  million  or  225\npercent during five years through two share offerings. Total capital grew from SLRs2. 6 billion in\n1996 to SLRs5.5 billion in 2000, an increase of 115 percent. Capital growth has kept pace with\n\n\f75\n\nAppendix 9, page 4\n\nthe  growth  in  loans  and  deposits  to  meet  and  exceed  the  CBSL  capital  adequacy  standards.\nCBSL currently requires 9 percent Tier 1 and 2 capital and HNB had 11.02 percent as of end-\n2000.\n\nHNB  managed  its  market  and  liquidity  risk  using  its  Asset/Liability  Committee  (ALCO)\n16.\nand  the  board  of  directors  to  set  market  risk  exposures.  The  ALCO  established  the  policy\nguidelines that the bank\u2019s treasury operations must follow, with liquidity risk being measured on\na cash-flow basis.  CBSL sets a  liquidity reserve requirement of 20 percent. In practice, banks\nmust  stay  above  this  to  avoid  even  short-term  liquidity  dips  below  the  standard.  At  end-2000,\nHNB  had  a  liquid  assets-to-liabilities  ratio  of  25.1  percent  and  had  maintained  a  ratio  of  23\npercent to 27 percent throughout 1996-2000.\n\nHNB  has  had  some  difficulty  with  nonperforming  loans.  The  economic  slowdown  that\n17.\noccurred in 1997 saw an increase in HNB\u2019s nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans\nfrom 7.32 percent in 1997 to 9.32 percent in 1998. HNB has managed to lower that percentage\nsomewhat during the next two years, reducing the nonperforming loans to 9.01 percent by 2000.\nHNB\u2019s experience reflects the typical problem of time and expense taken to keep nonperforming\nloans, once they are categorized as such, from being loans in default. HNB management has\nreported  a  jump  to  12  percent  nonperforming  loans  during  2001.  This  is  a  major  jump  in\nnonperforming  assets  and  the  bank  is  likely  to  take  a  long  time  to  work  out  these  assets  with\ncollections. This condition will press on the bank\u2019s profitability and its return on average assets.\nThis development should be closely watched and reviewed at year-end to determine whether it\nhas become a significant problem affecting the banks\u2019 long-term profitability, or just a temporary\ncondition.\n\nC.\n\nSampath Bank\n\n \n\n1.\n\nBackground\n\n18.\nSampath  Bank  Ltd.  was  incorporated  as  the  Investment  and  Credit  Bank  in  1987,  with\nan  authorized  capital  of  SLRs500  million  and  paid-up  capital  of  SLRs175  million.  Following  a\npublic  offering  in  May  1987,  it  began  operations.  Sampath  is  one  of  the  most  widely  held\ncommercial banks having more than 16,418 shareholders owning more than 33 million shares.\nNo  one  shareholder  owns  more  than  10  percent  of  the  outstanding  shares.  The  five  largest\nshareholders are National Development Bank (NDB, 8.11 percent), HNB (5 percent), Sampath\nAccount no. 2 (5 percent), Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka (5 percent), and Stassen Exports\nLtd. (5 percent).\n\n \n\n2.\n\nOrganization, Management, and Personnel\n\nSampath is managed by a board of directors of nine members with extensive experience\n19.\nin banking, business, accounting, law, and academia. It has a corporate management team of 9\nprofessionals and an executive management team of 17 professional bank managers, who with\nthe chief executive officer manage bank operations. Sampath operates through a network of 38\nbranches, which had 1,355 employees in 2000. This is an increase from 26 branches and 981\nemployees in 1996, the beginning of the review period.\n\n20.\nLike  other  commercial  banks,  Sampath  also  has  an  in-house  training  program  through\nwhich it trains all its banking staff through a full range of courses giving them a solid grounding\nin  the  basic  best  practices  of  sound  banking.  Every  employee  must  take  at  least  60  hours  of\n\n\f76\n\nAppendix 9, page 5\n\napproved  bank  training  each  year.  These  courses  are  supplemented  with  local  CBSL  and\nprivate banking institute courses and seminars as well as with some international programs.\n\n21.\nSampath has focused on IT systems from its early organization in an effort to maximize\noperational  efficiency.  It  also  uses  its  IT  systems  as  a  management  tool  to  have  updated  and\naccurate information on the quality and performance of its loan portfolio, investments, and other\nassets.\n\n \n\n3.\n\nOperations\n\n22.\nLike other commercial banks, Sampath\u2019s total assets have more than doubled during the\npast  five  years  going  from  SLRs14.9  billion  in  1996  to  SLRs34.6  billion,  with  an  annual  asset\ngrowth ranging from 20 to 26 percent. Total loans also rose rapidly from SLRs9.6 billion in 1996\nto  SLRs46.9  billion  in  2000,  but  more  consistently  with  an  average  annual  growth  rate  of  25\npercent  with  fewer  significant  swings  from  year  to  year  from  actual  annual  growth  rates.\nDeposits from customers rose substantially from SLRs9.6 billion in 1996 to SLRs24.7 billion in\n2000, with annual deposit growth ranging from 20 percent to 33 percent.\n\n23.\nSampath has difficulty in controlling costs during its growth period. From the beginning\nSampath has tried be modern and innovative, introducing new products and services into the Sri\nLanka banking sector. In its early years, Sampath made great strides in reducing cost, bringing\nits high 70.4 percent operating expense-to-income ratio in 1991 down to 49.2 percent in 1995.\nHowever, this was reversed as the same ratio moved from 53.2 percent in 1996 to 65 percent\nby  1999.  In  the  year  2000,  Sampath  started  another  cost  reduction  trend,  bringing  its  cost-to-\nincome ratio down to 63 percent. However, its rising nonperforming loans are likely to make it\ndifficult to achieve further progress in bringing down administrative costs.\n\n \n\n4.\n\nFinancial Performance, Position, and Portfolio Quality\n\n24.\nSampath\u2019s  income  rose  during  the  loan  and  asset  growth  period,  though  at  a  lower\npercentage. Income for end-1996 stood at SLRs1.9 billion growing to SLRs4.2 billion by 2000\n(Table  A10.1).  The  year-to-year  change  in  income  rose  from  13  percent  to  about  35  percent,\nwith an average growth of 21 percent.\n\n25.\nSampath  has  also  had  difficulty  in  maintaining  strong  profitability  primarily  due  to\nincreasing  operating  expenses.  Sampath  experienced  a  strong  2.1  return  on  average  assets\nduring  1996,  but  that  ratio  steadily  declined  from  1.9  in  1997,  to  1.8  in  1998  to  1.2  in  1999.\nSampath  has  managed  to  increase  its  return  on  assets  slightly  to  1.3,  perhaps  stemming  the\ntide in the recent downward trend. However, its increasing nonperforming loans will test whether\nSampath  succeeds  in  further  lowering  operating  costs.  Sampath\u2019s  focus  on  technology  is\ncommendable  in  view  of  how  other  banks  have  been  adopting  this  technology  more  slowly.\nHowever, IT must be used to lower overall costs and generate efficiencies if profitability is to be\nincreased. This is particularly important in SME lending where administrative costs in extending\nand monitoring loans are high and costs in working out nonperforming loans are higher.\n\n26.\nIf  the  rising  level  of  nonperforming  loans  causes  the  return  on  average  assets  to  drop\nbelow 1 percent, that will be a warning that more efficiency measures must be taken to put the\nbank\u2019s assets to work more profitably.\n\n\f77\n\nAppendix 9, page 6\n\n \n\n5.\n\nCapital Adequacy and Liquidity\n\n27.\nFrom its  early organization,  Sampath has tried to maintain a strong capital base for its\nbanking  operations.  From  a  shareholder  base  of  SLRs354.3  million,  it  has  continued  to  build\ncapital to support its growth through retained earnings and a share offering in 1999. Total capital\ngrew  from  SLRs1.2  billion  in  1996  to  SLRs2.3  billion  in  2000,  a  91  percent  increase  for  the\nperiod.  Capital growth has kept pace with the growth in loans and deposits to meet and exceed\nthe CBSL capital adequacy standards. CBSL currently requires a 9 percent Tier 1 and 2 capital\nadequacy  ratio.  During  1996-2000,  Sampath  maintained  a  Tier  I  and  II  capital  adequacy  ratio\nbetween 12 percent and 14 percent. Having done that, Sampath\u2019s capital adequacy percentage\ndropped from 14 percent to about 12 percent at end-2000. This could be a cause for concern if\nthe  trend  continues.  The  existence  of  rising  nonperforming  loans  approaching  15  percent  is\nfurther reason for a cautious and careful review of Sampath\u2019s 2001 annual financial statements\nafter year-end.\n\n28.\nThe  CBSL  liquidity  reserve  requirement  is  20  percent.  In  practice,  banks  must  stay\nabove this to avoid even short-term liquidity dips below this standard. Sampath has maintained\na  liquidity  ratio  very  close  to  the  CBSL  limit.  At  end-1999,  Sampath\u2019s  ratio  of  liquid  assets  to\nliabilities  stood  at  20.27  percent.  By  end-2000,  Sampath\u2019s  liquidity  ratio  had  risen  to  21.16\npercent.\n\n29.\nSampath has also had some difficulty with nonperforming loans. Its nonperforming loans\nrose  following  the  1997  economic  slowdown,  with  the  nonperforming  loan  percentage  of  the\ntotal loan portfolio of 7.6 percent going to 10.8 by end-1998. Along with rapid growth in its loan\nportfolio  came  additional  bad  loans.  During  1999,  Sampath\u2019s  nonperforming  loans  grew  even\nhigher to 17.1 percent. Sampath managed to bring the rate down to 12.9 percent by end- 2000,\nbut it recently crept up again to 14.7 percent. A more detailed review of the type and quality of\nloans that are showing up in the nonperforming category may shed some light on new strategies\nfor improving the bank\u2019s performance. It may be that its aggressive bank pioneering strategies\ninto new products and services has also brought Sampath in contact with many new customers\nthat  have  not  previously  had  bank  loans.  Some  loans  to  new  borrowers,  if  not  carefully\nmanaged  and  aggressively  collected  immediately  upon  default  of  payment,  gradually  become\nloss loans. The key is having the proper credit criteria in analyzing the loans prior to approval\nand an early warning system that gives the first signs of problems.\n\n30.\nSampath is well aware of the nonperforming loan problem and has provisioned general\nand  specific  reserves  against  loss.  At  end-2000,  Sampath  had  a  loan  loss  provision  that\ncovered  31  percent  of  its  nonperforming  loan  portfolio.  Nevertheless,  the  recent  upsurge  in\nmore  nonperforming  loans  suggests  a  review  of  this  problem  at  year-end  to  assess  its\ntemporary or long-term nature. Sampath\u2019s five-year performance suggests that workout of these\nnonperforming loans may take some time and will continue to be pressing down on Sampath\u2019s\nprofitability.\n\nD.\n\nNational Development Bank\n\n \n\n1.\n\nBackground\n\n31.\nThe National Development Bank (NDB) was established as a wholly state owned special\nfinancial institution by an Act of Parliament in 1979. The Government offered 61 percent of its\ncapital to the public for sale in February 1993 and to institutional investors in accordance with\nprivatization  of  the  government\u2019s  controlling  interest.  The  Government  further  reduced  its\n\n\f78\n\nAppendix 9, page 7\n\nownership  interest  in  1997  to  12.2  percent  through  a  convertible  debentures  offering.  An\nadditional 2.56 percent of the Government\u2019s share was transferred to the employee share option\nscheme. NDB is now widely held by approximately 7,000 shareholders and its approximately 54\nmillion  shares  are  traded  on  the  CSE.  The  five  largest  shareholders  include  the  Government\n(Secretary  to  the  Treasury)  (7.33  percent),  BSDT\u2014Investors  Pacific  International  Fund  (6.84\npercent), Bank of Ceylon (6.11 percent), CBSL (4.88 percent), and Hong Kong Shanghai Bank\nCorporation  Int\u2019l  Nominees  (3.71  percent).  NDB  is  regulated  by  CBSL.  CBSL\u2019s  continued\nownership  interest,  probably  a  vestige  of  NDB\u2019s  state-owned  status,  would  appear  to  be  a\nconflict of interest between NDB and its regulator.\n\n32.\nNDB continues to operate under its enabling statute as a public development institution.\nDue to a recent purchase of ABN-AMRO Bank (Sri Lanka) changed to NDB, NDB has long-term\nplans to merge with the NDB Bank and become a universal commercial bank. This process will\nrequire  amending  its  statute  to  permit  the  merger  and  regulatory  approval.  NDB  has  been\npursuing a strategy for becoming a dominant provider of a whole range of financial products and\nservices to its customers, including those offered by commercial banks. A group identified with\nNDB  will  be  supported  through  a  common  IT  platform  and  administration.  Consolidation  with\nNDB is one step in NDB\u2019s long-term strategy.\n\n \n\n2.\n\nOrganization, Management, and Personnel\n\n33.\nNDB  is  managed  by  a  board  of  directors  of  11  members  comprising  of  experienced\nnational  and  international  business  people,  financiers,  and  bankers.  The  ADB  resident\nrepresentative  in  Sri  Lanka,  Mr.  Cooney,  sits  on  the  NDB  board.  The  NDB  managing  director\nand chief executive officer is also an ex officio nonvoting board member.\n\n34.\ntrained\nNDB  has  historically  been  staffed  with  a  high  percentage  of  highly \nprofessionals\u2014engineers, Masters of Business Administration graduates, economists, lawyers,\nand accountants to give hands-on project finance team management to the majority of its past\nlending  activities.  The  total  staff  increased  from  223  in  1996  to  376  in  2000  a  67  percent\nincrease during the period. In addition to project finance, NDB is involved in a number of related\nfinancial  areas,  including  merchant  banking  (share  underwriting,  loan  syndication,  diagnostic\nand  feasibility  studies,  and  financial  advisory  services),  equipment  leasing  and  finance,  and\nworking capital finance.\n\n35.\nLike the commercial banks, NDB trains its staff in-house in all areas of bank operations\nand procedures. NDB employee training is also supplemented with participation in courses and\nseminars conducted by CBSL and private banking institutes.\n\n36.\nNDB purchased software and hardware for a comprehensive IT system to modernize IT\nacross the NDB group. By year-end, NDB and its 11-branch network will be fully automated and\ncomputer-linked to enable information flow throughout the group.\n\n3.\n\nOperations\n\n37.\nLike  the  commercial  banks,  NDB  also  experienced  high  growth  in  total  assets  during\n1996-2000, except in the last year. NDB\u2019s total assets have not quite doubled but increased 92\npercent  during  the  past  five  years  from  SLRs19.9  billion  in  1996  to  SLRs38.3  billion,  with  an\nannual  asset  growth  range  of  19-32  percent  for  the  first  four  years.  Total  assets  grew  by  only\n2.9 percent from 1999 to 2000, reflecting the very modest increase in total loans that year. Total\nloans  and  advances  also  rose  rapidly  during  the  period  except  for  the  flatness  in  2000:  from\n\n\f79\n\nAppendix 9, page 8\n\nSLRs14.7 billion in 1996 doubling to almost SLRs28.5 billion in 1999 before turning flat with a\n14  percent  increase  in  2000  with  SLRs28.59  billion  total  loans  and  advances.  The  decline  in\ndemand was reflected in the drop in loan approvals in both 1999 and 2000. Loan approvals in\n1999  dropped  34  percent  from  1998  and  a  steeper  decline  of  38  percent  occurred  in  2000.\nManagement explains this as related to the bank\u2019s effort to regularize some short-term facilities\nand its desire to curtail new lending in short-term instruments.\n\n38.\nNDB  is  not  a  deposit-taking  institution  but  has  been  funded  by  a  series  of  long-term\ncredit facilities from the Government and multilateral banks. It is a private enterprise, resulting\nfrom the Government\u2019s privatizating all but less than 10 percent of its ownership interest. NDB is\nresponding to the challenge to obtain alternative funding sources and trying to more efficiently\nmanage its current resources to obtain greater profitability.\n\n \n\n4.\n\nFinancial Performance, Position, and Portfolio Quality\n\n39.\nNDB\u2019s  income  rose  along  with  the  asset  and  loan  growth  of  1996-2000,  increasing\nannually  at  12-23  percent.  Income  for  end-1998  stood  at  SLRs2.8  billion  growing  to  SLRs5.2\nbillion by 2000. Profitability has been more illusive for NDB. Profit rose from SLRs707 million in\n1996 to SLRs774 million in 1998, only to decline (4.5 percent) to SLRs739 million in 1999 and\nfurther decline (29 percent) to SLRs519 million in 2000. The NDB decline in profitability during\nthe five-year period is more clearly illustrated  by its declining return on average assets, which\nwent from 3.4 percent in 1996 steadily downward each year\u20143.1 percent in 1997, 2.8 percent\nin  1998,  2.2  percent  in  1999,  and  finally  to  1.4  percent  in  2000.  This  steady  decline  reflects\nNDB\u2019s  change  in  status  to  a  private  enterprise.  The  signals  are  clear  that  it  must  turn  its\nprofitability decline around quickly or its ability to continue to operate as a going concern may be\nin jeopardy.\n\n40.\nNDB  must  quickly  find  alternative  funding  sources  for  its  projects.  It  is  not  clear  that\nentering  the  retail  commercial  banking  world  to  gather  deposits  is  necessarily  the  answer.\nThough  deposit  mobilization  has  experienced  rapid  growth  during  the  last  five  years,  it  is  not\nclear that there are sufficient additional funds from the population that are not already housed in\none or more of the depository gathering institutions. Bidding away deposits from other financial\ninstitutions can be expensive, particularly when NDB is behind in developing a branch network.\n\n41.\nMore  importantly,  NDB  must  resolve  its  declining  loan  approvals  that  have  been  the\nmainstay  of  its  business.  If  that  business  cannot  be  revived,  alternative  intermediation  or  fee-\nearning  opportunities  must  be  developed  and  quickly.  Should  NDB\u2019s  profitability  continue  to\ndecline, it will become increasingly more difficult for the bank to reverse the trend.\n\n \n\n5.\n\nCapital Adequacy, Liquidity, and Equity\n\n42.\nNDB  was  initially  strongly  capitalized  from  government  sources  and  continued  to  have\nample capital to support its services during its early stages through privatization. From the initial\ncapital  of  SLRs175  million,  NDB  increased  its  capital  to  SLRs358  million  in  1997  through\nconvertible debentures. A further share offering in 2000 raised NDB\u2019s paid-in capital to SLRs538\nmillion  (Table  A9.2).  From  this  shareholder  base,  NDB  has  developed  the  bulk  of  its  capital\nresources  to  support  its  loan  and  asset  growth  through  retained  earnings.  Total  capital  has\ngrown from SLRs4.1 billion in 1996 to SLRs5.78 billion in 2000, or a 41 percent increase for the\nperiod.  Throughout  the  period,  NDB  reported  a  strong  capital  adequacy  position,  more  than\nmeeting the CBSL capital adequacy standards. During 1996-2000, NDB maintained a Tier I and\nII  capital  adequacy  ratio  between  21  period  and  13  period,  substantially  above  the  CBSL\n\n\f80\n\nAppendix 9, page 9\n\nstandard.  The  downward  trend  is  somewhat  problematic  and  needs  serious  attention.  The\ndecline simply confirms the other downward trends in NDB\u2019s business that must be addressed\nbefore capital levels go substantially lower and more difficult to correct.\n\nNDB also has substantial nonperforming loans during the past two years. Although the\n43.\npercentage  of  nonperforming  loans  is  declining,  it  is  still  high  and  must  be  redressed  soon  in\nface  of  the  bank\u2019s  generally  declining  profitability  trend.  More  information  on  the  amount  and\ncharacter  of  the  nonperforming  loans  at  year-end  is  needed  to  determine  whether  there  is\nfurther deterioration in the bank\u2019s portfolio or condition.\n\nE.\n\nDFCC BANK\n\n1. \n\nBackground\n\n44.\nDFCC  was  established  by  an  Act  of  Parliament  in  1955  as  a  public  limited-liability\ncompany to provide financial assistance principally to the private industry and service sectors of\nSri  Lanka.  Operations  began  in  May  1956.  Through  the  Bank  of  Ceylon  and  Sri  Lanka\nInsurance  Corporation\u2014Life  Fund,  the  Government  owns  17.65  percent  of  DFCC,  with  the\nremainder held by the public and institutional investors with a total of 7,419 shareholders. The\nfive  largest  DFCC  shareholders  are  Bank  of  Ceylon  (15  percent),  HNB  (9.15  percent),  DEG\n(7.84  percent),  Readywear  Industries  Ltd.  (7.62  percent),  and  Boston  Safe  Deposit  Trust\u2014\nInvestor Global Fund (6.09 percent).\n\n45.\nDFCC  continues  to  operate  under  its  enabling  statute  as  a  public  development\ninstitution. It has been in discussing with CBC a potential consolidation or merger to enable the\nbroadening  of  DFCC/CBC  into  a  universal  bank.  DFCC  owns  just  under  30  percent  of  CBC.\nCBSL Bank Supervision estimated that this process will require amending its statute to permit\nthe merger and regulatory approval.\n\n2.\n\nOrganization, Management, and Personnel\n\n46.\nDFCC  is  managed  under  the  direction  of  a  board  of  director  comprising  10  members,\nresponsible for formulating policies and procedures under which the chief executive officer and\nan  executive  management  team  of  52  professional  managers  conduct  the  bank\u2019s  operations.\nThe DFCC chief executive officer is also an ex officio nonvoting board member.\n\nDFCC  has  a  network  of  eight  branches  throughout  Sri  Lanka  through  which  regional\n\n47.\noperations are conducted.\n\n3.\n\nOperations\n\n48.\nLike  the  other  banks,  DFCC  also  experienced  high  growth  in  total  assets  during  the\nperiod  1997-2001.1  DFCC\u2019s  total  assets  have  not  grown  as  rapidly  as  those  of  the  other\ninstitutions, however, but increased 69 percent during the past five years, from SLRs17.0 billion\nin 1997 to SLRs25.9 billion in 2001. The growth was erratic-11 percent to 32 percent until 1999\nand  then  remaining  essentially  flat  through  2001.  This  may  reflect  the  changing  in  role  of\ndevelopment  finance  institutions  from  public  institutions  to  private  enterprises.  Total  loans  and\nadvances also rose, but not as rapidly as those of other institutions. DFCC\u2018s loan portfolio grew\n\n                                            \n1  The review period is slightly different due to DFCC\u2019s fiscal year.\n\n\f81\n\nAppendix 9, page 10\n\nfrom SLRs9 billion in 1997 to almost double, with a 93 percent increase to SLRs17.4 billion in\n2001.\n\n49.\nDFCC, like NDB, is not a deposit-taking institution, but was funded by a series of long-\nterm  credit  facilities  from  the  Government  and  multilateral  banks.  Recently,  DFCC  has\nexperienced rising interest rates on its debt obligations, but is unable to raise its loan rates by\nthe  same amount. Its net interest rate margin is tightening and putting  downward pressure on\nearnings.\n\n4. \n\nFinancial Performance, Position, and Portfolio Quality\n\n50.\nDFCC\u2019s income performance has been erratic, rising in 1997 from the previous year by a\nmodest 6.4 percent and again rising in 1998 by 15 percent. Income rose slowly by 7 percent in\n1999 but experienced a larger rise of 17% in 2000 before dropping to 0 percent in 2001. Profit\nwas equally erratic. Experiencing a profit curve similar to that of NDB, DFCC saw its profit rise\nfrom SLRs416 million in 1997 to SLRs672 million in 1999, only to decline to SLRs530 million in\n2000 and further decline (29 percent) to SLRs519 million in 2001.\n\n51.\nThough DFCC has not reported its multiyear volume of nonperforming loans, it said that\nthey were 22 percent of the loan portfolio in 2000 and were down from the previous year. This is\na very high volume  of  nonperforming loans, but is not unusual for a government development\nfinance  company.  The  difficulty  is  that  DFCC  has  become  a  public  company  and  subject  to\nfierce  competition  from  the  private  sector.  Historically,  DFCC  has  taken  the  policy  position  of\ntrying  to  work  with  a  project  until  there  are  no  options  but  to  foreclose  and  liquidate.  This\nexplains,  according  to  management,  the  long  time  that  nonperforming  loans  remain  on  the\nDFCC books before liquidation. DFCC may have to revisit this policy if it is going to improve its\nprofitability,  given  the  erratic  trends  of  the  past  five  years.  DFCC  has  a  strong  capital  position\nand time to review and reconsider its policies and strategies. In any event, nonperforming loans\nat 22 percent are too much of a drag on profitability and should be resolved.\n\n5. \n\nCapital Adequacy, Liquidity, and Equity\n\nDFCC  reports  a  small  but  steady  capital  growth  throughout  the  review  period.  Total\n52.\ncapital rose 16 percent from 1997 to 1998 but only 7-8 percent annually for the remainder of the\nperiod.  Importantly,  DFCC  has  maintained  a  strong  capital  structure  and  these  modest\nincreases still enable DFCC to have a capital adequacy ratio exceeding 25 percent for 2000 and\n2001.\n\n53.\nOn  a  longer  term,  DFCC  just  like  NDB,  must  focus  on  its  profitability.  However,  the\npicture is not so bleak. DFCC reports return on average assets from 2.6 percent in 1997 up to\n3.3 percent in 1998 only to see a decline in the following two years. DFCC recovered in 2001,\nimproving profitability to 2.5 percent. DFCC appears to be very focused on its profitability picture\nand  the  necessary  reductions  in  both  interest  expense  and  operating  expense  to  maintain  its\nbusiness and increase profitability.\n\n\fAttachment A9.1: Summary Performance of Selected Commercial Banks in Sri Lanka\n\nItem\n\nCommercial Bank of

The\n1. \ncommercial cofinancing will be supported by a partial credit guarantee (the Asian Development\nBank  [ADB]  Guarantee).  Technical  work  on  structuring  and  arranging  the  commercial\ncofinancing  and  the  ADB  guarantee  will  begin  subject  to  the  following  conditions:  (i)\ndisbursement  of  a  significant  proportion  (50  percent)  of  the  $60  million  ordinary  capital\nresources  (OCR)  credit  line  to  the  participating  credit  institutions  (PCIs),  and  (ii)  the\nGovernment\u2019s confirmation that it has taken the necessary legal actions to enable it to provide\nthe required guarantee and counterguarantee support to all the PCIs.\n\nIndicative \n\nterms1  and  conditions \n\nthe  proposed  commercial  cofinancing  are\n2. \nsummarized below. The detailed structure and pricing of the cofinancing will be finalized on the\nbasis  of  competitive  proposals  solicited  from  potential  cofinanciers.  The  solicitation  and\nevaluation  of  proposals  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB  policies  relating  to\ncommercial cofinancing and guarantees.\n\nfor \n\nBorrowers\n\nGuarantors\n\nArrangers\n\nLenders\n\nPrincipal\nAmount\n\nSecurity\n\nThe  participating  financial  institutions:  National  Development  Bank  of  Sri\nLanka, DFCC Bank, Commercial Bank of Ceylon, Hatton National Bank,\nand Sampath Bank.\n\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  guarantee  the  repayment  of\nprincipal  under  its  partial  credit  guarantee  (PCG)  scheme  (the  ADB\nguarantee).\n\nThe Government of Sri Lanka will guarantee interest payments.\n\n[To  be  determined]  [The  Facility  will  be  fully  underwritten  by  the\nArrangers]\n\nA  group  of  international  financial  institutions  to  be  put  together  by  the\nArrangers.\n\n[$90] million.\n\nThe  Guarantors  will  provide  guarantees  on  the  principal  (the  ADB\nguarantee) and interest (the Government guarantee).\n\nCurrency\n\nUS dollars and/or Japanese yen\n\nFinal Maturity\n\nTen (10) years from the drawdown date of the facility amount\n\nPrincipal\nRepayment\n\nAt final maturity\n\n                                            \n1  The  terms  and  conditions  shown  here  are  indicative  and  will  be  finalized  based  on  a  competitive  evaluation  of\n\noffers from prospective cofinanciers.\n\n\f85\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nPayable semiannually in arrears\n\n[To be determined]\n\n[To be determined]\n\nInterest\nPayment\n\nMargin\n\nFees\n\nCost and\nExpenses\n\nGoverning\nLaw\n\nOn the account of the Borrowers, limited to a maximum of [US$ ______ ]\n(\u201cCap\u201d).\n\n[ To be determined ]\n\n3. \nTable  A10  summarizes  the  estimated  guarantee  fees  associated  with  the  ADB\nguarantee.

This latter factor has\nsharply  constrained  the  value  of  impact  assessments  globally,  and  has  been  recognized  as\nsuch by the International Financial Institutions Working Group on SMEs. The Small and Medium\nEnterprise  Sector  Development  Program  (SMESDP)  addresses  this  issue  by  building  in  a\ncomprehensive  set  of  socioeconomic  indicators  to  be  collected  in  a  computerized  format  by\nPCIs at subloan approval stage.  This will provide a unique basis for carrying out post evaluation\nof the project\u2019s impact.\n\nA.\n\nEstimate of Job Creation\n\n2.\nThe coefficient  of 553 jobs per $1 million of loans estimated from earlier SME projects\nfinanced  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  Sri  Lanka  was  adjusted  downward  by  20\npercent to reflect the higher loan size under SMESDP to obtain an estimate of 447 jobs per $1\nmillion of loans (rounded to 450 jobs). Since the project proposes to disburse altogether $150\nmillion in credit assistance, the estimated total new employment created is about 62,000.\n\n3.\nThis estimate should, however, be treated as a gross estimate. A separate World Bank\nassessment of its projects in Sri Lanka found that nearly 40 percent of the borrowers go out of\nbusiness  within  eight  years  of  receiving  loans  (consistent  with  figures  from  developed\neconomies). To that extent, a part of the new job creation is temporary in nature. By applying\nthe figure of 40 percent as the extent of temporary job creation, the net employment generated\nunder SMESDP is predicted to be 40,000.\n\nB.\n\nThe Impact of SME Development on Open Unemployment\n\n4.\nIn  view  of  the  capacity  of  SMEs  to  create  jobs  at  a  relatively  low  cost,  any  program  of\nSME development would be expected to help relieve the unemployment problem under normal\ncircumstances. In Sri Lanka, however, the factors that tend to render the rate of unemployment\nhigh  and  resilient  are  also  the  factors  that  are  likely  to  dampen  the  unemployment-reducing\neffect of job creation through SMEs.\n\nUnemployment  is  high  because  a  large  number  of  educated  young  people  search  for\n5.\njobs over an extended time, waiting for \u201cappropriate\u201d jobs. These people tend to seek salaried\n\u201csecure  jobs,\u201d  primarily  in  the  public  sector.  It  is  unlikely  that  large  numbers  of  these\nunemployed  will  want  to  be  become  entrepreneurs,  at  least  initially.  This  is  not  to  say  that\neducated  people  do  not  become  SME  entrepreneurs  or  that  the  SME  entrepreneurs  are  not\neducated. As  many  as 85 percent  of  SME entrepreneurs have at least high school education.\nHowever,  the  majority  of  entrepreneurs  (78  percent)  came  from  families  that  had  a  business\nbackground. These findings suggest that, generally speaking, educated young people are more\nlikely to set up SMEs if there is a family tradition of doing so.\n\n6.\nWhile  there  is  still  stress  on  secure  public  sector  jobs  among  the  educated,  an\nexamination  of  the  Sri  Lankan  experience  during  the  postliberalization  period  suggests  that  a\ncultural change has already begun\u2014educated young people are beginning to set up their own\nsmall businesses. The components of the proposed SME project that seek to promote market\ndevelopment by providing business development service (BDS) and information technology (IT)\n\n\f88\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nservices will stimulate this process of transformation. Not only will the educated youth be drawn\nto  entrepreneurial  activities  by  the  presence  of  efficient  service  providers,  they  will  also  be\nincreasingly absorbed in the service-providing establishments themselves.\n\nThe process of cultural change is likely to be slow. With the declining importance of the\n7.\npublic  sector  in  the  Sri  Lankan  economy,  this  sector\u2019s  share  in  total  employment  came  down\nsharply  over  the  1990s.  However,  the  loss  of  public  sector  employees  has  been  offset  almost\nentirely  by  the  gain  of  privates  sector  employees\u2014with  very  little  change  in  the  proportion  of\nself-employed  people  (Table  A11.1).  People  have  swapped  the  security  of  white-collar  public\nsector jobs with the security of white-collar private sector jobs.\n\nTable A11.1: The Structure of Employment in Sri Lanka\nby Employment Status; 1990-2000\n\nYear\n\nPublic Sector\nEmployees\n\nPrivate Sector\nEmployees\n\nEmployers\n\nSelf-\nEmployed\n\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n\n1.8\n2.2\n1.6\n2.0\n2.3\n2.5\n2.3\n2.3\n1.9\n2.0\n2.3\nSource: Central Bank of Sri Lanka, 2000, Table 7.4, p.126.\n\n21.5\n22.9\n20.0\n17.4\n16.4\n15.6\n15.0\n15.1\n14.5\n14.4\n13.6\n\n33.7\n39.5\n40.0\n42.8\n44.3\n44.3\n45.8\n44.3\n41.2\n43.1\n43.2\n\n   \n\n29.2\n25.4\n27.1\n27.4\n27.2\n28.3\n26.8\n28.8\n28.9\n28.3\n27.6\n\nUnpaid\nFamily\nWorkers\n13.8\n10.0\n11.2\n10.4\n9.8\n9.4\n10.0\n9.4\n13.6\n12.2\n13.3\n\nAll\n\n100\n100\n100\n100\n100\n100\n100\n100\n100\n100\n100\n\nIn  addition  to  some  reduction  in  open  unemployment,  considerable  job  creation  is\n8.\nexpected for those already engaged in \u2018low-income activities\u2019 in other sectors. There is evidence\nthat  young  people  who  traditionally  worked  in  low-wage  estate  or  agriculture  sectors  are\nincreasingly eager to work in the factory sector. In other words, the impact is more likely to be\nfelt on underemployment and disguised unemployment.\n\nC.\n\nThe Gender Dimension of Poverty\n\nSubstantial  evidence  indicates  the  absence  of  any  serious  gender  discrimination  in\n9.\nintrahousehold  allocation  of  resources.  To  the  extent  that  the  treatment  of  female  children  is\nindicative  of  the  treatment  of  women  in  general,  it  is  reasonable  to  conclude  that  gender\ndiscrimination  in  the  allocation  of  household  resources  is  not  a  serious  problem  in  Sri  Lanka.\nAccordingly,  there  is  no  reason  to  suspect  that  female  poverty  is  more  serious  than  male\npoverty within the same household.\n\n10.\nHowever, while Sri Lanka has one of the highest gender development index (GDI) in the\ndeveloping  world,  its  gender  empowerment  index  (GEM)  is  slightly  lower  than  the  average  for\ndeveloping countries. In 1994, for instance, Sri Lanka\u2019s GDI was 69 percent compared with 55\npercent for the developing world as a whole, while GEM was 31 percent against the developing\nworld average of 37 percent. The low share of earned income is one of the factors, but not only\none, that keeps GEM low. It also contributes to keeping GDI well below the parity figure of 100\npercent, because the share of earned income is a component of GDI as well. In terms of other\ncomponents of GDI \u2013viz. health and education\u2014Sri Lanka has already achieved near parity. It\n\n\f89\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\n\nis only the component of earned income share that prevents achievement of full gender equality\nin human development.\n\n11.\nTherefore,  any  contribution  that  the  SME  sector  can  make  to  create  income-earning\nopportunities for women will help achieve gender parity in both development and empowerment.\nIf the sector can also absorb more women in administrative/managerial and technical positions,\nthat will also help in improving their empowerment as measured by the GEM index.\n\nFemales are not disadvantaged compared with men in terms of poverty or generally in\n12.\nterms  of  human  deprivation,  but  they  are  clearly  disadvantaged  in  terms  of  employment\nprospects.  It  is  in  this  background  that  the  probable  gender  impact  of  the  proposed  SME\ndevelopment project must be analyzed. The relevant issue then is not so much how the Project\naffects women\u2019s poverty, but rather how it will address women\u2019s disadvantage in the sphere of\nemployment.\n\n13.\nEvidence from the labor force surveys shows that it is the young adult females in the age\ngroup of 15-30 years that are most severely afflicted by the problem of unemployment. These\nare mostly women with high school education. Table A11.2 shows that rates of unemployment\nare highest among those with education levels of 9-10 years of schooling to the A-levels. It is\nthis group of young educated women who will have to be absorbed if the SME sector is to make\nany  significant  contribution  in  addressing  the  problem  of  female  disadvantage  in  the\nemployment sphere.\n\n14.\nUnemployed women with high school education should constitute a rich pool of potential\nentrepreneurs  in  the  small  and  medium-scale  sector.  But  in  reality,  women  entrepreneurs  are\nseriously  underrepresented  in  the  SME  sector.  A  recent  study  found  that  from  1979  to  1995,\nonly 1 percent of the beneficiary firms and 5 percent of nonbeneficiary firms under ADB-World\nBank financed credit lines had women entrepreneurs. These figures are in sharp contrast with\nthe  fact  that  women  represent  as  much  as  18  percent  of  the  self-employed  labor  force  in  the\ncountry.\n\nTable A11.2: Female Unemployment by Education Level, 1995\n\nRate of Unemployment\n\nEducation Level\nNo School\n1-5 Years\n6-8 Year\n\n9-10 Years\nO/Level1\nA/Level2\nDegree\nPostgraduate\nAll\n\nSource: World Bank.\n\n3.28\n7.64\n14.12\n\n28.18\n28.53\n32.44\n3.68\n8.33\n21.64\n\nA  more  recent  survey,  carried  out  during  the  preparatory  stage  of  the  proposed  SME\n15.\ndevelopment  program,  indicates  a  considerably  higher  representation  of  female  entrepreneurs\nin the small and medium industry sector \u2013 nearly 13 percent. The same study also shows that\nwhile the proportion of women and men who used long-term loans was similar, women\u2019s loans\nwere much smaller. On average, the loans taken by women entrepreneurs were just above half\n\n                                                          \n1 High School diploma normally taken at age 16.\n2  High School diploma normally taken at age 18.\n\n\f90\n\nAppendix 11, page 4\n\nthe size of loans taken by men \u2013 SLRs.3.0 million for women, SLRs.5.7 million for men. While\nthe evidence is not conclusive, it suggests that previous lines of credit did not attract as many\nwomen entrepreneurs as they could have.\n\n16. Women will benefit from SME development, not only as entrepreneurs but also as paid\nworkers. Table A11.3 shows the gender distribution of employment by size of industry in 1996.\nWomen account for two thirds of the workforce in medium and large-scale industries, but only\none third in small industries.\n\nTable A11.3: Gender Distribution of Employment, by Size of Industry; 1996\n(%)\n\nGender\n\nSmall\n\nMedium\n\nLarge\n\nMale\nFemale\nAll\nSource: Department of Census and Statistics, unpublished data.\n\n64.5\n33.5\n\n38.1\n61.9\n\n35.4\n64.6\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\n17.\nThese figures suggest that while the smaller end of the SME spectrum may not prove to\nbe a major source of paid employment for women, the upper end of the spectrum might be. In\nthis  regard,  the  gains  made  by  women  are  likely  to  be  the  greater,  as  larger  SMEs  offer  both\nhigher  wages  and  greater  security  of  employment  as  they  have  a  lower  \u201cfailure\u201d  rate  than\nsmaller SMEs.   In addition, women will also benefit as unpaid family workers of SMEs that are\nrun as family enterprises.\n\nThis  will  not  significantly  ameliorate  the  problem  of  open  unemployment  among\n18.\neducated  young  females  because,  for  reasons  discussed  earlier,  they  would  not  generally\naccept  blue-collar  jobs.  But  women  with  less  education  (primary  level  or  less),  who  do  not\nnormally  remain  unemployed  but  tend  to  work  in  low-income  activities,  should  have  no  such\ninhibitions.  As  a  result,  the  SME  project  should  be  able  to  help  alleviate  the  problems  of\nunderemployment  and  disguised  unemployment  among  women,  in  much  the  same  way  as  in\nthe case of men.  In other words, the proposed project is likely to be characterized by gender\nneutrality  in  its  positive  impact  on  the  problems  of  underemployment  and  disguised\nunemployment in Sri Lanka.\n\n19.\nOne  way  in  which  the  project  is  likely  to  have  a  bigger  impact  on  women  than  men  is\nthrough migratory flows, which may mitigate to some extent the effect of the likely concentration\nof  SME  activities  in  Western  Province.  Through  these  flows,  the  poor  of  outlying  districts  and\nprovinces  will  share  in  the  beneficial  effect  of  the  SME  project  even  if  the  immediate  impact\nhappens to be concentrated in a few districts. Women tend to benefit more than men from this\nprocess.  An  analysis  of  the  socioeconomic  profiles  of  migrants,  based  on  the  1994  Labour\nForce Survey, shows that the sex ratio (male-to-female) is lower among migrants than among\nnon-migrants residing in the districts of Colombo and Gampaha, the two most commercialized\nand industrialized districts of the country. This indicates that females migrate more than men in\nsearch  of  employment,  and  as  such  should  benefit  proportionately  more  from  the  creation  of\nemployment opportunities in industry sector in general and the SME sector in particular.\n\n20.\nThe reform of  the  legal  system under the project to enable potential borrowers to offer\nmovable property (including work-in-progress, collectibles, etc.) as collateral is likely to benefit\nwomen proportionately more, also. This would help women borrowers in particular, as they are\nespecially  disadvantaged  in  their  access  to  immovable  property.  But  they  would  need  further\nassistance if they are to break away from the traditional gender stereotyping of occupations.\n\n\f91\n\nAppendix 11, page 5\n\nTABLE A11.4: Poverty Impact Assessment of the SME Development Project\n\nChannel\n\nShort-Term\n\nType of Effect\nLong-Term\n\nLabor Market\n\n\u2022  Small reduction in\n\n\u2022  Reduced overall\n\nNon-Poor\n\nModerate increase in\ndemand for skilled labor\n\nunemployment among\neducated, long-term\nunemployed\n\n\u2022  Greater demand for\nsemiskilled and\nunskilled labor\n\n\u2022 \n\nunemployment, especially\namong unskilled and semi-\nskilled labor\nImproved labor force\nparticipation rates for women\nespecially through impact on\nmigrant laborers\n\n\u2022  Reduced employment gap for\nwomen relative to men\n\u2022  Greater mobility of labor from\nhousehold/informal sector to\nformal sector\nImproved living standards of\nsemiskilled and unskilled\nworkers at poverty margin\nincluding household sector\nworkers\u2019 supplying small and\nmedium enterprises (SMEs)\n\n\u2022 \n\nShort-Term\n\nLong-Term\n\nNon-Poor\n\nGovernance\n\nSmall impact\n\n\u2022  Positive overall from\n\nderegulation and enhanced\ncompetition that lowers\nbusiness costs\n\n\u2022  Positive from reduced\n\ntelephony costs\n\nModerate from reduced\ntelephony costs\n\nPrices\n\nNo effect\n\nFavorable from relative fall in costs\nof access to finance\n\nPositive impact\n\nLimited positive impact\n\n\u2022  Significant benefits through\n\nPositive from improved\naccess to finance, etc.\n\nFunding Facility\nand Capacity\nBuilding for\nSMEs\n\nstable mechanism for helping\nweaker SMEs and first-time\nentrepreneurs strengthen\nbusiness skills and access to\nfinance\n\n\u2022  Stronger linkage with and\nemployment expansion in\nhousehold sector\n\nTotal Net Effect\n(cid:1)  Pro-poor:  better  employment  prospects  for  unskilled  and  semiskilled  workers,  improved  employment  status  for\n\nwomen, removal of impediments to business growth and expansion and hence improved access for poor\n\n(cid:1)  Non-poor: promote pro-market economic policies and improve overall efficiency levels\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 22 November 2001)\n", "Currency Unit\nSLRs1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013\n=\n=\n", "Sri Lanka Rupee/s (SLRe/SLRs)\n$0.0108\nSLRs93.00\n", "Sri  Lanka  moved  from  a  managed  floating  exchange  rate  system  to  a  freely  floating\nexchange rate system on 23 January 2001.
