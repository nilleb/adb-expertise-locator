It is \na  continuation  of  DPSPs  1\u20134.  The  DPSP  series\u2014cofinancing \nthe \nDevelopment  Policy  Loan  (DPL)  series  supported  by  the  World  Bank  and \nthe  Government  of  Japan\u2014is  embedded  in  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-\nTerm  National  Development  Plan  (RPJM)  for  2004\u20132009.  It  supports  the \nRPJM\u2019s  broad  goals  of  stimulating  higher  and  sustainable  economic \ngrowth, with lower levels of unemployment and poverty, in three core areas: \n(i) investment  climate,  (ii)  public  financial  management  and  governance, \nand (iii) poverty alleviation and public service delivery to the poor. DPSP-5 \nis  also  a  single-tranche  operation  based  on  completed  actions \ndemonstrating satisfactory progress. It builds on reforms undertaken during \npast DPSPs and establishes policy actions for possible future operation. \n \nThe primary rationale of DPSP-5 is to reinforce the Government\u2019s efforts to \nimprove  competitiveness,  enhance  public  financial  management  and \ngovernance,  and  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  improved  public \nservice delivery to the poor. In addition, the DPL series aims to harmonize \npolicy  reform  support  from  key  development  partners.  The  involvement  of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  the  DPL  process  effectively  builds \non and deepens reforms supported by ADB through its past, ongoing, and \nplanned  operations  under  the  Indonesia  country  strategy  and  program \n2006\u20132009. \n \nADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  DPL  also  aims  to  improve  aid  effectiveness  by \nreducing  transaction  costs  for  its  developing  member  countries.  The \napproach is consistent with ADB\u2019s reform agenda, as outlined in the long-\ninitiative. \nterm  strategic \nParticipation in the DPL helps implement and fulfill ADB\u2019s obligations to the \nParis  Declaration  on  Aid  Effectiveness  (March  2005)  and  the  Jakarta \nCommitment (2009). \n\nthe  middle-income  country \n\nframework  and \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nImpact and \nOutcome \n\nThe proposed Program will contribute to higher pro-poor economic growth \nsustained over the medium term. The expected outcome of the Program is \nimproved  overall  economic  management  anchored  in  good  governance. \nThe  Program's  outputs,  which  are  expected  to  underpin  the  outcome,  are \nfinancial \n(i)  an \nmanagement  and  governance,  and  (iii)  reduced  poverty  and  improved \npublic service delivery to the poor. \n \n\ninvestment  climate, \n\nimproved  public \n\nimproved \n\n(ii) \n\n \nLoan Amount \nand Terms \n\n \nFinancing Plan  For  DPSP-5,  the  Government  has  requested  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of \n$200 million.  DPSP-5  will  provide  parallel  cofinancing  for  the  World  Bank-\nsupported  sixth  DPL  (DPL-6),  for  which  the  Government  requested  $750 \nmillion.  The  Government  also  intends  to  request  parallel  cofinancing  of \n$100 million from the Government of Japan for DPL-6. \n \nA single-tranche program loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term, including \na  grace  period  of  3  years;  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per \nannum;  conversion  options  that  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  the \ndraft  Loan  Agreement,  the  loan  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  conversion \nguidelines; and such other terms and conditions as are set forth in the draft \nLoan Agreement. \n \nThe  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  a  single  tranche  upon  declaration  of  loan \neffectiveness. \n \n\n \nProgram Period  The  program  implementation  period  for  DPSP-5  is  from  January  to \nDecember  2009.  All  actions  included  in  the  policy  matrix  have  been \nimplemented within the year. DPSP-5 fits within the overall reform agenda \nsupported under the DPLs, which cover the period 2003\u20132009. \n \nCoordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs \n\n \nDisbursement \n\n \nExecuting \nAgency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs \n(excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB \nmember countries, excluding ineligible items and imports financed by other \nbilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements  for  Program  Loans  (1998),  the  loan  proceeds  will  be \ndisbursed  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  as  the  Borrower.  No  supporting \nimport  documentation  will  be  required  if,  during  each  year  when  loan \nproceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  Indonesia\u2019s  total \nimports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \nimports financed under other official development assistance is equal to or \ngreater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during such \nyear. The Government will certify its compliance with this formula with each \nimport  documentation  under  existing \nwithdrawal  request.  Otherwise, \nprocedures will be required. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan \nproceeds and verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n\n\f \n\niii\n\n \nThe  key  benefits  expected  from  the  DPSP  series  are  (i)  progress  toward \nthe Government\u2019s medium-term objectives of macroeconomic stability and \ncreditworthiness,  an  improved  investment  climate,  better  public  financial \nmanagement  and  governance,  reduced  poverty,  and  improved  public \nservice delivery; (ii) raising the profile of key policy issues at the ministerial \nlevel,  accelerating  the  timetable  for  policy  actions  to  be  taken,  addressing \nadministrative  and  bureaucratic  bottlenecks  to  reform,  and  providing  an \nimpetus for decision makers to coordinate further across economic and line \nministries;  (iii)  institutional  development  within  government  institutions; \n(iv) sustained ADB engagement in policy dialogue with the Government on \nthe direction and content of, and strategies for, its economic, structural, and \ninstitutional  reform  agenda\u2014with  DPSP-5  providing  for  policy  continuity \nand  consistency  in  sectors  where  ADB  has  been  actively  involved; \n(v) facilitation,  through  crosscutting  reforms,  of  reforms  in  sectors  where \nADB  is  providing  or  planning  support;  and  (vii)  harmonization  and  parallel \nfinancing  by  the  key  development  partners  (ADB,  the  Government  of \nJapan,  and  the  World  Bank)  around  a  common  policy  framework  and \ndialogue, and the resulting endorsement of the Government\u2019s sound policy \nimplementation and macroeconomic management. \n \nImplementation of the DPSP series is subject to the following risks:  \n(i) \n\nIndonesia  has  weathered \n\nExternal  vulnerabilities. \nthe  global \neconomic  crisis  well,  reflecting  increased  resilience  to  external \nshocks  built  up  before  the  crisis.  Nevertheless,  risks  remain. \nIndonesia  has  an  open  financial  system.  Domestic  residents  can \nswitch  to  foreign  assets  easily  and  foreign  holdings  are  significant, \nespecially in the stock market and in government bonds. Indonesia is \nthus vulnerable to shifts in investor sentiment. If significant funds are \npulled  back  because  of  liquidity  demands  in  the  US  and  elsewhere \nand/or  increased  emerging  market  risk  aversion,  this  could  lead  to \nincreased  pressure  on  domestic  interest  and  exchange  rates.  In \naddition,  the  Government  has  large  gross  financing  needs  over  the \nnext  few  years,  and  tighter  credit  markets  and  increased  risk \naversion  could  limit  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  tap  international \nfinancial markets. This could force the Government to cut budgetary \noutlays  to  maintain  fiscal  balance,  with  adverse  consequences  for \ninfrastructure  investment  and  social  expenditures.  It  could  also \ndistract  the  Government  from  implementing  its  medium-term  reform \nagenda,  including  those  supported  by  the  DPL/DPSP.  Several \nmeasures  taken  over  the  past  year,  including  bilateral  swap \narrangements  with  the  People's  Republic  of  China  and  Japan,  and \nsupport  from  the  Public  Expenditure  Support  Facility  (PESF),  will \nhelp  mitigate \nthe \nDPL/DPSP would also help maintain investor confidence. \nSubsidies. As international oil prices have declined since mid-2008, \ndomestic fuel subsides have also declined. However, a return to high \ninternational  fuel  prices  remains  a  risk,  as  the  recent  increase  in \ninternational  fuel  prices  has  shown.  Fixed  domestic  fuel  prices  and \nthe subsidies they create represent a risk to fiscal sustainability in the \nlonger term. They are also regressive and inefficient, and carry high \n\nthis  risk.  Structural  reforms  supported  by \n\n(ii) \n\n \nProgram \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nRisks and \nSafeguards \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n \n\nopportunity  costs.  The  Government  has  shown  that  it  is  willing  to \nraise  domestic  prices  and  reduce  subsidies\u2014most  recently  in  May \n2008. ADB will continue to engage the Government in this area. \nFiduciary  constraints.  Fiduciary  assessments  undertaken  since \n2001  (as  part  of  the  country  financial  accountability  assessment) \nhave  indicated  considerable  improvements.  Still,  utilization  of  public \nresources  continues  to  be  a  concern.  Ongoing  programs  supported \nby  several  development  partners  provide  significant \ntechnical \nassistance  support  to  strengthen  fiduciary  governance.  By  focusing \non  improving  budget  preparation,  execution,  and  transparency  in \nfinancial  management,  the  DPL/DPSP  will  significantly  enhance \ntransparency. \n\n(iv)  Heightened  security  risks.  Alerts  stemming  from  sectarian  and \nregional  conflicts  and  terrorism  could  slow  foreign  direct  investment \nand  set  back  the  tourism  industry.  The  Government  and  law \nenforcement  authorities  have  taken  a  range  of  measures  aimed  at \nrestoring public and investor confidence. \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n\f1 \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Fifth Development Policy Support Program (DPSP-5). The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC AND SECTOR CONTEXT \n\nA. \n\nMacroeconomic Developments \n\n2. \nIndonesia  has  performed  impressively  since  its  emergence  from  the  Asian  crisis  of \n1997\u20131998.  Prudent  macroeconomic  management  has  resulted  in  moderate  inflation,  low \nbudget  deficits,  a  sharp  decline  in  public  debt-to-gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  ratio,  and  a \nhealthy  external  account.  The  rehabilitation  and  consolidation  of  the  banking  sector  and \nregulatory  reforms  initiated  since  the  crisis  have  buttressed  the  financial  sector.  GDP  growth \nhas exceeded 5% in every quarter since 2005, reaching 6.4% in the third quarter of 2008 before \nsuccumbing to the intensifying global economic crisis. Progressively higher GDP growth has led \nto rising per capita real GDP, boosting the average Indonesian citizen's living standards.  \n \n3. \nThe  foundation  of  macroeconomic  and  political  stability  established  in  the  last  decade, \ncoupled with the economy's high reliance on domestic demand, has helped Indonesia weather \nthe  current  global  economic  crisis.  The  economic  slowdown  came  later  and  has  been  more \nmoderate than in many other countries. GDP growth in the first half of 2009 decelerated to 4.2% \nyear-on-year from 6.1% in 2008, but was higher than in most other countries in Asia. Domestic \ndemand,  led  by  private  and  government  consumption,  was  strong.  Households  recovered \nconfidence  as  real  incomes  were  supported  by  moderating  inflation,  the  final  tranche  of  the \nunconditional  cash  transfer  program,  and,  for  rural  households,  a  good  harvest.  By  contrast, \ninvestment spending slowed further in the first half of 2009, reflecting the growth slowdown and \nunclear prospects for the global economy.  \n \n4. \nInflation  decelerated  to  2.8%  in  September  2009  from  a  peak  of  12.1%  in  September \n2008, reflecting declining food and fuel prices, the lagged effects of the tighter monetary policy \nimplemented  in  2008,  and  slower  economic  growth.  Indonesia\u2019s  external  accounts  have \nimproved in 2009; international reserves rose to $62.3 billion in September from $51.6 billion at \nend-2008. Merchandise exports continued to decline in the first half of 2009 with softer external \ndemand  and  lower  international  commodity  prices.  However,  imports  fell  faster  on  weaker \ndomestic  demand,  especially  investment  demand;  reduced  fuel  imports;  and  a  decline  in \nimported  intermediate  goods  used  in  export  production.  Portfolio  inflows  were  buoyant  in  the \nfirst half of 2009, following large outflows in the fourth quarter of 2008 when uncertainty in global \nfinancial markets peaked and investors' aversion to risk intensified.  \n \n5. \nIndonesia's  banks  proved  resilient  to  the  current  global  crisis,  their  balance  sheets \nhaving  been  rehabilitated  and  strengthened  after  the  1997\u20131998  Asian  crisis.  They  had  little \ndirect exposure to subprime assets when the current crisis hit. Banking indicators suggest good \nhealth overall. The capital-to-assets ratio is about 17%, and ratio of nonperforming loans is less \nthan  4%.  However,  lending  growth  has  slowed  somewhat,  partly  reflecting  lower  demand  for \ncredit with the slowdown in investment.  \n \nThe authorities' response to the worsening global economic environment last year was \n6. \nquick. Among other measures to stabilize the financial system, Bank Indonesia shifted monetary \npolicy away from the anti-inflationary stance of mid-2008 by cutting its reference interest rate by \n\n \n\n\f 2 \n\n300 basis  points  to  6.5%  between  December  2008  and  August  2009.  With  the  economy \nshowing signs of recovery, Bank Indonesia signaled that its August rate cut was likely to be its \nlast,  and  its  focus  has  since  shifted  from  supporting  demand  to  monitoring  the  outlook  for \ninflation in 2010.  \n \n7. \nThe  Government  adopted  a  more  expansionary  fiscal  policy,  including  a  stimulus \npackage equivalent to 1.4% of GDP, in 2009. About 77% of the stimulus package comprised tax \ncuts for low- and middle-income workers, as well as to businesses.1  The remainder consisted \nmainly  of  spending  on  labor-intensive  infrastructure.  The  package  was  designed  to  provide  a \nquick  boost  to  domestic  demand  as  tax  cuts,  and  the  associated  increase  in  disposable \nincomes, especially of lower-income workers, were likely to be spent more quickly than capital \nexpenditures, which are afflicted by slow disbursement.2 The higher deficit, coupled with large \namortization payments on domestic and foreign debt, has increased the Government's financing \nrequirement.  \n \nB. \n\nSector Performance, Issues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Climate \n\nin \n\nthe \n\nforeign \n\nimproving \n\nfor  domestic  and \n\nThe  Government  has  made  significant  progress \n\n \n8. \ninvestment \nenvironment. Notable recent reforms include (i) the passage of the amended Income Tax Law, \n2008, which lowered tax rates, simplifies tax administration and increases legal certainty; (ii) the \npassage of the Tax Administration Law, 2007, which strikes a better balance between the rights \nand obligations of taxpayers and the powers of tax officials, an issue of longstanding concern to \nthe  business  community;  (iii)  the  passage  of  the  law  recognizing  electronic  signatures,  which \nclears the way for multiple e-Government initiatives such as electronic registration and filing of \ntax  returns;  and  (iv)  the  passage  of  an  Investment  Law  in  2007,  providing  a  single  legislative \nframework \ntime  required  a \ncomprehensive investment negative list. Reform of customs administration is also underway. \n \n9. \nRegulatory  reforms  have  improved  the  ease  of  establishing  and  operating  a  business. \nAccording  to  the  Doing  Business  2010  survey,  Indonesia's  rank  in  overall  ease  of  doing \nbusiness  improved  to  122  (out  of  183  economies)  in  2009,  from  129  the  previous  year.3  The \ntime required to set up a business has fallen from 168 days in 2003, to 105 days in 2007, to 60 \ndays  in  2009.  Tax  reform  has  addressed  some  of  the  key  complaints  from  the  business \ncommunity.  Reforms  in  tax  administration  have  halved  the  average  time  required  to  process \nvalue-added  tax  (VAT)  refunds;  in  addition,  more  than  Rp10  trillion  (roughly  $1  billion)  in \noutstanding  VAT  refunds  have  been  settled.  Doing  Business  2010  shows  a  decline  in  the \nnumber of hours required for an SME to pay applicable taxes, from 560 in 2005 to 266 in 2009. \nPartly  as  a  result  of  the  regulatory  reforms,  investment  rates  rose  from  below  20%  of  GDP  in \n2003 to 27.6% in 2008.  \n \n\ninvestment,  which \n\nfirst \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n1   These  tax  cuts  on  income  were  in  addition  to  the  decreases  in  corporate  and  personal  income  tax  under  the \nIncome Tax Law, 2008, which lowered the top marginal tax rate on personal income from 35% to 30%, reduced the \nnumber  of  income  brackets,  and  increased  the  minimum  threshold  for  income  subject  to  tax  by  20%.  It  also \nreduced the corporate tax rate to 28% in 2009, to be further lowered to 25% in 2010.  \n\n2  The low leverage of households in Indonesia means that the increase in disposable incomes is more likely to be \nspent  than  saved.  Also,  the  marginal  propensity  to  consume  of  people  in  the  lower-income  bracket  tends  to  be \nhigher. \n\n3   World Bank. 2009. Doing Business 2010. Washington, DC. \n\n\f3 \n\nIt's important to keep in mind that the recent gains have occurred from a low base, and \n10. \nthat  businesses  in  Indonesia  still  face  an  overall  poor  business  climate  compared  with  other \ncountries.4  The  poor  relative  performance  partly  reflects  the  complex  challenges  Indonesia \nfaces with its recent political transition, geographic dispersion, and decentralized policy-making \nframework,  among  others.  In  part,  it  also  reflects  other  countries'  progress  in  reforming  their \ninvestment climates. Indonesia\u2019s rank in overall ease of doing business in the 2010 World Bank \nsurvey  (122),  for  example,  ranks  lower  compared  with  its  regional  peers\u2014Thailand  (12), \nMalaysia  (23),  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (89),  and  Viet  Nam  (93).  Indonesia  ranked \nparticularly  low  (161)  in  ease  of  starting  a  business.  Although  this  is  a  marked  improvement \nfrom 173 in 2008, and is higher than the Philippines (162), the country ranks substantially lower \nthan Thailand (55) and Malaysia (88).  \n \nSimpler,  more  efficient  procedures  and  lower  costs  for  business  entry  would  stimulate \n11. \nthe  creation  of  new  companies,  foster  competition,  and  facilitate  the  transfer  of  workers  and \ncapital across sectors, especially when economies experience sector-specific shocks. With high \nfixed costs of entry, firms also cannot easily move into expanding industries that are benefiting \nthe most from trade openness. \n \n12. \nAs  global  markets  become  more  integrated,  business  expansion  and  job  creation  are \nmore severely affected by long, costly import and export processes. The delay in exporting by \nan extra day prior to shipping, for example because of cumbersome procedures, is estimated to \nreduce trade volumes by about 1%. For perishable agricultural products the reduction is nearly \n3%.  Streamlining  documentation  requirements,  providing  electronic  filing  of  trade  documents \n(through electronic data interchange systems), and using risk-based inspections are a few key \nmeasures  that  would  reduce  the  time  and  costs  of  importing  and  exporting.  Electronic \ntransmission  of  documents  not  only  speeds  up  the  clearance  of  goods,  but  it  also  often \nimproves  governance.  One  approach  for  speeding  up  trade  is  to  provide  a  single  window  for \nobtaining  different  permits  and  authorizations, \ntime  spent  on \ndocumentation.  \n \n13. \nEffective  implementation  of  investment  climate  reforms  has  been  slowed  by  poor \noordination among  relevant  Government  agencies.  Uncertainty  about  the  legal  framework  and \njudicial  intervention  remains  high.  The  local  level  investment  climate  has  been  of  particular \nconcern  because  of  inconsistent  and  often  arbitrary  regulation  imposed  by  local  governments. \nRecognizing  the  challenges  ahead,  the  Government  has  outlined  a  medium-term  reform \nagenda.5 The Government is placing a high priority on customs and trade facilitation, improving \ntax  administration,  and  continued  reform  of  investment  procedures  and  regulations,  among \nothers.  \n \n\nreducing \n\nthereby \n\nthe \n\n2. \n\nPublic Financial Management and Governance  \n\n \n14. \nThe  public  financial  management  (PFM)  reform  program  has  progressed  significantly \nsince the White Paper on public financial management reforms6 was published in 2002. A series \nof  laws  enacted  in  2003  and  2004\u2014on  state  finance,  treasury,  state  audit,  and  development \nplanning\u2014provided the legal framework for subsequent reforms.

Jakarta: Ministry of Finance, Government of Indonesia. \n\nyears. \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\npreviously  separate  recurrent  and development  budgets  has  been institutionalized  and  budget \ntransparency  has  improved.  A  chart  of  accounts  broadly  consistent  with  the  Government \nFinance  Statistics  (GFS)  Manual  2001  was  introduced  in  2005.  The  Government  Accounting \nStandards  of  2005  are  being  adhered  to.  The  Government  has  also  made  good  progress  in \nensuring  timely  availability  of  annual  financial statements  to  Parliament  and  to  the  public.  The \nimplementation  of  a  treasury  single  account  (TSA),  under  State  Treasury  Law  No.  1/2004,  is \nalmost complete.  \n \nPublic procurement has also witnessed improvements with the establishment in 2007 of \n15. \nan independent agency\u2014LKPP (National Public Procurement Agency), which is responsible for \nplanning and developing strategies, policies and regulations associated with procurement using \npublic  funds.  The  roles  and  responsibilities  of  different  players  in  internal  and  external  audit \ninstitutions  have  been  clarified  with  Government  Regulation  60/2008  on  the  Government\u2019s \ninternal  controls.  The  Financial  and  Development  Supervisory  Board  (BPKP)  has  received  a \nsignificant  increase  in  its  operating  budget  to  fund  an  increase  in  the  number  of  auditors  and \nregional  offices.  Powerful  independent  oversight  and  prosecutorial  institutions  such  as  the \nCorruption Eradication Commission (KPK) and the Anti-Corruption Court have begun to deliver \ntangible results, and parliamentary oversight of budget processes has been strengthened. \n \n16. \nThese  reforms  have  contributed  to  improved  governance  (Table  1).  According  to \nindicators compiled by the World Bank across six dimensions of governance, Indonesia's rank \nimproved for all of them between 1998 and 2008. For political stability and regulatory quality, the \ncountry  temporarily  fell  in  rank  between  1998  and  2004,  reflecting  fundamental  political  and \neconomic changes in the aftermath of the 1997\u20131998 Asian crisis, but by 2008 it had more than \nmade  up  for  the  loss.  Its  progress  in  voice  and  accountability,  government  effectiveness,  and \ncontrol of corruption is particularly impressive. \n \n\nTable 1:   Indonesia: Governance Indicators \n\n  \n \nYear \n2008 \n2004 \n1998 \nNote:  The  numbers  in  the  table  refer  to  percentile  rank.

The 2008 budget included \n\n                                                 \n7   The  June  2008  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  (PEFA)  assessment  noted  that  the  upstream \nsections  of  the  budget  process  have  been  reformed  in  recent  years  and  that  the  budget  is  increasingly  credible, \ntransparent,  and  policy-based.  External  scrutiny  and  audit  has  been  equally  enhanced  but  there  is  still  room  for \nreform. Lower scores are generally in the downstream sections of the budget process. \n\n\f5 \n\nfor the first time a medium-term fiscal framework based on aggregate macro-fiscal forecasts of \nboth revenue and expenditures for 2 subsequent years.  \n \n18. \nInput-based annual budgeting has contributed to problems in budget execution, causing \nexpenditure releases to remain skewed toward the second half of the fiscal year. Some 50% of \ncapital  expenditure  is  disbursed  in  the  last  quarter  of  the  fiscal  year.  This  disrupts  project \nimplementation  and  results  in  under-spending  on  needed  infrastructure  investments.  Detailed \ninput controls make it difficult to alter the budget during execution. Spending warrants (DIPAs) \ncontain excessive amounts of detail, leaving little flexibility for adjustments in the composition of \ninputs needed to carry out a given activity. Reallocations across DIPAs from delayed programs \nto  better  performing  ones  require  lengthy  revisions,  sometimes  involving  parliamentary  review \nand approval. Spending agencies also do not effectively use their authority to reallocate budgets \nbetween  budget  line  items,  either  because  the  authority  has  not  been  clearly  understood  or \nbecause  of  an  inherent  preference  to  pass  on  the  responsibility  to  the  Directorate-General  for \nBudget and Directorate-General for Treasury.  \n \nThe budget needs to be structured along program lines, where the policy priorities can \n19. \nbe  easily  identified,  and  where  the  results  of  the  programs  supported  by  the  budget  can  be \nmonitored  and  assessed.  In  addition,  public  programs  must  be  sustained  over  a  number  of \nyears.  A  strictly  annual  approach  to  budgeting  limits  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  plan  and \nexecute  its  budget  in  a  strategic  way,  in  alignment  with  both  the  Government\u2019s  priorities  and \noverall fiscal sustainability.  \n \n20. \nThe  budget  execution  process  also  suffers  from  fragmented  data,  inaccurate  and \nrudimentary  cash \ndelayed \nmanagement,  and  a  lack  of  information  on  program  execution.  While  a  uniform  chart  of \naccounts exists that is largely consistent with GFS Manual 2001, further strengthening of coding \nof programs, activities, and subactivities is required. The chart of accounts needs to be aligned \nto  performance-based  budgeting  (PBB)  and  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework  (MTEF). \nRefinements to transactions coding are required to capture commitments and payables against \nthe line item in the budget for purposes of controlling and reporting budget execution.  \n \nThe  development  of  a  TSA  to  strengthen  cash  management  was  a  significant \n21. \nachievement,  but  operational  cash  planning  remains  at  an  early  stage  of  development.  Poor \ncash  flow  monitoring  has  perpetuated  year-end  bunching  of  expenditures.  Although  the \ninstitutional  setup  for  procurement  is  being  put  in  place,  the  legal  framework  for  public  sector \nprocurement  needs  to  be  strengthened  by  anchoring  it  in  an  overarching,  consolidated,  and \ncomprehensive national public procurement law.  \n \n22. \nThe  Government  recognizes  that  numerous  challenges  remain  and  that  ensuring  the \ncoherence  of  future  reforms  while  maintaining  momentum  for  reform  is  crucial.  The  medium-\nterm focus of Government reform efforts is on restructuring budgeted programs and introducing \nan  MTEF  and  PBB,  improving  the  chart  of  accounts,  rolling  out  the  TSA,  implementing  an \nintegrated  financial  management  information  system,  passing  a  new  procurement  law,  and \nimproving internal controls and internal and external audit systems. \n \n\nrevenue  and  expenditure \n\nreporting  of  both \n\ntransactions, \n\n3. \n\nPoverty Alleviation and Public Service Delivery \n\n \nThe  poverty  rate,  based  on  the  national  poverty  line, fell to 14.2%  in  March  2009  from \n23. \n15.4%  a  year  earlier, in  spite  of  the  slowdown  in  economic  growth.  This  reflected a  decline  in \nfood and fuel prices, a strong harvest, and the Government's cash transfer programs to the poor \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\nand  the  near-poor.  But,  with  35  million  people  classified  as  poor,  the  poverty  rate  remains \nelevated. Furthermore, nearly 50% of the country's population are near-poor, living on less than \n$2 a day.8 \n \nRegional disparities in poverty also remain.  For example, the poverty rate in Jakarta is \n24. \n4.6%,  in  contrast  to  a  rate  of  more  than  35%  in  Papua.  Services  are  unequally  distributed \nacross regions, with an undersupply of facilities in remote areas of the country, partly reflecting \nan  underinvestment  in  infrastructure.9  Human  development  indicators  lag  behind  in  some \ndimensions\u2014such as the high maternal mortality rate, malnutrition rate, and low transition from \nprimary school to secondary school. Only 55% of 16- to 18-year-olds from the poorest quintile \ncomplete junior secondary school. A quarter of children below the age of five are malnourished \nand  Indonesia\u2019s  maternal  mortality  rate  is  three  times  that  of  Viet  Nam.  Only  15%  of  rural \nhouseholds have access to drinking water from piped or pumped sources, and just 21% have \nseptic tanks for disposal of human waste.  \n \n25. \n Post-decentralization,  about  one-third  of  total  public  expenditures  is  allocated  to  the \ndistrict  level.  Yet  local  governments  have  weak  capacity  to  plan,  budget,  and  execute  public \nspending to improve the delivery of public services. In recent years, this has been reflected in \nincreased surpluses run by local governments. Local governments and local service providers \nneed to substantially improve their capacity to plan, budget, and deliver public services. \n \n26. \nThe  challenges  are  to  build  on  the  foundations  of  macroeconomic  and  social  stability; \nand  accelerate  growth  to  reduce  unemployment,  poverty,  and  overall  levels  of  vulnerability. \nOver  the  past  few  years,  the  Government  has  launched  several  large-scale  programs  to \nalleviate poverty and improve access of marginalized groups to basic services. To insulate the \npoor  from  rising  fuel  prices  in  2005  and  2008,  it  implemented  an  unconditional  cash  transfer \nprogram which reached approximately 19.1 million households. In 2007 it began a 3-year scale-\nup  of  its  flagship  poverty  program\u2014National  Community  Empowerment  Program  (PNPM \nMandiri). Village block grants are now being provided to every subdistrict in Indonesia.  \n \n27. \nBuilding on the unconditional cash transfer program, the Government introduced in 2007 \na  pilot  conditional  cash  transfer  program  for  about  700,000  poor  households.  Funds  are \nprovided  to  poor  families  who  obtain  preventive  basic  health  and  nutrition  services  and  send \ntheir children to school. In addition, the Government has invested in a range of social assistance \nprograms  that  target  the  poor,  such  as  a  subsidized  rice  scheme,  a  school  operational \nassistance program, and a health insurance reform scheme.  \n \n28. \nSuch significant investments in a range of social assistance programs demonstrate that \npoverty  alleviation  remains  one  of  the  Government's  key  development  priorities.  In  addition  to \nallocating  more  resources  to  poverty  alleviation  programs,10  the  Government  will  continue  to \npursue several critical initiatives to enhance the delivery and effectiveness of poverty programs, \nmaximize the impacts of increased funding, and manage the impact of the global financial crisis \non  the  most  vulnerable  segments  of  society.  These  include  (i)  improving  poverty  program \nevaluation and linking results with budget allocation and planning; (ii) introducing procedures to \nbetter  target  the  poor  and  marginalized  groups;  and  (iii)  empowering  local  government, \ncommunities, and service providers to deliver quality services.  \n                                                 \n8   In terms of purchasing power parity. \n9   Infrastructure  investments  fell  from  more  than  6%  of  GDP  before  the  1997\u20131998  Asian  crisis  to  a  low  of  2%  in \n\n2000, before stabilizing at 3% in recent years.  \n\n10  The  average  size  of  the  block  grants  for  the  2,000  poorest  subdistricts  increased  from  Rp1.8  billion  in  2008  to \n\nRp2.6 billion in 2009.  \n\n\f7 \n\nIII. \n\nGOVERNMENT STRATEGY, PROGRAM EVOLUTION AND RESULTS \n\n29. \nThe  Government\u2019s  national  medium-term  development  plan  (RPJM)  aims  to  achieve \npeace and security, justice and democracy while advancing the welfare of the people within the \ntime  frame  of  2004\u20132009.  The  RPJM  is  focused  on  achieving  the  Millennium  Development \nGoals.  It  places  human  development  and  poverty  reduction  at  the  center  of  the  development \nagenda.  \n \nTo  help  implement  the  RPJM  priorities,  several  economic  policy  packages  have  been \n30. \nintroduced  since  2006  that  specify  measures  to  be  achieved  within  a  defined  period.  In  2006, \nthe  Government  issued  three  economic  policy  packages  covering  investment  climate, \ninfrastructure,  and  financial  sector  reform.  In  2007,  a  comprehensive  follow-up  package  was \nissued detailing measures to accelerate development and empower micro-, small, and medium \nenterprises  (MSMEs).  The  latest  package,  introduced  in  May  2008,  builds  on  the  previous \npackages  and  details  reforms  in  the  following  eight  areas:  (i)  investment  climate;  (ii) financial \nsector;  (iii)  energy  security;  (iv)  natural  resources,  environment,  and  agriculture;  (v) small  and \nmedium enterprises (SMEs); (vi) implementation of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN)  commitments;  (vii)  infrastructure;  and  (viii)  labor  policy.  Through  these  policy \npackages,  the  Government  has  demonstrated  its  firm  intent  to  address  several  complex  and \npolitically sensitive issues.  \n \nA. \n\nThe Development Policy Support Program and Government Strategy \n\n31. \nDPSP supports the Development Policy Loan (DPL) series prepared by a joint team of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Government of Indonesia, the Government of Japan, \nand the World Bank.11  The DPL series aims to help the Government achieve its medium-term \ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction  objectives  through  three  core  policy  areas:  (i)  improved \ninvestment  climate,  (ii)  improved  public  financial  management  and  governance,  and  (iii) \nenhanced poverty alleviation and improved delivery  of public services to the poor. Building on \nthe  support  provided  by  DPSP-4  (approved  in  December  2008),  the  proposed  DPSP-5  will \nprovide  parallel  cofinancing  support  to  the  Government  to  help  implement  reforms  under  the \nsixth Development Policy Loan (DPL-6), the sixth in a series of annual, single-tranche loans.  \n \n32. \nThe DPSP series has allowed the Government to work with development partners in a \nflexible manner to implement critical high-level macroeconomic and crosscutting sector reforms \nthat  address  constraints  to  growth  and  poverty  reduction  while  providing  predictability  of \nfinancial support. As such, its coverage is broad. Governance is a recurring theme throughout \nthe DPSP series, as it aims to promote transparency in all of its core policy areas. The proposed \nDPSP-5 is anchored in the ADB Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for Indonesia,12 which in \nturn  provides  for  deeper  sector  interventions  to  complement  the  macroeconomic  and \ngovernance  reforms  supported  through  the  DPSP  series.  DPSP-5  builds  on  past  DPSP \noperations  to  support  the  Government  further  on  key  reform  measures  in  the  core  areas  of \ninvestment  climate,  public  financial  management  and  governance,  and  poverty  alleviation  and \nservice delivery to the poor.  \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB did not provide financial support to the first DPL (DPL-1), which began in 2004, and a different title\u2014DPSP\u2014\nhas been adopted for ADB operations. The correspondence between DPL and DPSP is as follows: DPL-1 = ADB's \nparticipation  through  policy  dialogue;  DPL-2  =  DPSP-1;  DPL-3  =  DPSP-2;  DPL-4  =  DPSP-3;  DPL-5  =  DPSP-4; \nDPL-6 = DPSP-5.  \n\n12 ADB. 2006.

Still, as a sign of its commitment, \nthe  Government  is  pursuing  its  medium-term  agenda  on  broad  structural  and  institutional \nreforms, while implementing measures to mitigate the effects of the global crisis. \n \n34. \nIn  response  to  the  global  crisis,  ADB,  as  well  as  other  development  partners,  have \nassisted  the  Government  on  two  fronts.  First,  ADB  and  other  development  partners  provided \ncontingent financing and support for fiscal stimulus to shore up market confidence and cushion \nthe  impact  of  the  global  crisis  on  economic  growth.  Second,  they  continued  to  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s  medium-term  reform  agenda  through  the  DPL/DPSP  process  and  sector \nprograms.  \n \n35. \nIn  June  2009,  ADB  assisted  the  Government  with  the  Public  Expenditure  Support \nFacility  (PESF)  Program,13  which  is  part  of  a  joint  effort  with  the  Government  of  Australia,  the \nGovernment of Japan, and the World Bank to provide contingent budget financing in the event \nof further instability in credit markets that may result in a shortfall in budget financing. The PESF \nProgram  included  a  series  of  confidence-boosting  policy  measures  aimed  at  sending  a  strong \npositive signal to the  markets, making it more likely that Indonesia would meet its commercial \nmarket  borrowing  targets  for  2009.  These  policy  measures  comprised  actions  to  (i)  reassure \nfinancial markets and maintain financial system stability, (ii) sustain critical public expenditures \nwhile maintaining budget discipline to mitigate the poverty impacts of the growth slowdown, and \n(iii) draw in private investment and support exports.  \n \n36. \nADB  is  also  providing  support  to  the  Government  for  its  countercyclical  spending \nprogram  for  2009  through  the  countercyclical  support  facility.  The  facility  will  help  ensure \npredictability  in  the  Government\u2019s  budget  financing  given  the  need  for  a  temporary  fiscal \nexpansion.  It  will  allow  the  Government  to  stimulate  economic  recovery  in  2009  and  2010, \nprotect  its  social  spending  and  poverty  alleviation  programs,  and  continue  with  its  longer-term \ndevelopment  objectives.  Both  the  PESF  and  the  countercyclical  support  thus  complement  the \nDPL/DPSP series, which focuses on medium-term reforms.  \n \n37. \nAs noted above, support for the RPJM through the DPSP series is a key pillar of ADB\u2019s \nCSP for 2006\u20132009. Under the CSP, a dual-track approach is adopted to ensure that the high-\nlevel  macroeconomic  and  governance  reforms  supported  through  the  policy  dialogue  of  the \nDPL/DPSP  series  complement,  and  are  reinforced  by,  ADB\u2019s  sector  programs.

The participation of (i) ADB and the Government of \nJapan in the World Bank-coordinated DPL series; (ii) the Government of Japan and the World \nBank  in  ADB\u2019s  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program;  and  (iii)  ADB,  the \nGovernment  of  Australia,  the  Government  of  Japan,  and  the  World  Bank  in  the  PESF  have \nhelped reduce the Government\u2019s transaction costs of policy dialogue with some of the country\u2019s \nmost important development partners.  \n \n40.  Moreover, development partner harmonization around the Government\u2019s own programs \nhas bolstered country ownership of the reform process and helped nurture its relationship with \ndevelopment  partners.  ADB\u2019s  active  participation  in  the  policy  discussions  in  all  areas  of  the \nDPL  and  the  parallel  policy  dialogue  on  PESF  and  sector  reforms  have  been  particularly \nappreciated  by  the  Government,  as  these  have  helped  in  setting  the  overall  macroeconomic \nframework for sector reforms, including those supported by ADB. ADB\u2019s engagement in these \npolicy  discussions  and  its  strength  in  the  areas  of  infrastructure,  financial  sector,  and \ndecentralization have helped avoid duplication of effort and improved the monitoring as well as \nthe quality of the DPL/DPSP triggers. \n\nC. \n\nThe Evolution of the Program \n\nThe focus of the DPL/DPSP series has evolved over the years, reflecting changes in the \n41. \ncountry's  needs  and  priorities  (Appendix  2).  At  its  inception  with  DPL-1,  the  emphasis  was  on \nensuring  medium-term  macroeconomic  stability  and  building  the  basic  legal  and  regulatory \nframework for investment as well as public financial management and governance. At that time, \nthe economy was emerging from the 1997\u20131998 Asian crisis, the country was graduating from \nthe  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  program,  and  fundamental  political  changes  were \nculminating  in  the  first  direct  presidential  elections.  The  DPL  was  expected  to  provide  the \nfoundation  for  continued  medium-term  policy  engagement  in  the  areas  of  macroeconomic \nstability,  the  investment  climate,  and  public  financial  management  and  anticorruption.  It  also \nprovided for a flexible means of taking into account the pace and fluidity of the reform process. \nAs the program evolved, the scope of the Government-led reform agenda has been broadened. \nIt  has  also  deepened,  whereby  successive  DPL  operations  have  built  on  previous  ones  to \nensure steady progress in implementation.  \n \n42.  Within  this  context,  the  main  focus  of  DPL-1  was  on  macroeconomic  stability  and \ncreditworthiness,  investment  climate,  and  public  financial  management  and  governance. \nReflecting  the  Government\u2019s  success  in  achieving  macroeconomic  stability  and  attaining  the \nmacroeconomic triggers of the DPL program ahead of time, the Government and development \npartners  agreed  in  early  2006  to  remove  the  macroeconomic  pillar  in  the  proposed  DPL-\n4/DPSP-3, but to continue the policy dialogue on macroeconomic stability. At the same time, the \nincreased fiscal space generated by (i) the reduction in fuel subsidies in 2005, (ii) declining debt \nservice payments, and (iii) increasing revenues opened up opportunities for a greater focus on \npublic service delivery as a new policy area. The DPL/DPSP operations currently focus on three \ncore  policy  areas:  the  investment  climate,  public  financial  management  and  governance,  and \npoverty alleviation and public service delivery.  \n\n\f11 \n\nD. \n\nResults Achieved14 \n\n43. \nPolicy  actions  under  the  macroeconomic  pillar  relating  to  debt  and  fiscal  policy \nmanagement  contributed  considerably  to  lower  levels  of  debt  relative  to  GDP  and  a \nconsiderable increase in non-oil tax revenues. Rating agencies have also cited debt reduction \nand  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  reforms,  including  changes  to  the  Investment  Law, \ncustoms and tax reforms, and fiscal reforms\u2014all activities supported by the DPL/DPSP\u2014as the \nreason  for  recent  sovereign  rating  upgrades.  Policy  actions  supported  under  the  investment \nclimate have led to significant improvements in business start-up times and VAT refund times, \nand  have  led  to  the  establishment  of  a  sounder,  more  sustainable  financial  safety  net. \nDPL/DPSP policy measures have also supported revisions to the Tax Administration Law, 2007, \nthe  implementing  decree  relating  to  tax  audit  procedures,  implementation  decrees  supporting \nthe  Investment  Law,  and  the  gradual  rollout  of  a  national  single  window  (NSW)  with  online \nclearance of merchandise.  \n \n44. \nA  key  achievement  under  the  public  financial  management  pillar  has  been  the \nimplementation  of  the  TSA  to  improve  cash  management  of  public  finances.  The  DPL/DPSP \nprogram has helped move forward reforms to reengineer business processes across the budget \ncycle. The national budget is now compatible with the international standard GFS classification. \nFiscal  reporting  is  more  comprehensive  and  timely,  and  a  medium-term  fiscal  framework  is \ngradually  being  introduced.  Initial  steps  to  address  civil  service  reform  were  taken  under  the \nDPL/DPSP  series,  resulting  in  an  overhaul  of  the  structure  and  remuneration  framework  for \nhigh-ranking  state  officials.  A  task  force  was  set  up  to  examine  the  entire  compensation \npackage with the goal of creating a more transparent, systematic, and coherent framework for \npay  and  allowances  based  on  a  comprehensive  job  evaluation  and  pay  grading.  Building  on \nthis, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has developed a comprehensive civil service reform action \nplan, which is being pilot-tested in other agencies.  \n \nImportant  steps  were  also  established  under  the  DPL/DPSP  series  to  help  lay  the \n45. \ngroundwork for improving poverty targeting of basic services. As the 2005 fuel price hike made \nmore  resources  available  for  social  spending,  the  DPL/DPSP  supported  building  capacity  in \ngovernment institutions to strengthen the evaluation function in order to improve the targeting of \nthese released funds. Lessons from targeting were then incorporated into the new cash transfer \nprogram  that  accompanied  the  May  2008  fuel  price  increase.  DPSP/DPL  has  also  supported \ncritical  actions  to  improve  the  quality  of  public  service  delivery  in  education  and  community-\nbased development. \n\nE. \n\nLessons \n\n46. \nDevelopment  coordination.  The  DPL/DPSP  facility  provided  a  useful  platform  for \ncoordination  of  development  partners'  policies  and  programs.  The  Government  welcomed  the \ndevelopment  of  a  consistent  approach  among  key  development  partners  to  critical  reform \nissues.  Sharing  of  technical  advisory  support,  information,  and  data  also  had  implications  for \ncooperation  in  other  operational  areas,  most  notably  in  programs  to  support  infrastructure \ndevelopment, where ADB took the lead role (Appendix 6). \n \n47. \nCoordination within Government. The negotiations to develop the DPL/DPSP and the \nneed  to  develop  joint  positions  on  policy  issues  necessitated  regular  and  continuous \n\n                                                 \n14  This  section,  and  the  subsequent  section  on  lessons,  is  based  on  the  findings  of  program  completion  reports \n\nundertaken for DPSP-1 in 2008, and for DPSPs 2\u20133 in 2009 (Appendix 3 provides more details on results). \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\ninteragency  consultation  and  coordination  that  may  have  contributed  to  improvements  in  the \npolicy coordination process within and across key agencies of the Government.  \n \n48. \nDesign  and  specification  of  specific  triggers.  Policy  triggers  were  defined  on  the \nbasis  of  mutual  trust  and  understanding  between  the  Government  and  the  three  development \npartners, with a clear understanding of the direction of reforms, without excessive specificity that \nwould create political difficulties or compromise the flexibility of the Government in overcoming \nobstacles to reform.15 This was especially important in areas where the Executing Agency, the \nCoordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (CMEA), or the agencies working most closely with \nit\u2014MOF and the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS)\u2014had no direct control \nover implementation of a particular reform, as other agencies or Parliament were involved. \n \nRole of policy triggers. The triggers comprise part of the Government-owned and led \n49. \nreform program. The choice of triggers was important in guiding both the direction and pace of \nthe  reform  process.  The  inclusion  of  a  trigger  in  the  DPL/DPSP  was  welcomed  by  those \nadvancing  particular  reforms  within  the  Government,  as  this  would  increase  the  profile  of  the \nreform and could help ensure maintenance of the momentum needed to achieve the reform.  \n \n50. \nImportance of continuity in the reform process, building on earlier changes. Some \nreforms  led  to  solid  progress  on  a  reform  objective,  and  the  DPL/DPSP  played  a  clear  role  in \ntheir achievement. In PFM, for example, the DPL/DPSP support for the TSA led to a significant \nimprovement  in  cash  management,  setting  the  stage  for  better  cash  planning.  These  reforms \nare also more sustainable, as the reforms were institutionalized as they progressed, and as the \nparties involved remained engaged in the reform process. \n \n51. \nStrengthening  change  management  capacity  in  the  Government.  The  success  of \nthe DPL/DPSP programs has hinged on the proactive role taken by key counterparts willing to \ntake up difficult change management functions. This has necessitated a strong communications \nstrategy  with  all  concerned  stakeholders.  Assessing  the  potential  gains  and  losses  for  key \nstakeholders, realistically assessing the time frames required to implement specific actions, and \nidentifying potential obstacles, risks, and remedial actions to be taken have all been vital to the \nprocess.  It  was  widely  recognized  in  the  DPL/DPSP  process  that  supporting  the  agencies \nleading  the  reform  process  through  advisory  services  or  technical  support  would  yield  greater \nbenefits  in  terms  of  the  design  and  facilitation  of  future  reforms.  DPL/DPSP  reforms  have \ntended to be most successful in areas where they were complemented by a strong TA program. \n \n\n                                                 \n15 In  keeping  with  the  programmatic  DPL  modality,  which  has  been  characterized  by  medium-term  engagement, \nstrong  country  ownership,  and  continuous  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government,  triggers  are  used  in  a  more \nprocess-oriented  and  flexible  sense  with  less  of  a  focus  on  compliance  with  conditions.  International  experience \nwith  policy-based  lending  and  recent  literature  on  the  subject  suggests  that  a  focus  on  traditional  conditionality \ncould undermine country ownership and the sustainability of the reform process (World Bank. 2005. Conditionality \nRevisited. Washington, DC; ADB. 2007. Special Evaluation Study on Policy-Based Lending: Emerging Practices in \nSupporting Reforms in Developing Member Countries. Manila). \n\n\f13 \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n52. \nThe  DPSP-5  will  contribute  to  higher  pro-poor  economic  growth  that  is  sustained  over \nthe  medium  term.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  Program  will  be  improved  overall  economic \nmanagement  anchored  on  good  governance.  The  Program's  outputs,  which  will  underpin  the \noutcome,  are  (i)  improved  investment  climate,  (ii)  improved  public  financial  management  and \ngovernance, and (iii) enhanced poverty alleviation and public service delivery to the poor.  \n \n53. \nDPSP-5 is in Appendix 5. \n\nThe  development  policy  letter  is  provided  in  Appendix  4,  and  the  policy  matrix  for  the \n\nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\nDPSP-5  is  substantively  a  continuation  of  DPSPs  1\u20134,  the  programmatic  series  of \n54. \nannual  single-tranche  operations  from  2005  to  2008.  It  continues  the  policy  dialogue  on,  and \nsupport  to,  the  Government's  reform  program  in  the  three  core  areas  that  were  the  focus  of \nDPSP-4:  (i)  the  investment  climate,  (ii)  public  financial  management  and  governance,  and \n(iii) enhanced  poverty  alleviation  and  public  service  delivery  to  the  poor.  Improvements  in  the \ninvestment  climate  are  critical  to  accelerating  growth.  Enhanced  public  financial  management \nand governance are essential for increasing the effectiveness of the Government's policies and \nprograms. Improving service delivery to the poor and poverty alleviation efforts are important if \nIndonesia is to bring about more broad-based improvements in welfare for its population.  \n \n55. \nThe  triggers  in  these  three  areas  were  chosen  as  part  of  the  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment during preparation of DPSP-4, and represent a natural progression from those that \nwere  achieved  in  that  program.  The  DPSP-4  program  document  laid  out  12  indicative  policy \ntriggers  across  eight  policy  areas  for  DPSP-5.  Subsequently,  the  Government  and  its \ndevelopment partners agreed to merge the trigger on \"drafting key performance indicators for all \nbudgeted  programs\"  with  another  on  developing  a  revised  program  structure  for  RPJM  2010\u2013\n2014, since the former was an integral part of the latter. Furthermore, the trigger on updating the \nregulation on investment negative list (para. 59) was revised in early 2009 to take into account \nthe drafting of the revised regulation that was included as part of the policy action for the PESF. \nAll of the triggers under the proposed program registered satisfactory progress (Table 2).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\n \n\n \nPolicy Triggers \n\nTrade Facilitation \n\nNSW. \n\nTax Reform \n\nFinancial Sector \n\nTable 2: Status of Triggers for the Fifth Development Policy Support Program \n\nStatus \n\nCore Policy Area I: Improving the Investment Climate \n\nRegulatory Environment for Investment \n\n(i)  Complete interministerial review and convene a ministerial plenary session to review and \n\nAchieved \n\nendorse the draft of a new regulation on the investment negative list that updates sector and \ninvestment restrictions, and clarifies the status of publicly listed companies, foreign equity limits \nfor direct investment, and grandfathering. \n\n(ii) \n\nIssue implementing regulations for the 2007 Investment Law on one-stop shops (PTSPs), \nsimplifying the steps required to set up a domestic or foreign company and the role of the \ncentral Government relative to provincial and local governments in approving or licensing \ndomestic or foreign direct investment. \n\nAchieved \n\n(iii)   Finalize a draft proposal for the operational model and governance structure of the Indonesia \n\nSatisfactory \n\n(iv)  Issue Directorate General (Tax) decree allowing recognition of digital signatures for individual \n\nAchieved \n\ntaxpayer registration and for filing personal income tax returns. \n\n(v)  Issue Directorate General (Tax) decree implementing new simplified standard formats capturing \nkey financial indicators and annual tax returns from all types of businesses, and eliminating the \nneed for taxpayers to submit separate financial statements. \n\nAchieved \n\n(vi)  Issue Ministry of Finance regulation on credit guarantee and re-guarantee companies. \n\nAchieved \n\nCore Policy Area II: Strengthening Public Financial Management and Governance \n\nResults Orientation in the Budget Process \n\n(vii)  Develop a revised program structure for RPJM 2010\u20132014 with measurable results and targets, \ndraft corresponding key performance indicators for all budgeted programs, and finalize requisite \nguidelines and formats. \n\nBudget Execution and Cash Management \n\n(viii) Implement daily sweep of revenue accounts into the TSA for all commercial banks. \n\n(ix)  Sign contract for procurement of new treasury and budget system (SPAN). \n\nAchieved \n\n \n\nAchieved \n\nAchieved \n\nProcurement  \n\n(x)  Prepare a draft revised Presidential Decree No. 80/2003 to accommodate a new set of national \n\nSatisfactory \n\nstandard bidding documents for use by all government agencies. \n\nCore Policy Area III: Enhanced Poverty Alleviation and Improved Delivery of Public Services  \n\nPro-Poor Targeting of Public Programs \n\n(xi)  Continue to use poverty targeting in determining the size of the subdistrict community block \n\nAchieved \n\ngrants under PNPM and increase the average size of the block grant for the poorest \nsubdistricts. \n\nNSW  =  national  single  window,  PNPM  =  Program  Nasional  Pemberdayaan  Masyarakat  (National  Community \nEmpowerment Program), PTSP = Pelayanan Terpadu Satu Pintu (one-stop shop), RPJM = Rencana Pembangunan \nJangka  Menengah  (Medium-Term  National  Development  Plan),  SPAN  =  Sistem  Perbendaharaan  dan  Anggaran \nNegara (state budget and treasury system), TSA = treasury single account. \nSource: Government of Indonesia. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\n1. \n\nCore Policy Area I: Improved Investment Climate \n\n56. \nThe DPSP-5 aims to improve the investment climate further by focusing on reforms to: \nclarify regulations for investors, reduce the cost of complying with the regulations by making the \nprocess of compliance more efficient, improve tax administration, and increase SMEs' access to \nfinance.  \n \n\na. \n\nTrigger 1: Complete interministerial review and convene a ministerial \nplenary session to review and endorse the draft of a new regulation on \nthe investment negative list that updates sector and investment \nrestrictions, and clarifies the status of publicly listed companies, foreign \nequity limits for direct investment, and grandfathering. (current status: \nachieved) \n\nlogistics,  pharmaceuticals,  and \n\nrestrictions  on  ownership  of  companies \n\n \n57. \nBefore the 2007 Investment Law was passed, the investment negative list (DNI) allowed \nsubstantial scope for ministries and agencies to impose ad hoc restrictions. These restrictions \nwere poorly documented; lacked a clear, legal basis; could be applied on a case-by-case basis; \nand  often  contradictory.  The  2007  law  required  the  issuance  of  a  presidential  regulation  on  a \nnew DNI. This new list was more detailed and comprehensive and hence more transparent. But \nit  also  entailed \nin  key  sectors  such  as \ninsurance. \ntelecommunications,  health,  shipping,  ports, \nMoreover,  it  raised  new  issues  with  regard  to  the  treatment  of  publicly  listed  companies,  the \ncreation of restrictions outside the DNI, international commitments, and a grandfathering clause \nfor existing investors. In response to concerns raised by the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce, \nthe  Government  committed  in  2008  to  further  simplify  the  list  and  address  specific \nshortcomings. \n \n58. \nThe original trigger for DPSP-5 called for monitoring and assessing the DNI and issuing \nsupporting regulations. It did not call for a revision of the presidential regulation on the DNI. As a \nprior  action  for  the  PESF,  the  Government  drafted  a  new  revised  presidential  regulation  in \nFebruary  2009  and  discussed  it  with  stakeholders,  including  the  business  community.  The \nGovernment  subsequently  initiated  an  interministerial  review  of  the  draft.  Considering  the \nprogress  made  under  the  PESF,  the  Government  and  the  development  partners  agreed  to \nreplace the original trigger for DPL-6/DPSP-5 with a policy  action calling for completion of the \ninterministerial review and the endorsement of the draft by the ministerial plenary session.  \n \nThe draft was endorsed by a plenary meeting of 20 ministers in July 2009. According to \n59. \nthe  draft,  some  70  business  activities  will  become  less  restrictive  compared  with  the  2007 \nregulation,  while  eight  activities  will  become  more  restrictive.  Investment  regulations  on  59 \nactivities  will  be  clarified.  Ownership  limits  on  about  40  types  of  construction  works  were \nincreased  from  55%  to  67%,  and  construction  consultancy  services  were  moved  from  the  list \nreserved  for  micro-,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  to  the  list  with  an  ownership  limit  of \n55%. Equity limits on a number of tourism activities were increased from 50% to 51%. Among \nthe  activities  that  were  made  more  restrictive,  five  types  of  security  services,  which  were \npreviously  excluded  from  the  DNI,  were  included  in  the  draft  revised  regulation  with  a  49% \nownership  limit  and  a  requirement  to  obtain  a  license  from  the  national  police;  two  were  in \nagriculture and one was in tourism.  \n \nThe draft regulation clarifies that (i) provisions on the DNI will not apply to investments \n60. \nmade before the issuance of the revised regulation; these investments will be governed by their \noriginal  letter  of  approval,  and  (ii)  publicly  listed  companies  are  excluded  from  the  DNI.  The \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\nrevised  regulation  also  incorporates  international  commitments  under  the  ASEAN  Framework \nAgreement  on  Services  for  the  first  time  in  an  investment  negative  list  in  Indonesia.  The  draft \nregulation is now being reviewed by the President\u2019s office. The Government views the DNI as a \ndynamic  list  from  a  medium-term  perspective,  with  the  intent  of  making  it  less  restrictive  and \nsimpler as it is revised. \n \n\nb. \n\nTrigger 2: Issue implementing regulations for the 2007 Investment Law \non one-stop shops (PTSPs), simplifying the steps required to set up a \ndomestic or foreign company and the role of the central Government \nrelative to provincial and local governments in approving or licensing \ndomestic or foreign direct investment. (current status: achieved) \n\n \nThe  2007  Investment  Law  stipulates  issuance  of  a  presidential  regulation  on  one-door \n61. \nintegrated  investment  service,  or  one-stop  shops  (PTSPs).  The  presidential  regulation  on \nPTSPs  was  issued  on  23  June  2009.  The  new  regulation  allows  ministries  and  central \nGovernment agencies to turn over or delegate their authority to issue business licenses to the \nNational  Investment  Coordinating  Board  (BKPM).  It  authorizes  BKPM  to  establish  a  one-stop \nshop for investment licensing as well as an electronic information and licensing service. At the \nlocal government level, the regulation requires that business licensing authority be transferred to \nlocal one-stop shops, and it empowers BKPM to monitor the implementation and performance \nof the local one-stop shops.  \n \n62. \nSince  the  technical  skills  to  assess  license  applications  lie  with  the  ministries  and \nagencies that regulate each sector, the challenge will be to reach agreement on which licenses \ncan  be  transferred  to  BKPM\u2019s  new  one-stop  shop  without  compromising  the  quality  of  the \nlicensing process. Following the issuance of this PTSP regulation, detailed technical regulations \nfor  investment  within  each  sector  will  be  required.  An  online  investment  licensing  system \ntechnical  team  has  been  established  and  a  work  plan  agreed  upon.  The  online  system,  to  be \nmade  accessible  to  the  public  within  3  years,  will  connect  (i)  licenses  already  delegated  to \nBKPM  and  further  delegated  to  subnational  governments;  (ii)  licenses  by  subnational \ngovernments;  and  (iii)  licenses  under  the  authority  of  line  ministries.  A  prerequisite  for  the \nsmooth  functioning  of  the  new  system  will  be  the  mapping  and  subsequent  simplification  of \nexisting business licensing systems and a reduction in the number of licenses required. Going \nforward, the DPL series will continue to support implementation of the PTSPs. \n \n\nc. \n\nTrigger 3: Finalize a draft proposal for the operational model and \ngovernance structure of the Indonesia NSW. (current status: satisfactory) \n\n \n63. \nThe  NSW  for  imports  and  exports  is  the  most  important  trade  facilitation  initiative \nunderway in Indonesia. Under a fully operational single window system, traders (importers and \nexporters)  will  no  longer  be  required  to  apply  individually  to  multiple  government  agencies\u2014\nsuch  as  customs,  the  port  authority,  the  Ministry  of  Trade,  the  Food  and  Drug  Agency,  and \nquarantine\u2014to  clear  cargoes.  A  single  application  is  instead  submitted  using  a  single \nadministrative document and this application is then transmitted to each relevant agency by the \noperator  of  the  single  window.  Approval  is  transmitted  back  to  the  operator  so  that  the  trader \ncommunicates directly with one authority rather than multiple authorities. The Indonesia NSW is \nbeing established in the framework of several ASEAN agreements as an initial step toward an \neventual ASEAN single window for international trade. \n \n64. \nEight  government  agencies  are  currently  implementing  steps  toward  the  Indonesia \nNSW, with  customs as the lead agency, until the operational model and governance structure \n\n\f17 \n\nfor the NSW is established and the operator is selected. The agencies have begun to revamp \ntheir business processes to work toward a single submission and single approval of applications \nby traders.  In December 2008 these processes became mandatory for imports in Tanjung Priok \nand Semarang. During  July 2009 they became mandatory  for imports in Surabaya and a pilot \nhas been launched for exports in the same port.  \n \n65. \nThe  decision  on  the  operational  model  and  the  governance  structure  for  the  Indonesia \nNSW  was  originally  scheduled  for  December  2008.  However,  the  requisite  donor-funded \ntechnical  assistance  came  in  place  only  in  February  2009,  and  the  need  to  refine  further  the \noperational model recommended by experts under the TA has meant that the process has been \ndelayed by about 1 year.  \n \nA draft proposal for the operational model was submitted to the coordinating minister for \n66. \neconomic  affairs  in  August  2009.  This  included  a  detailed  institutional  structure  for  an \nindependent  entity  to  oversee  the  NSW,  comprising  a  governing  council  with  representatives \nfrom  15  ministries  and  agencies;  a  chief  executive  officer;  a  Secretariat;  and  one  division  for \npolicy  and  one  for  technical  and  operational  matters.  The  latter  division  will  select  the  NSW \noperator.  There  are  also  three  units  under  each  participating  ministry  for  policy,  customer \ninterface, and for technical and operational matters, which, among other tasks, will develop the \nelectronic platform linking the agency with the NSW. A final decision on the operational model \nand  governance  structure  is  expected  to  be  made  in  early  2010.  Selection  of  the  operator  is \nsupported by the next DPL. \n \n\nd. \n\nTrigger 4: Issue Directorate-General (Tax) decree allowing recognition of \ndigital signatures for individual taxpayer registration and for filing personal \nincome tax returns. (current status: achieved) \n\nintroduced  a \n\ntaxpayer-centered  approach \n\n \n67. \nIn an effort to strike an appropriate balance between taxpayer service and enforcement, \nthe  Directorate  General  (Tax)  has  embarked  on  a  major  reform  process  to  modernize  its \norganizational  structure  and  to  introduce  a  modern  compliance  management  approach.  It  has \nsuccessfully  restructured  its  headquarters  by  moving  from  a  \u201ctax  type\u201d  to  one  classified \naccording  to  functions  (registration,  returns  processing,  etc.).  It  is  establishing  a  field  office \nnetwork targeted to specific taxpayer segments (large, medium, and small taxpayer offices). It \nhas  also \nimprove  voluntary  compliance. \nAccomplishments  include  increasing  taxpayer  registration,  increasing  tax  return  filings  by  new \nand  existing  taxpayers,  the  recovery  of  tax  arrears,  and  the  introduction  of  e-registration  and \ne-filing. The number of registered taxpayers, comprising mainly individuals, increased from 4.4 \nmillion in 2005 to 7.1 million in 2007 and an estimated 15.1 million in 2009. \n \n68. \nThe issuance in December 2008 of the decree allowing recognition of digital signatures \nfor individual taxpayer registration and for filing personal income tax returns has permitted the \nrollout  of  e-registration  and  e-filing  for  taxpayers.  Subsequently,  the  Directorate  General  (Tax) \nissued  a  new  regulation  (no.  24/PJ/2009)  to  enable  electronic  tax  registration.  The  regulation \nspecifies the procedures for electronic registration with a taxpayer identification number and/or \nVAT  collector  number.  Replacing  paper  filing  with  electronic  filing  will  reduce  taxpayer  burden \nand filing costs.  \n \n\nto \n\ne. \n\nTrigger 5: Issue Directorate General (Tax) decree implementing new \nsimplified standard formats capturing key financial indicators and annual \ntax returns from all types of businesses, and eliminating the need for \n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\ntaxpayers to submit separate financial statements (current status: \nachieved) \n\n \n69. \nThe  Directorate  General  (Tax)  decree  to  implement  new  simplified  standard  formats \ncapturing  key  financial  indicators  and  annual  tax  returns,  from  all  types  of  businesses,  was \nissued in July 2009. It will do away with the need to physically deliver financial statements to tax \noffices, enabling completely online submission of tax documents.  \n \nOver  the  next  year,  the  Directorate  General  (Tax)  aims  to  continue  to  reduce  taxpayer \n70. \nburden  by  calibrating  the  schedule  for  filing  of  tax  and  VAT  returns  by  specific  companies \naccording  to  their  sector  characteristics.  It  also  expects  to  initiate  a  major  reform  of  core  tax \nsystems,  which  will  entail  (i)  improving  taxpayer  registration,  (ii)  automated  processing  of  tax \nreturns,  (iii)  improved  accounts  processing,  (iv)  a  centralized  document  management  system, \nand  (v)  enhanced  information  and  communication  technology  infrastructure  to  integrate  all \nautomated systems with increased security and backup facilities.  \n \n\nf. \n\nTrigger 6: Issue Ministry of Finance regulation on credit guarantee and \nre-guarantee companies. (current status: achieved) \n\n \n71.   Access to credit is still widely regarded as a major constraint to the growth of MSMEs in \nIndonesia.  Numerous  line  ministries  and  state-owned  enterprises  have  tried  to  run  several \nschemes  for  MSMEs  with  limited  success.  MSMEs  with  viable  business  models  do  not  have \naccess to bank credit for several reasons, including lack of collateral and limited understanding \nby  the  banks  about  the  enterprises'  business  risks.  In  2007,  the  Government  moved  toward \nrationalizing all SME financing programs of line ministries into a unified guarantee facility\u2014the \nKredit  Usaha  Rakyat  (People\u2019s  Entrepreneurship  Credit  Program).  Under  the  Kredit  Usaha \nRakyat, the banks assume 30% of the credit risk and the credit guarantee facility assumes the \nremaining  70%.  In  addition,  following  the  issuance  in  January  2008  of  Government  regulation \n(PP)  no.2/2008,  which allows  for  the  establishment  of  national  and  provincial  credit  guarantee \nand  re-guarantee  companies,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  issued  an  implementing  regulation \n(222/2008)  in  December  2008  that  clarifies,  among  other  things,  the  legal  status  of  these \ncompanies, their ownership structure, reporting mechanisms, and investment options. Under the \nnew regulation, both private and state-owned credit guarantee and re-guarantee companies can \nbe established at the national and provincial level.  \n\n2. \n\nCore Policy Area II: Improved Public Financial Management and \nGovernance \n\nfour  policy  actions \n\nThe  DPL-6/DPSP-5  supports \n\n72.. \nimprove  PFM  and \ngovernance. It bolsters the Government's efforts to orient the budget process toward results in \npriority  policy  areas.  The  DPL-6/DPSP-5  also  supports  reforms  to  ensure  more  effective \nmanagement of public funds through (i) continued implementation of a TSA by automating the \ntreasury  payments  system  in  relation  to  revenue  accounts;  (ii)  implementation  of  a  new  state \nbudget  and  treasury  system  (SPAN);  and  (iii)  more  streamlined  procurement  bidding \ndocuments.  \n \n\nfurther \n\nto \n\na. \n\nTrigger 7: Develop a revised program structure for RPJM 2010\u20132014 \nwith measurable results and targets, draft corresponding key performance \nindicators for all budget holders, and finalize requisite guidelines and \nformats. (current status: achieved) \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\nTo  improve  the  results  orientation  of  the  budget  process,  BAPPENAS  and  MOF  have \n73. \ncommitted to developing a revised program structure that will be used in the medium-term plan \n(RPJM  2010-2014)  to  be  implemented  by  the  new  Government  and  to  be  issued  in  2010.  On \n19 June 2009, a joint circular was signed by both the finance and planning ministers stating that \na  revised  results-based  program  structure  is  to  be  implemented  by  the  76  ministries  and \nministry-level agencies in the process of developing the 2010\u20132014 RPJM and the Ministry and \nAgency  Medium-Term  Strategic  Plan  (Renstra-KL).  This  is  a  critical  first  step  in  achieving  the \ngoal of a results-based budget. The programs and activities in the revised structure would have \nmeasurable  results  and  targets,  and  the  activities  related  to  policy  priorities  should  be \nidentifiable. \n \n74. \nBAPPENAS  and  MOF  launched  on  14  July  2009  a  manual  on  performance-based \nbudgeting (PBB) within the MTEF that provides guidance to line ministries for the preparation of \nthe revised program structure of their medium-term plans. Dissemination of the PBB/MTEF joint \nmanual  and  consultations  on  the  new  program  structures  and  activities  are  ongoing.  The \nPBB/MTEF  joint  manual  also  includes  detailed  guidance  on  how  to  develop  key  performance \nindicators  for  budgeted  programs  with  appropriate  targets  over  a  given  time  period.  Key \nperformance  indicators  would  help  monitor  the  outputs  and  outcomes  of  public  expenditures \nand programs, and track their progress. It is expected that the final versions of the new program \nstructures, activities, and key performance indicators for all 76 budget holders will be completed \nby December 2009.  \n \n\nb. \n\nTrigger 8: Implement daily sweep of revenue accounts into the TSA for \nall commercial banks. (current status: achieved) \n\n \n75. \nUnder  its  treasury  management  program,  the  Government  has  continued  to  expand \nimplementation of the TSA to consolidate all government bank accounts. Regulations issued in \n2007  authorized  MOF  to  bring  all  government  bank  accounts  under  the  TSA.  Since  2007,  the \nTSA  for  expenditure  management  has  been  made  operational  in  all  MOF  Treasury  offices. \nHowever,  an  annual  census  of  the  government  bank  accounts  revealed  that  a  significant \nnumber of accounts are still outside the coverage of the TSA. The TSA has now been extended \nto cover most of the imprest bank accounts currently owned by budgetary institutions for petty \ncash and salary payments. \n\n76. \nThe  consolidation  of  the  TSA  has  advanced  significantly  since  2008.  MOF  and  Bank \nIndonesia  have  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding  providing  for  the  payment  of  interest \non Government cash balances being held in the TSA with Bank Indonesia. The next-day daily \nsweep  of  the  Government's  revenue  accounts  in  all  commercial  banks  into  the  TSA  was \ncompleted  this  year.  The  MOF  decree  No.  116/2009,  issued  in  June  2009,  states  that  by \nJanuary 2010 all revenue accounts maintained in collecting bank branches will be swept to the \nTSA by the  end of the same day. The staged implementation of the same-day daily sweep of \nrevenue  accounts  into  the  TSA  started  on  1  July  2009  in  the  western  region.  This  reform, \ncoupled  with  the  agreement  between  MOF  and  Bank  Indonesia  on  payment  of  interest  on \nGovernment  cash  balances  held  in  the  TSA,  should  enable  the  Treasury  to  optimize  on  cash \nbalances, including the investment of surplus cash. \n \n77. \nThe consolidation of funds into TSA also helps in cash forecasting and thus in relieving \nthe  year-end  bunching  of  expenditures.  The  next  DPL  program  will  support  the  issuance  of  a \nnew  MOF  regulation  on  cash  forecasting,  which  will  also  set  the  stage  for  subsequently \nimproving  cash  forecasting  at  the  provincial  treasury  offices  (KPPNs)  and  budget  forecasting \ncapabilities in some 22,000 satkers (spending units). \n\n \n\n\f 20 \n\nc. \n\nTrigger 9: Sign contract for procurement of the new budget and treasury \nsystem (SPAN). (current status: achieved) \n\n \n78.  MOF  is  in  the  process  of  implementing  an  integrated  financial  management  system  to \nstreamline the multitude of financial data processing applications currently used by government \ninstitutions  and  to  enhance  budget  execution.  The  contract  for  SPAN  was  signed  on  10  July \n2009. It is projected to become operational in selected pilot offices of the treasury beginning in \n2011 and then rolled out to all KPPNs and pilot line ministries in 2012. It is also expected that \nthe  Directorate  General  for  Treasury  will  have  identified  and  completed  improvements  in  the \nbusiness processes of participating institutions in 2010, and that a final version of the chart of \naccounts will be available and integrated into the SPAN.  \n \nSPAN  will  provide  the  backbone  for  modernized  treasury  operations  with  modules \n79. \nrelated to all aspects of the budget execution process. A number of deficiencies that currently \nexist  in  the  budget  execution  process\u2014fragmented  data,  inaccurate  and  delayed  reporting  of \nboth revenue and expenditure transactions, and lack of information on program execution\u2014will \nbe  mitigated  with  the  automation  of  business  processes.  The  establishment  of  an  integrated \nfinancial  database  will  provide  the  ability  to  capture  transactions  at  every  stage  of  the  budget \nexecution process.  \n \n\nd. \n\nTrigger 10: Prepare a draft revised Presidential Decree No. 80/2003 to \naccommodate a new set of national standard bidding documents for use \nby all government agencies. (current status: satisfactory) \n\n \nProgress on streamlining the regulatory framework for public procurement is underway, \n80. \nthough  not  at  the  pace  anticipated.  LKPP  (National  Public  Procurement  Agency)  is  currently \nworking  on  two  tracks\u2014the  preparation  of  a  new  procurement  law  and  revision  of  the \nPresidential Decree 80/2003. It has initiated background studies for a draft procurement law and \nexpects to have the studies as well as a first draft of the legal text of the new procurement law \nprepared  by  September  2010.  However,  the  enactment  of  a  new  procurement  law  could  be  a \nlengthy  process,  as  it  will  require  significant  consultation  and  consensus  building  with \nstakeholders,  and  will  possibly  face  opposition  from  interest  groups.  In  the  interim,  LKPP  is \nworking to revise Presidential Decree 80/2003 with the intention of mandating a set of standard \nbidding  documents  to  be  used  by  all  agencies.16  Presidential  Decree  80/2003  promotes  the \nbasic  principles  of  procurement:  transparency,  open  and  fair  competition,  economy,  and \nefficiency. It covers all areas of procurement that use public funds and contracting entities at all \nlevels of Government. \n \n81. \nLKPP  has  recently  prepared  a  draft  of  the  revised  Presidential  Decree  80/2003, \nmandating  a  set  of  standard  bidding  documents  to  be  used  by  all  agencies.  However,  before \nsubmitting  the  draft  for  interdepartmental  review  LKPP  has  requested  that  ADB,  the  World \nBank,  and  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  review  the  revised \npresidential decree to identify gaps with each institution's procurement guidelines. The revised \npresidential  decree  is  expected  to  be  submitted  to  the  new  administration  in  November  2009, \nwith final issuance scheduled for January 2010. Harmonizing Presidential Decree 80/2003 and \nthe standard bidding documents with international best practice would improve procurement in \n\n                                                 \n16  The  standard  bidding  documents  were  drafted  with  support  from  ADB.

LKPP  recently  issued  a \ndecree  for  all  districts  to  set  up  procurement  service  units  to  assist  local  governments  to \nimplement  the  presidential  decree,  including  the  use  of  e-procurement.  ADB  provided  TA \nsupport  to  help  LKPP  develop  e-procurement  systems  countrywide.  ADB  is  also  providing \nassistance to assess the public procurement system in selected sectors.  \n\n3. \n\nCore Policy Area III: Improved Delivery of Public Services \n\n83. \nBeyond allocating more resources to poverty alleviation programs, several initiatives are \nbeing pursued to enhance the effectiveness of these programs. These include improvements in \nthe  targeting  of  poverty  alleviation  programs  to  ensure  that  they  reach  the  appropriate \nbeneficiaries.  DPSP-5  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  reform  objectives  in  terms  of  enhancing \nthe pro-poor impact of public expenditures by increasing funding for poverty programs. \n \n\na. \n\nTrigger 11: Continue to use poverty targeting in determining the size of \nthe subdistrict community block grants under PNPM and increase the \naverage size of the block grant for the poorest subdistricts. (current \nstatus: achieved) \n\n \n84. \nThe  National  Community  Empowerment  Program  (PNPM  Mandiri)\u2014a  program  of \ncommunity block grants that is the Government\u2019s flagship anti-poverty program\u2014is being scaled \nup in terms of geographical coverage.17 The size of the average block grant is being increased \nat  the  same  time.  By  the  end  of  2009,  the  program  will  reach  every  subdistrict  (kecamatan) \nacross  Indonesia  (6,400  subdistricts,  of  which  about  4,500  are  located  in  rural  areas)  and  full \ncoverage throughout the country will be maintained in 2010. Central Government funding for the \nentire  PNPM  program  is  planned  to  increase  by  23%,  from  Rp10.3  trillion  in  2009  to  an \nestimated  Rp12.7  trillion  in  2010.  The  Government  has  also  introduced  poverty  targeting  to \ndetermine  the  size  of  community  block  grants,  so  that  the  increased  funds  are  allocated  to \nintended  beneficiaries.  The  average  size  of  the  block  grant  for  the  2,000  poorest  subdistricts \nwas increased to Rp2.6 billion in 2009, from Rp1.8 billion in 2008. \n \n85. \nA  unified  household  targeting  database  is  necessary  to  effectively  target  poverty \nprograms.  Many  Government  poverty  alleviation  programs,  such  as  the  unconditional  and \nconditional  cash  transfer  programs,  the  rice  subsidy  program,  and  the  health  insurance \nprogram, are directed to households. However, they are currently implemented by different line \nministries, each using an independent database of beneficiaries. To improve the effectiveness \nand  coordination  of  poverty  programs,  and  reduce  duplication  of  efforts  in  data  collection,  the \nGovernment  intends  to  improve  the  accuracy  of  information  on  poor  households  and  move \ntoward  the  use  of  a  single  database.  The  DPL  program  will  support  the  establishment  of  a \nunified household targeting database and the institutional mechanisms to update the database, \nexpected to be completed in 2010.  \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB is currently supporting PNPM Mandiri through the Rural Infrastructure Support to PNPM-Mandiri (RIS-PNPM) \nproject, which includes community facilitation and mobilization, and rural infrastructure support in the four provinces \nof Jambi, Lampung, Riau, and South Sumatra. \n\n \n\n\f 22 \n\nC. \n\nSome Key Reforms in DPL/DPSP Core Areas Not Included in the Policy Matrix \n\n86. \nIndonesia\u2019s  progress  in  the  core  policy  areas  that  the  DPL/DPSP  supports  were \ncomplemented  by  actions  not  included  in  the  DPL/DPSP  policy  matrix.  These  include  policies \nunder the PESF to bolster market and investor confidence following the global financial turmoil \nin late 2008, passage of a new Public Service Law, and passage of a regional taxes bill.  \n \n87. \nUnder the PESF, several measures were initiated to (i) reassure financial markets and \nmaintain financial system stability by enhancing the financial safety net, maintaining the stability \nof the banking system, and ensuring predictability in the Government\u2019s financing requirements \nfor 2009 and 2010; (ii) sustain critical public expenditures while maintaining budget discipline to \nmitigate  the  poverty  impacts  of  the  growth  slowdown;  and  (iii)  draw  in  private  investment  and \nsupport  exports  by  revising  the  Presidential  Regulation  on  the  DNI,  improving  transparency  in \nrevenues  from  extractive  industries  through  the  Extractive  Industries  Transparency  Initiative, \nand enhancing access to trade finance.  \n \nThe new Public Service Law, passed by Parliament on 23 June 2009, provides a clear \n88. \nblueprint  for  the  new  administration  to  pursue  civil  service  reform.  The  law  (i)  defines  public \nservices  and  public  service  providers;  (ii)  requires  periodic  reporting  on  public  service \nperformance;  (iii)  authorizes  the  merger  of  different  Government  entities  for  the  purpose  of \nincreasing the efficiency and effectiveness of services; (iv) sets forth the rights and obligations \nof  civil  servants;  (v)  obliges  all  institutions  providing  public  services  to  set  clear  service \nstandards;  and  (vi)  establishes  principles  for  handling  complaints  as  well  as  meaningful \nsanctions  for  nonperformance  or  wrongdoing.  All  rules  and  regulations  pertaining  to  public \nservice provision are required to comply with the stipulations of the new law within 2 years of its \npassage. \n\n89. \nParliament passed a regional taxes bill in August 2009, to be fully implemented by 2011. \nThe bill, which had been under deliberation since 2006, specifies a closed list of 41 taxes and \nlevies  within  ranges  that  provincial  and  district  authorities  are  allowed  to  impose.  The \nintroduction of a closed-list mechanism in the bill will prevent regions from introducing taxes or \nlevies not included in the list, thus lending a degree of certainty to investors.  \n\nD. \n\nTriggers for Future DPLs/DPSPs \n\n90. \nThe current DPL program is the sixth such operation in Indonesia, and the second of a \n3-year  DPL  series  as  proposed  under  the  World  Bank\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for \nFY2009\u2013FY2012.  Indicative  triggers  for  the  next  DPL  series  have  been  developed,  as  noted \nabove,  after  discussions  between  government  counterparts  and  the  development  partners \ninvolved in the DPL/DPSP process (Table 3).  \n \n91. \nThe  triggers  for  DPL-7/DPSP-6  will  be  further  discussed  and  validated  with  the  new \nGovernment. The 2010 program continues to support reforms in the same policy areas. Among \nthe  policy  actions  proposed  are  ones  that  are  intended  to  further  reduce  uncertainty  for \ninvestors by implementing PTSPs; select an operator for the NSW; accelerate tax administration \nreforms;  further  improve  the  results  orientation  of  the  budget  and  its  execution;  continue  to \nmove  toward  an  enhanced  regulatory  framework  for  public  procurement,  improve  the \ngovernment  accounting  and  auditing  systems  (Appendix  8);  and  launch  a  unified  household \ntargeting database to enhance the pro-poor impact of poverty alleviation programs.  \n \n\n\f23 \n\n \nTable 3: Indicative Triggers for DPL-7/DPSP-6 \n\n \n\nPolicy Aim \n\nPolicy Area 1: Improving the investment climate \n\nstrengthening investment service \ninstitutions and improving investment \nregulations \n\n(PTSP)  \n\nkey sectors \n\n1.1.

DPSP-5  provides  parallel  cofinancing  for  the  World  Bank-supported \nDPL-6,  for  which  the  Government  has  requested  $750  million.  In  addition,  the  Government \nintends  to  request  $100  million  from  the  Government  of  Japan  for  parallel  cofinancing  of  the \nDPL-6. The DPSP loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum; conversion options that may be exercised in \naccordance  with  the  draft  Loan  Agreement,  the  loan  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  conversion \nguidelines;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  program  Loan \nAgreement.  The  Government  has  made  its  own  independent  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, and it has given an undertaking that this choice was not made on \nthe basis of any advice from ADB. Responding favorably to the Government\u2019s request will signal \nADB\u2019s relevance in an emerging, confident, and well-performing middle-income country.  \n \n\n \n\n\f 24 \n\nThe Government's gross financing needs have increased from $18.2 billion in 2008 to an \n93. \nestimated $25.8 billion in 2009 (Table 4). This reflects a higher fiscal deficit and high levels of \ndomestic  and  foreign  debt  principal  repayment.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  support  is  based  on  the \nstrengths of the policy package, its development impact, the importance of the sectors covered, \nand investment needs.  \n \n\nTable 4: Projected Financing Requirement of the Government of Indonesia for 2009  \n($ billion) \n\nProposed Amount \n\nFinancing Mix \nGross Financing Requirement \nLess Amortization \nNet Financing Requirement \n \nProgrammed Official External Borrowing for 2009 \n\nOf which: \nADB's Proposed Loan Pipeline for 2009 \n\nCapital Market Development Program Cluster II \nFifth Development Policy Support Program \nIndonesia Infrastructure Financing Facility Project \nJava\u2013Bali Electricity Distribution Performance Improvement \nRural Infrastructure Support to PNPM Mandiri Project II \n\n25.770 \n12.150 \n13.620 \n \n\n6.600 \n\n \n\n0.734 \n0.300 \n0.200 \n0.100 \n0.050 \n0.084 \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  PNPM  =  Program  Nasional  Pemberdayaan  Masyarakat  (National  Community \nEmpowerment Program) \nNote: Exchange rate: $1 = Rp 10,500. \nSources: Ministry of Finance and ADB estimates. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\nThe  Coordinating  Ministry  for  Economic  Affairs  will  be  the  Executing  Agency, \n94. \ncollaborating  closely  with  MOF.  Implementation  of  DPL-6/DPSP-5  actions  is  coordinated  with \nseveral other ministries and agencies, including BAPPENAS and the Ministry of Trade.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe program implementation period for DPSP-5 is from January to December 2009.  \n\n95. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement Arrangements  \n\n96. \nThe  program  loan  of  $200  million  will  be  released  in  a  single  tranche  upon  loan \neffectiveness.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs \n(excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries, \nexcluding  the  items  specified  in  the  negative  list  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  7)  and  imports \nfinanced  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In  accordance  with  ADB  provisions  for \nsimplifying disbursement of program loans,18 the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed \nto  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  as  the  Borrower.  No  supporting  import  documentation  will  be \nrequired  if  during  each  year  that  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed  the  value  of \nIndonesia\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \nimports  financed  under  other  official  development  assistance  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the \namount of the loan expected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its \n\n                                                 \n18 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n\n\f25 \n\ncompliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation \nunder existing procedures will be required.  \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption  \n\n97. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Program  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Program. In addition, DPSP-5 has \na  core  focus  on  improving  governance  and  anticorruption.  It  promotes  transparency  in  PFM. \nNoteworthy  progress  has  been  achieved  through  the  TSA  system,  which  will  help  the \nGovernment  in  its  anticorruption  efforts.  The  Program\u2019s  focus  on  tax  audit  procedures, \nsimplifying and/or eliminating unnecessary business licenses, and implementing good corporate \ngovernance in state-owned banks will also further the Government\u2019s anticorruption agenda and \nimprove the investment climate. \n \n98. \nThe Government places significant emphasis on strengthening internal control systems \nand  overall  PFM,  with  support  from  the  World  Bank  through  the  Government  Financial \nManagement  and  Revenue  Administration  Project  and  from  ADB  through  the  State  Audit \nReform  Sector  Development  Program.19  Reforms  and  capacity  development \ninitiatives \nsupported under both of these programs have led to initial progress in strengthening PFM. \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n99. \nADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s  certification  for  the  withdrawal  applications.  Before  withdrawal,  the  Government \nwill nominate a deposit account at Bank Indonesia to receive all loan proceeds. The account will \nbe managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n\n6. \n\nPerformance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n\n100.  The CMEA, MOF, and BAPPENAS will continuously monitor implementation of the DPL-\nrelated reforms and their impacts, in line with the overall program framework and outcome and \noutput indicators agreed upon with the Government. Participating development partners will also \nevaluate the triggers based on frequent discussions with key government counterparts, and on \nevidence in the form of key implementation decrees, circulars, etc.  \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nExpected Impacts \n\n101.  The key benefits expected from implementation of the Program are \n \n                                                 \n19  ADB.  2004.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nRepublic  of  Indonesia  for  the  State  Audit  Reform  Sector  Development  Program.  Manila  (Loan  2127-INO[SF], \napproved in December, for the equivalent of $25.0 million). \n\n \n\n\f 26 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nin  meeting \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  medium-term  objectives \n\nthrough \nprogress \nimprovements in (a) the investment climate, (b) public financial management and \ngovernance, and (c) service delivery to the poor; \nraising the profile of key issues at the ministerial level, accelerating the timetable \nfor  policy  actions  to  be  taken,  addressing  administrative  and  bureaucratic \nbottlenecks to reform, and encouraging policy coordination across economic and \nline ministries; \nsustained  ADB  engagement  in  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  the \ndirection  and  content  of,  and  strategies  for,  its  economic,  structural,  and \ninstitutional  reform  agenda  (with  DPSP-5  providing  for  policy  continuity  and \nconsistency in sectors where ADB has been actively involved); \naid  harmonization  and  cofinancing  by  the  key  development  partners  (ADB,  the \nGovernment of Japan, and the World Bank) around a common policy framework \nand dialogue,  \nfacilitation,  through  crosscutting  reforms,  of  sector-specific  reforms  in  areas \nwhere ADB is providing or is planning future support. \n\n \n102. \nInstitutional. Significant benefits stem from the engagement of Indonesia\u2019s three main \ndevelopment partners, which collectively provide an estimated 80% of official external support. \nParticipation  in  the  DPL  series  has  contributed  to  effective  institutional  coordination  among \ndevelopment partners as well as between the Government and these partners (Appendix 6). In \nsome  of  the  core  areas,  such  as  public  financial  management  and  poverty  alleviation,  the \ncoordination process is formalized through multi-donor facilities (such as the PFM Multi-Donor \nTrust Fund and the PNPM  Support Facility), chaired by the Government and managed by the \nWorld  Bank.  This  has  helped  streamline  and  coordinate  the  provision  of  advisory  support \nthrough  TA  to  best  meet  the  Government\u2019s  needs.  The  measures  supported  under  the \nDPL/DPSP series will result in sustained improvements in institutional capacity in key areas of \npolicy formulation such as fiscal policy, debt and treasury management, and public expenditure \nand financial management. \n \n103.  Social.  The  main  contributions  of  the  DPSP  series  in  this  area  is  to  improve  public \nadministration, reorient public expenditures toward productive needs, and continuously support \ngovernment  measures  to  align  its  resources  effectively  with  its  medium-term  objectives  of \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  By  supporting  strategic  reforms  aimed  at  improving \npublic service delivery, the Program will have a direct and beneficial social impact. Appendix 9 \npresents a summary poverty reduction and social strategy. \n \n104.  Economic.  The  nature  of  the  DPSP  series  limits  the  scope  for  quantitative  economic \nanalysis.  In  qualitative  terms,  the  Program's  main  impacts  will  be  lower  business  transaction \ncosts, \nfor  MSMEs),  and  progressive \nimprovements  in  both  the  quantity  and  quality  of  public  services  (including  better  targeting  of \nsuch  services  to  the  poor).  It  is  expected  that  the  lower  business  transaction  costs  from \nregulatory  reform,  and  reduced  times  for  business  licensing,  VAT  refunds,  and  import  and \nexport  applications  through  the  NSW,  will  lead  to  greater  competition  and  encourage  more \nproductive investments. These benefits will help foster economic growth and reduce poverty in \nthe  medium  term.  The  net  effect  of  improved  access  to  finance  for  MSMEs  will  be  to  reduce \npoverty  indirectly  by  fostering  additional  growth.  Initially,  the  main  beneficiaries  would  be \nMSMEs, with benefits eventually filtering to the wider population through increased employment \ngeneration.  \n \n\nto  assets  (specifically  capital \n\nimproved  access \n\n\f27 \n\nimproved  cash  management\u2014would \n\n105.  Reforms  to  the  budget  formulation  and  execution  process\u2014through  more  results-\noriented  budget  documents  and \nimprove  budget \nallocations and operational efficiency, and reduce corruption. This is likely to be enhanced in the \nmedium to longer term, especially after full adoption of the PBB/MTEF approach in the next 5-\nyear plan. Increases in the 2009 PNPM allocation are expected to have a more immediate effect \nthrough increased block grant transfers for community-led development projects. The programs\u2019 \nnear-term impact on the poor will be realized mostly through the PNPM block grant increases, \nwhile improved service access and delivery for poorer groups will be realized over the medium \nto longer term. \n \n106.  Resettlement,  indigenous  people,  and  environment.  Implementation  of  the  DPSP-5 \nmeasures will cause no direct or indirect involuntary resettlement, nor will it lead to any issues \naffecting indigenous peoples. The measures supported under DPSP-5 are unlikely to have any \nadverse environmental impacts. \n\nB. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nImplementation of DPSP-5 is subject to the following risks: \n\nExternal  vulnerabilities.  Indonesia  has  weathered  the  global  economic  crisis \nwell,  reflecting  its  increased  resilience  to  external  shocks built  up  over  previous \nyears.  Factors  limiting  the  potential  impacts  of  external  shocks  include  diversity \nof  exports,  moderate  public  debt,  limited  external  debt  exposure,  and  an \nadequate  level  of  reserves.  The  banking  sector  is  also  now  sufficiently  strong. \nThe  maintenance  of  a  financial  sector  safety  net  supported  by  PESF  and \nDPL/DPSP will further improve the resilience of the banking sector.  \n\nNevertheless,  risks  remain  high,  especially  during  a  period  of  global  financial \nturmoil. Indonesia has an open financial system. Domestic residents can switch \nto  foreign  assets  easily  and  foreign  holdings  are  significant,  especially  in  the \nstock market and government bonds. The country is thus vulnerable to shifts in \ninvestor  sentiment.  If  significant  funds  are  pulled  back  because  of  liquidity \ndemands in other countries and/or increased emerging market risk aversion, this \ncould  increase  pressure  on  domestic  interest  and  exchange  rates.  In  addition, \nthe  Government  has  large  gross  financing  needs  over  the  next  few  years,  and \ntighter  credit  markets  and  increased  risk  aversion  could  limit  the  Government\u2019s \nability to tap international financial markets. This could force the Government to \ncut budgetary outlays to maintain fiscal balance, with adverse consequences for \ninfrastructure and social expenditures. It could also distract the Government from \nimplementing its medium-term reform agenda, including those supported by the \nDPL/DPSP. \n \nThe measures taken since mid-2008 to mitigate the effects of the global financial \ncrisis,  including  the  bilateral  swap  arrangements  with  the  People's  Republic  of \nChina and Japan and support from the PESF, will help reduce this risk. But it will \nalso  require  close  cooperation  between  Bank  Indonesia  and  the  economic \nministries to reassure bondholders that their investments are safe (from inflation \nand exchange rate movements) while drawing in private investment through the \nkinds of structural reforms supported by the DPL/DPSP. \n \n\n107. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 28 \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nSubsidies. As international oil prices have fallen since mid-2008, domestic fuel \nsubsides  have  also  declined.  The  proposed  budget  for  2010  envisages  energy \nsubsidies of 1.6% of GDP, down from 1.9% of GDP in 2009 and a recent peak of \n4.5%  of  GDP  in  2008.  However,  the  recent  increase  in  international  fuel  prices \nsuggests  that  a  return  to  high  international  fuel  prices  remains  a  risk.  Fixed \ndomestic  fuel  prices  and  the  subsidies  they  create  represent  a  threat  to  fiscal \nsustainability  in  the  longer  term.  They  are  also  regressive  and  inefficient,  and \nhave high opportunity costs. The Government has shown its willingness to raise \ndomestic  prices  and  reduce  subsidies,  most  recently  in  May  2008.  ADB  will \ncontinue to engage the Government in this area through policy dialogue.  \n\nFiduciary constraints. Utilization of public resources continues to be a concern, \nnotwithstanding the improvements underway. The overall fiduciary assessments \nundertaken  since  the  2001  country  financial  accountability  assessment  point  to \nconsiderable  improvements  in  Indonesia's  fiduciary  environment.  Ongoing \nprograms  supported  by  several  development  partners  provide  significant  TA  to \nstrengthen fiduciary governance. The DPL/DPSP focus on strengthening budget \npreparation,  execution,  and \nfinancial  management  will \nsignificantly enhance transparency (Appendix 8). \n\ntransparency \n\nin \n\nSecurity  risks.  Alerts  stemming  from  sectarian  and  regional  conflicts  and \nterrorism could slow foreign direct investment and set back the tourism industry. \nThe  Government  and  law  enforcement  authorities  have  taken  a  range  of \nmeasures aimed at bolstering public and investor confidence. \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n108. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\nCounterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  development  needs  as  outlined \nunder DPSP-5 implementation arrangements. \nThe policies and actions taken before the date of the DPSP-5 Loan Agreement, \nas  described  in  the  development  policy  letter  (including  the  policy  matrix),  will \ncontinue to be in effect for the duration of ADB\u2019s engagement in the DPL series, \nand subsequently. \n\n\f29 \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n109. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the loan of $200,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for the Fifth Development Policy \nSupport  Program  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of \n15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n \n \n \n \n\nC.

From  DPL-4/DPSP-3  the  Government  and  development \npartners agreed to remove macroeconomic stability and creditworthiness as a core policy area, and replace it with improved delivery of public services. \nSource: Government of Indonesia. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n41 \n\nRESULTS ACHIEVED UNDER THE DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN/ \nDEVELOPMENT POLICY SUPPORT PROGRAM \n\nCore Policy Area 1: Macroeconomic Stability \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe  DPL/DPSP  series  in  2004\u20132006  sought  to  improve  debt  management  and  fiscal \npolicy  management  by  reducing  subsidies  to  the  nonpoor  and  making  revenue  administration \nmore efficient through the expansion of modern tax officers. \n \n2. \nOverall  macroeconomic  fundamentals  remain  sound  and  fiscal  consolidation  has \nimproved with the expansion of the tax base and improved efficiency of tax administration. From \n2004\u20132008, economic growth averaged a substantive 5.7%, the public debt-to-gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  ratio  declined  nearly  28  percentage  points  to  a  moderate  33%,  budget  deficits \nwere manageable, and international reserves remained adequate to provide the country with a \ncomfortable  liquidity  cushion.  Increasing  non-oil  and  gas  revenues  as  a  percentage  of  GDP \nwere supported by a prior DPL/DPSP action to expand modernization of tax offices and the tax \nbase  to  include  medium  and  small  taxpayers.  Additional  reforms  to  improve  tax  analysis, \nincluding the creation of a Tax Policy Office, are expected to generate improvements in revenue \ncollection.  \n \nOn the expenditure side, reductions in untargeted fuel subsidies in 2005 allowed greater \n3. \nsocial spending, but untargeted subsidies remain burdensome. In 2005, the Government raised \nfuel prices, resulting in the decline of fuel subsidies from 4% of GDP in 2004 to 2.8% in 2006, \nfreeing up $10 billion a year. This amount was rolled out into cash transfers targeted at the poor, \nor went toward higher health and education expenditures. However, as oil prices continued to \nbreak records throughout 2008, fuel subsidies rose sharply, causing the Government to spend \nan  additional  Rp50  trillion  (1.2%  of  GDP)  in  the  first  part  of  the  year.  In  May 2008,  the \nGovernment  again  increased  fuel  prices  by  almost  30%  and  accompanied  this  with  a  widely \npublicized  and  improved  cash  transfer  program.  This  move,  together  with  a  reduction  in  oil \nprices in the second half of 2008, limited the energy subsidy in 2008 to 4.5% of GDP. \n\n \n4. \nRating  agencies  have  responded  favorably  to  Indonesia\u2019s  lower  debt  ratio  and  the \nreform packages. In a reflection of the country\u2019s more sound economic footing, all three credit \nagencies have raised their credit ratings at least three notches since 2003. Standard and Poor\u2019s \nupgraded Indonesia\u2019s credit rating from CCC+ in 2003 to BB\u2013 by 2008; likewise in this period, \nMoody\u2019s raised its ratings from B2 to Ba3; and Fitch raised its from B to BB. In supporting their \nratings  upgrades,  the  agencies  cited  debt  reduction  as  the  primary  cause,  as  well  as  the \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  broad-based  reform,  including  changes  to  investment  laws, \ncustoms  and  tax  reforms,  and  fiscal  reforms,  specifically  in  treasury  and  budget\u2014measures \nsupported by the DPL/DPSP series. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe  DPL/DPSP  series  seeks  to  improve  the  investment  climate  through  several  key \nentry  areas,  including  regulatory  reform,  tax  reform,  custom  and  trade  reform,  financial  sector \nstability, and improved access to finance by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). \n \n6. \nIn  2006,  the  Government  issued  three  economic  policy  packages  covering  investment \nclimate,  infrastructure,  and  financial  reform.  In  2007,  a  comprehensive  follow-up  package  was \nissued  detailing  168  specific  reform  measures  to  be  carried  out.  As  a  result,  business \nperceptions have improved. A study of manufacturing firms in mid-2007 indicated improvements \n\nCore Policy Area 2: Investment Climate \n\n \n\n\f42  \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nlicenses  and  multiple \n\nin  VAT  refunds,  tax  filing  processes,  informal  payments,  and  faster  import  and  custom \nclearance. Surveys of foreign investors also show that perceptions of Indonesia are improving. \nIn  the  annual  Japan  Bank  of  International  Cooperation  survey,  620  Japanese  multinational \ncompanies, operating in global markets, ranked Indonesia the eighth most promising country for \noverseas business in 2008, similar to its rank in the previous year. Although full implementation \nof  the  investment  policy  packages  has  yet  to  take  place,  initial  signs  are  encouraging\u2014\ninvestment rates have risen from less than 20% of GDP in 2003 to 27.6% in 2008. \n \nRegulatory  reforms  supported  by  the  DPL/DPSP  process,  particularly  those  relating  to \n7. \nsimplifying  and  eliminating  unnecessary  business \nregistration \nrequirements,  have  led  to  more  streamlined  procedures  supportive  of  the  investment  climate. \nAccording  to  Doing  Business  2010,  the  time  to  set  up  a  business  has  fallen  significantly  from \n168 days in 2003, to 105 days in 2007, to 60 days in 2009.1 Another key achievement has been \nthe  passage  of  the  Investment  Law,  which  clarified  previously  arbitrary  investment  rules.  The \nlaw  focuses  on  equal  treatment  of  foreign  and  domestic  investment,  removes  the  forced \ndivestment and limited duration of foreign investment in the old law, lengthens the time horizon \nto hold land, liberalizes some immigration procedures, and allows for international arbitration. \n \n8. \nTax  reform  has  addressed  some  of  the  key  complaints  from  the  business  community. \nReforms  in  tax  administration  have  halved  the  time  for  VAT  refunds;  in  addition,  more  than \nRp10 trillion (roughly $1 billion) in outstanding VAT refunds have been settled. New procedures \nhave  been  put  in  place  to  issue  VAT  refunds  to  export  companies  within  set  time  frames. \nStandard  operating  procedures  for  a  complaint  management  system  have  been  issued.  The \nDPL/DPSP  has  also  supported  the  issuance  of  a  decree  on  tax  audit  procedures  that  allows \ntaxpayers to delay payment of tax assessments from disputed audits. However, this decree only \naffects disputes arising since the 2008 tax year; older disputes continue to be arbitrated under \nthe old rule. \n \nSignificant  progress  on  trade  and  customs  reform  has  been  made,  with  pilot  testing  of \n9. \nIndonesia\u2019s  national  single  window  (NSW)  and  paperless  import  clearance.  Implementation  of \nthe  NSW  is  one  of  the  country\u2019s  most  important  trade  facilitation  initiatives.  Under  a  single \nwindow,  exporters  and  importers  will  no  longer  be  required  to  apply  individually  to  multiple \nagencies\u2014significantly reducing the number of days it takes to export and import goods. A pilot \nproject is underway in Jakarta\u2019s main port and will be expanded to other ports in preparation for \nthe establishment of an ASEAN single window. Other trade reforms sought by the DPL aimed to \nimprove  the  technical  capacity  of  the  tariff  team  in  setting  and  evaluating  tariff  changes  and \nnontariff barriers imposed by line ministries. \n \n10. \nAn original objective of the DPL/DPSP series was to strengthen the financial sector by \nreducing the role of state-owned banks and increasing the share of financial assets at nonbank \nfinancial  institutions.  As  of  June  2008,  the  share  of  state-owned  banks  in  the  banking  system \n(36%) was a significant 10 percentage points less than in 2003, indicating that the role of private \nbanks  in  the  sector  is  increasing.  Less  progress  has  been  made  with  nonbank  financial \ninstitutions\u2014they accounted for 19.9% of total assets in the financial sector as of March 2008, \ncompared with a 17.4% share in 2005. However, other indicators point to a healthier financial \nsystem\u2014profitability  ratios  such  as  net  interest  margin,  return  on  assets,  and  return  on  equity \nremain  strong.  Nonperforming  loans,  particularly  in  state-owned  banks,  have  declined \nsubstantially  after  peaking  in  2005.  In  terms  of  diversification,  SME  lending  has  been  rising \nrapidly and now accounts for half of the lending portfolio.  \n\n                                                 \n1 World Bank. 2009.

Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n43 \n\nCore Policy Area 3: Public Financial Management and Governance \n\nIn  strengthening  the  stability  of  the  financial  sector,  the  DPL/DPSP  has  supported  the \n11. \nimplementation  of  a  sounder  financial  safety  net.  At  the  start  of  the  DPL  series,  there  was  a \nneed  to  reduce  the  economic  distortion  and  potential  moral  hazard  caused  by  the  blanket \nguarantee  that  existed  at  the  time,  which  had  been  introduced  during  the  Asian  crisis  1997\u2013\n1998  to  stem  bank  runs.  To  this  effect,  the  DPL/DPSP  series  supported  several  reforms, \nincluding a deposit insurance scheme, institutionalizing Bank Indonesia\u2019s role as lender of last \nresort,  and  establishing  institutional  processes  and  mechanisms  for  resolving  troubled  banks. \nBy  the  end  of  the  DPL-4/DPSP-3  in  2007,  coverage  on  deposits  had  been  reduced  from  a \nblanket guarantee in 2003 to Rp100 million. Indonesia is one of the few countries in the world \nthat  removed  its  blanket  guarantee  on  schedule.  In  October  2008  the  authorities  announced \nseveral  confidence-building  measures  in  response  to  the  global  financial  crisis,  including  a \ntwenty-fold increase in the deposit guarantee to Rp2 billion (approximately $200,000).  \n \nC. \n \n12. \nTo  improve  the  efficiency,  transparency,  and  accountability  of  public  finances,  the \nDPL/DPSP  series  has  focused  on  three  key  areas  of  reform:  (i)  modernizing  public  financial \nmanagement  systems,  (ii)  strengthening  institutional  reform  within  the  Ministry  of  Finance \n(MOF), and more recently (iii) civil service reform.  \n \nChanges in the legal and regulatory architecture for PFM are now largely complete and \n13. \nthe  focus  has  moved  toward  implementing  a  modern  PFM  system.  Before  the  start  of  the \nDPL/DPSP  series,  the  Government\u2019s  financial  operations  were  based  on  outdated  laws  (from \n1925)  that  had  been  updated  with  a  series  of  inadequate  decrees.  The  previous  PFM  system \nallowed for systematic and pervasive corruption, collusion, and nepotism because assignments \nwere  unclear,  transparency  was  low,  and  enforcement  poor.  Budget  formulation  was  opaque \nand inefficient, making it difficult to quantify basic concepts of the budget. Budget execution was \noften delayed and monitoring arrangements were weak. Procurement processes were prone to \ncorruption  and  collusion.  Accounting  and  reporting  were  fragmented  and  not  always  reliable, \nand mandates of government audit bodies were not clearly defined. The DPL supported various \nmeasures in the areas of budget preparation and execution to create the regulatory framework \nfor a more modern PFM system.  \n \n14. \nA key achievement under the DPL/DPSP series has been the implementation of the TSA \nto  improve  cash  management  of  public  finances.  At  the  start  of  the  DPL  series,  more  than \n18,000  commercial  bank  accounts\u2014and  other  accounts  not  even  known  to  the  Treasury\u2014\nhandled  government  funds.  As  an  initial  step,  DPL-1  addressed  regulatory  deficiencies  in  the \nPFM  system,  including  the  passage  of  several  laws  defining  the  regulatory  framework. \nReorganization of MOF was also carried out to begin the process of establishing a TSA, and to \nclean  up  the  Government\u2019s  cash  management  issues.  DPL-2/DPSP-1  then  supported \nregulations  underlining  these  laws  and  adopted  an  implementation  plan.  DPL-3/DPSP-2  pilot \ntested  the  TSA  to  have  zero-balance  accounts  in  more  than  50  provincial  treasury  offices \n(KPPNs).  DPL-4/DPSP-3  extended  the  TSA  coverage  to  nearly  full  implementation  on \ngovernment  expenditure  accounts.  Progress  on  covering  revenue  accounts  was  more \ncomplicated, but has now advanced significantly. \n \n15. \nimproved,  but  execution  remains  problematic.  The \nDPL/DPSP series has helped move forward reforms to reengineer business processes across \nthe  budget  cycle.  The  national  budget  is  now  compatible  with  the  international  standard  GFS \nclassification.  Fiscal  reporting  is  more  comprehensive  and  timely.  Elements  of  a  medium-term \nexpenditure framework have been introduced, although they are not yet fully operational in the \n\nBudgeting  procedures  have \n\n \n\n\f44  \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nin  2006-2007  supported  comprehensive  reform  of \n\nbudget system. Whereas the planning and reporting side of the budget process has improved, \nexecuting the budget has remained weak, with about 50% of capital expenditures being spent in \nthe last quarter. \n \nProcurement  reform  has  been  slow  to  take  off.  The  original  trigger  aimed  only  at \n16. \nstrengthening the existing National Procurement Office. Instead, the Government established a \nnew National Public Procurement Agency (LKPP) as an independent office directly responsible \nto  the  President.  As  an  independent  agency  with  adequate  resources,  authority,  and  strong \npolitical  backing,  it  will  be  in  a  stronger  position  to  drive  public  procurement  reform.  However, \nbecause  of  the  time  required  to  set  up  the  LKPP,  there  was  a  lack  of  progress  on  other \nprocurement reforms, such as developing a comprehensive national public sector procurement \nlaw. This law is needed to address the numerous inconsistencies resulting from decentralization \nreforms,  which  have  enabled  authorities  at  various  levels  of  government  to  issue  their  own \nprocurement procedures. Other deficiencies of the system include slow progress in the passage \nof  regulations,  and  the  adoption  of  standard  tools  such  as  bidding  documents  and  user \nmanuals. \n \n17. \nInitial  steps to  address civil  service  reform  have  been  launched.  Lack of  administrative \ncapacity  and  distorted  incentives  in  government  bureaucracy  have  constrained  both  policy \nimplementation and delivery of public services. As  an initial step to reforming the civil service, \nthe  structure  and \nthe  DPL/DPSP \nremuneration framework for high-ranking state officials. A task force was set up to examine the \nentire  compensation  package  with  the  goal  of  creating  a  more  transparent,  systematic,  and \ncoherent framework for pay and allowances based on a comprehensive job evaluation and pay \ngrading.  Building  on  this,  MOF  has  developed  a  comprehensive  civil  service  reform  plan  and \naction plan for itself, which is now being pilot-tested in other agencies.  \n \nD. \n \n18. \nThe  groundwork  for  improving  poverty  targeting  of  basic  services  has  been  initiated. \nBefore the rise in fuel prices in 2005, Indonesia\u2019s social protection system was characterized by \nemergency  short-term  safety  net  programs  and  price  subsidies.  The  country\u2019s  three  targeted \nprograms  accounted  for  less  than  0.5%  of  GDP,  compared  with  almost  4.0%  of  GDP  for  the \nuntargeted fuel subsides, of which less than 0.2% of GDP went to the poorest quintile. As the \nfuel  price  hike  freed  up  more  funds  for  social  spending,  the  DPL  supported  capacity  building \ninitiatives  to  improve  the  targeting  of  these  released  funds.  The  2005  fuel  hike  was \naccompanied  by  a  new  cash  transfer  program  to  help  alleviate  the  impact  on  the  poorest \nhouseholds\u2014representing a substantial shift from the ineffective and inefficient general subsidy \nprogram. Evaluative assessments were conducted to improve targeting and performance of the \ncash transfer program, and the lessons were incorporated into the new cash transfer program \nthat  accompanied  the  May  2008  fuel  price  increase.  The  Government  has  moved  to  set  up  a \ncomprehensive  monitoring  and  evaluation  function,  including  the  establishment  of  a  unit  to \nundertake  performance  evaluations,  with  the  findings  to  be  used  as  an  input  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s planning and budgeting cycle. \n \n\nCore Policy Area 4: Improved Delivery of Public Services \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n45\n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n47\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n49\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fPOLICY MATRIX FOR THE FIFTH DEVELOPMENT POLICY SUPPORT PROGRAM \n\nDPSP-5 Policy Measures \n\nStatus as of September 2009 \n\n5\n0\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n5\n \n\ni\n\nAchieved.  A  draft  investment  negative  list  (DNI)  was  prepared  and  discussed  in  February  2009  with \nstakeholders,  including  the  business  community.  The  draft  was  endorsed  by  a  plenary  meeting  of  20 \nministers in July 2009. According to the draft, about 70 business activities will become less restrictive while \n8  will  become  more  restrictive.  The  revised  draft  clarifies  that  investments  made  before  issuance  of  the \nrevised  regulation  are  governed  by  their  original  letter  of  approval  and  that  investments  in  publicly  listed \ncompanies are not subject to the DNI. The draft also incorporates international commitments, to the extent \nthat  these  are  less  restrictive,  for  the  first time  in  an  investment  negative  list  in  Indonesia.  The  text  of the \ndraft is now being discussed at the President\u2019s office. \nAchieved. The Presidential Regulation was issued on 23 June 2009. The regulation allows ministries and \ncentral  Government  agencies  to  turn  over  or  delegate  their  authority  to  issue  business  licenses  to  the \nNational  Investment  Coordinating  Board  (BKPM).  It  authorizes  BKPM  to  establish  a  one-stop  shop  for \ninvestment  licensing  as  well  as  an  electronic  information  and  licensing  service.  At  the  local  government \nlevel as well, the regulation requires that business licensing authority be transferred to local one-stop shops, \nand empowers BKPM to monitor the implementation and performance of the local one-stop shops. \n\nSatisfactory. The decision on the operational model and the governance structure for the Indonesia NSW \nwas  originally  scheduled  for  December  2008  and  then  moved  forward  to  mid-2009.  However,  following \ndelays  in  the  technical  experts'  recommendations  for  an  operational  model,  it  is  now  anticipated  that  the \ndecision will be made at the end of 2009. The Indonesia NSW team submitted a draft proposal with options \nand recommendations to the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs in August 2009. \n \n \nAchieved.  The  issuance  in  December  2008  of  the  decree  allowing  recognition  of  digital  signatures  for \nindividual  taxpayer  registration  and  for  filing  personal  income  tax  returns  has  permitted  the  roll  out  of  e-\nregistration and e-filing for taxpayers. Subsequently, the Directorate General (Tax) issued a new regulation \n(no. 24/PJ/2009) to enable electronic tax registration. The regulation specifies the procedures for electronic \nregistration with a taxpayer identification number and/or VAT collector number. The electronic filing instead \nof paper filing will reduce taxpayer burden and filing costs. \n \nAchieved. The Directorate General (Tax) decree was issued in July 2009. It will implement new simplified \nstandard format capturing key financial indicators and annual tax returns, from all types of businesses.

The  staged  implementation  of  the  same-day  daily  sweep  of  revenue  accounts  into  the  TSA \nstarted on 1 July in the Western region and is expected to continue until December this year. \nAchieved.  The  contract  for  the  State  Budget  and  Treasury  System  (SPAN)  was  signed  on  10  July.  It  is \nprojected to become operational in some pilot offices of the treasury beginning in 2011 and then rolled out \nto the provincial treasury offices (KPPNs) and pilot line ministries starting 2012. \n\nSatisfactory. LKPP has recently prepared a draft of the revised Presidential Decree no.80/2003, mandating \na  set  of  standard  bidding  documents  to  be  used  by  all  agencies.  However,  before  submitting  the  draft  for \ninterdepartmental review they have requested development partners to review it to identify gaps with each \ninstitution's procurement guidelines.

ADB  began  participating  in  the  series  in \n2005,1 contributing $200 million annually for a total of $800 million through 31 December 2008.  \nThe  Government  of  Japan's  contribution  was  $100  million  annually  during  2004\u20132006  and  in \n2008, and $200 million in 2007. The World Bank's contribution rose from $300 million for DPL-1 \nin 2004 to $750 million for DPL-5 and DPL-6 in 2008 and 2009 respectively, for a total of $3,400 \nmillion. \n \nA number of bilateral and multilateral agencies provide technical assistance in the core \n2. \nareas  of  the  DPL/DPSP.    Table  A6  presents  some  key  programs  of  development  partners  in \nthese core areas. \n \nB.  \n \n3. \nSince the dissolution of the Consultative Group for Indonesia process in 2007, there has \nnot  been  a  regular  development  partners'  forum  although  BAPPENAS  has  maintained \nresponsibility for overall coordination among development partners.  Donor coordination is also \nsupported  through  institutional  arrangements  under  key  Government  programs.  For  example, \nthe DPL series has contributed to effective institutional coordination in key reform areas among \ndevelopment  partners  as  well  as  between  the  Government  and  these  partners.  In  public \nfinancial  management  and  improved  public  service  delivery  to  the  poor,  the  coordination \nprocess  is  also  formalized  through  multi-donor  facilities,  such  as  the  PFM  Multi-Donor  Trust \nFund and the PNPM  Support Facility, chaired by the  Government and  managed by the World \nBank.2  This  has  helped  streamline  and  coordinate  the  provision  of  advisory  support  through \ntechnical assistance (TA) to best meet the Government\u2019s needs. \n \nC. \n \nSignificant  benefits  stem  from  the  DPL/DPSP  partnership.  Policy  triggers  were  defined \n4. \non  the  basis  of  mutual  trust  and  understanding  between  the  Government  and  the  three \ndevelopment partners, with a clear understanding of the direction of reforms, without excessive \nspecificity that would create political difficulties or compromise the flexibility of the Government \nin overcoming obstacles to reform. This was especially important in areas where the Executing \nAgency, the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (CMEA), or the agencies working most \nclosely  with  it\u2014MOF  and  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS)\u2014had  no \ndirect control over implementation of a particular reform, as other agencies or Parliament were \ninvolved. \n \n\nAchievements and Issues \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB did not provide financial support to the first DPL (DPL-1), which began in 2004, and a different title\u2013DPSP\u2013\nhas been adopted for ADB operations. The Correspondence between DPL and DPSP is as follows: DPL-1 = ADB's \nparticipation  through  policy  dialogue;  DPL-2  =  DPSP-1;  DPL-3  =  DPSP-2;  DPL-4  =  DPSP-3;  DPL-5  =  DPSP-4; \nDPL-6 = DPSP-5 \n\n2 The PFM Multi-Donor Trust Fund is funded by contributions from the European Commission (\u20ac 9.2million) and by \nthe  Government  of  the  Netherlands  ($6  million).    The  PNPM  Support  Facility  is  funded  by  contributions  from \nAusAid  ($4.2  million),  Danish  International  Development  Agency  ($10  million),  Department  for  International \nDevelopment ($5.5 million), and Government of the Netherlands ($37.3 million). \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nThe  DPL/DPSP  facility  provided  a  useful  platform  for  coordination  of  development \n5. \npartners'  policies  and  programs  in  related  areas,  enabling  a  consistent  approach  to  critical \nreform  issues.  The  support  by  Australia,  ADB,  the  Government  of  Japan,  and  World  Bank  for \nthe Public Expenditure Support Facility is a case in point.  Sharing of technical advisory support, \ninformation, and data also led to cooperation in other operational areas, notably in programs to \nsupport reforms for infrastructure development with parallel cofinancing from ADB, Government \nof Japan and World Bank. \n \nD.  \n \n6. \nThe  DPL/DPSP  process  and  multi-donor  trust  funds  have  enabled  the  Government  to \neffectively coordinate among development partners in the provision of assistance in some key \nreform  areas.    However,  formal  mechanisms  of  coordination  led  by  the  Government  in  more \nareas could serve to reduce transaction costs further and enhance coherence in development \nassistance.   \n \n\nSummary and Recommendations \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n55 \n\nKey Policy Areas \nof DPL/DPSP \nseries \nImproved \nInvestment Climate \n\nTable A6: Major Development Partners \n(Sector: Public sector management) \n(Themes: Economic growth, governance, capacity development) \n \nDevelopment \nPartner \nADB \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAustralia \n \nEU \n \nUSAID \n \nWorld Bank \n \n\n \n \nProgram Name \nFinancial Sector and Social Security Reform Program \n \nInfrastructure Reform Sector Development Program \nCluster:  \nSubprogram 1 \nSubprogram 2 \n \nCapital  Market  Development  Program  Cluster: \nSubprogram 1 \nSubprogram 2 \n \nEach of the above programs is supported by advisory \nand capacity development technical assistance. \n \nTechnical Assistance Management Facility III \n \nTrade Support Program II \n \nEconomic Growth Program \n \nThird Infrastructure Development Policy Loan  \n \nProject for Indonesia Tax Administration Reform \nState Audit Reform Sector Development Program \n \nSecond  Local  Government  Finance  and  Governance \nReform Program, Subprogram 1 \n \nEach  of  the  above  two  programs  is  supported  by \nadvisory  and \ntechnical \nassistance. \n \nGovernment Partnership Fund \n \n \nDemocracy and Governance Program \n \nGovernment  Financial  Management  and  Revenue \nAdministration Project \nPoverty  Reduction  and  Millennium  Development \nGoals Acceleration Program \n \nRural Infrastructure Support to PNPM Mandiri \n \nSecond Rural Areas Infrastructure Development \n \nKecamatan Development Project III (3A) \n \nKecamatan Development Project III (3B) \nADB= Asian Development Bank;

The exchange rate has weakened since last year, \ndriving  up  the  cost  of  foreign  debt  servicing,  and  unemployment  is  high,  which  will  adversely \nimpact the poverty rate.  \n \nThe crisis has fortunately been tempered by a decline in world oil prices. The decrease in \n3. \noil prices has resulted in a reduction of oil subsidies, providing more fiscal space in the budget to \ncounter the effects of the global economic downturn. Also, as a result of ongoing efforts among \nkey  stakeholders,  well-sustained  reforms  have  mitigated  the  impact  of  this  downturn  on  the \ncountry\u2019s  economy.  Nonetheless,  PFM  systems  in  the  country  now  face  unprecedented \nchallenges to ensure efficient and effective budget allocations and disbursements, in line with the \npolicy responses to the global and domestic economic turmoil.  \n \nIn  the  face  of  these  challenges,  the  commitment  of  key  stakeholders  in  the  budget \n4. \nprocess to vigorously pursuing the reform agenda remains unwavering and strong. The evolving \nagenda continues to be broad-based, comprising (i) improving results orientation in state budget \nplanning  and  development,  (ii)  improving  budget  and  treasury  management,  (iii)  strengthening \nimproving  public \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  of  public  expenditures  and  programs,  (iv) \nprocurement  systems,  and  (v)  improving  the  Government  accounting  and  audit  functions.  In \nsummary,  the  agenda  is  designed  to  improve  how  revenues  are  raised  and  how  funds  are \nallocated,  used,  and  accounted  for\u2014both  at  the  central  and  regional  levels.  PFM  improvement \ncontinues to be a key area of focus for DPL-6/DPSP-5, which will be a crucial instrument for the \nGovernment to flexibly, and in a self-determined fashion, underpin and flank its reform targets.  \n \n5. \nThe  following  assessment  draws  on  recent  economic  and  sector  work  undertaken  by \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  World  Bank,  and  other  development  partners.  A  public \nexpenditure  and  financial  accountability  assessment  was  concluded  in  June  2008.  In  addition, \nthis  assessment  has  taken  into  account  the  findings  of  a  joint  World  Bank\u2013IMF  mission  on \nstrengthening  budget  management  undertaken  in  June  2008,  the  results  of  a  previous  joint \nWorld Bank\u2014IMF mission on budget reform priorities reported to the Government in June 2007, \nthe  September  2008  update  of  the  Report  on  Observance  of  Standards  and  Codes  on  Fiscal \nTransparency in Indonesia from 2006,2 and an ADB sector report on accountability and audit in \nIndonesia.3  The  assessment  also  draws  on  the  ongoing  policy  dialogue  and  advisory  services \n\n                                                 \n1    Financial  Management  Reform  Committee.  2002.

The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  and  the  National  Development  Planning \nAgency  (BAPPENAS)  have  been  working  together  in  developing  a  road  map  for  the \nimplementation of PBB in Indonesia starting from 2009, as required in the State Finance Law. \n \n7. \nBased  on  the  PFM  reform  framework  as  legislated,  BAPPENAS  and  MOF  have  started \nrevising  the  existing  program  structure  used  for  planning  and  budgeting  purposes  to  align \nprograms  with  organizational  structures  and  with  the  development  agenda  defined  in  the \nMedium-Term  National  Development  Plan  (RPJM).  The  new  program  structure  will  be \nincorporated  in  the  RPJM  for  2010\u20132014,  and  is  intended  to  be  used  during  2010  for  the \npreparation of the 2011 budget.  \n \nThe budget and work plans of agencies (RKA-KL) are currently being revised to simplify \n8. \nbudget  submissions  and  link  them  more  closely  to  programs.  A  manual  on  planning  and \nbudgeting  for  restructuring  program  within  a  PBB  framework  has  been  finalized  by  the \nDirectorate  General  for  Budget  and  BAPPENAS,  and  has  been  issued  under  a  circular  signed \njointly by the Minister of Finance and the Minister for BAPPENAS. The contents and procedures \nof this manual are now being disseminated to all budget holders. It is anticipated that the reforms \nprescribed in the manual will be implemented in the 2011 budget preparation process. Forward \nestimates at the aggregate level, based on MTEF, were introduced in the 2008 and 2009 state \nbudgets. \n \n9. \nMOF is also in the process of building its capacity in strategic performance management \nbased on the \u201cbalanced scorecard\u201d performance management tool. The possibility of interfacing \nsome  balanced  scorecard  indicators  with  corresponding  PBB  indicators  being  developed  to \nmonitor and evaluate program implementation is being explored.  \n \n10. \nGenerally, a need still exists to deepen and sustain momentum in reforming Indonesia\u2019s \nbudget  system.  The  continuing  objective  is  to  make  state  budget  planning  and  development \nmore results-based, and to improve links between policy, planning, and budgeting in accordance \nwith the intent of the Law on State Finances. To this end, the Government\u2019s capability to assess \nthe impact of various policy decisions on key economic and fiscal indicators needs to be further \nenhanced. Also, staff in various ministries require more training in PBB and MTEF.  \n \n11. \nIn  terms  of  legislative  oversight,  the  House  of  Representatives'  (DPR's)  role  in  shaping \nthe  state  budget  and  fiscal  policy  has  been  institutionalized  by  law.  Budget  documentation  has \nalso improved significantly. The DPR\u2019s Budget Commission is currently discussing proposals to \nenact  a  new  law  defining  the  role  and  authority  of  DPR,  including  a  proposal  to  establish  a \nparliamentary budget office. \n\n                                                 \n4   World Bank. 2004.

Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n59 \n\nHowever,  the  DPR  continues  to  face  several  structural  challenges,  particularly  in  the \n12. \nareas  of  (i)  building  independent  support  and  research  capacity  to  support  legislative  budget \nreview;  (ii)  general  capacity  development  in  budget  analysis  and  oversight,  including  familiarity \nwith PBB and MTEF; and (iii) follow-up of external audit findings to ensure that the executive is \nheld  accountable  for  transparent  and  efficient  budget  execution.  Capacity  development  of  the \nDPR will thus remain an important reform goal.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImproving Budget and Treasury Management \n\nThe \n\nlatest  challenges \n\n \n13. \nThough  significant  advances  have  been  made  in  the  budget  preparation  side,  actual \nexpenditures  continue  to  deviate  from  plan.  Indonesia  thus  remains  committed  to  smoothing \nbudget implementation and execution through modernization of the treasury system. Most of the \nregulations  to  support  the  implementation  of  the  State  Treasury  Law  of  2004  have  been \nestablished,  while  others  are  being  finalized.  The  design  and  implementation  of  an  automated \ntreasury  and  budget  system  (SPAN)  is  ongoing.  SPAN,  as  a  crosscutting  reform,  will  increase \nthe  timeliness,  reliability,  and  transparency  of  budget  disbursement  and  reporting  as  well  as \nimprove  the  capability  of  managers  in  the  efficient  management  of  public  resources.  Business \nprocess improvements in the area of budget formulation and budget execution are underway and \nare  expected  to  be  completed  by  2011.  A  SPAN  turnkey  implementation  vendor  has  already \nbeen contracted (the contract was signed on 10 July 2009).  \n \n14. \nA  new  Treasury  Transformation  Directorate,  which  will  focus  on  SPAN  implementation, \nhas  been  established.  Ministerial  decrees  establishing  a  project  governance  system  for  SPAN \nhave been issued. SPAN is projected to become operational in the central treasury beginning in \n2011,  and  will  be  rolled  out  to  provincial  treasury  offices  (KPPNs)  and  pilot  line  ministries  in \n2012,  replacing  the  multitude  of  financial  data  processing  applications  currently  used  by \nGovernment institutions.  \n \ninclude  reviewing  and \n15. \nreformulating the chart of accounts, and strengthening MOF\u2019s capability to provide ICT services \nfor  SPAN.  The  capacity  development  needs  for  both  preparatory  and  implementation  activities \nunder SPAN will thus be considerable. It will be necessary to tap advisory services to facilitate \nthe implementation of treasury reforms in general, and SPAN in particular. Also, it is recognized \nthat  building  the  capacity  of  agencies  for  accounting  standards,  including  migration  to  accrual \naccounting, is a priority. \n \nCash  management  has  improved  significantly  with  the  continued  implementation  of  the \n16. \nTSA, and since 2007 TSA for expenditure management has been launched in all MOF Treasury \noffices.  An  annual  census  of  Government  bank  accounts  revealed  that  a  large  number  of \naccounts  were  still  outside  the  coverage  of  the  TSA,  and  that  the  TSA  arrangement  did  not \nadequately cover bank accounts used for revenue collection. The TSA is now being extended to \ncover  imprest  bank  accounts  currently  owned  by  budget  holders  for  petty  cash  and  salary \npayments.  The  extension  of  TSA  to  cover  revenue  bank accounts is being  rolled  out  from  July \n2009 to January 2010.  \n \n17. \nCash-flow forecasting has been rudimentary and the poor quality of cash forecasts is one \nof  the  factors  resulting  in  year-end  bunching  of  expenditures.  The  accelerated  drawdown  of \nGovernment  cash  balances  in  December  perpetuates  wasteful  procurement  practices  and  also \nimpacts monetary policy. The recently concluded joint World Bank\u2013International Monetary Fund \n(IMF)  assessment  of  the  Government\u2019s  asset  and  liabilities  management  indicated  that  the \nuncoordinated  management  of  the  gross  asset\u2013liability  portfolio  of  the  Government  and  Bank \n\nimplementing  SPAN \n\nfor  MOF \n\nin \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nIndonesia  could  lead  to  substantial  risk  to  the  overall  balance  sheet.  The  risks  need  to  be \nmitigated  through  optimization  of  borrowing  and  better  reserve  management.  Critical  TSA \nimplementation milestones have been incorporated as performance indicators in the DPL series. \n \n\n3. \n\nStrengthening Monitoring and Evaluation of Public Expenditures and \nPrograms \n\n \n18. \nTo  ensure  more  effective  public  spending,  improved  capacity  to  analyze  the  efficiency \nand  effectiveness  of  public  spending  is  essential.  BAPPENAS  recently  established  a  separate \ndepartment  and  designated  a  deputy  to  monitor  and  evaluate  public  expenditures.  Several \nanalytical pieces have been produced in the last few years, and efforts by BAPPENAS and MOF \nto  improve  the  quality  of  public  spending  by  improving  public  service  delivery  should  be \nbolstered.  \n \n19. \nThe  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  implementation  of  the  new  RPJM  will  require \nBAPPENAS  to  continue  to  expand  expenditure  analyses  at  the  sector  level  (e.g.,  education, \nhealth,  agriculture,  and  infrastructure).  A  deeper  understanding  of  spending  in  different  sectors \nshould  also  enhance  the  general  capacity  of  BAPPENAS  and  line  agencies  to  implement \nperformance-based budgeting.  \n \n\n4. \n\nImproving the Public Procurement System \n\n \n20. \nPresidential  Decree  80/2003  provided  a  national  public  procurement  regulation  that \nmeets  most  of  what  is  generally  regarded  as  accepted  international  practice,  including \ntransparency,  open  competition,  economy,  and  efficiency.  This  decree  also  paved  the  way  for \nestablishing  a  regulatory  body  for  public  procurement.  With  the  introduction  of  Presidential \nDecree 80/2003, a previous certification (\u201cpre-qualification\u201d) process for suppliers and providers \nof  goods  and  services  was,  in  most  instances,  abandoned  by  the  Government.  Presidential \nDecree 80/2003 also established the basis for sanctions and for complaint handling, and laid out \nrequirements for certification of users. In December 2007 an independent agency, the National \nPublic Procurement Agency (LKPP), that is responsible for sustainable, integrated, focused, and \ncoordinated  planning  and  development  of  strategies,  policies,  and  regulations  associated  with \nthe  procurement  of  goods,  works,  and  services  using  public  funds,  was  established.  This \ninstitution  reports  directly  to  the  President  of  Indonesia.  In  addition  to  the  chair,  who  heads \nLKPP,  and  an  executive  secretary,  there  are  four  departments,  each  headed  by  a  deputy  with \nresponsibilities for (i) strategy and policy development, (ii) monitoring evaluation and information \nsystems, (iii) human resources development, and (iv) legal affairs and settlement of objections. \nThe LKPP is currently operational with plans for further staffing. \n \n21.  While  Presidential  Decree  80/2003  was  a  welcome  development  for  the  country,  the \npublic  procurement  system  still  has  significant  regulatory  and  implementation  deficiencies. \nProgress has been slow in developing solid procurement regulations, standard tools for bidding \ndocuments, and procurement guidelines. Collusion and corruption in the bidding process as well \nas  concerns  over  the  efficiency  of  complaint  mechanisms  and  sanction  measures  are  still \nsignificant.  However,  the  most  glaring  deficiency  is  the  absence  of  professional  procurement \nmanagement  and  weak  procurement  capacity  in  the  implementing  agencies,  especially  at  the \nprovincial and district levels. \n \n22. \nThe existence of these deficiencies is supported by the findings of various analytical tools \nand  reports,  such  as  the  self-diagnostic  assessment  conducted  by  the  Government  in  2007, \nwhich used a baseline indicators tool developed under the World Bank and OECD Development \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n61 \n\nThe LKPP is currently moving on parallel tracks to reform the public procurement system \n\nAssistance  Committee  Procurement  Round  Table  initiative.  The  assessment  of  the  baseline \nindicators presents a \u201csnapshot\u201d comparison of the actual system against international standards \nor  the  \u201cmodel  system\u201d  that  the  baseline  indicators  represent.  Baseline  benchmarking  of \nIndonesia\u2019s  procurement  system  in  June  2007  showed  it  scoring  62.5%  for  the  legislative  and \nregulatory framework (pillar I), 55% for institutional framework and management capacity (pillar \nII), 59.3% for procurement operations and market practices (pillar III) and 69% for integrity and \ntransparency  of  the  public  procurement  system  (pillar  IV).5  While  the  establishment  of  LKPP \nwould improve the score for pillar II, the baseline assessment indicates that many areas would \nstill need further improvement. \n \n23. \nas follows: \n \n24. \nLegislative  and  regulatory  framework.  The  LKPP  is  currently  working  on  two  tracks: \npreparation  of  a  new  procurement  law,  and  revision  of  Presidential  Decree  80/2003.  The \npreparation  and  enactment  of  a  new  procurement  law  may  be  a  lengthy  process,  slowed  by \nsignificant  stakeholder  consultation  processes  and  consensus  building  efforts  aimed  at \novercoming  possible  opposition  from  interest  groups.  As  an  interim  measure,  LKPP  is  in  the \nprocess  of  reviewing  Presidential  Decree  80/2003.  The  main  purpose  of  this  review  is  to \nreorganize it into different sections dealing with specific topics and to mandate use of a new set \nof standard bidding documents. This process is behind schedule because of the methodology of \nwork being carried through a committee, which generates lengthy discussions and necessitates \nconsensus building. LKPP has prepared a draft of the revised Presidential Decree 80/2003 and \npresented  it  to  key  development  partners  for  review.  The  draft  will  then  be  submitted  for \ninterministerial  review.  Having  a  revised  presidential  decree  and  its  potential  endorsement  this \nyear would represent an important reform step that could lead to changes in the way the 2010 \nbudget is implemented.  \n \nThe country currently lacks national standard bidding documents that are used regularly \n25. \nby all government agencies. Some implementing agencies (such as the Ministry of Public Works) \nhave  developed  standard  bidding  documents  for  their  own  use.  The  predecessor  of  LKPP, \nthrough the support of ADB, drafted eight national model (standard) bidding documents including \n(i)  an  explanatory  guide,  (ii)  goods  with  prequalification,  (iii)  goods  with  postqualification,  (iv) \nworks  with  prequalification, \n(vi)  other  services  with \nprequalification, (vii) other services with postqualification, and (viii) consulting services. The use \nof these documents is still not mandatory and they are being used on a pilot basis. It is important \nfor LKPP to collect final comments from users on these documents, improve them, and mandate \ntheir  use  nationally.  One  improvement  would  be  to  harmonize  such  documents  with  those  of \ninternational  development  partners \nInternational \nDevelopment (AusAID), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) , and the World Bank. \n \n26. \nThe  approach  of  LKPP  toward  preparing  a  procurement  law  and  reviewing  Presidential \nDecree 80/2003 will ensure phased progress toward meeting the Government's agenda, taking \ninto  account  coordination  among  different  agencies  (LKPP,  ministries,  Parliament,  etc.).  To \nmaximize  the  opportunity  for  reform  when  preparing  the  procurement  law,  it  is  important  to \nconsider that a number of laws have been enacted since 2000 that impact, or make reference to, \npublic procurement. These include a construction law, as well as laws on state finance, treasury, \naudit, and small-scale business. The pace of Indonesia\u2019s decentralization reforms has impacted \n\n(v)  works  with  postqualification, \n\nthe  Australian  Agency \n\nlike  ADB, \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n5 The indicators suggest, for example, that 69% of the standards for integrity and transparency were achieved. \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\npublic  sector  procurement  at  all  levels  of  Government,  with  ministers,  governors,  and  even \nmayors able to issue decrees, regulations, and instructions.  \n \n27. \nThe  regulations  are  often  inconsistent  and  some  do  not  meet  accepted  international \npractice.  Consequently,  national  procurement  reform  and  the  need  for  national  procurement \npolicies and standards are critical. Indonesia\u2019s legal framework for public sector procurement can \nbest  be  strengthened  by  anchoring  it  with  an  overarching  consolidated  and  comprehensive \nnational  public  sector  procurement  law  at  the  highest  level  that  (i) establishes  the  fundamental \nprinciples  and  procedures  applicable  to  all  public  sector  procurement,  (ii)  establishes  clear \nresponsibilities  for  a  permanent  procurement  management  function  within  implementing \nagencies,  (iii)  amends  other  laws  that  refer  to  public  sector  procurement  and  ensures  that  the \nnew law has the necessary authority in a decentralized environment. In the meantime, the review \nof Presidential Decree 80/2003 should attempt to address some of these issues.  \n \n28. \nPublic procurement function and capacity building. There has been growing concern, \nboth  in  the  Government  and  among  international  development  partners,  over  the  pace  of \nimplementation  of  development  projects.  Significant  delays  and  slow  disbursement  plague  the \nentire  PFM  cycle.  Projects  report  delays  and  difficulties  in  budget  preparation  and  approval, \nbudget execution, and procurement. Specifically, concerns have arisen over the organization of \nthe  procurement  management  function  and  the  capacity  of  procurement  committee  members. \nWhile Presidential Decree 80/2003 requires certification of all procurement committee members, \nthe current certification process does not support the development of procurement capacity and \nthe  current  ad  hoc  nature  of  procurement  management  inhibits  the  buildup  of  sustainable \nknowledge within implementing agencies. \n \n29. \nLKPP is currently conducting a survey to identify deficiencies in the procurement process \nand determine the various levels of competency required for carrying out procurement tasks. It is \nalso in the process of recruiting a long-term international expert to support the development of a \nnational  strategy  on  capacity  development  in  procurement.  In  addition,  LKPP  is  developing \ndifferent models for introducing central procurement units at ministries and local governments. \n \n30. \nIn  summary,  several  procurement  reform  initiatives  are  underway,  but  progress  in \nprocurement  reform  has  nonetheless  been  slow.  The  absence  of  professional  procurement \nmanagers  in  implementing  agencies,  fragmentation  of  procurement  responsibility,  and  weak \nprocurement capacity are the most important impediments. LKPP should focus its resources on \ndeveloping a human resources strategy that can tackle the challenges in this area. The capacity \nof Government auditing agencies to carry out procurement audits must be strengthened. Another \nimportant  goal  should  be  to  develop  a  set  of  performance  indicators  to  monitor  procurement \nperformance within implementing agencies.  \n \nCorruption, sanctions, and independent appeals mechanism. Key reforms that would \n31. \nimprove  the  transparency  of  the  procurement  system  include  establishment  of  an  independent \ncomplaints mechanism, establishment of an effective sanctions mechanism, and implementation \nof e-procurement.  \n \n32. \nthe  establishment  of  a  complaint-handling \nmechanism.  However,  this  is  not  set  up  independently  but  within  each  implementing  agency. \nLKPP  is  now  in  the  process  of  finalizing  its  strategy  for  complaint  handling.  It  is  currently \nweighing different modalities for managing complaint handling and the role of LKPP. While it is \nimperative  to  develop  procedures  for  an  independent  complaint-handling  mechanism,  LKPP \n\nPresidential  Decree  80/2003  requires \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n63 \n\nshould avoid becoming the agency to which these complaints are addressed, but rather develop \na system and monitor its efficiency and reliability.  \n \n33. \nThe  sanctions  mechanism  is  operated  by  each  implementing  agency  according  to \nPresidential  Decree  80/2003  requirements.  The  effectiveness  of  this  system  is  unclear;  an \nassessment of the mechanism, to be conducted by LKPP, is therefore warranted.  \n \n34. \nE-procurement. The LKPP is currently taking the lead on behalf of the Government for \nimplementing  e-government  procurement  in  Indonesia  at  the  national  and  subnational  levels. \nThe Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Communications and Information, and City of Surabaya \nare  at  the  forefront  of  the  drive  to  develop  e-government  procurement  technology.  The  critical \nissue  now  is  developing  a  road  map  for  expanding  e-government  procurement  in  the  country. \nThe road map should establish roles for different stakeholders to define core data standards for \nthe various e-government procurement providers to comply with. \n \n\n5. \n\nImproving Government Accounting and Audit Functions  \n\n \n35. \nAccounting  and  reporting  on  budget  execution.  Even  though  the  aggregate \nGovernment  annual  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  a  timely  manner  since  2004, \nthey continue to receive a \u201cdisclaimer\u201d audit opinion from external auditors. One of the reasons \ncited  for  the  \u201cdisclaimer\u201d  opinion  is  weak  internal  control  in  the  preparation  of  financial \nstatements.  Improving  the  quality  of  financial  statements  is  thus  an  important  priority  for  the \nGovernment. \n \nCapacity  constraints  in the  line  ministries  are  the  biggest  challenge  to  improve  financial \n36. \nstatements. Line ministries and subnational governments have few trained accountants and the \nquality of their work needs improvement. The Directorate General for Treasury has an ambitious \ntraining program in place that aims to train at least one person for each of the country\u2019s 22,000 or \nso  satkers  (spending  units)  by  2010.  About  9,000  people  have  been  trained  so  far,  and  the \nremaining  officials  are  expected  to  be  trained  by  2010.  However,  this  is  only  a  short-term \nsolution; in the long term, sustained and continuous training of line ministry staff is needed. The \nEducation  and  Training  Unit  within  MOF  is  considering  a  plan  for  working  with  regional \nuniversities to institute  a long-term program for training accountants. However, the plans are at \nan early stage at this point.  \n \n37. \nA plan is in place to move from cash-based accounting to full accrual accounting for line \nministries  and  subnational  governments  by  2014.  The  accounting  standards  for  accrual \naccounting have already been drafted and are currently undergoing a review.  \n \n38. \ninternal  audit.  The  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial \nAccountability assessment of 2008 identifies weaknesses in internal controls as a significant risk \nto  reforms  introduced  in  other  areas  of  PFM.  The  internal  audit  function  in  the  country  is \nclassified as fragmented and characterized by weak capacity.  \n \n39. \nThe key reform priorities in the area of internal control and internal audit are (i) rollout of \nSPAN;  (ii)  implementation  of  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organization  (COSO)6  framework;  and \n(iii) strengthening of internal audit function of the Government.  \n\nInternal  controls  and \n\n                                                 \n6   The  COSO  framework  was  developed  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organization  of  the  Treadway \nCommission\u2014a nonprofit entity established in 1992, which established a common definition of internal control and a \nframework for evaluating its effectiveness. \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nThe rollout of SPAN, targeted for 2011, will strengthen internal controls by introducing a \n40. \nformal  commitment  control  system  in  the  line  ministries,  ensuring  adherence  to  the  budget \nceilings and reducing time lags in processing payments and budget revisions. Limited capacity in \nMOF and other line ministries and ownership of the program are key challenges.  \n \n41. \nThrough Government Regulation (PP) 60/2008, the Government has adopted COSO as \nits  internal  control  framework.  However,  implementing  the  regulation  has  proved  challenging. \nThe Government regulation entrusts the Financial and Development Supervisory Board (BPKP) \nwith  designing  the  internal  control  implementation,  as  well  as  with  providing  guidance  to  and \ntraining the line ministries on COSO. In June 2009, BPKP and MOF organized COSO workshops \nto help managers and auditors gain a better understanding of the concepts and implementation \nexperiences related to COSO. BPKP is in the process of preparing an ambitious strategic plan \nfor  COSO  implementation,  which  may  start  through  some  pilots.  Limited  capacity  at  BPKP  in \nimplementing major reforms and limited interest from the management of line ministries remain \nsignificant  challenges.  As  part  of  its  implementation  strategy,  BPKP  is  seeking  the  support  of \nexpert staff to meet these challenges. However, implementation of COSO is currently only at the \nplanning stage; implementation on a pilot basis may begin in 2010.  \n \n42. \nPP  60/2008  also  gives  BPKP  a  mandate  to  strengthen  the  internal  audit  function  in  the \ncountry, which is currently fragmented and suffers from a serious lack of capacity. The quality of \naudit  by  inspector  generals  in  line  ministries  and  regional  supervision  agencies  (Bawasdas)  in \nlocal governments remains suboptimal, with little focus on risk-based auditing. A peer review of \nBPKP  in  2008  concluded  that  even  though  BPKP  follows  international  standards  of  auditing, \nweaknesses exist in practice. BPKP has drawn up an action plan to address those weaknesses. \nA lack of trained and skilled auditors and the sheer size of the country (Bawasda auditors are in \nmore  than  500  locations)  make  the  task  of  reforming  the  internal  audit  function  especially \nchallenging.  \n \nExternal audit. The Supreme Audit Agency (BPK) has a mandate to audit all government \n43. \nentities,  including  state-owned  enterprises,  and  has  grown  considerably  since  2004  in  terms  of \nits  budget,  the  number  of  regional  offices,  and  the  number  of  auditors  it  employs.7  The  main \npriority  at  this  point  is  technical  capacity  building  of  BPK  staff.  ADB  has  been  supporting  BPK \nthrough its State Audit Reform Project. \n \n44. \nBPK  performs  financial,  performance,  and  special-purpose  audits.  The  audits  are \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  BPK  auditing  standards,  which  are  generally  in  line  with \ninternational  auditing  standards.  The  agency  has  an  arrangement  with  National  Audit  Office \n(NAO)  Australia  on  technical  skills  transfer  in  performance  auditing,  and  has  benefited  from  \ntraining programs and from a staff exchange program with NAO.  \n \nBPK has managed to submit audited financial statements within 5 months of the end of \n45. \nthe fiscal year for the past 5 years. It also submits interim audit reports to the Parliament every 6 \nmonths.  \n \n46. \nBPK  is  currently  undergoing  a  peer  review  with  the  Dutch  Supreme  Audit  Agency.  The \nreview is expected to identify critical areas for the development of the institution. BPK expects to \ndraw up a comprehensive institutional development plan based on the results of the peer review, \nwhich will be available in late 2009.  \n\n                                                 \n7   The number of BPK staff has risen from 2,854 in 2004 to 4,382 in 2008. The annual budget for 2009 is Rp1.7 trillion, \n\ncompared with Rp234 billion in 2004. The number of regional offices has risen from 7 in 2004 to 33 in 2009. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n65 \n\n6. \n\nReforming Regional Public Financial Management \n\n \n47. \nDecentralization  has  provided  subnational  governments  with  significant  resources  and \nresponsibilities.  More  than  one-third  of  public  spending  is  now  executed  by  subnational \ngovernments. This level of expenditure requires an adequate regulatory framework, together with \nsufficient PFM capacity, at the subnational level if it is to be fully effective. To address this need, \nin  2005  the  central  Government  passed  comprehensive  legislation  on  PFM  reform  at  the \nsubnational  level,  with  the  aim  of  mirroring  reforms  already  being  implemented  at  the  national \nlevel. However, most regions lack the technical and human resource capacity to implement the \nreforms.  For  example,  subnational  governments  are  obliged  by  law  to  report  certain  fiscal  and \nfinancial  information  to  the  central  Government  within  a  clear  time  frame.  In  reality,  many \nsubnational governments struggle to meet their deadlines for submission. \n \n48. \nCurrent budget allocation and disbursement practices contribute to fiscal discipline at the \ncentral  level  but  constrain  successful  financial  management  at  the  local  level.  Allocations  to \nindividual  subnational  governments  are  formally  issued  after  the  passage  of  the  central \nGovernment  budget  in  October  for  the  following  year,  and  commence  through  derivative \nregulations  (e.g.,  ministerial  decrees).  While  this  may  appear  to  allow  sufficient  time  for \nsubnational governments to finalize their budgets, in reality budget allocations of shared, non-tax \nrevenue  (oil  and  gas)  are  frequently  issued  in  the  first  few  months  of  the  fiscal  year.  The \nallocations  are  frequently  underestimated  by  the  central  Government  and  disbursements  from \nthe center to the regions are back-loaded toward the end of the fiscal year. This is because the \ntransfers  in  the  final  quarter  are  based  on  actual  revenues,  which  are  usually  higher  than \nprojected revenues. \n \n49. \nSubnational governments are struggling to spend their increased budgets and have built \nup  reserves  in  recent  years  for  three  main  reasons.  First,  they  often  underestimate  their \nrevenues because they lack revenue management capacity. This is compounded by the Central \nGovernment\u2019s under-budgeting of transfers. Second, delays in the budget approval process and \nlack  of  implementation  capacity  result  in  under-spending  of  budgeted  programs  by  subnational \ngovernments. Third, subnational governments may not have the capacity to spend the resources \nat  their  disposal  when  these  resources  increase  significantly  and  abruptly.  This  was  the  case \nwith the 64% increase in \"general allocation funds\" from 2005 to 2006, which led to a significant \nincrease in subnational government reserves. \n \n50. \nSome  challenges  in  addressing  PFM  constraints  at  the  subnational  level  include:  (i) \nproviding  timely  estimates  from  the  sectoral  ministries  of  revenue-sharing  transfers;  (ii) building \nthe  capacity  of  subnational  governments  to  manage  accumulated  reserves;  and  (iii) improving \nand  streamlining  the  budget  approval  process.  The  need  to  streamline  the  budget  approval \nprocess  in  particular  affects  Law  No.  33/2004,  which  stipulates  that  provincial  and  district \nbudgets must be approved by the Ministry of Home Affairs and the provincial government. This \nprocess may be one factor that lengthens the budget approval process. \n \n51. \ncentral Government has implemented several reforms: \n \n52. \n\u201cBurden-sharing  policy.\u201d  Introduced  in  2009,  this  policy  incorporates  major  subsidies, \nincluding fuel subsidies, into the \"general allocation funds\". The policy will increase the accuracy \nof transfer projections during the full fiscal year, given that there is a disincentive for the central \nGovernment  to  underestimate  the  oil  price  assumption,  especially  in  relation  to  regional \n\nTo address the financial management issues and challenges at the subnational level, the \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\ntransfers.  A  more  rational  oil  price assumption will  lead  to better  estimates  of  revenue  sharing, \nwhich in turn will help subnational governments better plan their budgets.  \n \n53. \nTwo  actions  are  needed  to  optimize  this  policy.  First,  the  central  Government  should \nestablish a system to regularly monitor quarterly revenue-sharing transfers, as stipulated in Law \nNo. 33/2004. Second, the central Government, through the relevant agencies, needs to improve \nproduction  estimates  for  revenue  sharing,  especially  if  back-loaded  transfers  at  the  end  of  the \nfiscal year persist.  \n \n54. \nLate budget approval sanctions. Since 2008 the Government has applied sanctions to \nimprove the budget approval process. Based on Government Regulation (PP) No. 56/2005 and \nMOF  Decree  No.  46/2006  regarding  the  regional  financial  information  system,  provincial  and \ndistrict governments have to submit their annual budgets to MOF before 31 January of the fiscal \nyear. Subnational governments that miss the deadline by at least 1 month will receive a warning \nletter to submit their budget before 31 March. If a subnational government has not submitted its \nbudget  by  that  date,  MOF,  in  coordination  with  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  can  sanction  the \nsubnational  government  by  postponing  the  transfer  of  its  \"general  allocation  funds\"  (25%  of \nmonthly transfers) until the budget is submitted. This initiative has resulted in more timely budget \nsubmissions. Between 2006 and 2007, 54% of subnational governments approved their budgets \nafter  March.  In  2008,  the  year  the  sanction  was  introduced,  87%  of  subnational  governments \nsubmitted their budgets to MOF before March.  \n \n55.  MOF  can  also  assist  subnational  governments  in  managing  reserves  and  surpluses  by \nstrengthening the regulatory framework for subnational financial management. In doing so, MOF \nshould  develop  guidelines  for  regions  on  accumulating  and  using  reserves.  These  guidelines \nshould  help  subnational  governments  use  their  reserves  more  effectively,  for  example,  by  (i) \nsettling outstanding arrears, given that about 85% of subnational governments in  arrears could \nclear  these  arrears  by  drawing  on  reserves;  and  (ii)  where  subnational  governments  have \nconstant  or  increasingly  high  levels  of  reserves,  using  them  to  increase  investment  in  public \ninfrastructure.  \n \n\n7. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption \n\n \n56. \nPublic  confidence  in  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  combat  corruption  has  been  slowly \nrestored  over  the  past  few  years,  as  reflected  in  a  number  of  opinion  polls  and  corruption \nperception surveys. The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) continues to take the lead in \ninvestigating and prosecuting high-profile corruption cases. At an unprecedented level, politicians \nand  high-ranking  government  officials  are  under  investigation  or  have  been  convicted  of \ncorruption, including members of Parliament, the former national police chief, former governors \nand officials of the central bank, and heads of local government. Even after the recent arrest for \nmurder  of  the  chair  of  the  commission,  the  KPK  has  been  proving  its  effectiveness  as  an \nindependent  law  enforcement  agency.  The  Attorney  General\u2019s  Office  has  also  created  an \nanticorruption task force to more effectively investigate and prosecute corruption.  \n \n57. \nApart  from  stronger  enforcement  of  anticorruption  laws,  civil  service  reform  and  judicial \nreform  are  the  linchpins  of  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  to  combat  corruption.  The  Government \nplans to expand ongoing civil service reform efforts to other agencies under the leadership of the \nMinistry  of  State  Apparatus  Reform.  While  the  ministry  still  lacks  the  capability  to  monitor, \nevaluate,  and  drive  bureaucracy  reform,  government  agencies  are  undertaking  significant \nreforms.  The  Supreme  Court,  in  particular,  has  undergone  significant  restructuring,  and  as  a \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n67 \n\nKey Areas for Future Attention \n\nresult  the  quality  of  its decisions  has  improved.  The  majority  of  Supreme  Court  decisions  have \nreinforced a strong stance against corruption. \n \nC. \n \n58. \nclosely monitored: \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nIn the period ahead, progress on the following key ongoing PFM reforms will need to be \n\nEnsuring coherence and momentum in PFM reform.  \nDeepening  the  reforms  of  central  Government  budgetary  systems  to  ensure \nresults-orientation in budget formulation and execution. \nEnsuring  greater  integrity  and  more  effective  management  of  public  funds  by \nimplementing  a  TSA,  automating  the  treasury  payments  system,  and  instituting \nmeasures to prevent the proliferation of off-budget bank accounts. \nImplementing  a  new  budget  and  treasury  system,  extending  implementation  of \ngovernment  accounting  standards,  and  reengineering  underlying  business \nprocesses  at  spending  agencies  to  ensure  relevant  and  reliable  financial \nreporting. \nExtending  modern \nto \nsubnational governments in a coordinated manner, and bringing these fully in line \nwith emerging national standards.  \nImproving  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  capacity  of  BAPPENAS  by  expanding \nexpenditure analysis at the sector level and developing a deeper understanding of \nspending at the sector level. \n\nfinancial  accountability  and  management  processes \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii)  Creating  a  road  map  for  the  development  of  e-government  procurement  in  the \ncountry,  defining  the  roles  of  the  different  stakeholders  and  ensuring  minimum \ninteroperability  and  core  data  standards \nthe  various  e-government \nprocurement providers to comply with.  \n\nfor \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Designing  a  human  resources  strategy  to  tackle  challenges  in  procurement \nreform, such as instituting a permanent procurement management function in line \nministries and agencies, developing a sustainable capacity-building program, and \nsupporting training institutions in universities and the private sector.  \nContinuing  to  improve  human  resource  capacity  in  the  area  of  government \naccounting and reporting.  \nPreparing  a  strategic  plan  for  COSO  implementation,  which  may  start  through \nsome pilots.   \nStrengthening  the  internal  audit  function  in  the  country  by  modernizing  internal \ninternal  audit  staff,  and \naudit \nestablishing synergistic relationships between the BPKP, inspector generals, and \nBawasdas. \n\ninstitutions,  providing \n\nintensive \n\ntraining \n\n(xi) \n\n(x) \n\nto \n\n(xii)  Continued strengthening of BPK through technical assistance.  \n(xiii) \n\nImproving  the  management  of  reserves  and  surpluses  by  strengthening  the \nregulatory framework for subnational governments' financial management.  \n(xiv)  Continuing  to  monitor  subnational  governments'  budget  submissions  and  the \n\n(xv) \n\nimplementation of sanctions for late performers. \nExpediting  the  process  of  budget  approval  by  streamlining  Law  No.  33/2004, \nwhich  currently  requires  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  to  approve  provincial  and \ndistrict budgets.  \n\n(xvi)  Promulgating  a  law  on  the  special  powers  of  KPK,  the  powers  of  the \n\nanticorruption court, and the role of non-career or ad hoc judges.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nimplemented, \n\nIndonesia.  The  main \n\nManagement of Foreign Exchange \n\nThe  Government  is  actively  considering  and/or  prioritizing  many  of  these  reforms.  The \n59. \ncapacity  to  centrally  monitor  these  and  other  reforms  has  recently  been  established  at  the \nsecretary  general\u2019s  office  of  MOF.  Indonesia  would  benefit  from  a  coherent  reform  plan  or \nstrategy  to  ensure  proper  phasing  and  coordination  of  PFM  reforms.  This  would  also  allow  for \nenhanced  monitoring  and  accountability  within  the  Government  and  thus  provide  additional \nmomentum and direction to reform efforts. \n \nD. \n \n60. \nThe foreign exchange control environment is assessed to be generally satisfactory. The \ncountry  graduated  from  the  IMF  program  in  2003.  Bank  Indonesia  was  last  subject  to  the \ntransitional procedures under the IMF's safeguards assessment policy in 2002. That assessment \nrecommended  remedial  action  to  address  several  vulnerabilities  in  the  audit  arrangements  of \nBank \nthe \nrecommendations  have  been \nestablishment of an independent audit committee at Bank Indonesia and the publication of Bank \nIndonesia\u2019s  audited  financial  statements.  Audited  financial  statements  for  Bank  Indonesia  for \n2008  have  been  reviewed  and  the  audit  report  issued  by  the  BPK  contained  an  \"unqualified\" \nopinion. \n \nE. \n \n61. \nIndonesia has established a sound legal and administrative framework for modern PFM. \nChanges  in  the  legal  and  regulatory  architecture  are  now  largely  complete  and  the  momentum \nhas shifted toward implementation. \n \n62. \nKnown weaknesses in financial management and accountability continue to be gradually \naddressed  through  the  PFM  reform  program  discussed  above.  The  development  partners  are \nactively engaged in this process. Key elements of the reforms are supported by the DPL/DPSP \ntriggers, as well as by other development partner programs. However, much remains to be done, \nand it will take time to realize the full impact of these reforms.  \n \n63.  Meanwhile,  some  fiduciary  risks  will  arise  for  this  operation.  Although  the  pace  of \nimplementing  the  planned  reforms  has  been  somewhat  slow,  the  trajectory  of  reform  is  in  the \nright  direction  and  the  Government  continues  to  demonstrate  a  commitment  to  complete  the \nplanned  PFM  reforms.  Taking  this  into  consideration,  the  DPL/DPSP  series\u2019  development \npartners do not propose putting in place any additional fiduciary arrangements for this operation. \n\nConclusion \n\nincluding \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n69 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: Indonesia: Fifth Development Policy Support Program (DPSP-5) \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\nPolicy-Based \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nSoutheast Asia Department (SERD) \nIndonesia Resident Mission (IRM) \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nBefore the Asian financial crisis, Indonesia had been successful in fighting poverty. The poverty rate\u2014the proportion of \nthe  population  living  below  $1/day\u2014was  reduced  from  44%  (1976)  to  11%  (1996).  However,  the  economic  crisis  in \n1997 increased the poverty rate to 23.6% in 1998. With successful macroeconomic management following the crisis, \npoverty  incidence  steadily  declined  to  15.4%  by  2008.  Although  the  decline  of  the  $1/day  poverty  rate  is  considered \nremarkable,  close  to  half  of  the  population  still  lives  below  the  $2/day  international  poverty  line  (2008).  Disparities \nacross  regions  are  striking,  as  provinces  in  outlying  regions  have  poverty  rates  that  are  well  above  the  national \naverage.  \n  \nThe Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJM) for 2005\u20132009 focuses on poverty reduction and the achievement of the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  Its  priority  areas  include  (i)  job  creation  and  poverty  reduction  programs; \n(ii) macroeconomic  stability  with  stable  prices,  fiscal  sustainability,  and  financial  sector  reforms;  (iii)  accelerating \ninvestments, exports, and tourism through reforms for  a  healthy  business climate and flexible markets; (iv) improved \naccess  to  and  quality  of  education  and  health;  and  (v)  infrastructure  development  by  improving  the  efficiency  in \ndelivering existing services and by greater private sector participation. \n \nIn August 2006, the Government launched the National Program for Community Empowerment (PNPM Mandiri), which \nbuilds  upon  Indonesia\u2019s  accumulated  experience  with  community-driven  development  (CDD)  programs.  The  PNPM \naims  to  reduce  poverty  by  (i)  promoting  community  participation  in  development  planning  and  management, \n(ii) delivering basic services and infrastructure using the CDD approach, and (iii) committing to expand coverage of the \nprogram to all kecamatans (6,627) by 2010. DPSP-5 is in line with ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program for Indonesia \nfor  the  period  2006\u20132009,  which  aims  to  help  the  government  achieve  its  medium-term  RPJM  objectives  of  higher \nlevels of pro-poor sustainable growth and achieving the MDGs. \n  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1. Key Issues  \n \nIndonesia\u2019s poverty reduction strategy paper identified four major causes of poverty, including (i) lack of access to key \nsocial services; (ii) absence of economic opportunities, particularly in rural areas; (iii) poor infrastructure in villages; and \n(iv) inadequate access to markets. In addition, weak governance hampers further progress in addressing these major \ncauses of poverty. The National Poverty Reduction Strategy considers macroeconomic stability as the foundation for \nreducing poverty and includes five basic strategies for poverty reduction: (i) broadening income-earning opportunities, \n(ii) empowering community institutions, (iii) increasing capacity at the local levels, (iv) providing social protection, and \n(v) promoting global partnerships. \n  \n2. Design Features. Not applicable \n\nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nDPSP-5 aims to contribute to higher pro-poor economic growth that is sustained over the medium term through three \ncore  policy  areas:  (i) improved  investment  climate,  (ii)  improved  public  financial  management  and  governance,  and \n(iii) enhanced efforts to alleviate poverty. \n \nThe majority of triggers under the first two core policy areas will not directly affect the income level of poor households. \nHowever,  it  is  expected  that  improving  the  investment  climate  and  public  financial  management  and  governance  in \ngeneral will contribute to improved business opportunities in the informal sector, which employs about two-thirds of the \nlabor force and provides the most important income earning prospects for the poor.  \n \nThe  third  policy  area  aims  to  strengthen  poverty  targeting  in  determining  the  size  of  community  block  grants  to \nsubdistricts under the PNPM program, and to increase the average size of the block grant for the poorest subdistricts. \nImproving  the  poverty  targeting  of  the  PNPM  block  grants  will  have  unambiguously  beneficial  effects  on  the  poor\u2014\nparticularly  on  poor  living  in  isolated  villages  in  less-developed  districts  that  lack  basic  services  and  infrastructure. \nAdditional  support  to  improve  basic  infrastructure  in  villages  that  have  higher-than-average  poverty  levels  will  help \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nincrease the availability and accessibility of education and health services and improve income earning opportunities. \nCommunity  investments  under  PNPM  are  expected  to  (i)  reduce  the  time  and  costs  spent  on  obtaining  good  quality \nwater, (ii) diminish the incidence and severity of waterborne diseases, (iii) increase the availability and accessibility of \neducation and health services for the rural poor and near poor, (iv) improve access to services and markets, and (v) \nprovide income earning opportunities and welfare through increased employment and trade. Support to build capacity \nof local administrations and communities to plan, implement, and manage infrastructure investments will promote good \ngovernance at the local level. More efficient and equitable provision of services to the poorest villages will contribute to \nhealth- and education-related MDGs. \n  \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nAs discussed above, the reforms under the first two core policy areas will have only indirect impacts on the welfare of \npoor  people.  Improving  poverty  targeting  of  the  PNPM  program  and  increasing  the  size  of  block  grants  for \ninfrastructure  investments  in  the  poorest  subdistricts  will  contribute  to  improved  living  conditions  of  the  poor. \nInfrastructure investments in poor rural areas will improve access to social services and accelerate social development. \n \nBetter targeting of PNPM support to improve basic infrastructure in poor villages will contribute to addressing the major \ncauses  of  poverty  as  identified  in  the  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  paper,  including  (i)  lack  of  access  to  key \nsocial  services,  (iii)  poor  infrastructure  in  villages,  and  (iv)  inadequate  links  to  markets.  Indonesia\u2019s  infrastructure \nprovision in poor rural areas is weak by regional standards. Electrification rates are the lowest in the region, while road \nnetworks are limited and in  poor condition. People living  in isolated areas  with poor market links lack  both economic \nopportunities and adequate levels of service delivery. More than 15% of all Indonesian villages are inaccessible all year \nround. Lack of access to quality education significantly decreases productivity, employment opportunities, and personal \nincome.  Investments  in  transportation  infrastructure,  agricultural  infrastructure  (irrigation),  and  education  and  health \nfacilities can significantly improve living conditions in remote areas, create the basis for economic growth, and improve \nthe  welfare  of  the  local  population.  The  positive  effect  of  infrastructure  investments  on  rural  welfare  has  been \nempirically  demonstrated;  surveys  have  revealed  that  there\u2019s  a  significant  correlation  between  the  presence  of  good \nroads and a community\u2019s mean level of income.a  \n\n \nApproximately 60% of the population lives in rural areas where agriculture is the main source of livelihood. One reason \nfor  low  incomes  in  the  agriculture  sector  is  that  \u201cfarm  gate  prices\u201d  are  very  low  compared  with  urban  prices  for  the \nsame  goods  of  the  same  quality.  This  is  due  to  high  transport  costs  for  rural  marketable  surpluses  over  poor  quality \nroads. Transport costs are even higher for non-motor-vehicle transport methods in areas where roads are absent. In a \nrapid assessment of causes of poverty in five of Indonesia\u2019s districts, villagers in isolated areas identified high transport \ncosts  as  a  major  cause  of  poverty.  New  roads  in  previously  unserved  agricultural  areas  can  significantly  lower \ntransaction costs and hence raise farm gate prices, which will mean higher incomes for people in the agriculture sector, \nthe poorest group of the population.  \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n  \nDuring  preparation,  regular  consultations  were  held  with  key  stakeholders  (government  officials,  NGOs  and \ndevelopment  partners).  During  implementation,  the  program  will  maintain  broad  stakeholder  participation  to  discuss \nand  review  reform  efforts.  The  Government\u2019s  National  Community  Empowerment  Program  (PNPM)  supports \ncommunity  empowerment  and  strengthens  local  capacity  and  governance  to  implement  infrastructure  investments. \nThe  Government  has  engaged  extensively  with  civil  society  on  tax  and  investment  law  reforms.  The  entire  set  of \nDPSP-5 policy actions will likely feature in discussions with Parliament.  \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n \n\n \n\n Information sharing \n\n Consultation \n\n Collaborative decision making \n\n Empowerment \n\n Yes \n\n No  \n\n \n\n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \n  \nC. Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues.  \n\n \nThe  country  gender  assessment  identified  four  key  themes  through  a  consultative  process:  (i)  the  impact  of \ndecentralization  on  gender,  (ii)  women\u2019s  inadequate  representation  in  political  decision\\  making,  (iii)  violence  against \nwomen,  and  (iv)  women  and  international  migration.  While  Indonesia  has  made  progress  over  the  years,  gender \ninequalities persist. Indonesia was ranked 111 out of 182 economies in the United Nation's human development index \nin  2007  and  93  out  of  155  in  the  gender  development  index.  In  2007,  women\u2019s  labor  force  participation  was  40%, \ncompared with 80% for men. The shift to regional autonomy under the decentralization law has already shown potential \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n \n71\n\nfor increased participation of women in local governance.  \n\n \n2.  Key Actions.  \n\nDrawing  a  comprehensive  conclusion  on  issues  related  to  gender  and  income  poverty  in  Indonesia  is  difficult,  as \nconsistent,  disaggregated  data  by  sex  is  not  available.  DPSP-5  will  create  indirect  gender  impacts.  Improved  poverty \ntargeting  of public spending  will increase  women\u2019s access to essential services for achieving MDG targets, including \nreducing  child  and  maternal  mortality.  Improvement  of  financial  management  systems  and  governance,  through \nincreased transparency and accountability at all levels, will provide civil society with the basic information necessary to \nmonitor  government  actions  and  empower  men  and  women  in  communities  to  participate  in  policy  and  budget \ndecisions. To the extent that policies under DPSP increase credit to micro, small, and medium enterprises, the program \nwould have an indirect beneficial impact on women considering their predominant role in microenterprises. \n \nThe community-driven development approach used by the Government's PNPM program will ensure that perspectives of \nboth men  and  women are represented in planning,  designing,  and implementing village  infrastructure investments. The \ncommunity implementation organizations\u2019 executive committees will include at least two women, and at least 40% of the \ntotal membership will be women. Experience from the PNPM Mandiri reveal that the number of women on the committees \nvaries from few women to entirely women, depending on the circumstances of individual villages.  \n \n\n \n\n Gender plan \n\n Other actions/measures \n\n No action/measure \n\n \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nIssue \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\nStrategy to \nAddress Issue \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n Full Plan \n Short Plan \n Resettlement Framework \n No Action \n\n Plan \n Other Action \n Indigenous Peoples \n\nFramework \n\n No Action \n\n Plan \n Other Action  \n No Action \n\n Action \n No Action \n\n Plan \n Other Action \n No Action \n\nIV.
