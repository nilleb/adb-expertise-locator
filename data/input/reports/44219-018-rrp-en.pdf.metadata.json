The  project  is  prioritized  as  part  of  the  SASEC  Program\u2019s  Power  Generation  and \nTransmission Master Plan and Regional Cooperation Business Plan, 2014\u20132016.2  \n \n4. \nThe original project (footnote 1) was approved by the Board of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) on 4 July 2014, signed on 11 July 2014, and became effective on 15 January 2015. At the \ntime of approval, total financing for the project was $371.2 million, consisting of (i) $180.0 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s concessional ordinary capital resources (Loan 3139), (ii) $60.0 million equivalent from \nthe Government of Norway (Grant 0397), (iii) $11.2 million from ADB\u2019s Strategic Climate Fund (SCF) \n(Grant 0398), and (iv) a loan of $120.0 million from the European Investment Bank. Loan 3139, Grant \n0397, and Grant 0398 are closing on 30 June 2022. The first additional financing\u2014$20.0 million \n(Grant  0520)  from  ADB\u2019s  SCF\u2014was  approved  on  29  November  2016,  signed  on  18  January \n2017, and became effective on 19 May 2017. Grant 0520 is also closing on 30 June 2022. The \nNepal  Electricity  Authority  (NEA)  is  the  executing agency for  outputs  1,  2 and  5  and  Alternative \nEnergy Promotion Centre (AEPC) is the executing agency for output 3 and both are the executing \nagencies for output 4 of the project. \n \nThe project has been performing well and is rated on track since its approval. Of the net \n5. \ncurrent  loan  and  grants,  cumulative  contract  awards  total  $173.56  million  (80%)  and \ndisbursements $73.79 million (34%).  Under the loan and ADB-administered grant components \nimplemented  by  NEA,  12  of  13  contract  packages  have  been  awarded  and  the  procurement \nrelating  to  the  remaining  one  contract  package  (approximately  $6.5 million)  is  ongoing,  and  is \nexpected  to  be  awarded  within  2018.  The  components  implemented  by  AEPC  are  also \nprogressing  well  and  will  be  completed  within  the  original  implementation  period.  The \nimplementation under all the ongoing contracts are generally satisfactory. The current project is \ncomplying  with  safeguard  policy  requirements  and  overall  safeguard  implementation  is  rated \nsatisfactory. \n \n6. \nIn 2016, Norway decided to reduce its grant contribution from $60.0 million equivalent to \n$22.0 million equivalent following the more critical 2016 refugee crisis in Europe.  As a result of \nthis decision, the project now faces a funding gap in the components financed by Norway and \nimplemented  by  NEA.  Based  on  works  undertaken,  contracts  awarded,  revised  estimates  of \n\n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). Nepal: South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Power System Expansion \n\nProject.  https://www.adb.org/projects/44219-014/main \n\n2  ADB. 2013. Regional Cooperation Operations Business Plan: South Asia, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\ncontracts  still  to  be  awarded,  and  available  allocation  from  contingencies,  NEA  estimates  the \noverall funding gap to be approximately $20 million. The proposed second additional financing \nwill support the transmission of clean energy from hydropower and distribution subprojects that \nwere  originally  earmarked for  cofinancing  by  Norway,  and  a  prudent  contingency  allocation  to \ncover possible cost overruns on other subprojects and has been considered as climate change \nmitigation. \n \n7. \nThe project is accorded high priority by the government, and is consistent with the current \ncountry partnership strategy.3 The government has requested investment support from ADB to \ncover the shortfall resulting from the change in the financing arrangement with the Government \nof Norway.4 The project remains technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound. \n \nThe  executing  and  the  main  implementing  agency  of  the  project,  NEA  has  recently \n8. \nundergone significant positive changes in the financial and operational performance  which are \nnow evident. A recent (FY2017) tariff increase combined with NEA\u2019s efforts to target commercial \nelectricity losses, significantly reduced load-shedding in its distribution area, and a government-\nbacked financial restructuring plan led to the posting of NEA\u2019s first net profit in more than  10 \nyears. Another positive development is the enactment of the Electricity Regulatory Commission \nBill in 2018, which will lead to the formation of the Electricity Regulatory Commission (ERC), \nhelping to undertake important reform actions such as designing and approval of cost-reflective \nend-use electricity tariffs. \n \nB. \n\nImpacts and Outcome \n\nThe impacts and outcomes of the overall project will remain  unchanged. The impact \n9. \nwill be increased electricity access in Nepal and improved power exchange across the border. \nThe  project  will  have  the following  outcomes:  increased capacity  of the national  power grid \nand enhanced renewable energy development.5 \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nThe outputs of the overall project will remain the same as the current project: (i) power \ntransmission  capacity  increased,  (ii)  power  distribution  network  improved,  (iii)  mini  grid-based \nrenewable energy  systems  in off-grid  areas  increased, (iv)  capacity  development for  NEA  and \nAEPC provided, and (v) a utility-scale solar photovoltaic project developed.6  \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $466.5 million (Table 1). \n\nD. \n\n11. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n3  ADB. 2013.

The  proposed  technologies  and \ndesign concepts are similar to NEA\u2019s existing technologies and practices for transmission system \ndesign, construction, and operation, except that NEA had no experience with high-temperature, \nlow-sag  conductors.  The  potential  impacts  of  climate  change  on  electricity  transmission  and \ndistribution  will  also  be  considered.  Project  supervision  consultants  are  assisting  NEA  in \nimplementation of the current project. \n \n\n                                                \n7  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nB. \n \n17. \nThe  financial  analysis  of  the  project  was  updated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects.8 To reflect the most recently available cost information, all \nfinancial  costs  and  benefits  were  expressed  in  constant  2018  prices.  NEA\u2019s  weighted  average \ncost of capital was estimated at 1.5% (in pretax real terms). It is anticipated that the ERC (para. 8) \nwill determine the first cost-reflective electricity tariffs for FY 2020 (commencing July 2019.) For \nthe purposes of financial analysis, it was assumed that tariffs would remain at current levels until \nthen and subsequently increase at 2% per year in nominal terms. On this basis, the aggregate \nproject financial internal rate of return is estimated at 1.7%, which is comparable with the overall \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  1.5%.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated \nconservatively,  in  that  the  ERC  is  likely  to  determine  tariffs  that  are  higher  than  used  for  this \nanalysis. In particular, it is unlikely that the average tariff will decline in real terms over the analysis \nperiod.  However,  the  tariff-setting  philosophy  and  methodology  that  the  ERC  will  adopt  are \nunknown at present. \n \nNEA posted a net profit of NRs1.5 billion in FY2016\u2014its first profit in more than 10 years \n18. \n(para. 8). This improved outlook is tempered by the fact that the NEA\u2019s balance sheet still contains \nlong-term debt that is unlikely to ever be repaid, financing overvalued fixed assets against which \na  commercial  return  is  unlikely  to  ever  be  earned.  Further  balance  sheet  restructuring  and \nreconciliation will be required to ensure that the new sector regulator allows costs to be passed \nto consumers through electricity tariffs. \n \n19. \nThe  project  has  been  analyzed  for  economic  viability  using  a  with-  and  without-project \napproach  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects. 9 The \neconomic analysis conducted for the current project has been retained for this additional financing \nmainly because the original scope remains unchanged, with the additional financing being used \nto  fill  financing  gaps  resulting  from  a  change  in  the  cofinancing  arrangement.  The  economic \ninternal rate of return of the project is 22%. Sensitivity analysis shows that the project returns are \nrobust against changes to critical variables with a minimum  economic internal rate of return of \n16%. \n \nC. \n \n20. \nThe procurement capacity assessments of NEA conducted as part of due diligence for the \noriginal  project  remain  valid.  NEA  has  sufficient  experience  in  local  and  foreign  procurement, \nincluding ADB standard bidding procedures under domestic projects and external assistance from \ninternational development partners. \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\n21. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the NEA. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 7). \n \n22. \nThe pre-mitigation financial management risk is rated substantial considering the capacity \nof  the  NEA,  including  funds-flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting \nsystems, financial information systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. These \nfinancial management shortcomings are being addressed. The NEA has prepared new manuals \nfor internal audit and accounting and updated its internal control policies (all of which are due for \n\n                                                \n8  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n9  ADB. 2017. Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fapproval  by  the  NEA\u2019s  board  by  July  2018).  The  accounting  manual  now  largely  reflects \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards accounting requirements, and the NEA plans to start \nreporting  using  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  requirements  from  FY2020.  In \nanticipation of the introduction of a company-wide enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution \nbeing  supported  through  World  Bank,  the  NEA  is  about  to  complete  converting  accounting \ndatabases that were formerly maintained in Excel to Oracle databases. \n \n23. \nThe financial management assessment of the NEA conducted in September 2016 for the \nNepal  Power  Transmission  and  Distribution  Efficiency  Enhancement  Project  was  updated  in \n2018.10 The assessment found the key financial management weaknesses or risks to be (i) the \ncurrent spreadsheet-based accounting system is inflexible, prone to errors, and inadequate for \nan  entity  of  the  NEA\u2019s  size  and  complexity;  (ii)  inflated  assets  and  liabilities  should  be  written \ndown;  (iii)  resolution  of  audit  issues  is  inadequate;  (iv)  implementation  of  the  ERP-based \nintegrated financial management information system has been delayed; and (v) internal controls \nare  weak.  A  further  concern  arises  from  the  government\u2019s  preference  that  all  future  loans  will \ninvolve direct foreign currency borrowing by the NEA from development partners, with a sovereign \nguarantee.  The  NEA  also  had  difficulty  in  complying  with  financial  covenants  under  previous \nloans,  in particular  the  debt  service coverage ratio.    However,  the  recent  improvements  in  the \nNEA\u2019s financial results are encouraging. The possible delay in operationalization of the recently \nestablished ERC is also a potential risk. \n \nD. \n \n24. \nThe assessment of the current project\u2019s poverty and social dimensions remains valid. The \nadditional  financing  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  and  the  current \nproject\u2019s  Gender  Equality  and  Social  Inclusion  Action  Plan  will  continue  to  be  implemented. \nEnhanced  electricity  access,  end-user  awareness-raising  activities,  strengthening  of  mini-grid \nrenewable energy systems, and promotion of productive energy use will all contribute to reducing \nwomen\u2019s  time  poverty.  The  executing  agencies  and  contractors  will  ensure  that  priority  and \npreference  are  given  to  local  workers,  including  women  and  marginalized  ethnic  groups. \nEmployment practices will adhere to national core labor standards.11 \n \nE. \n \n25. \nEnvironment (Category C). The additional financing will be used to cover a funding gap \nwithin  the  existing  scale  and  scope.  In  this  regard,  the  additional  financing  is  classified  as \nenvironment category C in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The current \nproject is category B and all environmental safeguards requirements\u2014such as preparation of initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  and  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs)  for  all \ntransmission line packages under the project\u2014have been complied with, approved by both ADB \nand the government, and disclosed on the ADB website. No additional scope of work has been \nadded under the additional financing, and therefore the IEE and EMP requirements will continue \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n10 ADB. \n\nTransmission \nhttps://www.adb.org/projects/50059-001/main. \n\nNepal: \n\nPower \n\nand \n\nDistribution \n\nEfficiency \n\nEnhancement \n\nProject. \n\n11 The cost for implementation of the  Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan  is estimated at $1.5 million; \nactivities under the plan led by NEA will be financed under ADB. 2014. Report and Recommendation of the President \nto the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan, Technical Assistance Grant, and Administration of Grants to Nepal for the \nSouth Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Power System Expansion Project. Manila (Grant 0397-NEP), in the \namount of $0.5 million; and activities under the AEPC estimated at $1.0 million, from available technical assistance \nresources under the  Grant 3098\u2013NEP: South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Power System Expansion \nProject. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fto be applicable. The tree clearance plan for the transmission line packages has been approved \nby the government, and will also be applicable for the additional financing. \n \n26. \nThe  IEE  and  EMPs  for  all  components  include  mitigation  measures,  monitoring,  and \nbudgetary provisions that are adequate to address the environmental impacts of both the current \nproject and the additional financing. The EMP requirements have been incorporated in the bidding \ndocuments. The current project requires implementing the EMP, regularly monitoring safeguard \ncompliance,  and  timely  submission  of  periodic  environmental  compliance  monitoring  reports. \nThese compliance requirements will continue under the additional financing. The NEA and AEPC \nare supervising EMP implementation, including preparation of semiannual monitoring reports with \nthe  support  of  environment  consultant.  Public  consultation  and \ninformation  disclosure \nrequirements have been met, including consultation with the local stakeholders and the district \nforest offices. Hence, the current project\u2019s safeguards implementation, monitoring, and reporting \nmechanism  will  continue,  along  with  the  inputs  of  the  environmental  safeguard  consultant  in \nproject  management  consultancy.  The  services  of  NEA\u2019s  environment  and  social  studies \ndepartment will also support the project in EMP and occupational health and safety assurance. \n \n27. \nSocial  safeguards  (category  C  for  both  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous \npeoples).  The  social  safeguard  requirements  for  the  current  project  are  unchanged,  as  the \nadditional financing involves no additional scope or civil works activity other than planned under the \noriginal scope of work. The additional financing will cover the shortfall in the loan amount resulting \nfrom a change in the agreed cofinancing arrangement to complete the components in the current \nproject. All activities under the additional financing will be implemented using land already acquired \nunder the ongoing loan. No land acquisition or impacts on indigenous people are envisaged for the \nadditional financing. A combined resettlement and indigenous peoples plan (RIPP) was prepared \nfor the current project covering all project components, and has been approved by ADB and the \ngovernment. The RIPP is being implemented. The involuntary resettlement category for the current \nproject will remain category A, and the indigenous people category will remain category B while this \nadditional financing project is category C for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. \n \n28. \nSocial  safeguards  measures  will  be  achieved  in  line  with  the  provisions  stated  in  the \nPAM.12 Social safeguards plan implementation, monitoring, and reporting; the grievance redress \nmechanism; and the compliance review procedure established for the current project will remain \nunchanged and will also be applicable to the additional financing. PMD submits social safeguard \nmonitoring  reports  to  ADB  and  these  are  reviewed  and  disclosed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. PMD is satisfactorily implementing all safeguards requirements, and \nsocial  safeguard  implementation  issues  arising  during  implementation  are  being  addressed \neffectively.  The  inputs  of  the  safeguard  and  social  development  support  consultant  in  project \nmanagement consultancy will continue to (i) build capacity of the PMD and relevant stakeholders; \n(ii) support the PMD in the finalization of the updated RIPP following completion of the remaining \ntransmission line surveys; and (iii) ensure that the RIPP is implemented in accordance with social \nand environmental safeguard requirements, and monitor safeguard compliance. \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n12 Sections VII (safeguards) and VIII (gender and social) of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list \n\nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n \n29.
